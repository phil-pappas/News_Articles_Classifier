It's weird because it's flipped from when we started through the preseason and the first game of the year was a fast start, and now, it's kind of flipped. We grow every week. We get better. Hopefully, the blend of those two things, we start fast and then, we keep it up, will be part of us taking the next step. \n\"It's something that's obviously in the forefront of my mind. I want to get back to doing what we were doing through the preseason, through that first game of the year when we started fast and moved the ball down the field and got points and touchdowns. We'll be focused on that, for sure. \n\"It is little plays here and there that we felt like we came out of the gate and missed a few, but we had a fourth-down opportunity there the other day in the game and just came up short. You get that conversion and then, we are off and moving. I didn't really have an issue with those plays. There were just little things here and there within those plays that kept us from being right, but it wasn't the play call. I like where our openers have been when we started games. It is just about executing.\" \nGetting off to a fast start is something the Rams have struggled with on the defensive side of the football. \nThe Rams have been outscored, 37-7, in the first quarter of each of their first five games. And although they have outscored their opponents, 57-35, in the second and third quarters, the Rams have allowed their opponents to score 41 points in the fourth quarter. \n\"Sometimes, it is a matter of figuring an opponent out,\" Browns coach Mike Pettine said. \"They do a good job early and we are still getting a sense for how they are playing us. There have been a couple games where teams have come out and played us a little bit different than what we anticipated and have had to make adjustments. With the quarterback, there have been some games where he has missed some throws early and has gotten in a groove and a better sense of what we were getting and improved as the game goes on. \n\"They are all different. I don't see that necessarily as a reoccurring problem for us as being slow starters. Some games, we have gotten out of the gate. You look at the very first game of the year, offensively, that drive, 17, 18 plays, whatever it was. I don't think that is a huge concern, but it is a priority every week. That is why we script out the openers. The guys know these are the formations, these are the plays we are going to run. They have a good sense, and they can study them and know them. That is important. Especially on the road, you want to get out of the gate early to get the crowd out of it.\" \nAlthough they have been outscored in the first and fourth quarters of play, the Rams have generated 19 sacks for 100 lost yards, a pass rush that the Browns hope to avoid on Sunday. \n\"J ust like Denver, they have a great front and they can create pressure with four guys, but sometimes, they like to mix it up and not only those four or the same four, but they like to bring different guys and use different packages, so we'll have to have a plan for that,\" McCown said. \n\"Obviously, Greg Williams has done an excellent job with that defense. Had the chance to face them the last two years so they always come out, they play hard and give you a lot of looks and cause you to have to study a lot. Our coaches are putting together a good plan for it. We'll have a plan for it. It'll just be about being able to execute and pick those things up so that we can drop back and get the ball off. \n\"(Head coach) Jeff Fisher is a heck of a coach, in my opinion, and has done a good job. They've done a good job building that team from when they took it over to now. It's fun to go against them. They play hard, they play really hard and obviously, very talented.\" \nMcCown knows very well just how talented the Rams defense is, as he has competed against them in each of the last two seasons, and in his eyes, they keep getting better. \nThe Rams' entire starting defensive line, left end Chris Long, tackles Aaron Donald and Michael Brockers and right end Robert Quinn, were all first-round picks in recent drafts, and reserve linebacker Alec Ogletree was also a first-round selection. \n\"It's a heck of a team now as far as defensively what we're dealing with because of that talent,\" McCown said. \"Guys get picked in the first round for a reason, and it shows up on tape, shows up when those guys are playing. \n\"Just the talent that they have, Robert Quinn is as good a pass rusher as you'll have in the league, and then, Aaron Donald is playing at such a high level. I would put him up there with anybody in the league as far as the three technique goes, and the other guys aren't bad, but just speaking of those two guys, when you have two guys on your line that are in the top in the league, you can create issues. Five first rounders, obviously, they can stay fresh, they can keep rolling guys through and create problems for you. \n\"The first time, it was like two first rounders, and now, it's five first rounders. They keep just picking those guys. They're up front, for sure. Like I said, those guys can stay fresh. When they come in, they can roll in different guys and they can come in and play really hard and that's the thing you have to keep up with because if you don't, they'll disrupt.\" 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1S32Q0N TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:23:07.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
