USA TODAY Sports\nJoe Philbin went 24-28 in three-plus years with the Dolphins. (Photo: Thomas J. Russo, USA TODAY Sports)\nMaybe Stephen Ross finally had some sort of epiphany in London after witnessing yet another embarrassing performance by his Miami Dolphins under the watch of Joe Philbin.\nI know what I would have thought, if in Ross' ownership shoes, as I cringed at the sight of the New York Jets defense making a mockery of Philbin's offense with their exotic blitzes. Something like a flashback — I could have had that guy running my team.\nThe inglorious end of the Philbin Era as Dolphins coach came with a cruel irony: His final game came against a Jets team coached by Todd Bowles, who was the Miami interim coach passed over (along with another finalist, now-San Diego Chargers coach Mike McCoy) when Ross and his brain trust hand-picked Philbin in 2012.\nGuess they got that one wrong.\nUSA TODAY\nMiami Dolphins fire coach Joe Philbin after 1-3 start\nNow Bowles is off to a rousing start with the Jets (3-1) after finally landing a head coaching job. McCoy won a playoff game in his first year as a first-time head coach with the Chargers in 2013.\nPhilbin? He never had a winning season.\nHis case doesn't illustrate the risk in hiring a first-time coach — there are many successful examples, like Mike Tomlin and Sean Payton — as much as it underscores the skill in picking the right person.\nOf course, it can't be easy. Teams bungle coaching hires all the time. But Ross, a relatively new owner, needs to learn through this experience while contemplating who fits the job and why.\nUSA TODAY\n6 coaching candidates the Dolphins could consider to replace Joe Philbin\nIt's early, but the Atlanta Falcons' new hire, Dan Quinn, is sure living up to his reputation as a high-energy lightning rod who inspires his team. Conversely, Philbin was derided in NFL circles as a \"high school gym coach,\" which isn't exactly an endorsement of the respect he earned from his players.\nNot every coach needs to spew fire and brimstone. A big personality hardly guarantees a championship (see my man Rex Ryan). Bowles, for example, has a low-keyed public persona but has earned major props for his high football IQ and ability to relate to players.\nPhilbin wasn't ready for his opportunity. But what memories he leaves behind.\nHe cut a washed-up Chad Ochocinco on HBO's Hard Knocks , making a high-character statement against domestic violence.\nUSA TODAY\n50 things we learned in Week 4 of the NFL season\nPhilbin went into damage-control mode after the bullying scandal that featured since-departed linemen Richie Incognito and Jonathan Martin while providing a statement about how a coach can be so clueless about his locker room culture. Philbin seemed even more unwitting for the double standard that was ultimately revealed: Before the bullying episode came to light, he'd put Incognito on the team's leadership council, even after an incident at a charity golf course that involved inappropriate physical contact with a female volunteer.\nThen there was the pathetic regression of quarterback Ryan Tannehill and the offense that surrounds him. Philbin came to Miami after serving as the Green Bay Packers offensive coordinator, which associates him with Aaron Rodgers and Mike McCarthy.\nBut Philbin did not bring the Green Bay magic to South Beach.\nHe was destined to go, given the lifelessness of his team. The back-to-back blowout losses to AFC East foes (the Buffalo Bills thumped the Dolphins at home 41-14 in Week 3) were signs that things were not getting better, even though Philbin maintained Sunday that the season could still be salvaged. Miami has been outscored 37-3 in the first quarter this season, which says a lot about not having a team ready to play.\nWhile the offense tanked, the once-formidable defense has caved, too, which is why coordinator Kevin Coyle may be next to go. The Dolphins rank last against the run, last in sacks and 30th in total yards allowed — and that's with the $114 million addition of Ndamukong Suh. Miami's three consecutive losses came against quarterbacks Blake Bortles, Tyrod Taylor and Ryan Fitzpatrick — who are not to be confused with Tom Brady, Peyton Manning and Rodgers.\nUSA TODAY\nNFL Week 4 overreactions: Should Cowboys weigh QB change?\nStill, some of the tales that surfaced Monday added substance to the typical, new-coach mantra expressed by interim boss Dan Campbell. Tannehill, team leader and all, reportedly had beefs with practice squad players who were picking him off in practice — and Philbin supposedly told his JV group to lighten up on the quarterback to help boost his confidence. That's no way to develop a competitive environment.\nMaybe Campbell, now the NFL's youngest coach at 39, can fix it. But history shows that coaching moves made this early in the season never turn into a quick ticket to the playoffs.\nThe bottom line is that the Dolphins had better get it right the next time they hire a coach.\n***\nFollow NFL columnist Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell\nVIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL NFL Inside Slant: No reason for panic in Dallas | 00:50 USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero explains why Matt Cassel isn't the answer for the Cowboys despite two straight losses without Tony Romo.
