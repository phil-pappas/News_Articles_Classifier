When his right ankle was contorted on the first play of scrimmage in the second half, he was scared to look.\n“I thought it would be facing the other way,” Rolle said.\nBut it wasn’t, and the X-rays were full of good news, too. Nothing was broken. So Rolle made sure to rejoin his team on the sideline to cheer on their 22-20 victory against the Raiders at Soldier Field on Sunday.\n“That was extremely important to me to be out there with my guys,” Rolle said. “They played outstanding.”\nAs far as his injury, Rolle promised to back as soon as possible. He said didn’t know if he had a high-ankle sprain, but he was in a protective walking boot.\n“Thank God nothing is broken,” said Rolle, who was transported by cart to the locker room when he was hurt. “It could have been a lot worse than what it really is. The X-rays came back negative. … I’m going to keep grinding and just keep on pushing. I plan on being back in no time.\n“It got rolled up pretty bad. It’s a part of the game. I’m just glad I was able to get up and walk off the field. … It’s time to rehab and grind.\nRolle last missed a game in 2009, when he sat out the season finale with a thigh injury. Against the Raiders, Rolle was replaced by rookie Harold Jones-Quartey, an undrafted rookie who was claimed off waivers from the Cardinals.\n“I’m a fighter, man,” Rolle said. “My body heals fairly well. … I don’t like missing time.”\nFollow me on Twitter @adamjahns\nEmail: ajahns@suntimes.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:04:17.800+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
