The Tigers traded David Price and Yoenis Cespedes at the deadline, but they still have plenty of money invested in Miguel Cabrera, Justin Verlander, Victor Martinez, Anibal Sanchez and Ian Kinsler. \nAvila says he wants to acquire two new starting pitchers to bolster a pitching staff that slipped dramatically in 2015. Verlander and Sanchez are expected back, and Daniel Norris — acquired in the deal for Price — is one of a handful of young candidates for the rotation. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:27:35.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
