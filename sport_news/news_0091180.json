Just 88 days after Neil Armstrong took his giant leap, the Amazins were champions.\nNow Tyler Clippard is convinced an extraterrestrial has led the Mets back to the Fall Classic.\n\"He's not human. He's not on this planet right now,\" Clippard said about Daniel Murphy . \"Another life form jumped into his body.\"\nHeading into a World Series matchup that opens in Kansas City or Toronto on Tuesday night, it seems as if it is in the stars whenever the Mets are successful.\nIn 1969, there were hard-to-fathom catches by Tommy Agee and Ron Swoboda in the Series against Baltimore. Cleon Jones reached first base on a hit batsman call during a Game 5 rally when manager Gil Hodges showed a ball with shoe polish to an umpire.\nMore Information\nWorld Series\nAll games televised on Fox-23\nGame 1: Tuesday: at Toronto or Kansas City\nGame 2: Wednesday: at Toronto or Kansas City\nGame 3: Oct. 30: at N.Y.

This is special. I can't stop saying it,\" captain David Wright exclaimed. \"The '69 Mets, the '86 Mets, the 2000 Mets â€” we are amongst the best Mets teams to ever play, and I couldn't be more proud.\"\nThe Mets are back in the Series led by a brash young pitching staff that includes the Dark Knight ( Matt Harvey ), Thor (Noah Syndergaard), the deGrominator (Jacob deGrom) and Steven Matz , a group whose 147 regular-season career starts easily would be the fewest for a Series foursome.\nMets manager Terry Collins had not led a major-league team since 1999, when was hired before the 2011 season. Now 66, the oldest manager in the major leagues, he had skippered 1,688 regular-season games before advancing to the Series for the first time.\n\"I'm sitting there tonight thinking, holy crap, now you're in it after all these years,\" Collins said. \"It was worth the wait. It was worth all the work.\"", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/17/8836066/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/30/8836640/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/30/8836640/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/17/8836066/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:32:24.927+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
