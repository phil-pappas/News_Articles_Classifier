He did not play in the preseason game, a preview of the two teams that will open the regular season in Phoenix next Wednesday.\nEven without playing, it was an emotional evening for Chandler, who was understandably disturbed and probably a little untrusting of the Mavericks organization, which twice has let him walk away in free agency.\nOne thing is certain: It didn't take long for Chandler to know he was destined to be a former Maverick for the second time in five seasons. The team also let him walk after the 2011 championship.\nThe Mavericks' failed recruitment of DeAndre Jordan cemented Chandler's belief.\n\"I didn't feel like I needed to play second fiddle to anybody,\" Chandler said. \"I felt like I didn't deserve that. I felt like I'd accomplished a lot in this league, and I wasn't going to play second fiddle to anybody.\"\nChandler did not have any disparaging remarks about the Mavericks, owner Mark Cuban or anybody connected with the organization, other than to say Cuban is a great owner who \"has made two mistakes.\"\nThat would be the two decisions to let Chandler leave in free agency.\nThe 7-1 center also said he was caught by surprise with the way the Mavericks played their cards in free agency. He understands as well as anybody that it is a business and owners make the decisions.\nCuban and Chandler both said that an extension was on the table from the Mavericks before last season began, but that Chandler and his agent elected to try free agency because of the extra contractual year that was available in that scenario.\nThen when the free-agent gates opened, Chandler said he was blindsided.\n\"The process wasn't straight up,\" he said. \"I didn't see it coming. I thought I was here for the long haul. I thought after my exit meeting that I was coming back, to be quite honest. When I left in the parking lot, I thought, 'We'll be back. This time, we'll settle in.' But it didn't work out that way.\"\nCuban said that Chandler has every right to be bitter.\n\"I would be, too,\" he said. \"We had extension discussions for a reason. And then we went for it on a player that wasn't ready to be gone for.\"\nWhen it was over, the Mavericks ended up with neither of their top-target centers, with Jordan staying with the LA Clippers and Chandler moving on to Phoenix. Cuban was asked if he was concerned about what message that sends to players who like stability in organizations they might be considering in free agency.\n\"You always worry a little bit, but at the same time, at least we're honest about the whole thing, right?\" he said. \"You don't see us blaming it on the players. Or making excuses. If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. I've said, to be very clear, that Tyson has every right to be upset. But at the same time, it's also no surprise that sometimes you just have to go for it in this league. It works for you sometimes, and sometimes it doesn't. I'd rather swing and miss than not step up to the plate.\"\nChandler, whose name graces the championship banner in the AAC rafters, said one of the things that lingers with him is the fact that he did not get a chance to add to his Maverick legacy. Tack on another four years to the two one-year stints he had, and he might have a serious argument for having his jersey retired when he's done.\nRick Carlisle, by the way, already believes Chandler has earned that right.\n\"He truly is one of the all-time great Mavericks, there's just no doubt about it,\" Carlisle said. \"And this past summer was the byproduct of the high-stakes things you go through, the risks you take. We attempted to get the team significantly younger. It didn't work out, and he decided to leave.\n\"We have nothing but the utmost respect for him. It's my hope that one day he will get consideration to have his number retired here. I think he deserves that consideration. And I know Mark really has great respect for him, even [with] the way things went twice.\"\nBriefly: The Mavericks had 11 players available against Phoenix, and the lack of quality depth showed as they were outscored 27-6 over a six-minute span, finally losing 99-87. Their preseason record now is 0-6. ... On the bright side, the Mavericks rebounded well. Zaza Pachulia had 12 boards in 19 minutes, and Dwight Powell had 10 in 25 minutes. ... Wesley Matthews and/or Deron Williams could see their first preseason action Friday. Both were part of a spirited three-on-three game after the morning practice session, staged under the watchful eye of athletic trainer Casey Smith.\nOn Twitter:\n @ESefko", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ESefko"], "published": "2015-10-22T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:58:48.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
