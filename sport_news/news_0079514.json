However, in the end it wasn't meant to be, as the Lancers defense held strong and maintained the advantage for their ninth win of the season. \nFollowing the victory, Lancers head coach Patricia Kebrdle said she was proud of her girls for the way they continued to play the whole 60 minutes. \n\"They stepped up,\" she said. \"They played the whole game. No one stopped playing. Everybody was in it. This was a good field hockey game.\" \nSenior Sarah Anthony, who finished the game with a goal and an assist, said the key during the Patriots offensive onslaught was to maintain their composure. \n\"We made sure we stayed calm and we continued to play our game instead of letting our guard down,\" she said. \"We knew Wayne Hills is gonna come out strong, so even though we're playing great, we had to play better in the second half.\" \nSenior goalkeeper Allison Cappello, who finished with six saves on the day, added, \"it's a good win for us.\" \nThe Lancers wasted little time getting on the scoreboard to start the game, finding the back of the net within the first ten minutes when freshman Alex Barna knocked it in from near the left post for a 1-0 lead. \nThen, around the 16', the Lancers were presented with a golden opportunity to add to their lead when senior Daphne Leenas latched onto a ball centered into the middle of the box, only to see Patriots junior goalkeeper Rachel Vellis make a sprawling save. \nDespite the letdown, the Lancers would make up for the lost opportunity about three minutes later when they earned a penalty shot, allowing Anthony to step up to the spot with only Vellis to beat. \n\"I know Wayne Hills is a great team so I had to really analyze it and pick what would work best,\" she said. \nIn the end she did just that, lifting her shot to the left of and past Vellis for what proved to be the game-winning goal and a 2-0 Lancers lead, a lead they would take into the halftime break. \nKebrdle said, \"we were passing. We were running to space. We were in front of the ball. We were moving our feet. It was probably one of the best halves we've had all year and you gotta have that against Wayne Hills. There a solid, good team.\" \nIn addition to tallying two goals, the Lancers also played suffocating defense in the first half, rarely allowing the Patriots to get off a shot. \n\"We were all communicating well,\" Anthony said. \"We were dropping, we were hitting out wide and sending great balls.\" \nSimilar to how they started the game, the Lancers started the second half in similar fashion. Within the first ten minutes of the half, the Lancers found their third goal for a 3-0 cushion. The goal would come off the stick of junior Molly Davison, as she redirected a ball sent in the direction of the goal by Anthony. \nKebrdle said getting that third goal was hugely important, especially when you're playing a team like Wayne Hills. \n\"There too good of a team to let any goals be unanswered so we needed a little cushion any time you play anybody like Wayne Hills,\" she said. \"They dominated our counties for quite a long time so every goal helps.\" \nIn the end the Lancers got enough goals on this day, as they were able to come out on top despite heavy pressure from the Patriots coming out of the break. The Patriots would get one back with under five minutes left in the contest, but it proved too little too late. \n\"You have to always play well when you play Wayne Hills,\" Kebrdle said. \"There a very well coached, well developed team and we did today.\" Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:55:23.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
