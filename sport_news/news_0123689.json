Fewer than three minutes later, Gelinas' slap shot tied on the Devils' second power play. \nWashington outshot the Devils 11-5 in the second period but failed to capitalize on a two-man advantage that lasted 1:38. T.J. Oshie had the best chance of the stretch when the Devils were caught on a line change, but Kinkaid stretched out his right pad to deny the forward. \nMoments later at even strength, Holtby denied Henrique on with a similar stop. \nNOTES: According to the Capitals, Chimera's opening goal marked the first time Washington's first goal of the season came short-handed. . 27-year-old center Brian O'Neill got a rude awakening in his NHL debut, falling to the ice after a first-period shoulder-to-shoulder collision with Oshie. . The Capitals were the last team in the Metropolitan Division to play their season opener. . With Saturday's game, the Devils closed their first of 12 sets of back-to-back games. Their next comes on Nov. 27-28. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:53:49.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
