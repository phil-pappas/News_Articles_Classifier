(Photo: Robert Scheer/The Star) Buy Photo Story Highlights Jaguars at Colts, 1 p.m. Sunday, CBS \nHere are five storylines ahead of the Indianapolis Colts (1-2) hosting the Jacksonville Jaguars (1-2) at 1 p.m. Sunday (CBS) at Lucas Oil Stadium: \n1) The availability of Andrew Luck: So, yeah, the quarterback. This is mildly important. Coach Chuck Pagano officially listed Luck as questionable for Sunday’s game, but the expectation Luck will be out there seems to have waned considerably since earlier in the week. Still hampered by that sore right throwing shoulder, the Colts quarterback was limited in practice Wednesday, Thursday and Friday . He was seen throwing before Wednesday’s workout, but not since. \nHe has made 57 consecutive starts to begin his NFL career. Pagano believes it will be 58 . \n“It’s Andrew Luck,” Pagano said Friday. “If I was going to bet on anybody, it’d be that guy. Now if he can’t (play)? He can’t. Then we’ll deal with that if we have to cross that bridge.” \nIt’s why the Colts brought in Matt Hasselbeck three years ago . The 40-year-old backup, with 152 career starts, professed a confidence throughout the week that if called upon he could deliver. Hasselbeck hasn’t started a game since 2012. \n“That’s my job,” Hasselbeck said. “I need to do that. It’s one of the things required by my job. If necessary, I’ll be ready to go.” \nIf Luck indeed sits, it'll be the first time since the 2009 Sun Bowl -- December 31, 2009, Luck's freshman season at Stanford -- that he missed a football game due to injury. No Colts blackout, but still no Uverse deal \n2) Good thing they got Gore: This is why the Colts waved goodbye to Trent Richardson in the offseason and dished out a $12 million contract to Frank Gore . For games like Sunday. With or without Luck, the Colts’ offense figures to rely heavily on Gore, the five-time Pro Bowler who has quickly added some firepower to the team’s lackluster backfield. \nIt has been 42 games since the Colts had a running back eclipse 100 yards – the longest streak in the NFL. You have to go all the way back to Week 15 of the 2012 season and Vick Ballard’s 105-yard day to find the only time in the Luck era the Colts have had a running back hit triple digits. Don’t be surprised if Gore gets there Sunday. \nThe best way to shield a bruised quarterback from more beating? \nHave him hand the ball off all afternoon. \nGore has only averaged 12 carries per game through the early parts of this season, but with a not-quite-100-percent Luck out there, or with Hasselbeck filling in, expect the Colts to lean on the run game far more than they typically do. Colts Pick'em Game \n3) Can Bortles beat you? The Colts haven’t proven to have much of a pass rush this season. Luckily, for them, they’ve played Tyrod Taylor, Ryan Fitzpatrick and Marcus Mariota – not exactly a murderer’s row of quarterbacking firepower. (That comes later, when the Colts see Tom Brady, Drew Brees and Peyton Manning in a one-month span. It starts Oct. 18 at Lucas Oil Stadium when the Patriots come to town.) \nBut four sacks in three games? That ranks the Colts 21st in the league, and in today’s pass-happy NFL, that’s begging for trouble. Strangely, the quarterback the Colts will see Sunday – Jags starter Blake Bortles – has fared better under pressure (a 0.1 rating, according to Pro Football Focus) than not under pressure (a -4.2 rating). So the Colts might be better off not blitzing and letting Bortles sit in the pocket. \nBortles has attempted 27 passes farther than 20 yards downfield, most in the league, and he’s just 9-for-27 on those throws. \nDOWNLOAD : IndyStar's Colts app offers all the Colts news \n4) Help on the way: The Colts figure to welcome back two defensive starters Sunday, linebacker Trent Cole and cornerback Darius Butler. Butler’s return will ease the pressure on the team’s shaky secondary, one that was forced to rely on the likes of Josh Thomas, Eric Patterson and Sheldon Price in recent weeks. Butler, typically the team’s nickel corner, will pair with Pro Bowler Vontae Davis to give the Colts’ their best duo at the position since Week 1 in Buffalo. \nMeanwhile, cornerback Greg Toler continues to practice in a limited capacity while he deals with the lingering effects of a neck injury. Toler, who hasn’t played in a game this season, hasn’t been cleared for contact. \nTight end Dwayne Allen is the only other Colt – besides Luck – listed as questionable for Sunday’s game. Asked about his status in the locker room Friday, Allen, dealing with an ankle injury suffered in a Week 2 loss to the Jets, didn’t sound optimistic. Expect the Colts to keep their fourth-year tight end on the sideline for a second straight week. Colts predictions: No Luck, no problem? \n5) AFC South history: With a victory, the Colts would secure their 15th consecutive win in the division, which would tie the 1972-73 Miami Dolphins for the longest such streak in NFL history. \nThe Colts’ last divisional loss came in Week 15 of the 2012 season, which ironically, was the last time they had a 100-yard rusher. At 17-2, the Colts are second in the league in games against divisional opponents since 2012 (only Denver’s 18-1 record is better). Indianapolis has won nine divisional crowns since the league realigned in 2002, second only to New England’s 11. \nCall Star reporter Zak Keefer at (317) 444-6134 and follow him on Twitter: @zkeefer. 2 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1Rn3Cp3 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T15:22:17.278+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
