Michael Peake/Toronto Sun/Postmedia Network Article Joe Carter talks Bautista bat flip, Donaldson for MVP \nThe greatest Toronto sporting season in decades has come to an end - a ride unlike any other - and what an embarrassment it is that Alex Anthopoulos went to work Monday morning without absolute knowledge that he has a job beyond next week. \nThis is how Rogers conducts its baseball business: They are a company flourishing from the great Blue Jays run, stock prices going through the roof, demand for tickets at an all-time high, and the man who made it all possible is left dangling in the wind, almost entirely because club ownership is so clumsy when it comes to baseball matters it keeps tripping over itself. \nThere is only one reason we even know that Anthopoulos’ contract expires on Saturday. Someone from Rogers leaked the information. If you know Anthopoulos at all, you will know he leaks nothing. He won’t tell you what he ate for lunch. He trades for Josh Donaldson when there are no rumours about a Donaldson trade. He operates like the magician who does a trick right in front of you and you are so astounded by the dexterity that you want him to do it again. Just so you can try to understand what just happened. \nThis was the season of Anthopoulos in Toronto. He had an all-time November, trading for Marco Estrada and Donaldson, signing Russell Martin as a free agent in one month. Anybody in baseball do anything like that? \nThen came the deadline of all deadlines: It was like completing the perfect stew. He added a touch of David Price, a dash of Troy Tulowitzki, a sprinkling of Ben Revere and a little Mark Lowe, Cliff Pennington and LaTroy Hawkins and suddenly from all these ingredients there was tremendous flavour. An American League East champion. An AL Division Series winner. Had it not been for a myopic umpire in Game 6, there might have been a Game 7 in Kansas City and after that, who knows? \nBut without Estrada, Donaldson, Martin, Price, Tulowitzki and Revere, none of this happens. That wasn’t Ed Rogers or anyone from ownership doing that. That wasn’t the outgoing president Paul Beeston, although he did play a large role in the signing of Martin. That was the workaholic, tell-nobody-nothing, general manager, who hates the fact people know his contractual status because that interferes with him trying to do his job. \nIf you follow the bouncing baseball here and go back to last October, if Rogers had its way it would have replaced both Beeston and Anthopoulos at the time. That was the internal plan of more than just Ed Rogers. \nHad they fired Beeston and Anthopoulos, there would have been no playoff chase, playoff race, or the past three months to talk about and celebrate. \nThey did a deal with Beeston to stick around for one more season. Messy as that may have been, they at least provided him with the kind of ending - or Anthopoulos did - to give him the proper exit. In the meantime they went to Major League Baseball, or baseball came to them and somebody offered up the name of Mark Shapiro as a possible replacement for Beeston. \nIt might be a terrific choice. It might be a terrible choice. The thing is, we don’t know. Shapiro’s Cleveland Indians were one of the worst teams in the American League this season. If they hired him to sell tickets, they’ve hired the wrong man. The Indians have been among the worst drawing teams in baseball the past four seasons. So what, exactly, is Shapiro’s job description as he begins as president of the club on Nov. 1? \nIf Rogers wanted Shapiro and Anthopoulos to work together, and demanded that Anthopoulos be the general manager going forward, would they not have brought the two of them together prior to this and made certain they were a fit of some kind that could work? Would they not have established a working situation, where the job descriptions are such that both men are comfortable and productive working together? \nNone of that was done. Anthopoulos would like to continue as general manager, being a general manager. He doesn’t just deserve more money, he deserves more power. But we don’t know how this fits together. \nAs of today, Shapiro, who has done nothing as a Blue Jay, has a long-term contract as president of the club. \nAnd Anthopoulos, who had the year of all years of any general manager in any sport, has a contract that expires on Saturday. \nThey may settle this thing. They may settle it well and Shapiro and Anthopoulos could end up working together and wonderfully well for years to come. \nThe thing is, we don’t know. \nThey don’t know. \nThe owners don't know. \nIt’s a helluva way to build off the momentum of this season we'll never forget. \nsteve.simmons@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T22:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:29:15.738+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
