( Aaron R. Atencio / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nMike Felton was panicking, but his players weren't. \nWith his team down 5-2 midway through the fifth inning, the Loveland softball coach watched anxiously from his third base coaching box as one Indian after another found a way to reach base, one way or another. \n\"You didn't see the white knuckles gripping the bat like last year,\" Felton said. \nIt began with a base hit by Blair Bernhardt, an in-game substitution in her first at-bat. Singles by Tatum Rembao, Braxton Morby and Abby Lukkes followed to really get things going. \nThen Wendy Dykstra provided the knockout punch, a two-strike, two-run triple the opposite way to suddenly give the Indians the lead in a game they had been silent for the previous three frames. Kassi Reiger drove home Dykstra a batter later for good measure to cap Loveland's five-run fifth-inning rally, the difference in the Indians' 8-5 win over Front Range League foe Fossil Ridge on Thursday at Centennial Ball Park. \nAfter scoring a pair in the first on RBI by Morby and Lukkes, the Indians' offense was held well in check by Fossil Ridge pitcher Maria Ostapovich, who retired nine straight at one point. Advertisement \nBut the Indians' third time through the order proved to be the charm, as did keeping the right attitude and their ability to capitalize on the spark provided by Bernhardt's leadoff infield single. \n\"We were just staying positive, having fun,\" Dykstra said. \"When one person starts, everyone just gets super hyper and having fun. It just keeps going.\" \nThe fifth-ranked Indians had six hits in the game-changing fifth, compared to just four the rest of the game. \nBut all that mattered was the end result, which extended the Indians' win streak to seven in moving them to 13-3 overall and 7-1 in league play, keeping pace atop the FRL with fellow one-loss foes Broomfield and Mountain Range. \n\"I told them, 'You guys have won seven straight. You have to win three more to win the league,'\" said Felton, whose team still has Poudre, Rocky Mountain and Horizon left on the schedule. \"So you've got to win 10 straight to win this league.\" \nAs important as Loveland's clutch hitting was in the fifth-inning rally, it was its defense early that kept the deficit manageable. After scoring two in the first, the SaberCats (10-5-1, 5-3) were held to two runs in the second thanks to an inning-ending double play turned by shortstop Jessi Case and second baseman Macey King. \n\"That was just a play that brought everybody up,\" said Case, who snagged line drives on consecutive plays to squash a potential Fossil Ridge threat in the fourth. \"That was probably one of our most stressful games if you think about it. We beat them, we can (win the league) now. We just need three more.\" \nAlthough she wasn't at her best because of a sore wrist, Lukkes still earned her 11th win of the season by scattering 10 hits and striking out three in a six-inning complete-game effort. \nLukkes was also effective at the plate as one of three Indians with two hits, a feat matched by Rembao and Morby. \nSean Star: 970-669-5050, sstar@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/seanvstar \nIndians 8, SaberCats 5 \nFossil Ridge 220 010 0 — 5 10 1 \nLoveland 200 051 x — 8 10 0 \nW — Abby Lukkes.
