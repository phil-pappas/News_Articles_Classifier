Justin Davis capped a nine-play, 88-yard drive with a 9-yard touchdown carry to give the Trojans a 7-0 lead with 7:59 left in the first quarter. Unfazed by the drive, Utah answered with an 83-yard drive ending with a 30-yard touchdown pass from Travis Wilson to Britain Covey to tie the game 7-7 nearly four minutes later.\nUtah then took the lead after Bubba Poole stepped in on a 2-yard touchdown run with 1:49 left in the quarter. Covey's electrifying 40-yard punt return on the previous play set up the touchdown. Covey broke several tackles and made other defenders miss on his way to the USC 2-yard line.\nUtah's lead, however, wouldn't last long. USC's Cameron Smith jumped in front of a Wilson pass and returned it 41 yards to the Utah 4-yard line. The Trojans eventually capitalized with a 1-yard touchdown carry by Soma Vainuku on fourth down (some fans believe he may not have crossed the goal line) to tie the game 14-14 with 9:47 left in the first half. USC captured the lead for good six minutes later when Ronald Jones burst up the middle for an 18-yard touchdown carry, giving USC a 21-14 advantage.\nThe Trojans extended the lead to 28-14 just before the half when Smith jumped in front of a Wilson fourth-down pass and returned it 56 yards for a touchdown.\nUtah quickly marched down the field, and Andy Phillips kicked a career-long 53-yard field goal to cut USC's lead to 28-17 at the half.\nNeither team scored until Cody Kessler punched in a 1-yard touchdown on fourth down with 3:37 left in the third quarter, pushing USC's lead to 35-17. The Trojans padded the lead in the fourth quarter when Kessler connected with JuJu Smith-Schuster on a 34-yard touchdown pass.\nUtah cut the lead to 42-24 on a 66-yard catch and run by Covey with four minutes left in the game, but by the then the game had been decided.\nUtah's three stars: \nBritain Covey, WR/PR \nWith a career-high 129 yards receiving and a career-high 217 all-purpose yards, Covey either scored or set up all three of Utah's touchdowns. He caught a 30-yard pass to give Utah its first points of the game in the first quarter. His 40-yard punt return later in the quarter set up Poole's 2-yard touchdown run on the very next play. In the fourth quarter, he sped past the Trojan secondary on his way to a 66-yard touchdown catch and run. Within those big plays, he reminded the spectators that he still is one of the most electrifying players in the country.\nGionni Paul, LB \nIt's a shame Paul's stat line, which mirrors something that can only be achieved in a video game, will go mostly unnoticed because of the loss. The senior picked up a career-high 17 tackles, including 11 solo tackles, 5.5 tackles for loss, a sack and a forced fumble. In one drive in particular, Paul finished with three tackles for loss.\nJason Whittingham, LB \nContinuing on that theme, Paul and Whittingham picked up the slack nicely with Jared Norris out with an injury. Whittingham tied safety Marcus Williams with second-most tackles with nine, including a 1/2 sack and 2.5 tackles for loss.\nAnalyzing the stats \n— USC won the turnover battle 4-0, resulting in the Trojans outscoring Utah 14-0 (those two scores coming on the game-tying touchdown and Smith's interception for a touchdown to make it a 28-14 game). Utah entered the game with multiple turnovers in each of its six games this season, but the Utes were held without a forced turnover for the first time since Aug. 28, 2014, against Idaho State. Meanwhile, Smith's 56-yard interception for a touchdown was Utah's first pick-6 allowed since a loss to Arizona Nov. 22, 2014.\n— Booker was held to just 62 yards on 14 carries in the loss, as well as 49 yards receiving on six catches. He entered the game with 21 or more carries in Utah's six games leading into Saturday. It's the fewest amount of carries Booker has attempted since Sept. 20, 2014, at Michigan, which was his final game before taking over as the team's primary running back.\n— In addition, Utah ran for less than 100 yards as a team for the second straight week. The Utes averaged 85.5 yards per game in that span. They also averaged 269 yards rushing over the first two games in conference action.\n— Utah compiled 14 tackles for loss, which ups its total to 31 in four conference games, and 25 of those 31 have come in the last two weeks.\n— USC controlled time of possession 34:50-25:10, including possessing the ball nearly two-thirds of the time in the second half. Utah entered the game possessing the ball roughly 56.6 percent of the time this season and had only possessed the ball less than 50 percent one other time (29:19, against Michigan).\nA brief look at what's to come: Despite the No. 3 ranking, Utah was the underdog on the road at USC, according to Las Vegas lines, but the Utes should be favored easily against Oregon State (2-5, 0-4) this Saturday. The Beavers are in the midst of a four-game skid, including a 17-13 loss at home to Colorado Saturday. However, there is no shortage of familiar faces on the Oregon State sideline, which should lead to an interesting subplot leading up to the game. The Beavers are coached by former Utah State head coach and Utah defensive coordinator Gary Andersen, and Kalani Sitake, the team's defensive coordinator, came over from the Utes during the offseason. Offensive coordinator Dave Baldwin also spent time at USU.\nIn addition to adjusting to a new coaching staff, the Beavers are among one of the youngest teams in the country. True freshman Seth Collins has gained control as the quarterback. Collins has completed 52 percent of his passes this season in seven starts, passing for 890 yards and six touchdowns with four interceptions. He also leads the team with 613 yards rushing on 99 attempts (76.6 yards per game; 5.4 yards per carry) and five touchdowns. Senior tailback Storm Barrs-Woods is next in line with 50.3 rushing yards per game and another touchdown. Jordan Villamin leads the team's receivers with 26 catches, 380 yards and four touchdowns.\nJunior linebacker Rommel Mageo leads the defense in tackles (55), sacks (2) and interceptions (2).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:22:33.504+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
