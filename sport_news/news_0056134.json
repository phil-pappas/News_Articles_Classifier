IU will partake in the NCAA and U.S. Department of Defense's $30 million effort, titled the Concussion Assessment, Research and Education Consortium, to minimize the impact of sports-related concussions.2. IU will contribute to the effort as a performance site and will work in collaboration with the University of Michigan and the Medical College of Wisconsin.3. The organizations involved in the effort are working to better understand concussions and their short- and long-term effect of the brain. Through the effort, they hope to discover enhanced treatment and recovery methods.4. The consortium will also create education programs aimed at changing the way concussions are reported and managed.5. IU's Andy S.
