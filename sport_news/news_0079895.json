His personal acronym for “GOAL,” which is also his mantra, reads, “Guiding outstanding accomplishments in life.” It may sound simple, but the methodical approach has led Ramsay to some impressive accomplishments. This Saturday, the Norwell resident will participate in the World Iron Man Championships in Kona, Hawaii. The grueling race includes a 2.5-mile swim, a 112-mile bike course and a full 26.2-mile marathon after that. It will be Ramsay’s ninth Iron Man contest. In order to qualify, he had to compete in an earlier race in Chattanooga. His time of 9 hours 53 minutes there was enough to earn him 1st place in his age bracket of 50-54 years old. “It was really just a progression of goals,” Ramsay said of his fitness obsession. “At first, I thought it was cool and wanted to see if I could get one under my belt, that’d be an achievement. Then it was cracking the top 50, and so on.” He ran a marathon with his wife, Cindy, in 2004 and ran his first Iron Man in 2006. And despite the impressive feat, he maintains he’s nothing special. “I don’t like when people say, ‘wow, that’s awesome, I could never do that,’” he said. “Because, honestly, they can do it. It’s just a question of if you actually want it.” That’s where the methodical goal-setting comes in, a way of life that has led Ramsay to campaign others to do the same. As a financial advisor and business owner, he advocates the approach to his clients. As a father, he’s tried to pass it onto his children. “You don’t have to be the best or 1st place,” he said. “I certainly won’t be here (in Hawaii). It’s just about engaging.” For him, that’s the best part. Ramsay said he is trying to get as many people as possible engaged with their goals. The races, and all their benefits, are just extra. “This is really fun stuff. I never thought I’d be waking up at my age this energized,” Ramsay said. “And for my two sons to watch me do it, that’s a wonderful byproduct. I guess you can say it was a healthy mid-life crisis.” Dylan McGuinness may be reached at dmcguinness@ledger.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:57:20.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
