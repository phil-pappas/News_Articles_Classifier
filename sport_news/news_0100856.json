By Jeff Deters jeff.deters@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The postseason can often have a way of turning a player’s longtime struggles into success, taking the ordinary into extraordinary. \nThat was the case last year with Kansas City third baseman Mike Moustakas. After struggling greatly for much of his career, the left-handed hitter took his game to another level during last year’s run to the World Series. \nMoustakas then followed that up with the best season of his career, hitting .284 with 22 home runs and 82 RBIs to go with a .348 on-base percentage. Moustakas, though, is still looking for his first hit in the American League Division Series against Houston. He is 0 for 6 with a walk through the first two games, but he’ll get an opportunity to end that mini slump when the Royals take on the Astros in Game 3 of the ALDS at 3:10 p.m. Sunday in Houston. \n“I’m really just trying to focus on getting on base and let these other guys drive me in,” Moustakas said. “That’s kind of what I went back to doing at the beginning of the year, getting my hands ready to hit and just using that. Get rid of all the moving parts and just use my hands, which is my strength and what I use really well.” \nKansas City right-hander Edinson Volquez, who went 13-9 with a 3.55 ERA in the regular season, will face Houston left-hander Dallas Keuchel. Keuchel went 20-8 with a 2.48 ERA. \nMoustakas and the Royals have faced Keuchel twice this season, losing at Minute Maid Park and winning at Kauffman Stadium. Keuchel, who started this year’s All-Star Game and could be the league’s Cy Young winner, went 15-0 at home during the regular season. The Royals, though, beat Keuchel 5-1 in late July. Moustakas, however, didn’t play as he got the day off. \nMoustakas hit just .188 in July, and at the time he also was dealing with a family matter. His mother was ill and she later died in August. \n“Baseball’s baseball,” Moustakas said. “You’re not going to go out there and have a phenomenal month every month. There’s going to be times where you go through ups and downs. And I was dealing with some stuff with my family. \n“That’s not an excuse. I came to work every day ready to play and I just didn’t get the job done at the time. But I was able to get in the cage and work through that and find a way to finish strong.” \nRoyals right-hander Chris Young also has been dealing with the loss of a loved one. His father passed away two weeks ago. Just hours after learning of his father’s death, Young threw five innings of no-hit baseball in the Royals’ regular-season home finale. \nYoung then followed up by pitching 61/3 solid innings in his final start of the regular season. \nIn Game 1 of the ALDS, Young threw four innings of one-run ball as a long reliever. \n“I have a job to do,” Young said. “Life goes on. It’s certainly been tough, but these guys have been here for me, and I’m trying to do the same for them.” \nThe Royals found themselves in a difficult spot after Thursday's loss in Game 1. Things also looked grim for a couple hours during Game 2 when they were trailing on the scoreboard and looking at a possible 0-2 deficit. \nBut they rallied back and evened the series, showing some of the character that helped them earn the best record in the AL. They’ll probably need more of that to get past the Astros and advance to the ALCS. \nTwo more wins and they’ll be there. Two more losses and their season will be over. But a message was sent Friday: Houston, we have a series. \n“Nobody said this was going to be easy,” Young said. “But this is a resilient team.” ALDS: GAME 3 \nMatchup : Kansas City Royals vs. Houston Astros \nWhen/Where : 3:10 p.m. Sunday, Minute Maid Park, Houston \nPitching matchup : Kansas City: RHP Edinson Volquez (13-9, 3.55 ERA), Houston: LHP Dallas Keuchel (20-8, 2.48 ERA) \nTV/Radio : MLB Network, WIBW-AM (580) \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:53:30.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
