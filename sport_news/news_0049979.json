Sevilla is third on three points.\nIt looked like being another disappointing Champions League night at home for City, who had previously won only three of nine games under manager Manuel Pellegrini at the Etihad in Europe's top competition since 2013.\nBut De Bruyne rescued victory, repaying another chunk of the 55 million pounds ($85 million) fee City paid to Wolfsburg for his services this summer. He has now scored five goals in nine games for City.\nKonoplyanka had already struck the post with a free kick from an acute angle by the time he gave Sevilla the lead. The ball ricocheted kindly into the path of Vitolo, and the midfielder cut back a cross from the right that Konoplyanka met with a first-time shot past goalkeeper Joe Hart, who was unsighted by Kevin Gameiro in front of him.\nWilfried Bony is filling in for injured striker Sergio Aguero and scored twice at the weekend in a 5-1 win against Bournemouth in the Premier League. He was celebrating scoring City's equalizer here, too, although it will go down as an own goal by Rami.\nToure beat his marker on the byline and drove over a cross toward Raheem Sterling, whose shot was parried out by goalkeeper Sergio Rico. Bony stuck out his foot and the ball hit Rami's knee before rebounding into the net.\nThe second half was tighter, although Sevilla looked more likely to score and Gameiro will rue the chance he missed in the 69th minute when he failed to turn the ball into an empty net. Gameiro also missed a superb chance late in the first half.\nWhen Bony was substituted in the 76th minute, De Bruyne was the surprise choice to play up front. Pellegrini's decision paid off big time.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:39:01.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
