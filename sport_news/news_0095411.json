Don Mattingly FILE - In this July 17, 2015, file photo, reporters are reflected in the glasses of Los Angeles Dodgers manager Don Mattingly as he pauses while speaking in the dugout before a baseball game against the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park in Washington. A person familiar with the decision tells The Associated Press that Don Mattingly is out as manager of the Dodgers. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity Thursday, Oct. 22, 2015, because the team has not announced his departure.
