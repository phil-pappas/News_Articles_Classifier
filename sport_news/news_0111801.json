PHILADELPHIA – The Giants looked like the best team in the NFC East for the first 10 minutes of Monday night’s 27-7 loss to the Eagles.\nProblem is they played like the worst for the rest of the game.\nThe Giants were in position to make a statement about how far they have come this season, and consider the statement made: they’re not good enough to contend, not if they play the way they did as their three-game winning streak was halted at Lincoln Financial Field.\nNow the Giants (3-3) and Eagles (3-3) are together atop the standings with the Cowboys (2-3) set to arrive at MetLife Stadium Sunday fresh off their bye seeking a season sweep of Big Blue, only this time without Tony Romo and likely Dez Bryant as well.\nIf Giants fans only watched the first 9:42 of the first quarter, they might have been making playoff plans.\nEli Manning hooked up with Odell Beckham Jr. to cap their best offensive drive of the season with a touchdown. The defense smothered the Eagles on their opening drive.\nThen Manning took over again, marching down the field with relative ease as the Giants seemed poised to add to their lead.\nThe team that entered alone in first place had all the momentum.\nAnd just like that, it was gone.\nA Manning pass to Larry Donnell went in and out of his hands, resulting in an interception by Eagles linebacker DeMeco Ryans.\nThe defense forced another three-and-out, only to have Damontre Moore spike Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford into the ground for a roughing-the-passer penalty.\nThat set up the Eagles’ first touchdown, and their second came when Manning was picked off by Nolan Carroll, who raced 17 yards for a touchdown with 12:26 left in the 2nd quarter.\nSuddenly, the Giants found themselves in a 14-7 hole and they never recovered.\nThe Giants essentially made the Eagles earn three points.\nStill, Philadelphia scored 27.\nThe Eagles turned the ball over four times, including three interceptions by Bradford, who was shaky at best.\nThe Giants scored zero points off those gifts.\nThe Giants’ offensive line was manhandled seemingly on every series after Manning’s second interception. Manning had been sacked four times all season entering the game, but he was under constant duress from midway through the first quarter through the remainder of the game.\nEven when the Giants had a chance to fight back, they couldn’t get out of their own way.\nLast season, the Giants brought a three-game winning streak to Philadelphia and were embarrassed on national television. Adding injury to insult was the devastating injury suffered by Victor Cruz, who has yet to play this season as he still recovers from a strained calf that derailed his comeback in August.\nThe Giants were alone in first place for the first time since the 2012 season, but the Eagles entered coming off their best offensive performance of the year in a thrashing of the Saints.\nThis game was not as one-sided as their last trip to the City of Brotherly Love, but it sure felt that way for much of the night.\nThings started off very well for the Giants, who were flawless on the game’s opening drive. They marched 80 yards in eight plays and cashed in when Manning hit Beckham from 13 yards out for their fourth scoring connection of the year. It was Beckham’s 10th touchdown reception in eight career division games.\nManning completed all five of his passes on the possession, including strikes of 5 and 17 yards to rookie tight end Will Tye. A 16-yard catch by Donnell and an Eagles penalty set up Beckham, who slid inside the 5 to haul in Manning’s pass and was able to crawl the rest of the way into the end zone.\nBeckham started the game despite being listed as questionable coming in with a hamstring issue.\nBEATTY ELIGIBLE TO COME OFF PUP: OL Will Beatty has been on the physically unable to perform list since the start of training camp following surgery to repair a torn pectoral muscle he sustained in the weight room in the spring.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:22:24.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
