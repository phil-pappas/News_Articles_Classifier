Yes, I thought Indian River was going to end Oscar Smith's 78-game Southeastern District winning streak.\nAnd with less than five minutes left in the game Saturday, my prediction looked really good. Many Oscar Smith fans must have believed the same, as they headed to the exits.\nBut those diehard Tigers fans who stayed enjoyed one of the most remarkable endings as the Tigers scored 13 points in the final 3:24 to win 15-14 and extend the streak another week.\nBut here's why I chose the Braves, and it had nothing to do with disrespecting Oscar Smith's legacy.\nAfter watching Oscar Smith in the preseason and judging by the opening weeks of the regular season, it was obvious this is not like the Oscar Smith teams we've seen in the past.\nOscar Smith always had a marquee player - sometimes more than one. Players such as J.C. Coleman, Perry Jones, Josh Sweat, Andrew Brown, Phillip Sims and Tim Smith.\nI wasn't the only one who thought about it. Even some longtime Oscar Smith supporters quietly agreed with me before the start of Saturday's game.\nBut Oscar Smith coach Richard Morgan said rebuilding is nothing new to him.\n\"When a guy leaves to go to college, another guy who has been waiting in the wings takes over that spot and tries to do even better,\" he said earlier this week. \"This has been going on for over a decade, so this is really nothing new at all. It's just a credit to the program that we're able to maintain the success with our guys throughout the years. It's no different this year than it's been in the past.\"\nMorgan also proved that he doesn't need stars to win games. He just needs players who are willing to believe in the Tiger tradition.\n\"Individuals don't win games, teams do,\" he said after the victory. \"Championships aren't won by stars. Championships are won by teams and they proved that today. I don't care about how many scholarship offers are on our side or on the other side. We did what we had to do as a team and that's all that matters.\"\nMorgan went on to talk about the players who came up big for the Tigers on Saturday. None of them is a household name.\nTake junior strong safety Jahmeek Jones. He blocked the punt in the first quarter that helped give Oscar Smith the early 2-0 lead.\nAnd during the fourth-quarter comeback, the Tigers did it with players who are unfamiliar to most people outside of the Oscar Smith program.\n\"A sophomore threw the touchdown pass and a sophomore ran the punt in for a touchdown,\" Morgan said about Shy'keem Hussey and Deangelo White, respectively. \"People were saying, Who is Deangelo White and he's just a sophomore and he can't play? No, he can play. Everybody said we were too young to do anything but football is a team game.\"\nTim Smith, a former star receiver and now an assistant coach for Oscar Smith, was all smiles after the game. But he and the rest of the coaching staff were definitely worried late when everyone else had counted them out and thought the streak was over.\nIncluding me.\n\"It's amazing,\" Smith said about the comeback and the streak. \"To be alumni who help started it and seeing it keep going, it's beautiful.\"\nLarry Rubama, 757-446-2273,larry.rubama@pilotonline.com,\nTwitter: @LHRubama\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
