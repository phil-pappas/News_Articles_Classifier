(Michael Laughlin / Sun Sentinel) Gary Curreri Correspondent Week 8: Hallandale slogs through downpour to take non-district win out of Miramar \nThe Patriots put up a valiant effort on Friday night, but it wasn't enough as Miramar fell at home 7-0 in a rain-soaked contest against Hallandale. \nMiramar coach Pierre Senatus and defensive coordinator A.J. Scott were coming off a one-game suspension in the aftermath of a 31-6 loss to Flanagan that featured three ejections and more than 500 yards in penalties. The two sat out the team's 42-0 victory over Cypress Bay. \n\"We talked about closing the noise period, even with ourselves, we create our own noise sometimes,\" Senatus said. \"We have to focus and we worked on the tasks at hand and cancelled out the community, cancelled out the parents and the twitter and the social media and just focus on the programs benefiting Miramar. \n\"Sitting out was very hard,\" Senatus said, \"but we have a great staff and great administrative support. Tough situations sometimes show the resiliency and how tough they really are.\" \nThe district has shifted its nearly year-long investigation of Miramar into high gear. \nBroward Schools began looking into possible widespread violations and criminal wrongdoing last November, after ousted coach Matt Strout made allegations related to Miramar's football team, including academic fraud and payoffs to players, parents and teachers \nMiramar principal Maria Formoso declined to comment before the game on possible looming sanctions or last week's suspensions of Senatus and Scott. \nHallandale (6-1) got the only score of the game with 2:02 remaining in the third quarter when Tyler Huntley found Chris Cotto for a 33-yard TD toss. The score capped a two-play drive that started on the Miramar 43 following a punt from deep in Patriots territory. \nHallandale entered the game averaging 39.5 points, but the sloppy conditions led to the teams combining for seven turnovers. Miramar had two good scoring opportunities, but D'Angelo Fulford was intercepted in the end zone by Cincinnati commit Romelo Webster with 7:26 remaining in the game. Fulford was trying to squeeze a ball in to junior WR Kyle Anthony from the Chargers' 13-yard line. \nThe teams traded fumbles and after a Chargers sent the ball to the Miramar 13 and the Patriots (3-5) mounted their final drive that ended 12 plays later when Gergori McCrea fumbled and Hallandale's Dante Adams recovered with 48 seconds remaining and the Chargers ran out the clock. \n\"We just wanted to get the 'W' and stay away from injuries,\" said Hallandale coach Dameon Jones. \"We have been tested all year. It's just a regular game. We wanted them to come out and play hard.\" \nThe start of the game was delayed 30 minutes due to lightning and the second quarter was played in a downpour. By the start of the second half, both sideline areas were under water and a steady rain continued to fall throughout the game, rendering the field almost unplayable. \nThe Chargers evened the series between the two schools at 2-2. Hallandale pulled out a 30-28 win over the Patriots in 2010, while Miramar won 40-0 in 2009 and 30-7 last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:21:04.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
