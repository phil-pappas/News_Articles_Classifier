All because Jose Bautista flipped his bat higher than some pop-ups and farther than some bunts after delivering a clutch homer to power Toronto into the ALCS. \nThe Blue Jays arrived at Kauffman Stadium for a late-afternoon workout Thursday before they begin a best-of-seven series with the reigning AL champs, the Kansas City Royals, on Friday. \nBefore they made it town, and before the Royals began their own workout, KC manager Ned Yost was asked about how he conditions his team to the standards of baseball conduct. \n“For me, I’ve had the advantage of having these kids from Day 1 in the big leagues and teaching them how to respect the game,” Yost said, “and how to use your emotions and not get too crazy with it. But it is an emotional game, and the stakes are really, really high. ... You kind of like to see emotion, but you like to see it in a respectful way.” \nSomeone forgot to cue Aretha Franklin, but the respect theme was firmly established. \nYet in this instance, the framework for discussion includes more than the JoeyBats flip against Texas. \nBad blood erupted the last time the Royals and Jays met, in Toronto. In an Aug. 2 matchup that ended in a 5-2 loss for the Royals, as well as a 3-1 advantage in the series for the Blue Jays, pitches were thrown inside. Too far, actually, beginning in the first inning when Royals starter Edinson Volquez hit Josh Donaldson. \nBefore it was over, benches emptied, Toronto manager John Gibbons was ejected along with reliever Aaron Sanchez, three batters were beaned and Twitter exploded with objections and apologies. \nOf KC’s pitches in that game, “some were inside, some were really inside,” Gibbons recalled. \nWelcome, Blue Jays, to Kansas City. \nVolquez happens to be starting for the Royals on Friday in Game 1. Asked how he will pitch the Blue Jays slugger, Volquez drew laughs: “I got to stick to my plan. I don’t know what the plan is right now, but I’ve got to stick to it.” \nYost confirmed that will involve pitching inside to the Jays, though he did not expect bad blood to boil again. \n“I’m not a mind-reader. I’m not a fortune teller. I don’t know if it’s going to be an issue,” said Yost, “but we’re going to pitch inside aggressively. That’s a power-laden club. We’re going to formulate a really good game plan and try to execute it.” \nSuch execution can cross a line — literally, in fact, if judging by the inside chalk of the batter’s box. \nThis is particularly relevant to the Jays, who seem to take exception to getting challenged inside at the plate. \n“Kinda like the bat flip, guys react differently these days to the ball being inside,” Gibbons said. \nLocate a pitch poorly, however, and Toronto can capitalize with a lineup that led the majors in homers. That last series with Kansas City happened to coincide with the Blue Jays’ acquisition of two key players, pitcher David Price and shortstop Troy Tulowitzki. \nThose All-Star additions were enough to make any team rejoice, helping Toronto gain control of the AL East before rallying from two games down to beat the Rangers in the ALDS. \nThe clinching blow in that series by Bautista included a showman’s glare at the ball he bashed before anyone clocked hang time on his bat. \nWith every move caught on camera, everything transmitted on social media, and much of it publicized in many forms, such emotional outbursts are more celebrated anymore. \n“Certainly stuff is OK that wasn’t years ago, and it’s part of a new era now,” Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer said. \nWhile maintaining he does not endorse anything inflammatory, Gibbons realizes emotional outbursts are increasingly part of his game, if not society. \n“You can look at all professional sports in general and everybody celebrates, more so than they used to,” Gibbons said. “In our particular sport, and a guy gets a big hit, nobody on your side minds it. If you’re on the other side, nobody likes you. ... It’s part of it, but I don’t think we need to focus on it.” \nJust like any focus on the last matchup potentially takes away from proper preparation. \nAt least until a flare-up materializes in this ALCS, which seems highly probable. Then, memories will be rekindled. Emotions will fly. \nBats, too, if what the nation — well, much of North America — noticed out of Bautista is any indication. \nKevin Haskin can be reached at (785) 295-1159 or kevin.haskin@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:03:40.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
