Unfortunately it's changed the plans that we laid down for the outfielder but we'll continue what we've been doing the last couple of days and see where Rusney is [Thursday]. But he is improving, but not quite there.\" With Castillo out, Brock Holt got another start in right field, with Jackie Bradley, Jr. playing in left. It will be worth watching whether the Red Sox move Bradley back to center or keep Mookie Betts there if and when Castillo returns this season. Additionally, Lovullo said that it's unlikely Pablo Sandoval will be with the club this weekend in Cleveland. The third baseman, who has already been ruled out of playing again this season, has been dealing with pneumonia back in Boston.
