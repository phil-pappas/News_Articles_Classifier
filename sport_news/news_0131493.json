Last season, in his rookie year, Smith played a total of 77 snaps, and never saw more than 18 in a single game. \nIt might not be a coincidence that in the longest action of his career, Smith also had his best game, registering his first career tackle (ok, an assist on a tackle) and twice getting in the face of Saints quarterback Drew Brees. \nSmith also helped create a turnover with the Eagles up 32-10 and just under four minutes remaining in the game. \n\"On Walter's interception yesterday, (Smith) used a one-armed bull rush, kind of pushed the offensive linemen back into Drew's face,\" Kelly said, \"and Drew couldn't follow through on the throw.\" \nSmith's strong showing comes at an ideal time for the Eagles, who are thin at outside linebacker and have struggled to generate a pass rush this season. \nThe game from Smith certainly won't erase the label he as been given of bust, but it does perhaps make the argument the label has been unfairly given. BRADFORD: Report card from win over Saints \nThere is a reason Smith hasn't been playing, and plenty of it has to do with what he shows the coaches in practice. Officially labeling a player a bust after just 77 snaps, however, is premature, and Smith's strong showing in his first real, extended action in the NFL is exactly why. \nStill, it is going to take a lot more than 22 snaps to start working his way back into the good graces of Eagles fans and his head coach. \nAlthough for the first time in his career, it seems Smith might have finally taken the first step in doing so. \n\"Overall,\" Kelly said, \"he has shown improvement. THE NO-HUDDLE SHOW, Ep. 11: Finally, a glimpse of what Eagles fans expected \nThere were plenty of encouraging signs in the Eagles' blowout win over the Saints. From Fletcher Cox's dominance to Josh Huff's emergence, the Eagles showed what they're capable of doing. Now the question is: Can they do it again vs. the Giants?
