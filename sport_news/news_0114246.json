J. Ofodile was all about giving credit where it was due. \n“They had a little bit of a feel of a team of destiny with how they’re playing right now,” Ofodile said of the 9-1 Jays. \nOfodile said Jefferson City was probably the hottest team in the state with the exception of C.B.C. headed into the playoffs. \n“We felt like we had a puncher’s chance in it. But you know, in the end, the better team won,” Ofodile said. \nThe Jays have reeled off eight in a row since falling in Week 2 to C.B.C. (10-0). \nFriday night was the start of district play, and the Jays were ready. \nA Denzel Wilson first-quarter touchdown and a near flawless second quarter was enough for the third-seeded Jays to hang on and advance to a district semifinal contest with No. 2 Blue Springs South, which handled No. 7 Troy Buchanan 56-0. \nIn the second quarter, the Jays found the end zone three times and added a J.T. Bohlken 32-yard field goal, set up by one of Gavin Strobel’s two interceptions. This one, he ran for 65 yards to put Bohlken in range with slightly more than three seconds to play in the half. \n“That was a big turning point for us,” Jefferson City head coach Ted LePage said. “(Bohlken’s) kick put us up by three scores there.” \nMaybe the biggest play came when Rock Bridge may have gotten a little greedy. \nAfter Bruins quarterback Trevor Twehous connected with Hayden Johnson for a 22-yard touchdown to tie the game at 7 early in the second quarter, the visitors decided to kick it to the Jays’ return team. \nThat decision backfired. \nDennis Barnes took the kick back 97 yards for a touchdown to regain the Jays’ lead. \nOfodile described the decision of giving the Jays a chance to return as “playing with fire.” \n“We thought we had schemed up something good, thought we kind of had them pegged on what they were going to do,” he said. “They did what we thought they were going to do and did it a whole lot better. They did it great on film, too. But we thought we were going to be able to cheat it a little bit, and we paid the price. So we didn’t fool with that anymore.” \nLePage wasn’t upset Rock Bridge kicked into his team’s strength. \n“I didn’t anticipate them kicking to us after last week. But they kicked it to us, and we’ll take it every time,” he said. “Then they started doing what we anticipated they would do. Our kicking game again there came up huge.” \nJays quarterback Gunnar See threw back-to-back touchdown passes to wide receiver Daniel Ellinger and tight end Allan Roettgen, and Bohlken knocked through the 32-yarder before the Bruins threatened again. \nRock Bridge got back on the board when running back Nick Collins took a sweep to the right for a 65-yard touchdown with 7:23 left in the third quarter to cut the lead to 31-14. But LePage was a bit surprised to see the Bruins not go for two. \n“I was really surprised to see them kick an extra point there,” LePage said. “I thought they’d go for two, because when they kicked the extra point, that still left us up by 17 and three scores, and I was like, ‘OK, we’ll let them kick the extra point.’ Being up three scores is huge.” \nThroughout the second half, the Jays elected for a run-heavy offense and did not score. Joseph Bustamante ran for a team-high 50 yards on seven carries, 46 of which came in the second and third quarters. \n“We were trying to minimize mistakes and just run the clock in the second half,” LePage said. “We really wanted to minimize and take calculated risks. We were probably way too conservative, but in the same standpoint, this time of year, you win and move on.” \nRock Bridge committed 14 penalties for 105 yards, which Ofodile mainly took the blame for. \n“That’s a coaching deal,” Ofodile said. “That is a technique issue, that’s a coaching issue, that’s a conditioning issue, all the things fall down to having the players better prepared. That’s what it comes down to. \n“And (Jefferson City) did not make those penalties, they were more disciplined football team and I thought that was the difference in the two teams.” \nThe Jays will play second-seeded Blue Springs South in Blue Springs next Friday. Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. \nNotes: See finished 11-of-19 for 131 yards, two touchdowns and one interception, while Bruins’ sophomore QB Trevor Twehous threw 6-for-14 for 107 yards and two picks. … Strobel snagged his third and fourth interceptions on the season. … Collins finished the night with 107 yards rushing on 12 carries. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:11:03.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
