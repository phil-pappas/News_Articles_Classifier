D\nBusacca is an outside back on a Highlands defense that has allowed just two goals in its first 14 games. But opposing defenses have to account for her, as evidenced by her five goals and eight assists this season.\nSophia Gulati, Immaculate Heart, sr. M\nGulati remains one of the most important pieces to IHA's Bergen County and state title hopes. And the goals are starting to come, too: She has provided the game-winner in IHA's past two Bergen tournament wins.\nAbby Adams, Ramapo, sr. D\nAs good a back as there is in New Jersey, Adams continues to shine on the Green Raiders' dominant defense. Ramapo had posted 11 straight shutouts and 13 in 15 games entering Tuesday. \nMikaela Heyboer, Park Ridge, sr. F\nHeyboer headlines a strong Owls attack and has Park Ridge eyeing sectional and state titles. She is closing in on 100 goals (93) after posting 19 goals (and seven assists) during the Owls' 13-0-2 start.\nMeaghan Mancini, Clifton, soph. M/F\nWith 17 goals and seven assists for the undefeated Mustangs, Mancini has blown past her freshman totals (11 goals, three assists). She provided an additional goal in Clifton's 4-2 shootout win over Lakeland in Saturday's Passaic semifinal.\nâ€” JJ Conrad", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:41:33.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
