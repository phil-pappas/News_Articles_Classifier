(Gary Hershorn/Associated Press) \nThe Redskins trotted out an offensive line with just a combined 14 previous starts against the New York Jets, who have one of the most talented defensive lines in the NFL. The fairly young and inexperienced unit was surprisingly impressive in some areas but struggled to establish the offense’s identity in the 34-20 loss on Sunday. \nWashington rushed for just 34 yards on 17 carries without left tackle Trent Williams and center Kory Litchensteiger. Williams dealt with concussion-like symptoms while Litchensteiger suffered shoulder, finger and neck injuries. The Redskins rarely ran toward the left side of their offensive line, where Ty Nsekhe received his first career start in Williams’ absence. \n“When you only run the ball for 20-something yards, obviously the standard is not that low,” Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said. “We obviously set the standards high. We didn’t do a good enough job in the running game getting lanes for our backs.” \nThe Redskins offense was one-dimensional as a result, relying on the pass game and quarterback Kirk Cousins. The line fared well in pass protection, however. Josh LeRiebus received his first career start at center, dealing with the added responsibility of adjusting protections and snapping the ball cleanly to Cousins. The snaps were shaky at times, but the offensive line gave Cousins a clean pocket for most of the game against an aggressive Jets defense. New York recorded five quarterback hits but just one sack. \n“We felt good about it,” LeRiebus said. “We’ve got [offensive line coach Bill] Callahan, and he’s got us prepared every week. I couldn’t ask for a better coach. We knew the game plan. They gave us what we thought we were going to get, and we just got after them. \n“Everybody across the line was communicating. It wasn’t anything crazy. Callahan has a very detailed game plan, just the way that he does everything, that it played out.” sports Success! Check your inbox for details.
