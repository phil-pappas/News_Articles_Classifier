As noted by 9News , a perimeter was set up in the area near Ken Caryl Middle School on Thursday, October 15, in an effort to nab Zuchowski, who was thought to be nearby.\nThe search was called off at around 8 p.m. that evening, after which the alert to the public went out.\nThen, just shy of midnight on the 16th, the JCSO tweeted that Zuchowski had been taken into custody. \"Details will be released when they are available,\" the sheriff's office notes.\nIn the meantime, here's a look at Zuchowski's booking photo.
