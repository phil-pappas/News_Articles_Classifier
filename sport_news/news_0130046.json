Erika Schultz of The Seattle Times Erika Schultz of The Seattle Times Print this article Advertisement The Klickitat River in South-Central Washington, a tributary of the Columbia River, is one of the few places in Washington where Yakama tribal members still fish for salmon with dip nets on platforms. Photo Gallery Yakamas fishing The river has been a gathering place for Native American fishermen for thousands of years. The tradition, which includes fishermen fashioning their poles and scaffolding, has been passed down from generation to generation. “It’s a feeling like no other,” said James Kiona, Yakama fish monitor and elder. “It’s like catching your first fish that you ever caught. That feeling comes to you all the time. It doesn’t dissipate. … It’s part of our heritage.” The Yakama fishermen harvest salmon for commercial and subsistence purposes. They take the fish home for their families to be dried, canned or smoked, or used in ceremonies. The fall chinook run extends through October, then transitions to coho until December. Joe Hymer, Washington State Fish and Wildlife biologist in Vancouver, said the Klickitat has seen some strong returns in recent years, primarily of hatchery-bound chinook salmon. Shane Keep, fisheries biologist with Yakama Nation Fisheries, said the fall chinook run totaled 80,000 to 100,000 in 2013 and 40,000 to 80,000 last year.
