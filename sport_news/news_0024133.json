In 2011 the game was not held due to extenuating circumstances as GVHS merged with neighboring Rockland District High School to form Oceanside High School. In 2013, Mitchell said not enough interested was generated to hold the event. \nThose games essentially were GVHS alumni contests. \nThe Mitchell games are held in honor of Marion's son, Nathan Mitchell, who died at age 15 in 2002 after a battle with brain cancer. Marion would give one or two college scholarships each year to GVHS students, and in recent years, OHS students. \nThe Stinson games have been held at RDHS — now Oceanside High School East — since 1993. The event ran for 21 years before last December it was announced that the game would not continue. \nThose games essentially were RDHS alumni contests. \nThe Stinson games are held in honor of William “Billy” Stinson, a three-sport athlete at Rockland who died in a drunk driving accident. Stinson's parents set up a memorial scholarship in his name and money was given to RDHS graduates, and in recent years, OHS students, to aid in their secondary education. \nNow, there appears to be strength in numbers as likely the two events, and men's and women's games, will combine. \nMitchell reached out to Mary Stinson, the mother of Billy Stinson, and the two agreed it would be a good idea to combine the games. \nMitchell “is not sure” what the name of the newly-christened games will be, but surmised it would likely be the Nathan Mitchell/Billy Stinson Memorial Basketball Games. \nThe games will be played on Wednesday, Nov. 25 at Oceanside High School West. \n“When I first called Mrs. Stinson I told her because of our tradition I'd love to have it at Georges Valley the night before Thanksgiving,” said Mitchell. “And she said that was OK. And then when I talked to Greg Knight [the RDHS alumni liason], he was fine with that too.” \nKnight said the new spin on the two longstanding charity games would be “a breath of fresh air.” \n“I think it would be a great way for us to come together,” he said. “You know the Georges Valley and the St. George and the Rockland and the Owls Head residents all playing against each other for a good cause.” \nLysha Smith and Rachel Campbell, as they have in years past, will coordinate the men's and women's teams for Georges Valley, while Knight will coordinate the men's team for Rockland. \nKnight and Mitchell said they still are in search of a woman who would take over responsibilities for rounding up a Rockland women's team. \nRDHS graduate Tammy Barrows headed up the Stinson Games from the start to finish until stepping away from the event last year. \nMitchell added the format of the games are still in flux with many moving pieces still in play and that her hope is that the proceeds from the event will be split 50/50, allowing for separate Nathan Mitchell and Billy Stinson college scholarships to be awarded. \n“It will depend on how many people show up to play for Rockland as there are for Georges Valley,” she said. “If that's the case there might be two games, or an all-star game and an old timers' game or something like that.” \nKnight said they were “pulling 20 or 22 guys” in recent years for the Stinson games. \n“I think we should able to do that [get a men's team together] no problem,” said Knight. “And I hope some of the girls like Teel [Anderson Foster] or [Christina] 'Cookie' [Novicka Sprague] and some of them can reach out to some of the girls out there. There's a good group of younger Rockland girls that have played in the Stinson Games the last few years.” \nMitchell said she also would consider a younger alumni game featuring Oceanside High School graduates, for which there are now four graduating classes, if the interest was there. \n“We're still in the creative phase, but who knows?” \nMitchell added that whether or not Rockland can field men's and women's teams, “there is going to be a game” that night at the old GVHS. \nRockland District High School graduates interested in participating in the event should call Knight at 596-6915 or email him at knights790@gmail.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T21:58:26.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
