And a laugh, \nAmerican Pharoah is not going to be seen at the Clark at Churchill Downs on Nov. 27 or the Cigar Mile at Aqueduct on Nov. 28 or the Malibu the day after Christmas. \nThe world has one last chance to see American Pharoah before he heads off to the breeding barn. And that comes Saturday, when he headlines a deep and talented field in the $5 million Classic, the richest horse race on American soil. This is a TU+ story. Click for more information. \nIt happens at Keeneland Race Track in Lexington, Ky. Another sellout crowd will flock to the races. This time, it's the last time. \n\"We know it's coming,\" Baffert said. \"On Halloween night, the tour de Pharoah is over. It's gonna be tough. It will hit me, probably the next day. We will miss having him around, watching him train. Whenever we took him anywhere, there were always people out to watch him.\" \nAnyone who got up early on Aug. 28 and headed to Saratoga Race Course can vouch for that. Two months later, Baffert still is talking about the sight of 15,000 people stuffing themselves into the Spa to watch American Pharoah gallop around the race track at 8:45 in the morning the day before the Travers. \n\"I never thought it was possible for a horse to be so popular,\" Baffert said. \nThey don't come along often. The last horse who had such a hold on the public was the great mare Zenyatta. The day after she lost the 2010 Breeders' Cup Classic, the only loss in her 20-race career, her trainer, John Shirreffs , held court at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky. Zenyatta stood for hours in a grassy area outside her barn and posed for pictures for anyone who wanted one. \nAmerican Pharoah has had the same type of spell over the public. \n\"I told John Shirreffs that I am going to have to join the same group therapy he did after Zenyatta retired,\" Baffert said. \"I am sure I will be going through Pharoah withdrawal.\" \nOne thing that has endeared American Pharoah to so many is the colt's docile personality. Add Baffert and owner Ahmed Zayat have made the horse available to the people. At Saratoga, the Sunday after American Pharoah was upset in the Travers, American Pharoah mingled with a healthy crowd that had managed to find its way to his barn. When Baffert wanted to take him back to his stall, the horse balked. He wanted to stay out and do some more meet and greet. \nA few months earlier, at Belmont Park, Baffert brought American Pharoah out into a sunny spring morning after the horse became the first Triple Crown winner in 37 years. Baffert held the horse on a lead as American Pharoah accepted pats on his head from strangers. He posed for selfies. \nEveryone loved American Pharoah, and, as corny as it sounds, he loved them back. \n\"I live my life to dwell and enjoy the special moments, and this has been one heck of a ride,\" Zayat said from New Jersey. \"I have always made it a point not getting emotionally attached to the horses, because the good ones leave. This one, I could not do that. When he goes, it will be hard. Right now, I am just trying to enjoy every moment.\" \nThe final moment could very well be the toughest of American Pharoah's life. He has won eight of his first 10 races, the only losses coming in his first career start as a 2-year-old and the shocking upset in the Travers. \nIn the Classic, American Pharoah will be facing older horses for the first time. He'll have to contend with the likes of Whitney winner Honor Code, Jockey Club Gold Cup champ Tonalist and Suburban winner Effinex. And then there is the 5-year-old mare Beholder, who has won 15 of 20 career starts. Pharoah will also see familiar 3-year-old foes like Frosted and Keen Ice. \nThe Breeders' Cup Classic is the World Series, Super Bowl and Daytona 500 of horse racing. But this year, it also will tug at some heart strings, because it's the Pharoah farewell. \n\"There is sadness,\" said Jimmy Bell , the president of Darley America and the U.S. spokesman for Godolphin Racing, which owns Frosted. \"But we're all more grateful for a horse that came along and sort of excited everyone at all levels of the game, from the casual observer to the people who have been around horses their whole lives. It takes a very special horse to win the Triple Crown, and he is a very special horse.\" \nWin or lose the Classic, the future is set for American Pharoah. His new home will be at Coolmore's Ashford Stud, which is located in Versailles, Ky., just up the road from Lexington. That's where he goes when the Classic is done. \nBefore that, there will be one more day to cheer for the horse who has emerged as a superstar to a game that has been begging for one. \nIf the Breeders' Cup Classic were a fairy tale, American Pharoah would win. But Baffert knows nothing will be handed to him and Zayat. \n\"Everyone loves a good sports story,\" Baffert said. \"In horse racing, it seems like we have got nothing but bad press coverage the last few years. Pharoah is such a kind horse, and people fell in love with him. It was a good story.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:53:12.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
