Ask the experts! \nIn 100-plus years of Big Ten football, Ohio State has done plenty of feasting on weaker teams. But no one goes down the Buckeyes’ hatch as easily as Rutgers, the league’s yummiest snack. Leaves are awarded on a zero-to-five basis.\nOffense (4 leaves) Ohio State had to punt once. Bad. The Buckeyes lost a fumble. Terrible. And, and ... OK, so absolute perfection was elusive despite the 528 total yards. J.T. Barrett made the QB switch look like a genius move with 324 yards and five touchdowns, and Zeke Elliott — baby, he was born to run.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nDefense (4 leaves) The way Rutgers started, gaining 64 yards on its opening drive, looked like a bad omen. But the Buckeyes soon buckled down, harassing the quarterback and filling the holes even while giving up the occasional long play. It had to be a bummer to lose a shutout so late.\nSpecial teams (3 leaves) Jack Willoughby had that right leg a-swinging, knocking kickoffs deep like a golfer on the range practicing with his driver. Punter Cameron Johnston was less effective with his only punt — into the wind — but Jalin Marshall set up a TD drive with a good punt return. Quiet night.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from Dispatch Reader Rewards \nCoaching (4 leaves) It seemed curious that Urban didn’t go for the throat when OSU took possession at its 17 late in the first half with all three timeouts in hand. But maybe he wanted to get in the locker room to make some seriously effective halftime adjustments. Big number here: zero penalties.\nFun quotient (2 leaves) The Big Ten brought Rutgers into the fold to help capture the New York TV market, but this is a true off-Broadway production. The piped-in music was more appropriate for an empty after-hours electronica club. This is the birthplace of college football? It would be a snap to come up with at least two dozen better atmospheres.\nOpponent (2 leaves) Rutgers’ best play might have been sending that robed white horse onto the turf with his armored rider. The Knights showed occasional offensive competence, but their pass defense is an unmitigated disaster. No wonder fans watch these guys and say, “Rut-g .”\nOfficiating (3 leaves) All reviews were upheld once again, but this weekly gripe bears repeating: Why even have instant replay if it doesn’t show Elliott came up short on a third-and-1 run in the first quarter? Mostly, they just tried to go unnoticed.\nrstein@dispatch.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:16:17.572+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
