But it was all the things he didn't do that got him fired Monday.\nAdChoices The Nationals cut Williams loose in the wake of a disappointing 83-79 season. The firing was first reported by The Washington Post.\nThe #Nats have relieved Matt Williams and his coaching staff of their duties: pic.twitter.com/I9HP64Oar9\n— Washington Nationals (@Nationals) October 5, 2015\nMORE: Every MLB team's worst manager\nThough Williams came under fire during last year's playoffs for his handling of the Nationals' pitching staff in an NLDS loss to the eventual World Series champion Giants, few would have predicted this outcome in spring training, when Williams' team was the toast of baseball.\nAfter winning 96 games last season and adding Max Scherzer over the winter, the Nationals were prohibitive favorites to make a deep run this October. Instead, their season fell apart in the wake of injuries, ineffectiveness and — in an ugly final week — infighting.\nWilliams couldn't do much about the injuries that robbed the team of Ryan Zimmerman, Jayson Werth, Denard Span and Anthony Rendon for large chunks of the season. But his in-game tactics continued to come under fire as the situation got desperate and his interpersonal skills apparently were even worse, based on a damning Washington Post story published last week.\nEverything came to a head in the season's final days when newly acquired closer Jonathan Papelbon baited the team's best player, Bryce Harper, into a dugout fight. Williams allowed Papelbon to remain in the game after the incident, and later admitted he had no idea how serious the incident was until seeing video of it after the game.\nIf Williams' imminent departure wasn't a foregone conclusion by then, that moment surely sealed his fate.\nIt will be facinating to see if Williams, the reigning NL Manager of the Year who turns 50 in November, gets another shot at running a team. He went 179-145 in his two seasons in D.C., and his .552 winning percentage ranks third among active managers behind Mike Matheny (.579) and Joe Girardi (.558) and an impressive 34th all-time. That puts him ahead of the likes of Sparky Anderson (.545), Joe Torre (.538), Tony La Russa (.536) and Whitey Herzog (.532).
