They came off the pitch really tired,\" said Wenger. \n\"Cazorla won many balls and blocked many tackles, even Ozil.... once you have that in the team, it is not easy to get it, but is shows the belief is there and then you need enough humility to keep it in there.\" \nThe Arsenal boss added: \"You need to convince the players that you have to work hard to win football games in the Premier and that you need all 11 to do that.\" \nGabriel produced a composed display at the heart of the Gunners' rearguard, standing in for vice-captain Per Mertesacker, who was ill. \nThe Brazilian - sent off at Chelsea last month for clashing with Diego Costa - produced a superb late block to thwart a dangerous Everton counter-attack, before letting out a loud roar cheered on by the home supporters. \n\"Gabriel has shown that he is a fighter,\" said Wenger. \n\"At half-time he was so upset at the deflection he got, but in the second half he came out again with the same spirit, it is a fantastic combative aspect. \n\"He is not a talking leader, he is a fighting leader, and I think he is a typical centre-back for the Premier League.\" \nWenger has challenged his team to better what was a \"perfect week\" after the Champions League victory over Bayern Munich. \nHe said: \"I think the attitude at the top level is how can we improve,\" he said. \n\"We learn from defeat and we learn from wins - but to learn from wins sometimes is more difficult because it is less natural.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:24:50.544+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
