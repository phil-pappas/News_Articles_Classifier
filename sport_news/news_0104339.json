(KEVIN KING/Winnipeg Sun files) Article Report an error \nThis morning the Manitoba Moose will probably be happy to see the Ontario Reign pack up, head to the airport and leave Winnipeg. \nOntario, the American Hockey League affiliate of the Los Angeles Kings, plays a system identical to the one that the Kings have used to fuel two Stanley Cup championships in the past four seasons. That success extended last season to the AHL, where the Reign won the Calder Cup skating as the Manchester Monarchs before an offseason move landed them in California. \nThe Reign completed their two-game sweep of the Moose on Saturday evening, taking a 1-0 overtime win in front of 7,371 at MTS Centre. Moose forward Joel Armia’s fourth minor penalty of the game with the teams playing 3-on-3 set up Ontario forward Valentin Zykov’s game-winner with 7.5 seconds left in overtime. \nManitoba (0-2-1-1) remains in search for their first win of the season. \nOntario (3-0-0-0) continued to frustrate the Moose on Saturday. Manitoba scored once in the two games. Ontario outshot the Moose 45-20 on Saturday; in the series opener this past Thursday, the Moose did not record their 10th shot until the game was nearly 55 minutes old. \n“They know how to win,” said Moose center Ryan Olsen, who moved up to the second line in an attempt to spark the offense. “They do the little things right. They have a good power play, and we’ve got to stay out of the penalty box.” \nMoose goaltender Connor Hellebuyck started for the third time in the opening four games and turned in a 44-save performance. Included in his evening were stops on Nic Dowd’s breakaway and Adrian Kempe’s drive to the net in overtime. \n“I thought Hellebuyck was excellent,” Moose coach Keith McCambridge said. “We’ve seen it in the past. He always gives us a chance to win.” \nNHL veteran Peter Budaj, who formed a tandem with Hellebuyck with the St. John’s IceCaps last season, delivered 20 stops for Ontario for his second shutout in three games. \nGenerating goals -- and shots -- continues to be a problem for the Moose. They have six goals through their first four games this season and struggled to sustain any offensive pressure against a deep, experienced Ontario blue line. On their way to last season’s Calder Cup, Manchester finished second in the AHL in goals-allowed with 2.51 and the Reign have surrendered one goal in their first three games this season. \nThe Moose managed only five shots in the first period and followed up in the second period with eight shots, none of them seriously threatening Budaj. Ontario outshot the Moose 38-19 through the first 60 minutes. \nHellebuyck found himself under heavy pressure at different points in the first 40 minutes, but managed to hold the Reign scoreless. Ontario continued its domination in the third period, pouring 18 shots on Hellebuyck. \n“I think any goalie is ready at any moment, but when you’re seeing a lot of rubber, you’re tuned in,” Hellebuyck said. “I thought we played well tonight. We were really resilient.” \nManitoba also had to do without veteran defenceman Jay Harrison, who left the game. McCambridge did not have a further update on Harrison’s status. \nBut McCambridge saw some growth for his young team. \n“When you look at [Saturday’s] contest, I thought we improved in a lot of areas. I thought our structure was better. We were more aggressive on pucks. When I compare [the game with Thursday], there were lots of positives to build off.” \nThe Moose begin a two-game home series this Thursday against the Lake Erie Monsters, the new AHL affiliate of the Columbus Blue Jackets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:33:02.557+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
