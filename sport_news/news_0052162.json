Leisy turned up the left sideline and eluded a pair of tacklers near the Juanita 30-yard line.\nThat was as close as the Rebels got. \nMost Read Stories Expect traffic delays when Obama visits Seattle Friday afternoon Win over USC puts UW’s coaching upgrade (Chris Petersen over Steve Sarkisian) on full display Huskies upset USC 17-12 and beat Steve Sarkisian, their former coach Lloyd McClendon will not return as Mariners' manager Obama visits Seattle for fundraisers; traffic not as bad as expected Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. “You don’t expect that to be an 80-yard play,” said Bellevue coach Butch Goncharoff. “But Thomas made a great play. He’s quick. We’ve been trying to get him going. He had a great game tonight. That was big for us.”\nJuanita coach Lele Te’o said spotting a team like the Wolverines a quick seven points — especially on a long play — was hard to recover from.\n“It was one of those plays, when you’re playing a great team like Bellevue, you make one mistake and they’ll house it,” said Te’o. “It takes a little bit of the wind out of our sails. We’re a pretty mature football team. Our guys kept on fighting and fighting, but that’s a really good football team we just got done playing.”\nThe Wolverines (4-1, 3-0) increased their lead to 14-0 on their next possession with an 80-yard scoring drive, capped by Ercle Terrell’s 5-yard touchdown run.\nTerrell tacked on a 22-yard scoring run in the opening minute of the second quarter to make it 21-0. The Wolverines made it four touchdowns in four possessions when backup quarterback Jack Enger hit Tyren Sams with a 2-yard scoring pass.\nThe lead ballooned to 35-0 when Isaiah Gilchrist returned an interception to the Juanita 17. On the next play, Rogers hit Isaac Garcia with a 17-yard touchdown pass. Christian Keene’s 35-yard touchdown burst with 11 seconds left pushed the halftime lead to 42-0.\nJuanita (4-2, 2-1) had won two straight before having last week’s scheduled game against Sammamish canceled because the Totems could not safely field a team due to low numbers.\n“It’s a tough situation. We were on a roll and we’re moving and doing good things. Nothing can replace game reps,” Te’o said. “But, we understand the safety that comes with it. We’re all about safety.”\nThe Rebels got on the board with 6:47 left in the fourth quarter when Tavin Montgomery hit Dylan Moctezuma with a 27-yard touchdown pass up the right side.\nJuanita capitalized on a fumble recovery at the Bellevue 4-yard line after the snap sailed over the punter’s head. Diego Moctzeuma scored on a 1-yard, fourth-down run in the closing seconds.\nJim Hoehn", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:05:55.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
