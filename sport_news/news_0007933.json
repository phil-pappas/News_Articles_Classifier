The coach told a packed room at a tipoff luncheon that he understands the motivation behind Katina Powell's book ''Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,'' but questions the need for the alleged activities given the talent his program has produced. It initially appeared the Hall of Fame coach would sidestep any comments about the firestorm that has developed over the past 11 days, joking that the NCAA told him not to ''say anything about anything.'' But unlike previous interviews in which Pitino said neither he nor assistants were aware of the alleged activities described in the book, he questioned the program's need for them in light of the development of recent stars, including Russ Smith and Gorgui Dieng.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:56:57.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
