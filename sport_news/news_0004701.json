Pamlico used a potent rushing attack to defeat Lejeune, 47-0. The Hurricanes gained 375 yards on the ground, led by cousins Josiah and Jacobie Simmons who rushed for 74 and 149 yards, respectively. They also combined to score six of Pamlico’s seven rushing touchdowns while alternating at the quarterback position. “Those two guys give me two really good options there man and I can count on both of them,” Pamlico head coach Torrey Nowell said. “It was a great win but we just want to constantly work our butts off and continue to play better and try and win the conference.” Pamlico outgained Lejeune in total offense, 396-48, for the game. The Hurricane defense also held the Devilpups to just four first downs. “We just have to remain never satisfied,” Nowell said. “I like seeing my young guys play physically and play that way on defense.” Lamont Murray added the other rushing score for the ‘Canes on a 35-yard dash in the first quarter. Pamlico moves to 4-4 overall and 2-1 in the Coastal Plains Conference. The Hurricanes host Jones Senior, which defeated Northside (Pinetown) Friday night, next week on Senior Night. Lejeune falls to 0-8, 0-4 in league play and is at Southside next Friday.
