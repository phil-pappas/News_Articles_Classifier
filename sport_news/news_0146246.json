He's won two penalties in two games so hopefully he can keep up his form.\" \nThe win keeps Palace in and around the business end of the table, but Bolasie - who is now targeting more goals - insists no-one will be getting carried away as they ended Saturday just three points behind leaders Manchester City. \n\"Third in the table sounds great but we know it's early in the season,\" he added. \n\"We just have to take things games by game and see where we go. Yohan basically put the ball on a plate for me but if I'm not in the right place then I'm not going to score, so I've been getting in the box a lot more in training and making it a habit because that's where you score goals. \n\"I've seen a couple of messages on Twitter saying that I hadn't scored here in two years so I thought 'you know what, I have to score'. That one was for my dad - I'm so proud.\" \nFor West Brom, defeat in south London ended a forgettable week for Pulis and his side - with the Welshman losing against his former club having secured a 2-0 win on his first return to Palace last season. \nThey let slip a two-goal lead to lose at home to Everton on Monday and, after reverting back to the same starting line-up that had beaten local rivals Aston Villa, Pulis could not make sense of his side's performance at Palace. \n\"We can't go from a performance of all eights (out of 10) and then drop down to fours and threes,\" he said. \n\"I'm not picking on one person that's the group. They certainly weren't on it. We've got to sort it out.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:50:18.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
