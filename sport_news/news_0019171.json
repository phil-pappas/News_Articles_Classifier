You don't have much time to celebrate the big wins, or hang your head over the close losses because another tough game is always on the horizon. For Tennessee, they'll continue the conference grind this weekend against Arkansas. Now that it's been a few days since Tennessee's painful loss to Florida, head coach Butch believes his players are bouncing back. \"But everything in life is how you respond and how you get back up. They can see the improvements that they are making week-in and week-out.\" The Vols image as 'Wide Receiver U' took a big hit against Florida. Only two receivers caught passes for a total of seven yards. Said receiver Josh Smith-\"Just because we didn't pass it that much during Florida is because we liked the match-ups we had with the tight ends and running backs.\" Reporter-\"Why does it seem like you guys don't throw a lot of deep balls down the field?\" Said quarterback Josh Dobbs-\"It all depends on the game plan, and the plays being called, and the defense we are getting. The protections that go with the fronts we are getting.\" Every pass and every play will have to count for Tennessee when they face the ball-hogging Hogs. Said Jones-\"Texas A&M had 16 plays in the first half last week.\" Added tight end Ethan Wolf-\"One of our points we are emphasizing this week is making every possession count. We have to score touchdowns in the red zone. Can't settle for field goals because ultimately they are going to take some possessions away.\" The Vols expect a physical contest against the burly Hogs, so practice has included the hard-hitting 'circle of life' drill. Said Jones-\"Sometimes players will come up to me and say hey coach, can we start with 'circle of life'. It's just a program mentality. I know our players like it. It gets them excited.\" Reporter-\"Coach (Bret) Bielema said that both teams needed this win. Do you consider this a must-win game?\" Said Jones,\"I do. I consider every game a must-win. When you're in this conference, and when you are competing, every game we play is a must-win.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:41:21.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
