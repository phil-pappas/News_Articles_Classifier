(AP) - South Carolina athletic director Ray Tanner is not \"100 percent sure\" that Saturday's football game with No. 7 LSU will be played at Williams-Brice Stadium because of the devastating floods that hit the state this past weekend. Tanner said Tuesday that officials at both schools and the Southeastern Conference have been in contact and gone through several scenarios, including playing the game at LSU. He said a decision will be made within the next day and half whether the game can go on. Tanner said logistical issues like roadways that have been washed away by the water and whether there would be enough first-responder personnel available to handle the typical duties like traffic and crowd control on game day. The LSU contest is scheduled for noon. (Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
