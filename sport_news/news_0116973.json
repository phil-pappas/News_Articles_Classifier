The message is changing here, and nothing reinforces a new message like results.\n“You play well, you do some really good things in your game but if you don’t get wins it doesn’t count for much in this league,” said Taylor Hall, one of the driving forces behind the Calgary-Vancouver sweep. “It was nice to get a couple of wins, not only for our team but for our fan base.\n“Hopefully it’s a good atmosphere (Wednesday) night. I think we’re starting to feel ourselves out and play our game.”\nThe Oilers have been in this position before, winning a few games in a row and thinking they were finally out of the wilderness, only to discover they weren’t. They had a three-game winning streak last October, remember, then lost 15 of their next 17.\nBut that was then and this is now. And they’re convinced this one is different.\n“I think it is for real,” said Hall. “We’ve had stretches before where we’ve won some games, but it’s been the other team’s doing sometimes.\n“I feel like we’re starting to really figure ourselves out. We have a game that suits us and if we play it well, we’re going to have a chance to win.”\nJust to be on the safe side, head coach Todd McLellan worked the Oilers Tuesday like they WERE 0-6. The message was loud and clear: those two wins can be devalued in a big hurry if they let their foot off the gas.\n“I think that was the intention there and that’s good for us, we can’t let up,” said Hall. “Winning two in a row is fun but we’re still 2-4 on the year. We have some more ground to make up.”\nYou don’t have to be in the NHL very long to know that real momentum lasts a lot longer than six periods.\n“We can’t mail it in,” said rookie Connor McDavid, another of the Oilers recent spearheads. “We have two wins, but that’s all we have. There’s a long way to go here. We definitely can’t be satisfied.”\nMcLellan sensed a little satisfaction early in practice Tuesday, that’s why he drilled it out of them as quickly and as bluntly as he could. He doesn’t wanting anyone getting comfortable after two wins.\n“I think today was a day our team approached practice casually,” he said. “They needed to be reminded that comfort hasn’t been earned yet, it has to come as the year goes on.\n“Comfort comes from knowing you can do it over and over and over again. You want to get it right 8.5 out of 10 times. I don’t think we’re at 8.5 yet. We’re at 5 out of 10. So today’s practice and tomorrows game can’t be comfortable.\n“(Wins) have to be built on. We can be harder on them when we’re winning, maybe, than when we’re losing.”\nFollow me on twitter.com/sun_tychkowski\nrobert.tychkowski@sunmedia.ca\nOilers players see progress, but not taking recent success for granted\nBy Robert Tychkowski , Edmonton Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 07:08 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 07:32 PM EDT\nIt might be stretching it a bit, with 76 games left on the schedule, to suggest that wins in Calgary and Vancouver saved the Edmonton Oilers season, but at the very least they saved their sanity.\nImagine the mood inside the dressing room, in the stands and on the streets, if the Oilers were 0-6 right now, sitting 30th overall again and trying to convince everyone that it was progress.\nInstead, they’re one more solid effort — tonight against the visiting Detroit Red Wings — away from a three-game win streak, and further validation that everything that happened in the off-season is really making a difference.\n“Those were two really good games for us,” said centre Ryan Nugent-Hopkins. “Something we’ve been working on this year is consistency in our play and we showed that the last two games.\n“Against two rivals like that, getting wins in their building is big for us.”\nEdmonton also turned in strong performances in three of its first four games, but it’s ha\nAbout the author Robert Tychkowski Other Stories Oilers early season struggle not a surprise, players say good things are happening\nYou can’t turn a ship around on a dime.\n0\nOilers drop second game to Blues this season in home opener loss\nIf this keeps up, those Farewell Season signs at Rexall Place will take on an entirely new meaning.\n0\nSee more from Robert Tychkowski »\n Hockey\nRed Wings' Pavel Datsyuk expected back mid-November 0\nPascal Dupuis returns to Penguins a year after injury, blood clots 0\nCalgary Flames head coach Bob Hartley happy for John Tortorella 0\nSenators' Chris Neil 'blessed and fortunate' to play 900 games 0\n ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-21T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T23:40:28.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
