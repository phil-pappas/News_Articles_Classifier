The opposing team included three figures on whom the United States had imposed sanctions for Russia’s military action in Ukraine: the businessmen Gennady Timchenko and the brothers Arkady and Boris Rotenberg. The cheering crowd chanted, “Happy birthday!” Mr. Putin founded the amateur hockey league in 2011 with Russian hockey stars, senior officials and longtime associates like the penalized tycoons . The games are regularly broadcast nationally. And they dovetail with Mr. Putin’s well-honed image as a lover of sports and derring-do. Earlier this year, for example, Mr. Putin descended in a minisubmarine in the Black Sea. On Tuesday, he signed a law reviving a Soviet-era fitness program for young people, called “Ready for Labor and Defense.” After spending most of the past year in international isolation, Mr. Putin has been muscling his way back into world affairs. Russia’s annexation of the Crimean Peninsula in Ukraine and its military intervention in that country’s eastern provinces led to economically crippling sanctions for Russia. And American officials say Russia’s actions in Syria will only prolong that conflict. But on Wednesday, Mr. Putin told Mr. Shoigu, his defense minister — who also scored a goal for Mr. Putin’s team — that he sees the results of the Syrian action so far as “positive.” At the game, Mr. Putin spoke of the advantages of staying fit and playing sports, telling the crowd, “Whoever moves and goes toward victory will find it!” Elsewhere in Russia, the leader of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov, rode with a pro-Kremlin motorcycle gang, the Night Wolves, to celebrate Mr. Putin’s birthday. In the Chechen capital, Grozny, a soccer game was dedicated to the president’s birthday, and a huge banner unfurled on the field. It read: “The best president. Happy Birthday!” \nGet news and analysis from Europe and around the world delivered to your inbox every day with the Today’s Headlines: European Morning newsletter. Sign up here .
