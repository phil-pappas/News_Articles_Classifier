(AP Photo/Bill Kostroun) It was not the first thing Prince Amukamara thought about when he learned he might miss a month with a torn pectoral muscle, but it was definitely lurking somewhere in the back of his mind.\nHow could it not? Even a good season could’ve made him rich beyond his wildest expectations, and provided all the financial security his family would ever need.\nNow, who knows what free agency will bring for a player saddled with the dreaded “injury-prone” label? It had to be tough, as soon as he realized how long he’d be out, not to at least wonder how much money he just lost.\n“Yeah, it’s very tough,” Amukamara admitted. “But the way my mind is, I’ve always been a team-first guy. Really just trying to win the division was my No. 1 goal this year — and playing all 16 games.”\nThe part about playing 16 games is out now after Amukamara suffered a costly injury for the fourth time in his five NFL seasons. He’ll be back — hopefully in two weeks if all goes well, possibly a little longer. The injury isn’t terribly serious. His pec is only partially torn. So he’ll be around to help the Giants, presumably healthy for the stretch run.\nThat’s what matters most to the 26-year-old Amukamara, and he stressed that point as he expertly danced around all contract questions last week. There are still five months until he becomes a free agent and a lot can still happen, especially if he returns and plays well in the Giants’ remaining games. He also knows no one will feel sorry for him, since when the Giants picked up the fifth-year option on his rookie contract he was guaranteed a salary of $6.898 million this year.\nBut the reality is, those are relative peanuts compared to some of the huge contracts given to the top cornerbacks on the open market. There are 12 corners in the NFL who currently have contracts that pay more than $9 million annually with $20 million or more guaranteed.\nAmukamara, especially the way he was playing, especially with his talent and potential, certainly figured to be one of the top corners on the market in March. Now, it’s a possibility teams will look at him as mostly damaged goods.\nAnd he knows it. Even he’s wondered if he’ll ever get through another season without getting hurt.\n“Yeah, that question has definitely come into my head,” Amukamara said. “I try different things. I tried switching my eating habits, my workout habits. So I’m still just going to continue to just try to figure it out.”\nAmukamara did play all 16 games in 2013, but the only other season he hit double-digits was 2012, when he played in 13. As a rookie in 2011 he broke his foot in just his second NFL practice, which cost him more than half a season and was an unfortunate sign of things to come. Even last year, fresh off his healthiest NFL season and poised for a Pro Bowl-caliber year, he tore his biceps and his season was over after Week 9.\nThat injury history is a big reason why there had been no signs that the Giants had been trying to negotiate a contract extension with Amukamara. That doesn’t mean they won’t — although with Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie under contract through 2018, it’s possible they won’t want to tie up big money in two corners anyway. And there’s a definitely chance that Amuakmara’s big pay day will still come. This isn’t similar to the situation cornerback Terrell Thomas was in four years ago, when the Giants were actually negotiating a long-term deal with his agent until the moment he tore his ACL in a meaningless preseason game and any hope of that pay day was suddenly gone.\nThis is a reminder, though, of how brutal this sport can be — as if the injury-plagued Giants needed a reminder of that. And it’s a reminder that NFL players should get as much money as they can, as soon as they can, because the end of their career — or the end of their shot at really big money — is always just one misstep away.\n“Right now, I’m just not trying to worry about that,” Amukamara said. “I’m really just worried about, “Man, we’re on a good run.” This was a huge week with the Eagles. It would have been a good game to play in only because we have so much momentum right now. It would have been great. That’s the most disappointing thing.”\nThat’s an admirable, team-first quality that will make him even more attractive to suitors on the free-agent market. All he has to do now is get healthy, and prove to everyone that he can stay on the field for a change.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:10:34.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
