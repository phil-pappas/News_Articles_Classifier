They are rolling in cash and have the best players and talent such as Marco Verratti,\" said the Romanian.\n\"They are well financed and well organised. They have lost in three quarter-finals but this time out they'll go further. Even the very biggest clubs will struggle against them.\"\nThe match will take place in Lviv due to the conflict in Ukraine and Lucescu while lamenting playing all matches away from home had one positive thing to look forward to.\n\"At least for the Champions League games we can count on support from the Lviv fans,\" he said.\nIt'll be a real test but a real show too.\"\nParis Saint Germain coach Laurent Blanc offered support for the suffering of the war but said his side may add to their pain.\n\"We're going there to win a Champions League game, whatever the circumstances,\" said Blanc.\n\"It's difficult to talk about and I'm not fully informed. But I was over there during the Euros with France (as coach in 2012).\"\nBlanc also admired the Ukrainians style of football.\n\"They may have lost 4-0 at Real Madrid but they we're 50-50 for possession and it was equal if the first half. They are a good team and we shall give them every respect.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:15:54.219+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
