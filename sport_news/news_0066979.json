He wasn’t watching when it happened, but it didn’t take long for his kids to tell him he had to watch the replay, which he did on his smartphone.\nMORE: Best photos from the ALCS | Baseball's five dumbest unwritten rules\n“It was pretty good,” Lawless said with a laugh during a phone conversation with Sporting News. “Strange things happen in the playoffs.”\nLawless knows this better than most. For one moment during the 1987 World Series, Tom Lawless was maybe the least likely badass in baseball.\nIn the fourth inning of Game 4, Lawless was at the plate with no outs and two of his St. Louis Cardinals teammates on base in a 1-1 game. Lefty Frank Viola was on the mound for the Minnesota Twins, who owned a 2-1 series advantage at that moment.\nLawless drilled a fastball from Viola high and deep to left field. As the crowd at Busch Stadium gasped, Lawless stared down the ball and stomped toward first base.\nWhen the ball cleared the fence, after 11 Lawless steps, he let loose the single most epic bat flip in the history of Major League Baseball.\n“You don’t go up to home plate thinking, ‘I’m going to hit a home run and I’m going to flip the bat,’” Lawless said. “That doesn’t even cross your mind.”\nFor a guy like Lawless, especially.\nLet’s look at the improbability of Lawless hitting a home run in that situation. First, it was off Frank Viola, one of the American League’s best lefties — he had a 2.90 ERA in the 1987 season and wound up winning the 1988 AL Cy Young award.\nHeading into that at-bat, Lawless had exactly one career home run in 215 games in the majors, way back in 1984 when he was with Cincinnati. He only hit more than eight homers once in a season in the minors.\nDuring the 1987 regular season, Lawless hit .080 with a .299 OPS. He only played 19 games and had 29 plate appearances. He started only three games. His only extra-base hit all season, a double, came in his final at-bat of the season, in Game 162. Heading into Game 4 of the World Series, Lawless was 2-for-9 in the postseason.\nYou get the picture.\nLegendary play-by-play man Al Michaels was on the call. A full 45 seconds of stunned silence after the ball cleared the wall and came rocketing back toward the infield, enough time for Lawless to circle the bases and greet his delirious teammates back at the dugout, Michaels exclaimed, “Did we really see that?”\nSo, yeah, it was improbable. Lawless wasn’t thinking “how am I going to celebrate my awesomeness” while he was at the plate. He was as focused as he possibly could be about doing something, anything to help his ballclub win a World Series game.\nThe reaction was genuine. The reaction was authentic.\nAnd the reaction just happened to include flipping his bat in the air, after he stalked down the first-base line staring at the ball and just daring it to not get over the wall.\n“And I probably didn’t even remember it until after the game I saw the replay of it,” Lawless said. “Then you look and say, ‘Why’d you do that?’ It’s just the emotion of the playoffs. You’re trying to win. They’re trying to win. And crazy things just happen.”\nCrazy things do happen. Which brings us back to Bautista and his bat flip.\nIt’s been the primary topic of conversation from the moment it happened. Some people think it was great. Some think it was awful.\nSo how about Lawless?\n“It’s really hard to hit a baseball 95, 97. It’s really hard,” he said. “It’s not an easy thing to do. So why can’t you celebrate? In football, you score a touchdown and you celebrate on a weekly basis.”\nBut what about the “disrespecting the game or the opponent” argument?\n“You’re not showing anybody up. The emotion of what you just did kind of just takes over you,” he said. “Especially if it puts your team ahead or it’s in the ninth inning or something like that, where now you win the game. Because that’s the bottom line, winning.”\nAnd the Blue Jays did win that game because of Bautista’s home run. But that’s just one reason Lawless loved it.\n“I guarantee you, if he hits one again, he’ll do it again,” Lawless said. “And I’ll be rooting for him.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAejIKF.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBaLHYp.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;OAK@HOU:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBaLHYp.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;PHI@SD:", "http://www.sportingnews.com/rss/mlb/full&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-09-15/baseball-unwritten-rules-stupid-dumb-mlb-five-worst-ranked-bunts-home-runs-bat-flip-respect", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAejsWp.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB94WtH&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;durationSecs&quot;:112,&quot;playbackUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/mlb/oak-at-hou-clemens-ejected-after-plunking-lowrie/vi-AAejRsa&quot;,&quot;providerId&quot;:&quot;IMSeKxuHZwc&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;Sporting", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658455-mlb-playoffs-2015-american-league-championship-series-photos-pictures-royals-blue-jays-alcs", "http://www.youtube.com/iframe_api&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBaLHYp.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Benches", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAejnUy.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB94WtH&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;durationSecs&quot;:323,&quot;playbackUrl&quot;:&quot;http://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/mlb/benches-clear-after-gomez-pirates-get-into-it/vi-AAejD6P&quot;,&quot;providerId&quot;:&quot;DqG5sixi7R0&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;Sporting", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAejFGh.img&quot;}}", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-09-15/baseball-unwritten-rules-stupid-dumb-mlb-five-worst-ranked-bunts-home-runs-bat-flip-respect&quot;,&quot;sourceFriendly&quot;:&quot;Sporting", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBaLHYp.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;1987", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-14/mlb-playoffs-2015-blue-jays-rangers-elvis-andrus-errors-jose-bautista-home-run-sam-dyson-russell-martin?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter&utm_campaign=jessespector", "http://www.youtube.com/iframe_api&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;baseball_mlb&quot;},&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&quot;,&quot;FWNetworkId&quot;:188286,&quot;FWServer&quot;:&quot;http://2df7e.v.fwmrm.net&quot;,&quot;HybridPlayerAdInitT"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:18:23.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
