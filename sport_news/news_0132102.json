I mean, what sort of an environment would you be providing if you’re making people stay? \n“It doesn’t make a lot of sense to me.” \nFriday marked the start of the free agency period with the AFL’s trade window to open on Monday. \nAdelaide star Patrick Dangerfield’s path to Geelong remains up in the air with West Coast’s Scott Selwood the subject of the only free agent paperwork officially lodged with the AFL. \nAs expected, the Cats made an offer for the restricted free agent, with Selwood informing the Eagles of his desire to return to Victoria to play with brother Joel. \nThe 25-year-old was left out of West Coast’s grand final side but the club has three days to decide whether it will choose to match Geelong’s offer. \nFremantle look set to land troubled Gold Coast star Harley Bennell, with manager Colin Young expressing confidence the Dockers are keen to satisfy the Suns in a trade. \nYoung also manages Greater Western Sydney’s Cameron McCarthy, who also wants to join Freo, but is less confident that the Giants will agree to part with the contracted forward. \nWhile Gold Coast are set to lose Charlie Dixon, who wants to go to Port Adelaide, and Zac Smith, who is seeking greater opportunities, along with Bennell, the Suns are right in the Hunt for Melbourne’s Jeremy Howe, who is also mulling offers from two Victorian clubs. \n“I think he’s more likely to go than stay at this stage,” manager Ben Niall told Trade Radio. \n“What we’re looking for is if he gets in the right environment and he can play in one role, which has been an issue for him, and master that role because he’s got enormous capacities, the money will take care of itself. \n“We think, and a lot of the clubs we’ve spoken to, they have got more of a Jack Gunston-type of role for him to use his tool kit.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T10:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:52:52.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
