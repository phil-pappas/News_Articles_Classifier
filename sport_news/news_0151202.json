USA Today Sports 14 hrs ago by Lorenzo Reyes, USA TODAY\nIs this the golden era of the wide receiver in the NFL? Perhaps. But quarterback play is always a key factor to their success.\nAdChoices After consulting with several people involved at different levels of the league, each hailing from a scouting background, we’ve come up with a list of the quarterback-receiver combinations that are the most difficult to defend, not taking injuries into account.\n1. Pittsburgh Steelers: Ben Roethlisberger and Antonio Brown\n© Justin K. Aller/Getty Images Antonio Brown #84 of the Pittsburgh Steelers stiff arms Adam Jones #24 of the Cincinnati Bengals during the second quarter at Heinz Field on December 28, 2014 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. “I think Roethlisberger is the best quarterback that has one of these elite receivers. I would take Roethlisberger over Andy Dalton with A.J. Green. I’d take him over Matt Ryan. I’d take him over Tony Romo. All those guys that have elite receivers, I still give Ben a strong advantage at the quarterback position. And then Antonio Brown right now, he’s the most uncoverable guy that we have in the league. He doesn’t have the size, but he’s a freakshow. He’s so dang strong. There’s no surface area for him. You can’t touch him, and he’s too quick to get physical with him. You’re screwed.”\n— NFL Network analyst and former scout Daniel Jeremiah\n2. Atlanta Falcons: Matt Ryan and Julio Jones\n© Tom Pennington, Getty Images Who are NFL's top 10 QB-WR combinations? “He’s an elite quarterback. He’s smart. He’s accurate. He’s big, so he can see the coverage. He’s got a nice, high release. He’s got a quick release. He’s an excellent player. … Jones is a great player. I think they’ve targeted close to 50 times in three games. You’re not going to totally contain and stop this guy. I will tell you that, you’ve got Matt Ryan and Julio Jones. You’re not going in there with one front and one coverage. That would be asinine.”\n— Houston Texans coach Bill O’Brien\n3. Green Bay Packers: Aaron Rodgers and Jordy Nelson\n© Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Photo Green Bay Packers' Jordy Nelson (87) reacts with Aaron Rodgers (12) after scoring a touchdown during the first half of NFL Super Bowl XLV football game against the Pittsburgh Steelers Sunday, Feb. 6, 2011, in Arlington, Texas. “You can talk about Tom Brady all you want, but I’m taking Aaron Rodgers as the best quarterback in the league. And Jordy, he’s probably not as good as some of these other receivers, but when you put Rodgers and Nelson together, it’s almost unstoppable. Nelson probably gets overlooked because of how great Rodgers is, but as a duo, they’re near the top.”\n— Current AFC pro scout speaking under the condition of anonymity for competitive reasons\n4. Dallas Cowboys: Tony Romo and Dez Bryant\n© Tom Pennington/Getty Images Tony Romo of the Dallas Cowboys talks with Dez Bryant of the Dallas Cowboys between plays against the Baltimore Ravens in the first half of their preseason game at AT&T Stadium on Aug. 16 in Arlington, Texas. “Have you ever stood next to Dez? The guy is a physical monster, and he’s the best in the league at using his body to box DBs out — almost like a basketball player. But it’s not only that, he’s ferocious when the ball is in the air. Any time I see a jump ball, I’m convinced he’s coming down with it. And now that Romo has matured and they know each other so well, it’s a touchdown waiting to happen.”\n— Current AFC pro scout speaking under the condition of anonymity for competitive reasons\n5. Denver Broncos: Peyton Manning and Demaryius Thomas\n© Ron Chenoy/USA TODAY Sports Denver Broncos wide receiver Demaryius Thomas (88) carries the football after a reception in the second quarter against the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium on Nov. 30, 2014, in Kansas City, Mo. “I think that Peyton and Demaryius are a perfect match for each other because what Demaryius does best — and Peyton knows this — is get the ball in his hands immediately, and let him go up and down the field. In terms of letting him be a complete wide receiver and running every route on the route tree, that’s not really his deal. In terms of Peyton’s intelligence in saying, ‘OK, we’ve got some cushion on the outside, let me run up and get him the ball and run those wide receiver screens with him.’ And then you see him just lob up some 50-50 balls, and I think they make it work.”\n— Jeremiah\nBest of the rest\n© Provided by FOXSports 2014: 6-10 ... OFFSEASON ADDITIONS: Draft -- OL Ereck Flowers, S Landon Collins, DE Odighizuwa Owamagbe ... REASONS FOR OPTIMISM: 1) It's Year 2 for the Giants offense under O-coordinator Ben McAdoo. In its final five games last season, New York averaged 29 points per outing. 2) QB Eli Manning (above) enjoyed a stellar campaign in 2014, passing for 4,410 yards, 30 touchdowns and just 14 INTs. He even torched the vaunted Rams defense for 391 yards and three TDs in Week 16. 3) Odell Beckham Jr. posted the second-greatest rookie campaign of the Super Bowl era, among wideouts (trailing only Randy Moss, circa 1998), rolling for 91 catches, 1,305 yards and 12 TDs. 4) In the Tom Coughlin-Manning era, the Giants have won the Super Bowl whenever playing the AFC East during the regular season (2007, 2011). The same holds true for 2015. 6. Cincinnati Bengals: Andy Dalton and A.J. Green\n7. Indianapolis Colts: Andrew Luck and T.Y. Hilton\n8. New York Giants: Eli Manning and Odell Beckham Jr.\n9. New England Patriots: Tom Brady and Julian Edelman\n10. Detroit Lions: Matthew Stafford and Calvin Johnson\n***\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://twitter.com/LorenzoGReyes"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:21:18.579+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
