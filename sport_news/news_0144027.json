It works well, and things just go good,\" Jorgensen said. \"We just run right where we are supposed to run, and it works like it's supposed to be.\" \nIongi opened the scoring by finding Utah commit Ty Jones with a 19-yard TD pass with 10:48 left in the first half, but Orem answered right back on Kody Codner's first of three TD grabs from Gunnar Legas with seven minutes to go until halftime. \n\"Orem is a good offensive team; they love to throw the ball, and they made some great catches throughout the game,\" said coach Tony McGeary, who is 8-9 since taking the Provo job a year ago. \"We felt like if we kept them in front of us, we'd be alright. The times we didn't, they scored. It was pretty simple.\" We made some mistakes, but we never got rattled. We gave up a touchdown there in the fourth quarter, and our defense came up big right in the end. We knew we had to score some more points. Three was all we got, but fortunately it was enough to get it done. –Provo coach Tony McGeary \nThe Tigers (2-5, 0-5) double-teamed Jones for much of the rest of the night, but Iongi had a backup plan: Jorgensen. The senior signal caller found Jorgensen for a 77-yard score with 5:24 remaining in the second quarter, and the 6-foot-1, 170-pound senior wheeled into the end zone for a touchdown. \n\"I've never seen him run that fast,\" Iongi said of Jorgensen. \"He's awesome; I love that kid, PJ. He's so great.\" \nDaniel Kelley added a six-yard TD run with 3:26 left and the Bulldogs (5-2, 2-1 Region 7) were on their way to a 21-7 halftime lead. \nBut Orem had other plans. Legas found Puka Nacua for a 28-yard finish with 39 seconds left, and the Tigers seized the moment going into the break only down 21-14. \nWhatever McGeary told the Bulldogs at halftime from then worked. \n\"Our attitude going into the half is always 0-0,\" Iongi said. \"We don't care what the scoreboard says, it's just a 0-0 game and we play like that.\" \nThe Bulldogs got the ball first in the second half, and used a run-heavy offense powered by Kelley to march down the field with a six-minute drive that opened the third quarter with Lovell's 25-yard field goal to go up 24-14. \nThe three points were the only additions in the third quarter, as the Provo defense stifled Legas and the Tigers with a third-quarter shutout. \nIt was enough — if barely — to lead Provo to its best start in region play since 2010. \n\"We made some mistakes, but we never got rattled,\" McGeary said. \"We gave up a touchdown there in the fourth quarter, and our defense came up big right in the end. \n\"We knew we had to score some more points. Three was all we got, but fortunately it was enough to get it done.\" \nStill, the Tigers refused to go away. The 6-foot-3 quarterback hit Codner in stride for a 41-yard touchdown sprint with 8:47 left in the fourth quarter to pull within three points, 24-21. \nBut that was as close as Orem would get. Danilo Ortolano sacked Legas with just over four minutes remaining — the second sack of the day for the junior defensive end — and Provo forced a turnover on Spencer Jorgensen's pass breakup on fourth down with 1:58 left to hold on for the win. \n\"Our defense was making plays left and right; sacks, forcing the QB out of the pocket,\" Iongi said. \"It was so awesome.\" Scoring summary", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:49:55.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
