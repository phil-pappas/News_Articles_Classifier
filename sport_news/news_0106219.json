One injury in the U.S., a person who suffered a burn on the hand, has been reported related to the defect. The Japanese automaker said in an email Wednesday that the recall includes 2.7 million vehicles in North America, 1.2 million in Europe and 600,000 in Japan. It involves the Yaris, Corolla, Matrix, Camry, RAV4, Highlander, Tundra and other models.
