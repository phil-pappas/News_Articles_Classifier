The end result was the same for the St. Francis Prep girls tennis team, but the journey was quite different.\nOn Wednesday, the Terriers captured the CHSAA Class AA state championship, 4-1, over Mary Louis Academy at the Alley Pond Park Tennis Center. The state title was Prep’s 15th straight, but this season began unlike any other during coach John Brennan’s tenure at the school.\nFor the first time, he and his team started a season with the bitter taste of defeat still left in their mouths. In the Mayor’s Cup final at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in June, the Terriers had their 203-match winning streak snapped by Leon Goldstein, 3-2.\nLosing was inevitable.\n“Two-hundred and three in-a-row is ridiculous. You can’t keep that up,” Brennan said Wednesday.\nEight seniors graduated from last year’s squad, and Brennan felt that his current group was not head-and-shoulders above the competition like in previous years. That’s partly why Brennan didn’t hesitate to call this year’s title the most satisfying of his career.\n“I’m just proud of this team because. . .I love them, but there’s no way they had the talent level on this team they had for the last 12 years,” he said. “But they worked extremely hard to win this championship.”\nPrep wouldn’t even have had a chance to win its 15th consecutive state crown if not for the efforts of junior No.3 singles player Paula Faltynowicz last Thursday in the CHSAA Nassau-Suffolk finals against St. Anthony’s. The teams were tied 2-2 and Faltynowicz’s match was the last to go on. She dropped the first set before taking the second and winning a thrilling 12-10 third-set tiebreaker.\nHoward Simmons/New York Daily News St Francis Prep girls win the school's 15th straight CHSAA Class AA state title. “I knew that it was all on me,” said Faltynowicz, who had a much easier 6-0, 6-0 victory Tuesday. “Going into the match I was beyond nervous. I didn’t make all the shots I knew I should’ve made.”\nThe confidence Faltynowicz gained from that win was immense, and it made her stronger than ever before, even though she was in tears after it.\n“Coming into (Wednesday) I felt, ‘If you can pull through that, you can pull through anything,’” she said, “because that was the most pressure-filled match I’ve ever played and probably will ever play.”\nPrep’s only loss Tuesday was in No. 1 singles, where Hilltopper freshman standout Yuka Lin topped sophomore Alana Davidson, 6-0, 6-1. Lin didn’t lose a set all season, and her success bodes well for Mary Louis’ future.\n“We came farther against Prep than we have in the past,” Hilltoppers coach Kelly Kelley said. “It’s something to build on for next year.”\nEntering the season without counting up the pile of wins as they came was “weird” for Prep senior No. 2 singles player Rosela Scarpa, who won 6-2, 6-2 Tuesday. But she’s happy to go out on top after a 10-win season.\n“I knew we were still the best team around, and we’re always going to be the best team around,” she said. “I think we’re going to start a new countdown now, and it’s going to go on for a long time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:46:39.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
