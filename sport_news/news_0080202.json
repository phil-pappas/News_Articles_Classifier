A K9 unit tracked down the deceased boy at about 9 a.m.\n\"It's as active an investigation as you can get,\" said Andy McNeil, spokesman for the Camden County Prosecutor's Office.\nA woman who said the toddler was her nephew was sobbing outside late Tuesday morning, as police tape blocked off a stretch of Cooper Street, where the family lives.\n\"We're just in shock,\" another relative said, before hurrying toward the family's home.\nSara Kopacz, 61, and her husband, Rich, who live in the neighborhood, were walking their three dogs around 7:20 a.m. when they saw police vehicles, including a county Homeland Security truck, and helicopters buzzing above Cooper Street.\nLater, around 11 a.m., as the couple walked near the scene again, police tape had gone up.\n\"We were sort of praying that they would have found the boy,\" Sara Kopacz said. \"I feel for his parents. I wouldn't want to be in that kind of situation myself.\"\nResidents were alerted to the disappearance by a telephone alert Tuesday morning from the police seeking help in finding the toddler.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:38:27.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
