He has scored 22 points in 48 minutes over two games this preseason.\nThe star forward is healthy, but Blatt wants to limit his playing time heading into the regular season.\nLeBron James Career Stats | PointAfter\n“We’re really happy with how LeBron came into camp. Came in great shape,” Blatt said. “We want to take good care of him for the start of the season. As you know in his great and storied career, he has amassed a lot of miles. We’re trying to keep those preseason miles to a minimum. ...We’ll see what happens at the beginning of next week. I certainly don’t expect him to play both games and I don't know if he’ll even play one. We’ll see.”\nThe Cavs, who are 0–5 in preseason play, have two games left against the Toronto Raptors and the Dallas Mavericks, before beginning their regular season against the Chicago Bulls on Oct. 27.\n• MAHONEY: Growing NBA middle class forces teams to do balancing act\n- Erin Flynn\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://w.graphiq.com/w/cPQTKXvj10F", "http://www.si.com/", "http://basketball-players.pointafter.com/l/398/LeBron-James", "http://www.si.com/nba/2015/10/16/knicks-lakers-kings-hornets-nba-middle-class", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.foxsports.com/nba/story/lebron-james-cleveland-cavaliers-could-sit-out-preseason-david-blatt-101515"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:21:10.260+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
