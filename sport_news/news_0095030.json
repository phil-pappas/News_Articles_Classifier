Because the idea of sports is to try to win every game and be entertaining along the way.\nSunday afternoon at Detroit, two bad football teams played a fun football game.\nIn the end, the Lions beat the Bears 37-34 in overtime for their first victory of the season.\nStill, quarterback Jay Cutler could say of the 2-4 Bears, \"I'm proud of the guys, They fought and fought all game long.\"\nEven while losing to a team that had been winless, the Bears were more interesting than some quality teams are while beating other quality teams.\nOK, so the loss at Detroit was disappointing, frustrating and exasperating ... but at least it was interesting.\nThe Bears should be commended for being more physical, more enthusiastic and more organized than they were in recent seasons.\nFor what it's worth, this Bears' team just might be playing closer to the capacity of its talent than better Bears' teams have in the past.\nRemember, Halas Hall has looked like a playground with different guys showing up every week for pickup games.\n\"In this league,\" Bears' head coach John Fox said, \"you have to overcome everything every week.\"\nIn theory, world-class athletes should try to win regardless of their won-lost record, the standings and other circumstances.\nIn reality, that's how this game looked: Two NFC North rivals with a combined 3-9 record packaging 71 points into 72 minutes.\n\"We scored 34 points,\" Fox said. \"In this league that's usually enough. Today it wasn't.\"\nIf this were the Super Bowl, it would have been one of the most dramatic. As is, it was pretty engaging anyway.\nThere were crazy plays, terrific plays, terrible plays, weird coaching calls, controversial officiating...\nLocal sports fans who aren't interested in discussing the Cubs this morning have the Bears.\nThe debate about Jay Cutler could rage on; the Lions' apparent lost interception that was ruled a touchdown could be reviewed again; the Bears' progress could be evaluated.\nIt's easy to say none of it matters because neither the Bears nor the Lions figure to make the playoffs.\nBut don't tell that to the Bears. A victory would have given them a 3-3 record and .500 at this point -- actually going into December -- is good enough for playoff contention.\nThat's reason enough for them not to tank the present in favor of the future.\nLet's face it: The Bears are going to lose enough games by accident so they might as well try to win them.\nWhat's really the difference if the Bears have the first overall pick or a pick somewhere else in the Top 10?\nIt's a gamble either way. Any team can pick the wrong player or make the right pick and watch it turn out wrong.\nHopefully, sports aren't at the point where the only way to rebuild is to first squander a few seasons on purpose.\nAfter this week's bye, fans who paid a lot of money for season tickets deserve a good show in Soldier Field.\nMission accomplished if the next game against Minnesota is as entertaining as Sunday's was at Detroit.\nIf saying so sounds soft and sappy, so be it.\nmimrem@dailyherald.com\n Columnists Sports NFL Bears Imrem, Mike Football Pro Sports Pro Men", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-19T06:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:54:50.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
