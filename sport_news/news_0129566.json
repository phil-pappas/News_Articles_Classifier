The other team added youth to get them somewhere at some point. \nThe Anaheim Ducks are expected to be a Stanley Cup contender and the additions of Shawn Horcoff, Mike Santorelli and Chris Stewart as versatile support pieces for a deep roster tells you they expect to be playing past April and are prepared for the angst and attrition that comes with the push. \nThe Vancouver Canucks are expected to push for a playoff spot and the additions of Ben Hutton, Jared McCann and Jake Virtanen are about a retool-on-the-fly mantra that has teeth because the kids can play. \nAnd that’s what Monday was about. Could Hutton handle the forecheck? Could McCann handle big bodies in the middle? And will Virtanen finally get to play Tuesday in Los Angeles? Willie Desjardins is in full assessment mode. \nHowever, what was most encouraging in a fast-paced, lack-of-whistles 2-1 shootout victory over the Ducks — it was decided by Alex Burrows after Henrik Sedin missed a glorious 3-on-3 chance in overtime — was that Ryan Miller was sharp. \nHe stopped Horcoff on a third-period breakaway after he easily sped past Luca Sbisa and then a Carl Hagelin deflection on his doorstep to force overtime. There was a better and needed push from veterans. \nBrandon Sutter looked slippery and had three first-period scoring chances by getting to open ice and using good stick work on the forehand and even the backhand. Brandon Prust fought and collected an assist. \nDan Hamhuis had six hits and three blocked shots by the third period and was body-slammed to the ice by a frustrated Ryan Kesler, who took a roughing minor in the first. And Adam Cracknell even scored. \n\nMiller has vowed to make this season about his compete level and reacting instinctively rather than thinking about positioning. \nNo second-guessing. That’s good. \nHe’s going to have to steal games for the Canucks to push for a playoff spot. He’s been under the tutelage of Rollie Melanson long enough and been in the West long enough to have a book on shooters and get his hybrid game in order. \nThat MCL right knee sprain that needed five months to heal is a distance memory. He’s square, calm, isn’t flopping or retreating when it looks like somebody is about to crash his crease. \nHis successive saves off Patrick Maroon, Shawn Horcoff and Cam Fowler on one shift proved that. The Sami Vatanen point shot that beat him through a maze was tipped twice before beating him stick side. And when he didn’t panic on a Ryan Getzlaf toe-drag, it said everything about his game being in the right place. \nIN A WORD: \nLUCKY: Miller caught a good break when a Jakob Silfverberg shot rang off the far post and exited behind him instead of deflecting in off his body. \nGOOFED: Luca Sbisa lost an end boards puck battle with Andrew Cogliano to start the first goal scoring sequence. That stuff simply can’t happen. \nGAME: Brandon Prust answered the coach’s wake-up bell early by taking on Clayton Stoner on his first shift. Had his fight hands full, but did well. \n\nMonday looked like the perfect storm to allow rookie Jake Virtanen to make his regular-season debut . With the ability to keep pace and hit anything that moves, the winger could have added a needed size dimension. He could have been slotted on the left side on the fourth line, but that would have meant sitting slow-starting Prust. Willie Desjardins is loyal to his veterans and also needs to get them going. \nIf Virtanen plays Tuesday, rookie Jared McCann could sit. Which means juggling lines. Interesting. \nADVANCED STATS \n60: Combined even-strength Corsi percentage for Canucks winger Jannik Hansen, who was 15 for and 10 against. \n80: Percentage of faceoffs won by Canucks centre Bo Horvat through two periods (4-for-5) and but he would finish at just 46 per cent overall with a 6-for-13 performance. \n6: Blocked shots by Chris Tanev who was key to getting in the way of shots for Miller. Dan Hamhuis and Luca Sbisa had three blocks apiece. \n24:25: Ice time for former Canucks defenceman Kevin Bieksa, who logged the same amount of time on Saturday in San Jose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:23:02.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
