Just two years removed from appearing in its third straight NFC Championship Game, the team has been gutted by the departure of head coach Jim Harbaugh (who couldn’t make nice with the team’s brass), the sudden retirements of linebackers Chris Borland and Patrick Willis, the not-so-sudden retirement of defensive end Justin Smith, and the not-so-sudden criminal exploits of defensive end Aldon Smith, who was released after multiple DUI arrests and is now plying his trade across the Bay in Oakland. Hero, Nero, Zero for Giants' Win Over Bills The team also lost last year’s top rusher, Frank Gore, and veteran wide receiver Michael Crabtree, who also jumped to Oakland. But Eric Mangini is still here! He was promoted from tight ends coach to defensive coordinator. And Jim Tomsula is still here! He was promoted from the guy who never had to talk in public to the head coach who reportedly farts loudly at the podium. If you encounter 49er fans, give them a wide berth, they’re expectedly shell-shocked, having experienced a decade’s worth of turnover in the space of one calendar year. Celebs in the Stands: Royals at Rugby World Cup With so much change, it’s a tough time get a read on the Niners, who last November beat the Giants 16-10 when New York was in the midst of a seven-game losing streak. San Fran still has quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who will need to have a great game running the read option against the Giants for his team to stop its three-game losing streak. The Giants have the No. 1 run defense in the NFL, which is helped greatly by the fact the team has the worst pass defense in the league. The 49ers, meanwhile, have the lowest-scoring offense in the NFL, which is helped greatly by the fact the team has the fewest amount of points per game. Does anyone really think the Giants have the best run defense in the league? If they can contain Kaepernick and running back Carlos Hyde, that most likely means the Niners are finding success through the air with former Raven Torrey Smith and current septuagenarian Anquan Boldin. Giants Face Good Test in Rex Ryan and the Bills This 49ers defense has already surrendered more than 40 points to two teams, Pittsburgh and Arizona. Sure, they looked a bit more stalwart in holding Aaron Rodgers and the Packers to 17 points in last week’s 17-3 loss. But the Giants’ offense is starting to hit on all cylinders, with contributions from POTO – Players Other Than Odell. In last week’s 24-10 win over Buffalo, the team got honorable work from wide receivers Dwayne Harris and Rueben Randle, and the game-changing 51-yard catch and run TD by running back Rashad Jennings. Top Sports Photos 2015 It’s tough to see the combination of factors that would give the 49ers a victory in this game. Could Eli Manning break from his early-season form (one interception) and put the team’s defense in bad position? Sure. Could punter Brad Wing, who leads the NFL in punts inside the 20, lose his golden touch? Sure. Could the Giants’ No. 1 rush defense get exposed as a fraud? Sure. Could Kaepernick regain the form that had him kissing his biceps after big plays? I sure as hell hope not, as that’s the lamest celebration move in the league and no one this side of a 10-year-old wrestling fan wants to see it. The Giants are tied with Dallas and Washington atop the NFC East at 2-2. Dallas has to host the Patriots this week, so that’s a loss. And Washington is still owned by Dan Snyder, so who cares what they do, they’re gonna implode eventually. Best Takeways From Giants' Win Over Washington With a victory, the Giants can start taking control of the division. Last week’s victory on the road against Buffalo was a pleasant surprise. Losing to a 49ers team that is on its heels would be a stunning step backwards.
