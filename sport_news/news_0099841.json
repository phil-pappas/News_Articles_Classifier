Uncredited SANA via AP i Order Reprint of this Story BEIRUT \nTwo mortar shells struck the grounds of the Russian Embassy in Damascus, the Syrian capital, on Tuesday, an attack that Russia’s foreign minister called “an act of terrorism.” \nThe explosions, reported by Russian state news media and journalists on the scene, came as crowds of Syrians gathered at the embassy in a show of support for Russia’s new campaign of airstrikes on behalf of the Syrian government. There were no immediate reports of casualties. \n“This is an obvious act of terrorism, probably aimed at terrifying supporters of the fight against terrorism,” Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, said as he prepared to meet the U.N. special envoy for Syria, Staffan de Mistura, in Moscow. He added that Russia was working with that Syrian authorities to find and punish the perpetrators. \nSyrian insurgents in the Damascus suburbs periodically shell the government-controlled center of the city, and projectiles have hit near the embassy in the past. For more than four years, government forces have been shelling the poorer towns ringing the city, many of which revolted early in the uprising against President Bashar Assad. \nThe attack on the embassy comes as Russia has intensified its airstrikes against Syrian insurgents. Both Russia and the United States say they are battling the Islamic State extremist group, but the two countries have taken opposite sides in the fighting between Assad and the other insurgent groups fighting him. \nRussia’s airstrikes have mainly hit non-Islamic State groups, including the Nusra Front, al-Qaida’s affiliate in Syria, as well as U.S.-backed groups. Russian officials dismiss distinctions between the insurgent groups and say they are all terrorists and legitimate targets. \nThere were no immediate reports that any buildings in the Russian Embassy compound had been hit by the mortar shells Tuesday morning. Russian state news media said that the first shell struck 200 yards away. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring group based in Britain with a network of contacts across Syria, said that ambulances were seen in the area afterward. \nBy afternoon, Syria’s state news media had not reported the attack, carrying only an item about Syrians’ demonstrating to thank Russia for its “seriousness in fighting terrorism” and to reject “any foreign interference in their internal affairs.” \nThe uprising against Assad began in 2011 with political protests that were violently suppressed, with the arrests of thousands of demonstrators; many have died under torture, according to opposition groups, while many others remain missing. \nOther developments Tuesday in Syria \nThe Syrian ground offensive continued for a seventh day Tuesday in central and northwestern regions, killing dozens of insurgents, according to Syrian state media. SANA said troops captured the village of Lahaya hours after capturing the village of Mansoura in the central Hama province. \nLater in the day, the Army of Conquest, a coalition that includes several powerful rebel factions as well as the al-Qaida-affiliated Nusra Front, announced a counteroffensive against government forces. \n“We call upon all holy warriors who are besieged in Hama to ignite all the fronts and then merge with Muslims who are approaching,” read a statement. \nAlso Tuesday, websites close to Lebanon’s Hezbollah group said military commander Mahdi Hassan Obeid was killed while fighting in Idlib province. Obeid had replaced another commander, Hassan Hussein al-Haj, who was killed in Idlib last week. \nLebanon’s pro-Syrian daily Al-Akhbar and the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said civilian flights have stopped at the Basel Assad International Airport in the coastal province of Latakia because of intense activities by Russian warplanes at a nearby military base. \nThe airport, also known by its old name Hemeimeem, is being used by Iranian planes to bring in thousands of Iranian fighters to take part in the government offensive, said the Observatory, which relies on local activists. \nIran, another key ally of Syrian President Bashar Assad, has sent military advisers to aid his forces but denies sending combat troops to Syria. \nA civil aviation official in Damascus told The Associated Press that only international flights to the airport have been stopped, adding that internal flights continue as usual. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the matter with media. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:29:53.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
