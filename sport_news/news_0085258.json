Ex-coach: Lamar Odom breathing on... \nThe team also recalled forward Bryan Lerg from the San Jose Barracuda of the American Hockey League. Lerg could be in the lineup when the Sharks play the New York Rangers on Monday night at Madison Square Garden. \nCouture sustained the injury in practice last Thursday. He is expected to miss four to six weeks. The injury occurred during a 5-on-5 drill when Couture fell in the corner. After taking several moments to sit up, he was helped off of the ice by teammates. \nCouture, in his seventh season with the Sharks, has one assist and a plus-1 rating in three games. \nLerg, 29, has posted two goals and six shots on goal in three games as the captain of the Barracuda, ranking second on the team in goals. He posted 41 points (13 goals, 28 assists) in 68 games with Worcester last season, and scored one goal in two games with the Sharks.
