Fighting raged in other parts of the city, whose seizure represented a major victory for the insurgents and raised questions over whether NATO-trained Afghan forces were ready to go it alone now most foreign combat troops have left. Residents said soldiers were conducting house-to-house searches and had removed the Taliban flag from the central square, replacing it with government colours. \"There are military helicopters in the sky and government forces everywhere,\" said Abdul Ahad, a doctor in the city. \"Dead Taliban are on the streets, but there are still (militants) in some government buildings fighting Afghan forces.\" A Taliban spokesman denied the government had retaken all of Kunduz and said insurgent fighters had withdrawn to the edges of the city in order to attempt to encircle Afghan and US forces. The Afghan army's Deputy Chief of Staff, Murad Ali Murad, said most Taliban fighters had fled, although some were holed up in civilians' homes. \"Our plan is to force them out of Kunduz,\" said Murad, who flew to the city on Wednesday to personally oversee the recapture operation. \"We will take them out of districts and then out of the province.\" A Ministry of Defence statement said 150 Taliban had been killed and 90 wounded in the overnight offensive. At least 30 people, mostly civilians, had been killed in the fighting as of Wednesday, according to a tweet from health ministry spokesman Wahidullah Mayar. He also said hospitals in Kunduz had treated about 340 injured. Terrified residents said there was intense fighting overnight as Afghan forces moved in. \"There were very heavy air strikes during the night. Those strikes prompted the Taliban to escape,\" Kunduz resident Abdul Qadir Anwari said on Thursday. \"Right now Afghan security forces are on the streets and fighting with the Taliban in some areas outside the city. Shops are still closed and people aren't leaving their houses.\" Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid said fighting continued. \"It was our tactic to vacate the city to allow enemy troops to enter so we could encircle them,\" he said. A spokesman for the Western coalition did not comment directly on what role its troops played in the overnight offensive, if any, saying only they were \"involved in Kunduz\" in an advisory role. \"Our service members retain the right to protect themselves, if necessary, while performing their advise-and-assist mission,\" spokesman Col. Brian Tribus added. â€” Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:02:12.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
