He was 53 years old. \nThe accident, which occurred on Interstate-80 near Boreal Ski Resort, is under investigation. \nJack Dolan wrestled against Aguiar in high school, then helped run the TOC. \n“Ross was a guys’ guy. He was really loyal to his friends,” Dolan said. “He came off as being gruff, but he had a big heart. He helped out a lot of people, a lot of kids. He went out of his way to help people.” \nAguiar wrestled and played football at Fallon, graduating in 1979. He then wrestled at Minot State and at Boise State, before returning to Northern Nevada where he was a Reno police officer. \nHe helped Joe Sellers coach the South Reno youth wrestling club from 1986-91 and was an assistant coach at Wooster through 1996. Aguiar created the Police Athletic League wrestling club and coached more than 500 youth wrestlers from 1990-99. He also coached wrestling at Bishop Manogue. \nHe started the TOC in 1996. This year’s tournament is scheduled for Dec. 18-20 at the Reno Events Center. \n“He was a great contributor to wrestling in Nevada,” former Wooster and Manogue coach Joe Sellers said. “He knew all the coaches. That (TOC) is probably the best high school tournament in the country. I’m sure a lot of those coaches came out here because of Ross. He made sure everybody was happy. He was quite a character. He was very dedicated, and the kids loved him.” \nAfter leaving the police department, Aguiar had a business making metal tanks and silos. \nRyan Tuebner, who also helped run the TOC, is confident it will continue. \n“We’re going to pick up the pieces and make sure we have a great tournament,” Tuebner said. \nAguiar helped coach Joe Sellers’ son Bo in the 90s. Bo also helped run the TOC for the past 10 years. \n“He called me the night before (he died) and said, ‘What’s going on? It’s that time of year again,’ ” Bo Sellers said, referring to the TOC. “Ross was definitely a guy you wanted in your corner. He would fight tooth and nail for you, as a coach and as a person.” \nMark Branch, the Wyoming wrestling coach, met Aguiar in 1994. Branch competed in every TOC, either as a wrestler or a coach. He also participated in all of Aguiar's wrestling camps every summer. \nHe said Aguiar was one of his best friends. The two went to the World Championships last month in Las Vegas. \n“Not only did he care about wrestling, but it was his personality, the way he engaged with people,” Branch said. “As soon as he was introduced to anybody, he was their best friend. He would never forget a face, never forget a story. He remembered every detail of every story.” \nBranch said all people wanted to be around Aguiar. He said Aguiar would email or call him once a week, not for any particular reason. \n“We’ve lost a good guy,” Branch said. “A very special person.” \nRoss Aguiar is survived by his wife Sue and three children, Emily, Betsy and Jacob. \nFuneral services will be held at 2 p.m. Saturday at South Reno United Methodist Church, 200 De Spain Lane in Reno. 1075 CONNECT 15 TWEET LINKEDIN 8 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.rgj.com/1LJAurJ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:23:25.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
