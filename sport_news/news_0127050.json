That was among several infractions against the men's basketball and men's golf programs. \nBut SMU does plan to appeal several sanctions, including scholarship losses in men's basketball and men's golf, and recruiting restrictions in men's basketball. \nSMU will also appeal the penalty applied to men's golf that resulted in a postseason ban for the team and for individual competition.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:24:33.002+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
