Guy McCarthy / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. From Jesus Maria to Mountain Ranch, many people burned out weeks ago by the devastating Butte Fire are camping out next to their destroyed homes. Their basic concerns include reliable, safe drinking water, electricity and phone service. Some are also worried they’ll be vulnerable to heavy rains and post-fire erosion if predictions of a strong El Niño are accurate this winter. They want trailers or modular housing units to get through the wet, cold months to come. At the same time there’s an army of volunteers working with local, state and federal aid workers to help victims in the 110-square-mile Butte Fire burn, where 475 homes and 343 other structures have been destroyed. More than 870 people in Calaveras County have registered with the Federal Emergency Management Agency for assistance, and more than $2.9 million has been approved for victims so far. Nevertheless, some helpers fear there are isolated people, camping in burn areas without transportation or phone service, who are being neglected. ‘Wicked place to live in winter’ “What they need is generators to run their wells, and they need heaters to keep warm,” said Laura Fultz, 53, of Calaveritas. “This is a wicked place to live in the winter, and nobody’s recognizing that part, the people who have to stay and the elderly who are stuck out here without contact.” Fultz, who’s lived in the Mountain Ranch area since 2008, said her place did not burn in the fire, but she’s been coordinating with volunteers to help deliver necessities to isolated victims deep in the burn areas. “I’ve been working with the Mountain Ranch Food Bank and Pantry,” Fultz said. “Almost everybody I know lost their homes.” On Friday, she visited a property with multiple burned structures, tents and campers set up off Wendell Road. She brought wood pallets for use as tent platforms, straw as bedding for one of the resident’s chickens, a shower head, a guitar for whoever wants to play it, a bucket of nails for building erosion barriers, a foam mattress, two shovels and a posthole digger, a set of rain pants and rain jacket, a chisel and some pliers. “My concern is some people out here don’t have vehicles and they can’t get around and they’re cut off,” Fultz said. “Some people haven’t left since the fire. They haven’t been to the meetings. They have no electricity, no phones, no generators. I’m working off a list from Mountain Ranch Food Bank.” ‘She’s an angel’ Tenant Susan Closs, 39, walked in as Fultz was unloading supplies and said she was there on Wendell Road when the Butte Fire came through. “I went to East Murray Creek with my boyfriend and his father, and they were using water from a 22,000-gallon pool to fight the fire,” Closs said. “They had dredge pumps in the pool and they tried to save their home until they ran out of gas.” Closs said she’s been living off Wendell Road for about two years. The property owner, Kim Decriscio, lost her home and garage, Closs said. “The only thing left standing was the pump house,” Closs said. “Right now we have no electricity, no phone and no water, except when we can run the generator.” The Red Cross has been out, and firefighters were helpful as long as they were in the area, Closs said. “Laura’s been out three times to see me,” Closs said. “She’s been amazing. I have an angel. She’s brought me stuff to help keep my chicken coop together, a cooking stove, lights, batteries, water, blankets, clothes. We’re staying out here because we have nowhere else to go.” Closs said she remembers last winter was described by longtime locals as mild, and she still found it “cold as hell.” Basic concerns Tony Soito and Brenda Lundgren are camping next to Soito’s burned home on Avenue A, closer to Mountain Ranch. They still feel isolated and cut off because they do not have phone service and they do not have a generator. “We have water,” Soito said. “I got a 300-gallon tank with money the Red Cross gave me. We don’t have a generator because I’m afraid of vandals.” On Friday, an attorney from Chico met with them at Soito’s property. Soito and Lundgren are upset that contractors for Pacific Gas and Electric are cutting down trees on and near property owned by Soito’s grandfather and Lundgren near El Rancho Loma Serena. Lundgren said she hopes FEMA will provide a trailer to help she and Soito get through the winter. “We can’t keep living in tents,” Lundgren said. “Especially if the forecasts are right. It might be raining hard out here this winter.” Soito said he’s been disappointed PG&E and AT&T have been working hard to restore services to people whose houses did not burn, but little’s been done to help people like he and Lundgren who got burned out of their homes. “We have an order to get temporary power, and they haven’t been out here,” Soito said. “What about us that got burned out? We have no place to go.” Soito said he heard from a FEMA representative who offered temporary rental housing, but he rejected it and requested a trailer. He said he’s waiting to hear back from FEMA. Mountain Ranch Resource Center Volunteers at Mountain Ranch Resource Center in the park off Whiskey Slide Road are serving meals to fire victims. They have supplies for the needy including food, water, clothing, hygiene necessities and toys for children. Two community boards outside at Sender’s Market are set up under the headings “Tell us what you need” and “Tell us what you have to offer.” Some people request help with removing burned vehicles from their properties. Some people want help getting back on their property as soon as possible. Some people request trailers or campers for living in. Offers include a furnished studio for one displaced person, a tent trailer that sleeps six, 275-gallon water tanks, and a message stating “Need a free cell phone and coverage? Call AT&T at 877-920-0362.” The number connects to AT&T customer service. One message on the offer board asks in all capitals, “Who stole my potbelly wood stove? Put it back or else.” More than $2,960,550 in assistance has been approved for Butte Fire victims in Calaveras County, Victor Inge of FEMA said Monday. More than $2.5 million of that total is earmarked for housing assistance, Inge said. The agency has 60 modular housing units at McClellan Airfield, northeast of Sacramento, Inge said. “We’re starting to stage them at McClellan,” Inge said. “People can apply and we can try to get them one if they’re eligible. We know it’s rural out there and some people can’t commute. If they’re eligible, it’s still going to take 2 to 4 weeks to get it in there.” Anyone who is frustrated with the process should still make sure to register with FEMA and to stay in touch with FEMA representatives, Inge said. He recommends patience. “We want people to get in touch and stay in touch,” Inge said. “We want to talk this through and understand what’s going down with individuals who need help. We’re also asking people who are registered to check on your neighbors and make sure they stay with the process. In a matter of minutes people lost a lifetime of belongings. It’s going to take weeks and months to see these first signs of recovery.” Butte Fire debris removal teams are continuing work on the west side of Jesus Maria Road and Old Gulch Road, according to organizers with CalRecycle and Calaveras County. They plan to continue to work toward the north side of Whiskey Slide Road, then toward Ponderosa Way, south of Mountain Ranch Road, and into East Murray Creek Road working northeast. ‘Who’s checking?’ In spite of the local, state and federal assistance available in San Andreas, and the local resources on tap in Mountain Ranch, Fultz said she fears Butte Fire burn areas are so vast and many burned-out people are in such remote locations that some are slipping through the cracks. “Why isn’t the state going out there and checking on how people are going to live?” Fultz said. “Some of these people are elderly and single and they can’t get around. They need generators and trailers. This is the Sierra Nevada. It’s hard living. “How are they going to make it through the winter living like this?” Fultz said. “They are living in complete devastation right now and this winter, the El Niño conditions coming at us, that’s exactly what I’m talking about.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:12:20.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
