Cleveland finished it off on Sunday with a 3-1 victory. Boston's offense went cold over the final days of the season. In losing their final four games of the season, the Red Sox scored a total of four runs. Their only tally on Sunday came when Xander Bogaerts and David Ortiz doubled consecutively in the first inning. Ortiz then made the final out of the inning by attempting to steal third. Ortiz finished the year with a .913 OPS, 37 home runs and 108 RBIs. Bogaerts closed his breakout campaign with 196 hits, good for second in the American League. \"It definitely would have been a nice accomplishment,\" Bogaerts said of reaching the 200-hit milestone. \"I'm obviously extremely happy with the way my season has been and how we played down the stretch. It's a lot of excitement going into next year.\" Rick Porcello took his 15th loss of the season despite a solid afternoon. Porcello's biggest mistake was an errant pickoff throw to first base in the third inning that assisted two Indians runs. The right-hander went seven innings, allowing three runs (two earned) on 10 hits. He lowered his ERA below five, finishing the year at 4.92. \"That’s me,\" Porcello said of his encouraging final six weeks. \"I'm not going to go out there and strike out 17 and throw no-hitters, but I'll give us a chance to win. I was able to finish strong. Take some positives out of that, learn a little bit and carry that into next year.\" The Red Sox finished the season at 78-84, alone in last place in the American League East for the second straight time and third time in four years. Boston had not finished last in consecutive seasons since 1929-1930. \"Collectively, we’re pushing forward and everything is looking very bright for a solid 2016,\" said. \"I think we built a lot of this foundation here this year with some young score players. We’re ready to move forward in advance to next season.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:32:04.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
