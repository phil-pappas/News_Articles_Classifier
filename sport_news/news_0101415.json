His first shot was denied by Nashville goaltender Pekka Rinne, but he was able to tap the rebound in for the win. \nRinne finished with 23 saves. \nKunitz scored the game's first goal with 4:56 left in the second period. \nJust after being released from the penalty box after serving a tripping penalty, Evgeni Malkin carried the puck into the Nashville zone on the left side. He left the puck for Kunitz at the top of the circle, where he sent a slap shot past Rinne on the far side. \nNashville had scored first in each of their previous seven games this season. \nNeal tied it with 8:33 left in the third. With a delayed penalty coming to the Penguins and an extra attacker on for the Predators, Neal beat Penguins goalie Marc-Andre Fleury with a tough angle shot from goal line on the right side into the far corner of the net. \nFleury finished with 37 saves. \nNeal, a former Penguin, leads Nashville with six goals. It was his first goal against the Penguins, and he has now scored a goal against all 30 NHL teams. \nThe Predators have lost four consecutive home games against Pittsburgh since last beating the Penguins on Jan. 8, 2009. \nNotes: Nashville C Calle Jarnkrok missed the game with an illness. His spot in the lineup was taken by LW Viktor Arvidsson, who was recalled from Milwaukee of the AHL. ... Neal has a five-game point-scoring streak. ... Kunitz has 22 points in 22 games played against Nashville in his career. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:18:11.374+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
