Pleasant News \nWAYLAND — The WACO football team gave then 10th-ranked Winfield-Mt. Union a fight for three quarters on Friday night, but a couple of late touchdowns from Bryce Robison and some great second-half defense was enough to extend the Wolves’ undefeated season with a 36-13 win. \nW-MU quarterback Kolt Rossiter and WACO running back Bryce Achen traded short rushing touchdowns early in the first quarter, but the extra point attempts were no good, and the score was 6-6 early. Zach Davis gave the Wolves the lead again late in the first quarter with a 53-yard touchdown catch, and a two-point run by Robison made it 14-6 after one. \nIn the second half, the Warrior defense clamped down and put the Wolves on upset alert after a three-yard touchdown run by Achen and a Colton Horak extra point made it 14-13. Neither team was able to score for the rest of the half, and the Wolves went into the break with a slim one-point lead. \nIn the second half, the Wolves’ running game started to roll and Robison cashed in three times with touchdown runs. The first came in the third quarter when he ran it in from three yards out to extend the lead to 20-13. \nThe WACO offense couldn’t get anymore points on the board in the half, and in the fourth quarter, Robison ran his second in for a six yard touchdown, and then tacked on a two-point run. Then, to put the final nail in the Coffin, Robison sprung loose for his third score on a 20-yard run. A Darren Hunter two-point conversion made it 36-13 where it would stay. \nRobison finished the game with 51 yards on 11 attempts and three scores. He also caught two passes for 31 yards. Hunter went into the triple digits with 115 yards rushing on 14 attempts and had one catch for 10 yards. \nRossiter finished 12-19 for 202 yards, one touchdown and one interception. Davis led the receivers with three catches for 69 yards and a touchdown. Garret Baker had four catches for 61 yards and Kash Rossiter had two catches for 31 yards. \nDefensively, Sam Jennings and Matthew Niebuhr lead the team in tackles. Jennings had 11 total tackles and Niebuhr had 9.5. Hunter and Robison each recovered one fumble in the game for a total of two takeaways. \nThe Warriors were led offensively by Achen, as well as Gabe Black. Achen finished with 80 yards and two scores on 25 attempts. Black ran up 101 rushing yards on 15 attempts. \nJackson Roth was 4-10 passing for 79 yards, and also had 40 yards rushing. Justyn Chalupa and Jackson Gerot each had two catches. Chalupa finished with 66 yards receiving and Gerot had 13. \nDefensively, the Warriors were led by Duncan Pickard, who had 7.5 total tackles. Black had one interception for the team’s only takeaway. \nW-MU moved to 7-0 with the win and 5-0 in the district. The Wolves moved up to No. 8 in this week’s AP high school football poll. They will host Van Buren for homecoming this Friday, and Pekin in the last game, which should be for the district championship. \nThe Warriors fell to 3-4 overall with the loss but still have a winning district record, at 3-2. WACO will travel to Pekin this Friday and close out the season at home against Danville. The Warriors are currently sitting in a playoff spot, but will likely need a win to stay in the top four.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:55:24.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
