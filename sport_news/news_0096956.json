You can just see the hunger in everybody's eyes.\" San Jose State players, including Keoni Taylor (68), celebrate after defeating UNLV in overtime during an NCAA college football game Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015, in Las Vegas.

It will require muscle. \nPumphrey rushed for 261 yards and three touchdowns when the teams met last year, powering an offense that piled up 393 rushing yards. In two career games against San Jose, he is averaging 10.9 yards per carry. \n\"He's basically San Diego State's Tyler Ervin,\" Tago said, referring to SJSU's senior tailback who is the nation's No. 2 rusher. \nThe Aztecs started 1-3 this season but are gaining momentum. In two conference games, Pumphrey and senior Chase Price have totaled 483 rushing yards.

They played Auburn, Air Force and Oregon State outside the MWC, and those teams ran the ball 163 times for 965 yards against SJSU. \n\"Playing someone of the prestige of Auburn gets you ready for any game,\" Tago said. \"I'm just excited to go and see what they can give us.\" \nCaragher knows a Spartans defense that ranks 10th in the MWC against the run (227.5 yards per game) won't halt the SDSU run game in its tracks. They can only hope to blunt the ground game. \nThe key will be first and second down, and forcing a team that doesn't want to throw the ball into uncomfortable third-and-long situations. \nA year ago, the Aztecs averaged 5.6 yards on first down against the Spartans and faced just one third down with more than seven yards to go. \n\"That's how they want it to be,\" Caragher said. \nIf the Spartans can make SDSU throw, the odds slant to their favor. SJSU leads the conference in pass defense (117.2 yards per game) and has allowed opponents to complete just 49.3 percent. \n\"They don't want to get behind the down and distance because they don't major in throwing the football,\" Caragher said. \nSDSU senior quarterback Maxwell Smith, a transfer from Kentucky, is connecting on just 46.3 percent and has been sacked 14 times. But he's been sharper in MWC play, completing 16 for 27 for 289 yards and three touchdowns without an interception.
