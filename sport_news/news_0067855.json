In total, we had just four and a half hours of training before the Oman game.” \nThe Englishman added, “My players did well to hold Oman in the first half, credit to their work rate and hard work. But in the second session, they ran out of gas as they were not physically in their best shape.” \nHe said, “The players gave everything and I am proud of their excellent effort, but they did not have the fitness to match the Omani players. Had the boys had good preparations, I think we could have got a different result.” \nThe coach is hopeful of India making it to the Asian Cup as he is targeting a total of six points from its home games against Guam and Turkmenistan. \nHe also had a word of praise for goalkeeper Gurpreet Singh Sandhu for having a ‘decent outing’ in Muscat.
