We have to be focused. Our aim is to pick up three points. Humility is a key quality for any team in football and I have asked my players not to be complacent against India.” \nL-R: Ali al Habsi, Mohammed al Alawi (team manager), Paul Le Guen and Khamis al Balushi (OFA media officer) \nIndia is on a winless run in the group stage, having lost all its previous matches, the last being a 1-2 outing in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan on Thursday. \n“We have to be careful and respectful as India may raise its game. Our top priority is to win the match,” said Le Guen. \nSecond-placed Oman, ranked 102 in the world, trails Iran on goal-difference with both the teams having eight points each from four games. Guam is third with seven points, fourth-placed Turkmenistan has four and India, which is placed 167th in FIFA rankings, is yet to open its account. \nThe Oman coach dismissed talks of the need for ‘a big-margin of victory’ against the misfiring Indians in a bid to reduce the goal-difference with Iran. “I don't believe in such talks as it may seem that we are being disrespectful towards the opponent team. First and foremost, we have to think about winning, and only then we can think of the margin of goals.” \nLe Guen was happy with the team's performance against Iran last Thursday, but said that his players need to put the 1-1 draw behind and look ahead. “Our strikers still lack potency and it is an issue that goes beyond the national team,” he said. “The domestic league has faced a lack of goals and we need to keep on improving. This is why I praise someone like Imad al Hosni because he never stops trying. This is the spirit that we need as we hope to score more goals.” \nWith the return of Abdulaziz al Miqbali from South Korea, where the striker took part in the Military Games, Oman's frontline received a boost. But the coach hinted that Miqbali may not start in the game against India. “He returned on Sunday night and may be on the bench. I have yet to decide on the starting XI,” said Le Guen. \nHe foresees India putting up an outright fight at the SQSC since it has ‘nothing to lose’. \nGood start crucial, says Habsi Oman captain Ali al Habsi thanked the fans and the media for their support, who he said played a ‘big role’ in the ‘fantastic’ performance against Iran. \nHabsi said, “To have the whole of the sultanate behind us was a terrific feeling. The players are in good spirits after the Iran match. We need to win against India and then target full points against Turkmenistan [away on Nov 17] and Guam [at home on March 24, 2016]. Nine points from the next three games, starting with Tuesday's match, will place us in a perfect position to take on Iran in the final group game in Tehran [on March 29] next year.” \nHabsi, who plays for English Championship side Reading and is one of only three Oman team members playing abroad - Eid al Farsi and Ahmed Mubarak ‘Kanu’ play in the Saudi Arabian and Qatari leagues - said a good start will be crucial in Tuesday's match. “We have belief in ourselves and we hope to put up a show that the whole country can be proud of,” said Habsi. \nLe Guen is expected to make minimal changes to the side that held Iran and will look to retain the same 3-5-2 format with Mohammed Sheeba al Balushi, Abdulsalam Amour and Mohammed al Mussallami manning the defence. \nSaad Suhail, Kanu, Farsi, Raeed Ibrahim and Qasim Said are likely to be in the midfield, while the attack will be spearheaded by Hosni and Ali al Busaidi.
