(AP) — A central Florida high school football coach is accused of hitting a referee after a disputed call, and he faces a battery charge. \nThe Osceola County Sheriff’s Office said Monday that 36-year-old Leo Davis was arrested over the weekend. \nDeputies say the referee was working a sophomore league game at Liberty High School in Kissimmee when he made a controversial call. Parents and coaches began arguing on the field, and officials say Davis hit the referee in the face before leaving the field. \nThe referee suffered minor injuries. \nDavis told deputies he was trying to separate people fighting when he pushed the referee accidentally. \nDeputies say video disputes that account. \nDavis was being held on $1,000 bond at the Osceola County Jail. It wasn’t clear whether he’d hired a lawyer to contact for comment.
