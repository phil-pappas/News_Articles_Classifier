Cole, 48, was arrested Friday in the death of 76-year-old Betty Cole.\nPolice launched an investigation Oct. 6 after family members called investigators to say they couldn't reach her. Detectives allege Charles Cole strangled his mother on Aug. 16 at the Pleasant Valley Motel, where they were living along with his wife, Ronalda Cole, and kept the body there for seven weeks.\nThey said he then stuffed the body into a plastic bin, put the bin in his car, drove from Pleasant Valley, in Dutchess County about 80 miles north of New York City, to Lodge, South Carolina, and left the body in a secluded area.\n\"I find it hard to imagine circumstances that could lead to a son strangling his mother, but to also live with her body in a motel room for seven weeks and to then travel several states away to dump her body like trash makes this a particularly disturbing and unusual case,\" state police Capt. John Ryan said.\nCole was arraigned on a murder charge and was jailed without bail. His wife was charged with felony tampering with evidence and was jailed in lieu of $10,000 bail. She is accused of helping to transport and dispose of Betty Cole's body.\nThey suspects couldn't be reached by telephone for comment, and information on their attorneys was unavailable.\nPolice said Betty Cole's body was found Oct. 17. They did not say why the body was left in South Carolina.\nA man who answered the phone at the Pleasant Valley Motel on Saturday denied there was a body there for seven weeks, saying guests would have complained about the smell. He said police made the story up.\nRyan told Hudson Valley News Network said he didn't know how the couple kept the body of the mother for seven weeks without sparking any complaints of odor from others staying at the motel.\nThe motel, where rooms start at $65 per night, is located on a rural thoroughfare 7 miles from the center of Poughkeepsie. Its website says its country surroundings \"provide a beautiful change of pace should business or pleasure bring you to Dutchess County.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.pleasantvalleymotel.com/", "http://hudsonvalleynewsnetwork.com/2015/10/24/pleasant-valley-couple-arrested-following-homicide-investigation/"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:11:59.171+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
