Laron Wallace scored on a second-and-goal from the 4-yard line to give the Eagles a 6-0 lead. \nThe teams traded a couple of fumble recoveries and punts before Southern Boone could add to the advantage. Early in the second quarter, the Eagles recovered their second fumble of the game, this time on the Pintos’ 15-yard line. Wallace scored on the next play to push the lead to 12-0. \nSouthern Boone added its third touchdown two possessions later, scoring on a fourth-and-13 play from the Pintos’ 17-yard line. Quarterback Spencer Taggart found Mueller on a wide receiver screen pass for the touchdown and the 18-0 lead. \nOn the opening possession of the second half, the Eagles moved the ball 72 yards on 11 plays to extend the lead to 26-0. A fourth-and-5 fake punt allowed the drive to continue, and Dane Bossert scored on a quarterback sneak four plays later from the 3-yard line. \nWolken found Landon Mouse for a 17-yard score to answer that drive, but Southern Boone countered with another touchdown to make it a 34-7 game. \nWide receiver Ethan Hodges added two late touchdown receptions for California. One was a 75-yard, one-handed catch from Wolken, and the other was a running back pass from Josh Woodruff for 73-yards. \nThe second touchdown cut the Eagles’ lead to 42-21 midway through the fourth quarter. \nSouthern Boone iced the game with a touchdown with 1:27 left in the game to bring the game to its final score of 48-21, as Brandon Bowden pushed it in from the 5-yard line. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:27:19.205+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
