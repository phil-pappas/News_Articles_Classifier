American Steele drained nine birdies en route to a nine-under 63 in perfect scoring conditions at the Silverado North course for a one-shot lead over Jhonattan Vegas.\n\nHarold Varner and Scotland's Martin Laird are two shots back of the leader after shooting 65s. South Korea's D.H. Lee and Justin Thomas both carded 66, while England's Justin Rose and Canada's Graham DeLaet highlight a group of six golfers on 67. McIlroy looked much better Thursday than he did at the Tour Championship three weeks ago.\n\n\"I converted a few,\" McIlroy said, \"but I'll need to hole a few more. Definitely a step in the right direction.\"\n\nThe world number three McIlroy is the highest ranked player in the field. His last victory on the PGA Tour was at the Wells Fargo Championship tournament in May. \"It was better from tee to green than I was at the Tour Championship,\" said McIlroy of his opening round. \"Just didn't hole that many putts. Holed a few. If I can get the putter going a little bit over the next three days, hopefully I can get up the leaderboard.\"\n\nSteele is looking to improve on his 50th place finish the FedEx Cup standings last season. On Thursday, he got off on the right foot by making birdie on seven of his first nine holes and needing just 26 putts overall. \"Why did I shoot 63?\" Steele said. \"Well, I think I only missed one green. I would say that's a good start.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:33:56.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
