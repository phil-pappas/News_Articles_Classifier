They played us tough. It was good to get the 'W'.\"\n  Skyline (3-6, 1-4) finished in a three-way tie for fourth place with Cyprus and Hillcrest. The teams will play a three-way play-in game next week to decide who advances to meet top-seeded Timpview in the Class 4A playoffs.\nOlympus will play Corner Canyon in the first round of the playoffs.\nThe Titans fell behind 17-7 on the final play of the first half â€” a result that drew the wrath of coach Aaron Whitehead in the locker room during intermission.\n\"He pretty much called everyone out,\" Bettilyon said. \"Everyone had to do their job in the second half and everyone executed. That's all we needed to win the game.\"\nIt was an emotional night for Whitehead, who won a state championship as a player at Skyline under legendary coach Roger DuPaix. As Whitehead lit a spark under his team at halftime, Skyline honored DuPaix by naming the stadium after him and unveiling a new scoreboard in the south end zone.\n\"It's an emotional night,\" Whitehead said. \"They honored a great man at halftime. It's a spirited rivalry.\"\nOlympus trailed 17-7 after three quarters, but tied the game with 7 seconds left on a Parker Rigby field goal. In overtime, Olympus took just five plays to go 25 yards and took the lead on Tommy Paulsen's 1-yard run.\nIt was the Titan defense, though, that turned momentum in the second half.\n\"The kids made some big-time plays,\" Whitehead said. \"I credit defensive coordinator Brandon Burt for a phenomenal game plan and executing it. Adjustments were made at halftime and Brandon really stepped up as a coach. I'm proud of him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:57:29.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
