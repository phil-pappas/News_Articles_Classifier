(Photo: Paul Kieu/The Advertiser) \nFor an impatient person by nature, UL women’s basketball coach Garry Brodhead is now ready for his program to reap the benefits of his patient building process this season. \nFor three years, Brodhead has concentrated on the program’s foundation and that’s his defense-first philosophy. \nNow that its become the cornerstone of last season’s breakthrough, 23-win season that produced a WBI Tournament championship, he’s ready to move on to the next step and that’s focusing on adding more of an offensive identity to the program. \n“Defense is the foundation,” Brodhead said. “But for us to reach the next level, we’ve got to get better on offense.” \nFrom a schematic standpoint, the change will largely be orchestrated by new assistant coach Katherine Katz, a former assistant coach at Samford. Many of the principles will be based off the “Princeton” offense, which Brodhead expects to provide more structure and focus to the UL women offensively. \n“Not as much one-on-one play,” he said. “We want to try to get easier baskets.” \nIn Brodhead’s mind, however, the ability to take that next step forward offensively is about more than just the Xs and Os of a new philosophy. \n“I just think the girls are much more comfortable now on offense,” Brodhead said. \nThat’s certainly a benefit of enjoying three years of building with a young group. Now, the Cajuns are returning 10 seasoned performers to go along with three promising newcomers. \nThe scheme shift and depth luxury should be less pressure on the likes of senior guards Kia Wilridge and Keke Veal. Three-point shooting specialist Sylvana Okde returns after sitting last season out with an injury to provide another perimeter threat. \nThe progress of sophomore forward Simone Fields also has Brodhead exciting these days. \n“I think she’s going to create a lot of opportunities for us,” he said. “She’s so strong. She’s one of our hardest workers. I think the sky is the limit with Simone.” \nThen there’s 6-1 freshman forward Jordan Alexander from Skyline High in Dallas, who comes from an elite AAU program in that area. \n“She’s better than I expected her to be,” Brodhead said. “She can defend any position on the court. She can put it on the floor. She can do so many things. \n“I don’t know how consistent she’s going to be as a freshman, but the ability is there. I’m probably a little too excited about her.” \nThen among the most interesting returning players will be junior guard Jaylyn Gordon. She was recruited as a point guard, has played mostly shooting guard since arriving in Lafayette and now is listed as a point guard again. \n“We’re looking for a big year from her,” Brodhead said. \nUL Women’s Basketball \n•Exhibitions — Nov. 9, LSU-A, 7 p.m. and Nov. 12 ,Xavier, 7 p.m., Cajundome. \n• Road Opener — Nov. 15, Ole Miss, 7 p.m., Oxford, Miss. \n• Home Opener — Nov. 19, SUNO, 7 p.m., Cajundome. \n• Road Opener — Nov. 15, Ole Miss, 7 p.m., Oxford, Miss. \n• Sun Belt Opener — Dec. 3, At UL Monroe, 5 p.m. Read or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/ul/2015/10/13/ul-women-deep-talented/73879588/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:54:50.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
