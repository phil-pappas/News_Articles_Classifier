Florida solidified its status as a legitimate SEC contender last week with a 38-10 victory over Ole Miss, which was ranked third at the time of the game. Missouri has won its last six home games and has beaten Florida each of the last two years. Missouri's chances could depend on the progress of quarterback Drew Lock, who will make his second straight start while Maty Mauk remains suspended. \nMATCHUP OF THE WEEK: Arkansas RB Alex Collins vs. Alabama run defense: Collins has rushed for at least 150 yards in each of his last three games. Collins leads a rushing attack that helps Arkansas rank third nationally in time of possession. Alabama's defense has forced 6.8 three-and-outs per game to rank third nationally in that category. In Alabama's last two games, it has forced three-and-outs on 61.8 percent of the opposition's possessions. \nNUMBERS GAME: LSU's Leonard Fournette is the first player in SEC history to rush for at least 200 yards in three straight games. ... In three of its last four games, Tennessee has lost after leading by at least 13 points. There have been only 14 other Football Bowl Subdivision games all season in which a team lost after being ahead by 13-plus points, according to STATS LLC. ... Georgia's Nick Chubb has rushed for at least 100 yards in 13 straight games. ... Mississippi State coach Dan Mullen can win his 50th game Saturday if the Bulldogs beat Troy. He'd become the third Mississippi State coach to reach 50 wins. ... Florida has produced at least 10 tackles for loss in four straight games. That represents the Gators' longest such streak since at least 2000. \nUPSET WATCH: No. 11 Florida at Missouri. The undefeated Gators are six-point favorites after an impressive victory over Ole Miss on Saturday. But Missouri has won a lot of big games in the SEC over the past two years and Lock's emergence at quarterback during last weekend's win over South Carolina gives the Tigers some new hope. \nIMPACT PERFORMER: Arkansas quarterback Brandon Allen: It's somewhat shocking that Allen ranks second in the SEC with 1,360 yards passing considering coach Bret Bielema's well-known tendency to favor the run. The senior has completed more than 66 percent of his passes while throwing eight touchdowns and three interceptions. Now he gets a chance to lead the Razorbacks in a difficult road game against No. 8 Alabama on Saturday. \nAP Sports Writers Steve Megargee in Knoxville, Tennessee, and David Brandt in Jackson, Mississippi, contributed to this story. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:36:50.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
