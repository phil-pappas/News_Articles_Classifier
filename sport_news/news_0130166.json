Hawks, fans celebrate AFL cup threepeat \nThe Hawksâ€™ players and legion of AFL fans should be well practised, by now, on shaking off a premiership celebration hang-over. \nThe club on Saturday won their third title in as many seasons, and the fourth in eight years, triggering a late-night party that would feel like an annual get-together. \nMany fans will be back at the Melbourne Cricket Ground from 10am on Sunday, as the gates are thrown open for a day of kick-to-kick on the historic ground and photos with a replica premiership cup. \nThe Hawthorn players will present the real thing to thousands of supporters at Glenferrie Oval, in Hawthorn, from midday on Sunday. \nThey will also take the premiership cup to Tasmania, a club sponsor, on Wednesday to show it off at community events in Devonport, Launceston and Hobart.
