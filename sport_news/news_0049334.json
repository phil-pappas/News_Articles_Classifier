I know, personally, after watching in 2010, and hearing about it with Ruben as well, there's some situations that need to be taken care of,\" Harvey said, making reference to a similar aggressive take-out slide Utley unleashed on Flores in 2010.\n\" … Where we were, it was kind of hard to see at first where exactly the slide started but after obviously the replay, everybody saw that it's more of a tackle than anything,\" the righty added. \"We're all feeling for Ruben. We're gonna pick him up, and we're excited to be back at home.\"\nUtley received a two-game suspension for the incident on Sunday; however, he plans to appeal the suspension on Monday, so there remains a chance he could play in Game 3.\nRegardless, Harvey hopes that the umpires aren't overly sensitive to him throwing inside during the game.\n\"It's unfair,\" Harvey said of the umpires potentially warning both teams prior to the game. \"If certain situations come up where I need to throw that pitch, I'm definitely not going to be afraid to go inside.\"\n© Getty Images LOS ANGELES, CA - OCTOBER 10: Matt Harvey #33 of the New York Mets in the dugout in the ninth inning as the Mets take on the Los Angeles Dodgers in game two of the National League Division Series at Dodger Stadium on October 10, 2015 in Los Angeles, California.
