What about presidential boardrooms?\nAdChoices Wisconsin chancellor Rebecca Blank offered unusual criticism of her peers at Michigan and Ohio State when she told USA TODAY Sports she thinks they are paying their football coaches too much. Jim Harbaugh is making $7 million at Michigan this season, including a $2 million one-time signing bonus, and Urban Meyer is making $5.86 million for defending national champion Ohio State.\n“Those are the choices they make,” she said in an interview for a story about coaching salaries. “That really begins to threaten the whole sense that we are not professional athletic teams. I’m not terribly happy about the fact that they made those choices. That’s my opinion.”\nWisconsin athletics director Barry Alvarez doesn’t share it.\n“I look at it as their business,” he says. “I do. I don’t concern myself. I don’t feel like we’re in competition with salaries at Ohio State or Michigan. … When you’re Ohio State and football is as important as it is in that state, and you have an opportunity to hire someone who has a couple of national championships in his hip pocket and is from that state, it makes sense to pay him. He’s that valuable. … And Harbaugh, I think it’s a coup for Michigan and our league. I think he is worthy of that salary. That’s what they can command. The market drives that.”\nBlank understands market forces. She was acting secretary of commerce in the Obama administration and holds a doctorate in economics from MIT.\n“Well, clearly the market for football and basketball coaches is a whole lot tighter than the market for chancellors and presidents,” she says, chuckling. Her salary is $499,950. First-year Wisconsin coach Paul Chryst is making $2.3 million.\nTop 35 highest paid NCAA football head coaches Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:54:32.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
