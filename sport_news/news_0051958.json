Such a deal for Stanford students attending tonight's match with UCLA (7-6-0, 3-2-0 Pac-12) at 8. \nThe Cardinal (11-1-1, 4-0-1 Pac-12) is aiming for its second straight conference title, having snapped a 13-year title drought last season. Stanford was ousted from the NCAA playoffs last year in the second round, losing to UC Irvine 1-0 in overtime. \n\"We've been playing great this season,\" said Cardinal coach Jeremy Gunn, in his fourth season. \"You can be happy with how you've done so far, but there's quite a lot of work to do. You work toward what is in front of you. Last year we took the program forward, then we were suddenly upset. That is something that stays with you.\" \nStanford's conference tie was against Washington, a 0-0 double-overtime match at home on Oct. 9. Stanford's lone loss was to host UC Santa Barbara, 1-0, on Aug. 28. Star forward Jordan Morris played against the Gauchos, but not the Huskies, because of his commitment to the U23 U.S. National Team. \nMorris, a junior, leads Stanford with six goals and an assist -- 13 points -- in nine matches. \n\"We had a rough start at UCSB,\" Morris said. \"We bounced back. We're proud of the start and are confident. We have a big game Friday and have to keep going.\" \n\"Morris is a great guy,\" Gunn said. \"He's also an exceptional player. As a coach, when you're looking for the type of player you want to work with, you've checked all the boxes and then some.\" Advertisement \nMidfielder Corey Baird is the second-leading scorer for the Cardinal with 11 points -- two goals and seven assists. Two players have nine points -- sophomore forward Foster Langsdorf (four goals, one assist) and fifth-year senior midfielder Eric Verso (one goal, seven assists). \n\"Everyone has been playing well,\" Morris said. \"We've been doing better at scoring more goals. The midfielders have been amazing. The defenders have one of the best goals-against averages in the country.\" \nStanford has one of the top goalies in the country in Andrew Epstein, who has given up seven goals in 13 games, notching 30 saves. Then again, the Cardinal's backline is so good Epstein rarely has to break a sweat. \n\"Epstein is a wonderful goalie and has been having a good season,\" Gunn said. \"A lot of the games, he wasn't troubled too much. When he has been called upon, he has had the answer. You need people to put the ball in the net and you need people to stop the ball from going into the net.\" \n\"Andrew Epstein is solid behind us,\" senior defender Brandon Vincent said. \"We know that if we let anything slip through, he's on his toes to make the best save he can.\" \nVincent, Tomas Hilliard-Arce and Brian Nana-Sinkam have started 31 of the team's past 32 games. Sophomore defender Drew Skundrich replaced Jimmy Callinan, who had started 56 straight games before ending his collegiate career, at right back. Gunn knew this would be an experienced and talented team entering the season. \n\"We've been maturing at every position,\" Gunn said. \"There wasn't a true area of concern. Apart from the last match, we've had the lion's share of possession. We've controlled the tempo of the game. That was something that was tough for us to do a couple of years ago. Our style continues to evolve as we get better.\" \nStanford defeated the Bruins 2-1 in Los Angeles on Oct. 16. Vincent expects an intense atmosphere at Laird Q Cagan Stadium. \n\"It will be a great night,\" Vincent said. \"Hope we get some fans out.\" \nStanford has never won a national soccer crown, having been runner-up in 1998 and 2002. \nEmail John Reid at jreid@dailynewsgroup.com ; follow him at twitter.com/dailynewsjohn .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:24:09.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
