A A A \nIt was all in the execution. \nSaugus came out and scored on three of its first four possessions in a 42-7 win over West Ranch on Friday night at College of the Canyons. \nThe Centurions led 21-0 before the first quarter ticked all the way down. \n“We executed really well (on offense) and our defense shut them down,” said Saugus quarterback Louis Eusebi. “Our defense has been playing lights out and our offense finally picked it up.” \nThe Cents offense was efficient. On their first drive of the game they ran eight plays (six runs, two passes) and drove 50 yards in just over 2 minutes. \nJon Cordova, David Aubrey and Amir Bishop all touched the ball in the running game, with Bishop capping the drive with a 2-yard touchdown. \nEusebi helped himself out on the ground, rushing for 50 yards on fourth-and-2 for the second score of the night. \nCordova scored twice on the ground, once from a yard out and again from 2 yards out. \nAubrey added a rushing TD from 1 yard out in the third quarter. \nOn defense, the Centurions were able to slow down the high-octane offense of the Wildcats. \nSaugus put pressure on West Ranch early and often. \nWildcats’ quarterback Jackson Clark had to be removed from the game with 22 seconds left in the first quarter after being sacked for the third time of the night. \n“We just didn’t execute,” said West Ranch head coach Jan Miller. “Our offense has to execute. When the offense doesn’t execute then this is what happens. For some reason our quarterbacks were just holding on to the ball tonight. We’ll look at the film and see what’s going on, but they’re just holding onto the ball forever.” \nThe only points the Wildcats were able to get on the board were from backup signal caller Wyatt Eget, who threw a 76-yard pass to Jordan Hunt in the third quarter. \nSaugus (3-3 overall, 1-0 Foothill League) plays Valencia next Friday, while West Ranch (3-3, 0-1) faces Hart.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:37:47.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
