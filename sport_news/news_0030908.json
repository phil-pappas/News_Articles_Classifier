Becton's girls volleyball team lost its first NJIC Meadowlands Division match in two years at the start of October as they dropped a tight three-set contest to Wallington, 25-17, 13-25 and 25-27, on Oct. 1. \nThe Wildcats had won all of their Meadowlands Division games last season and won their first seven contests until the loss to the Lady Panthers. In the two seasons Becton had won 25 straight Meadowlands Division games in a row. \nBecton head coach Mike Settembrino said that Wallington was doing the basics, and his team never really got going. \n\"The difference was that Wallington executed the simple skills like passing, serving, and setting better than we did,\" said Settembrino. \"We never really got into the flow of the game, and Wallington took advantage of every mistake we made.\" \nIn the battle against Wallington, Becton senior Sam Stallone had eight kills, but the Cats defense could not stop the Panthers duo of Angelica Urban and Angelica Gutowska with seven kills each. Sam Frola added nine digs while Jamie Scangarella chipped in eight assists for Becton. \nDespite the loss the Wildcats will have another shot at Wallington, this time in East Rutherford on Oct. 27 at 7 p.m. \nThe Lady Wildcats bounced back right away after the loss to Wallington and already had a three-match winning streak in the division at the end of last week after straight-set wins over Weehawken (Oct. 6), Immaculate Conception (Oct. 8) and Hasbrouck Heights (Oct. 9). \nSettembrino knows what the team needs to do as it heads into the Bergen County Tournament and the rest of the NJIC Meadowlands Division schedule. \"We need to be more consistent during games,\" said the Becton head coach. \"In practice we have been working on our setting, passing, and serving.\" \nAfter the loss to Wallington, Becton was led statistically by the two Sams, Sam Frola and Sam Stallone. Frola had collected 65 kills and 60 aces while Stallone chipped in 60 kills and 35 aces. \"Sam and Sam have improved on their attack as well as their defense,\" said Settembrino. \nOne of the key pieces for another big year for Becton has been their third top senior in Stephanie Mitarotonda, who is one of the top outside hitters. \"Don't forget the play of Stephanie Mitarotonda,\" said Settembrino. \"She is my outside hitter as well as my best defensive player.\" \nIn addition to the top three seniors, Settembrino has been getting quality play from his setter, Scangarella, who had 73 assists including the Wallington contest. Becton has also been using a second setter when it uses a 4-2 formation in sophomore Justyna Cabezas, who has 57 assists. Along with Scangarella, the other top outside hitter for the Cats is sophomore Tailia Romanello who had 25 digs and 20 aces.
