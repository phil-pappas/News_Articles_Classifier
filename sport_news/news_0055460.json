Seniors Parker Nicholls and Guthrie Dingmann each notched two goals in a Friday Pirate boys' soccer victory at home over Mesabi East, 4-0. The smiles turned to frustrated frowns, however, on Saturday, which was \"Parents' Day,\" when the Pirates lost with under two minutes left in the game, 1-0 to Hibbing-Chisholm at the Crookston fields. Friday, the Pirates carried the offensive play for much of the game, even in the second half when it was their turn to play against a stiff breeze. They were able to work on their passing and on setting up plays, and they had many other chances in tight on the Mesabi East netminder but weren't able to finish. It wasn't all good news for the Pirates, however, as late in the game freshman Eric Delorme, in full spring, got tangled up with a Mesabi East player and tumbled hard to the ground. In obvious pain and with his left arm wrapped in his jersey, he got a ride to the hospital where he was diagnosed with a broken wrist. He was in a cast at the Pirate football game Friday night. The wind was again a factor on Saturday. With the wind in the first half, the Pirates had opportunities to score, as did the Bluestreaks. But in the second half, Hibbing-Chisholm's Daniel Lopez Campo, who appeared to be a threat to score almost every time he touched the ball on the day, finally got going on a rush with the wind behind him and bent a beautiful shot past Pirate net-minder Elijah Phaiah, who finished with 20 saves on the day, twice as much as his Hibbing-Chisholm counterpart in net, Michael Kubena. The Pirates are 9-4 after the weekend split, and hit the road for a tense tilt against rival East Grand Forks on Oct. 6. They are looking at no worse than a #4 seed in the playoffs, which begin Oct. 15.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T20:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:26:31.663+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
