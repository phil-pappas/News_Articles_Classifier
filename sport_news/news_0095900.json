He rushed for a career-high 316 yards and five touchdowns on 32 carries to earn Savannah Morning News player of the week honors.\nBrown has been named player of the week twice this year — he also took the award after rushing for 257 yards and three scores in the season opening win over Jenkins. In seven games, he has rushed for 1,172 yards and 11 scores.\n“It’s a huge weapon to have a player like Patrick who can take it to the house any time he touches the ball,” Revell said. “Coach Cox said to give it to Patrick because he has a chance to break one, and if not — we can run the clock out. The offensive line created the hole, Patrick made a great move and once he got into space he was gone. That played turned the momentum of the game around.”\nBrown, who is receiving recruiting interest from Valdosta State, is always quick to credit his teammates for his success, and he praised the work of his offensive line, which consists of Sheldon Froehlich, Ti’ke Mydell, Luke Kush, Josh McClendon and Johnnie Holmes and Al’tez Leverett.\n“Those guys do all the work up front,” Brown said. “On the touchdown at the end of the half, I had a choice of going right or left, I found a seam and went left and was able to run between two safeties in the backfield and get to the end zone.”\nBrown said he models his game after former University of Oregon star De’Anthony Thomas, now a running back with the Kansas City Chiefs.\n“He’s got a lot of speed, and he uses his feet well,” Brown said. “I try to run like that.”\nBrown said he heard the PA announcer note when he passed the 1,000-yard mark for the season, but he had no idea that he had rushed for 300 yards until after the game. Revell said it’s the highest total he can remember in his 14 years coaching at South Effingham, and they are looking into whether it’s a school record.\nBrown is more worried about the Mustangs’ final three games against Brunswick, Ware County and Glynn Academy than his personal stats.\n“I’ve never asked coach about any school records,” Brown said. “Maybe I’ll ask him when the season is over.”\nOther top performances:\nJaVonte Middleton, Jenkins — The sophomore completed 15 of 23 passes for 235 yards and two scores in a win over Savannah High.\nDemetris Robertson, Savannah Christian — The senior rushed for 99 yards, including a 48-yard score, and had an interception he returned 63 yards in a win over Jenkins County.\nJalen Leary, Calvary — The freshman rushed for 90 yards and a pair of scores in a win over Portal.\nWesley Kennedy, Benedictine — The junior had 60 yards receiving and a 43-yard score, and rushed for 41 yards and another touchdown in the Cadets’ win at Vidalia.\nJacob Collins, Benedictine — The senior rushed for a career high 114 yards in the win over Vidalia, breaking off runs of 36 and 42 yards in the second half.\nJoe Burke, Beach — The junior rushed for 150 yards and three scores in a win over Beach, including a 64-yard touchdown.\nCole Donahue, Islands — The quarterback threw for a touchdown and ran for another in a loss to Beach.\nCalvin Turner Jr., New Hampstead — Was 8 of 13 passing for 232 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions, and rushed for 105 yards and a score in a loss to North Cobb Christian.\nTim Leeks, Jenkins — Had four catches for 103 yards and a score in a win over Savannah.\nTyleek Collins, Benedictine — His 90-yard kickoff return to start the second half sparked the Cadets in a win at Vidalia.\nAdam Byck, Savannah Country Day — Rushed for 132 yards in a loss to Claxton.\nCaleb Tymchyshyn, St. Andrew’s — The senior rushed for three touchdowns in a loss to Hilton Head Prep.\nBrian Hughes, Richmond Hill — The junior rushed for 124 yards and two scores and had two scoring passes in a loss to South Effingham.\nDearius Young, New Hampstead — The senior had three catches for 135 yards and a score in a loss to North Cobb Christian.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/safgfsaf23.JPG", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/safgfsaf23.JPG"], "published": "2015-10-19T13:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:08:54.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
