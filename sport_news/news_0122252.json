Barrett ran for three in red-zone situations and wide receiver and former quarterback Braxton Miller caught a touchdown pass. \nMaryland quarterback Perry Hills, in his first start in four games, ran for touchdowns late in the first half and to open the third quarter to rally Maryland into a 21-21 tie. \nNo. 3 Baylor 66, Kansas 7 \nLAWRENCE, Kan. -- Seth Russell passed for 246 yards and three touchdowns and Shock Linwood added 135 yards rushing as Baylor stomped Kansas. \nRussell and Linwood played only in the first half.

Scott scored on a 3-yard off-tackle run with 43 seconds to play, giving the Spartans their school-record 11th straight conference road win. \nRutgers bid for a tying score ended at midfield when quarterback Chris Laviano inexplicably spiked the ball on fourth down with three seconds to play. \nNo. 5 Utah 30, No. 23 Cal 24 \nSALT LAKE CITY -- Utah hung on to defeat California when a pass by Jared Goff was broken up on fourth-and-5 in the final seconds. \nDevontae Booker was the star on homecoming night for the Utes with 267 all-purpose yards, including a season-high 222 rushing yards, two touchdowns and a fumble. \nGoff threw a career-high five interceptions but completed 25 of 47 passes for 340 yards and two touchdowns. In all, Utah's defense had six takeaways. \nCal cut the deficit to 27-24 with 2:03 remaining in the third quarter after Booker's third-quarter fumble led to a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Tre Watson. \nNo. 6 Clemson 43, Georgia Tech 24 \nCLEMSON, S.C. -- Deshaun Watson threw for 265 yards and two touchdowns and the Tigers' defense throttled the Yellow Jacket's potent option rushing attack. \nClemson, which has led the Football Bowl Subdivision in tackles for loss each of the last two seasons, had 10 tackles for loss and held the Yellow Jackets to 57 yards rushing. \nGeorgia Tech entered the game ranked sixth nationally with an average of 311 yards per game. \nNo. 7 LSU 45, South Carolina 24 â€¹previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:02:10.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
