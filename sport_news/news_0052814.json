We need to get better everyday,\" said head coach Reed Sunahara. \"I would like to think we could play with that intensity all the time, I don’t know if we have the right kids in right now or the right chemistry, but that’s what we have to figure out.\" In the first set, RMU and West Virginia battled back and forth exchanging points by kill and error, before the Colonials took a lead of 12-7. The five-point lead was just the beginning of the RMU takeover in set one. The Colonials went on a 3-0 kill run and tacked on four more points from attacking and service errors. The Mountaineers were down 22-11, a kill from freshman outside hitter Bridgett Talia was the last earned point from the WVU side of the net. The first set ended with a score of 25-14. Following the switch, the second set showed a more communicative Mountaineer team that seemed to be clicking together well. West Virginia won the set with solid performances from junior setter Haley Roe and sophomore outside hitter Morgan Montgomery. Roe contributed a kill in the second set, but the teamwork between her, Montgomery and senior Caleah Wells at the net kept WVU in the lead through the entire set. Montgomery posted six of her kills in the second set alone, and while she struggled with a couple of errors, she hit four in a row near the end to extend West Virginia’s lead to 23-15, before RMU suffered two attacking errors to give up the set. In the match, West Virginia scored a total of 51 kills but tacked 32 attacking errors onto that, giving the ball back to Robert Morris with a point each time. Montgomery continues to lead the Mountaineer offense with 22 kills and was followed by Talia with 15. \"I think its decision making too, we had a lot of hitting errors, we got out-dug, we got a lot of serving errors, we’re giving them easy points, and that’s what we have to minimize but we also have to make sure we’re aggressive at the same time,\" Sunahara said. \"So if we can find the combination – we’re young, but we’re in the middle of the season. They should be veterans, so we’ve got to make sure they do a better job of executing at a higher level.\" Returning to the court after halftime, set three resembled more of the first set, but both teams were battling hard. Through some long rallies and several kills from each side of the net, RMU and West Virginia exchanged points in most of the set. A service error from Talia and a few kills from Robert Morris extended a small lead the Colonials held, up 18-14. West Virginia came back with a service ace from sophomore libero Gianna Gotterba and kills from Montgomery, Talia and sophomore middle blocker Mia Swanegan, but RMU returned with its own power. The Colonials took the third set, 25-18. In set four Robert Morris had a two-set advantage and wanted to run away with it. The Colonials were up 16-5 when Montgomery hit three straight kills, trying to cut the lead, but it wasn’t enough. Kills and an ace from the RMU side as well as attacking errors on West Virginia extended the score 20-13. With only a few plays before Robert Morris would win, Talia, Roe and Montgomery fought hard to catch up. Set three ended in a WVU loss, with a score of 25-18. \"I just feel like some people really wanted it, and some people, not saying that they didn’t want it, they just weren’t in it,\" Gotterba said following the loss. \"We all have to be flowing, chemistry together at the same time in order for us to be successful. We came into this match with a good feeling, but I think one of the things we need to work on as a team is not stooping to a team’s level, always work as hard as we can.\" West Virginia hits the road this weekend for a matchup on Saturday against Kansas State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:09:37.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
