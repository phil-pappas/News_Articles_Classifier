The two teams square off Oct. 9 with matching 3-2 records and a lot on the line. (File photo by James Levin) Tim Schwartz Contact Reporter Both Reservoir and Glenelg enter week 6 showdown having won three straight with matching 3-2 records \nWith high expectations and goals of reaching the playoffs again this fall, a 0-2 start to the season wasn’t exactly what the Glenelg and Reservoir football teams had in mind. \nSince then, though, the Gators and Gladiators have won three straight games against top teams, and appear to have found their strides. \nBut on Oct. 9, only one will keep their winning streak alive, as the two teams faceoff with 3-2 records and possible playoff implications on the line. \n“It’s the biggest game of the year,” said Reservoir defensive lineman Shawn Hamilton. “We’ve gone week to week saying each one is a big game, but this could determine who is going to make it to the playoffs or not because there are three teams with the same record. It’s going to be one of the biggest weeks for the whole school, and will determine the rest of the year for our team.” \nGlenelg defensive back Brett Wasson had a similar sentiment. \n“This is a huge game,” he said. “We just came back from beating Mt. Hebron, so we can’t get too complacent with our score in that one. We know how big this one is going to be, and we can’t take it easy.” Reservoir football kicks off fall season practices \nReservoir senior running back/safety Josh Young talks about expectations for the Gators squad in 2015.

Against the Lions, they allowed two first-quarter touchdown passes, but shut out one of the top offenses in the county the final three quarters. They eventually lost, however, 14-6. \nThe next week against the Scorpions, the Gators were tied late before Oakland Mills lineman Larry Aaron stripped the ball and returned it for a 60-yard game-winning touchdown. \n“I believe we are the second or third best team in the county,” Hamilton said. “We played the top two teams to a one-score game. We gave Howard one of their toughest games in the last two years, and Oakland Mills, we went down to the wire there, too.” Glenelg football kicks off fall season practices \nGlenelg head football coach Butch Schaffer talks about his team's expectations for the upcoming fall season.

It opened its season with a 40-27 defeat at Oakland Mills, then lost a tough one to River Hill the next week. \nAgainst the Hawks, the Gladiators held a 14-7 lead entering the final quarter. However, River Hill came back with 14 points in the final quarter, including a game-winning touchdown in the final minute. \nThe Gladiators bounced back in spectacular fashion the next week, scoring two late touchdowns to beat Wilde Lake, 15-11. They followed that up with wins over Hammond and Mt. Hebron to push their record above .500. \n“We started off 0-2, so we knew we needed to turn it around,” Wasson said. “Some of our captains talked to our teammates to get their minds straight. We just had to come together as a team, and I think that’s what we’ve been doing these past couple games.” \nAs for the game on Oct. 9, Wasson knows Reservoir is going to be a tough opponent. “We expect a good game,” he said. “We know their offense and defense are solid. They have a lot of good skill players, and on defense we are going to have to get to the ball and gang tackle. On offense, I think our line can take their line and we can run the ball on them. ... (The key will be) our aggressiveness. We’re going to have to be really aggressive with them because it’s a close game with them every year. It’s going to come down to the last minute, so we’re going to have to finish strong.” \nHamilton agrees that it will be a tight game and that both teams will run the ball, but notes that getting the ball to the outside will be key if the Gators are going to pull out the victory. \n“It’s going to be a good game. It’s going to go down to the wire, both teams are going to score, and both teams can run the ball,” Hamilton said. “Both teams are good. ... It’s going to be a hard game for both of us. Both have big lines, the running backs are all good, but for us, I think we have an advantage because of our skill and speed. We can outrun them on the outside, and get touchdowns that way.” \nNotes: Glenelg defeated Reservoir, 34-6, in the last matchup on Sept. 19, 2014. The Gladiators are 4-3 against the Gators since 2007. \nHoward County week 6 football schedule: \nGlenelg (3-2) at Reservoir (3-2), Oct. 9 at 7 p.m. \nOakland Mills (4-1) at Marriotts Ridge (4-1), Oct. 9 at 7 p.m. \nHoward (5-0) at Centennial (0-5), Oct. 9 at 7 p.m. \nRiver Hill (2-3) at Long Reach (2-3), Oct. 9 at 7 p.m. \nWilde Lake (2-3) at Hammond (2-3), Oct. 10 at noon \nMt.
