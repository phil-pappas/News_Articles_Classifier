India had started their campaign with a convincing win against arch-rivals Pakistan yesterday but today they let slip a two-goal advantage to go down in the end. With this win, last year’s finalists Great Britain went to the top of the pool with six points. India (3 points) slipped to third position behind Argentina (4 points). Great Britain were trailing 2-3 at the end of the first half but managed to hold their nerves and scored the winner two minutes from time. “We discussed at halftime that we should just keep it really tight defensively and keep building the pressure against them,” said Great Britain coach Jon Bleby. “I’m proud of the players because I thought they played really well, especially in the second half.” Great Britain, who beat Malaysia 4-2 in their opening match, opened the account in the 6th minute when James Simpson sneaked into open space between two Indian defenders and deflected the ball into the goal. In the 10th minute, they were awarded a penalty corner but this time it was saved by the Indian goalkeeper. India found the equaliser in the 17th minute through an opportunistic finish from Sumit Kumar. Varun Kumar cut in from the right flank but his pass to Sumit, waiting for the cross in front of the goalpost, was deflected off Great Britain captain Luke Taylor’s stick. Sumit immediately pounced on the loose ball and coolly lifted it over the onrushing goalkeeper. Two quick goals India then took control with two quick goals through Sumit in the 26th minute and Manpreet Singh in the 29th minute. But Great Britain got their fourth penalty corner in the very next minute and Taylor finally made it count. With just two minutes left in the first half, Great Britain earned another penalty corner, but a vigilant Indian defence yet again thwarted the opponents’ attempt. In the second half, Great Britain attacked continuously but could not find the equaliser. Both the teams got a penalty corner each but on both the occasions the goalkeepers saved their teams. Great Britain’s equaliser finally came in the 46th minute when Taylor’s penalty corner attempt was padded away by Suraj Karkera but it went straight to Jack Clee, who made no mistake. India had a chance to go ahead through a penalty corner but the effort was wide of the mark. When it looked like the match was heading for a draw, Great Britain got another penalty corner in the 68th minute and Taylor scored his second goal to give his team three points. India coach Harendra Singh said that India gave away too many penalty corners. “I think the main lesson the players learned today was that if you give the opponents so many penalty corners, you will be punished,” Harendra said. “However, it’s a young team so there are bound to be mistakes.” Captain Harjeet Singh said: “We lost this match but the tournament isn’t over yet, this is not a setback.” India will next face Argentina on October 14. — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:15:31.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
