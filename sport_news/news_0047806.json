The rookie outfielder earned a plug from right-hander Jeff Samardzija, who said Tuesday that Thompson \"needs to be in the lineup.\"\nWith four games to go in 2015 after a 5-3 loss to the Royals on Wednesday, Thompson views such declarations as motivation for the winter.\n\"I thought last offseason was probably the biggest of my career as far as time to put up or shut up,\" Thompson said, \"but these past two months have validated to me that I can play up here, and this offseason I'm going to get after it like I've never worked.\n\"I've prided myself on my work in the offseason, but this is very motivating to me. ... I'm going to bust my tail and really come back to spring training and try to make an impression.\"\nThompson continued to make an impression Wednesday, singling in the first inning and walking in the fifth from the cleanup spot to add to a surprising offensive performance from a player known more for his defense. He ended 2-for-4 on the night to raise his batting average to .303 with five homers and 15 RBIs in 40 games.\nThe smooth defense, however, was what had Samardzija pleading Thompson's case to the media Tuesday night after Thompson sprawled out to rob Ben Zobrist of a hit. Thompson said he was grateful for the support but thinks he has more to prove.\nAll the action from U.S. Cellular Field.\n\"It's nice to have these guys' confidence,\" Thompson said. \"As a rookie, you're trying to prove that you can play up here, that you deserve to be up here. Especially for him to say that — he's one of the more established veterans on the team — it means a lot. I still have a lot to prove each and every day.\"\nVentura said he's not worried about Thompson returning in 2016 in great shape and motivated. Thompson said he has a good example to follow in good friend and Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado, who has 41 homers and 127 RBIs this season.\n\"I'm going to eat whatever he's eating or do whatever he's doing,\" Thompson said. \"I'm just trying to follow his path. He's probably my best critic and my best hitting coach. I'll have a lot to learn this offseason.\"\nLeft-hander Jose Quintana was trying to head into the offseason with his 10th victory, but he gave up homers to Alex Gordon and Mike Moustakas to fall in a 3-1 hole through six innings.\nSurgery on tap: After playing in just nine games this month, second baseman Micah Johnson will undergo arthroscopic surgery to clean up his left knee Thursday.\nVentura confirmed the news Wednesday after Johnson had the knee examined. Ventura said Johnson felt he had an issue with his knee last week while the Sox were on a 10-day trip.\nVentura said he doesn't know the timetable for Johnson's recovery, and the Sox said they would provide more details on the extent of the injury after the surgery.\n\"He had something he just felt like was in there,\" Ventura said. \"Playing-wise, you just can't play your best. They did the right thing — you go in and check. It's not that big a deal, but it's enough to go in and fix it.\"\nJohnson has been plagued by injuries each of the last three years. The Sox shut him down in August last year because of a strained left hamstring, and he suffered the same injury this year, also in a muscle near the back of his knee. He had his Arizona Fall League stint cut short in 2013 because of an elbow injury.\nHe ended the year 23-for-100 with four doubles, 10 runs scored and three stolen bases.\nckane@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ChiTribKane\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Baseball Trayce Thompson Robin Ventura Chicago White Sox Jeff Samardzija Ben Zobrist", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560d391d/turbine/ct-white-sox-vs-royals-photos-spt-20150930", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560cae7b/turbine/chi-sox-royals0930b-ct0031424649-20150930", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560cae7b/turbine/chi-sox-royals0930b-ct0031424618-20150930", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560cacf5/turbine/ct-trayce-thompson-report-white-sox-spt-1001-20150930"], "published": "2015-10-01T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:04:15.128+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
