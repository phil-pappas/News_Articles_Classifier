And Dumber. That would be Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who has more money than public relations sense, and his troglodyte of a defensive lineman, Greg Hardy. You decide which is which after reading these comments: First, from Hardy, who said he would be coming out with “guns blazing’“ on Sunday afternoon when the Cowboys take on Tom Brady and the Patriots in Jones’ Pigskin Palace of Excess, otherwise known as AT&T Stadium. It was a particularly inappropriate choice of words for a man who had to sit out all but one game last season and the first four games of this year after having been found guilty by a judge of assaulting his ex-girlfriend in a disgusting display of domestic violence that included throwing her on a futon littered with several assault rifles and other weapons. Hardy’s next remarks, about Brady and his wife, supermodel Gisele Bundchen, showed similar insensitivity and ignorance: “I love seeing Tom Brady, he’s cool as crap. You seen his wife? I hope she comes to the game. I hope her sister comes to the game.” Bear in mind that, when he met with the media in the Dallas locker room last week, it was the first time he’d spoken publicly since signing with Cowboys since March and, more significantly, since he went through the NFL’s domestic violence program. Doesn’t seem like he learned a lot in that program, does it? What a fine representative of an organization that likes to call itself “America’s Team.” You’d think Jones would be appalled at this shameful sullying of his team’s brand, wouldn’t you. If so, think again. Here’s what Jones had to say about Hardy’s off-color comments: “We all know that’s just a way of expressing yourself,” Jones said of Hardy’s remark about guns. “I hope his guns are ablazin’.” After which, regarding Brady and his wife, Jones added: “When I saw him marry her (Gisele), Tom went up in my eyes 100 percent. She’s very, very attractive and it shows what an outstanding individual Tom is.” What that statement shows is what a sexist Jones is, a man who objectifies women. Cowboys coach Jason Garrett went to Princeton, so you might think he’d be a little more enlightened. Page 2 of 2 - Wrong again. “There was no bad intent, by any means,” Garrett said on Wednesday, when asked about Hardy’s outrageous statements. “I think he’s just excited to get back to playing football.” On Thursday, however, Garrett was backpedaling faster than a defensive back trying to cover Calvin Johnson on a “go” route, quickly moving into damage control mode. “That’s not how we want to operate as an organization,” he said. “Players and coaches in our organization understand that. We want to distinguish ourselves with our play, not with what we say. We define ourselves by what we do, not by what we say. Greg understands that now.” And if you believe Hardy now understands what was wrong with what he said last week — or even what he did to his ex-girlfriend last year — there are some dry oil fields in Texas I’d like to sell you. But the injury-decimated Cowboys are willing to overlook that because Hardy can rush the passer. They truly are hurtin’ Cowboys right now, with quarterback Tony Romo and all-pro wide receiver Dez Bryant atop a lengthy list of key players sidelined by injuries. And so, instead of disciplining Hardy, the Cowboys have supported him, because they need all the help they can get against the undefeated Patriots. It doesn’t appear to matter that Hardy’s comments were inappropriate, insensitive, and ignorant. Nor that he’s more repugnant than repentant. As double-digit underdogs, the Cowboys — as Hardy and Jones would say — need to come out with guns blazin’. This is the opinion of Providence Journal sports columnist Jim Donaldson.
