This will bring a change in the look and fortunes of the old ration shops. As a pilot project, the talks have already been held with dealers in Dehradun who have shown interest in the project. With around 250 ration shops spread in every nook and corner of the city, a pilot project will be first put in place in Dehradun, to be spread in the entire district. Despite the attraction of department stores, the convenient location of ration shops cannot be overlooked and continues to be their unique selling point. “Whatever you may say, the department stores have not been able to penetrate to the level of the ration shops and are keen to expose themselves at this level to gain access to every household. The government would act as a mediator and work out an arrangement with the companies on behalf of the ration shopkeepers,” said PS Pangtey, District Supply Officer. The tie up will be mutually beneficial to the companies as well as the ration shopkeeper who will lend their shops for make-over. “Here the companies will be allowed to keep select goods and also maintain a counter for the government ration. All the goods will be daily utility goods,” added PS Pangtey. According to the proposal, the margins for the company and the shopkeeper would be fixed, while the shopkeeper would continue to work in the store. In case the company finds the existing ration shops small, the owner of the ration shop would be allowed to rent another shop so that it suits the specifications of the company. Further, in this arrangement the consumer’s complaint about the ration shops remain open for few hours will also be addressed, as the new stores will have to remain open for longer hours. Significantly in 1991, when Uttarakhand was part of Uttar Pradesh, orders were issued to the ration shop owners allowing to keep daily utility items such as face cream, powder, soap etc at the ration shops. “The order continues to remain effective. In the hilly districts some ration shop owners were successful in implementing the order. While, the others were not able to do so,” said SS Pandey, Joint Commissioner, Department of Food and Civil Supplies.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:15:36.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
