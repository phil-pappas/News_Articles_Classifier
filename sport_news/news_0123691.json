Not on fourth-and-1, not on third-and-2 with the game on the line, not in overtime, not on the goal line.\n\"Umm, I'll never turn it down if they call my number. I can't say I need the ball every time.\"\nMaybe he should, at least Monday night in San Diego, where the third-worst rush defense resides. The Chargers have allowed nearly 5 yards per rush. Bell became the first to rush for over 100 yards against the Baltimore Ravens in 30 games when he gained 129 last week with a 5.9 average. It's the first time a Steelers back had eclipsed 100 yards rushing against Baltimore since Jerome Bettis did it in 2004.\nThe Steelers have Mike Vick at quarterback in place of injured Ben Roethlisberger and, while he has not thrown an interception or lost a fumble, he was sacked four times by the Ravens. His 19 completions on 26 passes yielded only 124 yards, 5 fewer than Bell had rushing.\nThey always search for a mix on offense, but when someone is handing out $100 bills, why look for another to issue $20s?\nAs a whole, the Steelers average 4.3 yards per carry, counting quarterback kneel-downs and such. But the only two runners that matter are Bell, who has 191 yards in two games with a 4.7-yard average per carry, and DeAngelo Williams, who has 211 yards and led the AFC in rushing in his two starts while Bell served a two-game suspension and averages 4.8 yards.\nThose two combined have four runs longer than 20 yards, tied for second most in the NFL, with three of them Bell's.\nIt sounds good to his linemen.\n\"Teams are going to be honed in on him because Ben is not back there to throw the ball,\" guard Ramon Foster said. \"But our blocking has been there. Le'Veon and DeAngelo have both seen the holes.\"\nBell called it \"great chemistry\" with his offensive linemen.\n\"We're confident we can run the ball on anybody,\" Bell said. \"Baltimore didn't give up a 100-yard rusher in I don't know how many games. And we got 100 yards. Obviously, the guys up front just got to do their job, I'm going to try to do my best to do mine and, as long as we're on the same page, I'm confident we'll run the ball.\"\nHis coaches did not give him that chance in two crucial spots in overtime against Baltimore. On third-and-2 at the Ravens 39, Vick threw incomplete to Antonio Brown and, on fourth down, Vick ran wide left for no gain.\nBack at Baltimore's 34 on their next series, on third-and-2 Vick threw a pass short left to Bell, who had no chance and picked up 1 yard. On fourth down, Vick threw incomplete to an open Brown.\nThere were no complaints from Bell.\n\"They were in cover zero, obviously they expected me to get the ball,\" he said of the packed-in Ravens defense on that last fourth down. \"They were all-out everybody in the middle. We had the right call, we just didn't execute it.\"\nBell weighed 240 pounds at Michigan State, 235 at the combine. He weighs 220 today and says what he gained in quickness he did not lose in toughness.\n\"I want to be known as a guy who is good in any situations, third-and-long, short yardage, goal-line, whatever it may be. I feel I can go out there and get a yard, inches.\"\nMonday night, maybe he will get the chance, even when the game's on the line and the Chargers defense knows what's coming.\n(c)2015 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1735812", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1735812&h=Steelers+RB+Bell+wants+ball%2C+but+he+isn%27t+inclined+to+ask+for+it", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1735812&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:58:50.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
