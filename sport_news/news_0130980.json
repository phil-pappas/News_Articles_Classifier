Do you say something or stay out of it?\n\"This is a tough question. I guess it depends. As with those psychological studies of whether people are prepared to help a stranger in need, whether I informed on the thief might depend on the mood I was in, whether I was in a hurry and whether informing would put me in danger.\n\"I think the 'right' thing to do, from a purely ethical point of view, would be to inform on the thief to the owners of the property. A Buddhist is obliged to ask, of course, would informing be a compassionate response? Informing would certainly be the compassionate response toward the innocent shop owners, who face losing property through no fault of their own. Would informing be compassionate toward the thief? We could argue so, in that the thief needs to face the consequences of the thieving as soon as possible rather than be allowed to keep offending, possibly becoming increasingly bold with each new offense. Compassion is not about suspending justice.\n\"I find it useful, when trying to decide what a compassionate response would be, to ask, 'What if it were my child?' Again, I would not want my son to get away with the theft. I would want him brought to justice, to suffer some pain in the short term, to hopefully prevent him from moving on to larger crimes.\n\"Then again, my answer might change if the thief appeared to be a homeless, destitute or desperate person. Perhaps thieving is the only way they can survive or support their family. An enlightened being might take time to talk to the thief and come up with practical assistance, even offering to pay for the stolen goods. Personally, I have not reached this level of spiritual development yet. In that case, the unfortunate truth is that I would probably leave the store feeling disturbed and powerless to act.\"\n— Sarah Napthali , author of multiple books on Buddhism, including the recent \"Buddhism for Couples: A Calm Approach to Relationships\" (Tarcher)\n\"Shoplifting, whether it be by a customer or a store employee, is wrong. In the long run, each of us shoppers pays more because stores lose products and money through shoplifting. Stores make up the cost by charging other shoppers more. Because of this, you would be helping yourself and others by getting involved.\n\"The question is: How to do that? How involved do you want to get? I think few people would be comfortable taking some type of direct action, such as confronting an individual we believe to be a shoplifter. It may be more practical, and also safer, to alert a store security guard or a store employee of your suspicions or what you saw. These people are trained to handle situations like shoplifting. Most shoppers are not.\"\n— Steve J.
