Look at what the Wildcats have given up their past four games. 50, 56, 30, 28. \nThe Eagles should be able to up that average. \n% Jake’s Pick: Cold Springs \n% Rob’s Pick: Cold Springs \nNorth Jackson (5-3, 5-1 in 4A, R7) at Good Hope (2-6, 1-5) \nThe Raiders are tumbling. \nThe Chiefs are rising. \nGood Hope has dropped three straight contests — being outscored by a robust 108-28 margin over that stretch — and has to deal with a seriously underrated North Jackson squad that seems to be hitting its stride. \nAfter dropping three of their first five games, the Chiefs have reeled off three consecutive wins and have scored at least 44 points in each outing. \nThat spells bad news for a struggling Raider defense. \nNorth Jackson won last year’s game 62-14 in the lone meeting between the two programs. \n% Jake’s Pick: North Jackson \n% Rob’s Pick: North Jackson \nHolly Pond (0-8, 0-5 in 3A, R5) at Winfield (7-1, 5-0) \nThe past two Friday’s have been simply heartbreaking for the Broncos. \nAfter surrendering a late touchdown to Vinemont in a 29-25 affair, they blew a 20-point lead versus Hanceville en route to 60-50 defeat last week. \nTwenty-eight losses and counting. \nIt won’t get any easier tonight, either. \nHolly Pond travels to face No. 10 Winfield, which has won seven bouts in a row by an average of 23.5 points per game. \nUnfortunately, I think the Green and White’s best chance for a win has already come and gone. \n% Jake’s Pick: Winfield \n% Rob’s Pick: Winfield \nWinston County (5-3, 2-3 in 3A, R5) at Vinemont (1-7, 1-4) \nThe Eagles’ dream of a second straight playoff appearance officially ended after a road loss to Susan Moore last Friday. \nNow, it’s all about playing for pride. \nVinemont will look to send its seniors out with one more region triumph as the Yellow Jackets buzz into town tonight. \nAlthough Winston County has been up and down this season, the Eagle nation will need to turn out a sensational showing in order to come away with the upset. \nCan they? Absolutely. \nWill they? It’ll be tough. \n% Jake’s Pick: Winston County \n% Rob’s Pick: Winston County \nCullman Christian (7-0) at Marion Academy (3-3) \nThe Lions enter tonight’s game undefeated on the season. \nThey’ve tallied 293 points and yielded just 37 en route to a perfect start. \nTake the hint, Panthers. \n% Jake’s Pick: Cullman Christian \n% Rob’s Pick: Cullman Christian \nWest Point (4-4, 3-3 in 5A, R8) at Lawrence County (4-4, 3-3) \nCheck out Thursday’s Times or visit www.cullmantimes.com for an in- depth look at this crucial region matchup. \n% Jake’s Pick: West Point \n% Rob’s Pick: West Point \nSusan Moore (3-5, 3-2 in 3A, R5) at Hanceville (3-5, 3-2) \nPick up a copy of Thursday’s Times or visit www.cullmantimes.com to take in a preview of this pivotal region game. \n% Jake’s Pick: Hanceville \n% Rob’s Pick: Susan Moore \n% Jake’s Record to Date: 51-16 \n% Rob’s Record to Date: 51-16 \n% Jake Winfrey can be reached at 256-734-2131, ext. 136 or at jwinfrey@cullmantimes.com.​ Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T17:04:44.567+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
