Roberts is charged with first-degree attempted murder and first-degree aggravated assault.\nAttorneys gave their opening arguments Wednesday in a trial that will probe the gang culture inside Park Hill, a community that for years has struggled with drugs and violence. Already, neighborhood loyalties have been tested among witnesses, including another activist who admitted he did not want to testify but was compelled by a subpoena.\nAt the time of the shooting, Roberts was seen as a sign of hope, a former gang member who was working to improve his neighborhood and the lives of the young people who lived there.\nHis arrest bewildered his supporters, including public officials and police who had worked with him.\nThe shooting happened in front of the Boys & Girls Club in Holly Square, the centerpiece of the Park Hill neighborhood, just before a peace rally that Roberts had organized.\nAdvertisement On Wednesday, Alma Staub, a prosecutor in the Denver district attorney's office, told the jury that Roberts and Jones had gotten into an argument before the event.\nJones was turning away from the confrontation when Roberts pulled a 9 mm handgun from his waistband and shot Jones in the back.\nJones fell, skidded across the ground and lay motionless in Holly Square, Staub said.\n\"Witnesses will tell you Terrance Roberts stands over Hasan Jones, who is on the ground because he has been shot, stands over him and shoots him two more times,\" Staub said.\nAfterward, Roberts tossed a folding knife onto Jones' limp body. Later, Roberts would tell police that the knife belonged to Jones, but investigators found Roberts' DNA inside the knife, not Jones', Staub said.\nThree witnesses to the shooting told the jury that Roberts first fired as Jones turned away and that Roberts stood over his body, firing more rounds and yelling at him.\nMarshal Seufert, Roberts' public defender, said tension had been brewing between Roberts and the Bloods and, that day, Roberts truly believed the gangsters were coming to kill him.\nBefore the shooting, word had been spreading through the neighborhood that the Bloods no longer were on Roberts' side. He was accused of being a snitch after people saw him sweeping shell casings from a sidewalk after a shooting and because of security cameras on the roof of his office.\nPeople also were angry at Roberts for bringing National Geographic's \"Drugs Inc.\" television show into the neighborhood, which cast Park Hill in a negative light and brought unwanted attention to the gang, Seufert said.\n\"You'll understand by the end of the trial being a former gang member is tough,\" Seufert said. \"Being a former gang member who helps the police is a lot tougher. Being a former gang member who helps the police and who locates himself in the center of the Park Hill Bloods is even tougher still.\"\nJust before the shooting, a Blood had openly called Roberts a snitch. Then someone yelled from a red pickup truck, \"On Bloods, you're going to get yours in a minute.\" Both were direct threats, Seufert said.\nBefore his arrest, Roberts had spent eight years trying to improve Park Hill and lead other gang members away from the lifestyle. He formed Prodigal Son, a non-profit, anti-gang youth organization.\nHe also led a charge to transform Holly Square, the center of the Park Hill neighborhood, after it was firebombed by a rival gang in May 2008.\nRoberts had even counseled Jones, who was a gang member.\nOn Wednesday, Jones, who is confined to a wheelchair, refused to testify on behalf of the prosecution.\nJones is in the Arapahoe County jail facing a charge of child abuse resulting in death for the August 2014 death of 2-year-old Ny'Ari Hines, who was his girlfriend's daughter.\nGregory Daniels, an attorney for Jones, said his client did not want to cooperate with Denver prosecutors who previously tried him on attempted murder charges. Jones was acquitted by a jury in July.\nAs Jones agreed to be punished rather than speak, he sat just inches from Roberts. Neither man looked at the other.\nNoelle Phillips: 303-954-1661, nphillips@denverpost.com or @Noelle_Phillips", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:34:22.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
