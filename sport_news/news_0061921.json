The spokeswoman also didn't know if the fan was rooting for the Wolverines or the visiting Spartans. \nIt was a busy day in and around Michigan Stadium for medical personnel and police. \nBrown says 76 people needed treatment, including 12 that were taken to the hospital. Seven were arrested, including four for minors in possession of alcohol, two for disorderly conduct and one for resisting and obstructing.
