So that’s now four goals in the first three games for Lindberg, certainly making an impression to start his NHL career.\n“I don’t think he’s going to continue on a 80-someodd-goal pace, but players go through these stretches,” coach Alain Vigneault said. “I need him to be very effective at both ends. But he’s got some really timely, important goals.”\nLindberg became the first rookie in franchise history to score in each of the team’s first three games of a season, and he’s the first rookie since Steven King in 1992-93 to score in his first three games with the team.\n“I don’t try to overthink it,” the 24-year-old said. “I’m just trying to play. Coming in today, with this crowd and everything, it was a special feeling. Winning three games, the first three games, and to be able to score a goal, too — it’s pretty special, for sure.”\nThis training camp was just about the last chance for Lindberg, who would have needed waivers to be sent back to AHL Hartford. So he had arguably the best preseason of anyone on the roster, and he’s still trying to prove he belongs.\n“You still want to show the coaching staff and everyone that I belong here,” he said.\nVigneault decided it was time for rugged winger Tanner Glass to get his first game, and so he replaced Jesper Fast on the fourth line. The Blue Jackets are known as a physical team, and Glass specializes in taking the body and being able to spar if needed.\n“I think it was an element that we needed in tonight’s game,” Vigneault said. “They came out hard [Friday] night and I think we responded well. But in our home building, I thought that Tanner would be a big help and I think he played a strong game.”\nThe other possibility to come out of the lineup might have been Jarret Stoll, the veteran center who signed as a free agent this offseason. But he has apparently gained the trust of Vigneault.\n“I thought for the most part, what we had expected is what we’re seeing,” Vigneault said before the game about Stoll. “Like any veteran player, training camp, he was feeling his way. But for the first two games, he’s come to play and he’s played well.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:12:30.115+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
