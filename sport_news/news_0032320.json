Trent Domingue lined up to kick a 33-yard field goal, but holder Brad Kragthorpe stood up and threw a slightly backwards pass to his left as Domingue ran toward the flat. He caught it and scored untouched on what was ruled a 16-yard touchdown run. \nKragthorpe, a senior walk-on, is the son of former LSU offensive coordinator Steve Kragthorpe, who remains on staff as a special assistant to Miles. \nMiles used a similar play to win 33-29 at Florida in 2010. The Tigers faked a 53-yard field goal when holder Derek Helton tossed the ball over his head to kicker Josh Jasper, who picked up the bouncing ball and gained enough yards for a first down to keep the game winning touchdown drive alive in the final minutes. Miles used that same play in 2007 with holder Matt Flynn flipping perfectly to kicker Colt David for a touchdown in the Tigers' 28-16 win over Spurrier and South Carolina. \nThe Gators (6-1, 4-1 SEC) came right back and threatened to score, but faced a third-and-22 from the LSU 35-yard line after an intentional grounding call against Florida quarterback Treon Harris while under a heavy rush. Harris then apparently completed a 35-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Antonio Callaway, but safety Dwayne Thomas hit Callaway as the ball arrived. And Callaway coughed it up. Florida had to punt. \nThe Tigers stopped two more Florida drives in the final minutes to preserve the victory. \nLSU appeared on the verge of running away with it as it took a 28-14 halftime lead on a 50-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Brandon Harris to wide receiver Malachi Dupre with 15 seconds to go in the second quarter. The Tigers had the Gators out-gained 304 yards to 144 at the break, but that dominance did not last. \nThe Gators erased that deficit in the third quarter to tie it at 28-28 entering the fourth quarter as LSU's special teams flaw bit them again. Florida tied the game on a 72-yard punt return by Callaway with 1:04 to go in the third quarter. \nFlorida cut LSU's lead to 28-21 on its first possession of the third quarter after LSU ran three plays and punted. The Gators in turn drove 66 yards in 10 plays as Harris hit tight end DeAndre Goolsby for a 30-yard gain and rambled for a 17-yard gain. Tailback Kelvin Taylor scored on a 2-yard run on third and goal with 8:01 to play in the period. \nLSU went three-and-out again on its next possession. \nHarris finished 13 of 19 for 202 yards and two touchdowns and had a nearly flawless first half, completing 10 of 12 passes for 189 yards. LSU tailback Leonard Fournette gained 180 yards on 31 carries with two touchdowns. Florida's Harris was 17 of 32 for 271 yards and two touchdowns. LSU's defense held the Gators to 55 rushing yards on 31 carries and sacked Harris five times with three by defensive end Lewis Neal. \nOn Harris' 50-yard touchdown pass to Dupre for the 28-14 lead, he scrambled right, broke a tackle, spotted Dupre deep, set and let it fly. \nDupre adjusted to the ball, made the catch at the 5-yard line and eluded two tacklers to score. Harris also found Dupre on a 9-yard touchdown pass in second quarter for a 14-7 lead. Dupre, who caught four passes for 115 yards in the first half and finished with those numbers, also caught a 52-yard, razzle-dazzle pass from Harris to set up a 6-yard touchdown run by Fournette for a 21-7 LSU lead with 2:24 to go in the second quarter. \nOn the play, Harris pitched to Fournette, who ran up the middle, turned and pitched it back to Harris, who unleashed it deep for Dupre. \nLSU could have led by more than 28-14 at the break as it gift wrapped the Gators' first touchdown of the game when Tre'Davious White fumbled a punt return as he tried to field a bouncing ball. Florida took over on the Tigers' 13-yard line and scored on fourth-and-one on a 4-yard pass from Harris to tight end Jake McGee for a 7-0 lead with 10:13 to go in the first quarter. \nThe Gators' only other touchdown in the first half came on a blown coverage by LSU's defense as Harris found McGee all alone for a 19-yard touchdown with 1:34 to go before halftime. One play before that, Harris just eluded a sack and threw deep for Callaway, who made an acrobatic catch for a 48-yard gain.
