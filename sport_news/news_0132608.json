She will read from Accidental Saints and take questions from the audience at 7 p.m. at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral, 147 N.W. 19th Ave.\nAhead of her appearance at Trinity, I talked briefly with Bolz-Webber about fostering a diverse community while welcoming the mainstream, leading confession by example and lifting barbells in her free time. (This conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity.)\nYou've described your church as a place where atheists, agnostics, evangelicals -- people of all spiritual flavors -- come together. How do you foster that kind of community?\nPeople have been given a very narrow band of choices in terms of what it looks like to be Christian. If you happen to be somebody who fits in that mold, you're fine. But if you don't, then you have two choices: You can either stay in the church and have it be very uncomfortable, or you can leave the church. A lot of people have left the church, and I don't think it's because they find that the teachings of Jesus are not compelling to them or that the deeply worn rituals of the church don't speak to them. I think it's because there is this very narrow definition of what it looks like to be Christian.\nPeople are done with pretending. People are done pretending they're not really gay or pretending that everything about being a new mom is wonderful or pretending that they aren't struggling with mental health issues. A lot of churches have become places where there are endless opportunities to pretend everything's fine. If they aren't being asked to pretend, and they aren't being asked to intellectually assent to a set of theological propositions to belong to a community, I've found they actually want to show up. They want to receive the sacraments, they want to hear about Jesus.\nYou've spoken before about struggling to welcome people you considered normal or mainstream to your congregation of outsiders. I think that's a relevant experience for Portland readers. Can you talk a little about that?\nSometimes the margins become our own center and we marginalize what we perceive as being the center. We other-ize those who are not as marginal as ourselves. It turns on itself, but it's the same sin. If all I did was talk about how cool we are because we're marginalized and not mainstream -- it might be interesting for a minute, but there's no power in it.\nYou've said that you don't really care about your congregants' beliefs or actions, at least not as a basis for belonging in the community. If your job isn't to encourage certain beliefs and behaviors, what is your role?\nMy job is to pay attention. What are people struggling with? How are they reacting to things happening in the world? What are the inconsistencies in themselves that they find bothersome? What is the source of their joy and their love for each other? My preaching is very much for this community.\nI'm just supposed to confess my faith -- and my faith as it looks in a particular community in a particular time. I have seen changes in people's lives that are just simply a result of hearing that they are children of God. They are not defined by the worst things they've done or the best things they've done.\nYou've talked about leading by example -- not by being the perfect example of piety, but by being an example of someone clinging to and in need of grace. What does that look like on Sundays?\nIn my preaching I often confess something that is hard for me. Jesus says to forgive your enemies, pray for your enemies. I'll be very blunt in my sermon about why I struggle with that. What is the prideful thing about me that makes that hard? That allows people to sort of exhale instead of of pulling in their spiritual stomachs. It's a form of leadership I call \"screw it, I'll go first.\"\nY ou've been interviewed many times. What is something you don't normally get to talk about, but wish you could?\nNobody wants to hear about CrossFit. Nobody in the media cares how much I can clean-and-jerk. The answer, by the way, is 156 pounds. I have shoulder meat.\nMy spiritual practice is lifting heavy sh-t. A physical life is a spiritual life. The day-after-day practice of insuring I have a strong body and challenging myself allows my brain to shut off and allows me to be just a creature in a way that nothing else does.\n-- Melissa Binder\nmbinder@oregonian.com\n503-294-7656\n@binderpdx", "external_links": ["http://www.npr.org/2015/09/17/441139500/lutheran-minister-preaches-a-gospel-of-love-to-junkies-drag-queens-and-outsiders", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1601427557", "http://twitter.com/binderpdx"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:03:30.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
