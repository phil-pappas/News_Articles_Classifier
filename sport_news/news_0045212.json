Now he'll sit in favor of the physically imposing McIlrath, 23, the 10th overall pick in the 2010 draft whose development has been slowed by injuries.\n\"I want to get a look at Dylan,\" coach Alain Vigneault said. \"He had a real good camp and we're playing against a team that has a little bit more size. I think Boyler can play a little better than he has so far.\"\nBoyle, once one of the NHL's top offensive-minded defensemen and power-play quarterbacks, had nine goals and 11 assists last season but his skating and decision-making in the defensive zone has continued to be an issue. He has one assist, setting up the Rangers' lone power-play goal of the season in Saturday's 5-2 win over the Blue Jackets. The Rangers have had just four power plays in three games.\nHis place on the man advantage will be taken by Kevin Klein, known for his steady defense though he had a career-high nine goals last season and goalie Henrik Lundqvist said his shot is the hardest on the team.\nStill, Vigneault has been reluctant to use Klein on the power play.\n\"I played a little in the preseason but it's been a long time since I played in the season,\" Klein said. \"But, playing on the penalty kill, you see a lot of power plays.\"\nAt even strength, Klein will be paired with Marc Staal while McIlrath will start the game paired with the offensive-minded Keith Yandle.\nFor McIlrath, it will mark his fourth NHL game. His lone one last season came in a 4-3 loss to the Blues at the Garden on Nov. 3 that featured Vladimir Tarasenko blowing past McIlrath, among other Rangers, for a one-handed goal that was one of the NHL's top highlights of the season.\n\"Obviously a far ways,\" McIlrath said when asked how far his game has come since that unfortunate outing. \"When I got sent back down, I just really tried to work on my game in Hartford. I have a really good playoff run under my belt now and I have played in some big games, important minutes. I think I've matured as a hockey player.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:31:23.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
