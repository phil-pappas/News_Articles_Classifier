GAAP revenue rose 6.8 percent to US$1.23 billion, falling short of the average analyst estimate of US$1.26 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. \nBy generally accepted accounting principles, search revenue came in at $509 million for the third quarter of 2015, up 13%, compared with the year-ago quarter. \" Google's offerings complement the search services provided by Microsoft, which remains a strong partner, as well as Yahoo's own search technologies and ad products\". The deal with Google was among a few of the positive markers in the company's third-quarter results statement. Google will be paying Yahoo parts of the ad revenues, while Yahoo will be paying fees to Google for image search results or web algorithmic search results. \nApart from its Alibaba stake, Doshi said he'd be watching for growth in Yahoo's mobile , video, native advertising and social spaces. \nThe amount Yahoo pays to attract users to its website almost quadrupled to $223m from $54m. Yahoo plans to return to shareholders the rest of its Alibaba holdings - more than 380 million shares - in a tax-free spinoff planned for this winter. \nThis comes as the company's second attempt to profit from Google's expertise in internet search and advertising. Revenue in native advertising dipped from $1.09 to $1.0 billion and Yahoo is still expecting it to go down to $920 to $960 million in this quarter. \nYahoo! Inc . reported its biggest quarterly sales drop since 2009 and gave a fourth-quarter forecast that missed analysts' estimates, as a turnaround effort led by Chief Executive Officer Marissa Mayer enters its fourth year without any substantial revenue growth. \nOn CNBC's \"Fast Money\" on Monday, Doshi laid out the most important things he'll be looking for when Yahoo reports third-quarter results after Tuesday's close. As for whether the Internal Revenue Service will seek taxes after the spin-off, CEO Marissa Mayer says that Yahoo's legal team is confident that the Abaco transaction would be \"tax efficient under current law\". \nYahoo's earnings also plunged 99 percent to $76 million, or 8 cents per share, during the three months ended in September. \nThe deal with Google builds on an existing search partnership with Microsoft under which Yahoo gets a percentage of revenue from ads displayed on its sites.
