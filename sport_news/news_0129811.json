Posted: Monday, October 19, 2015 11:46 pm VOLLEYBALL SECTIONAL PREVIEW CAPSULES By   19,   \nArea sectionals will begin tonight with Charlestown hosting Class 3A No. 8 Silver Creek in the first round of the Class 3A Charlestown Sectional. \nThe Clark-Floyd area will try to continue its recent success in the state tournament. Class 3A No. 2 Providence, which moved up one class this season because of the IHSAA’s success-factor rule, has won the last two Class 2A state championships. \nClass A No. 3 Christian Academy was last year’s Class A state runner-up. \nHere is a breakdown of each sectional involving area teams this season: \nCLASS 4A JENNINGS COUNTY SECTIONAL \n• INDIANAPREPVOLLEYBALL.COM Z-RATINGS: Floyd Central 19 (4A No. 16), Seymour 53 (31), New Albany 78 (43), Bedford North Lawrence 80 (45), Jeffersonville 150 (59), Jennings County 201 (75). \n• FAVORITE: Floyd Central (23-10). The two-time defending sectional champion Highlanders have the talent and depth to make a run at their third consecutive sectional title. \n• SERIOUS CONTENDERS: Seymour (17-11) and Bedford North Lawrence (18-12). The Owls enter the sectional on a hot streak, winning eight of their last nine matches. One of those eight victories was against Silver Creek. The Stars come into the sectional with an above-.500 record and a reasonable draw. \n• DARK HORSES: New Albany (15-17). Despite the below-.500 record, the Bulldogs are battle-tested thanks to a challenging regular-season schedule. Plus they have one of the best players in the sectional in sophomore Allyson Cathey. \n• TOUGHEST ROAD: Seymour. The Owls will face the Highlanders in Saturday’s second semifinal. If Seymour wins, then it will most likely take on either Bedford or New Albany in the championship match. Both of those teams should know the Owls very well since they are Hoosier Hills Conference rivals. \n• EASIEST PATH: New Albany. If the Bulldogs can get past Bedford in Thursday’s sectional opener, they will be favored to win Saturday’s first semifinal between either Jeffersonville (13-18) or Jennings County (6-18). \n• MOST COMPELLING MATCHUP: Floyd Central vs. Seymour, semifinal. The streaking Owls have the best shot at ending the Highlanders’ two-year reign as sectional champions. \n• PLAYER TO WATCH: Cathey. The New Albany middle hitter had a solid freshman season in 2014, and she has improved even more this year. She has the skills to carry the Bulldogs to at least the sectional final. \n• PREDICTED CHAMPION: Floyd Central. \nCLASS 3A CHARLESTOWN SECTIONAL \n• INDIANAPREPVOLLEYBALL.COM Z-RATINGS: Providence 5 (3A No. 2), Silver Creek 29 (7), Brownstown Central 98 (27), Scottsburg 136 (41), Charlestown 282 (75), Corydon Central 307 (81), Salem 334 (87). \n• FAVORITE: Providence (30-3). The Pioneers have reloaded their roster quite nicely this season after graduating five seniors — three of which signed NCAA Division I letters of intent — from last year’s Class 2A state championship squad. Providence has not lost a beat. \n• SERIOUS CONTENDERS: Silver Creek (26-7). The Dragons have the talent to compete with the Pioneers. Plus their tough regular-season schedule should prepare them for this year’s sectional. \n• DARK HORSES: Scottsburg (22-11) and Brownstown (13-16). The Warriors have grown as a program this season under new coach D.J. Zipp, a Providence graduate and a former head coach at Borden. This year’s Brownstown team is not as talented as past Brave squads. But Brownstown still plays a difficult regular-season slate that prepares it for the postseason. \n• TOUGHEST ROAD: Providence. The Pioneers will take on Brownstown in Thursday’s first-round match, then possibly Scottsburg in Saturday’s semifinal. Providence should be pushed a little bit in those two matches before a potential showdown with Silver Creek in the title match. \n• EASIEST PATH: Silver Creek. The Dragons will play Charlestown (7-21), which is still going through a rebuilding process, in tonight’s opener. If Silver Creek wins, it will take on struggling Corydon (5-17) in Saturday’s first semifinal. \n• MOST COMPELLING MATCHUP: Silver Creek vs. Providence, championship. If the Clark County rivals meet in Saturday’s final, it will be a gauge to see how much the Dragons have improved since they got swept by the Pioneers in both teams’ season opener in August. \n• PLAYER TO WATCH: Lexie Libs. The Providence junior setter has done a great job this season replacing the Pioneers’ ex-All-State setter, Patricia Mattingly. Libs has been efficient in getting the ball to the Pioneer sister duo of Jacquie and Marissa Hornung. \n• PREDICTED CHAMPION: Providence. \nCLASS 2A CLARKSVILLE SECTIONAL \n• INDIANAPREPVOLLEYBALL.COM Z-RATINGS: Henryville 83 (2A No. 12), Clarksville 187 (34), Paoli 222 (43), Eastern 229 (45), Crawford County 323 (84). \n• FAVORITE: Henryville (27-5). The Hornets are loaded with experience and the only team in the sectional field that has played consistently well throughout the season. \n• SERIOUS CONTENDERS: Clarksville (16-15). Even though they have fallen below their preseason expectations, the Generals still have the talent to win a sectional title. Plus they host the sectional, which is something they have looked forward to doing all season. \n• DARK HORSE: Eastern (17-15). The Musketeers enter the sectional with some momentum, prevailing in nine of their last 13 matches. That late-season flourish helped Eastern finish the regular season above .500. \n• TOUGHEST ROAD: Clarksville. The Generals will begin sectional action Thursday with a first-round match against Paoli (16-17), which ended the regular season winning five of its last seven matches. If Clarksville beats the Rams, it must defeat Henryville in Saturday’s second semifinal. A victory over the Hornets most likely has the Generals facing a hot Eastern squad. \n• EASIEST PATH: Eastern. The Musketeers will play lowly Crawford County (5-15) in Saturday’s first semi. But the Wolfpack did win a set versus Eastern in a four-set loss more than two weeks ago. \n• MOST COMPELLING MATCHUP: Henryville vs. Clarksville, semifinal. These are the two most talented teams in the sectional, and each squad has some experience. The Hornets defeated the Generals in four sets last month. \n• PLAYER TO WATCH: Carolyn Hawkins. The Generals' junior middle hitter can pretty much do it all. Hawkins smacks kills and is a great blocker. She also can play defense and is an effective server. \n• PREDICTED CHAMPION: Henryville. \nCLASS A CHRISTIAN ACADEMY SECTIONAL \n• INDIANAPREPVOLLEYBALL.COM Z-RATINGS: Christian Academy 44 (A No. 2), South Central 304 (58), New Washington 338 (71), Lanesville 354 (76), Rock Creek 360 (79), Madison Shawe 368 (82). \n• FAVORITE: Christian Academy (24-8). The Warriors have the most talent, the most experience and are the most battle-tested thanks to a challenging regular-season slate. On top of that, they host this year’s sectional. \n• SERIOUS CONTENDERS: South Central (7-13). The Rebels have the second-best record in the sectional and got a good draw with one of the two first-round byes. \n• DARK HORSES: New Washington (4-19). Despite their struggles, the Mustangs have some athletes who could give the Warriors and Rebels fits. \n• TOUGHEST ROAD: New Washington. The Mustangs must get past a Southern Athletic Conference rival in South Central in Saturday’s second semifinal and probably Christian Academy in the final to collect this year’s sectional crown. \n• EASIEST PATH: Christian Academy. Even though the Warriors need to win three matches to capture their fourth consecutive sectional title, they will face struggling Lanesville in Thursday’s sectional opener and either a young Rock Creek team or Madison Shawe (4-16) in Saturday’s first semi. \n• MOST COMPELLING MATCHUP: South Central vs. New Washington, semifinal. The Mustangs did win a set in their four-set setback to the Rebels last week. Both teams know each other really well since they are conference rivals. \n• PLAYER TO WATCH: Sierra Rayzor. When the Christian Academy junior middle hitter is on her game alongside Warrior sophomore standout Alli Stumler, Rayzor makes CAI even more powerful. \n• PREDICTED CHAMPION: Christian Academy. \nCLASS A ORLEANS SECTIONAL \n• INDIANAPREPVOLLEYBALL.COM Z-RATINGS: Trinity Lutheran 117 (A No. 14), Orleans 275 (53), Crothersville 288 (55), Borden 312 (59), West Washington 366 (81), Medora 378 (89). \n• FAVORITE: Trinity Lutheran (19-9). The Cougars have won four sectional championships in the last five years, and they seemed poised to collect another title this week. \n• SERIOUS CONTENDERS: Orleans (12-10). The Bulldogs ended the regular season winning six of their last nine matches. They could have added a couple more victories in that stretch if they found a way to win five-set matches with Eastern and Mitchell. Plus Orleans has the home-court advantage. \n• DARK HORSE: Borden (7-22). The Braves have played a fairly tough schedule this year and they have challenged a few above-.500 opponents in 2015. For instance, Borden lost two sets to one to Eastern in a tournament and fell in a five-setter with the rival Musketeers in their regular-season matchup. \n• TOUGHEST ROAD: Borden. The Braves will face conference rival Crothersville in the sectional opener Thursday, then possibly Trinity Lutheran in Saturday’s first semifinal. \n• EASIEST PATH: Orleans. The Bulldogs will take on lowly Medora in Saturday’s second semi before probably playing Trinity Lutheran in the final. The Cougars will have two matches under their belts before Orleans plays it first sectional match. \n• MOST COMPELLING MATCHUP: Trinity Lutheran vs. Orleans, championship. Can the Bulldogs’ first-round bye and playing at home be enough to knock off the favored Cougars? \n• PLAYER TO WATCH: Haylee Barker. The Trinity Lutheran senior setter leads the offensively-balanced Cougars in kills and assists. \n• PREDICTED CHAMPION: Trinity Lutheran. \nCLASS 4A JENNINGS COUNTY SECTIONAL \nFIRST ROUND \nBedford North Lawrence vs. New Albany, 6 p.m. \nJennings County vs. Jeffersonville, 7:30 p.m. \nSEMIFINALS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:11:29.713+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
