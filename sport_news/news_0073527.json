The respected FiveThirtyEight blog run by Nate Silver has them with 27 wins. USA Today weighed in with 20 wins. And NBA.com weighed in with the annual general manager survey and had little good to say about the Knicks or their star, Carmelo Anthony.\nIt’s hard to blame the forecasters after the Knicks’ 17-65 performance last season and a summer that yielded little immediate star power, filling the roster with serviceable veterans and two promising rookies. But with health and maybe little else right now, the Knicks shrugged off the predictions and promised to use them instead as motivation.\n\"I think we’ll be better than what people predict,\" Anthony said. \"If people are predicting 27 wins, I laugh at that. We use that as kind of motivation. It’s a good thing to kind of be under the radar. I know what type of team we have. It’s just a matter of going out there and putting it together.\"\nStill, the Knicks have been cautious about predictions after team president Phil Jackson started last year with a promise that his squad would be a playoff team.\nThis year Jackson refused to put a number on his expectations and the Knicks have been using words like competitive, or the one that coach Derek Fisher opted for Tuesday, process. The predictions last year clung to them as the season imploded.\n\"We all did [make predictions], not just the guys,\" Fisher said. \"When you get into predicting what should happen in a season that’s eight months, you don’t know who’s going to get injured. You don’t know who’s going to get traded. It’s impossible to get caught up in that.\n\"For me as a first-year coach, I think learning from that, it really takes me back to playing on teams that actually won championships. Every year we didn’t try to guess how many games we were going to win. We just had one goal. For our team this year our goal is the process of becoming good. However far that takes us, then we start to work from there. But we have to build a foundation for success.\"\nThe foundation perhaps needs to come quickly. HBO released more words from Madison Square Garden chairman James Dolan and his pal and current Liberty president Isiah Thomas, this time focusing on the possibility that Thomas could return to the Knicks, where he once served as coach and then as Garden president. Though Dolan said he couldn’t envision bringing Thomas back to the Knicks, Thomas was asked about it and deferred, \"That’s a slippery slope question. I can comfortably tell you this: I don’t see myself ever coaching the New York Knicks.\"\nThat may not seem reassuring to Jackson or current GM Steve Mills.\n\"Hopefully we’re in position to accomplish certain goals in terms of numbers of wins and postseason,\" Fisher said. \"But in October we’re kidding ourselves if we’re thinking that far ahead. We’ve got to be focused on literally tomorrow’s practice. That’s how much focus we should have on getting better every day.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:41:25.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
