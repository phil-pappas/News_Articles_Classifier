Spiller on the second play of overtime as the New Orleans Saints upended the Dallas Cowboys 26-20 in overtime Sunday night at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome.\nDallas falls to 2-2. The Cowboys, who had their 10-game road winning streak broken, host New England next Sunday.\nNew Orleans moves to 1-3.\nBrandon Weeden threw a 17-yard touchdown to Terrance Williams with 1:51 left in regulation.\nNew Orleans drove to the Cowboys' 12 where Zach Hocker missed a 30-yard field goal to force overtime.\nThe Saints took the ball in overtime and Brees hit Spiller, who avoided safety Barry Church down the right sideline, for the touchdown. It was Brees' 400th touchdown pass. He's now 9-9 in overtime games.\nThe Cowboys lost linebacker Sean Lee in the first half with a concussion. Lance Dunbar injured his left knee on a second-half kickoff return. Wide receiver Brice Buter injured his hamstring in the third quarter.\nNew Orleans punted away the opening possession of the game after three plays that included a dropped potential interception by Dallas cornerback Tyler Patmon.\nDallas countered with an eight-play 74-yard that stalled at the Saints' 17 where Dan Bailey made a 30-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead.\nThe key plays on the drive was a 14-yard run by Joseph Randle and a 45-yard run by Dunbar. The 45-yard run was the team's longest of the season.\nThe Saints followed with an 80-yard, 11-play scoring drive that took 5:49.\nDrew Brees' 3-yard touchdown pass to Josh Hill gave the Saints a 7-3 lead at the 3:48 mark.\nDallas marched to the Saints' 1, aided by two penalties against New Orleans.\nOn first and goal, Randle leaped over the pile and stretched the ball with one-hand, was hit, and fumbled. Linebacker Michael Mauti recovered at the 4.\nThe play was ruled a fumble. However, after a review, the call was reversed and Randle was credited with a touchdown as the ball crossed the goal line before the hit and fumble.\nThe play capped an 80-yard, 10-play drive and gave Dallas a 10-7 lead at the 13:35 mark.\nNeither team threatened to score the rest of the way and the first half ended with Dallas ahead 10-7.\nLance Dunbar suffered a leg injury on the second-half kickoff.\nAfter a Dallas punt, New Orleans tied the game on Zach Hocker's 51-yard field goal.\nNew Orleans originally were going to punt, but a flag for 12-men on the field against the Cowboys moved the ball from the 38 to the 33.\nNew Orleans decide to go for the field goal and Hocker made it to tie the game at 10-10.\nDallas countered with a big play to move into scoring position.\nBrandon Weeden threw a 67 yard pass to Butler at the 9.\nHowever, two incompletions and a sack forced a field goal try. Bailey's 38-yard kick put Dallas back on top at 13-10 at the 8:20 mark.\nThe back-and-forth scoring pace continued with Hocker making a 29-yard field goal to tie the game at 13-13 through three quarters.\nKhiry Robinson scored on a 1-yard run to give the Saints a 20-13 lead with 7:58 left in the game.\nDallas drove 91-yards to tie the game with 1:51 to go. On fourth and 7 at the Saints' 17, Weeden threw a touchdown to a diving Terrance Williams to tie the game at 20.\nWeeden had completions of 24 yards to Williams, 28 to Jason Witten and 19 yards to Cole Beasley along with the 17-yard score.\nNew Orleans moved to the Cowboys' 17 where Hocker missed a 30-yard field goal when the ball hit the left upright with 12 seconds left and sending the game into overtime.\nTwo plays later, Brees threw the game-winning touchdown to Spiller.\n(c)2015 Fort Worth Star-Telegram\nVisit the Fort Worth Star-Telegram at www.star-telegram.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1732619&h=Saints+clip+Cowboys+in+overtime", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1732619&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1732619"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:08:58.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
