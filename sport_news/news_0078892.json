The seventh- and eighth-grade students are working with value, picking three rhyming words and using them to tell a story that resembles a comic strip.\nCook, a 31-year-old Southeast Portland resident, sports a colorful checkered shirt, gray-framed glasses and a silver watch with a square, green face. He bounces from student to student, crouching or standing next to tables, examining artwork and answering questions. One gets the impression he doesn't spend much of his day sitting at a desk.\nHe'll be out of the office — or classroom, rather — for part of this week, however, collecting an award as Oregon's mid-level art educator of the year , as named by the Oregon Art Education Association.\nThe all-volunteer association, he said, is his biggest support system when it comes to art. Teachers throughout the state help answer questions about papier-mâché or throwing clay pots, for example. As the only art teacher in the building, he's otherwise on his own for those kinds of things.\nHe also volunteers as the association's statewide membership liaison and is a freelance illustrator, with Kickstarter projects, shirt designs for the likes of Nike, Coldplay and Muse, and internal logo branding for Facebook among his projects . He has worked for South Meadows since it opened in 2009, and previously worked part-time for a year at Hillsboro's now-closed J.B. Thomas Middle School .\nAlthough he said he could probably make a living as a freelance illustrator, Cook said loves working with the middle schoolers.\n\"It's exhausting, it's sometimes frustrating, but I wouldn't be doing it if it wasn't completely satisfying and super fun,\" he said.\n— Jim Ryan\njryan@oregonian.com\n503-221-8005; @Jimryan015", "external_links": ["http://www.oregonarted.org/", "http://www.briancook.net/", "http://www.briancook.net/about/", "http://twitter.com/jimryan015", "http://schools.hsd.k12.or.us/southmeadows/Home/tabid/2943/Default.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:23:17.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
