I mean all the penguins – the actual penguins – that live in Pittsburgh.\nOver the opening 255 minutes of the season, the Ducks scored once, or a third as many times as Arizona’s Anthony Duclair scored all by himself in only 28 minutes against the Ducks on Oct. 14.\nFor the misfiring Ducks, Duclair’s performance must have looked more like a magic trick than a hat trick.\nAs a columnist who prefers to view things realistically, I’m often accused of being overly negative, of not only seeing the glass as half-empty but also as cracked and leaking battery acid onto my burrito.\nBut, I ask today, how would you positively spin the preseason so far for the Clippers, who went all the way to China to have Chris Paul break his finger and then lose by 42 points to Charlotte, a team expected to win maybe 30 games this season?\nThe trip was such a downer that even Steve Ballmer’s enthusiasm had to be dampened. The Clippers’ owner, in case you’re unaware, is so energetic that, when he travels, he’s asked to switch his personality to airplane mode.\nHonestly, compared to the Clippers, the Lakers look like title contenders, and their current state is best summed up by the alarming amount of attention given lately to Marcelo Huertas, who might be the NBA’s next international sensation or, perhaps, just the latest Sun Yue.\nHow much of a collective struggle have the past few weeks been around here? Consider the Kings couldn’t start a practice because of the absence of ice two days after the Lakers couldn’t finish an exhibition because of the presence of ice.\nThe team’s game in San Diego against Golden State was called during the third quarter due to condensation on the court, condensation caused by a rink under the floor, a rink upon which the Ducks’ AHL affiliate skates.\nIn other words, at the moment, our sputtering teams can’t stay out of each other’s way even when those teams play entirely different sports.\nThe way things are going, the Angels have been the fortunate ones. Their year simply ended in bitter frustration, a game short of extending the regular season and, with it, the possibility of failing on an even larger stage.\nInstead, the Angels were permitted to fade away with little notice, just another also-ran during an era when they’ve been also-running with discouraging regularity. But again, on the plus side, they didn’t embarrass themselves. We had the Dodgers for that.\nA week later, I’m still trying to figure out how no one covered third in Game 5, allowing the Mets’ Daniel Murphy, who had only two steals during the regular season, to swipe a base at a time when every inch – never mind 90 feet – mattered.\nThis also was a night when Andre Ethier engaged in a shouting match with Don Mattingly in the Dodgers dugout, a winner-take-all game an odd time for any player to apparently make the moment all about himself.\nThe heated exchange is something the Angels should remember this winter when they consider trading for Ethier, not that red flags ever have stopped the Angels from adding outfielders unworthy of their contracts, right?\nThe Dodgers finished the regular season on a surge while New York did the opposite, flip-flopping home-field advantage in the National League Division Series.\nTurns out, that advantage only meant the Dodgers could provide local fans with an up-close look at the most graphic fiasco produced recently by any of our teams. No, there was nothing funny about Game 5, a fact underscored when those in attendance included George Lopez.\nThe Dodgers’ loss isn’t likely to be upstaged Thursday, although, given the way the past two games have gone, who knows what UCLA might be capable of against Cal? The Bruins have lost consecutive games to Arizona State and – quite badly – Stanford.\nThis was supposed to be a promising season at UCLA, but then the Bruins’ defensive playmakers started getting hurt, they began to be exposed and suddenly they all were vulnerable, almost as vulnerable as even USC.\nAnd how’s that for a barometer of the disappointment? Here, more than 750 words into cataloguing the carnage, and I’m just now mentioning the Trojans, who, you might have heard, aren’t having the most festive of seasons.\nThere’s no reason to rehash all the details now, especially since I don’t have another 750 words of space. It would take that much just to make all the necessary jokes about Pete Carroll triumphantly returning to the same program that, on his watch, was nearly destroyed.\nThere’ll be plenty of time for that later. Besides, the Trojans’ recent problems certainly do fit with the local theme, our teams, much like the Kings’ practice ice, melting into lukewarm puddles.\nContact the writer: jmiller@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:55:12.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
