Signal photo by Katharine Lotze. A A A \nIt always seemed as if this year’s Foothill League girls golf Player of the Year race was destined to come down to two players. \nAfter playing another neck-and-neck round on Tuesday at TPC Valencia in the fifth league match of the season, all eyes will be on Golden Valley senior Elisa Pierre and West Ranch junior Ashley Mayhall headed into Wednesday's final. \nPierre was Tuesday’s medalist with a 1-under 35, which gives the two-time defending league champion a big, three-stroke advantage over Mayhall in the overall standings. Mayhall shot a 36 on Tuesday. \nEven with just nine holes to go to stake claim to a third straight Player of the Year prize, Pierre said she doesn’t want to assume anything just yet. \n“I just want to make this a really great round because this is my last high school (league) match so I want to make this something memorable and make this something great,” said Pierre. \nMayhall, on the other hand, comes in to the finals as a challenger with nothing to lose. \n“I just have to go out firing, and I was kind of a little tentative today so I think I just have to be a little more aggressive than I was,” the junior said. \nHer score led yet another lopsided team victory for West Ranch, which posted a 196 on the day as all five scoring golfers on the team shot 42 or better. \nAfter Mayhall, Kate Caffrey recorded a 37, Mack Bailey had a 39 and both Noelle Song and Adelrina Kim carded 42. \nIn the league team standings, with a throw-out score factored in, West Ranch is 178 strokes ahead of the next-closest team in league, which is Valencia. \nOn Tuesday, Golden Valley was second place at 246, Valencia was third with a 249, and that was followed by Saugus (266) and Canyon (280). Hart didn’t post an official team score for the day with only four golfers in action. \nEunice Song led Valencia on the day with a 43, and Clara Venger was Saugus’ best with the same score. They were followed by Golden Valley’s Justine Reblando (44) and Valencia’s Sarah Baranda (45). \nThe playoff picture is all-but set in stone on the team side. West Ranch, Valencia and Golden Valley will almost assuredly earn the automatic postseason spots as the top three finishers. \nIndividually, there are still postseason spots up for grabs. \nThe top six finishers in total league stroke minus a throw-out will advance. Those spots are currently occupied by Pierre, Mayhall, Bailey, Eunice Song, Caffrey and Venger. Noelle Song is three strokes back of Venger for the final spot, and Reblando is six behind.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:28:36.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
