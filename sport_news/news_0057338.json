Green, and the potent two-headed running back attack of Jeremy Hill and Giovani Bernard.\nThe Cincinnati defense features a tough line, anchored by defensive tackle Geno Atkins, as well as quality players throughout all three levels. It's a unit that's yet to give up a rushing touchdown on the season, which isn't exactly good news for a Seahawks running attack that's yet to score in 2015.\nHead coach Pete Carroll knows the Seahawks will have to play their best to emerge with a win on Sunday.\n\"There's a lot of concerns when you play this football team,\" he said on Friday. \"This is a very well-balanced football team. This is a team that does everything well. There's no weakness. They're high-flying and healthy and all that. So this is a game that calls for us to play very well in all aspects.\"\nKickoff is scheduled for 10 a.m. Pacific on Q/13 TV and ESPN 710 Seattle radio.
