Signal photo by Dan Watson A A A \nThe first half of the first-ever “Faith Bowl” was as wacky as the second half was straightforward and businesslike. \nSanta Clarita Christian scored touchdowns on four of its five possessions after the break to overcome five first-half interceptions — three returned for TDs — and rout Trinity Classical Academy 42-18 at Canyon High on Saturday night. \n“What I’m most proud of is how we responded at halftime,” said SCCS head coach Garrick Moss. “We expected this to be one of our tougher games this year, knowing their school and knowing how big rivalry games are.” \nMoss said the key in the second half of the teams’ first 11-man football matchup was beating Trinity’s defensive pressure with quick throws. \nThe triggerman was Cardinals quarterback Tristan Miller, who completed his last 11 passes of the game to finish 30-for-57 for 326 yards and three touchdowns. \nHis last scoring toss gave SCCS a 28-18 lead at the 4:49 mark in the third quarter. \n“(Tristan) did a great job of just forgetting and stepping up,” said SCCS wide receiver Michael Uribe, who caught nine passes for 155 yards and two TDs. \nIt'd be fair to say there were things worth forgetting. \nTrinity’s front seven pressured Miller, the East Valley Division’s most prolific passer coming into the game, into throwing five interceptions before halftime. \nKnights safety Ian Caddow hauled in three of them, returning two for 41- and 88-yard touchdowns, respectively. \n“He’s a beast. He’s just an animal,” Trinity head coach Les Robinson said of Caddow. “... He’s a fiery competitor. He’s a force to be dealt with.” \nCaddow also ran the ball 10 times for 61 yards and caught two passes for 30 yards in the game. \nBut outside of 73 yards rushing on 21 carries from Caden Kulp, the Knights did little offensively against the Cardinals. \nTrinity defender Jordan Thomas returned a Miller interception 89 yards for a score midway through the second quarter to give Trinity its first — and only — lead of the game at 18-14. \nThe Knights never scored again. \nSCCS, on the other hand, found its rhythm after halftime. \nBrody DeRevere scored the first of his three rushing TDs at the 10:15 mark in the third to put SCCS up 21-18, and the Cardinals never looked back. \nDeRevere finished the game with 43 yards on 13 carries. \nSCCS wide receiver Caden Brenner caught 11 balls for 120 yards and a TD for the Cardinals, who gave Miller considerably more time in the second half against a tired Trinity squad. \nThe Knights came into the game with 16 players and lost three to injuries during the game, Robinson said. SCCS has 35 players listed on its roster. \n“It’s really disappointing,” Caddow said of the outcome. “I feel like if we had a full team, we could have kept it closer. But they are a really good team.” \nTrinity made the jump from 8-man to 11-man football this season (SCCS made the move before the 2011 season), which allowed the longtime rival schools to meet on the football field for the first time since 2010. \nSCCS won 46-0 that year. \nBut despite another lopsided score, Robinson felt his team more than held its own, though. \n“We hit with them. We went toe-to-toe with them for 3 1/2 quarters,” Robinson said. “I’m proud of my guys.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:48:39.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
