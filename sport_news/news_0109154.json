Chris Ivory is backing up Brandon Marshall's big praise.\nThe Jets receiver may have raised some eyebrows this week when he said Ivory was the best running back in the league, but then the bruising Jets back went out and posted another monster game in the Jets 34-20 win over Washington Sunday. Ivory ran for 146 yards and a touchdown and added 50 yards receiving.\n\"Everyone, they laughed at me,\" Marshall said. \"There was a couple guys, I wish I could remember all their names and they laughed at me when I said 'Ivory's the best.' And he is. And he proved it again today.\"\nWashington actually took away Ivory's bread and butter -- inside runs -- and he still managed to pick up big yardage on the outside.\n\"Eight-man box, nine-man box. (They) came out and said we don't care about the wide receivers, we're going to stop the run,\" Marshall said. \"And Ivory again came out and put up over 140 yards. He's amazing and he's the best in the league.\"\nIvory was pleased with how he played and enjoyed the praise from his teammates.\n\"It's a great compliment from him, being the type of player he is, the type of caliber player he is,\" Ivory said. \"Marshall is elite. It means a lot.\"\nSo, does Ivory agree with Marshall?\n\"Yeah, I feel like I'm one of the 'em,\" Ivory said.\nHead coach Todd Bowles was pleased with the way Ivory played.\n\"He's our bell cow,\" Bowles said. \"We rely on him. He comes through every time.\"\nIvory has always been a physical runner, but his role as part of the passing game -- he had three receptions for 50 yards -- was new.\n\"You don't have to always go deep, man,\" Ivory said. \"You can turn a short pass into a deep play.\"\n\"We knew going in that they were a little soft inside as far as them dropping their 'backers and then us curling up within like five yards,\" he added. \"We just knew to expect the ball.\"\nIvory said that a newfound patience, instilled in him by his coaches, is fueling his strong play.\n\"It's a great scheme and they're doing a hell of a job up front,\" Ivory said. \"I'm being very patient, probably the most patient I've been throughout my career.\"\nRelated Stories Jets Insider: Sheldon Richardson picks up half a sack Jets beat up on Washington, improve to 4-1 with 34-20 win Jets 34, Washington 20: Manish Mehta's instant analysis Jets vs. Washington: LIVE BOXSCORE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:29:38.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
