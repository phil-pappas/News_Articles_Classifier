But for couples, it can also mean wrestling over different emotions toward costumes, from passion to indifference to vehement distaste.\nOne person might hate Halloween. Another might start plotting an ensemble in August. He wants to stay in and hand out candy; she wants to dance in masks until 2 a.m.\nThen there's the price tag adding more fuel to the fire: A RetailMeNot survey reported that Americans buying costumes will shell out, on average, $62 this year. The National Retail Federation offers a more conservative figure — $27.33 — but that's still money for something likely to be used once.\nWill you spend $75 on Halloween? Gregory Karp Millions of Americans will embrace the season of witches and pumpkins this year as they spend nearly $75 each on Halloween costumes, candy and decorations, the National Retail Federation projected Wednesday.\nTotal spending is expected to reach $6.9 billion, or $74.34 per person, down about 4 percent...\nMillions of Americans will embrace the season of witches and pumpkins this year as they spend nearly $75 each on Halloween costumes, candy and decorations, the National Retail Federation projected Wednesday.\nTotal spending is expected to reach $6.9 billion, or $74.34 per person, down about 4 percent...\n(Gregory Karp) Whatever a couple decides, it must center on the needs of the two people in the relationship, said Dr. Stan Tatkin, founder of the Psychobiological Approach to Couple Therapy (PACT) Institute in California.\n\"Any time partners do something that's unfair or unjust or insensitive without considering their partner, they will pay for it,\" said Tatkin, whose books include \"Love and War in Intimate Relationships: Connection, Disconnection and Mutual Regulation in Couple Therapy\" (W.W. Norton).\nBut unlike a onesie costume, there is no one-size-fits-all solution.\n\"Like anything else, it's really a matter of two people deciding what they want to do,\" he said. \"They can create any kind of a win-win situation.\"\nThat might look like a costume each person is comfortable wearing, or the more gung-ho Halloween fan agreeing that if he wins the costume battle in October, he'll agree to an outing the other person chooses at a later time.\nBut before you visit a craft store or costume shop, you need to communicate. Each party has to be respectful of the other's choice of costume, Tatkin said. Dressing like a dictator might work, but acting like one doesn't. So, no forcing your partner to wear something he or she finds uncomfortable. The same principle applies if one partner finds the other's choice of costume embarrassing or in bad taste.\nWe are looking for photos that capture all things fall, especially Halloween fun. We'll add them to our online gallery, and your photos may be chosen for our print edition.\n( Upload your own Fall into Halloween photo here. ) On the other hand, he said, if one person is an extrovert — ready to chat up everyone as a Ninja Turtle — but the other is more shy, the right ensemble could be a great solution.\n\"Costumes, especially (those) that cover the face, are a release for socially anxious people,\" he said. \"Then they can be anybody they want to be. They can be somebody who doesn't talk.\"\nAlthough the idea of fighting about Halloween costumes might seem trivial, Tatkin noted that even these situations can cause long-term problems when they're approached without compassion and consideration.\n\"It is, after all, one night,\" he said. \"The way people behave over this is more important than whether they wear a costume or not.\n\"The mistake that couples make is they operate without thinking about the other person,\" he added. \"Anything they do is going to come back to them, whether it's (about) a Halloween costume or a house or a vacation.\"\nQuick! I need a costume!\nYou're ready, he's not. She's ready, you're not. Or maybe you both made a last-minute decision to attend a costume party. What can you throw together in a flash? We asked the experts. (And don't forget: Thrift stores are easy and inexpensive sources for costumes.)\nMummy: Holly Botsford, a spokeswoman for BuyCostumes.com , suggested wrapping yourselves in paper towels. It's cheap, quick and easy.\nZombie prom chick: Women can throw on a dress, tease their hair and add some red lipstick to face and arms to resemble blood, Botsford said. Dark eyeliner doesn't hurt. (In fact, any get-up lends itself to zombie-dom. The key is your makeup. The Internet is filled with tutorials, including this one from Tribune reporter Wendy Donahue.)\nCat: All you need to do is draw a nose and whiskers on your face, Botsford said. (Black eyeliner works well for this.)\nHippie: Transform yourself into a hippie with flared jeans and colorful or tie-dyed shirt, then draw a peace sign on your cheek.\nSolar system: Glue Styrofoam balls to your clothes to become spacelike, suggest the experts at Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores .
