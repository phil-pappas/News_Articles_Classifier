I know what I’ve spoke with Alex over the years, and I have tremendous belief in Alex and what he’s accomplished with me. In the 10 or 11 years we’ve been working together, he’s never been wrong.”\nBrady jogs off the field after the Patriots beat the Cowboys on Sunday.

As part of a company called 6 Degree Nutrition, Guerrero was stopped again by the FTC a few years later after selling a drink — NeuroSafe — which supposedly helped improve recovery time from concussions.\n“When you say, ‘Well, this sounds like quackery,’ there’s a lot of things I see on a daily basis in Western medicine that I think, ‘Wow, why would they ever do that? That is crazy.’ That’s just the way life works,” Brady said. “I don’t know the details of each of those incidences, but I think that it speaks to he as a person, as a friend. There’s nobody better person that I enjoy as much as Alex. He’s been an incredible influence in my life.”\nBrady and Guerrero — who met in 2006 through former linebacker Willie McGinest — are business partners in a sports therapy center called TB12, located in Massachusetts. The future Hall of Famer said if it wasn’t for Guerrero, he “wouldn’t be playing today,” crediting him for changing his lifestyle, helping him recover from a devastating knee injury in 2008 and avoiding the type of injuries that usually prevent quarterbacks from winning Super Bowls and leading MVP races at age 38.\nAccording to a New York Times profile , Guerrero is also the godfather of Brady’s son, Ben, and accompanies the quarterback to every game, standing on the sidelines. Guerrero plans Brady’s training schedule months in advance and coordinates his meals with New England’s staff.\n“Everyone thinks I’m a kook and a charlatan,” Guerrero told the Times, when discussing traditional training methods.\nBrady has even gotten several teammates to work with Guerrero, including receiver Julian Edelman and former All-Pro Wes Welker. At TB12, Guerrero sells his own line of nutritional supplements, which the trainer claims aren’t in violation of the NFL’s substance abuse policy. Brady said he was “absolutely” sure he has taken nothing that would result in more legal battles with the league.\n“Willie used to be the big Alex evangelist, [but] now I’m the evangelist,” Brady said of Guerrero’s training and treatments. “It’s like giving a chef flour and eggs and saying, ‘OK, we’ll make biscuits.’ Well, sure, everyone is going to make them different. But Alex is perfect at it.”\n  Filed under new england patriots ,  nfl ,  tom brady", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:05:08.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
