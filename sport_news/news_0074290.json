Nothing spectacular, nothing memorable, nothing to write home to mom about. Just a win at Montreal against a good defence while your own takes care of the veteran on the other side who knows about five per cent of the playbook. Rookie Jeff Mathews, in the hands of the master teacher in coach Kent Austin (who had him at Cornell University) went 21 of 25, 241 and a TD toss, helped by 113 yards on the ground. His teammates drew just six flags and chipped in three interceptions and a fumble recovery. Special teams continue to be strong.
