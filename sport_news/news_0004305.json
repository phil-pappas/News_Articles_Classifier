He was innocent, and the jury got it right.”\nSefolosha was accused of disorderly conduct, obstruction and resisting arrest for allegedly interfering with the police investigation of the stabbing of ex-Knick Chris Copeland on April 8.\nSefolosha and then-teammate Pero Antic were partying at the trendy Manhattan club around 4 a.m. when Copeland, who was not part of their entourage, was slashed in the gut by a stranger outside.\nSefolosha at Manhattan criminal court on Oct. 8. Photo: AP \nPolice told everyone to clear the block, but Sefolosha kept stopping, then called Officer JohnPaul Giancona a “midget,” the cop testified at the three-day trial before Judge Robert Mandelbaum.\nSefolosha took the stand Wednesday and insisted he complied with the officer’s order and continued walking. \nHe also said he’d only hurled the “midget” insult after Giacona repeatedly told him, “Get off my block, this is my f–king block.”\nThe conflict escalated as Sefolosha reached Tenth Avenue and was about to climb into a livery cab when a panhandler Amos Canty, who was standing next to a cop, asked for a handout.\nSefolosha turned to hand Canty a $20 bill and suddenly four cops jumped him, he said.\nOfficer Richard Canter told jurors that he saw the 6’ 7” athlete lunge at his partner, who was next to Canty.\nDuring the scuffle, cops fractured a bone in Sefolosha’s right leg, shelving him for the rest of the NBA season.\nSpiro argued that the cops targeted Sefolosha because he was a black man in a “hoodie” and grossly misperceived his actions.\n“We have him, Thabo, acknowledging somebody that everybody else forgets,” Spiro told jurors. “His crime was philanthropy.”\nProsecutor Francesca Bartolomey argued that Sefolosha repeatedly disobeyed cops and likely made up the story about the beggar.\n“He was arrested and subsequently injured because of his own actions,” the prosecutor said. “The police tell you to disperse, you have to disperse.”\nShe added, “In this courtroom, there are no NBA stars, nobody is above the law, not you, not me, not Thabo Sefolosha.”\nPrior to trial, prosecutors offered to dismiss the charges against Sefolosha if he completed one day of community service. But he rejected the deal, insisting on his innocence.\n  atlanta hawks ,  nypd ,  thabo sefolosha", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:04:33.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
