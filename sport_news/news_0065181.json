It would then share the title with the winner of the Cardington-Fredericktown game. \nWide receiver Daniel Kill threw a 20-yard pass for a touchdown to Devin Pearl in overtime to seal the win over Highland for the Pirates. \nCardington had rallied from a 21-14 third-quarter deficit to take a lead late in regulation. \nLuke McCarrell passed 50 yards to Pearl for a score and Brandon Steckel kicked a 30-yard field goal to hand Cardington a 24-21 lead with 38 seconds left in regulation. \nHighland used those final seconds wisely to move the ball deep into Pirate territory. On the last play of regulation, Satchel Denton kicked a 30-yard field goal for Highland to send the game into extra time tied at 24. \nCardington jumped out in front 7-0 as Trey Williams passed 30 yards to Kill for a TD. \nHighland tied the game at 7 when Max Schreiber passed 89 yards to Dakota Bunting for a touchdown. \nThe teams traded scores as Scott Osborne ran 28 yards for a touchdown for Cardington and Andrew Davis hit paydirt from two yards away for Highland. \nHighland took its 21-14 lead on a 43-yard TD run by Bunting. \nOsborne had 110 rushing yards on 12 carries while McCarrell hit 8-of-17 passes for 133 yards. \nSchreiber threw for 243 yards and Bunting ran for 141 yards for the Scots. \nFredericktown 41, Northmor 3 \nFredericktown set up its big game with Cardington-Lincoln by stopping Northmor in the MOAC. \nBrenden Reed ran for four TDs as the Freddies improved to 7-2 overall. Reed hit the end zone on efforts of 14, 8, 35 and 9 yards as the Freddies moved out on top 28-0. \nAfter Jake Farley hit a 24-yard field goal for Northmor (1-5, 2-7), Dillion Smith passed for four yards to Jake Streby for a TD and ran 25 yards for another score. \nFredericktown held a 485-143 edge in total yards in the game. \nReed accounted for 221 rushing yards on 24 carries for Fredericktown while Smith ran for 109 yards and threw for another 143.

Frank Keller brought in five balls for 46 yards. \nGalion 62, North Union 21 \nGalion put a huge dent in North Union’s playoff chances while enhancing its own with an MOAC victory. \nNorth Union (2-4 MOAC) is still alive in the playoff race with a 4-5 record, but just barely. The Wildcats would have to beat Buckeye Valley Friday and get a lot of help to qualify. \nChase Cooke hit 10-of-12 passes for 289 yards and one TD for Galion (4-2, 7-2) while Drake Barnett ran for 144 yards and four scores. Jacob Fryer tallied three TDs for the Tigers, two coming via the rush, and Caleb Ivy added a touchdown run. \nGalion had a 42-0 lead before North Union cracked the scoreboard. \nLuke Krawczyk tallied touchdowns for the Wildcats on runs of 22 and 13 yards.
