Iloka played 43 defensive snaps in the game and Williams played 31. \nWilliams will likely start in Iloka's place with veteran Leon Hall possibly moving to safety in nickel situations and thus opening the door for 2014 first-round draft pick Darqueze Dennard to see some playing time as the nickel corner. \nJones suffered the elbow injury in the Baltimore game when he was tackled returning the opening kickoff of the second half. Jones appeared to be in significant pain both as he was treated on the field and then while on the sidelines as the offense was on the field, but returned for the first defensive snap of the second half and played the rest of the game. \nThree others Bengals players are listed probable for Sunday's game: cornerback Dre Kirkpatrick (shoulder); offensive tackle Andre Smith (hip) and defensive tackle Pat Sims (hip). All three were full participants in Friday's practice. \nKirkpatrick got hurt trying to tackle Steve Smith as he crossed the goal line in the third quarter of Sunday's game in Baltimore, but remained in the game and played all 74 defensive snaps. \nSmith missed some practice time last week due to a buttocks injury, but played in Sunday's game. \nSims missed the game due to his injury. \nRookie defensive lineman Marcus Hardison is also listed as questionable due to the knee injury that caused him to miss the first three games of the season. \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
