US Soccer Federation is hosting Copa America Centenario.

There was concern that the tournament wouldn't even happen, and if it did, that it would be moved to another country, so it has taken much longer than needed to get things in order. \nThe competition will feature 16 teams, 6 from CONCACAF, including the US and Mexico, along with the 10 South American teams, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. \nCosta Rica and Jamaica will also take part, while the final two teams will come via a CONCACAF playoff. \nIt's fantastic news for a sport that's growing in the US. The Copa America is arguably the most important international competition after the World Cup. Many view it on the same level as the European Championship, which is every four years. \nUruguay is the most successful nation in the competition's history, winning 15 times since 1916. Chile won the 2015 edition, beating Argentina in penalty kicks. \n\nThe Copa is coming to USA.
