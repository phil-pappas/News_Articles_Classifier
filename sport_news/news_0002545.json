Being the play-caller, we have that drive there and went three-and-out, giving them the ball right back. So you're second-guessing some things there, and then to watch the defense make a stand and really rise up, get them to fourth down, and then Doctson -- who had an incredible game -- goes up, gets a hand on it and they make a great play and win it. So kind all of the emotions in one on the last couple of minutes but it was a fantastic ballgame.\"\nOn his strategy to keep team focused during two-game stretch of TCU and Baylor:\n\"Really just that it's another great opportunity to show how good you are. You can take it both ways. You can pout or you can get mad about it and try to do something about it and so we're trying to take that second approach. We're all mad how the game ended but hey, we have a great top-five opponent this week and you get another opportunity to show how good you are.\"\nOn back-and-forth with Arkansas coach Bret Bielema:\n\"I've really moved on from it. I think it was what it was. I said what was on my mind, he said what was on his mind and just kind of left it at that. They have a great program and they do a great job in the SEC and it really was what it was.\nOn comparing strength of schedule in the Big 12 versus the SEC:\n\"I just think the SEC have won for so long that they've earned that right to be put as the premier conference but I do feel like other conferences are making up that ground now. I think the Big 12 has some very, very good teams and some very good offenses that can play with anybody and when you face these types of offenses, anything can happen. You've got great players in space and great quarterbacks and it's kind of a great equalizer.\"\nOn LeRaven Clark's playmaking skills displayed in late lateral:\n\"Every Thursday we have that - we work that and you know those o-linemen don't get to touch it very much so they're always sprinting around, trying to get in the endzone to spike it - do the little dances. So he's a very good athlete, he got his hands on it and gave it a good run.\"\nOn approach to defense within the conference:\n\"Your expectation of defenses has to change in this conference. You have to try and create turnovers and have to try and force some field goals because the way these teams play in the spread offense and the tempo, people are going to get their yards and their going to score some points. So, you really have to focus on taking the ball away and trying to hold people to field goals.\"\nOn if teams can win championships playing up-tempo spread offenses:\n\"We'll find out. I think it's creeping closer and closer. You know Ohio State runs a similar spread. They're not as wide-open, probably. But they're a spread. Auburn played in the championship game - they're wide-open. Both those teams run it more out of the spread than we do, but I think it's headed that way. I think TCU, Baylor were close last year to getting in and once you get in, anything can happen.\"\nListen to the full interview here beginning at the 5:21 mark.\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeDuPont_", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/MikeDuPont_", "http://espn.go.com/espnradio/play?id=13769553"], "published": "2015-09-29T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:56:38.924+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
