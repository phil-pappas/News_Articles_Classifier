It was a decision many viewed as tone-deaf considering Sanders’ 2007 legal victory in alleging Thomas helped foster a hostile work environment.\nAsked if he thought Sanders made up her claims, Dolan said yes.\n“I think a bunch of it she did, yes,’’ Dolan said. When asked by host Bryant Gumbel why Sanders would concoct such a story, he replied: “I was running a business, and she didn’t do very well in it and she was real unhappy about that and she decided to go get a lawyer.’’\nDolan easily could have settled the lawsuit for a few hundred thousand dollars — “My fault,’’ he says now — but pressed on.\n“Because I actually believed in the truth,” Dolan told HBO. “The fighter in me came out and said, ‘I’m not going to settle, because that’s an admission of guilt and I’m not guilty.’ ”\n\nThe entire incident left Thomas as one of the most hated sports figures in New York, after a decidedly unsuccessful stint running (and coaching) the Knicks.\n“If you’re trying to paint the picture that I wasn’t at my best here and I didn’t do a good job here in New York, I’m not disagreeing with you,’’ Thomas said in the interview.\nAsked what grade he would give himself for his stewardship of the Knicks, he answered: “Maybe a C-minus to a D.”\nYet Dolan — who might be even less popular than Thomas — always has felt a kinship with the controversial Hall of Fame guard, no matter how much drama or disrepute Thomas brought to the Knicks.\n“I don’t know if I can explain it other than that there’s something inside both of us that’s really quite similar. The tenacity, the stubbornness. Isiah’s a guy who doesn’t believe in his limitations, and I’m a guy who doesn’t believe in his limitations,’’ Dolan said.\n“I think I’ve always understood him.’’\nIn Thomas’ first official season as team president, the Liberty vaulted from a WNBA also-ran to the best record in the league, falling in the conference finals.\n“The Jim Dolan that I know wears a fedora and plays the guitar and sings the blues about Trayvon Martin,’’ Thomas said, referring to the Florida teenager fatally gunned down by George Zimmerman. “Did you hear what I just said? He wrote a song about Trayvon Martin.’’\n  Filed under isiah thomas ,  james dolan ,  new york knicks ,  new york liberty ,  sexual harassment", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:43:42.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
