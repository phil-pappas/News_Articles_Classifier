The York High School offensive tackle/defensive end knows about the highs and lows of games against Marshwood. He’s familiar with the hard hits that define the game on the field and the emotions that linger well after the final horn. He’s been on the field for the bad ones, like the 41-12 rout in South Berwick that capped the regular season a year ago — and the good ones, the come-from-behind, 28-19 win here in 2013 that followed a one-point loss in the regional final the year before. “The week or two after that game was just a crazy vibe,” recalled Morrison. “That drives me to do my job and get everyone else to do it, too, because I know what it feels like.” Whether a player has been through the wars or is experiencing it for the first time, York vs. Marshwood is always something special — partly because it’s a game between two neighboring communities that love their football, and partly because the teams have played instant classics in two of the last three regional championship games. Never mind that Marshwood (5-2) and York (2-5) are residing near opposite ends of the standings. This rivalry has taught us not to judge the game by the momentum a team brings into it. “Last year was the same thing after the first game where we lost by that much,” said Morrison. “Then they ran over Fryeburg (61-0) and then Westbrook (53-0) in the playoffs, and everybody thought it was going to be the same thing. But it was a different game.” That “different game” was a hold-on-for-dear-life win by the Hawks in the regional final, the 14-13 margin the closest game the eventual Class B champions would play all season — by 25 points. “Records, at the end of the day, don’t matter,” said Morrison. “They do in the standings, but not when you play.” The veteran York guys would love to get a little payback for three straight losses, two of them in the playoffs. The newer guys are thrilled to be a part of a game they’ve watched in the past with great interest from the stands and sidelines. That group includes junior Ryan Daley, a first-year starter at tight end and outside linebacker. “It’s a great experience at the younger levels, watching the varsity guys go through it,” he said. “Now the varsity guys have schooled you up and it’s great to be out there.” The stakes might not be the same as they were at this time a year ago, when both teams brought 7-0 records into the hyped matchup that would decide the No. 1 playoff seed. But they’re plenty important. After losing to Falmouth in overtime last week, 22-20, the Hawks forfeited any claim on the top seed in Class B South. But a win Friday would secure them the No. 2 or 3 spot. For York, which currently sits in eighth place, a win gets it into the eight-team playoff field. Even with a loss, there’s a good chance it makes the cut at 2-6, because it’s played the toughest schedule of any Class B South team and that’s reflected in the Crabtree Index. “I think we’re in and we can be as high as seventh, even with a loss,” coach Randy Small told Seacoast Media Group this week. “I am not saying we’re definitely in, but we are unless something crazy happens.” So why are the Wildcats optimistic? One, they felt they finally got some traction for their season last week at Noble. The 28-21 was no work of art but did come against a team above them in the standings. Two, they seem to have their offensive line issues sorted out. Morrison, Liam Bonner, William Pratt, Colin Palmer and Will Sheive are the guys paving the way for big backs Cullen McCarty and Connor Elsemore. “We’ve kind of been shuffling all year and now we have a group of people who want to be there, who have proven it,” said Morrison. “I like this group a lot. It reminds me of last year’s group. We weren’t that big but all the kids wanted to hit and knew what they were doing. They played every down like it was their last one.” The talking point this week? “Be physical because these are some tough kids,” said Daley. “But so are we. As long as we hit hard it’ll be a good game.” “Against Noble we really came out and hit all game and we really hadn’t to that point,” said Morrison. “We had halves where we hit, or quarters, but not a full game. We played a half against Biddeford and a half against Kennebunk, three quarters against Westbrook.” Nothing less than a full game will give the Wildcats a chance for the upset. Veterans of this rivalry or newcomers, they can’t wait to be a part of it. “We’ve got guys from that team who have unfinished business from last year,” said Morrison. “We just want to go out there and do our jobs, and we know if we do that we can win.” By Mike Zhe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:17:54.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
