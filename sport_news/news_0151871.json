(AP Photo/John Raoux) \nGAINESVILLE, Florida — No. 25 Florida could be without quarterback Will Grier against third-ranked Mississippi on Saturday. \nGrier has been dealing with an illness this week and might not start against the Rebels, according to a person familiar with the situation. \nThe person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity Friday because Florida (4-0, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) has not disclosed Grier's illness. \nFlorida had about a dozen players miss practice this week because of a virus, but coach Jim McElwain said Wednesday that he thought the bug had ran its course. \nIf Grier doesn't start, sophomore Treon Harris would make his second start this season. Harris started the opener and split series with Grier, who has started the last three games. \nGrier has thrown for 725 yards and six touchdowns this season. He also has two rushing scores and four turnovers, including three interceptions. \n\"He's got a lot to learn and a long ways to go as far as understanding how to play the position,\" McElwain said Wednesday. \nMcElwain also said Harris had a good week of practice and was ready to go. Harris was suspended last week for an undisclosed violation of team rules and did not play the week before. \nHarris has thrown for 269 yards and two touchdowns, with no interceptions, in two games. \nThe Gators have won three consecutive close games, edging East Carolina, Kentucky and Tennessee, to become ranked for the first time in two years. Florida also is hosting its first top-25 matchup in nearly three seasons. \nRegardless of who starts at quarterback, McElwain made it clear this week that others need to play better around him. \n\"We've also got a lot of guys that need to pick up their level of play around him for us to be successful,\" McElwain said. \"So the quarterback, whatever, but we've got issues in some other areas that guys got to step up and start taking accountability for their actions during games and responsibility to play right and do right and help that guy, the quarterback, along.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:14:28.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
