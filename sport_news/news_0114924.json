The suburb of Flawinne is the site of one of Belgium's major military barracks, home to the 2nd Commando Battalion.\nA member of the bomb squad investigates a suspect car parked in a field outside a military barracks in Flawinne, Belgium on Monday, Oct. 26, 2015.

Claude Van De Voorde said that \"one car tried to get into the barracks. There was one person in the car\" who then fled.\nPolice detained a suspect three hours after the attack following a manhunt which also involved helicopters surveying the scene, said prosecutor's spokesman Vincent Macq.\nThere were no immediate reports of serious injuries at the barracks, said defence spokesman Tony Langone. A busted-up Ford was found close by the barracks which police carefully investigated.\nVan De Voorde could not confirm media reports that there were explosives in the car. \"People start making up things quickly,\" he said.\nSince a lone gunman killed four people in the May 2014 attack on the Jewish museum in Brussels, Belgium has been on high alert for further extremist attacks.\nIn January, police killed two men and arrested a third in a counter-terrorism raid in the eastern city of Verviers targeting a group suspected of plotting a major attack.\nBelgium has been one of the largest recruiting bases per capita for foreign fighters travelling to join the Islamic State extremist organization, and authorities have openly expressed alarm about what the recruits might do if they return.\nA preliminary report this month from a U.N. Working Group on the Use of Mercenaries estimated 500 people have been recruited from Belgium to fight in Iraq and Syria.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:05:07.581+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
