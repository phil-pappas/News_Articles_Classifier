Privacy Policy | More Newsletters Getty A man who accused former Chicago Bulls star Scottie Pippen of assaulting him at a sushi restaurant in 2013 has dropped a civil lawsuit against the basketball star. Camran Shafighi filed a $4 million lawsuit against Pippen in 2013, alleging that the retired forward had attacked him outside Nobu in Malibu when he asked for an autograph and photo. Shafighi said Pippen spit in his face, shoved and punched him. Prosecutors declined to press charges against Pippen, citing insufficient evidence. In 2014, Pippen filed a countersuit, alleging Shafighi was aggressive and intoxicated at the time of the incident and asked for unspecified damages. Witnesses told investigators that the two men had been in an altercation, but it was unclear who had been the aggressor. \"This man was a complete fraud from the get-go. We are delighted that fact has now been demonstrably proven and Scottie and Larsa have been vindicated,\" attorney Mark Geragos said, on behalf of Pippen and his wife. The case had been slated to go to trial next month. Nicknamed \"Pip\", the seven-time All-Star — along with Michael Jordan — was a vital component of the Chicago Bulls' six NBA championships in the 1990s and their record 1995–96 season of 72 wins.
