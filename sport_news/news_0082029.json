Against a suspect Baltimore secondary that wasn't tested much by Mike Vick, Benjamin should have a stellar outing. \nPierre Garcon, WR, Redskins at Falcons. Kirk Cousins will likely be missing both DeSean Jackson (hamstring) and Jordan Reed (concussion) against an Atlanta secondary that surrenders more than 300 passing yards per game on average. \nMore thumbs up (excluding the no-brainers): QBs Carson Palmer, Eli Manning, Matt Ryan, Philip Rivers; RBs Justin Forsett, T.J. Yeldon, Dion Lewis, Alfred Morris, Chris Johnson, Mark Ingram, LeGarrette Blount; WRs James Jones, Emmanuel Sanders, Jeremy Maclin, Brandin Cooks, Jordan Matthews, Kendall Wright, Larry Fitzgerald, Leonard Hankerson, Eddie Royal, Julian Edelman, Mike Evans, Doug Baldwin, Keenan Allen, Allen Robinson, Allen Hurns, Kamar Aiken. Roll 'em back \nDerek Carr, QB, Raiders vs. Broncos. Denver is playing ferocious defense, so anyone but a bona fide fantasy stud is too risky to start. Carr has been sharp most of this season, and he's making Amari Cooper a star, but the young gunslinger can't be trusted in this divisional showdown. \nCarlos Hyde, RB, 49ers at Giants. Hyde has had nowhere to run in recent weeks. Now he faces a New York defense that averages a league-low 70 rushing yards per game. Ouch. \nMelvin Gordon, RB, Chargers vs. Steelers. On Monday night, Gordon will face a Pittsburgh run defense that has allowed just one rushing score thus far this season. \nGolden Tate, WR, Lions vs. Cardinals. Can Detroit bounce back from being robbed of a possible last-minute upset in Seattle? Against Arizona's solid secondary, Matt Stafford and any receiver not nicknamed Megatron come with great risk. \nAnquan Boldin, WR, 49ers at Giants. It's hard to trust anybody in this passing attack, owing primarily to Kaepernick's ineffectiveness. \nMore thumbs down: QBs Matt Stafford, Joe Flacco, Nick Foles, Kirk Cousins, Mike Vick; RBs Darren McFadden, C.J. Anderson, Doug Martin, Ameer Abdullah, Latavius Murray, Thomas Rawls, Bishop Sankey, Duke Johnson, C.J. Spiller, Karlos Williams, Tevin Coleman; WRs Nelson Agholor, Roddy White, Tavon Austin, Michael Crabtree, Percy Harvin, Martavis Bryant, Markus Wheaton. Taking a flier \nAlex Smith, QB, Chiefs vs. Bears. Only Kansas City has surrendered more TD passes than Chicago. Meanwhile, Smith has built a solid rapport with Jeremy Maclin to go along with his affinity for Travis Kelce and Jamaal Charles. Don't be . . . \nthe bonehead who lets Michael Floyd linger on the waiver wire. Carson Palmer targeted him seven times against the Rams, signaling that Floyd is ready to play a meaningful role in the Cardinals' high-flying passing attack again.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:30:26.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
