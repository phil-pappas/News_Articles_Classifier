Matt Harvey is the Dark Knight, Noah Syndergaard is Thor, and Jacob deGrom is the ace with unmistakable long, dark hair. \nYoenis Cespedes is the hired gun, Michael Conforto is the new kid, and Wilmer Flores is the loveable kid who cried on the field the night he thought he’d been traded. \nDuring their run to the top of the National League East and within shouting distance of the NLCS, the Mets have traded anonymity for star power. \nSo what does that make Curtis Granderson? \nOn this team that’s suddenly full of distinct personalities, it turns out their source of true stability retains some of that quiet, out-of-the-spotlight nature that was once commonplace in Queens. \n“He doesn't look for headlines,” manager Terry Collins said. “He just likes to play. He loves to be in the lineup. He doesn't care where it's at. When he shows up, you're going to get all you can out of him, and right now he's led the way most of the season.” \nPerhaps the biggest hit of the series – the one that reignited Citi Field and shifted the balance – was Granderson’s two-out, three-run double on Monday. At the time, the Mets had fallen behind and they were one out away from squandering a bases-loaded opportunity. \nGranderson drove the ball to the wall, and when he rounded second base, he turned to watch the final run cross home plate and then raised a single fist into the air. His final bit of celebration seemed unusually braggadocios when he looked toward his teammates and rubbed his fingers together, a common pop culture signal for money and greed. \nOf course, in his unique way, that’s not how Granderson intended the gesture at all. \n“Kirk Nieuwenhuis and I have just been joking around about spoken word and poetry slams,” Granderson explained after his five RBI game that put the Mets in control of this series. “If you ever attend them, the way you clap, you clap like this. So it's just been something that we've been doing, joking around about the quiet, calm way to cheer for somebody.” \nCould any moment better encapsulate Granderson’s season than a huge hit in a huge situation, punctuated by an understated and intentionally silent celebration? \nGranderson has been the Mets’ only 500 at-bat player (he had 580 of them this season). He led the team in hits, runs, stolen bases and walks, ranked second in doubles and – from the leadoff spot – finished third in RBI, just three behind the co-leaders. \nExpected to be a power bat in the middle of the lineup, Granderson was instead asked to hit leadoff and responded with the team’s highest on-base percentage, the second-best OBP of his career. \nOn Monday night he tied a franchise playoff record with five RBI in a game, and he was back at the top of the lineup Tuesday against lefty Clayton Kershaw. There are bigger names and bigger personalities on the team, yet it’s Granderson they turn to, to set the tone and set the pace. \n“You know, when he walks up there, he's dangerous,” Collins said. “That's why I have no problem (playing him), and I know his numbers aren't great against left-hand pitching, but I know one thing: you make a mistake and he can hit one over that fence in a hurry, or against the fence. So he's really played good for us.” 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1RFYRr4 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:08:24.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
