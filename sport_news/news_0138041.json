More >> TUSCALOOSA, AL (WBRC) - \nSome weeks Alabama looks like they can beat anybody on its schedule and some weeks it's a struggle for the Crimson Tide to even score. \nFortunately for Tennessee, Alabama struggle to score on Saturday. But the Vols left nine points on the field thanks to three missed field goals and suffered a 19-14 loss to the No. 8 Crimson Tide. It’s the ninth straight year the Tide has topped the Vols. \nUT opened the game with an 11-play drive but missed a field goal from 43 yards out. \nDerrick Henry crossed the goal line first on a 20-yard run and gave Alabama a 7-0 lead in the first quarter. \nThe Vols answered on their next drive with an 11-yard touchdown pass from Josh Dobbs to Josh Smith. \nUT had the chance to hold a slim lead at halftime. But the Vols missed a field goal from 51 yards away as time expired. \nAdam Griffith capped off Bama’s first drive of the second half with a 19-yard field goal. It gave Alabama a 10-7 lead. \nUT saw yet another promising drive end on an unsuccessful field goal attempt in the final quarter, again from 51-yards out. \nGriffith entered to add another field goal from 28 yards out. \nBut Tennessee answered with a 12-yard run by Jalen Hurd. It gave the Vols their first lead of the game. \nHenry gave Bama the lead again with 2:24 remaining on a 14-yard run. He rushed for 148 yards on 28 carries. \nTennesse's final drive was plagued by a penalty and two sacks. The final sack sent the ball flying from Dobbs' hands into the hands of A’Shawn Robinson. \nSenior quarterback Jake Coker entered the game to take a knee and run out the clock. \nCoker threw for 247 yards. He completed 21-of-27 passes, but also threw an interception. \nThe Crimson Tide (7-1, 4-1 SEC) will enjoy its bye week next weekend. They return to action Nov. 7 at home against undefeated LSU. \nCopyright 2015 WBRC .
