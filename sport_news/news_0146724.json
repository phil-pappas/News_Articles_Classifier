But he showed he had lost none of his capacity for controversy during the 2010 World Cup when he launched a foul-mouthed tirade against coach Raymond Domenech at half-time during a match against Mexico.\nHe was subsequently banned for 18 matches, effectively ending his 69-game international career. His last spell in European football was with English club West Bromwich Albion that ended when he was served with a five-match ban for an anti-semitic gesture known as a “quenelle.”\nThe Romanian forward Adrian Mutu has the unwelcome distinction of being banned for drugs in two of Europe’s top leagues — the English Premiership and Italy’s Serie A.\nHe was sacked by Chelsea in 2004 after testing positive for cocaine, triggering a lengthy legal saga as the London club sued Mutu for breach of contract.\nHe resurrected his career in Italy, first with Juventus and then with Fiorentina before being caught doping once again in 2010, resulting in a six-month ban.\nMutu was also banned from the Romanian national team after posting an image on Facebook depicting his manager as Mr Bean.\nThe Italian defender Materazzi, a former World Cup and Champions League winner, was player-coach of Chennaiyin in last year’s inaugural season and is back in the dug-out this time round.\nDuring a career which included stints at Inter Milan and Everton, the heavily-tattooed Italian was known as one of the hardest central defenders of his generation, picking up around two dozen red cards.\nBut he is best remembered for provoking Zinedine Zidane into headbutting him in the 2010 World Cup final after insulting the French legend’s sister. Zidane was sent off and Italy won the tournament.\nGoalkeeper Simonsen’s career in British football came to an ignominious end when he was banned earlier this year after being found guilty of betting on dozens of matches while playing for Scottish giants Rangers.\nThe Englishman, who has previously played for teams such as Everton and Stoke City, did not have his contract renewed after serving the ban.\nThe much-traveled Piquionne, who hails from New Caledonia, enjoyed success at a host of clubs in France, England and the United States, including Monaco and West Ham United.\nBut his time at the French club Saint Etienne ended in 2007 when he was convicted of assault for breaking the nose of a supporter who had insulted him in the club car park.\nVeteran Ivory Coast midfieldeis country’s mor Zokora, who is hst capped player, won many admirers in Europe during spells in England (Tottenham Hotspur), Spain (Seville) and France (Saint Etienne).\nBut his time in Turkey, where he played for Trabzonspor, was shrouded in controversy when he kicked the former national captain Emre in the crotch in apparent revenge after being racially abused in an earlier game. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:31:06.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
