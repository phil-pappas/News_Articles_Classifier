The UT Department of Tourism, the Chandigarh College of Architecture and the UT Department of Urban Planning are organising the four-day event. The symposium will be the culminating event of the series of activities started on August 27 to commemorate the death anniversary of the legend in the world of architecture. The aim of the event is to showcase the heritage of Chandigarh and the contribution of Le Corbusier towards the development of a modern way of living in India. The target group is not just the architectural fraternity but also the citizens of Chandigarh who need to be made aware of the uniqueness of the modern heritage and why it needed to be protected. Rajnish Wattas, the academic convenor of the event and a former Principal of the Chandigarh College of Architecture, said the symposium aimed at reflecting on Le Corbusier’s contribution to modernism, his myriad talents as an artist, architect, theorist and writer, and the synthesis of all these as manifested through his projects globally. However, a special and detailed focus will be on his work in Chandigarh and Ahmedabad. The symposium will also be a forum to seek expert advice regarding the multiple challenges/issues that Chandigarh faces today in conserving its precious modern architectural heritage (for which it is seeking UNESCO transnational inscription) and to balance it with the city’s burgeoning growth as a vibrant ‘smart city’. Book release on his birth anniversary The birth anniversary of Le Corbusier shall be commemorated with lectures by eminent architects and prize distributions for various painting, photography and design competitions. A book on Chandigarh by eminent architect MN Sharma, the first Indian Chief Architect of Chandigarh, shall be released on the occasion, followed by a cultural programme.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:34:14.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
