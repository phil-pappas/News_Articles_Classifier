The KSFA President ARKhaleel stated the showpiece event was not the only priority for them. “The under-17 World Cup is not the only priority. If we get it, we’ll do a great job and it will be great. But there will be other events too in the future. Something we are looking towards,” said Khaleel.“We are trying our best (to get the stadium work started). The odds are against us. We have the land, and we have people who will develop the land. Karnataka football will also get good funding,”said NAHarris, the Patron of the State football association.“It is not only the under-17 World Cup that we are worried about, there are other important events too. If we have a world-class stadium, we can host two big international standard matches per year here,” he added.“The association has already written to the government and we also met the chief secretary. The process is ongoing and could happen anytime. We are trying to finish it at the earliest. We gave them the documents one and a half months back. And are awaiting their reply,” he said.However, Khaleel said that the request of Ozone Group, the firm that won the bid for the stadium work, request of having 15 percent of the area for commercial purposes is something that could have delayed the process.“While the State government has allowed 10 percent of the land to be used for commercial purpose, Ozone has asked for 15 percent and that it is in discussion. We are eager to hear from the government and start the work. And the Ozone group has promised us that if we let them start the work by October 31, they can deliver a final product by March, 2017,” he said.Meanwhile, KSFAaccused the JSW for delaying the process of reconstruction stating that the tender for the reconstruction could have been called early if JSW had replied to their queries well in time. The JSWofficials refused to comment on the matter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:41:11.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
