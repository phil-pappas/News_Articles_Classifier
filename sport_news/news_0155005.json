He participated in some team drills a few hours after the Jets arrived in town Friday. Decker was injured nearly two weeks ago against Indianapolis and sat out team drills until Thursday. \nRunning back Chris Ivory and cornerback Darrelle Revis are both probable after fully participating in practice. Ivory was dealing with a strained quadriceps, while Revis had a sore hamstring. \nGuard Willie Colon (knee), tight end Jeff Cumberland (concussion), wide receiver Chris Owusu (knee), linebacker Trevor Reilly (finger) and cornerback Darrin Walls (hamstring) are ruled out. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:44:35.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
