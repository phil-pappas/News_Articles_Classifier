Special photo by Anthony Stalcup slideshow KENNESAW — Kennesaw Mountain celebrated homecoming by taking control in the fourth quarter of its 33-7 non-region win over Osborne on Friday.“We’ve had two really good weeks of practice and we’re trying just as hard as we can to improve as a group — offensively, defensively and in the kicking game — and I felt like we did that,” Kennesaw Mountain coach Andy Scott said. “Hats off to Osborne as they played extremely hard, but I’m just very proud of our kids.”Up 16-7 with less than 9 minutes remaining in the fourth quarter, the Mustangs (2-3) sealed the victory by taking advantage of three late Osborne turnovers and scoring the game’s final 17 points.Dewan Warbington’s 8-yard run into the end zone and a 27-yard field goal from Baylor Cantrell increased Kennesaw Mountain’s lead to 26-7 with 4:46 left. The Mustangs concluded the scoring when Brycen Colon intercepted a pass and returned it 76 yards for a touchdown with 35 seconds to go.“We tried to go back to some basics defensively,” Scott said. “We went back to our bread and butter and tried to play more of a base defense, and that really showed (Friday).”In all, Kennesaw Mountain’s defense came up with five turnovers, including two interceptions by Colon and three fumble recoveries, and allowed Osborne (0-5) only 172 total yards.On the opening drive of the game, the Mustangs’ Warren Estes broke loose for a 25-yard touchdown run, Cantrell kicked his first of three successful extra points and Kennesaw Mountain had a quick 7-0 lead.The Mustangs forced Osborne to punt on the ensuing possession but lost a fumble on the return, setting up a score by the Cardinals. A 3-yard touchdown pass from Deon Alexandre to Adarian Thompson and Jean-Baptiste Pierre’s point-after tied the contest at 7-all with 6:57 remaining in the first quarter.With a 38-yard field goal from Cantrell, Kennesaw Mountain went back on top 10-7 with 8:03 left in the second period.When the Mustangs got the ball back, they capitalized with a touchdown. Ryland Goede pulled in a 9-yard pass from Kyle Wooten, putting Kennesaw Mountain ahead by nine with 3:32 to go before halftime.The score stayed that way until the 8:20 mark of the final quarter.Estes gained 76 yards on eight carries to pace the Mustangs on offense. Warbington rushed 15 times for 72 yards.Osborne, playing its first game since Sept. 11, was led by Deshawn Jenkins, who ran for a game-high 123 yards in 20 attempts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:51:59.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
