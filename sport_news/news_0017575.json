When an excavator operator tried to dislodge yet another support for salvage, the wall gave way. The 2013 collapse did more than crush the Salvation Army shop next door; it exposed a system as structurally unsound as the unsupported wall.\nThere was hope of salvaging public safety improvements from the catastrophe. But after Mayor Nutter and City Council held their press conferences announcing reforms, the Department of Licenses and Inspections failed to follow through, even allowing demolitions without permits. Mired in destructive internal politics and a history of corruption, the agency is not likely to get better under this administration.\nWhile the pot-addled operator of the excavator pleaded guilty and the contractor's trial continues, this shameful tableaux is missing Richard Basciano, the building owner who pressed for a quick, cheap demolition. Basciano took over the estate of the city's most notorious property speculator, Sam Rappaport, and maintained his legacy of letting buildings rot. In 1997, a chunk of concrete that fell from one of those buildings killed a city judge.\nBasciano's run-down West Market Street properties included the collapsed 123-year-old building, which housed a hoagie shop, and a pornographic movie theater. When the neighborhood's prospects improved in spite of Basciano, he decided to cash in, setting the disaster in motion.\nSince the collapse, Basciano has quietly liquidated his Philadelphia properties, fetching more than $22 million. It's the best contribution he can make to a city he has so deeply disrespected. Now the buildings have a chance of being properly razed or renovated.\nThe people killed and injured in the collapse are victims of a structurally unsound system that enables unscrupulous landlords and contractors. City Hall's promises to fix it have not been kept. The next mayor must bring about a complete overhaul of L&I and ensure that these victims are the last.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:41:08.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
