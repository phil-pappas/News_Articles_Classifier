Menezes\nWhen one has lived through a historic event like the shooting down of an American U-2 aircraft over the Soviet Union at the height of the Cold War, it is of added significance. And so it is with ‘Bridge of Spies’ and director Steven Spielberg, who, now four decades into filmmaking, draws upon his vast know-how to lucidly recreate that period. It takes off in Brooklyn where the 1960s are well captured with old Chevrolets and Dodges gliding down the streets unhurriedly and men in old-cut suits dilly-dallying. Enter James Donovan (Tom Hanks), an insurance lawyer who has been asked to defend a Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Though America’s hatred for the Soviet Union is at its peak, it must show a sense of justice in not condemning him till proven guilty. But can an insurance lawyer handle a criminal case? That’s precisely what the film is about. For one thing Donovan becomes very unpopular with the New Yorkers. His house is stoned but he doesn’t even tell his wife Mary (Amy Ryan) about his assignment. All they know is he’s out on a fishing trip. Meanwhile, Gary Powers (Austin Stowell) has been nabbed after bailing out of the U-2 aircraft. Incidentally, the aircraft is believed to have taken off from Peshawar. Can there be an exchange of spies, even though not officially? So, Donovan is made to act in his personal capacity. Can his personal and patriotic selves clash? Abel, who has the best lines, is an astute man and Donovan can’t help but bond with him. Abel calls Donovan ‘The Standing Man’, a near-fictional character he has grown up to believe in. This only makes those bonds stronger. But the operation is riddled in bureaucracy with Thomas Watters (Alan Alda) and Wolfgang Vogel (Sebastian Koch) being cogs in the wheel. Actually, Spielberg has a vast canvass but with good psychological inputs, the cameos are carefully fleshed. Also slick cutting and editing keeps the narrative flowing and its 141-minute duration can hardly be felt. Tom Hanks may be looking a tad older and heavy, but he’s lost none of the skills that have made him one of Hollywood’s biggest stars. His roles in ‘Forrest Gump’ and ‘Saving Private Ryan’ readily come to mind. He is ably supported by Mark Rylance who underplays the role even as he gets under its skin. Austin Stowell and Alan Alda provide good cameos and so does Amy Ryan in a bit role that can be lost in the blink of an eye. Janusz Kaminski’s caressing camerawork and an inventive screenplay involving the Cohen Brothers, Ethan and Joel, are other assets in this not-to-be-missed classic.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:36:58.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
