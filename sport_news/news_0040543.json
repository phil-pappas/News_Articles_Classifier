They lost to Denver 112-94 on Thursday in Boulder, Colo., after giving up a 26-3 run in the second quarter.\n\"When things weren't going well, they'd hit a shot and we'd come back and try to get it back without making a pass or taking a tough, contested shot,\" coach Fred Hoiberg said after the game in a bulls.com report. \"That's not what this is about. It's about working the ball around, making quick decisions and getting good looks. Whether they go in or not, you want to get an uncontested shot. I think we took too many contested ones tonight.\"\nThe Bulls shot 34.4 from the field. They were a bit better from 3-point range (37.5 percent), although they knocked their long-range attempts from 39 in the preseason opener to 24 on Thursday.\n\"We have to play a lot harder,\" Joakim Noah told reporters after the game. \"I am disappointed with the way we played tonight. We got out hustled in every area. We are learning a new system and a new philosophy. We have to get better.\"\nIt's not all bad news. With two games in the books, there have been some standouts among the Bulls' young players. Nikola Mirotic has been sharp, scoring 18 points in each of the first two games.\nDoug McDermott shows signs of being the confident scorer he was in summer league. Through two contests, McDermott is averaging 19 points per game, shooting 44.8 percent from the field and 7-for-15 from 3-point range.\nAnother pleasant surprise is rookie forward Bobby Portis, who finished with 14 and 16 rebounds this week.\nThe final results will have more meaning when the Bulls use their full lineup. Pau Gasol (rest) and Taj Gibson (ankle surgery) were held out of the first two games and it's unclear if they'll play Saturday vs. Minnesota Timberwolves in Winnipeg, Canada. The Bulls return home for games on Monday and Wednesday at the United Center.\nDerrick Rose is expected to return to basketball activities this week after suffering a broken orbital bone below his left eye. Mike Dunleavy will miss at least a month of the regular season after back surgery.\n\"We worry too much about offense, including me,\" Jimmy Butler said Thursday, according to bulls.com. \"Everyone is adjusting to the new offense, everyone is learning their role. I don't think we were playing at a very high level to start the game. It went that way the rest of the game. We kept shooting the ball, trying to outscore the opponents. Obviously that didn't work. We need to count on our defense to win the game.\"\nâ€¢ Get the latest Bulls news via Twitter by following @McGrawDHBulls.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
