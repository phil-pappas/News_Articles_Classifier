Lucky Gunner sold 4,000 bullets to shooter James Holmes prior to the massacre; three other websites provided him with high-grade weapons.\n\"A few minutes before my daughter died, she sent me a text message. 'I can't wait for you to come next week. I need my mama,' she said,\" Ghawi's mother, Sandy Phillips, told The New York Times in 2012. \"I replied, 'I need my baby girl.' \"\nAdvertisement The case was dismissed before it could go to trial by U.S. District Senior Judge Richard P. Matsch because Colorado and federal laws protect firearms and ammunition sellers from liability based on a customer's wrongful acts. Not only was the case dismissed, but Ghawi's parents were liable for the legal fees of the defendants, $258,000, due to the Federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, a Colorado immunity law for firearms and ammunitions companies, and Colorado's House Bill 1208 from 2000.\n\"The killer in our case was able to amass ammunition, tear gas and body armor, things a normal civilian would not need and they didn't even bother to get an ID, or driver license on him,\" said Sandy Phillips, in a phone interview.\n\"There were absolutely no background checks required, and that puts the public in a very dangerous position, which we found out the hard way.\"\nThe judge reduced the legal fees the family had to pay to $203,000, as the Colorado laws only apply to firearm and ammunition sellers, with the company that sold Holmes tear gas grenades left to foot their own bill.\n\"The irony is the gun websites don't plan on using it to pay their attorney fees, which means their attorneys were free, probably supplied by the NRA, and that they are planning to give it to gun rights groups, which is an extra slap in the face,\" Phillips said. \"Our daughter is dead. We can't save her, but we can save another person's loved one, and that's why we filed the suit. We dropped the appeal, and we hope they drop their need for the $203,000, which will bankrupt us.\"\nJames Holmes was sentenced in August to life plus 3, 318 years, but the companies that supplied arms and other goods to Holmes — including nearly 6,300 rounds of ammunition, two Glock .40-caliber pistols, a .223-caliber semi-automatic rifle, a 12-gauge shotgun, protective clothing, beam laser lights, bomb-making material and handcuffs — face no repercussions, and the shooting incited no change in their business practices or amendments to current gun laws in Colorado. Their roles inspired no philanthropic efforts to the victims or their families.\n\"In the meantime, we are asking people to donate to our 501c3, which has nothing to do with the case, but it is our legacy called Jessi's Message, which will allow us to speak on what happened to us — not just with our daughter's murder but with all the other things that we discovered as gun owners who were shocked that there weren't checks and balances in place,\" Phillips said.\n\"These are deadly weapons, and ammo is meant for one thing, and that's to kill, so we just assumed of course there are checks and balances. The 501c3 allows us to go to speak where we're invited around the country to work with other mass shooting victims and survivors to give them the ability to use their voices and speak up as well, so it's very grassroots oriented.\"\nThe Phillips are still unsure of how they will pay the $203,000 in legal fees they are ordered to pay.\n\"We're hoping organizations will step up to help, but at the same time we don't want these people to have that money,\" Phillips said. \"They should not be able to get their hands on our daughter's blood money.\"\nMichael Sainato is a freelance writer based in Gainesville, Fla.\nTo send a letter to the editor about this article, submit online or check out our guidelines for how to submit by e-mail or mail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:04:45.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
