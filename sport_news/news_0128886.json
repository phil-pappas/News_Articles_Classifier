Amar's offer comes in the wake of recent allegations from Azam Khan that Amar Singh and BJP MLA Sangeet Som were plotting his murder.\n\"Azam Khan is like an elder brother to me. If he thinks I am hatching a conspiracy to murder him, then I appeal to the Union home minister Rajnath Singh to withdraw the security personnel which have been provided to me but ensure the safety of Azam Khan,\" Amar Singh told TOI on phone from London. He dismissed Azam's accusations as baseless.\nSom, BJP MLA from Sardhana, had alleged that Azam was trying to physically harm him. Amar Singh had also said he feared for his life from Azam since the latter was a powerful leader who had got him expelled from the SP. On Azam's allegations that Amar and Sangeet Som belong to the same community, the former SP leader said he enjoys good relations with politicians cutting across party lines. \"I am a Thakur and so is Sangeet Som. So what is wrong if we know each other well? I have cordial relations with top Congress leaders as well,\" Amar said.\nRefusing to comment on the speculation over his return to the SP, he defended party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav's decision to leave the Janata Parivar ahead of Bihar polls. \"Mulayam Singh left the alliance because Nitish Kumar ditched him and shook hands with the Congress,\" he said. The Congress had ditched Mulayam and booked him in disproportionate assets case and later on I was sent to jail by the Congress. \"But Nitish Kumar preferred Congress to SP,\" Amar Singh said.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-22T12:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:28:11.341+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
