Nichole Wren / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. The Calaveras Redskins emerged from their locker room for warmups at Frank Meyer Field on Friday prior to the game versus Argonaut, the way they always do — unified, two-by-two, hands locked. Only this week, the environment was different. The stands, usually packed with eager fans, were at half capacity. The railing outside the stadium, normally three or four rows deep with students, sat just a single line of socializers. The band, typically bold and strong, was represented by 11 who were gone by halftime. That’s how things usually are during Fall Break, said head coach Jason Weatherby And because of it, the Redskins came out flat. Of the four possessions Calaveras had on Friday in the first half, the Redskins turned the ball over on an interception once and on downs two other times and failed to score from the goal line as time expired, contributing to a 0-0 tie at halftime. “It was a little bit of everything. Just the buildup to the game wasn’t that great,” Weatherby said. “We didn’t have a real good week of practice. Kids are on break, most of them are sleeping until noon. They’re not doing anything during the day then they’re coming to practice.” When they came back to the field after halftime, they emerged a different team. The next four drives saw the Redskins score four touchdowns — all on the ground — before an eventual 26-7 victory against the Mustangs. “They’re kids. They were making those mistakes,” Weatherby said. “I chewed them out.” Penalties played a role in the game on Friday night in San Andreas. By the end of the evening, the Redskins were penalized for 80 yards, 60 of which came in the first half. However, Weatherby does not believe his team should’ve been penalized as much as they were. “Some people get in a position of authority like that and believe they have the ability to dictate where the game is going,” Weatherby said. “The reffing was horrible on both sides. The other coach and I talked about it. That was the first thing he said was ‘this has to be the worst reffed game he’s seen in a long time.’” On the night, the Redskins ran for 353 yards on the ground and four touchdowns. Weatherby said they were able to do so because their offensive line was able to do whatever was asked of them. “Any gap we wanted to hit, we could hit it,” Weatherby said. “We did a lot of stuff.” Anthony Giangregorio led the way for Calaveras on Friday night with 193 yards on 27 carries for one touchdown — a 65-yard score to seal the victory late in the fourth quarter. “He was huge,” Weatherby said. “On that rush (the 65-yard score), he had no lead blocker, he went too far outside. And so he just found a seam and just broke it. That was huge because he just has a good feel for where that run hits.” Next week, the Redskins have a bye week before travelling to Summerville in two weeks time. “My philosophy is to try and get the guys better that are banged up a little bit, make sure that they’re good,” Weatherby said. “We still have to run quite a bit to maintain that shape and we hit the weight room. Then we have a little bit of fun with it. We have a team dinner Thursday night that our whole team will be attending.” Follow UnionDemocrat.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:04:01.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
