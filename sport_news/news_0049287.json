Russell Stadium. “Tonight, we did that – especially on defense.” In a defensive struggle ultimately decided by turnovers, Navarre made the most of two first-half interceptions to win 20-9 against Panhandle rival Escambia. Both coming in the second quarter, Ryan Diamco stepped in front of a Trae Barry pass and returned it 32 yards to the Escambia 23. Four plays later, running back Hasaan Williams bulled in from 3 yards out for a 7-0 lead with 10:19 left before halftime. Three plays into Escambia’s next possession, it was Michael Sandle’s turn deep in Gator territory to intercept Barry. Three plays after the pick, quarterback Caine Adamson scrambled into the end zone from 13 yards out. The Raiders held that 14-0 lead at the break. “We really focused on our defense,” said Sandle, whose second interception with 2:06 left on the game clock iced the win. “We went back to the film from last year and really worked on the mistakes we made in that game. “But defense is really about everyone doing their assignment. If you do your assignment, and everyone else does their’s, this is how it’s supposed to turn out.” In a rematch of last year’s Class 6A region quarterfinals game won by Navarre 44-34, neither offense really was in sync, despite entering the game averaging nearly 550 yards rushing alone. Escambia limited Navarre to just 145 yards rushing, but the Gators had just 36, and that includes a brilliant 64-yard touchdown run by Jabre Brown with 6:39 to play in the fourth quarter. “That’s a tough offense to defense, and even harder to simulate in practice,” Walls said. “To do what our defense did tonight – I’m awful proud of those kids, because that’s a good team.” Brady Hammel kicked field goals of 34 and 35 yards in the second half for Navarre, while Escambia’s Emilio Maldonado connected from 23 yards. But it was the turnovers that kept Escambia (4-3) from spoiling Homecoming for the Raiders, who return to District 2-6A play next week at Milton. “We’re capable of a game like that as a defense against a good team,” Sandle said. “We’ll enjoy this for two days and then get back to work. We can be better, but tonight we were pretty good and that’s exciting.” By BOB HEIST | DAILY NEWS315-4404 | @bheistNWFDN", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:04:56.681+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
