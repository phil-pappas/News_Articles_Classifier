The motion was released Monday. \nOrtiz and Ernest Wallace, both from Hernandez's hometown of Bristol, Connecticut, were charged along with Hernandez in Lloyd's murder. Hernandez was given a life sentence in April. He's currently appealing the conviction. \nWallace's lawyers have already sought to dismiss the murder charge against their client. \nLloyd's body was found in an industrial park near Hernandez's North Attleborough, Massachusetts, home. Hernandez also stands accused of killing two men outside a Boston nightclub in 2012. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:51:24.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
