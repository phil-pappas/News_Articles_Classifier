So, you’re going to have six months of material increase, and generally… building materials do not decrease over a period of time. They increase,” McDonald said. \nHe says after the initial process is done, the building likely won’t get started until next summer. \nOfficials also say the project could still cost less than the estimated $8.4-million dollars, in which case the leftover money would not be used for the police station.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:02:02.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
