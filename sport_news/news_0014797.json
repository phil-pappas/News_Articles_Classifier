White slideshow POWDER SPRINGS — Hillgrove put the ball in play on several occasions, but it couldn’t generate much offense, losing 10-2 in six innings to Lowndes in the decisive third game of their first-round Class state playoff series Thursday.Lowndes pitcher Haley Fowler only allowed three hits and a walk, inducing most of Hillgrove’s batters into routine outs. The Vikettes also turned three double plays.“I told the girls at the end of the game that the key for us was peaking at the right points,” Hillgrove coach Laura Voyles said. “Instead of peaking at the end of the season, we peaked in the middle, and that cost us this series.”Lowndes, the No. 3 seed from Region 1 , moved on to face Region 8 champion Archer in the second round. Region 4 runner-up Hillgrove (22-12) saw its season come to a close after making four straight trips to the elite eight in Columbus.Hillgrove scored in the first inning when Savannah Stewart reached on an error and advanced to second. She then moved to third on a wild pitch before scoring on Kathryn Jackson’s fielder’s choice.Lowndes took over from there.Hillgrove pitcher Taylor DeCelles, who threw in each of the series’ first two games Wednesday, didn’t have her best stuff, and Lowndes capitalized. The Vikettes produced three runs on three hits, a walk and a hit batsman in the first inning. They added four runs on four hits, a walk and an error in the second to stake a 7-1 lead.Madison May’s RBI single scored Kyra Irvin for the 4-1 lead, and Rylin Hedgecock’s bases-clearing one-out double produced the other three runs.Tejah Ironside relieved DeCelles in the top of the third, but by then, Lowndes’ bats were dialed. Back-to-back doubles from Sophie Sumner and Fowler gave Lowndes a 9-1 advantage through three innings.DeCelles returned to get the final two outs in the third, but the damage had clearly been done. She was effective over the final three innings before Ellie Merrit’s two-out RBI single scored courtesy runner Taylor Jordan in the bottom of the sixth, bringing the run rule into effect.“Taylor threw 270 pitches (Wednesday) and 130 (Thursday),” Voyles said. “She’s been sore all year and has had some back issues, but she fought through it. She did the best she could and never gave up.”Hillgrove’s final run came in the third when Stewart singled, reached second on DeCelles’ fielder’s choice and scored on Jackson’s two-out single.Joli Rush also had a hit for Hillgrove.DeCelles allowed eight runs — seven earned — on nine hits through 5 2/3 innings. She also walked three and hit a batter. Ironside recorded one out, giving up two earned runs on two hits and a walk.“We worked hard all year and got better as the season went on,” Voyles said. “We’re young, and we’ll come back and get better next season.”Sumner was 2-for-4 with a double, two runs scored and an RBI. Merrit was 2-for-4 with three RBIs, and May scored twice.
