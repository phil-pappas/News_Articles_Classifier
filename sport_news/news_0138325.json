Probably not The Sports Quotient 1 day ago Keenan Donath © Lee Jin-man/AP United States' Jordan Spieth plays a chip shot onto the 12th green during his singles match against International team player Marc Leishman of Australia at the Presidents Cup at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea, in Incheon, South Korea, Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015. Whenever a prolific player is playing in his prime, the sport of golf usually grows in popularity. Thanks to Tiger Woods, the golfing world is well aware of the impact one individual can have on the perception and financial prosperity of the sport as a whole.\nAdChoices Now that it is safe to say that Tiger is out of the picture, a superstar is needed to energize a game that is unfairly associated with the elite . The world’s top-ranked golfer, Jordan Spieth, thrived this season and may be the one to fill the void. The talented 22-year-old Texan won the two most touted majors this year at Augusta and the U.S. Open, not to mention his top-five finishes at the season’s last two majors and the 2015 Tour Championship title.\nWith Spieth at the helm, the PGA tour is doing well; viewership has increased for the season’s premier events. This year’s Masters saw a 26 percent uptick in ratings while Spieth was holding a lead down the stretch. And Spieth is far from the only golfer on tour providing compelling performances.\nClose behind Spieth is the world’s third-ranked golfer and four-time major winner, Rory McIlroy, who has proven that he can dominate on golf’s biggest stage. PGA champion and world number-two Jason Day, along with long-bombing Bubba Watson, are also playing some of their best golf to date. With the competition being better than it ever has been, the PGA tour is enjoying a renaissance of sorts. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the rest of the golf industry in the United States.\nTo understand the current state of the golfing industry, a little context is necessary. When the Tiger bubble burst in 2009, golf lost its most marketable major winner, and a large chunk of viewers started to tune out. The ripples from that fateful day in November 2009 haven't stopped there. Woods' decline in both on-course success and popularity, along with a number of other important financial factors, have led to a huge drop-off in the American golfing economy.\nWhen Tiger was in his heyday, the surge in popularity for the sport made it easy for golf to reach a wide audience. What resulted was large-scale golf course construction in America during the late 1990s and early 2000s, giving newcomers to the game a chance to participate at a wide array of public and private facilities.\nBut the golfing landscape shifted dramatically after the country’s financial crisis in late 2007. Golf became a luxury that simply was not worth paying for. Compounded by Tiger’s misdeeds in 2009, the sport took a huge hit , unbeknownst to the casual fan.\nIf Tiger could invigorate a sport that had previously been known for its homogeneity and exclusionary practices, let’s hope that the vastly different Spieth can, too. But despite their wunderkind tendencies, they are both vastly different people, and the similarities between the two really end at the golf course.\nFor one, Tiger has generally appeared stoic and at times combative with media members and fans alike. Spieth, while not without his own idiosyncrasies , elects to inundate the press with minute details and charismatic reviews of his rounds at press conferences.\nFurthermore, Spieth may lack the type of background that attracts non-golfers to the game, but his happy-to-be-here attitude is catching on quickly with golf’s loyal followers. With the young man barely old enough to enjoy the post-victory champagne, fans of the PGA Tour are already starting to prepare themselves for a whole lot of the Texan in the coming decades.\nBut even if Spieth follows up his historic year with 20 years of great golf, it is hard to say if the sport will ever truly recover. In 2014 , 14 new courses were built in the United States, while over 150 closed their doors and stopped cutting the grass. It was the ninth straight year the amount of golf courses closing their doors exceeded the amount that were opening them.\nOther factors, such as dwindling water supplies in states like California , have been a major contributor, but golfer attrition is at the root of the industry’s slow collapse. In 2013, over 3.7 million took up the game, while over four million decided to abandon it. The most troubling statistic may be the drop off from golfers ages 18 to 34. Over 200,000 decided to quit, pointing to a possible generational shift.\nThe instant gratification that golf fails to provide hurts its chances of catching on with millennials, and many elect to take up cheaper and less time-consuming activities instead of golf. In an episode of Real Sports on HBO, Taylormade’s former CEO Mark King told Bryant Gumbel, “I think the issue we have in our sport is when you go out to a course, the environment around the game is not very fun and inviting.”\nThere are two different perceptions of golf in America. The game is thriving on the professional level but severely struggling as a sector of the competitive American economy. Hopefully, the widespread success of Jordan Spieth will be enough to bring golf back to par.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.economist.com/news/christmas-specials/21636688-though-thriving-parts-asia-golf-struggling-america-and-much-europe", "http://www.turfnet.com/news.html/_/construction-play-number-of-golfers-decline-in-2013-r249", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IpqqyvClfZ0", "http://tigerprints.clemson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1972&context=all_dissertations", "http://thesportsquotient.com/", "http://www.golf.com/golf-plus/death-golf-course-withering-californias-stevinson-ranch", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.pgatour.com/news/2015/04/13/masters-tv-ratings.html", "http://onpar.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/bidding-to-change-golfs-perception-as-sport-for-rich/"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:56:58.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
