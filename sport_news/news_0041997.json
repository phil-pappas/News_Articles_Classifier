Dry air allows overnight and morning temps to drop into the low 50s...even some 40s!...and low 60s. But with ample sunshine, afternoon temperatures will rise above the normal and reach the mid and upper 80s. This will be the case as we wrap up the week. But a stronger cold front will move through early Saturday with cooler air. Afternoons this weekend will remain in the 70s. Winds will also increase behind the weekend front.\nOrleans Parish School System Town Hall\nThis evening, school administrators, teachers, and parents can learn more about the future of the Orleans Parish school system.
