The Halo offers virtually unmatched ability to absorb and disperse high impact energy while reducing acceleration. In ASTM certification testing at an independent lab, the Halo reduced peak g-force acceleration significantly, compared to no head protection. Studies show, reducing acceleration predicts a lower risk of injury. Barely 10mm thin, it contours to any players' head while looking just like a headband.\n\"Thousands of athletes from the pros to youth leagues already use Unequal in soccer, football, baseball, hockey, lacrosse and action sports,\" says Jim Caldwell , executive vice president of Unequal . \"We commend TASCO for understanding their role in educating coaches on the issue of head injuries and providing them information on how to better protect their players.\"\nAbout the Texas Association of Soccer Coaches\nTASCO was formed in 1983 as a way to support the growth of soccer in the state of Texas. It has grown to over 1500 current members from the original handful of members who originally formed the organization.\nAbout Unequal\nUnequal's company mission is to protect people so they can perform at their peak in the military, sports, work and life. Its patented fusion of a military-grade composite made of Kevlar ® , Accelleron® and optional ImpacShield® is engineered for customized, concealed protection. Professionals, collegiate and youth athletes in football, baseball, soccer, hockey, lacrosse, action sports, contact sports and other activities, wear Unequal's protective head and body gear. Unequal's technology is protected by 100 Worldwide patents with many more pending. Its products have been tested by independent, accredited laboratories, OEM facilities and top universities.
