(Jim Rassol, Sun Sentinel) Christy Cabrera Chirinos Sun Sentinel \nWhen he was hired, the hope was that Al Golden could get Miami’s football program back on track. \nFour and a half seasons and several embarrassing losses later, that hasn’t proven to be the case and now, once again, the Hurricanes will again be looking for a new coach after Golden was fired Sunday evening. \nIn a release issued by the school, Miami announced it has named tight ends coach Larry Scott the interim coach, effective immediately. \nGolden, who previously coached at Temple, had a 32-25 career record with Miami, which is now looking to hire its fourth head coach since 2001, the year in which the Hurricanes last won a national title. \n“On behalf of my family I want to thank the University of Miami for a tremendous opportunity,” Golden said in a statement released by the school. “I believe in what we are doing and how we are doing it and we have some outstanding young men in our football program. Though this moment is difficult, we wish the Canes the best of luck going forward.” \nThough Miami athletic director Blake James said earlier in the year the school would evaluate Golden’s performance at the end of the season, Saturday’s 58-0 loss to Clemson sealed the former coach’s fate. \nThe Tigers came to Sun Life Stadium and embarrassed Miami, handing the Hurricanes their biggest loss in program history. \n“Coach Golden has led our program through some very difficult times and he has done so with class, integrity and a true desire to see our students succeed on the field, in the classroom and in the community.” James said in a statement released by the school. “However, we have a proud tradition of excellence at Miami, not just in football but in all sports, and we want to compete for ACC and national championships. I simply believe that now is the time to bring the Hurricane Family together and rally behind our young men.” \nUnder Golden, Miami never reached its goal of playing for an ACC title, never beat a team that finished the season ranked in the AP Top 25, and suffered 14 double-digit losses with seven of those coming in the last two seasons, culminating with Saturday’s loss. \nStill, though the end was ugly, midway through Golden’s tenure, there was hope. \nAfter Miami went 6-6 and 7-5 in his first two seasons, the team seemed to have turned the corner in 2013, with the Hurricanes winning seven straight to open the year and rising as high as No. 7 in the AP Top 25. \nBut that was followed by a demoralizing 41-14 November loss to FSU that sent the season into a tailspin. \nMiami went on to lose three of its last five games after that, including a 36-9 loss to Louisville in the Russell Athletic Bowl, the Hurricanes’ first postseason appearance after the school self-imposed two bowl bans in the wake of a protracted NCAA investigation. \nNot long after that, the drumbeat for Golden’s firing began from an angry fan base and several former players who were vocal in their opposition to how the team – particularly the defense – was playing. \nStill, despite the rumblings, James and former Miami president Donna Shalala opted to give Golden more time to try and fix the issues within the Hurricanes program, many of which stemmed from that investigation into the actions of a former booster. \nThough the violations uncovered by the NCAA and highlighted in an August 2011 story from Yahoo Sports happened before Golden arrived in Coral Gables, it was his tenure that was rocked by the charges and the ensuing investigation. \nFor more than two years, the coach found himself shepherding the program through the scandal, answering questions from reporters, recruits and their parents about possible punishments from the NCAA and the program’s future. \nIn October 2013, the NCAA released its findings, cited Miami for a lack of institutional control and stripped the Hurricanes’ football program of nine scholarships over the course of three years, but handed down no further postseason bans, clearing the way for Golden and Miami to move forward. \nSince, though, the Hurricanes have struggled on the field. \nAfter closing 2013 in disappointing fashion, the team was 6-7 in 2014, only its third losing season since Miami went 5-6 in 1979. The expectation was that the Hurricanes would have to compete for the Coastal Division crown and the ACC championship for Golden – who faced increasing pressure game after game – to keep his job. \nAnd though Miami opened the season with four straight wins, struggles against both FAU and Nebraska seemed to set the tone for how the rest of the year would play out. The Hurricanes lost back-to-back games to Cincinnati and Florida State before mustering a 10-point win over Virginia Tech. \nThat was followed by Saturday’s loss against Clemson. \nMiami travels to face Duke next Saturday at 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:57:52.067+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
