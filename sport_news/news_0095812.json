He only played to win, and so he did.\nWhich is its own form of revenge, isn’t it?\nIn a game that was far more of a struggle than many New Englanders expected, Brady stood tall and stayed cool. His father may have wanted to see him drop 60 points on the deflated Indianapolis Colts, but what Brady understood was the pursuit of such a thing can defeat your true purpose. You lose because you forget the point is winning, not revenge.\nBrady was not spectacular in the way he so often has been, but he was efficient where his counterpart, Andrew Luck, was inefficient. He was calm where Colts coach Chuck Pagano was panic stricken when down by only six points very late in the third quarter. The upshot of all that was he won, 34-27, when a more frenzied quarterback might have lost.\nThis time it was the Colts coach, not its quarterback, who made the bonehead play of the day — but the effect was the same. Once it was done, Brady leapt upon it like a pride of hungry lions does a wounded antelope and tore their heart out.\nThe Colts ran an ill-advised fake punt that looked like it came out of Pete Carroll’s Super Bowl playbook, turning the ball over at his own 35-yard line with 72 seconds left in the quarter. As Pagano’s stunned defense ran onto the field, the dead eyes of a professional assassin stared back at them.\nThey expected, and surely feared, Brady would immediately attack them with a passing game that would ultimately produce nearly 75 percent of the Patriots offense. Instead, he handed the ball off to LeGarrette Blount three straight times — and then ran again on a third down draw to Dion Lewis that gained seven yards on third-and-6.\nAs the Colts’ minds were reeling, Brady’s mind was operating like a Swiss watch when, two plays later, he found his initial reads taken away and stepped first left and then rolled right, flushed from the pocket as he’d often been this evening. As he rolled, linebacker Jerrell Freeman foolishly left Blount to try and run Brady down from a distance way too far away to make a play. As he did, Blount went from his position in the middle of the field to following Brady as linebacker D’Qwell Jackson tried to catch him from behind.\nBrady knew immediately neither linebacker would win their footraces, as Blount flashed in front of him on what was now a shallow cross. The moment he did, Blount received a bullet from a master marksman, hitting him right in stride in a way that allowed him to scamper (does Blount ever really scamper?) for an easy 11-yard touchdown and a 34-21 lead.\nThe moment had come where the game would be decided and Brady delivered, as he so often has against the Colts regardless of who their quarterback was. He’d done it time and again to Peyton Manning, and now has done it five straight times to Luck — although this time he got an odd assist from Pagano, who if he gets fired at the end of the season may have actually slit his throat at that moment.\nBrady was far from his usual accurate self. He had balls tipped at the line of scrimmage, threw more than a few off-target and certainly didn’t avenge Deflategate in the way some expected. Yet when it counted most, he made the throw that separated the Patriots from the Colts. And once the dust settled at Lucas Oil Stadium, his arm had produced 312 of the Patriots’ 417 total yards, and three of his team’s four touchdowns.\nMuch of the game the Colts had taken Rob Gronkowski away from him, yet when he needed him most — on the opening drive of the second half after trailing by one at halftime — Brady found him too with a 25-yard touchdown pass across the middle that gave the visitors back the lead.\nTypical of how he has won so many games for the Patriots, Brady had led a nine-play, 63-yard drive in the final 21⁄2 minutes of the second quarter as well, but stalled when tight end Scott Chandler was flagged for interference on what appeared to be a 7-yard touchdown pass with seconds left.\nThe Pats had to settle for a field goal that cut the deficit to one, but knew it was getting the ball to open the third quarter. And Brady understood scoring again would reassert what everyone in football had felt would be their presumed dominance over the Colts.\nIn both cases, when Brady had to make a play, he made it. When he most needed to deliver, he delivered. It is what separates him from Luck and nearly all his peers. Despite the offense’s many struggles, he delivered 10 points in the game’s most critical moments, and then leapt on an Indianapolis coaching mistake to end their hopes for good.\nCertainly the Pats defense had a say in things as well, frustrating Luck throughout much of the second half after he’d put 14 points on them in the first 30 minutes. That defense limited the Colts to only 119 total yards until Indianapolis’ final scoring drive of the night, an 85-yard march that made the score closer than the game was.\nThey had done their jobs at critical moments as well, but not as well as Tom Brady. He may not have gotten his revenge in the way New England or his Dad had hoped, but he got something more.\nBrady got the win because all week long he was the eye of the storm, the calm middle of the maelstrom surrounding this game. He came to Lucas Oil Stadium last night not to make a point, but just to win the game.\nAs usual, he did.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:42:23.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
