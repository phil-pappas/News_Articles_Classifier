Boston Bruins forward Brad Marchand sustained a concussion Saturday night against the Montreal Canadiens.\nAdChoices Marchand left Boston's 4-2 loss midway through the third period after taking an inadvertent elbow to the side of his head from Canadiens forward Dale Weise. He was helped off the ice and did not return to the game.\n\"We're going about it with the league's protocol with concussions and his return will be dictated by how quickly he recovers ... so we have no timetable for him,\" coach Claude Julien told the team's website Sunday.\nThe Bruins (0-2-0) are also missing defensemen Zdeno Chara (upper body) and Dennis Seidenberg (back). Chara practiced Sunday and is questionable for the game Monday against the Tampa Bay Lightning.\nThe team also placed defenseman Matt Irwin on waivers.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportsxchange.com/tsxfiles/topstories", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:30:35.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
