But, instead it’s something else. \n“There are some weeks when we use the word disappointment,” coach Brian Polian said. “I’m not sure disappointment is the correct word coming out of last week. It is more frustration. Disappointment insinuated you did a lot of things well and things just didn’t bounce your way that day. That was not the case in Laramie. We didn’t deserve to win that game. We didn’t do enough good things.” \nThe Wolf Pack (3-4, 1-2 MW) aims to flip that script Saturday when it hosts Hawaii (2-5, 0-3) for its homecoming game. Nevada is just 5-5 at home the last two seasons, so home hasn’t been too kind. But coming off its frustrating effort against Wyoming, Polian is hopeful for a bounce-back performance. \n“We need to show the type of character and fight I think this team’s got,” Polian said. \nHere are three keys to Nevada’s game against Hawaii, which kicks off at 1 p.m. at Mackay Stadium. Nevada-Hawaii: Position breakdown and a prediction \n1. Bring the juice \nThe common theme among Wolf Pack players post-Wyoming is the team didn’t play with any fire. “You have to go into every single football game with the same energy and same approach and you have to fly around when you go out there and play with energy,” running back Don Jackson said. “If you don’t, it will bite you in the butt.” Jackson and defensive end Lenny Jones, both senior captains, said it up to them to “bring the juice” and get their respective sides fired up. Nevada was caught looking at Wyoming’s record last week, but can’t do the same this week. It has to play inspired football. \n2. Be ready from start \nIn its three Mountain West games, Nevada has been outscored 44-21 in the first half, and that’s with the Wolf Pack being a betting-line favorite in each game. The Wolf Pack is yet to score a first-quarter point in MW play. Those things must change. Nevada doesn’t have the firepower and efficiency to dig from behind every game. The margin for error for this team is small. If Nevada spots the opponent a halftime lead, it’s building a bigger mountain to climb. In the Wolf Pack’s perfect world, Nevada gets an early touchdown lead and can nurse its running game and pass-rushing skills to a double-digit win. \n3. Don’t turn it over \nA lot of the focus has been on negative trends given how the Wolf Pack has played of late, but let’s look at a positive one: Nevada has just five turnovers in seven games, the best mark in the MW and the seventh-best mark in the nation (and one of those was a punt that took a bad bounce off a Wolf Pack blocker). QB Tyler Stewart has limited his mistakes and Nevada’s running backs/wide receivers don’t have a fumble this year. Hawaii hasn’t created many turnovers, so this trend should hold firm. Given the Wolf Pack’s aforementioned limited margin for error, Nevada can’t afford to lose the turnover battle. 7 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.rgj.com/1S1ed9E TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:16:59.746+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
