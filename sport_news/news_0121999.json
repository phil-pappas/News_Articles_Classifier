Hamilton, 48 points clear of Rosberg, is also closing in on successive driver titles. \n\"It will be a very big achievement,\" Wolff added. \"It would be the second title and the constructors' championship makes us proud. We will add a little bit of history and nobody can take that away from us, so that is important. \n\"What makes me particularly proud is that it is such a big group of individuals having worked so hard. I know that sounds boring, but it is an achievement of having built a car and an engine which is very dominating in an era.\" \nMercedes have won 27 of the last 33 races, and have been on pole at all but one race this season - the only exception being in Singapore where they were mysteriously off the pace. \nWolff added: \"You just need to come out of that with a calm approach. We have done that. We bounced back in Suzuka and we have had a good day here. How the team keeps developing is just nice to be a part of. It is a really team effort.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:59:31.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
