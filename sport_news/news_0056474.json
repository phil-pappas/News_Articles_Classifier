Caption (Craig Lincoln for Shaw Media) The Morris football team takes the field Friday night before a 35-21 loss to DeKalb. By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nMORRIS – With 3:23 left in the first half Friday night, the Morris football team trailed DeKalb, 28-0, after the Barbs’ Cole Tucker nabbed his third touchdown reception. Related Links Morris looking to trip up Yorkville on Friday \nAfter losing, 42-0, to DeKalb the season before, the Redskins could have put their heads down and let this game play its course. \nBut they didn’t, turning to something new and then something old to pick themselves off the deck and fight the rest of the way. In fact, after DeKalb took the 28-0 lead, Morris outscored the Barbs, 21-7, the rest of the night. \nMorris faced second-and-10 from the DeKalb 36-yard line in the final minute of the first half. Running back Keagan Sobol went in motion to the right, where he received a lateral from quarterback Nathan Guth. Instead of running upfield behind the blockers in front of him, Sobol stopped and threw a pass to Delaney Stutzki, who had slipped behind the DeKalb defense. Stutzki caught the pass and waltzed into the end zone, giving Morris a much-needed shot in the arm heading into halftime. \nThen, during halftime, they talked. \n“It was all about Redskin pride,” Sobol said about the locker room at halftime. “Redskin pride is heart. It’s been here forever, and this team has it, too. \n“That play before the half, we’ve worked on it in practice, but usually it’s [Michael] Feeney throwing it. But, he wasn’t in there on that play, so I got a chance to do it. I haven’t thrown a lot, but I made it work. That seemed to spark us a little bit.” \nThe spark turned into a fire in the second half. DeKalb opened the half with a nine-yard touchdown run by David Long to make it 35-7, but Morris held the Barbs scoreless the rest of the way. Helping that was an interception in the end zone by Michael Cryder, the first time all season that DeKalb quarterback Derek Kyler had been picked off. \nMeanwhile, the Morris offense found some footing. The Redskins got great field position on the kickoff after Long’s touchdown, as Tommy Balentine returned the kick 25 yards to the Redskin 45, then Morris got 15 more yards when DeKalb was flagged for a horse collar tackle on the play, setting the Redskins up at the Barbs’ 40. Two plays later, Guth hit Balentine along the left sideline for a 38-yard touchdown to make it 35-14. \nAfter Cryder got the pick in the end zone, Morris drove to the DeKalb 10, where a fourth-down pass fell incomplete. Morris eventually took over on its own 20 after a DeKalb punt and began another drive. On third-and-10, Guth hit Balentine for a 16-yard gain and later, on third-and-7, he hit Sobol for an 11-yard gain. On third-and-5, Guth hit Stutzki for a six-yard gain to keep the drive going. The drive finally reached the seven, and Balentine ran for a four-yard gain before Feeney scored from three yards out with 2:45 to play. \nIt was a case of too little, too late, but it was also been better late than never. \n“I love the way the kids worked,” Morris coach Alan Thorson said. “We outscored them in the second half and there was a lot of fight in us. DeKalb is a good team. They have a lot of speed and skill, they are well-coached and we went toe-to-toe with them. \n“It could have gotten ugly when we got down 28-0, but there’s no giving up in these kids. I hate losing, but I am proud of the way they kept fighting.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:56:33.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
