DOVER, Del. — For a driver on the brink of championship elimination, Kevin Harvick might have the biggest target at Dover.\nThe mission is clear: Knock out Harvick, knock out a champion.\n\"Everyone in this Chase knows they are the biggest threat for the championship,\" four-time champ Jeff Gordon said. \"If they get eliminated then that takes the biggest threat out of it.\n\"Kevin and that team are going to be working hard and all the other teams are going to be working hard to win this race and potentially eliminate one of the biggest threats.\"\nHarvick and his team have been doing a pretty good job of taking themselves out of the running in their title defense.\nTime may have run out on the No. 4 Chevrolet.\nThe third race in NASCAR’s playoffs is crucial — the bottom four drivers out of the 16 in the field are eliminated.\nHarvick is 15th and will have to win to advance and remain in championship contention.\nKyle Busch, Paul Menard, Harvick and Clint Bowyer are in the bottom four and most at risk of elimination Sunday.\n\"We’ve still got racing to do,\" Bowyer said.\nJust not Friday.\nThere was no action on the track because rain wiped out qualifying at Dover International Speedway.\nEven when it rains, the sun shines on Joe Gibbs Racing.\nWith the field set on points, Matt Kenseth has the pole and is followed by JGR teammates Denny Hamlin and Carl Edwards. Hamlin won the Chase opener at Chicagoland and Kenseth won last week at New Hampshire to earn automatic berths in the next round.\nThe rest of the Chase grid looks like this: Jimmie Johnson is fifth, followed by Ryan Newman, Kurt Busch, Brad Keselowski, Martin Truex Jr., and Gordon. Jamie McMurray is 11th and Dale Earnhardt Jr. 12th.\nHarvick is 0-for-29 at Dover. He has two wins and a series-best 18 top-fives, but has busted out in the Chase. Harvick finished 42nd in the Chase opener and was 21st last week at New Hampshire. He was runner-up to Johnson in May in the first Dover race.\nHarvick thrives on pressure and took the checkered flag in must-win races last season at Phoenix and Homestead to take the title.\n\"It’s just really part of sports and that’s what makes it exciting,\" Harvick said.\nThe only excitement Friday was found inside Dover’s media center.\nGordon, a five-time Dover winner, was feted by the track as he winds down his 23-year career. Gordon received proclamations from the city of Dover and Delaware’s House of Representatives and Senate. Dover also presented him with 90 miniature Monster trophies for his entire No. 24 team and his family.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:42:25.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
