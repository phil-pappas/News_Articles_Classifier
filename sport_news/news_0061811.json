The Bulldogs set a new record for wins in each of the past two seasons and last year they won their first regional title since 1990. The winning trend has continued this fall for a team that’s 18-5 overall, 9-1 in conference and in prime position for the NUIC East title, leading Dakota, Durand and Milledgeville by a game even after a recent loss to Milledgeville. But the success that Aquin is having this season has a different feel to it. Partly because the Bulldogs weren’t expected to be doing this well. “After last year we lost a lot of seniors and people were like ‘Oh, they’re not going to be as good,’’’ Aquin’s senior go-to outside hitter Cassie Arndt said. “That definitely keeps us going just to prove that we can be just as good as last year’s team and maybe even better. We go out there and play to be the best.” Arndt has played for three different coaches during her varsity career, but the spirited leadership that 2009 Aquin grad Michelle Gallagher has brought to the program in her first year as coach is a big reason why the Bulldogs are exceeding expectations. Gallagher isn’t too far removed from her playing days, which continued at the college level with St. Ambrose University. And she still brings a player’s excitement to the court. Her team has been able to feed off of that energy. “Her enthusiasm is great,” Arndt said. “We love it so much. When we watch film we look at her on the sideline and she’s jumping and screaming and kicking her legs and it’s really funny. “But she’s a great a coach and really pushes us to be our best.” “She’s always keeping us up even if the momentum is not on our side,” junior middle hitter Griffin Koester said. “She gets excited for us and it makes us feel better about ourselves.” Gallagher admitted that she initially felt a little intimidated by her first varsity head coaching job. It would be hard not to be, considering the success Aquin has had recently and the challenges that come with trying to maintain that standard. But the group of players that Gallagher inherited have made the transition a smooth one. “I have a really well-rounded, hard-working team that has kind of been open to anything and willing to try new things,” Gallagher said. “We’ve been pretty compatible with each other. I feed off of their strengths and I think they’ve done a pretty good job of feeding off of mine with a pretty open line of communication. That’s helped us be successful this year.” Page 2 of 2 - Aquin’s season began with a loss to a strong Lena-Winslow team on the road, but the way that the Bulldogs responded showed just how tough of a team they would be to deal with this season. They bounced back with a win over three-time defending state champion Keith Country Day in their very next match. And aside from a few tough tournament game losses to three bigger schools, they’ve been able to roll through their schedule and become the team to beat in their half of the NUIC. “We try to think that every game is just as important as another game down the road,” Koester said. “And even if the game isn’t as important, we go into it as if it’s a regional championship and put our all into it.” While the Bulldogs’ ability to stay focused on each match has been key, their chemistry as a group and team-first attitude has also played a vital role in helping them continue their recent trend of success on the court. “I’ve been playing with these girls and have known them since I was little,” Arndt said. “We’re all very comfortable with the each other. We support each other and we rely on each other.” “We have a fair amount of healthy competition but we have a very good sense of the team aspect,” Gallagher said. “They get very excited for each other to excel even more than themselves. That’s really helped drive us forward.” By Adam Kradle", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:28:51.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
