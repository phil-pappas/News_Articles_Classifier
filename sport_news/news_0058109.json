Steadman Natatorium earlier this week, his Monmouth University swimmers turning laps in the water behind him, his understanding of the program’s history was as important as his 20 years of Division I coaching experience.\nBecause it’s the faded certificates on the wall proclaiming All-American status and collegiate record times that provide a sense of what’s possible as the Hawks head into their first competitive meet in 32 years Friday at Fordham.\nAnd for the Avon native, the return to the Jersey Shore, and this pool in particular, is about coming full circle in a life spent around the sport.\n“I swam here in (former Monmouth coach) Dick Steadman’s summer programs in the 1970s when I was a little kid, 6-, 7-, 8-year-old,” said Nunnally, 45, who spent the past 15 years coaching at LaSalle, his alma mater. “And later I swam for CJAC (Central Jersey Aquatic Club) in this pool. But I just loved being a part of Dick Steadman’s programs. He was great. And I was around the Monmouth teams he coached. I got to know some of the alumni, so I have a relationship with some of those people, which is cool.”\nIn his attempt to revive the once-thriving program, Nunnally is leaning heavily on the past to provide a roadmap for future success.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:05:43.412+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
