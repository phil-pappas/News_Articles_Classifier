He has also been included in the initial list of players for the Bangladesh Premier League which is scheduled from November 25.\nThe source said Aamer through his agent had already approached the PCB and asked for permission to play the BPL if possible.\nMeanwhile, tall left arm pacer Mohammad Irfan has also been caught up in a ball tampering row in the qualifying rounds but the team which initially made the accusation against him (State Bank) have now changed their stance.\n\"We never made any official complaint over ball tampering with reference to Irfan to the match referee,\" the State Bank manager Zaheerul Hassan said.
