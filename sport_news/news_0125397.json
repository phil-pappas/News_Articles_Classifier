Robinson Chirinos also smoked a big homer off of Price in the fifth inning.\nAfterward, Chirinos, who caught Price a bit in Tampa Bay, said the big man might have been taking it a bit easier against the lower half of the order.\n“Yeah, I mean, anything you can gain against David Price is a plus.He relaxed a little bit with the people at the bottom of the lineup,” Chirinos told a few media members in a happy Texas locker room.\n“He didn’t throw that hard against the seven, eight and nine hitters, so I tried to be aggressive and get a fastball. I was able to hit it it out of the ball park.\n“It meant a lot,” he said of the home run, which extended the lead to 4-1 and came after Odor was hit again by Price.\n“I’m really happy with the way I allowed this team to get a win against a good pitcher.”\nChirinos hit 10 home runs in the regular season and has belted 24 in 622 career at-bats, so he has some pop. Still, he wasn’t sure he had done enough to circle the bases.\n“No, I hit it really good, but I thought I hit it too high. For one moment I thought it was going to stay in ... I was saying: ‘Go, go.’”\nTOUGH COOKIE\nBoth teams lost their star third basemen to injury.\nAdrian Beltre pulled up lame and was later diagnosed with a back strain. There was no structural damage, but he is questionable for Friday’s game.\nBeltre is an iron man, and it was incredibly difficult to get him out of the game.\n“You saw how hard it was for us to get him out of the lineup and off the field,” Josh Hamilton said after the game.\n“That’s the type of player he is. He’s played with a lot of pain in the past. He would have continued to go right there if we would have let him. We’ve got to encourage him too. ‘You’ve done what you can right now, we need you tomorrow and the rest of the series.’\n“Having seen him trying to run to second base. Sometimes it takes teammates to let him know it’s OK (to leave the game). Hopefully everything works out and he’ll be OK.”\nJays’ Josh Donaldson, meanwhile, took a knee to the head from Odor while trying to break up a double play and left the game after playing defence in the top of the fifth inning.\nOdor said it was a hard hit, but unintentional.\n“He hit me on my knee. I jumped and when I was in the air he hit me in the knee,” Odor said.\n“I’m OK. It hurt a little bit. He hit me pretty hard, or I hit him.”\nPRESSURE OFF?\nNot surprisingly, many Texas players thought the opening win was huge for the team’s confidence.\n“I think it takes a lot of the pressure off for tomorrow, getting the first game,” said reliever Sam Dyson, a former Blue Jays farmhand. “It kind of makes it easier as a group, but it can’t be a letdown. We’re going to push forward.”\n“Getting Game 1 is always good, especially here,” added fellow reliever Jake Diekman. “This place was rocking. It was fun.”\nHAMELS TIME\nIt doesn’t get any easier for the Blue Jays, with proven veteran Cole Hamels starting Friday for the Rangers.\n“He’s a guy when, he got traded here, he got traded for big games,” Chirinos said.\n“He threw that 162 game against Anaheim, he threw a complete game, so to have him go tomorrow, it’s going to be big for us.”\nAdded manager Jeff Banister: “What he has meant to our ball club is that initially we were underneath. We were below .500 and nobody even cared where we were at and thought that we got Cole for next year and beyond. The reality is that there was a belief system within that clubhouse and one that the front office also believed in what we were capable of doing.\n“We noticed the grit and passion. He couldn’t wait to assimilate himself inside our clubhouse and start growing with our group of guys, which told me that there was still a lot left, a lot that he wanted to do. He wanted to add value to our ball club.”\nPEREZ GETS GAME 3\nBanister said before the game that lefty Martin Perez will take the hill for Game 3 in Arlington. The decision was a mild shock, with many thinking fellow left-hander Derek Holland would get the start.\n“We like how he pitches. No, that’s the short answer, but really this is the body of work and how he’s thrown the ball lately,” Banister explained.\n“We like the fact that he’s primarily a ground-ball guy. Plus, the opportunity to have another couple of veteran arms available to us here early on in the bullpen if we need him ... Look, we like all five of our starters. We can feel good about any of them posting up for us.”\nBanister said Holland “wants to be out there and compete,” but is a team player and was able to handle the situation.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nWOLSTAT\nBottom of Rangers order key to victory over Blue Jays\nBy Ryan Wolstat , Toronto Sun First posted: Thursday, October 08, 2015 11:53 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 09, 2015 12:00 AM EDT\nIt wasn’t the well-known Texas boppers that did David Price in on Thursday, it was the bottom of the order.\nRougned Odor, who had never faced Price before, went 1-for-2 (with a homer), was hit by two pitches by Price and scored three runs.
