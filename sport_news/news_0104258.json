It is already provoking frustration among the players who have been through this too many times before. \nThe opening night setting on Thursday night sported a new decor, mind you. \nIn near-unanimous fashion, the fans wore the orange Oilers jerseys the club had given to season-ticket holders, lending a Halloween feel to Rexall Place. That was enhanced by the orange scarves that had been draped on the seats. Another opening-night freebie. \nThere was a lovely nod to the players of the WHA era when Al Hamilton, the team’s first captain, came to centre ice to drop the ceremonial puck. \nYou felt the history most intensely late-ish into the second period, when Ryan Smyth was introduced, provoking an orange-tinged standing ovation, a salute to the Banff native’s long and distinguished service with the Oilers. \nAfter the current team was introduced, one-by-one — McDavid drew the biggest cheer, albeit a modest one — they just got on with the game. No elaborate pre-game whoop-de-doo at all. \nAnd, apart from the ovation for Smyth, not much to whoop it up about during the match itself, apart from a goal by winger Lauri Korpikoski, one of a cluster of off-season acquisitions, who gave the Oilers a 1-0 lead just 1:36 into the opening period. \nThat stood up for less than two minutes, as Jori Lehtera chipped in a rebound off the rush at 3:14 to tie the game 1-1. \nEarly in the third period, the Oilers down 3-1, Taylor Hall seized control of things, collecting the puck off a faceoff, streaking in front of Blues goaltender Brian Elliott and chipping it past him to slice the Blues’ lead to 3-2. \nThat brought the sleepy Rexall Place pumpkin patch to life, at least until Alexander Steen made it 4-2 St Louis with 2:09 to go in the game, and that was that. Four games, four straight losses for the Oilers, an eerily familiar early-season pattern. \n“There are still 78 more (games),” a frustrated Hall said. “But every game you lose, especially in this division and this conference, makes it that much harder throughout the year. \n“We’re going to have to have a good day of practice (Friday) and do whatever we can to come out in a building in Calgary (Saturday night) that’s going to be a high-energy Battle of Alberta. There’s no reason not to get up for that.” \nAsked whether he sees elements of the team’s play or make-up that ward off the old, ‘here-we-go-again’ feeling that many of the fans seemed to be feeling? \n“Yeah,” Hall said. “Throughout a lot of the game, we were (competing) with them and we hung around. But that’s just not enough anymore. Three years ago, I would have taken a moral victory out of that, but we’ve had way too many of those.” \nThe Oilers’ 0-4 start has reinforced the reality that, revamped lineup or not, they have urgent work to do getting to know one another, not to mention demonstrating a greater affinity for defence, for not having crucial lapses that lead to goals. \nThe list of shortcomings is depressingly familiar to Oilers fans. \nHead coach Todd McLellan has underscored that steady improvement will be a slow process. He saw some step-up from the team’s no-show performance in a 4-2 loss in Dallas. But that was small comfort. \n“That wasn’t a very good game anywhere on the rink,” McLellan said of the Dallas loss. “Things went a lot better for us tonight than in Dallas, but still obviously not good enough.” \nMcLellan said the energy and confidence on the Oilers bench went through a roller-coaster ride during the game. \n“Emotionally, we’re up and down,” McLellan said. “That comes probably from not winning at this point. \n“It comes from frustration. When frustration creeps in, then you get away from what you’re supposed to be doing. \n“I do feel that rolling, that up and down on the bench, and we’ve got to fix that.” \nThey have to correct whatever is scuttling their power play, also. \n“With the talent that we have and the ability to execute when it’s going well, we should be better in that area and we’re not now, so it’s a concern,” said McLellan of his team’s manpower units, which went 0-for-five in the game. \nThe Oilers didn’t quit, say that for them. But Hall, for one, has had enough of surfing on potential. \n“It’s the NHL, man,” Hall said. “We’ve got to find a way (to win.) \n“We’ve been losing to St. Louis for five years now and we’ve got to find a way to win.” \nIt’s frustrating when the future never seems to arrive. \njmackinnon@edmontonjournal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:52:32.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
