The duty of the board is to rebuild its image on a priority basis.”\nManohar said he planned to appoint an independent ombudsman — or an ethics officer — to take up any dispute involving Indian cricket.\n“I plan to lay down norms to prevent corruption in the game,” he said. “A perception exists that the BCCI is not transparent and has something to hide because information does not come out.\n“To clear this myth, all the financial dealings of the board, including the balance sheet, will be posted on the BCCI website.”\nHe also promised central contracts for women cricketers, revival of the National Cricket Academy in Bangalore, and financial accountability in the state units.\nManohar’s elevation is expected to be a setback for Narayanaswami Srinivasan, the controversial head of the ICC, who was stood down as BCCI chief by the Supreme Court last year over conflict of interest charges.\nManohar has publicly blamed Srinivasan for bringing the BCCI into disrepute following a Supreme Court probe that found Srinivasan’s son-in-law guilty of corruption in the Indian Premier League.\nThe court also forced Srinivasan to give up the ownership of the IPL franchise Chennai Super Kings, which was in July banned along with Rajasthan Royals from taking part in the money-spinning Twenty20 tournament for the next two editions.\nIt remains to be seen if the Manohar-led BCCI will endorse Srinivasan’s bid to serve out his two-year term as ICC chairman which ends in June next year.\nManohar said he planned within a month to address conflicts of interest with regards to players, support staff and administrators. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:56:53.538+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
