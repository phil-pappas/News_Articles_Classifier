But on Tuesday he surprised the Jays with a lead-off bunt single. Escobar said afterward that he didn’t go into the at-bat planning to bunt. “I saw the third baseman, he’s playing a little bit back, that’s why I’m bunting in the first inning.” Obviously the bunt wasn’t the big blow, but it portended a shaky first for Dickey, who then allowed a two-run homer to Ben Zobrist, before walking Lorenzo Cain, giving up a single to Eric Hosmer and allowing two more runs to score on a passed ball and a sacrifice fly in a mixed bag of misery for Jays fans.\nDickey done early\nThe 40-year-old knuckleballer has had shaky starts before, but he often settles in and can sometimes turn an outing on its head by throwing five or six scoreless innings after giving up a crooked number in the first. But after Alex Rios homered in the second and Dickey plunked Escobar before walking Cain again, John Gibbons wasn’t about to see what would happen next. “Looked like there was a lot of movement on it,” Gibbons said of Dickey’s pitch. “. . . But he had trouble commanding it.” Dickey’s start of just 1 2/3 innings was his shortest in seven years and marked just the third time in his career he failed to get out of the second inning. “I had trouble arresting the damage,” he admitted.\nHendriks’ heroics\nWith the Jays in an early 5-0 hole, Gibbons turned to Liam Hendriks to keep them afloat. The Australian right-hander did just that, throwing 4 1/3 scoreless innings while allowing just one baserunner, giving the Jays’ offence a chance to climb back in it. It was the longest outing of scoreless relief in the post-season since World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner threw five innings out of the bullpen in last year’s Game 7 against the Royals. For Hendriks it was his longest relief outing in more than two years and the first time he had pitched that many innings in a game since Aug. 27, 2014 when he started a game for these same Royals. Gibbons said afterward he could not have used Hendriks any longer than he did. “It was borderline abuse, anyway, from what he’s used to.”\nJays on board\nRoyals’ starter Chris Young kept the Jays in check for most of the afternoon, but in the third inning Ryan Goins keyed a two-run rally capped by a ground-rule double by Josh Donaldson. It looked then like the Jays might be mounting a bit of a comeback. But Young settled in and retired the next seven batters in a row. “They did a really good job of arresting the momentum,” Dickey said afterward. “Chris got in a little bit of a jam there, we scored a couple runs and he pitched his way out of the jam, whereas in my first inning I had trouble arresting the damage. I put us in a hole.”\nRoyals’ rout\nAfter Hendriks was expended, Gibbons turned to LaTroy Hawkins, who has struggled mightily since the beginning of September, to keep the game within reach. It was a move that exposed the shallowness of the Jays’ bullpen without Brett Cecil. Aaron Loup, who missed two games in the ALDS due to a family matter, was called back home before the game, and Gibbons wanted to stay away from his high-leverage relievers. So he put his faith in Hawkins and when he failed, Ryan Tepera. By the time it was over, the Jays trailed by a dozen runs and Gibbons had reluctantly turned to setup man Mark Lowe as well as utility infielder Cliff Pennington, who became the first exclusively position player in baseball history to pitch in a post-season game. “It was getting so ugly,” Gibbons said. “You try to have a little pride anyway.”\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:02:51.894+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
