(Courtesy photo) Bill Wagner Contact Reporter bwagner@capgaznews.com \nCollege football royalty came to Annapolis on Wednesday when NBC television analyst Doug Flutie visited Navy football practice. \nFlutie spent the day at the Naval Academy while conducting background research for his role as color commentator for Saturday's game between Navy and Notre Dame in South Bend, Indiana. \nFlutie watched the noon meal formation then ate lunch with the Brigade of Midshipmen in King Hall. He spent considerable time on the top floor of Ricketts Hall, visiting with Navy players and coaches while also doing interviews. \n\"Just being on campus around these midshipmen is special,\" Flutie told The Capital while watching Navy football practice. \"Notre Dame is pretty special with their tradition, but nothing touches the tradition of the Naval Academy.\" \nFlutie was born in Manchester, Maryland grew up in the Waverly section of Baltimore City, in the shadow of old Memorial Stadium. \nFlutie was a 5-foot-9, 175-pound quarterback when he came out of Natick High in Massachusetts and was not recruited by a lot of major conference schools because of his size. Boston College was the only Division I-A school to offer Flutie a scholarship and he wound up becoming a three-year starter.

So they all have a little chip on their shoulder football-wise. They are disciplined guys who are overachievers and get the most out of their ability and I love that.\" \nAs a senior in 1984, Flutie captured the Heisman Trophy, the Maxwell Award and the Maxwell Award while being named a first team All-American. \nFlutie played against both Army and Navy while at Boston College. He recalled losing to Navy, 25-10, in Chestnut Hill in 1981 then winning the rematch in Annapolis, 31-0, in 1982. Defensive end isn't typical college athlete (Bill Wagner) \n\"We played Navy at our place in my very first start in 1981 and got beat. We came here the next year and won pretty easily,\" Flutie said. \"That year we played at Navy we just got off a bus at the stadium. Today was the first time I've ever been on the yard, which was pretty cool.\" \nFlutie returned to Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium for the graduation of close friend Bill Bray, who is now a high-ranking officer in the Navy. \nNavy quarterback Keenan Reynolds wasn't even born when Flutie won the Heisman Trophy in 1984, but he's seen the famous highlight of the Hail Mary pass to Gerard Phelan that produced a monumental upset of top-ranked Miami that year. \nReynolds did not hesitate when asked if he knew who Doug Flutie was: \"Of course. He was the first of the undersized quarterbacks,\" said Reynolds, who is generously listed at 5-foot-11, but appeared shorter than Flutie while posing side-by-side for a photo on Wednesday. \"I'm pretty sure the highlight of that touchdown pass was a Heisman Trophy commercial for a while. I remember when I first saw it when I was young.\" \nFlutie began his professional career with the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League then moved to the National Football League with the Chicago Bears in 1986 and the New England Patriots from 1987-89. \nFlutie then became one of the greatest quarterbacks to ever play in the Canadian Football League, setting a single-season recordd with 6,619 passing yards while with the Calgary Stampeders. \nIn eight years in the CFL, Flutie amassed 41,355 passing yards and 240 passing touchdowns. He was named CFL Most Outstanding Player a record six times and was named MVP of the Grey Cup all three times he led Calgary to the championship. \nFlutie returned to the NFL in 1998 and wound up playing until 2005 with stops in Buffalo, San Diego and New England. \nHead coach Ken Niumatalolo stopped practice so Flutie could speak to the team and Flutie stayed well afterward shaking hands, posing pictures and regaling both players and coaches with stories. \n\"You're talking about a guy that played at the highest level and was so successful in both college and pro. We asked (Flutie) if he had some words of wisdom to impart to our guys and the things he imparted were really good. I'm grateful that he took a couple minutes. He just talked about life stuff. It wasn't Xs and Os.\" \nFlutie threw passes to wide receiver Jamir Tillman while kicker Austin Grebe wanted to know about his drop kick technique. In 2005, his final season in the NFL, Flutie successfully converted a point after touchdown with a perfectly-executed drop kick - something that had not been done in an NFL regular season game since 1941.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:24:27.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
