That doesn’t mean the 2015 Cardinal players are not bent on winning Friday night. \n“We haven’t played that complete game yet. With the injuries we’ve had, we haven’t been at full strength, but we’re getting close this week,” Newton head coach Ed Ergenbright said. “Our goal as a team before the season is over to put together that one game where we’re doing everything as good as we can do it.” \nNewton has the opportunity to have two, not just one game, where it is doing everything well on the field. The Cardinals can match up a good offensive output and defensive performance in their final two games of the season. \nThe Cardinals go to Bondurant in a spoiler role. Bondurant-Farrar’s BlueJays are in a tie for the third-place playoff spot in Class 3A District 6 with Benton at 3-2. Friday is the final district game for the BlueJays while Benton is playing a non-district game. \nNewton (0-7, 0-4 district) has nothing to lose — so to speak — in going all out Friday and next week at home against Nevada, which is also winless in district play. Both are district games and both are games the Cardinals can win. \nAt one time there were 15 Cardinal players among the walking wounded this season. That included starters and solid backup players for the varsity. Good news for Newton is the return of players the past three weeks. \nJunior running back and defensive back Reese Rosenquist will see action in his third game after missing Newton’s first five games. Rosenquist suffered an injury before the season opener. Rosenquist is suppose to see more offensive action Friday than he has in the previous two games. \nLast week, Alex Miller, a junior lineman, and sophomore Ryan Constant, who plays defensive end and tight end, were back in the lineup. Ergenbright pointed to their return on defense in helping the Cardinals slow down the running attack of No. 1 Pella last week. \nSeniors Cole Peters and Jwan Roush return to the field this week. Peters and Roush were starting defensive backs to begin the season. Peters suffered a knee injury in the opening game at Knoxville and Roush, who was a big part of the running game offensively, went out with a foot injury in the second game. \nGetting Peters and Roush back in the defensive secondary this week is a good thing. The Cardinals face the top passing attack in District 6 Friday at Bondurant-Farrar. Dylon Story leads the district in passing — 79-of-125 for 1,295 yards, 11 touchdown passes — and Payton Duit is the top receiver with 46 catches for 680 yards and five touchdowns. \nShut them down, and be the spoilers Cardinals. \nFour area football teams are in the thick of playoff spot races in their districts. Colfax-Mingo has solidified a spot and Lynnville-Sully is battling for one of the final two spots out of Class A District 7. Prairie City-Monroe will advance out of Class 2A District 7 and Collins-Maxwell/Baxter is in the No. 4 spot in that district at this time. \nVolleyball is almost over. Newton has one more regular-season match Tuesday before moving into Class 4A playoffs at home against Grinnell Oct. 26. Lynnville-Sully opens 1A postseason play Tuesday, if it wins, it will join Colfax-Mingo in the second round on Oct. 27. CMB and PCM begin 3A playoff action Oct. 26. \nCross country teams from Newton, Lynnville-Sully, CMB, PCM and Colfax-Mingo compete in state qualifying meets Thursday. \nNCMP’s Aquagirls have the North Central Iowa Conference meet Oct. 24 in Grinnell to finish out the regular season. They head to regional diving and swimming Oct. 29 and Oct. 31 in Fort Dodge. \nHow about those Royals and Cubs? Let’s cheer these two teams on in the American League and National League Championship Series. We can have a Midwest World Series. \nContact Jocelyn Sheets at 641-792-3121 ext. 6535 or jsheets@newtondailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:28:09.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
