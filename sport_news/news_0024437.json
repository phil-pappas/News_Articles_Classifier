Barry said he would’ve been satisfied with Washington allowing 105 rushing yards in that game when factoring Atlanta’s pass attack, which features quarterback Matt Ryan and wide receivers Julio Jones, Leonard Hankerson and Roddy White. \nInstead, the Falcons had 176 rushing yards, averaging 5.5 yards per rush on 32 carries. \n“There was about 60 yards of rushing that was on us,” Barry said. “Everyone agreed. We knew we were going to have to give up a little bit in the run just to do the job that we had to do in the passing game. It was still, like I said, about 60 yards too much.” \n[ Five questions facing the Redskins against the Jets. ] \nBarry further added that Washington gave up 30 to 40 yards more than it hoped to Falcons running back Devonta Freeman, who finished with 153 rushing yards. \n“Our fits was off,” defensive end Jason Hatcher said. “We were all out of gaps, and I’ll take responsibility first and foremost and that’s in the D-line room. We were all over the place. We just got to go back to playing fundamentally sound football, being in our gaps where we’re supposed to be. If we do that, it’s hard to run on us.” \nThe Redskins hope they’ll be more difficult to run against Sunday against the New York Jets, who possess their own bruiser in Chris Ivory. Although he’s splitting carries with Bilal Powell, Ivory leads the team with 314 rushing yards. He averages five yards per carry and has three rushing touchdowns this season. \nNew York doesn’t typically attempt as many outside zone plays as Atlanta did against the Redskins, who struggled particularly on those runs in the Georgia Dome. The Jets’ ground game, ranked eighth in the NFL with 127.3 rushing yards per contest, likes to attack defenses up the middle with center Nick Mangold and guards James Carpenter and Willie Colon. \n“They’re going to challenge guys like me, [Chris] Baker and Hatcher on the inside,” nose tackle Terrance Knighton said. “Personally, I’m looking forward to the matchup. Everybody is talking about how hard [Ivory’s] running, and I’m looking for it.” \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:49:46.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
