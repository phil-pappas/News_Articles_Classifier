Jeff Zelevansky Oct 20, 2015 at 4:02p ET 0Shares \nRoss Kenseth , the 22-year-old son of Sprint Cup Series driver and 2003 Sprint Cup champion Matt Kenseth , will attempt to make his Camping World Truck Series debut Oct. 31 at Martinsville Speedway. \nThe second-generation driver will compete in the No. 18 Aisin-AW Toyota Tundra of Hattori Racing Enterprise. \nAlthough he's never entered a truck race, Kenseth made his XFINITY Series debut on Father's Day at Chicagoland Speedway, where he finished an impressive sixth in a Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota. \nKenseth and the Shigeaki Hattori-owned team tested on Tuesday at Martinsville, where the team will compete under the guidance of general manager and former Sprint Cup crew chief Pat Tryson. \n\"It feels great to get an opportunity to make my first Truck Series start,\" said Ross. \"Shige and I have tried to put something together for a long time, and finally all of the pieces fell into place. I'm thankful to him for this opportunity and am looking forward to working hard to make our debut a successful one in a couple of weeks.\" \nKenseth won his first ARCA Series race earlier this year at Michigan International Speedway in only his third career ARCA start. He followed that up with his solid NASCAR national series debut at Chicagoland. \n\"Ross has shown great promise in his young career, and it is good that we were able to put this opportunity together for him to race with us at Martinsville,\" Hattori said. \"I want to thank all of our partners, and especially Aisin-AW, for making this possible. We are a young team, and I know everyone involved will be motivated to do well.\" 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:05:41.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
