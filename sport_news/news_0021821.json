That was my first final and her first final, and she did really well,\" Capoferri said, mentioning her friendship and familiarity with Moore as members of the same country club. \nAfter Moore battled her way to a 4-3 lead in the first set, Capoferri found her groove, taking the lead when Moore's return volley came up short against the net. \nSuddenly Moore had trouble finding her serves, easing some of the stress on Capoferri. \n\"Usually when I started the game with 15-0 or 30-0 those were the games I had the most momentum in,\" Capoferri said, inching toward match point. \"It was nice that I was up 40-0 at the end so I could take some of the pressure off myself.\" \nAll the while Taylor's freshman sister Sarah Capoferri was playing the Flight Two final on an adjacent court, taking the first set from Hempfield's Sarah Klag before Klag rebounded to win Flight Two 4-6, 6-4, 10-5. \nBut Klag and Moore weren't finished with their day as they would soon meet up in the Flight One Doubles. \nMoore, a sophomore, partnered with senior Carolyn Mann as the Blue Streaks fought past Klag and freshman standout Amanda Hagino of Hempfield 7-5 (2), 6-3. \nThe Streaks' duo took a 3-0 lead in the opening set before Hagino's power serve opened up a Knights' comeback bid. \n\"We were fortunately able to break Hagino's serve in the first game, that was really big,\" Moore said. \"Then obviously she got her serve going next time but it was good to go up 3-0. We definitely needed it to get us going.\" \nOffsetting Hagino's serve were Mann's and Moore's affinity for working close to the net, many volleys settled with either a soft lob or a close-range rocket. \n\"It kind of throws them off when we step-in and volley, so we knew from the start that was something we had to do,\" Moore said. \nThe veteran Mann credited coach Doug Pennington for putting the tandem together at this point in the season. \n\"I think we're very opposite players the way we play, and I think that's why Coach P put us together,\" said Mann. \"That's why we work well together and of course we're going to keep working on it, keep getting better.\" \nThe duo will have a chance to do just that as districts begin on Thursday at the Hershey Racquet Club. \nCapoferri, Moore, Hagino, and McCaskey senior Sophie Rathmell will all advance to the District 3 AAA singles tournament. The Section One player of the year, Hagino bested Rathmell 6-2, 6-3 in the third-place game. \nAt-large bids remain for Township's Julia Darkey (5th place), a 6-3, 2-6, 6-4 winner over Cedar Crest's Greta Strunk, and Donegal's Anna Farmer (7th place), a 6-0, 6-1 winner over Cocalico's Shannon Glover. \nGaining a AA district berth is 3rd-place winner Pequea Valley's Lenea Riehl. Meanwhile, Lancaster Catholic's Isabel Midcap remains in the hunt after a 6-3, 6-4 5th-place victory over Lancaster Mennonite's Naomi Bronkema. \nOther winners on the day were Hempfield's Katie Donell and Livia Jackson in the Flight Three and Flight Four finals, respectively, the former defeating Margot Herzog of Donegal, 6-1, 6-3, and the latter Brianna Titi of Cocalico 6-1, 5-7, 10-8. \nCocalico's tandem of Titi and Lauren Good defeated Donegal's Herzog and Ally Wivell 8-3 in an 8-game pro-set for the Flight Two Doubles title. \n---", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:54:35.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
