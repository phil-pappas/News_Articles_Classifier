Signal photo by Katharine Lotze A A A \nThe Golden Valley Grizzlies exorcised a decade’s worth of Foothill demons Friday night on the same Canyon High School field that once saw the program’s lowest moment. \nWith one win, Friday night’s 35-6 victory over the Canyon Cowboys, the Grizzlies can now move on from a tormented past — a past that consists of 45 straight Foothill League losses entering Friday’s contest; a demoralizing 90-point defeat to Canyon in the Grizzlies’ first season in the league on the same very field that hosted Friday’s victory; Earl Johnson’s fumble against West Ranch in 2011 that might have cost them the win four seasons earlier, and last season’s heartbreaking overtime defeat to those same Wildcats. \nNow, finally, Golden Valley can close the history book and start typing away on its sequel. \n“It’s all behind us,” said Grizzlies running back Jesse Camacho. “We finally got our first win.” \nNo one had more to do with the Grizzlies’ historic night than Camacho, who gashed the Cowboys for a game-high 178 yards on 30 carries and three touchdowns. \nOne week after Golden Valley’s offensive line struggled mightily in a 37-0 loss to Valencia, the Grizzlies rebounded with an epic performance that saw holes opening left and right from the game’s start. \n“We didn’t do anything last week offensively. We went back to the drawing board and challenged the offensive line,” said Golden Valley head coach Dan Kelley. “It was the worst performance last week and arguably the best performance this week.” \nIn a game that was all but locked up entering the fourth quarter, the emotions of the moment seemed to get to both teams throughout the contest. \nThe teams combined for a total of nine 15-yard penalties, generally handed out of unsportsmanlike acts. \nThe Grizzlies totaled 115 penalty yards on 10 infractions, while Canyon finished at 92 yards on eight penalties. \nOne of those penalties nearly changed the course of the game, a roughing the kicker penalty that occurred after the Cowboys muffed the snap and just got the kick away. \nThe penalty extended Canyon’s only scoring drive of the contest, which ended with Canyon quarterback Miles Fallin finding Jake Gavin with a 25-yard pass with 34 seconds remaining in the half to set the halftime score at 14-6. \nWith Canyon set to receive the second half kickoff, momentum was shifting to the Cowboys’ side. \nBut the deflating moment didn’t seem to get to the Grizzlies. \n“It was great,” said Kelley of the halftime locker room atmosphere. “It was one of the best halftime adjustments we’ve had.” \nThat didn’t stop Canyon from returning the second-half kickoff to the Grizzlies’ 39 and advancing to the Golden Valley 25 three plays later looking to tie up the score. \nBut the defense stood tall, as Canyon turned the ball over on fourth-and-8 after Fallin hit Dylan Ramirez for a 5-yard gain. \nIt was the last time the Cowboys advanced deep into Grizzlies territory, as Golden Valley turned to Camacho and running back Justice Onu to bleed time off the clock. \nOnu finished with 39 yards on nine carries and a touchdown. \nWill Lahn caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from Golden Valley quarterback Victor Corona with 6:19 remaining to set the final score. \nWhile the Grizzlies game plan clearly called for a heavy dose of Camacho on Friday night, Corona did enough with his arm to keep the Canyon defense honest and extend drives. \nThe senior threw for 91 passing yards on 11-of-15 attempts, including the touchdown. \nCanyon, a school that shares a home field with the Grizzlies and is located just four miles from the Golden Valley campus, entered the game very aware of the streak Golden Valley carried along with it. \nCowboys players walked off the field immediately after shaking hands with Friday’s victors, some with shocked expressions clearly written on their faces. \nA program that once famously defeated the Grizzlies by 90 points in 2006 had just watched as their Canyon Country neighbors took home the program’s first Foothill League victory at their expense. \n“We’ve got to keep working. I don’t care about the streak,” said Canyon head coach Rich Gutierrez. “(Golden Valley) is a great team. That has no bearing on the kids and the way we coach.” \nAnd that is one thing both coaches agreed on. \nThe streak wasn’t of much importance to them. \nBut it was clear it was of paramount importance to the students of Golden Valley, both football players and fans alike. \nAs the clock hit zero and fans stormed the field, Grizzlies senior lineman Dalone Neal collapsed to his knees and kissed the field. Then he stood up, raised his fist in the air and yelled, “Let’s go.” \nNine years of pain, agony and near misses wiped away in a single night. \nNow the Grizzlies can move on from their past, and attempt to write a more promising future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:37:14.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
