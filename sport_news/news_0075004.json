On Feb. 9, the Devils will raise Martin Brodeur’s No. 30 to the rafters. Some day, they may hoist Lou Lamoriello’s suit and tie up there beside it.\nBut Friday night, fans will arrive at Prudential Center for the opener against Winnipeg with the scary thought that their greatest player and their greatest leader are running other teams -- and the even scarier thought that this year’s Devils are threatening to, of all things, shoot the puck.\nThis summer, while Brodeur was settling in as assistant GM of the St. Louis Blues and Lamoriello was taking over the Maple Leafs, the Devils were busy hatching their plan to break away from the defensive, trapping style that made them so successful, and hated.\nTo do it, they brought in former Penguins GM Ray Shero, who then reached into the Pittsburgh farm system for 40-year-old coach John Hynes, who promises the Devils will push the puck more in an effort to end their three-year no-playoff slump.\n“We’re not trying to abandon the defensive philosophy,” said Shero. “This has been a model franchise. There are standards here.”\nBut, he adds, “It obviously wasn’t working the way it was.”\nBrodeur grabbed nearly every goaltending record and Lamoriello famously outsmarted the Soviets to get star players as the pair took the Devils to three Stanley Cups and two more Cup Finals over the last 20 seasons. The Devils reached the playoff every year between 1997 and 2011, but the last few seasons, aside from the Cup run in 2012, have been rough.\nIt’s not as though the Devils turned from the ’61 Yankees to the ’62 Mets, but people start to notice how dull defensive hockey can be if the team isn’t winning.\nLamoriello moved upstairs, then out of town entirely as Shero, who has been around rebuilding NHL teams since he was a 9-year-old, stepped in.\nIn 2006, Shero took over as GM of the slumping former champion Penguins and led them to the Stanley Cup, but long before that, he had seen his father, Fred, mold the Flyers into 2-time Stanley Cup champs in the ’70s. He also watched as his dad took the Rangers to the Finals in 1979.\nOnce Shero got the Devils job, it didn’t take him long to settle on a coach.\n“There’s a certain direction and vision – where are you going to be in a few years,” he said. “We shared the same philosophy.”\nShero and Hynes take over a team without familiar names like Scott Gomez, Danius Zubrus and Bryce Salvador, who have left, and Patrick Elias, who is out indefinitely with a knee injury. Instead, they’ll count on returning forwards Michael Cammalleri, Travis Zajac and Adam Henrique, along with defenseman Andy Greene and goalie Cory Schneider, who has proven to be a worthy successor to Brodeur.\nBoth Shero and Hynes know the Devils are considered a long shot to make the playoffs, but they have a plan and they’re sticking to it.\n“If we get everything we could out of the team, that will be a success,” Hynes said.\n“We know where we’re picked by everybody,” Shero said. “We’re all aware of what’s being written. It’s up to us to write a different ending.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T08:37:22.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
