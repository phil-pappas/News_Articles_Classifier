If you are going to be in, there’s ways to protect it a little bit better.\n“Hold the guys, have the other guys come in a little bit. ... You’ve got to play to your strength, and your strength is your defense. And if it’s a Hail Mary and that’s all, it would have been.”\nHis co-host, Mark Packer, cut him off and asked about going for it on fourth down.\n>> Got a question about Ohio State football?

You have an ability to give (tailback) De’Veon Smith the ball, challenge your offensive line or play-action pass because Michigan State is going to be aggressive. You take some time off the clock, 4 or 5 seconds. A 60-yard field goal, (Michigan State’s Michael) Geiger before the game was 5 of 9, and it’s a 60-yard field goal.”\nO’Neill bobbled the snap, another issue Hoke said would have been avoided if they ran a fourth-down play.\n“A quarterback takes 1,000 to 2,000 snaps from center every single year,“ he said. “In practice, there may be 150 of them when (you) count the prepractice snaps and different things.”\nHoke said he can relate to a decision ruining a potentially huge victory.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from  Dispatch  Reader Rewards \n“I know it’s easy from where we sit right now,” he said. “I’ve been on the sidelines and had to make decisions. We went for two against Ohio (State) two years ago because Devin Gardner had a broken foot, didn’t think the defense was playing as well as we needed to play, so go for the win (in a 42-41 loss). Jimmy (Harbaugh), I’m sure, they went over what they would do, how they wanted to do it, communication all over the place. Personally, if we had the No. 1 defense in the nation, I’m going to test those guys.\n“You’ve got to have that confidence in your players to go make plays. With that defense, pressure on the quarterback, make him get the ball out. I’ve seen the (1994) Colorado-Michigan Hail Mary a thousand times, but your strength of your team is your defense. Guys up front, go pressure during the whole game, play to your strength, and that’s your defense.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:30:46.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
