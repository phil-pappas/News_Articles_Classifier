It's also the first time since 1992 an Ottawa team (which went 9-9) has won eight games. Ottawa hasn't had a 10-win season since 1978 (when it went 11-5) and with games against Toronto and two each against Hamilton and Winnipeg, it seems likely the RedBlacks will at least match that total. Also, Ottawa hasn't made the playoffs since 1994 and, barring a collapse, it seems like a done deal that they're in the post-season. In fact, the RedBlacks are challenging for top spot in the East Division, tied with Hamilton and one win up on Toronto -- with a game in hand on both teams. Finishing first and getting a bye and home-field advantage would be huge. There's not a lot of turnaround time before the RedBlacks hit the field again; they host the Toronto Argos Tuesday, with about 13,000 tickets still available.\nWith the team always coming first, Burris' teammates were still talking Friday about what their 40-year-old quarterback had done Thursday, setting a CFL regular-season record for single-game completions with 45, breaking a mark held by Montreal's Anthony Calvillo. At one point in the game, Burris had 17 straight completions.\n\"It's unbelievable, we're still talking about it,\" said receiver Maurice Price, who had nine catches for 104 yards. \"I don't think it's fully sunk in. Forty-five completions, that's a lot of completions. It's insane.\"\nRedBlacks coach Rick Campbell said he was given a heads up Burris was nearing the record just before the QB connected on a 13-yard pass to Patrick Lavoie.\n\"We weren't focusing on that, we were just playing the game,\" said Campbell. \"It usually works out better when you just play the game and let things happen the way they happen. It's a big deal for him. I'm not usually into stats and records, I'm more into the wins and all that stuff. But when you think about it, it's the 103rd Grey Cup this year so they've been playing this game for a long time. I'm happy for him, but I know he's even more happy about winning the football game.\"\n\"I got back to the sidelines and they said it was a record,\" said Lavoie. \"(Burris) played a helluva game. It was a helluva show.\"\nBurris had a strong supporting cast against an overmatched Als defence. Chris Williams caught nine passes for 98 yards and a touchdown. Brad Sinopoli had seven catches, while Ernest Jackson and Jeremiah Johnson each had six. Greg Ellingson caught five and Lavoie snagged four.\n\"We have playmakers, guys who can go out there and get the job done,\" said Williams. \"It was probably our most complete game on offence. It felt like we let one go last week, now we get (the Argos) again. Even though it's on short rest, if we get another performance like this we're heading in the right direction.\"\n\"We feel like we can move the ball every week. If we play like we're capable of playing, that's the type of performance we can put up every week,\" said Price. \"I don't know about the 504 yards, but as far as moving the ball, sustaining drives -- that's what we're capable of. Hats off to Montreal, they were on a short week -- they played across the country (in Saskatchewan) on Sunday, then had to play on Thursday. They were kind of at a disadvantage and we capitalized. We saw what we saw and we ran with it.\"\nWhile Burris was deflecting credit for his performance, offensive lineman Jon Gott said it was Burris at his best.\n\"Guys made some plays and the offensive line was blocking their butts off,\" said Burris. \"We have a big game Tuesday and if there's any time to have our offence this way, it's right now, in October.\"\n\"We don't deserve any credit,\" said Gott. \"(Burris) can give credit to everyone else, he's the one throwing the ball to the receivers. He makes the plays. The coaches had a great game plan. We went out there and made the right calls and it was simple from there. Last game, we didn't have our best game so we wanted to come out and give Hank time to throw and he broke a record.\"\nWhile we're handing out credit for the performance against the Als, the defence should take a bow. Until the fourth quarter when the game was well out of hand and Montreal's starting QB Rakeem Cato was on the bench, the RedBlacks defenders were superb.\n\"I'm still upset I gave up a late touchdown, I don't like giving up freebies,' said defensive back Brandyn Thompson, who had an interception and a key pass knockdown. \"If guys fly to the ball, it makes up for a lot of people's mistakes. If everyone is sprinting to the ball, good things happen. It sounds really simple, but we got that done (Thursday). As a team we went out there and played a really good game. This was one of those games where we really put it together on both sides of the ball. We have to use that momentum, move past this game, we have another huge game coming up against Toronto. It feels good to get a win at home, but we're focused on getting it done next week. We're going to have to do this and even more come Tuesday.\"\n\"Our guys were looking forward to playing this game,\" said Campbell. \"Coming off that loss to Toronto, you want to get out there and get back at it. We're going to be happy about this for probably about an hour or so and then get our minds on the next one because we're going to tee it up again here in five days.\"\nTwitter: @ TimCBaines\nOne play we liked:\nWow, tough to narrow it down. Brad Sinopoli, doing what he has done all season, caught a pass and bulled his way into the end zone from eight yards out to put the RedBlacks up 29-3. Great effort by Sinopoli.\nOne play we didn't like:\nWith 6.3 seconds left in the first half, second and goal from the Montreal nine-yard line, Henry Burris took a long time identifying an open receiver, too indecisive given the clock situation. There were 0.3 seconds left on the clock for a last play, a 16-yard Chris Milo field goal. But it seemed that might have been generous, it seemed like the second-last play took more than 6.3 seconds.\nWhat went right\nThe fact that it was 37-3 at the end of the third quarter speaks volumes. Burris was able to find secondary receivers on checkdowns and they were able to fight for first-down yardage. This wasn't the case for the Alouettes, whose checkdown receivers had little success against Ottawa's secondary and linebackers.\nWhat went wrong\nNot much. Tough to argue with what was a dominant effort. Giving up two late touchdowns wasn't ideal, but the RedBlacks should be ready to go Tuesday night against the Argos.\nOffensive grade\nA\nWhat's not to like about 510 yards of passing and 70 more rushing? The RedBlacks would have liked to establish more of a running game (Jeremiah Johnson rushed 12 times for 54 yards), but many of Henry Burris' passes were short and safe. In plenty of cases, the receivers, especially Brad Sinopoli, worked hard to gain extra yards after the catch.\nDefensive grade\nA\nThis was an A+ until the final 10 minutes of the game when Anthony Boone relieved Rakeem Cato as the Alouettes quarterback and engineered a couple of touchdown drives. Montreal had 222 yards passing, but more than half of that was in those final 10 minutes. It was an excellent defensive effort by Ottawa, which got sacks from Zack Evans, Moton Hopkins and Forrest Hightower and an interception by Brandyn Thompson.\nSpecial teams grade\nB-\nNot great, but we'll give it a good. No touchdowns surrendered. Chris Williams had five punt returns for 44 yards, while Stefan Logan had three for 57 for Montreal. The RedBlacks' kickoff teams were very solid, limiting Logan to 67 yards on five returns. Punter Brett Maher averaged 39.7 yards on three punts.\nThe Big Number\n3: Number of punts for RedBlacks kicker Brett Maher. That's how good the offence was, not much need for punting.\n8: Number of wins already for the RedBlacks this season, the most wins by an Ottawa team in the CFL since 1992 (nine seasons).\n9: Number of catches for No. 7, Maurice Price.\n45: Number of completions for QB Henry Burris, breaking a CFL single-game record.\n21,607: Attendance at Thursday's game. Not sold out? Hard to figure for a team that's been plenty exciting this season.\nThe Man\nHenry Burris. How could it be anybody else? The \"old\" man may be 40, but he didn't act his age Thursday night. He set a CFL record for pass completions (45) in a game (there were a couple of drops by his receivers as well), plus ran into the end zone for two more touchdowns.\nNext Up\nThe RedBlacks host the Toronto Argos Tuesday at TD Place. It was actually an Argos home game, but was moved to Ottawa because of the possibility the Toronto Blue Jays may have had a home game at Rogers Centre on that date. The RedBlacks are tied with the Hamilton Tiger-Cats for first place in the CFL East, with the Argos a game behind (both teams have a game in hand).\nCoaches Challenge\nStill scratching my head as to why Henry Burris, having already set his CFL record, was still in the game with 9:56 left and the RedBlacks in a third-and-one situation on their own 44. If the RedBlacks figured they needed to gamble, and I'm not sure they should have, wouldn't it have made sense to bring in backup QB Thomas DeMarco to run the play?\nPivotal Performance\nDamaso Munoz\nThe RedBlacks linebacker had seven tackles and a forced fumble. Always steady, he now has 52 tackles on the season, 14th in the CFL.\nBaines\nBurris and RedBlacks pushing for top spot in the East\nBy Tim Baines , Ottawa Sun First posted: Friday, October 02, 2015 07:54 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 02, 2015 09:12 PM EDT\nSo many things are going right for the Ottawa RedBlacks this season: Exhibit A is Henry Burris' record-setting performance in Thursday night's 39-17 thumping of the Montreal Alouettes.\nBut more than the individual performances, this is about a team that has bonded as brothers and has bought into the systems the coaches are selling.\n ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://twitter.com/TimCBaines", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-03T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:51:37.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
