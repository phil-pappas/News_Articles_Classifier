We’re going to have to play good volleyball for sure. \n\"Washington took a set from us in one game (during the regular season). Anybody that can do that to us is dangerous.\" \nThe Washington Wildcats, seeking to erase the memory of last season's five-game loss in the championship round, are sitting comfortably in the No. 2 spot. \nHome-court advantage helps too. \n“It’s always really, really exciting,\" said Kelly Comerford, Washington coach. \"You’re definitely more comfortable playing at home. \n\"Four of the last five years we've been in the finals ... I don’t think we’ve hosted district in the last 10 years, It’s my sixth year as head coach and we haven't done it since I've been here.\" \nThe action kicks off on Monday as Milton faces Pensacola High at 4:30, followed by Pace vs. Pine Forest at 6 and Escambia vs. Washington at 7:30. \nAggies, Raiders fight for postseason berth in 1-7A \nThe Tate volleyball program hasn't advanced to region play since 2012. \nIt is a drought the Aggies can snap with just one more win — Tuesday's District 1-7A semifinal against-host Navarre. \nWith a powerhouse set of five seniors (including captains Hope Tourney and Kristin Quina), the team has given opposing defenses fits this season. \nIf anything, history is on the Aggies side — the program defeated the Raiders in both regular-season meetings. \n“They’re pretty focused about it,\" Erika Burkett, Tate coach. \"They know that anybody can be beaten on any given day. \n\"Even though we’ve come out big against Navarre before, they know they’re going to have to come back out and do it again.\" \nThe winner of Tuesday's match has a date with top-seeded Niceville in Thursday's championship. \nCrusaders eye another District 1-4A title \nAfter advancing to the state final four last season (their first appearance in 18 years) the Catholic Crusaders are itching to return to Kissimmee and take care of unfinished business. \nFirst, the team will have to contend with its peers in District 1-4A, starting with host West Florida High in Tuesday's 6:30 p.m. semifinal. \nHistorically, the district has been Catholic's to lose — having won the title 18 of the last 19 years, \nPCA in underdog role in District 1-3A \nPensacola Christian Academy will have its hands full if it wants to advance further in the postseason. \nThe Eagles, seeded last in the district, take on Rocky Bayou Christian in Monday's quarterfinal at John Paul II. A win lands them in Tuesday's semifinal against top-seeded Maclay. \nRoyals ready to snap drought in 1-1A \nWin and they're in. \nAll the Jay Royals need to snap a years-long region appearance drought is a win against Central in Tuesday's District 1-1A semifinal. \nJay, seeded No. 2, has all the pieces it needs to get the job done — specifically a veteran core of six players that have been together since the 7th and 8th grades — provided it can top a Jaguars squad it split with during the regular season. \nOn the other half of the bracket, host Northview faces Laurel Hill at 5 p.m. in Monday's quarterfinal. \nTournament Schedules", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:19:32.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
