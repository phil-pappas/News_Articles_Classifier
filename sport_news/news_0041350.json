Head coach Todd Patmon did all he could to keep his team’s focus on the gridiron and a crucial game in District 26-5A.\n“I am proud of these kids and these coaches,” Patmon said. “It was a very trying week and we played well.”\nChris Dukes Backup quarterback Dane Barron eludes a McCallum defender as he leads the offense on a touchdown drive. Chris Dukes/ACN Newspapers A week after a frustrating loss to Reagan, it looked like the Bears might be in for more of the same early on. After a three-and-out, McCallum’s Luke Whitfield blocked a Bastrop punt. Three plays later the Knights were off to a 6-0 lead when Tyler Page hit Andre Blakemore for a 9-yard touchdown pass.\nBastrop would go three-and-out again, but Zaveon Veal made a highlight-reel play for the Bears on the next McCallum possession, catching a tipped pass off a Knight player’s back for an interception to give the ball back to Bastrop on the McCallum 48.\nOn a second-and-12 from the 50, Patmon decided to send a message to his players by lining up in the Bears’ jumbo set in what seemed to be a passing down. The team responded by plowing its way to a touchdown in just three plays when Adonis Davis scored from nine yards out to give Bastrop a 7-6 lead.\n“Our kids get excited about that set,” Patmon said. “Whenever we aren’t in rhythm, we like to jump into it. It’s been two weeks in a row we have jumped into it and scored, so it’s probably something we need to do a little bit more in the future.”\nAfter a McCallum field goal briefly gave the Knights the lead, Jovahn Jones scored a pair of second-quarter Bastrop drives with touchdown runs to give Bastrop a 21-6 advantage in the waning minutes of the first half.\nMcCallum would try to seize the momentum, electing to go for it on a fourth-and-1 from their own 48-yard line, but Bastrop’s Rene Loya led the defensive charge into the Knights’ backfield and made a stop behind the line to get the ball back to the Bears.\nQuarterback Ben Flores, who went down earlier in the game with what appeared to be a sprained ankle, returned for the next Bastrop drive to throw a 36 yard touchdown pass to Noe Salazar and give his team a commanding 28-6 lead.\n“It was a great play by Ben,” Patmon said. “It was a great play call. The toughest thing to do is hit a guy who is wide open, especially when you are injured.”\nFlores would not return after the pass, surrendering his spot to wide-receiver-turned quarterback Dane Barron.\n“We probably could have played him some more in the second half, but we didn’t feel like it was worth it,” Patmon said. “We wanted to get Dane some snaps and get him ready should we need him at quarterback in the future.”\nThe Bears would get some big plays from their special teams and defense to help put the game away in the third quarter. Barron – also the team’s punter – booted a 36 yard punt that bounced at the 1-yard line, there three Bastrop players were waiting to down it.\nTwo plays later the Bastrop defensive line caught McCallum running back Brion Edmonds behind the line of scrimmage for a safety, making it 30-9 Bastrop.\nAfter the free kick from the 20, Bastrop embarked on a 55-yard yard drive capped by a 5-yard touchdown run from Jaden Watson that made the score 37-9.\nJones finished the game with 112 yards and two scores. Flores was 2-for-4 for 32 yards and a touchdown and added 52 yards on nine carries.\nBastrop kicker Jose Sanchez booted a 36-yard field goal, making it back-to-back weeks with 35-plus yard kicks.\nMcCallum’s Page was 9-for-23 for 77 yards and two touchdowns. Edmonds led the Knights in rushing with 54 yards.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/17/a0/17/001.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:19:46.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
