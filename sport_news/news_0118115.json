(AP) â€” An attorney has disputed charges filed last month against a University of Kentucky law student who operated a drone that crashed inside Commonwealth Stadium before the Wildcats' season-opening football game against Louisiana-Lafayette.\nMultiple news outlets report that 24-year-old Peyton Wilson pleaded not guilty Tuesday to second-degree wanton endangerment.\nAttorney Luke Morgan says Wilson cooperated fully with the UK police investigation and is being punished for coming forward to officials. Morgan says there are currently no Federal Aviation Administration rules on drones.\nUK Police Chief Joe Monroe has said Wilson was operating the unmanned aircraft Sept. 5 outside the stadium when he crashed it into the suite level glass on the south side of the stadium. Several fans stood below, but no one was injured. The stadium was not damaged.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
