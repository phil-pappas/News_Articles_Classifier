Regardless, what he knew or didn’t know no longer matters, in either the eyes of the NCAA or the public.\nThis was his program and, like it or not, he’s responsible for everything associated with it. When someone Pitino hired is accused of paying teenage girls to strip and have sex with players Pitino thought enough of to want on his team, some of the blame has to fall on Pitino, too.\nIt seems Louisville President James Ramsey has already figured that out. In an Oct. 8 statement, he pledged to get to the bottom of the embarrassing allegations while praising athletic director Tom Jurich. Nowhere did he mention Pitino, his Hall of Fame coach.\nPitino has done great things for Louisville, reviving a once-proud program that was fading into irrelevance and leading it to the 2013 NCAA title. The Cardinals also went to the Final Four in 2005 and 2012, and have made the NCAA tournament in all but two of 14 seasons under Pitino.\nBut that matters less and less at a time when image is everything. Louisville is now a punch line, a school only Hugh Hefner could admit to loving, and that isn’t likely to play well with big-pocketed donors. They’ve already weathered one sex scandal involving Pitino, and that one now seems tame by comparison.\nThe larger concern is the punishments that are sure to come from the NCAA. If anything ever fit the description of “extra benefits,” a basketball staffer giving players and recruits money so they could have sex with strippers would surely be it.\nIt won’t just be Louisville being punished, either. As Larry Brown and Southern Methodist learned the hard way last month, ignorance is no longer an acceptable excuse. If something goes wrong on a coach’s watch, he or she has to pay the price, too.\nFor Pitino, that price ought to be his job.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;basketball_ncaa&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Li", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB4kwAp.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Impact", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB1tos2.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Rick", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyIp2.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Tom", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfAqDz.img&quot;}}", "http://feed.usatodaysmg.com/rss/msn/video/sports-usat-video&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfERjN.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmiLpJ.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkIUP&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Who", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfFfoq.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AA4BZeP&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Louisville&#39;s", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T21:18:45.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
