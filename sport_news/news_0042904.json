There’s so much tradition in that stadium. It may be old, but it’s one of the coolest places to play in the entire state.” \nMountain Home has fallen 83-41 at Jonesboro and 62-6 to North Little Rock in league play this season. \nCentral (1-4, 1-1) fell 51-27 at Jonesboro last week and picked up its lone victory of the season two weeks ago — 24-14 over Searcy. \n“With Central, we feel we’ll be able to rebound,” Joyce said. “They have a good defense. It’s probably the strength of their team. \n“That was as bad as we could play offensively,” he added of the North Little Rock game. “After the first quarter, we couldn’t get any kind of rhythm going. We’ve simplified it a little for them this week, so we can play a little faster and more aggressive. I feel good about this week.” \nAfter gaining 67 first-quarter yards, the Bombers could manage only 98 in total offense the rest of the game against the Charging Wildcats. \n“They had some monsters up front that were capable of getting off the ball and disrupting us,” Joyce said. “Their outside linebackers were real difficult to handle, so running between the tackles was tough, and when you have two studs on the outside, it makes running the ball anywhere very tough. It was a tough night for us.” \nThe young Bombers simply were overpowered against a Class 7A powerhouse. \n“The game started with their offense and their physicality up front, particularly their guards,” Joyce said. “It wasn’t a surprise, but they simplified their game plan where they said, ‘you know what? We’re bigger and stronger than you guys. We’re not going to do any of that funny stuff we’ve done the first few games. We’re just going to run right at you.’ They were ripping off runs of 6, 7, 10 yards a pop, and it just kind of cascaded from there.” \nCentral sports a more simple offensive look under sixth-year coach Scooter Register. \n“They get in the ‘I’ and run basic plays,” Joyce said of the Tigers. “Their offensive line isn’t as athletic as North Little Rock’s. North Little Rock’s right guard can probably outrun about half our team. He was fast. Central doesn’t have anyone who can pull like him, so they have to run straight ahead. We’ve shown we can stop that sort of run game. \n“They get in a Wildcat package, and that’s probably their most effective scheme,” Joyce explained. “They snap it to their best running back, and he goes wherever God takes him. There’s no rhyme or reason to it. They only want to throw it if they have to.” \nMountain Home will have to clean up mistakes on both sides of the ball. The Bombers had eclipsed the 300-yard mark on offense in every game going into last week’s setback against North Little Rock. \n“Watching the game film, it was evident North Little Rock did what they needed to do to win the game,” Joyce said, “but we helped them out in a lot of ways. Our guys were disappointed with some technique stuff we did that made it even easier for North Little Rock to get those big runs. I don’t think there will be any hangover from Jonesboro or North Little Rock. \n“If you look at it, we do match up well, but (the Tigers) have a good defense capable of stopping the run. So we’re going to have to execute.” \nThe Bombers have been interchanging running backs Cord Smith, Riley Peters and Isaac McKay after switching Drew Strope back to a receiver spot, where the senior made six catches last week. \n“Even in the middle of a series, if a kid looks like he needs a rest, we’ll rotate the next man up,” Joyce said. “It’s working out well. Cord’s more of a bruiser, where Riley is in between a bruiser and a speed guy, and Isaac’s more of a speed guy. It makes it interesting.” \nKickoff is slated for 7 p.m. \nBombers vs. Tigers \nWho : Mountain Home (1-4, 0-2) vs. Little Rock Central (1-4, 1-1) \nWhere : Quigley Stadium, Little Rock \nWhen : 7 p.m. Friday \nWhat to Know : Mountain Home has allowed 145 points over its past two games. The Bombers have surpassed 300 yards in total offense in four of their five games this season, the exception coming last week against North Little Rock. ... Little Rock Central , the all-time state leader in football championships with 32, has never lost to the Bombers in school history. The Tigers finished as runners-up in the 7A/6A-East last season. 4 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/sports/2015/10/08/historic-quest/73601650/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:06:58.913+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
