There is far more to Sunday than those six goals.\nFor a start, New York travels to Chicago. Yes, dumpster fire Chicago. The same Chicago that topped the Red Bulls 3-2 in August. New York have never won in Toyota Park, going 0-9-5 over the nine years since the Fire left Soldier Field. As Sporting Kansas City found out last week at San Jose, and Vancouver are eternally reminded in Texas, those streaks are incredibly difficult to ignore. Vancouver's players and coach obsessed over their record in Texas before Wednesday's game, and gifted Dallas a comfortable win in the process. It is, by no means, an automatic New York win.\nNow for the bad news. San Jose isn't a walk in the park either. The Quakes are 10-11-6 when traveling to face Dallas. Dom Kinnear's team are also unbeaten in three games. San Jose is 5-9-2 on the road in 2015, where Dallas' home record stands at an impressive 12-2-2. The best number of all, Dallas going 12-3-3 when David Texeira plays at least 45 minutes! The only gripe about the semi-synchronized schedule is that the Shield will be settled either just before the game kicks off in Frisco, or two hours after the final whistle in Bridgeview. Just play both conferences together or make Decision Day a full day of MLS soccer.\nAway from Toyota Stadium, LA's surprising home defeat to Portland has the potential to blow the playoff seedings wide open. Here is how things stand right now:\nSporting KC host Colorado on Wednesday, so add three points anyway. The final day sees Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland all at home, against Houston, Real Salt Lake, and Colorado. The intriguing game is in Kansas City, where SKC host LA. The Galaxy are well versed in an end-of-season meltdown, after throwing the Supporters' Shield away last year in Seattle. LA is 2-8-6 away from the StubHub Center, and SKC are 9-1-5 at Sporting Park. If Sporting beat Colorado and LA, and Vancouver, Seattle, and Portland all pick up wins (which they should), this is how the table could end up:\nRemember last month when Bruce Arena and Robbie Keane mocked FC Dallas' games in hand? Arena felt that Dallas had to worry about getting to 50 points rather than challenging the Galaxy, and Keane showed little belief that the Texans could win those games in hand.\nGloating aside, FC Dallas would probably face LA in the Western Conference Semifinals, if the final weekend did play out this way. Dallas will be paired with the lowest seed of two knockout round winners, playing the first leg, away, on Sun, Nov. 1, and the return leg a week later. Here are the fixtures for Decision Day, with the teams' home or away records, and head-to-head in the host city.
