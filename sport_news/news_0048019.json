The memoir details his take on the crisis in which the government took over mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and provided hundreds of billions in aid to the biggest U.S. financial institutions.\nThe Associated Press obtained an early copy of the book last week. He writes that the taxpayer-provided bailouts of banks and Wall Street firms were hugely unpopular, but says they were necessary to avoid an economic catastrophe.\n\"I certainly was not eager to bail out Wall Street and I had no reason to want to bailout Wall Street itself,\" he told USA Today. \"But we did it because we knew that if the financial system collapsed, the economy would immediately follow.\"\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:53:44.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
