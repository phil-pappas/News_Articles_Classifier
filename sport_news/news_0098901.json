Three games will be played in a five-day stretch, starting tonight when the Brooklyn Nets visit the TD Garden (7:35, TV: Comcast SportsNet; radio: WBZ-FM/98.5. The Celtics will also be on the parquet floor on Thursday night to go against the New York Knicks before making a bus trip to Manchester, N.H., for a Friday night game with the Philadelphia 76ers. Coach Brad Stevens said that he will rest some regulars at various points this week while also taking looks at a variety of combinations. “I’ve got a pretty idea about what we need to do, where we need to go, what we need to see,’’ said Stevens before practice on Sunday afternoon. “I feel good about where a lot of our guys are at as far as conditioning level and even experience level through the first four games. “We’ll still sit some guys this week. They’ll play enough and that’s that.’’ Guards Marcus Smart and Terry Rozier should get plenty of playing time this week after sitting out games against the Nets and Knicks last week. Smart had a strep throat while Rozier was sidelined with a knee ailment. Both returned to practice over the weekend. “I think it’s really important that guys like Terry, who sat out all last week, guys like Marcus, who sat all last week, play a lot just to get themselves going again,’’ said Stevens. Rozier is ready to get a lot of work in after being forced out following the two-game trip to Europe. “I feel real good,’’ said Rozier. “It’s great to be back out there. I’m just coming back, so I want to be cautious, but I feel good, so I’m just ready to get out there for a full practice with the older guys. I’m just ready to get back to it.’’ Popular name: Stevens, a native of Indiana now living in Patriots’ country, was an interested observer of the Colts’ game with New England on Sunday night. Ironically, Stevens’ son is named Brady, but it has nothing to do with quarterback Tom Brady. “What a wild twist,’’ said Stevens. “When my Brady first went to day care (in Indiana), there were Peytons in his class (named for former Colts quarterback Peyton Manning). “We had named him (Brady) because we liked the name from a kid that I was actually recruiting. I didn’t even think about it. Now he fits right in. As I’ve said many times, we’ve got kids on our street, dogs on our street, we’ve got a lot of Bradys.’’ Page 2 of 2 - Around the rim: Stevens has another week before he has to trim the roster to 15 players. The Celtics have 16 players with guaranteed contracts. Perry Jones, acquired from the Oklahoma City Thunder, could be the one to be released. ... David Lee missed Sunday’s practice with an illness. ... Amir Johnson on whether he would prefer to start over being a reserve: “I’ve been on both sides in my career. It really doesn’t matter.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:24:39.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
