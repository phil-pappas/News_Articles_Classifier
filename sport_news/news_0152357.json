The National Survey of Family Growth interviews 10,000 males and females ages 15 to 44.\nAmerican males lose their virginity at an average age of 16.9, according to the research, compared with age 17.2 for females. The United Kingdom averages a younger age for males — 16.5, while males in Switzerland and Norway lose their virginity at an average age of 18.5. In France, Italy and Switzerland, according to the study, females lose their virginity at an average age of 18.5. Females in the U.K. lose their virginity at 17.5, on average.\nBirds, bees and beers: Sex Ed 101 arrives at Northwestern Heidi Stevens Experts recommend introducing sex ed by age 10 , but by the time those 10-year-olds become college students, the lessons have often been shoved to the back of the brain — along with triangle equations, facts about the Franco-Prussian War and other details muddied by the march of time.\nTeresa Woodruff,...\nExperts recommend introducing sex ed by age 10 , but by the time those 10-year-olds become college students, the lessons have often been shoved to the back of the brain — along with triangle equations, facts about the Franco-Prussian War and other details muddied by the march of time.\nTeresa Woodruff,...\n(Heidi Stevens) The vast majority of respondents said the first time they had sexual intercourse was voluntary. The 93.4 percent of females who called the experience voluntary were an average 17.2 years old when they lost their virginity. For the 6.6 percent who said their first time was involuntary, 16.2 was their average age at the time of the experience.\n\"Involuntary includes use of force or any sort of overt coercion,\" according to the National Survey of Family Growth questionnaire.\nThe 92.6 percent of males who said losing their virginity was voluntary were an average 16.9 years old when it happened. The 7.4 percent who said it was involuntary were an average 16.3 years old when they lost their virginity.\nWhether parents or guardians talk about sex with their children doesn't correlate significantly with the age of first sexual experience, the researchers write. Nor does whether they coach kids on how to say no. The average age hovers around 16 either way.\nRespondents who said their parents or guardians talked about sex were an average age of 16 when they lost their virginity. Respondents who said their parents or guardians never talked about sex were 16.2 years old.\nTeens having far less sex than they used to, CDC reports Heidi Stevens A possible upside to teens being eternally tethered to their devices?

They're having a lot less sex than they used to.\nA new Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report says from 2011 to 2013, 44 percent of females ages 15 to 19 and 47 percent of males ages 15 to 19 had experienced sexual...\n(Heidi Stevens) Respondents whose parents or guardians talked about how to say no to sex were an average 16.2 years old when they lost their virginity, and respondents whose parents or guardians never talked about how to say no were an average 15.9 years old.\nI would argue the how-to-say-no conversation is still a critical one for parents and guardians to initiate. The goal isn't simply to forestall when kids lose their virginity, but to provide them with the language and logic they need to ensure they're doing it in a safe, kind, mutually respectful relationship.\nThat means the how-to-hear-no conversation is equally critical.\nAll conversations, of course, should be begin with \"No protection means no sex. Period.\"\nhstevens@tribpub.com\nTwitter @heidistevens13\n Family", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-55b121d5/turbine/ct-teen-sex-report-cdc-balancing-20150723", "http://www.educationworld.com/a_news/study-suggests-sex-education-classes-should-start-age-10", "http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/databriefs/db209.htm", "http://onlinedoctor.superdrug.com/american-virgin/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ab6d9/turbine/ct-sex-ed-college-students-northwestern-balancing-0929-20150929", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561698c3/turbine/ct-american-virgin-sex-trend-study-balancing-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-08T19:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:04:07.792+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
