According to Knesset statistics, in 2013 there were 157,000 legal weapons in private hands in Israel, with 43,000 additional ones in the hands of security guards and another 130,000 rifles and pistols held by different organizations. These numbers do not include military firearms, or guns used by police or prison services. In addition, there were 7,000 unlicensed guns in 2012.\nHowever, the Knesset Interior Committee demanded that the police prohibit security guards from bringing their weapons home, citing figures showing that at least 30 people were murdered over the last decade by weapons belonging to off–duty security guards.\nMK Tzipi Livni (Zionist Camp) said during a tour of the Old City in Jerusalem that “transferring responsibility to the citizens of Israel and calls for carrying weapons indicate a loss of control by the government and will lead to total anarchy.”\nBarkat responded to footage shown on Israel Channel 1 TV news in which a man was seen carrying an unlicensed sub-machine gun through Jerusalem streets. He said the man’s weapon was a licensed “Glock” revolver which serves for self–defense, attached to a satchel. Jerusalem Municipality officials said that “the municipality doesn’t require additional permits for such pistols, which are used routinely in protecting the light rail system and other locations, given their great accuracy.”\nThey added that “Barkat was carrying such a gun when he visited the [Arab] neighborhood of Beit Hanina looking, together with Jerusalem police, at ways of restoring security to the light rail line in that area of the city. The mayor encourages carrying licensed arms in order to increase security and sets a personal example by doing so.”\nJerusalem’s light rail stations have been the site of several terrorist attacks, with the latest one occuring on Thursday noon when a Palestinian youth stabbed a Jewish man at a station near National Police headquarters.\nNir Hasson\nHaaretz Correspondent\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/nirhasson", "https://www.facebook.com/nir.hasson.9?fref=ts", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-08T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:26:48.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
