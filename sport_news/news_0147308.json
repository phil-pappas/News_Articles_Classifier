The film features Akshay Kumar, Amy Jackson, Lara Dutta and Kay Kay Menon in the lead roles. Interesting film\nIt is a typical Prabhu Deva film with all the entertainment and masala that a comedy drama must have. I really like Akshay Kumar and it is quite an interesting film. Jagmeet Bhullar, student\nComic vein\nI like the first half of the film, but the second half is not quite interesting. The comedy in the film is really good and Akshay Kumar has acted really well too. It’s a paisa wasool film. Kanwar Singh, student\nOne-time watch\nIt is an interesting one-time watch and if you like to laugh out loud, well, then this movie is your pick. However, if you like the idea of watching a meaningful film, then this is your pick. Harnaam Singh, businessman\nFilm: Reality bite\nFilm: Talvar\nTalvar is a murder mystery film directed by Meghna Gulzar. The film is based on the 2008 Noida double-murder case, in which a teenage girl and her family servant were murdered and her parents were convicted for the murders. The film stars Irrfan Khan, Konkona Sen Sharma, Neeraj Kabi and Sohum Shah in the leading roles and Tabu in a guest appearance. The film is produced by Junglee Pictures, the films division of The Times of India Group. Originally Nyodda, the film’s title was changed to Talvar in February. The film’s premiere was at the 2015 Toronto International Film Festival in September. Like the 1950 Japanese film Rashomon, Talvar presents three contradictory accounts of the case, which variously portray the parents as guilty or innocent. Likeable affair\nWhat I really like about the film is that it takes a lot from reality and is very interesting. However, I like the book, Aarushi by Avirook Sen more than I like the film. It is more insightful and interesting. Harneeta Kaur, businessman\nBold take\nIt is a bold film and has been made in a rather interesting way. I was glued to my seat till the end. Lakshay Sharma, student\nSubtle portrayal\nThe best part about the film is that it represents the story not in a dramatic manner, but very subtly. The actors are brilliant, especially Irrfan Khan and Konkana Sen.
