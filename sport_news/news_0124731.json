Lunt is averaging 214 passing yards with a high of 316 against Western Illinois.\nGetting defensive: The Illini must contain former Montini WR Jordan Westerkamp, who leads the Big Ten with 26 catches and has 351 yards (13.5 per catch). He had a career-high 11 receptions for 118 yards last week against Southern Miss.\nThe number: 3. Blocked kicks by Illinois — two punts, both returned for TDs, and one field goal — which is tied for the FBS lead.\nThe talk: Can the Illini start the Big Ten season on the right foot (for once)?\nShannon Ryan's pick: Illinois will keep it tight for a while, but the Illini will struggle to stop Nebraska's passing game.
