It appears the Dallas Cowboys have an interesting fascination with Tom Brady and Gisele Bundchen’s relationship.\nAdChoices Cowboys defensive end Greg Hardy is coming back from a four-game suspension this weekend and gets to face the New England Patriots. He had some interesting things to say about their quarterback and his wife before the matchup.\n“I love seeing Tom Brady, he’s cool as crap,” Hardy said. “Have you seen his wife? I hope she comes to the game. I hope her sister comes to the game, all her friends come to the game. One of my favorite games of the year, guys.”\nWhen asked for his reaction to Hardy’s statement, Cowboys owner Jerry Jones had an interesting response of his own.\n“When I saw him marry her (Gisele Bundchen), Tom went up in my eyes 100 percent,” Jones told SI.com’s Melissa Jacobs . “She’s very, very attractive and it shows what an outstanding individual Tom is.”\nWell that’s awkward.\nBrady, meanwhile, stayed above the fray when asked if Hardy’s comments upset him. However, the Cowboys appear to be taking a different approach.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/10/07/dallas-cowboys-jerry-jones-greg-hardy-tom-brady", "http://nesn.com/?p=525568", "http://nesn.com/?p=525657", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:46:33.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
