He mostly assisted with reptiles and small mammals, but he was so willing to help out, he ended up taking on tasks in other areas of the park, too.\n\"He was a super kind-hearted kid,\" she said.\nMegan Dilson, the faculty advisor for the Roseburg chapter of the FFA , a group that promotes leadership and agricultural skills, said, \"Lucas was one of the best students our FFA Chapter had.\"\nLucas Eibel, 18 Eibel family \"I am so devastated by his loss,\" she wrote in a brief email.\nEibel was studying chemistry at Umpqua Community College and had recently received two scholarships, the family said. He graduated Roseburg High School with \"high academic marks,\" they said.\nEibel was one of five siblings, four of whom were fraternal quadruplets, according to friends and a report from The News-Review , a local newspaper covering Roseburg and Douglas County.\nPeople didn't always guess the four were related, but the siblings were close enough to earn nicknames as a group -- The Quad and Fibel, The News-Review reported.\n\"It's always funny to see people's reactions,\" Eibel told the newspaper, when people discover the family bond.\nThe family moved from Salem to Roseburg in 2008.\nEibel was a soccer player, the one member of the family who did not play tennis, said Jeremy Root, a former coach at the Umpqua Valley Tennis Center who has known the family since their move.\nHe could often be found at Roseburg's one tennis club, Root said, teasing and being teased by one or the other of his siblings.\n\"They would fight and argue, but you could tell that there was this love the whole time,\" Root said of the siblings' dynamic. \"You could tell that their family came before anyone else.\"\nOne parent or the other attended every tennis and soccer match, he said.\nRoot remembers Eibel as perhaps the quietest sibling, but unequivocally nice and described that way by his siblings.\nThat matches the impression of Taylor Moore, a freshman at Southern Oregon University who took a precalculus class with Eibel at Roseburg High School last year.\n\"He was really quiet at first,\" she said, \"but when he opened up, he was very, very funny and very, very smart.\"\nThe family asks that donations in Eibel's memory be made to the Roseburg FFA chapter or to other victims of the shooting.\n-- Carli Brosseau and Emily E.
