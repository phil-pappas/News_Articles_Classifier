Chris Paul ejected from pre-season game for telling ref to not talk to him like he's a kid Comment By Kyle Newport, Bleacher Report Ridgecrest Daily Independent - Ridgecrest, CA By Kyle Newport, Bleacher Report Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 8:34 AM By Kyle Newport, Bleacher Report Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 8:34 AM Preseason or not, Los Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul isn't going to take what he perceives as disrespect from a referee. Early in the third quarter of Tuesday night's preseason game against the Golden State Warriors, Paul was ejected for picking up his second technical foul. The reason for his second technical was a bit unusual. In the video, it appears as though Paul said, \"I got two kids of my own; don't talk to me like I'm a little kid.\" And that was the end of the night for the Clippers point guard. This isn't the first time Paul has gotten upset about being treated like a kid on the court. A few years ago, Paul got mad at then-Los Angeles Lakers forward Pau Gasol for \"sonnin'\" him, which means putting your hand on someone's head like you would a child's. In case it wasn't clear then, it certainly is nowâ€”Paul doesn't appreciate being treated like a kid.
