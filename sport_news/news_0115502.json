Saturday's quarterfinal tilt had little chance to finish as one-sided as the teams' first meeting. \n\"We got a great result down there on the road, 3-0, but we knew it wasn't going to be anything like that,\" MMU coach Eric Barker said.

(Photo: AUSTIN DANFORTH/FREE PRESS) \nThe Raiders' two losses? A chance for payback awaits in Tuesday's semifinal against top-seeded Burr and Burton (16-0). \n\"It's really exciting for us. Last year we were pretty bummed, we didn't want to play in that game,\" Woodard said of her team's 11-0 playdown loss to eventual state champion Champlain Valley. \"But now we're all excited to play, all want to keep practicing and playing with each other.\" \nAnd Rutland gets to do just that after the moment of brilliance the junior forward displayed late in the second half. \nCollecting Jordan DelBianco's ball in the left side of the 18-yard box, Woodard sized up her options with a defender on her back and two others behind her. \nWoodard spun away from the first and then dragged the ball backwards, away from the second, with the bottom of her right foot. A touch with her left foot split the last two defenders with enough room to rifle a near-post shot past MMU goalie Emma Parent (seven saves). \n\"It was probably the best sole-reverse I've ever seen in the girls game,\" Barker said. \nLike that, the Raiders had the only goal they needed. \n\"You give Brooke a ball at her feet, you're inside the box, she'll do what she can to get that ball in the back of the net,\" McClallen said. \"One girl, two girls, it doesn't matter. She'll find a way to get it in there.\" \nWoodard's presence alone — the footwork in tight spaces, the ability to turn a clearance into a counter with a weaving, 40-yard run — had the Cougars (10-6) wary from the start. \n\"We had to play the game with an eye on Brooke — and that's really it,\" Barker said. \"When you have to look at the other team to make sure you're taking care of that, it kind of takes you a little bit out of your steps, what you want to accomplish out there.\" \nBarker and the Cougars switched the player tasked with marking Woodard at halftime, opting for a defender rather than a midfielder, and the contest opened up almost immediately.
