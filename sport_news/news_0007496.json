Best to ignore it for now then look up in February to see if your club is in the final; that’s what most Premier League managers will do.\nMajor League Soccer The M.L.S. playoffs begin Wednesday and Thursday. The top two teams in each conference earned byes and will not play until the weekend, but the one-game first-rounders offer some enticing matchups: The Los Angeles Galaxy managed to lose their way into a date with Seattle on Wednesday (10 p.m., Eastern time, Unimas), while Didier Drogba-led Montreal won its way into a home game against Canadian rival Toronto F.C. on Thursday (7 p.m., Unimas). The Red Bulls, who won the Supporters’ Shield as regular-season champion, will open on the road Sunday: opponent, time and even TV network to be determined.\nAround Europe’s Leagues Chelsea hosts Liverpool bright and early Saturday (8:45 a.m., NBCSN). On beIN Sports, Real Madrid (11 a.m.) and Barcelona (3:30 p.m.) face Liga stragglers as they circle each other in advance of the season’s first Clásico on Nov. 21, so tune in for the meat in that Spanish sandwich: the Turin Derby between Juventus and Torino at 1 p.m.\nWant something even more intense?
