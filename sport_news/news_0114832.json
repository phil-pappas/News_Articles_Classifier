Samford has won 11 straight vs. WCU. WCU QB Troy Mitchell needs 107 passing yards to pass Mike Pusey (6,160 yards) as the school's career leader.

The Mocs have beaten WCU for six straight seasons. \n\"The parity in this league is so close,\" WCU coach Mark Speir said, noting that his two league wins have been by a total of 10 points. \nThe Cats are alone in third place in the eight-team league. \n\"Every week, you are just trying to find a way to win by one point, just scratching and clawing. All we are worried about is trying to find a way to beat Samford by one.\" \nThe Bulldogs have been winning by much more than that in the 11 straight wins that date to 1991, with an average margin of victory of more than 15 points against the Cats. \nBut coach Chris Hatcher's team, predicted to finish as high as second in some preseason polls, has struggled in SoCon home losses to Chattanooga (31-21) and The Citadel (44-25). \nThe defense ranks seventh in the league, allowing an average of 440 yards per game. \n\"We have to play harder, with more emotion and excitement,\" Hatcher said. \"Cullowhee is a tough place to play, and they are a very athletic team that plays hard.\" \nSamford is the top passing team in the league (322 yards per game), going up against a WCU defense that is No. 1 against the pass (169 ypg allowed). \nQuarterback Michael Eubank (1,432 yards passing, 10 touchdowns) and receiver Karel Hamilton (SoCon best 45 catches for 559 yards, two scores) have been the league's most effective combination. \n\"Samford has had our number for a while, and it's going to be a big challenge for us to get a win,\" Speir said. \nIn a three-game winning streak that includes back-to-back SoCon wins, the Catamounts have had to stage two fourth-quarter comebacks and then hold off a late charge by Wofford last week for a 24-17 win, and Speir likes the way his team is handling the pressure of games tight in the fourth quarter. \n\"We keep finding a way to get it done,\" he said. \"And we're excited about that.\" 2 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1LJ4VhC TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:15:50.080+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
