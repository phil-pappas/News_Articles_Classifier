This is where you compete with the best. All the top guys in RS:X are here, trying to make the most of every opportunity available to prepare for Rio. My goal is to go out there and get on top of my game.” \nThe 26 year old had claimed the title at the London Games in commanding fashion, winning seven of the ten races among a field of 38 windsurfers. \nHowever, he was out of action for the first three months of this year due to an injury. “I broke my wrist in a bike crash that had put me out of action for too long,” the California-based windsurfer said. \n“It's been a gradual comeback for me. Right now, I am physically fit and at my best and I want to test myself in this world championship.” \nHe pointed out that the field for the Rio Games is expected to be much tougher than what it was for London. “Competitive levels have changed in recent years,” Rijsselberghe said. \n“Earlier, we used to have five windsurfers vying at the top. But now, there are as many as ten windsurfers fighting for the top honours. The fight at the top has become more intense and it is going to very tough to defend the Olympic title.” \n“All the top ten guys are here. Also, the meet serves as a qualification round for Rio and the competition is going to be top-class. It is very important for me to do well here,” he said. \nRijsselberghe said that China's rising star Wang Aichen and Spain's Ivan Pastor are his biggest competitors. “These are two rivals I am following closely - Aichen, in particular. He won a test event in Rio in August. So, he's up there. But of course, I have to watch out for everyone in the top ten,” he said. Both Aichen and Pastor are also competing in the Musannah event. \nRijsselberghe, who won a bronze in the 2009 RS:X worlds in Weymouth and then a gold in the 2011 worlds in Perth, Australia, hopes for good wind conditions in Musannah to suit his style. \n“I have experienced lighter winds during my training sessions here,” the six-foot-three surfer said. “If they are light during the races, it could be tricky for me since I am one of the heavier guys. But if the winds become extremely light, then it will come down to muscle power and it may work in my favour.” \nThe Dutchman said that the 2012 gold is a constant motivator for him to excel. Ahead of his defence in Rio, Rijsselberghe is expected to compete in a couple of other preparatory meets, including an event in Miami, US early next year. \nThe inaugural worlds were held at Lake Garda, Italy, in 2006, while subsequent worlds have been held in Cascais, Portugal; Auckland, New Zealand; Kerteminde, Denmark; Weymouth, UK; Perth, Australia; Cadiz, Spain; Buzios, Brazil; and Santander, Spain.
