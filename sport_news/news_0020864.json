KING — State Journal \nJunior Dare Ogunbowale is UW’s leading rusher through six games with 426 yards on 77 carries. He had 193 yards on 34 carries last season. \nDare Ogunbowale doesn’t often notice the plaque hanging in the University of Wisconsin running back room, intended to show respect for the football program’s long list of players who have rushed for 1,000 yards in a season. \nHe’s certainly aware of its presence. The Badgers have added at least one name to it every year since long before he arrived in Madison. The list reads, “Melvin Gordon … James White … Montee Ball … John Clay … P.J. Hill … Brian Calhoun” before skipping a season, and every name but Calhoun’s appears multiple times. \nOgunbowale, UW’s leading rusher this year, is on pace to fall short of that benchmark — which would be a first for the school since 2004. \n“We don’t think about the numbers,” he said. “We always talk about the tradition of running backs here … but it’s not anything that we look at every day. \n“We just want to help the team out.” \nOgunbowale did just that last week against Nebraska, rushing for 83 yards in the fourth quarter of a come-from-behind victory, and UW hopes for similar results today at Camp Randall Stadium against a Purdue team that ranks 110th nationally at defending the run. \nThat hope hasn’t always existed this season, as injuries mounted and young offensive linemen worked through growing pains. \nOgunbowale’s fourth-quarter burst was perhaps the first time the Badgers’ rushing attack resembled those of recent seasons. \nHis 32-yard carry with 8:32 remaining was UW’s third run of 30-plus yards after leading the country with 33 such plays last year with Gordon and Corey Clement in the backfield. \nThe Badgers had their worst rushing performance since 2012 against Alabama to open the season and managed just 86 yards on 34 carries in a loss to Iowa on Oct. 3. \nClement’s absence could be the main source of the early-season struggles. \nThe junior, who nearly added his name to the plaque last season with 949 yards on just 147 carries, was poised to become the school’s next star back after Gordon left early for the NFL. \nClement suffered what he thought was a groin injury Sept. 1 and attempted to play against the Crimson Tide four days later. He made the injury worse and tried to rehab it until UW found he actually suffered a sports hernia, which required surgery. \nHe hasn’t been ruled out for today’s game but continues to deal with soreness after practicing. \n“I think it’s a group that had high aspirations when the season started,” UW running backs coach John Settle said. “Corey having an opportunity to be the guy finally, then we had Dare and Taiwan (Deal) battling to be No. 2. \n“I like the work ethic. I like the way they’ve shown up every day. I like the way they’ve prepared. Haven’t had the big plays that everybody’s waiting on, but I like the way they approach things, and I think those plays will come with the guys as they get more reps and get more comfortable with what we’re doing.” \nDeal’s left ankle injury in the first quarter against Nebraska last week left UW with Ogunbowale and Alec Ingold as its only running backs in a must-win game on the road. \nOgunbowale’s a former walk-on cornerback who switched positions in the middle of last season. Ingold, a true freshman, played linebacker until three weeks ago. \nBut in the fourth quarter, those two ran successfully behind an offensive line that had inserted its fourth starting lineup in six games, Joel Stave stepped up to lead a winning drive and the Badgers stayed alive for a chance to repeat as Big Ten West Division champions. \n“We just kept pounding,” Ogunbowale said. “We kept working at it, and eventually it started to open up. We felt like we were starting to get an edge on them, and that’s when we made sure we exposed them.” \nThe improvement of the offensive line played a major part in the turnaround. \nWhile the Badgers have a reputation for excelling at that position, this year’s unit has hampered the running backs’ ability to create explosive plays. \nFive players — including three redshirt freshmen — have started a game at right guard or right tackle this season, whether the changes have come due to injury or performance. \nThe return of right tackle Beau Benzschawel, who suffered a knee injury in fall camp, appears to have helped solidify that side of the line. He and right guard Walker Williams played together for all but one series against Nebraska. \n“I think for the most part, the offensive line has done a great job sticking together,” Stave said. “Injures are a part of the game, and I think for the most part the offensive line has done a great job just rolling with the injures, rolling with the ups and downs. \n“I thought the O-line did a good job down the stretch, kind of wearing them down. To be able to see that against Nebraska, who’s a very good defense — they were able to pretty much shut the run game down for the first three quarters. To be able to pop off a couple big ones in the fourth quarter when we really needed to, I think that was really good to see.” \nThat also makes life easier on Stave, who led UW down the field on two potential winning drives in the final three minutes against the Cornhuskers. Establishing a run game moving forward also could spark a passing game that struggled for large portions of the first two Big Ten games. \nClement may return soon, and UW’s offensive line took major steps forward last week. The Badgers enter today with optimism about their offense — a feeling that may not have existed a week earlier . \n“This year’s just a little bit different because of injuries, because of changes in personnel, changes in coaching staff — there’s a lot that goes into that,” Stave said. “But I think coach (Paul) Chryst does a great job just kind of going with what he’s got, going with the personnel that he has and doing everything he can to put together a successful offense. \n“It’s definitely a different Wisconsin team than we’ve seen in the past. That’s just what happens.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T20:08:35.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
