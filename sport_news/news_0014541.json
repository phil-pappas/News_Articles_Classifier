With games against Brighton (Friday), Kirby and Overton remaining, he has 2,297 passing yards, leaving him 758 from Evans' record 3,055. Averaging 253 yards the rest of the way is a lot to ask, but it would be a considerable drop from his current per-game average of 328.1, far and away the best in the city.\nGolden (6-2, 170) is also in great shape. At 1,012 yards, he's 341 shy of Dodson's record of 1,353. He'll need to average about 118 yards per game to get there, which would be a drop from his current 144.5.\nBoth Craine, who already has an offer from Arkansas State, and Golden are juniors, meaning there could be even more records in their future.\nGAME OF THE WEEK\n(9) Northpoint (8-0, 3-0 Division 2-A West) at Harding (6-1, 2-1), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: In Northpoint's corner, Christian Sauslberry and Nelson Fabrizius. In Harding's corner, Calvin Austin and Marquavious Moore. Which means there should be no shortage of points. Playoff implications abound as well; a victory by the Lions would give them sole possession of first place.\nDANDY DOZEN GAMES\n(3) MUS (5-2, 1-0 Division 2-AA West) at Briarcrest (4-3, 0-1), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: The Saints had the week off to try and figure out what went wrong in a 49-3 loss to CBHS on Oct. 2. Now they'll have to deal with an MUS team coming off a 31-0 win over St. Benedict two weeks ago, one in which it played well after a slow start.\nSt. Benedict (3-4, 0-1 Division 2-AA West) at (5) CBHS (5-2, 1-0), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: CBHS isn't one for moral victories, but a hard-fought 28-21 loss to powerful St. Louis CBC last week was another sign of the progress the team is making in Thomas McDaniel's first year. Stopping Austin Lee and the Brothers' ground game is priority one for the Eagles.\nCentral (4-3, 2-2 Region 8-5A) at (8) Southwind (6-1, 3-1), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: Two of the area's top defenses meet in a game that will have a huge impact on the region standings. Southwind is tied with Brighton for second, while the Warriors are among three teams tied for third. And only the top four make the playoffs.\n(10) St. George's (6-1, 2-0 Division 2-A West) at Tipton-Rosemark (2-5, 0-2), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: The Gryphons own the area's top offense, are scoring nearly 40 points per game and are in control of the league race. It will take a huge effort if TRA is to change any of that.\n(11) Olive Branch (4-3, 2-1 MHSAA 1-6A) at Horn Lake (2-6, 0-3), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: Quarterback Brady Burse has rewritten the Olive Branch record book over the last two games and it will take a lot for the Eagles to keep him and his talented receivers out of the end zone.\nHernando (6-2, 1-2 MHSAA 1-6A) at (12) DeSoto Central (5-3, 1-2), 7 p.m.\nWhat to watch for: A must-win game for both teams if they have any hopes of making the postseason. DC's defense took a beating against Olive Branch last week and the Tigers have some good weapons, led by quarterback Robert Wilcke (802 yards passing, 727 rushing, 19 total TDs).\nTODAY'S OTHER GAMES\n7 p.m. — Melrose at Bolivar Central, Washington vs. Carver at Crump, Lewisburg at Clarksdale (Miss.), USJ at Fayette Aca., West Memphis at Jonesboro-Ark., Bolton at Kirby, ECS at Lausanne, Westwood at Lexington Catholic, Northside vs. Middle College at Melrose, KIPP at Middleton, Marion at Mountain Home (Ark.), Center Hill at Saltillo (Miss.), Columbus (Miss.) at Southaven, Tunica Institute at West Memphis Christian, Lake Cormorant at West Point (Miss.), Brighton vs. Wooddale at Halle.\nMONDAY'S GAME\n7 p.m. — Douglass vs. Trezevant at the Fairgrounds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:37:39.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
