Mason Mingus ran third, a career-best, and Erik Jones finished fourth and extended his series lead to 18 points over second place Tyler Reddick, who came home fifth on Saturday. \nJones picked the inside for the final restart, even though he could have started in front of Gallagher. Peters wasn’t particularly surprised that Jones picked the preferred lane, rather than choosing the spot in front of his teammate. \n“I kind of thought that maybe he would take the outside,” Peters said, “but we’d already gotten the radio from the tower that this was going to be the one and only attempt (at the green-white-checkered). At that point, teammates are good for 95 laps. \n“Coming to the checkered, you’re on your own, and he kind of knew it was every man for himself. I appreciate the push that Spencer gave to me. I’m glad he’s OK after that wreck on the back … The push that Spencer gave me was a little delayed, but it was enough to get us both in front of the 33 (Jones).” \nThroughout the afternoon, storylines materialized and disappeared as quickly as the smoke from the “Big One”—the almost inevitable multicar wreck that finally occurred on lap 92 of a scheduled 94 and skewed both the finishing order and the series standings. \nBrian Keselowski, making his first series start in a Ford owned by his brother, Brad Keselowski, threatened to win the race—until he ran out of fuel before the last restart. \n“They (Keselowski’s team) said right from the get-go to save fuel, and I was,” said Keselowski, who finished 17th after leading 10 laps. But you can only do so much when you’re leading. \n“You’ve got to go, so I didn’t save any when I was out front. I guess I should have, but that’s a little bit of inexperience in the Truck Series probably showing up. We’ll learn better next time.” \nTwo-time defending series champion Matt Crafton was shuffled to the rear of the field when debris struck to the grille of his No. 88 Toyota, but that was the least of his troubles. Crafton was a victim of the lap 92 10-truck wreck ignited by contact between the Tundras of Johnny Sauter and Matt Tifft. \nCrafton finished 24th and fell to third in the standings, 23 points behind Erik Jones. \nNASCAR Camping World Truck Series Talladega Superspeedway – Talladega, AL Fred’s 250 – October 24, 2015 \n1.
