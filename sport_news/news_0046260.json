Winning the pole position for the race on Saturday was great for the wallet. Doug Coby will sit on the outside of Row 1 this afternoon for the 150-lap race after he captured his third consecutive pole and the $12,000 prize that went along with it. That was more than the winner of today’s race will receive. “Only half of it is mine,” Coby said with a laugh. “(Crew chief) Phil (Moran) and I will get together and see what we’re going to do with it. It’s a lot of money that I know Doug (Dunleavy) wants us to use and spend wisely.” What started as a small idea — a $300 bonus if one of five drivers picked out of a hat won the pole, by one of the Whelen Modified Tour sponsors, Dunleavy — became the buzz of the garage on Saturday. That’s because there was a catch: if none of the five picked won the pole, the bonus money rolled over. The bonus was won in the first two races of the season and has built ever since. Dunleavy also went out and got more contributions and on Saturday, it was winner-take-all. “It’s really something that is really appreciated,” Coby said. “You see drivers like Justin Bonsignore putting Dunleavy’s on the back of his car just to thank him for what he did (Saturday). You have to have a buzz and you have to have people talk about your series to get noticed.” There should be more notoriety today. Three drivers sat at the table on Saturday following the time trials: Coby, the pole sitter, Woody Pitkat who qualified third behind Timmy Solomito, and Ryan Preece, who will start in the fifth slot behind the front two rows. Coby and Preece are tied atop the points lead with 565 each while Pitkat is four points behind. Coby said that point differential, or lack thereof, has created a totally different atmosphere for the race today. “The only way to guarantee (a championship) is to win the race and lead the most laps and we’ve never been in that position before,” Coby said. “It’s always been just go out there and survive and that’s nerve-wracking enough because this race is typically one of the most crazy on the schedule.” In part, that craziness is created by the weather. Page 2 of 2 - Those in attendance today, like they were on Saturday, will be bundled up. Temperatures were in the mid-50’s with a stiff breeze for Day 2 of the World Series and Day 3 is slated to be even cooler and just as breezy. “I think it will be interesting. You’re going to see who is driving with everything they have,” Preece said. “The conditions aren’t perfect, you have to drive it.” Coby’s No. 2 machine has been the dominant car at Thompson, having won the previous three races held this season. “Doug has had a really good car this season, so has Woody and we have, too, but this place is where we haven’t been the strongest,” Preece said. But the Berlin driver thinks his car is as strong as it has been at Thompson all year and is hopeful the cold weather affects both Coby and Pitkat negatively, bringing them back to him. “I kind of wish I was (starting) on the outside in fourth because then it might give me a chance to make a run at Doug, but a lot can happen,” Preece said. Coby said he believes the key will be the pit stop. Will everyone come in together or does someone stay out and then try to blast through the field at the end? “That would be exciting,” Coby said. Coby said the pole does afford him the possible opportunity to lead the most laps and win the championship even if he doesn’t happen to win the race. “I’m just hoping for a long run and, at the beginning, everyone settles in and we get the first caution on lap 75. I would be happy. I would have it clinched if I can get up front and lead (if that happens),” Coby said Coby is the defending Whelen Modified Tour champ. Preece has also won a title while Pitkat is seeking his first. “I know it’s going to be tough,” Pitkat said. “They have been up top the past three or four years and just for me to say, even if I lose (today), that I was able to run with them all year and have a shot, it’s a huge accomplishment.” By Marc Allard The Bulletin The Bulletin By Marc Allard The Bulletin Posted Oct. 17, 2015 at 7:42 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:23:20.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
