(Photo: David Scrivner/Iowa City Press-Citizen) Buy Photo \nTwo years ago, Keiffer Sexton got serious. \nThe Highland cross country runner entered his sophomore year well-versed in the sport, but wanted to increase his prospects. Sexton, currently in his senior campaign, attended offseason camps and began to strategize more. \nThen the rise occurred. \nSexton finished 33rd in Class 1A at the state meet as a sophomore and eighth last season as a junior. He mainly complimented teammate Evan Mahler, who placed fourth at state in 2014 for the Huskies. \nNow, Sexton is the ace of the program. \n“This year Keiffer’s really come into his own,” Highland coach Angie Strobel said. “He’s running faster than he ever has. \n“Before, his teammate had always done that, and it’s always challenging to run at the front both mentally and physically. You have to keep that pace, you have to know your pace, and you have to keep pushing even if someone’s not close to you. I think a lot of kids crumble under that kind of pressure.” \nSexton, who is garnering interest from Division I Western Illinois, hasn’t been close to crumbling under pressure this fall. He is ranked No. 14 in 1A by the Iowa Association of Track Coaches. \nThe veteran’s lowest finish in a meet this season is fourth, and he has four meet victories, including a first-place finish in the SEISC meet Oct. 8 in 16:40, nine seconds quicker than the second-place runner. Sexton’s time at state in 2014 was 16:55. \nBefore another appearance at state is the state qualifying meet, which is Thursday for all four classes. Highland competes in Cedar Rapids. The first three teams plus the first 15 individual place winners will qualify for the state meet. \n“We’re going to keep things like we’ve done, stay consistent,” Strobel said. “We’re going to try to taper down a little bit, but not too much. We’ve still done some moderate workouts to keep them fast.” \nDespite the success for Sexton this season, his mindset is perhaps quite different from that of other runners. \nEspecially runners from smaller schools. \n“Every time I win a meet, I don’t have that feeling that I’m the best,” Sexton said. “If Bellevue (No. 2 in 1A) were to be in every race, or someone from a 4A school that’s ranked, or even in 2A or 3A, that would be the challenge — to beat them.” \nTake the example of where Sexton would rank in 4A at last year’s state meet with his time from 1A. The time of 16:55 puts him in 67th in the 4A field, while the time ranks in the top 10 in 1A. \n“There’s always going to be stats that show someone else is better,” Sexton said. “I always know I have to go forward and to try and improve.” \nReach Matt Cozzi at mcozzi@press-citizen.com or 319-887-5409, and follow him on Twitter @matt_cozzi .
