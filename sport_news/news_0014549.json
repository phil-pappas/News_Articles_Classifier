The Bush Push. An unbelievable finish. \nTen years ago this week, top-ranked USC and ninth-ranked Notre Dame met in a game that produced some of the most iconic plays — and one of the most controversial endings —- in college football history. \nUSC, led by Coach Pete Carroll, Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Matt Leinart and Heisman-winner-to-be Reggie Bush, took a 27-game winning streak to Notre Dame Stadium in South Bend, Ind., a key stop on the Trojans' planned return to the Bowl Championship Series title game. \nNotre Dame, under first-year Coach Charlie Weis, had awakened echoes of Notre Dame glory with a team that featured quarterback Brady Quinn and many others who would play in the NFL. \nThis is the story, told through participants' words and recollections, about USC's epic 34-31 victory. The buildup to game day \n\"The biggest thing that really stands out is that there was such an importance for students and, really, kind of the university. They had pictures of Pete Carroll and Matt Leinart and Reggie Bush posted all around campus, but in the worst places. They were in the bathroom urinals, on the floor of the cafeteria. It was absolutely crazy.\" — Darius Walker, Notre Dame running back \n\"On Thursday at practice there was a plane flying over every 15 or 20 minutes. They were all private jets of people coming in. I think at one point the coaches looked at us as if to say, 'This is going to be a great game.' \" — Ambrose Wooden, Jr. Notre Dame cornerback \n\"It felt like peewee football when you lay out your uniform a week in advance. It's the reason why you chose the school, and everything about college football you wanted to do was coming up in that game. The best team in the land is coming to your place.\" — Tom Zbikowski, Notre Dame safety Daniel \"Rudy\" Ruettiger, on whose life the movie \"Rudy\" was based, pumps up Notre Dame fans at a Friday prep rally. (Kohl Threlkeld / Associated Press)\n\"They were a team coming off a national championship, a team trying to maintain a streak and had the weight of the world on them. For us, we had the weight of the Notre Dame world on our shoulders.\" — Brady Quinn, Notre Dame quaraterback \n\"It was like playing a big playoff game. That's what it felt like the whole week leading up to it. We normally did pep rallies that had about 10,000 to 12,000 [at the Joyce Center]. We showed up for the pep rally that Friday night and there were 50,000 people [at Notre Dame Stadium]. ... I played into that and brought in all the heavyweights, Joe Montana and all the guys from Notre Dame history.\" — Charlie Weis, Notre Dame coach \n\"There were a thousand people waiting for us. It was like, 'OK, these guys are ready to play.' They were pulling out all the stops. This was their Super Bowl pep rally.\" — Matt Leinart, USC quarterback \n\"We get to Notre Dame, it's like 3,000 people out there. And it was so dangerous, they're right in your face. I couldn't believe they didn't have it roped off or some security. ... It was unbelievable. They've got O.J. pictures, old ladies flipping you the bird. ... It was unbelievable that none of our kids took someone and shoved them out of the way.\" — Todd McNair, USC running backs coach \n\"Just a mob of Irish fans. I don't think any of us knew they had planned for their rally that night. And there was zero security. I remember walking through all these people and little kids and everybody yelling and I'm thinking, 'I hope some of our players don't do something here'. ... I think, at that moment, that started the energy for the game.\" — Steve Sarkisian, USC offensive coordinator \n\"I just remember [in the walk-through] the grass was tall and long and it was a little, like, soggy. I just laughed because I thought it was childish or antics they had with growing the grass and watering down the field to slow us down. I'd seen it done in high school a bunch but never in college. I laughed it off.\" — Desmond Reed, USC kick returner \n\"The thing with Notre Dame, with me, it was little bit personal. They gave me a scholarship coming out of high school and they took the scholarship away from me because they didn't think I was going to pass the SAT. ... It was more personal for me than anyone else, something I was holding onto. ... [At the walk-through] I was like, are we at the jungle? You know how people let their yards grow and don't have it cut for weeks or months? Everybody was looking at each other like 'What's going on?' \" — Dwayne Jarrett, USC wide receiver \n\"We saw the rally on the news that night. I told our guys Joe Montana isn't going to play, Lou Holtz isn't going to coach and Jesus isn't going to play, either.\" — Pete Carroll, USC coach (Los Angeles Times / Associated Press) The pregame \n\"Our buses get to the stadium, come to a stop and everyone is rocking it, like the Titanic. … And then Keith Rivers jumps out in the aisle and starts going berserk. He's yelling and he still has his headphones on — you don't know if he's singing the rap song or talking to us. Then his headphones fall off and he's screaming, 'This is our house! We've got to show we're USC!' He's got the whole bus yelling and cussing. [Safety] Scott Ware is in the back trying to break the window to get to the fans faster.\" — Thomas Williams, USC linebacker \n\"I was that way for every game: Kind of like a caged animal, just waiting for the door to open. That was just the hallmark of those teams. We were always ready. I don't think anybody was nervous.\" — Scott Ware, USC safety \n\"I guess it was my break-out-of-my-shell moment in college. ... That game happened and it put me in the zone.\" — Keith Rivers, USC linebacker \n\"We thought it was going to be like any other year. ... They talked about how [Weis] was the guru and he was going to be able to shut down Pete Carroll. ... No matter how big the game was, we never changed. We thought, 'We're going to destroy this team and get back and party.' We always had some things going on and we hated to be hanging around Notre Dame and be four hours away. At the end of the day, we needed to get back to Hollywood.\" — LenDale White, USC running back The teams warm up on the field and then return to their locker rooms. Notre Dame players, who had warmed up in Navy blue jerseys, were surprised to find Kelly green jerseys in their lockers. \n\"I went to Notre Dame. I always remembered my junior year, that was the real Green Jersey Game in 1977, the year we came out in green jerseys and whupped them pretty good that day. [Notre Dame defeated USC, 49-19] I always felt to use them it had to be a really big game. There was going to be the right time to pull that out. I started working on that in the off-season, not knowing if that year there was going to be a right time. I didn't know if it was going to be a big enough game. We were sitting there at 4-1. The only game we had lost was Michigan State. We were turning into a pretty good football team. ... You already knew what the reaction was going to be.\" — Charlie Weis \n\"I remember coming back in the locker room, everyone is screaming and yelling. You see the jersey and you're just like, 'A !' It was pandemonium. We were ready to go.\" — Corey Mays \n\"I was lucky enough to be a captain for that game. Walking out of the tunnel, it was me, Leinart, Reggie and the other captains. The band is playing and you hit the grass. It was like you were in a movie.\" — Collin Ashton, USC linebacker \n\"We came out of the locker room to the field for the start of the game and there's the song girls and the band, and Reggie goes and snatches a flag. He runs all the way down to the far end zone and spikes the flag in the ground. Pow! I was like, 'We got this.' \" — Todd McNair The first half: After trading possessions, Notre Dame tries a flea-flicker pass, but Quinn's arm is hit by Trojans defensive lineman Frostee Rucker and the ball flutters. Rivers intercepts to set up what would be the first of Bush's three touchdowns. Bush takes a handoff up the middle, sprints past the line of scrimmage and cuts to his left, hurdling Notre Dame defensive back Ambrose Wooden Jr. on his way to a 36-yard touchdown and 7-0 lead. Pat Haden, providing commentary on the NBC broadcast, called Bush \"The 1st Amendment with hips.\" \nBush jumps away from Notre Dame's Chris Frome en route to the first touchdown of the game. (Alexander Gallardo / Los Angeles Times) \n\"Just the Reggie Show, per usual.\" — Greig Carlson, USC return specialist \n\"You think it's going to be a long day for their defense, and a short day for us.\" — Thomas Williams \"It was one of those Reggie-being-Reggie plays. It was easy to block for that guy.\" — Sam Baker, USC left tackle \n\"I tried to hit him mid-thigh and the dude just literally jumped over me. ... It happened so fast. I flipped over and look immediately to see No. 5 running to the end zone. Next thing, you're on the phone with the DB coach saying a holy blessing. We call it an Irish blessing.\" — Ambrose Wooden Jr. \n\"Reggie scores, I'm thinking, 'OK, the dam broke, we're just going to steamroll 'em from here on out.' Well, that didn't happen.\" — Steve Sarkisian Notre Dame starts to target tall wide receivers Maurice Stovall and Jeff Samardzija. Fighting Irish running back Travis Thomas rushes for a 16-yard touchdown to tie the score, 7-7, before USC quarterback Matt Leinart connects with tight end Dominque Byrd for a 52-yard pass play that sets up LenDale White's short touchdown run. \n\"We really felt like we could put up just as many points as they could. We knew they had Matt Leinart and Reggie but we felt like we could keep up with them in a shootout.\" — Darius Walker \n\"I followed [fullback David] Kirtman. It was a walk-in. It was a big thing to give the ball to the ref after the score. I would try to find a way every week to give the ball to the ref a different way. The band was already starting their song. I threw it so far it went over his head.\" [On the sideline, White looked into the lens of a TV camera and said, \"All day.\"] — LenDale White Notre Dame ties the score, 14-14, early in the second quarter on a 32-yard touchdown pass from Quinn to Samardzija. \n\nThe touchdown sets the stage for a game-turning moment: Zbikowski's 60-yard punt return for a touchdown and a 21-14 Notre Dame lead. \n\n\n\"I just didn't get the hang time I wanted. He was able to catch the ball and make the move before he was touched. ... Since we watched it in film the Monday after the game, I have not watched it once. If it comes on TV, I turn it off.\" — Tom Malone, USC punter \n\"When you have someone well over 200 pounds — normally you have the little guys that make you miss. ... He made the first guy miss and then outran everybody. I don't think they realized how fast he was.\" — Charlie Weis \n\"I just had too much open space. They kicked it to the left hash and I had the right return. I shot past a guy and then turned the corner on our sideline. Chase Anastasio gets a nasty little peel back and then I break three tackles like it's nothing. Easy money. I see a couple of white jerseys with some yellow pants but they're a blur. ... That was one of my best.\" — Tom Zbikowski \n\"He wanted it more, to be honest. ... He just went through tackles. The guy was a professional boxer. I guess that's why he ran that back. I think I tagged him. He definitely would have been down if we were playing flag football.\" — Thomas Williams \"I remember trying to tackle him and cause a fumble, like an idiot.\" — Tom Malone \n\"The last thing that I thought I would be doing is trying to tackle this guy on a punt return in open space. It was kind of shocking. I'll never forget that play. And the crowd went crazy.\" — Lawrence Jackson, USC defensive end \n\"That's Zibby. That's one tough guy, one of the toughest teammates I ever had. I literally would go anywhere and bring him with me. If there's an issue, if there's a backyard brawl, he's coming with me.\" — Corey Mays \n\"You could really feel, especially on that punt return, a rebirth in us. As in: You know we can play with them on every level. We have talent to play with them on any level.\" — Darius Walker \"That was all we needed to feel like we could do it.\" — Brady Quinn \n\"The momentum, the energy that play created, it was like, 'Oh crap. OK, here we go.' \" — Matt Leinart \"I thought we were in command of that game … until we weren't.\" — Pete Carroll On the ensuing kickoff, USC return specialist Desmond Reed turns to move backward to catch the ball and suffers a major knee injury. \n\"I already had a big return. Now it was my time to come and do it again. The great thing was: No one wanted to kick to Reggie, so I knew the ball was coming to me. ... I turned and it felt like I was stepping in quicksand. I heard a loud pop … I truly do think it was the condition of the field. [Notre Dame defensive lineman Chris Frome also suffered a major knee injury in the game]. But I also believe everything happens for a reason. It was God's plan for me.\" — Desmond Reed, who came back from major reconstructive surgery in 2006 and returned a punt 43 yards against Notre Dame. \n\"At halftime, I think [the players] thought they could win the game. ... They believed they were going to win. ... It wasn't like a lot of hoopla. ... We knew we were going to have to play a very good second half or there was no chance.\" — Charlie Weis \n\"At halftime, we needed to settle down. We got caught up in the emotion of the game a little too much. ... Desmond got hurt and everyone was mad the grass was long. They thought that's why Desmond got hurt. And we lost focus of the game, which was right in front of us.\" — Steve Sarkisian \n\"There was no rah-rah thing. It was more. 'We've been here before. Look, we're down, we'll go out and make a couple plays, we'll put 40 up and be out of here.' We believed so much in what we had going on.\" — LenDale White \n\"I just remember Pete [Carroll] doing what Pete does: acting like we've practiced for this, no big deal, let's just come out and do what we practiced and what we've done a 1,000 times.\" — John David Booty, USC backup quarterback USC quarterback Matt Leinart calls out signals behind center Ryan Kalil against the Notre Dame on October 15, 2005. (Alex Gallardo / Los Angeles Times) Second half: USC receives the kickoff, and quarterback Matt Leinart keeps alive a drive with a fourth-down sneak. But Notre Dame's Mike Richardson intercepts a pass, Leinart's second interception of the game. On USC's next series, Leinart attempts to block for tailback White, who falls onto Leinart and appears to shake up the Heisman Trophy winner. \n\"That game I didn't play great. I made some plays, but I also made some poor decisions. ... That play with LenDale dinged me up a little bit. Those freaking guys [Bush and White] would always reverse field on me, especially Reggie. I can't tell you how many times I tried to block. It didn't feel good.\" — Matt Leinart On the next play, Bush takes a handoff and runs off left tackle on his way to 45-yard run that ties the score, 21-21. Bush slows down the final 10 yards and Notre Dame safety Tom Zbikowski shoves him in the end zone.\n\"I loved running people down, especially super-fast dudes. I had the same play happen to me when I was 6 years old and I had the ball. I was embarrassed and was never going to let that happen again. If you can punch the ball out to the back of the end zone, it's a change of possession. I'd rather get the personal foul for the late hit that wasn't called. It was Pac-10 officiating. It wasn't like a home call.\" — Tom Zbikowski \n\"I probably told [Bush], 'Hey, if you haven't noticed, we really haven't put the dagger in them yet. There's no time for that.' \" — Todd McNair Notre Dame appears to be on the verge of answering as Quinn completes a 26-yard pass to tight end Anthony Fasano at the Trojans' 30-yard line. But USC safety Darnell Bing comes from behind and punches the ball toward the end zone. Rivers recovers the ball at the Notre Dame six-yard line. \n\"I saw how loosely he was handling the ball. That was around the time I felt like I was pretty decent at stripping the ball. I just went for it. I didn't even make an attempt to tackle. Fortunately, Keith Rivers was there because when I did it I came down on my leg and hyperextended it.\" — Darnell Bing Early in the fourth quarter, Notre Dame goes ahead, 24-21, on D.J. Fitzpatrick's 32-yard field goal. On the ensuing series, Leinart throws a pass intended for receiver Dwayne Jarrett on the right sideline. Jarrett dives and his head hits the ground. \n\"The cornerback came over and made a great play on the ball, hitting me at the same time. My helmet fell over my eyes. When I got up from the play my vision was blurry. I was seeing double vision. I was out there playing with one eye. The doctors, they gave me some eye drops, some smell stuff to get my senses back. Nothing was working. I just had to play the game with one eye. I didn't want to let my team down. Like I said, Notre Dame was personal.\" — Dwayne Jarrett \n“[Play-caller] Lane [Kiffin] is up in the booth saying, ‘Just put him back in. He'll be fine. Put him back in, he'll be fine.’ I said, ‘You're not down here. He’s not fine right now.’” — Steve Sarkisian D.J. Fitzpatrick misses a 35-yard field-goal attempt and USC then begins a sustained drive. Starting at their 20, the Trojans move downfield on passes to Steve Smith and Jarrett and a reverse by Bush. Three plays later, Bush scores on a nine-yard run to put USC ahead, 28-24. \n“They earned a touchdown the hard way. They were a West Coast team doing three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust on the super-long grass. It was elite athletes playing old-school, hard-nosed football where you hit each other hard as you can. It was snot bubbles, bad breath and bad attitudes.” — Tom Zbikowski Samardzija makes a catch. (Getty Images) \n“I remember thinking when we finally took the lead, 'OK, we're good now.' And then, sure enough, Brady was on fire and Samardzija was on fire. I was like, 'Dang it. OK, here we go again.’” — Steve Sarkisian \n“On our drive after their drive, Brady was rah-rahing us and saying, ‘We can respond the same way.’” — Darius Walker Notre Dame starts at its 13-yard line, Quinn completing four passes and Walker rushing three times to set up second-and-goal at USC's five. Quinn runs, dives and extends the ball over the goal-line to give Notre Dame a 31-28 lead, sending the crowd into delirium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:08:16.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
