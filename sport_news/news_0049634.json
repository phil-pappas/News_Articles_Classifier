Otgoo was arrested after police released security video of him on the train to the public, authorities said.\nCook County Circuit Court Judge Lauren Edidin sentenced Otgoo to five years in the Illinois Department of Corrections during a hearing Wednesday at the Skokie courthouse.\n\"I am happy that the perpetrator of this vicious attack on a 60-year-old man was brought to justice,\" said Cook County Assistant State's Attorney Michelle Gemskie.\n\"The Skokie Police Department and the Chicago Police Department did an outstanding job in identifying the perpetrator,\" she added.\nProsecutors described a brutal attack that began after Otgoo started yelling at other train passengers. They said that when the victim told Otgoo to be quiet, Otgoo attacked him.\nPhotos of the victim taken the day after the attack show a boot print on his forehead, his eyes black and blue and swollen shut.\nDuring the sentencing hearing Wednesday, Otgoo denied he was the man in the CTA security video released. The victim, however, said Otgoo was his attacker, and though the victim was ill and could not be in court Tuesday, he asked prosecutors to read aloud a victim impact statement on his behalf.\n\"The defendant pulled my hooded sweatshirt over my head and punched and kicked me in the face and body even as I lay on the floor of the train curled up to defend myself,\" the statement read. \"I now suffer from migraine headaches and have lost several teeth due to this vicious attack. It is rare that I go out at night anymore. I do not take any trains or buses.\"\nHe went on to say that he suffers from depression and anxiety, that he is on medication for both and that he does not visit with friends like he did before the attack.\nHe also said he cares for his sick 82-year-old mother and asked the judge to give Otgoo \"a heavy consequence for beating an elderly man.\"\n\"It is hard living this new life,\" the victim said in the statement. \"It can be lonely and frustrating at times just trying to cope day to day and do ordinary things.\"\nBrian L.
