She scored from 15 yards out past the goalie on the far ride side of the net. “We controlled possession for what it seemed like 70 minutes or so and then we had a breakdown,” said Materazzi. ”Fairmont started to press a little bit on our end and picked up the energy. We struggled here for a little bit but we calmed down and settled in for the last ten minutes.\" After a scoreless opening half, Minor scored her first goal of the game in the 61st minute. The ball was kicked around and deflected before she found the back of the net for her first goal of the season. In the 82nd minute, Harley Boyd tied the game for the Fighting Falcons (0-9-1). Erica Uselton assisted on the goal. AB (4-7) finished with 20 shots, eight on goal, in the match. Fairmont State finished with five. Goalkeeper Tayler Garcia stopped one shot in net and recorded her fourth win on the season. \"It’s a good step forward,” said Materazzi. “I thought we played really well for 75 minutes. Hopefully by Thursday and the weekend’s games, we can play good for 90.” The Battlers return to action Thursday when they host Ursuline at 7 p.m. Share", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:56:34.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
