(AP Photo/Koji Sasahara) Report an error \nROME -- If baseball rejoins the Olympics for the 2020 Tokyo Games, just qualifying for the tournament could be a challenge. \nUnder Tokyo's recommendations, the men's baseball competition would consist of just six teams -- two less than the World Baseball Softball Confederation's proposal. \nWBSC president Riccardo Fraccari tells The Associated Press that, in addition to host and automatic qualifier Japan, one team would qualify by winning the 2019 Premier 12 tournament. \nThe other four entrants could be determined by continental qualifying tournaments: two from the Americas, one from Europe-Africa and one from Asia-Oceania. \nFraccari says: \"It's going to be a battle to the last out.\" \nA combined baseball-softball bid was among five additional sports recommended last month by Tokyo organizers. Karate, surfing, skateboarding and sports climbing were the others. \nThe IOC will make a final decision in August.
