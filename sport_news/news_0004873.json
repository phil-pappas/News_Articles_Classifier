(Jason O. Watson/Getty Images) \nThe Nationals have interest in former Padres manager Bud Black and Giants longtime bench coach Ron Wotus for their managerial vacancy, according to people familiar with the situation. Also, the team recently interviewed Phil Nevin, the Diamondbacks’ Class AAA manager, the first known interview for their managerial vacancy. \nBlack, 58, has emerged as a strong candidate for the Nationals job based on his experience (eight and a half seasons as the Padres manager) and qualities (easy-going personality, good communication skills, former pitcher and pitching coach). He posted a 649-713 record in San Diego, never reached the playoffs but won the NL Manager of the Year award in 2010. \nBlack has ties to the West Coast. He was born in California and grew up in Longview, Wash., about two hours south of Seattle, where the Mariners are also in search of a manager. According to a person familiar with the situation, geography is not an issue for Black. He wants to manage again; San Diego was his first major league managerial job. \nBlack has been mum about managerial vacancies across baseball; the Nationals, Mariners, Marlins and Padres have positions to fill. Serving as a guest host on MLB Network Radio during the postseason, Black said last week that the Nationals job was “an very attractive position, very good team, great city.” \nThe Nationals have also shown interest in Wotus, who has been the Giants’ well-respected bench coach since 1999, serving under managers Felipe Alou, Dusty Baker and Bruce Bochy. Under Bochy as his right-hand man, Wotus has been an integral part of the Giants teams that won the World Series in 2010, 2012 and 2014, which included an NLDS toppling of the Nationals. \nWotus, 54, is known for his personality, communication skills, infield coaching, and ability to blend old and new baseball ideas such as defensive shifts. The Connecticut native had brief stints as a major league infielder with the Pirates in 1983 and 1984. He managed in the Giants’ minor leagues from 1991 to 1997, twice winning manager of the year awards. He became a major league coach in 1998 under Baker. \nOver the past 15 years, Wotus has interviewed for openings with the Mariners, Rays, Dodgers and Pirates. \nNationals General Manager Mike Rizzo has identified previous experience as key during the managerial search. That could apply in many ways. Black, for example, has years of major league managerial experience, while Wotus has deep knowledge of how to run a team and has learned under Bochy, known as one of baseball’s elite managers. \nThe Nationals have been contacting potential candidates and begun the interviewing process. Nevin, an up-and-coming managerial candidate, spoke to the Nationals, who had permission from the Diamondbacks , after an interview with the Marlins. The Padres and Mariners are reportedly interested, too. \nNevin, 44, has never managed beyond Class AAA but has received solid reviews from players and his bosses. The former longtime major league infielder was known for his emotional outbursts as a player, but has mellowed as minor league manager. He began managing in independent league baseball in 2009, then moved to the Tigers’ Class AA and AAA affiliates. In two seasons as the manager of the Reno Aces, the Diamondbacks’ Class AAA affiliate, Nevin compiled a 151-137 record. \n— Chelsea Janes contributed James Wagner joined the Post in August 2010 and, prior to covering the Nationals, covered high school sports across the region. sports Success!
