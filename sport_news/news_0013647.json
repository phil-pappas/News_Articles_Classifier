It was only after the defendant moved out of the home that the victim found the courage to come forward.”\nCobb Superior Court Judge Robert E. Flournoy sentenced Spencer to 30 years, with 20 years to serve in prison and the rest on probation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:31:36.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
