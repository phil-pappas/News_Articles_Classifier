He currently leads the Pac-12 in both touchdown passes (15, tied for third in NCAA) and passing yards (1,630, No. 7 NCAA), while also ranking among the league leaders and country's top 10 in passer efficiency rating (170.5, No. 2 Pac-12, No. 7 NCAA) and completion percentage (125-178, 70.2 percent, No. 3 Pac-12, No. 8 NCAA). \nPhoto credit: \n\nUtah cannot let receivers get open like it did in Week 1 against Michigan, or Goff will make the Utes pay. \nThe key will be to get pressure on him and force mistakes, and Utah has historically been known for a dominant pass rush (after all they do call it Sack Lake City). Through five games this season, Goff has been pressured 52 times and sacked 12 times. \nh four games), the Utes have gotten pressure on opposing quarterbacks, forcing bad throws that Utah has converted into seven interceptions (1.75 per game, No. 17 NCAA). Give and take \nWhile most attention on this game is focusing on Utah's defense against Jared Goff, the real battle may be taking place when the Utes have the ball. Cal boasts a much improved defense that leads the nation with 18 turnovers (eight fumble recoveries, tied No. 1 NCAA; 10 interceptions, tied No. 2 NCAA). The Bears defense also ranks first in the Pac-12 in total sacks (18) and sacks per game (3.6). \nUtah has only turned the ball over four times this season two by its backup quarterback, one on a kickoff return fumble and the other a Hail Mary interception before the half. Utah's Wilson ranked in top 12 for rushing \nAs a team, the Utes are averaging 204 yards per game on the ground. Cal's rush defense is holding teams to 137.2 yards per game. Last of the undefeated teams in Pac-12 \nThe Utes 4-0 start is their best since opening the 2010 season with eight-straight wins, while Cal's 5-0 start is its best since 2007. The last time the Bears opened the season 6-0 was back in 1950. Scoring streaks \nCal has gone on a run in each of its five victories. The Golden Bears scored 66 straight vs. Grambling State, 35 against San Diego State, 27 at Texas, 24 at Washington and 14 vs. Washington State. \nThe Utes have had similar streaks, scoring 14 straight against Michigan, 10 vs. Utah State, 21 at Fresno State and perhaps the most impressive of any team in the country", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:15:02.994+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
