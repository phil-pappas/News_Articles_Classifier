Fejedelem talks about his decision here. \n\"I just decided to commit to Air Force after giving it a lot of thought,\" Fejedelem said. \"I really talked it over with my parents and Air Force is an opportunity that is too hard to pass up so I committed.\" \nFejedelem discussed why he decided to end his recruiting process and pledge to the Falcons. \n\"I had a great visit and just loved the academy. The overall benefits of going to the Air Force Academy after graduation is just too hard to pass up. Air Force offers a great education and just a ton of post graduation benefits. I also really liked the campus and the facilities at Air Force. I've seen a lot of Big Ten schools and the facilities at Air Force are as good or better than those schools. Colorado Springs and the surrounding area is also just beautiful.\" \nFejedelem is also thrilled to have his recruiting process completed. \n\"I'm just happy and glad to have it all over with now. I've been pretty focused on the season but now I can just not worry at all about recruiting. It just hit me today that now that we've made the state playoffs I only have three guarenteed games left in my high school career. I want to just go out and enjoy the rest of the season as much as I can with no distractions.\" \nFejedelem will also set up an official visit ti Air Force soon. \n\"I'm going to speak with the Air Force coaches later this week and I'm sure I'll get more details on taking an official visit. I'm hoping to make that visit once the season is completed.\" \nFedejelem is also excited for this week's game against Oak Forest (7-0). \n\"Oak Forest has always been a big rival for us. They are playing great this season and I'm excited to play them on Friday. Our offense is really young and took a bit to get going but now everything is clicking for us.\" \nJeremy Fedejelem is verbally committed to Air Force..
