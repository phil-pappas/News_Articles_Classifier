Oct. 22.If the Roughriders defeat Phoenix College tonight, Oct. 24, they will tie Western for the league lead. However, Yavapai, which split its season series against Western, would win the tiebreaker for the conference title and garner the top seed into next week's Region I, Division I tournament.The tiebreaker is based on how Yavapai and Western fared against the league's third-place team, Pima C.C. Yavapai beat and tied Pima, while Western beat and lost to Pima. If it plays out that way, the Roughriders would claim the title and the top seed into regionals.The region's No. 1 seed gets an opening-round bye and hosts a regional semifinal match. If Yavapai wins its semifinal Oct. 28, it would host the region championship Oct. 31.On Friday, Yavapai took a 1-0 halftime lead on Glendale, as YC's Memo Diaz scored on an assist from Niall Logue in the fifth minute.In the second half, in the 57th minute, Glendale tallied the equalizer. Tied at 1-1, Diaz scored his second goal of the afternoon on a helper from Ather Dawood to hand Yavapai the 2-1 lead that stood.Yavapai will be tested at Phoenix College tonight. The Bears are 13-3-3 in conference and handed the Roughriders one of their two losses this season. Phoenix edged YC 4-3 in overtime Sept. 5 in Prescott Valley.If the Roughriders tie the Bears, YC would secure a second- place conference finish and a bye in the first round of regionals. If Yavapai loses the match, the Riders would finish third and host an opening-round regional match on Monday, Oct. 26.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:20:05.691+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
