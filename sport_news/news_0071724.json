The team said players and staff were evacuated from the hotel and by 6 a.m. everyone was given clearance to return to their rooms.\nA number of Panthers players tweeted about the alarm. Backup QB Derek Anderson said it was just the Panthers’ floors that were disturbed by the alarm, not the entire hotel.\nJust happened to be our floors only..
