Manohar and Khan were to discuss the resumption of the Indo-Pak cricket ties and unofficial talks might be held in Delhi on Tuesday.\n\n“Under the present circumstances, it will be unreasonable to expect from Aleem that he will be able to perform his duties to the best of his abilities. As such, he has been withdraw and his replacement will be announced in due course,” an ICC spokesman said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:48:45.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
