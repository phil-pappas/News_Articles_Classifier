Washington State's lone score came on a pick-six. \nIt could be argued that the game was essentially over at the break, but if you look at the last 30 minutes of work from OSU's defense, there's a positive heading into Saturday's homecoming matchup against Colorado, which has lost 14 consecutive Pac-12 games. \n\"All I see is the improvement we made in the second half,\" senior nose tackle Kyle Peko said. \"I'm very hopeful that it will carry over into this game.\" Larry Scott questionable for Colorado game \nWhy the optimism? Well, it sure beats doom and gloom. \nIt's true, the Beavers (2-4, 0-3 Pac-12) have struggled to grasp the nuances of defensive coordinator Kalani Sitake's 3-4 base defense, and they haven't been very effective in the 4-3, either, at least not in conference games. \nMore pressure on the quarterback would help. The eight sacks ranks last in the Pac-12. \nInjuries also have been an issue. Senior defensive end Jalen Grimble (knee) missed the past two games, and senior cornerback Larry Scott, the most experienced player in the secondary, is doubtful for Saturday's game with an ankle injury. \nBut in the big picture, it comes down to execution according to junior strong safety Devin Chappell. \n\"Like coach (Gary) Andersen says, we have to respect the process,\" Chappell said. \"But at the end of the day there's no excuses. Our coaches are doing a great job teaching us the scheme. We have to do what they ask of us.\" \nThe defensive numbers, as you would expect, are not good. OSU ranks 11th in the Pac-12 in scoring defense (33.5 points per game), 10th in rushing defense (198.5 yards per game) and eighth in total defense (414.7 ypg). \nSitake, when asked to grade OSU's defensive performance at midseason, pointed to the bottom line rather than provide a letter grade. No quick fix for Beavers \n\"Well, we're 2-4 (overall) and 0-3 in the league, so that's not really good,\" Sitake said, adding \"what do you grade on when guys haven't even scored on the (goal sheet)? It's like handing in a blank piece of paper for the test.\" \nBut Sitake, who was Utah's defensive coordinator last season when the Utes led the nation in sacks, was encouraged by the second half at WSU. \nHe noted that \"it just felt cleaner.\" \n\"We just need to do that the whole game,\" Sitake said. \"What's promising is they did that for a half and they learned it and saw it on film. If you watched the film with us the first half was ugly and the second half was like, Ok, it's working.\" \nWill the defensive continue to work as a cohesive unit against Colorado (3-4, 0-3)? If the answer is yes, OSU likely will be celebrating its first conference victory. \nghorowitz@StatesmanJournal.com, (503) 399-6726 or Twitter.com/ghorowitz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:22:41.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
