The Royals capped a 12-play, 80-yard drive with a 10-yard TD pass from quarterback David Hibbler to AJ Hunter at the 8:32 mark. \nThe North Stars (4-2, 1-2) responded with a seven-play scoring drive, as Zach Mettetal connected with Griffin Hammer on a 14-yard pass to tie the game at 7 halfway through the first quarter. \nA second Mettetal (14 for 18 for 131 yards) to Hammer scoring pass, this time for five yards, put North ahead 14-7 three minutes into the second quarter. \n“We can’t come out slow. We have to come out ready to play,” said North coach Rob Pomazak. “That’s one of the things we will work on.” \nNorth broke the game open in a span of 21/2 minutes in the second quarter when running back Eric Lins ran for three TDs. Lins scored his first touchdown at the 7:36 mark on a 5-yard run. The junior scored 58 seconds later on an 8-yard run. After the touchdown, the North Stars recovered an onside kick at their own 47-yard line. Four plays later, Lins ran for a 32-yard touchdown run with 4:02 left in the half. Lins rushed for 128 yards on 12 carries. \nThe North Stars led, 27-7, at the half. \nSenior back William Duownik took over in the backfield in the second half. Duhownik scored two TDs for the North Stars, both on 2-yard runs. The second score put North up 48-7 halfway through the third quarter and started the running clock. \nDuownik carried the ball 13 times for 97 yards. \nRyan Specht scored North final touchdown in the fourth quarter, also on 2-yard run. \nLarkin (0-6, 0-3) threatened on its final drive but ran out of time. North stopped Chevelle Clements, who took over at quarte back when Hibbler was injured in the third quarter, just short of the goal line as time expired.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T12:51:20.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
