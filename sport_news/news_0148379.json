Prayuth asked the two to help promote Thai tourism.\n\"We are very pleased to have world-class tennis players in Thailand,\" said Prayuth. \"We hope you will help boost confidence.\"\nDjokovic last visited Thailand in 2008 when he lost the final of the Thailand Open to Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, while Nadal visited Bangkok in 2010 for the same tournament and lost in the semi-finals.\nThe two will face each other at Bangkok's Hua Mark Indoor Stadium at 1300 GMT (09:00 EDT) on Friday.\n(Reporting by Juarawee Kittisilpa, Vorasit Satienlerk and Amy Sawitta Lefevre; Writing by Amy Sawitta Lefevre; Editing by Patrick Johnston )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:43:04.252+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
