Florida will be at LSU Saturday night in a battle of Top 10 unbeatens. \n\"I'm certain they will have a very capable guy,\" said LSU head coach Les Miles at his Monday press briefing. \"I know Coach McElwain will have 'em ready to play.\" \nGrier has completed 106 of 161 passes for 1,204 yards and 10 touchdowns against 3 interceptions. \nHe is also the team's second leading rusher. \nGrier took over for Treon Harris in the season's second game. He would likely get the nod in Grier's absence.
