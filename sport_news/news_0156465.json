Image 26 of 26 Red River relief for Texas as Longhorns upset No. 10 Sooners 1  /  26 Back to Gallery DALLAS (AP) â€” Tyrone Swoopes threw a touchdown pass and ran for another score as Texas found relief in the Red River rivalry yet again, upsetting No. 10 Oklahoma 24-17 on Saturday.\nCoach Charlie Strong's Longhorns (2-4, 1-2 Big 12) came to Dallas in the midst of the program's worst start in 59 years and as two-touchdown underdog to the Sooners (4-1, 1-1). It's been nothing but turmoil and excruciating losses for the Longhorns so far, but Strong's defense harassed Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield and the offense made just enough plays to show Texas fans that better times might not be so far away.\nJerrod Heard mostly guided the Texas offense with 168 total yards and Swoopes played finisher near the goal line. His 2-yard TD flip to Caleb Bluiett with 13:52 left in the fourth quarter made it 24-10.\n___\nFollow Ralph D.
