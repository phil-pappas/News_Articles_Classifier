More >> AUBURN, AL (WSFA) - \nSenior wide receiver D'haquille Williams has been dismissed from the Auburn University Football Team, head coach Gus Malzahn announced on Monday. \n“When individuals fail to meet the expectations of our program, there has to be consequences,” Malzahn said. “I gave D’haquille the chance to prove himself. I am disappointed that it did not work out.” \nWilliams came to Auburn in the 2014 season as a transfer from Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College. He recorded 730 yards and five touchdowns on 45 catches in 2014, but was suspended prior to the 2014 Outback Bowl due to a violation of team rules. \nSo far this season, Williams had 12 catches for 147 yards and one touchdown. \nCopyright 2015 WSFA 12 News .
