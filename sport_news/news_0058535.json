Blake Dunn and the Saugatuck football team are poised for a special season. After locking in a playoff spot last week, the unbeaten Indians look to take the next step and claim a conference championship on Friday when they play at Marcellus for the new Southwestern Athletic Conference Valley Division title. \"It means a lot, especially after last year when we came within one game of sharing the league title,\" Dunn said. \"Hopefully, we can get what we want.\" It would be the sixth conference championship for the Indians in the past eight years. Saugatuck is ranked No. 6 in Division 7, led by Dunn, who set a school record for rushing yards in a game with 392 two weeks ago. The multipurpose quarterback also set the record for most total yards of offense with 530 yards. \"Every year, he takes it upon himself to improve on the previous year. He has some God-given ability, but he works his tail off above and beyond that,\" Saugatuck coach Bill Dunn said. \"It gives me tremendous pride because I know the work ethic he has.\" The younger Dunn, an all-state honorable mention as a sophomore, has taken the next step as a junior, helping the offense become well-rounded. \"Using my speed and little things have made the difference. It comes down to my dad calling the right play and our team all executing,\" Blake Dunn said. \"It definitely helped my confidence, knowing that the kids could trust me.\" Bill Dunn said the biggest improvement has come from within Blake. \"What has set him aside this year is the mental side of it. We are doing some things offensively where we are asking him to read, react and make decisions on the go, and he has done a tremendous job with it,\" Bill Dunn said. \"Some are run/pass plays with the option to throw. He is doing a better job of reading the pass coverage of the defense.\" The Saugatuck offensive line also is bigger and better, helping Dunn have more space to work with. \"Our front five has done a tremendous job. We were rather small last year, this year, we are averaging 6-0, 240 pounds across the board, which has made a huge difference,\" Bill Dunn said. \"We have great senior leadership. The camaraderie of the team is huge.\" It has led the Indians on a path of success. \"Our offense is really clicking right now. Cole Hartman broke a big run last game and Jordan Mitchell and Noah Eveland are running really well,\" Blake Dunn said. \"The goal for every team is to win a state championship. That is what we have our eyes on, but we are focused on winning the conference title.\" â€” Follow this reporter on Twitter @DanDAddona.
