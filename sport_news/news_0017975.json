Jenson is the most experienced driver currently racing in Formula 1, and next season he is due to become only the third driver [after Rubens Barrichello and Michael Schumacher] in Formula 1 history to pass the milestone of 300 Grands Prix,\" Dennis said. \nButton, world champion in 2009, admitted that he had been seriously mulling his future in the sport before deciding to stay on with the British team for another year. \n\"Over the past month or so I have done quite a lot of thinking, and it is no secret that I was at one point in two minds about my future,\" he said. \n\"But I have been a McLaren driver for six seasons now and in that time I have got to know Ron very well. He and I have had some very good chats these past few weeks, and during those chats it has become clear to me that Ron is both utterly determined and uniquely equipped to lead our team through its current difficulties to great successes in the future.\" Must read sports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T12:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:49:13.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
