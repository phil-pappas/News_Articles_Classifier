Gov. Jerry Brown approved the measure Sunday.\nNow, schools that use the word have to get rid of it by the start of 2017.\nAt Calaveras High School, the redskins Indian chief is on shirts, uniforms, the scoreboard and the wall. Removing it will not be easy or cheap, said football coach Jason Weatherby.\n“I would say somewhere between $100,000 and $200,000,’ Weatherby said. “Three sets of uniforms for our football guys at the freshman, JV and varsity level at $50 apiece, so $10,000 per set. That’s $30,000 right there withoBut even looking at anything else.”\nBrown’s signature on the Racial Mascot Act makes the redskins logo illegal, and the school must change it by Jan, 1, 2017.\n“All of my family graduated through being a redskin,” said Logan Weatherby, a freshman football player at the school. “I hate knowing we have to change it. It all seems stupid to me.”\nBut how do native tribes in Calaveras County feels about the mascot change?\nJunior football player Joseph Celli is Indian.\n“My dad is part of a tribe. My tribe specifically is fine with the name,” Celli said. “They think it’s honoring that a school would name themselves after them.”\nThe Calaveras Me-Wuk Indians agree, writing, “Our county, our citizens both native and non-native are very proud of our logo. It was heartbreaking to hear the chief head will be removed.”\nBut Dahkota Kicking Bear Brown, who was interviewed last year about this bill, was happy to hear it passed.\nIn a statement, he said, “I hope it paves the way for all other states to pass similar laws because nobody’s school or team pride should outweigh a person’s cultural identity...Creating and opportunity for native youth to obtain an education free from mockery and hold their head high with pride in their ethnicity.”\nCopyright 2015 KOVR via CNN.
