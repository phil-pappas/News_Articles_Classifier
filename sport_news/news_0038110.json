The triumph was Dillon's third of the season in the XFINITY Series and the sixth of his career.\nDillon's closest call came not on the track, but during the pre-race ceremony. A fireball from one of the skyrockets used to liven up the proceedings dropped out of the evening sky and singed Dillon's firesuit.\n\"I was actually praying, and the fireworks hit me in the back,\" Dillon said. \"I didn't know if it was a sign from God or what. But it got me going right there with a firework in the butt.\"\nNow that he's completed a season sweep in the XFINITY Series, Dillon will go for a weekend sweep on Saturday night, but he'll have to win his first NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race to achieve it.\n\"We going to do our best (on Saturday) to do the same thing we did tonight,\" Dillon said.\nBrad Keselowski ran third, followed by Daniel Suarez and Regan Smith . Chris Buescher came home seventh and extended his series lead to 26 points over defending champion Chase Elliott, who finished ninth.\nBusch lost several positions after a Lap 147 restart, and he and Kahne raced aggressively for third place--with repeated side-by-side contact between the two cars, before Busch pulled ahead. But Kahne drove hard into Turn 3 on Lap 151, tapping Busch's Toyota twice and sending it up into the outside wall.\nKahne's Chevrolet also sustained damage in the incident, but he managed to finish 12th. Busch took his car to the garage on Lap 154 and retired from the race in 31st place.\n\"Kyle got mad because he got into it with his teammate (Jones) off Turn 2 on the start,\" Kahne said after the race. \"That shuffled him back to where I was, and I'm racing to try to get by him.\"\nBy Kahne's account, the hard racing soon escalated.\n\"He started beating on me down the back and on the front, and I overdrove Turn 3 and got into him,\" Kahne said.\nBusch was not available to comment after exiting his car.\nBefore the incident, Busch had led a race-high 102 laps, taking over the all-time lead in the series at Charlotte with 1,288 laps led. Mark Martin was the previous record holder with 1,257.\nNOTE: Sunoco Rookie of the Year candidate Darrell Wallace Jr. finished eighth to record his eighth straight top-10 finish on a 1.5-mile intermediate speedway.\n  Dillon dominant in Xfinity Series race at Charlotte Herring quickest in Xfinity Series qualifying at Iowa Logano wins Xfinity race at Phoenix Logano wins Xfinity Series race at Talladega", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:43:22.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
