The Ivorian striker has been crucial for CSKA this season following his return from Roma on loan, scoring three times in the Champions League qualifying rounds and adding four more goals in the Russian league. \nPSV rallied after the break, with Lestienne scoring from close range on 60 minutes and firing in a second goal eight minutes later from the edge of the box. \nHowever, the Dutch team's comeback was blunted when right-back Santiago Arias was sent off in the 80th minute, having earned two yellow cards for separate fouls on Musa. \nLate on, a tired-looking Luciano Narsingh failed to latch on to a ball that put him in a good position in front of goal. PSV's last chance came when substitute Gaston Pereiro's shot was blocked. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:50:39.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
