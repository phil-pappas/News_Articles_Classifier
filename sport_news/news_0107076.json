It was the first time an Iranian judicial official has confirmed that a verdict has been reached.\nEjehi said the verdict can be appealed within 20 days. He said he did not know if the verdict had been given to Rezaian or his lawyer, Leila Ahsan.\nAhsan told The Associated Press \"there are no new developments\" and said she has not received the verdict.\nThe Post's executive editor, Martin Baron, called the judiciary official's statement \"vague and puzzling\" and said it \"only adds to the injustice that has surrounded Jason's case.\" He said the newspaper has no further information beyond what was announced.\n\"It is not clear whether this ruling includes a verdict or a sentence - or even whether its contents have been communicated to Jason or his lawyer,\" Baron said in an emailed statement.\nThe Post maintains Rezaian is innocent and, along with U.S. officials and media rights groups, has repeatedly pressed for his release. It says he was held for months in isolation without access to a lawyer, and later had only limited opportunity with his legal counsel before his trial began.\n\"The only thing that has ever been clear about this case is Jason's innocence,\" Baron said. \"If a ruling has been issued and is now being reviewed, this puts on the onus on Iran's senior leaders to demonstrate the fairness and justice that could only lead to Jason's exoneration and release.\"\nRezaian was detained with his wife, who is journalist for The National newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, and two photojournalists on July 22, 2014. All were later released except Rezaian.\nRezaian, the Post's Tehran bureau chief since 2012, has dual Iranian-American nationality. Iran does not recognize dual nationality for its citizens.\nRezaian faced charges of espionage in a closed-door trial that has been widely criticized by the U.S. government and press freedom organizations. He reportedly faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted.\nHis trial was heard in Revolutionary Court, which typically hears cases involving national security and other sensitive issues. The judge in the case, Abolghassem Salavati, is known for his tough sentences and has heard other politically charged cases, including those of protesters arrested in connection with demonstrations that followed the 2009 presidential elections.\nAfter Rezaian's last court hearing on August 10, his lawyer said she expected a verdict could be issued as early as the following week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T17:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:23:01.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
