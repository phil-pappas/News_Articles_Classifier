MLB: Chicago White Sox at New York Yankees Sep 26, 2015; Bronx, NY, USA; New York Yankees manager Joe Girardi (28) in the dugout before a game against the Chicago White Sox at Yankee Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Brad Penner-USA TODAY Sports (Brad Penner) Comments \nBALTIMORE — The Yankees, with their 4-1 win over the Boston Red Sox Thursday night, clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2012. \nNew York will play in the American League Wild Card game, a one-off contest to determine who will face the AL pennant winner (either the Kansas City Royals or Toronto Blue Jays) starting Thursday of next week. The Yankees will either face the Houston Astros, L.A. Angels, or Minnesota Twins . \nWith a win this weekend over the Baltimore Orioles, and the Yankees will host the game. (Also a single Houston Astros loss clinches home-field advantage for New York, too.) \nBecause the Wild Card is considered by Major League Baseball its own playoff round, the Yankees and their opponent will be able to construct a roster for that game only, one that's not beholden to the Division Series, meaning it can change by the next round. \nSo, what will they do? \nThere are 25 spots available, so, in theory, a team could stock itself with one starting pitcher, eight position players, and 16 relievers. No team will do that. But you get the idea—there's some flexibility, and a team can go heavy on relievers since there's no need to carry more than more than three starters; one to start, two for emergency. \nYankees' manager Joe Girardi didn't tip his hand much Friday talking about the rosters, though did hint at a few things they may do. ( The Yankees were rained out against the Baltimore Orioles ; only a handful of players were available to reporters.) \n\"The real question is, how many pitchers do you carry?\" Girardi said. \"And that's something that we'll have to evaluate. And part of that could depend on what happens this weekend and how many of our pitchers pitch.\" \nOK, but position players? \nGirardi also made it sound like the team would carry Rico Noel, the speedy base-stealing specialist. In just 12 games this season as a September call-up, Noel is third on the team in steals, with five. \n\"When you need a stolen base, he can go get it,\" Girardi said. \"And those guys can be very important in a playoff series. So he is definitely on our radar.\" \nGirardi, when asked how the one-game playoff specifically changes things, said he may be more inclined to carry more position players with the idea that they could pinch run. Alex Rodriguez, Carlos Beltran, or Brian McCann would all be candidates to have runners brought in for late in the game. \n\"You can carry maybe a few more pinch runners in our sense just because of the type of club that we have,\" Girardi said. \"So it becomes much different.\" \nGirardi said he didn't care which team they faced—\"They all present their challenges.\" PLUS : Yankees' Stephen Drew appears done for year \nWho's starting? \nThe Yankees' starting pitcher will be Masahiro Tanaka. While Girardi wouldn't outright confirm that, he said to \"surmise\" the situation. (Tanaka threw Wednesday in New York so he would be in line to start. He looked \"rusty\" in that start, said his manager .) \nIt's likely the Yankees will carry at least three starting pitchers—Tanaka, CC Sabathia, and Luis Severino. Remember, Tanaka has dealt with a Grade 1 pulled hamstring the past few weeks and if he gets hurt, they need a solid backup. With the way Sabathia's throwing lately—2.17 ERA in his last five starts—he's not a bad choice. Neither, of course, is Severino, to at least throw a few innings even though he's starting Saturday in Baltimore. \nIt's a fair bet that reliever/starter/everything Adam Warren will also be relied on—he's already stretched out and can throw multiple innings. \nAny of those relievers on the chopping block? \nChasen Shreve still needs resuscitating —he has a 13.50 ERA in his last eight games. He may not make it, but Girardi said he's going to pitch Shreve this weekend in Baltimore to see if he can get straight. \n\"He's been through a tough month, a really tough month,\" Girardi said. \"And it's a kid that this is really his first full season up here and there are ups and downs. And we want to try to get him through it.\" \nWhat's the Twitter-length summation? \nThree starters, probably. All the usual suspects in the lineup, plus Noel, and maybe another guy to pinch run or two. The rest relievers. \nThe game itself \nThe Wild Card game is scheduled for 8:05 p.m. Tuesday night set to be broadcast on ESPN. \nRyan Hatch may be reached at rhatch@njadvancemedia.com .
