The Browns have proven it ain't over till after it's over.\nWhich, to get specific, means when it's over without a stupid penalty, followed by an untimed down, followed by a field goal attempt by the opposition that's the only dead-solid perfect thing anybody has done all day.\nWith the Browns, the final gun isn't final. The scoreboard totals are not correct.\nYou've heard of heroics in the 11 th hour. Now try \"anti-heroics,\" for want of a better word, in the 13th hour.\nThe Lateful Dead\nThe Browns are a terrible twist on 1980's Kardiac Kids, who in their own way set the precedent for a string of almosts in the 1980s, from their own Red Right 88 through the Drive and the Fumble.\nThe Kardiacs, though, won more than they lost in the last seconds, otherwise they have been called the Lateful Dead, maybe.\nSince the Browns returned in 1999, it's been a case of the morgue things change, the morgue they stay the same. It's hard to say categorically that the Browns have been unlucky.\nUn-good? Absolutely.\nWhat silver linings?\nIn the movie, \"Silver Linings Playbook\" Robert DeNiro engages in an obsessive-compulsive series of superstitions, designed to bring good luck as a long-suffering Philadelphia Eagles fan.\nHah! The Eagles! Clevelanders scoff at the Eagles. The Eagles have been in two Super Bowls. They lost both.\nThe Browns have been to none.\nThe Eagles have Chip Kelly, a snarky, but intriguing coach, who helped change the face of college football at Oregon with his theories of fast tempo and stretching defenses into a thin line that can snap like a rubber band.\n\"The big play has been our Achilles heel,\" said coach Mike Pettine on Monday.\nThe Browns have the rubber band.\nMore in Motown too\nOnly the Detroit Lions can say they have been in the NFL as long without once playing in the big game. As late as 2008, they went 0-16. Then the clue bus drove up, and the Lions got on board. Since 2008, the Lions have made the playoffs twice.\nThe Lions have a pretty good young quarterback in Matthew Stafford. The Browns don't, unless he's sitting on the bench.\nThe Lions have a receiver in Calvin Johnson with the size and speed to earn the nickname of Megatron, a fantasy figure from in \"Transformers\" franchise.\nThe Browns had Braylon Edwards, who became Edwards Scissorhands. They had Kellen Winslow, who rode a motorcycle called a \" crotch rocket\" in to the PUP (Physically Unable to Perform) list. They had Josh Gordon, their Megatron in training, who was a toke (or dozen) over the line.\nThere's no \"D\" in Pettine or Browns\nThe Browns are 1-3 in the \"soft\" part of their schedule, with the \"1\" belonging to bench-bound Johnny Manziel.\nUnlike Chip Kelly, Pettine isn't the coach for surprise and innovation. For some time now, he has looked as if he's not even the coach for defensive competence, the quality for which he was hired.\n\"We're not going to do anything wholesale. We know we're close. We've got to coach better and play better,\" said Pettine.\nThe \"Yogi\" winners in perpetuity\nThe Browns have pretty much clinched the \"Yogi\" for late and unbelievable losses with the Dwayne Rudd Helmet Throw , the Offside , the Plastic Bottles , the Drop , Da Bears' two TDs in the last 28 seconds, the Great QB Coin Flip , and most of all the Daft Drafts .\nAs culpable as Pettine is, general manager Ray Farmer, returning to work on Monday after a four-game \"timeout\" for texting team personnel during games, is responsible for the \"talent\" acquisition in the draft (see: Justin Gilbert) and free agency (see: Dwayne Bowe).\nFTL, FTL, FTL\nTexting has its own language, often reduced to acronyms. Which ones would you text to Farmer, in tribute to his handiwork?\nOMG (oh, my God).\nFTL (for the loss).\nLOL (Laughing out loud).\nROTFLMAO (LOL on PEDs, or rolling on the floor laughing my \"assets\" off).\nSMH (shaking my head).\nWTH (what the hell).\nNAGI (not a good idea).\nSSDD (same stuff, different day).\nSo many options. So few of them wrong.", "external_links": ["http://www.cantonrep.com/article/20091018/NEWS/310189884", "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/09000d5d8015a5b6/article/browns-to-flip-coin-to-decide-starting-qb", "http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=211104003", "http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/09/sports/sp-penner9", "http://hardfoulsports.com/2015/09/17/by-the-numbers-bad-drafts-holding-browns-back/", "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1014770-detroit-lions-how-0-16-season-saved-lions-franchise", "http://www.newsnet5.com/news/news-archives/video-vault-field-level-view-of-2001-cleveland-browns-bottlegate", "http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2064702"], "published": "2015-10-06T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:38:56.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
