(Matt Dunham/AP) \nThe future was now on Sunday for the NFL, which opted to exclusively stream the Buffalo Bills-Jacksonville Jaguars game from London on Yahoo and, judging by reactions, fans aren’t really ready for the future. \nIt was offered for free, but fans weren’t thrilled. Perhaps they’ve gotten their fill of Jags games from London or perhaps it had something to do with the quality, using the term loosely, of the game. They just weren’t “buying” the game, which kicked off at 9:30 a.m. EDT (and was available over the air in Buffalo and Jacksonville). Hey @NFL pls don't make me ever watch another game via Yahoo live stream. \n— Parker Miles (@p4miles) October 25, 2015 Note to self: If the @NFL ever puts a @Patriots game on @Yahoo , go to the game so you don't have to deal with the broadcast. \n— Matt Ruggiero (@MSRuggiero) October 25, 2015 No, NFL. I don't want to stream a game on yahoo. I want to watch it on my tv. Come on. \n— Taylor Aynes (@tayay15) October 25, 2015 At the airport bar hoping to catch #JagsVsBills but no, only streaming on @Yahoo . Great idea @NFL , really glad I can consume your product. \n— Ryan (@RyanSDoyle) October 25, 2015 \nBusiness Insider sports editor Cork Gaines, who Zapruders way more sports than the average person, found the quality lacking , with issues that many were having. \nAs somebody who consumes a lot of sports and often streams several games at once, this was one of the worst live streams I have seen in a long time. \nWhile I didn’t expect perfection in Yahoo’s first attempt at an NFL live stream, there were far too many instances of the screen going blurry. \nThe more common problem was the stream freezing and jumping, something that happened every few plays for me. \nOf course, that did help viewers miss some of E.J. Manuel’s performance — including a streak in which he had three consecutive turnovers. \nThe NFL raked in $20 million for the chance to show what felt like both a preseason game and broadcast dud on Yahoo and it was a hard sell from the start, with Yahoo finally signing on all 30 advertisers when it dropped asking prices from around $200,000 to $50,000 for a 30-second spot recently. \nAfter spending most of her career in traditional print sports journalism, Cindy began blogging and tweeting, first as NFL/Redskins editor, and, since August 2010, at The Early Lead.
