Here are a collection of the series' standout performances----throughout a game, or even in a crucial moment of a win.\n(Steve Svekis) McDermott saw an increase in minutes against FSU, while Brown could see more against the Hokies.\n\"It gives us more combinations and again, I think we fought hard. We need to do a better job in the running game, but we fought hard,\" Golden said. \"We only gave up two sacks in 49 pass attempts. … you're going to get quarterback hurries and things of that nature, and there's a lot of things we need to improve, but the effort was there. … there's some good things and then there's some things we need to correct, which were pretty evident.\"\n•Golden said receiver Stacy Coley , who hurt his hip after an acrobatic touchdown catch in the fourth quarter, was doing \"great\" and he doesn't expect the injury to become a long-term issue.\nHighlights of the the Miami Hurricanes at Florida State Seminoles at Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee, Fla., Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015, from Sentinel staff photographers Stephen M. Dowell and Joe Burbank.\nGolden also said the team will be cautious with defensive tackle Kendrick Norton (ankle sprain) and center Nick Linder (strained trapezius muscle) this week.\nNext game: Miami vs. Virginia Tech, 3:30 p.m. Saturday, ESPNU\n Miami Hurricanes", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-546791d9/turbine/sfl-miami-hurricanes-fsu-great-performances-20-003", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561b0da5/turbine/fl-miami-hurricanes-news-1012-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619f64e/turbine/os-pictures-florida-state-vs-miami-20151009-053", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619f649/turbine/os-pictures-florida-state-vs-miami-20151009-055", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-546793e9/turbine/sfl-miami-hurricanes-fsu-great-performances-20141115", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5619ee14/turbine/os-pictures-florida-state-vs-miami-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-54679549/turbine/sfl-miami-hurricanes-fsu-great-performances-20-001"], "published": "2015-10-12T02:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:21:25.704+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
