WASHINGTON — Hillary Clinton is unrolling a series of proposals on Monday to tighten national gun laws following the latest mass shooting in Oregon.\n“If anything else were killing 33,000 of our people, we would come together,” she said during a Monday morning town hall hosted by the Today Show in New Hampshire, promising to “keep track of people who shouldn't have guns.”\nThe move by Democratic presidential candidate indicates she plans to lean hard into pushing new gun regulations as part of her campaign platform. Gun control is one of the few issues on which Clinton is to the left of surging Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders — and it could help her with base voters.\nClinton's proposals include plans to tighten gun show and internet sales loopholes, which that allow some people to buy guns without background checks, by using executive orders if Congress won't act.\nShe also will push Congress to close what her campaign is calling the “Charleston loophole,” which allows gun sales to proceed without a background check if the check isn't completed in three days, and she's backing legislation expanding prohibitions on domestic abusers from buying and possessing guns. Current laws cover husbands but not unmarried significant others who are abusive, or convicted stalkers.\nClinton plans to highlight her support for repealing a law that prevents people from suing negligent gun manufacturers if their products are used in crimes. Sanders was one of the few Democrats who voted for that law when it passed a decade ago.\n“It is past time to repeal this law and hold the gun industry accountable just like everyone else. Hillary voted against this law in 2005 and will lead the charge to repeal it as president,” said a Clinton campaign aide.\nClinton has already called to expand the federal background check system and reinstate the ban on assault weapons that her husband originally pushed through Congress, but which expired under President George W. Bush.\nJulie Jacobson/AP Clinton’s proposals for stricter gun laws will include tightening gun show and internet sales loopholes, which allow some people to buy guns without background checks. Clinton didn't explicitly contrast her gun views to Sanders’ during the Today appearance, and demurred when asked by a voter to compare herself to the Vermont senator. But she made a point to contrast her plan for debt-free college to Sanders’ plan to give everyone free college at public schools.\n“I am not in favor of making college free for Donald Trump's kids,” she said.\nClinton said it “hurts my feelings” when asked about her struggles to connect to some voters, while admitting that “I am a more reserved person than maybe some in politics are.”\nAnd she grew heated while talking about the House Benghazi Committee, accusing them of playing politics with the deaths of four Americans and alluding to House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy's recent comments that the committee's investigation had helped drag down her poll numbers.\n“Look at the situation they chose to exploit to go after me for political reasons: The death of four Americans in Benghazi,” she said. “This committee was set up, as they have admitted, for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans. And if I were president and there were Republicans or Democrats thinking of that I would have done everything I could to shut it down.”\nThe new proposals come days after Clinton let loose on the National Rifle Association and Republicans for obstructing gun control measures.\n“What is wrong with us, that we can't stand up to the NRA and the gun lobby, and the gun manufacturers they represent?” she said at a Friday campaign stop less than a day after a young man opened fire in an Oregon community college, killing nine innocent people. “There are a lot of ways to have constitutional, legal gun restrictions. My husband did it. He passed the Brady bill, and he eliminated assault weapons for 10 years. So we're going to take them on.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:06:26.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
