The plate was connected to an open kidnapping case out of Texas, he said, and the driver, later identified as Van Mai Quang, 33, sped away and pulled into a driveway.\nQuang was discovered to have a felony arrest warrant in Texas and is on Texas’ 10 most wanted list, Duran said.\n“Officers pursued the individual, and at one point he gained access to a residential roof top by an unknown means,” hesaid. “The male continued to flee by jumping from roof top to roof top as officers continued to keep him in their sights.”\nOfficers set up a perimeter and were able to take Quang into custody. The victims of the alleged kidnapping, a woman and her children, were found safe in a local shelter, Duran said. The woman told police she and her children left Texas with Quang in order to get away from her family. A family member had reported them as missing or kidnapped.\nQuang was booked into the Metropolitan Detention center. He will be extradited back to Texas on a felony warrant, Duran said.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Quang-Van-Mai-175x142.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:26:14.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
