It's all about the salary cap. In today's day and age, you have $143 million and you have to divide it 53 ways.'\"\nEAGLES: Zach Ertz paving the way for DeMarco Murray, Ryan Mathews\nIf Michaels got it right, Kelly's account of the trade runs counter to numerous reports about what sparked the conversation with Buffalo Bills head coach Rex Ryan that led to McCoy being swapped for Alonso.\nHere's how Ryan described the trade talks via Jenny Vrentas of the Monday Morning Quarterback :\n\"Confidence rose higher on the third day of the retreat. The group had just wrapped meetings and were on the back deck, drinking cabernet and smoking cigars, when Whaley's phone rang. \"Any interest in LeSean McCoy?\" a representative from the Eagles asked. Philadelphia was looking for draft picks, and without a 2015 first-rounder the Bills didn't have much ammo to make an offer. But Whaley told the Eagles rep, \"Just do me a favor and look at our roster.\" The Eagles called back and told him, \"Kiko Alonso.\" The straight-up deal — Alonso, a promising young linebacker who missed '14 with an ACL tear, for McCoy, a two-time All-Pro running back — took 30 minutes, start to finish. \"I'm not a red wine guy,\" Ryan says, \"but that day I drank red wine.\" Whaley is Bills' general manager Doug Whaley.\nSo, after hearing the Bills' account and Kelly's account of the trade via Michaels, whose story do you believe?
