We told him and his attorney time after time after time, ‘Just tell the truth. We’re not looking to set you up here. Just come in and tell the truth.’ And he didn’t do it.’’\nNovitzky said he was “a little disappointed’’ that the Bonds’ conviction was overturned.\n“But ultimately, I’m asked, ‘Hey, was it all a waste of time?’ I don’t think it was,’’ Novitzky said, adding that federal agents use it as an example to keep other witnesses from lying. “It transcends any steroids thing. …That helps the entire system. Because if it witnesses don’t tell the truth, the whole system breaks down.’’\nHe also dismissed speculation that the case cost millions of dollars.\n“It wasn’t extensive,’’ he said. “It wasn’t like I spent six or seven years traveling the world talking about Barry Bonds.\n“When I was with the FDA, I carried a dozen to 15 cases at a time, equally dedicating time and investigative work to it. It wasn’t as if the Barry Bonds investigation was all we did. It was actually a very small portion and percentage of what I did over the years.’’\n3 CONNECT 19 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LtEYT0&text=Jeff%20Novitzky%20opens%20up%20on%20Barry%20Bonds%2C%20BALCO%20investigation&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803606821692463-AP-Bonds-Moves-On-Baseball.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6f62ce40edad92ea167c8db406eb584a0a030db3/c=76-0-1952-2501&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803606821692463-AP-Bonds-Moves-On-Baseball.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/822e7e287f11ca7c1a997d23ef2c317dec782567/c=969-0-4985-4016/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803622433024535-XXX-Jeff-Novitzky-dec-1087.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d98606874dee0af2ba66fdc7820517c7ed5031f6/r=324x400/local/-/media/2015/10/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/635803606821692463-AP-Bonds-Moves-On-Baseball.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LtEYT0&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-14T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:12:28.470+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
