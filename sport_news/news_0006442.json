Dinamo have lost just once in 48 games in all competitions, but handler of the side, Zoran Mamic says it will be difficult to come up against their opponents. \"We expect a very tough match against top quality opposition,\"Mamic told UEFA.com . \"We are looking forward to it, though, as we want to show our best and we want to win. The quality of opposition means we will not be able to play the same attacking football we normally do in our domestic league. \"We respect Olympiacos and are aware of their strengths, but football is not predictable. \"It was not such a surprise that Olympiacos beat Arsenal in their last game -they play in the Champions League every year and are doing a great job. \"We know how we want to play which is similar to how we did when beat Arsenal, but having an idea and being able to execute it are two different things. Olympiacos head into the game on the back of a comfortable 4-0 derby win against AEK Athens last weekend and are also unbeaten in their last seven games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T21:33:11.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
