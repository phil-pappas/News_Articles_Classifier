He's also forced and recovered a fumble. \nPanthers coach Ron Rivera said Norman is \"on his way\" to living up to his claim of being one of the game's elite cornerbacks. \nNorman hasn't backed off his comments, adding Thursday that, \"I'm not going down, I'm only going to continue to get better and go up higher.\" \nHe climbed the ladder on Sunday. \nNorman's leaping interception in the end zone as he was falling backward against Luke McCown on Sunday turned some heads around the country. \nIt turns out Norman made almost the same catch in a recent practice against Cam Newton. \nNewton said that play left him angry at the time, but now he's glad it happened. \n\"I think it is safe to say that I gave him his preparation for (Luke) McCown trying to throw the fade to him,\" Newton joked. \"It is incredible to see practice carry over to the game.\" \nSaid Rivera: \"He practices the way he plays.\" \nRivera said Norman's strength is his outstanding vision, which allows him to pick up where the ball is quickly. It helps too that he has great leaping ability, long arms and outstanding hands for a cornerback. \nWhile a freelancer of sorts earlier in his NFL career — something that cost him his starting job early in 2013 — Norman has learned to play within defensive coordinator Sean McDermott's system. \nWell, for the most part. \nThere are still times he's out of position, but his aggressiveness and natural ball-hawking skills are something the Panthers don't want to deter. \nMcDermott has grown so confident in Norman that he's matched him up against the opposition's top wide receiver in the first three games of the season. \nThis Sunday Norman will likely go head-to-head with Mike Evans, who was targeted 17 times last week by rookie quarterback Jameis Winston. \n\"He's done some nice things,\" Rivera said. \"He still makes some mistakes — and elites do — but he's headed in that direction.\" \nNorman's success couldn't come at a better time for his career. \nHe's in his contract year with the Panthers and setting himself up for a huge pay day next February when he becomes an unrestricted free agent. \nThe Panthers thought about re-signing Norman this past offseason, but had other priorities that included doling out big contract extensions to quarterback Cam Newton, linebackers Luke Kuechly and Thomas Davis, and tight end Greg Olsen. \n\"I pretty much don't even care about it,\" Norman said of his next contract. \"All I care about is winning games and being the best I can be on the field at that time and in that moment. Whenever it happens, it happens.\" \nNorman, 27, was excused from practice Thursday for what coach Ron Rivera deemed a \"personal day.\" He arrived in time for the open locker room session wearing street clothes and is expected to play Sunday. \nNorman acknowledged he was a little bitter after he didn't get NFC Player of the Week honors in the season opener, so he was excited about being recognized for his play for the month. \n\"I guess it worked out in my favor,\" Norman said with a laugh. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:04:28.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
