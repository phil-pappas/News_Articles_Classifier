His last game with Miami was a 58-0 loss to then-No. 6 Clemson, a result that had fans booing from the stands and calling for his departure — as many angrily had for some time. \nMiami (4-3, 1-2) plays at Duke on Saturday night. The Hurricanes are scheduled to resume practice Tuesday. \nJames said he would begin a search for the next coach “in due time,” adding that he thought Golden “has led our program through some very difficult times and he has done so with class, integrity and a true desire to see our students succeed on the field, in the classroom and in the community.” \nGolden did not return a call seeking comment. \nGolden, who played for Joe Paterno at Penn State, is 59-59 in parts of 10 seasons as a head coach. He helped revitalize Temple’s program in his first opportunity as a head coach, then replaced Randy Shannon at Miami. The Hurricanes climbed to No. 7 in the AP Top 25 for a stretch in 2013, but have not finished a season in the national rankings since the 2009 campaign. \n“He helped us weather a challenging time early in his tenure and he has always acted with class and integrity,” Stuart Miller, the chair of Miami’s board of trustees, said to other trustees Sunday night in an email obtained by The Associated Press. “We have many off-the-field achievements to be proud of.” \nOn the field, that was a different story. \nGolden was hired in December 2010. Before he coached a single game with the Hurricanes, Miami was hit with a massive NCAA investigation sparked by the actions of a former booster who was associated with the school long before Golden’s arrival. The school forfeited two bowl trips because of that probe as well as what would have been a trip to the 2012 ACC championship game. \nMiami is still dealing with the effects of that scandal. This year’s team had 80 scholarship players, five fewer than the maximum allowed — and that was to be the last step, Golden hoped, in finally escaping all the sanctions that Miami was handed by the NCAA in response to the extra benefits provided by convicted and currently imprisoned Ponzi scheme architect Nevin Shapiro as well as other rule-breaking inside the department. \nWhen the Hurricanes get back to 85 scholarships, it will be under a new coach. \nFormer Miami kicker Matt Goudis said on Twitter that Scott is well-respected by players. \n“Excited to see what he can do,” Goudis said. \nMiami won the last of its five national championships in 2001, hasn’t appeared in what was once called the BCS bowls — the Orange, Fiesta, Sugar and Rose — since 2003. They have yet to win the ACC since joining in 2004 and haven’t even won a bowl game since 2006, the last night of Larry Coker’s regime with the Hurricanes. 46 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1S4TDoR TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:44:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:27:48.131+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
