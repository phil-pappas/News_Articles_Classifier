Subban and Max Pacioretty each had a goal and an assist as the Montreal Canadiens beat the Toronto Maple Leafs 5-3 on Saturday night to extend their season-opening winning streak to nine games.\nThe Canadiens are a victory away from tying the NHL record set by the Maple Leafs in 1993-94 and matched by Buffalo in 2006-07.\nLars Eller , David Desharnais and Brendan Gallagher also scored for Montreal, which has won every game in regulation time.\nLeo Komarov , James van Riemsdyk and Morgan Reilly scored for Toronto, which is winless in its last three games.\nThe Canadiens were outworked for most of the game by the Leafs, who had a season-high 52 shots and were the first team this season to score more than two goals against Carey Price . Montreal had 27 shots on a shaky Jonathan Bernier .\nReilly and Dion Phaneuf hit goalposts, but it was the Canadiens who emerged with a 1-0 lead after the first period as Bernier was unable to hang onto Subban's hard shot from the top of the right circle on a power play at 10:53. It was Subban's first goal of the season.\nToronto had a 23-11 shots advantage in the second but fell behind 5-2.\nAlex Galchenyuk drove to the net and his rebound was banged in by Eller 1:54 into the second period.\nKomarov got it back at 2:37 from in front to score after van Riemsdyk deflected Scott Harrison 's point shot off Price.\nDesharnais saw his pass on the rush up the right side go in off Michael Grabner 's skate at 4:24 but then van Riemsdyk got it back at 6:36, knocking in the rebound of Phaneuf's shot off the end boards after keeping Montreal penned in its zone for a long stretch.\nPacioretty broke down the left side and beat Bernier between the pads short-handed with 4 1/2 minutes left in the period and Gallagher tipped Subban's shot in from the edge of the crease on a power play with 14 seconds to go.\nReilly scored 7:11 into the third when he picked the far corner with a shot on the off-wing on a rush.\nNOTES: Byron Froese , recalled Friday from the Toronto Marlies, centered the fourth line for the Maple Leafs in his first NHL game. ... The Leafs placed forward Tyler Bozak (lower body) and defenseman Jake Gardiner (undisclosed) on the injured list this week. ... A moment of silence was observed before the game for former Canadien player Jimmy Roberts , who died this week at age 75.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:31:39.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
