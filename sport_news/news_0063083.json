Kareem Green, 22, was found guilty of attempted kidnapping, aggravated battery, unlawful restraint and misdemeanor battery at the conclusion of a bench trial Aug. 14. Green also must register as a violent offender for 10 years after his release. Prosecutors said Green grabbed a 17-year-old girl from behind and attempted to carry her away as she was walking home from Bolingbrook High School on the afternoon of Jan. 29, 2013. A passing driver stopped his vehicle to help the victim and frightened off the attacker, who fled in a dark Ford Explorer. The witness, who testified at trial, provided a description of the suspect and his vehicle but could not get a license plate number. Two days later, on Jan. 31. 2013, Green followed a 16-year-old girl as she walked into her girlfriend's Bolingbrook apartment building after school. Prosecutors said Green grabbed her in the hallway and attempted to cover her mouth, but she struck him with her elbow and began to scream for help and he fled. Green was identified through a Bolingbrook police search of vehicle records. Detectives eventually identified Green as a suspect, and he was later picked out of a photo lineup by all three witnesses. \"A dangerous man has been taken off our streets because of two brave girls who refused to become victims, a courageous Good Samaritan who refused to look the other way, and dogged police work by detectives who refused to let their community become the hunting grounds for a predator,\" Will County State's Attorney Glasgow said in a written statement. \"My two prosecutors ... took this case to heart and did an excellent job presenting evidence at trial and placing Kareem Green behind bars where he belongs.\" Green must serve half of the sentence before being eligible for parole.
