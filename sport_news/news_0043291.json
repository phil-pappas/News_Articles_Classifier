Haden also hurt his ribs but was able to practice on a limited basis all week and was down as probable — a 75 percent chance of playing — on the week's final injury report.\nHowever, after testing his hand during a pregame workout, Haden decided not to play. Browns coach Mike Pettine said Monday that \"we left it up to Joe, and he made the decision that he didn't want to go.\"\nA league spokesman says it's customary to check with teams when these instances occur. The Browns are required to submit a written explanation for Haden's absence.\n___\nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/AP_NFL"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:16:16.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
