A 17-year-old male also sustained non-life-threatening injuries during the incident.\nThe shooting occurred just after 4 p.m. in the 1300 block of Annette Street.\nWhen officers arrived, they found Johnson in the street with multiple gunshot wounds to the body. Minutes later, police located the 17-year-old, who had been shot in the side, at Claiborne Avenue and Laharpe Street. Both victims were taken to the hospital, where Johnson later died.\nDuring the course of the investigation, ProjectNola provided Detective Debra Normand with surveillance footage of four men who were in the area during the shooting. Police say the men are not suspects, but may have information about the shooting.\nNormand is in charge of the investigation and can be reached at (504) 658-5300.\nCitizens with information that can help solve this crime are asked to call Crimestoppers at 822-1111 or toll-free 1-877-903-STOP. You could receive a cash reward of up to $2,500 for the information leading only to the arrest, except on homicides, where Crimestoppers will pay half of the reward upon the arrest and half on the indictment of the responsible person(s).
