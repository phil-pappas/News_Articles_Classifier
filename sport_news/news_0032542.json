It got real chippy out there on the football field and I thought we got distracted. We had five penalties in the first half, two of which were personal fouls. \n“At halftime we challenged our guys to play to our standard, play to our level. We wanted our guys to remember how hard we play and our guys did an outstanding job of that in the second half.” \nAfter the halftime discussion about it, his players righted what little mistakes they made en route to their second win of the season. \n“We’ve been a pretty good defensive bunch all year. I think we gave up three first downs all night,” Budke said. “We had some young guys in there and they played with a lot of pride, that’s good to see.” \nChase County improved to 2-4 on the season and 1-1 in district play. The Bulldogs host Mission Valley next Friday. \nChase County 14 13 12 7 — 46 \nHerington 0 0 0 0 — 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:07:31.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
