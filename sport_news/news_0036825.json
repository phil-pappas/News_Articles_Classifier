(Photo: Jess Grimm/Eagle-Gazette) 20 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLANCASTER — It wasn't easy, but Fisher Catholic remained in the playoff hunt, as well the Mid-State League-Cardinal Division race. \nAllen McCall scored on a 1-yard touchdown run to give the Irish a 14-7 overtime victory over Fairfield Christian on Friday at Fulton Field. \nThe Irish -- who won for the sixth consecutive time after opening the season with a pair of losses -- improved to 6-2 overall and 5-0 in the MSL-Cardinal. It sets up a huge showdown next Friday against Harvest Prep (6-2, 4-0). \nAn Irish win and they would clinch the league title outright, as well as move closer to a playoff spot. \nHowever, they were in the fight against the Knights, who played outstanding defense the entire game. \n“Both teams played lights out and laid it all on the field, and I’m sure there was probably nothing left for either side at the end,” Fisher Catholic coach Mike Yonnotti said. “We found a way to come through at the end. But both teams were exceptional.” \nMcCall gave the Irish the lead by scoring on a 3-yard touchdown run with 10:45 left in the first half, but the Knights (3-5, 2-3) responded 20 seconds later when Josh Heeter scored on a 53-yard touchdown run with 10:25 left. \nOther than that, Fairfield Christian held the Irish, who had to overcome losing senior quarterback Jared Faulkner being knocked out of the game with a leg injury early in the third quarter. \n“We played as well defensively as I’ve ever had a team play in all my years of coaching,” Fairfield Christian coach B.J. Queen said. “The bad news is we fumbled twice in the first half and it put us in bad field position and allowed them to score. \n“We just weren’t consistent enough on offense in the second half to get that second score. Fisher Catholic gained the momentum and did nice job of playing smash-mouth football in overtime.” \nThe Irish had the first in overtime, and they went right to work. McCall gained four yards on first down and Hayden Muckensturm took it the 4-yard line with a 12-run. McCall carried the next three times from the 4-yard line and cashed in from the one. \nFisher Catholic’s defense took over when the Knights had their chance to score in overtime, holding the Knights to minus two yards on two runs, an incompletion, and then Davonte Herron and Muckensturm sacked Fairfield Christian quarterback Caleb Laubenthal on fourth down to end the game. \nBoth defenses came up with huge fourth-down stops throughout the second half. \nFor the game, the Irish held the Knights to only 104 total yards, including 32 in the second half. \n“We really stress defense and we have been playing well all year,” Yonnotti said. “Once we got the score in overtime, we knew we had to step up and keep them out of the end zone.” \nThe Irish finished with 283 total yards, with 235 of those coming on the ground. Muckensturm finished with 81 yards on 13 carries and McCall added 60 yards on 16 carries. Herron rushed for 29 yards and had three catches for 40 yards. \nHeeter led the Knights with 82 yards on 14 carries. \ntwilson@lancastereaglegazette.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:06:01.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
