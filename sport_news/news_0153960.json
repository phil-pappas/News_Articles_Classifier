(AP) - Two DeSoto County high schools, both in Southaven, are getting electronic video message boards that supporters say will generate advertising revenue to benefit the schools as well as provide public services such as Amber Alerts.\nThe Commercial Appeal reports ( http://bit.ly/1QdlwtH ) Southaven aldermen approved the message boards last week for Southaven and DeSoto Central high schools. They approved a larger sign for Southaven High because of the school's location along Interstate 55, where planners said a bigger and taller sign was needed to be readable by high-speed traffic. Also, the Southaven property sits below road level.\nThe Planning staff recommendation on the signs says they \"would allow for advertisement of school events, Amber Alerts, weather warnings and other public safety/involvement events.\nInformation from: The Commercial Appeal, http://www.commercialappeal.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
