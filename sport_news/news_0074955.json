The Bills (3-4) were playing in the British capital for the first time. \nEJ Manuel started at quarterback for the Bills for the second straight game in the absence of the injured Tyrod Taylor. \nManuel’s early struggles allowed Jacksonville to take a big lead, but Manuel led the rally until the Jaguars took the lead for good in the final minutes.
