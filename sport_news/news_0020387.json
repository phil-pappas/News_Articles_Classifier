(AP) — Former major league baseball player Chad Curtis has told a judge he’s down to $39 and “nine noodles in my cell” as he defends himself in a civil lawsuit against young women who accuse him of sexual misconduct at a high school. \nCurtis is in prison for criminal sexual conduct at Lakewood High School in western Michigan, where he worked. Magistrate Judge Ellen Carmody urged Curtis to get an attorney to help him in a lawsuit. \nThe Grand Rapids Press (http://bit.ly/1PO2DQX ) says Curtis apologized Monday for a filing identifying the women by name. Curtis says he has “truth” on his side and can’t afford a lawyer. \nThe women want to move the case directly to financial damages, noting that Curtis already has been convicted. The conviction is being appealed. \n___ \nInformation from: The Grand Rapids Press, http://www.mlive.com/grand-rapids Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T23:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:51:24.479+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
