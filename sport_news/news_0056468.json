(Getty Images) By Michael Tunison \nNever put the most Cleveland outcome past the Browns. Just when you suspect they might stumble into competence, they'll find ways to surprise you with their mistakes, each more inexplicable than the last. \nThe Browns played a tightly contested game with San Diego, managing to tie the game late in the fourth quarter thanks to an incredible catch by tight end Gary Barnidge that led to a touchdown pass to Barnidge on the ensuing snap. This was followed by a two-point conversion on the team's first attempt of the season. Watch this as many times as you want.&#10;You still won&#39;t figure out how Gary Barnidge caught this ball. #CLEvsSD http://t.co/7cqBIpwjv1 &mdash; NFL (@NFL) October 4, 2015 \nGetting the ball back with slightly more than two minutes left in the game, the Chargers drove into Cleveland territory, setting up a game-winning 39-yard field goal. It being the day of much kicker tumult , the kick sailed wide. On to overtime! One problem: Tramon Williams, one of the Browns' free agent acquisitions this past offseason, jumped offside. That moved the Chargers five yards closer and, of course, gave them another shot, which kicker Josh Lambo naturally converted as the football gods hold the Browns in extreme contempt. \nIf it's any consolation -- and it probably isn't -- the Browns enjoyed a banner Josh McCown performance. The Browns starter passed for 356 yards and two touchdowns. So he'll likely hold off Johnny Manziel for another week while the team continues to lose.
