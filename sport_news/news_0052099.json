KING — State Journal \nUW fullback Derek Watt has 23 career receptions, including this one Sept. 19 against Troy, for 232 yards and one touchdown in 38 games. The fifth-year senior totals four carries for 15 yards and no TDs. \nThe Cliff’s Notes version of what it’s like to play fullback might not sound appealing to some, a point Derek Watt acknowledged before offering an account drawn from years of personal experience. \n“You’re fortunate enough to get the ball in your hands once in a while. Other than that, it’s just kind of dirty work,” said Watt, a fifth-year senior on the University of Wisconsin football team. “You’ve got to put your hand in the dirt and run at guys as fast you can, and they’re going to be running at you. They know what you’re coming to do, and you know what they’re coming to do.” \nWatt smiled, knowing the sounds of collisions involving fullbacks will fill the air Saturday afternoon at Camp Randall Stadium when the No. 19 Badgers (3-1) host Iowa (4-0) in a Big Ten Conference opener. \nUW running backs coach John Settle calls fullbacks “a lost breed,” but that position will continue to be valued as long as Paul Chryst is the head coach. The same can be said at Iowa, where Kirk Ferentz is in his 17th season in charge of a program that, like its West Division border rival, is built on smash-mouth football. \n“Historically in my time here, and I bet you if you talked to Paul he’d say the same thing about his years at Wisconsin, it’s almost like they could all start their own club,” Ferentz said. “They’re so much alike. They’re great team guys. They’re all tough, hard-working guys who really enjoy the unselfish part of football — because there isn’t much glory being a fullback, for sure.” \nHidden gems \nFinding fullbacks on the recruiting trail can be somewhat challenging. \nBoth of Iowa’s fullbacks — fifth-year seniors Macon Plewa and Adam Cox — began their careers as walk-on linebackers. \nPlewa, a Wisconsin native whose grandfather, Donald VanderVelden, lettered for the Badgers in the early 1960s, occasionally played tight end in a spread offense at Franklin. \n“He’s just a tough kid who will never back down from anyone,” said Louis Brown, who coached Plewa at Franklin. “I think to play fullback at that level, those are the type of kids you need to have.” \nWatt rushed for 2,685 yards and 44 touchdowns in a Wing-T offense at Pewaukee. But, like Plewa and Cox, he began his college career as a linebacker. \nWhen redshirt sophomore Austin Ramesh committed to UW, he was told he might play fullback or linebacker. The offensive coaching staff eventually won the tug-of-war for Ramesh. \n“You keep looking for guys that fit the job description and guys that like football,” Chryst said, “and I think fullbacks find you as much as you find them.” \nBrown, who was Franklin’s defensive coordinator when Plewa was a senior and took over as head coach the following season, said it’s rare his team will face an opponent with a fullback. “It’s more of a speed game now,” he said. \nUW looks for linebackers who are athletic enough to catch the ball and block in space. Settle mentioned the possibility of recruiting undersized linemen who could be converted. \n“We’ll turn every rock over,” Settle said, “and do our best to find a guy that fits what we need.” \n‘The adjuster’ \nStatistics are a nearly impossible way to measure a fullback’s worth. \nPlewa has one rushing attempt for 3 yards this season, while Cox hasn’t registered a carry. Neither player has a reception. \nFerentz’s review of Plewa and Cox, however, is glowing. \n“They’re both playing really well,” he said. \nMeanwhile, Watt and Ramesh have yet to receive a carry this season, though both played a huge role in the Badgers’ 28-0 victory over Hawaii last week. \nUW used a two-fullback package on more than one-third of its snaps vs. the Rainbow Warriors. The production was significant: 29 rushes for 194 yards and two touchdowns. \nWatt is tied for fourth on the team with eight receptions. His 27-yard reception was UW’s longest play from scrimmage against Hawaii and set up a touchdown pass from Joel Stave to tight end Austin Traylor in the third quarter. \nThe name that kept coming up this week when coaches discussed the fullback position was former Richland Center athlete Bradie Ewing, who gave the Badgers a weapon at that spot from 2008-11. \nUW offensive coordinator Joe Rudolph praised Watt’s athleticism and brought up the possibility of true freshman Alec Ingold being a difference-maker at fullback down the road. Ingold began his career as a linebacker before being moved to tailback, but his best spot might end up being fullback. \n“It’s different when you’ve got a playmaker at that position,” Rudolph said. \nOf course, blocking will always be the main priority for UW fullbacks. It’s the first thing Watt mentioned when he was asked what the job description for the ideal fullback candidate at UW would be. \n“Hard-nosed, physical, just be willing to throw your body around,” said Watt, a four-year starter. “You’ve got to play fast and be able to adjust. \n“That’s a big thing in our offense, just being able to adjust. Coach Settle always tells us A & I — adjust and improvise. Things aren’t always going to be clean, you’re kind of the adjuster.” \nThose seeking fame need not apply, according to Watt. \n“Fullback’s not for everybody,” he said, “that’s for sure.” +2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:11:42.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
