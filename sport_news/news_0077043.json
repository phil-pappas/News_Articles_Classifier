And if you were to ask their recent opponents, they would likely to tell you that UTC is playing like one of the top teams in the country. Mocs coach Russ Huesman says his team is coming off their most complete game of the year in their 31-3 win over Furman. And he adds that UTC will continue to need that all around, solid effort to finish out the season. \"It doesn't take a poor performance on our part for somebody to beat us. If we don't play well, or really well, we'll get beat. I've told our guys that.\" The Mocs defense has been extra salty, allowing a total of three points in their last two games. Coach Huesman admits he doesn't do much to motivate them. \"I think probably ten minutes before the game or 15 minutes before the game, I'll walk up to Marcus (West) and say, get your boys jacked up bro.\" Said defensive back Lucas Webb-\"At the beginning of the season with some new guys, we knew we were talented. We just had to get in our groove. I think we've really been working towards that. That's one thing Coach Huesman has been talking about is getting our confidence and swagger back. I think we are on the right path to getting where we want to be.\" Mocs head to VMI this weekend. And playing on the campus of a military school is never easy. Huesman-\"When you come in, it's beautiful, but it is military looking places. I think that does have an intimidation factor in it.\" Said running back Derrick Craine-\"Cannons. When they score or do something really well, it's the loudest cannons I've ever heard. I know at the Citadel last year, the cannon went off. I had no idea what it was. I was sitting there wondering who got shot, and just what was going on. I was like man, this is crazy.\" A victory over VMI would give Chattanooga their 10th straight win over a SoCon opponent.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:10:51.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
