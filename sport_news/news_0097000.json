After blowing a victory last week on the road to the Bengals, the Seahawks find themselves in an early season, must win situation. Standing in their way, the undefeated Carolina Panthers, whom they host at Century Link this Sunday afternoon. \nCan they pull their record back to an even, 3-3? \nHere’s what I’ll be watching to have happen if the Seahawks are to return to the win column. Rawls had his best ever game last week but will sit with Lynch healthy again. Who Are The Panthers, Really? \nThe Carolina Panthers come in undefeated, led by their tall, strong, Super Man quarterback, Cam Newton. Are they really as good as their 4-0 record suggests? \nIn the NFL , a win is a win, and none are easy, but the four victories for the Panthers this year have come against the Jaguars, Texans, Saints, and Buccaneers. None of those four teams reached the playoffs last year. Only one of them had a winning record, the Texans at 9-7. Combined in 2014, those four teams finished with a record of 22-42. \nGiven those numbers, I think it’s fair to say the Panthers are not exactly what you think of as a prototypical undefeated team. To make matters worse for the Panthers, they have not beat the Seahawks since 2007 and they have never beat the Seahawks at home. The O-Line \nTo say the offensive line of the Seahawks has been bad this year is a bit of an understatement. As bad as they have been, I thought they played much better last week against the Bengals, despite the loss. Rookie running back Thomas Rawls rushed for 169 yards and averaged better than three yards per carry before be touched by a defender. To put that number in perspective, prior to the Bengals game, the Seahawks runners averaged just 1 yard per carry before contact. Can the Seahawks find a way to get the ball downfield to Graham? \nClearly, the O-line was ripping open some good holes for Rawls last week. They need to build on that performance. With Marshawn Lynch back in the lineup this week and if the O-line can repeat that kind of performance, the Seahawks will dominate the ground game. Jimmy Graham \nThe Seahawks are still struggling, outside of the game against Chicago, to get the ball to their newest offensive weapon, Jimmy Graham . Even when they have managed to get the ball in Graham’s hands, the results have been mediocre at best. Typically, Graham has received the ball when he lines up split wide and catches the ball on a quick out route. \nOffensive Coordinator, Darrell Bevell, has to do a better job and get more creative with Graham. Personally, I’m dying to see Graham run down the field on a seam route for a touchdown. Who’s with me? Defense \nNo more meltdowns—that’s the easy way to write up what the Seahawks need to do better defensively. After leading 24-7 in the fourth quarter last week, the defense got soft and allowed the Bengals to tie the game, then win it in overtime. That just can’t happen. \n  has struggled with communication and coverage switch offs at times. We saw it on the Bengals first offensive possession and then a whole bunch more in the fourth quarter. When the Seahawks had their defense working, it was dominant, just like the days gone by. They were forcing three and outs, stuffing the run, and taking the ball away. \nThe absence of Bobby Wagner is going to hurt the Seahawks effort in this area, especially with communication. Let’s not forget that the Seahawks lost all but one game when Wagner was out due to injury last year. Sunday, it’s going to be up to Brock Coyle to fill some very big shoes. Prediction \nThe Seahawks aren’t healthy defensively, they are inconsistent on both sides of the ball and have yet to figure out how to best utilize one of their best new weapons. Still, the Seahawks will come up with a win at home over the Panthers who are merely masquerading as a great team. \nThe Seahawks pull back even at 3-3 Sunday afternoon with a victory, 31-20, over the Panthers.
