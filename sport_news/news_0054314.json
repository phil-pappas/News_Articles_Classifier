Chavez Boulevard when a newer black SUV pulled up next to her and the driver asked her for directions to All Saints School.\nAs she answered, she saw him masturbating, Portland Police Bureau spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson wrote in a news release. She walked away and he drove off, eastbound on Royal Court. Officers responded to the scene at 5:25 p.m. Friday, but did not find the suspect.\n\"At this point, police are not aware of any additional incidents of a similar nature,\" Simpson said.\nThe man is described as being in his 20s. He is 5 feet 8 inches tall, with a slim build and short messy hair.\nResidents in the area are being asked for any available surveillance footage that might have images of the man.\nAnyone who sees this man or witnesses similar behavior is advised to call 911. To submit information about the incident, call 503-823-3333 and reference case #15-360209.\nâ€” Nuran Alteir\nnalteir@oregonian.com\n503-294-4028\n@whatnuransaid", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m28!1m12!1m3!1d4652.17630442429!2d-122.62612738161904!3d45.52796419657839!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!4m13!3e6!4m5!1s0x5495a0c2d52caf45%3A0x119f39b6effd5d9d!2sNE+Royal+Ct%2C+Portland%2C+OR!3m2!1d45.5286879!2d-122.620955!4m5!1s0x5495a0c315e18695%3A0x1f3f6d564b692eb1!2sAll+Saints+School%2C+601+Northeast+Cesar+E+Chavez+Boulevard%2C+Portland%2C+OR+97232!3m2!1d45.527409399999996!2d-122.6233896!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sus!4v1445386108593", "http://twitter.com/whatnuransaid"], "published": "2015-10-21T01:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:19:07.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
