Gabriel Murta had apparently been kicked and punched by players on the Amantes de Bola team after they were upset about one of his calls. Murta, believed to be an off-duty police officer, responded by going to the dressing room and grabbing his gun. He then returned to the field and brandished the weapon before the other referee tried to restrain him and persuaded him to put the gun back in his locker.
