I would love to see universal health care in the U.S.\nBut I definitely do not agree that it is the duty of society to provide financial aid, food assistance or job training \"to enable those who want to bear and rear children to do so.\" I believe that sex education and birth control are readily available in this country. I believe that a person choosing to \"bear and rear\" one or more children should prepare mentally, emotionally and financially to take on that responsibility. How often do we see pleas for help from families that have been destitute for years but have many young children to support?\nPerhaps we could ask them to halt pregnancies at least until they are able to care for these children without constant and continuing public assistance.\nLynne Bowen\nDallas", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:16:27.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
