In his 23-minute presence, unstoppable Yi made 7 of his 9 attempts from the field including three thunderous dunks and four free throws before being benched for the remainder of the contest.\nChina continued their dominance in the second period by winning the same 29-14 to stretch the lead further to 27 points at the breather. As compared to the Indian cagers, China carried too many weapons, including those that came off the bench that contributed 22 points before the break.\nIndian cagers defended well after the change of ends as the low scoring third quarter saw China winning it 19-11. Continuing their attacking play China took the last period 29-18 to register a facile 46-point victory and seal the semifinal berth.\nIndia skipper Vishesh Bhriguvanshi, once again made his presence felt with a game-high score of 22 points and five assists as the other big men Amjyot Singh and Amrit Pal Singh failed to deliver against a closely guarded Chinese wall. Both the lanky Indian forwards netted as low as five identical points. With the Chinese keeping their focus mainly on the inform duo of Amjyot and Amrit, veteran Indian guard Yadwinder Singh added valuable 16 points and pulled 5 rebounds as others failed.\nHaving reached the quarterfinals after a 12-year wait, Indian players did earn the respect of their opponents and will now eye the 5th spot in Asia. In their classification games for the 5-8 places, India will take on Korea on Friday.\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T19:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:28:15.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
