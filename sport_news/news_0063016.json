All he can hear is his heart beating in his ears. Free falling on two wheels – time stops. Then the tires hit the dusty ground. Gravity defied.\nLifeProof is proud to welcome mountain bike star Cameron Zink as the newest member of the LifeProof athlete team. Zink will make his debut as a LifeProof athlete at the Red Bull Rampage, kicking off Oct. 15 in Virgin, Utah .\nZink is an elite athlete and icon in the world of freeride mountain biking and hails from the high desert of Reno, Nev. From landing a 100-foot backflip in 2014 to being voted for Best Rampage Moment for a 360 off the Oakley Sender, he embodies the LifeProof brand by defying what's possible on a mountain bike.\n\"Rampage is my favorite time of year, it never disappoints,\" said Zink. \"The 10th anniversary will be one of the best displays of mountain biking ever. We didn't have enough time to finish my line last year, but this year it is shaping up even better. I'm very stoked to have the support from LifeProof and all my other sponsors. Having extra battery and a protected phone is essential when you're digging for 12 hours a day!\"\nZink landed a first place win at the 2010 Red Bull Rampage, third place finish in 2013 and brought home the silver medal at the 2014 event after stunning the crowd with one of the largest 360 drops in the sport. LifeProof will be at Red Bull Rampage 2015 as an official sponsor. To cheer on Zink from afar during the event, follow LifeProof on social media.\nThe event will mark another debut for Zink and LifeProof. Filmmaker Ryan Cleek's \"Reach for the Sky\" will have a special showing for Rampage athletes and attendees on Friday Oct. 16 in Zion UT. The film, which recently premiered in Las Vegas , delves into Zink's career, ambitions, motivations and what's propelled him to the top of the sport.\nLifeProof is dedicated to defying logic with smartphone and tablet cases that can take mobile technology just about anywhere.
