The best part of the day itself is connecting fellow PGA Tour pros with the fans who watch them on television. Distributing the spoils of the day – which includes a clinic, dinner and silent auction – is the best part of his family’s efforts and his motivation for Monday’s Fourth Annual Ricky Barnes Charity Pro-Am at the Stockton Country Club. “The causes we give to, when they get to come out and speak, that’s what it’s all about,” Barnes said. “To see someone with so much emotion when they receive that money, it’s such high gratification to give it. The sum that you raised, to be able to disperse it, that’s where it really is.” The Ricky and Suzanne Barnes Foundation awarded more than $300,000 to local organizations after the first three years of the event. Barnes, who is ranked 303rd in the world, thinks the latest event could push the total raised to over half a million dollars. This year’s recipients are First Tee of San Joaquin, which provides golf equipment and opportunities for underprivileged children; the TLC School, an elementary program which provides mental and physical support for homeless children; the Morgan Amelia Foundation, which covers services not covered by insurance for children with Dravet Syndrome, a rare form of epilepsy; and S.T.A.R.S., the San Joaquin County Sheriff’s Team of Active Retired Seniors, a volunteer crime prevention program. There were 72 participants at Monday’s golf clinic and pro-am, many of whom were returning supporters. They received attention from 12 pros – Barnes, veterans Andres Gonzales, Colt Knost, Martin Laird, Jeff Overton, Greg Owen, Robert Streb and first-time attendees Graham DeLaet, Will Mackenzie, Carlos Ortiz, Chez Reavie and Justin Thomas. “The good thing about these guys showing up is they’re not doing it because they’re getting a lot out of it,” Barnes said of the pros. DeLaet said his involvement was an “easy decision” since he and his wife host a similar event in his home province of Saskatchewan, Canada. Attracting pros is a little harder up there, though. The Graham and Ruby DeLaet Foundation also supports the development of junior golfers and children’s health. DeLaet has nine top 10 finishes in two years on the PGA Tour. “I know how much it matters (to have pros attend),” DeLaet said. “None of us would be where we are without golf. I think we all see this as part of our job, to give back. It’s rewarding for us.” Don Miller, the executive director of First Tee of San Joaquin, said a “good chunk” of the program’s operating budget comes from the generosity of the Ricky and Suzanne Barnes Foundation - $50,000 to $70,000. Three junior participants from the same family were slated to speak at the dinner Monday evening. “We were scrambling for donors,” Miller said. “Before we were just trying to keep our doors open. This takes a little bit of pressure off and we were able to expand a little more. The money raised here helps fund our ‘golferships’ for financially-strapped families. We don’t want to turn away anybody. “We are so fortunate our local professional cares for First Tee. He practices core values. He couldn’t be a better example for our community. His heart is here locally, but he goes everywhere. I get reports from our other chapters across the country that he was at their events.\" The pro-am and dinner were staffed by friends and family members, including Suzanne (Stonebarger) Barnes, a former Linden resident and pro volleyball player. She had her hands full early with daughter Natalie, age 2, while Barnes’ mother Cathy prepared a breakfast burrito for grandson Brady, 4, between greeting guests and fielding questions from volunteers. Frank Stonebarger would support the event regardless of his family connection, but admitted he is biased since his niece is married to Barnes. Stonebarger is the chairman of American Ag Credit, which has been a major sponsor of the pro-am since it began, partly because the programs that benefit work to prevent childhood obesity. “Our bank lends to farmers and ranchers, so healthy food is what we’re about,” Stonebarger said. “This is a good opportunity to promote that. As a participant, this is an opportunity to play with some of the best players in the world. We all appreciate that.” There were appreciative murmers and exclamations when Justin Thomas used his driver to launch a long shot at the clinic. Each pro took turns displaying their “go-to” shots with Barnes handling host duties. When DeLaet stepped up, he playfully challenged his peers to see “who can hit the highest”. Mackenzie talked about the importance of staying balanced and Barnes provided tips on control and grip. When asked if anyone had questions, one gentleman asked if Thomas could hit again. The request was met with laughter. To be added to the Ricky and Suzanne Barnes Foundation newsletter, which includes information about the annual pro-am, send a request to info@rickybarnesgolf.com.
