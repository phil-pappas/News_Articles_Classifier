Things have been tough for first-year Head Coach Mike Pieroni as his Lady Panthers have had some issues putting the ball into the net this season. They were shut out six times over their first 11 games, losing all of those games except for a scoreless tie with Middleboro. Those two teams met again last Thursday and the Panthers offense exploded for a 6-0 win over the Sachems. They kept the momentum rolling Saturday by holding Scituate to a scoreless tie. Plymouth South was busy this week with games against Quincy, Pembroke and then Hanover. They took a 1-0 win over Quincy Tuesday for their second victory of the season. They'll finish the regular season with two games on the road this week. South travels to Plymouth North for a 7 p.m. game Tuesday and they'll then travel to Hanover Thursday for a 6:30 p.m. contest to close out the year.
