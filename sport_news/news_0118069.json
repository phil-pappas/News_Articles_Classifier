The Tigers back totaled 180 yards and two touchdowns on 31 carries. \nSome of the surprises from the game included the play of the two quarterbacks named Harris; LSU's Brandon Harris and Florida's Treon Harris, now the Gators' starter after the loss of Will Grier to a PED suspension. After a slow start, both offenses got hot in the second quarter, combining for five touchdowns (four LSU, one Florida) in the period and completely changing the tone.\nFlorida was winning the special teams battle for a while, including a 72-yard punt return touchdown from Antonio Callaway, but LSU's winning score came on a perfect Les Miles fake field goal call. \n\"We had it. It was an opportunity for us to get seven and seven is a whole lot more than three,\" Miles told ESPN after the game. \"I had some unusual reactions. He's caught it perfectly all week,\" adding that the fake field goal was something LSU installed specifically for the Gators. \nA few things to note for both teams moving forward: \n1. In a spotlight game, Leonard Fournette was a game changer . Fournette didn't do anything we hadn't seen before this season. It's just that we weren't totally sure that he was going to be as impactful against a Florida defense that has given up more than 115 yards rushing just once all season. Fournette was sure to get his yards, but the inability to limit him from changing the game ultimately kept the Gators one step behind the entire night. Of Fournette's 31 carries, at 5.8 yards per attempt, 11 were for first downs or touchdowns and 9 were for 10 yards or more. When a star player is moving the chains or scoring every third touch, the chances are good that his team will win on most nights. \n2. Florida still looks like the best team in the SEC East without Will Grier. Treon Harris was solid. He didn't have much support from the ground game and still managed to move the ball. Until the final few possessions, when it was clear that Florida had to press a little, the Gators were holding their own with just enough pitch-and-catch to set up some explosive plays down the field. Harris' ability to extend the play with his legs allowed receivers to settle into open spots in LSU's coverage. The completion percentage numbers aren't going to match Will Grier, but a Treon Harris-led offense can still lead the Gators to an SEC title, especially considering the issues in Athens at the moment.\n3. DBU? Hey, remember when Florida and LSU were battling over the right to DBU? We can argue about talent comparisons or NFL potential until we are blue in the face but neither group had a banner day on Saturday night. The flip side to both quarterbacks playing well is that these arguably superior secondaries gave up a lot of big plays through the air; Florida finished with eight passing plays of 15 yards or more (four of 30+) while LSU had five, including a 52-yard pass and 50-yard touchdown pass to Malachi Dupre. \n4. LSU is the last unbeaten team in the SEC, and we cannot wait for Nov. 7 . With LSU's win against Florida and Texas A&M's loss to Alabama, the Tigers are now the only team in the SEC without a loss. This kind of spotlight and pressure must be managed by Les Miles and his staff because the Western Kentucky team coming to Baton Rouge next Saturday will be ready to test that secondary in ways LSU has not seen this year. \nBut if LSU can hold on against the Hilltoppers, it sets up another epic showdown with Alabama. The Nov. 7 meeting in Tuscaloosa will be an elimination game of sorts in the SEC West, as a second loss -- one that essentially would count as two losses because of the head-to-head -- could knock the Tide further back in the standings and solidify LSU's position for No. 1. An Alabama win sets up a wild November with everyone doing a little scoreboard watching on Saturday, hoping for the opportune upset to open a spot in Atlanta. \nLeonard Fournette ran for 180 yards against Florida.
