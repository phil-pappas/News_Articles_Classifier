We’ve been keeping a pulse on attendance and how that impacts revenues. The conversation had been to get through the season and then assess the year and entertain options that will work for the team and the city. We now have some hard data to work with.”\nJoplin Blasters CEO Gabriel Suarez agrees with Seibert and looks forward to a long standing relationship between the city, the citizens, and the Joplin Blasters.\nThe Joplin Blasters start their 2nd season in the South division of the American Association of Professional Baseball in May 2016. They will play 50 of their 100 games at Joe Becker Stadium. The Blasters off-season office hours are Monday – Thursday from 11 a.m. – 4 p.m. and are located at 131 South High Avenue in Joplin, Missouri.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:01:04.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
