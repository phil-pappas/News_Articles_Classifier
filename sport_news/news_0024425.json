No matter how much you do, it’s nearly impossible to live up to the standard set by the guy in front of you. Aaron Rodgers and Philip Rivers both know what it’s like to fill the shoes of a guy who’s going to have a bust in Canton, OH. Both of them have not only acquitted themselves admirably, but put together a Hall-worthy resume of their own. WATCH: Rivers Knows the Danger of Lambeau Rodgers could retire today and be enshrined on the first-ballot. Rivers’ resume (so far) is missing just one thing, and I don’t have to tell you what that is. Rodgers is another level of phenomenal at Lambeau Field, where he’s 48-10 as a starting quarterback. And it’s not just that the Packers are winning games at home. More often than not they’re destroying people at home. “You’re got to be a realist and realize 17 points is probably not gonna win it,” said Rivers. Can We Believe in Mike McCoy? That would be a good bet. Under Rodgers the Pack have scored less than 20 points at home exactly three times, the last coming on the final day of the 2010 season when they beat the Bears 10-3 to earn a playoff spot. Green Bay won the Super Bowl that year. Conventional thinking and an awfully large statistical sample would suggest the Bolts’ only chance at a win is getting in to a shootout. That’s not a great bet when you consider San Diego has not scored at least 20 points on the road since last season in San Francisco. Since then it’s been seven, 19 and 14 points away from Qualcomm Stadium. Interactive Timeline: Chargers' Hunt for New Stadium Green Bay is 5-0 and as ridiculous as Rodgers has been their defensive front has made life miserable for opposing quarterbacks. In just their last three games alone the Packers have 16 sacks. However, they have not faced anything even remotely close to Rivers yet. The Packers defense has run up against Jay Cutler, Russell Wilson, Alex Smith, Collin Kaepernick and Nick Foles on their way to a perfect start. That’s not exactly the NFL’s murderer’s row of passing attacks. Now here comes Rivers, second in the league in yards per game. He’s going to provide a challenge the Pack have not had since Week 14 of last year when Falcons QB Matt Ryan went for 375 yards and four scores. Of course, Rodgers countered with 327 yards and three touchdowns in a 43-37 win, but at least Atlanta gave themselves a chance, and with Rivers that’s what the Chargers have: a puncher’s chance. But Philip is going to need some serious help from this week’s three players to watch. Denzel Perryman, ILB Manti Te’o did not practice all week with an ankle injury and is questionable for Sunday. Since Donald Butler has been awfully awful, especially in pass coverage, it’s time for the rookie to make an impact. We’ve seen his tackling ability and against a horse like Eddie Lacy it’s paramount that Perryman use that skill to control the Green Bay rushing attack. Rodgers becomes even more dangerous if Green Bay has balance. But Perryman will also have to show something in pass defense. Rodgers loves to work the middle of the field with his athletic receivers like Randall Cobb, finding them in spots to let them run after the catch. Against the Rams a week ago Rodgers went 8-11 for 156 yards with two TD throwing over the middle. Outside the numbers he went 11-19 for 85 yards with two interceptions. The Pack will work the middle, so Perryman has to help patrol there and make Rodgers throw to the outside. Mike Scifres, P If the Chargers don’t score on a given drive they’ll need to make the Packers go as long as possible to get points of their own. Scifres is usually a wizard at dropping punts inside the 20 but has not been as effective in that area this season. I think he’s hurt somehow, although Scifres has not shown up on any injury report yet. Mike is a tough guy. The typical punter stereotypes certainly don’t apply to him. If he can gut out another one and help the Chargers control field position (with help from coverage units that showed signs of improvement against Pittsburgh) it’ll go a long way towards keeping the Bolts in the game. Melvin Gordon, RB He was born in Wisconsin. He went to high school in Wisconsin. He went to college in Wisconsin. Every major football milestone he’s reached has come in the Badger State (or at least in a Badgers uniform). How fitting would it be for that trend to continue this weekend? Gordon is looking for his first NFL touchdown and first NFL 100-yard game. A week ago the Packers were shredded by rookie running back Todd Gurley (30 carries, 159 yards) and that was without any threat from the St. Louis passing game. A big afternoon from Gordon will give the Chargers that balance they need to run at their peak and keep them in the game. Derek’s Prediction Chargers history suggests they’ll win this game. It would be quintessential San Diego sports to go in to the den of an undefeated team as a double-digit underdog and win (then lose the next week at home to the Raiders, but let’s hold off on that part for now). While the Bolts certainly do have the ability to win at Lambeau Field, there are just too many issues to overcome. The offensive line will be pieced together again with King Dunlap and Chris Watt both out. D.J. Fluker should play and there’s an outside chance Orlando Franklin returns but that group is likely to underwhelm again. Brandon Flowers is playing cornerback like he just woke up from a 2-year coma and the San Diego pass rush has not shown enough consistency to bring down Rodgers, one of the best in the NFL at extending plays. This is going to be a long, long day for Chargers fans.
