(Mark Wallheiser / Associated Press) FSU coach Jimbo Fisher is beginning to see a more confident Everett Golson. \nTALLAHASSEE – FSU coach Jimbo Fisher is beginning to see a more confident Everett Golson. \nThe quarterback’s numbers against Wake Forest were pedestrian and he missed some key throws late in the contest, but Fisher liked the way the graduate transfer from Notre Dame handled himself throughout the game. \n“I thought he took a lot of steps forward,” Fisher said. “I thought we were efficient.” \nNo. 12 FSU (4-0, 2-0 ACC) will need Golson to continue progressing with rival Miami (3-1) coming to Tallahassee. The Hurricanes’ defense has struggled this season, but Golson’s ability to keep the offense from bogging down will be critical in the big-game environment, especially if running back Dalvin Cook is slowed or unavailable because of a pulled hamstring. Kickoff is at 8 p.m. and the contest can be viewed on ABC. \nFSU did not make Golson available for interviews late Monday afternoon. He has not spoken to media since August. \nGolson completed 20 of 31 passes for 202 yards and a touchdown during a 24-16 win at Wake Forest. There were still times when Golson didn’t look completely sure of himself in the pocket – Fisher was seen mouthing “wide open” to Golson on the sideline after he held on to the ball too long on one play – but he at least took shots downfield. \nThe Seminoles connected on five passing plays of 15 yards or more despite windy conditions. It was a noticeably more assertive approach from FSU’s last game against Boston College, when Golson connected on just one passing play of 15 or more yards. \nEven with FSU up in the fourth quarter and in a position to end the game with a couple methodical drives, Fisher insisted on taking shots downfield to send a message to his team and called 12 passes on FSU’s final 13 plays. \n“I wasn’t going to sit there and hold it and run out the clock,” Fisher said. “We were trying to win that sucker. \n“I knew they were stacking the box and blitzing, and we were one-on-one. That’s one thing, you’ve got to be able to throw that football.” \nFisher was not thrilled with Golson’s play in the fourth quarter – 2-of-4 passing for eight yards while taking two sacks – but was pleased with his overall performance. \n“He played better,” Fisher said. “Controlled the game a lot better.” \nFSU’s pass offense, in general, has had its share of hiccups this season and that carried over into the contest against Wake Forest. The Seminoles had at least three drops versus the Demon Deacons, but the offensive line held up against a defense that blitzed about 60 percent of the time, according to Fisher. Golson largely handled the pressure well and protected the football by not committing a turnover for the fourth-straight game. \nLeft tackle Rod Johnson can see Golson and the entire passing attacking making slow strides. \n“It’s getting a little more confident,” Johnson said. “Every week they’re getting a little better, every week they’re on jug machines, getting better…I’m sure they’ll get very better by the end of the year.” \nGolson, according to Fisher, has demonstrated patience even when things have not gone smoothly. The fact he is now settling in is a promising sign to Fisher. \n“He's showed his maturity, and just growing into what's there, making sure his team is in positions to win games,” Fisher said. “Taking advantage of opportunities in the red zone. Third down has been pretty decent in protecting the football in those areas. \n“His ability to fit in with the guys and be one of the guys and lead them and make them feel like he's here just to help them.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T08:11:55.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
