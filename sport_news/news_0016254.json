Win a game.\nThe inability to do either in a wholly unexpected 0-3-1 start – the worst since 2008-09 – has launched a refrain that’s being bandied about. What’s wrong with the Ducks?\nIt is a question those involved aren't pondering.\n“I don’t think we’re thinking that broad,” defenseman Kevin Bieksa said. “I think we’re thinking, let’s score a goal the next game. Let’s try to win a game. We understand that it’s still early in the season. But yet we still have a sense of urgency that we have to get this thing going.\n“Sure, we played a good game last game and we controlled the game. Even the Vancouver game, I thought we controlled for the most part and had pucks in their end. But we got to start getting some production now, and we got to start putting pucks in the net.\n“We got to start winning games.”\nThere is angst aplenty. The offense that has generated one goal – a Sami Vatanen slap shot – in 285 minutes and none in the last 163 minutes. Even the 2003-04 team that started 0-4 had two goals to its name. \nThe Ducks are bewildered and searched for answers Saturday, particularly after a 3-0 loss to Colorado in which they attempted 92 shots. Sixteen of them missed the net while the Avalanche blocked an astounding 41 and Reto Berra stopped the other 35.\n“It’s weird,” winger Andrew Cogliano said. “You see four or five guys go through slumps at a time maybe and have a tough time scoring. To have 12 forwards especially not score a goal in four games, it’s unheard of, really.”\nThe Ducks will score another goal. That’s guaranteed. The unknown is when, and they’re counting on one today against Minnesota to get them going.\n“I kind of believe there would be pressure release everywhere,” Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau said. “I think the fans are dying to cheer for a goal. You can see it.\n“We can’t get frustrated. If this is the worst streak we go through all year, then we will be better for it when we come out of it. Especially if we come out of it playing the right way.”\nThey’re hurting in other ways as well. With two of their defensemen landing on injured reserve Saturday, the Ducks called up Shea Theodore and Korbinian Holzer from their American Hockey League team in San Diego.\nTheodore, selected 26th overall in the 2013 NHL draft, could be making his NHL debut today against Minnesota. The Ducks sidelined defenseman Simon Despres after Despres was on the receiving end of a questionable hit to the head by Colorado's Tyson Barrie in the second period Friday night.\nBarrie did not get penalized on the play, but drew a three-game suspension Saturday night from the NHL's player safety department. Despres did not return, and Boudreau didn't sound optimistic about his condition.\n“He’s not feeling quite right,” Boudreau said. “He'll have more evaluations done on Monday.”\nDespres joins Clayton Stoner on injured reserve. Stoner has missed the last two games with a lower-body injury that Boudreau has termed as “lingering.\"\nTeams have been taking runs at the Ducks this week. Vatanen was spun around by a dicey hit from Arizona’s Brad Richardson on Wednesday, which had Cam Fowler immediately going after Richardson for his first NHL fight.\nOn Friday, Barrie targeted Despres in the corner. And in the final stages of the game, Colorado’s Erik Johnson hit winger Corey Perry from behind into the boards. The hit got Johnson a two-minute minor, but Boudreau said it was a major penalty.\n“I don’t think teams are picking on us,” Boudreau said. “I think every team comes in thinking it’s going to be a tough game because we’re a big team. But I think, quite frankly, those are just hits that take place during the course of a game.”\nBieksa also downplayed the notion that opponents are taking liberties with them. He doesn’t consider Johnson a dirty player and called his hit “unfortunate.”\n“This is the NHL so I don’t think you’re going to get nights off or you’re going to get played easy,” he said. “With everything that’s been written before the season, we have a target on our back. And teams are playing us hard.\n“I think we’re trying to do the same thing. We’ve been on the right side of these collisions as well. It’s going to be physical, especially until we can get out of this.”\nContact the writer: estephens@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:50:22.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
