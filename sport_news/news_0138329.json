It's expected he will miss games Sunday against Cincinnati, and likely next week against Jacksonville. \nJohnson was on, then off, back on, and finally off the Colts roster the last two weeks while Andrew Luck was hurt, acting as insurance in case Matt Hasselbeck, who also was hurting, couldn't play. \nWith Taylor limping, the Bills face having to go back to E.J. Manuel the next two games, before a bye week. That can't instill a lot of confidence, considering Manuel went from the starter's job to No. 3 on the depth chart this preseason. The Bills might be wishing they could get a mulligan on that deal in which they sent Matt Cassel, a capable, veteran backup, to Dallas. \nCassel, for much of preseason, was considered a potential starter in Buffalo. At the very least, he was familiar with the Bills' offence, while Johnson wouldn't recognize half the team if they were out of uniform. \nTaylor's injury is just the latest in a continuing series of woes that have stunted the Bills' offence. \n\"Football is a physical sport. Teams that win championships (have) the luck of being healthy; having everybody on the field at once,\" receiver Percy Harvin said Tuesday. \"The guys who are injured, they're not too severely injured so we're going to get them back and hopefully we'll be able to hit our strides.\" \nThe Bills beat the Titans last weekend behind Taylor's running. But the strategy became costly when Taylor was dragged down by linebacker Zach Brown -- sustaining his injury -- on what officials ruled was a horse collar tackle. He missed a play after being slow to get to his feet. \nTaylor has been roughed up multiple times, and the physical toll is catching up. \"You ought to see him -- he is sore,\" said Ryan, who was cagey about Taylor's precise diagnosis. \"He hasn't been 100% all season. We all know he finished the game, but we'll see how he's doing. We'll be looking at him throughout the week and everybody else that we have.\" \nJohnson does bring more than just a physical presence. After spending much of training camp with the Bengals, he could have a bit of inside information. And, with the Bengals undefeated, the Bills can use any edge -- regardless how small -- they can get. \nTIME WARPED \nCan't anyone officiate this game anymore? \nFor the second consecutive Monday, the people charged with maintaining fair play are cleaning egg off their faces. \nThe NFL Tuesday blamed the side judge and clock operator in San Diego for losing 18 seconds prior to a game-winning drive by Pittsburgh. \n\"The game clock was incorrectly started before the Steelers' first play from scrimmage following the touchback. That first down snap came with 2:38 left to play instead of 2:56, a difference of 18 seconds,\" a league's statement said. \"The official game time is kept on the stadium scoreboard, but it is the responsibility of the side judge to supervise the timing of the game. Had the side judge or any of the other six on-field officials noticed the timing error, they could have corrected it.\" \nUnlike last Monday, when an officiating error cost the Lions a potential win, this error didn't play into the outcome. But, dumb is still dumb. \nThese days there are almost as many guys running around in striped shirts, blowing whistles, as there are players. There are cameras at every angle. There's video review, challenge flags and penalty flags. But what's the point, if none of them watched Sesame Street and learned how to do something as simple as tell the time? \nHANDS-OFF POLICY \nVikings cornerback Xavier Rhodes has seven penalties this season, tying for the second-most in the league behind the Saints' Brandon Browner, who has eight. \nDefensive back coach Jerry Gray slipped boxing gloves on Rhodes in practice telling him: \"There. Now you can't grab.\" \nWhich just goes to prove, nothing good happens to a guy who can't keep his hands to himself. \nFELLS' CAREER 'OVER'? \nDaniel Fells may never play football again, but he may yet walk on his own two feet. \nA source close to Fells told the New York Daily News they believe the damage done from a staph infection is serious enough that his \"playing days are all but over.\" \nOn a positive note, doctors treating the Giants' tight end for a MRSA infection are more optimistic than they were a few days ago that Fells won't lose his foot. \nFells has undergone five surgical procedures, with more scheduled, to stop the infection from spreading. \n\"I don't think he's out of the woods,\" coach Tom Coughlin said. \"I think these three straight days are really a wonderful sign, but there are more tests to be done. And again the response to the antibiotic is critical.\" \nQUICK HITS \nSeattle tailback Marshawn Lynch, after missing two games with a sore hamstring, is expected back this week ... The Cardinals signed veteran Dwight Freeney, hoping to boost a pass rush that has eight sacks ... Broncos pass rusher DeMarcus Ware (back injury) won't play Sunday ... Panthers Luke Kuechly has been cleared from concussion protocol and is expected to play against Seattle ... The Ravens, looking for secondary help, signed former 49ers cornerback Shareece Wright, cutting linebacker Jason Babin and cornerback Rashaan Melvin.
