He fanned 19 in another game. \nPerez was an ironman on the mound, pitching practically every inning in getting Texas Southmost College of Brownsville to the JUCO College World Series in 1977. In 1979, he pitched for a Sam Houston State team that went 18-3 against the Southwest Conference. With Perez as the ace of the pitching staff, the Bearkats advanced to the NAIA College World Series. \nPerez was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies and Cincinnati Reds in back-to-back years, but turned down a chance to play pro ball so he could study law. \nPerez’s achievements on the mound haven’t been forgotten. He’s one of six former ballplayers to be inducted into the hall of fame at Saturday’s 44th annual Leo Najo Day from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the Mission Community Center. \n“I lived and breathed baseball growing up, so this is quite an honor,” said Perez, now an attorney with offices in the Rio Grande Valley and San Antonio. \nThe other inductees are Cesar de la Garza of Brownsville, Luis Valdez of Brownsville, Juan “Johnny” Guzman of San Antonio, Rene Ramirez of Hebbronville and Jose Benito Hernandez Sr. of Abram, which is located in the Mission/Palmview area. \nAdmission to Saturday’s event is free. Doors open at 9 a.m. Barbecue plates are $7 and refreshments will be available. There will be live music. \nFor more information, contact Vicente Estevis at (956) 381-4844. \nRoy Hess covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
