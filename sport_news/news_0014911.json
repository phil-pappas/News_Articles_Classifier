(UTSports.com)-- As the bye week rolls along, Tennessee players and coaches spoke to the media at the Ray & Lucy Hand Digital Studio on Wednesday. \nCoordinators Mike DeBord, John Jancek, and Mark Elder, as well as players Josh Smith, Cameron Sutton, and Ethan Wolf discussed the Vols' dual mission of the off-week: fundamentals and health. \n\"I think the bye week is two-fold,\" offensive coordinator DeBord said. \"Number one, it's to improve your fundamentals and get better that week and look at the [upcoming] opponent. Also, it's our health; we have to continue to get our guys healthy for this last six-game drive.\" \nWhile the objectives are clearly defined, the process can be tricky. While the coaching staff looks to shore up certain techniques -- like tackling -- they must also weigh the physicality of such tasks against the objective of keeping the Vols' overall health on the uptick. \n\"That is a balancing act,\" defensive coordinator Jancek said. \"This week, we've really just dedicated ourselves to working on the tackling portion of it and taking guys to the ground. You've got to do it or you're never going to get better at it, but you can't beat them up. With this being a bye week, they'll have time to rest and heal at the end of the week. When we come back, we'll continue to work on our game plan [for] the Alabama game.\"Dobbs' Unwavering Demeanor Leads Vols \nAfter leading the Volunteers to a comeback win over Georgia, Joshua Dobbs has earned plenty of national recognition. \nOn Sunday the junior quarterback was named Walter Camp Offensive Player of the Week. On Monday he was named SEC Offensive Player of the Week and on Tuesday he earned the Davey O'Brien Award Quarterback of the Week. He also received praise from Athlon Sports, the Manning Award and was a nominee for the Capital One Impact Performance of the Week. \nOn the season, Dobbs ranks first in the SEC among quarterbacks in rushing with 368 yards in six games. Despite all the recognition, Dobbs acknowledged on Monday that he wouldn't be in this position without a little help. \n\"I understand that I couldn't have had those numbers and those awards without my teammates; receivers making plays, lineman opening holes, and everyone playing good all-around football. I know those awards aren't just on me, they reflect our whole offense and how productive we were this weekend.\" \nOffensive Coordinator Mike DeBord credits Dobbs' temperament for his stellar performance during Saturday's comeback surge. \n\"No matter what, he is even-keeled all the time,\" said DeBord, \"There are no highs and lows with Josh. Whether you are ahead or behind you know what you are going to get.\" \nPlaying at the marquee position at the University of Tennessee comes with its pressures both internally and externally, but they have yet to affect the Alpharetta, Georgia, native. \n\"His mindset is different than other people's,\" said wide receiver Josh Smith. \"He doesn't pay attention to anything. He knows himself. He knows what he can do and what he is capable of doing. He doesn't care about what the outsiders think. None of us care because we know exactly how he is. We are all confident in him.\" \nSpecial Teams Stars Berry, Daniel Making An ImpactUT's special teams units have shined this season, producing big plays and advantageous field position the Vols on a consistent basis.Evan Berry leads the country in kick return yardage with 39.3 yards per return and is tied for first nationally with two kick-return touchdowns. He opened the Arkansas game with a 96-yard return for a score, becoming the first Vol in 35 years to return an opening kickoff to the house (the last was Willie Gault vs. Kentucky on Nov. 22, 1980). UT tight ends coach/special teams coordinator Mark Elder said that Berry has thrived due to his strength and trust in the blocking. \n\"Evan does a great job in that role,\" Elder said. \"He is a big, strong kid that runs fast. He's got good vision, trusts the return, and really that's what it comes down to. He has the ability to run through arm tackles, which is critical on kickoff return and he trusts the return. Then 10 guys in front of him are blocking well and opening up a crease for him and he's finding that crease and hitting it.\" \nPunter Trevor Daniel has been a fan favorite with his booming punts and ranks fourth in the nation and second in the SEC with a 47.6-yard average on 33 punts. He has 14 punts of 50 or more yards and has pinned opponents inside their own 20-yard line 13 times. \nPerhaps Daniel's best punt of the year was the 56-yarder he launched late in Saturday's game against Georgia that bounced out of bounds at the Bulldogs' own one-half yard line. \n\"Trevor has had very nice year thus far,\" Elder said. \"We are excited about him as far as the distance and the hang time that he's had and getting the ball off in a timely manner certainly has been big. He had a couple of punts, obviously with the last one in the last game, that have been right at the right time and getting to the right spot. There are still some things to improve as far as ball placement at times, but he has been pretty consistent, minus a missed hit or two, as far as where we'd like it to be.\" \nTargeting The Tight EndsTennessee quarterback Joshua Dobbs connected with UT tight ends five times in Saturday's win over Georgia. Ethan Wolf had three catches for 56 yards and Alex Ellis made two grabs for 31 yards. It marked the first time that two UT tight ends each had 30 or more receiving yards in one game since Sept. 10, 2011, when Mychal Rivera had six grabs for 54 yards and Brendan Downs had two catches for 32 yards. \nWolf leads the team with 213 receiving yards and has already surpassed his freshman total (212 yards in 12 games) at the season's midway point. His yards-per-catch average has also jumped from 9.2 in 2014 to 14.2 in 2015. \n\"Ethan has certainly helped himself in the receiving aspect of things, as far as you see him able to get himself open, making plays in the pass-catching area,\" Elder said. \"He's become a more physical guy.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:52:47.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
