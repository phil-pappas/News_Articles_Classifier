Playing against the No. 1 team in the MIAA Division 6 South standings, Nantucket blasted Old Colony 30-0 at Oliviera Field on Saturday afternoon. “We spotted them a little bit early,” Old Colony co-coach Brandon Mendez said. “You have to execute against the good teams. Mistakes against a good football team will kill you.” The Whalers, now 5-0 overall and in the Mayflower Athletic Conference Small, hosts West Bridgewater, also 5-0, for the league championship on the island next Saturday. Old Colony was guilty of three mistakes in the first half and each led to points for Nantucket. Quarterback Jack Murphy, who was under siege all day, was intercepted on the game’s third play by JT Gamberoni, giving Nantucket possession at the Cougars’ 29. Four plays later, sophomore Keyshawn Young burst up the middle and into the end zone from 10 yards out. In the second quarter, Old Colony had back-to-back first downs on Ryan Baker’s 21-yard carry and Murphy’s 17-yard completion to Luke Cavallaro, but a fumble turned the ball over at the Nantucket 43. Young doubled the lead to 14-0 with a 53-yard run. Another interception led to Akeem Henry’s 32-yard field goal with 18 seconds to play in the second quarter and a 17-0 halftime lead. Murphy, who was 11-for-31 for 109 yards, was on the run all day as the much larger Nantucket defensive line overpowered the Old Colony offensive linemen. This put serious pressure on the Cougars quarterback and forced him to get rid of the ball earlier than he planned. The Old Colony defense, which gave up some big plays, stood tall late in the first quarter. The Cougars punted to Travis Demby at his goal line. Instead of letting the ball go into the end zone for a touchback, Demby carried it out and zig-zagged his way 95 yards to the Old Colony 5. Three runs and a penalty pushed the Whalers back to the 14 and Henry’s 31-yard field goal attempt came up short. Demby finished with 99 yards on five carries while Young added 71 yards and two touchdowns on six carries. Gamberoni added a 37-yard catch from Jack Holdgate to help set up Nantucket’s third quarter touchdown, a 22-yard TD pass from Holdgate to Andrew Ray. Gamberoni also led the Whalers defense with eight tackles. Holdgate finished with 87 yards passing while Alex Small capped scoring for Nantucket with a 22-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter.
