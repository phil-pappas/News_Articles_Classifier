Moments later, Hinostroza took a pass from Viktor Tikhonov and fed Brandon Mashinter from behind the Blues' net. Mashinter easily snapped a shot past Jake Allen to give the Hawks a 2-1 lead.\nHinostroza was later robbed on a one-timer on the power play midway through the third period and later started a good scoring chance for Kyle Baun.\nOne of the big reasons Hinostroza might not break camp with the Hawks is that the coaching staff would want him to get more seasoning in Rockford, much like Teuvo Teravainen did last year before coming up and playing a pivotal part in the team's Stanley Cup run.\nEither way, he's stood out in each of his three preseason games and appears to have a bright future.\nDennis Rasmussen scored the other goal for the Hawks at 3:34 of the first period. Marko Dano and Ryan Hartman registered the assists.\nThe Hawks' special teams were abysmal as they failed to cash in on 7 power-play opportunities and allowed a pair of shorthanded goals. They were also 0-for-2 on the penalty kill.\nScott Darling played the entire game in net for the Hawks and stopped 19 of 24 shots.\nMost of the Hawks regulars had the night off. Marcus Kruger did make his preseason debut, getting 13:47 of ice time.\n\"I'm happy to be back on the ice and get a game in,\" Kruger said during the second intermission.\n• After the Blues won Thursday, the teams played a 3-on-3 overtime period, but neither team scored.\n• Coach Joel Quenneville told reporters that Artemi Panarin, who is coming back from an upper-body injury, did practice Thursday. Panarin is expected back soon.\n• A Patrick Kane bobblehead is listed among the giveaways fans can look forward to this season. They will go to the first 10,000 fans who enter the United Center on Jan. 24 when the Hawks host the Blues.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
