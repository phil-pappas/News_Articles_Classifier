Signal photo by Katharine Lotze. \nCanyon quarterback Miles Fallin hit Jivanni Mckoy on a 57-yard catch and run down to the Saugus 18. \nA Cowboys’ touchdown would’ve given them their first lead early in the fourth quarter. \nThen Saugus’ defense furthered the case that it might be one of the Foothill League’s best defensive units, recovering a Canyon lateral two plays later and giving the ball back to an offense that sealed the deal. \nSaugus beat Canyon 31-21 on Friday night at Canyon High. \nBut don’t let the score lead you to believe the game was anything but a slugfest between a Saugus team fighting to stay in the Foothill title conversation and a Canyon team grappling just to remain in the playoff hunt. \nThe Centurions (4-4 overall, 2-1 in Foothill) held Canyon (1-7, 0-3) to 89 total yards in the first half, 52 of them coming on a swing pass touchdown from Fallin to running back Markeill Taylor. \nIt was nearly the exact same play that later swung the game’s momentum. \nThe Centurions only managed 139 yards of their own before half, and 136 of it came from their quarterback. \nCents QB Louis Eusebi got Saugus on the board with a 69-yard TD run early in the second quarter and a 3-yard scoring pass to Jaime Whisler with 16 seconds left before the break — giving Saugus a 14-6 halftime lead. \nEusebi completed 12-of-22 passes for 83 yards in the game. He did most of his damage on the ground, though, with 96 yards and two touchdowns. \nThe second of which came on the drive immediately following a Fallin swing pass that went through Taylor’s arms and was ruled a lateral. Saugus recovered and, nine plays later, Eusebi ran in from 4 yards out to put Saugus ahead 24-14. \nCanyon didn’t threaten again. As the Cents turned in their third strong defensive effort in league play. \nSaugus running back David Aubrey was bottled up most of the night, but he broke off a 50-yard TD run in the fourth to extend the Centurions’ lead to 31-14. \nAubrey finished with 78 yards on 19 carries. He had negative yardage in the first half. \nCanyon, which hasn’t missed the playoffs since 2008, never got its running game going. \nTaylor led the way with 36 yards on 10 carries. \nFallin completed 17-of-33 passes for 298 yards and two touchdowns. \nCamden Apsay caught a team-high seven passes for 110 yards for Canyon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:04:59.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
