WE finished the last three games and came out on the winning side.” \nMountain Pine’s first drive was cut short when Red Devil sophomore quarterback Matthew Herron was picked off by defensive back Bennett Pascoe. The interception set up an eight-play, 68-yard touchdown drive, which finished with Eagles senior quarterback Jakob Henry rushing on a quarterback draw up the middle for an 8-yard touchdown. \nThis was the first of many scores for Conway Christian, as it would win its third straight game under the sportsmanship rule. The rule is put in place after a team has a 35-point lead after halftime. \nMountain Pine lost for the 35th time in its last 36 games. \nThe Eagles scored their 35th point on a 6-yard touchdown pass from Henry to senior wide receiver Jon Mark Wood as time expired in the first half. This was the second of two touchdowns by Wood. \nThe Eagle defense allowed eight first downs and kept the Red Devils’ rush-heavy offense to just 140 yards. \nOn the offensive side of the ball, Conway Christian could do no wrong apart from five penalties, which cost the Eagles 80 yards. Conway Christian had 23 first downs and ran for 358 yards on 23 carries. Henry added 172 passing yards and three touchdowns on 13 of 18 completed passes. Henry added 44 yards rushing and two touchdowns. \nSenior running back/wide receiver Brendan Camp had one of the better games of the night for anyone on the field with 196 rushing yards and three touchdowns on seven carries. \n“Brendan is just a hard worker,” Carter said. “I wanted to come out, establish the run and he came out and ran hard. We did a good job up front, and he came out determined to have a good night and he did.” \nThe Eagles will turn their attention to the 5-0 overall and 2-0 in 5-2A England Lions, a game that has championship ramifications. \nThe Lions are fresh off a 42-0 victory over Bigelow. \n“It would mean a lot to win against England,” Carter said. “It’s still early in the conference season. That game is huge and it does have conference implications in it, but there are still a lot of ballgames left after that as well.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:55:17.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
