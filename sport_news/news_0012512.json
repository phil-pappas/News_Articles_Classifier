It also offers an easier way to wave a rally towel without excessive stress and strain. As a result, it enhances the sporting event experience and it could create a sense of unity among spectators at a game. The invention features a novel, lightweight design that is convenient and easy to use so it is ideal for sports fans. Additionally, THE TORCH is producible in design variations.\nThe inventor described the invention design. “My design provides a fun and easy way to cheer on your favorite teams.”\nThe original design was submitted to the Raleigh office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
