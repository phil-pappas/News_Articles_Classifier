JASON LEE jlee@thesunnews.com A business is destroyed by flooding in Columbia on Monday. South Carolina is still struggling with floodwaters due to a slow-moving storm system. Chuck Burton AP 1 of 4 Order Reprint of this Story COLUMBIA \nAfter a week of steady rain, the showers tapered off Monday and an inundated South Carolina turned to surveying a road system shredded by historic flooding, and in a cruel twist, thousands of residents faced the prospect of going days without running water. \nThe governor warned communities downstream, near the low-lying coast, that they may still see rising water and to be prepared for more evacuations. More than 900 people were staying in shelters and nearly 40,000 people were without water. \nAt least 12 weather-related deaths in two states were blamed on the vast rainstorm, with one of the latest coming when a sedan drove around a barricade and stalled in rushing waters. The driver drowned, but a woman who was riding in the car managed to climb on top of it and was rescued by a firefighter who waded into the water. \n“She came out the window. How she got on top of the car and stayed there like she did with that water– there’s a good Lord,” Kershaw County Coroner David West said. \nOn Monday, the rains moved north into North Carolina and the mid-Atlantic states. The storm was part of a system that dumped an unprecedented amount of rain across South Carolina and several other states. Satellite images released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show South Carolina getting drenched by a “fire hose” of tropical moisture. \nIn the animation, Hurricane Joaquin pounds the Bahamas and moves away from the East Coast as a separate area of low pressure spins across the Southeast, unleashing a torrent of water over South Carolina. \nSunday was the wettest day in the history of South Carolina’s capital city Columbia, according to the National Weather Service. \nThe 16.6 inches of rain on Gills Creek near downtown Columbia on Sunday was one of the rainiest days in the U.S. in the last 15 years, according to weather stations with more than 50 years of record-keeping. There was so much rain in Gills Creek, a water gauge was swept off a bridge and had to be replaced by members of the U.S. Geological Survey. \n“The flooding is unprecedented and historical,” said Dr. Marshall Shepherd, a meteorologist and director of the atmospheric sciences program at the University of Georgia. \nHe said the unique double punch of the upper level low – aided by a “river” of tropical moisture in the atmosphere from Hurricane Joaquin spinning far out in the Atlantic – gave the monster rainstorm its punch. \nOn Monday, Gov. Nikki Haley said 550 roads and bridges were closed across the state. All will have to be checked for structural integrity, which could take weeks or longer. She said floodwaters will continue to rise in some areas as rainwater runs down the state toward the coast. \n“This is not over. Just because the rain stops does not mean that we are out of the woods,” Haley said at a news conference. \nHaley, a Republican, also thanked President Barack Obama for a disaster declaration that frees up federal resources and for personally calling her Monday morning. \nHaley said that nine people have died in the state since the storm started. Two additional weather-related deaths were reported in North Carolina. \nAt least three people were killed Sunday in South Carolina, including a transportation worker who died overseeing work near downtown Columbia, a woman who was swept away in her SUV and the man who drove around the barricade Sunday night in the Lugoff community northeast of Columbia, said the coroner said. \nMcArthur Woods, 56, drowned after his car was inundated. His passenger was rescued when someone who heard her screams called 911 around 10 p.m. \nHaley said that 25 emergency shelters are open, housing more than 900 people. Utility crews, meanwhile, were working to restore power to 26,000 people still without power, she said. \nThe flooding forced hundreds of weekend rescues and threatened the drinking water supply for Columbia, with officials warning some could be without potable water for days because of water main breaks. The capital city told all 375,000 of its water customers to boil water before drinking. \nElsewhere, nearly 75 miles of Interstate 95 – the main link from the Southeast U.S. to the Northeast – was closed. \nMany schools and colleges, including the University of South Carolina, canceled classes Monday and Tuesday, and some businesses planned to stay shuttered. State climatologists have said the sun could peek out Tuesday. \nSupplies from York County headed to flood victims \nDonations for flood victims in Dorchester County near Charleston are being collected today and Tuesday at Fort Mill Ford. \nThe dealership, at 801 Gold Hill Road just west of Exit 88 of Interstate 77, is serving as a collection point for a 16-foot trailer that will leave with supplies to help people who are staying in emergency shelters. \nItems being collected are: bottled water, diapers, toiletries, games for children that do not require batteries, contact lens solutions, contact cases and other non-perishable items. \nDrop-offs can be made until 8 p.m. Tuesday. The trailer is leaving Wednesday morning. \nAndrew Dys", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:40:47.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
