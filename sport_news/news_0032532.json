Safety George Iloka was also listed as questionable for the game due to an ankle injury that prevented him from playing last Sunday against Kansas City, but he practiced all three days last week and is also active for the Seattle game. \nAlso made inactive for Sunday's game are: wide receivers Mario Alford and Greg Little; tight end C.J. Uzomah; cornerback Chris Lewis-Harris; rookie defensive tackle Marcus Hardison and defensive end Margus Hunt. \nIt marks the fifth straight game that Alford, Little, Uzomah, Hardison and Hunt were made inactive. \nSims being made inactive means that Brandon Thompson is active after not being active for the Kansas City game. \nThompson was active for the Baltimore game and played 24 snaps with two tackles, including one for loss. \nSEAHAWKS INACTIVES: The Seahawks made the following players inactive for Sunday's game: cornerback Tye Smith; running back Marshawn Lynch; cornerback Marcus Burley; linebacker Kevin Pierre-Louis; offensive lineman Kristjan Sokoli; offensive lineman Alvin Bailey and defensive end Demarcus Dobbs. \nThomas Rawls is expected to start at running back in place of Lynch, who was ruled out on Friday. \nRunning back Rod Smith, an undrafted rookie free agent from Ohio State, was signed from the practice squad on Saturday due to the injury to Lynch and backup Fred Jackson, who is active, but was listed as questionable due to a high ankle sprain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:53:37.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
