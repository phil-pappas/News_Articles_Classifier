The move could hamper the NCAA investigation into Louisville. (Associated Press) Comments \nUniversity of Missouri-Kanasas City assistant coach Andre McGee, the central figure in the prostitution scandal engulfing the Louisville basketball program, resigned his position on Friday, citing an inability do his job while dealing with the investigation. \n\"The university deserves a full-time assistant basketball coach and I am not able to provide that to the basketball team while the false allegations against me are being investigated,\" McGee said in a statement released by UMKC. \nMcGee's resignation follows the usual pattern for those familiar with NCAA investigations. Since he is no longer working in an NCAA program, McGee can't be compelled to cooperate in any investigation. \nIf he does not cooperate with an investigation, however, McGee would likely be in line to receive a show-cause penalty from the NCAA, making it challenging to continue his coaching career. \nLouisville coach Rick Pitino has called on McGee to \"tell the truth.\" \nMcGee had been on paid administrative leave at UMKC since the accusations of Katina Powell, an escort in Louisville, were made public. \nShe has accused McGee of spending at least $10,000 at parties that included strippers, and sometimes prostitutes, for players and recruits at Louisville. \nMcGee has said repeatedly that the accusations levied against him are false, and Pitino has claimed that he did not have knowledge of any of the problems, which took place over a four-year time-frame. \nWhile Pitino's ignorance to the problems likely won't absolve him of punishment from the NCAA under current rules, it could be the key to him retaining his job at the University of Louisville.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:19:29.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
