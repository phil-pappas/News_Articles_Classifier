The 2-year-old daughter of Scat Daddy made a big rally off the final turn and wore down Sapphire Kitten in the deep stretch to take the Jessamine Stakes by a neck, probably cementing a spot in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf at Keeneland on Oct. 30. \nSent off as the even-money favorite, Harmonize was coming in off a four-length win in the P.G. Johnson Stakes over the Saratoga turf Sept. 3 and was beaten just a nose in her career debut going 11⁄16 miles on Aug. 9. \nThe anxious moments that arose as she raced unhurried near the back through fractions of :22.44 and :47.02 turned to nervous energy of the enjoyable kind when she swung out extremely wide under jockey Junior Alvarado and used that sweeping move to mow down a game Sapphire Kitten. \n\"Usually she's pretty quick out of the gate and I thought she'd probably be laying third or fourth,\" Mott said. \"I thought she'd be stalking ... but I was real surprised to see her as far back as she was. When (Alvarado) turned for home, she turned on the after-burners and was good enough to run them down.\" \nOutsider Art came up for third as Harmonize hit the wire in 1:44.19 over a course rated firm. \nOwned by Larkin Armstrong, Harmonize ran a bit green in her career debut when she ducked from the whip late. But since then she has matured. \n\"She has come a long way, particularly to be able to transform her running style into what she did today,\" Mott said. Alicia Wincze Hughes: (859) 231-1676.
