Here are a few thoughts and observations about the win:\n1. To me, coaches can be judged by how their teams play in the third quarter. By that point, you have seen what the other team’s game plan is and have halftime to adjust. You also have halftime to light a fire under your team if it’s having a lackadaisical performance.\nOn Sunday, Todd Bowles’ halftime heroics were on display. The Jets were sleep-walking in the first half, but exploded in the third quarter for 17 points. Players said Bowles made it clear he was unhappy at halftime, but was not a crazy man. He challenged the veterans to pick it up and they did. Darrelle Revis, Brandon Marshall and Ryan Fitzpatrick were in the middle of the comeback — all players north of 30.\nThe Jets have outscored opponents 34-0 in third quarters this season. That is an impressive mark that speaks volumes about Bowles. It really is amazing it took Bowles this long to get a head coaching job. He is built for the job. He seems to hit all the right buttons week after week. The decision to play a four-man front against Washington worked perfectly, buttoning up their rushing attack.\nNow, let’s see how he matches up with Bill Belichick.\n2. Bowles said he went to the four-man front strategically because the Redskins like to run a lot of double teams and he wanted them to have more guys up front to deal with. But he must have also wanted to see what that front would look like with Muhammad Wilkerson, Sheldon Richardson, Damon Harrison and Leonard Williams on the field at the same time.\nOne word: impressive.\nSheldon Richardson and Muhammad Wilkerson celebrated their shared sack in the first half against Washington. Photo: Charles Wenzelberg The group had 15 quarterback hurries, four hits and one sack. They also shut down the Washington run game. Washington finished with 34 yards on 17 carries, with a long of 8 yards.\nThis foursome will give offensive coordinators nightmares. Whom do you double-team in that group? Richardson has fresh legs . Wilkerson is playing at the highest level of his career. Harrison is immovable in the middle. Williams already looks like he belongs.\nGood luck.\n3. There are plenty of positives to cite about the Jets this season, but one negative that keeps popping up is poor special teams play.\nThe Jets gave up a blocked punt for a touchdown in the fourth quarter Sunday. It won’t get much attention because the Jets were in control of the game, but it was inexcusable if you look at it. The Jets only had 10 players on the field. This is a failure on so many levels. A coach should be counting players on the unit and someone (usually the personal protector) on the field should be counting, too.\nThis was just the latest gaffe on special teams. They have given up two touchdowns and accounted for none. The return games are barely existent. Jeremy Kerley had a 22-yard punt return, his longest of the season, among his three returns, but fair-caught the other two punts he saw. Zac Stacy as the kickoff returner does not scare anyone.\nSpecial teams coach Bobby April is a veteran of the NFL. He will keep shaking things up until he finds answers, but right now his unit is the weak link.\n4. The Jets are benefitting greatly from all those first-round picks they have used on the defensive line in recent years. Wilkerson (2011), Richardson (2013) and Williams (2015) are all playing well. But they have not all been hits. Quinton Coples (2012) is barely playing these days. On Sunday, he played just nine snaps (14 percent). That is the lowest total of his career, lowering the mark set in their last game against the Dolphins.\nQuinton Coples chases Andrew Luck in Week 2. Photo: Getty Images Bowles has pointed to personnel packages as the reason Coples is not playing, saying it is not about his play. He likely will say the same this week if asked about Coples. The Jets ran a ton of four-man fronts against the Redskins, leaving Coples on the sideline.\nBut Bowles has said since he arrived, the best players will play. Coples’ dwindling playing time tells me the coaching staff does not believe he is one of the best players on the defense. The Jets face a decision this offseason with Coples. They already picked up his fifth-year option for 2016, which will be about $7 million, but they can release him for any reason other than injury and not have to pay him. Right now, it looks like he is a goner.\nRevealing number: The Jets’ passing game is all about Brandon Marshall and Eric Decker. Out of 107 completed passes, 55 (51 percent) have gone to Marshall or Decker. If you zero in on just wide receivers, the duo has caught 71 percent of the 78 receptions.\nCan the Jets thrive like this? So far they have, but you have to think they will need a third option to appear at some point. The Jets receivers look like this: Marshall 37 catches, Decker 18, Quincy Enunwa 8, Kerley 6, Devin Smith 5 and Chris Owusu 4.\nGame ball: Chris Ivory continued his huge season with 146 rushing yards on 20 attempts and a touchdown along with three catches for 50 yards. The 196 total yards is a new career high for Ivory. He is third in the NFL with 460 rushing yards and first in yards per game at 115.0. There are a few early candidates for team MVP, but I would vote for Ivory.\nSurprising snap count: Rookie wide receiver Devin Smith played just 16 of 67 offensive snaps. That is a big drop from the 59 he played against Miami and 64 against the Eagles. The Jets used Quincy Enunwa as the third receiver more this week. Smith has been unimpressive early in his rookie season, but it is too soon to make any judgments. The coaches have said they believe it will come for Smith, but it was telling he played so little on Sunday.\n  Filed under brandon marshall ,  chris ivory ,  damon harrison ,  devin smith ,  eric decker ,  leonard williams ,  muhammad wilkerson ,  new york jets ,  quinton coples ,  ryan fitzpatrick ,  sheldon richardson ,  todd bowles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:43:52.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
