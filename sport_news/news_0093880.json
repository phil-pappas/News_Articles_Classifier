That would have felt like the appropriate karmic level of payback for the mess that the Indy franchise kickstarted nine months ago in a rainy night in Foxboro. ( Just ask his Dad .) The Colts were simply going to be bit players as the latest post-Deflategate drama played out in front of a national television audience. But that didn’t happen. Instead, it was an occasional struggle for Brady and the New England offense. To be truthful, there were times where he was ineffective. There was a poor decision on a pass play for Edelman that caused a Patriots’ drive to end with a field goal instead of a touchdown. He was sacked twice, and New England was forced to punt five times. And there was an ugly pick-six on a bobbled ball for Julian Edelman to defensive back Mike Adams , a guy who had gotten Brady on previous occasions. “I let (him) down,” Edelman said after the game when asked about the pick. “That interception should be on me. The guy is playing great ball, and it’s unfortunate.” In the end, Brady finished 23-for-37 for 312 and three touchdowns in the 34-27 win that wasn’t nearly as close as the score would indicate. The Patriots scored on six of their 12 possessions (the 13th possession was an end-of-game kneeldown), moved to 5-0, and shoveled a little dirt on an Indianapolis team that might not be able to boast of being back-to-back AFC Finalists when all is said and done. So why wasn’t Brady happy? Maybe happy isn’t the right word. After the game, he had the semi-disappointed look of a kid who came bounding downstairs on Christmas morning expecting to find a new XBox and a copy of Grand Theft Auto V under the tree, but instead found a PS2, Lee Carvallo’s Putting Challenge and a new sweater. No, no. This is great. Really. It was just what I was hoping for . “Our execution was off at times (but) it was a good win. I’m glad we won,” Brady said. “It’s always good to win on the road.” He added: “I thought we could have executed a lot better in a lot of phases — run, pass, everything — so that’s what we’ll try and do.” Simply put, it was not the Ezekiel 25:17 routine that many had believed would go down in his return to Indy. The thought process was that Brady was going to lay waste to the Colts as part of his vengeful tour across the NFL, and he would save his best work for the snitches in Indy who turned him in. And while it was pretty good — he might be the only quarterback to look almost disconsolate after a game where he finished with a 104.8 passer rating — Sunday’s performance might not the pound of flesh that some believed he was owed after what happened last January. Of course, we have become accustomed to the quarterback being able to simply manifest any sort of outcome he wants simply because he’s Tom F’in Brady . It’s important to note that he did not have his starting left tackle, and quickly lost another tackle in the first half when Marcus Cannon went down with a toe injury. (That’s not to mention the fact that the Patriots were using a backup center and two rookie guards for most of the night.) It’s hard to win, but it’s also hard to win when you’re relying on backups for protection. “That was tough. That was a big challenge (but) that’s part of life in the NFL,” Brady said of the changes up front. “It’s just a few moving parts there. We’ll need time to settle in and see if we can settle those positions down and make all the improvements.” Despite the losses, he was able to connect with a nice variety of receivers on the night. After Edelman’s finger made like Torry Holt and Brian Baldinger, Danny Amendola came out of nowhere to stack up a game-high 105 catches on seven catches. Edelman had six catches for 50 yards and a touchdown. Rob Gronkowski came out of mothballs after a quiet first half to finish with three catches for 50 yards and a touchdown. And LeGarrette Blount added 16 carries for 93 yards, to go along with one rushing touchdown and a receiving touchdown. Truthfully, the game wasn’t really truly over until the Colts gift-wrapped the contest in the form of an apocalyptically bad special teams blunder that should be shown on a loop accompanied with calliope music. The goof allowed the one that allowed the Patriots to take over on downs near midfield — six plays later, New England effectively ended the game with an 11-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Blount to make it 34-21. In the end, it wasn’t perfect. There was no tap dancing, no double-birds and no celebrations at the expense of his enemies. And while Brady wasn’t exactly elated after the game, it was more than enough for the Patriots to come away with the win. No style points? No vindication? No worries. And besides, there’s always a chance Brady and the Patriots get another bite at the apple: After the game, Indy’s Adams boasted to reporters , “I’m pretty sure we’ll see them again.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:27:13.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
