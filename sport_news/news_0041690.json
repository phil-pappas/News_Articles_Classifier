He is being raised by a single father, Durrell Sr. His family endured what his dad called “poor-living conditions” for nearly four years. He sat out of athletics his sophomore year after transferring from Baker . \n“There are really two directions you can go in situations like Durrell has been in – the right way or the wrong way,” Barnett said. “Some people might turn to drugs or drinking or gangs or whatever. Durrell is the complete opposite of that. He’s a leader and a humble athlete, and his dad deserves a lot of credit for that.” Durrell Williams looks for running room during his junior year at Cottage Hill Christian. (Scott Donaldson | preps@al.com) \nThe 6-foot-3, 170-pound Williams has racked up nearly 1,000 yards of total offense and nine touchdowns this season. In a 28-13 win over Excel earlier this season , Williams ran for 199 yards and three touchdowns on 20 carries. \nThough he is a wide receiver by trait, Williams likely will start at quarterback on Friday at Hillcrest-Evergreen because of injuries to senior Cole Butler and junior Will Harrington . \n“When Cole and Will got hurt, Durrell stepped up in practice, and we really saw him lead the team vocally,” Barnett said. “He is the guy we want to get the ball to anyway we can. We want to put it in his hands and see what he can do. He can catch. He’s the fastest guy on the team. He’s the best running back. We are at our best when he is touching the ball.” \nWilliams dreams of playing college football next year, continuing his education and eventually being an accountant. It would be unwise to bet against him with the conditions his family has worked through to this point in his young life. \nWilliams Sr., who will turn 40 in January, grew up in Uriah, graduated from Vigor in 1995, spent two years at Alabama State and decided to join the Navy in 1997. Durrell Jr. was born on Jan. 4, 1998 when his father was stationed in Great Lakes, Ill. The two didn’t meet until several weeks later. Now 17, Durrell is the oldest of three children. He has two sisters – Taraveia (13) and Cherelle (3). Durrell and Taraveia have a different mother from Cherelle, but neither mom is a big part of their lives. \n“My mom doesn’t do a lot, but she is around some,” Williams Jr. said. \nHowever, Durrell Sr., in no way, uses that as an excuse. \n“I wasn’t raised to be a part-time dad,” he said. “I always wanted to be in my kids’ lives every day I could, and I’ve been blessed to have that opportunity. I know there is a stereotype out there sometimes that a man can’t raise his own children, but I feel I’m the opposite of that. I cook. I clean. I also teach the kids to have the same love for both parents even though we aren’t together anymore. That is important to me.” \nIt’s been a struggle for Durrell Sr. since leaving the military in 2005 because of medical issues. As a disabled veteran and without a college degree, he has had a difficult time finding consistent employment. From the middle of 2006 until late in 2010, the family’s living conditions were rough to say the least. \nThey were homeless for almost a year-and-a-half, living out of Durrell Sr.’s truck some and also staying with family members when they could. In 2009, the Williams rented a house off Dauphin Island Parkway, but that situation wasn’t too much better. \n“The house had a real bad leak in the roof and rain just poured in,” Durrell Sr. said. “A lot of the time, the utilities didn’t work correctly. I can remember having to use the neighbor’s water hose to brush our teeth.” \nDurrell Jr. said he didn’t remember much about the house with the leaky roof, only that he stayed at the neighbors a lot during that span. Through it all, Durrell Sr. said he tried to make sure his children grew up in a loving environment. \n“They were always my support, always my backbone no matter what we went through,” he said of his children. “I remember one Christmas in that same house, I got teary eyed on Christmas because the gifts I was able to provide weren’t great. My oldest daughter was 4 or 5 then. She told me, ‘Daddy, don’t be sad. This is the best Christmas ever.’ When I asked her why, she said, ‘because we are here with you.’” \nDurrell Sr. said he never went looking for handouts or charity even in the worst of times. \n“I knew I had control over my life and, through prayer, it was going to get better,” he said. “I never walked with my head down. I tried to never let the struggles consume me. I knew God was faithful.” \nLittle by little, the situation improved. \nWilliams Sr. went through a credit repair company to begin stabilizing his finances and was able to start saving some money. He also received an increase in his disability pay and, in late 2010, was able to put his family in a better house off Cottage Hill Road. They still live there today. \n“The income I make now I think with a dual-family income would be decent,” he said. “As a single dad, I still have some issues, but we make it. There are hard times, but we have what we need, and it is improving.” \nDurrell Jr. went through three middle schools. He spent his freshman year at Baker High, but in a school that size, Williams Sr. wasn’t sure how much playing time his son would receive in football. In the summer of his sophomore year, Durrell Jr. transferred to Cottage Hill. \nWilliams was required to sit out as a 10th-grader, but quickly made his presence known as a junior – his first year of organized football since he was 13. \n“Cottage Hill has been the best experience of my life,” he said. “I don’t think any other school could have changed my life the way this one has. I was saved here. I was baptized. I think my life turned around athletically, academically and spiritually here.” \nDurrell Jr. remembers the tough times but doesn’t dwell on them. \n“It was super hard, but I don’t regret it,” he said. “We’ve come a long way. We couldn’t let that stuff set us back. We knew everything would get better as long as we had Jesus in our heart.” \nHe also had his father on his side. \n“I love him,” Durrell said. “When he says he is my biggest fan, I believe him. He tells me what I do right and wrong even after a bad game. He is always there with a hug or a kind word. I don’t know where we would be without him.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:23:26.410+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
