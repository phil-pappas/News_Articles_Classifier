The team doesn't have to put him on the 53-man roster until 4 p.m. Monday and coach Mike Tomlin joked he wouldn't make a decision until about 3:58.\nMORE: Top 10 Steelers of all time | Week 5 picks\nThe media isn't allowed to report which players practice based on their observation, per Steelers policy. But Bryant told reporters Wednesday he did not practice. When the team was asked about his practice participation Thursday, a spokesperson wouldn't clarify.\nWhile the Steelers are keeping quiet about Bryant's practice participation, Michael Vick apparently let the cat out of the bag. He told Pittsburgh reporter Mike Prisuta he's only practiced with Bryant once this week, and that was Monday. He also added he's \"getting a little concerned\" about Bryant's availability.\n\"Just gotta keep the faith, hopefully he'll get himself back,\" he said .\nFor regular fans it won't matter much whether Bryant plays, but for fantasy football owners this is a nightmare scenario. Bryant exploded last season with his eight touchdown receptions in 10 games and was expected to be a major factor this season once his suspension lifted.\nIf Bryant does play, he'd be a huge addition for Vick, who is filling in for an injured Ben Roethlisberger. The pair worked well together in the preseason when Vick's first pass as a Steeler went for 63 yards to Bryant against the Bills. He ended with two passes for 99 yards from Vick in that game.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4591218-top-10-pittsburgh-steelers-of-all-time-mean-joe-greene-bradshaw-ham-swann-chuck-noll", "https://twitter.com/DVEMike/status/652561988745216001", "https://twitter.com/MarkKaboly_Trib/status/651841536141971456", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-10-08/nfl-picks-week-5-predictions-odds-lines-patriots-cowboys-bengals-seahawks-saints-eagles", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:19:44.975+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
