Gormley was the Coyotes' first-round selection (13th overall) in the 2010 NHL draft.\nHe will partner with Nick Holden against the Hurricanes, who will play the third game of a seven-game road trip. Colorado's other defensive pairings are Francois Beauchemin with Erik Johnson and Nikita Zadorov with Nate Guenin.\n\"Coming in here after getting traded, you just try to play your game and earn a spot. I thought I had a good camp,\" Gormley said at Wednesday morning's availability. \"Before the season I knew I would be sitting out the first few (games) here. As a player you just have to compete hard in practice and try to prove every day that you belong in the lineup.\"\nThe Avs begin a two-game homestand before embarking on a three-game East Coast road trip. Colorado hosts Columbus on Saturday before beginning the trip Tuesday at Florida.\nMike Chambers: mchambers@denverpost.com or @mikechambers\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:08:02.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
