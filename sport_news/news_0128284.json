Giants flack gets foul-mouthed about Howard Eskin Pat Hanlon (right), the foul-mouthed Vice President of Communications for the Giants, isn't that big a fan of Fox 29 and WIP's Howard Eskin (left) Twitter Travel Deals Rob Tornoe, Philly.com Posted: Monday, October 19, 2015, 5:40 PM \nCount the top press guy for the New York Giants among those who aren’t fans of Fox 29 and SportsRadio 94.1 WIP sports host Howard Eskin. \nPat Hanlon, the vice president of communications for the Giants, took to Twitter to publicly curse at Eskin hours before his team's big Monday night matchup against the Eagles. \n\"God bless America. Only in this country does that guy have a job,\" Hanlon added on Twitter. \n\"Always love comments from a team executive,\" Eskin said in response. \"Obviously from my fan club, even a New York guy is an admirer.\" \nAs Crossing Broad's Kyle Scott noted, the bad blood appears to stem from a 2010 incident in which Hanlon called out Eskin following the Giants' Sunday night loss to the Eagles. After the game-ending punt return by DeSean Jackson, Eskin reported that then-Giants punter Matt Dodge was in tears, and had to be consoled by head coach Tom Coughlin. After Eagles game learned that NY coach T. Coughlin saw his punter in tears. Told him get out of locker room. No longer on this team. — Howard Eskin (@howardeskin) December 21, 2010 \nAs we know, Dodge wasn’t cut by the Giants after the game (he lost his job the following offseason), a fact Hanlon pointed out on Twitter. I don't know who this \"reporter\" is, but I do know this story is bogus.
