Some were cannibals that ate away at similar models in the family; some were Frankensteins too ugly and misunderstood to venture out into the vicious auto world. Some are quality cars that deserve resurrection on the used car market, where greater depreciation can lead to greater deals than a brand sibling, while other discontinued zombies need to be sealed in their graves for eternity.\nDodge Grand Caravan\nIllinois' most beloved car, the Dodge minivan, will be folded in 2016 while FCA streamlines its product lines. Dodge will be the performance line, Jeep the SUV line, and Chrysler the sedan and minivan line. Expect the redesigned 2016 Town & Country, rumored to come with a plug-in hybrid variant, to take over for the Caravan.\nHonda Crosstour\nThe bubble-shaped Honda Crosstour, which is an Accord station wagon being marketed as a crossover, launched in 2010 and quickly plummeted to irrelevance due to questionable marketing, questionable design and unimpressive performance and utility.\nHonda alt-fuel vehicles\nThe Accord hybrid sedan launched to much fuel-saving fanfare last year, but lower gas prices and more fuel-efficient engines have helped spur the market preference for crossovers and SUVs while sales of hybrids have stagnated. Honda appears to be revamping its alternatively fueled vehicle program by discontinuing the Civic hybrid, though the CR-Z sports coupe hybrid gets another year. Honda has pulled the plug on the limited release Accord Plug-In Hybrid, Fit EV and stopped California sales of its fuel-cell car, the FCX Clarity.\n\"Honda will offer several next-generation, advanced powertrain vehicles, including a new fuel cell vehicle set to launch next year, followed by a new battery-electric model and a new plug-in hybrid model by 2018,\" said Marcos Frommer, spokesman for Honda.\nJaguar XK\nWith last year's launch of the awesome F-Type performance sports coupe and convertible, Jaguar didn't have as much need for the stale XK coupe and convertible, which had two rear seats, unlike the F-Type. Produced since 1996, the XK was larger and more luxury leaning than the F-Type, whose 5.0-liter supercharged V-8 engine and stunning good looks make it a pure sports car.\nJeep Compass and Patriot\nThe crossover twins are discontinued for 2016 on the 75th anniversary of the Jeep brand, but its five-year plan lists an undisclosed model coming in 2016 to replace the Compass/Patriot. The Cherokee was thought to have filled the space between the Grand Cherokee (E segment) and the smaller Compass (C segment), while the Renegade (B segment) introduced this year represents the subcompact crossover slot in Jeep's lineup.\nMini Cooper Convertible, Coupe, Roadster\nIn recent years, the Mini Cooper brand ballooned to seven models, but the market, like the mini, was too small for such segmentation. The Mini Convertible, Roadster and the Coupe, the miniest of minis, will be discontinued. The Roadster and the Coupe are two-seaters, and the Roadster and the Convertible are topless, but all of them are done for 2016.\nMitsubishi Lancer Evolution\nIt's easy to forget Mitsubishi's storied racing history because of the Japanese brand's vanishing presence in America, but the all-wheel-drive compact Evo is a rally legend still doted on by enthusiasts and gearheads. That won't change this year, as the 10th and final generation Evo gets a limited run Final Edition with a 2.0-liter turbo inline four-cylinder engine that generates 303 horsepower and 305 pound-feet of torque. Only 1,600 models will be produced.\nNissan Xterra\nNissan is the next automaker exiting the shrinking wilderness of the rugged SUV segment, leaving it to the Jeep SUVs in Trailhawk trim, the Toyota 4Runner, and Land Rover's SUVs, which are almost too nice to go backwoods busting. Launched in 2000, the sport-marketed Xterra with trucklike body-on-frame construction has been pushed out by a wide, comparatively soft lineup of Nissan crossovers, including the Juke, Rogue, Murano and Pathfinder, as well as the full-size Armada.\nScion xB, xD, iQ\nScion may be going through a mid-make crisis. Launched in 2003, the quirky youthful alternative to staid parent brand Toyota, Scion is discontinuing its iconic toaster, the xB, as well as half its product line, including the iQ microcar and the xD subcompact hatch, which is a smaller, rounded version of the xB. Filling the absence of such distinct quirks will be two mainstream models, the iA four-door compact and its hatchback brother, the iM. Oddly, the i-brothers are more Mazda than Scion or Toyota, due to a long-term Toyota-Mazda partnership based on Toyota sharing its hybrid powertrains and Mazda sharing its Skyactiv gas-engine system that is in the iM and iA.\nToyota Venza\nThe Venza beat its lone competitor, Crosstour, to the grave by a month. Introduced in 2009, the Venza wasn't big enough to appeal to crossover buyers, functional enough to appeal to Camry buyers or distinct enough to draw away Subaru Outback buyers.\nVolkswagen Eos\nThe compact convertible launched in 2006 and flew under the radar as the price climbed. The 2015 base model started at $35,795. Owners praised its charms as a nimble compact more versatile than an MX-5, but mainstream convertibles are a tough sell. The Chrysler 200 convertible folded last year with the launch of the winning redesign of the 200 midsize sedan. Shoppers interested in a compact convertible should check out the new Buick Cascada.\nThe 2017 rumor mill\nIn 2017, Cadillac XT5 replaces the SRX, which is Cadillac's best-selling model globally.\nChevy SS will run through 2017 model year, before GM officially shuts down the Australian plant.\nThe Ford Flex continues to flex its muscles in small segments, Ford says. \"Flex isn't going anywhere,\" said William Mattiace. \"It's a niche product that sells well in certain markets, like California.\"\nThere has been a lot of speculation that the Dodge Durango is dead and will be replaced by the Jeep Grand Wagoneer for model year 2018. FCA isn't telling. Redesigned in 2011, and built in the same Detroit factory as the Jeep Grand Cherokee, the Durango is slated for its second refresh in 2017.\nA new Honda Ridgeline pickup is coming, despite rumors to the contrary.\nrduffer@chicagotribune.com\nTwitter @DufferRobert\n Automotive Industry Trucks, SUVs and Crossovers Scion Jeep Toyota Motor Corp.
