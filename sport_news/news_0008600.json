So he is now in the last year of his four-year deal. \nFrom CBS Sports’s Jason LaCanfora from last month: \n“Pagano’s meeting with [team owner Jim] Irsay was very brief — Irsay intimated he was insulted by the coach’s response to his offer — and talks never progressed, with the owner later publicly exclaiming he would not be doing new deals in 2015 for his head coach or his franchise quarterback, Andrew Luck.” \nPagano’s relationship with Irsay is a bit prickly; his relationship with general manager Ryan Grigson is even more strained. Grigson gives the coach no say over personnel and even makes decisions about lineups sometimes, limiting Pagano’s ability to build a team in his own vision. \n“Those closest to Pagano view it as an eventuality he’s gone; if the team does not reach or win the Super Bowl, he’s out of contract and the likeliest fall guy,” LaCanfora wrote. “And if he does win it all, Pagano’s outside leverage with other teams will never be higher. It’s also nearly impossible for them to imagine a scenario in which he and Grigson are still both there together even if the coach did opt to stay in Indianapolis on a lucrative new deal.” \nBoth Grigson and Pagano denied the beef. \nSaid Grigson last month: “It’s hard enough to win in this league when everyone’s getting along. You’ve got no shot if you’re not. It makes no sense for us to be going in opposite directions. That’s not the case. Trust me. At the end of the day, we always do what’s best for the horseshoe. Period.” \nSaid Pagano: “We have no egos around here. Everybody checks them at the door every day they come to work. Players, coaches, myself, Ryan. The only thing that matters is the ‘shoe and what’s best for the ‘shoe.” Indy wants to win. Bad. Patric Schneider/Associated Press \nAndrew Luck’s status for Sunday is uncertain. \nThe Indianapolis Star’s lead columnist, Gregg Doyel, summed it up pretty well. \n“If you told [the Colts] in August they would go 1-15 in 2015, this is the one they’d want to win,” he wrote Tuesday. \nColts fans went the entire offseason thinking Brady would be suspended through Week 5, making his season debut against their team in their dome. Not the case. \nNot only has Brady been playing out-of-his-mind well, Luck has done the opposite. And to add insult to injury, he has an injured shoulder and his status for Sunday night’s game is somewhat uncertain, though he did practice Wednesday. \nIndianapolis fans have spent the last decade and a half hating New England and its fans, a feeling that has just continued to trend upward and grow more ridiculous this year. \nDeflategate compounded that hatred. That’ll continue Sunday, though this likely won’t be the week the Colts get one over on Brady, Bill Belichick, & Co. \nFrom Doyel: \n“The Colts should give this game the best they’ve got, not because it’s the Patriots but because it’s the next game on the schedule, and the next game is always the most important game. Besides, only a scared team would sit a healthy quarterback. \nOnly a scared team would cheat, too. \nLet’s not be scared around here, OK? Let’s not be anything like the franchise coming to town on Sunday.” Follow Rachel G. Bowers on Twitter @RachelGBowers .
