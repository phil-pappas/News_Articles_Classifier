(AP Photo/Gail Burton) \nBALTIMORE (AP) — Playing what might have been his final game with the Baltimore Orioles, Chris Davis gave the fans an ideal see-you-later gift. \nNot one, but two long balls. \nDavis won the major league home run title with his 46th and 47th of the season, and the four RBIs helped Baltimore close out the season Sunday with a 9-4 victory over the New York Yankees. \nAs Davis’ second drive cleared the wall, manager Buck Showalter smiled knowingly. \n“That’s a little too apropos, the last one,” Showalter said. “As it left the ballpark, I just went, ‘Really?’ \nIt was an emotional afternoon for Davis, who can become a free agent after the season and just might command too much money for the Orioles to afford. \n“I was pretty fired up after I hit the first one,” he said. “The second one, I felt like i was in shock running around the bases.” \nDavis hit a two-run shot off Bryan Mitchell in the fifth and a two-run drive against Caleb Cotham in the eighth, increasing his team-leading RBI total to 117. \n“It’s been fun to have a great seat to watch him,” Showalter said. “He’s really established himself here in Baltimore. I felt very honored to be part of that. It’s never goodbye. It’s see you later.” \nChris Tillman (11-11) gave up two runs and seven hits over 5 1-3 innings to level his lifetime record against New York at 6-6. \nThe victory completed a three-game sweep for the Orioles against a team headed to the playoffs. Despite the loss, the Yankees will host Houston on Tuesday in the AL wild-card game because the Astros missed a chance to play at home by losing to Arizona on Sunday. \nBaltimore went 10-9 against New York this year. After going 13-6 last year, the Orioles have won successive season series against the Yankees for the first time since 1981-82. \nBaltimore finished 81-81 after winning the AL East last year with a 96-66 record. Although they missed the playoffs, the Orioles were in contention for a wild-card berth until the final week and closed with a five-game winning streak to avoid what would have been their first losing season since 2011. \n“This time of year you reach for small victories,” Showalter said. “They didn’t give in. I know there were a lot of teams counting on us to play the way we played. For that, I’m really proud.” \nOrioles third baseman Manny Machado failed to homer in a fifth consecutive game but completed the season as the only player in the majors to participate in all 162 games. \nBaltimore went up 2-0 in the first inning when pending free agent Matt Wieters hit a two-run, two-out single. \nIt was an emotional game for Wieters, too. \n“Every offseason, for the most part, if you’re not a free agent, you think you’ll be back,” Wieters said. “But this is the first offseason where it could be anyone. I loved every second I’ve spent here and I loved everybody in this clubhouse, and I loved all the fans. If it ends today, it was a great time.” \nTRAINER’S ROOM \nOrioles: CF Adam Jones (back) and 2B Jonathan Schoop (hand) watched from the dugout, although manager Buck Showalter said, “Both are capable of doing something for us today.” \nON DECK \nYankees: New York will send right-hander Masahiro Tanaka (12-7, 3.51 ERA) to the mound on Tuesday. \nOrioles: Baltimore heads into an important offseason uncertain if this was the final game as Orioles for pending free agents Wieters, Davis, Darren O’Day and Wei-Yin Chen.
