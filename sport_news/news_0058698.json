He came off the bench as a late replacement for Steve Larkham. \nHis decision to leave Australia and join French side Toulon after the 2011 World Cup seemed to mark the end of his international career, with the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) only selecting home-based players. \nHowever, the ARU changed its rules this year and agreed to allow players with 60 caps or more to rejoin the Wallabies from overseas, giving Giteau a second chance. \nThe utility back did not play against Argentina earlier this year but has noticed the remarkable improvement in the Pumas since they joined the Rugby Championship in 2012 and says the Wallabies will need to be at their best to win. \n\"For us, it’s a semi-final, there’s only really good teams left every game is going to be tough,\" he said. \n\"You can’t underestimate them, we won’t underestimate them. It’s a semi-final, you can’t, it just won’t happen.\" \n(Reporting by Julian Linden.
