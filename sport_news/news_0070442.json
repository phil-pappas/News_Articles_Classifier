But he warned it is \"a high-risk strategy as it links Buhari's fate as president with successful reform of the oil and gas sector.\"\nBuhari previously served as oil minister in the 1970s and head of the petroleum trust fund in the 1990s.\nGarba Shehu, a spokesman for Buhari, confirmed the president will put his name forward as petroleum minister on a long-awaited Cabinet list. Senate president Bukola Saraki confirmed in a message on Twitter that he received the list late Wednesday afternoon, but gave no details of what Buhari has said will be a streamlined Cabinet to save costs.\nBuhari took office at the end of May but said he needed time to ensure designated ministers are free of the corruption that is endemic in this West African nation.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
