Southwest said about 450 of its 3,600 flights had been delayed.\nRepresentatives for Southwest did not say what caused the problem or how long it would take to resolve. Spokesman Brad Hawkins said there was \"absolutely no indication now\" that the problems were the result of hacking.\nThroughout the morning and early afternoon, employees at DIA and other airports were manually writing some airline tickets, officials said.\nA Denver Post reporter who was at the airport Sunday morning said the check-in area was chaotic. Lines stretched well into the central terminal.\nLast month, American Airlines experienced computer problems that prevented passengers from checking in and briefly halted flights on select routes. Airline officials said there was no indication that its system had been hacked.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T19:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:18:06.911+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
