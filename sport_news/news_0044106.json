They just give me so many options for what I can do on the field.\" \n\nCedar Crest knows this offense will be a challenge to stop. \n\n\"He's a great quarterback,” said Horn. “And their receiver is just as good too. Definitely one of the best in the league. Just have to be prepared for what they do and see what we can do.\" \n\nThe Falcons are coming off of last week’s loss putting the team at 2-3 on the season. They’re hoping to bring a winning tradition back to Lebanon. \n\n\"That's going to take time to get us back to where we want to be,” said Cedar Crest head coach, Rob Wildasin. “But we're real close. We're a big victory here or there away from flipping the switch.” \n\nCedar Crest hasn’t been able to beat Manheim Township in over 10 years. The Falcons are hoping to turn their luck around on the road Friday night. \n\n\"I've never beat them,” said Horn. “Something I definitely want to do. Come out and play hard” \n\n“There are a lot of seniors so I know it would mean a lot to the school to go out on a good note,” said Cedar Crest senior right tackle, Alex Flocken. \n\nCedar Crest is looking to use this game as a turning point for the season while Manheim Township is hoping to take care of business and become tied for 1 st place in Section 1. \n\nKick-off is set for 7pm at Manheim Township High School.
