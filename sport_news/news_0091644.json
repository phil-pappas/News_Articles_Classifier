Ranked 3rd in her class, she was awarded the 2010 Patriot League Scholar Athlete of the Year Award. \nThough no one in her family had served in the Navy, the Ruttum clan enjoys watching the Midshipmen parade through downtown to football games and participates in events on the Yard. \nDuring her sophomore year, Ruttum first considered the Naval Academy for college. Attending a weeklong Summer Seminar at the end of her junior year, she discovered she could handle the Academy's rigors, challenges and its regimen. \nRuttum is one of about four female single seat F/A-18 pilots in the U.S. Navy. \n\"The women ahead of me had to deal with a lot more negativity than I have,\" she said. \nShe credits time management she learned at St. Mary's and honed at the Naval Academy for her success on land and in the air. And to younger women who might be inspired by her example, she has some advice: \n\"Our being a woman in this time and day, we have opportunities women in the past fought for us to have — and women in other countries still don't have,\" she said. \"You shouldn't let the perception of prejudice that exists in male-dominated jobs keep you from trying — or flying.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:27:15.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
