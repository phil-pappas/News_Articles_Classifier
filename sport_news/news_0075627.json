\nEach side came into Wednesday's match having collected six points from their first two group stage games, however, it was Real who dominated play to start. \nJese was played in by a precise Toni Kroos through ball in the 26th minute, but his low shot was well saved by PSG keeper Kevin Trapp. \nA pair of Cristiano Ronaldo headers then began a barrage of chances for Real 10 minutes later, but Trapp was again up to the task and kept the scoreline even heading into half-time. \nPSG took more initiative in the second period and created the first quality chance, but Edinson Cavani poked a Thiago Motta cross wide of Keylor Navas' near post from eight yards out. \nRonaldo came closest to opening Real's account in the 72nd minute, with his left-footed shot from just outside the six-yard box going inches wide after a sweeping counter by Los Blancos. \nThat was the best either team could muster, however, before the final whistle put an end to the proceedings. \nElsewhere in Group A, Malmo picked up their first points of the campaign with a 1-0 victory over Shakhtar Donetsk. \nMarkus Rosenberg scored the only goal of the game for Swedish outfit, slotting home from close range. \nKevin De Bruyne's last-minute strike secured a dramatic 2-1 victory for Manchester City against Sevilla. \nA lively first half saw both sides create chances, with Wiflried Bony and Kevin De Bruyne going close for the hosts, while Grzegorz Krychowiak forced Joe Hart into a good stop. \nBut it was Sevilla who took the lead inside 30 minutes with Yevhen Konoplyanka firing first time past Hart after being teed up by Vitolo. \nCity, however, responded well and were level seven minutes later with Rami deflecting Bony's effort into this own net after Raheem Sterling's earlier strike had been saved. \nThe second half was a quieter affair, although the best chances appeared to have fallen to Sevilla, with Kevin Gameiro heading over from inside the box, before wasting another chance from close range shortly after. \nHowever, with the game seemingly set for a draw, up popped De Bruyne in the game's closing moments to fire into the bottom corner and send the Etihad Stadium wild. \nElsewhere in Group D, Juventus dropped their first points of the campaign following a 0-0 draw with Borussia Monchengladbach. \nJuve had the chances to win but were unable to find a way past Yann Sommer, who was called into action on a number of occasions. \nIn Group B, Anthony Martial salvaged a point for Manchester United as his goal secured a 1-1 draw against CSKA Moscow. \nUnited did not help their chances as they gifted CSKA an early penalty, although David De Gea got down low to deny Roman Eremenko. \nSeydou Doumbia, however, was the quickest to react following the miss, pouncing and converting the rebound past the helpless De Gea. \nIt could have been 2-0 shortly after the 30-minute mark if not for the United keeper, who was on hand to pull off a fine stop to deny Ahmed Musa's long-range strike. \nThe English side struggled to create for much of the game but came to life after the hour-mark when Martial drew them level, heading Antonio Valencia's cross in off the post. \nUnited then pushed for a winner for the remainder of the game, but were unable to find a way past Igor Akinfeev for a second time. \nSecond-half goals from Bas Dost and Max Kruse helped Wolfsburg to a 2-0 win over PSV Eindhoven. \nDost was quickest on the scene to fire home the rebound after Josuha Guilavogui's strike was saved by Jeroen Zoet, before Kruse doubled Wolfsburg's advantage with a well-taken header 10 minutes later. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
