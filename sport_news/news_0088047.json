They stepped it up, and [Birmingham] had some guys who made some big plays, but we set them down and didn’t let them beat us.” \nThe Panthers played the Warriors tough all game, but reigning SAA Offensive Player of the Week running back Dayton Winn ran for a 53-yard touchdown with 1:27 left in the third quarter that made the difference in the game. The run was his longest of the season. \n“That won the game,” Buchanan said. “It was a dagger in the second half, but we could’ve been doing that a lot more today.” \nWinn’s touchdown followed an 11-play, 38-yard drive for the Panthers that resulted in a 15-yard touchdown pass from BSU quarterback Austin Martin to wide receiver Jonathan Scaringe, bringing the Panthers within six points following after a missed extra point. \nSenior defensive back Caleb Shannon intercepted two passes in the fourth quarter, with the last one sealing the victory for the Warriors with three seconds left in the game. The first pick by Shannon came off a fourth-quarter Panther drive where Hen \ndrix kicker Steve Crenshaw missed a 41-yard field goal. \nIt was Crenshaw’s third missed field goal of the day. The others he missed were from 37- and 47-yards out. \n“Crenshaw has been battling some tendinitis, so we didn’t kick a whole lot this week, and I think that affected it,” Buchanan said. “Hopefully his knee is feeling better, and we’ll get out here and have a good week of practice and get everything going.” \nDespite Crenshaw’s issues, the defense was able to maintain the lead the Warriors never surrendered all game. \nThe Hendrix defense gave up 301 yards, which is the lowest it has given up since it gave up 235 yards against Lyon College on Sept. 12. \nThe Panther offense had 120 passing yards, which trails the 115 passing yards the Warrior defense gave up against Lyon for the second-lowest total it has given up all season. \nHendrix took care of the ball this game as it didn’t turn the ball over for the second time this season, which helped them come away with the win, as well. \nThe Warrior defense caused four turnovers: one fumble and three interceptions. However, Hendrix didn’t score off the turnovers. It also sacked Birmingham quarterbacks three times. \nWinn continued his strong play, running for 182 yards and one touchdown on 30 carries. On the season, he has 885 yards rushing and 12 touchdowns. He also has 257 all-purpose yards. \nSenior quarterback Seth Peters completed 17 of 26 passes for 163 yards and two touchdowns. \nPanthers junior running back Samir Usman led the Birmingham offense, rushing for 150 yards on 18 carries. He averaged 8.3 yards per carry. \nThe Warriors continue their quest at the SAA title at noon Saturday in Mount Berry, Georgia, against Berry College. After Berry, also unbeaten in the league, beat No. 24 Chicago 24-17 in overtime, the game will be for first place in the conference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:26:50.121+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
