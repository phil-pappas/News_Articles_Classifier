TIM IRELAND — AP Photo \nMIAMI — Joe Philbin has been fired four games into his fourth season as coach of the Miami Dolphins, and one day after a flop on an international stage sealed his fate. \nThe firing came Monday after the Dolphins (1-3) lost their third game in a row and turned in their fourth consecutive lackluster performance. They were beaten Sunday in London by the archrival New York Jets, 27-14. \nMidseason head coaching changes are unusual in the NFL, but few will accuse owner Stephen Ross of impatience. He ignored calls to fire Philbin in December after the Dolphins faded to finish 8-8 for a second successive season. \nBut doubts only grew regarding Philbin's inability to motivate players with his bland demeanor. \n--- \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP-NFL Follow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve-Wine", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:42:02.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
