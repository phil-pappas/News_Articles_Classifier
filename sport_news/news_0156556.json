Nonetheless, the Chargers stayed unbeaten with a 35-14 win over their NVL rivals at Oxford High School . \nTwo takeaways and a pair of late touchdowns by running back Tyler Bailey fueled a second-half surge as the Chargers (3-0) broke free from a 14-14 halftime tie. \n“At halftime, that game’s up in the air,” Ansonia coach Tom Brockett said. “Again, we botched a couple snaps and we fumbled the ball. We did some things to hurt ourselves, and they were making a lot of plays. \n“With the way they were moving the ball on offense, to be able to adjust at halftime and shut them out is a credit to our guys and our defensive staff.” \nThe Chargers withstood a big night from dual-threat quarterback Jaylen Kelley , who ran for 150 yards but was victimized by a Justin Lopez interception in the third quarter. One player later, Bryson Cafaro hit Angel Falero on a 38-yard pass to give Ansonia the lead for good, 21-14. \nBailey helped widen the cushion with touchdown runs of 10 and 1 yard in the fourth quarter. \n“Too many mistakes,” said Seymour coach Tom Lennon , whose Wildcats committed four turnovers, one more than Ansonia. “We turned the ball over in the red zone twice, plus throwing that interception. They’re just too good of a football team to give them that many opportunities. You’ve got to win the turnover battle if you’re going to beat those guys.” \nAdded Kelley: “We were jamming it down their throat in the first half. We were on it. But we just fell apart in the second half.” \nFor much of the first half, Seymour (3-1) gave many of the fans who showed up to the rain-soaked stadium a reason to believe an upset was possible. The Wildcats grabbed a 7-0 lead with 1:09 left in the first quarter, capping a 12-play, 86-yard drive with Kelley’s first of two touchdown runs. Ansonia coughed up the ball on its next possession, but Kelley gave the Chargers the ball right back on a sack and fumble. \nAnsonia made the most of the opportunity, knotting it 7-7 on a pitch to Bailey on fourth-and-goal from the 1. Bailey ran 12 times for 55 yards, while Tajik Bagley had a considerably bigger night with 211 yards rushing (118 yards in the first half) and one touchdown on 26 carries. \n“They were jamming up the inside a little bit,” Brockett said, “so we had to get the ball outside. Obviously we planned on throwing the ball a little bit more, but the weather conditions (weren’t ideal). A couple of those balls in the first half, it got a little scary.” \nThe Chargers didn’t showcase the balanced attack it featured in routs of Kennedy and Derby, but it didn’t matter. Bagley and Bailey were enough. In three weeks, the Chargers have outscored their opponents 125-14. \ndbonjour@ctpost.com; @DougBonjour \nANSONIA 0 14 7 14 — 35 \nSEYMOUR 7 7 0 0 — 14 \nS — Jaylen Kelley 19 run (Rocco Vertuccio kick) \nA — Tyler Bailey 1 run (Bryson Cafaro kick) \nA — Tajik Bagley 6 run (Cafaro kick) \nS — Kelley 9 run (Vertuccio kick) \nA — Angel Falero 38 pass Cafaro (Cafaro kick) \nA — Bailey 10 run (Cafaro kick) \nA — Bailey 1 run (Cafaro kick) \nRecords: Ansonia 3-0; Seymour 3-1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:43:18.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
