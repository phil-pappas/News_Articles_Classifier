Or Hal McRae upending Willie Randolph during the 1977 Royals-Yankees ALCS.\nAnd this one had all the qualities of a sports injury that won't soon be forgotten - like Rose running over Ray Fosse at home plate, or Lawrence Taylor snapping Joe Theismann's leg on \"Monday Night Football.\"\nSo the debate raged on, with current and former players from all around the majors weighing in on social media and television.\n\"I hate the fact that people keep saying he plays the game hard. Everybody on the field plays the game hard,\" said ESPN analyst Alex Cora, a middle infielder during his playing days. \"There's a way you should play the game, and this is not the way.\n\"There's no way you can do that,\" he added. \"If Chase Utley doesn't retire and he's playing next year, he's going to get drilled. He's going to get one in the ribs.\"\nBy now, most everyone with any interest has seen a replay of the violent collision that turned Game 2 of the NL Division Series in Los Angeles' favor.\nWith the Dodgers trailing by a run in the seventh inning, Utley barreled into Tejada at second base to make sure the Mets could not complete a double play that would have kept them ahead. Utley went in late and hard, crashing into Tejada's legs and flipping the shortstop head over heels.\nThe tying run scored, Tejada was wheeled off with a fractured fibula and the Dodgers rallied for three more runs in the inning and went on to a 5-2 victory that evened the best-of-five series at one apiece.\n\"I feel terrible that he was injured. I had no intent to hurt him whatsoever,\" Utley said. \"You have to try and break up the double play. That's winning baseball.\"\nBut did it cross the line?\nTakeout slides are an accepted part of the game, always have been. The general guideline is they're within the rules as long as a runner doesn't go so far out of the baseline that he can't reach second base.\nBut there's also an etiquette to it because the later the slide, the more dangerous it can be. And Utley went in late, turning his body beyond the bag to wipe out Tejada rather than attempting to touch second base. Tejada was in a vulnerable position with his back to the oncoming runner after reaching behind to glove an off-target toss from Murphy and trying to make a spinning pivot.\nA comment in the Official Baseball Rules to Rule 5.09 (a) (13) indicates umpires could have called an inning-ending double play if they determined Utley interfered with Tejada.\nThey did not.\n\"The objective of this rule is to penalize the offensive team for deliberate, unwarranted, unsportsmanlike action by the runner in leaving the baseline for the obvious purpose of crashing the pivot man on a double play, rather than trying to reach the base,\" the comment reads. \"Obviously this is an umpire's judgment play.\"\nAnd it's a fine line between what's considered out of bounds and what is a clean, hard-nosed play.\n\"I don't think anyone knows exactly what that line is,\" Mets outfielder Curtis Granderson said.\nMajor League Baseball executive Joe Torre said he'll review the play to see if it warrants any discipline.\nUtley, meanwhile, was asked what constitutes a dirty slide.\n\"I think cleats high, hitting the guy before you hit the ground,\" he answered.\nAfter seeing the replay, did he think this one was dirty?\n\"It depends who you're talking to,\" he said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T01:29:50.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
