But they have taken decidedly different approaches to winning. Whereas the fast-starting Rangers lead the NHL with 10 first-period goals, the Islanders are tied for the league lead with 11 third-period goals.\nWere this pattern to hold, which approach is more likely to sustain success? Jumping out fast would seem to be extremely beneficial considering NHL games are typically low-scoring. But having extra gas in the tank, like the Isles with their young legs, can spur comebacks and seal victories.\nENLARGE It turns out that dominating either period is almost equally advantageous. Since 2005-06, the teams that lead the NHL in first-period goals—including last year’s Rangers—have a combined point percentage of .658. That’s just barely better than the .651 percentage of the teams that led hockey in third-period scoring, according to Stats, LLC.\nLast year, the Rangers rode their hot starts to a league-best 53-22-7 record (.689), which was only the third-best mark among teams that led the NHL in early scoring over the past decade. In 82-game seasons, the 2009-10 Washington Capitals were best in posting a 54-15–13 (.738) record. That Capitals team also led the league in third-period goals.\nBut neither the Rangers and Oscar Lindberg (team-high three first-period goals) nor the Isles and John Tavares (two third-period goals) have sustained their scoring throughout games. Each squad has scored more goals in its best period than in its other two periods combined. The Rangers are tied for second-worst with just two third-period goals,while the Isles’ two first-period goals are tied for sixth-worst.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KW587_Tan_NS_NS_20151021210955.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T05:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:11:50.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
