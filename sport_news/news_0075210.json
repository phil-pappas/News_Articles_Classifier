We knew they were going to play tight defence, but we stuck to our game plan and eventually popped a few in. That was the key.”\nThe Jets are 2-0 to start the season, with games scheduled Monday against the New York Islanders and Tuesday against the New York Rangers to finish off this four-game road trip.\nAfter a sluggish period in Thursday's season opener against the Boston Bruins, the Jets were determined to come out of the gate quicker and that's exactly what they did, setting the stage for another three-goal outburst in the middle stanza.\nGoalie Michael Hutchinson was solid in his first start of the season, making 20 saves and was aided by the fact the Jets did a great job of limiting the second-chance opportunities.\n“It came together for us a lot better,” said Jets defenceman Tyler Myers. “We were quicker on the puck, quicker on the man. The whole game we limited their chances. Our coverage was good.”\nFor the second time in as many nights, it was Scheifele that opened the scoring with one of his trademark wristers and though this one may have changed direction off Devils defenceman David Schlemko, the quick release was once again key.\n“Your shot is something you can always work on,” said Scheifele, who is showcasing his potential of being a 20-goal scorer in his third NHL season. “I'm definitely happy that they're going in.”\nJets rookie Nikolaj Ehlers chipped in his first NHL point on Scheifele's marker and was close to potting the first goal of his career but was robbed on a breakaway chance.\nPerhaps the most significant play for Ehlers was the determination he showed on the back-check in the first period when his hustle prevented a good scoring chance.\n“That's the biggest single question here about this young man coming into training camp. It wasn't where his skill level is at,” said Jets head coach Paul Maurice. “It's can he play well enough defensively? He's shown, really from Day 1, that he has a real interest in it. He understands that he needs to do that to play at this level and he's made some good defensive plays.”\nThe Devils lone goal was a power-play goal credited to former Jets forward Jiri Tlusty, but was actually shot in by defenceman Jacob Trouba, who was trying to clear the loose puck into the corner and not into his own net.\n“It's much easier to shake it off when you win, that's for sure,” said Trouba. “It happens. I'd rather it happens in a game that we win than a game we lose by a goal. I'm pretty good at shaking it off.”\nAnother important trait the Jets have shown in the early going is their ability to show some resolve and restore order when the opposition pushes back.\nCase in point, after the Devils had cut the deficit to 2-1 on Friday, Ladd buried a one-timer on a slick pass from Mathieu Perreault.\nThat's precisely the way the Jets responded after David Pastrnak scored early in the third period to momentarily make it a one-goal game in Thursday's 6-2 victory.\n“Better game for us,” said Maurice. “The first period, even at zeroes, we had to accept how the game was going to be played. I thought we did a good job with that. Much tighter. And then, again, a real good kind of jump-off second period where we got it going for a little bit. Solid.\n“We’ve still got lots of things to work on, there’s nothing to get really overly excited about. But winning is good in this league and we were better. We were a better hockey team than we were (Thursday).”\nAt this stage of the season, that's the goal for each and every team in the league, to be better than they were the day before.\nKen.wiebe@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter.com/WiebeSunSports\nWINNIPEG JETS\nWinnipeg Jets win second straight game to start NHL season\nBy Ken Wiebe , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Friday, October 09, 2015 09:42 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 09, 2015 11:44 PM EDT\nNEWARK, N.J. -- Two for two.\nThe Winnipeg Jets were carried offensively by their big guns and got a steady goaltending performance from Michael Hutchinson as they earned a 3-1 victory over the New Jersey Devils on Friday before an announced crowd of 14,579 at the Prudential Center.\nBy improving to 2-0 on the season, the Jets have assured themselves of finishing no worse than .500 on this four-game road trip that also includes games against the New York Islanders and New York Rangers.\nIt also puts the Jets in position to build on the strong start and make it a great trip.\nWhile many have been forecasting a tough campaign ahead for both the Boston Bruins and Devils, the Islanders and Rangers are expected to be near the top of the Eastern Conference, so the challenges should get tougher in the days ahead.\nThe Jets plan to take Saturday off and will play their next game on Monday afternoon at Barclays Center against the New York Islanders.\nAbout the author Ken Wiebe Ken Wiebe's Blog Follow Ken Wiebe on Twitter Other Stories Burmistrov has interesting return to NHL\nNEWARK, N.J. — Alex Burmistrov was all over the place as he made his return to the NHL after a two-year absence.\n0\nBalanced scoring leads Winnipeg Jets to season-opening blowout over Bruins\nBOSTON – The Winnipeg Jets showed up late to the party, but it didn't prevent them from celebrating on opening night.\n0\nSee more from Ken Wiebe »\n Hockey 0\nFantasy Fare: Three days of surprises 0\nEdmonton Oilers' Connor McDavid skill-set yet to include faceoffs\nWinnipeg Jets win second straight game to start NHL season 0\n ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://twitter.com/@WiebeSunSports", "http://blogs.canoe.ca/thebrawl/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-10T09:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T20:32:38.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
