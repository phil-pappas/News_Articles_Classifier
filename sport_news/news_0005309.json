Present were from left, front row, Albert Chappell, Don B. Harmon, Jimmy Jones, Dale White, Doug Burns, Sonny Morton, Jerry Howell, Assistant Coach Brud Spickard and Ann Spickard. Second row, Dane Pilkington, Roy Vick, Sonny Lee, Joe Graham, Jimmy Compton and Wilson Barnett. The team’s head coach was Jim Cartwright. Cartwright, and assistant Howard Jackson, are both deceased. \nThe players shared the pregame locker room with the Lions before the game. Coach Spickard was provided an opportunity to give the current Lions some pregame words. The 1959 captains Sonny Morton and Sonny Lee went to midfield for the coin toss with the 2015 captains. “We certainly was pleased with the donation by the 159 team members,” said Central head coach Howard Stone. “We will use it to purchase kettlebells for our weight program.” \nFour members of the 1959 team signed with Southeastern Conference teams. Richard Lemay, a junior tackle, played for Vanderbilt University and also the Washington Redskins. Junior quarterback Jerry Hines and running back Regen Peebles signed with Alabama and coach Paul (Bear) Bryant. Sophomore quarterback Hal Wantland signed with Tennessee and became the school’s first quarterback when the Volunteers switched from the single-wing to the T-formation. Wantland was drafted by the Miami Dolphins. Courtesy photo by correspondent Ric Beu).
