Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports   7:10p ET \nTristan Thompson is still not in training camp with the Cavaliers , and he may be away from the team for the foreseeable future. \nThompson is in a financial dispute with the franchise, and is seeking a max contract (either over three or five years) that the team has been unwilling to give him thus far. He could have played out the season on a one-year qualifying offer before becoming an unrestricted free agent next summer, but the deadline to do so has passed, so the only leverage he has at the moment is to remain on the sidelines. \nESPN's Brian Windhorst doesn't believe this will come to a resolution anytime soon. \n“I actually believe it will probably go months,\" he said while appearing on Zach Lowe's podcast ( via PBT ). \"This will go well into the regular season.” \nIt may take an intervention -- perhaps from LeBron James -- in order for some movement on the issue to take place. James has already urged both Thompson and the team to get a deal done , though he has yet to take sides in the situation. James shares an agent with Thompson, and can wield as much power within the Cavaliers franchise as he chooses. \nIf Thompson or the team continue to hold their respective lines, James forcing his hand may be the only way that we see a resolution anytime soon.
