(AP) — The Buffalo Sabres placed defenseman Matt Donovan on waivers Tuesday and returned rookie defenseman Brendan Guhle to his Canadian junior team. \nDonovan will be assigned to the Sabres’ American Hockey League affiliate in Rochester if he clears waivers Wednesday. The three-year NHL veteran was a healthy scratch for Buffalo’s first three games. He signed with the Sabres in free agency in July. \nGuhle was re-assigned to Prince Albert of the Western Hockey League after recovering from an upper-body injury sustained in a preseason game against Toronto two weeks ago. The 18-year-old was Buffalo’s second-round pick in the June draft. \nThe Sabres (1-2) are coming off a 4-2 win over Columbus on Monday. They open a two-game trip at Florida on Thursday night.
