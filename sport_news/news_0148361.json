New York already held the best winning percentage of any franchise in Major League Baseball, along with the most division titles, the most league pennants, the most World Series victories and the most playoff appearances.With just 7,567 losses to go with their 10,000 wins, the Yankees' all-time win percentage climbed to 56.9 percent.Only the San Francisco Giants, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, St. Louis Cardinals, Atlanta Braves, Cincinnati Reds and Pittsburgh Pirates have won more games all-time than the Yankees. Each of those franchises, though, was established before 1900, while the Yankees were founded in 1903. \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio. All rights reserved.
