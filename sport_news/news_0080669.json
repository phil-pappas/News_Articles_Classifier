But the Nets wound up hanging onto him, wanting to see what the athletic 6-foot-8 forward could do in training camp.\n“It’s definitely a daily grind, coming in here and putting in the work,” Miller said. “Come early, stay late … but I’m still happy to be here, so I don’t worry about the extra stuff.\n“I just do my work, put my work in and get an opportunity here, a legit one.”\nIt’s been a long and winding road for Miller, one of 14 siblings ranging in age from 31 to 13, with Miller — who turns 23 next month — right in the middle.\n“It was awesome,” a smiling Miller said of his eight sisters and five brothers. “It was kind of like having your own gang. You never have to worry about anything.\n“I’ve got a lot of sisters, so I learned a lot about women, and I learned a lot from my big brothers.”\nHe credited two of his older brothers — Ricky and Pat — with helping him grow as a basketball player by beating up on him on the courts growing up just north of Chicago in Waukegan, Ill.\n“They were really big where I’m from,” he said. “They were great players, and they wound up both going to college, and they used to kind of beat me down. But I was younger, and not really tall yet.”\nTheir work with him had its benefits. Miller became a high-school phenom and one of many top recruits to go to Baylor over the past several years. After one season, in which he was named the Big 12’s co-rookie of the year, he declared for the 2012 NBA Draft, going to the Nuggets with the No. 38 pick.\nMiller then spent two seasons in Denver as a bit player before being released last October. He spent last season mostly playing in the D-League — outside of brief stints with the Kings and Pistons.\nNow Miller is just hoping he can get a chance with the Nets. But he keeps things in perspective by thinking about how things worked out for fellow Baylor alum Isaiah Austin, whose career was cut short prior to last year’s draft when he was diagnosed with Marfan syndrome.\n“I’m here,” he said. “I know a lot of other guys around the world want to be here. If my friend Isaiah had even one opportunity to be on a training-camp roster, he’d be happy. That’s how I look at it.“Like I said, I’m just happy to be here. I’m not looking at it in a negative way. There’s a lot of guys who want to be in my position, so that’s the way I look at it. I take things into perspective.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brooklyn nets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:18:51.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
