Division St., featuring at least five dishes from the cookbook. For more information, contact the restaurant at 971-229-0571.\nFor a deeper dive into the Zahav cookbook, including its political implications, this Helen Rosner review is well worth a read.\nBye bye brunchie\nNed Ludd, the wood-fired restaurant at 3925 N.E. Martin Luther King Jr., will discontinue its under-the-radar brunch after service Sunday, Nov. 1, according to a press release.\nThe pleasing brunch, which typically never had a line, usually involved an interesting coffee cake, good French toast, some smoked trout hash and maybe a mimosa or two. It was a personal favorite.\nThe restaurant also plans to drop its Pizza Mondays, which will be best remembered for launching the raucous pizza pop-up P.R.E.A.M. Drop by Oct. 26 for a party with special pies and appearances from previous Pizza Monday chefs.\nBrunch and pizza nights will still be available for private buyouts.
