The crash caused multiple injuries including a broken rib, a punctured lung, fractured vertebrae and a fractured jaw. \nThe shock of the incident could have sent the Blackhawks program reeling. Instead, coach Lisa Roelke says, it had the exact opposite effect. \nAnd as the Southwestern Wisconsin Conference runner-up Blackhawks prepare for the WIAA tournament, which opens tonight with a home match against Sauk Prairie, Roelke said her team is on a mission. \n“This unit has become closer together. It showed us that in the blink of an eye, it can all change,” Roelke said. “It’s made us appreciate each other as a family.” \nAfter the crash, the girls on the team immediately rose up in support for Esser, a key part of the Blackhawks’ starting lineup. They wrote her uniform number (6) on their wrists to symbolize her presence, even when she couldn’t be there. \nIn the first match following Esser’s accident, the girls wore purple ribbons, Esser’s favorite color. \n“When we all found out that she would be OK, it kind of turned into ‘we want to do well for her. … We’re all still OK and behind her on her way to recovery,’” junior captain Taylor Briehl said. \n“We’ve learned to appreciate each other, knowing that something can be taken away from you in a simple instance,” senior captain Kylie Hoffman said. \nLast week, River Valley wrapped up a stellar 27-7 regular season. Excluding five losses in Saturday tournaments, the Blackhawks have lost just two matches, both against conference champion Platteville. \nRoelke hopes the losses to Platteville is part of a break with tradition: Each of the last two seasons, River Valley beat the Hillmen during the regular season only to lose to them in regional finals. \n“Now we feel like it’s our turn,” Roelke said. \nThe Blackhawks are led by their three captains: Hoffman, an outside hitter, Briehl, a setter, and senior Jerrica Hood, the libero. They have been playing together since sixth grade, when they joined the same club team. They also play basketball and softball together at River Valley, and spend weekend free time together. Their long friendships have given them strong chemistry and understanding of how to best motivate the others. \n“Being together, you get more comfortable. You know when you can push other people more than others,” Briehl said. \nWhile Roelke says she pushes her captains as hard as possible in practice, during matches she has enough confidence in the group to take a step back and let them play. \nThe Blackhawks got some extra inspiration during their final regular-season match against Lancaster on Thursday, when Esser sat on the bench with the team for the first time since her accident. \n“I remember I made a mistake and I smiled at her and she smiled at me,” Hood said. “We have this relationship in the back row, and it was really nice to have her [there].” \nRegional schedule in Scoreboard.
