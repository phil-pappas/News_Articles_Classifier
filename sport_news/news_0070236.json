Two goals apiece for Santi Cazorla and substitute Paco Alcácer put the 2008 and 2012 tournament winners through to France next summer here on Friday. Cazorla broke the deadlock better three minutes before half-time. After Jonathan Joubert saved Pedro Rodriguez’s shot from a Juanfran cross, the rebound fell for the Arsenal midfielder to ram it into the net. Luxembourg worked hard in their pressing to ensure Spain couldn’t cut loose but the more the match went on, the more a second goal seemed imminent given the hosts’ domination. In the 67th minute a Cesc Fabregas through ball left Alcacer alone against Joubert and he slid home easily. Then, with ten minutes left, Alba hared towards the byline to rescue a Pedro pass and was rewarded when the Valencia striker touched the ensuing delivery into an open net. Spain’s procession was complete when Nolito invited Cazorla to let fly from 20 metres, which he did with some aplomb.
