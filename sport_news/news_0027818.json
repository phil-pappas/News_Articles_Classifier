It might seem about as far-fetched for Tom Izzo's 21st team as was the idea of a Final Four for his 20th, but he's more optimistic about these Spartans than he was a year ago.\n\"I've got a really good team, I think,\" Izzo, whose team was ranked No. 13 Thursday in the USA TODAY preseason coaches poll, said during Big Ten basketball media day. \"Better than I thought it would be. I think it's got to be my best shooting team. And I've got depth and I've got athletes.\"\nAnd questions, too, starting at power forward, where possible starter Marvin Clark is out until close to the start of the season as his left foot heals from surgery on a broken bone. The defense and rebounding aren't where Izzo wants them, but that was true for much of last season with a team that made an improbable March run to his seventh Final Four.\nSo if the Spartans improve during this season as much as Izzo believes they can, his second national title might not be out of the question. He has been to five Final Fours since winning it in 2000.\n\"It is starting to wear on me, that I can get there and can't win another one,\" Izzo said. \"So that's the new motto for this year, we've got to take it to one more level. We're like the 3.5 student that wants to be a 4.0 student.\"\nIzzo repeated that last season's team was his least talented to reach the Final Four, a year after a team he thought had a great chance to win it all was stopped in the Elite Eight. The 2013-14 team's loss to Connecticut in the East Regional final in New York is a regret that can be traced to \"some injuries and bad coaching,\" Izzo said.\n\"Because we did get outplayed, for a variety of reasons,\" he said. \"But I really thought that year we had a chance to win it again.\"\nSenior center Matt Costello said the Spartans were in the gym about a week after last season's national semifinal loss to eventual national champ Duke and said: \"Man, that wasn't good enough.\"\n\"That's what we've got to do, because it's kind of a letdown if we don't,\" Costello said of winning it all. \"We've been to enough Final Fours, coach has been to enough Final Fours. We need a national championship. We want to stamp our name in the record books for good.\"\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nLess time demands on players? 'It's a joke,' Izzo says\n■ Izzo OK with Swanigan: Things have worked out well for Izzo on the recruiting trail, with four 2016 commitments making up a class some rank No. 1 nationally, and the pursuit continues for the top-rated player in the class, Josh Jackson.\nIzzo lost a 2015 player in the off-season, though, when big man Caleb Swanigan of Ft. Wayne, Ind., originally committed to the Spartans, changed his mind and picked Purdue. Izzo made it clear Thursday he holds no ill will toward Swanigan or Purdue coach Matt Painter.\n\"Nah. You know, I called Matt that night,\" Izzo said. \"It was nothing to do with Matt. I like Swanigan, I really do. I think it was stupid how it was handled, and kind of goofy. It wasn't Matt's fault. And I'm not even sure it was all Swanigan's fault, there were people involved. But you know what? The one good thing about getting older, seriously, that has not bothered me one iota.\"\nIzzo said Magic Johnson told him a few days after Swanigan switched: \"Get guys you want, that want to be there. You've won with those kind of guys your whole life, get guys that want to be there.\"\n\"I wish him all the luck except when he plays us,\" Izzo said of Swanigan.\nSwanigan's exit from this class opened another scholarship, which will be filled by recent commitment and consensus top-15 prospect Miles Bridges.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nKentucky, North Carolina share No. 1 in preseason men's basketball poll\n■ Notebook: Costello got engaged this summer to his girlfriend of two years, and they are scheduled to be married in July. … Izzo said he is experimenting often with various lineups in practice, and with Clark out he is using mostly Javon Bess and freshman Deyonta Davis at power forward, with some Colby Wollenman as well.\nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com.
