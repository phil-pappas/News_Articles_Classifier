Golson is turnover-free this season. \nTALLAHASSEE | Jimbo Fisher was a coach conflicted after ninth-ranked Florida State defeated Louisville 41-21 on Saturday. \nHe was proud of his team, especially on offense, for emerging from a lackluster first half to score 35 points in the second. \nQuarterback Everett Golson remains turnover-free this season and threw for 372 yards, his highest single-game total as a Seminole and his second-highest in his college career. Tailback Dalvin Cook had 135 of his 163 yards in the second half and scored twice. \nBut there remain too many nagging issues for FSU (6-0, 4-0) as it stands at the halfway point of the season against a schedule that will become more difficult with games at Georgia Tech, Clemson and Florida. Despite being unbeaten and returning to the top 10 of the Associated Press poll on Sunday, Fisher still isn’t sure about his team’s identity or how far it will go. \n“I’m excited we won the game, I’m excited we came back,” he said. “But I’m not happy. I’m not mad at them. But I’m not happy with them.” \nAmong his issues: \n■ An offensive line that includes eight freshmen or sophomores on the two-deep depth chart — and three freshmen among the four tackles — continues to struggle. Golson was sacked five times and had to throw the ball away while running for his life five other times. Of the seven false start penalties FSU was flagged with against the Cardinals, five were on linemen, including two on left tackle Roderick Johnson. \n■ The FSU defense has been letting teams off the hook in the past three games. Louisville, Miami and Wake Forest combined to convert 24-of-46 third downs (.522). Louisville converted four third downs in which there were 10 or more yards to go, including a third-and-19. Twice, quarterback Lamar Jackson audibled into running plays on third-and-long, and the Cardinals made the first down both times. \n■ The secondary, the team’s defensive strength at the beginning of the season, is banged up. Starting nickel back Trey Marshall tore a bicep muscle against Louisville and is likely to miss six weeks. Strong safety Nate Andrews has been slowed with a severe bone bruise. FSU was forced to use a former walk-on, Javien Elliott, against Louisville, and he responded with a key interception in the third quarter. \nCornerback Jalen Ramsey is having an All-America-caliber season but can’t do it by himself. \nThere was an expectation before the season that FSU would struggle in some areas, especially on offense. Twenty of the 27 players listed on the offensive depth chart are freshmen or sophomores (both redshirt and true) and the only seniors are Golson and punter Cason Beatty. \nThe wide receivers struggled to get open (which could explain some of the pass protection issues) and have dropped their share of passes. However, Kermit Whitfield has caught 18 passes for 267 yards in the last two games and the group blocks well downfield. \nThere is a bit more experience on defense, but more than half of the depth chart (15-of-29) is composed of freshmen or sophomores. \nHowever, Fisher made it plain that he will not factor inexperience into the equation. \n“Youth is not an excuse,” he said. “There is no age limit to being good if you want to have the focus and the poise.” \nIn the end, Fisher said a team of talented players hasn’t yet learned how to elevate that talent — yet. \n“We can’t let being good get in the way of trying to be elite,” he said. “Get a little better and go on to the next week. Hopefully it’s enough. Don’t get caught up in the results, don’t get caught up in scoreboards. Forget all those things and live in the moment.” \nDefensive end Demarcus Walker of Jacksonville said the team hears its coach. \n\"We’re just playing team football,\" he said. \"We’re playing like we have nothing to lose. We don’t think about winning or losing. We just go out there and play football. Play the next play.” \nGarry Smits: (904) 359-4362", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:15:51.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
