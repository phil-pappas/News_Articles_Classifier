Clinton took a 14-0 lead, before the Bulldogs knotted things back up. Clinton led 21-14 at halftime, before it shredded Summerfield’s defense in the second half. Mathew Sexton paced the Redskins (7-0, 5-0 TCC) attack, scoring four touchdowns on the ground and racking up 258 rushing yards. Sexton’s teammate Noah Poore found the end zone twice and totaled 138 yards rushing. Clinton allowed just eight points in the second hal. The Redskins had a third-down efficiency of 70 percent in the game (7-for-10), despite only passing twice. Clinton will look to remain unbeaten in Week 8, as it travels to TCC foe Britton Deerfield. Madison 40, Whitmore Lake 12: At Madison Twp., Madison racked up 466 yards on the ground in a convincing Tri-County Conference win against Whitmore Lake. With key players Connor Mellon and Donovan Slates sidelined due to injuries, Colby Weitenhagen filled the offensive gap, scoring three touchdowns and totaling 223 yards rushing. Chris Pharion filled duties behind center and added a 59-yard TD run among his 80 total yards rushing. Tyrell Love and David Miller also added scores for Madison (4-3, 3-2 TCC), while Love had 123 yards on the ground. Defensively, Madison allowed just 253 yards of total offense to Whitmore Lake, which failed to score outside of the second quarter. Madison will host Summerfield next week for a key TCC matchup.

The Tigers held Ida scoreless in the first quarter, but couldnt stop Bugg from crossing in a goal line halfway through the second quarter. That score opened up the floodgates for Ida, as it scored twice more before Hudson could find the scoreboard in the third quarter.

The Panthers got on the board late in the second quarter when Brett Burris found Drew Rokita with a deep pass that resulted in a 60-yard touchdown. Grass Lake found the end zone again before the half, and at the intermission it was Grass Lake on top 29-8. The Warriors picked up where they left off, jumping to a 50-14 lead, before Addison could muster any offense in the second half. Quincy SeGraves scampered into the end zone with 48 seconds left in the game to make the final score 50-20. SeGraves had another big game for the Panthers with 112 yards on 21 attempts plus a score.
