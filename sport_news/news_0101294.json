Sterling scored a hat-trick, Bony grabbed the other two and De Bruyne was influential throughout. \nDe Bruyne said: \"More people will look at us because we have lost two great players on the attacking front, but I think the other ones are really good players. \n\"Maybe we don't have the experience of the other ones but I think we are doing really well together and the more games we will get the more we will know each other and hopefully the better we will do. \n\"It is always a blow when you miss them but we need to maintain our level and try to win without them. \n\"It is not an excuse to say at the Etihad we may lose four games because they are not there. If you want to win titles you have to do with the players what you have. Sometimes it is maybe more difficult but you have to try to win these games.\" \nAnother player who might have been asked to step up in such circumstances is Samir Nasri but the Frenchman experienced discomfort on his return from a hamstring injury against Bournemouth. \nThe 28-year-old replaced De Bruyne in the 62nd minute but was troubled in the latter stages and only played until the end because City had used all their substitutes. He now looks doubtful for Wednesday's Champions League clash with Sevilla. \nManager Manuel Pellegrini said: \"Nasri had a problem with his hamstring. I think it will be very difficult for him (to play Wednesday). \n\"Unfortunately we knew that he was feeling something after we made the third change, but he didn't run too much. He stayed in the middle so we'll see in the next day what happens with him.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T20:18:58.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
