Fahad is a talented lifter and I am happy that he claimed the gold today,” said Hasani. \nThe host nation added one more bronze on Sunday when Salim al Auladthani won the third place in the -93kg junior category. \nWith just a day to go for the conclusion of Oman's campaign at the championship, the hosts' medals tally has risen to 11, including four gold, three silver and four bronze. \nWith the national coach expecting a few more medals on Monday, the 18-member team's performance has been 'satisfying' in Hasani's words. \n“Four of the five sub-junior team lifters have fetched medals so far and three of the six from the junior team have been on the podium. It is encouraging to see the young lifters do so well and it augurs well for the future of powerlifting in the country,” said Hasani.
