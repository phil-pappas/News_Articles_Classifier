From there, the Ephs went on a season-crushing four-game losing streak. \nIt's something the players and coaches are conscious about. \n\"The entire culture of the team is different this year,\" Williams defensive end Jack Ryan said. \"We put in a great off-season of work from January through the summer. This year, we're trying not to let the Trinity game be the damper on the season that it's been the last four years I've been here. \n\"The last couple of years, it's been a tough loss at Trinity and we kind of spiral and get caught by Bates. This year we've refocused. We know what we have to do to beat Bates.\" \nThe Bobcats visit Farley-Lamb Field for the Ephs' home opener of 2015. The kickoff is set for 1 p.m. Williams brings a 1-1 record into the game while coach Mark Harriman's Bobcats are 0-2. Bates, however, has won four straight against Williams. \nLast year, Bates scored a fourth-quarter touchdown to complete a 19-12 comeback victory. The Ephs last win over Bates in Williamstown came on Oct. 10, 2009, when the Ephs scored a 31-7 win. The last Eph victory came the next year, when the Bobcats lost 41-0. Williams has not tasted victory against the Bobcats since. \n\"Our focus is winning the Bates game,\" said Williams coach Aaron Kelton. \"The reason is we know that we gave the game [to Trinity] Saturday by not executing. We talked about consistency early in the year and we just weren't consistent. We'd relax in the red zone and weren't able to make a play. Advertisement \n\"We need to make plays throughout the game.\" \nThe Bobcats come to Williamstown off another winless start. However, their win at home last year against Williams started them on a 4-2 finish to wrap up at 4-4. It was the third consecutive season Bates had finished .500 or better, and the win over Williams got them rolling each time. \nBates is unlike any team Williams will play this year. The Bobcats run with two slotbacks and quarterback Patrick Dugan out of the pistol formation. The Bobcats will run a lot of option, and don't throw the ball very much. In fact, the Bobcats are 10th in NESCAC in passing. \n\"It's just assignment football. You can't try to make plays this week. You just have to do what you're told,\" said Ryan. \"It's frustrating. Sometimes you'll see the ball running inside of you and you know you can't go to make the tackle because the very next play, they might keep it outside.\" \nKelton said the triple option, similar to what he ran when he was a player at Springfield College, is unlike any other offense in NESCAC. \n\"The difficulty is there's no one like them so you don't have anything to compare them to as you're teaching your kids,\" said the Eph head coach. \"For us, it's difficult early in the year because in our first four games, all four of those teams are different teams. You're preparing different types of game plans. There's no 'same as' stuff, which kids can get better at.\" \nThe good news for Williams this week is that there were no injuries last week that might keep a player out of the lineup for the season. The head coach did say that a number of players were \"dinged up,\" and would be game-time decisions. \nThe most frustrating part of last week's 24-0 loss to Trinity was what Kelton said was his team's inability to put \"the ball in the box,\" meaning not scoring touchdowns. The Ephs had a few chances to score before the game got out of hand, but couldn't crack the Trinity end zone. \n\"It's always frustrating when you can move the ball but you just can't convert,\" said Williams tackle Vincent Molinari. \"We spoke about it a lot with the players and the coaches. We know what we need to do this week. \n\"We need to come out hard and we need to play physical on the goal line. I think that's what we'll do.\" Contact Howard Herman at 413-496-6253.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:54:58.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
