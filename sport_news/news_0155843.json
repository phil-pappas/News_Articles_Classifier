Videos Read the latest Jaguars coverage \nClose, but not quite there. \nThat was the update from Jaguars tight end Julius Thomas about his right hand before practice Wednesday, when he caught passes for the first time since being injured Aug. 14 and having surgery Sept. 1. \nThomas has not been cleared to play in Sunday’s game at Tampa Bay. \n“I’m still limited,” he said. “I don’t know if [playing] is going to be an option yet.” \nThomas will be guided by the Jaguars medical team’s advice. \n“I’m really going to lean on those guys and follow their plan so hopefully nothing else happens,” he said. \nThomas did two weeks of side-field work and one week of practice that included running routes in team drills but not catching a pass. He still has not gone through a full workout. \nThe most likely projection is that Thomas will sit out the Buccaneers game and debut at home against Houston in Week 6. \nThomas stopped wearing a cast in practice, but he wouldn’t reveal what kind of contraption he will have on the hand. \n“I will definitely have to put some stuff on it to try and practice and then it will be about getting a feel for things and adjusting and doing the things I’ll have to do to protect myself out there,” he said. \nThomas said there isn’t a specific hurdle — one practice, back-to-back workouts, a week of activity — he must clear before playing in a game. \n“It’s going to be a continuous process working with the doctors,” he said. “I’ll work my back and if the doctors are confident with the things I’m doing, they’ll let me do a little more and challenge me. It’s going to be a day-by-day situation, really.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:47:49.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
