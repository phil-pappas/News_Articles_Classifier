Brudzinski and the family of the late Rob Lytle will be in attendance while Woodson’s availability is still unknown. Woodson's Oakland Raiders are on a bye this week. \n“It’s huge for the community,” said former Ross athletic director Art Bucci, one of the organizers of the homecoming events. “These are guys who have represented themselves well, great role models and are going to come back and give back to us. \n“The community should be very proud of what they produced. They produced these young men to represent us.” \nAlso attending the homecoming festivities will be Shawn McCarthy, a Ross 1986 graduate who went on to play quarterback and punt at Purdue and was a punter in the NFL. His 93-yard punt as a member of the New England Patriots in 1991 remains the third-longest punt in league history. \nThe school will be holding a pep rally that the alumni will attend at 2:05 p.m. Friday followed by a pre-game talk with the team at the Stadium. An on-field ceremony honoring the players for their Super Bowl appearances, and presenting the school with its golden footballs, will take place at 7 p.m. \nKickoff of Ross’ game against Oregon Clay will be at 7:15 p.m. \n“I think it’s great our school has the likes of guys that have played in Super Bowls and represented Fremont Ross well and that they and their families are coming back,” Ross coach Craig Yeast said. “I think it’s a great thing. I’m looking forward to it, I’m looking forward to meeting the families of guys like Brudzinski and Lytle and Woodson. I think it’s going to be a great thing.” \nRoss senior Tyler Schell said with the program’s luminary figures looking on, he and his teammates want to make sure they put on a good show. \n“I think that good show will be having fun,” Schell said. “I’d like to think the alums had fun when they played football so I hope they see us having a good time on the field and that brings back positive memories of when they were Little Giants.” \nLittle Giants hosting Eagles \nNot to be lost among the week’s special visitors or the usual homecoming hoopla, is a game that pit two teams desperate for a win as Ross (2-5 overall, 0-4 Three Rivers Athletic Conference) hosts Clay (1-6, 0-4). \nThough the Eagles are not on the same level as Ross’ last three opponents, Toledo Whitmer, Toledo Central Catholic and Lima Senior, facing the Eagles in a game that figures to at least be more winnable than its previous three, doesn’t diminish any pressure on the Little Giants. \n“These are the games that scare me a little bit,” Schell said. “I think we can win, obviously, but it’s not a week off, there is no time to take a deep breath and think you can go out there and win. You have to play like you’re playing against Central or Whitmer to get a win.” \nRoss is coming off a 42-18 loss to Whitmer, though it was a much better performance than the previous week against Central Catholic. Improvement, however, isn’t enough, \n“The effort was there and we worked hard, but I don’t expect anything less than a win,” senior Jarren Hampton said. “It’s better than what we’ve been doing in past weeks but I want to win. Hopefully this week we’ll step up.” \nLast week’s loss to Whitmer essentially ended Ross’ fading hopes of rallying for a berth in the playoffs. While the Little Giants may be not mathematically eliminated, the realization that they’re now playing just for pride has sunk in. \n“That hurts, knowing in your senior year you can’t go to the playoffs,” Hampton said. “But it’s now all about pride and going out 5-5 than going out 2-8.” \nDespite Clay’s 1-win record, Yeast called the Eagles a much-improved team from last season, one that will require Ross to build from its effort last week. While Ross may have the edge in speed and talent, those qualities, in themselves, won’t be enough. \n“Anytime, you play against a team that may not be as athletic as you but plays with great effort and plays hard, if you don’t come and match that intensity, you could find yourself in trouble real quick,” Yeast said. IF YOU GO \nWho: Oregon Clay (1-6 overall, 0-4 Three Rivers Athletic Conference) at Fremont Ross (2-5, 0-4) \nWhat: Homecoming game, featuring pregame celebration for Ross alumni who played in Super Bowls. \nWhere: Don Paul Stadium 203 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1LuCEv6 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:30:20.935+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
