(WHAS11) â€“ For the first time since the allegations broke, the Red-White Scrimmage was all about basketball and in that game it was the red team, the backups, taking the starters on the white team to the woodshed winning 97-81. \n\"You can look at it two ways: we got a real good offense, or defense is not that good,\" said Rick Pitino afterwards. \"So, we're gonna work on that obviously.\" \nPlayers on the red team said they are going to enjoy this moment and of course not let their starters forget it. \n\"Oh yeah definitely they're not going to hear the end of it today,\" said 6-10 red shirt junior Mangok Mathiang, who had 15 points and nine rebounds. \"So, it feels good, definitely, to be on the winning side. And coach kinda gave it to them a little bit when we came into the locker room.\" \n\"Before the game they'll talk a lot of trash,\" freshman Deng Adel added, who led all scorers with 35 points. \"We weren't having that. We were just like, we're gonna win this game. That's the starting team. That's the projected starting team and we just wanted to show that we can play as well.\" \nThe starters know that the teasing is going to last for a while, but while they would have rather won the game, they know the young guys gaining confidence and being aggressive isn't the worst thing in the world. \n\"I'm sure we'll hear it tomorrow, you know, the next day in practice, but the good part is that we're a whole unit and them winning is us winning actually,\" fifth-year senior Damion Lee said, who led the white team with 33 points. \nThere was one Card sat out of the second scrimmage: Raymond Spalding did not play because of an injured ankle that he suffered in practice on Friday. Pitino said afterwards that as impressive as the youngsters were in the scrimmage, Spalding has the most upside of them all. \nThe Cards tip off the 2015-2016 regular season Friday, November 13 against Samford.
