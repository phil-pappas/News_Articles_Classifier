Today's Highlight in History: On October 4, 1965, Pope Paul VI, making the first-ever papal visit to the Western Hemisphere, addressed the U.N. General Assembly, where he urged delegates to adopt as their solemn oath: \"No more war, war never again.\" On this date: In 1777, Gen.

In 1970, rock singer Janis Joplin, 27, was found dead in her Hollywood hotel room. In 1976, Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz resigned in the wake of a controversy over a joke he'd made about blacks. In 1985, Islamic Jihad issued a statement saying it had killed American hostage William Buckley. (Fellow hostage David Jacobsen later said he believed Buckley had died of torture injuries four months earlier.) In 1990, for the first time in nearly six decades, German lawmakers met in the Reichstag for the first meeting of reunified Germany's parliament. In 1995, Pope John Paul II arrived in the United States for a five-day visit. Hurricane Opal battered the Florida panhandle. Ten years ago: President George W. Bush defended his Supreme Court nominee, Harriet Miers, from suggestions by some skeptical Republicans that she was not conservative enough, and insisted Miers shared his strict-constructionist views. (Miers ended up withdrawing.) Hurricane Stan slammed into Mexico's Gulf coast. Americans John L. Hall and Roy J. Glauber and German Theodor W. Haensch won the 2005 Nobel Prize in physics for optics research that improved the accuracy of such precision instruments as GPS locators, atomic clocks and navigation systems. Five years ago: The Supreme Court began a new era with three women serving together for the first time as Elena Kagan took her place at the end of the bench. The Nobel Prize in medicine went to Robert Edwards of Britain, whose work led to the first test tube baby. The Europeans reclaimed the Ryder Cup, winning 14 1/2-13 1/2. One year ago: North Korea's presumptive No. 2 leader, Hwang Pyong So, and other members of Pyongyang's inner circle met with South Korean officials in the rivals' highest level face-to-face talks in five years.
