The University of Alabama professor who killed three of her colleagues during a faculty meeting in 2010 has issued her first-ever apology: “I am terribly sorry.”\nAmy Bishop, the Harvard-educated biology professor serving a life sentence for the Huntsville campus shooting , included the hand-written statement in court documents filed Monday.\n“I am terribly sorry for the victims and their families, and my family,” she said in the new appeal documents, obtained by WAFF.\nThe 50-year-old pleaded guilty in 2012 to killing three people and wounding three more. One of her surviving victims rejected the apology, dismissing it as self-serving.\n“Do I think she’s truly sorry? I think she truly wants to get out of prison. That’s what I think,” said Dr. Joseph Leahy, who was shot in the head and suffered a traumatic brain injury. “Dr. Bishop has ceased to exist in my world. She just doesn’t exist anymore.”\nLeahy said the shooting left his blind in one eye — something an apology cannot fix.\n“It won’t bring me back my eye sight, it won’t bring me back the ability to drive again and everybody who does evil in this world has to pay the price in this world and the next,” he told WAFF.\nSince her 2012 guilty plea, Bishop and her legal team have filed multiple appeals claiming she was mentally ill at the time — meaning she could not legally plead guilty.\nBob Gathany/AP Bishop opened fire during a 2010 biology department staff meeting.

Previous Next Enlarge In the new appeal, Bishop also argued that her legal team is ineffective. However, she mentioned that she “hated” to bring up the issue because her trial attorney Roy Miller “is a kind, Christian man.”\nBishop was an associate professor of neurobiologist at the University of Alabama-Huntsville when she killed three of her fellow academics and wounded three more people during a 2010 staff meeting.\nThe lecturer pulled a gun out of her purse during the Feb. 12 biology department meeting and fatally shot professors Adriel Johnson, Maria Ragland Davis and Gopi Podila. Two more teachers and a faculty assistant were wounded.\nAfter the 2010 staff meeting shooting, authorities reopened the 1986 death of Bishop’s 18-year-old brother.\nBishop, then 20, shot and killed at their family’s Massachusetts home, but at the time police ruled it an accident. After the Alabama gun rampage, investigators ruled that there was cause to believe she killed her brother intentionally , but prosecutors dropped the case because the statute of limitation was up.\nIn her latest appeal, Bishop argued that she hasn’t been “normal” since he brother died.\nmwagner@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Ex-prof pleads guilty to killing Ala. colleagues Amy Bishop indicted in brother's '86 shooting death Professor charged in Alabama shooting likely insane: lawyer Alabama students complained of professor Amy Bishop Chilling details emerge from Alabama professor Amy Bishop's fatal shooting spree", "external_links": ["http://www.waff.com/story/30301226/uah-shooting-victim-speaks-out-following-shooters-prison-apology", "http://www.waff.com/story/30299020/first-apology-from-uah-shooter-i-am-terribly-sorry-for-the-victims-and-their-families"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:47:13.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
