Throughout the course of the event, Frazier staff will enable patients with spinal cord injuries to walk on a body weight supported treadmill, with family members and friends walking alongside their loved ones on a standard treadmill. The treadmills will not stop moving for 12 hours straight, supporting The Reeve Foundation and providing awareness for the 1.275 million people living with spinal cord injury in the United States.\nIn addition to Frazier Rehab, nine other Reeve Foundation NeuroRecovery Network (NRN) sites will have committed to keeping at least one treadmill running for either 12 or 24 hours on October 23-24 for the Annual Team Reeve Walk to Victory Over Paralysis step-a-thon, including Magee Rehabilitation (Philadelphia, PA), Craig Hospital (Denver, CO), Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation (West Orange, NJ), The Ohio State University (Columbus, OH), Next Steps Chicago (Chicago, IL), NextStep Fitness (Lawndale, CA), Courage Kenny (Minneapolis, MN), Journey Forward (Canton, MA), and Neuroworx (Sandy, UT).\n“We are thrilled to be participating in the Walk to Victory Over Paralysis for the second time,” said Kim Atkinson, MPT, NCS, Director of NeuroRTI’s Residency Program and Director of Spinal Cord Medicine at Frazier Rehab Institute. “This event does not just help raise awareness for those suffering from spinal cord injury in the United States – it raises charitable funds to support ongoing spinal cord research for the Reeve Foundation and its’ NeuroRecovery Network sites, and helps us continue to develop our spinal cord programs. We look forward to an incredible 12 hours supporting the cause!”\nTo donate, please contact Miranda Garvin at mirandagarvin(at)kentuckyonehealth.org.
