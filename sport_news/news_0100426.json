The NBA, and especially the Minnesota Timberwolves, mourned the death of Cuyahoga Heights native Flip Saunders. LeBron James returned to practice, but his status for Tuesday's opener is unclear. \nThe New York Mets and Kansas City Royals are set to begin the World Series Tuesday in Kansas City. \nArian Foster and Josh McCown top the NFL injury report.

Ginn hauled in five catches for 59 yards to lead the team and threw in a run of 43 yards as he continues his return to relevance in Charlotte. (Charlotte Observer) \nDanny Amendola leads Pats: On a day when receivers were dropping passes left and right, Danny Amendola proved to be one of the most sure-handed. \nThe veteran wideout was targeted nine times and caught eight passes for 86 yards, including the go-ahead touchdown with 7:16 left, as the Patriots defeated the Jets, 30-23, yesterday at Gillette Stadium. (Boston Herald) \nJohnny Manziel next up for Browns: Johnny Manziel might have to start next week against the Cardinals because of Josh McCown's shoulder injury -- providing he's not suspended by the NFL by then for his domestic incident on Oct. 12. The NFL has scheduled an interview with Manziel, but the date and location of that meeting is not yet known, a league source said. After the 24-6 loss to the Rams, during which Manziel replaced McCown with 3:26 left, Manziel addressed his domestic incident for the first time, but declined to go into detail.

FOX Sports NFL Insider Mike Garafolo reported Sunday that initial tests on the tendon are indeed that it is torn. (Fox Sports) \nFlip Saunders loomed large in NBA: Once deemed too small to make it big in the sport he so loved, Flip Saunders became a Minnesota basketball icon: a four-year starter at the University of Minnesota, the winningest coach in Timberwolves history and, in his second stint with the team, one of the most powerful executives in professional basketball. \nThe team announced \"with extreme sadness\" that its part-owner, president of basketball operations and head coach had died Sunday morning, four months after he began chemotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma, then suffered complications from the treatment. \nHe was 60. (Minneapolis Star Tribune) \nMary Schmitt Boyer recalls Saunders : I'm surprised Flip Saunders ever talked to me again. \nOur first meeting, in the early 1990s, was awkward, to say the least -- an awkwardness that was entirely my fault. \nBut Saunders, 60, who died of cancer much too soon on Sunday, became a good friend during my 25 years of covering the NBA -- and even after I left The Plain Dealer in 2014. (The Plain Dealer) \nSaunders' love of the game: Flip Saunders loved to talk basketball. Absolutely loved it. \nDidn't matter the occasion, whether it was on or off the record, at morning, noon or night.

Because NASCAR said this week it would make just one attempt to finish the race under the green flag, the field was frozen and Earnhardt was denied the chance to race Logano for the win. (Associated Press) \nKevin Harvick denies causing wreck: Kevin Harvick denied triggering a last-lap wreck Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway to ensure his advancing into the next round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup. \nAfter one restart was aborted because of a crash before the leaders got to the start-finish line, Harvick, in 10th, was in jeopardy of falling out of the Chase as his motor was about to blow prior to the one attempt to have a green-white-checkered finish.

So let's just say Smylie Kaufman had a lot to smile about Sunday. \nThe PGA Tour rookie had the best day of his brief professional career, tearing up TPC Summerlin with a final-round 10-under-par 61 and holding off six pursuers to win the Shriners Hospitals for Children Open. \nKaufman finished with a four-day total of 16-under 268.
