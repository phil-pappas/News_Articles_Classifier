Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford was hit eight times by eight different Vikings on Sept. 20, including defensive end Brian Robison.

The Lions lost to the Vikings, 26-16, and Stafford said the hits were mainly a function of the game situation. All eight of the Vikings' QB hits came in the second half, when the Lions trailed. \n\"Anytime you get behind in the game like that and you have to throw the ball as much as we do â€” watch the San Diego game, it was pretty similar,\" Stafford said. \"They got off to a great start and got a lead, and it's tough when you have a guy that's drawing up really good blitzes like (coach Mike) Zimmer is and having guys execute them with the talent that those guys have. You don't want to find yourself down in a big hole in the second half, not that you ever do, but especially against a guy like that.\" \nThis week, while preparing to face the Vikings again today, Stafford downplayed the beating he took last time. For a guy who recently has suffered the ignominy of being benched for the first time in his career, maybe the pain of a few bruised ribs pales in comparison. Staff picks: Albom the only one who believes in Lions \nCoach Jim Caldwell gave Stafford full credit for gutting it out against the Vikings. But Caldwell didn't care to single out Stafford's effort as something unique among football players. \n\"It's a tough game, it's a physical game, and there's a lot of guys that really go through quite a bit,\" he said. \"It's amazing what they're able to play with. That's why they play in this league, because they aren't typical and you have to be a little bit different in order to function.\" \nActually, the players who may have taken the hits on Stafford hardest were the players who were supposed to keep them from happening at all. \n\"We definitely took it to heart,\" right tackle Cornelius Lucas said. \"When your job is to protect someone and they obviously go unprotected like that, you kind of beat yourself up about it. Hopefully this go around we'll do a lot better than we did last time.\" Lions vs. Vikings: Scouting report, prediction \nThat, Lucas said, involves a multipronged effort that runs from scheme to communication to execution. \n\"Anytime your quarterback gets hurt, I think everyone takes it to heart a little bit,\" offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi said. \"We all had our hand in that a little bit. There were times when he was getting hit and everyone was blocking their guy. They had a free guy running and Matt was getting it out because we had an option for him to throw it to quickly. But they were getting home a little quicker than you wanted to. ... \n\"So we've got to be smart with our game plan so we're not throwing it out of 11 personnel (with three receivers) 50 times so that they're not allowed to tee off on you like that,\" Lombardi said. \"That's about being efficient on first and second down and making sure that we're not turning the ball over and falling behind where we're forced into that kind of game.\" \nContact Carlos Monarrez: cmonarrez@freepress.com .
