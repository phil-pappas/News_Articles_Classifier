We guess it’s a valid query soon after Navratras when many a hardcore non-vegetarians are rearing to dig into their food staple. Enough to have it in starters, main course and even dessert? A cursory glance at the elaborate Rampuri Food Festival menu points out just that. And, also the knowledge that the royalty of this small princely state love their meat so much so that one popular desert was gosht ka halwa! And, no, this Rampuri cuisine is not only for meat eaters, it has a handsome selection of veggie delights too. On at JW Marriott, under Chef M Rehman’s hands the kitchen rolls out delicacies that have a strong Mughlai, Awadhi influence and are yet retain their individuality. Chef Rehman, founder of Kitchenett E Awadh, who has had access to the history, secrets and proper recipes of origin of the Rampuri dishes, shares, “Punjabis take their food seriously which is why I consider cooking for this region interesting and challenging at the same time. I have tried to bring in the traditional dishes of Rampur where a lot of traditional spices are used to make the food aromatic and taste exquisite. I am sure this will suit the palate of Punjab,” says Chef Rehman. In fact, the menu is a pleasant variation of what we all love. Dal aswad is tangy sister of dal makhani and yet a welcome break on what we have been used to. Fish lovers hit a coup with khatti meethi machli. Lazeez aloo katli is a vegetarian starter that’s done with cumin and fresh coriander. In fact, in most dishes just one or two flavour stand out blending well with the main ingredient. There is plenty of choice in the main course – taar korma with its rich, creamy gravy is mutton lovers’ delight; green brigade can bank on khass makai khumb — an interesting mix of mushrooms, peas and corns. Then there is platter of dohra mussalam — oven baked whole chicken stuffed with quail. The dessert selection along with sheer khurma has ande ka halwa and gosht ka halwa. Let us warn you the halwas do have hint of egg and meat but just a little. “We love to experiment with food and aim to offer our patrons with authentic dishes of every region. This is just an effort in making it possible to bring the world on the plate. We wanted to offer a cuisine that can match the occasion, Rampur royal spread just fits the bill,” says Pallav Singhal, director, food and beverages.
