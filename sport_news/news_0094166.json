Supposed to have walk-thru practice @KSU by now. Rather, plane on Tarmac since 2:40 w engine probs. 6 hrs late! #OU\n— Dean Blevins (@DeanBlevins) October 16, 2015\nThe #Sooners are still at the OKC airport. Left campus at 2 pm for the airport. Would be here by now if they'd driven\n— Jason Kersey (@jasonkersey) October 17, 2015 But the problems only continued with the arrival of a backup plane.\nUnbelievably, the back up plane that was on its way to take #OU team to #KSU now has its own mechanical problems. No idea when we will leave\n— Dean Blevins (@DeanBlevins) October 17, 2015\nGotta imagine this will factor in the next time @OU_Athletics is signing a contract with an airline. United is awful.\n— Jason Kersey (@jasonkersey) October 17, 2015 And here's the kicker:\n#Sooners paid United Airlines $623,000 for football flights this season.\n— John Shinn (@john_shinn) October 17, 2015\nStoops and Co not happy campers.

Forget about it.\nHow about the fourth one?\nJoe Mixon rolling around Tarmac. Say prayers for safe flight. 4 mechanical probs w 4 planes. A record. #sooners pic.twitter.com/gvOUc8UXQ0\n— Dean Blevins (@DeanBlevins) October 17, 2015 Yikes.\nEventually, No. 4 got the job done. Eventually .\n8 hours & 16 mins after boarding, plane No. 4 has wheels rolling on #OU charter to KSU. Wonder how Bobby Knight would've handled? #Sooners\n— Dean Blevins (@DeanBlevins) October 17, 2015 Before takeoff, standout linebacker Eric Striker made sure to let the pilot know how he felt about boarding a functioning plane after a delay of more than eight hours.\nPretty cool ... Eric Striker caught the pilot who brought in the back-up plane as he came down the stairs and thanked him.\n— Kenny Mossman (@Kenny_Mossman) October 17, 2015 Here's to hoping the return trip is a little easier.\nAfter a long day we have officially touched down in Manhattan. Thank you to the crew who got us here safely. We thank you.\n— Oklahoma Football (@OU_Football) October 17, 2015 Oklahoma-Kansas State is scheduled for a 2:30 p.m. kickoff.\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/OU_Athletics", "https://twitter.com/Kenny_Mossman/status/655227029508370432", "https://twitter.com/jasonkersey/status/655184470773882880", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "https://twitter.com/jasonkersey/status/655173020068122624", "https://twitter.com/ksu", "http://t.co/oIMm7HEjxj", "http://newsok.com/sooners-team-flight-to-manhattan-kan.-delayed-several-hours/article/5454040", "https://twitter.com/DeanBlevins/status/655165352330981377", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/KSU?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/DeanBlevins/status/655215762508873728", "https://twitter.com/DeanBlevins/status/655231339629641728", "https://twitter.com/john_shinn/status/655201115093471232", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/OU?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/DeanBlevins/status/655226474220224513", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/sooners?src=hash", "http://t.co/ochycchqse", "http://t.co/gvOUc8UXQ0", "https://twitter.com/DeanBlevins/status/655183168799010816", "https://twitter.com/OU_Football/status/655112668672462848", "https://twitter.com/OU_Football/status/655242610517417986", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Sooners?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-17T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:30:06.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
