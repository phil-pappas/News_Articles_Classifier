He admitted to drinking earlier that day, according to a report obtained from the Avon Police department. \nAccording to the report, Colleen Elizabeth Crowley, Manziel's girlfriend, said he also pushed her head into the window of his white Nissan. However she did not want to press charges. A witness said Manziel was driving at a high speed and that Crowley was attempting to exit the vehicle before they stopped. \n\"We were aware of the situation,\" Browns general manager Ray Farmer said in a statement. \"It is a matter that we take seriously and have expressed our concerns to Johnny directly.
