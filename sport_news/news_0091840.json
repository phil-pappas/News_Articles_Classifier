It's about the quality of the opportunity,\" coach Dave Hakstol said. \"I think we can improve what we're doing. When the puck's not going in the net, you gotta simplify things. You have to make sure you're getting pucks there, but you also have to make sure there's some quality to it, in terms of an opportunity for a rebound, getting a body there for a rebound. Simplify things, stay confident and keep doing things the right way.\" \nThe Flyers had only gotten one goal from their top line, which certainly doesn't help. \n\"You're not going to score five goals every night,\" Wayne Simmonds said. \"We haven't scored the most goals, we haven't scored as many as we wanted to. It's a work in progress. We're going to keep getting better. Our offensive opportunities, we're going to get more of them and we'll be fine.\" \nHe makes it sound so easy. Change of pace \nUsually, when teams are playing the second half of back-to-back games, there typically isn't the standard morning skate on the day of the game. And for a team that traveled late like the Flyers did Tuesday night into Wednesday morning, it becomes even more rare. \nBut the Flyers did have their morning skate Wednesday. Was Hakstol trying to keep the team on its toes after Tuesday's loss? \n\"No. I'm not trying to keep guys off balance,\" Hakstol said. \"I want them comfortable knowing what's coming and knowing what they have to do to prepare . . . and to trust our players.\" \nWednesday's late puck drop (8 p.m.) could also could have had a little bit to do with the decision. Hakstol also said it was good to get into a routine to help aid in preparation, especially after the five-day layoff that preceded Tuesday's game. \nThe skate was optional. Thirteen players participated while others worked out off the ice at TD Garden. Hakstol was not on the ice, as the optional skate was run by the assistant coaches. \n\"It's better to get out here and get the meetings done here than sit around the hotel all day and just wait for the game to come,\" winger Jakub Voracek said. \nHakstol was asked what he feels about balancing the amount of times players are on the ice in the long, 82-game season. \n\"I think there's a balance. No question,\" Hakstol said. \"You start a season with a full tank of gas. You only have so much energy to burn over the long haul and I don't care what number of games or what level it's at. I think that's the case. I think we're going to try to gauge that, manage that. We're coming off of a five-day break where we didn't play. I think it's a good day for us to be at the rink. If guys choose to be on the ice, I think it's good preparation.\" Late scratch \nAfter participating in the optional skate, Brayden Schenn was a late scratch from the lineup. The Flyers announced two hours before puck drop that Schenn would not be in the lineup. \nSchenn took a nasty fall at center ice in Tuesday's loss to Dallas when he was upended by Dallas' Antoine Roussel. The two players skated into each other near the red line and Schenn toppled over Roussel, his feet flying in the air as he landed on his upper body. That happened in the second period, and Schenn finished the game. \nGeneral manager Ron Hextall said Schenn is considered day-to-day. Slap shots \nThe winless Columbus Blue Jackets (0-7-0) fired coach Todd Richards after seven games and hired the former Lightning, Rangers and Canucks coach, John Tortorella, to take over. The Flyers don't meet their Metro Division opponents until Dec. 5 . . . The Flyers likely will be off Thursday before returning to the ice Friday ahead of Saturday's tilt with the New York Rangers . . . R.J. Umberger and Luke Schenn, who had both been healthy scratches, returned to the lineup Wednesday night. Umberger was supposed to replace Sam Gagner at forward while Schenn replaced Brandon Manning (minus-two Tuesday) on the blue line. But Brayden Schenn's ailment put Gagner back in the lineup on a line with Umberger and Scott Laughton. \nOn Twitter: @Jeff_Neiburg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:27:56.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
