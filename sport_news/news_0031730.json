They sat spellbound for 59 minutes of excitement, punctuated by 15 minutes of horror.”\nThe horror was the second quarter: Oregon State scored 21 points.\nBut when UW’s Ralph Winters intercepted a pass at the goal line in the last minute of the game, the Huskies were victorious, 28-21.\nSee more historical photos \nWinters earned the game ball and said he planned to put it on the mantle of his crew house.\nThe Nov. 14, 1965, Times headline was “Winters Chills Beavers with Late Interception.” Four staff photographers were assigned to cover the game: Vic Condiotty, Josef Scaylea, Larry Dion and Robert I. Peterson.\nThe team would end the season with five wins, five losses. The class of 1965 is planning a reunion at UW during this year’s homecoming . On Saturday, the Huskies will face the Oregon Ducks.\n \nColin Diltz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T13:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:57:37.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
