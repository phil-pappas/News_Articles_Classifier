He prefers mentor.\nIf an Oregon Ducks football player has questions on life, classes or faith, Bidwell steps in. He can relate to most anything a college athlete might experience.\nBidwell, 39, grew up in small-town Winston, minutes south of Roseburg, was an all-conference punter for the Ducks and All-Pro in the NFL over 12 seasons, and overcame testicular cancer to do it, too. He's called Eugene home, in one way or another, since 1994. Since his NFL retirement four years ago he's returned to the Willamette Valley full-time, sharing his experiences to the newest Ducks.\n\"I have a lot in common with them,\" Bidwell said.\nOct. 1 was an ugly reminder of just how much.\nSeventeen years after Bidwell, then a UO junior, recoiled at the news of the May 21, 1998 shootings at Springfield's Thurston High School, college athletics go on again, this time in the aftermath of a shooter's Oct. 1 rampage on the same hilltop Umpqua Community College campus where Bidwell learned to swim and played Amateur Athletic Union basketball as a teen. There, in a 10-minute stretch, a gunman killed nine and wounded nine others before turning the weapon on himself, ending the state's deadliest mass shooting and beginning a search for answers.\nThe attack, which took place just minutes from where Bidwell grew up and an hour south of the University of Oregon campus, has reminded Bidwell of how much -- and how little -- has changed since 1998.\n\"I never had any connection to anything like (Thurston) before,\" he said. \"It was something that was just hard to understand. You're helpless.\"\nJosh Bidwell, punting in 1998 for the Oregon Ducks, grew up in Winston and retains deep ties to the Roseburg region. He's using that help to raise funds for the community in the wake of the Umpqua Community College shootings on Oct. 1. Steven Nehl/The Oregonian, 1998 But after this latest mass shooting so close to home, Bidwell has felt empowered, if gutted, as one part of a larger effort from the state's athletics community to offer help.\nIn Eugene that effort began internally, where Bidwell and staff members have listened to players' reactions to the shooting. It spread when the Ducks, Oregon State Beavers and other colleges offered gestures both tangible and emotional. The UO and OSU football programs have worn helmet decals featuring a black ribbon and the UCC initials, and the fields at Oregon's soccer and football stadiums have also featured the image during recent games.\nDucks coach Mark Helfrich, born in Medford and a Southern Oregon University graduate, addressed the shooting during a team meeting hours after the news spilled out while UO was exiting an otherwise unremarkable practice. Helfrich learned of what had happened by a phone call from athletic director Rob Mullens. Two days later, he personally requested Colorado officials to hold a moment of silence at Boulder's Folsom Field before kickoff against Oregon (UO held a similar moment at home last weekend, as well).\nAmid Oregon's 3-3 start, the shooting has been a lesson, however unwelcome, of perspective that UO hasn't hesitated to share.\n\"It's an hour-and-change away from where you grow up, and it could be anywhere,\" Helfrich said. \"It could be our kids. All the lessons that you need to learn from that, they just slap you right in the face. Whether it's going back to the deal at Thurston several years ago or all the other things that have happened around the country, we've got to at least talk about it.\"\n***\nSo many well-wishers have called and written to talk about it that Cheryl Yoder's voicemail and inbox are now stuffed.\nLike many at the 5,000-strong community college, Yoder wears many hats. Typically she is Umpqua's athletics director, chairwoman for its Health and Human Performance department, and a full-time faculty member. Since Oct. 1, she has felt like a sounding board both for those on the UCC campus, and far from it, seeking to help. Mullens and his Oregon State counterpart, Todd Stansbury, each left Yoder voice messages, offering condolences — one victim was a UCC basketball player, Treven Ansbach — and ideas for aid.\n\"Which was pretty amazing,\" she said.\nWithin days they'd increased their offers. Both Oregon and Oregon State have given away free tickets to football games for UCC students and staff. According to Yoder, Oregon State officials have told her to \"think big\" for how many tickets might be needed — 1,000, or 2,000, or more — for an Oct. 24 home game against Colorado. Other colleges have dispatched administrators and grief counselors.\nBidwell, with his deep roots both at Oregon and around the Umpqua Valley, called the measures \"heartfelt.\"\n\"There's nothing we can do but tell you we're sorry and we hurt from a distance,\" Bidwell said. \"As someone who's gone through calamity, when I know that someone feels pain for my pain, there's some comfort in that.\"\nThose who took the Ducks up on the offer for last Saturday's home game against Washington State were bused to and from Autzen Stadium from the south Eugene campus of Lane Community College, which offered free rides.\n\"We're obviously going to do anything we can to support that fallout from that situation,\" Helfrich said. \"There's nothing you can say or do that's going to solve it.\"\nSaid Yoder: \"I was like, wow. You just don't expect it. You're just trying to get through the day.\"\nThe free tickets, decals and other gestures have been short-term salves after a tragedy whose scars will be permanent. And as such, Yoder was not among those those traveling north last Saturday for the Ducks' afternoon kickoff.\n\"I had to go to funerals,\" she said. \"It has been heart-wrenching.\"\n***\nEmergency calls of distress at the college were first reported at 10:38 a.m. on Oct. 1.\nBidwell's own morning, in its own way, went sideways once he'd pulled over his car to decode the meaning of a friend's seemingly innocuous text message.\nHey, I hope you and the family are doing OK.\n\"My response was thanks for thinking of me,\" Bidwell said. \"And then it dawned on me that there was something cryptic about that.\"\nA search revealed headlines of a shooting at an Oregon college, and initially Bidwell thought they referred to UO. What popped up instead was Umpqua, a college where several friends work outside of Roseburg, a tight-knit city where \"there is one degree of separation\" and whose country club hosts Bidwell's annual fundraiser, a golf tournament that pairs local \"celebrities,\" such as former UO athletes Luke Jackson and Jordan Kent, with donors.\nCentering the foundation's only fundraising event around sports was obvious from its start a decade ago. Athletics resonate deeply in the region, and remain deeply intertwined in its recovery from the shooting. At the first Roseburg High football game since the shootings on Friday evening, students raised funds for victims at a tailgate.\nOnly seven punters since the 1999 NFL draft have been taken earlier than Bidwell's fourth-round selection, but his long career nearly never happened. Upon his diagnosis of testicular cancer in 1999 -- he's been in remission since 2000 -- he surrounded himself with what he calls his \"team.\" Sixteen years later on the morning of Oct. 1 he went down its roster again, first to understand what had happened at Umpqua, and then to enlist those ready to help.\nThe Josh Bidwell Foundation is currently attempting to raise and distribute as many funds as legally allowed by non-profit status to cover, in part, medical and funeral costs.\n\"No one should have to bury a loved one under these circumstance,\" he said. \"Somebody's going to need assistance with some of the more fortunate who were able to keep their lives and their medical attention. those families somehow or another aren't going to be able to work. ... We can't hit everything, but there are a lot of people coming down and maybe they will hit certain things we can't.\"\nBidwell did not personally know any of the victims, but received photos from a professor amid the campus-wide lockdown. A friend in law enforcement was among the first responders, and Bidwell spoke with his wife throughout the morning. In between, he called officials at his foundation and fielded more text messages, becoming one of the many voices with ties to the community asking what could be done.\n\"The blessing is communities come together,\" Bidwell said. \"It didn't need to take an event like this to show that,\" he said. \"We've seen that since I was a kid. We're willing to do whatever is needed.\"\nIt is an open-ended mission. One he hopes, in the wake of the deadly shooting, many with ties to Umpqua Community College can relate.\n-- Andrew Greif\nagreif@oregonian.com\n@andrewgreif", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/andrewgreif", "http://www.joshbidwellfoundation.org/"], "published": "2015-10-13T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:04:13.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
