Because this constitutes a threat for us, and it is not possible for us as Turkey to say 'yes' to this threat.\"\nTel Abyad, on the border with Turkey, was captured in June from Islamic State by Kurdish YPG militia with help from U.S.-led air strikes. Last week, a local leadership council declared it part of the system of autonomous self government established by the Kurds.\nSyrian Kurds have established three autonomous zones, or \"cantons\", across northern Syria since the civil war broke out in 2011. They deny aiming to establish their own state.\nTurkey is alarmed by territorial gains for the Kurds in Syria's civil war, which it fears could stir separatism among its own Kurdish minority. For the past three decades Ankara has been trying to end an insurgency by fighters of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which is classified as a terrorist organisation by the United States and European Union.\nThe PKK has been staging almost daily attacks in the southeast since July, when a ceasefire fell apart.\nTurkey accuses the Syrian Kurds' political arm, the PYD, of deep links to the PKK. It has been incensed by the role the Kurds have carved out for themselves, with U.S. support, in the fight against Islamic State in northern Syria.\nErdogan also slammed countries who provided assistance to the PYD, although he did not name them, and said it harboured 1,400 PKK members.\nEarlier this month, the YPG Kurdish militia announced a new alliance with small groups of Arab fighters, and the group was air-dropped small arms and ammunition by U.S. forces in northeast Syria.\nWashington has indicated it could direct funding and weapons to Arab commanders on the ground who cooperate with the YPG.\nErdogan also criticised Putin for hosting Assad in Moscow earlier this week, questioning how he could \"welcome on a red carpet someone who has spilled the blood of 370,000 people\".\nAssad flew to Moscow on Tuesday evening to thank Putin for his military support, his first foreign visit since the start of the Syrian crisis in 2011.\nThe surprise trip came three weeks after Russia launched a campaign of air strikes against Islamist militants and rebels in Syria that has bolstered Assad's forces.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:36:46.004+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
