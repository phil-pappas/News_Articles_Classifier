(Photo by Toni L. Sandys/ The Washington Post) \nNearly three months after undergoing back surgery to repair a bulging disk in his lower back, Jared Dudley participated in the Wizards’ abbreviated open practice Monday, going through various drills, and is slated to be a full participant for Wednesday’s practice for the first time as a Wizard. \n“We didn’t go live with a lot of stuff but I think Wednesday will be no restrictions at all so that will really be the first practice that he can do everything,” Wizards Coach Randy Wittman said. \nDudley, 30, hasn’t played in live action or scrimmaged since camp opened but has had his workload steadily grow recently. Last week, Dudley said he’d be cleared for practice Tuesday, but the Wizards will have the day off. \nDudley has said he believes playing in a preseason game is a possibility – the Wizards have four remaining — and that he could be ready for the regular season, which opens on Oct. 28 against the Orlando Magic. The eight-year veteran was acquired in a trade with the Milwaukee Bucks and is in the final year of his contract. \n“I’ve lucked out to a point where I’ve had no back pain,” Dudley said recently. “I don’t feel anything at all. I’ve done everything they’ve asked me to do treatment-wise. I’ve tried to push it to see if it would ache; it hasn’t ached.” \nDudley’s impending return is about the only positive injury news for the Wizards. Garrett Temple (hamstring), Alan Anderson (ankle), Martell Webster (hip), DeJuan Blair (knee), and Marcin Gortat (mouth) were all held out of practice Monday. \nGortat underwent a minor dental procedure Monday morning and isn’t expected to miss any significant time. Temple, who has missed the Wizards’ last two exhibitions with a sore right hamstring, is “closer” to a return, Wittman said, and could do some non-contact drills Wednesday. It is the same hamstring that forced Temple to miss the final 18 games of the regular season last year, but the guard said this ailment it is isn’t as serious. \nAnderson and Webster don’t have a definite timetable to return. Anderson, who signed a one-year deal worth $4 million during the offseason, had bone spurs removed from his left ankle and has been limited since visiting a doctor in New York City three days into training camp. Webster is dealing with arthritis in his right hip after missing most of last season following his third back surgery in four years. \n“It’s just one of those things with the hip, where he’s got to let it calm down,” Wittman said. “No update there.” \nDefense improves in Sunday’s win \nOn paper, allowing 100 points to a non-NBA team, like the Wizards surrendered to Brazil’s Bauru on Sunday, is not a positive development. But Washington’s up-tempo offense will likely result in more points per game for opponents and the team came away encouraged by its defensive showing after unsatisfactory efforts in the first two exhibitions. \n“They made us do a lot of communicating, a lot of talking because they ran a lot of sets and we got back to playing our defense the way that we want to,” Wizards point guard John Wall said. “We gave up a lot of points at the end but we played the way we wanted to, running them off threes. And not knowing those guys’ games, we did a pretty good job.” \nWizards hold open practice \nWashington hosted a free one-hour open practice at Verizon Center Monday and a hearty crowd attended on the holiday. It was the Wizards’ first, and likely only, open practice of the season. \nThe session was limited to various drills and the team didn’t scrimmage. \n“It was great,” Wall said. “They probably wanted us to do some more competitive stuff than we did in the past. But it was exciting to be out there, have them see us and see all the fans that support us throughout the whole season.” Jorge Castillo writes about the Washington Wizards. sports Success!
