There are no guarantees Duclair would have earned as much playing time with the Rangers as he’s getting in Arizona.\nStill, it’ll be hard not to imagine the what-ifs when Duclair takes to the Garden ice this week.\nNot only did Yandle start the season slowly, but he’s an impending unrestricted free agent. The Rangers may not be able to afford him without some serious salary cap maneuvering.\n\"I know Keith is extremely passionate and is putting a lot of pressure on himself to perform well,\" Vigneault said. \"I think it’s just a matter of time before we see it on a more consistent basis.\"\nThe Coyotes are seeing it from Duclair at the moment.\nEmail: grossa@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:46:57.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
