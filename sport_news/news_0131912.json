Couples and Love spent the week as Jay Haas’ assistant captains at the Presidents Cup. Love is next year’s U.S. Ryder Cup captain.\n“(Woods) was watching at home and he just had to call,\" Love said. \"He was talking about all the things he thought we needed to do, and he had a lot of ideas. We're already doing a lot of planning for next year, and it's great. It's part of the whole process that started after Gleneagles. Everybody is thinking about it, which is great.\"\nLove hasn’t named any assistant captains besides Tom Lehman.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.golf.com/tour-and-news/tiger-woods-could-be-assistant-captain-2016-ryder-cup-matches", "http://www.golfdigest.com/story/tiger-woods-calls-davis-love-in-korea-volunteers-as-ryder-cup-assistant?mbid=social_twitter", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.golf.com/"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:17:58.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
