In the Phantoms' home opener, Syracuse drew first blood with Mike Blunden beating LaBarbera on a drive across the crease through two defenders. (EMILY PAINE / THE MORNING CALL) Check out what happened when the @LVPhantoms played Syracuse Saturday night \nThe Syracuse Crunch ruined the debut of Lehigh Valley Phantoms coach Scott Gordon on Saturday night. \nThe Crunch jumped out to a 4-1 lead and had to hold on at the end of a frenzied comeback as the Phantoms dropped the season opener for both clubs by a 4-3 score in front of a sellout crowd of 8,425 at the PPL Center. \nSyracuse drew first blood with Mike Blunden beating Jason LaBarbera on a drive across the crease through two defenders. LaBarbera stopped the backhand but the puck swept across with Blunden for a tap in on the right side of the goalie exactly 9 minutes into the game. Highly touted rookie Anthony DeAngelo picked up an assist on the goal, the Crunch's ninth shot of the game against two for the Phantoms. \nAaron Palushaj scored the Phantoms first goal of the season, knotting the game 1-1 at 11:39 with a shot from his knee in the right circle, beating Crunch goalie Kristers Gudlevskis over the glove shoulder to the delight of the PPL Center crowd. \nThe Phantoms picked up the power play when Petr Straka took a high stick from Matthew Peca and then got drilled by former Phantoms and Flyer Tye McGinn. Cornell University graduate Cole Bardreau didn't take kindly to that and dropped his gloves to set off a fight, but the Phantoms went on the successful power play. \nFaces in the Crowd at the Lehigh Valley Phantoms season opener against Syracuse Crunch Saturday night at Allentown's PPL Center arena. (CHRIS KNIGHT / SPECIAL TO THE MORNING CALL) \nLater in the period, Syracuse's Mike Angelidis grabbed Danick Martel around the neck from behind and bent him backward, drawing a response from Colin McDonald, but no penalties were meted out. \nAfter the ensuing faceoff, Syracuse skated down ice, defenseman Luke Vermin launched a shot down the slot through traffic that was tipped in by Jonathan Marchessault for a 2-1 Crunch lead with 5:29 left in the first. Both Syracuse goals came against the Phantoms fourth line of Tyler Goulbourne, Pavel Padakin and Michael Parks, all making their pro debuts. \nPhilippe Paradis made it 3-1 with 1:22 remaining, firing in for the goal with LaBarbera trying to see through an unchallenged screen by Yanni Gourde. \nSyracuse made it 4-1 just 6:07 into the middle period when Marchessault slipped a rebound from the slot side of the right circle through LaBarbera, who screened by his own defenseman, the third goal against the Pro Debut line. \nChris Conner got one back in his Phantoms debut, taking Padakin's rebound on the doorstep to put it past Gudlevskis' stickside 9:17 into the second period, cutting the Crunch lead to 4-2. \nPhantoms rookie Danick Martel, playing with fire all night, put the Phantoms within one goal of tying the game on a rebound with 3:29 left in regulation. \nPhantom lines: The Phantoms' most notable scratch was Jay Rosehill. Defenseman Jesper Pettersson and Logan Pyett (battling sarcoma) were the other scratches â€¦ Defenseman Matt Lashoff is not listed on the roster but is still with the team on an invitation basis but did not dress.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:58:35.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
