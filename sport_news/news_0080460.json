En route to earning its third consecutive victory, W&M (5-2, 3-1 CAA) built a 30-0 lead at halftime and finished the contest with nearly 400 more total yards of offense, 526-150. Additionally, the Tribe outgained HU (4-4, 3-2 MEAC) on the ground, 282-27, and held the Pirates to just 2-of-12 on third down. \nJunior running back Kendell Anderson equaled a career-high with 191 rushing yards – the ninth-best performance in school history – on 22 carries with a touchdown. It marked Anderson's fifth-consecutive 100-yard effort as well as the 12th straight game in which a Tribe running back has reached the century mark. \nJunior quarterback Steve Cluley accounted for two touchdowns – one passing and one rushing – and completed 21-of-32 passes for 244 yards. Senior wideout Christian Reeves also came up big with five catches for 94 yards, while sophomore DeVonte Dedmon totaled five receptions for 37 yards with a touchdown. \nDefensively, senior free safety DeAndre Houston-Carson and sophomore defensive end Matt Ahola recorded interceptions, while junior linebacker Marcus Harvey posted a team-high five tackles with a sack and 2.0 TFL. Junior Nick Dorka, Jr., also came up big and equaled a school record with four made field goals, including a career-long 47-yard kick. \nThe Tribe jumped out to a 9-0 lead in the first quarter on three field goals by Dorka (37, 25, 47). His second kick came after Ahola's interception set up a short field, while his third score came after W&M stopped Hampton well short on a faked punt attempt. \nW&M continued to build its lead with three touchdowns in the second quarter. A 1-yard touchdown run by Anderson with 12:07 showing increased the margin got 16-0, while a 17-yard strike from Cluley to Dedmon extended the advantage. Abdul-Saboor provided the final score of the quarter on a 3-yard run with just 0:43 remaining. En route to piling up the 30-0 halftime lead, W&M outgained HU, 353-35, including a 195-5 advantage on the ground. Anderson was especially effective in the opening 30 minutes and rushed for 175 yards on 16 carries. Hampton's lone score of the second half came on a 48-yard touchdown pass from David Watford to Twarn Mixson with 4:19 left in the third quarter. \nW&M answered on the ensuing possession, however, as Cluley punctuated an eight-play, 64-yard drive with a 14-yard touchdown run. Dorka provided the final score with a 27-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter.  //on.wvec.com/1S3rxKK TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:11:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:16:32.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
