(AP) - Gautier officials have adopted a resolution to urge the Mississippi Legislature to appropriate $1.5 million to further a combined effort of the three coastal counties to obtain more accurate and consistent flood zone mapping.\nThe Mississippi Press reports ( http://bit.ly/1kuv1L0 ) the resolution approved Tuesday states current flood maps are flawed, inconsistent from community to community, and need to be studied and redrawn.\nOfficials say the money would go to the Southern Mississippi Planning and Development District to coordinate attempts to mitigate the negative impacts of the Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 and challenge current maps being used by FEMA.\nMayor Gordon Gollott says the issue impacts everyone who lives along the Gulf Coast, especially in the flood zones.\nInformation from: The Mississippi Press, http://www.gulflive.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
