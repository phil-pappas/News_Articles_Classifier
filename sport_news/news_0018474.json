More From KTVZ.COM Royals get 15 hits, down Blue Jays 14-2 \nThe Mets completed a four-game National League Championship Series sweep to seal their fifth World Series berth and first since 2000. \nThe National League champs will meet either the Royals or the Blue Jays when the Fall Classic opens Tuesday in Kansas City or Toronto. \nMurphy clubbed his seventh home run of the postseason -- a two-run shot to center in the eighth inning -- to set a major league postseason record with homers in six consecutive games. The old mark of five games was set by outfielder Carlos Beltran with the Houston Astros in 2004. \nThe second baseman, who went 4-for-5 with two runs, was selected the series MVP. Murphy hit .529 (9-for-17) with four homers and six RBIs in the sweep. In nine games overall this postseason, Murphy is hitting .421 (16-for-38) with seven homers and 11 RBIs. \nThe power display was a shock considering Murphy's single-season high for home runs is 14, set this year. Over his seven-year major league career, Murphy is averaging one homer every 58.4 at-bats. This postseason, he is going deep every 5.4 at-bats. \nNew York first baseman Lucas Duda (three hits, five RBIs) and catcher Travis d'Arnaud set the table with back-to-back, first-inning home runs, and Mets right-handed starter Steven Matz allowed one run in a 4 2/3-inning no-decision in front of an announced crowd of 42,227 at Wrigley Field. \nFour Mets relievers handled the Cubs the rest of the way, allowing just two more runs. \nRight-hander Bartolo Colon (1-0) worked 1 1/3 scoreless innings for the victory. \nCubs third baseman Kris Bryant hit a two-run homer-- his first of the series -- with no outs in the eighth off right-handed reliever Tyler Clippard. \nChicago left-hander Jason Hammel (0-1) worked just 1 1/3 innings and allowed five runs on four hits. \nThe Cubs bowed out after a 97-win regular season, an NL wild-card win over the Pittsburgh Pirates and an NL Division Series victory over the St. Louis Cardinals. \nThe Mets sent nine batters to the plate in the first inning while scoring four runs with two outs. \nDuda sent a 3-2 pitch over the left field wall for his first postseason homer -- a three-run shot that scored right fielder Curtis Granderson and center fielder Yoenis Cespedes. \nD'Arnaud then launched a 0-1 pitch to right for his third homer of the playoffs, giving the Mets a 4-0 lead. \nHammel exited, and left-handed reliever Travis Wood entered and gave up a two-out double to Duda that scored third baseman David Wright and Murphy for a 6-0 Mets lead. \nWood worked 1 2/3 innings and was charged with one run and two hits while striking out three and walking one. \nMatz escaped a fourth-inning jam after Chicago got its first two hits while loading the bases. \nLeft fielder Kyle Schwarber brought right fielder Jorge Soler home from third with a fielder's choice grounder that trimmed the deficit to 6-1. However, the Cubs scored no more as shortstop Javier Baez popped out in foul territory to end the inning. \nChicago had runners on first and second with two outs in the fifth, including a misplayed popup that dropped fair for center fielder Dexter Fowler. That marked the end for Matz, who was replaced by Colon. The 43-year-old right-hander struck out Bryant. \nCespedes left the game in the bottom of the second due to left shoulder soreness. \nNOTES: New York's bullpen had not allowed a run in its last five-plus postseason games spanning 16 innings before RHP Tyler Clippard served up a two-run homer to Cubs 3B Kris Bryant in the eighth inning. ... Cubs LF Kyle Schwarber's five postseason home runs are a franchise rookie record and the second most by a rookie with any team. ... The last time the Cubs were down 0-3 in a best-of-seven series, they were swept in the 1938 World Series by the New York Yankees. Distributed by LAKANA and The Sports Xchange.
