Although it’s not record breaking, here are five ideas for spending that $301 million jackpot.\nWith $301 million, you could build about 33 bridges over Interstate 285 that would link the soon to be built Braves SunTrust Park with Galleria Center. Earlier this month, Cobb Commission Chairman Tim Lee announced construction on the bridge will be postponed and it will not be ready in time for the first Braves season at the new stadium. Today’s jackpot could give you the ability to buy about four of the $65 million jet Creflo Dollar is trying to buy. Getty Images Buying an electric car may not be the best way to stretch the $301 million in winnings. The jackpot would buy nearly 3,000 Tesla Roadsters, which start at about $101,500 each. Tyler Perry’s mansion may seem like it costs a fortune to most, but the jackpot winner would be able to buy the $25 million home on 17 acres along the Chattahoochee River 12 times over. Nearly a million yearlong, full print and digital subscriptions to the Atlanta Journal- Constitution. That would be equal a two-year subscription for just about every resident of metro Atlanta -- but you only need one.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/aresize/1000x633/img/photos/2015/06/18/c6/36/tyler-perry-house-above_1.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/aresize/1000x633/img/photos/2015/09/30/85/71/082414_gun_pardons_iPad.JPG", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/aresize/1000x633/img/photos/2015/05/20/84/37/bravesbridge.JPG", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/aresize/1000x633/img/photos/2013/08/13/00/0b/170113744_8.jpg", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/aresize/1000x633/img/photos/2015/06/03/0b/2c/creflo_dollar.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T20:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:11:00.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
