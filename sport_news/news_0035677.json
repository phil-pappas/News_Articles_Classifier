Wolf/The News Leader) 18 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSTUARTS DRAFT — Wilson Memorial and Stuarts Draft hooked up in a good old backyard brawl in high school football Friday night. \nIn a battle that nipped-and-tucked the entire game, the Hornets got the final points of the evening on a 4-yard touchdown run by Hunter Leary with 5:25 to play and outlasted Stuarts Draft 16-14. \nOn a perfect night, Stuarts Draft got the party started as Dylan Lehmann took a reverse on the opening kick 85 yards for a score and the Cougars led 7-0 just 13 seconds into the game. \nThe Hornets went right to work on their first possession starting at their own 20 and driving deep into Draft territory. A holding penalty forced a fourth down and Garret McBee nailed a 37-yard field goal and cut the Draft lead to 7-3 at 5:55 of first period. \nPoints were hard to come by for the rest of the first half as the defenses stiffened and the teams traded fumbles midway through the second. Marston Jones had an interception for the Cougars but they were unable to capitalize. \nA Wilson punt late in the half was downed at the Cougar 3. Two plays later, the Cougars coughed up the ball and McBee recovered at the Draft 1. Tad Bosserman dove in from there and the Hornets took a 10-7 to the locker room. \nThe Hornets took over at their own 30 midway through the third and drove into Cougar territory. Facing a fourth-and-2 at the Draft 23, Lehmann swept right and went 23 yards for a score that put Draft in front 14-10 with 46.7 seconds to play in the third. \nTrailing 16-14 Draft recovered a Wilson fumble at the Hornet 32, but had to settle for a 46-yard field goal attempt that fell just short. The Hornets were able to run out the clock. \n“I tell the kids all the time that they are going to face adversity at some time in the game, and tonight we did that a lot with the turnovers,” a happy Wilson coach Jeremiah Major said. “Its what you do with adversity. They fought through it, played hard and they earned this win. The defense played well. We finished drives tonight and that has been our motto.” \nBosserman paced the Wilson offense with 73 yards on 17 carries and a touchdown while Kyle Coombe added 40 yards on six carries and Leary had four rushes for 21 yards. \nJones and Lehmann each had 24 yards rushing and Lehmann had two catches for 23 yards and two touchdowns for the Cougars. \nThe game featured 10 total fumbles with Draft losing three and Wilson losing two. \nStuarts Draft (4-3) travels to Page County next week while Wilson (3-4) hosts Riverheads. \nWILSON MEMORIAL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:51:07.011+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
