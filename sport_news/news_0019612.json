Navarre added to its program's best start in history with a 35-0 win over District 2-6A rival Milton. After eight games, the Raiders will take on open week. \nNext: Bye. \n2. Tate Aggies 6-1, 2-0 \nSkinny: The Aggies secured a playoff spot and ended Escambia's postseason hopes with a win over the Gators last Friday. The Aggies will get a shot at one of the premier teams in the Panhandle this Friday in preparation for the District 1-6A championship in Week 10. \nNext: Friday at Choctaw. \n3 . Pine Forest Eagles 6-1, 2-0 \nSkinny: Like Tate, the Eagles secured a playoff spot by beating Washington last week. Pine Forest will host Niceville this Friday and seek to be battle tested for the crucial Tate game the following week. \nNext: Hosts Niceville Friday. \nSkinny: The Tigers suffered a tough, one-point loss to District 1-5A foe Arnold. Though it's not an ideal scenario, the Tigers' playoff hopes are still alive. However, they will need to win out in district play and get some help. \nNext: Hosts Mosley Friday* \n5. Escambia Gators 4-4, 0-2 \nSkinny: The defending District 1-6A champs will fail to repeat this year after a loss at Tate. The Gators will take a week off before returning for two home games — including the Battle for Ye' Olde Wash Boiler vs. Pensacola High. \nNext: Bye. \n6. West Florida Jaguars 4-3, 1-1 \nSkinny: After besting undefeated Bay last week, it seems the Jaguars deserve a jump. However, its week one loss to Escambia makes it tough for them to skip the Gators. The Jags will seek to continue to climb the District 1-5A rankings this Friday when they travel to face Arnold. \nNext: Friday at Bay.* \n7. Pace Patriots 3-5, 1-1 \nSkinny: The Patriots outran Gulf Breeze's passing attack for a key District 2-6A win last week. The Patriots will rest this week and focus on returning to preserve their playoff hopes. \nNext: Bye. \n8. Gulf Breeze Dolphins 2-6, 1-1 \nSkinny: The Dolphins have now dropped two straight after being outscored 48-26 by Pace. Gulf Breeze will get some rest Friday night, and hope to stun the district with a win over Navarre the following week. \nNext: Bye. \n9. Milton Panthers 5-3, 0-2 \nSkinny: After an overtime thriller two weeks ago, the Panthers were shut out by Navarre on Friday. Milton's hopes aren't out the window, but they are slim. The Panthers need a win over Pace in two weeks and a little extra help from Gulf Breeze. \nNext: Bye. \n10. Catholic Crusaders 2-6, 1-1 \nSkinny: The Catholic Crusaders have now dropped two straight after a District 1-3A loss to Taylor County. The Crusaders district season is over, and will now await the result of Taylor County vs. Florida High. \nNext: Hosts Washington Friday. \n11. Washington Wildcats 0-7, 0-2 \nSkinny: The Wildcats held an open week and used it to prepare for a district challenge this week. Xavier Saulsberry — top dual-threat QB in the area — and the Pine Forest Eagles will come to town, and the Wildcats may have their hands full in search of their first win. \nNext: Friday at Catholic. \n12. Northview Chiefs 2-5, 1-1 \nSkinny: The Chiefs grabbed a playoff spot with a 7-0 win over Jay. The Chiefs will be ready for a battle this week when they travel to face the undefeated Braves. \nNext: Friday at Walton. \n13. Jay Royals 1-7, 0-2 \nSkinny: The Royals contained Northview's potent offense, but were unable to put points on the board in a key District 1-1A game. \nNext: Friday at Rocky Bayou Christian. 3 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.pnj.com/1RUOyPL TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:55:25.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
