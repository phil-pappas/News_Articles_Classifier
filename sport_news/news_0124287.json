He's also attempting to complete some of the boldest goals any person can have: accomplishing world peace. \nAt the least, he'd have to make sure some countries' international relations were far more diplomatic than they are now to turn his team into a reality. And what's Prokhorov's dream? Why don't we let him tell you. \nFrom an interview he recently did with GQ : Q: Do you think you could beat Putin in a game of 1-on-1? What about Obama? A: I would prefer to have both of them join me in my box rooting for the same team, the Brooklyn Nets. Thatâ€™s kind of a dream of mine. \nI'll tell you this much: If Obama and Putin came to Barclays Center and were rooting for Prokhorov's team, the biggest news of the night would be that people were actually cheering for the Nets at a Nets game.
