The cops will be at Red Robin at Gurnee Mills from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. and 4 to 8 p.m. to benefit Special Olympics Illinois. In concert with Red Robin staff, the police will work as celebrity waiters, hosts and greeters. Diners can show their support by offering a \"tip\" at the end of their meal to benefit Special Olympics. The \"Tip-A-Cop\" fundraiser is one of several events Gurnee police participate in throughout the year to benefit Special Olympics Illinois and the Law Enforcement Torch Run.
