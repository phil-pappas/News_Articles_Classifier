He shot 27.6% from the field overall, and was 3-for-10 from three. \nPatterson was handed a golden opportunity and completely vanished on the offensive side of the floor. Defensively, he was good, his usual steady self, but he isn’t paid to be a defender, nor has he made his reputation on that end. He is expected to score and help make Toronto’s new motion offence deadlier than it would be with a non-three-point shooter like Luis Scola out there. \nThe Raptors want to space the floor, to have three true outside threats available at all times. Kyle Lowry and DeMarre Carroll provide that, but Patterson has to as well. \nHead coach Dwane Casey feels it is as simple as letting it fly. \n“Shooters never forget how to shoot, it’s like riding a bike, so he’s got to keep shooting it, get in the gym, get extra shots up, because that’s who he is. I’m not worried about Pat,” Casey said after the Raptors ended the exhibition campaign with a win over the Washington Wizards on Friday night. \n“That’s the stretch he’s going through, get it out now and be ready to come out next week when it’s for real and be ready to hit those shots.” \nThat’s all well and good to say, but the reality is that Patterson’s slump stretches back far further than just the past few weeks. \nPatterson was spectacular over last season’s first two months, emerging as an elite stretch four, ranking amongst the NBA’s leaders in outside shooting at north of 45%. That stretch carried his pre-all-star break numbers to 1.4 made three-pointers a game on 40.6% shooting, even though his accuracy from beyond the line dipped nearly 20% in January from his torrid December. \nAfter a wretched February, Patterson stabilized a bit in March, before cratering in eight April contests. His second half numbers were a far cry from the earlier results (30% outside shooting and 41.1% overall vs. 46.8% before the break). \nThe arrival of Carroll will likely lessen the need for Patterson to be hitting at least a little bit, but the offence still needs him to get going, especially with Lou Williams now gone. \nLast year, Patterson shot 43.9% from three and 48.6% overall in Toronto’s 49 wins, just 26.8/39.2% in the team’s losses. It wasn’t quite as Patterson goes, so go the Raptors, but he was definitely a difference-maker. \nPatterson intends to help himself by forcing himself into a bigger role, even though he is naturally an unselfish player (a trait perhaps picked up by playing on an absurdly talented Kentucky squad in college). \n“Turning down (shots earlier in the pre-season) was just me being passive, not being aggressive, just trying to pass the ball rather than shoot the ball,” Patterson told the Toronto Sun on Friday. \nWhether he likes it or not, Patterson will have to channel his inner Lou Williams at least a little bit and start bombing away. \nROSTER SET \nAs expected, the Raptors waived training camp invites Ronald Roberts, Axel Toupane, Michale Kyser and Shannon Scott on Saturday, the last day before their contracts would have become guaranteed. \nThough each player impressed at times, there simply was no room to keep any of them. \nIf the players clear waivers and accept an offer from the Raptors, they will be sent to the team’s NBA Development League franchise, Raptors 905 in Mississauga, though Roberts’ D-League rights are owned by another team, so something would have to be worked out there. \nPLAYING WITH STATS \nPre-season stats mean very little (Toronto has won 77% of its exhibition games under Casey, 48.8% of its regular-season contests), particularly because top players sit out or play limited minutes in most of them, but here are some good and bad Raptors stats: \nThe good: Ranked seventh in defensive rating (points allowed per 100 possessions), 10th in net rating, third in rebound percentage. \nThe bad: Ranked 23rd in field goal percentage, 24th in made three-pointers, 29th in assists and assists percentage and 24th in true shooting percentage. \nThe Raptors also played at the league’s slowest pre-season pace. \nTop individual performers: Lowry (22 points, 5.0 assists, 1.6 steals, 52.3% shooting); Carroll (11.3, 1.1, 1.0, 37.9% from three); Jonas Valanciunas (10.1, 6.4 rebounds, 56% shooting); Cory Joseph (9.9, 3.3, 0.9, 50%) and Scola (9.5, 5.7 rebounds in just 17.7 minutes). \nPatterson and DeMar DeRozan really struggled (28.8% shooting for DeRozan), while Terrence Ross was excellent defensively, but way off on offence. \nNow on to the real games. \nAROUND THE RIM \nWashington is really trying to hit more three-pointers this season. Former Raptor Kris Humphries had made two three-pointers in the regular season over his career, but has been nailing them as the team’s new starting power forward. He hit two against the Raptors and was over 35% on them for the pre-season ... The Clippers waived ex-Raptor Chuck Hayes and Dallas cut Canadian centre Samuel Dalembert.
