The Associated Press \nJosh Scobee’s miserable fourth quarter against the Baltimore Ravens cost him his job. \nThe Steelers cut the veteran kicker on Saturday, less than 48 hours after a pair of late missed field goals by Scobee helped the Ravens rally for a 23-20 overtime victory. Pittsburgh replaced Scobee on the roster with Chris Boswell, who has spent time with the Texans and Giants but has never kicked in a regular-season game. Notes \n• The Ravens have obtained wide receiver Chris Givens from the St. Louis Rams for a conditional draft pick. Now in his fourth NFL season, the 6-foot Givens has 88 catches for 1,433 yards and four touchdowns. The trade comes after Baltimore lost two receivers during Thursday’s win over Pittsburgh. Steve Smith hurt his back and was listed as day-to-day, and Michael Campanaro was placed on injured reserve with a back issue. \n• Lions running back Joique Bell has been ruled out of their game Monday at Seattle because of an ankle injury.
