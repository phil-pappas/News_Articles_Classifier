We had a real strong game,\" coach Joel Quenneville said. \"We had the puck in the offensive zone a lot, didn't give them many opportunities. … The young guys on the back end looked fine. Solid 2 points.\"\nSeabrook assisted on goals by Kane and Artem Anisimov. He logged 26 minutes of ice time and took a season-high 4 shots on goal.\nFellow defenseman Trevor van Riemsdyk played a career-high 22:34 and took 3 shots on goal.\nWhile it was a solid win, Seabrook said the team definitely missed Keith's presence.\n\"He's one of those special players that you notice every time that he's on the ice,\" Seabrook said. \"But guys stepped up and did a good job.\"\nCrawford was barely tested in the first two periods, facing just 9 shots on goal. But back-to-back penalties by Marcus Kruger and Niklas Hjalmarsson gave the Panthers a 5-on-3 power play that Jaromir Jagr cashed in on with 12:36 left in the game to trim the Hawks' lead to 3-2.\nThe Hawks held on from there, though, and extended their winning streak over Florida (3-3-1) to eight.\n\"Crow was a wall again,\" Seabrook said.\nBickell sits: Bryan Bickell was a healthy scratch during the Hawks' win over Florida at the United Center. Including playoffs, Bickell hasn't scored 26 straight games and has just 6 assists over that time.\nCoach Joel Quenneville wasn't pleased with the veteran's play against Columbus on Saturday.\nThe coach had a talk with his player during Thursday's morning skate.\n\"Well I don't want to get too much in our conversation,\" Quenneville said. \"I just said I didn't mind the way he was playing. I thought his last game was ordinary.\n\"We've got some other guys who could come out as well, and have come out as well. You got to do what you can to get yourself back in there and get quality ice time.\"\nBickell was already the fourth forward in just seven games to be a healthy scratch, joining Viktor Tikhonov, Kyle Baun and Ryan Garbutt.\nSlapshots: Jonathan Toews hasn't scored a goal in the Hawks' first seven games, something he's only done twice before in his career. Toews' longest stretch to open a season without a goal was in 2008-09 when he didn't score until the Hawks' 13th game. … In six career games, Corey Crawford has a .935 save percentage against Florida. ... Jaromir Jagr now has 206 power-play goals in his career. He moved past Joe Sakic into 12th place all time in that category.\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
