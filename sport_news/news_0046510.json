The fourth-ranked Horned Frogs hopped past them with a decisive 47-7 victory.\nUtah coach Kyle Whittingham said the lesson learned was to play better. Plain and simple.\n“They came in and they got after us — started fast and we never recovered,” said Whittingham, who dismissed any notion that the loss had anything to do with the pomp and circumstance associated with a visit by the “College GameDay” crew.\n“I don’t believe so. I thought we were in the right mindset,” Whittingham said. “Now it was a while ago so I can’t remember exactly. But we had a good week of practice, I remember that. There was no telltale signs going into the game that we were going to get blitzkrieg like we did.”\nSenior wide receiver Kenneth Scott, who was on the sideline that day, remembers it well. He brought it up in a meeting with the team leadership group earlier this week as the fifth-ranked Utes prepare for Saturday’s game against No. 23 California.\n“I compared it to the 2010 year,” he said, noting the similarities in terms of a high ranking for Utah and the “College GameDay” presence on campus.\nThe unsettling part, obviously, was the outcome of the game. Scott said the Utes “basically laid an egg” that Saturday.\n“It actually haunted us for a couple of weeks. Because after that week we lost to Notre Dame and plus we went against San Diego State and almost lost,” Scott said. “So we’ve just got to keep on remaining humble, act like we’re still not in the top 25 at all — still got that humbleness and everything should be OK.”\nLooking back, Scott acknowledged that TCU was very hot that week.\n“At the end of the day it showed that they wanted it more — just by their performance,” Scott said. “They performed really well against us that year. So they definitely deserved it.”\nAlthough this week is an opportunity for “College GameDay” redemption, of sorts, Scott doesn’t necessarily look at it that way. He did admit that being at the center of the college football universe for a day is a good thing\n“I don’t really let the hype get to me, to be honest with you, but it’s pretty cool for the people that like that type of stuff,” Scott said. “It’s really cool for our program to get on the national scale.”\nUtah is hosting the show for the third time. The first outing proved to be extremely productive. A 52-21 victory over BYU on Nov. 20, 2004, lifted the Utes to a Fiesta Bowl bid. The original BCS busters went on to cap a perfect season with a 35-7 win over Pittsburgh.\nEmail: dirk@desnews.com \nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T14:58:58.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
