(AP Photo/Brett Flashnick) × COLUMBIA — Steve Spurrier will hold a press conference Tuesday, just as he does every week during the season. But this one promises to be very different. South Carolina’s head coach will announce his retirement, effective immediately. And Shawn Elliott, USC’s co-offensive coordinator and offensive line coach, will become interim head coach and lead the Gamecocks for the remainder of this season, according to a report by ESPN. Spurrier will step down as the most successful coach in South Carolina history, with an 86-49 record in 10 and a half seasons at USC. He took over a program which had never won more than 10 games in a season and made it relevant nationally, peaking with three consecutive 11-win seasons from 2011-14. The Gamecocks finished that 2014 campaign ranked No. 4 nationally, their highest ever standing at the end of the year. At 2-4 overall and 0-4 in the SEC, this year’s South Carolina team is off to its worst start in conference play since the 0-11 campaign suffered in 1999 under Spurrier’s predecessor, Lou Holtz. With three top-10 opponents remaining in its final six games, USC is on pace for its first losing season since Holtz’s 2003 team went 5-6. Spurrier, 70, has not suffered a losing season as a college coach since his first, a 5-6 campaign during his debut at Duke in 1987. In the three decades which have followed, he’s suffered only two losing marks — both with the Washington Redskins of the NFL, whom he coached in 2002 and 2003. Elliott, in his sixth season at South Carolina, also served as an assistant for 13 years at his alma mater, Appalachian State. The 42-year-old Camden native, who has never been a head coach, also played for the Mountaineers. Check back with postandcourier,com for further updates on this story.
