(WCIV) -- ABC News 4's Scott Eisberg and the Post and Courier's Andrew Miller make their picks on the biggest games of the week in high school football. How will they fare? Tune in each week to find out! \nThis week's games have been shuffled around a lot due to a stalled weather pattern dropping a lot of rain on the coast. In some areas, up to 10 inches are expected. To get the latest on when the games are being played, click here . \nFort Dorchester at West Ashley Eisberg: Signature win for West Ashley coach Bobby Marion’s bunch at Summerville last week. Enjoy it while you can. All Patriots in this one. Fort Dorchester, 54-14. \nMiller: After a few stumbles early in the season, West Ashley’s Marion has the Wildcats on a roll. Unfortunately, it won’t be enough against Fort Dorchester and QB Dakereon Joyner. Fort Dorchester, 41-20. \nGoose Creek at Ashley Ridge Eisberg: One heck of a ballgame, I think Chris Candor’s team getting over a huge mental hurdle with the comeback win over the team from Alabama last week. Swamp Foxes stay perfect though in a battle at Ashley Ridge. Ashley Ridge, 21-20. \nMiller: Is this Ashley Ridge’s breakout season? With Swamp Foxes QB Steven Duncan playing like he has so far, it’ll be a tall task for anyone to beat Ashley Ridge. Home field is the difference. Ashley Ridge, 31-28. \nSummerville at Stratford Eisberg: Both teams desperately need a win, Summerville has shown explosiveness in spurts this year, Stratford just hasn’t yet so I’ll go with the Green Wave. Summerville, 35-21. \nMiller: Can’t figure out the Green Wave this season. Picked wrong every week. So, Summerville fans might get mad, but I’m sticking with Joe Call and the Green Wave. Summerville, 24-21. \nWando at Bluffton Eisberg: I’m assuming after the thumping at Fort Dorchester, Jimmy Noonan’s bunch, enjoying a “fun” week of practice at Wando. It’ll show on the field as they bounce back against Bluffton. Wando, 38-24. \nMiller: Last week was an embarrassing loss for the Warriors, 63-0 against Fort Dorchester. Bluffton doesn’t have Dakereon Joyner as their quarterback, but still too much for Wando. Bluffton, 38-31. \nAcademic Magnet at North Charleston Eisberg: Who would have thought, a showdown of undefeated squads at Attaway-Heinsohn Field. Two words, Nate Schlosser. The TD machine for the Raptors is the difference. Academic Magnet, 28-10. \nMiller: Raptors running back Nate Schlosser might be pound-for-pound the best running back in the Lowcountry. He’ll get his yards against North Charleston. Academic Magnet, 27-13. \nBeaufort at Berkeley Eisberg: Both coaches may be looking forward to the showdown at Death Valley on Saturday. Former Clemson teammates Jeff Cruce and Mark Clifford, old friends, fierce competitors setting up for a great game. Berkeley back on track. Berkeley, 33-27. \nMiller: Both squads coming off big wins last week. Stags down Timberland and Beaufort crushes Manning. Can the Stags keep the momentum going for another week? Don’t think so. Beaufort, 23-20. \nTune in next week to see how the Miller and Eisberg fared and see next week's picks. \nEach Friday night, ABC News 4 streams a TruMoo Friday Night Rivals game of the week online. The coverage starts at 7 p.m. on MyTV Charleston and abcnews4.com. With the rain creating problems around the Lowcountry and changing football schedules, the Game of the Week has been moved to next week.
