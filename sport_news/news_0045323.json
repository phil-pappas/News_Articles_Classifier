Picked to repeat as Mountain East Conference champions, Garin Justice's Mountain Lions enter the game at 3-2, coming off a 29-21 defeat to the University of Charleston last Thursday. Meanwhile, UVa-Wise is still in search of its first win of 2015. A week ago, the Cavaliers were unable to hold a 28-point first quarter lead in a 52-45 defeat to West Virginia State. \nUVa-Wise's defense combined with the team's special teams unit to score 21 points in the first half of last week's game. The last points game on the final play of the half when Zachary Blair blocked a kick that led to a 100-yard return by Maurice Watkins for six points. The game was the third in as many home games that UVa-Wise entered halftime tied or with the lead. \nFor the Cavs to have a chance Saturday, they will have to play four quarters. Half of the team's 104 points scored this season have come in the opening 15 minutes. Opponents are outscoring UVa-Wise 182-52 after the first quarter. \nA look back to last year's meeting should provide UVa-Wise some confidence. Concord led by just seven at 20-13 mid-way through the fourth quarter before penalties and two late scores by the Mountain Lions led to a 30-13 win on a snowy day in Wise. \nConcord gained 205 yards on the ground in last year's meeting after quarterback Brian Novak connected on just seven of 24 pass attempts and was picked off twice. Odds are, it will have to be Novak and his receivers that leads the Mountain Lions Saturday. UVa-Wise ranks 12th nationally and first in the MEC in rushing defense at 78 yards per game in 2015. \nThe Cavaliers were able to get some traction on the ground last week. The team rushed for 150 yards, 143 came from quarterback Jeremy Eubank and Carlton Griffith. Last year, Griffith gained 108 yards against Concord. \nNext week, UVa-Wise returns home to face West Liberty University in a 1 p.m. kickoff while Concord is back on the road to face Notre Dame College.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:21:37.692+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
