There's a handful of teams at the top — Houston, Memphis and Temple — that still have dreams of playing in a New Year's Six bowl game, then a huge middle tier of teams hovering around .500, then the bottom-feeders. (Looking at you, Central Florida.)\nThere will be plenty of moving and shaking over the next few weeks, as most teams dive headfirst into conference play and begin jockeying for position in their respective divisions. For now, though, here's a look at the lay of the land in the AAC entering this week's games.\n1. Temple (5-0, 2-0 AAC): It's a good time to be an Owls fan. Temple routed Tulane last week, 49-10, to improve to 5-0 for the first time since 1974. Then, on Tuesday, the university announced that it has sold out its Halloween home game against Notre Dame. In addition to its opener against Penn State, that's two sellouts for Temple this season. The Owls may not run away with the AAC East division, but they're certainly in the driver's seat. They'll host a disastrous UCF team on Saturday.\n1a. Memphis (5-0, 2-0 AAC): The Tigers climbed three spots in the coaches' poll after a bye week, but they remain stuck at 1a in our conference rankings. Next week, they will be in a different spot, one way or the other. I promise. A win over No. 13 Ole Miss on Saturday would be the biggest win for the AAC this season, much bigger than even Temple's victory over Penn State. It will also be the most talented opponent Memphis will face all season.\n3. Houston (5-0, 2-0 AAC): A 49-28 win over SMU on national television propelled the Cougars into the Associated Press Top 25 this week. Detractors will point to the team's light schedule and lack of quality wins. Supporters will point to quarterback Greg Ward Jr. as a fringe Heisman candidate. The bottom line is that Houston has been, and will continue to be, a tough matchup for everyone on its schedule. This week, that's Tulane on Friday night.\n4. Navy (4-1, 2-0 AAC): The Midshipmen got the conference's first crack against Notre Dame over the weekend and came up short, losing 41-24. (Temple hosts the Irish in two weeks.) Though Navy is no longer unbeaten, it has an open week to recover and recharge for the stretch run, beginning with a game against Tulane on Oct. 24.\n5. Cincinnati (3-2, 0-2 AAC): The Bearcats were idle last week and will be the third AAC team in three weeks to travel to BYU. Friday's game against the Cougars will also mark the third game in a row that Cincinnati has not played on a Saturday. The most interesting development here is at quarterback, where the once-injured Gunner Kiel has returned to practice and now finds himself in an open competition with freshman Hayden Moore. Tommy Tuberville has said he will wait until just before kickoff to decide who will start.\n6. Tulsa (3-2, 0-1 AAC): The Golden Hurricane ran a conference-record 107 plays in a 34-24 victory over Louisiana-Monroe. Quarterback Dane Evans has thrown for 300 yards in every game he's played this season. Tulsa may not be able to keep pace with Houston, Memphis and Navy in the West division this year, but the future is bright under Philip Montgomery. The Golden Hurricane will travel to East Carolina on Saturday.\n7. East Carolina (3-3, 1-1 AAC): Say what you will about the Pirates' .500 record, but their three losses have ranged from reasonable to impressive. Last weekend against BYU, for example, they rallied from a 38-21 deficit entering the fourth quarter to tie the game with four minutes left. They wound up losing, 45-38, on a touchdown with 19 seconds left, but the comeback spoke volumes. East Carolina will be in for a sneaky good game this week against Tulsa.\n8. Connecticut (3-3, 1-1 AAC): The so-called \"Civil Conflict\" didn't really have a lot of conflict. The Huskies built a double-digit lead in the second quarter and cruised to a 40-13 win over Central Florida over the weekend, thereby winning a trophy that their own coach, Bob Diaco, had created. Strange. That said, Connecticut's defense continues to look strong. We'll see how it handles Marlon Mack and South Florida on Saturday.\n9. South Florida (2-3, 0-1 AAC): The Bulls beat Syracuse over the weekend, 45-24, to give the AAC a winning record against Atlantic Coast Conference teams this season. South Florida racked up 535 yards of offense, led by a career-high 259 passing yards from quarterback Quinton Flowers, in an uncharacteristically high-scoring game. Next up: A trip to East Hartford on Saturday for a meeting with the Huskies.\n10. Tulane (2-3, 1-1 AAC): There was a brief moment over the weekend when the Green Wave looked like it was actually going to challenge Temple. Tulane forced two early turnovers and led 10-7 in the second quarter. Then the Owls scored 42 unanswered points, and that was about it. The road doesn't get easier for Tulane, either. After hosting Houston on Friday, it'll play at Navy, then at Memphis on Halloween.\n11. SMU (1-5, 0-2 AAC): The Mustangs have won two of their past 18 games. Not very good. They've shown glimpses of improvement under first-year coach Chad Morris, especially on offense, but that improvement hasn't resulted in many wins. SMU's most recent loss was more of the same: A 49-28 defeat against Houston in which the Mustangs trailed by a touchdown at halftime and struggled in the second half. They're off this week and will play at USF on Oct. 24.\n12. Central Florida (0-6, 0-2 AAC): George O'Leary stepped down as the Knights' interim athletic director this week, but he did not fire himself as head football coach before doing so. He should have at least considered it. Saturday's lopsided loss to UConn was the most recent chapter in UCF's steep football decline. Injuries have played a role in the team's struggles, but they're not solely to blame. And Temple's up next this week. Good luck with that.", "external_links": ["http://app.contenttools.co/polls/2017/embed.js?show_name=yes&show_description=yes&show_sharing_options=yes&show_cover_image=yes"], "published": "2015-10-14T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:43:39.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
