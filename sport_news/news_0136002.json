There was another bogey at 12 but back-to-back birdies on 15 and 16 gave him a chance at forcing a play-off. \nBut when needing to birdie the par-four 18th, his attempted putt from just off the green came up short. \nKevin Na, the 2011 winner, also had a shot at joining Kaufman on 15 under but his 15-foot putt on the last narrowly missed the hole. \nIn a quote on PGA Tour's Twitter account, Kaufman said about his long wait: \"That was so much more stressful than playing. Felt like I was watching LSU.\" \nFellow American Patton Kizzire tied for second after a fine final-round charge of his own. \nKizzire birdied the first, eighth, ninth, 10th, 12th, 13th, 15th and 17th for an eight-under 63. \nHe was joined for a share of second by Stegmaier, Na, Germany's Alex Cejka and American duo Cameron Tringale and Jason Bohn. \nMorgan Hoffmann - who started the day in second - finished tied for 11th on 12 under after a level-par 71, while Rickie Fowler ended three shots further back. \nEngland's Greg Owen, who was in contention after the first round, fired his second-best round of the week to end on five under alongside Martin Laird, while Laird's fellow Scot Russell Knox was two shots better off after a closing 66.
