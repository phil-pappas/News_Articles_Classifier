He threw two touchdowns in the game.\nManziel was not failing as a quarterback in the NFL, but just last Monday it was apparent that he failed the most important aspect of his football career, and his personal life, thus far.\nHe failed at rehab.\nWhen someone, especially an NFL icon like Manziel, gets out of rehab, he should get himself away from that kind of temptation.\nSince he clearly failed to do so, it has now led to the big question concerning Manziel’s football career: Is he becoming too much of a liability?\nMy answer is yes.\nMany people, however, have come to the defense of Manziel with the famous “kids-will-be-kids” saying.\nBut he is not a kid. He is a young adult who is being paid a lot of money while receiving all the fame and benefits of being an NFL player. But, when things go wrong, they’re suddenly “just kids”?\nThat’s absurd.\nTampa Bay quarterback Jameis Winston is a perfect example of how a player facing similar distractions can turn himself around. Winston had his share of troubles in college at Florida State but has come into the league this year as a young rookie with a good mind-set, and that’s to do his job and play football.\nGranted, if Manziel were the everyday starter I don’t believe this incident would have happened due to all the responsibility he would have had as a starting quarterback in the NFL.\nIf Manziel acts like this as a backup quarterback in the NFL, why would a team want to risk this happening with him as the starter?\nI wouldn’t be surprised if the Browns release him at the end of the season, and I strongly believe no team would risk picking him up.\nIf I’m Manziel, I’m sitting down and really thinking about what happened this week because Manziel’s walking on thin ice, and it’s starting to crack.\nIt’s probably best if he doesn’t “Play like a Brown,” but starts to “Act like a Brown.”\nOr maybe he should “Act like an Adult.”\nmicbhern@indiana.edu", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:49:17.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
