Is Melvin Gordon the next LaDainian Tomlinson, or the next Ryan Mathews? Let's put it this way: Even Ryan Mathews has outperformed the rookie. \n5. How will the Cowboys' RB committee shake out? This remains a work in progress, but so far, nobody has made Dallas fans forget about Murray. Heading into Week 8, Darren McFadden appears to have earned his shot at the lead role, but this committee is far from settled. \n6. Will Cam Newton throw a TD pass to a wideout this season? Yes. Yes, he will. Five of them, in fact, with Ted Ginn Jr. - of all people - hauling in three. \n7. Which rookies will make an immediate impact? With the exception of Amari Cooper - and possibly Stefon Diggs - the 2015 WR class can't hold the jocks of last year's stellar lot. Meanwhile, as predicted here, Todd Gurley is da bomb. Ameer Abdullah and Gordon have mostly squandered their opportunities, while T.J. Yeldon and Duke Johnson offer promise down the stretch. Marcus Mariota and Jameis Winston have shown flashes but are essentially desperation-only fantasy starters. \n8. What antics does Bill Belichick have in store for his backfield this year? For starters, nobody saw Dion Lewis coming. Then precious few benefited from LeGarrette Blount's three-touchdown outing against the Jaguars. And those who figured Blount would get a heavy workload against the Jets while Lewis (abdomen) was sidelined were treated to a big fat goose egg on Sunday. \n9. After a year's hiatus, will Adrian Peterson return to elite form? We haven't seen the A.P. of old just yet, but he's still a fantasy force to be reckoned with. \n10. Will the Jaguars produce a single fantasy stud? How about the Titans? Or the Browns? The Jags' passing game has been surprisingly impressive, even with limited contributions from Julius Thomas. Travis Benjamin has represented Cleveland well. But nobody is jealous of the Titans on your roster. Or your 49ers. \nThat said, we still have more than half a season remaining. What we think we know today will likely be turned on its head come playoff time. \n@ladd_biro).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:07:45.447+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
