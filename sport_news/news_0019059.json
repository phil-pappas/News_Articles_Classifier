(WTOP/Noah Frank) \nWASHINGTON — Our first DMV Game of the Week was a bruising, defensive struggle for a half before DeMatha’s superior size and health allowed them to run away from St. John’s. What was a 6-0 halftime deficit (and could well have been no worse than a tie game for the Cadets, but for a late interception) turned into a 40-0 rout. \nThanks to that performance and the schedule dealing another key WCAC rivalry game, DeMatha (6-0) is back among the options for this week’s DMV Game of the Week, as the Stags draw an undefeated Gonzaga (6-0) team at home. \nDeMatha survived its biggest threat of the season last week, escaping with a 52-47 road win over Bishop McNamara, a team Gonzaga beat by 10 earlier this year. The Eagles coasted to a 57-20 win over Bishop O’Connell to set up the biggest WCAC match of the year to date. \nIn Maryland, Quince Orchard (5-1) is riding a five-game winning streak in which they’ve outscored every opponent by at least 30 points. The Cougars play host to Germantown’s Northwest (4-2), fresh off a 29-12 victory over Richard Montgomery, the Jaguars’ third win in their last four contests. \nFinally, Ashburn, Virginia’s Broad Run (6-0) takes their undefeated season across town to face Stone Bridge (3-3), fresh off a tough loss. Last year, the Bulldogs earned a 17-9 victory over the Spartans, making this a revenge game for Broad Run as well. \nVote below by 11:59 p.m. Wednesday to decide this week’s DMV Game of the Week, and email us to nominate future matchups for consideration.
