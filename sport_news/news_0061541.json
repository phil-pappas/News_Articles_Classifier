It comes and goes, but only recently did people realize so many of their neighbors were dealing with the same problem.\nThe brown water leaves nearly impossible to remove stains on toilets, tubs and sinks. People claim it’s giving them health problems and rashes.\nThe Rainier View Water Company operates this local Southwood Water System. A spokesman said the water is from naturally occurring wells and has safe levels of minerals in it.\nThe spokesman said five months ago, the company put in a new filtration system in, which will eventually improve things. Since then, the company has been flushing the pipes and expects the water to be better in another six months to a year.\nHowever, neighbors like Sanders are tired of excuses. She is refusing to pay her bill this month.\ncomment (1)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-22T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:06:22.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
