(AP Photo/Raad Adayleh) \nZURICH (AP) — FIFA presidential contender Prince Ali bin al-Hussein says the governing body would be further discredited if the emergency election was delayed. \nFIFA’s executive committee, where the Jordanian royal was a member until May, could decide at next week’s meeting to postpone the scheduled Feb. 26 poll. \nFIFA is under the acting presidency of Issa Hayatou, who temporily took the role Thursday when Sepp Blatter was suspended for at least 90 days pending the outcome of an investigation into alleged wrongdoing. \nPrince Ali said Wednesday that “with FIFA’s crisis deepening, the organization needs to move beyond interim leadership and elect an accountable president.” \nThe prince added that delaying the election would “create further instability” and signal that the secret deals that “discredited FIFA in the first place continue.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:08:29.271+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
