The squads were scoreless at halftime. \nJenna Stearns made four saves in the cage for Camden Hills, while Kaylin Mansir made one save in goal for Gardiner. The Tigers held a 5-1 lead in shots and a 7-3 edge in penalty corners. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Heal Point Standings for Class B North, Camden Hills (7-6, 41.9388 points) is eighth, while Gardiner (11-2, 119.7959 points) is first in the 14-team region.
