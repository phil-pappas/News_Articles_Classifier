He hasn’t played since getting injured in the opener against the Giants. \nThe Cowboys (2-3) have lost all three games without Bryant and quarterback Tony Romo, who broke his left collarbone a week after Bryant went out. After the game against the Giants (3-3), Romo will miss at least three more games. \nReceiver Brice Butler will be available for Dallas after missing a loss to New England with a strained hamstring. \nThe Cowboys traded for Butler after Bryant’s injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:20:02.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
