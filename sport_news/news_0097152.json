Comment Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 10:56 AM By Associated Press Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 10:56 AM St. Paul, Minn. A long-anticipated announcement is expected soon on a stadium location for Minnesota's Major League Soccer expansion franchise. An email from St. Paul Area Chamber of Commerce President Matt Kramer to his board members says Minnesota United owner Bill McGuire and St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman on Friday will announce a stadium location at University and Snelling. The vacant property in St. Paul is owned by the Metropolitan Council. Seven months ago, the league and Minnesota United were focusing on Minneapolis for an 18,000-seat stadium. But that would have taken valuable land near Target Field off the tax rolls. The effort stalled and the team turned to St. Paul and a former transit bus storage site. Gov. Mark Dayton has said he would support legislative action to enact a tax break for the privately-built stadium.
