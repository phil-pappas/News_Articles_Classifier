The 6-foot-10 forward could only meagerly raise his arms as Richaun Holmes soared over him on Sunday afternoon. The Sixers rookie used two hands to posterize Harper, grabbing his first highlight-reel worthy dunk since being drafted in June. \nHolmes, a 6-10 forward, was a flashy dunker in college at Bowling Green. It was only a matter of time until he threw down his first thunderous slam with the Sixers. \n\"It's probably No. 1 right now,\" Holmes said about his dunk after Sunday's 92-91 loss. \"My first big one in the NBA. To have that moment in the NBA is a special moment.\" \nThe dunk was the finish to a masterful pick-and-roll. Holmes handed off the ball to Pierre Jackson and set a pick on Jackson's defender. He then quickly rolled and Jackson bounced him an easy pass between two defenders. The last man to beat was Harper. \n\"He shows a level of toughness and the ability to stretch the floor,\" head coach Brett Brown said. \"He doesn't look uncomfortable shooting the three. There's a presence. There's a toughness in him at the rim.\" \nHolmes was more of a \"pick-and-pop\" player in college, as he would move to an open spot after setting a pick and knock down a jumper. He said he's growing more comfortable with being able to determine when it is the right time to roll off a pick and head to the basket. \nThis season, Brown is encouraging his players to inject \"random pick-and-rolls\" into the offense. The pick-and-rolls help give the team an offensive stability as they deal with a consistent roster turnover. It would be impossible, Brown said, to teach a Princeton offense when the team has used 48 players the last two seasons. \n\"The kids come from AAU backgrounds, they're one-and-done in college,\" Brown said. \"At this stage, what I have to do is not fight it, I just have to corral it and have discipline within chaos, if you will. Random pick-and-rolls are a part of that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:45:47.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
