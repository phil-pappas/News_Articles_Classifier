Whitham \nSenior tailback Christian Trefz rushed for a pair of long touchdowns, helping the St. Joseph High football team pin a 49-28 defeat on Fairfield Warde on Saturday at the Dalling Sports Complex. \nTrefz ripped off a 60-yard score with 5:40 left in the first half, pushing the Cadet lead to 21-0 after the third of Nick DiCairano’s seven successful PATs. \n“Our offense did great today,” Trefz said. “We really stuck it to them… We came out and we did what we had to do” \nWarde (1-4) countered with its lone scoring drive of the first half, moving 73 yards in nine plays. Quarterback Jack Potenza capped the drive with a 9-yard touchdown scramble, narrowing the Mustang margin to 21-6 with 1:48 left. \nThe conversion try failed, St. Joseph took over on its own 37 and for the second straight possession, Trefz scored on the first play from scrimmage. \nThis time, he raced 63 yards to paydirt, extending the Cadet advantage to 28-6 at the break. \n“I thought we played very well offensively,” St. Joseph High head coach Joe Della Vecchia said. “Christian has been running the ball really well.” \nThe Cadets (4-1) kept the pressure up in the third quarter, with quarterback Corey Babineau throwing a pair of touchdown passes. \nSpencer Lucas hauled in the first one from eight yards out at the 8:52 mark of the third, before Liam Seperack caught a 6-yard scoring strike from the junior signalcaller. \nBabineau then rushed for his third touchdown of the game, this time from a yard out, to push the lead to 49-6 with 58 seconds left in the quarter. \nPotenza responded with a 46-yard touchdown pass to Mike Whiting, with Clayton Mitchell running in the conversion, to close out the third quarter with Warde trailing 49-14. \nIn the final frame, R.J. Bebey, from 16 yards out on a pass from Potenza, and Potenza, on a 19-yard keeper, notched touchdowns for Warde. But it was far too little, far too late, as the Cadets cruised to their second straight FCIAC victory. \nSt. Joseph will look to run its win streak to three games next week, when it travels to Stamford High (3-3) for a 6:30 p.m. kickoff on Oct. 30. \nWarde hosts winless Danbury High (0-5) at Tetreau/Davis Field on Friday at 7.
