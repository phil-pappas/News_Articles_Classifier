Birney Crum Stadium. \nTurning point : Right after the Blue Eagles put together some good chances on offense, the Trojans took possession and went on the counterattack. Brooke Schutter dribbled the ball before sliding a pass over to Chelsea Hudson. The junior forward then finished off the goal as she struck the ball just inside of the far post with 28:49 left in the first half. \nTop performer: Regan Allsop. The Trojans' senior goalie made a few clutch saves in the first half to help preserve her shutout streak that now stands at 16 games. Her defense made sure she saw less action in the second half. \nWhat it means: Parkland advances to play the winner of Whitehall-Pleasant Valley Thursday in the EPC championship at a site and time to be determined. Nazareth played well but couldn't break through in the scoring column and now must get back to work before district play begins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:56:22.651+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
