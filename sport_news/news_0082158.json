He made his debut with the Wheat Kings on Saturday. (COLIN CORNEAU/BRANDON SUN) \nNever discount the power of a dream. \nWhen James Shearer was deciding last week whether to join his hometown Brandon Wheat Kings in the Western Hockey League or retain his American college eligibility by staying in Junior A, he weighed a lot of factors. But one intangible ultimately brought the 18-year-old home from the Manitoba Junior Hockey League’s Steinbach Pistons. \n\"I had a tough decision to make but I think I made the right one,\" Shearer said shortly after the game on Saturday. \"Steinbach was a great place, I was playing lots of minutes and I was playing good. Eventually, maybe, I would have started talking to a couple of schools here and there but it’s always been my dream to play for Brandon. It came up and I couldn’t turn it down.\" \nA former bantam draft pick of the WHL’s Calgary Hitmen, Shearer was in his second season with the Pistons after two with the Brandon Midget AAA Wheat Kings. Shearer had 38 points in 48 games last season and was named the MJHL’s rookie of the year. \nThe five-foot-nine, 197-pound rearguard said the experience was really good for his game. \n\"I think it improved me immensely,\" Shearer said. \"Right out of midget, they gave me a chance and put me on the second-line power play last year and put me in key spots. All the practices there and all the mentoring, it helped a lot. Now I’ve taken the next step and have a lot of work to do.\" \nAfter signing with the Wheat Kings on Friday, Shearer watched them at home against the Swift Current Broncos that night, starting his WHL career a night later in Saskatoon against the Blades. Wearing No. 32, he was noticeably antsy on the bench during the anthem. \n\"It was pretty special,\" Shearer said. \"I always get a little movement going during the anthem but that was a little different. There were a few more butterflies but I’m happy to be here.\" \nHe acquitted himself well, cleaning up his own end, making some long outlet passes and at one point diving to break up a potential breakaway pass. \n\"After the first shift I calmed down a little bit and definitely after the first period I felt a little more comfortable out there,\" Shearer said. \"I still have a lot more work to do but I have to improve every game.\" \nThere will be plenty of familiar faces on the bench for Shearer, who played with the other five Brandonites on the roster — Tanner Kaspick, Tyler Coulter, Connor Gutenberg, Duncan Campbell and Ty Lewis — as he grew up. \nKaspick, who played with Shearer for years, was thrilled with the defenceman’s arrival. \n\"I know what kind of player he is and I’m glad that he gets to come here and show everyone else,\" Kaspick said. \"He’s a really good player who plays responsibly at both ends of the ice. He has a physical presence, he has a great shot from the blue-line. He’s a good addition.\" \nHis other teammates will have a chance to get to know him as well with the team on a two-week trip that will take them through the U.S. Division, with games against the Kootenay Ice and Moose Jaw Warriors on the way home. \nHead coach and general manager Kelly McCrimmon said the familiarity Shearer has with the other Brandon players will help him with the transition. He was impressed with Shearer’s debut effort. \n\"He was solid,\" McCrimmon said. \"It was a good first game for him. It was probably a little easier for him to go in (on the road) as opposed to at home when he’s from Brandon,\" McCrimmon said. \"By the time we get home, he’ll have gained a lot of experience. It’s great for him to join our team when he did in terms of fitting in with our team and getting settled.\" \nShearer considers himself fortunate to be joining one of the top-ranked junior teams in Canada. \n\"Even in practice you can tell that this is a special group,\" Shearer said. \"I’m excited for the year.\" \nINTERNATIONAL CALLS: Wheat King forwards Jayce Hawryluk, John Quenneville and Nolan Patrick and defenceman Kale Clague have been chosen to play for Team WHL in the CHL Canada Russia Series next month in B.C. The games will be played on Nov. 9 in Kelowna and Nov. 10 in Kamloops. Wheat Kings head coach/GM will be an assistant on Dave Lowry’s coaching staff, while Calgary Hitmen blue-liner Travis Sanheim of Elkhorn will also play for Team WHL. Teams from each of the CHL’s three member leagues will take on a Russian national team in a six-game series, with the WHL hosting the first two contests. \nMeanwhile, the teams have been named for the World Under-17 Hockey Challenge, beginning on Dec. 1 in Dawson Creek and Fort St. John, B.C. Wheat King Stelio Mattheos will play on Canada Black, one of three Hockey Canada entries in the event. Brandon prospect Jarrod Gourley is a late addition to the event, joining fellow Wheat King draft pick Ian Mitchell on the Canada White blue-line. Roblin’s Josh Brook will play for Canada Red. \nICINGS: Wheat Kings draft pick Brad Goethals, a 16-year-old with the Eastman Selects, is the Manitoba AAA Midget Hockey League player of the week after posting four goals and two assists in two games on the weekend. \n» pbergson@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:36:43.605+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
