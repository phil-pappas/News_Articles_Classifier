His times in Columbia broke his own school records. \"I don't really go swimming to break records,\" he explained.\"I just swim to be the fastest person out there.\" Along with Gieseke the Pirates 200 freestyle relay qualified for the state meet as well.The success at the COMO Invitational is just part of what the Pirates are trying to accomplish as they attempt to build a team full of young talent.\"The freshmen are working hard because the seniors are working hard,\" head coach Brenda Hallbauer said.\"They want to be where the seniors are but they have a long way to go to get there.\" It all means the future is bright for this band of Pirates \"Hopefully we'll bring in those young ones, the sophomores and freshmen, to where they are making state cuts\" Hallbauer explained.The Pirates aren't done trying to qualify more events for state.The hope is at least two more relays will get a chance to swim on Missouri's biggest stage in St. Peter's in early November.
