A A A \nThe Master’s College women’s soccer team has been almost unstoppable at home this season. \nPrior to Wednesday afternoon’s 3-1 loss to San Diego Christian College, the Mustangs were 7-0 at Reese Field. \nBut the Hawks scored three different ways — off a rebound, a free kick and a long ball from 45 yards out — to hand TMC its first home loss of the season. \n“They were more organized than we were,” said TMC head coach Curtis Lewis. “We had numerous opportunities in the second half, and we just couldn’t finish.” \nTMC did have the advantage in the number of shots on goal (11 shots to seven) and the number of corner kicks over San Diego (five to one), but the Mustangs couldn’t put the ball in the back of the net until the 75th minute when Michaela Rickard got TMC on the board, her first goal of the season. \nTMC was only down 1-0 at the half, but it climbed to 3-0 with goals by San Diego’s Vivian Oray and Alejandra Gonzalez in the 51st and 69th minutes respectively. \nDespite being down two goals, TMC still felt it had a shot of keeping its home streak alive. \nThe Mustangs kept pressuring the Hawks defense with a sense of urgency. TMC did find the back of the net in the 81st minute, but the goal was taken off the scoreboard due to an offsides call. \nThat was the second goal TMC had taken away in the game and the seventh offsides call on the home team. \nThe loss pushes the Mustangs to 7-8-1 overall and 4-4 in the Golden State Athletic Conference. \nTMC, currently in sixth place, is hoping its home field advantage comes back into play on Saturday when NAIA No. 11 ranked Biola (11-2-3 overall, 5-1-2 GSAC) visits Reese Field. The Mustangs only have to notch one more win in the next two matches to qualify for playoffs, according to Lewis. \nLewis is confident that his young squad can quickly get back on the right track. \n“With a young team, it’s easier to play better teams,” Lewis said. “It’s been the teams we’re supposed to beat that we have some trouble with. (We) play up or down to our competition.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:48:48.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
