Leonard Fournette is breaking out all over the country but LSU can't seem to prove it's for real when it has the opportunity as it showed in Satuday's 44-22 victory against Eastern Michigan.\nFournette himself admitted the Tigers took the Eagles \"light' and needed Fournette longer than most -- fans, players and coaches -- had hoped. LSU did many things well but continue to get in their own way at times with mistakes not befitting one of such veteran stature.\nRead more: Leonard Fournette Heisman Watch after Eastern Michigan.\nReality is coming faster than it first seemed. In two weeks, LSU faces an unexpectedly unbeaten Florida team that thrashed Ole Miss after a visit to South Carolina.\nHere's what the report card looks like this week:\nOFFENSIVE LINE: A-\nTons of rushing yardage and the only down side was the two sacks, which could have been prevented with a little help from Brandon Harris. They also should have been credited with three sacks since the interception was actually a fumble caused by a hit. The other was a coverage sack. LSU's offensive line was driving the Eastern Michigan front backwards all night and Leonard Fournette was often untouched until he got to the second level. C Ethan Pocic owned the Eagle DTs, turning them whichever way he needed to and simply burying them. OG Will Clapp did the same to the linebackers. Eastern Michigan's only success was by stacking the box with extra defenders and even that didn't work.\nLSU has no more room for error this season | Video LSU beat writer Jim Kleinpeter and columnist Ron Higgins break down the Tigers' 44-22 victory Saturday.\nNo holding penalties and one false start on Maea Teuhema, but he more than made up for it. I'm partial to forgiving the ridiculous helmet penalty called on LT Jerald Hawkins. The defender pushed it off his head by leveraging the facemask. What is he supposed to do, stop blocking and let the guy clobber his quarterback? There needs to be some leeway on that call. I would bet the coaches are telling them they might just have to eat the penalty, or come up with better equipment that doesn't come off so easily. It looked like a popcorn popper out there.\nRUNNING BACKS: A+\nWhat do YOU think? Leonard Fournette is headed for the title of best LSU running back ever. He just passed Billy Cannon on the career rushing yardage list. He leads the nation in rushing, yards per game and touchdowns, and when LSU needs to respond to bad news, he usually comes up with something magnificent, like that 75-yard TD run. The only possible bad mark against him was the ill-advised lateral, which only hurt him with a 7-yard loss. Maybe he was returning the one Harris tossed him the previous week. Fournette is a pre-emptive strike just waiting to be given the ball. I really wanted to see him catch that screen pass.\nThe rest of the backs are pretty good. Darrel Williams is the perfect complement, although not as fast or big. But he is tough and has much better running vision. Derrius Guice has some nifty footwork that allows him to make yardage you don't expect. Nick Brossette is no nonsense and straight ahead. John David Moore had a huge block on Fournette's final TD, taking out a safety coming up hard to fill the hole. He just disappeared.\nLeonard Fournette: 'We took them light' | Video LSU running back Leonard Fournette talks to the media after the victory against eastern Michigan.\nWIDE RECEIVERS: C-\nThis group continues to drag down the overall passing game and is the missing piece to the offense finding a killer instinct. Three drops. Travin Dural dropped a ball that would have hit his navel if he'd moved his hands. Harris couldn't have thrown an easier ball to catch and Dural had an even chance to score on the play to give LSU a 24-14 lead going in. Instead, it felt like the Eagles had the momentum at the half. That was one of four drops, although the other three weren't as ugly. Malachi Dupre cost himself a touchdown when a Harris pass was slightly behind him but fully catchable. Tyron Johnson dropped one on a short slant that hit him in the hands hot.\nAgain, the wide receivers don't have the willingness to block they need. They've had opportunities but don't seem to really go after the opposing defenders. They probably know Fournette has a better than 50 percent chance of running over a defensive back. Harris wasn't as on target as he was last week but the wide receivers need to start making some plays. They haven't made many difficult catches this season and none on Saturday. Colin Jeter had one for the tight ends but DeSean Smith, whose abilities we've heard about, wasn't targeted once.\nQUARTERBACK: B\nAs previously mentioned, Harris was off target with simple passes. He had Fournette open and ready to rumble with a screen right in front of him but pitched it wide. He had poor mechanics on an alley oop throw to Dupre in the end zone. He had John Diarse open deep and underthrew the pass, which created a pass interference penalty. The next two pass was over Dural's head and the one after that wide of the mark. There's some confidence issues going on here between the quarterback and wide outs. Harris threw a nice ball to Jeter to set up a field goal, but threw only two passes in the second half.\nHarris continues to make good fakes on the read option and that netted him his third rushing TD on a 21-yard spring around left end. The interception should have been ruled a sack and a fumble because his arm never started forward. Coach Les Miles mentioned a ball security issue on that play. One of his sacks occurred because Harris waiting to long and didn't step up in the pocket when the outside rush went by him. Harris was tackled from behind. He's playing better than last year but LSU coaches should be troubled that they couldn't get much accomplished Saturday against a weak opponent that was geared to stop Leonard Fournette. On completion after the first quarter and two pass attempts in the second half sounds like the coaching staff is closer to square one than it would like to be.\nLes Miles: 'We certainly are not perfect' | Video LSU coach Les Miles talks to the media after Saturday's victory against Eastern Michigan.\nDEFENSIVE LINE: B+\nThis group continues to play well while doing the dirty work. Four of the eight tackles for loss came from the front four, including both sacks by Lewis Neal. The pressure was decent but like last week, LSU faced a quarterback who stuck to the short stuff and overall the defense held another team to fewer than 300 yards. I changed the grade from an A- because this was an offense LSU should have dominated. One touchdown was a gift from the LSU offense but and the line committed two of the three offsides penalties and that helped sustain drives. To be fair the Tigers missed Tashawn Bower, who is a solid assignment guy. Isaiah Washington saw his first action and Sione Teuhema and Deondre Clark also got into the game Eastern Michigan found little running room inside and averaged only 2.8 yards per carry.\nLINEBACKERS: B\nGenerally a consistent effort but the lack of depth continues to show. Duke Riley got some early playing time and blew a coverage for a 30-yard pass that set up the first Eastern Michigan touchdown when he bit on a fake bubble screen and let his man run by him. Another drive saw LSU give up two first downs and then put the starting DTs and LBs back in the game. Kendell Beckwith and Deion jones were fine, using their speed to make plays all over the field and provide one of the Tigers' five touchdowns. Those two combined for 2.5 tackles for loss. The lack of enthusiasm showed.\nDEFENSIVE BACKS: A-\nLSU LB Deion Jones: 'He threw it sidearm, right at me' | Video LSU LB Deion Jones talks to the media about his pick 6 vs. Eastern Michigan.\nThe usual good, tight coverage was consistent and interceptions by Jamal Adams and Kevin Toliver were highlights. Toliver continues to impress with his coverage and tackling ability. Tre'Davious White is unsung because his man was seldom targeted. Dwayne Thomas had a key breakup on third down and had a good night as the nickel corner. Rickey Jefferson was active, sharing the team-high in tackles with eight. Except for one play, the tackling was solid but the opposition wasn't championship caliber, either. There's nothing much to complain about, no penalties and good play byu the reserves. It might be hard for Jalen Mills to find a spot when he comes back.\nSPECIAL TEAMS: C+\nJamie Keehn punted only twice and averaged just short of 45 yards, which is more like him. It's too small a sampling to know if he's come out the other side of his issues from the first three games. No returns to test the punt coverage either. The kickoffs were a mess with another long return (37), a kickoff out of bounds and a delay of game on sophomore Cameron Gamble, the second of his career. Even with the wind at their backs at times, only one touchback in nine tries. Trent Domingue is now 6-for-6 on field goals but apparently at the cost of his kicking off job. After he shanked one out of bounds, Miles tried Gamble, who responded with the delay of game. Keep an eye on this developing situation.\nOVERALL: B\nLSU won and was never really seriously threatened. But remember the visitors got it to a one-score game and then tried an onsides kick that went out of bounds. LSU's ability to play down to opponents is one of the hallmarks of the Les Miles era. Still, he's won a lot of games and he simply doesn't care for style points. He even mentioned Saturday night that he knew his team wasn't \"dominant\" and he talks about it as if it's important to win that way. I soured a bit on this LSU team that should have been dominant coming home to play in such beautiful fall weather after a penalty-filled effort at Syracuse. LSU has a serious issue with the passing game, which seemed to be coming along incrementally but was shut down after the drops and off-target throws. Leonard Fournette continues to roll and the offensive line is playing better each week. But LSU will need the passing game to come around to be in the playoff hunt in later November.\nScroll down for grades from previous games:\nSyracuse\nAuburn\nMississippi State", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:41:06.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
