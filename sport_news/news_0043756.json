Christian Robinson \nThe 6-foot-5, 240-pound Robinson is a defensive lineman from Friendswood, Texas, but is playing his true freshman season at Blinn Community College in Texas this fall. \nRobinson confirmed that he committed on Sunday night. \n\"I really liked Birmingham whenever I came and visited,\" Robinson said. \"Just the opportunity that was presented to me, four and a half years of school was something I couldn't pass up on.\" \nRobinson officially visited UAB in September. He has helped Blinn to a 5-2 start and had two tackles for loss in its most recent game, a 36-28 loss to Trinity. \n\"The way the coaches presented everything, I could tell that they're all about winning,\" Robinson said. \"Everywhere those coaches have been, they've been successful. That was important to me.\" \nRobinson said that his defensive coordinator at Blinn gave UAB coaches his name. He had some Division II offers out of high school, but went to Blinn in order to gain a Division I offer. He is fully qualified and will enroll at UAB in January. \nRobinson joins Georgia Military College offensive lineman Charles Brenner and Iowa Western defensive back Shaquille Jones as midyear recruits who are committed to UAB. \nUAB will have a spring practice in 2016 and resume game competition in 2017.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:40:42.220+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
