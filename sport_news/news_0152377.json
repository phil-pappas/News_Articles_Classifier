Arrieta won his last 11 regular-season decisions before becoming the first Cub to toss a complete game in the postseason since Mark Prior in the 2003 division series. Kyle Schwarber smacked a two-run homer and had three RBIs, and Dexter Fowler added a solo shot and three runs scored to help the Cubs earn the right to face the Cardinals in the division series. \nNEW YORK (AP) — NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell expects league owners to vote on franchise relocation to Los Angeles in a few months. The current timetable calls for submission of applications to relocate in January, when the owners could vote. Steelers president Art Rooney said he doesn’t envision that timetable being changed, noting that St. Louis, Oakland and San Diego “still are putting together their proposals” to keep their teams. \nNEW YORK (AP) — NFL owners have approved more international regular-season games through 2025, including ones in places other than in England.

The league also is looking at moving the Pro Bowl to international sites. \nCOLUMBIA, S.C.

(AP) — San Jose Sharks forward Raffi (RAF’-ee) Torres has decided not to appeal his 41-game suspension for an illegal check to the head of Anaheim’s Jakob Silfverberg (SIHL’-vur-burg) in a preseason game. This marks the fifth and most significant suspension for Torres, who served a 21-game ban for a high hit on Chicago’s Marian Hossa (HOH’-sah) in the 2012 playoffs.
