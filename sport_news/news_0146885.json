They led Coronado 21-7 in the third quarter before losing, 42-21. Then Kingman (1-5, 0-3 Section III) trailed Parker 14-6 in the third and went on to lose 33-6. Last week, the Bulldogs were tied with Lee Williams at the half, 14-14, but the second half doomed them again in the 42-20 loss.\"We're not making adjustments at halftime to continue and expand on what we're doing,\" said KHS football coach Greg Tonjes. \"The other coaching staffs are making adjustments to take advantage of our weaknesses. We're too vanilla. We need to adjust and do things differently.\"If the Bulldogs are going to shock the world against Havasu (6-0, 3-0) in tonight's Section III contest, they will have to have an answer for Jacob Kalogonis. The 5-feet-8-inch, 170-pound senior running back averages 110.5 yard per game on 10.7 yards per carry. Kalogonis has 13 touchdowns on the season.\"We need to stop No. 23,\" Tonjes said. \"He's about 85 percent of their offense.\"Penalties have also plagued Kingman this season, including getting flagged 13 times for 120 yards last week.\"They are an issue,\" Tonjes said. \"We had several unsportsmanlikes and late hits that we addressed this week. We have to become more disciplined.\"Kingman suffered a disappointing loss last week in the first meeting in school history with Lee Williams. Tonjes said the Bulldogs have bounced back.\"I'm really proud of them with the energy they have,\" the coach said. \"We're going to go into it excited. We had our best practice of the year on Wednesday.\"If the Bulldogs can find a way to keep things close in the first half, Tonjes expects to see a correction to the second half difficulties that have been experienced.\"The coaches need to make sure we're ready for the second half,\" he said. \"We will be this week.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:16:46.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
