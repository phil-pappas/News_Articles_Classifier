Maybe it’s when he’s walking into the dressing room and seeing the massive Blackhawks logo on the floor. Or pulling the red sweater over his head. Or standing in the crease, listening to the national anthem, surrounded by nearly 22,000 screaming fans.\nDarling didn’t just make it to the NHL, a staggering accomplishment on its own. He’s playing in the arena he paid to get into as a kid. He’s wearing the jersey he wore as a kid. He’s representing the team he worshipped as a kid. His name is on the Stanley Cup, forever linked to the Chicago Blackhawks — the first local player to win a championship for his hometown team.\nDarling’s no longer in awe of his remarkable situation. But the Lemont native still gets a thrill from it every now and then, when he gives himself a chance to soak it all in.\n“It’s a pretty tremendous honor to be that guy,” said Darling, who got a large, Chicago-themed Cup tattoo on his right arm within days of the Hawks’ victory. “To be a Chicago Blackhawk, it’s something you never think can actually happen, even though you dreamed of it when you were a kid. It just means a lot to us, being from here and being such big Blackhawks fans our whole lives, to wear this sweater.”\nThat’s right, he said “us.” Darling isn’t the only local kid around. Bartlett’s Vinnie Hinostroza made his NHL debut on Saturday for the Hawks. West Dundee’s Ryan Hartman was a first-round pick in 2013 and made his Hawks debut last season. And in recent seasons, the Hawks have drafted Geneva’s Roy Radke, Winfield’s Anthony Louis, and New Lenox’s Alex Broadhurst. They even picked two players from the USHL’s Chicago Steel in the past two seasons, Dennis Gilbert and Fredrik Olofsson.\nGeneral manager Stan Bowman has made it clear he likes drafting local kids, for whom the Hawks hold a special allure and extra motivation.\n“They’re good players,” Darling said. “And if there’s two kids of equal talent and one of them’s from Illinois and one’s not, let’s get the hometown kid here. It definitely doesn’t hurt his cause.”\nThe surge in the hockey talent pool in Chicago can be directly traced to the resurgence in the hockey fan base. Hinostroza started skating when he was 3 years old. He started playing hockey when he was 4. And in the first 11 years of his hockey life, the Hawks went to the playoffs one time, winning just one playoff game. When he told his friends that he played hockey, he might as well have been telling them that he played cricket. Or jai alai. Or quidditch.\n“In elementary school and middle school, no one really watched the Hawks or anything,” Hinostroza said. “None of the kids at school really followed it. But when I went to high school the Hawks really started getting a lot better, and everyone was wearing Hawks shirseys with Toews and Kane and everyone on the back. Everyone since then has just fallen in love with the Hawks.”\nNot just with the Hawks, but with hockey in general. Now, not only do countless Chicago-area kids grow up rooting for Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane , they want to be Jonathan Toews and Patrick Kane. The boom in youth hockey and the proliferation of rinks and teams in the area has been well-documented since the Hawks’ renaissance. And players such as Darling, Hinostroza and Hartman should serve as an even bigger inspiration for the next wave of talent.\n“It’s motivational,” Hartman said of seeing Darling win a championship. “I’m really happy for him. I was in the locker room after the Cup win, and just seeing his face — all the guy’s faces, really — and what they went through the whole playoffs, it really makes you want to get one and be part of the team like that. To do it anywhere would be amazing. But to do in Chicago would be special.”\nDarling, like Hinostroza, was pretty much the only kid at school who played hockey as a kid. Now, he’s the standard-bearer and role model for the thousands of hockey-playing kids in the Chicago area. And for him, the local boy turned hero, that’s every bit as gratifying — and as cool — as being a Hawk.\n“The kids I went to school with, nobody played hockey, nobody really knew what was going on,” he said. “That carried all the way to high school. And then, overnight, people who weren’t hockey fans suddenly were huge Blackhawks fans, and it was like a chain reaction. People were getting into hockey, more teams are opening up, more rinks, and it’s been a lot of fun to see. And it’s only going to get better.”\nEmail: mlazerus@suntimes.com\nTwitter: @marklazerus", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T21:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:03:26.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
