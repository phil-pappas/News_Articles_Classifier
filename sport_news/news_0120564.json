(AP) - A federal grand jury has brought a seven-count fraud indictment against a Baton Rouge financial adviser who was on two gold-medal relay teams in the 2004 Paralympics in Athens.\nThe indictment handed up Friday alleges that Raphew Reed Jr. lied on a credit union loan application in 2012, defrauded another company of $125,000 in 2012 and 2013, and lied to federal investigators.\nHis attorney, John Christopher Alexander of Baton Rouge, said Monday that Reed is innocent and will fight the charges.\nHe confirms that Reed medaled in Athens.\nThe indictment says Reed \"held himself out as a financial advisor\" through a company called Reed and Associates LLC.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
