It's also looking increasingly likely if Ottawa wins the semi-final, the final could also be held here. As it stands now, Fury has a five-point lead over the New York Cosmos for the overall league title, which would earn Fury home-field advantage throughout the post-season. \nBut as always, it continues to be one game at a time for Fury, who want to close out the regular season with a win on Halloween night in Atlanta. They also want to see big crowds show up for the first-ever professional playoff soccer game to be played in Ottawa. \n\"It's difficult (not to look too far ahead), but as you know we've had this philosophy all along, which you are totally bored with, which is one game at a time,\" Fury president John Pugh told the Sun Friday. \nPugh, the man responsible for bringing pro soccer to the capital, was with the team to celebrate the win in Jacksonville. \n\"That's one of those magic moments, they don't come very often and when they happen, you have to celebrate and savour that moment,\" he said. \nDefender Colin Falvey, who hasn't missed a minute of action for Fury this season, echoed Pugh's comments. \n\"These are good moments to be a part of but the good thing is we're humble enough to enjoy it for a couple days (and then get) back to work to work straight away Monday. We want to win the combined (standings) now.\" \nAs for what Pugh expects crowd-wise at the first-ever playoff game to be played at the new Lansdowne, he's hoping the club's growing supporter base continues to swell. \n\"Let's pack as many people in there as we can, let's make a huge effort to get everybody there,\" said Pugh. \nThe club will be presented with the fall championship trophy on Sunday before the 67's home game against the Peterborough Petes at 3 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:45:51.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
