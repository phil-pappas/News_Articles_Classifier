Jewell Dobson led Lipscomb with 16 kills, while Chloe Rogers and Brittnay Estes made 12 and 10 kills, respectively. Kayla Ostrom put up 46 assists, while Lauren Anderson led the Bisons with 10 digs. Lipscomb hit .364 with 55 kills and 46 digs. UNF had a strong lead in the marathon, close first set, but saw Lipscomb make a late surge. UNF had a 23-18 lead after Ambre Desaulnay 's kill, but a kill from Rogers sparked a five-point Lipscomb run that tied the set at 23-23. Both teams had their chance at set point on multiple occasions. With UNF up 31-30, Lipscomb rattled off three-straight kills to claim the first set. Multiple runs saw the Ospreys needing to battle back from an eight-point, 20-12 deficit. UNF attempted to fight back and came to within six when a Hoff kill made it 22-16. However, Lipscomb got three of the next four points to win the set and go up 2-0 in the match. Although the start to the third set was close, UNF saw Lipscomb go on a costly five-point run to gain a 15-10 lead. After trading points, UNF's deficit grew as Lipscomb went on a four-point spurt to take a 24-15 lead. Back-to-back Hoff kills kept the Ospreys in the match, but the Bisons had a match-ending block from Dobson and Ostrom for the final point. UNF returns to action on Saturday against NJIT at 1 p.m., at UNF Arena.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:04:06.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
