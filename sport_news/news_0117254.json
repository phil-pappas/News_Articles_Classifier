He and his companion were eventually let into the store, he said.\nWhitefish Bay Police Chief Michael Young said in a statement the situation stemmed from recent suspicious activity at the store. On Friday, police investigated a dark brown Tahoe with dealer plates sitting in front of the store, which received several suspicious calls, Young said.\nYoung said the jewelers requested extra police attention for the Whitefish Bay store on Monday after a burglary over the weekend at a store in Green Bay.\nSchwanke-Kasten President Tom Dixon said he hoped to sit with Henson and personally apologize for what he experienced.\n\"We all agree that racial profiling is never acceptable and deeply regret how the circumstances unfolded Friday and today,\" Dixon said in a statement.\nHenson, a Bucks first round draft pick in 2012, recently signed a four-year $45 million contract extension.\n(Reporting by Brendan O'Brien; Editing by Paul Simao)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:03:41.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
