As she took a seat and moved her chair closer to the table, her ring finger got caught between the loose seat and the chair frame. The tip of her finger was severed, and she was unable to have it reattached at a hospital.\nThe arbitrator wrote in court filings that the Shamrock was negligent in making the faulty seat available to customers.", "external_links": ["http://goo.gl/0Rv9Xm"], "published": "2015-10-09T13:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:06:36.750+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
