Mark Wallheiser Associated Press \nTALLAHASSEE | Trey Marshall of Lake City has had a couple of tough weeks for Florida State since his career game on Oct. 3 at Wake Forest. \nThe sophomore nickelback had another setback on Saturday during FSU’s 41-21 victory over Louisville. \nMarshall injured his left arm during the first quarter and was unable to return. The injury occurred on the first play of a Cardinals possession. Later in the drive, quarterback Lamar Jackson went over the middle two plays in a row to James Quick , for 48 yards to the FSU 18 and then for a touchdown. \nFSU coach Jimbo Fisher did not have any additional information about the injury after the game. \nMarshall was ejected from last week’s game against Miami because of a targeting penalty. He has been available for only 29 defensive snaps since the Wake Forest game. \nThe Columbia High graduate had 11 tackles, seven unassisted, in the ’Noles 24-16 victory over the Deacons two weeks ago. He was named the co-defensive player of the week in the ACC. \n\nHunt among honorees \nFSU honored the first four African-American football players in program history during the first quarter. \nAmong them was Charlie Hunt of Jacksonville, a veteran assistant coach at Episcopal. The others were J.T. Thomas , a member of four Super Bowl champions at Pittsburgh, Eddie McMillan and Bobby Anderson , who is from Tifton, Ga. \nAfter they played freshman football in 1969, Thomas became the first African-American to appear in a game for the Seminoles. He started in the 1970 opening game, against Louisville. \nHunt played with San Francisco and Tampa Bay after his college career was over. His son, Charles Hunt Jr. , who graduated from Episcopal, played for FSU as a walk-on. \nAll four players got their degrees from FSU. \n\nWalk-on provides spark \nWith starters Marshall and Nate Andrews out, the Seminoles got very thin in the secondary against the Cardinals. When a big play was needed, former walk-on Javien Elliott of Panama City came through. \nElliott, who was awarded a scholarship by Fisher before the season began after toiling for years on scout teams, intercepted a deep pass thrown by Louisville quarterback Lamar Jackson with 3:32 left in the third quarter and the Seminoles leading 27-14. \nThe Cardinals had good field position, with Corvin Lamb returning a kickoff 33 yards to the Louisville 40. Jackson went deep on first down but overthrew his target, with Elliott waiting. \nElliott, who has been playing in special teams, could hardly believe what had happened. \n“I remember watching the games on TV, pretending I was one of the players,” he said. “Not that I’m actually on TV and playing. It’s huge. It’s crazy how things happen so fast.” \nFisher said any walk-on sticking with the FSU program long enough to get a scholarship deserves credit. \n“He’s put his heart and soul in it,” Fisher said. “Guys were hurt, and he played his tail off in practice and got ready. With as many people as there are playing football, trying to get on the field at an elite level, with the way we recruit. ... I don’t know if we really appreciate, even me, how hard it is for that young man to do that.” \nWelcome home \nNFL schedules enabled five FSU stars from the past to come to Tallahassee, where they watched the game from the sidelines. \nThe group was led by 2013 Heisman Trophy winner Jameis Winston from the Tampa Bay Bucs. Also attending were Devonta Freeman (Atlanta), Mario Edwards Jr. and Rodney Hudson (both with Oakland) and Terrence Brooks (Baltimore). \nIt was pointed out to Fisher that Winston appeared to be coaching up the offensive players on the sideline. \n“He ain’t changed a bit,” Fisher said. \nAll but Hudson were members of the 2013 national championship team. Hudson was the first FSU All-American Fisher coached.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:12:53.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
