They were backed well by Akram Shalabi, who didn't allow the Barka central three to take matters into their own hands. \nAlthough Storm had the majority of the possession, Barka always looked threatening, particularly with their pace down the flanks. \nSean Hennessey and Nick French had to work tirelessly to keep Storm in shape. \nThe first opportunity fell to Malchus Hilton when a pass from Lennon split the defence, and when Hilton latched on to the ball, he cut past two defenders, only to unleash a shot that whistled past the post. \nBarka was also creating opportunities, but Joe Bunn and Dave McCurragh were restricting the hosts to mainly long-range efforts. Barka had a run of corners as it was trying hard to break the deadlock, but Storm's new goalkeeper Luke Plowman was commanding in goal. \nIn the 35th minute, it took a moment of brilliance from Kirk McPherson to open the scoring, when a sublime piece of skill caught out the Barka defence and Lennon read the situation calmly to slip the ball under the onrushing keeper. \nWith minutes to go for the break, the unrelenting pressure from Storm led to Hilton finding himself unmarked in the six-yard box, but his shot flew wide. \nThe second half was as exciting as the first half, with both teams playing attacking football. Barka, trailing 0-1, introduced some fresh legs and this gave the team an edge as Storm started to sit deeper trying to absorb the pressure and attack on the counter. \nThe tempo remained high and Barka was using the width of the pitch to stretch the visitors. Barka was rewarded in the 62nd minute when it was awarded a free-kick on the edge of the box. The resulting kick saw Ali al Balushi curl the ball into the bottom corner to make it 1-1. \nStorm's response was almost immediate when Rami Cortez, who created problems throughout the game, ran down the right flank. He sent a drilled cross right into the box, where Shalabi smashed the ball home from a couple of yards and Storm went 2-1 ahead. \nThe home team continued to push forward, but with Richard Furneaux controlling the backline well, clear chances were few and far between for Barka. \nWith minutes to go, it looked like Storm had wrapped up the game, when a cross found Balushi with some much-needed space. He sent in a chip that eluded Plowman and equalised for the second time in the match. \nStorm manager Lee Ebbutt said, \"Tonight's performance was our best of the season so far. We introduced a number of new faces and they all blended in well against a good team like Barka. \nâ€œWe have some tough games coming up. If we continue to play with this passion, I hope that we can continue this amazing run.\" Similar content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:05:24.838+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
