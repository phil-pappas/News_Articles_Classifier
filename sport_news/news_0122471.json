(Photo: Mike Carter-USA TODAY Sports) \nEAST LANSING -- \"We're here to talk about Michigan,\" Mark Dantonio said today when asked about the South Carolina job, vacated with Steve Spurrier retiring. \nDantonio also mentioned that South Carolina is his alma mater, and he did nothing to end speculation that has already started in terms of preliminary wish lists for the job. So that can keep percolating as the No. 7 Spartans (6-0, 2-0 Big Ten) prepare for the biggest game of the season to date, Saturday at No. 12 Michigan (5-1, 2-0). \nAs usual, Dantonio gave no injury updates, but when asked if Jack Allen might not play after suffering an ankle injury against Rutgers, he said: \"There's always a chance.\" \n\"Always a chance he will play,\" Dantonio added, his only mention of any of MSU's injured players. MSU quarterback Connor Cook said after Saturday's 31-24 win at Rutgers that MSU expects left tackle Jack Conklin (knee) and tight end Josiah Price (ankle) to play. Harbaugh's first game vs. MSU ended with a broken arm \nDantonio praised Michigan and its swarming defense and \"old school\" running attack under first-year coach Jim Harbaugh, and he said of the Spartans at the midway point: \"What you know about Michigan State is we'll hang in there and we'll hang tough and we'll play through some pain. ... Are we perfect? No. Do we have some playmakers? Yes.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1LssxXI TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:38:42.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
