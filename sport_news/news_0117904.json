A bus full of Comets put a crater in the middle of Silke Field and spoiled everything. Crater made the 161-mile trip to Springfield and upended No. 1-ranked Springfield, 49-35, to knock the Millers from the ranks of the unbeatens and grab a firm hold on the top spot in the Midwestern League. Crater running back Cavin Gillispie rushed for 255 yards and two touchdowns and Comets quarterback Matt Struck threw for 303 yards and four touchdowns to put a hold on Springfield’s chances of winning a second straight MWL title. “Hats off to them,” Springfield coach Dave Heuberger said. “I’ve said it all along, if we get beat, it’ll be by a good football team. Our goals are still on the table. We’re going to show up Monday and get ready to go play over at Marist.” The fourth-ranked Comets (8-0, 4-0 MWL) turned a 21-21 halftime-draw into a third-quarter romp, scoring 21 straight points to pull away from the Millers (7-1, 3-1). Struck, who threw three interceptions in the game and also lost one fumble on a bad snap, threw two touchdowns in the quarter. “We just came out with a lot of energy and just played,” Struck said. “We tried to get the wind out of them.” It started with a 59-yard interception return for a touchdown by the Comets with 7:52 in the third. Springfield quarterback Trever Watson, who sat out most of the fourth quarter with a bag of ice on his side, aired a pass too high, and Shaine Lukkes grabbed it and sprinted the other way. That started the ball rolling on a dominating run by Crater, which also scored on touchdown passes of 1 and 35 yards to Garret Dey and Gillispie, respectively. Meanwhile, Crater’s defense stymied a Millers running game that piled up 242 yards in the first half. In the final two quarters Watson, Nicolas Ah Sam and Daniel Wilson were pushed back for a combined minus-13 yards. Crater coach John Beck said the defensive line changed its look, going to four standing linemen that tripped up Springfield. “Went to what we call a chaos system,” he said. “Guys are running around, and we aren’t giving them looks.” Watson had 155 yards rushing at halftime but finished with 149 and two touchdowns. “Those are some big, physical kids that are up moving around, creating that confusion,” Heuberger said. “It’s something we didn’t handle that well.” Struck spread the ball around to six receivers. Dey caught eight passes for 102 yards to lead the Comets. Jake Ireland (72 yards receiving) also caught two touchdowns for Crater. Springfield fell in a hole in the second quarter, giving up a 100-yard interception return for a touchdown by Austin Kramer. Then, after stopping Springfield on fourth down for the second time in the first half, Struck handed the ball off to Gillispie, who gashed the Millers for 40, 13, 16 and 16 yards for another touchdown. “I think we were pretty physical,” Beck said. “That was the tale of the tape was how physical we were.” Watson brought the Millers back, throwing a 33-yard touchdown pass to Ah Sam as well as scoring himself on runs of 61 and 16 yards. By the time the Millers scored again in the fourth quarter, it was 42-27 and Watson was on the sidelines. In Watson’s absence, Ah Sam threw two touchdown passes to Braydon Haas. “We told them to keep fighting and I felt they did that,” Heuberger said. “A bit too little too late, though.” By Ben Schorzman", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:16:40.346+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
