(David Banks/Getty Images) \n— MLB GIFS (@MLBGIFs) October 14, 2015 \nThat’s according to the Chicago Tribune, which reports that the ball has been located and verified. \nThe paper confirmed that the homer from Chicago’s win over the St. Louis Cardinals landed atop a Wrigley Field video board, which is nice because that means the ball got to stay at the ballpark for the party , too. \nYou can see the ball right there, in the picture below. SCHWARBER Home Run is stuck up there pic.twitter.com/ZjOi99ztOj \nReports the Tribune : \nA Cubs’ employee was sent to retrieve the ball on Wednesday morning and a source said the team verified it was the actual Schwarber ball through an MLB postseason watermark on it. \nThe Cubs then returned it to its original location on top of the board and will leave it there until their postseason run has concluded. \nThe source said the Cubs will decide what to do with the ball after the season, but wanted to leave it there for now as a momento of the Game 4 win. The Cubs will put a plexiglass case around it for now to preserve it from the elements. \nHere’s video of the home run. As you can see, it does go very, very, very, very far. \nDang, Kyle.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T21:41:23.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
