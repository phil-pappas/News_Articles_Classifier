Just looking around the clubhouse and seeing these guys celebrate, it’s incredible.\n“It’s a pretty special feeling. I’ve been blessed.’’\nThe Wrigley organist welcomed Duda to the plate with Camptown Races … Du-da. Du-da.\nTravis d’Arnaud followed with another blast, giving the Mets only their second back-to-back postseason home runs in their history.\nOf course, Daniel Murphy had to homer again (his seventh of the postseason) and did so in the eighth, a two-run shot.\nDuda’s five RBIs tie the postseason franchise-record for a single game. It’s the fifth time it’s happened and second time this postseason. Curtis Granderson had five RBIs in Game 3 of the NLDS vs. Los Angeles.\nIt paid to have patience for the big man and hitting coaches Kevin Long and Pat Roessler deserve tremendous credit for bringing Duda along and getting him to hit for power when they needed it most.\n“I knew Duda was close and he delivered tonight,’’ Long said. “The unique part of this team is that anybody can do it on any given day and today was Lucas Duda.’’\nLong then smiled and said, “He just helped out Murph.\n“For Lucas, that’s a big monkey off his back. The Dude wanted to contribute. The Dude wanted to be part of the fun, and he certainly was today. Five RBIs, I’m just so happy for him.’’\nDuda came into the games at Wrigley in a 2-for-21 with those two hits being singles.\nThe wind was blowing out Wednesday to center field so Duda’s timing was perfect with his exaggerated leg kick.\nThe previously struggling first baseman said he was so relieved to come through and help his teammates and on this night he showed emotion on the field.\n“It’s so nice to contribute,’’ he said as party master Juan Lagares poured beer on his head.\n“I was pretty terrible for most of the postseason. To be in this position it’s an unbelievable experience,’’ Duda said.\n“Working with Kevin Long and Pat Roessler they keep you positive. And Murphy is on a different planet.’’\nBefore spring training, Duda talked about getting to the postseason and having success.\n“I think early we believed,’’ he said. “The young talent mixed with the older talent was huge.\n“Having some faith in ourselves since Day 1 was huge. It’s been a long time since I contributed, but I think this all heads back to Daniel Murphy having the postseason he is having. Unbelievable. It’s incredible.’’\nCollins has pushed all the right buttons and never lost faith in Duda, who hit .244 during the regular season with 27 home runs.\nDuda was even more valuable to the Mets Wednesday night because Yoenis Cespedes had to leave the game with a sore left shoulder after striking out in the second inning.\n“Honestly, these games weren’t that close,’’ Long said. “We did what we wanted to do offensively. I always said we have the ace in the hole and that’s our pitching staff.’’\nFor Duda, it’s all about finding a hitting rhythm and getting that foot down without having the head move too much. Collins said the key is staying “quiet’’ in the swing.\nHis .124 batting average was quiet coming into the game.\nWhen all goes right for Duda the swing is quiet and the bat makes a lot of noise.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under kevin long ,  lucas duda ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  nlcs ,  terry collins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:20:56.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
