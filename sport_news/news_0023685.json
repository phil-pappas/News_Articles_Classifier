(Photo: Jordan Allred / The Spectrum & Daily News) CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSouthern Utah head coach Ed Lamb knew his new offensive coordinator had to be nervous. Justin Walterscheid was entering his first game as a coordinator, and the weight of wins and losses weigh a little heavier as the promotions come. \nBut Lamb wanted to make sure that Walterscheid knew that no matter what the result was on Saturday night, that he was doing good work. \n“I think he did a tremendous job all week,” Lamb said. “I told him before the game, the final score wouldn’t change my opinion. He worked really hard at it, I knew he had a great plan, I knew the players were well prepared and confident and whatever the result was going to be you’d have to credit Sacramento State if the result didn't turn out as well as we thought.” \nThe credit, though, would be given to Walterscheid on Saturday. SUU’s offense put up 570 yards and 44 points, and unlike two weeks ago against Weber State, when the T-Bird defense did a lot of the scoring, most of the point production was because of the offense. \nSUU defense makes history \nBy holding Sacramento State off the scoreboard, SUU secured back-to-back shutouts for the first time in school history. And the defensive dominance goes beyond that. The T-Birds have yet to give up a touchdown in Big Sky games, and haven’t given up an offensive touchdown in four of their six games. In conference games SUU has allowed just three points. \n“The two shutouts, that just goes to our preparation,” safety Miles Killebrew said. “The coaches do a very good job at preparing us each week for our assignments. We don't do anything out of the ordinary, we just have each others backs on defense and we just do our assignment, and the results show.” \nKillebrew did make one of the biggest plays on Saturday to keep the Hornets off the scoreboard. In the third quarter, Killebrew rose up and blocked a Sacramento State field goal attempt. \n“Got to tell you, I hurt my hand a little bit,” Killebrew said. \nLamb then jumped in and explained why. \n“I was trying to be humble about it,” Killebrew laughed. \"...'It was a team effort'.\" \nPenalty problem? \nWhile the offense was more efficient than it’s been all season, and the defense pitched another shutout, the T-Birds weren’t perfect on Saturday. \nSUU committed eight penalties for 80 yards, and while it didn’t have any effect on the result against Sacramento State, it might moving forward. \n“It’s on video, it’s there for our guys (to see),” Lamb said. “We are not a cheap team, I’m quite certain there wasn’t anything out there I’m going to be upset about as far as character, but the discipline to be able to understand the situations in game and not leave it up to the officials. We will put the video on, we will discuss that in a tight game it could be the difference, and I know I have the type of guys on this team that will respond to that and respect that message.” \nFollow Ryan Miller on Twitter, @millerjryan.
