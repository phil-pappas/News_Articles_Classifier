And after a 20-pitch first inning, Arrieta was efficient enough to be allowed to finish the game.\nArrieta can make his brilliant season even better with a dominant victory over the Pirates in the National League wild-card game Wednesday night.\nIn zooming past Jon Lester as the Cubs' ace with a 22-6 record that included a 16-1 record and 0.86 ERA in his last 20 starts — beginning with the shutout at Minnesota — Arrieta's success can be attributed to four strengths.\nControl\nBefore his dominating 20-game stretch, Arrieta's six walks against the Indians tied his career high, set in a loss to the Yankees on July 31, 2011, in his last start before undergoing surgery to remove bone spurs from his right elbow.\nAfter the loss to the Indians, Arrieta's control gradually improved to the point where he didn't issue a walk in his final 14 innings.\nCubs first baseman Anthony Rizzo and an NL scout suggested the best chance to solve Arrieta is for hitters to focus on one side of the plate.\nBut, \"he knows when to throw a strike, and when to throw a ball,\" a longtime AL scout said.\nArrieta said he can vary the speed of his slider from 87 to 92 mph.\n\"At the end of the day, all we're trying to do is get the hitter off balance,\" Arrieta said. \"Get him in a position where he's not strong in the strike zone.\"\nThe ability to control the strike zone has emerged as one of Arrieta's greatest assets.\nJake Arrieta on exchanging tweets with Pirates fans Cubs' Jake Arrieta on exchanging tweets with Pittsburgh fans and comfort of facing Pirates.\nCubs' Jake Arrieta on exchanging tweets with Pittsburgh fans and comfort of facing Pirates.\nSee more videos \"Early in my career, I wasn't good in the strike zone early,\" Arrieta said. \"I was good in the strike zone late, which is not a good thing.\n\"Hitters took advantage of that. That's the transition I've made, being able to be aggressive in the zone for strike one and expand off of that.\"\nOpponents are batting .114 when Arrieta is ahead in the count this season.\nMechanics\nOne of the knocks on Arrieta dating to his college days at TCU was that he was susceptible to injury because he threw across his body instead of squaring his delivery to the plate.\n\"I can get over my front side, and why is throwing in a direct line to the plate the better way to do it?\" Arrieta said last week. \"Who says that's the better way to do it? At an early age if you develop a delivery or a throwing motion that is direct to the plate, then that's fine. If you have one that's slightly open, that's fine too.\n\"Can you do the appropriate things with your body to allow that to be useful to you? And that's what I'm able to do with my delivery.\"\nAnother veteran AL scout agreed with Arrieta's assessment, although he admitted he didn't believe Arrieta was worth a first-round pick in the 2007 draft. (The Orioles took Arrieta in the fifth round.)\n\"I never had a concern with him throwing across his body,\" the scout said. \"If there's a problem, it's correctable. Guys do what they have to do to get the job done. If you feel good about it, you'll do better.\n\"You can pick 10 to 15 pitchers with perfect arm action and they'll have Tommy John surgery.\"\nArrieta's slider is particularly effective against right-handed hitters because his across-the-body delivery makes the pitch appear even sharper.\nCurveball\n\"His curve is the best in baseball,\" the AL scout said. \"How many hitters can square that curve?\"\nArrieta's big-breaking curve is reminiscent of the first-pitch strikes that the late Bob Welch used to keep opponents off balance during his 27-win season with the Athletics in 1990.\nIn Friday's victory in Milwaukee, Arrieta wouldn't give into Adam Lind or Khris Davis, who were sitting on Arrieta's 97-mph fastball with a runner at second.\nLind swung and missed badly on an 83-mph curve, and Davis hit a feeble grounder to second base for the final out of the first inning.\nIn recent games, Arrieta has thrown more changeups, including a pitch that the Pirates' Gregory Polanco poked into left field for a single that ended Arrieta's bid for a perfect game in a 4-0 win Sept. 27.\nBut his curve — usually clocked in the low 80s — has served as the most effective off-speed pitch to complement his 97-mph fastball and 91-mph slider/cut fastball.\nArrieta downplayed his reliance on the curve and hinted that his changeup has emerged as a bigger weapon. But his curve frequently fools batters trying to square up his mid-90 mph pitches and forces them to adjust their eye level.\n\"I've developed a feel for that now to where I can save (the changeup) till the fifth, sixth or seventh inning if I need it,\" Arrieta said, \"Not for swings and misses or called strikes — but for weak contact early in the count to get quick outs to remain in the game longer. It's really game to game.\"\nStamina\nArrieta's commitment to conditioning and health (he took sips of kale juice during an interview for this story last week) is well known. But he has learned to adjust to situations during a game and a season.\n\"You play your surroundings,\" Arrieta said. \"You pitch accordingly. Not that I drastically try to change my game plan based on the score or the team or stadium, but you have to take everything into consideration. Because if there's something that can benefit your performance, just based on being aware of certain details, it's part of my responsibility to understand those types of things.\n\"With a runner at second base with nobody out, you're trying to punch somebody out. You understand when there are guys in scoring position, hitters like to be aggressive early. So you pitch accordingly. Every situation is a little different, but you use the information you're given to execute to the best of your ability.\"\nArrieta set career highs with 33 starts and 229 innings this season, but he has pitched economically since throwing a career-high 123 pitches in a shutout over the Brewers two weeks ago.\nThe scariest thought for the Pirates is that Arrieta still might have more power in his right arm.\n\"I don't try to put much more than 90 percent into (my fastball),\" Arrieta said. \"That's why I maintain my velocity throughout the outing. Late in the game, if there's a situation I feel is necessary to maybe add a little bit without taking away from command or location, I might do so.\n\"But I feel the effort level I use is just where I need to be from start to finish.\"\nmgonzales@tribpub.com\nTwitter @MDGonzales\n Major League Baseball Baseball Jake Arrieta Chicago Cubs Pittsburgh Pirates Cleveland Indians Adam Lind", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56142a11/turbine/ct-jake-arrieta-on-exchanging-tweets-with-pirates-fans-20151006", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56136781/turbine/ct-1007-graphic-arrieta-007", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56136780/turbine/ct-1007-graphic-arrieta", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56136781/turbine/ct-1007-graphic-arrieta-008", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56140c39/turbine/ct-arrieta-cubs-pirates-spt-1007-20151006"], "published": "2015-10-07T00:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T15:49:58.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
