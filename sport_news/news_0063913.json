October 25th 2015 4 hours ago /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Football/A-League/ \nTWO out of three ain’t bad for Perth Glory who overcame a tough schedule to register their first A-League win of the season, 3-1 over Adelaide at nib Stadium. \nGlory had lost their first two A-League matches to Central Coast and Wellington before beating Melbourne City in Wednesday’s FFA Cup semi-final. \nWith a third game in eight days they had every reason to look fatigued but dominated on Sunday to log the victory. \nThe Glory scored through Sidnei Sciola in the first half and Guyon Fernandez in the second. \nThe win was sealed with a third to Diego Castro before an own goal for Adelaide made it 3-1. \nAdelaide remain winless after starting with two draws under new coach Guillermo Amor.
