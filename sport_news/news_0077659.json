He returned to the club as an academy coach earlier this year but according to Arsenal's current number 14, it's not as exciting for some of the prospects as it perhaps should be.\nSpeaking to the Evening Standard , Walcott said:\n\"Some are only 13 or 14 and they’re playing under-18s because they’re that good – so some didn’t know who he was...t hey know who he is now.\"\nIt sounds like Arsenal's academy need to hit YouTube.\nWe're not sure anyone with an interest in football and over the age of 10 can not know Thierry Henry. Should we really believe, you Theo?\n[via Evening Standard ]", "external_links": ["http://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/some-arsenal-youngsters-dont-know-who-thierry-henry-is-according-to-theo-walcott-a3085366.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:08:39.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
