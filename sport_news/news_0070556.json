I’m not [surprised]. I thought he could have done it last year also. He was just so limited (because of an ankle injury). When he came back we couldn’t run the football with him. Everything we did in the passing game was so limited. He was still putting up very good numbers. He was only about 60 percent.” \nBrown’s 2014 campaign started to peak around this time. He put up 361 total yards and fourth total touchdowns against Myrtle Beach. \nThis season, with only the normal bumps and bruises, he’s been the dynamic player Adams believed he could be all along. Through those eight games, he’s led Georgetown to a 6-2 record while passing for 1,773 yards and 16 touchdowns. \nBrown’s passing figures broke the school record previously set by Caleb Hughes, who threw for 1,620 yards in 2012 before signing at Limestone. Hughes played in 11 games that season. \nIt stands to reason that Georgetown will have at least that many games this year, if not more. \nMuch of his future potential is tied to the emergence of two top-end targets in Deakidd Anderson (643 yards, six touchdowns) and Cavonte Gamble (563 yards, six touchdowns). \nBut he’s also taking advantage of opposing defenses on the ground, where Brown has already run for 437 yards and 10 more touchdowns. By themselves, each of those totals leave him among the top 10 in the area. \nAt least slowing down all that production is Myrtle Beach’s primary defensive goal on Friday. The only team to hold Brown in check this year is Conway, which limited him to 100 total yards in the season opener. \nSince then, Brown has erupted in terms of both yards and touchdowns. His 26 combined scores lead the Grand Strand. \n“Any time you play a quarterback that can run and throw, it becomes a little more dangerous offensively,” Myrtle Beach coach Mickey Wilson said. “He’s a guy that can hurt you with his arms and his legs. I’m sure we’ll spy him some. We’re well aware of how good of a runner he is. He’s is able to beat you with some big plays.” \nGeorgetown (2-1 in Region VII-AAA) has to win the game in order to keep any hope of a title going into Week 10. Myrtle Beach (5-3, 3-0) can clinch at least a share of the region crown with a victory. HTC GAME OF THE WEEK \nThe other crucial Region VII-AAA contest will serve as HTC’s Game of the Week on Friday when North Myrtle Beach (5-3, 2-1) heads to St. James (4-4, 1-2). \nThe two teams, both of whom would be playoff bound if the season ended today, are jostling for postseason position. The game will be aired on HTC Channel 4, as well as HTCConnect.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:26:18.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
