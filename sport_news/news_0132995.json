Plain and simple,\" Trout said. \"We've got to fight to the end ... try to get to the postseason.\" \nLos Angeles remained a game behind Houston in the race for the second AL wild card spot after the Astros won 21-5 at Arizona later Friday night. But the Angels are a game up on Minnesota after the Twins lost at home to AL Central champion Kansas City. \nAlready assured a playoff spot, the Rangers could have won the division with a win over the Angels on Friday night, or a loss by the Astros.

(AP Photo/LM Otero) \nBut the champagne was put back on ice and the Rangers didn't even wait around to see what happened with the Astros. Especially with their game Saturday set for noon local time. \nBy time the scheduled postgame fireworks show was over, after most of the Rangers players had already left the ballpark, Houston already led 7-2 in the sixth inning at Arizona. \n\"Turn the page, come back tomorrow and be aggressive,\" shortstop Elvis Andrus said.

Trout hit the second pitch deep into the right-center gap, then slid headfirst into third base before emphatically pumping his right arm toward his teammates in the dugout. \n\"He did a good job of staying back and going the other way,\" Tolleson said. \"They asked me how I felt today and I told them I felt really good. And I did.\" \nPujols followed with a soft single to left field on the next pitch.

Smith had faced only batter since a foot injury Sept. 17 before taking over in the ninth. \nShin-Soo Choo matched his career high with his 22nd homer leading off the Texas fourth to tie the game at 1. \nHe also had a nice defensive play, catching Trout's slicing fly while running into the right-field corner to start the sixth.

But Perez then retired 19 of the last 21 batters he faced. \nRELIEVED WEAVER: \nJered Weaver, making his 20th career start at Texas, allowed two hits over six innings. \"When you're throwing up the stuff that I'm throwing up with this lineup and this ballpark, it was nice to be able to limit the damage and keep us in it,\" Weaver said. \"That's what I've been trying to do all year. It's been a hit-or-miss season.\" Texas Rangers Shin-Soo Choo (17) of South Korea celebrates his solo home run with teammate Elvis Andrus during the fourth inning of a baseball game against the Los Angeles Angels in Arlington, Texas, Friday, Oct. 2, 2015.

After DeShields walked and stole second base in the first, he tried also to steal third. Replay showed third baseman David Freese tagged DeShields' helmet on the headfirst slide before his extended hand got to the bag. Andrus thought he had an infield hit in the second. First baseman Cron made a nice stab, got up and hesitated briefly before sliding into the bag, just beating Andrus. \nTRAINER'S ROOM Texas Rangers Delino DeShields, right, is tagged out trying to steal third base against Los Angeles Angels third baseman David Freese (6) during the first inning of a baseball game in Arlington, Texas, Friday, Oct. 2, 2015. (AP Photo/LM Otero) \nAngels: Scioscia said right-handed reliever Huston Street, a week after a groin injury, was starting to \"activate his arm\" this weekend but clearly wouldn't be available to pitch. As for the playoffs if the Angels make it, \"We'll see how he feels in the next week,\" Scioscia said. \nRangers: DeShields said his left knee still gets tight at times, but other than that he is \"close to 100 percent.\" He had a mild sprain in his knee Sept. 7 and missed three games. He's missed only one since. \nUP NEXT Texas Rangers designated hitter Prince Fielder takes a high pitch during the first inning of a baseball game against the Los Angeles Angels in Arlington, Texas, Friday, Oct. 2, 2015. (AP Photo/LM Otero) \nAngels: Still in position for a playoff spot, left-hander Hector Santiago (9-9) takes the mound for the Angels. He is 3-0 with a 1.48 ERA in five starts this season against Texas. \nRangers: Right-hander Colby Lewis tries to increase his career high to 18 wins when he makes his 33rd start of the season.
