Overall, the Hawks had 551 yards of total offense.“We blocked well up front and were able to do some things on the perimeter,” Ironside said.With the game tied at 14 at the end of the first quarter, the Hawks proceeded to score 21 consecutive points in the second to take control of the game. The first score came on a trick play when Arters pitched the ball to Bryson Parks, who threw down the right sideline to a wide-open Bingo Long for a 29-yard touchdown. Consecutive 1-yard touchdown runs by Tavion Walker and Matthew Wilson pushed Hillgrove’s lead to 35-14.The Wolfpack scored with 9 seconds left in the first half on a 35-yard touchdown pass to D.J.

Overall, North Paulding had 463 yards of total offense.“We felt good about our defense (Friday),” Ironside said. “We gave up some points on special teams and a big play in the first half but held them in check in the second half.”Hillgrove outscored North Paulding 13-0 in the third quarter including a 45-yard touchdown catch by Jeremiah Bridges. He had a game-high 103 yards receiving on five catches with two touchdowns.Trevor Smith had a game-high 68 yards on the ground for the Hawks and added a touchdown in the fourth quarter.The victory keeps Hillgrove in the Region 4 race after dropping its contest to North Cobb last week. “It gives you a chance and some things have to happen,” Ironside said. “We’ve been there before. All we can worry about is Kennesaw Mountain next week and take it one game at a time.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:06:04.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
