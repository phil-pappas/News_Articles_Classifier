Punjab Agriculture University, Ludhiana, had established its third campus at Palampur in 1966, with a Junior College of Agriculture. Initially, the university had recruited teachers for the first and second year classes. Agriculture comes up only in the third year of the degree course. PAU preferred to transfer some teachers from its main campus to Palampur. A farm economist, Dr Gurdev Singh Brar, happened to be among those who were transferred. In those days, transport facilities were not as fast. Moreover, Palampur was considered a remote place and connectivity by bus or train was hazardous, even though nestled in the lap of the snow-clad Dhauladhar ranges, it was called the Switzerland of India. The route via Hoshiarpur was often closed in inclement weather. The last bus from Pathankot to Palampur left at 4.30 pm. While an Assistant Professor of English from Ludhiana returned the third day itself, Dr Brar had other reasons for his anguish. The Vice-Chancellor, Dr MS Randhawa, belonged to the clan of ICS cadre that was an institution in itself. No one could approach them for personal favours. But Dr Randhawa was made of different stuff. An art lover and floriculturist, he was humane under a gruff exterior. The annals of history will remember him as the chief planner of Chandigarh, as the man who created Rose Garden, not only in Chandigarh, but also in Ludhiana. His ‘Garden House’ residence in Kharar showed his penchant for flowers and trees. He preserved the cultural heritage of the Punjab Hills in multiple volumes he edited. Dr Randhawa would often visit Sardar Sobha Singh, the painter of the divine, and pardadi of Punjabi theatre, Norah Richards, at Andretta. Dr Brar had explored all possibilities of a sifarish for his transfer back to Ludhiana. One day, Saran Dass, an old man with a snowy moustache, visited Dr Brar in his office and said, “Sir, I retired from the PAU recently. I was on the personal staff of Dr Randhawa. I heard you hail from Patiala and may be going home next week during the Dashera holidays.” “Then what?” Dr Brar retorted. “Sir, my son lives there. I want to send across chhalian da atta for him. Would you kindly oblige me? My son will collect it from your place,” he implored. Dr Brar replied that he would if he happened to go there, but he was a bit disturbed as he had been transferred to Palampur. “Only flowers can please Dr Randhawa,” advised Saran Dass. “No other recommendation will work. If you want your transfer to be revoked, be alert. Whenever the Vice-Chancellor comes here, you meet him in the guesthouse, but don’t forget to take a garland of fresh flowers for him.” The elderly gentleman proved right. Flowers did the trick what other recommendations could not. His transfer was revoked.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:22:31.175+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
