Nwakali, who is set to depart leave for Spain on Friday, exclusively disclosed ‎that his parent club, Manchester City, urged him to join Segunda side Girona. “I was frustrated with the delay, for over five months Malaga couldn’t get me a work permit to play,” Nwakali explained to Completesportsnigeria.com. “And that was what prompted my move to terminate the contract and I’m happy with the resolution because now I can focus on football.” Nwakali who will be unveiled officially on Monday has been handed the jersey no.12 at the club. “‎I want to prove myself there because City knows I have a lot to offer,” he added. Nwakali also says he is pleased with the steady rise of his compatriot Kelechi Iheanacho who is currently injured. “He’s doing well and I pray he gets back to full fitness and his best form soon,” he added.
