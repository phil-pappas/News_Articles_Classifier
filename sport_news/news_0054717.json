If the Blue Devils lost, the Blue Water Area Conference title would’ve been solely given to Algonac. Since Richmond pulled out the victory, both Algonac and Richmond share the title along with the top two spots in our rankings. Richmond holds off Algonac, 15-14 \nSandusky (8-0), once again, annihilated their GTC East opponent to remain undefeated. The Redskins latest victim was Memphis (1-7), topping the Yellowjackets 54-12. The gritty Sandusky defense still has yet to let up 100 total points this season, giving up an average of just 11.75 points per game. \nCroswell-Lexington (6-2) stays at No. 4 after a thrilling 28-27 win over Almont (7-1) to not only clinch its first playoff spot in three years, but also keep the Raiders from sharing the BWAC title. \nMarine City (5-3) and Marysville (6-2) are still ranked No. 5 and No. 6, respectively. Marine City’s Sept. 11 win over Marysville still gives the Mariners the slight edge over the Vikings despite Marysville’s five-game win streak since that game. Ellul, Kiger talk about MAC Gold title \nPort Huron (2-6) and Port Huron Northern (4-4) each lost on Friday and have swapped poll positions from last week. The Big Reds are ranked No. 7 while the Huskies are No. 8 before this Friday’s can’t-miss crosstown rivalry game at Memorial Stadium. \nAfter losing three games in a row, Yale has responded by winning its last two with a combined score of 96-6. The Bulldogs latest victim was Imlay City, who took a 46-6 defeat to Yale, and they’ll try to end their season on an exclamation point against North Branch on Friday. \nRounding out our top ten is St. Clair (3-5), who fell to Marysville to officially be eliminated from playoff contention, snapping a three-year playoff streak. \nTop 10 Poll", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:53:47.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
