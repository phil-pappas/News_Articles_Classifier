Instead, he's opening the postseason as well, taking the hill against the Toronto Blue Jays for Game One of the ALDS. \nThe obvious reason for the assignment is that Gallardo has been brilliant against Toronto this season. But if the Blue Jays had beaten the Rays on Sunday, and if the Twins had beaten the Royals, Kansas City and Toronto would have ended the regular season with identical records. Toronto, owning the head-to-head advantage, would have faced the winner of the Wild Card Game, with Kansas City and its cadre of left-handed bats awaiting the Rangers. Who knows what Gallardo's role would have been. \nBut what happened happened, and now here we are: Game One in Toronto. Despite his success against Toronto, Gallardo hasn't seemed to pass the eye test recently. In fact, the last time he went deeper than 6 innings was on June 27th, when he went a season-high 8⅓ shutout innings, giving up just three hits and two walks. Any guesses on the opponent that day? Spoiler: it was the Blue Jays. \nHis other start against Toronto was also a three-hit shutout effort, though that outing on August 27th was a more Gallardo-esque 5⅓ inning effort. Based on those two starts, and Toronto's predominantly right-handed lineup, Gallardo earned the start. We could end the discussion there. \nBut let's not. Because a quick dig into the numbers shows us a something significant: despite his apparent inability to pitch more than five innings in a start, the Trimble Tech graduate who grew up rooting for the Rangers has absolutely earned the right to pitch for his hometown team in the postseason. \nHere are some statistics, organized by Yovani Gallardo's record. \nNO-DECISIONS : \nGallardo had 9 of them, and in six of the nine, he gave up two or fewer runs. In three of them, he allowed no runs whatsoever. The Rangers won six of those nine (including the two games in which Gallardo gave up 5 runs) and each of the three losses was in walk-off fashion. In the nine no-decisions, Gallardo averaged these numbers: 5.22 hits, 2.11 runs allowed (2.00 ER), 2 walks, 3.33 strikeouts, a 47% groundball rate, and a 3.60 ERA. He averaged 5.48 innings pitched. \nLOSSES : \nThere were eleven, to be exact. We won't dig in too much here, other than to say that Gallardo twice gave up five runs, but usually hovered around three. In one of his losses (July 12th against the Padres), he gave up only one run. \nIn his eleven losses, Gallardo averaged these numbers: 5.15 hits, 3.73 runs allowed (3.36 ER), 2.45 walks, 3.36 strikeouts, a 48% groundball rate, and an ERA of 6.24. He averaged 5.15 innings pitched. \nWINS : \nThirteen in 2015. In six of the thirteen (including the two against Toronto) Yovani gave up no runs at all. When he was good, he was very good. \nIn his thirteen wins, Gallardo averaged these numbers: 5.77 hits, 1.23 runs (1.15 ER), 1.77 walks, 4.15 strikeouts, a ground ball rate of 52%, and an ERA of 1.85. \nWHAT DOES ANY OF THAT MEAN? \nThe numbers, aside from ERA, are fairly consistent across the board. Yovani Gallardo has, by and large, pitched about 5½ innings per game, walked about two, and struck out between three and four strikeouts. He'll get groundballs about half the time, and give up 2-3 runs. His consistency speaks to the nature of baseball as a sport where wins and losses are often separated by the smallest of variances in performance. \nBut I want to go back to the no-decisions for just a moment. Here they are, listed by date: June 4: 6 ip, 1 run (0 earned), 4 Ks, 2 walks. Result: Rangers 2, White Sox 1 (W) June 10: 7 ip, 2 runs (2 earned), 10 Ks, 1 walk. Result: Athletics 5, Rangers 4 (L) June 21: 5 ip, 0 runs, 3 Ks, 1 walk. Result: White Sox 3, Rangers 2 (L) July 2: 6 ip, 0 runs, 2 Ks, 3 walks. Result: Rangers 2, Orioles 0 (W) July 25: 4 ip, 5 runs (5 earned), 3 Ks, 3 walks. Result: Rangers 7, Angels 6 (W) July 30: 6 ip, 5 runs (5 earned), 1K, 2 walks. Result: Rangers 7, Yankees 6 (W) August 11: 5⅔ ip, 0 runs, 1K, 3 walks. Result: Twins 3, Rangers 2 (L) September 1: 5 ip, 4 runs (4 earned) 2Ks, 2 walks. Result: Rangers 8, Padres 6 (W) September 25: 4⅔ ip, 2 runs (2 earned) 4Ks, 2 walks. Result: Rangers 6, Astros 2 (W) \nNotice anything significant about the three losses? Of course not, I left out some important notes. June 10: Tanner Scheppers (BS), Keone Kela (L) June 21: Ross Detwiler (BS), Alex Claudio (L) August 11: Jake Diekman (BS), Spencer Patton (L) \nTwo of the losses were before the trade deadline. Each of the losses included a blown save or a loss by at least one pitcher who is not on the postseason roster. \nYou could make the argument, Jake Diekman and Keone Kela's names up there notwithstanding, that as a result of a strong trade deadline and a maturing Kela, the Rangers have the best bullpen of any team remaining in the postseason. If Yovani Gallardo can just do what he's done: 5-6 innings, 2-3 runs allowed, the Rangers offense and bullpen are competent enough to finish the job. \nHe may not be an ace, but he's earned the chance to live his childhood dream: pitching in the postseason for his hometown Texas Rangers. \nBe sure to follow Levi on Twitter at @ThreeTwoEephus throughout the playoffs.
