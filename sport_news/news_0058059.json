A receiver caught a deflected pass and ran 28 yards into the end zone. \nIn Week 6, Arizona State found fortune, but the Sun Devils made no apologies, running past Colorado 48-23 on Saturday night in front of 44,157 at Sun Devil Stadium. \nWith the win, ASU arrived at the regular season’s mid-point at 4-2 and 2-1 in the Pac-12. Given its rough first-half schedule – Texas A&M, USC and UCLA – it’s not a bad place to be. The Sun Devils just took a different road than many expected, overcoming some significant speed bumps along the way. ASU XTRA app: Get latest news, analysis, scores, photos \nUp next: Saturday’s showdown at No. 5 Utah. At stake: First place in the Pac-12 South. \n\"The challenges you go through make you stronger, and I think we got a really strong team,\" ASU coach Todd Graham said. \nThe Sun Devils were sloppy at times, but the offense improved for the second consecutive week and the pass rush was outstanding. The biggest thing: There's room to grow. \nBOX SCORE: Arizona State 48, Colorado 23 \nThree key developments: \n- The Sun Devils found another playmaker . For most of the season, junior Tim White had showed flashes, both at receiver and in the return game. Against Colorado, however, he put it all together. The junior-college transfer and triple-jump standout had seven catches for 144 yards and two touchdowns. The second, came off a tipped 17-yard fourth-down pass that White caught and raced 28 yards to the end zone. \n\"He's no doubt one of our go-to guys,\" Graham said. Boivin: Odd Pac-12 season could help ASU \n- Antonio Longino is making strides . Through five games, the Sun Devils needed more production from their hybrid Devilbacker position. Longino – a senior who played weak-side linebacker last season – showed flashes in the Oct. 3 win at UCLA and carried the momentum over to Colorado. He finished with eight tackles, including 4.5 for loss and 2.5 quarterback sacks. \n\"When you got a guy like that making plays, disrupting the quarterback, the quarterback thinks about that,'' senior safety Jordan Simone said. \"He starts getting rid of (the ball) quicker and making bad choices and we were able to capitalize on some of those mistakes.\" \n- Sophomore running back Demario Richard left the game with a leg injury . ASU's leading rusher, Richard watched the second half while sitting on the trainer's table. He left the field on crutches. \n\"I don't know what Demario's status is,\" Graham said. \"We basically held him out, so we're hoping that that will be a good prognosis.\" \nColorado (3-3, 0-2) lost its 13 consecutive conference game, a streak that dates to 2013. The Buffaloes fell behind early and failed to mount much of a charge. \n\"Definitely frustrating,\" quarterback Sefo Liufau said. Analysis from ASU's win over Colorado \nASU senior quarterback Mike Bercovici -- the Pac-12's Offensive Player of the Week -- completed 20 of 31 passes for 260 yards with five touchdowns (which matched a career high) and an interception. For the second consecutive week, Bercovici established himself as a threat in the zone-read option, rushing for 40 yards. With each passing week, he looks more comfortable. \nJunior tight end Kody Kohl picked up a Richard fumble and rushed 28 yards for a touchdown and caught a 4-yard touchdown pass, both coming in the first quarter. With Richard out, senior receiver D.J. Foster took over the offense, breaking off a 63-yard run, his longest of the season. He finished with 101 all-purpose yards, 80 on the ground. \nOverall, ASU totaled 491 yards. The Sun Devils converted 10 of 17 third downs. It was enough to get red-shirt freshman Manny Wilkins on the field for the first time this season. The back-up quarterback entered mid-way through the fourth quarter and played the rest of the contest. \n\"We took care of business,\" Bercovici said. \nDefensively, ASU gave up passing plays of 42, 68 and 67 yards, but for the most part kept the Buffaloes in check. Behind Longino, the Sun Devils sacked Liufau eights times and pressured him on several other occasions. They also posted 12 tackles for loss. \n\"We got behind, so they were able to feast a little bit,\" Colorado coach Mike MacIntyre said. \"We had some guys wide open down the field. If we could have gotten it off, we would've had big plays. They did a good job applying pressure.\" Receiver Tim White helps ASU black out Colorado \nASU got off to a quick – and fortunate – start. In the first quarter, Richard broke three tackles but lost the football. The Sun Devils have had their problems with ball security, but no worries this time. Kohl picked it up and raced 28 yards into the end zone for ASU's first touchdown. \n\"One of the things we talk about is you play to the end of the whistle,\" Graham said. .. \"Our guys are hustling and making things happen out there.\" \nAnd after a rough start, they've put themselves in a good position. \n\"If we just do what we are coached to do, like I say every week, the sky is the limit for us,\" Simone said. \"Our offense is looking great and our special teams is really what has taken us to the next level. Guys are just giving tremendous effort all across the board and that is really the biggest thing for us.\" \nPhotos from the Colorado-Arizona State game: ASU head coach Todd Graham greets Colorado head coach Mike MacIntyre after defeating the Buffaloes 48-23 at Sun Devil Stadium on Oct. 10, 2015 in Tempe, AZ.
