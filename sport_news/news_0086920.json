He is joined by Jim Gilmore and George Pataki with less than 1 per cent support.\nFour hundred sixty-five Republicans were polled. Those polled were asked who would be their first choice among the current GOP candidates and Jindal received an asterisk, or less than 1 per cent support.\nWhen asked for their second choice, 1 per cent of those polled said they would choose Jindal.\nAccording to CNBC's guidelines, candidates need at least 2.5 per cent on an average of NBC, ABC, CBS, FOX, CNN and Bloomberg polls to qualify for the main stage event.\nThose with less than 2.5 per cent are invited to the undercard debate, which takes place just prior to the main event. Jindal has been polling at or below 1 per cent in each poll. â€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:08:30.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
