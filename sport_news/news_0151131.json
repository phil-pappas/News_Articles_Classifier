The Pirates, the club with whom his allegiances formerly lay, host the charging Cubs Wednesday in the do-or-die National League wild-card game. Collins will be in Chicago and a bear costume.\nThis can all be explained by a deep dive into the world of major league mascots, a society shrouded in secrecy, strange specifics and so, so little speaking. Collins was not available for comment for this story, but, hey, when was the last time a mascot talked?\nIn the business, the person in costume is referred to as the mascot's \"best friend\" or \"coordinator\" so as to maintain the illusion that the character is real. That's why the Pirates, too, had no comment; in their view, the parrot is the parrot even if Collins is gone.\nDavid Raymond was the original Phillie Phanatic, first sporting the furry, green garb back in 1978. He has seen just about every shift in the mascot universe these past four decades, but he can't recall an instance of a person jumping from one mascot costume to that of a rival team.\n\"I can't imagine me leaving the Phillies as the Phanatic and performing for the Mets, for God's sakes,\" Raymond said. \"Oh, boy, Mr. Met.\"\nHe was the Phanatic's \"best friend\" from 1978 to 1993.\nSince then, Raymond created Raymond Entertainment and has become a world-class mascot trainer and adviser. He met Collins at one of his mascot boot camps and, in 2004, helped him get his first job as the mascot of the Lake Elsinore Storm, a Class A baseball team in California.\nRaymond is plenty familiar with the Pirates. He has helped train most every Pirate Parrot, going all the way back to Kevin Koch, the bird's original coordinator. Koch was fired in 1985 for his involvement in baseball's cocaine scandal.\nWhen the Pirates needed to hire a new mascot coordinator in 2007, Collins auditioned. Raymond was hired to scout talent to invite to the tryout, which had \"all the anxiety that an American Idol audition could produce.\" It starts with a suit-and-tie interview.\n\"What they don't want to see is a silly, wacky, crazy employee,\" Raymond said. \"That would be disruptive. ... Alex was a total package of a good performer and a great employee.\"\nSo why did Collins want to leave after seven seasons? Well, he's from Indianapolis, and those who know him say he grew up a Cubs fan. When the Cubs started searching for their first Clark, it was almost a no-brainer for him. Before applying, Collins called Raymond to talk it over. His choice was clear.\n\"If Clark happens to show up to Pittsburgh (today) with Alex inside, it might spontaneously combust,\" Raymond said, laughing. \"We're mixing forces that we've never mixed before. You never know. This is uncharted water.\"\nErin Blank, the owner and president of Keystone Mascots in Brownstown, Pa., near Lancaster, spent four seasons as the Detroit Tigers mascot, Paws. When she won the job, an executive asked her, \"You understand you beat out 4,000 other applicants, right?\" Blank was shocked.\nShe also knows the life of a major league mascot isn't always easy. While some are strictly performers, she said, others are asked to run kids clubs and bring in sponsorships for the mascot. She even knew one mascot who needed to have a Class C driver's license because he was expected to move promotional items with a pallet truck.\nSo, when asked whether the mascot code might prohibit a performer from joining a rival club, she laughed. There are a few professional mascots out there who are fortunate enough to work for their childhood favorite team, but most are just trying to make a living.\nBlank doesn't know the particulars of the Pirates and Cubs jobs, but she wouldn't wag a finger at Collins for going to the Cubs.\n\"Alex has done a wonderful job of helping to bring Clark into the affectionate arms of the fold without stepping on too many toes,\" she said.\nAnd so the major league mascot wheel of fortune turned. When Collins became Clark, another Clark -- Clark Cairns -- became the Pirate Parrot's new best friend.\n\"Whoever wins,\" Raymond said, \"I'm friends with the mascot.\"\n(c)2015 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1733638", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1733638&h=Pirate+Parrot%2Dturned%2DClark+the+Cub+adds+another+level+of+intrigue+to+wild%2Dcard+game", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1733638&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:18:53.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
