John Dingell, the longest-serving member of Congress in U.S. history, has been released from the hospital after having a pacemaker installed to regulate his heart.\nThe office of Dingell's wife, U.S. Rep. Debbie Dingell, says the 89-year-old man left the hospital on Sunday after the procedure was performed last week.\nA post from Debbie Dingell on her Facebook page says there is \"work ahead but he remains at my side for wisdom and strength.\"\nA pacemaker can help control abnormal heart rhythms.\nJohn Dingell, a Democrat, served 59 years in Congress. His wife was elected to his Detroit-area seat last year after he didn't seek re-election.\n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
