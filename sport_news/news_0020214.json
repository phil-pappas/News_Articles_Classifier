Comment Hannibal Courier - Post - Hannibal, MO Writer Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 8:31 AM Posted Oct. 12, 2015 at 8:31 AM HANNIBAL Immanuel Baptist Church will be hosting a new season of Upward Basketball and Upward Cheerleading. Both events are open to all children first through sixth grades. Early registration for basketball and cheerleading is now underway and continues through Oct. 30. Late registration (which carries an additional fee) ends Nov. 3. Registration forms are available at the church office, 3600 McMasters Ave. The $60 early registration fee for Upward Basketball includes a reversible jersey, T-shirt, music CD, end-of-season award, and other items. Upward Cheerleading early registration fee is $60 and includes a cheer top and shorts, pom poms, megaphone, CD, end-of-season award and other items as well. Upward strives to promote the “winner” in every child by offering a non-competitive, non-threatening environment where every participant is given equal playing/cheering time in each game. Separate leagues are offered for boys and girls, with one-hour weekly practices and one-hour games on Saturday throughout the playing season. Each child must attend one evaluation period. These will be held Monday, Nov. 2, between 6:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. and Tuesday, Nov. 3, between 6:30 p.m. and 8 p.m. at Immanuel Baptist Church gym. The 2015-16 season practices will begin the week of Dec. 7, and the first game will be Saturday, Jan. 9. Awards night is scheduled for later in February. For information about Upward Basketball and Upward Cheerleading, contact the church office at 221-5119.
