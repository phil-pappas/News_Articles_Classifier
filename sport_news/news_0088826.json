He has also posted 704 rushing yards on 128 attempts, scoring seven times. \nWakefield currently sits in second place in the Cap 8 Conference behind two-time defending regional champion Wake Forest. The Wolverines are 6-2 overall and 3-1 in the Cap 8. \n\"I would like to thank my team, coaches and everyone that trained me, because I wouldn't have gotten this opportunity without them, and I'm thankful for them all,\" McKay said. \nMcKay and Wakefield will return to the field on Friday night at 7 p.m. when they travel to Broughton. \nFollow Nick Stevens on Twitter @NickStevensHSOT \nCopyright 2015 by Capitol Broadcasting Company.
