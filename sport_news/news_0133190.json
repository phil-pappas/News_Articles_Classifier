A lot of times it comes down to winning matchups. I thought we did a great job of winning some matchups down the field. ... Everybody contributed to this one.\n\"They can beat you in a bunch of different ways. If one thing doesn't work, they can move to the next.\"\nWhat happens when nothing works anymore for the Saints offensively? What's this next Jenkins is referring to? The problem is there is no more next.\nThat's exactly where the 1-4 Saints are now. No one can describe the offense of the Saints as \"prolific\" or as \"one of the league's best offenses\" anymore.\nThat's a lie. Those days are over. I don't know when -- or if -- they'll come back under Sean Payton and Drew Brees. There's no point in diluting the truth any longer about the Saints' offense.\n\"I see sparks, here and there, and we have to keep pushing, and that's what it's all about,\" wide receiver Brandin Cooks said.\nSparks here and there. That's what the Saints' offense has been reduced to in 2015.\nBrees hasn't been right since his shoulder injury a couple of weeks ago. I don't know when or if he'll be right any time soon. He's taking too many shots in the pocket with five sacks. Some are on the offensive line, some are on him. Regardless, Brees isn't the same hyper-confident superstar than he was in the past.\n\"He could throw for 350 yards,\" Jenkins said. \"I'd say he had an off day.\"\nThe off days are becoming more of the norm than the exception.\nBrees' frustration appeared to boil over when he couldn't hit C.J. Spiller on a wheel route (like the one he hit on to win the game in Week 4 against Dallas) and believed the defender, Jenkins, knocked Spiller out of bounds. Brees darted after the side judge and got in his face about the lack of a penalty.\nI can't ever remember Brees doing that. The frustration is real.\n\"It's not like you say we're talented or we've got this young talent, but man, it's just that we don't have good guys that's not coming together,\" Brees said. \"That's just not the case. We have great guys. We have great leaders.\n\"Guys want to do the right thing. Guys want to be great. So it's frustrating to sit here at 1-4 and say we're not getting the production out of that. We feel like we've got the right pieces in place. They just haven't come together yet. And it will.\"\nDon't be duped into the prolific statistics from Willie Snead, who hauled in six passes for 141 yards, or by Cooks, who snagged five receptions for 107 yards and a garbage-time touchdown as time expired to end Sunday's demolition. The Saints clearly don't have enough viable weapons.\nIn the running game, the Saints have only rushed for more than 100 yards twice this season. They did so by the skin of their teeth both times.\nI realize the offensive line played without budding left tackle Terron Armstead and Saints all-time great guard Jahri Evans. Instead, the Saints were forced to start first-round pick Andrus Peat and reserve guard Senio Kelemete. The Eagles' Fletcher Cox was more than happy to see them.\nThis isn't the same offensive line from the glory days.\nDrew Brees, 'This game should have been much closer. We turned the ball over four times' Drew Brees, 'This game should have been much closer. We turned the ball over four times'\nTurnovers are rampant, as you can add three lost fumbles and one interception to the increasing list. Plus, the Saints can't move the football consistently enough, and the playcalling seems stale at times.\nAfter the Saints trotted down the field for a touchdown on their second possession of the game, they ran only 16 plays the rest of the half for a miniscule 34 yards. Then the drives in the second half went field goal, fumble, punt, punt, fumble and interception before the last-second touchdown.\n\"When you don't convert on third down, when you turn the ball over, it's hard to win in this league,\" tight end Benjamin Watson said. \"As an offense, you have to be able to have consistent long drives and score points. That's when you win games. That's when everybody's happy. That's when you're doing your job.\n\"Obviously offensively, we're not doing our job collectively in getting beat the way we are.\"\nThe bottom line is that nothing comes natural for the Saints' offense. You're more surprised when the Saints actually hit on a shot play than when they don't.\n\"The most disappointing thing in any occupation is when you put in a lot of work, hard consistent work, like we do in this game and not have the fruit of winning,\" Watson said. \"Last week, we got to reap the benefits of winning. This is a winning business. We all understand that. Bottom line, that's what it's about. It doesn't matter how you do it. It just matters that you do it. It's as disappointing for us as it is for the fans or it is for you guys covering us.\n\"There's really no excuse.\"\nActually there is an excuse. The Saints don't have a high-powered offense.
