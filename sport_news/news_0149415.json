I believe that we will win! I believe that we will win!\"\nBelieve it.\nHarvick has mastered his Game 7 races, his nerves steeled and never rattled from any pressure that should come in a must-win spot.\nHe delivered one more time and dominated a race he had to win to advance to the second round of NASCAR’s playoffs. Mired in 15th in the standings, Harvick went out and led 355 laps Sunday at Dover International Speedway and earned the third automatic berth in the 12-driver Chase for the Sprint Cup championship field.\n\"Never quit. That’s why right here, guys,\" Harvick said over the radio as he took the checkered flag.\nHarvick’s title defense lives on.\nJimmie Johnson’s bid for a record-tying seventh championship came to a shocking end when a busted part sent the No. 48 Chevrolet to the garage and sent him plummeting in the standings.\nNASCAR had the drama it craved Sunday when it revamped its playoff format last season. Dale Earnhardt. Jr. earned the final transfer spot over Jamie McMurray on a tiebreaker. Earnhardt finished third and McMurray was fourth Sunday.\nPaul Menard and Clint Bowyer also were eliminated as the Chase field was sliced from 16 to 12. Four more drivers will be eliminated in the next three-race segment that starts this week at Charlotte Motor Speedway.\nJoe Gibbs Racing drivers Denny Hamlin and Matt Kenseth had already earned berths in the next round with wins in the first two Chase races. Carl Edwards also advanced along with Joey Logano, Ryan Newman, Kurt Busch, Brad Keselowski, Martin Truex Jr., Jeff Gordon and Kyle Busch.\nThey all had a shot at knocking out Harvick.\nNow, they all have to deal down the stretch with a driver who has led 571 of 700 laps run the last two weeks. That’s bad news for the field.\nHarvick brushed aside some stout circumstances against him to reach Victory Lane: He hadn’t won since going back to back in the third and fourth races of the season and had been 0-for-29 at Dover. An easy title favorite, he finished 42nd in the Chase opener at Chicagoland and 21st at New Hampshire.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:45:42.533+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
