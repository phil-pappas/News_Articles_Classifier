Unfortunately he goes to Chile. You cannot stop him from going to Chile and he loves so much to play for his country,\" Wenger said. \n\"Hopefully he will come back in good shape.\" \nThe 65-year-old Frenchman also heaped praise on forward Theo Walcott, who set up two of the three goals on Sunday. \n\"He (Walcott) did really fight today and showed he can fight, commit and protect the ball as well. He is gaining some aspects of his game as a centre forward and they are improving,\" Wenger said. \n(Reporting by Shravanth Vijayakumar in Bengaluru; editing by Sudipto Ganguly ) \nOur top photos from the month of September.
