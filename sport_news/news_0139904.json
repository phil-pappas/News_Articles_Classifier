One of the front wheels of the engine came off the track. All the passengers of the train with about 15 coaches escaped unhurt as the train was rolling down slowly near the junction and the loco pilot was able to stop the engine.\nSoon the railway staff got into action and roped in extra staff to bring back the engine on track. Though there was panic situation to start with, railway officials were able to control the situation by speeding up the repair works.\nSpeaking to TOI, Suvankar Biswas, Bengaluru-based public relation officer of the South Western Railway (SWR), said the railway staff were able to attend to the problem quickly and the engine was brought on to the track by about 11.10 am. \"The passenger train leaves Bengaluru city railway station at about 9 am and takes four hours to reach Mysuru.
