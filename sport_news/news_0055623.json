(AP) - More than $1 million in funding has been released to help struggling New Hampshire fishermen and fishing communities.\nThe funds released from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will assist the commercial groundfishing industry and for-hire fishing vessels. They are in addition to the more than $2 million in fishery disaster funds that have been released to New Hampshire in the past two years.\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen said the funds will provide an important lifeline to New Hampshire's fishing industry, which \"continues to struggle under onerous federal catch limits and regulations.\"\nShaheen was part of an effort to secure disaster relief last year for affected fishing communities, including $32.8 million for New England.\nShe, U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta and Sen. Kelly Ayotte have spoken out against rising fees for fishermen.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
