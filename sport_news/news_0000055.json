Sarkisian later apologized, blaming the tirade on medications. But boosters don’t forget and, after USC’s home loss to Sarkisian’s former team, Washington, and Sarkisian not healthy enough to finish the Trojans’ Sunday practice, it was time for a change. \nCoaching major college football is now a high-pressure job. Sarkisian was 12-6 overall in his second year with the Trojans, who came off NCAA probation over the offseason when they earned the claim of 2015’s best recruiting class. The future may look bright, but right now the present is very cloudy. \n■ Dodgers backup infielder Chase Utley has appealed his two-game suspension following a hard slide into second base that injured Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada in Saturday’s Game 2 of their NLDS matchup. \nI thought it was a hard slide, a hard-nosed play by Utley, who was in the baseline. Though Utley’s slide appeared a tad late, I thought it was a legal play, and no intent to injure Tejada, who was spinning backward before the slide and in a prone position with his back to first base. If the Mets are smart, they need to concentrate on winning Game 4 at Citi Field and not get sidetracked by emotions against the former Phillie. \n■ Richie Rich’s Top 10 rankings in College Football: 1.
