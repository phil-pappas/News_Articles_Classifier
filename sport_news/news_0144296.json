The Flames won that series in six games to advance to the second round, where they lost in five to Anaheim.\nVancouver defenseman Ben Hutton recorded his first point in his NHL debut with an assist on Hansen's goal. Canucks goalie Ryan Miller made 29 saves.\nJiri Hudler scored for Calgary and Karri Ramo finished with 39 saves.\nVancouver stretched its lead to 4-1 at 8:17 of the third when Flames defenseman Dennis Wideman knocked down a long, off-speed shot by Burrows, but tipped it into his own net past Ramo.\nHenrik Sedin scored on a sharp-angled wrist shot with 3:29 left to cap the scoring.\nHansen got the Canucks on the scoreboard first when he took Hutton's cross-ice pass along the boards and beat Ramo top corner glove side with a blast from the top of the circle at 10:34 of the first period.\nSutter doubled the lead with about 2 minutes left in the period in his first game in a Canucks jersey. He batted a rebound out of the air past Ramo with a deft touch.\nHudler broke through for the Flames at 3:39 of the second. Canucks defenseman Luca Sbisa turned the puck over under pressure from Sean Monahan, and Johnny Gaudreau got the puck and passed it to Hudler who beat Miller between the pads.\nDaniel Sedin restored Vancouver's two-goal lead with 5 seconds left in the period. A shot by Dan Hamhuis deflected off Ramo and then Sedin and into Calgary's net to make it 3-1.\nCalgary's Micheal Ferland and Vancouver's Derek Dorsett fought just seconds after the opening faceoff. Flames winger Brandon Bollig and Canucks forward Brandon Prust then traded punches 8 minutes into the game.\nNOTES: The Canucks acquired Sutter from Pittsburgh in July in exchange for forward Nick Bonino, defenseman Adam Clendening and a draft pick. ... The Flames fell to 0-5-1 in their last six season-openers and have lost their last two to the Canucks. ... Calgary's scratches were forward Mason Raymond and goalie Joni Ortio; Vancouver's were forward Jake Virtanen, defenseman Yannick Weber and goalie Jakob Markstrom.\n< PREVIOUS SLIDE SLIDE 1 of 7 NEXT SLIDE > Vancouver Canucks Derek Dorsett, right, has his shot kicked away by Calgary Flames goalie Karri Ramo, from Finland, during the second period of an NHL hockey game in Calgary, Alberta, Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2015.
