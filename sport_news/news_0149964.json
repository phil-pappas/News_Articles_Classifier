Hayden Roers returned a kickoff for the other Saints touchdown. \nThe win is the second in a row for Hohenfels, which has turned in two straight lopsided wins since opening its season on the wrong side of a Bitburg blowout. The 2-1 Tigers return to Italy to take on Naples next weekend. \nThe Saints fall below .500 with the setback. They'll take a 1-2 overall record and surviving postseason hopes into next weekend's visit to Vicenza.
