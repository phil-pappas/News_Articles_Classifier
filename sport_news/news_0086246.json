And while a tried-and-true Buffalo bone-chiller is probably still some ways away, Sunday's match-up against the Bengals will be a good \"warm up\" for the winter.\nTemperatures before and during the game, which kicks off at the standard 1 p.m., will mostly be in the 30s to just around 40 degrees. The wind will be under 10 mph, even with the gusts, so the wind chill will not be a factor. A few peeks of sun may even take away a bit of the chill from time to time.\nThere is a chance for a shower or flurry to pass through, though most of the lake effect will be south or well east of Orchard Park. If it does snow, it would be the first NFL game this season with snow in the air. Any precipitation, wet or white, should be brief and light.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:50:29.862+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
