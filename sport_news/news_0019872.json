Coaches Who Care: Penfield's Dave Hennessey goes extra mile Dave Hennessey has had quite an impact on Penfield runners.

His boys and girls cross country teams have combined for nearly 1,000 wins. The past two years, Hennessey has been asked to help and chauffeured at prom for his runners. 11 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWhen Katie Lembo's prom plans came together late a couple years ago and the former Penfield track standout couldn't find a limousine, Dave Hennessey volunteered his car and his chauffeuring services. The longtime track and field and cross country coach did it again last spring. \nHe kept the van that he rented to take runners to the Penn Relays in Philadelphia an extra day — the runners paid for that extra time — and looking spiffy in his tuxedo and white gloves, Hennessey chauffeured five Penfield couples to prom in it. \n\"It was a lot of fun,\" says Cameron MacKenzie, a sophomore on the cross country team. \"That’s like the main thing my Dad remembers, that our coach drove us to prom. He brags about him all the time. How most coaches wouldn’t do that.\" \nComplete series: Coaches Who Care \nHennessey, who certainly goes the extra mile for his runners, is the next winner of the Coaches Who Care award, a joint initiative between the Democrat and Chronicle and Compeer Rochester to recognize top coaches in Section V. The 63-year-old is in his 40th season coaching cross country, indoor track and outdoor track at Penfield, where \"Hen\" is a legend. With more than 500 victories in boys competitions and close to 500 for girls, the Rush-Henrietta graduate and retired social studies teacher at Victor is recognized as the nation's dual-meet wins leader in cross country by the National Federation of State High School Associations. “The 63-year-old is in his 40th season coaching cross country, indoor track and outdoor track at Penfield, where \"Hen\" is a legend.” . \nHe has coached more than a dozen state champions and All-Americans, but forget about the accolades. The man wants what's best for his runners. \n\"They're my kids,\" said Hennessey, who is single and has dedicated his life to the sport. \nAs for his chauffeuring services, his after-prom presence certainly helped ease the minds of parents and calm his own concerns about his runners \"doing something they’re not supposed to,\" he said. \n\"He really pushes us to be our best,\" said junior Bradley Farnham, who has run all three seasons for Hennessey since he was in eighth grade. \"If we have a bad race, he’ll inform us of what we did wrong but he’s never mean about it. He’ll be like, ‘This is what you can do better.’ He really cares about us individually and as a team.\" Buy Photo \nDave Hennessey, cross country coach at Penfield High School, at practice on Oct. 14, 2015. (Photo: SHAWN DOWD/@sdowdphoto/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) \nHennessey also founded the His and Her Invitational 37 years ago with Lance Bush and former University of Rochester cross country coach, John Izzo. The outdoor track event for high schools is unique in that it combines the results of girls and boys competitors. “He has a way of challenging these kids that’s unique. It’s funny. In some ways they don’t want to let him down.” Pete Shambo, Penfield AD \n\"To have the ability to impact kids over a span of 40 years, sometimes people grow out of that contact piece,\" but Hennessey hasn't, Penfield athletic director Pete Shambo said. \"He has a way of challenging these kids that’s unique. It’s funny. In some ways they don’t want to let him down.\" \nHennessey, of course, credits his runners for being \"self-motivated\" and \"internally driven.\" But that stems from how he prods them. \n\"I never see him as the guy that’s going, ‘If you don’t this!’ That’s not his personality,\" Shambo said about how Hennessey gets the best out of his runners. \"I call it the 'it' factor with some coaches. Some coaches have it and you know it when you see it. You can’t necessarily put your finger on it, but he has it.\" \nHennessey impacts hundreds of kids each year, too. This fall there are 81 boys and girls on his cross country teams. He expects 100 more competitors for indoor track and about 130 for outdoor. There is some crossover, of course, with some kids running multiple seasons, but his reach is widespread and it's not just at Penfield.

(Photo: SHAWN DOWD/@sdowdphoto/, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) \nBush credits Hennessey, who is in Section V's indoor and outdoor track Halls of Fame, for running a weekly program each summer that's open to kids from any school and includes runners as young as toddlers. And if you think running as too individualistic, think again. \nMacKenzie said her coach is keen on the \"pack\" mentality for his squads, meaning runners should push each other. \"You need to make sure (teammates) are thinking positively, not just yourself,\" she said. \"And if they're not (he wants us to) help them feel their best.\" \nHennessey, who says former R-H coach Gary Thompson got him involved in running later in high school, said he has always enjoyed being able to help kids grow athletically and away from the sport, too, so they \"mature as individuals.\" Since retiring from teaching several years ago, he routinely gets asked how much longer he'll coach. \n\"I've told my fellow teachers and retirees ... it's kind of nice (now),\" he said. \"I get my kid fix and I don't have to grade essays anymore.\" \nJDIVERON@Gannett.com \nComplete series: Coaches Who Care \nAbout the award \nThe Coaches Who Care Award recognizes individuals who’ve shown a commitment to players that goes beyond only developing a winning team.
