(AP Photo/Tony Dejak) LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) Louisville says assistant coach Ralph Willard will take an indefinite medical leave of absence from the program to address an unspecified health issue.\nAdChoices Cardinals director of basketball operations David Padgett has been moved into an assistant coach's position to replace Willard, a 39-year veteran who rejoined Rick Pitino's staff in April. Willard guided Louisville against a Pitino-led Puerto Rican national team in August.\nWillard expressed disappointment in a statement Monday, but Pitino said his concern is making sure Willard ''gets healthy and has a speedy recovery from some problems that need immediate attention.''\nPadgett was a three-year Cardinals starter from 2005-08 and played professionally in Spain before serving three seasons as an IUPUI assistant. Pitino said Padgett ''knows the system as well as anyone here'' and expects a smooth transition.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:12:40.576+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
