We didn’t necessarily feel like we got beat by a better team. They played better than we did today, but it was frustrating having us back up their points. \n“We look forward to playing them again.” \nThe Knights were led by JaNasjia Bethke who hit the double digit figures in both aces and kills (with 10 each). Emily Buchanan had eight kills and five blocks, while Taylor Oshiro added six kills and another five blocks. \nValencia 3, Canyon 0 \nThe Vikings continue to cruise through the Foothill League as they swept the Cowboys 3-0 by scores of 25-10, 25-22, 25-10 at Valencia High Tuesday. \nLauren Russ, who was sidelined for the first two league matches due to a rolled ankle and returned last Thursday for Valencia, had a game-high 13 kills for the Vikings. \nValencia’s Holly Pittman, Emily Burns, and Bri Coleman each tallied six kills in the win. This was Coleman’s first league match after she sat out the required 30-day period for transferring from Saugus. \nCanyon’s Sasha Oakley led the Cowboys with nine kills, while Breanna Kelley added six kills on the night. Freshman libero CJ Catabona had 12 digs in the loss. \nThe Cowboys are still searching for a Foothill win as they move to 0-4 in league and 5-6 overall. \nValencia has only dropped one game in its four matches so far in conference play and remain unbeaten in both league play (4-0) and overall (8-0). \nHart 3, Golden Valley 0 \nHart also kept the pedal to the metal, as it swept its match against Golden Valley by scores of 25-11, 25-9, 25-9. \nAmy McKee and Brooke Boron led the Indians on the attack with seven and six kills, respectively. \nMcKee also had a nice service night with three aces, but it was Sarah Coblentz that led Hart with seven aces. \nOutside hitter Kelsey Bauer had seven kills for the Grizzlies. \n“They jumped on us every game, and they played really well,” said Golden Valley Erick Beck about Hart. “They looked like they were playing for a league title.” \nAlthough it wasn’t playing for a league title at Hart High on Tuesday, the Indians do face off with the Vikings on Thursday at Valencia High. \nHart improves to 4-0 in the Foothill play and 8-3 overall. Golden Valley moves to 6-10 overall and 1-3 in league with the loss. \nWest Ranch 3, Saugus 1 \nWest Ranch picked up its second straight league win, defeating Saugus 3-1 by scores of 25-14, 25-17, 19-25, 25-20. \nAnnika Bergstrom and Tasha Skabelund both had 10 kills for the Wildcats. Kaitlin Schultz had three blocks, while Katie Jacobs had 35 assists, and Ryann Desser had 14 digs. \nCaitlin Liebe and Alison Ritchie each had six kills for the Centurions, who drop to 1-3 in the Foothill League and 9-11 overall. \n“It was a rough night,” said Saugus head coach Eric Luckenbach. “This was the most disconnected that we’ve been. But a lot of the things that we are doing are in our control.” \nLuckenbach said the Cents have struggled with health in the beginning of the season, but Tuesday night they were able to finally have everyone back on the court. \nSaugus will try to rebound when it travels to Canyon tomorrow. For West Ranch (10-7, 2-2), it hopes it can stay on its winning streak as it battles Golden Valley on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:28:35.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
