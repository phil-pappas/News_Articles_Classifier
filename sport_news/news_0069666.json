Osage intercepted five passes and set up the offense for success, according to head coach Devin Johnson. \n“Our first two scores were set up because of short fields because of our defense,” Johnson said. “Whenever your defense steps up and makes plays like that it does put your offense in a much better spot. And this was a game where, finally, we had six turnovers, but we saw guys step up and going after it and making plays. That was something we’ve preached all year is don’t be afraid of the moment, go make the plays.” \nThe momentum that the Indians created with that win is important. Osage has had an up and down season, so ending the season on a strong note can lead to more confidence going into tonight’s district opener against Springfield Catholic. \n“Especially when you’re playing five sophomores and a freshman, you’re playing a lot of young guys and they need some momentum,” said Johnson. “We needed something good to happen. We had a tough three-week stretch where we were playing good teams and we were playing well at times, we just didn’t 48 minutes and to come off a victory and finally see what we can do. We do have a little bit of confidence going into week 10 and being able to host also helps out a ton.” \nThat momentum was provided largely by the Indian defense and that defense will be important, because they’re playing a team that can put up points. Springfield Catholic, Johnson admits, is a tough team to read. They’ve had an up and down season and these two teams have no common opponents. That makes it harder to judge games based on who the opponent is. While it makes Springfield Catholic harder to read, it means Osage can just focus on itself this week. \n“Whenever you play a team like this where you have no familiarity with the teams, you haven’t seen any of the teams they’ve played, you haven’t seen them, there’s no common opponent, it’s always tough to gauge,” Johnson said. “It’s always a little bit scary to go into a game like that because of the unfamiliarity, but it’s also kind of exciting and fun that we can kinda just take a step back…you can focus on what we’re gonna do to win. Where we’re at in the season is what are we gonna do to be successful, what are we gonna do to win, what are we gonna do to attack them offensively, how do we stop them defensively…it allows our players to focus on what they’re doing.” \nDefensively, the Indians will focus on the running game. Springfield Catholic spreads it to a number of different backs, which makes it difficult to key on one player in particular. While they do have a number of players, Ramiro Avila is a player they’ll need to keep an eye on both offensively and defensively. \n“(Avila) is a kid where most of their runs are really big plays, he’s been the one that’s busted em,” Johnson said. “He’s one of their faster kids and he’s a tough runner. He’s a downhill runner.” \nOn the other side of the ball, Avila is part of a pair of talented middle linebackers. This is the second week in a row the Indians will face a team with strong middle linebackers. Last week, they struggled to move the football against Hallsville’s defense, though that was largely due to the number of personnel adjustments they had to make, according to Johnson. They shifted people around because they lost Wheeler, most notably Dylan Riley seeing time at quarterback. Johnson thinks the running game should look much better this week with a consistent backfield. \n“Well last week we were mixing it up in the backfield, playing some different personnel to see what was going to work best and I think that we found that,” Johnson said. “So this week, we’ve got the guys that we want in place and hopefully we’re better just because of more consistency with personnel more than anything.” \nSpringfield Catholic also tends to play away from opposing wide receivers, rather than tight to the line of scrimmage. This should give the Indians some quick passing opportunities underneath, which is important with a freshman quarterback this late in the season. \n“The shots that we take in the passing game, especially with a freshman quarterback, is going to be familiar routes, it’ll be familiar footwork and it’ll be things that will be an easy reads for him to do,” Johnson said. “We’re not gonna do anything too complicated in the passing game, we’re going to make his progression things he’s done all year…we’ll try to get the ball out quick and we’ll try to make sure he’s moving out of the pocket, doing things like that to make him more comfortable.” \nThe Indian defense will have to continue to play well tonight if Osage wants to make it to the semifinals. At the end of the day, the focus is making sure the Indians focus on playing well, not what the other team is doing. \n“Our message for our guys is the focus is always on us,” Johnson said. “You know, when it comes to football at this time of year, it’s about us making the plays. It’s not about our opponent and who they are, it’s about us making the plays, it’s about us putting ourselves in the best position to win and it’s about us getting better each and every week. And if we focus on ourselves and getting better and focus on what we do, then everything (tonight) takes care of itself.” \nSchool of the Osage hosts Springfield Catholic - Updates on Twitter: @SOTOsports .
