In the gold medal run in which mostly Jayhawks doubled as Team USA, Selden was his club’s leading scorer four times and was named to the all-tournament team after averaging 19.3 points and 6.5 rebounds. Both were team-bests. \nSelden scored a team-high 22 in the gold-medal win against Germany, but even that outing had its variances. The six field goals Selden made came on 28 attempts. Still, Selden canned the 3-pointer, one of two he made on 11 attempts, that gave Team K-USA the lead for keeps in the second overtime. \n“I looked at our Korean stats this summer, and he played really, really well, but he actually shot the ball no better from the 3 than what he did last year,” Self added. “But what he did was he drove the ball. He got fouled. He forced help, and he played to his athletic ability and his strength.” \nSo what is the key to consistency? \n“If he relies on his athletic ability and is aggressive enough to play to his athletic ability,” Self said, “I think consistency will come. I think he can impact us in a much bigger way than what he has the first two years.” \nThose ups and downs included a season-ending thud last March. \nThe Jayhawks fell on the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament to Wichita State. The Shockers, highly motivated, prevailed 78-65. Selden happened to be one of the worst players on the floor. He missed all five shots he took, while adding one rebound, no assists and two turnovers in 23 minutes. \nCriticism escalated. And, what ensued could be the worst-case scenario involving a prized prospect — a recruit billed with one-and-done potential who will now return for a third college season. \nIn part, Selden based his return on the early letdowns the Jayhawks experienced the past two seasons. And, in part, he wisely considered options that were best for him. \n“Not winning, not doing what we wanted to do, not leaving something undone — that was the big thing,” Selden said. “And too, not being ready to make that jump yet. ... This place is special, but it’s basketball at the end of the day. It’s basketball, but it’s a business. You’ve got to make smart business decisions, smart basketball decisions.” \nBetter basketball will make for a better business deal when Selden turns pro. \nImprovement as a junior — something consistent, something steady, something solid — could result in that leap. Selden has already been named to preseason All-America teams, based in part on his play in the World University Games. With the exception of tighter interpretations for traveling, Selden played great in Korea. \n“He was the best player on the floor, for any team by far, especially for us,” said teammate Devonte Graham. “I think that tournament did him justice, getting all the negative energy out of his body and out of his head.” \nA starter in every game he has played for KU, Selden will get the opportunity he needs from Self. \nHe could do so mostly as a 3-man — ahead of two teammates (Brannen Greene and Svi Mykhailiuk) with shooting range coveted by pro scouts — if the Jayhawks remain intent on using Graham and Frank Mason together in a small backcourt. \n“When Devonte and Frank are in the game it just makes it easier on everybody else,” Selden said. “They give me my points because I can score off them, and their penetration.” \nImagine, if everything started coming easy for Selden. Every night out. \nTo do that, Selden must block out critics. He learned that after his freshman year, when he admits “at first it might get to you” as a player with high expectations, but just 18 years old when he picked Kansas as a five-star prospect. \nNow he’s 21, still at KU and capable, he says, of tuning out all distractions. \n“What is it? Rain off the coat?” Selden asked, then laughed when told it was water off the back. “Yeah, that’s it. It’s nothing. I was scrutinized a lot last season, but at the end of the day I’m in a great spot. \n“I’m at a top university, school getting paid for, so I can’t complain at all if I don’t play well in a game. It never really gets too crazy in my head with all the negative talking. The higher you get, the more (criticism) there’s going to be, so you might as well take it now.” \nIf Selden continues the surge he was on this summer, he can keep it from being said. \nKevin Haskin can be reached at (785) 295-1159 or kevin.haskin@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:16:26.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
