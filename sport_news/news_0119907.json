A fourth product of the feeder system, Imbimbo, is Sitkowski’s backup. \nGalante and Imbimbo played for the now-defunct Old Bridge Knights, while Sitkowski and Cocozziello are products of the Sayrewoods South youth program, according to Lanzafama. \nAfter Sayreville limited Old Bridge to 63 rushing yards on 27 carries, the Knights needed Sitkowski’s performance to improve to 4-2 overall and 4-1 in the Red Division. \n“Artur is mature and he’s really starting to let the game come to him a little bit,” Lanzafama said. “He was not rattled at all in the game. He was poised and he just took it play-by-play and tried to make the next throw. He makes very good decisions.” \nSitkowski, who has received scholarship offers from Rutgers and Maryland, has always possessed a strong and accurate arm but is now improving his touch. The 6-foot-4, 205-pound signal caller is surprisingly mobile in the triple-gun. \n“He’s more of a pocket-type kid,” Lanzafama said, “but he can move and buy some time with his feet. He’s a hard worker and wants to be the best he can be. \n“Every day at practice, he’s getting better.\" \nGMC FOOTBALL WEEK 6 TOP PERFORMERS \nRUSHING", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:14:43.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
