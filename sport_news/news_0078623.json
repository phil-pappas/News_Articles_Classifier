That’s what the Blue Jays are looking at.\nThe Texas Rangers completed a two-step through Rogers Centre on Friday, taking a 2-0 lead in the American League Division Series by surviving a 14-inning epic to post a 6-4 win. And the magic summer when the postseason returned here for the first time since 1993 is suddenly about to become a footnote in franchise history.\nForget any World Series talk. If the Blue Jays don’t somehow pull off two wins in Arlington, they won’t be playing baseball in these parts again until April and it will be time for folks here to focus all their attention on Mike Babcock’s Leafs.\nThe Toronto clubhouse was a mixture of shock, anger and confusion after this one. It was the longest postseason game in time and innings for both teams – a 4-hour, 57-minute extravaganza that saw batting practice for breakfast, a first pitch during the lunch hour and the last of 421 pitches made in the middle of dinner.\n“To lose two in a row at home is obviously not the way you want to start a series,” said Toronto shortstop Troy Tulowitzki. “Since I’ve been around, teams that make a run always have to answer something and this will be ours: To go down, 2-0, and come back to win a series. It’s not where you want to be but it’s not over.”\nHistory, however, says otherwise. In the 27 previous division series where the home team slipped into an 0-2 hole, only the 2001 Yankees and 2012 Giants have escaped to advance.\nThis game was one of the most bizarre in recent postseason history. Consider:\n• We had a bench-clearing incident – in the 13th inning, no less – as Josh Donaldson unleashed a stream of F-bombs clearly visible on replay at Texas reliever Keone Kela right after just sending a potential walkoff home run foul to left. Donaldson appeared to be upset by a quick pitch and let the Rangers pitcher know about it as soon as his rocket landed in the 200 level seats just outside the foul pole. There were no punches thrown but the tension in the game and the series was certainly ramped up.\n“We made eye contact and exchanged a few words,” Donaldson said. “He didn’t back down, I didn’t back down. It was a couple things but I’ll just leave it at that.”\n• There was a replay controversy, adding the Blue Jays to the bad week in the technology department endured by the Detroit Lions and Buffalo Sabres. Tulowitzki appeared to catch Rougned Odor off second base on a throw behind the runner from Jose Bautista in right with two out in the 14th.\nReplays showed some daylight. The umpires, in consultation with their friends in New York, called Odor safe and No. 9 hitter Hanser Alberto snapped a 4-4 tie with an RBI single to right-center off LaTroy Hawkins.\nThe massive Jumbotron in center field showed the replay over and over, like baseball has done to ensure transparency. It looked like the Jays had a case but the call stood. (Memo to the NHL in the wake of the Sabres offside play on Thursday: If there’s a challenge, put the replay on the board for fans in the arena like baseball does.).\n“From what we saw, looked like there might have been a little gap,” said Jays manager John Gibbons. “But whether enough to overturn or not, apparently not. So that’s the way it goes.”\n“Anytime in today’s game with replay when there’s a close play you try to keep a tag on him and that’s what I was doing there,” Tulowitzki said. “Apparently, ‘Gibby’ called them and it was close enough to review. Unfortunately, it didn’t go our way.”\n• The Blue Jays lost a key reliever when lefty Brett Cecil suffered a torn calf muscle on a rundown in the eighth inning. Toronto’s most reliable bullpen arm the last two months of the season is almost certainly done for the rest of the postseason, however long that may be.\n• The strike zone of plate umpire Vic Carapazza was a joke most of the day, with hitters and catchers from both sides openly showing their disgust. Carapazza didn’t decide the game but sure contributed to the lack of offense. It was 3-3 through two wacky innings and each team only managed one more run until the 14th.\n“When it constantly changes, it’s tough for us to do what you’re trying to do,” said Jays outfielder Kevin Pillar. “Up, down, all around, you have to pick a side. If you want a bigger zone, then make the plate bigger.”\nTo their credit, the Jays weren’t blaming the umpires, the replay or Kela. They were blaming themselves.\nThe meat of the order turned into gristle in this one. Presumptive MVP Donaldson, Jose Bautista, Edwin Encarnacion and Tulowitzki combined to go 2 for 22 with seven strikeouts in the Nos. 2-5 spots in the lineup. In the last 12 innings, the Blue Jays managed just one run and five hits.\nMeanwhile, the bottom third of the Rangers’ order scored seven of their 11 runs in the two games here. No. 9 hitter Robinson Chirinos blasted a two-run homer in Game One off David Price and Alberto, a 22-year-old with a .222 average in the regular season, was deuces filling in for sore-backed Adrian Beltre.\nIt was a flat-out goofy game over the first two innings with the score locked at 3-3 before starters Cole Hamels and Marcus Stroman figured things out while going seven innings apiece. Hamels retired 17 of the last 20 men he faced, while Stroman set down 14 straight at one point and 18 of his final 21. The bullpens then took over.\nThe Blue Jays headed right to the airport for the trip to Arlington. Game Three is Sunday night with Game Four Monday if Toronto can last that long. Their only hope is to get back here for Game Five on Wednesday. The Blue Jays haven’t lost three in a row since July 7-9, before their transformation at the trade deadline.\nThis would be incredibly bad timing to do it now.\nemail: mharrington@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:38:00.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
