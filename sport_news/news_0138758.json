It's a feeling that is indescribable, but my favorite part was turning around and watching my teammates finish. \nAmerican Fork won its second straight state title with 41 points, led by a top-five finish from Sara Musselman. The junior finished fifth with a time of 18:11.6, and teammate Sophie Baird was right behind her in sixth at 18:19.4. \nA.F.'s 41 points were 10 better than runner-up Davis, placing each of American Fork's four scoring runners in the top 10. \nWayment had never ran faster than 18:20 on the state course at Sugar House Park prior to Wednesday, but she blew away the time in her senior season. \nThe most important moment in her quest for a state title, though, came before the season began. Her family moved to Kaysville over the summer and she began focusing her time on the distance sport, instead of the much-beloved sport of soccer. \n\"This is my first full season (of cross country) ever, in my lifetime, so it feels pretty dang good,\" Wayment said immediately after crossing the finish line on the track at Highland High School. \"I played soccer before, and the most races I'd do in a season was maybe four. I'd run at region as an individual and go to state. \n\"(Soccer) wasn't going so hot for me, so my dad and I decided the best fit for me would be to move to Davis because I needed more of a team and more of a coach.\" \nCLASS 4A — Provo junior Kate Hunter cruised to the individual title with a time of 18:15.9, 15 seconds ahead of second-place Olivia Hoj of Hunter. \nTimpanogos won the team title with 69 points, placing runners in a 46-second spread from spots eight through 16. Mountain View was second with 88. \nCLASS 3A — Union's Kennedy Powell edged fellow sophomore Zoe Hales of Stansbury, 18:58.4 to 18:59.4 to claim the individual championship. \nDesert Hills' Bailey Brinkerhoff, Park City's Madison Carr and Desert Hills' Lily Poulton also finished in the top five. \n— Millard's Anna Camp finished the course in 18:48.0 to win the individual title, but runner up Sadie Sargent (18:48.2) led North Summit to the team title. \n— Panguitch's Whittni Orton cruised to a winning time of 18:29.1 to win the small school race by more than a minute.
