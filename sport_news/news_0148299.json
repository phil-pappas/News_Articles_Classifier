Caity Sparlin put that theory into motion Wednesday evening. She lined a single to lead off the bottom of the sixth inning and later scored on an infield single by Ashlyn Howell to put the Lady Tigers into the lead. Six defensive outs was now all that stood from Ardmore to advancing to the championship game of the Class 5A Regional Tournament championship game. But a tight strike zone by the home plate umpire led to two, two-out walks and one run by host Duncan in its half of the sixth. And then in the seventh, Maranda Gibson drove in the game-winning run with an infield single, leaving the Lady Tigers on the short end of a 4-3 loss. Ardmore’s effort can’t be questioned, Crawford said. “They played a great game,” she said. “It was a great softball game.” Ardmore fell behind 2-0 in the early stages. Kennedy Stewart lined a single down the left-field line. Then, with Ardmore’s infield pulled in, she stole second and third bases, without a throw. She completed her journey around the base path after the throw on a pickoff attempt from catcher Madisen Moore to Sparlin, the Lady Tigers’ third baseman, sailed into left field, giving Duncan a 1-0 lead. It remained a one-run game until the fourth. KK Williams blasted a solo home run over the left-field wall, for a 2-0 lead. Up to that point, Ardmore hadn’t done much on offense. The Lady Tigers only had two base runners over that span. Ardmore finally made the necessary adjustments in the fifth inning. Haley Long hit an opposite-field double to the right-field wall to drive in the first Lady Tigers’ run of the contest. Later in the inning, she came close to being tagged out at home plate later in the inning, but maneuvered around the tag by Duncan’s catcher, stepped back and touched home plate, tying the score at 2. “She’s had great at-bats so far in practice, just working in the cages and getting things figured out with her swing,” Crawford said. “She made adjustments today at the plate, and that’s what you want to look for as a coach.” In the top of the sixth, Sparlin singled to lead off the frame and scored the go-ahead run on an infield single by Ashlyn Howell, who beat out a throw at first base, for a 3-2 Lady Tigers lead.

'But once they got it figured out, they hit the ball well tonight.” Ardmore pitcher Lexi Duff pitched a masterful game but didn’t get the calls for strikes that she and Crawford thought were strikes — especially in the sixth inning. “I thought they squeezed us a little bit behind the plate,” Crawford said. “I think if we get a couple of those calls it’s a different ball game. I thought Lexi did an awesome job of making adjustments. She threw a great ball game. I couldn’t be more pleased with the way that she threw.” The loss moves Ardmore into an elimination game at noon today against El Reno. If the Lady Tigers win, they must defeat Duncan twice, also today, to qualify for the state tournament. “We’re not done yet,” Crawford said. “We’re going to fight hard and do our best.” Ardmore 4, El Reno 2 Sparlin singled up the middle to tie the score at 2 in the top of the fifth and later scored the game-winning run on a dropped pop fly, as the Lady Tigers rallied from a one-run deficit for a 4-2 win in the tournament opener Wednesday afternoon. Kenysha Noland added an insurance run in the top of the seventh, scoring on a wild pitch, for a two-run Ardmore lead. The play of Ardmore’s defense was one reason the Lady Tigers won. Duff retired the first nine El Reno hitters, the first eight via the fly ball. Lima, the team’s starting center fielder, recorded six putouts. “It doesn’t shock me, because she is so athletic,” Crawford said of Lima. “She’s really come a long ways and is our anchor in the outfield.” El Reno finally got to Duff in the fourth. Tycie Claborn doubled in the first of two runs. Gentry Stevenson later hit a line ball off the leg of Duff. Noland hustled to field the caromed ball but her throw to first base was off-target, and El Reno took a 2-1 lead. Ardmore quickly answered. Sparlin tied the score at 2 with her single. She then made it 3-2 Lady Tigers when she scored on an error.
