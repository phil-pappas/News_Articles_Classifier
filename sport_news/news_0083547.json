Ainslie was knighted by Queen Elizabeth after winning his fourth straight gold medal at the 2012 London Games. “We certainly have great ties with Bermuda with its British heritage. They have been incredibly supportive of us. I think Bermuda is as proud of its British heritage as we are from our side.” \nOracle skipper Jimmy Spithill, who was Ainslie’s boss in the last Cup, thinks otherwise. The syndicate, owned by software billionaire Larry Ellison, relocated from San Francisco to Bermuda in May. \n“Mate, it’s heavily in our favor. We’re always the crowd favorites. We’re the people’s champions. You know why? Because we’re here,” Spithill said in a phone interview. “We’ve got our kids in schools integrating into the community. We get around. We get kids into the base. The locals are behind us. We’re responsible for bringing it here. They’re getting behind us.” \nMoving the America’s Cup out of home waters is just one area where Oracle continues to buck tradition. \nSome in the sailing community were dismayed to see that Oracle’s crew for the Bermuda regatta won’t have a single American-born sailor, although Louis Sinclair has a U.S. passport. Spithill, an Australian, is married to an American and they have a home in San Diego. \nEarlier this month, Ainslie helped elevate the smack talk about the nationality issue. \nWhen Ainslie tweeted about the syndicate’s new boat, an American responded that Oracle was better and faster. \nAinslie responded: “If it’s that fast then you should get some real Americans to sail it for you?” \nAinslie said there are nine British and one New Zealander on Land Rover BAR’s sailing team. \n“It’s up to the teams to decide how far they want to push it,” Ainslie said. “Obviously with our British team, we’re very much about trying to be the best British with our sailing team. … We push the national card very hard whereas some other teams obviously don’t. That’s their choice.” \nSpithill was quick with a retort.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:33:25.415+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
