The Bulldogs cut into A&M's lead, 27-17, on a 5-yard run by Prescott with 12:24 to play. But A&M didn't allow them any closer.\nThe win -- in front of 104,455, many of whom lit up the stadium at one point with twinkling cell phone lights -- is A&M's first at home over a Top 25 team in six tries in coach Kevin Sumlin's three-plus seasons at A&M. Sumlin improved to 9-9 against ranked teams while at A&M. The Aggies went 0-3 in SEC home games last season.\nDespite Prescott passing for 210 yards and rushing for 96, A&M's defense limited the damage, with ends Myles Garrett and Daeshon Hall disrupting MSU.\nThe Bulldogs coughed up two third-quarter fumbles, including one inside A&M's 10, ruining any hopes for a comeback.\nThe first came after a big completion from Prescott to De'Runnya Wilson, with A&M defensive back Donovan Wilson forcing the fumble.\nThe next came with MSU threatening, but Garrett chased down Aeris Williams after he took the pitch from Prescott at A&M's 10 and forced the fumble.\n\"Takeaways change the game,\" said Garrett, who had seven tackles, sacked Prescott by pushing an offensive lineman into him and batted down a pass. \"Once we got those, the game was ours to take.\"\nIn turn, A&M didn't commit a turnover for the second straight week.\nAllen completed 25 of 41 passes for 322 yards and two touchdowns. On the first, he scrambled away from pressure on fourth-and-goal from the 1 in the first quarter and found receiver Ricky Seals-Jones. The second resulted from a 29-yard pass to Damion Ratley later in the first. Allen also rushed 12 times for 65 yards.\nTra Carson rushed 26 times for 110 yards and a touchdown. Josh Reynolds had seven catches for a career-high 141 yards.\nA&M played the second half without Seals-Jones, who was ejected on a targeting call on a block. When asked about the call, Sumlin said he couldn't comment. Seals-Jones retweeted a video of the block in question during the game.\nThe Aggies broke the game open soon after in the second quarter, taking a 24-10 lead into halftime. They moved 64 yards in 54 seconds, capped with a one-yard run by Carson.\nTaylor Bertolet added three field goals, two of which provided A&M's only points in the second half. He hit a career-best 55-yarder in the second quarter.\nA&M's defense limited MSU to two touchdowns, though one featured a 52-yard run by Malik Dear in the second quarter.\n\"To get to where we are right now ... and getting to a bye week, it's important,\" Sumlin said. \"Physically we can get some people back. ...The bye week is about getting our energy back, healing up physically, but also mentally.\n\"I think we can play better. That's going to be our challenge. We're going to face some teams that are going to challenge us. If we can just get a little better every week, then we've got a real chance.\"\nTwitter: @khairopoulos\nStreak over Entering Saturday, coach Kevin Sumlin's Aggies were 0-5 at home against ranked teams:\nOpponent Year Rank Result Florida 2012 24 L, 20-17 LSU 2012 6 L, 24-19 Alabama 2013 1 L, 49-42 Auburn 2013 24 L, 45-41 Ole Miss 2014 3 L, 35-20 Texas A&M 30, Mississippi State 17: Complete coverage\n√Ç\nClick here to visit the Texas A&M Aggies page\nHairopoulos: Sumlin breaks through vs. Top-25 team at home; A&M has bye to prepare for Bama\nTexas A&M quotable: Sumlin impressed with play of defensive ends; 'will address' Seals-Jones tweets during game\nTexas A&M quick hits: Seals-Jones catches 1st TD pass of season, gets ejected for targeting\nFive thoughts: No. 14 Texas A&M improves to 5-0 despite slow second half offensively\nPhotos: Kyle Allen, ground game carry A&M past Mississippi State 30-17\nKate Hairopoulos answers Texas A&M/SEC questions at 3 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 7; ask yours now\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/texas-quotable-sumlin-impressed-play-defensive-ends-will-address-seals-jones-tweets-game", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/hairopoulos-sumlin-breaks-vs-top-25-team-home-bye-prepare-bama", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-aggies", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-14-texas-improves-5-0-despite-slow-second-half-offensively-defeat-21-mississippi-state-30-17", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/texas-quick-hits-seals-jones-catches-1st-td-pass-season-gets-ejected-targeting", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/chats/2015/09/30/kate-hairopoulos-answers-texas-amsec-questions-3-pm-wednesday-oct-7-ask-now"], "published": "2015-10-04T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:50:39.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
