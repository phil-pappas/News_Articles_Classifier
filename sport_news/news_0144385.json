Delino DeShields beats out a grounder to short to put @Rangers up, 6-4. pic.twitter.com/jPYLyT1kVT — @BBTN \nDeShields, the rookie centre-fielder and 23-year-old son of the former Montreal Expo, is 5-for-11 in the series, having passed his father in career post-season hits. The elder DeShields went 3-for-16 in the National League Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers in 1995 and '96. \nJunior also has three runs scored, two runs batted in and a stolen base versus Toronto. He is also 1-for-1 with two walks against Marco Estrada, the Jays' scheduled starter for Sunday's Game 3 in Texas at 8 p.m. ET. \nHe's outperforming six-year major leaguer Ben Revere, who is 3-for-10 with a run and RBI atop the Blue Jays lineup in the best-of-five series. Revere, who overcame a 0-for-13 slide following a July 31 trade from Philadelphia to post a .317 batting average and .348 on-base percentage in the second half, should have walked in his final two at-bats of Friday's 6-4 Game 2 loss in 14 innings but chased pitches out of the strike zone that turned into outs. \nOdor, 21, batted .261 with 16 homers in the regular season. While the five-foot-11, 170-pound Venezuelan is only 2-for-7 in the series, he has scored five times, including twice on hit-by-pitches and his solo home run off Blue Jays ace David Price in the seventh inning of Game 1 extended Texas' lead to 5-3. \nHe's also been a terror on the basepaths. In the second inning on Friday, Odor ran from first to third base on a chopper over the mound to Toronto pitcher Marcus Stroman by No. 8 hitter Chris Gimenez with third baseman Josh Donaldson out of position. According to Statcast, Odor reached a top speed of 28.6 kilometres per hour (17.8 miles per hour) as he approached second but ramped it up to 31.7 km/h (19.7 mph) heading to third. \nLater, on a sacrfice fly by the ninth hitter, Hanser Alberto, Odor ran 32.8 km/h (20.4 mph) before avoiding Martin's tag with a head-first slide to score. — @MLB \nIn the top of the 14th inning, Odor reached base on a grounder to shortstop. He then found himself in the path of controversy when he rounded second base and turned too aggressively for third on a Gimenez single. He appeared to take his foot off the bag but after video review the on-field safe call stood, leaving Odor in position to score on Alberto's single to centre. \nMeanwhile, the Jays' 7-8-9 hitters of Martin, Pillar and Goins went a combined 2-for-15 with 6 strikeouts after going 2-for-10 with an RBI and strikeout in Game 1.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:06:29.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
