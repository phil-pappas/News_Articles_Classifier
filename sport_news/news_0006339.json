In four games last season with the New York Jets, he had eight kick returns for 233 yards for a 29.1-yard average. That includes a long of 62 yards. He also returned 12 punts for 48 yards. \nDuring the preseason, Powell had a 54-yard punt return for a touchdown in a win over the New York Giants. He was one of the Jets' final cuts but returned to the team on the practice squad. He was later released when the Jets signed former Raiders receiver Kenbrell Thompkins, and Powell then signed with the Bills practice squad. \nPowell was a sixth-round pick in 2014 by the Arizona Cardinals out of Murray State, where he was a two-time All-American and had three career punt returns and one kickoff return for a touchdown. \nThe Raiders created roster space on Thursday when they waived safety Keenan Lambert. On Saturday, Lambert rejoined the team as a practice squad member. They will have another open spot when defensive end Justin Tuck is formally placed on injured reserve. Patriots: Cornerback Tarell Brown was placed on season-ending injured reserve because of a foot injury. Brown started the first two games of the season and played in three of the first four, making 14 tackles. He signed with New England in July after spending last season with the Raiders. He also played seven seasons for the 49ers. Advertisement The Patriots signed offensive lineman Cameron Fleming from the practice squad. Fleming, a fourth-round pick out of Stanford last year, was released Sept. 6 and signed to the practice squad two days later. He appeared in seven regular-season games last year and also played in two postseason games, including the Super Bowl. Washington: Receiver DeSean Jackson will not play against the New York Jets because of a left hamstring injury. Washington initially had indicated there was a chance that Jackson might be able to play, but it announced Saturday that he didn't travel with the team. Jackson hurt his hamstring during Washington's first game this season. \nGiants: Receiver Odell Beckham Jr. was listed as questionable for Monday night's game against the Philadelphia Eagles. The Giants remained hopeful that Beckham, who has been sidelined for a week with a hamstring injury, will be able to participate in Sunday's final practice before traveling to Philadelphia.
