Clinging to a one-point lead late in the fourth quarter, Dayton's Sean Smith unleashed a 74-yard punt which was downed at the San Diego 5. The Toreros (3-2, 2-1 Pioneer League) used an 11-play, 67-yard drive to move to the 28 but linebackers Beaschler and Crain crashed through the middle of the line for the stop on fourth down. San Diego kicker Jack Flatau had made field goals of 49 and 32 yards. Dayton (5-0, 2-0) was without Connor Kacsor - who came into the game leading the FCS in rushing (151.5 yards per game). The Flyers had just 57 total yards and trailed 9-3 at halftime. The Flyers racked up 173 yards in the third, including a 55-yard touchdown pass from Alex Jeske to Tucker Yinger that gave Dayton the lead for good.
