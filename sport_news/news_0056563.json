He might want to be more solid in midfield so you don't concede goals, so we'll just see what happens. \n\"But at the age of 33, you want to play football. I didn't come here to sit on the bench. You want to play football and score goals. I said that from day one.\" \nThat said, Defoe is not looking for an escape route from the Stadium of Light as the January transfer window looms on the horizon. \nHe said: \"I don't think like that, I don't sit there and think, 'Well, come January I'm going to go'. \n\"I've just got to focus on the games, stay positive and, if I play then, I've got to do my best, work hard and hopefully score. \n\"The manager knows. I'm 33, I want to play games. If you speak to any of the boys, everyone wants to play. Yeah, the manager picks the team - you've got to respect that - but at the same time, it doesn't mean you have to be happy about it.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T12:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:16:09.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
