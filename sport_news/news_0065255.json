The world No. 1 was in devastating form, conceding just three aces in a masterclass performance to reach the semifinals in Beijing. The Serbian is chasing his sixth title in Beijing and his seventh this year, which already includes the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open championships. His next opponent is Spain’s David Ferrer, who won the Malaysian Open last week. Ferrer eased into the semifinals with a 6-3 6-1 victory over Taiwan’s Lu Yen-hsun. Rafa Nadal had a much harder time in his quarterfinal with American Jack Sock, before prevailing 3-6 6-4 6-3. The Spaniard is still struggling to get back to his best but said he was pleased with the way he fought back. Nadal will face Fabio Fognini in the semifinals after the Italian beat Pablo Cuevas 6-1 2-6 6-2. Nadal has lost three of his last four matches against Fognini, including at the US Open when he blew a two-set lead in the third round. In the women’s draw, Wimbledon finalist Garbine Muguruza beat Bethanie Mattek-Sands of the U.S. 6-1 7-5 to ease into the semifinals, joining Ana Ivanovic, Agnieszka Radwanska and Timea Bacsinszky. Wawrinka, Nishikori through in Japan semis Tokyo: French Open champion Stan Wawrinka sailed into the semifinals of the Japan Open on Friday with a 6-3 6-4 win over American Austin Krajicek. Wawrinka, who has already won three titles this year including his second Grand Slam in Paris, needed just 50 minutes to beat Krajicek. The Swiss will play Luxembourg’s Gilles Muller on Saturday. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:18:42.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
