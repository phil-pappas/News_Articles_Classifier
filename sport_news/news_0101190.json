Opening night is here. The UMass Lowell River Hawks are set to open their 49th season of college hockey on Friday, October 9. UMass Lowell will face the Rensselaer Engineers in a varsity hockey matchup at the Tsongas Center in Lowell, Massachusetts. Puck drops at 7:15 p.m. eastern. \nEntering the season, UMass Lowell was selected at No. 4 in the Hockey East preseason coaches poll and sit at No. 14 in the USCHO.com and USA Today polls. The River Hawks have been nationally ranked for 67 consecutive weeks. \nThe River Hawks took the ice for the first time as a team in game competition last weekend when they defeated the University of New Brunswick Varsity Reds , 3-2. It was a great time to work out the kinks and get things ready for the start of the season. \n“It was a good start,” said UMass Lowell head coach Norm Bazin . “We got to play a lot of different players and there was several contributions from some of those players.” \nThe River Hawks will face R.P.I. for the first time since December 29, 2011 when UMass Lowell defeated the Engineers, 7-2. The River Hawks own a 11-10-1 overall record against R.P.I. and are 6-4 over their last 10 meetings. UMass Lowell is 5-3-1 at home against R.P.I. and 3-1-0 at the Tsongas Center. \nUMass Lowell is 25-19-4 in season opening contests and 28-17-3 in home openers. It is the third time that UMass Lowell and R.P.I. have faced each other to open the season. The two teams battled to a 4-4 tie, at the Tully Forum, in 1988. The River Hawks opened the 1995-96 season with a 5-3 win, at the Houston Field House, in Troy, New York. \nWith a win on Friday, Bazin will secure his 100th win on the bench of UMass Lowell. He will become the third coach in the program’s 49 year history and the fastest to reach that milestone. His record of 99-47-13, in a four year period (2011-15,) places Bazin in a third place tie with Bruce Crowder (1991-96, 99-75-19) and the UMass Lowell all-time win list. Billy Riley tops the all-time win list with 363 wins (363-270-22). \nBe sure to checkout our Hockey East weekly predictions for our best guess on who picks up wins this weekend.
