If that was indeed the case, the refs may have wanted to stop this lopsided bout between the Indians and the Scarlet Knights at halftime.\nAfter landing one blistering haymaker after another, the Indians were up five touchdowns at the break, en route to a 42-13 win.\nBillerica quarterback Justin Beck (5-for-10, 153 yards, 3 TDs) led a 29-point second quarter that left the visitors sitting pretty at 5-0 and the Scarlet Knights (3-2) dazed and confused.\n“The guys worked extremely hard and they don’t want to be known as a doormat,” Sigsbury said. “They want to be known as a good football team that is trying to become a great football team, and they came out tonight and there was never any doubt from the first series on.”\nLeading 6-0 after one quarter, Billerica opened the floodgates in the second. On the Indians’ first possession, Beck found Dean Brooks at midfield and when the Knights defender lost his footing, the tight end headed 76 yards to the end zone.\n“It was a huge statement game and we were a little nervous coming in,” said Beck, who also rushed for 58 yards. “We prepared hard all week and got it done.”\nSenior captain Drew Laundry (56 yards rushing) careened through a gaping hole for a 29-yard score on the next series to make it 21-0 midway through the second.\nThe Billerica defense went for the kill shot two plays later as Scott Murphy drilled North Andover quarterback Seamus Lambert, jarring the ball free and into the waiting hands of teammate Bob Christopher. Two plays later, Beck found Jeff Trainor from 19 yards out for his third TD strike of the half and the rout was on.\n“The kids knew what was on the line,” Sigsbury said. “Every game in the Merrimack Valley is a championship game. It’s not like in some other leagues where you may get a couple weeks off. That’s not a knock on anyone else, but a tribute to all the coaches and athletes in our league.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:48:42.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
