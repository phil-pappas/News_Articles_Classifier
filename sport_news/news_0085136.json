It was just… I wasn’t on my game.”\n“I had a hard time adjusting. It was a lot different than the D-League and I couldn’t find my rhythm, I couldn’t find my groove. I struggled everywhere on the floor, and I didn’t feel like myself,’ he said.\nTautuaa, who made electrifying moves during his brief stint with Gilas Pilipinas recently, admits he is still groping for the right form.\n“It was a different atmosphere to play in, and adjusting to how the play is here, and that’s how I felt that got me off my groove. For myself, I did feel a little pressure. But the older guys they talked to me and told me I shouldn’t and they just told me to play my game. Today that didn’t come,” he added.\nRosario, the No. 2 pick originally by Mahindra but was obtained in a preseason trade, had a similarly unimpressive debut with just four points and three rebounds in more than 15 minutes of play.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:30:53.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
