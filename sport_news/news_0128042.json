He's playing hard. He's making great reads. He's leading the entire county in rushing. I think he's well over 700 tough yards rushing. He's really done a great job.\" \nWhile Auburn's offense has sputtered, Barrett remains firm in his commitment, according to Head. Gus Malzahn's offense has flourished with better runners, and the 6-foot-2, 225-pound Barrett has shown the ability to be a true dual-threat quarterback. \n\"He's tons, light years better as a passer,\" Head said. \"He's dissecting defenses and really making reads. He's really doing a great job.\" \nBarrett plans on graduating from high school early to enroll at Auburn in January 2016. Auburn coaches feel he can challenge for early playing time. \n\"That's what they're saying and that's what they're telling me,\" Head said. \"That's what I'm seeing.\" \nBarrett did make the short trip to Gainesville to watch Florida's 38-10 win over Ole Miss, but told 247Sports that it was more of a trip just to hang out. Florida has not extended an offer. \nIn fact, other schools haven't been in much contact, according to Head. \n\"Not at all, but I haven't really been allowing much of that right now,\" Head said. \"Until he tells me he's not strong with (his commitment), we'll just keep it all in house right now.\" \nBarrett visited Auburn over the summer and Head said he's hoping to make it for a game, but it's around a six or seven-hour drive from Winter Garden, Fla., to Auburn.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T18:22:16.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
