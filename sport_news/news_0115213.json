REUTERS/Marcelo del Pozo \nSAO PAOLO, Oct 16 — Brazilian club Santos demanded a six-month suspension for superstar striker Neymar yesterday, claiming he breached transfer conditions when he moved to Barcelona in 2013. \nGloboEsporte also reported that Santos are seeking €57 million (RM 266.522 million) in compensation from the 23-year-old Brazilian. \n“The player should be punished with a suspension of six months from any official match,” Santos demanded in their request to FIFA, the website reported. \nThe player should also “forfeit all benefits, directly or indirectly, received as part of the transfer”. \nGloboEsporte added that Santos are claiming Neymar “acted in bad faith” and violated the disciplinary code of world governing body FIFA when he moved to Spain. \nBrazil captain Neymar has been embroiled in controversy in recent weeks. \nIn September, a Brazilian court froze US$47 million (RM193.172 million) in assets belonging to the player over tax evasion allegations. \nOn the pitch, he was suspended for this week’s World Cup qualifiers against Chile and Venezuela after being given a four-match ban for being sent off at this year’s Copa America tournament. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:23:56.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
