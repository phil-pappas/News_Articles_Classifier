The Middleboro High football team received high praise through the first five weeks of the regular season, blowing out opponents on a regular basis, but after Scituate steamrolled the Sachems, 34-13, last week, they have done a free fall out of the state’s Top 25 polls. Middleboro (5-1) doesn’t mind being off the radar, though, as its heads into Friday night’s tilt versus Hanover (5-1) at 7 at Battis Field with a chance to grab a share of the Patriot League Fisher Division title. “The focus around here is probably as high as it has been in a long time, probably about six or seven weeks,” said Middleboro head coach Pat Kingman. “That focus you don’t notice when you’re winning football games and then you get kicked in the teeth a little bit and you realize, ‘Hey, maybe we’re missing something.’ I think our kids have bounced back pretty well.” For the Sachems, after suffering their first regular-season loss since Nov. 8, 2013, it will not be easy getting back into the win column. The Indians boast a prolific offense averaging 37 points per game. Senior quarterback Joe Byrne isn’t afraid to sling it and has a tremendous asset in senior wide receiver Colin Boutin. In the backfield, Hanover goes to a pair of backs in senior Dimitry LaForest and junior Brad Rogers, who has found the end zone eight times this season. Middleboro’s defense will need to find a way to slow down the Indians’ attack if it want to avoid a repeat of last Friday night. “We need to find a way to make some stops,” Kingman said, “and get our playmakers back on the field on offense.” Those playmakers Kingman eluded to are senior quarterback Brendan Chipman, who is third in Division 4 in touchdown passes with nine and senior running back Eddy Hart, who has the ability for the home run play at any time. With Chipman and Hart leading the motivated Sachems, it might not be long until Middleboro is on the radar screen again and everyone is trying to get back their seat on the bandwagon. “If we’re off people’s radar, maybe that’s a good thing because they’re not going to take us as a legit team, then they’re going to find out and I’ve said this, we’re a pretty good football team,” Kingman said. “Even good football teams have bad nights. We’ll find a way to make sure we’re ready to roll on Friday night.” Page 2 of 3 - FRIDAY Bishop Fenwick (6-0) at Cardinal Spellman (6-0), 6:30 p.m.: Many league titles are up for grabs this week and it starts here. The Cardinals’ offense is on a roll and I don’t see how the Crusaders can outscore them for the Catholic Central League championship. THE PICK: Cardinal Spellman 35, Bishop Fenwick 30 Abington (5-1) at Rockland (3-3), 7: The Green Wave are battled tested and have the experience to get a key South Shore League win on the road, while the Bulldogs need a victory to secure a playoff spot. THE PICK: Abington 27, Rockland 20 Brockton (4-2) at New Bedford (3-3), 7: The Big Three title is on the line and the Boxers look like they finally found their offense, scoring 48 points last week. THE PICK: Brockton 31, New Bedford 24 Norwell (3-2) at East Bridgewater (6-0), 7: The Vikings should cruise to another win, but most importantly, they are healthy and hitting their stride at the right time. THE PICK: East Bridgewater 42, Norwell 15 Foxboro (5-1) at Oliver Ames (0-6), 7: The Warriors fell from the ranks of the unbeatens last week, and will look to take their aggression out on the Tigers. THE PICK: Foxboro 37, Oliver Ames 14 Hingham (2-4) at Whitman-Hanson (3-3), 7: The Panthers have put scares into Duxbury and Plymouth North, and look to put what they have learned from those experiences to good use against the Harbormen. A win could lock up a second straight trip to the playoffs for the Panthers. THE PICK: Whitman-Hanson 34, Hingham 26 Hanover (5-1) at Middleboro (5-1), 7: I’m staying on the bandwagon as of now, but this game will tell us a lot about the Sachems. Either they will be recognized as contenders in Division 4 South or pretenders based on the outcome. THE PICK: Middleboro 27, Hanover 23 SATURDAY Holbrook/Avon (0-5) at Sacred Heart (0-5), 12: This one should come down to the wire as one team will walk away with its first win of the season. THE PICK: Holbrook/Avon 22, Sacred Heart 21 Bridgewater-Raynham (3-3) at St. John’s Prep (6-0), 12: The Trojans dominated league play once again, but it’s back to the grind of facing non-league competition and right now, nobody may be playing better than quarterback Ollie Eberth and the Eagles. THE PICK: St. John’s Prep 33, Bridgewater-Raynham 23 Southeastern (1-5) at Tri-County (1-5), 1: The Hawks need to turn it around after two straight losses and seem poised to do so. THE PICK: Southeastern 26, Tri-County 22 West Bridgewater (5-1) at Old Colony (3-3), 1: The Wildcats suffered their first loss last week, but it shouldn’t derail their season. A win on Saturday could get them back on the track in time for the playoffs. Page 3 of 3 - THE PICK: West Bridgewater 27, Old Colony 13 Stoughton (3-3) at Milford (3-3), 1:30: The Black Knights’ defense pitched a shutout last week and it wouldn’t surprise me if they did so again this week as they make a push toward the playoffs. THE PICK: Stoughton 20, Milford 7 Last Week: 10-3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:41:53.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
