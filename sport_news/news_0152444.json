Federal officials confirmed that he was armed with a variation of an AR-15, but he used a single handgun.\nHarper-Mercer was enrolled in the class where the shooting occurred, the Douglas County Sheriff's Office said.\nAmong the nine people who died, most were fellow students. Three were age 18. One was a teacher, Lawrence Levine of Glide, 67, sheriff's officials confirmed. They also revised the number of wounded from seven to nine people.\nThe pain hit close to home, said Douglas County Fire Chief Greg Marlar of Fire District 2. Among the dead were Treven Anspach, 20, of Sutherlin, son of a local firefighter, and Rebecca Carnes, 18, of Myrtle Creek, a niece of a local paramedic, Marlar said.\n\"The situation is personal to us, and we share in the pain everyone is feeling right now,'' he said. His firefighters were the first on the scene.\nMark Graves | The Oregonian/OregonLive At the shooter's Winchester residence, authorities recovered seven more firearms and additional ammunition, said Celinez Nunez, U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and Explosives assistant special agent in charge.\nAll 13 weapons were traced to federal firearms dealers. The gunman or his family members bought seven of the guns within the past three years, Nunez said. A 14 th weapon had been traded back to the place where he bought it, she said.\n\"They were all purchased legally,'' Nunez said.\nDouglas County Sheriff John Hanlin continued to avoid using the name of the shooter. He died after an exchange of gunfire with two members of the Roseburg Police Department. It's still not clear if he was hit by a police officer's bullet or turned his gun on himself.\n\"Again, you will not hear anyone from this law enforcement operation use his name,'' Hanlin said. \"I continue to believe that those media and community members who publicize his name will only glorify his horrific actions and eventually this will only serve to inspire future acts.''\nHanlin wouldn't confirm if any notes were recovered from the shooter or discuss a motive in the killings. Asked by a reporter if Hanlin could identify a photo of the gunman shown on a cellphone, the sheriff said no.\nAsked during a news conference if the number of weapons recovered from the shooter was unusual, the sheriff said, \"In Oregon, this is a hunting state and firearms are popular.''\nCars on campus Anyone who has a car parked on the campus are asked to meet at the Douglas County Fairgrounds at 3 p.m. Friday to take buses back to the campus to retrieve them. The sheriff said deputies were assigned to families of the shooter's victims. \"These families are living through the nightmare in the most personal way possible,'' Hanlin said.\nJanet Holland, executive director of the Community Health Alliance, said the agency's offices will be open through the weekend from 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. to allow anyone to come in for counseling.\nHolland's son is a student at the college and was there Thursday. When he came home, she said, there were \"lots of hugs\" and she \"let him talk about his experiences,'' which she encourages parents to do.\nRoseburg City Manager Lance Colley called the shooting \"something that we never hoped would happen anywhere, much less our community'' and thanked people from across the nation and beyond for their help and condolences.\n\"Support the families, certainly support the college, and help us all move forward,'' Colley said. \"Keep the families in your prayers.''\nThe Umpqua Community College campus will reopen Monday, but classes will be canceled through Friday, Oct. 9.\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212; @maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://blog.advance.net/cgi-bin/mte/%22mailto:mberstein@oregonian.com", "https://blog.advance.net/cgi-bin/mte/%22https://twitter.com/maxoregonian"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:39:08.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
