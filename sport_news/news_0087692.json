She said she is well aware these topics can make some audience members uncomfortable, so she is quick to find funny ways to let them off the hook.\n“You have to combine sensibilities into it,” she said. “I’m safe and compassionate and trying to empower people with comedy.”\nCho’s calling came early, who said she was bullied as a child for looking different and found refuge among jokes.\nWhen she started performing at small clubs in San Francisco as a teen, she didn’t hold back – one of the first jokes she remembers telling that had the audience laughing was about her heritage and stereotypes.\n“At that time, in the ‘80s, comics were making fun of Asian drivers, that was the big joke,” she said, laughing. “So when I got onstage at 15, I said ‘My name is Margaret Cho and I drive very well.’”\nIn 1994, ABC debuted the sitcom “All-American Girl,” starring Cho and a predominantly Asian American cast; a television moment that many people viewed as a cultural milestone. The show, which was based on her stand-up routines, was panned by critics and canceled after one season. Cho has been public about her ensuing depression and drug addiction following the sitcom’s demise.\nOver the years Cho went on to appear on numerous television shows, including a recent stint as a guest host on E!’s “Fashion Police,” where she added her comedic input on red carpet fashion at the MTV Video Music Awards. She has also been featured in movies and several stand-up specials.\nA taping from her current tour debuted on Showtime last month.\nShe said although her set changes up from city to city, she won’t shy away from discussing “deep truths” at each stop.\n“Performing is a living breathing art form,” she said. “Every city is different and every club is different.”\nWhen it comes to being heckled, she said she becomes “Cho-bi-Wan Kenobi.”\n“You have to be like a Jedi with hecklers,” she said.\nAfter her shows she said audience members come up to her and thank her for being blunt and many times share personal stories of similar experiences, which she said is really beautiful and sad.\n“Performing is like my religion, it is my spiritual practice,” Cho said. “If you mix highbrow with lowbrow comedy then you get the breadth of a genius.”\nContact the writer: sschulte@pe.com , 951-368-9457", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwl13p-b88541516z.120151021110728000g83cm8dn.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwl13o-b88541516z.120151021110728000g83cm8di.10.jpg", "http://www.riversidelive.com/", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwl13o-b88541516z.120151021110728000g83cm8dg.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwl13o-b88541516z.120151021110728000g83cm8dg.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwl13p-b88541516z.120151021110728000g83cm8dn.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwl13o-b88541516z.120151021110728000g83cm8di.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:13:01.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
