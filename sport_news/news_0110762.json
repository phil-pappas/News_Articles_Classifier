In Eastern Washington's 43-41 escape from Northern Colorado, the junior had 20 receptions and 275 yards - both school records - and caught three touchdowns to become the Big Sky's all-time leader in receptions (281) and receiving yards (4,338). He already was the conference's all-time leader in touchdown receptions, and in stretching the total to 52, surpassed three players - including Jerry Rice - to move into a tie for second place in FCS history. Kupp is six TD receptions shy of the record 58 caught by New Hampshire's David Ball from 2003-06. Kupp's career exploits have come in only 35 games. \nHonorable Mention: Chase Edmonds, RB, Fordham; Blake Veasley, RB, Central Arkansas \n---= \nDEFENSIVE PLAYER OF THE WEEK= \nJohn Hugunin, Drake, LB, R-Sr., 5-11, 232, Oswego, Illinois \nJacksonville fell from the ranks of the unbeaten after Hugunin led the way in Drake's 28-24 victory in the Pioneer Football League. He recorded a career-high 20 tackles, 10 solo, with 1 1/2 sacks and forced two fumbles. One of the fumbles set up the Bulldogs ' winning touchdown drive in the fourth quarter, and the other came off one of his sacks. Hugunin, who led the PFL in tackles in 2013, has 77 stops this season, giving him 378 in his career to rank No. 1 all-time at Drake and third in league history. \nHonorable Mention: Jevon Elmore, CB, Central Connecticut State; Matt Satchell, LB, Georgetown; Myke Tavarres, LB, Incarnate Word \n---= \nSPECIAL TEAMS PLAYER OF THE WEEK= \nTevin Richard, South Carolina State, LB, R-Sr., 6-0, 200, Georgetown, South Carolina \nDelaware State saw right away what Richard was headed toward when he was in on the tackle on the opening kickoff of South Carolina State's 34-7 MEAC win. When the Hornets tried to punt to end their opening drive, Richard scooped up the punter's fumble and ran in a 10-yard touchdown. He then partially blocked the punt on DSU's second possession, setting up another South Carolina State touchdown. He recovered a fumble in the second quarter to set up another TD and blocked a punt deep in DSU territory to set up yet another touchdown early in the fourth. He finished with five tackles and one pass breakup in addition to the two blocked punts and two fumble recoveries. \nHonorable Mention: Nick Dorka, PK, William & Mary; Willie Quinn, WR/RS, Southern \n---= \nFRESHMAN PLAYER OF THE WEEK= \nJethro Francois, Georgetown, S, Fr., 6-1, 185, Miami \nGeorgetown spoiled Bucknell's homecoming with a strong defensive effort in a 17-9 Patriot League victory. Francois racked up 15 tackles, including a Hoyas freshman-record 11 solo stops, as well as the first 1 1/2 tackles for loss and half-sack of his career. Francois' half-sack - linebacker Matt Satchell got the other half - stopped a fourth-quarter drive on fourth down with the Bison in the red zone. The Hoyas have a 4-4 record, surpassing last year's three- win total, and have held all three league opponents scoreless in the second half. \nHonorable Mention: Case Cookus, QB, Northern Arizona; Thomas Jefferson, RB, Delaware; Easton Stick, QB, North Dakota State 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:14:52.564+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
