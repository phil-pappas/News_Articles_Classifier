Very disappointed that there won't be the Dudleyz included anywhere # 3 molendie @ 10/07/15 07:57 AM I'm assuming that the Bushwhackers, Natural Disasters, and Scott Hall will be playable elsewhere since they are playable in showcase matches? # 4 vtcrb @ 10/07/15 08:02 AM Samoa Joe is in, all i needed to hear. # 5 Pezell04x @ 10/07/15 08:05 AM I find this to be one of the best season passes the WWE series ever put out. A ton of content. # 6 cjallure24 @ 10/07/15 08:32 AM Quote: Originally Posted by molendie I'm assuming that the Bushwhackers, Natural Disasters, and Scott Hall will be playable elsewhere since they are playable in showcase matches? If like past versions, they should be. Sent from my SM-N900T using Tapatalk # 7 Pappy Knuckles @ 10/07/15 08:50 AM Looks like I'll be getting the accelerator and hall of fame pack. I've gotta rock with Arn Anderson. Sent from my SCH-S960L using Tapatalk # 8 Pappy Knuckles @ 10/07/15 08:51 AM Hold up, is he not available to use outside of the showcase?

Sent from my SCH-S960L using Tapatalk In last year's game, the wrestlers in the DLC showcases were available in the other modes once you played through their matches in the showcase, or if you used the accelerator to unlock everything (which is what I did, because I'm sick of the showcase stuff). Can't imagine this year being any different. # 10 DBMcGee3 @ 10/07/15 09:16 AM I thought they said there would be about 30 additional wrestlers added. Assuming all the previously unmentioned guys in the Hall of Fame showcase will be playable, I'm still not counting 30. That being said, man they've really added some great legends. Double A baby, Double A! # 11 Cowboy008 @ 10/07/15 09:26 AM This is great news. I'm surprised they were able to get Samoa Joe in the game. I'm hoping the wrestlers that are in the Hall of Fame showcase will be playable in other modes like Universe. Just to make sure we get everything in that trailer if we get the season pass right? # 12 Junior Moe @ 10/07/15 09:50 AM I'm gonna jump on this, too. Double A, Harlem Heat and The Outsiders will be nice. The Bushwackers will help make the tag team division in Universe super competitive. I don't purchase wrestling often and with these additions and the CAPS for the rest I think I'll be set for a while on the wrestling front. Man I wish Hogan hadn't gotten caught up with those comments he made. This game will have virtually every past and present wrestler I enjoyed. At least he's easy enough to make... # 13 willz1985 @ 10/07/15 10:15 AM Still no Psycho Sid/Sid Vicious then # 14 wiscowilz @ 10/07/15 10:16 AM Trish, Lita, Alundra Blayze, Harlem Heat, Samoa Joe, AA, Mr. Perfect, Dusty Rhodes...damn, this DLC this year is awesome Quote: Originally Posted by Aggies7 Love the Bushwhackers and Naturals Disasters being included.

Double A baby, Double A! I agree, I'm only counting 21 new. Even if you count the duplicates (which shouldn't be as they aren't different personas) it's still not adding up to 30. Also just realized that the MyPlayer Kickstart is NOT part of the Season Pass which would cost an extra $9.99. # 15 cjallure24 @ 10/07/15 10:33 AM Damn it, no PC season pass. No Owen Hart either. The Tag Team's are stacked as well. Should be more than enough to use on two shows in universe mode.
