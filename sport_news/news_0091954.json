Rhoads announced Monday Mangino is out as ISU offensive coordinator. Here is head coach Paul Rhoads' opening statement at today's @CycloneFB media conference, announcing a change at OC https://t.co/2NGDLxaMHk October 26, 2015 | 12:12 pm \nIowa State head coach Paul Rhoads announced a change at offensive coordinator Monday. \nMark Mangino, who arrived in Ames last fall, is no longer with the Cyclones. Quarterbacks coach Todd Sturdy, in his fourth year with the Cyclones after serving as Washington State offensive coordinator from 2008-11, will take over. \nRhoads said he and Mangino were not seeing eye to eye. \n“Mark and I could not get on the same page on a few important items,” Rhoads said. “We tried to talk that through this morning in an effort to get us moving in a different direction. In the end, Mark was not interested in that. I wish that wasn't the case. But I respect and understand his conviction. \n“I'd like to thank Mark for all that he's done for our football program and wish him well.” \nMangino was the head coach at Kansas from 2002-09 and assisted at Youngstown State in 2013 before coming to Iowa State. \nThe move comes the same day sophomore Joel Lanning replaced senior Sam Richardson as the starting quarterback on the ISU depth chart, though Rhoads claimed the decisions were unrelated. \nMangino's son, Tommy, will stay on as wide receivers coach. \nRhoads said he had not broke the news to his team, wanting to tell them in person at a 1:30 p.m. meeting. \nThat resulted in several players discovering the news as it broke on Twitter at the same time as fans.
