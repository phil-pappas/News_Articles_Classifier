The Detroit Lions scored touchdowns on their first two drives without much resistance to jump out to an 11-point lead.\nAnd the home team led, 17-6, as time ticked down late in the second quarter. But in the final two minutes before halftime, the Vikings pulled within two points to 17-15 after quarterback Teddy Bridgewater’s one-yard touchdown pass to tight end Kyle Rudolph and kicker Blair Walsh’s 51-yard field goal as time expired.\nThe Vikings kept it going, scoring 22 straight points to run away with a 28-19 win over the Lions. It was their first road win of the season and their first against an NFC North rival since a win over the Lions at Ford Field during the 2012 season.\nOn the opening drive of the second half, the Vikings took their first lead, 22-17, when rookie wide receiver Stefon Diggs scored the first touchdown of his career.\nDiggs dusted veteran Lions cornerback Rashean Mathis with a double move then laid out to make a highlight-reel 36-yard touchdown catch in the end zone. The Vikings, whose offense stalled in the red zone all afternoon, then kicked a pair of field goals to take a commanding 28-17 lead early in the fourth quarter.\nBridgewater completed 25 for 35 attempts against the toothless Lions defense for a season-high 316 yards. His two touchdown passes tied a career high.\nLions quarterback Matthew Stafford got off to a hot start by completing all six of his first-quarter attempts for 119 yards and two touchdowns. But the Vikings defense regrouped.\nDetroit’s only points the rest of the game came on a field goal after the Lions pounced on a botched handoff in Vikings territory in the second quarter and on a late safety, one the Vikings intentionally took instead of attempting a punt deep in their end zone.\nJust like they did at TCF Bank Stadium in Week 2, the Vikings hammered Stafford repeatedly, finishing with seven sacks and 14 quarterback hits. Middle linebacker Eric Kendricks had two sacks and defensive end Everson Griffen had one and a half.\nThe Vikings will hit the road again next weekend to play the Bears in Chicago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:44:54.761+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
