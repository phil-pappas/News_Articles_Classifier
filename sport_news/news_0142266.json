With a view to launching a sustained nationwide campaign, the Congress has on Wednesday called a meeting of all its state party presidents who will be asked to go back and run a counter-campaign to blunt the government’s charge. Party sources said the meeting was being called to plan a “major campaign and celebration in the wake of Nehru’s 126th birth anniversary this November 14”. “The celebrations will be an extension of the Congress’ 125th anniversary celebrations of Nehru which we had marked with revelry last year. The plan for this year won’t be any less,” a leader said. Invites have gone out not just to state party chiefs but also to all party general secretaries and in charges of states. Leaders said Congress president Sonia Gandhi was unlikely to be present and the meeting would be held at the level of other senior party leaders. On if the meeting would dwell on strategies to counter BJP’s moves to undermine the Nehruvian legacy, a party strategist said: “That will very much be part of the agenda. We will launch a national campaign to speak about the Nehruvian ideology and discourse which is under assault in the dispensation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Nehruvian legacy will be preserved and will flourish,” said a leader. The meeting comes close on the heels of the resignation of Mahesh Rangarajan, former Director of NMML (Nehru Memorial Museum and Library) whose mandate the NDA government wishes to expand beyond Nehruvian research. Rangarajan resigned after Culture Minister Mahesh Sharma pointed out irregularities in his appointment by the then UPA Government on the eve of the May 2014 poll results.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:31:58.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
