The Serbian continued his rampaging form as he trounced Nadal 6-4, 6-2 in the sponsored event that lasted over an hour, Sport24 reported. The match was aimed at boosting confidence in safety following the deadly Bangkok bomb blast last month. During their visit to the junta-ruled nation, the tennis duo met Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-O-Cha and also visited the site of attack, where about 20 people lost their life. Djokovic has had a stellar season as he won his 10th Grand Slam title at the US Open, while Nadal continued to struggle with his poor run.
