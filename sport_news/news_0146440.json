sometimes I let the jock’s agent handicap for me so getting Rafael Bejarano to ride is a positive vote.\n1 Toomanytomatoes – For forgiving handicappers who can draw a line thru the last turf try; her dirt form is good, she won a fast race two back albeit over Del Mar slop.\nLong Shot – 3 Moscato Girl\nRace 2 – 7 furlongs, Purse $17,000, Maiden claiming $20,000, 3-year-olds and up\n4 Visibility – He has finished in the money in 7-of-8 career starts; when that happens with a maiden though it can be looked at as a negative, nibbler tendency.\n9 Resistanceisfutile – Claimed out of his debut race by Rafael Becerra; he puts the blinkers on, but the main thing is he broke slowly and then passed some horses late.\nLong Shot – 7 Ballplayer\nRace 3 – 1 mile (turf, rail at 24 feet), Purse $28,000, Starter allowance $40,000, 3-year-olds and up\n2 Follow Me Crev – Has developed an OK resume on turf since getting claimed five races ago; has speed to lead or follow close up, Vladimir Cerin takes the blinkers off.\n4 Lovenseek – Speedy sort should use that strength as the turf rail is out 24 feet today; runs protected tonight for Peter Miller, which is always a good sign.\nLong Shot – 10 Silver Touch\nRace 4 – 6 furlongs, Purse $19,000, Claiming $16,000, 3-year-olds and up\n1 Carlsbad Mountain – Sliding down the claiming ladder to this career low class; has a strong resume at Santa Anita, so the home field advantage may come into play.\n9 Shakahari – Must overcome a parking lot post in the sprint test; trainer Blaine Wright is excellent, so don’t let the lack of notoriety take you off of this one.\nLong Shot – 5 Syndicated\nRace 5 – 1 mile (turf, rail at 24 feet), Purse $28,000, Starter allowance $40,000, 3-year-olds and up\n9 Global Magician – Stretching out in distance from a 5-furlong sprint to a 2-turn mile; Peter Miller taking the blinkers off, but must overcome this parking lot post.\n2 Dynamite Ride – After two frustrating seconds, trainer Victor Garcia tries blinkers on tonight; chance to save a lot of ground and come grinding in the stretch run.\nLong Shot – 8 Red Button\nRace 6 – 1 mile, Purse $16,000, Claiming $8,000, 3-year-olds and up\n2 American Blend – To think this once classy runner was claimed for $75K 18-months ago; he’s now available for $8K today and is still trying hard to win races.\n8 Noble Kent – Another veteran runner with a lot of back class; claimed by Kristin Mulhall for $8K, like American Blend could beat this kind from memory if right.\nLong Shot – 5 Congregationalist\nRace 7 – 1 ¼ miles (turf, rail at 24 feet), Purse $53,000, Optional claiming $40,000, 3-year-olds and up\n6 King of Jazz – Tiny nod to this speedball who figures to leave fast and control the early pace; the pace in a 10 furlong race is typically a pedestrian one.\n1 Unusually Green – Has not a drop of early speed, so the turf rail out 24 feet won’t help him much at all; this marathon distance has always been a gallopers race.\nLong Shot – 2 Nahem\nRace 8 – 6 furlongs, Purse $25,000, Maiden claiming $40,000, Fillies and mares, 3-year-olds and up\n2 Ponder Lea – Taking the biggest class drop in racing from MSW to maiden claiming; kind of surprised that trainer John Sadler is giving up so early on this filly.\n1 Seaward Cottage – Was claimed two back by Doug O’Neill who then tried a MSW in last; back in for a price tag, but more importantly gets Rafael Bejarano to ride.\nLong Shot – 4 KIANA’S DREAM\nBest Bet - 6 Papaslilprincess (race 1)\nSanta Anita Thursday - Picks/Winners/Mutuels, 16/7/$33.60; Long Shots, 7/0/$0; Best Bet, 1/1/$3.40\nSanta Anita Totals - 54/14/$70.60; Long Shots, 27/5/$83.80; Best Bets, 3/2/$5.60\nSIMULCAST PLAY OF THE DAY - #3 House of Sole (4/1) in race 7 at Keeneland. For scoring purposes, we'll make a hypothetical $2 win, place and show bet, $6 total. On Thursday, Infinite Wisdom was scratched at Belmont Park.
