Volkswagen Canada's dealers have been instructed to suspend the sale and delivery of any new Golf, Golf Sportwagon, Jetta, Beetle or Passat models with 2.0 TDI engines until further notice.\nAs of Oct. 1, VW Canada’s choice of incentives include finance interest rates as low as zero per cent for up to 84 months, depending on the model.\nAlternatively, customers can opt for lease rates as low as 0.9 per cent for up to 48 months, depending on the model, or up to $6,000 cash back. On top of those options, VW is offering up to an additional $1,500 in bonus cash.\nThe company declined to comment on a memo that was sent to its dealers.\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency disclosed last month that stealth software made VW’s 2009-2015 model cars powered by 2.0-litre diesel engines run cleaner during emissions tests than in actual driving. The fallout from that revelation has included investigations in other countries , class-action law suits against the company and a drop in VW’s stock price.\nVolkswagen Canada announced on Sept. 22 that its dealers had been instructed to suspend the sale and delivery of any new Golf, Golf Sportwagon, Jetta, Beetle or Passat models with 2.0 TDI engines until further notice. The order also applied to certain previously owned models from the 2009 model year or later, if equipped with the same engine.\nMore on thestar.com\nAmazon ridding site of Apple and Google streaming devices\nComputers are fast, but service can be slow: Roseman", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:32:30.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
