Unfortunately, the pressure is always on the manager, but that is the way it goes now but I am sure he will find another job.”\n–\nSwansea City manager Garry Monk, who played under Brendan Rodgers when Swansea were promoted to the Premier League: “I can’t believe it. A very harsh decision, that’s a big surprise to me. I’m a bit in shock when I got told that.\n“He was fantastic for us at Swansea and I can’t see anyone who could do a better job at Liverpool F.C. right now.\n“He gave me the insight into management here which is why I’m manager of Swansea. He is a top manager. It makes no sense to me, that decision.”\n–\nFormer Liverpool F.C. manager Graeme Souness: “I’m stunned. They gave him another tranche of money to go again and so soon into the season they’re parting company. I find that amazing.”\n–\nFormer Liverpool captain Jamie Carragher: “He needed to make a good start to the season because he was maybe fortunate in terms of staying on at the end of last season.\n“New staff came in, he spent 70 million pounds ($106.32 million) and then eight games later Liverpool are changing the manager. Just do it in the summer if that’s the situation.\n“The owners have made a lot of decisions that haven’t worked. But he’s been there three and a bit years, they haven’t won a trophy and they’ve played Champions League football once.\n“That’s not good enough for Liverpool. Liverpool are becoming Tottenham — they think they’re a big club.”\n–\nFormer Liverpool midfielder Jamie Redknapp: “He’s had to deal with Raheem Sterling leaving the club, obviously he has lost Steven Gerrard this season, so he’s had a lot to deal with.\n“But as soon as things start to go wrong, and there was a clamour for a change at the club with the fans, it becomes very difficult for you.”\n–\nFormer England captain Rio Ferdinand on Twitter: “It’s only Klopp & Ancelotti Liverpool can be going for … need to make a decision quickly.”\n($1 = 0.6584 pounds)\n 05, 2015 10:16 am", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-07T05:44:39.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
