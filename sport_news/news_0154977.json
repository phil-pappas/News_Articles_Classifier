Australia not the birghtest: Woodward \nSir Clive Woodward is confident England can beat Australia at Twickenham on Saturday, claiming Michael Cheika’s side are “not the brightest team”. \nThe Rugby World Cup 2015 hosts face the prospect of failing to qualify for the quarter-finals following last weekend’s 25-28 defeat to Wales, but Woodward believes all is not lost for Stuart Lancaster’s men. \nIt is a must-win game against Australia and Woodward claims with the right tactics they are there for the taking. \nHe told the Daily Mail: “It is not a case of playing random running rugby against Australia, it’s all about attacking cleverly and with purpose. \n“It’s about never letting them off the hook. If you can keep hold of the ball and run through the phases, always moving forwards, Australia will disintegrate. Do the opposite of what they expect, move the ball quickly from the scrum, take quick line-outs, tap and go. \n“Contrary to popular belief, they are not the brightest team., they give away penalties and pick up yellow cards when they are stretched. \n“Playing at pace also applies to the scoreboard, keep it ticking. Just always score next. Target five tries and if they want to give us penalties in the process, take them too.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:26:02.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
