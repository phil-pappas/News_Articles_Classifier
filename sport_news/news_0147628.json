At this point, I simply want to get healthy and back to my normal daily routine on and off the court.” \nLuke Walton, lead assistant coach, will serve as interim head coach in Kerr’s absence. \nThe Warriors, who clinched a fourth NBA title for the franchise with a 4-2 series victory over Cleveland in June, open their 2015-16 regular season on October 27 at home against the New Orleans Pelicans. \n“We don’t anticipate the recovery process will be long term, but we don’t know the exact time frame,” Warriors general manager Bob Myers said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:01:04.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
