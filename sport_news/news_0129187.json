REUTERS The U.S. Navy will use some of the same equipment deployed in the search for missing Malaysian Airlines MH370 in hopes of finding the sunken cargo ship El Faro .\nWhile the search for survivors—six of whom were from New England —was called off a week after the ship sank somewhere near Crooked Island in the Bahamas, the search for answers almost three miles underneath the ocean’s surface continues. Headed by the National Transportation Safety Board, the investigation as to why the disaster occurred in the first place hinges largely on finding the voyage data recorder, or VDR, which is the ship’s equivalent of an airplane’s black box.\nRelated Links Six crew members aboard sunken cargo ship have deep New England ties Crew position on sunken cargo ship El Faro was Dylan Meklin’s first job out of college To look for it, the U.S. Navy’s search and salvage vessel Apache is setting sail Monday from Norfolk, Virginia, and should be in the search area by mid-week. On board are three of the most advanced underwater search machines in the world, according to Chris Johnson, media relations manager at Naval Sea Systems Command. And while 15,000 feet is a significant depth, all of these tools can operated up to 20,000 feet below sea level.\nThe first of these three devices the Navy will use once it gets near the search area is something called a hydrophone, an underwater device which gets towed behind the ship as it listens for the black box.\n“The VDR emits a steady signal at a certain frequency that is able to be heard by hydrophone,” said Johnson. “Assuming that the black box is working, that it didn’t malfunction and wasn’t damaged on sinking, we’ll be able to get a better idea and get closer to where the wreckage actually is.”\nThat’s also assuming they don’t run out of time: The VDR stops emitting a signal when its battery runs out, about 30 days after the sinking.\nIf the hydrophone doesn’t pick up any signal, however, all hope is not lost. The Navy also has an underwater sonar in its arsenal, which is operated from the Apache , connected to the boat by a fiber optic cable.\n“What that does is maps the ocean floor, looking for signs of wreckage,” Johnson said. “And once we find something we want to take a look at, we send down the remote operated vehicle.”\nThe remote operated vehicle is equipped with video and still cameras. It maneuvers around the wreckage, picking things up and bringing them back up to the ship to be examined. Hopefully one such object will be the VDR.\n“Then the NTSB can begin piecing together what happened,” Johnson said. “And from there, it's up to the NTSB what they want to do next, if anything.”\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement DraftKings says outside investigation clears employee of wrongdoing 10.19.15 | 4:51 PM Local Pearl Harbor survivor dies at 94 10.19.15 | 4:45 PM Archaeology survey underway on Boston Common 10.19.15 | 4:30 PM Harvard kids are obsessed with this turkey wandering around campus 10.19.15 | 3:50 PM Watch: Coast Guard airlifts sick captain from boat 85 miles off Nantucket 10.19.15 | 3:18 PM Navy deploying advanced underwater search tools used in Malaysian plane search to find El Faro 10.19.15 | 3:12 PM Man shot in head while pheasant hunting in New Hampshire 10.19.15 | 3:04 PM Do Boston city councilors deserve a pay raise? 10.19.15 | 1:57 PM Sexual assault reported in Boston University dorm 10.19.15 | 1:18 PM FanDuel launches petition to keep daily fantasy sports legal 10.19.15 | 1:17 PM Boston has first fall freeze, earliest in 36 years 10.19.15 | 11:57 AM Northeastern will discount tuition for undergrads’ relatives 10.19.15 | 11:47 AM Here’s why Mike Dukakis is really enjoying Donald Trump’s campaign 10.19.15 | 10:46 AM Power struggle at UMass department leads to bullying accusations 10.19.15 | 9:27 AM Local ski resorts giddy over weekend flakes 10.19.15 | 8:39 AM In Cambridge, a promise of food security for students comes in a backpack 10.19.15 | 8:02 AM Mixed reviews in Boston about no-tips policy 10.19.15 | 7:14 AM Jonathan Kraft on daily fantasy sports: ‘I think it should be regulated’ 10.18.15 | 10:36 PM Federal agents intercepted 88 pounds of heroin destined for Vermont 10.18.15 | 9:00 PM Here’s why actor Patrick Dempsey biked 50 miles in Maine Sunday 10.18.15 | 7:10 PM Massachusetts residents share Sunday snow videos on Twitter 10.18.15 | 6:07 PM Police: Wrong-way driver on Route 3 charged with OUI 10.18.15 | 4:02 PM Police rescue nude man from Boston Harbor 10.18.15 | 3:12 PM Larry David does pretty, pretty good Bernie Sanders impression on SNL 10.18.15 | 1:53 PM GlobeSouth: Noteworthy performances 10.18.15 | 12:30 PM Cambridge teens can build their own clocks, just like Ahmed 10.17.15 | 4:59 PM It’s already snowing on Mount Washington 10.17.15 | 4:03 PM Get your shuck on and check out these photos from OysterFest 10.17.15 | 2:35 PM Friday night was Northeastern’s annual underwear run 10.17.15 | 2:19 PM The Boston Public Library has fired the employee in charge of misplaced art 10.17.15 | 11:59 AM", "external_links": ["http://c.o0bc.com/rw/SysConfig/WebPortal/BDC/Framework/img/bcom_logo_with_name.png"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:07:36.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
