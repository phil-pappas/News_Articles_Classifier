At the Goa Cricket Association Academy ground, Porvorim, grounds staff failed to cover the pitch in time which resulted in almost a day's play being lost due to a wet strip.\nClose to four hours on the final day was lost in the game between Goa and Hyderabad due to the goof-up. The bare pitch was exposed to rain and play had to eventually be called off. \"The pitch got badly wet (in the first session) and no further play was possible,\" confessed GCA president Chetan Desai.\nThere are different versions of the incident. One suggests the groundsmen were not in place to move the covers the moment the umpires signalled for them. The other version is that the rains came so suddenly that the covers got wet and heavy and the ground staff, about 20 in number, could not handle them.\n\"The pitch was exposed for about 20 minutes,\" said a Hyderabad official, while Desai said his staff was helpless because of the sudden cloudburst. None of the top GCA officials were at the ground â€” Desai himself was in Mumbai for the SGM and secretary Vinod Phadke was with the Indian team as its manager.\nThe BCCI sought a report on the incident, but did not take any action. \"The BCCI is obviously unhappy. We've promised them to be careful. We'll have more people for the next game,\" said Desai. The match ended with first innings incomplete although the home team had managed a 100-run lead at the time of disruption.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:40:59.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
