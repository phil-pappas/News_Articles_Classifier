But Denver’s defence made sure it didn’t matter, getting a third defensive touchdown of the season to remain undefeated. \nDerek Carr threw for 249 yards and one touchdown for the Raiders (2-3) but was done in by the interception midway through the fourth quarter with Oakland in position for a possible go-ahead field goal. \nBut Carr’s third-down pass over the middle was off target and Harris picked it off and returned it for the score, silencing what had been a loud crowd in Oakland. \nThe Raiders added a late 50-yard field goal by Sebastian Janikowski following a 48-yard pass interference penalty on Bradley Roby but Denver recovered the onside kick to seal it. \nManning finished 22 for 35 for 266 yards but was sacked twice and had two interceptions. Denver ran for only 43 yards but used Harris’ interception return and a sack-fumble by Von Miller that set up a field goal to beat the Raiders. This was Denver’s second-lowest scoring regular season with Manning as quarterback, ahead of only a seven-point effort last year against St. Louis. \nThe Broncos have now won eight straight in this series but the Raiders had plenty of chances in this one. Janikowski missed a pair of field goals before Carr’s late gaffe ended Oakland’s hopes. \nBefore Harris’ big play, the highlight of the game had been the play of Woodson, who turned 39 on Wednesday. Woodson, who beat Manning out for the Heisman Trophy in 1997, talked earlier in the week about wanting to get his first interception against Manning. \nHe ended up with two, becoming the oldest player in NFL history with more than one interception in a game. \nJanikowski, who set a Raiders record by playing in his 241st career game, missed his second field goal of the game from 40 yards after Woodson’s second interception, costing Oakland a shot at the lead. \nJanikowski also had a 38-yard attempt blocked by Sylvester Williams in the first quarter. Manning responded to the first miss with a 45-yard pass to Emmanuel Sanders on the next play, leading to a Broncos field goal. But that drive stalled deep in Raiders territory in what would be a recurring problem for the Broncos. \nThey were held to two field goals on their first three trips into the red zone. \nThe Raiders made the most of their second scoring chance when Carr connected on a 3-yard pass to Marcel Reece that put Oakland up 7-3. But that was all they could manage against Denver’s stingy defence. \nThe Broncos went ahead with two more field goals from Brandon McManus in the third quarter. « Previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:33:42.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
