The 49ers defeated the Baltimore Ravens 25-20 on their home field Levi’s Stadium on Sunday. Quarterback Colin Kaepernick did not disappoint passing for 340 yards and two touchdowns. Australian former rugby league player Hayne fumbled his only punt return. When at running back he was never given the ball, even though the 49ers were short on bodies, as team-mate Carlos Hyde struggled with a foot injury. On one play at running back Hayne’s inexperience showed when he failed to block two Ravens defenders, which led to Kaepernick being sacked.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T10:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:14:24.444+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
