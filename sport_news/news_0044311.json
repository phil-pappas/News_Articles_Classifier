Today, we go behind enemy lines and check in with Pete Scantlebury, Associate Editor at PowerMizzou.com. \nUGASports: What exactly is going on with the quarterback situation at Missouri? What exactly happened with Maty Mauk? \nScantlebury: \"There's been no official word on Maty Mauk's suspension besides the 'violation of team policy' line. There's no arrest report, the law doesn't seem to be involved, so at this point, it does seem like an internal matter that Gary Pinkel will not comment on.\"Mauk's suspension has handed the reigns to freshman Drew Lock, a four-star quarterback in the 2015 signing class. He had his first big set-back against Florida, as the Gators disguised coverages to confuse him and constantly hit him (13 times on 43 drop-backs). Going forward, I'd expect more teams to disguise their coverages as often as possible, so it will be interesting to see if he can improve a bit this week.\"Lock is certainly young, but he's probably a better pure quarterback in terms of accuracy, arm strength, etc., than the freelancing Mauk. Missouri's offense is looking for an identity, and if he can get things together and just play efficiently, that would go a long way in helping them hold onto the ball.\" Georgia Report Card: The Tennessee Game \nUGASports: \"Defensively, what has Barry Odum brought as the new defensive coordinator? Are the Tigers doing basically the same thing as they have in recent years?\" \nScantlebury: \"Barry Odom is obviously very familiar to Missouri, having played and coached there before he left for Memphis after 2011. Defensively, he hasn't made many sweeping changes. Missouri is still a base 4-3 team, for instance. However, he has made the defense more aggressive and more varied. He'll stand up Charles Harris or Walter Brady, Missouri's two best defensive ends. He moves Missouri's best cornerback, Aarion Penton, into the box to get him more involved. And he'll send blitzers from outside and inside. Missouri's defense, statistically, has been even better than last year, and Odom seems to have found the right mix of safe coverage and aggressive blitzing through half a season.\" \nUGASports: Staying on defense, it seems like no matter who Missouri trots out, the Tigers are always able to create pressure on the quarterback? Is this more about the scheme and the stunts Coach Odum employs? \nScantlebury: \"Missouri certainly uses stunts on the defensive line, but honestly, I think a lot of that pressure is simply because of the talent the Tigers again have in the front four. Harris was expected to break out this year, and he is — on pace for 25 TFLs in a 13 game season, which would be a school record. Brady, however, has been the surprise. He had to sit out last season because of an academic issue from an online class in high school, and he couldn't even practice or work out with the team. Now, he leads Missouri with six sacks, all of which have come in the last four games.\"In the middle, Missouri has a pretty good rotation of Rickey Hatley, Josh Augusta and freshman four-star Terry Beckner, Jr., but I don't think the pressure has been as consistent as defensive line coach Craig Kuligowski would like. Again, statistically, Missouri's defense is better than last year, but Odom is creating pressure with corner blitzes and using SAM linebacker Donavin Newsom in various ways to get into the backfield. So, to summarize — upfront, I don't think the production is anything specific to scheme. But, overall, Missouri's penetration into the backfield is aided by how Odom employs his corners and linebackers.\" Coach Richt: Chubb likely out for season \nUGASports: Obviously Georgia is scuffling after back to back losses, what is the over frame of mind for Mizzou at the season's halfway point? \nScantlebury: \"Missouri coaches and players won't say it, but I think there's a balancing act going on right now. The SEC East is (realistically) off the table, so now there's the thought that Missouri could start getting some younger players more time. On the depth chart, there's at least a hint of that — two freshman receivers, Cam Hilton and Emanuel Hall, are no longer co-backups at their respective positions. I think the frame of mind is trying to get to the best bowl game possible this year while preparing for next season, especially on offense. Missouri is certainly not overconfident about this game at all, even with two Georgia losses in a row. I think the hope for the Tigers is to just hang onto the ball on offense, keep their (quite good) defense fresh and then see what happens.\" \nUGASports: What's Missouri's biggest offensive concern for Saturday and where do you think the Tigers could enjoy success against the Bulldogs? \nScantlebury: \"As far as offensive concern, where do I start? They've been pretty bad (historically bad for Pinkel) through half the season and there's really no one area that's to blame. The only area where Missouri MAYBE could see some success is on the ground, and that's only if RB Russell Hansbrough is 100-percent. He suffered a high ankle sprain on the first carry of the year and has been limited since. He showed some signs of life against Florida, going for 74 yards on nine carries, but he was still absent in the stat column for long stretches (two carries during the second and third quarters). This offense absolutely needs its best player to be healthy to have any shot of upsetting the Bulldogs.\" \nPHOTOS | UGA vs. Tennessee KNOXVILLE, TN - OCTOBER 10: Brian Randolph #37 of the Tennessee Volunteers breaks up a final hail-mary pass intended for Malcolm Mitchell #26 of the Georgia Bulldogs on October 10, 2015 at Neyland Stadium in Knoxville, Tennessee.
