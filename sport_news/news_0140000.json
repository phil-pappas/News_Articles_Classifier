(Francisco Kjolseth | The Salt Lake Tribune) Herriman's Jake Jutkins is taken down by Seth Corry of Lone Peak in game action during the final week of the prep football regular season at Herriman on Thursday night, Oct. 22, 2015. Lone Peak 30, Herriman 0 » Gunther and Co. claim Region Four title. Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (15) Herriman • Goal accomplished! That was the message Lone Peak quarterback Talmage Gunther and the talented Knights sent to other unbeaten 5A football powers Thursday night as they blasted Herriman 30-0 and won the Region Four title in the process. \"We are not done yet,\" said Gunther after passing for three touchdowns and running for a fourth as Lone Peak dominated every phase of a game against a Mustang team that only lost 6-0 to top-ranked Bingham earlier in the year. \"That was the first goal. We are moving on to the next part of the season. I feel like we knew we were capable of this and we wanted to come out and show something.\" VIDEOS Check out all the Trib TopJobs From the first play of the game to the final moments when second string players preserved the shutout, Lone Peak simply dominated. Gunther, Lone Peak's best quarterback since University of Utah player Chase Hansen graduated from the program, tossed 66- and 8-yard scoring passes to Jon Christensen, connected with Tyler Macpherson on a 37-yard touchdown on the game's opening drive and capped the scoring with a 10-yard run. But, as Lone Peak coach Mike Mower pointed out, the quarterback was just a part of a game that saw the Knight defense stymie Herriman all evening and the offensive line have its way against one of Utah's best defenses. \"These kids have had great chemistry the whole year,\" said Mower, whose team completed an unbeaten regular season with the victory. \"They don't care who gets the credit. It is one of the most enjoyable groups of kids I have ever worked with it.\" While praising Herriman, Mower said his defensive coaches put together a fine game plan. \"Our kids love the game,\" he said. \"They have great confidence when they take the field. It's not cockiness and not arrogance … When they take the field, everything is interconnected. It doesn't matter what the job is.\" Lone Peak will join Davis and the winner of Friday's Sky View-Mountain Crest team as the only unbeaten 5A team. Bingham, whose only loss came to national power Bishop Gorman, might be considered by most to be the team to beat. But it's going to take a great effort to shut down Gunther and the Knights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:32:59.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
