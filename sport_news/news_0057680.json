He had another chance to win it in overtime but that one went wide left from 48 yards. \nHasselbeck made his first start in nearly three years and managed the game deftly. He finished 30 of 47 with 282 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions. \nHe was at his sharpest on the final series, when he hooked up with Coby Fleener on 28-yard pass play, then fooled everyone with a bootleg that gained 4 yards. After Frank Gore ran for 1 yard, he broke the next one for 22. All Hasselbeck had to do then was position the ball in the middle of the field for Vinatieri's chip shot.

Dressed in street clothes and a gray baseball hat, he clapped his hands, counseled teammates after plays and even handed water to Hasselbeck. And when Myers missed the 48-yarder, Luck pumped his fist. \nThat was all he could do.

But Gore had the ball stripped on a second-and-goal run, and the Jags recovered in the end zone for a touchback. \nBortles finished 28 of 50 with 298 yards with one touchdown. T.J. Yeldon ran 22 times for 105 yards and Hurns finished with a career best 11 catches for 116 yards.
