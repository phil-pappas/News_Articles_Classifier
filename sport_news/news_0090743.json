One person wrote, \"As a planner of many events, having no-shows is part of the process. This situation should have been considered long before the wedding took place.\" Another suggested Jessica should make a donation in the bride and groom's name instead of giving the money to the newly married couple.\nIt's not being reported whether Jessica let the bride and groom know she and her husband wouldn't be able to attend the wedding.\nBut a writer for The Knot does say instead of \"just not [showing] up,\" guests who RSVP'd yes should let the hosts know they can't make it to the event.\nA wedding planner was a little more direct when she wrote an op-ed for The Huffington Post , saying, \"Unless you're in the hospital or have just had a death in your immediate family, there is no excuse to no-show at a wedding.
