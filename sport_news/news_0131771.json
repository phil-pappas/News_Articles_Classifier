Dean of Sir J.J. Hospital, T.P. Lahane said Indrani is responding to treatment and is now in a semi-conscious state, and she may fully recover in at least three days. “She is responding to voice commands, asked for water once but remains in a semi-conscious state. She is also on ventilator to help her breathe, we are waiting for the urine report to determine what could be the exact cause of her present condition,” Lahane told mediapersons here on Saturday. Indrani was rushed to Sir J.J. Hospital after she complained of uneasiness and breathing issues around 2 p.m. on Friday. Late Friday night, her condition was described serious as a series of medical tests were carried out, according to Lahane. “We think that she (Indrani Mukherjea) consumed some tablets... we are treating her on that basis,” he added. A senior home department official Satvir Singh said Indrani was prescribed to take two pills for epileptic problems, one in morning and one in evening, under the supervision of the jail authorities. However, she apparently hoarded the tablets and took them at one go early on Friday leading to her present condition, he said, adding the matter would be probed. Indrani was arrested on August 25 for her role in the murder of Sheena Bora, her daughter from a previous marriage, in April 2012. Along with Indrani, her ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna and her former driver Shyamvar Rai were also nabbed. The sensational case was initially handled by Mumbai Police under the supervision of then police commissioner Rakesh Maria and later transferred to the CBI by the Maharashtra government. The CBI lodged a separate case against the three late last month. Since September 7, Indrani, Khanna and Rai have been lodged in judicial custody. — IANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:30:42.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
