The issue was discussed at an FA board meeting on Wednesday. \nAn FA statement said: ‘In July, The FA board decided unanimously to support Michel Platini if he intended to stand for the presidency of FIFA. We did so because we thought he was an excellent president of UEFA and could bring those same leadership qualities to FIFA. We are still of that view.' \n‘However, events of recent days have raised a number of issues which do need to be fully examined.’ \nPlatini, whose status has been described by the Swiss attorney general as ‘in between a witness and accused person’ in the criminal proceedings involving FIFA president Sepp Blatter, has said he is still determined to stand for the presidency in February. \nBlatter has also written to all FIFA’s member associations insisting the payment to Platini was legitimate. \nThe FA statement added: ‘We are following the ongoing investigation initiated by the Swiss attorney general with which Mr Platini is co-operating in full. We also recognise that Mr Platini has contacted the FIFA ethics committee inviting them to look into the matter and to interview him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:58:52.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
