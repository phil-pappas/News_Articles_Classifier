London Swimming Pool Company, based in New Malden have won a gold award in the Domestic Spas category.\nNew Malden, Surrey (PRWEB UK) 22 October 2015\nNew Malden based London Swimming Pool Company has beaten hundreds of contenders across 14 countries to win a coveted gold award for the design and build of a luxury spa at a Kensington private residence. The judges were impressed with the spa, which is part of a larger swimming pool installation that features a moving floor. The moving floor enables the pool depth to be adjusted in minutes or to be closed off with a solid floor so the space can be used for entertainment. The award-winning spa has been fitted with a rigid cover to support people standing on it and a lighter cover for daily use.\nLondon Swimming Pool Company recently re-located its growing business to Shannon Commercial Centre in New Malden, where it now employs a team of 25 full time staff dedicated to the design, build, refurbishment and servicing of indoor and outdoor swimming pools and spas for clients living in Surrey and London.\nThe gold award for the luxury spa was presented at the European Pool & Spa Awards hosted by the European Union of Swimming Pool and Spa Associations (EUSA) at the Piscina & Wellness Exhibition in Barcelona on 13 October. The awards have five categories, with 14 winners announced across the 13 countries that comprise EUSA .\nEarlier this year London Swimming Pool Company won a UK award for the design of the same spa in the British Pool & Hot Tubs awards presented by the Swimming Pool and Allied Trades Association (SPATA), qualifying the company for entry into the European Pool & Spa Awards.\nJamie Smith, Managing Director at London Swimming Pool Company said, “It’s a huge honour to be awarded gold at the European Pool and Spa Awards. The entries were judged by top industry professionals with exacting standards, so receiving this accolade means a great deal to our company and highlights the passion that our team puts into every project. We have seen an increase in the number of people wanting the whole ‘wellness’ experience and they are having spas, saunas, steam rooms, hammams and even ice rooms installed in their homes.”\nEUSA represents over 3,000 swimming pool and spa companies across Europe; needless to say, the competition was of the highest standard.\nJamie Smith – London Swimming Pool Company\nUnit 1, Shannon Commercial Centre, Beverley Way, New Malden, KT3 4PT\nTel : 020 8605 1255\nEmail: enquiries(at)londonswimmingpools(dot)com\nhttp://www.londonswimmingpools.com/\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13035031.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13035031.htm", "http://www.londonswimmingpools.com/"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:49:36.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
