Massimiliano Allegri's champions sit in 15th place, at 10 points off the pace.\nAllegri said on Wednesday: \"Tonight's game is over. Now we have to start focusing our next game, against Bologna.\"\nFixtures (times GMT)\nSaturday\nCarpi v Torino (1600), Chievo v Verona (1845)\nSunday\nEmpoli v Sassuolo (1030), Udinese v Genoa, Sampdoria v Inter, Palermo v Roma (all 1300), Lazio v Frosinone, Juventus v Bologna (both 1600), Fiorentina v Atalanta, AC Milan v Napoli (both 1845) ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:34:30.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
