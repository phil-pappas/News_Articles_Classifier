There are enough employees in the game with a football mind,” he told reporters. \n“We need more people in the game with that business acumen behind them and understand the role the game has in business. \n“You could argue that you need someone with some knowledge in the game but I would debate that.” \nGold Coast boss Graham Annesley, NSWRL CEO David Trodden and Penrith’s Warren Wilson are other contenders but Moore has quickly ruled himself out of the running. \nFormer AFL boss Andrew Demetriou has also reportedly declined to consider the position. \nSmith may have copped flak for not “getting” the NRL fan but Moore claimed the outgoing league boss did something in Queensland during his tenure no previous Sydney-based bureaucrat has achieved. \n“He went all over the place, he found out what was happening at grass roots level. \n“That was the first time an administrator from Sydney had ever done that.” \nAsked how Smith’s reign will be remembered, Moore said: “It depends on who you talk to.” \nHowever, Moore was hopeful the next NRL CEO shared Smith’s view of Queensland. \n“I am disappointed to see him go because we had a really good relationship with Dave,” he said. \n“There is far more rigour in decision making in the game (in Smith’s reign), decisions aren’t all biased toward NSW as they were in the past you could argue. \n“We would hope whoever comes in for that job takes the same view of Queensland. \n“We gave up a lot to form a commission and expected to get something back.” \nIt is believed Smith’s departure may fast track NRL expansion with a southeast Queensland team expected to get the nod. \nGrant said there were provisions in the 2018-22 free-to-air agreement for a 17th team to come from Brisbane.
