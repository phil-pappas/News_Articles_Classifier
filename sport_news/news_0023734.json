On the game, Bray completed 20 of 27 passes for 275 yards and two passing touchdown. He also had one rushing touchdown on a QB sneak in the second quarter. \nSpreading The Ball Around – Brady hit five different receivers with at least two passes in the game. Leading the way was Julian Edelman, who snagged four receptions for 120 yards including 59-yard touchdown catch that saw him make a plethora of defenders miss. Running back Dion Lewis also made eight catches for 59 yards including a crazy one handed touchdown catch. \nOffensive Line Gets On Track- After a tough first half in which they allowed the Dallas defense to sack Brady five times, the Patriot offensive line stiffened up over the last two quarters. They allowed zero second half sacks and continually gave Brady time to find open receivers en route to the 17-point half. Lost in the fray, was the exit of tackle Nate Solder, who missed the second half with an elbow injury. \nDefense Shuts Down Dallas Attack- After the off week the Patriot defense looked sharp, allowing just two Dallas field goals on the day. The Front seven created constant pressure from the start of the game, while the secondary left little opportunity for Dallas quarterback Brandon Weeden to find open receivers. Collectively, they held the Cowboy offense to just 265 yards on 66 total plays. \nWinning The Turnover Battle- The Patriots defense came away with two turnovers on the day, while the offense held onto the ball all day long. Dallas’ first turnover was a Jason Witten fumble that was jarred loose by linebacker Jamie Collins and scooped up by fellow linebacker Jonathan Freeny. The second one came on an errant throw by Weeden that was picked off by cornerback Logan Ryan, who returned the ball 25 yards. \nAll in all, the Patriots got better as the game went on. It appeared as though they spent most of the first half shaking off the rust of an early bye week, at least offensively. The second half was a more quintessential look at Patriot football, as they moved freely and completely controlled the final two quarters. \nTo check out all the stats, click here . \nTo take a look at some first half thoughts, click here .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:20:45.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
