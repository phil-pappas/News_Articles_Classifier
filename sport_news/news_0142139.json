FOX Sports \nOct 1, 2015 at 8:40p ET + \nTebow's words from famous postgame speech may act as motivation Public Domain   8:42p ET \nIn 2008, the then-ranked No. 4 Florida Gators were shockingly upset at home by Ole Miss, 31-30. It led to former Florida quarterback Tim Tebow giving one of the most iconic postgame speeches of any player on the collegiate level. Called \"The Promise,\" the heartfelt words were etched onto a plaque and placed outside of Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. \nFast-forward to this weekend, and the roles between Florida and Ole Miss have been reversed. â€” SECstagram (@SECstagram) September 13, 2014 \nThe Gators are now the ones trying to pull the upset against Hugh Freeze's top-5 team. Ole Miss does possess superior offensive firepower when compared to Florida. The Rebels also feature elite talent at all three levels of its defense. It's a contest where on paper, Ole Miss should win. \nHowever, \"The Swamp\" should provide a party-like atmosphere of epic proportions. Florida will also want to prove itself against a top-level conference opponent. \nWill the Florida athletes be able evoke the heart, determination and emotion of Tebow from that memorable postgame press conference? \nWe shall see on Saturday.
