If I play to my potential, I think I can do well here. The immediate goal is to try and make the cut and then see how far I can go,” said Azaan. \n“Whatever the outcome, playing alongside a strong field will be a great learning curve.” \nAzaan had missed the cut at the Muscat Hills Championship, the eighth stop over of the MENA Tour, last week. \nIf Azaan and his fellow Omanis have their own goals, England’s Scotland, a nine-time winner on the tour, will be eyeing another strong finish, if not victory, to close the gap on his compatriot Gary King, who currently leads the Order of Merit standings. \nWith just one more event left on the 2015 MENA Golf Tour schedule before the cut is made for the season-ending Tour Championship, the third edition of the tournament at Ghala will keep things interesting with players jockeying for positions on the Order of Merit. \nAlso, an interesting battle for the honours in the amateur division is brewing with India’s Rayhan Thomas and Morocco’s Ayoub Lguirati, who finished tied on top at Muscat Hills last week, fast catching up with leader James Allan of England. \nWith Morocco’s Younes El Hassani returning to form with a tied fourth at Muscat Hills, the title race in the MENA division has been thrown open. Just US$3,000 separates the top four, including frontrunner Faycal Serghini, indicating the race for the Shaikh Maktoum Golf Foundation has all the ingredients for a thrilling finish.
