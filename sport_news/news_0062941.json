The rest of the field finished at least 1.90 seconds off the lead. \nIt was Ligety's fourth win here. He has dominated the discipline since 2012 but was beaten for the GS title by Hirscher last year. \nNorwegians Aksel Lund Svindal and Kjetil Jansrud, expected to be Hirscher's closest competitors for the overall championship, finished more than four seconds off the lead in 24th and 25th respectively.
