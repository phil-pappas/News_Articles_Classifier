The events of recent months proved to anyone who still needed proof that this is a battle for the country’s image and national identity.”\n“The State of Israel, which demands that its adversaries to recognize it as the state of the Jewish people and asks its supporters in the world to back this demand, must be able to declare in legislation that it proudly wears its identity,” he said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:48:53.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
