Not surprisingly, Kentucky was predicted to win the league. LSU freshman forward Ben Simmons was voted the preseason player of the year. \nAuburn head coach Bruce Pearl said on the first day of preseason practice “the challenge over the next month” as he enters his second season at Auburn is “how quickly can I move with seven new players?” \nAuburn has five new players from a recruiting class ranked No. 28 in the country by ESPN.com and two Division 1 transfers coming into the rotation immediately. \nKareem Canty , who was named to the All-Conference USA third-team averaging 16.3 points and 5.5 assists as a freshman at Marshall in 2013-14, and graduate student Tyler Harris , who averaged 9.9 ppg and 4.0 rpg last season at Providence are expected to be immediate impact players to join senior Cinmeon Bowers , the Southeastern Conference’s leading returner in both double-doubles (14) and rebounding (9.6 per game). \n“It does seem like the court is much smaller,” Pearl said in a school release after day one of practices. “We have a nice foundation built and we are competing.” \nThe new pieces to Division 1 college basketball include guard T.J. Dunans , the nation’s No. 1 ranked junior college player, 6-foot-9 four-star forward Horace Spencer (ranked No. 61 by ESPN.com) out of Findlay Prep in Nevada and Purifoy. \n“I would imagine we are going to have some very spectacular, really high moments with this club because we are talented enough,” Pearl said. “I would imagine just because we are new and somewhat young, there will be time where we will be immature.” \n6-foot-7 wing player Danjel Purifoy , out of Hargrave Military Academy in Virginia via Centerville, Ala., was able to practice but his status with the NCAA Eligibility Center is still unknown. Purifoy, a four-star recruit and ranked 66th overall according to ESPN.com, still has hopes of becoming eligible when Auburn opens its 2015-16 season at home against Conference USA Tournament champions UAB on Nov. 13. \nSpokespeople for both the NCAA and Auburn have refused comment on Purifoy’s case and Pearl only added Friday that “he’s practicing and he’s in school and that’s all I can really say”. \n“We hope we have him,” Pearl said the first week of preseason practice about Purifoy.
