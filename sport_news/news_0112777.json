Instead, Ventura escaped unscathed. The Jays would take a 1-0 lead the next inning when Kevin Pillar and Ryan Goins hit back-to-back doubles, but Martin’s out still felt like a missed opportunity.\nTulo snaps slump\nJays shortstop Troy Tulowitzki, who came back early from his cracked shoulder blade to join the team in time for the post-season, is clearly not 100 per cent. While he continues to play stellar defence, he is not himself at the plate. But he had a good day on Saturday, going 2-for-2 with an RBI double to snap a 0-for-13 hitless streak. He still only has four hits in the post-season, with the other two coming in Game 3 of the ALDS against the Texas Rangers, when he hit the game-breaking, three-run homer.\n“I’m just battling, just trying to do what I can,” he said after Saturday’s game.\nPrice strikes out side\nFor six innings on Saturday, Price pitched an absolute gem. He set a Jays’ record by retiring 18 consecutive batters after a leadoff single by Escobar in the first. He relentlessly pounded the zone and worked efficiently, needing just 66 pitches through his first 18 outs. He may have been at his best in the sixth, when he threw up an authoritative zero after the Jays had added to their lead in the top half of the inning by striking out the side. He mixed and matched all of his pitches — alternating his 79-m.p.h. curveball, 91-m.p.h. cutter, 85-m.p.h. changeup and 94-m.p.h. fastball — to keep Alex Gordon, Alex Rios and Alcides Escobar guessing.\nThe Sky falls\nPrice was cruising, unhittable, until his former teammate, Ben Zobrist, led off the seventh inning with a harmless-looking pop-up to shallow right field. Goins appeared to have a beat on it, repeatedly waving off right fielder Jose Bautista. But at the last second, Goins gave way. He said later that he thought he heard an “I got it,” perhaps amid the deafening crowd noise.\nThere was little hint then — given how well Price was pitching — that the gaffe would become a turning point. But with that crack in the door the Royals barged through, rallying for five runs to take the lead.\n“The blame should go on me today,” Goins said. “I gave them that play to start that rally.”\nGame-over Gordon\nAlex Gordon, arguably the Royals’ best all-around player who is batting in the eighth spot in the batting order after spending nearly two months on the disabled list, had the biggest hit of the Royals’ seventh-inning rally.\nFor Price, who had already given up three runs on four hits, the full-count fastball he left over the middle of the plate to Gordon was the pitch he would most like to have back. Gordon lined it into the gap to score the winning run. Afterward, Gordon said the dropped fly ball was the opening they needed against Price.\n“I felt like we needed to catch a break, and Zobrist’s ball there got things going. And once this lineup gets moving, it’s one guy after another. It was a big seventh inning.”\nMore on thestar.com\nGame 2 loss may come back to haunt these Blue Jays: Arthur\nJays' David Price can't buy a break in post-season: DiManno", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:54:07.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
