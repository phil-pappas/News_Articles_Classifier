Millard South 4-410. North Platte 5-3 Bob Sez: There seems a certain stability at the top of this class, with Millard West (47-12 over former No. 10 Kearney), Bellevue West (53-35 over Creighton Prep), Millard North (49-7 over former No. 7 Papio South) and Omaha Central (49-16 over South Sioux City) have settled in. Grand Island bounces back from that turnover filled loss to Millard South to move up from No. 7 to No. 5. Westside beat Omaha North last week, 42-28, but stays behind GI because it lost to the Islanders. Papio South is only penalized one spot despite the big loss to Millard North, staying one step ahead of Papio-LV, which has won five in a row, but lost to Papio South. We go with Millard South at No. 9 because of its win over GI, North Platte at No. 10 because of its 20-0 shut out of former No. 5 Norfolk. Honestly, about five teams could fill those final two spots. Top Games for Week 9: Omaha Central at Bellevue West, Millard North at Papillion-LaVista (Thursday), Creighton Prep at Papillion-LaVista South, Kearney at Norfolk.
