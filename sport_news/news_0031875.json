Four days earlier, the Dutch have a home friendly against France - a team they have been drawn with in a tough World Cup qualification group. \nOn Thursday, the Dutch announced friendlies next month against world champion Germany and Wales, both teams that are heading to Euro 2016. \nThe strong lineup of friendly opponents gives Blind an opportunity to start rebuilding and giving experience to his team that mixes many young players with veterans like Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:06:41.240+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
