Family members found the child lying unconscious and bleeding in a park three hours after she went missing during a power outage in the neighborhood.\nPolice have detained a few men but have not yet made any arrests in the incident, Kumar said.\nMeanwhile, police said they were questioning three men arrested in the gang-rape of the 5-year-old Friday evening in east Delhi.\nBoth girls were in stable condition at hospitals, police said.\nThe rapes occurred a week after a 4-year-old girl was found dumped near a railway track after being raped and slashed with a blade.\nA series of recent attacks has renewed public fury and horror over India's inability to halt chronic violence against women and girls.\nIn December 2012, the fatal gang-rape of a 23-year-old medical student on a moving bus led to a national outcry. In response to that attack, the government doubled the maximum prison term for rape to 20 years, created special courts to prosecute cases more quickly, and made voyeurism and acid attacks specific crimes under the law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T11:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:01:28.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
