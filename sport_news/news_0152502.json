Son of a small-time farmer from Ajayab village in Rohtak district, he clocked 20.66 seconds in the 200-metre sprint as against 20.80 seconds by Milkha Singh. The feat also saw him register a new national record -- the previous was set by Anil Kumar, 20.73 seconds. But the achievement hasn’t proved big enough for him to get support from the government to enable him prepare for the Olympics, to be held in Rio de Janeiro next year. To qualify for the world games, he only needs to improve a bit and complete the 200-metre event in 20.5 seconds. Confident of not just qualifying but also securing a medal in the world event, Dharmbir says lack of funds and requisite training facilities have been proving a major stumbling block. “A pair of good-quality spikes for practice cost around Rs14,000 and these get worn out within a month or two. Food supplements as well as training from a good coach, physiotherapist, doctor and massager too are indispensable. An experience of running on foreign soil is also a must to have first-hand exposure. I cannot afford all these and help from the government has not come yet,” he says. Working as an insurance agent to earn his livelihood, Dharmbir says he has approached the district as well as the state authorities for help several times but to no avail. “I could not participate in the London Olympics in 2012 due to similar constraints. The situation has been the same as yet this time too,” he laments. Dharmbir has also participated and won medals in the 2010 Asian Games, Delhi Commonwealth Games and several other events. Leave aside his selection for a government job under sports quota, the athlete is yet to receive due cash rewards amounting to Rs 16 lakh. He maintains if the Haryana Government does not sponsor his training and other facilities, he would have no option but to represent some other state. Dharmbir says he had to raise a loan of Rs 6 lakh to prepare for the Asian championship, and that it was not possible for him to get under more debt. “I have offers from Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand and Kerala. But I want to represent Haryana, my home state... I may have to make a choice if help doesn’t come,” adds Dharmbir.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:16:49.378+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
