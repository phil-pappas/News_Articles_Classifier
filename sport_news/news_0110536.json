The Blue Devils visit Farrell tonight in a battle of unbeaten teams. Herald file photo \nFarrell High players are pictured during a timeout in a recent game. Posted: Friday, October 23, 2015 6:00 am Battle of unbeatens: Steelers host Blue Devils ED FARRELL | Herald Assistant Sports Editor The Herald For all the hype and anticipation –– and legitimate interest –– invested in tonight’s Sharpsville-at-Farrell Region 1-A affair, the winner won’t gain much more than bragging rights. But the potential –– and expected rematch, approximately 4 weeks hence –– now that’s the game that will warrant the weighty wagging of scholastic football fans’ tongues. With District 10’s decision to expand its playoff brackets, there will not be significant separation between Region 1’s champion and runner-up relating to the postseason tournament, if, in fact, Farrell and defending champion Sharpsville are Class A’s two best teams. However as Thanksgiving approaches and if these teams meet again, obviously someone’s season –– and some players’ prep careers –– will end prematurely, prior to the PIAA playoffs. Tonight’s Games (All games begin 7 p.m.) Sharpsville (4-0, 7-0) at Farrell (4-0, 7-0) This is as proud a pair of programs produced in Mercer County –– regardless of sport or gender. How many other PIAA districts can boast a 3-peat of Class A commonwealth crowns, as Farrell (1995-96) and Sharpsville (’97) can? Then there’s the domination of D-10 –– Sharpsville (9 championships, including a 3-peat from 1999-2001) and Farrell (4, three-peating from 2008-10). Tonight’s tilt at Anthony J. Paulekas Stadium/Lou Falconi Field will showcase Sharpsville’s schematics –– executing its wing-T offense –– versus the Steelers’ speed and Farrell’s fabled athleticism. One wonders if Sharpsville skipper Paul Piccirilli (19th season, 180-49) and Offensive Coordinator Lenny Grandy will offer a few wrinkles, or perhaps save those in anticipation of a rematch. Ditto for Farrell’s Jarrett Samuels (8th season, 74-23) and his staff. Obviously, both will be playing to win. But will the possibility of another meeting –– albeit, more crucial, considering the stakes –– be in the back of their minds? Tonight’s talented skill-position players include quarterbacks Alex Myers and Luke Henwood; running backs Braxton Chapman, Tyrel Adkins, Malachai Newell, and Khaliq Ragster (who surpassed the 1,000-yard season standard last week), Tyrin Peavy and Bobby Besser, and receivers Marcus McCoy and Marquis Altman. The teams have a quartet of common opponents (Reynolds, West Middlesex, Lakeview, Erie-East). Only West Middlesex has a winning record (Lakeview was awarded a win by forfeit last week to surpass the .500 mark). And a final consideration for the ultimate survivor, be it Sharpsville or Farrell: Perennial PIAA power Clairton, which claimed consecutive conquests of Farrell in 2008 (24-21), ‘09 (13-7) and 2010 (48-8), as well another pair at Sharpsville’s expense in 2011 (30-8) and 2014 (54-18). Notes: Farrell added extra bleachers to accommodate an expected huge crowd. ... The game will be broadcast on NewsTalk 790 (WPIC AM), with Mark Slezak and Bob Greenburg calling the action. Hickory (4-1, 6-1) at Grove City (1-4, 1-6) As recently as 3 seasons ago this was a key region rivalry –– the teams met in the 2012 District 10 Class AA semifinals. However Hickory won that day (35-13) and has swept the last trio of regular-season games, 48-12 (2014), 37-7 (2013) and 41-12 (2012). Hickory’s Charles Carr actually has collected twice as many yards rushing (1,347) as the entire Eagles’ squad (642), though Grove City’s ground game gained a season-high 182 yards against Farrell last week. The game also will feature prolific passer Kam Patterson of Grove City and his plethora of targets. Slippery Rock (3-2, 4-3) at Sharon (5-0, 6-1) Sharon defeated Hickory (35-34) ... Hickory defeated Greenville (28-9) ... both Hickory (43-10) and Greenville (27-22) defeated Slippery Rock. All of which means Sharon must stay the course and not stumble over Slippery Rock if the Tigers are to take the Region 3-AA title. For all of its prolific offense, Sharon has surrendered only 13 points in consecutive conquests of Warren (42-7), Grove City (35-6) and Northwestern (42-0). Offensively, Coach Jim Wildman’s weapons include dual-threat QB Andrew Tomko (1,599 yards passing, 19 TDs), wide-out Ziyon Strickland (10 TDs), Damon Rudolph’s rushing (4 TDs) and Jonathan Williams (2 TDs). The injury-ravaged Rockets were routed in Edinboro by Gen. McLane (42-21) last week, owing in part to 7 fumbles (4 lost). According to The (Erie) Times-News, the Lancers were led by Kyle Sult (23 carries, 273 yards, 3 TDs, including a 63-yarder) and Ryan Carpenter (20-147, 2 TDs). McLane manufactured 464 rushing yards. Ryan Lauster led the Rockets’ run game with a 158 yards and 2 TDs. In an interesting footnote in this age of pass-happy offense at every level: neither team completed a pass; in fact, McLane did not attempt a pass, according to The Times-News. Greenville (4-1, 6-1) at Titusville (0-5, 0-7) The Trojans triumphed over rival Reynolds last week –– barely, despite Greenville’s being outgained on the ground by a significant margin –– and have a Week-9 Region 3-AA showdown with Sharon looming. Of more pressing concern is tonight’s tilt at Titusville’s Carter Field on Senior Recognition Night. The Rockets have been routed in region play by county clubs Slippery Rock, Sharon and Grove City. Last week their homecoming was spoiled by Oil City (26-6). Titusville’s highlight was a 67-yard TD toss from Brady Corklin to Skylar McIntyre. But Oil City outgained the Rockets, 343-118 –– including a 1-yard run by Riley MacKenzie –– according to The (Titusville) Herald. Greenville’s ground game has gained 252 yards/game, but opponents have been unable to stack the box, owing to the pitch-catch combo of QB Gage Gladysz and athletic Ethan Reiser. Lakeview (2-3, 4-3) at Wilmington (2-2, 4-3) While Lakeview lost a Week-7 game and the Sailors’ 2015 homecoming was wiped out owing to a forfeit from Saegertown, the Sailors should be the most well-rested, healthy team in D-10. Meanwhile Wilmington has endured more than its share of injuries. To that point, the Greyhounds got off to a 3-0 start to the season but have dropped 3 of their last 4 games, outscored by West Middlesex, Farrell and Hickory –– teams that are a collective 18-3 –– by a 103-19 margin. Sailors’ speedsters Austin Rice, Tanner Reddick and Jake Doddo could be dangerous on Greyhounds Stadium’s synthetic surface. Wilmington won 19-0 last season in Sandy Lake/Stoneboro. The game will be broadcast on SportsRadio 96.7 (WLLF FM), with Ryan Briggs and Chris Burtch calling the action. Reynolds (0-4, 1-6) at Mercer (0-4, 1-6) Playing for pride will be on display in the County Seat. Both teams won big on opening night –– Reynolds over Cochranton (35-0); Mercer over Eisenhower (41-14) –– but both have suffered 6 straight setbacks since. Reynolds’ run game could prove challenging for the Mustangs. Opponents have rushed for of 223 yards/game against Mercer; the Raiders run for an average of almost 260 yards/game. The programs have traded victories during the last 5 years, with Reynolds rolling in 2014 (28-14) and 2012 (27-14), while Mercer mustered wins in 2013 (32-28), 2011 (27-6) and 2010 (33-12). Homer-Center (4-3) at West Middlesex (5-2) West Middlesex has won 3 of its last 4 games, losing only to defending D-10 titlist Sharpsville. The Big Reds have rolled over Wilmington, Mercer and Cochranton by a collective 80-15 differential. The Reds’ run game has been the key, accounting for 732 yards in the trio of triumphs, led by Luke Hemminger (420) and Jason Ash (208). Homer-Center suffered a 33-21 setback to United –– a squad that visited Farrell for the 2014 regular-season finale. According to The (Indiana) Gazette, the win snapped a 31-game Heritage Conference losing skid (dating back to 2011) for United, which improved to 3-4 after a frustrating 2014 campaign. At halftime Homer-Center had a 273-86 edge in total yards and 30-16 edge in offensive plays, but the Wildcats allowed a 21-7 margin dissipate into defeat. Homer-Center signal-caller Jesse Beacker played at United last year, according to The Gazette. Though he threw a 52-yard TD to running back Jesse Lee, Beacker’s 3rd-period pass was pilfered by Logan George, which proved uplifting for United’s rally. Homer-Center Coach Greg Page told The Gazette, “You’re never going to fault a kid for trying to make a play in that situation. ... This is a tough one for him, but he’s going to bounce back. He’s a smart, mentally-tough kid.” But the Big Reds’ run game could be beneficial, based on how Homer-Center was exploited by United’s Brent Mack (235 yards on 17 carries, including an 87-yard scoring sprint, and conference-leading 1,082 yards rushing). Lee led the Wildcats with 149 yards rushing and a pair of pass receptions for another 96 yards. Last year in Indiana County West Middlesex won, 34-6. Brookfield (7-1) at Campbell Memorial (2-6) The Warriors won their 7th straight in dealing LaBrae a 19-14 loss last week. But Brookfield is banged up, including Xavier Bailey, Alex Clark, Kasey Tingler and others. Champion checked Campbell Memorial (23-20) last week. Yianni Koullias collected a 14-carry, 118-yard, 2-TD rushing performance (65, 2 yards) in the Red Devils’ defeat, while Zion Williams threw for 94 yards, including a 51-yard scoring strike to Elijah McCaskill, according to The (Youngstown) Vindicator. Campbell Memorial actually outgained the Golden Flashes, 295-223, but was bedeviled by 8 fumbles, 5 lost. Also, Campbell Memorial was victimized by Brandon Allen’s 174-yard, 2-TD passing performance, which would play to Brookfield quarterback Augustus Necastro’s strength.
