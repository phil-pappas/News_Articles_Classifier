Their entire life revolves around obtaining and using drugs.\"\n\"Everything revolves around that,\" agreed Sagun. \"Night and day, they're chasing the drug, and seeking to satisfy the addiction.\"\nThey said they'd like to see more treatment beds and more public awareness of heroin.\nThey said addiction can happen the first time a person uses the drug.\n\"Your brain changes to react to the chemical,\" noted Sagun. \"You won't be the same after that point. You'll just continue to seek out that feeling, again and again.\"\nDr. Corder referred to one woman who described it as a relationship.\n\"This person was her life, her ruler,\" he noted. \"It determined when she ate, when she slept, what she did. And she was talking about heroin. If they were to see what I saw, they would never start.\"\nThey say at Northwood they treat about 100 addiction patients a week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:08:41.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
