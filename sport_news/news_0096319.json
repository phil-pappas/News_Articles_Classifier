Parkland took complete control of the game after that score. \nTop performer: Hudson had two goals and pair of assists as she led the Trojans, who were without injured top scorer Brooke Schutter . \nWhat it means : The Trojans prove they are the class of the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference with a convincing win over one of the other top teams in the conference. And they did it without their top scorer on the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T10:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:36:12.618+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
