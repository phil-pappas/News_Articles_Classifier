(Getty Images) \nYou could spend hours -- longer than it actually took to play Game 5 -- recounting everything that seemed like it would eventually go against the Mets. The Dodgers were at home with Zack Greinke on the mound, the same pitcher who hadn't given up more than two runs at home since April. The Mets countered with Jacob deGrom, who had been magnificent in Game 1 but had no control from the get-go Thursday. Former Met Justin Turner was hitting everything in sight. Half of deGrom's 105 pitches were thrown with runners in scoring position, and Noah Syndergaard warmed up three times to spell him, but then only ended up pitching the seventh. Jeurys Familia was asked to get the first six-out save of his career , ahead by only a run. \nSo, a funny thing happened on the way to this inevitable defeat: It never happened. There was no seven-run outburst by the Dodgers. There was no #LOLMets bonehead play to splash across the back page of the New York tabloids, something that would encapsulate this wasted opportunity. No, this Game 5 between the Mets and Dodgers -- this beautiful, gut-twisting, life-shortening beauty of a game -- came down to a few little plays here and there, the kind of plays you merely perk up at during a regular-season game. Daniel Murphy took an extra base in the fourth and then scored on a sac fly to tie the game at 2-2 in the fourth. Murphy then cracked a solo dinger in the sixth off Greinke to give the Mets a 3-2 lead. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nThat score, against all odds, held up until the final out. Somehow, some way, deGrom was good enough for six innings and became the fourth player in MLB history to defeat two previous Cy Young Award winners in the same postseason series. The Mets won the series and advanced to their first National League Championship Series since 2006. The $300 million Dodgers went down in a hell of a fight, and now the Cubs and Mets will battle in what could be an insanely competitive NLCS. \nAll night long, things went right for the Mets. You could look at deGrom's stat line -- six innings, six hits, two earned runs, three walks, seven strikeouts -- and conclude he had a fairly pedestrian outing, at least compared to his usual output. But to watch his start and the way he escaped jam after jam, like someone skipping through a string of rattlesnake nests and not getting bit, was mind-boggling and actually somewhat ridiculous. The Dodgers, by all rights, should have knocked him out of the game for good long before his eventual exit, but deGrom found just enough control with his breaking pitches to avoid the One Big Hit that eluded Los Angeles all night long. For deGrom, being both lucky and good went hand in hand. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nThe other hero for the Mets was second baseman Daniel Murphy, who was likely playing his final game for the team had they lost. Maybe he doesn't quite want to say goodbye. Maybe he was inspired to carry this team. No matter the motivating factor, Murphy was the only true bright spot on offense. His single to lead off the fourth seemed innocuous enough, but then he went from first to third on a walk to Lucas Duda, a product of the Dodgers shifting and not leaving anyone to cover third. Murphy, in what could be the play of his seven-year career, got himself to within 90 feet of home plate with just one out. With that kind of luck, it was always preordained that someone would drive him in, and catcher Travis d'Arnaud obliged with a sac fly to right to tie the game. \nAs deGrom settled down ever so slightly, Murphy struck again the sixth, launching a booming solo homer to right that put the Mets up, 3-2, and left Greinke shaking his blond locks in dismay. No one could know that the game's scoring had come to a close, but Syndergaard's relief appearance in the seventh was a welcome change of pace for the Mets. The man called \"Thor\" threw 99 and 100 mph four-seamers with ease, and then Familia and his high-90s sinker came on to secure the final six outs. The last third of this game was, weirdly enough, anticlimactic compared to the first two-thirds, as if the baseball gods squeezed everything they could into the first 36 outs and then looked around befuddled when the tank ran dry. No Mets win is ever a fait accompli, but this was as close as they ever come. \nFor the Dodgers, it begins an offseason they had hoped would not be starting this soon. With Los Angeles possessing the highest payroll in baseball and two of the best starting pitchers in the game, it seemed that the Mets had little chance against such a behemoth, stacked with young talent throughout the lineup, veteran leadership, a quality closer and a manager with playoff experience. Instead, the Dodgers fizzled with a lack of key hits, a porous bullpen and some questionable lineup decisions. Also, as unbelievable as this might sound, the Mets' staff outpitched Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke just enough . The Dodgers threw their pair of aces at the Mets four times in five games and New York won twice. Los Angeles' margin for error was so much smaller in this series than anyone had realized, and when they needed to hold the line, they bent just enough to let the Mets break through. \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nAnd now the Mets move on to a date with the Cubs, a matchup of improbable, upstart teams that figured to be in this spot next year or the one after. \nNo matter, though. They'll both be up to this challenge, and if you think Mets-Dodgers and Cubs-Cardinals was a treat for baseball fans, this Cubs-Mets series could smash all of your expectations. Neither was the best team in the National League this year, but that hardly matters now. They are both survivors.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:28:27.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
