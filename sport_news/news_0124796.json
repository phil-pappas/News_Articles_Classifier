It's too soon to know how the axle was damaged, Weener said.\nWitnesses have said they saw the duck boat's left tire lock up Thursday as it swerved into a charter bus carrying international students over a bridge. Four North Seattle College students from Austria, China, Indonesia and Japan were killed.\n\"The left front axle was sheared off - for what reason yet, we don't know,\" Weener said at a news conference.\nInvestigators are also examining the charter bus and two other vehicles involved in the accident - a pickup truck and an SUV. Weener also said investigators would determine what the drivers of the duck boat and the charter bus were doing for the three days before the crash.\nThe federal probe is expected to take months, and Weener said \"it's way too early to say anything about a probable cause.\"\nThe investigation is being watched by other operators of the hugely popular duck boat tours.\n\"Safety and security are always a concern,\" said Cindy Brown of Boston Duck Tours. \"When anything happens in our industry, we're all acutely aware.\"\nBrown said her operation hasn't changed any procedures, but the owners and safety team would evaluate the situation after the federal investigation is complete.\nThe amphibious vehicle tours are offered throughout the United States and the world, including in Philadelphia; Austin, Texas; Miami; Ft. Lauderdale; and London.\nIt's the first time the NTSB has looked into a land crash of the amphibious vehicles, which critics say are too dangerous for city streets. The federal agency has scrutinized duck tour vehicles several times when they've been in accidents on water.\nFederal investigators will spend a week or more on site.\nState regulators also have opened an investigation, which entails inspecting all vehicle and driver records.\nThe amphibious vehicle involved in the crash - known as Duck No. 6 - underwent regular annual examinations by a federally certified inspector, most recently in 2015 and 2014, and met federal standards, Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission spokeswoman Amanda Maxwell said.\nThe state also reviews the company's fleet every few years, looking for systemic problems, Maxwell said. The last review, in December 2012, focused on a sample of the company's vehicles and did not include Duck No. 6.\n\"So far, our investigators are satisfied with the maintenance records\" of the duck tours vehicle, Maxwell said.\nMeanwhile, 15 people remain hospitalized at Harborview Medical Center, spokeswoman Susan Greggs said. One person remains in critical condition, eight are in serious condition and six in satisfactory condition, she said.\nBarb Graff, Seattle's director of the Office Emergency Management, said a private location has been established for families of the deceased and injured, where city, county and Red Cross workers are offering assistance and mental health counseling. Several hotels in Seattle are making rooms available to the families free of charge, Graff said, and Delta and Alaska airlines are helping with flights.\n\"We're doing everything we can to help families make it through the tough time,\" Graff said.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:19:58.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
