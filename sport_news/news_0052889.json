He scrambled for a 5-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter and Tyler Davis kicked a 30-yard field goal to cap the scoring. \nZander Diamont scored on a 12-yard run for the Hoosiers (4-2, 1-2 Big Ten) but completed just 9 of 17 passes for 90 yards before he was injured and replaced by third-stringer Danny Cameron in the third quarter. \nCameron didn't fare any better against Penn State's defense. Senior defensive end Carl Nassib forced two fumbles and finished with two sacks. Austin Johnson and Garrett Sickels each had a sack and the Nittany Lions (5-1, 2-0) forced six 3-and-outs. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:55:28.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
