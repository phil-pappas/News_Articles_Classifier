Abbott's office jinx 2 Texas MLB teams in one tweet? It ain't over 'til it's over. Post to Facebook Did Gov. Abbott's office jinx 2 Texas MLB teams in one tweet? It ain't over 'til it's over.  //on.wfaa.com/1RDfNym   Did Gov. Abbott's office jinx 2 Texas MLB teams in one tweet? Landon Haaf, WFAA Sports 5:07 p.m. CDT October 12, 2015 Greg Abbott \nIt ain't over 'til it's over. \nThat didn't quite resonate in the Texas governor's office on Monday. \nThe verified Twitter account of Gov. Greg Abbott's office ( @GovAbbott ) sent out a tweet congratulating the Houston Astros on a win over the Kansas City Royals in their American League Division Series. \nHouston held a four-run lead in the eighth inning with a chance to clinch the series. Whoops. @GovAbbott tweeted the @astros beat the @royals , but the game wasn&#39;t over yet! Now the Royals are winning! pic.twitter.com/6FTp73XOT1 — Ryan Wood (@RyanWoodDFW) October 12, 2015 \nThe Royals, of course, would score seven runs in the final two innings to stun the AL West runners-up and force a Game 5 in the series. \nKansas City recorded five consecutive base hits followed by an RBI groundout to start the eighth-inning rally in Houston. \nThe tweet from Abbott's office has since been deleted. \nAstros fans certainly have reason to be salty about the governor's tweet. But fans of Texas' other team could also have a beef with him. \nThe tweet, sent just five minutes before the first pitch of the Texas Rangers' Game 4 against Toronto, wished for an all-Texas ALCS. \nThings didn't get off to a good start in Arlington, as the Rangers -- who also had a chance to seal an ALDS win -- fell into a 7-0 hole in the first three innings. \nThe Rangers' downfall may not be all Abbott's fault, though. Lil' B, a rapper also known as the \"Based God,\" sent his good vibes to the Blue Jays on Twitter before Toronto's Game 3 win in Arlington. \nHis tweet granted the request of Toronto city councilman Norm Kelly to \"bless\" the Jays. @norm @BlueJays hey norm your request is granted and remember I love you and Canada! That&#39;s number one! - Lil B — Lil B THE BASEDGOD (@LILBTHEBASEDGOD) October 11, 2015 \nWhen the governor AND strangely-prophetic rappers are throwing out jinxes, it's guaranteed to be tough sledding. \nAbbott later tweeted from his personal account ( @GregAbott_TX ) that users should unfollow the account that sent the preemptive tweet, and instead follow his personal account for \"no predictions. Just support.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wfaa.com/1RDfNym TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:48:07.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
