We made some great defensive plays on our side of the net, and a lot of those long rallies went our way.” Emily Carter had nine kills and Ashley Ripplinger turned in four kills, four aces and 11 digs for the Black Tornado, which picked up five kills from Adriane McLemore. Alex Barry racked up 17 assists, 13 digs and a pair of kills. The Panthers (2-15, 2-12 SWC) got 11 assists, 10 digs and a couple of kills from Kelsey Bartlett.
