The Heisman is a fluid, nuanced dance that unfolds over three months. This time next week, their roles could reverse. \nGoff, in fact, has exactly the same opportunity to impress voters this week (Thursday night against UCLA on ESPN) that McCaffrey had last week. \nStanford's sophomore made the most of the stage with four touchdowns, 243 yards rushing (a school record) and 369 all-purpose yards, the most by a Football Bowl Subdivision player this season. \nAs a result, McCaffrey currently stands as a second-tier contender in a race dominated thus far by LSU running back Leonard Fournette. \nIn the ESPN tracking poll released Tuesday, McCaffrey was seventh, with two third-place and two fifth-place votes. To contend seriously, he will need a series of stellar performances. (The same goes for Goff). \nBut even that might not be enough. Both players -- all west coast candidates, for that matter -- face exposure and logistical challenges when it comes to the Heisman. Advertisement \nOf the more than 900 voters, the vast majority are media members. (Former winners also vote.) The Far West region, which includes Montana and the Dakotas, accounts for 16 percent of the Heisman voters despite representing nearly 25 percent of the U.S. population. \nFor players from USC, which has a national brand and seven former winners, that's not an issue. For all other west coast products, the Heisman stars must be perfectly aligned. That was the case last year with Oregon's Marcus Mariota, who had the ideal combination of preseason hype, in-season performance and likeable personality to become the first non-USC player from the west coast to win the award since Stanford's Jim Plunkett in 1970. \nExposure is also an obstacle, more for McCaffrey than for Goff, whose status as the potential No. 1 pick in the NFL draft made him a known commodity before the season. McCaffrey has played not only in the shadows but the dark: Stanford's tangle with Washington on Saturday is the fourth of five consecutive night games for the Cardinal. \nMany voters have seen only snippets of McCaffrey and some, undoubtedly, have not watched him at all or tracked his exploits closely on the Internet. (There's an old joke about the Heisman having an additional voting bloc: The deceased.) \nFor the moment, Stanford has no plans to promote McCaffrey. \n\"We're six games in; it's early,\" coach David Shaw said. \"We've been through this a lot.\" \nIndeed they have. No school has experienced more Heisman disappointment in recent years than Stanford, which had three consecutive runner-up finishes with Toby Gerhart (2009) and Andrew Luck (2010-11). \n\"There's nothing anybody can actually say that works,\" Shaw said when asked when the school might begin promoting McCaffrey. \"The only thing that works is playing great and winning games. I've studied it a lot, even when we didn't have a candidate.\" \nWinning and playing well are the central elements to any successful Heisman campaign, of course. But they aren't always enough. \nGerhart's candidacy in '09 is the closest comparison to McCaffrey's situation, because both started the season -- both started October, actually -- as Heisman afterthoughts. \nGerhart thundered into contention with a season-closing stretch of seven consecutive 100-yard games; in three of them, he topped 175. But Stanford's promotional efforts were meek and late -- too late for a candidacy trying to jump-start itself in the middle of the season. \nNor did Gerhart have the benefit of a league championship game on the final weekend of the season. He sat idle while Mark Ingram led Alabama to the SEC title. A week later, Ingram beat Gerhart in the closest Heisman race in history. (Gerhart dominated the western vote but finished behind Ingram everywhere else and was fourth in the Southwest region.) \nIt's too early to project whether history will repeat. But combine McCaffrey's lack of national name recognition with all the late kickoffs, the time zone challenges and the media vote weighted to the eastern half of the country, and Stanford might want to consider getting the word out if he's a dynamo again this week.
