By Jeff Deters jeff.deters@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — Though there won’t be a rematch of the 1985 World Series, Kansas City Royals fans could be in for a real treat during the American League Division Series. \nThe Royals will take on the Toronto Blue Jays in a rematch of the ’85 ALCS. Game 1 is set for 7:07 p.m. Friday at Kauffman Stadium. Right-hander Edinson Volquez (0-1, 4.76 ERA) will start for the Royals and right-hander Marco Estrada (1-0, 1.42 ERA) will start for the Blue Jays. \nThe Royals are in the ALCS for the second year in a row while the Blue Jays are making their first appearance since 1993 when they won the World Series. \nThe 1985 Royals team defeated the Blue Jays in seven games and then defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in the Fall Classic. While those memories are great for Hall of Famer George Brett, when asked if watching this Royals team’s success gives him more satisfaction than when he played, he had a simple answer. \n“More,” Brett said. “I have no say in what happens during the game. I have no say. I’m more nervous during the game because when you’re playing, you have a say. You can control the outcome of the game. But when you’re sitting up in the suite, you have no control. And when you have no control, you get frustrated when things are going bad and then you get so excited when things go good.” \n“When you’re playing, it’s like, ‘This is my job. This is what they’re paying me money to do.’ So that’s what makes it so much more fun. Now I have nothing to do with the success on the field. I just pray and hope and am living on the edge of my seat every pitch that something good happens.” \nThe Royals have been a recent roll, winning two straight elimination games to advance to the ALDS. Brett, who two years ago served as the team’s hitting coach for a spell, said getting to see many of the players experience consecutive trips to the ALCS also has been also been rewarding for him, but especially so for Alex Gordon. \n“It’s been great,” Brett said. “He’s a tremendous friend of mine. He’s not swinging the bat great right now, but he got a big hit (in Game 5), got a double to right field, and the next thing you know Alex Rios gets a double and he scores.” \nGordon is hitting just .235 so far this postseason, but he has had his moments. Gordon hit a home run in Game 3 against Houston, and drove in the go-ahead run in Game 4 as well. \n“The more Alex goes out there and continues to battle and works on his stuff … hopefully by Friday his stroke will be back where it normally is and that’ll give us a better chance to win the series. But he battles.” \nThe Blue Jays won the season series 4-3 over the Royals. The Royals took two of three in July at before losing three of four in Toronto. The last game of the series at Rogers Centre made for some good theater as tempers flared and both benches cleared — a result of a couple bean balls that went both ways. \n“They’ll remember what happened,” Brett said of both teams. \nIn the 1985 ALCS, the Blue Jays had home-field advantage, and Brett and the Royals dropped the first two games on the road and trailed 3-1 before rallying. \nThis year, though, the Royals have home-field advantage, a reward for having the best record in the AL. Late in the season, Toronto briefly caught the Royals and held that advantage before the Royals won five straight to close out the regular season to get it back. \nNow, just like the ’85 team was at this point, the Royals are eight wins away from a world championship. And while Brett desperately wants to see the Royals capture another crown, it won’t have quite the same feel to it. \n“I don’t think it would mean as much to me as in ’85 because when you’re on the field, there’s no better feeling,” Brett said. “Playing in the World Series, I was never so nervous in my life. Last year, Game 7 of the World Series, I was pretty calm. \n“The wins seem to feel pretty good, and the losses don’t really hurt as bad as when you’re in the front office than when you’re a player. That’s just because it’s kind of a catch 22. You have no say in what happens on the field. \n“However, you’re pulling for these guys so hard because I’ve known a lot of them since their first day in the Royals organization and I want them to do well. I’ve been involved in this organization since 1971, and I’ve lived in Kansas City for 42 years. And I know what a win does for this city.” \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:03:44.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
