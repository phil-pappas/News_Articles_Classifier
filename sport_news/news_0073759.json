While the ODI team selection may not have any surprises apart from selectors checking in on Ravichandran Ashwin's injury status, the bowling unit for Test matches can be a tricky selection issue with Ishant suffering a hamstring injury during Ranji Trophy match against Haryana. \nMost of the 15-men, who clinched a 2-1 series win on Sri Lankan soil after 22 years, are likely find a berth in the two matches in Mohali and Bengaluru. \nMurali Vijay, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Cheteshwar Pujara and Rohit Sharma automatically select themselves among the batsmen. The reserve batsman should be KL Rahul, who scored a century along with string of low scores in the Sri Lanka series. \nBengal's Wriddhiman Saha, who missed the final Lanka Test due to a hamstring injury, is expected to be back with the big gloves although Naman Ojha is close on his heels. \nThe three pacers set to be selected are Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Varun Aaron. \nWith no quality all-rounders in sight, Stuart Binny may just retain his place after a decent outing in the final Test against Sri Lanka. The pace battery though will be sans Ishant, who not only serves his one-match ban in Mohali, but will also race against time to get fit from his hamstring injury he picked up during his Ranji game in Delhi. \nThe selectors may just keep him in the squad expecting that he gets fit. \nEven the spin force is awaiting the news on Ashwin's fitness after the in-form bowler suffered a side strain post bowling just 4.4 overs at Green Park in the first ODI. \nBowling all-rounder Ravindra Jadeja, who has bagged 24 wickets in two doemstic games for his Ranji team Saurashtra, might just get lucky if Ashwin is not declared fit. \nJadeja has always been a handful on Indian conditions. \nSenior pros Harbhajan Singh and Amit Mishra are also expected to retain their places. In the limited-overs though, the Mahendra Singh Dhoni-led team has seen contrasting fortunes in the first two ODIs against South Africa, but national selectors may still show faith on the current squad for the remaining two matches. \nAfter the batting fell short of five runs while chasing 304 despite Rohit Sharma's gutsy 150 at Green Park, the bowling did well to defend a 247-run score in Indore. \nWith Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Umesh Yadav sharing the new ball, the thought of adding another pacer went up in smoke after Ishant sustained hamstring injury. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:44:39.881+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
