(Ron Jenkins / Getty Images) Associated Press \nWACO, Texas -- Shock Linwood ran for 171 yards with a touchdown, and caught a pass for another score as second-ranked Baylor beat Iowa State, 45-27, for its FBS-best 20th consecutive home win while ending another impressive streak Saturday. \nOn a rainy day along the Brazos River, the Bears (7-0, 4-0 Big 12) were held under 60 points for the first time in six games. The only other NCAA team with five consecutive 60-point games was Oklahoma in 2008. \nCorey Coleman had two more touchdown catches, his sixth consecutive game with multiple scores pushing his FBS-leading total to 18. He also surpassed Kendall Wright's school record for career touchdowns with his 31st. \nColeman had a 36-yard score on Baylor's opening drive, then had a downfield block that helped quarterback Seth Russell break free on a 37-yard TD run for a quick 14-0 lead. Coleman caught a 12-yarder from Jarrett Stidham in the closing minutes. \nIowa State fell to 2-5, 1-3. \nNo. 23 Duke 45, Virginia Tech 43 (4 OTs) \nBLACKSBURG, Va. -- Thomas Sirk threw four touchdown passes and ran for a 2-point conversion in the fourth overtime to lift the Blue Devils to victory. \nSirk hit Erich Schneider with a 25-yard TD pass on the first play of the fourth overtime, after the Hokies had scored and missed the mandatory 2-point attempt. Sirk then rolled right and cut upfield, giving the Blue Devils (6-1, 3-0) the victory in the longest game in Atlantic Coast Conference history. \nVirginia Tech (3-5, 1-3) lost for the fourth time in five games, and for the third time this season at home. The Hokies, getting the ball first in the fourth extra period, seemed in good shape to either win or extend it, but after Travon McMillians's 1-yard touchdown run, Michael Brewer's 2-point conversion pass to Isaiah Ford was broken up by Deondre Singleton just inside the goal line. \nUSC 42, No. 3 Utah 24 \nCameron Smith returned the second of his three interceptions 54 yards for a touchdown, and USC knocked Utah from the unbeaten ranks with a 42-24 victory Saturday night. \nRonald Jones II, Justin Davis and fullback Soma Vainuku rushed for scores to help the Trojans (4-3, 2-2 Pac-12) snap their two-game skid and earn a victory for interim Coach Clay Helton in his debut game at the Coliseum. \nCody Kessler passed for 264 yards and a touchdown and rushed for another score, while JuJu Smith-Schuster had eight catches for 143 yards and a fourth-quarter touchdown that wrapped up the win. \nBritain Covey caught two touchdown passes for the Utes (6-1, 3-1), whose eight-game winning streak ended. \nSmith, USC's dynamic freshman linebacker, led a fine defensive performance by picking off Travis Wilson's throws and making three returns for a combined 122 yards, including his scoring romp down the USC sideline 1:07 before halftime. \nNo. 1 Ohio State 49, Rutgers 7 \nPISCATAWAY, N.J. — J.T. Barrett threw three touchdown passes and ran for two scores in his first start of the season, leading Ohio State to victory against Rutgers on Saturday night and ensuring at least two weeks of quarterback stability for the Buckeyes. \nOhio State (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) extended its winning streak to 21 games, best in the nation, and heads into its off week with no doubt who the starting QB will be when Minnesota comes to Columbus on Nov. 7. \nIt will be a nice change for coach Urban Meyer, who started Cardale Jones in the first seven games of the season before making the switch to Barrett this week. Facing one of the worst defenses in the Big Ten, Barrett was near flawless. He was 14 for 18 for 223 yards and ran for 101 yards on 13 carries. Jones entered in the fourth quarter when the score was 49-0. \nRutgers (3-4, 1-3) missed a short field goal on its first possession and didn't get past the Ohio State 40 again until late in the fourth quarter. \nNo. 5 LSU 48, Western Kentucky 20 \nBATON ROUGE, La. — Brandon Harris passed for a career-high 286 yards, with two of his three scoring passes going for more than 50 yards, and LSU beat Western Kentucky on Saturday night. \nLeonard Fournette ran for 150 yards and a short touchdown on a soggy field, giving him 1,352 yards rushing and 15 TDs this season. \nThe Hilltoppers (6-2) were as close as 17-13 on Brandon Doughty's 39-yard touchdown pass to Antwane Grant in the third quarter, but LSU (7-0) scored the next 17 points. \nMalachi Dupre caught a 55-yard scoring pass on LSU's opening series. Tigers freshman Tyron Johnson made a tough downfield catch over defender Wonderful Terry, then scampered about 20 yards for his 61-yard score in the third quarter. \nDoughty, who came in averaging 387 yards passing, finished with 325 yards, three touchdowns and one interception against LSU. \nNo. 6 Clemson 58, Miami 0 \nMIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Sixth-ranked Clemson handed Miami its worst defeat in the program's 90-year history to remain unbeaten. \nDeshaun Watson threw for a touchdown and ran for another, while Wayne Gallman rushed for 118 yards and a touchdown for the Tigers (7-0, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference). \nStacy Coley had eight catches for 54 yards for Miami (4-3, 1-2), in a game that could doom whatever chance Hurricanes coach Al Golden had of keeping his job much longer. There was booing and a “Fire Golden” chant from the sparse crowd even before the first quarter ended, and the stands were largely empty by the midpoint of the third quarter. \nUntil Saturday, the worst loss in Miami history was a 70-14 defeat to Texas A&M on Dec. 8, 1944. It was Clemson's largest win over an FBS opponent since an 82-24 win over Wake Forest on Oct. 31, 1981. \nNo. 7 Michigan State 52, Indiana 26 \nEAST LANSING, Mich. -- Connor Cook threw for 398 yards and four touchdowns, and No. 7 Michigan State remained undefeated. \nCook fell just short of the school record of 400 yards passing, set by Bill Burke in 1999 against Michigan. The Spartans (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) never trailed in the second half of this one, but it was touch and go until Cook found R.J. Shelton for a 10-yard touchdown pass with 4:57 remaining to give Michigan State a 12-point lead. \nThe Spartans then tacked on two more TDs to avoid an upset a week after their unforgettable win at Michigan. Michigan State has won 12 in a row for the first time since 1956. This run is tied for the third-longest winning streak in school history. \nIndiana (4-4, 0-4) was outscored 24-0 in the fourth quarter. \nNo. 8 Alabama 19, Tennessee 14 \nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- Derrick Henry's 14-yard touchdown run with 2:24 left lifted No. 8 Alabama past Tennessee. \nAlabama's aggressive defense then recorded two straight sacks and Ryan Anderson knocked the ball loose from Joshua Dobbs to preserve the win and the Crimson Tide's national championship hopes. \nAlabama (7-1, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) got plenty of help, with Tennessee (3-4, 1-3) missing three long field goal attempts. \nThe Vols took the lead on Jalen Hurd's 12-yard scoring run with 5:49 left. Alabama overwhelmed the 15-point underdogs from there. \nQuarterback Jake Coker moved Alabama downfield thanks to athletic catches by ArDarius Stewart and Calvin Ridley. Then he turned it over to Henry. \nDobbs and Tennessee managed a first down before the sacks. Anderson jarred the ball loose and A'Shawn Robinson recovered on the second one. \nAlabama has won the last nine meetings, and the Vols have dropped 24 straight against Top 10 teams. \nGeorgia Tech 22, No. 9 Florida State 16 \nATLANTA (AP) — Lance Austin returned a blocked field goal 78 yards for a touchdown on the final play of the game, giving Georgia Tech a stunning upset of No. 9 Florida State on Saturday night. \nRoberto Aguayo, one of the most accurate kickers in the country, attempted a 56-yard field goal to win the game for the Seminoles (6-1, 4-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) with six seconds remaining. But the kick was low, and Rod Rook-Chuncong managed to get a hand on it. \nWhile most of the Georgia Tech players celebrated, Austin went back to retrieve the ball, rolling along inside the 25-yard line. \nAt first, he seemed hesitant to pick it up. But then he did, taking off the other way in front of the Georgia Tech bench. He avoided Aguayo's diving attempt, then cut back on the final guy who had a shot at him to win the game for Georgia Tech (3-5, 1-4). \nNo. 14 Oklahoma State 58, Kansas 10 \nSTILLWATER, Okla. -- Backup quarterback J.W. Walsh ran for three touchdowns and passed for two more to help the Cowboys win only hours after a fatal crash near the stadium during the school's homecoming festivities. \nThree people were killed and dozens injured when a woman suspected of driving under the influence plowed a car into a crowd at the homecoming parade. Oklahoma State considered postponing the game, but in the end, opted to go ahead with it. \nThe flag at Boone Pickens Stadium was lowered to half-staff and Cowboys players knelt down on the field and prayed before the coin flip. \nMason Rudolph completed 20 of 26 passes for 305 yards and had a touchdown for Oklahoma State (7-0, 4-0 Big 12). Kansas (0-7, 0-4) lost its 10th straight game overall and 36th on the road. \nNo. 24 Mississippi 23, No. 15 Texas A&M 3 \nOXFORD, Miss. — Chad Kelly threw for 241 yards and two touchdowns and Mississippi used a dominant defense to beat Texas A&M on Saturday night. \nOle Miss (6-2, 3-1 Southeastern Conference) bounced back from last week's loss to Memphis. Laquon Treadwell caught five passes for 102 yards and a touchdown and Jaylen Walton ran for 97 yards. \nTexas A&M (5-2, 2-2) has lost two straight. Sophomore Kyle Allen completed just 12 of 34 passes for 88 yards before being replaced by Jake Hubenak early in the fourth quarter. \nOle Miss jumped out to a 16-3 lead by halftime and put the game out of reach with a 58-yard touchdown pass from Kelly to Treadwell with 9:16 left in the third quarter. \nOle Miss then relied on its defense to coast to a surprisingly one-sided win. \nThe victory was vital for Ole Miss as it continues to control its own fate in the Western Division thanks to a win over Alabama in September. The Rebels are still a game behind first-place LSU, but host the Tigers on Nov. 21 in Oxford. \nNo. 17 Oklahoma 63, Texas Tech 27 \nNORMAN, Okla. -— Samaje Perine ran for 201 yards and four touchdowns and helped Sooners quarterback Baker Mayfield top his old team. \nMayfield transferred from Tech after his freshman season in 2013 and had to sit out last year because the school blocked his ability to play right away. \nMayfield completed 15 of 22 passes for 212 yards and two touchdowns. Joe Mixon ran for 154 yards and two scores, and the Sooners (6-1, 3-1 Big 12) ran for 405 yards. \nTexas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes passed for 233 yards and ran for 58, but threw four interceptions. DeAndre Washington ran for 94 yards and a touchdown for the Red Raiders (5-3, 2-3). \nNo. 19 Toledo 51, Massachusetts 35 \nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Phillip Ely recovered from a poor start and threw four of his five touchdown passes in the second half as No. 19 Toledo stormed back from an 18-point deficit for the win. \nEly was intercepted three times in the first half, but the Rockets (7-0, 4-0 MAC), and are off to their best start since 1997. He completed 26 of 47 passes for 355 yards. \nTerry Swanson ran 21 times for 117 yards and a score for the Rockets, who entered with their highest ranking in Top 25 since climbing to No. 18 in ‘97. \nBlake Frohnapfel completed 27 of 49 for 240 yards and four TDs for UMass (1-6, 0-3 MAC). The game was played at Gillette Stadium, home of the defending Super Bowl champion New England Patriots. \nNo. 21 Houston 59, Central Florida 10 \nORLANDO, Fla. -- Kenneth Farrow ran for 167 yards and three touchdowns and No. 21 Houston remained undefeated with the victory over winless Central Florida. \nThe Cougars (7-0, 4-0 AAC) scored 24 points in a mid-game span of 3 1/2 minutes and won for the fifth time by 21 points or more. \nHouston cornerback Brandon Wilson scored on an 85-yard return of a fumble on the third play of the game, but the Cougars fell behind 10-7 before rallying late in the first half and turning the game into a rout in the third quarter. \nFarrow's 26-yard touchdown run gave Houston the lead with 2:26 left in the half, and interceptions by William Jackson III and Donald Gage set up a TD and a field goal in the final 50 seconds. \nTristan Payton scored UCF's touchdown on a 46-yard pass from Justin Holman, but the Golden Knights (0-8, 0-4) had four turnovers and gained only 105 yards after the first quarter \nNo. 25 Pittsburgh 23, Syracuse 20 \nSYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Chris Blewitt kicked a 25-yard field goal as time expired to lift the Panthers to the win. \nThe Panthers (6-1, 4-0 ACC) have now won four of five on the road, with their only loss at Iowa on a 57-yard field goal on the final play of the game. \nSyracuse (3-4, 1-2 ACC) has lost four straight. \nQadree Ollison ran for 98 yards and two touchdowns for the Panthers. \nWith the game tied at 20 and time winding down, Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi called for a fake punt on fourth down near midfield. Punter Ryan Winslow hit Matt Galambos for 12 yards and a first down. \nOllison took care of the rest, gaining 26 yards on seven straight carries to set up the winning kick. \nFreshman quarterback Eric Dungey kept the Orange in the game going 21 of 30 for 210 yards and two scores. He threw two interceptions after getting hurt early in the third quarter. \nArkansas 54, Auburn 46 \nFAYETTEVILLE, Ark. -- Brandon Allen threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to Drew Morgan on the first play of the fourth overtime, also converting on the 2-point conversion, to lead Arkansas to a 54-46 win over Auburn on Saturday. \nThe win is the first for the Razorbacks (3-4, 2-2 Southeastern Conference) over former offensive coordinator and current Tigers coach Gus Malzahn in three games, and it keeps Arkansas' bowl hopes alive. \nAlex Collins rushed for 105 yards and a touchdown on 25 carries to lead Arkansas, topping 100 yards rushing for the fourth time in five games. \nSean White was 19-of-32 passing for 254 yards for Auburn (4-3, 1-3), which had its two-game winning streak snapped. The game is the longest in major college football this season, according to STATS. \nTexas 23, Kansas State 9 \nAUSTIN, Texas -- Backup quarterback Tyrone Swoopes scored three touchdowns for thes Longhorns in game played in heavy rain storm. \nSwoopes, a 244-pound junior who started last season, is now used primarily in short yardage situations. His first two touchdowns were on short runs, but his last one, which secured victory, covered 10 yards with 1:47 remaining. Swoopes ran for 13 and 29 yards on the previous two plays. \nTexas (3-4, 2-2 Big 12) rushed for 274 yards, maintaining a strength the Longhorns created with 313 yards on the ground — its most since 2013 — during a victory against Oklahoma on Oct. 10. \nTailback Johnathan Gray led Texas with 103 yards against Kansas State (3-4, 0-4). \nCharles Jones, Kansas State's junior running back, rushed for a career-best 122 yards. Jones gained 87 in the second half. \nKansas State has lost four consecutive games for the first time since 2005. \nNorthwestern 30, Nebraska 28 \nLINCOLN, Neb. -- Clayton Thorson's 37-yard touchdown pass to Dan Vitale and Jack Mitchell's third field goal gave Northwestern an eight-point lead in the fourth quarter and the Wildcats hung on to win at Nebraska. \nThe Wildcats (6-2, 2-2 Big Ten) bounced back from consecutive losses to Michigan and Iowa in which they were outscored 78-10 and handed Nebraska (3-5, 1-3) its fifth loss by five points or less. \nMitchell's 27-yard field goal put Northwestern up 30-22, but the Huskers drove 75 yards in eight plays to pull within two points. But Tommy Armstrong's two-point pass to Stanley Morgan Jr. fell incomplete, and Northwestern's offense was able to run out the final 4:18. Thorson passed for 177 yards and ran for a career-high 126, with 117 coming on two carries that led to scores. Armstrong passed for 291 yards and a touchdown. \nLouisville 17, Boston College 14 \nLOUISVILLE, Ky. -- Lamar Jackson ran for a short touchdown and passed for 230 yards, and Louisville's defense made a big stand late to preserve the win. \nBoston College had a final chance after recovering a fumble at midfield with 2:18 remaining, but the Eagles turned it over on downs when Troy Flutie was sacked for a 4-yard loss. The play capped a dominant defensive effort for Louisville (3-4, 2-2 Atlantic Coast Conference), which recorded eight sacks, held BC to minus-14 yards rushing and just 79 overall. \nLouisville tied for the eighth-lowest yardage allowed since 1962. The Eagles (3-5, 0-5) forced four turnovers, including Elijah Robinson's 12-yard touchdown return of a blocked punt and a fumble return setting up another TD. They also posted seven sacks and held the Cardinals scoreless in the second half, but couldn't take advantage on a cool, soggy day. \nNavy 31, Tulane 14 \nAnnapolis, Md. -- Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds ran for a pair of touchdowns and the Midshipmen forced three straight turnovers in the second half for a 31-14 victory over Tulane on Saturday. \nReynolds is now just two shy of the NCAA record for rushing touchdowns set by former Wisconsin tailback Montee Ball (77) from 2009-2012. \nNavy (5-1, 3-0 American Athletic Conference) entered the game ranked third nationally with 335.4 yards rushing per game but was held to just 133 as Tulane stacked nine players in the box. \nTulane (2-5, 1-3) got down to Navy's 2-yard line early in the fourth quarter but a fumble by Tanner Lee was recovered by Navy's Will Anthony. It was the 13th straight game the Midshipmen forced a turnover. Lorentez Barbour had another big defensive play for Navy, intercepting Lee at the Tulane 36. That later set up a 1-yard run by Reynolds. \nAir Force 42, Fresno State 14 \nAIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo. -- Quarterback Karson Roberts rushed for four touchdowns and caught another on a trick play, helping Air Force overcome a sluggish start to beat the Bulldogs. \nRoberts' five total touchdowns ties for the second-most in school history, one behind the mark set by QB Dee Dowis in 1989. \nIn addition to four short scoring runs, Roberts also hauled in a 20-yard TD pass from receiver Jalen Robinette to help the Falcons (4-3, 3-1 Mountain West) roll to their 10th straight home win. \nFresno State (2-6, 1-4) jumped out to a 14-0 lead on long runs by Marteze Waller and Dustin Garrison, only to have the Falcons respond with 42 unanswered points. \nBryan Driskell finished with 144 yards rushing for Air Force and Jacobi Owens added 137, along with a score. Even without injured fullbacks Shayne Davern and D.J. Johnson, the Falcons still rushed for 458 yards. \nRice 38, Army 31 \nHOUSTON -- A 13-yard pass from Driphus Jackson to Zach Wright is what Rice needed in the end to get a win at Rice Stadium. \nThe Owls (4-3) have now won four-straight against Army, while improving their home record, winning 14 of the last 16 games played at Rice Stadium \nAfter Army (2-6) tied the game with 2:13 left on a 20-yard field goal, Rice had enough time for one final drive. \nDriving through the rain Jackson, who finished 20-for-30 for 267 yards and two touchdowns, led the Owls on a seven-play, 75-yard game-winning drive in 1:49. \nThe Black Knights mounted a comeback in the game with its own rushing attack - racking up 378 yards by the end. Black Knight's quarterback A.J. Schurr finishing with 23 carries for 117 yards and a touchdown, while Aaron Kemper had 14 carries for 129 yards. \nHarvard 42, Princeton 7 \nCAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Scott Hosch threw for a career-high 437 yards and two touchdowns, and ran for another score, to lead the Crimson. It was the third-highest single-game passing total in Harvard. \nHosch opened the scoring with a 2-yard run early in the second quarter for Princeton (6-0, 3-0 Ivy League) and found Ben Braunecker for a 5-yard TD to give the Crimson the lead for good at 14-7 before half. \nPaul Stanton Jr. had two third-quarter rushing touchdowns, and Hosch found Andrew Fischer for 14 yards to make it 35-7. Stanton finished with 119 yards rushing and has 36 career rushing touchdowns, second-most in school history. \nChad Kanoff threw for 203 yards with one interception for Princeton (4-2, 1-2). \nPrinceton's score came on John Lovett's 2-yard touchdown pass to Nick Peabody at the end of an 11-play, 70-yard drive. It was the first touchdown against the Crimson's defense in 12 quarters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:50:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:32:00.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
