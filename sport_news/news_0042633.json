His shutout streak stands at 132 minutes and five seconds. \n“I just feel the more I play the better I feel and the more confident I get,” said Neuvirth, the first goalie to start his Flyers career with back-to-back shutouts in his first two starts since Jeff Hackett in 2003. “Just come into the game, come relaxed and I think to ‘just have fun and trust yourself.’ I feel good.” \nThese days, everyone in orange and black seems to feel pretty good. The Flyers have now won 12 consecutive home games against the Blackhawks in the regular season. The last time they lost to the Blackhawks in that scenario, Scott Laughton was 2 years old. \n“Pretty impressive what (Neuvirth has) done,” Laughton said. “He’s stepped in and done a hell of a job for us, so kudos for him.” \nWednesday night, the Flyers played like they were the Blackhawks, the team that allowed the second fewest goals last season. \nAt 5:35 of the middle stanza, Sam Gagner opened the scoring, tallying on the power play with a shot from the high right circle that tipped off a Blackhawk before getting past goalie Corey Crawford for his first goal as a Flyer. \n“I just want to contribute to wins,” said Gagner, who sat out the first two games as a healthy scratch. “It’s a big thing. I’m happy to help out in a win. I want to keep it going here.” \nThe goal seemed to take a weight off for the Flyers and put the Blackhawks on their heels. A few minutes later, Laughton got the inside edge on Brent Seabrook and had the puck. In on a breakaway, Laughton smartly drew the puck away from the defender, forcing him to take a hooking penalty. \nOn the ensuing power play, Neuvirth was called upon to keep the lead for the Flyers. Future Hall of Famer Marian Hossa found the puck and darted in alone. Neuvirth patiently waited for the Blackhawks star to make the first move and stoned him with a right pad save. \n“Obviously I have respect for him, but I was just trying to stay patient and wait for him to do the first move,” Neuvirth said. “My read was that he was going 5-hole or blocker. It was a huge save for us and right after we made it 2-0 so that was a really big save.” \nLater in the period, the Flyers’ efforts paid off again. Michael Raffl ripped a slapshot high and wide of the Chicago net and the rebound caused some commotion in front, drawing Seabrook away from a streaking Claude Giroux. The Flyers captain, in his 500th game, potted the rebound. \nLast year, it took Giroux 36 home games to score an even-strength goal. Knocking it out in home game No. 2 will certainly take a load off. \nIn the third period, the Flyers tested their penalty kill. They had three infractions in the final period —VandeVelde for holding the stick, Ryan White for slashing and Radko Gudas for delay of game. \nThe Flyers killed them all off, including 23 seconds of two-man disadvantage. They have now erased 12 consecutive penalties. \n“They came a little harder and Neuvy had to make some great saves,” said Pierre-Edouard Bellemare, one of the Flyers’ top penalty killers, “but it’s normal. We were leading. That’s the way it has to be.” \nMatt Read’s insurance goal with 2:35 left put the final nail in the coffin. The Flyers have a winning record, which hasn’t happened this early in a season since 2011, and their goaltending has been spot-on. \nWhen Mason returns, coach Dave Hakstol may have a tough decision to make. \n“I’m just going day-by-day and work hard and every opportunity I get I want to do my best and if I do well I will get more ice time,” Neuvirth said. “It’s up to me and how well I do.” \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com . 2 CONNECT 12 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1LuNiBU TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:42:40.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
