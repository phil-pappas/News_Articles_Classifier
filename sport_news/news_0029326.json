Last night, the best of the best from Boston’s college startup scene duked it out at the Beantown Throwdown . But only one venture - PICCPerfect - came out as the ultimate winner. The competition, which was organized by MIT Enterprise Forum of Cambridge as part of HUBweek, allowed one student-led company from 9 nearby schools present their pitches. The crowd then used pseudo money to vote on their pick for the most promising venture. From an Internet-age word processor to a cinematograph droid control system, all of college-based startups that presented deserved serious props, as far as I’m concerned. PICCPerfect, which makes stylish yet functional PICC line covers for folks with chronic illnesses, impressed the most people and it came out victorious. Giving confidence to those with chronic illnesses \nEmily Levy, CEO and Co-Founder of PICCPerfect, is a Senior at Babson. As she pitched, it was clear that she’s trying to solve a problem near and dear to her with her startup’s products. \"There are products available, but there is no brand. We want to become the brand.” She has had Severe Chronic Lyme Disease for the past 8 years. As part of treatment, she had to have a PICC line in her arm, so she could receive IV medications for 6 months. That was during her sophomore year at Babson. Imagine having to deal with not only the normal stresses of college, but also intense treatments and a constant reminder that you’re sick attached to your arm for months at a time. \n“A lot of people drop out of school,” Levy told me. “But I didn’t want to do that because I’d be depressed not being in school. I knew that for my own mental health, I would have to stay.” \nFrom her personal experiences, Levy knows that trying to cover up PICC lines is troublesome. Most existing products on the market are either unattractive or just not practical. So she and her fellow Babson Co-Founder, Maria del Mar Gomez, did something about it. \n“My own situation was a big part of it,” Levy described. “But also, Babson trains us to be entrepreneurs. I always knew I’d be an entrepreneur. So when we saw a gap in the market, we went for it.” \nSo far, their PICC line covers have already been generating a buzz from people undergoing treatments and from health professionals who also recognize the need. Both Levy and Gomez explained that there’s a whole community of people living with chronic illnesses who can regain their confidence with PICCPerfect’s products. \n“The mental peace is as important as the treatment itself,” Levy explained.

Gomez told me that they’re now coming up with children’s sizes, as well as adding covers with different design and color options. From there, they also plan on putting out other practical products, such as a shower sleeve. “We want to create an umbrella company for all of these different lines of products,” Gomez said. Levy added, “It’s an emotional thing, but there’s a real need there, too. There are products available, but there is no brand. We want to become the brand.” With their winnings - which include over $10k in legal services and 4 months of shared office space - PICCPerfect will have the resources to get steps closer to reaching that goal.
