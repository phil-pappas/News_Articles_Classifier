The New Democrats are at 19.7 per cent.\nThe margin of error for the survey of 800 respondents is 3.7 percentage points.\nA minority government in the 338-seat Parliament appears likely no matter which party wins the most seats.\nThat would mean the winning party would have a shaky hold on power and need to rely on another party to pass legislation.\nHarper has said he'll step down as Conservative leader if his party loses. â€”AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:09:53.819+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
