Proprietor Keith Hunter has spent the best of the past year redeveloping the property and turning it into a first-rate, family oriented, practice facility which boasts a state-of-the-art driving range that features the world class automated POWER TEE teeing system. It also provides green grass hitting bays and sand traps for short game practice.\nAccording to POWER TEE CEO Martin Wyeth, “POWER TEE is delighted to extend its relationship and agreement with the Armory Golf Center or more importantly with Keith Hunter. His facility and its ideals are so in alignment with the PGA’s vision of how to keep golfers in the game. Our companies completely complement each other.”\nThe Armory Golf Center sits prestigiously on 20-acres which are brightly lit for nighttime fun. An 18-hole miniature golf course provides an atmosphere for the entire family as the clubhouse invites everybody in. It features free Wi-Fi, flat screen televisions, food and beverages as well as after hour drinks.\nAccording to Hunter, “When we redeveloped this property the objective was to integrate the best possible instruction possible with the best practice facility possible and POWER TEE was a part of the plan. This automated teeing system allows our golfers to repeat their swings without any interruptions or re-teeing which provides the best practice possible plus our golfers love it. We’ve been told repeatedly that the POWER TEE hitting stations are more fun to hit off than the regular mats which contributes to our ‘entertainment’ factor here at Armory Golf Center. Additionally, our golfers hit more balls than we imagined which helps our bottom line.”\nThe POWER TEE automated teeing system elevates any and all practice facilities as it combines the finest synthetic hitting mats which prevent jarring with a teeing system with multiple tee heights which not only improves a golfer’s swing but transforms an ordinary driving range to an extraordinary driving range.\nInstructors appreciate the “Automatic” instruction as they don’t have to constantly correct the grip, stance, or alignment. Students swing away and get better – FASTER.\nAbout POWER TEE, the Automatic Choice:\nPOWER TEE was founded by company CEO Martin Wyeth in 1996 to design, develop and promote automatic teeing. There are hundreds of POWER TEE systems in 15 different countries in operation. And as of today, Wyeth’s vision is a reality with more than 6,000,000 balls teed up daily with a POWER TEE automated system.\nPOWER TEE is found at some of the best practice facilities in the world such as St Andrews, the Belfry, Wentworth Club and the superb Dromoland Castle in Ireland. This is in addition to over 300 quality driving ranges around the UK, Europe and now in the USA.\nThe POWER TEE automated teeing system is especially popular with juniors, ladies, seniors and beginners, POWER TEE is an excellent way to attract new players to the game, and keep them in it. The POWER TEE has been proven to increase ball sales where correctly implemented, and is the most powerful improvement one can add to a range.\nPOWER TEE’s phenomenal success is a result of its deep seated commitment to quality and service combined with the fact that golfers love POWER TEE, they hit more balls per hour while on the range, and are willing to travel further and pay more for the privilege to use POWER TEE.\nKey Facts on POWER TEE:\n NO upfront capital cost Installed in over 300 ranges Operates in 15 countries Tees up more than 6,000,000 balls per day Benefits to golfer: o improve swing\no building confidence\no maintaining stance\no developing rhythm\no muscle memory\no swing grooving\nAwards & Accreditations:\n Queen’s Award for Enterprise: Innovation – 2009 Wiltshire Business of the Year for Industrial Design & Engineering.
