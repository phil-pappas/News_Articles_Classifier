The Baylor Bears are in the race for a top playoff spot in college football. Going into week 4 of the 2015 football season, the Waco, Texas team is relying on some important factors to succeed.\nThe predictions include the potential of Seth Russel, a 6-foot, 220-pound junior. Considered one of the best quarterbacks in college football, according to the author, Russel completed 48-of-85 passes for 804 yards, plus three touchdowns, last season. The article points to him and the Baylor offense to be in the top five for points this season as well.\nPredictions also cover Baylor’s defense. Shawn Oakman, a six-foot-eight defensive who became an Internet sensation last year. A few details on Oakman’s performance and capabilities are mentioned, along with his secondaries, cornerbacks Xavien Howard and Ryan Reid.\nThere’s also speculation as to whether Baylor University will make the college football playoffs. The Baylor Bears were close in 2014, but even with a tough 2015 schedule they are favored. Playing with a vengeance this year, they face a three game stretch of Oklahoma and at TCU in November. The author predicts they have a good chance of ending the season in the top 4 by winning two out of three of these games.\nAnother suggestion is that Russell may seek to prove the team stands to benefit from losing Bryce Petty. These and other factors expected to impact the season are explained in more detail.
