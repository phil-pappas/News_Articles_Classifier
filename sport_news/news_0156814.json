Hunt scored the first goal in the Heat’s 4-1 preseason victory over Bakersfield in front of a crowd of 2,037 at Stockton Arena. It was the final exhibition contest for the team, and one of the last chances for players to earn a spot on the Heat and playing time. Hunt, the longtime fan favorite for the departed Stockton Thunder of the ECHL, was invited to training camp by the Heat on a professional tryout (PTO) contract. Two other former Thunder members are in camp: goaltender Kent Simpson, Friday’s winning goalie, and defenseman Ryan Constant, who suited up on Thursday in San Jose but didn’t play against the Condors. Hunt, 27, beat Bakersfield goalie Ty Rimmer for an unassisted goal 4 minutes, 7 seconds into the game. In Thursday’s 4-2 win against the Barracuda, he had two assists and got the better of a fight with San Jose forward Alex Gallant. “I feel like I gave my all out there and had a couple of good games,” Hunt said. “I left it all on the on the ice. I really tried to stress my hard work out there, and I think I worked hard the last two games.” Heat coach Ryan Huska said Hunt was impressive. “He’s had two very good games,” Huska said. “He’s done a good job, and he’s playing the way he needs to play.” Simpson, 23, is battling Eric Hartzell for a goalie position with Jon Gillies, who will make the roster. Hartzell had 30 saves in San Jose, and Simpson played well, stopping 15 shots. He only allowed a shorthanded goal to Kyle Platzer in the second period. “I thought he was good,” Huska said. “He wasn’t overly tested (on Friday), but when they did have their flurries, he made the save that he needed. Hatzell had a good games for us, and I thought Kent answered the bell.” Simpson at times went through long spans without seeing a shot, but said he stayed alert. “Sometimes those games are tough to stay in when you are not getting a ton of action, but you have to be ready,” Simpson said. Stockton also had goals from Kenny Agostino and Austin Carroll as it built a 3-0 lead in the first period. Turner Elson added a goal for Stockton in the third. Their was a nasty brawl late in the second period which involved several players. Bakersfield forward Kale Kessy, who fought earlier with Turner, drew roughing, fighting and unsportsmanlike penalties and two game misconducts, ending his night. He finished with 36 penalty minutes in the game.   @ScottLinesburgh.
