After making a loop around the building complex, they gathered by the rose garden, where they were joined by non-Latino community members, representatives from the Sierra Club, Elders for a Sustainable Future, and public figures like state Senator Martin Quezada.\n\"Climate change, clean air, clean water are Latino issues, some of the most important Latino issues,\" Quezada told the crowd. \"I have your back. I'm going to be here fighting back for clean climate, clean air, clean water.\"\nOne reason climate change is an important issue for Latinos is that a high percentage of Hispanic children suffer from asthma.\nThe crowd reacted to Quezada's remarks with another round of chants: \"We're firin' up, can't take it no more!\"\nEXPAND Miriam Wasser Sandy Bahr, director of the Arizona Sierra Club, told the youth in the crowd that their presence renewed her faith in the ability of people to make change.\n\"It made me feel so optimistic and excited when I could hear your voices several blocks away, coming to the capital to tell Governor Ducey to act on climate change,\" she said, unable to contain a wide smile.\nRelated Stories National People's Climate Movement Demonstrations Planned in Phoenix Today Arizona Congressman Raúl Grijalva Announces Bill Banning Uranium Mining Near Grand Canyon Wednesday's late-afternoon rally was one of more than 200 events scheduled around the world to celebrate the People's Climate Movement. Hundreds of thousands of men, women, and children shut down streets and paraded through their cities. The demonstrations were supported by the Sierra Club, Green Peace, 350.org, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and dozens of other environmental groups.\nEven President Obama chimed in, releasing this video in a White House tweet:\nRT if you agree: We can't condemn our kids to a planet that's beyond fixing. http://t.co/xQDERBymp3 #PeoplesClimate http://t.co/GBSJ8hDkgd\n— The White House (@WhiteHouse) October 14, 2015 But what made the Phoenix rally special, explained Pedro Lopez, director of Chispa — a Latino-based clean-energy group in Phoenix — is the number of young and engaged Latino youth who participated.\n\"We know that Latino families are disproportionately affected by climate change,\" he said. \"For instance, Latino children are 40 percent more likely to die from an asthma attack than non-Latino children.\"\nHis data comes from an Environmental Defense Fund study, which also found that one in 10 Latino children under the age of 18 suffer from respiratory illness.\nThese statistics follow the international pattern highlighted by Pope Francis in his recent visit to the United States — climate change hurts the affluent, but it's catastrophic for the global poor.\nEXPAND Miriam Wasser Chispa, Lopez says, is working to engage the local Latino community in environmental issues, and has about 500 active volunteers in the area, many of them youth.\n\"We know Governor Ducey is not supporting this issue,\" he says, \"and we know it's an important one for Latinos.\" Many recent studies have shown that Latinos in the U.S. care about climate change and want elected officials to act on it more than whites.\nIn a poll conducted last year , 54 percent of Latinos in the U.S. rated global warming as extremely or very important to them personally, while only 37 percent of whites did. And 63 percent of Latinos reported that they feel the federal government should tackle global warming, whereas only 49 percent of whites felt the same way.\nEXPAND Miriam Wasser Throughout the rally, those in attendance vowed to continue pressing elected leaders in Arizona to adopt the Environmental Protection Agency's Clean Energy Plan — currently, Arizona is one of a handful of states considering a lawsuit against the federal government for infringing on states' rights.\nIn one of the last comments of the day, another young Chispa leader brought the bullhorn to his mouth, and in a message that seemed both for the young crowd and for the elected officials working behind the closed doors of the capital buildings, said loudly:\n\"This may be the first time some of us have come to Capitol, but this won't be the last time for this issue.\"\nEXPAND Miriam Wasser EXPAND Miriam Wasser EXPAND Miriam Wasser EXPAND Miriam Wasser EXPAND Miriam Wasser EXPAND Miriam Wasser Contact: Miriam Wasser ", "external_links": ["http://t.co/xQDERBymp3", "https://www.facebook.com/ChispaAZ?fref=ts", "http://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/10/us/politics/climate-change-is-of-growing-personal-concern-to-us-hispanics-poll-finds.html?_r=0", "http://www.twitter.com/phoenixnewtimes", "https://www.facebook.com/phoenixnewtimes", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/PeoplesClimate?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/WhiteHouse/status/654319230117130240", "https://www.edf.org/blog/2014/04/22/why-latinos-are-disproportionately-affected-asthma-and-what-we-can-do", "http://t.co/GBSJ8hDkgd", "http://peoplesclimate.org/"], "published": "2015-10-15T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:33:18.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
