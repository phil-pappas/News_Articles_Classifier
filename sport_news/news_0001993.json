AP Photo/Brandon Wade\nCOMMENTARY\nWelcome to Season 4, Episode 4 of the Unconventional Preview , a serious-but-lighthearted, occasionally nostalgia-tinted look at the Patriots’ weekly matchup that runs right here every weekend.\nThe Patriots return from their hardly necessary bye week—really, it was practically a rare double-bye given how effortlessly they steamrolled the Jaguars in Week 3—one of the six remaining unbeaten teams in the NFL, but as the only one to have played three games rather than four. Insert your conspiracy theories about the NFL messing with the Patriots by giving them the early bye—a rarity for a presumed contender—right here. I’m listening.\nThis Sunday, the Patriots take on the 2-2 Dallas Cowboys, a 4:25 p.m. ET matchup that has marquee appeal—just not quite as much as it seemed to have when the 2015 schedule was released. The Cowboys lost wide receiver Dez Bryant in Week 1 and quarterback Tony Romo in Week 2. Suddenly, pretty much the only stars to be found on the field in Dallas are the blue ones on the sides of those iconic helmets.\nFactor in that Cowboys owner Jerry Jones was a Roger Goodell sympathizer during Deflategate and despicable defensive end Greg Hardy had the tone-deaf audacity to mention Tom Brady’s wife in his first conversation with the press since returning from a suspension for, among other things, allegedly assaulting and threatening to kill his then-girlfriend , and the Patriots have extra motivation to thump the Cowboys. Not that they actually will need it.\nKick it off, Gostkowski, and let’s get this thing started …\nTHREE PLAYERS I’LL BE WATCHING OTHER THAN TOM BRADY\nBrandon Weeden: You know, I’d watch a 30 for 30 on pretty much any topic (“What if I told you … that the Seattle Mariners were about to make Arquimedez Pozo available , and Dan Duquette was already ready to pounce …”). But I wouldn’t need any extra cajoling to tune in for an hour on the life and times of Brandon Weeden. Believe it or not, he’s actually much more interesting than your standard redheaded 31-year-old backup quarterback with a career 5-18 record as a starter and more picks (29) than touchdown passes (28).\nFor instance, he had a strong enough arm—or some other impressing skill or perceived intangible trait—to convince the Cleveland Browns to spend a first-round draft choice on him in 2011 even though he was 28 years old at the time.\nA right-handed pitcher of some promise, he was chosen out of high school by the Yankees with the 71st pick in the 2002 MLB Draft – 14 picks after the Red Sox selected Tacoma, Washington high school lefty Jon Lester.\nHis baseball career didn’t pan out—he had a 5.77 ERA in five minor-league seasons, never reaching Double-A—but he did manage to be included in a memorable trade, the Yankees’ swap of Jeff Weaver and some parts to the Dodgers for habitual inanimate object puncher Kevin Brown in December 2003.\nWeeden eventually decided to take the Chris Weinke path—around here maybe it’s known as the less-celebrated Dave Shinskie route —and ended up impressing enough in two years at Oklahoma State that the Browns drafted him even though he was older than Brian Sipe. That went predictably bad—the Browns, you know—but he’s actually been pretty good filling in for Romo, even completing 76.3 percent of his passes.\nI suspect that number will drop considerably Sunday, but the success so far has certainly been an unpredictable plot twist in his otherwise unremarkable—yet oddly interesting—career.\nGronk: Because Gronk, as I have explained before even though no explanation should be required, belongs here every week. He’s on a very short list of the most enjoyable players I’ve ever seen play. But beyond that, this week’s matchup—and his Cowboys counterpart—brings further evidence of just how exceptional he is.\nDallas tight end Jason Witten has been an outstanding player for a long time. He’s made 10 Pro Bowls. He’s been All-Pro twice. He’s had 79 or more receptions in a season seven times, and he’s submitted four 1,000-yard receiving seasons. He might be going to the Hall of Fame. And yet, even at his peak he was a shadow of what Gronk is now.\nHe never averaged more than 11.9 yards per catch in a season. Gronk has never averaged less than 13.0 ypc.\nWitten has never had more than nine touchdowns in a season. Gronk has had 10 or more four times, including 17 in 2011.\nWitten has 59 touchdowns in 195 career games. Gronk has 58 in 68 games.\nWitten is one of the best receiving tight ends of all-time. Gronk is a better receiving tight end, and he also blocks with the urgency of a tackle trying to make the roster.\nThis comparison is not intended to demean Witten. Rather, it’s intended to show that the only way to measure Gronk is against other great players. Rarely do the other greats measure up.\nDion Lewis: The veteran free-agent find-and-stash has been quite a discovery for the Patriots, acquitting himself more than competently in Shane Vereen’s former role as the third-down and change-of-pace back.\nHe’s doing the job well, just as Vereen did in replacing Danny Woodhead, and just as Woodhead did in replacing Kevin Faulk … I know, it’s not exactly akin to the Williams-Yaz-Rice lineage among Red Sox left fielders, but the Patriots are building a nice little tradition of dependability no matter who fills the role.\nGiven the injuries that put his career in limbo – he broke his leg in 2013 and was out of the league last season until the Patriots signed him to a futures contract – it’s a comeback story worth celebrating.\nSo it was cool to see him get some security, at least by NFL standards, this week when he reportedly signed a two-year extension that could pay him in the range of $5 million.\nGRIEVANCE OF THE WEEK\nI am a man who cannot be held to just a solitary weekly grievance!\nI’ve got three:\nGreg Hardy’s continued presence in the NFL; Uproxx’s decision to marginalize Kissing Suzy Kolber this season , when I could use a good Jerry Jones parody right about now; and those gripes that have been coming from my car radio lately about Patriots kicker Stephen Gostkowski and his relatively lucrative contract.\nLet’s elaborate on that last one for a minute. Gostkowski, a fourth-round pick in the 2005 draft, is one of the sneaky-great moves of the Belichick era. He’s the Patriots’ all-time leading scorer already in the 10th season of his career. That’s the same number of seasons as the peerless Adam Vinatieri played here. (Which also means Vinatieri will have kicked as many seasons for the Colts as he did the Patriots. I know, that doesn’t seem right.)\nGostkowski is a superb kicker, and the Patriots’ decision to pay him a better-than-decent wage for his position looks rather savvy now, given that the new extra-point rules seem to be having a greater impact than expected.\nNo, I don’t trust him as much as I trusted Vinatieri. Hell, I don’t trust people in my own family as much as I trusted Vinatieri. He owns three of the most clutch kicks in league history.\nBut Gostkowski is second on my Trusted Kickers depth chart, and I honestly don’t know who would be third. Uwe von Schamann , maybe.\nPREDICTION, OR WHERE HAVE YOU GONE, TONY DORSETT?\nCan the Cowboys actually beat the Patriots? Well, I mean, it could happen. They are at home, and that’s always some kind of benefit. A crazy bounce or a blocked punt or two would certainly help (presuming the Patriots actually punt at all after Ryan Allen wasn’t even required against the Jaguars.) The Cowboys would also need to be able to run the football and control the clock to have a chance. Given that neither Joseph Randle nor Darren McFadden is averaging four yards per carry, it’s fair to suspect the Patriots will be able to thwart the running game. Dallas can always hope that Tom Brady decides that he enjoyed the bye week so much that he’s going to take a second one without bothering to tell anyone. But yeah, that’s about it for the Cowboys’ hopes. The Patriots are superior, and Hardy gave them more motivation this week, as if they need it. The Scorched Earth Tour continues.
