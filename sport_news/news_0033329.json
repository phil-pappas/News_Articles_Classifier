Defender Michal Pazdan's high challenge on Long was rash, but television replays suggested it might have occurred outside the box. \nTurkish referee Cuneyt Cakir nevertheless pointed to the spot and Walters calmly beat keeper Lukasz Fabianski to claim his eighth goal in an Ireland shirt. \nThe Poles saw an 18th-minute Pawel Olkowski strike correctly ruled out for offside as the home side redoubled their efforts, and although the Republic defended stubbornly, they eventually succumbed three minutes before the break. \nThis time, Olkowski was the provider, picking out Lewandowski with the perfect cross for the in-form striker to power a header past Randolph. \nWhelan forced Fabianski into a solid save with a 51st-minute shot from distance after Robbie Brady's enterprising run, but the Stoke midfielder was to depart seven minutes later when he was replaced by Aiden McGeady, and he did so having seen Long carried from the field on a stretcher with what looked like an ankle injury. \nLong's departure had prompted Robbie Keane's introduction, but although Ireland were now contesting the game higher up the pitch, that left space behind and Grosicki almost exploited it when he was played in with 65 minutes gone, only for Randolph to block. \nCentral defender Richard Keogh came close nine minutes from time when he got his head to McGeady's cross, but Fabianski claimed the ball at the second attempt, and Ireland's hopes were gone when O'Shea, who had been cautioned before the break, felled Lewandowski and was dismissed.
