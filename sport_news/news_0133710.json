Does Leonte Carroo have enough time to revive his NFL Draft hopes?\nHe should. After missing two games because of his suspension, he has eight left. Plus a possible bowl game, all-star games and team workouts. Securing an NFL Combine invite is a priority.\n2. What is Rutgers’ biggest concern about Carroo’s return to the lineup?\nInjury. Carroo is a near-perfect-conditioned athlete, but after two games missed and a bye week, he could be liable to the muscle pulls that are red flags for players returning from layoffs.\n3. Are more high-profile programs coming down harder on troubled players?\nNot necessarily, although Auburn coach Gus Malzahn’s decision to kick out of his program star receiver Duke Williams, who punched a teammate in a bar fight, attracted a lot of attention.\n4. What do NFL executives think of Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly?\nMany feel he’s a very good offensive play-caller, but some question his decisions on the sidelines. Most were shaking their heads after Kelly’s failed two-point conversion against Clemson cost the Irish.\n5. How does Notre Dame dictate ticket deals even when it’s on the road?\nBecause the Irish are the designated home team in Shamrock Series games. They’re playing Boston College on Nov. 21 at Fenway Park, but BC’s allotment of the 39,125 tickets is less than 5,000.\n6. What’s the latest college coaching rumor involving Chip Kelly?\nThat USC could come after him at season’s end. Thursday night’s loss to Washington puts Steve Sarkisian on the hot seat. If the Eagles keep losing, a return to the college ranks might make sense for Kelly.\n7. How is LSU compensating South Carolina for moving today’s game?\nLSU will give South Carolina all the ticket revenue, parking and concession monies from the game in Baton Rouge, La. A nice gesture given that South Carolina has a lot on its mind besides football in the aftermath of the flooding that ravaged the state.\n8. Why is NFL star J.J. Watt so consumed with how Wisconsin fares?\nNot only did he play there, he has two brothers on the current team: Derek, a senior fullback, and T.J., a sophomore linebacker. The Badgers could have used J.J. Watt last week, when they lost to Iowa, suffering their first Big Ten defeat.\n9. Who does Princeton star runner DiAndre Atwater turn to for advice?\nHis father, Steve, the former NFL safety who was an eight-time Pro Bowler. The younger Atwater has gained 245 yards in three games as Princeton is 3-0 going into today’s game versus Colgate.\n10. What makes Princeton’s Kurt Holuba such a unique Ivy League player?\nThe sophomore from Bergen Catholic and Ho-Ho-Kus, arguably the best defensive lineman in the Ivy League, was recruited by high-profile programs such as Notre Dame, Florida State, Virginia and Penn State (where his father played).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:20:32.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
