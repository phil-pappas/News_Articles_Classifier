He is free to resume playing on October 19, 2015.\"\nO'Brien - who was named man of the match - could have faced a two week suspension but the adjudicating officer found that there were factors in O'Brien's favour.\n\"With respect to the sanction, the judicial officer deemed the act of foul play merited a low-end entry point of two weeks,\" read the statement.\n\"The judicial officer considered that there were no aggravating factors. The judicial officer took into account compelling mitigating factors including O'Brien's conduct prior to and at the hearing, his remorse, good character and clean disciplinary record, and reduced the suspension to a period of one week.\"\nPape has history with the Irish team having served a 10 week ban earlier in the year for kneeing Irish No 8 Jamie Heaslip in the back, fracturing three vertebrae.\nO'Brien's unavailability will stretch Irish playing resources even further as Rhys Ruddock arrived to replace the injured O'Mahony and lock Mike McCarthy has been called up to replace iconic skipper O'Connell.\nO'Connell had as expected been ruled out earlier on Tuesday with a hamstring injury which has also brought down the curtain on his glittering 108-test match career.\nThe Irish Rugby Football Union paid tribute to the 35-year-old O'Connell as \"a leader, a warrior, a gentleman\" as they announced that he would undergo surgery this week.\nAs of yet no replacement has been called up for centre Jared Payne, who was ruled out of the tournament last Saturday with a foot injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:58:24.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
