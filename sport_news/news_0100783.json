Eventually, the team’s huge freshmen class will gain experience.\nUntil then, Durand Johnson is trying to help his younger teammates understand what’s in front of them.\n“I’m definitely looking to step in and do my part to lead this team and lead us to where we want to be,” the graduate transfer said Wednesday at St. John’s media day. “I’m letting the young guys know how serious it is in the Big East and college basketball in general, just letting them know how hard it is.”\nRed Storm assistant coach Barry Rohrssen understood how valuable Johnson’s presence could be on a team filled with freshmen, quickly calling his former player at Pittsburgh upon learning he was transferring.\n“He provides our players with what it’s like not just to play in college, but to play at a high Division-I level,” Rohrssen said. “What you love about Durand is what hasn’t changed, his intensity and his love of playing basketball. He brings an intensity to the level of practice in every drill that we do.”\nA 6-foot-6 small forward from Baltimore, Johnson is the top candidate to lead the team in scoring this season, but like most of his teammates, much remains a mystery regarding the 23-year-old, who hasn’t played a game in nearly two years.\nAs a key reserve for Pitt as a sophomore, Johnson averaged 8.8 points, three rebounds and nearly one steal per game, but his season ended after just 16 games following a torn ACL. Johnson was then suspended last season following a violation of NCAA rules, though he continued practicing with the team.\nMullin said rust was evident when Johnson joined the team, but the coach has since been impressed with his play in practice and how quickly he took to the leadership role asked of the new veteran.\n“His personality is natural for that role,” Mullin said. “He saw an opportunity for a fresh start and he’s been great. I love his game. I love his attitude. He’s confident and his energy’s real. He’s not one of those rah-rah guys. He’s got legit energy and competitiveness and it helps the guys.”\nEven more helpful is having Johnson’s versatility on offense, with the career 35.9 percent 3-point shooter stepping onto a team that lost 96 percent of its scoring from last season.\n“I’m gonna have fun getting assists out of him,” freshman Marcus LoVett said. “He’s gonna be great for us. You can’t leave him open. He can flat out score.\n“He’s gonna be a huge factor for us and definitely be a leader because he knows the road. We’ll be listening to him.”\nJohnson already has told his teammates to ignore the preseason coaches poll, which predicted St. John’s would finish last in the Big East.\n“When I met everyone, we talked about where we want to go this year and what it would take [to go] as far as we can,” Johnson said. “We want to go dancing for sure.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chris mullin ,  durand johnson ,  st. john's red storm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:21:15.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
