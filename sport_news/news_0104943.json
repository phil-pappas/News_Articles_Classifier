Will Hopoate \n* At the centre of a difficult contract wrangle with Parramatta, Hopoate is yet to settle his future. While picked for Laurie Daley’s NSW side this year, he failed to live up to the hype as a marquee signing at the Eels. \n2. Kirisome Auva’a \n* After spending most of the season on the sidelines due to a domestic violence ban, the premiership-winning centre returned in the final month. He is in negotiations with the Rabbitohs for a contract extension and appears likely to remain at Redfern. \n3. Willie Mason \n* The walking headline is adamant his 16-year NRL career is not over and is confident of finding a team to run around with in 2016. While he will turn 36 next year, he showed in the back half of the year that he was capable of making a valuable contribution to a forward pack. \n4. Sam Perrett \n* The 30-year-old veteran is in negotiations to remain at Belmore but has yet to ink a new deal. He performed admirably at fullback in the Dogs’ charge to the 2014 grand final and was solid on the wing this year, proving he still has plenty to offer. \n5. Beau Falloon \n* He had cocaine charges thrown out of court earlier this month but is failing to attract interest from NRL clubs, despite being Gold Coast’s first-choice hooker for much of this year. With the Titans well-stocked for No.9s – Nathan Friend is making his way from the Warriors – he appears headed for England. \n6. Dene Halatau \n* Halatau looks set to be the victim of the Wests Tigers’ senior talent purge. Described as the ultimate clubman with 13 seasons and 226 games of experience under his belt, he would be a handy pick up for any side. At 32 though, his best football is behind him. \n7. Joey Leilua \n* After a mid-season switch from Newcastle to Canberra, the Samoan international was hoping he had finally found a home. He is in negotiations to stay at the Raiders under coach Ricky Stuart. \n8. Daniel Vidot \n* Unwanted at Brisbane under coach Wayne Bennett despite a couple of strong years at Red Hill, Vidot has been linked to a move overseas, a code switch to union and is even said to be considering a future in professional wrestling. \n9. Isaac John \n* With Jamie Soward and Peter Wallace holding down the halves spot at Penrith and highly-rated youngsters Te Maire Martin and Zach Dockar-Clay arriving next year, the Panthers’ Mr Fix It has been told he’s surplus to requirements. \n10. George Rose \n* The crowd favourite has a tough assignment ahead to continue his career. With the reduction in the interchange from 10 to eight next year, the rotund front-rower may find it hard to come across a club unwilling to chance their arm on him.
