After some tone deaf comments earlier in the week , the general feeling in the air is that Hardy isn’t contrite enough and/or hasn’t learned anything at all from his suspension. \nTerry Bradshaw sure feels that way , and CBS’ Jim Nantz seems to share those sentiments. After Hardy sacked Tom Brady and shushed the crowd, Nantz uncorked and let everyone know exactly how he felt about Greg Hardy and his apparent inability to feel guilt. \nHere he is playing for the first time. [Hardy] talks to the media this week and says these absolutely outrageous, unrepentant remarks. You talk to some people in Dallas and they thought, ‘hey, the guy was just trying to be funny’. There was nothing funny about it. With his suspension reduced, you thought you might see some contrition with him when he met with the media this week, but it was anything but that.” \n(Thanks to UPROXX Sports for sharing.)
