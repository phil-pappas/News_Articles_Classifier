Grant given greater NRL powers \nARL Commission chairman John Grant will assume greater responsibility and power within rugby league when NRL boss Dave Smith steps aside next month, but he will not assume the role of interim chief executive. \nSmith announced his intention to quit as NRL chief executive on Tuesday. His three-year reign as rugby league boss will end on November 30. \nThe NRL has launched a worldwide search for Smith’s successor but Grant has said there is no guarantee the game will have a new figurehead by the time the 2016 season kicks off. \nAs such, Grant will enjoy significantly increased influence in the game until a new CEO is appointed. \nHe already enjoys considerable power as ARLC chairman and that will be enhanced. \nThe ARLC said in a media release on Wednesday it did not believe Grant wearing both leadership hats constituted a conflict on interest. \nHowever, it will involve Grant taking on extra responsibilities. \n“There will be no interim CEO but, after that date (November 30), I will take on some additional duties,” Grant said. \n“My role will continue to be chairman.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T11:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T14:45:18.561+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
