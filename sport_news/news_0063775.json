Even the score was the same.\nThe big-hitting Croatian came under pressure in the early stages but soon took control, breaking Bautista Agut's serve at 3-3 before closing out the first set.\nCilic went a break up at 2-2 in the second before saving two break points in the next game to hold his advantage.\n\"This tournament is becoming more and more special for me,\" Cilic said. \"Coming back for a second year in a row and to win it again, it gives me huge, huge satisfaction and huge pleasure.\"\nCilic is now 14-9 in tour finals, while Bautista Agut drops to a 2-3 record. They have been close friends since their days as junior players but have only faced each other on court as professionals in their two Moscow finals.\nBautista Agut said he was satisfied with his performance despite the defeat.\n\"That's how I like to finish the week. I gave everything on this court,\" he said.\nIt was the first tour final for both players since they met last year in Moscow.\nSvetlana Kuznetsova won an all-Russian women's final Saturday, defeating an exhausted Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova 6-2, 6-1.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
