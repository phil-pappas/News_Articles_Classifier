The DOT will be reducing westbound I-90 to one lane through the interchange during construction, and the speed limit is being lowered to 45 mph. Officials say ramp traffic will be maintained throughout the project but the space for merging traffic will be limited. Drivers are asked to slow down and be aware of suddenly slowing and merging traffic both through the interchange and on the ramps. Â© 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
