We always talk.” \nFisher offered his condolences to Ringhoff, a senior quarterback for the Stateliners who broke his thumb while throwing a touchdown pass on Oct. 14 on the last play of practice. \n“It was so unfortunate,” Fisher said. “He threw a pass, and his thumb came down and hit a kids’ helmet. I feel terrible for him.” \nFisher, who was competing with Rinhoff for the QB job since the first week of practice, now has the starting job all to his own. He’ll be under center Friday night when the Stateliners (5-1) host Hunterdon Central (2-4) in a Mid-State 38 Conference Delaware Division battle at Maloney Stadium. \nFisher said he wasn’t originally sure of the extent of Ringhoff’s injury. “I had no clue,” Fisher said. “I saw him shaking his hand after the play. The next day he told me he broke it. Honestly, I just felt so bad for him. But that’s football. You never know when your last play is going to be. Hopefully he’ll be back.” \nRinhgoff’s injury couldn’t have come at a worse time. In the previous game, he relieved Fisher and completed 11 of 13 passes for 180 yards and two touchdowns in a 28-21 win over Hillsborough . \nP’burg coach Ryan Ditze said Ringhoff was tentatively scheduled for surgery next week. \n“Like all kids would be, Zach is disappointed,” Ditze said. “You have to feel for him because he worked so hard to get here. I just hope he’s a quick healer and he’s able to come back. He has a glimmer of hope. We’re staying positive because he’s an important part of our team.” \nSophomores Karrick Stansberry and Adam Pursel, who’ve been splitting time on the junior varsity, are now backing up Fisher. Running backs Manny Romero and Garrett Boures are the emergency quarterbacks. \nSpeaking of Romero, the shoulder injury he suffered in last week’s win over Elizabeth apparently is OK. Ditze said he was cleared to play and should be 100 percent Friday. \nFisher said his approach hasn’t changed since Ringhoff’s injury. \n“I’m doing the same thing I always did, and that’s try to go out and help the team win,” Fisher said. “It’s still the same mindset. But I really liked the competition me and Zach had going. We really worked hard during the offseason and that helped both of us. We compete hard when we’re on the field but we’re good friends, too. That’s what really upsets me.” \nDitze said he feels comfortable with Fisher taking over the QB job. \n“Danny will do a great job,” Ditze said. “He has great leadership skills and he works extremely hard. We’ve seen it before. Once everybody is clicking and on the same page, this offense is going to be something. The whole team will rally around Zach and Danny.” \nHunterdon Central once had P’burg’s number, defeating the Stateliners six straight times from 2007-12. However, P’burg has won the last two meetings with the Red Devils, including last season’s 43-21 triumph in Raritan Township. \n“(Hunterdon Central) has a great program and we have to be ready to play Friday,” Fisher said. “You can’t take anyone lightly. They always play hard.” \nAfter an 0-3 start, Hunterdon Central has won 2 of 3 including last week’s 20-7 win over Franklin. \n“They have a nice offensive scheme,” Ditze said. “They do a lot of zone read. Defensively they’re very aggressive with their blitz schemes. They have a lot of players back and are well coached. This is a big game for both schools.” \nJunior running back Blake Leeds has been the Red Devils’ top offensive player with 471 yards and four touchdowns (4.8 yards per carry). Leeds ran for 144 yards and a touchdown on 37 carries against Franklin. \n“(Leeds) runs downhill very hard,” Ditze said. “He can go north-south very quickly, and he delivers a blow on impact. He’s a good, quality back.” \nWhen P’burg and Hunterdon Central get together there are generally very few surprises. \n“We have a really good picture of what they do and they have a really good picture of us,” Ditze said. “We’ve seen each other play for so long. It should be a good game on Friday night.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:02:29.425+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
