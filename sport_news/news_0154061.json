Finished with wax and oil, it’s smooth like a Champagne cork (rather than craggy like the bulletin board you had in elementary school). The naturally occurring resin found in cork affords the material plenty of give: when you squeeze the sides of your phone, you’ll find that the top of the case does not bulge out as with rival designs. Cork Case, $89, kerfcase.com\nWood | Want your iPhone to look like it was plucked from the Adirondacks? Two pieces comprise this all-wood case: a bumper that protects the phone’s edges and a matching veneer sticker that adheres to the gadget’s back. Available in walnut (shown) or maple for all varieties of the iPhone 5 and 6, each case is treated with oil and buffed by hand to bring out the wood’s low-tech but undeniably beautiful grain. Walnut iPhone Case, $99, grovemade.com\nMarble | This case may be crafted using antiquity’s favorite stone, but at only 1.1 ounces, it adds minimal weight to your otherwise Platonic iPhone 6 or 6s. A sliver of white or black marble less than a millimeter thick is affixed to a polycarbonate housing that can be easily snapped on or off your device. The naturally cool-to-the-touch stone tamps down the heat your phone gives off after heavy Instagramming.
