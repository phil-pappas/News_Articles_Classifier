Peter Roskam, R-Ill., and Rep. Tammy Duckworth, D-Ill., who was determined to stay above the fray.\nIndeed, on his third round of questions to the Democratic presidential front-runner and former secretary of State, Roskam dramatically tore up a piece of a paper to underscore his assertion that Clinton ignored requests for more security in Libya, where four Americans died in a 2012 attack in Benghazi.\nClinton avoided making an obvious mistake or significant, damaging admissions during the hearing before seven Republicans and five Democrats, including Duckworth and Roskam, who both represent congressional districts in suburban Chicago.\nSeveral Republicans, including House Select Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy, R-S.C., and Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, were consumed with portraying Hillary and Bill Clinton’s friend and adviser Sidney Blumenthal as a behind-the-scenes wizard, elevating the West Rogers Park native who frequently sent emails to Clinton. Clashes over the Blumenthal emails played to the Democratic contention that the panel is on a partisan mission to cripple Clinton’s presidential bid.\nROSKAM THE PROSECUTOR\nRoskam was the leadoff questioner, and he took on an antagonistic tone from the start. However, he came up dry in plowing major new ground.\nHe put on the table that while Clinton’s team was building her up as “the public face of the U.S. effort in Libya,” others in the State Department were “pushing back.” Clinton said the White House ultimately was in charge.\nOPINION\nFollow @LynnSweet\nIn a memorable exchange, Roskam told Clinton, “I can pause while you’re reading your note,” to which Clinton said she can well do more than “one thing at a time, Congressman.”\nAt the end of his first round of questioning, Roskam took a political turn as he left the events of the tragic attack on Sept. 11, 2012, to the current day chaos in Libya.\n“Our Libya policy . . . couldn’t have happened without you because you were its chief architect. . . . After your plan, things in Libya today are a disaster,” he said.\nOn his second round of questioning, Roskam focused on a note written by Jake Sullivan, one of Clinton’s top State Department advisers in August 2011, mapping out strategy to get some good press following the fall of dictator Moammar Gadhafi.\nRoskam said in an accusatory tone, “You were working to make this the story of the day.”\nSeeking good press — that’s something of a bipartisan quest in this town.\nRoskam opined that Clinton wanted to sell the public on the “Clinton Doctrine.”\n“I think it’s where an opportunity is seized to turn progress in Libya into a political win for Hillary Rodham Clinton, and at the precise moment when things look good, take a victory lap, like on all the Sunday shows three times that year before Gadhafi was killed, and then turn your attention to other things. I yield back.”\nReplied Clinton, “I don’t understand why that has anything to do with what we are supposed to be talking about today.”\nDUCKWORTH STAYS ABOVE THE FRAY\nDuckworth is running for the Senate seat now held by Sen. Mark Kirk, R-Ill., and is facing a Democratic primary rival, attorney Andrea Zopp. Duckworth was determined not to appear overtly partisan in any way and to leverage her military background. She’s a wounded Iraq war vet.\n“My line of questioning will probably be a little bit boring because I’m going to get in — into some details that actually have to deal with security and how we can better safeguard America’s diplomats now and onwards,” Duckworth said.”\nDuckworth said Congress is cheap when it comes to protecting lives. “When life and limb are at risk, such as when buying body armor for our troops overseas or barriers for our embassies, I don’t know that Lowest Priced Technically Acceptable is the right vehicle.”\nLast September, Clinton basically endorsed Duckworth in her bid for a Senate seat at an event, and that has given Kirk’s political team ammunition to accuse Duckworth of wanting to go easy on Clinton.\nUnder questioning from Duckworth, Clinton highlighted a fact often overlooked: The four American diplomats did not die from direct fire. Duckworth pointed out that they retreated to a safe haven in the U.S. outpost in Benghazi that was not properly equipped for protection from smoke.\nSaid Clinton: “And the safe room was anything but safe. I’m sure the committee members know that neither Chris Stevens nor Sean Smith died from injuries directly inflicted by the attackers. They both died of smoke inhalation.”\nFollow Lynn Sweet on Twitter: @LynnSweet\nTweets by @lynnsweet", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/lynnsweet”", "https://twitter.com/lynnsweet"], "published": "2015-10-23T04:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:47:47.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
