As the Portland Police Bureau rightly acknowledges, there are sticky questions of privacy, public access and other issues that the city needs to tackle if it wants to proceed with a proposal to outfit its officers with the devices.\nSo credit the police bureau with trying to get the public engaged in shaping the policies to come, including holding community forums that, regrettably, were sparsely attended. The police bureau is getting better results through its website, where people have left some 440 comments about body cameras so far, many of which directly respond to the specific questions posed by the bureau, including: How should police use the cameras in sensitive incidents such as those involving child abuse? And should there be restrictions on sharing or posting the footage?\nUnfortunately, the bureau failed to list one of the most critical questions: Should police officers who use deadly force on a suspect be given special viewing privileges? Specifically, should they be allowed to view the footage of the encounter before giving investigators an account of what happened – a benefit no one else in the public would receive? How city leaders ultimately answer that question will determine whether the cameras can help rebuild public trust or whether they will amount to an expensive PR tool that does nothing to hold police accountable for their actions.\nThe power of video to provide an objective account of an encounter has been clear from coast to coast. Earlier this year in South Carolina, police officer Michael Slager fatally shot an unarmed motorist, Walter Scott. Slager had claimed he shot Scott after Scott grabbed his Taser , but a witness' cell phone video disputed that. In North Portland last year, Portland officers stopped Roosevelt High School student Thai Gurule as he walked down the street, then hit, Tased and arrested him. One of the officers had claimed Gurule was throwing punches, but multiple videos of the incident shared during his trial led a Multnomah County circuit judge to acquit the teen and lambaste Officer Betsy Hornstein as \"not credible\" in several instances.\nAnd so when police officers argue for the ability to view video footage before talking about an incident – giving them the chance to know exactly what is and is not on the video – anyone who values accountability should say no . Unfortunately, in some jurisdictions that have adopted cameras, police officer unions have prevailed in putting themselves first.\nSome police officer advocates contend that letting officers view the footage will help them give the most accurate account of what happened. After all, they note, the officers have just been involved in a high-stress situation that can impair their memory and lead to mistakes that could unfairly paint them as untruthful. And, they note, officers can't be compelled to give a statement to criminal investigators (although they can be for administrative investigators evaluating whether department policies were violated).\nThat seems reasonable except for the fact that police officers don't give criminal suspects the same kind of consideration in their pursuit of an investigation. Instead, they show up unannounced to question a suspect, employ a range of interrogatory tactics and would doubtlessly refuse a request to show a video to a suspect, said Kevin Sali, a Lake Oswego criminal defense attorney. Although Sali agrees that a video could help an officer's recall, that's not how the rest of the criminal justice system operates.\nBut that's why it's important to go back and remember why we're considering spending hundreds of thousands of dollars and encroaching into people's privacy in the first place: years of fatal shootings and use of force by police officers against people who were unarmed, in a mental health crisis or suspected of such minor offenses as urinating in public. Public trust has eroded to a point that the primary use of these videos must be to provide an objective report of a police officer's conduct. Any use of the video that detracts from that purpose is a waste both of a huge investment and an opportunity to restore trust.\nIdeally, officers should not be able to preview video in various other instances either. Michael Gennaco, a police procedure expert who has evaluated Portland Police over the years, contends officers should not be able to view video any time a police officer's conduct is at issue, such as in any use of force incident or in cases where a person complains about police conduct at the time of arrest.\nMayor Charlie Hales, who serves as police commissioner, and Police Chief Larry O'Dea have not yet indicated what kind of policy they would support.\n\"We really are waiting to see where people stand on this issue,\" Hales' spokesman, Dana Haynes, said in an email.\nUnfortunately, with the police bureau's failure to include on its website the question of whether to allow officers special viewing privileges, the city might be waiting a long time. Portlanders should not let that be an excuse. They should make clear to leaders that a body-camera policy that allows officers to preview footage is one for which the city should just hit delete.\n- The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board", "external_links": ["http://www.postandcourier.com/scott-timegap/", "http://www.policeforum.org/assets/docs/Free_Online_Documents/Technology/implementing%20a%20body-worn%20camera%20program.pdf", "http://www.portlandoregon.gov/police/article/521411"], "published": "2015-10-22T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:17:32.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
