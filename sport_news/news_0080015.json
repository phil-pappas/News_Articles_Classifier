(AP file photo) Comments \nKILLINGTON, VT â€“ The superstars will be coming to Superstar. \nThe women's World Cup slalom and giant slalom will be coming to the Killington ski resort in November 2016 and could bring some of the best-known female skiers in the world, including Americans Vermont-trained Mikaela Shiffrin , Olympic gold medalist Julia Mancuso and multiple World Cup Champion Lindsey Vonn. \n\"It is a huge opportunity. It is going to be broadcast across the country,\" said Michael Joseph, communications manager for Killington. \"It could have an economic impact of $15 to $20 million. It will be huge for central Vermont.\" \nThe International Ski Federation, which runs the World Cup, announced on Wednesday that Killington was selected to host the two races on Nov. 26 and 27 on its Superstar trail, which is well-known for building up a huge snow pack so people can ski late into the spring. \nThis is the first time a World Cup Race has come to New England since 1991, when it was held at Waterville Valley in New Hampshire. The last time the International Ski Federation held a World Cup competition in Vermont was in 1978 when the men's and women's slalom and giant slalom races were held at Stratton Mountain. \nOne of the reasons Killington was selected is due to its massive snowmaking capacity, which was expanded even more last year, Joseph said. \nBecause weather can be fickle in November, with some years being warm and others bringing natural snow, the ability to consistently make snow is vital for bringing an international competition to the area, Joseph said. \nKillington has already started making plans for next year to bring extra air compressors and to dedicate more energy to snowmaking on the Superstar trail and some of the adjacent ones, which will be used for training, he said. \n\"It is definitely something we are considering every day. We are all excited about it,\" he said. \nKillington, which has the most skiable acreage in the east, is a great spot for the event and the Superstar trail is ideal for the race, said Parker Riehle, president of Ski Vermont. \n\"They have unrivaled snowmaking firepower. It was Killington's incredible snowmaking upgrade last year that made a big impact,\" he said. \nNewer, high-technology snowguns, also allows the resort to make more snow at warmer temperatures, which may be key in November. The guns also require less energy, Riehle said. \nThe trail is also ideal for the race, he said. \n\"It is the right pitch, it has snowmaking and visibility from below and it is called superstar,\" he said. \nThe trail is also serviced by a chairlift that runs directly above the slope, Riehle said. \nA number of other nearby Vermont ski areas are likely to get involved to provide training locations and housing, since so many skiers will be arriving from different countries for the competition, he said. \nKillington is located about 130 miles north of Springfield. \nWhile some may question if November is the best time for the competition to come to New England, Riehle said he believes it will be a perfect kickoff to the 2016 ski season. \n\"The Thanksgiving weekend is the starting gate of the season to have that event kick off the season is great,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:10:24.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
