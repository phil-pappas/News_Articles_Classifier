More to come.\nThere was so much more to come: psi and Ted Wells and Troy Vincent and McNally and Jastremski and Tom Brady’s cell phone and Jeffrey Kessler and Bill Nye the Science Guy and Ideal Gas Law and the fractured relationship between longtime pals Roger Goodell and Robert Kraft and Brady’s four-game suspension overturned by Judge Richard M. Berman after it has been upheld by the commissioner whose disciplinary powers have come under fire.\n“I knew it would be a big story. … I knew that anytime the flagship franchise, a team headed to the Super Bowl, is gonna be under investigation for cheating, especially given Spygate, I knew it would be a big deal,” Kravitz said from Indianapolis, “but the fact that it went to the Wells Report, the fact that it ended up in federal court, was a total shock to me. I thought it might be a couple of weeks, and they would objectively be able to ascertain whether the balls are deflated or not using whatever gauges they chose to use. But the fact that it became this incredible passion play that lasted eight months, was just overwhelming to me.”\nIt all comes full circle Sunday night.\nBalls to the wall inside Lucas Oil Stadium.\nAndrew Luck and the Colts and the city of Indianapolis against Tom Brady and Bill Belichick.\nBrady and Belichick against the world. Again.\nTom Brady had to explain away the Deflategate controversy in January. Photo: AP Here’s what we sometimes forget about Belichick and Brady: They would beat their grandmothers 45-7 if they could. So they will want to bludgeon the Colts 45-7 again because it is what they do when they start keeping score.\nA possible added problem for the Colts is this: Because the Colts were the ones who started the Deflategate mess, Brady and the men fiercely loyal to Brady will look to punish them for igniting the series of events that called his integrity into question, that left him with the Scarlet Letter “C” for Cheater in the eyes of Goodell’s NFL and precincts reporting outside of New England.\nDeflategate seemingly has resulted in Brady and the Patriots motivated to exact the same type of vengeance on the rest of the league as they did post-Spygate in 2007, until they ran into Eli Manning and the Giants in Super Bowl XLII.\nOn the other hand, this so-called rivalry has been so one-sided lately that the Colts probably are fortunate that they remain below the Jets on the Belichick-Brady enemies list.\nOn the other hand, it probably doesn’t matter: It’s personal with the Pats no matter who they play. Belichick and Brady crave one for the thumb and history as much as they did one.\nFor the Colts, this is a chance to avenge their humiliating AFC Championship defeat in Foxborough, Mass., the last place they want to visit in January.\nAs fortunate as the Colts faithful are for Andrew Luck being delivered to them after Peyton Manning, the fact remains Belichick and Brady stand as the same Evil Emperors for Luck that they did for Manning. Only once — a memorable comeback victory in the 2006 AFC Championship game in Indianapolis — did Manning as a Colt deny Belichick and Brady 60 minutes from a Super Bowl.\nPerhaps it is coincidence Luck sat the past two games with a shoulder injury that, barring an 11th-hour setback, has been revived just in time for the exorcism his entire town has planned. Or perhaps it isn’t.\nLuck’s 0-4 record against Belichick and Brady includes such one-sided humiliations that you might wonder why Colts general manager Ryan Grigson hasn’t tried to swing a trade for The Deflator: 59-24, 43-20, 42-20 and 45-7 in last year’s AFC title game. The envelope, please: six TDs, 10 INTs, 9-for-42 rushing. Colts fans still are waiting for Luck, who has yet to advance to a Super Bowl, to overtake Brady as the face of the NFL. No such Luck.\nAndrew Luck Photo: Getty Images Disregard all the mealy-mouthed platitudes from the Colts. They hate the Patriots. Their manhood is on the line. They’re sick and tired of playing the Washington Generals foil to the Patriots’ Harlem Globetrotters.\nThe irony is that the Colts’ best chance — only chance, probably fat chance — is forcing Brady to go to the air. Because over the past three games, the Patriots have gashed them for 657 yards rushing. In two playoff games over the past two seasons against the Colts, LeGarrette Blount rushed for 166 yards and four TDs, and 148 yards and three TDs. And now he has slippery Dion Lewis as a partner in crime. In a regulzr-season game in between, Jonas Gray rumbled for 201 yards and four TDs.\nNo wonder, when you ask Kravitz what the mood this week in Indianapolis has been, he tells you: “Fearful. I would say that people around here just don’t want to get their asses kicked . While they’re hopeful, and the hard-core fans want them to win certainly, generally speaking, they just don’t want to get humiliated again.”\nBy a team they consider the Hatriots.\n“The only thing that rivals it … the Pacers against the Knicks,” Kravitz said. “They’ve been the team that’s always gotten in their way of going where they wanted to go. The hatred is very deep and very real here in Indianapolis.”\nColts coach Chuck Pagano is more confident in his current defensive line (Kendall Langford, rookie Henry Anderson), and opposing running backs have been limited to a 3.3-yard average, but Arthur Jones (IR, ankle) was a damaging loss, and Bubba Smith won’t be riding to the rescue.\nBe that as it may, Brady is playing at such a high level that it seems plausible that he could hit Rob Gronkowski or Julian Edelman at will even if he were throwing a medicine ball … or an inflated ball.\n“Certainly the success that they’ve had on the ground would lead us to believe that we better be prepared and ready to stop the run,” Pagano said.\nBelichick and Brady act as if media members just landed from Mars anytime they’re asked about any possible Deflategate consequences for the Colts, or for anyone else.\n“So to address the elephant in the room, this is the game where we’re going to see each other later down the road,” Colts linebacker D’Quell Jackson said. “It has implications on the playoffs, whether home or away.”\nJackson was the one who intercepted Brady before halftime last postseason and brought it to the sidelines because he wanted to keep it as a souvenir.\n“They won that game because of their intensity,” he said days after Deflategate had begun, “not the pressure of a football.”\nProving as much to the world — and assuredly to the Colts — seems to be the Evil Emperors’ latest holy war.\nGood Luck stopping them.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under bill belichick ,  deflategate ,  indianapolis colts ,  new england patriots ,  serby says ,  tom brady", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:51:17.513+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
