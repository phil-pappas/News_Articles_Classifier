Photo by Andy Lyons/Getty Images People mocked Tom Brady a few years ago when he said he wants to play another ten years. Fast forward a few years later and Tom Brady says he still wants to play another ten years.\nIn a conference call with a pool of New York Jets reporters, the 38-year-old Brady expressed his desire to play another ten years. That would mean Brady would be pushing 50 years old when he finally decides to hang up his spikes. That is unless, of course, Brady doesn't hold another interview at that time saying he wants to play another ten years.\nBrady raised eyebrows last week in his weekly interview on WEEI with the Dennis & Callahan featuring Minihane Show when he touted his relationship with his personal trainer, Alex Guerrero. Guerrero has a tainted reputation as a being a quack. In a recent article in Boston Magazine, it was revealed that Guerrero was sued by the government in 2004 for falsely claiming he was a doctor and selling an alleged cure for terminal illnesses.\nBut Brady swears by Guerrero . Brady sounded delusional when he claimed he credits Guerrero for helping Brady avoid serious injuries, such as torn ACLs and concussions. Brady credited Guerrero for his full recovery from a torn ACL he sustained in 2008. Brady says that doctors told him he may not be able to play football again after Brady suffered complications following his knee surgery. Brady cites how he won Comeback Player of the Year the following year and league MVP the year after that.\nNow Brady believes that his disciplined training will allow him to play another ten years. Brady currently ranks fifth all-time in passing yards with 54,957 yards. Brett Favre is the all-time leader with 71,838. Peyton Manning is only 623 yards away from surpassing Favre. Brady is fourth all-time in touchdown passes with 406. Manning is the all-time leader with 537 touchdowns.\nIf Brady even plays another five years at anywhere close to his current level (he is, currently, the top-rated quarterback in the NFL ), he could own both those records and solidify his status as the greatest quarterback of all-time.\nThe thought of Brady playing another ten years has to be music to Patriots ' fans ears. The question is if Brady would play all ten of those years in a Patriots' uniform.", "external_links": ["http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_yds_career.htm", "http://espn.go.com/nfl/statistics/player/_/stat/passing/sort/quarterbackRating", "http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/patriots/2015/10/tom_brady_stands_by_training_guru_alex_guerrero", "http://www.pro-football-reference.com/leaders/pass_td_career.htm"], "published": "2015-10-23T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:57:19.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
