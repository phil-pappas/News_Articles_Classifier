Their latest victory had extra meaning as it marked the coaching debut for the season of Chris Scott , who guided the Dolphins to their first State Championship and an undefeated record in 2014. Scott was suspended three games for violating the VHSL's rules against recruiting, then two more games for not following the terms of his suspension. \"Having him back was definitely extra motivation. That's our general and our leader,\" said junior Khalan Laborn , who rushed for 148 yards on 19 carries and four touchdowns, three of those scores coming before half-time. \"Even though I haven't known him that long, he's like a close friend to the family. He's done a lot for us.\" While Scott was absent, assistant Chris Ramey stepped in as an interim Head Coach and the team didn't miss a beat in winning five contests, all by double-figures. With him back, Ocean Lakes was determined to get off to a strong start and leave no doubt. It took only 6:41 for Ocean Lakes to build a two-touchdown lead on a Kellam team that came in having won its last two games by a combined margin of 85-20. A 24-point second quarter by the Dolphins put Kellam in a 38-6 hole at the break. Ocean Lakes accumulated a whopping 336 yards of offense in the first half. With 43.1 seconds to go in the second period, Kellam scored its lone touchdown of the night on 36-yard touchdown pass from Justin Glasier to Tyree Thorpe . The Dolphins would answer before the break on a 19-yard field goal from James Hamer , then got a pair of rushing touchdowns in the second half to create a running clock margin. The Dolphins have now won 21 in a row and 37 straight in the regular season against Beach District opponents. Through six games this season, they've outscored opponents to the tune of 312-32. Glad to back on the sidelines, Scott said he learned a lot about his team while he was gone. \"It felt great to be with the guys. That's what it's all about. Whether that's a clich√© or not, that's the truth. Really the best part of being with the team is Monday through the whole week, and then Friday is a fun thing at the end,\" he noted. \"The first thing I learned is we have great young men who persevered and pulled together. In the moment of when they could look at things, get down and ask 'why me, why us or what's going on,' they rallied behind and pulled each other together. I think it's a big indication of not only what we're on the field, but off the field. They're a very special group. I'm just happy to be a part of that and realizing how blessed it is to be a part of that. That's probably a big lesson for me as well.\" Team Scoring Play (Ocean Lakes at Kellam ) Game Score DeSue 61-yard pass to Trotman, PAT failed 6-0 Laborn 4-yard run, Laborn 2-point run 14-0 Laborn 37-yard run, PAT Hamer good 21-0 DeSue 18-yard pass to Trotman, PAT Hamer good 28-0 Laborn 8-yard run, PAT Hamer good 35-0 Glasier 36-yard pass to Tyree Thorpe, PAT failed 35-6 Laborn 4-yard run, PAT Hamer good 45-6 Low 15-yard run, PAT Hamer good 52-6 Performing Like A Five-Star: Ocean Lakes already has one recruit on its roster rated a five-star prospect in defensive back Levonta Taylor , who's committed to play his College Football at Florida State. Laborn , a Class of 2017 talent new to the Dolphins this year after transferring from Cox, sure looks like he'll give them another. His combination of nifty footwork, excellent vision and great cutting ability made it difficult for even a Kellam defense that has been fairly stout against the run this year to handle. \"I just try to read the body language of the defense,\" Laborn explained of his running strategy, which featured a few hurdling moves. \"If I see a defender is about to low-cut, then I hurdle. If I see he's trying to arm-tackle me, I give him a stiff-arm. It depends on the body language.\" For the season, Laborn is now only 27 yards shy of 1000. He's done it on a relatively low carry total compared to other backs with 71 attempts. But his touchdown total is high with 17, including nine over the last two games when he's rushed for 435 yards. Of course, as many exceptional rushers do, Laborn gives credit to his blockers up front. \"Everything positive that happens, it all comes from the o-line,\" Laborn went on to say. \"Our right guard Bobby Smith , Noah [ Knapp ] our left guard, Andrew [ Grage ] our left, Nick Low our center and our right tackle Zach [ Bevins ]. I have to give a shout-out to them.\" Even though a 2000-yard season would be nice, his main objective is a ring. \"For us to get to a State Championship, we have to be on point with everything we do and go 100 miles an hour every game,\" Laborn added. \"There's still a whole lot to improve, and we know as we get closer, we can't afford to have any mess-ups.\" New Receiving Weapon: Opponents of Ocean Lakes know plenty about Laborn , Taylor and highly recruited junior wideout Tahj Capehart . Another developing playmaker is Jermaine Trotman . The senior came to the Dolphins a year ago from Landstown , but was ruled ineligible. Trotman hasn't wasted any time making an impact, which showed against the Knights with four catches for 104 yards and a pair of touchdown snags from sophomore quarterback Tyler DeSue . \"He's another weapon to our offense. With him being a 6-2 receiver, he's going to have a lot of good match-ups on DB's, then you have Khalan in the backfield,\" Taylor pointed out. Trotman nearly had a 78-yard punt return for a touchdown, but it was called back on a penalty. Defenses have to pick their poison on who to try to stop. \"Trotman is a big-time threat outside stretching the field, a long guy who can go up and get it, and physical outside blocking as well. It's a matter of time,\" Scott commented. \"You get him, Tahj, Vonta and Tylan [ McElhanie ]and all those guys involved, which again helps set up the run. We were able to take advantage of that.\" Bringing Heat: As potent as the Ocean Lakes offense was, perhaps equally stifling was their defense. They held the Knights to just one touchdown on the evening and 131 yards, all but four coming over the final three quarters. Applying pressure in the trenches were the likes of junior Eric Crosby and senior Dedrion Bacote , new to the Dolphins after spending the previous two seasons at Oscar Smith and Landstown Bacote \"He's been huge,\" Scott said of Bacote . \"The defensive line is having a record-setting year, and along with Billy Higgins , they're fighting for tackles. Known for their strong running game, Kellam Freshmen Shining Too: There are some big-name recruits in the Class of 2016 and 2017 for Ocean Lakes either committed to the next level or with multiple scholarship offers on the roster. There are also a pair of freshmen quickly establishing themselves in Jake Low and Tank Land \"Knowing these guys since they've been five and six, it's neat and I haven't had that type of group come up,\" stated Scott. \"Jake is going to be very, very special. He went in on defense and had two really, really good tackles from the back-side as a linebacker just getting to the ball,\" Scott added. \"Then, he's a downhill runner that can actually get a little side-step to him and get up the field. A starting defensive back in a secondary chock full of next-level prospects, Land returned an interception 31 yards. \"We're trying to show he's one of the best DB's around already. He had a couple of tackles and an interception. \"We're really working on tackling, eliminating any missed tackles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:12:59.188+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
