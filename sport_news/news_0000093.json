MSU coach John Cohen didn't immediately return a message asking for comment on the story. \nMississippi State's only comment was, \"We will not speculate on other (schools') coaching searches.\" \nAuburn's head coaching job opened last month with the firing of Sunny Galloway. Auburn athletic director Jay Jacobs said the dismissal was with cause, but wouldn't state specifics. \nThompson was an assistant coach at Auburn from 2006-08. He joined Cohen at Mississippi State in 2009. He was promoted to associate head coach in 2012. \nThompson won the Baseball America's Assistant coach of the year in 2014. He's regarded as one of the best pitching coaches in the country. Only Louisville and North Carolina have more strikeouts as a program since 2012. No team has induced more double plays in that time. \nContact Michael Bonner at mbonner@jackson.gannett.com. Follow @MikeBBonner on Twitter.
