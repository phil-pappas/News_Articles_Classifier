Households that were not defined as poor before can now be reached with these policies, and that is a direct result of Deaton's research.\"\nLast year, French economist Jean Tirole won the prestigious award for research on market power and regulation.\nThe economics award is not a Nobel Prize in the same sense as the others, which were created by Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel in 1895. Sweden's central bank added the economics prize in 1968 as a memorial to Nobel.\nMonday's announcement concludes this year's presentations of Nobel winners.\nThe medicine prize went to three scientists from Japan, the U.S. and China who discovered drugs to fight malaria and other tropical diseases. Japanese and Canadian scientists won the physics prize for discovering that tiny particles called neutrinos have mass and scientists from Sweden, the U.S. and Turkey won the chemistry prize for their research into the way cells repair damaged DNA.\nBelarusian investigative journalist Svetlana Alexievich won the literature award while the peace prize went to The National Dialogue Quartet in Tunisia for its contribution to building democracy in Tunisia following the 2011 Jasmine Revolution.\nThe awards will be handed out on Dec. 10, the anniversary of prize founder Alfred Nobel's death in 1896, at lavish ceremonies in Stockholm and Oslo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:18:07.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
