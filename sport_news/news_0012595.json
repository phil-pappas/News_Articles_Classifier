Just a sliver of space is all it takes for the sophomore running back to turn any play into a big play. Owens, a 21-year-old Kimball High graduate, has been Delta College’s featured weapon out of the backfield again this season, whether taking a hand off or executing a pass pattern. After grayshirting as a freshman and watching Theo Wofford rush for 1,066 yards in 2013, Owens has blossomed into a reliable dual threat with an impressive set of skills. Owens already has surpassed his rushing yardage total and is close to equaling his touchdown output from a season ago entering the Mustangs’ (2-3) Valley Conference opener against Chabot (3-2) at 1 p.m. today at DeRicco Field. “He’s doing special things,” Delta coach Gary Barlow said. “If the offensive line will give him an opportunity to get up to the second level, more often than not he makes something special happen when he gets that opportunity. He does special things even when he doesn’t get that opportunity.” Owens has carried the football 79 times for 484 yards and has reached the end zone five times after amassing a team-best 401 yards and seven touchdowns as a grayshirt freshman. His 6.1 yards per carry ranks 11th statewide. Owens also has 16 receptions, compared to nine last season, for 210 yards and two touchdowns. Owens has the strength to earn tough yards between the tackles, speed to blast through any crease at the line of scrimmage and enough shimmy to make the first tackler miss. And at 6-foot-2, 210 pounds, he’s a nice, big, sure-handed target for quarterback Phillip Kimble. Owens is putting together a remarkable season: He ran for 90 yards and the go-ahead touchdown on Sept. 5 at Santa Rosa, caught three passes for 106 yards on Sept. 12 against Siskiyous, ran for 188 yards and three touchdowns on Sept. 26 against San Mateo, and rushed for 127 yards and a touchdown on Oct. 3 at Butte. But just try to get Owens to talk about himself and he changes the subject to the guys in front of him. “I give credit to the line,” he said. “They make all those holes for me.” And what are Owens' goals for the second half this season? “The first half, I did OK,” Owens said. “I can get better in all phases of the game, running and being more explosive, making people miss. I just want to keep going from the first half I had and bring it on to the second half but better.” Delta’s first half of the season included an inspired season-opening victory at Santa Rosa and an upset over then-No. 2 San Mateo at home in Week 4. Mistakes in the red zone and the kicking game proved costly in a Week 2 loss at home to Siskiyous, a dreadful start sealed the Mustangs' demise in Week 3 at American River, and they entered last week’s bye off a 15-point loss at Butte, in which the Roadrunners scored 28 of the game’s final 35 points. For Delta, it’s been the best of times and the not-so-best of times, so far. “We learned a lot about ourselves,” Barlow said. “We learned what we can accomplish when we’re all on the same page, believing in each other, believing in our system and working together. And we’ve also seen what happens if we’re not.” Chabot beat Sacramento City 47-34 on Oct. 3 entering the bye. Jose Ferreira has thrown for 565 yards and three touchdowns, and the running game has been a shared load, with Ferreira leading the Gladiators with 272 yards and six touchdowns. Chabot has 18 rushing touchdowns, second-most statewide. — Contact reporter Bob Highfill at (209) 546-8282 or bhighfill@recordnet.com.
