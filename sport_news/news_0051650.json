They are physical, and they will be ready to go.”Among the returning Rockets (1-4, 0-2 7A/6A-Central Conference Conference) will be quarterback Andre Sale, who Dawson described as a Division I athlete.Even so, Dawson believes the game is winnable.“We will have to play well,” he said. “We’re going to have to play with some confidence and finish drives. I think it’s a match-up that could go either way.”Finishing drives was exactly the problem the Cyclones (1-4, 0-2) had against the Greenwood Bulldogs. Russellville moved the ball well against the undefeated Bulldogs, but seemed to self-destruct in or around the red zone.“We drove to the 30-yard line three or four times,” Dawson said. “When the field gets condensed, you have to be better and take care of the ball. That’s what we’ve been focusing on this week — ball security and playing in the red zone. We spent a lot of time working on that.”Dawson said the Greenwood game was a lot closer than the scoreboard indicated.“It sure didn’t feel like a 35-0 game,” he said. “At the end of the first quarter they were up 7-0. We put the ball on the turf, and they scored quick.”“Each week is about improvement. I think we are progressing. I think we have gotten better every week in some aspect. The wins and losses aren’t where we want them, but I think the process is working. I think we are doing the right things. There has been a marked improvement from the Morrilton game to where we are now. At some point, we will put it all together.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:27:32.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
