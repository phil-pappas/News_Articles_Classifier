Hulse Gymnasium. \nLead Hill point guard Trey Rogers knocked down a long 3-pointer to bring the Tigers within 53-49 to end the third quarter, but Cotter answered with the first nine of the fourth. \nDawson Burns converted a traditional 3-point play, and Shawn White and Maddux Adams each buried 3-pointers to send the Warrior lead to 62-49 with 6:30 remaining. After 1-of-2 free-throw shooting by Lead Hill's Cooper Lemon, Taran Eaton concluded an 11-1 Cotter run with a jumper to make it 64-50. The Tigers never climbed any closer than 12 the rest of the way. \nAdams and Matthew Gorbet led Cotter with 17 points apiece, while Eaton and Burns also found double figures with 11 and 10, respectively. \nRogers led Lead Hill with 19 points, while Tim Kalocai and Lemon added 14 and 11, respectively. \nCotter ran to a 12-6 lead, but Lead Hill climbed within two and trailed just 16-14 when Landon Martin and Maddux Adams each scored to send the Warriors' lead back to six to end the first quarter. \nMartin also scored to open the second, pushing Cotter's lead to eight for the first time, and after a Lead Hill basket, Adams drained a 3-pointer for a 25-16 advantage. After Lead Hill's Zack Cain scored, Adams converted an old-fashioned 3-point play to stretch the lead to double digits for the first time at 28-18. Cotter ended the 15-4 run with a trey by Hunter Dearmore to push the lead to 13. \nLead Hill did not go away, climbing within single digits and getting as close as 34-27 in the second quarter. The Warriors responded with seven straight — five by Dawson Burns — to take a 41-27 advantage. \nThe Tigers still didn't go away, climbing within 43-32 by the halftime break. \nWARRIORS (1-0) \nGorbet 17, Adams 17, Eaton 11, Burns 10, White 7, Dearmore 6, Martin 4, Kapshandy 3. \nTIGERS (0-2) \nRogers 19, Kalocai 14, Lemon 11, Cain 5, Turner 3, Ballestri 2. \nCOTTER 20 23 10 22 - 75 \nLEAD HILL 14 18 17 5 - 54 \nSenior girls \nNorfork 75, \nLead Hill 30 \nMarleigh Dodson scored Norfork's first 21 points of the night and went on to pour in a game-high 28 to lead the Lady Panthers to their first victory of the season. \nNorfork led just 11-8 after one quarter, but got going in the second with a 30-point quarter.

Scalf hit another trey during the frame, and Lauren Staples and Matty Dillard each added 3-pointers as well as the Lady Panthers took a 41-17 advantage into the halftime break. \nNorfork received eight points from Makayla Irby in the third quarter, including two 3-pointers. The Lady Panthers led 57-28 after three, and Dillard's second trey of the night invoked the running-clock mercy rule for the rest of the fourth quarter. \nStaples had six points off steals in the fourth, and Greve added a 3 from the top of the arc as the Lady Panthers went on a 15-0 run to end the game. \nThe Lady Panthers return to action Saturday when they play their third game in the Classic. \nLADY TIGERS (1-1) \nCain 9, Clary 8, Huebner 5, Kuykendall 4, Rogers 3, Sprinkle 1. \nLADY PANTHERS (1-1) \nDodson 28, Irby 9, Staples 9, Greve 7, Scalf 6, Dillard 6, Sisco 6, Belding 2, Gaskin 2. \nLEAD HILL 8 9 11 2 - 30 \nNORFORK 11 30 16 18 - 75 \nSenior boys \nViola 65, \nSouthside-Bee Branch 36 \nA 17-0 first-half run by the Longhorns was answered by the Hornets, but another run of 18-2 in the second half was not, giving Viola its first victory of the season. \nViola (1-1) held a 10-6 lead after one quarter and led just 13-8 when it scored 17 straight. A 3-pointer by Alex Waltrip started the flurry, and a trey by Dalton Brown capped the run to give the Longhorns a 30-8 advantage. \nThe Hornets met the run with a 12-3 run of their own to end the half, pulling within 33-20 at the intermission. Viola mounted an 18-2 run to begin the second half, receiving 3-pointers from Steffahn Smith, Dalton Lund, Brown and Keagan Dunn to push to a 51-22 lead.

Jadon Price paced Southside-Bee Branch with 12 points. \nSenior girls \nViola 25 \nFree-throw shooting played a key factor as the Lady Longhorns suffered a second straight loss. \nViola shot just 3 of 17 from the foul line, while the Lady Hornets shot 26 of 32 from the stripe. Viola, which fell to Tuckerman in its season opener on Tuesday night, falls to 0-2 on the season, while the Lady Hornets improve to 1-1. \nBoth teams started slowly as the Lady Hornets took a 5-2 lead after one quarter. A steal and layup by Amanda Martin knotted the score at 5-5 early in the second, and the teams were tied 7-7 when Southside took the lead for good. \nThe Lady Hornets led 16-9 at the half and 28-19 after three quarters. Martin hit a 3-pointer to being the fourth, but the lady Longhorns could climb only as close as 31-25 in the final stanza. \nFor local sports updates, follow Neal Denton on Twitter @BBSportsNeal and Like his Facebook page at facebook.com/BBSportsNeal 60 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/sports/2015/10/22/twin-rivers-classic-thursday-roundup/74421416/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:37:04.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
