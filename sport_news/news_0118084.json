So I think he adds just a little bit more girth in there and a little bit more experience as well.\"\nWarford struggled in his first start, a Week 2 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, then aggravated his ankle and left early the next week against the Denver Broncos.\nTomlinson has shown steady improvement the past five weeks, but the line has been the weakest link of the underachieving offense.\nCaldwell blamed Warford's injury for his poor play earlier this year, and he said the third-year blocker's experience should help the running game get going up front.\n\"He hasn't been completely capable of functioning the way he certainly has been able to perform previously, and much of that was due to his injury,\" Caldwell said.\nContact Dave Birkett: dbirkett@freepress.com.
