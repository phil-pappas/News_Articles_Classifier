Photo by Matt Goins HERALD-LEADER | Buy Photo \nGeorgetown â€” Eastern Kentucky racked up 489 yards of first-half offense on its way to a 48-17 rout of Tennessee Tech Thursday night at Toyota Stadium. \nSporting black jerseys, the Colonels (3-2, 2-0 OVC) finished the 'Blackout' game with a season-high 629 yards of offense, gashing Tech (2-4, 1-2 OVC) on the ground and through the air. \nJunior quarterback Bennie Coney threw for a career-high 351 yards and five touchdowns, while senior running back Dy'Shawn Mobley (115 yards) paced a balanced Colonel running attack that chewed up 247 yards of turf. \nThe Colonels scored on each of their first three possessions. \nEastern's defense was similarly effective, holding the Golden Eagles to 63 yards on the ground (1.8 yards-per-rush) and harassing Tech quarterback Colby Brown all night. Marquise Piton, Noah Spence and company sacked Brown five times and recorded 10 tackles-for-loss in the win. \nThe match was originally to be played at Roy Kidd Stadium but was moved to Georgetown College after threatening graffiti was discovered on EKU's campus. \nVols 'very confident' of no misconduct by coach \nTennessee Chancellor Jimmy Cheek is \"very confident\" there was \"no inappropriate conduct\" between Volunteers coach Butch Jones and a player. \nWhile speaking Thursday to the Board of Trustees, Cheek said there were rumors and misinformation about \"an alleged incident during football practice.\" The chancellor said he and Athletic Director Dave Hart have \"done our due diligence\" on this matter. \nCheek was responding to message board discussions and reports that Jones had a \"physical altercation\" with center Mack Crowder during a preseason practice. Jones said the allegation was \"absolutely ridiculous.\" \nWithout specifically addressing the allegations, Crowder sent out three separate tweets saying he was \"proud \"and \"honored\" to be part of Tennessee's program. \n\"I'm proud to be a VFL (Vol For Life) and honored to be a part of this University and Vol FAMILY,\" Crowder tweeted. \"I've given my all to this program and will continue to. I want nothing more than for Vol Nation to come together and get ready to beat the Dawgs on Saturday, as my Teammates, Coaches and I are already working hard to do. Everything else is just a distraction.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:31:49.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
