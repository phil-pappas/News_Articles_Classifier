A knee comes unhinged. Your ace hangs a curve. Ten seconds from a monster win at the Big House, a punter bobbles the snap .\nAgony eviscerates ecstasy, time and again. You get used to disappointment. You can't imagine the team you love going 23-0-2 and claiming a national championship.\nUnless, of course, you hung out on the Bluff with Christine Sinclair, Megan Rapinoe and Lindsey Huie in the fall of 2005.\nThis past weekend, the University of Portland welcomed its undefeated 2005 women's soccer team back to campus.\nThe celebration ended far too quietly Sunday when those alums returned to Merlo Field for a game that reminded a small and troubled crowd just how much has changed.\nThe Pilots lost 1-0 to Santa Clara, the sixth time this fall the team has been shut out. \"We made one mistake,\" Coach Garrett Smith said, \"and they punished us for it.\"\nPortland dropped to 6-9 in this punishing season. In the last two years, the women's team has played 34 games and won just 13 of them.\nEven the leaders of the university's legendary Villa Drum Squad admit it's tough to sustain the beat.\n\"My freshman and sophomore years, the stadium was always packed,\" says senior A.J. Vidamo. \"It wasn't that hard to keep the energy high. Last year, that started to fade. And this year ...\"\nThis year, the Pilots have scored 19 goals in 15 games. The Pilots outshot San Diego 19-1 earlier this month and lost 1-0. The Pilots are sixth in the West Coast Conference.\nThat's a disconcerting slide into mediocrity.\nAs Huie – a three-time all-American midfielder – notes, it's foolish to compare any team to UP's 2005 squad, the collegiate gold standard.\nSinclair and Rapinoe combined for 54 goals that fall as the Pilots outscored opponents 79-9 . The team's tenacity in controlling the ball and attacking the box was so extraordinary that UP allowed but 63 shots on goal in 25 matches.\nTheir mojo? \"They have a belief,\" Oregon Coach Tara Erickson said after losing 6-0 to the Pilots. \"(T)he moment they walk on the field to start the game, boom, the energy is there.\n\"And everyone has the same energy. They do a fantastic job of playing together. You can't just mark Christine. There is somebody there at every turn, at every cross.\"\nSomeone in top form. Sinclair, Rapinoe, Huie, Stephanie Lopez and Lisa Sari didn't miss a game due to injury in the 2005 season; Natalie Budge, Angie Woznuk and goalie Cori Alexander missed one each.\nThe 2015 Pilots haven't been as fortunate or as energetic. The loss of sophomore Kaycie Young and freshman Hanna Armendariz, both with torn ACLs, has been especially tough.\n\"You take five starters off any team and they're not going to play the same,\" Smith says. \"We're good enough to defeat anyone in the country. We just don't have the horses. We don't have enough fuel in the tank.\"\nNo one I spoke with at Merlo Sunday thinks that will change any time soon.\nHuie was part of Coach Clive Charles' final recruiting class before he died of cancer in 2003 . \"I came here sight unseen,\" she says. \"I'd never been to the campus. I'd never seen the facilities. I came for Clive.\"\nFew of the nation's best prep players are still enrolling at the Bluff to honor or sustain that legacy.\n\"Soccer has become much more sophisticated,\" Huie notes. \"The platform has changed. The sport has evolved, and that makes it tougher on the small schools. If I'm looking at a change from high school, I don't want to come to a school this size.\"\nAs Jacob Whitfield, another mainstay of the Villa Drum Squad, notes, women's soccer is \"still the athletic department's prize possession.\"\nAnd 10 years after Sinclair, Rapinoe and Huie graduated, the Pilots still have more NCAA championships (two) than any women's program except North Carolina (21) and Notre Dame (3).\nBut Smith's squad is hurting for recruits, aggression and confidence. The Pilots are now fueled by the best players at FC Portland, not the best of Canada or California.\nThis storied program is leaking nostalgia, not optimism, a disheartening turn.\n-- Steve Duin\nsduin@oregonian.com\n503-22-8597;@SteveDuin", "external_links": ["http://www.up.edu/ccsc/charlesbio.htm", "http://www.portlandpilots.com/custompages/Soccer-W/2005/teamstat.htm", "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2580147-twitter-reacts-as-michigan-state-returns-punters-fumble-for-td-to-beat-michigan", "http://www.portlandpilots.com/custompages/Soccer-w/2015/porws11.htm", "https://www.facebook.com/VillaDrumSquad", "http://www.ncaa.com/history/soccer-women/d1"], "published": "2015-10-19T23:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:07:54.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
