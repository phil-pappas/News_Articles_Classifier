He then joked, \"What do the GMs know? Nah, I'm just teasing.\"\nHe doesn't seem fazed by the survey.\n\"All the predictions and prognostications don't mean a whole lot,\" he said. \"Right now, we are (not) as of yet a full team. It's even hard for me to tell you what I think we are. I know what I think we can be, and certainly we can be a contender. But beyond that today, I don't think we have the right to talk about too, too much more than that.\"\nBlatt didn't care to talk about a championship run. He's focused on today.\n\"We're not even talking about that right now,\" Blatt said. \"We're talking about how we can get everybody on the same page, get all of our players back, work hard and try to make day-to-day progress.\"\nVeteran small forward James Jones took the results of the survey as a compliment, but he added that the Cavs have to put in the work now.\n\"[We're] humbled that GMs across the league respect our players and our talent and our ability to compete,\" he said. \"I think more than anything it signals to our guys that there's a belief that we can be champions. Internally, the motivation for us is not to repeat what happened last year ... [for us] to get so close, but not being able to seal the deal.\n\"Those are outsiders saying what they expect from us, but that's all irrelevant if we don't do our job.\"\nIn the survey, LeBron James was voted as the favorite to win his fifth MVP award. Cleveland is bringing back its entire core and has added contributors in Mo Williams and Richard Jefferson.\nThe Cavaliers don't appear to have a legitimate threat in the Eastern Conference, but before they get to June, there's business to tackle.\n\"What we're really concerned with is just becoming a good team right now,\" Blatt said.", "external_links": ["http://www.nba.com/news/features/john_schuhmann/nba-com-2015-16-gm-survey/"], "published": "2015-10-22T23:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:36:01.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
