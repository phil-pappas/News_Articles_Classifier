(MyNews4.com & KRNV) -- Tyler Stewart’s pass on 4th-and-10 from the UNLV 47-yard line fell incomplete with just 35 seconds left in the game, and with that, Nevada suffered a 23-17 upset to its rivals UNLV on Saturday in the Battle for the Fremont Cannon. The Wolf Pack (2-3, 0-1) scored a pair of touchdowns in the fourth quarter but couldn’t overcome a slow start against the Rebels (2-3, 0-1) in front of 29,551 fans at Mackay Stadium – the ninth-largest crowd in the stadium’s history. Nevada suffered just its second loss to UNLV in the past 11 meetings between the two programs. Stewart passed for 202 yards and a score and ran for a career-high 61 yards while junior WR Jerico Richardson set season-highs with eight receptions and 87 yards. On the defensive side, senior LB Matthew Lyons posted a game-high 12 tackles while freshman FS Dameon Baber tallied his third interception in the past two games. How It Happened: The 41st edition of the Battle for the Fremont Cannon got off to a rough start for Nevada as the Wolf Pack was shutout in the first half for the first time since Dec. 1, 2012. UNLV’s Keith Whitley scored on a 37-yard touchdown run in the first half and the Rebels took a 13-0 lead into the locker room on a 12-yard touchdown rush by Kurt Palandech just before half. The Rebels outgained Nevada, 246-102, in the first half. Four of Nevada’s six drives in the first half started from inside its own 10 yard line as UNLV used a decisive advantage in field position to force Nevada to face an uphill battle. Junior PK Brent Zuzo split the uprights from 27-yards out in the third quarter and Nevada later pulled with three points (13-10) with 10:47 left in the fourth quarter on Stewart’s 22-yard touchdown pass to Richardson. The Wolf Pack defense responded with a quick 3-and-out as the momentum appeared to shift towards the home side. UNLV quickly reclaimed momentum though with a game-clinching play as junior LB Ryan McAleenan intercepted a Stewart pass on 2nd-and-6 and ran 52 yards to paydirt, putting the Rebels ahead 20-10 with 8:27 left in the game. The Wolf Pack refused to go down without a fight and drove nine plays and 75 yards on the ensuing possession to pull within 20-17. Stewart went 4-of-4 on the drive for 49 yards before senior RB Don Jackson tallied a one-yard touchdown run – his sixth of the season. Nevada again forced a 3-and-out on the ensuing possession but the Pack offense turned the ball over on downs, setting up a 45-yard field goal from Nicolai Bornand to make it 23-17 with 1:53 left in the contest. The Pack tallied three first downs and moved the ball into UNLV territory before four-consecutive incompletions turned the ball over on downs, clinching a Rebel victory. The Wolf Pack outgained UNLV, 171-16, in the fourth quarter but couldn’t come up with a big play down the stretch to pull in front.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:46:04.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
