World's first BMX triple front flip By John Clyde, KSL.com Contributor | Posted Oct 12th, 2015 @ 1:15pm 6  YouTube: World First BMX Triple Front Flip — Nitro Circus \nBONKERS TOWN — Those of us on the Have You Seen This? team here at KSL.com love the Nitro Circus . Don't believe us? Well, take a look at this, and this , and this . Told you. We dig these crazy cats. \nWell, in addition to all the madness they bring to the great state of Utah, here's one more insane stunt, the world's first BMX triple front flip . \nNitro Circus athletes Ryan Williams and Andrew Ahumada jumped on their BMX bikes and launched off a giant ramp in hopes of being the first person to land a triple front flip. Attempt after attempt was made until Ryan Williams finally stuck the landing and became the world's first. \nNow, I don't want to take anything away from Williams, but I think I was actually the first to pull this trick off. Granted it wasn't on purpose, but still. When I was about 9 years old I was headed down Glider Lane in Sandy, Utah, on my Huffy. It was neon green and the object of desire of most of the neighborhood. Have You Seen This? First-ever BMX quad backflip People who do extreme sports are usually pretty bonkers. These guys trying to land a quadruple backflip on a BMX bike have reached a new level bonkers. \nAbout halfway down the hill I got curious and wondered what sound I could make if I rubbed my shoe on my tire. I did so, got an interesting sound and my inquisitive noggin decided to push it a little further. \"What will it sound like if I rub my shoe on my spokes?\" \nAn interesting question, but a terrible decision. My foot got caught in the spokes and I did three complete front flips and landed on my tires. I wasn't on my seat and my tires weren't on the road, but rather I was literally on top of my tires as my Huffy laid on its side. \nMine wasn't as pretty, but I think I deserve some credit. \nBack to the professionals. It was cool to hear Williams say he thought of their recently departed friend Erik Roner just before the jump. That was heartbreaking news and it was cool to see his friends and teammates thinking about him.
