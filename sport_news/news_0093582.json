He wasn’t sure how to get on the field, and thus opted to watch from afar. \nAlderson had been tasked five years prior to turn around a floundering franchise, and on that night, he finally had guided the Mets back to baseball’s grandest stage. As he soaked in the scene after the NLCS ended, Alderson noticed the happiness of those celebrating the grand achievement. \n\"It’s a very satisfying feeling, I think, for all of us that we got here,\" Alderson said two days later in a phone interview. \"We’re certainly cognizant of how much good fortune one needs along the way, but there’s a healthy amount of satisfaction that comes from it because it doesn’t happen very often. Any team that gets to a World Series is fortunate in many ways.\" \nAs the Mets aim to win their third World Series title when the Fall Classic begins Tuesday against the Royals, the team that will take the field is the result of Alderson’s methodical plan to turn to the Mets into perennial contenders. \nUnder Alderson’s watch, the Mets have developed a stellar starting rotation, and he made perhaps the best trade of the season in acquiring outfielder Yoenis Cespedes. \nA Mets title would give Alderson his second World Series ring. \n\"I look back at the different decisions we’ve made over the years with his leadership and a lot of those led to where we are today,\" assistant general manager John Ricco said during the NLCS. \"Some of them don’t work out, but if you have good process [and] good people, ultimately you’re going to be right more than you’re wrong. I’m not surprised.\" \nWhen Alderson became the general manager before the 2011 season, he inherited a team that had missed the playoffs in each of the previous four years. Alderson also had to deal with a roster filled with bloated contracts that hampered the franchise’s payroll flexibility while it was still reeling from the repercussions of the Bernie Madoff scandal. \nWhile Alderson knew it would take time, his plan was to \"develop a critical mass of players\" that would eventually allow the team to compete, and to protect those assets. \nAlderson avoided surrendering draft picks to sign free agents, and held on to his growing collection of power arms in hope that one day they would form a formidable rotation. \nA core of young players also would allow for future payroll flexibility. \nPlayers such as Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom and Steven Matz were prospects in the farm system when Alderson arrived, and now have developed into rotation mainstays. DeGrom was originally an unheralded prospect while he transitioned to a pitcher. \n\"The talent was there and the system brought it out, and we were fortunate enough to hold on to as much of that as we possibly could as the talent continued to develop,\" Alderson said. \"Our player-development system has done a great job in getting us to this point.\" \nAs the Mets have drafted and developed players well in recent years, Alderson also made several key trades that moved the franchise forward. He flipped Carlos Beltran for Zack Wheeler in 2012, and in 2012 he moved R.A. Dickey for Noah Syndergaard and Travis d’Arnaud. \nSyndergaard won Game 2 of the NLCS, d’Arnaud had an important homer in Game 4 and Wheeler could be in the rotation for the stretch next season. \nAlderson’s biggest move, though, came at the trade deadline in July when he finally acquired the bat to supplement the team’s pitching. \nWith his team in the hunt for a playoff spot, Alderson first secured a deal for Carlos Gomez only for it to be nixed due to concerns about Gomez’s hip. He ultimately traded touted pitching prospect Michael Fulmer to Detroit to get a righty slugger in Cespedes. \nCespedes helped the Mets win the NL East, and they are now four wins away from winning the franchise’s first World Series title since 1986. \n\"We already inched our way closer to being all-in,\" Alderson said of the Cespedes deal. \"We made the deal for Cespedes on the final day it was kind of pushing all the chips in.\" \nEmail: ehalt@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:05:07.534+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
