The Bays won 25-20, 25-16, 25-21. “This was a nice win for us,” Amble said. “We haven’t been playing all that well lately and we are just getting our setter Delaney Walden back, so we were doing some adjusting while she got back into it a little.” In the first set, the Bays fell behind by six, 19-13 before coming back for the win. Walden was key for Brimley in the first, serving for the last nine points, while junior Cassie Tessmer had two kills during the comeback. “Cassie played well for us tonight,” Amble said. “She got a couple big kills in that first set and really helped us out.” The Bays looked dominating in the second set, leading from start to finish, holding at least a nine-point advantage for the entire second half of the set. In the third, the Indians looked like they might be thinking about playing more than three sets as they jumped out to an early lead that they maintained until Brimley went ahead for the first time at 17-16. Three plays that were factors in the set were an ace by senior Alyssa Hyvarinen, a dig by Tessmer and a kill by Mallorie Kronemeyer that briefly tied the score at 15-15. “I was really impressed that we were able to come from behind in two of the three games,” Amble said. “We never gave up and made the plays we needed to make.” Another factor in the match was a raucous Brimley student section. Their noise and support throughout the match twice forced Newberry coach Sandy Glenn to complain to the officials. Kronemeyer led the Bays with nine kills, while Hyvarinen and Tessmer each finished with seven. All three had two blocks. Kaylee Hill had 18 assists to go along with three kills and two digs, while Katya Rozelle added 15 digs. Walden had seven assists. In the JV match, Brimley won 15-25, 23-20, 15-13. Brimley, 4-4 in match play, will be in action again at the Onaway tournament Saturday.
