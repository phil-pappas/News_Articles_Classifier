The striker held the ball up before laying off McClean on the overlap and when the Derry winger clipped in a cross to the back post, Rondon dived in front of Bassong and headed home his second goal of the season before wheeling away to celebrate with the sold-out section of away fans in the corner. \nLike last week, the goal gave Albion some confidence, and they started to zip the ball around in midfield after that. \nOnly a full-stretch save from Ruddy stopped Brunt from thundering in a second goal with his right-foot in the 64th minute, while Berahino and Rondon gave the Norwich keeper some nervy moments with their willingness to chase down the ball. \nHoolahan scuffed an effort from the edge of the box and Ryan Bennett put a header at the back post wide, but the Albion back four limited the home side to little else apart from that for the majority of the second half. \nNorwich's best chance came six minutes from time when Alex Tettey put a header from a corner over fromjust six yards out but this Albion side are frugal at the back and they held on for the sixth clean sheet of the season and all three points. \nNORWICH (4-4-1-1): Ruddy, Martin (c), Bassong, Bennett, Brady, Jarvis, Tettey, Howson, Redmond, Hoolahan, Mbokani.
