Three out of the four Democrats in New Mexico’s congressional delegation have already endorsed Clinton.\n“The minute he would have announced he probably would have peaked that day,” Sanderoff said. “It was pretty late in the game to get in and so many of the potential Biden supporters have already committed to Clinton.”\nThose ranks include Sens. Martin Heinrich and Tom Udall, and Rep. Michelle Lujan Grisham – all New Mexico Democrats.\nRep. Ben Ray Luján, a Santa Fe Democrat who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has not made an endorsement yet, at least in part because of his national party leadership role.\nLuján said Wednesday that Biden will be an asset to the eventual party nominee.\n“While Vice President Biden will not be running for president, he will continue to provide a powerful voice that will draw the clear contrast between Democrats’ agenda to help working people get ahead and stay ahead and Republicans’ record of dysfunction and disarray as they continue to be pulled further to the right by the likes of Donald Trump and the House Freedom Caucus,” Luján said.\nLujan Grisham said she welcomes Biden’s participation in the Democrats’ efforts to retain the White House.\n“I appreciate the tough decision the vice president had to make and his commitment to do what is best for his family and the many Americans who support him,” the Albuquerque congresswoman said. “While he has already given a lifetime of service to the country he loves, I’m glad to hear he will continue to focus on improving the lives of middle class families.”\nBiden’s announcement ended months of speculation and came as welcome news to the Clinton campaign. The former first lady, U.S. senator, secretary of state and Democratic front-runner for the nomination led her closest rival, Bernie Sanders, with support of 54 percent of likely Democratic voters to 23 percent for Sanders in the latest ABC News/Washington Post national poll.\nIn a statement after Biden’s announcement, Clinton praised him as “a good man and a great vice president.”\n“I am confident that history isn’t finished with Joe Biden,” Clinton said. “As he said today, there is more work to do. And if I know Joe, he will always be on the front-lines, always fighting for all of us.”\nWon’t be silent\nIn his Rose Garden remarks, Biden conceded it would be difficult to create the organization needed to make a credible run for the White House. However, he said he plans to maintain a voice in the Democratic campaign for the White House.\n“While I will not be a candidate, I will not be silent,” Biden said. “I believe that President Obama has led this nation from crisis to recovery, and we’re now on the cusp of resurgence. I’m proud to have played a part in that. This party, our nation, will be making a tragic mistake if we walk away or attempt to undo the Obama legacy.”\nFormer Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez, a Democrat who served on Clinton’s finance team, told the Journal that Biden “made the right decision and preserved a fabulous personal legacy.”\n“He’s allowed space for Democrats to unite,” Chavez said. “Had he gotten in, I was very confident Hillary would have prevailed but it wouldn’t have added anything either to the capacity of the Democrats’ ability to unite or certainly to the policy discussion. There just weren’t many issues on which they differed.”\nThe Republican National Committee cast Biden’s decision as bad news for Democrats hoping to retain the White House when Clinton is being heavily scrutinized for her use of private email accounts while secretary of state and the 2012 attack on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya.\n“The vice president’s decision not to enter the 2016 race is a major blow for Democrats, who now will almost certainly be saddled with their unpopular and scandal plagued front-runner Hillary Clinton,” said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus. “Vice President Biden was the most formidable general election candidate the Democrat Party could have fielded, and his decision not to challenge Hillary Clinton greatly improves our chances of taking back the White House.”", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/a01_jd_22oct_biden1-117x175.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:04:07.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
