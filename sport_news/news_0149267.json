On the upside, I think there's been much more discussion going on and debate and that's what we're about at the university.\"\nCU officials also gave an update on the school's attempts to diversify its revenue sources beyond tuition in the face of stagnant or declining state funding in the near future. Though already \"quite lean,\" the university is looking for new ways to cut costs in addition to discovering new revenue sources, said Kelly Fox, chief financial officer on the campus.\nAdvertisement The university is undertaking a space utilization study in the hopes of reducing the need for new buildings and has begun a paperless initiative to free up space and spend less on materials, Fox said.\nCU is also looking to professional master's degrees and online courses as new revenue streams, as well as finding new industry partners for research and scholarships, Fox said.\nAnother way to stabilize CU's income is to retain students year-over-year, Fox added, which aligns with DiStefano's goal of significantly improving persistence and graduation rates.\nDiStefano acknowledged that it's unlikely for the campus to reach his 80 percent six-year graduation rate target by 2020 , but said that shouldn't stop everyone from trying. The six-year graduation rate was 71 percent this year, up from 70 percent in 2014.\n\"That's a stretch goal that's not one that's easily achieved and I didn't want it to be easily achieved,\" he said. \"We could've said 72 or 74 (percent) and celebrated a victory in 2020. But I think it's important to have stretch goals and to really work with the faculty, work with the staff, work with the students to make sure that we're moving that needle forward.\"\nThe panel also discussed CU's reputation, which seems to suffer in the state of Colorado . DiStefano said the university has talented faculty doing groundbreaking research, but needs to do a better job communicating that value to the public at-large.\nImproving CU's in-state reputation could bring in more fundraising dollars, an area in which the university currently falls behind its peers, he said.\n\"Donors want to invest in a well-managed university and one that has a positive reputation and one that continues to improve itself,\" he said.\nIn addition to fundraising, university leaders are heavily focused on the campus's reputation because it makes a CU degree more valuable and helps attract top students and faculty members.\nProvost Russ Moore challenged all CU students and employees to take pride in the campus and to tell the university's story.\n\"It's not just something that we can all as a university community sit around and passively wait for our reputation to change,\" Moore said. \"Everybody here owns a piece of our reputation. No matter what you do at this university, from being a groundskeeper or a nuclear physicist, we all own the success of this university.\n\"We all have to be proud and we have to know who we are so we can communicate that effectively.\"\nSarah Kuta: 303-473-1106, kutas@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/sarahkuta", "external_links": ["http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28959796/cu-boulder-graduation-rate-improving-but-not-enough", "http://twitter.com/sarahkuta", "https://www.scribd.com/doc/284650545/CU-Boulder-voter-survey", "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28936724/amid-student-outcry-cu-defends-hosting-paying-gop", "http://www.dailycamera.com/cu-news/ci_28879339/outcry-from-cu-boulder-students-about-limited-seating"], "published": "2015-10-13T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:03:05.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
