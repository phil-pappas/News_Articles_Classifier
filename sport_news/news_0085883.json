(Robert Willett/Raleigh News & Observer/TNS) ROBERT WILLETT — TNS \nSouth Carolina football coach Steve Spurrier informed his team Monday night that he is retiring and that an interim coach will be named Tuesday, according to a source. \nQuarterbacks coach G.A. Mangus is expected to be named the interim head coach, according to another source. \nSpurrier, who is 70, has 228-89-2 career record at Duke, Florida and South Carolina. He is the Gamecocks' all-time winningest coach. \nSaid South Carolina board of trustee member Eddie Floyd: \"I'm shocked and I have a lot of sadness, too. I think Coach Spurrier has done so much for us and showed us we can win.\" \nThe Gamecocks are 2-4 (0-4 Southeastern Conference) to start 2015. Spurrier has never had a losing season as South Carolina's coach, and the team has been bowl-eligible in all 10 of his first seasons. \nWhile Floyd did not expect Spurrier to quit, he noticed a change in the coach during losses at Missouri and LSU in the past two weeks. \n\"He looked on TV like was real upset,\" Floyd said. \"It was a look of disbelief.\" \nFloyd said, personally, he would have preferred Spurrier remain for the rest of the season. But \"if he wants to go now, there's no reason for us to second guess it,\" he said. \nSpurrier was introduced as the Gamecocks' 32nd head coach on Nov. 23, 2004. He is 86-49 overall with South Carolina. He surpassed Rex Enright's school record for wins when he recorded No. 65 at Clemson in the 2012 season finale. \nSouth Carolina trustees chairman Gene Warr learned the news about Spurrier like most others — from texts about early media reports. \n\"He seemed to be troubled by losing,\" Warr said. \"He's always been a player who's won and a coach who's won.\" \nWarr would not question Spurrier's decision to retire immediately: \"It's his life. I'm not in his shoes and don't know how he feels.\" \nWarr said Spurrier tolerated the struggle of his early seasons at South Carolina because \"he just knew he would get it done and he did get it done.\" \nWarr said he did not have a preference on the next coach and would leave the decision to Ray Tanner, the school's athletics director. \nIn his first season at South Carolina, Spurrier led the Gamecocks to a 7-5 record and a second-place finish in the SEC Eastern Division. He was honored as the SEC Coach of the Year by the Associated Press after leading the Gamecocks to a school-record five straight SEC wins. \nHis 2010 team posted several milestones en route to a 9-5 season, the biggest of which was the school's first SEC Eastern Division title and first appearance in the SEC Championship. The Gamecocks defeated No. 1 Alabama along the way. Spurrier that season was named SEC Coach of the Year for the seventh time. \nThe Gamecocks went on to finish 11-2 in three-straight seasons in 2011, 2012 and 2013. \nIn 2014, Spurrier led the Gamecocks to a school-record fourth-consecutive bowl victory with a win over Miami in the Duck Commander Independence Bowl.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:13:40.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
