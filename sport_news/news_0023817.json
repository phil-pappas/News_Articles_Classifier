I said. 'I'm serious, we're not playing around. We'll get up and go right now.'\"\n\nSo, at 8 p.m. Sunday, that was exactly what they did.\n\nFord, his dad, son, nieces and nephew-in-law drove straight through the night. Not only were they pumped up to see the Royals play, but it was also a birthday present for Ford.\n\nThey all took turns driving, but it was the birthday boy behind the wheel most of the way.\n\n\"I had to keep up with him,\" laughed Ford's niece, Suzie Sanders. \"There was some arms coming out the window telling me to keep up. Yeah, he was excited to get here.\"\nUnfortunately, it wasn't the outcome the family hoped for, but they say they had a blast regardless.\n\nThe crew started making the trip back from Toronto to St. Joseph as soon as the game ended. That puts the family home at approximately 2:56 p.m. Tuesday, 11 minutes before first pitch of Game 4.\n\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
