Chris Mullin walked back into Madison Square Garden Wednesday morning, surveyed the scene at Big East Media Day and noted old rivals in the room. His team was picked to finish last in the conference, but he maintained that the preseason poll would not alter his practice plan today or tomorrow. He believed his vision for the program was a work in progress.\n“It’s not like I’ve been sitting at home and watching ‘King of Queens’ all day,” said Mullin, the new St. John’s coach. “I’ve had a few jobs that have had a lot of responsibility.”\nThere will be plenty for the Hall of Famer to do. His charges received just 13 votes in the preseason coaches’ poll as he takes over a program that reached the NCAA Tournament last season before head coach Steve Lavin was fired. Mullin finished filling out his staff last week when he brought former Golden State Warriors teammate Mitch Richmond on board as a special assistant. The coaches will have their hands full as they work with nine new players.\n“This year’s really going to be about establishing how we’re going to work, how we’re going to play together,” Mullin said. “I think we’re going to have to be realistic. We have to live with the results this year. From then on, when we get our roster together, the expectations will come.”\nThere are more similarities than differences to the NBA life he left, in Mullin’s mind. He likes the recent NCAA rule change that shrinks the shot clock from 35 seconds to 30 seconds, saying he liked a faster game. He has already introduced speed training and harped on ball movement with his players. He laid out plans in recent years for what he might want to do if given a team to coach. He will get the chance to unveil his philosophy during an exhibition game against St. Thomas Aquinas at Carnesecca Arena on Nov. 4.\n“We’ll be ready,” said guard Durand Johnson, a transfer from Pitt. “Coach is a confidence builder. He allows you to be comfortable in your game.”\nMullin maintained a residence in New York since leaving for Golden State 30 years ago. Californians tell him he never lost his New York accent, and he attributes that to the frequent contact he kept with high school friends and financial planners back east. He considered himself “somewhat bi-coastal” while his family’s roots grew in the Bay Area. Their transition has been the toughest part so far.\n“My biggest struggle was moving my family,” he said. “The basketball part was a pretty natural fit. I felt comfortable going back to St. John’s, New York. Having spent 30 years in the Bay Area, that’s my kids’ home. I’m coming home but they’re not.”\nPlenty of counsel has been given to Mullin as he prepares for his sideline debut. He picked the brain of Chicago Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg. Like Mullin, Hoiberg returned to his alma mater, Iowa State, to coach for five seasons before signing on with the Bulls in the offseason. Hoiberg’s best advice, as Mullin puts it, was, “Get good players.”\n“When I was a GM, it’s tough because you don’t have that ability to control things on the court,” Mullin said. “This is a step closer, but you still can’t make shots go in or know what’s going on in players’ heads.”\nSoon enough, he will know whether his plans will work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:28:33.276+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
