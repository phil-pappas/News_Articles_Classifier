The Eagles (3-3, 0-3) have lost three straight. \nThe Eagles had first-and-goal at the 1 with 29 seconds left shortly after Wake Forest quarterback John Wolford fumbled the ball with 56 seconds to play. Boston College's Tyler Rouse ran for no gain, and Jeff Smith spiked the ball as the clock hit :00. \nAfter a replay review, the referee confirmed the game was over. \nThe Eagles also had a third-and-1 at the Wake Forest 8 with under two minutes left, but Troy Flutie fumbled on a sneak and the ball squirted out of the pile and defensive back Zach Dancel recovered.
