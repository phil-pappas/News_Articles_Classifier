With that said, it is also tied as the highest rated NHL telecast ever on NBCSN (previously VERSUS and OLN) and ranks as the fourth-most watched. The only games to earn a larger audience were the previously mentioned Flyers/Bruins and Capitals/Blackhawks games, as well as Bruins/Rangers in January 2013 (956K). \nThe Sharks/Kings nightcap drew 396,000 viewers, down 11% from the same matchup last year (446K).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:25:51.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
