The Rams at least found some pathways via the pass against the Aggies, throwing for 252 yards, much of that in a flurry in trying to come back. The Broncos didn't even really allow that, holding the passing game in check at 151 yards.\nCSU coach Mike Bobo is confident there are playmakers on his team, and he joked earlier in the week he may have to get more basic in getting them the ball.\n\"We've got a bunch of receivers in my opinion that are explosive players, and we've got to find ways to get it to them,\" he said. \"We gave it to (Deionte) Gaines twice; we gave it to (Jordon) Vaden once. We might become a jet sweep team and hand it to them. We're going to figure out something.\n\"We might start Rashard (Higgins) at quarterback this week and run the double slot. I don't know. We'll pull out the wildcat. Do something.\"\nIt has been awhile since the Rams have approached dynamic, let alone explosive, which is really what the team expected to be this year, even with the loss of Garrett Grayson at quarterback. The Rams looked at the players who returned and liked the makeup of the offensive line and the depth at running back, and the receivers were a proven group of playmakers led by the All-American Higgins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:12:41.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
