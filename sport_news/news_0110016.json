He is among the team's fastest and most elusive players. Wilder said coaches will install running plays tailored to Washington before the Monarchs play Saturday at Florida International.\n\"We're going to change our offense,\" Wilder said. \"It's not going to be a lot. But we're going to play to the strengths at quarterback, just like we've always done.\"\nWilder said that could mean running the option, quarterback sweeps and quarterback draws. \"Nothing is off the table,\" he said.\nODU's offense struggled in most of its first five games, scoring a combined 21 points in lopsided losses to North Carolina State, Appalachian State and Marshall. For fans wondering why Washington wasn't inserted sooner, Wilder had a simple response: he was injured.\nWashington sprained an ankle while catching a touchdown pass in ODU's opener, a 38-34 victory over Eastern Michigan, then suffered a concussion in a 49-0 loss on Sept. 26 against Appalachian State. He missed the 27-7 loss at Marshall on Oct. 3 and wasn't cleared to practice until Oct. 7.\nWilder said offensive coordinator Brian Scott suggested that Washington take some snaps at quarterback last week and that he excelled. Wilder, Scott and quarterbacks coach Ron Whitcomb then huddled after practice on Thursday and decided that Bentley and Washington would alternate possessions.\n\"We were hoping that Shuler would play well,\" Wilder said. \"But we knew we had to win this game. It was critical to win this game.\n\"We were hoping they would both go out and lead us to touchdowns. We weren't going to change the rotation until someone got a hot hand.\n\"And David's hand was on fire from the first throw.\"\nBentley started, and the team failed to move the ball in its opening possession. When Washington entered on the second series, his first pass was a 53-yard touchdown to Zach Pascal.\nWilder calls FIU \"a pivotal game\" with good reason. ODU (3-3, 1-1 C-USA) is halfway toward the six wins the Monarchs need to qualify for their first bowl.\nODU is ranked just 107th among 128 FBS teams in the latest CBSsports.com rankings. Even so, ODU is ranked ahead of three teams it has yet to play - No. 114 Texas-San Antonio, No. 116 Texas-El Paso and No. 119 Florida Atlantic - so a bowl bid remains feasible.\n\"A win gets us to 4-3 and leaves us in great shape,\" Wilder said, adding that he expected FIU to be a big favorite. Ranked 94th by CBSSports.com, FIU was pegged by oddsmakers as an early 14-point favorite.\nPascal caught 11 passes for 231 yards and three touchdowns against Charlotte, but likely will be shadowed by FIU's Richard Leonard, a defensive back from Miami who was the conference preseason defensive player of the year.\n\"Now that one of our best receivers is playing quarterback, we have to search for that next man to make those catches consistently,\" he said.\n\"We have to have other guys step up.\"\nNotes: ODU's Oct. 31 Halloween day game against Western Kentucky will start at noon and be televised by Fox Sports Networks. However, because FSN is not carried by Cox Communications, it will not be available to many households in Hampton Roads. Cox is the dominant cable TV provider in the region and the only cable carrier in Norfolk.... The ODU-FIU game, which begins at 6, will be the only Monarchs game not on TV this year.... Free safety Fellonte Misher had 14 tackles and ranks second among career tacklers at ODU with 239. Former linebacker Craig Wilkins, a graduate assistant who coaches wide receiver at ODU, leads with 340.... Linebacker T.J. Ricks had 18 tackles against Charlotte to break Wilkins' game record of 17 in a game. \"Records are made to be broken,\" Wilkins tweeted.\nHarry Minium, 757-446-2371, harry.minium@pilotonline.com\nTwitter: @harry_miniumVP\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
