This year the popular event is scheduled for Oct. 9 through 11. \n“It’s like a homecoming for our area and visitors,” said Dewayne Hornsby, activities coordinator at the Wyoming County travel and recreation destination. “It is a good time to visit the park in the fall to observe foliage colors as well as to enjoy time outdoors. It’s been a special event at Twin Falls for many, many years.” \nStoryteller David “Bug” Stover will be at the campground campfire circle Friday at 7 p.m. The lumberjack competition is Saturday only beginning at 10 a.m. at the ballfield. A returning favorite is Don Blanchard and his chain saw craving demonstrations. Other weekend activities include hayrides, crafts, dancing with Lou Maiuri and the Appalachian Country Cloggers, the Mountain Valley Cloggers and live bluegrass music performed at the amphitheater. \nThere is no admission for this family friendly event. Pets are permitted but must be kept on leash.
