They are fifth or sixth best in the state,\" said Sather of MAU, which beat the Colonels 6-1. \"We're getting ready for a playoff game and this was a good test for us.\" \nThe visiting Patriots held a 20-4 advantage in shots on goal. Brattleboro goalies Brian McCarthy and Braxton Lynn would combine for nine saves in the first half — helping the hosts stay even until Benny Winslow's winner put MAU ahead 2-1 just before the break. \nThe Colonels didn't mark nearly as well in the second half, allowing for burials by Andrew Griffin-Leon, Matt Pellon and William Shea. The team's sixth tally came on Garrett Derosia's penalty kick. \nMAU's back line of Isaac Salem, Trey Lang and Matthew Anderson kept the pressure off of keeper Hunter Davis for the most part over the final 40 minutes, limiting the purple and white to just two chances in that time. Salem cleared the ball wide, Lang picked Jonah Goldenbird's pocket, and Anderson headed out a free kick to bust up Brattleboro attacks down the stretch. \nThe Patriots displayed good spacing and accurate passing right out of the gate. On one possession, Anderson, Shea and Griffin-Leon passed it around on the left side, with the ball eventually getting to Pellon for a good look. Advertisement \nMAU would take a 1-0 lead with 23:41 remaining in the opening half, when Pellon's missile glanced off the post and Thomas Hendery put home the rebound. It only took the Colonels one minute to answer, however, as Jeremy Rounds jetted up the gut on a breakaway and beat Davis one-on-one. \nRounds looked like the most dangerous player on the field all night long. The cat-quick freshman later missed wide with a header, got behind the MAU goalie and missed from a tough angle, and was denied by Davis from point-blank range. \n\"He is a tremendous player. He has come a long way and he will be a force over the next three years,\" Sather said of Rounds. \"All of our goals have come from freshmen in our last four games.\" \nThe Colonels also had their large crowd excited on three other occasions. Jack Maples blasted one just high from long range, Sam Ognenoff nearly bent one like Beckham on a corner, and Tanner Bell was robbed when Davis went up high to tip his shot over the crossbar. \nAt halftime, Brattleboro seniors Sam Ognenoff, Dan Burke, Jack Maples, John Wright, Eamon Burke, Chris Renouf, Sheldon Burnell, Jonah Goldenbird, Gideon May, Braxton Lynn, Brian McCarthy and Spencer Butter were all honored. \n\"This is a big class. I was just thanking them for their efforts and all of their hard work,\" Sather told the Reformer. \nThe 4-8-1 Colonels will play at Burr and Burton on Friday in their regular-season finale and likely be seeded 14th in the upcoming Division 1 Tournament.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:22:56.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
