It’s mulligan time. Do you need to rethink your World Series picks? \nLetasky -- No. I always pick the Yankees and that will never change. Out of the teams left standing, how about Royals over Cubs, or Cubs over Royals. Either way, MLB can't lose. \nKimmel -- I've been a lifelong Blue Jays believer since the trade deadline. I'm not giving that up now! \nScherting -- Originally I went with the Blue Jays' thunder and the Mets' hurling. I'm sticking with that. \nKusek -- We said Cubs and Blue Jays and we're staying with Cubs and Blue Jays. Just remember where you read it first. \nMinch -- Being a Cubs fan for life, no. But my preseason pick was St. Louis-Kansas City. I'm half right at this point and I'm OK with that. \n2. Is it time for the Dallas Cowboys to call Tim Tebow? \nLetasky -- If there is a guy who could save the Cowboys' season, it would be Tebow. Somebody needs to give this man a legitimate shot. \nKimmel -- They'd be better off calling Roger Staubach. \nScherting -- As one former Cowboys quarterback used to sing ... \"Turn out the lights, the party's over ...\" Which QB was that? \nKusek -- Jerry doesn't need to sell tickets for his circus. Tebow's phone doesn't buzz. \nMinch -- Tebow? No. Quite frankly, I'm surprised that Mr. Jones and Ray Farmer haven't had lunch to work out a deal for Johnny Manziel. \n3. Did Steve Spurrier leave at the right time, or did he quit on South Carolina? \nLetasky -- He quit. He should finish the year. One should always do whatever possible to finish what they start. \nKimmel -- You always knew the Head Ball Coach was going to do it his way. I'm definitely going to miss his one-line zingers, so hopefully ESPN has already drawn up a contract for him. \nScherting -- Normally, I would fall on the quit side of something like this. But I kinda feel he's doing the right thing. South Carolina needs to move on, and the sooner the better. \nKusek -- He walked away in mid-season. That's quitting. So why is South Carolina paying him through the end of the year? \nMinch -- I do feel he quit on his team. He made a commitment to his players and he failed to uphold that. The fact that he said he's \"resigning, not retiring\" says it all. \n4. Is Clippers-Warriors the best NBA rivalry going right now? \nLetasky -- Yes. But the league needs a fierce rivalry with either the Cavaliers or Spurs involved. And in the long run, Celtics-Lakers needs to re-emerge. \nKimmel -- Traditional rivalries have long gone to the wayside, so this one is as good as it gets in the NBA right now. Although, this Kevin Durant vs. Stephen A. Smith feud could rival Clippers-Warriors. \nScherting -- There aren't many to get excited about anymore, are there? No more Knicks-Celts, Pistons-Bulls, Pacers-Knicks, Bucks-Sixers. That's right, I threw Bucks-Sixers in there. \nKusek -- With all the player movement due to free agency, there are no true rivalries. \nMinch -- Kusek and I rarely agree. But on this one we do. There are no true rivalries. For now it has to be Golden State-Cleveland. After all, they are the favorites to go back to the NBA Finals. \n5. Hard shell or soft shell? \nLetasky -- That's a toss-up. I like the crunch of a hard shell, but you can really fill up a soft shell. To avoid the choice, I'm going with nachos. \nKimmel -- I have yet to master a technique to eat hard shells that doesn't result in the majority of the contents piling up on my plate. I'm soft shells all the way. \nScherting -- Mmmm, tacos. I go hard shell all the way. The crunch. Picking up the remainders with your hands and shoving them into your mouth. Mmmm, tacos. \nKusek -- Soft shell. More in my mouth and less in my lap. \nMinch -- Soft shell. I get my fill of crunch when I load up a batch of nachos. ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T10:23:00.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
