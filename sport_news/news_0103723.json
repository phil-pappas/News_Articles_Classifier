What was impressive about Chandrasekar was his ability to fox the batsmen on a regular basis with his probing line and length.\nWith just 125 on board in the first innings, Chandrasekar was brought into the attack by skipper Abhinav Mukund early on the second day of the contest. In his very first over, Chandrasekar got rid of Baroda skipper Aditya Waghmode who was looking dangerous. From that point of time, the match turned on its head and Tamil Nadu went on to restrict their opponents to 159 in the first innings.\nChandrasekar is someone who has been a consistent performer and has over 100 wickets to his credit in the first division league over the past two years.
