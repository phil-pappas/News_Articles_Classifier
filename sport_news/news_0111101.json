Ephraim, N.J. \"I thought that there had to be a less strenuous way to transport a harvested animal.\"\nHe developed the EASY DRAG to offer a more efficient way to drag a harvested animal out of the woods. The accessory eliminates the physical stress and strain normally involved. It saves time and effort when hauling the kill to the car or truck. The design helps prevent damage to the animal's hide and fur. Also, it reduces fatigue on the hunter's legs, back, arms and shoulders. All of this is designed to enhance personal safety.\nThe original design was submitted to the Philadelphia office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
