And they didn’t disappoint. The two stars both found the back of the net within a two-minute span late in the second half of what ended as a 1-1 draw between the Dukes (9-5-1 overall, 3-1-1 CAA) and the Pride (10-4-1 overall, 4-1-1 CAA). Herndon’s goal, on a free kick in the 82nd minute, gave the Dukes momentum and inched them closer to what would’ve been a key CAA victory, but the Pride rallied with a goal by Galton just two minutes later. After two scoreless overtime periods both squads settled for the draw. “Both teams played hard, Hofstra’s a great team,” Herndon said. “But I was hoping to win that one.” Herndon’s goal was her 10th of the season, which puts her one goal behind Galton as the second-leading goal scorer in the CAA. Initially, Herndon’s goal seemed like it could be her seventh game-winning goal of the season, but the Dukes couldn’t hold onto the lead to secure the victory at home over the first-place Pride. “We’re disappointed we didn’t make the late goal stand up, but we’re happy with a draw against Hofstra,” JMU head coach Dave Lombardo said. “They’re at the top of the table right now in the CAA.” While Galton found a way to tie the game late in the second half, for the most part the Dukes were able to stifle the CAA’s leading goal scorer as she appeared to become increasingly frustrated with the officiating and the inability to finish off scoring opportunities. “We kind of shut her out for most of the game,” redshirt senior goalkeeper Ellen Forrest said. “Steph Hendrie played a great game on her.” JMU responded positively after losing 1-0 at the hands of Northeastern University (11-4-1 overall, 4-1-1 CAA) on Friday, which is tied with Hofstra at the top of the CAA standings. While the Dukes couldn’t defeat Hofstra to get three points for a win, they were able to salvage a point and improve upon their play from Friday. “We’re not happy with a loss and a tie,” Forrest said. “But I’m happy with the way we played.” Lombrado felt the Dukes didn’t come out in full force in the first half. “We were playing very timidly in the first half and very cautiously,” Lombardo said. “I challenged them to go out and play like a championship team. You don’t win any games ducking your head in.” With the CAA championships looming and the hope of making the NCAA tournament, the Dukes are prepared to face off with either Northeastern or Hofstra again. “I wouldn’t be surprised to find both of these teams either in the semifinals or the finals,” Lombardo said. The Dukes next kick off at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington (10-5-1 overall, 3-2-1 CAA) on Friday at 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T16:51:55.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
