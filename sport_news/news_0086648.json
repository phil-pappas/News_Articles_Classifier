Honorable mention goes to Belvidere junior goalkeeper Christine Fox , who made 15 saves, including a few impressive ones. Also, Olivia Ripnyak made five saves for North Hunterdon to preserve the shutout. \nWhat it means : North Hunterdon advances into next Saturday's H/W/S semifinals against the winner of the Sparta/Pope John quarterfinal, which was played on Saturday.
