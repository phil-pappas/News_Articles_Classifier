He's also thrown a league-high seven interceptions.\nThe Cavaliers (1-4, 0-1 Atlantic Coast Conference), whose play signaling problems have led to three delay of game penalties, hope to end those backward trends on Saturday when they host Syracuse at Scott Stadium.\nThe blame does not rest solely with Johns, coach Mike London said.\n\"He's a guy that wants to make plays,\" he said. \"He wants to do the right thing. Just take the coaching and teaching, and I believe Matt will do that and look for him having one of his better games. He's going to have to.\"\nThe Orange (3-2, 1-0), like Virginia, will be looking to end a two-game losing streak.\nSyracuse is tied for fourth in the ACC with an average of 2.6 sacks, and had two last week against South Florida, but also let dual-threat quarterback Quinto Flowers run for 55 yards and a touchdown, and throw for two TDs.\n\"It's always exciting facing someone who can't run away from you,\" Orange linebacker Zaire Franklin said, comparing Johns' drop-back preference to Flowers. \"That's always better. The quarterback at USF was really quick. He was basically another running back back there.\"\nThe Orange, who beat Wake Forest early in the season, are one of six teams still unbeaten in ACC play, and they view heading into the meat of their conference schedule as an opportunity to surprise some observers.\n\"We're really confident we're going to change this thing around immediately,\" wide receiver Steven Ishmael said.\nSyracuse freshman quarterback Eric Dungey has thrown for seven touchdowns and just one interception, and will be going against a defense still seeking its first interception. The Cavaliers have just two takeaways, both fumble recoveries, in five games.\nThe Orange (15 of 16) and Cavaliers (9 of 10) rank first and third in the ACC in red zone conversions on offense, although Virginia has by far the fewest such opportunities in the league.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:21:49.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
