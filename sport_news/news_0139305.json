Todd Warshaw Updated Oct 8, 2015 at 4:06p ET Concord, N.C. â€” \nWhile the 2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series season is rapidly coming to a close, the sanctioning body and teams are preparing for the 2016 season. NASCAR will hold three more test sessions before the end of the 2015 calendar year, trying to find the best package for next season. \nFollowing this weekend's race at Charlotte Motor Speedway, teams will head to Phoenix International Raceway for a test lasting from Monday until Wednesday. Teams from Stewart-Haas Racing, JTG Daugherty Racing, Team Penske and Joe Gibbs Racing will take part in the test. The first two days will be a Goodyear tire test, with Wednesday being an open test day. \nOn Oct. 20, JGR's Denny Hamlin , Hendrick Motorsports' Chase Elliott and Roush Fenway Racing's Chris Buescher will take part in a test at the two-mile Michigan International Speedway. \nLater in the month, cars from Richard Childress Racing, Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates, RFR and JGR will head to Atlanta Motor Speedway for a three-day test. The Atlanta test was originally scheduled to take place at Auto Club Speedway. This test will be used to confirm the Goodyear tire that will be used at the track next season. \nThe final test of the year will take place at Homestead-Miami Speedway on Nov. 14 and Nov. 15. Teams from SHR, Hendrick, Richard Petty Motorsports and Furniture Row Racing will take part in that session.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:20:26.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
