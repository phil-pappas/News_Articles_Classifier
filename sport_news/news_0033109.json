Roy Hodgson’s team are finishing with an immaculate haul of 10 wins and 31 goals and, while a record of that nature is clearly encouraging, a more accurate gauge of England’s credentials will come when the serious business begins.\nRelated: Lithuania 0-3 England: five talking points from the Euro 2016 qualifier | Dominic Fifield\nThe forthcoming friendly schedule, featuring games against Spain, France, Germany and Holland, will certainly tell more about the current state of Hodgson’s side than a win against a side of Lithuania’s low ambitions and ability. England scored twice in the first half, through Ross Barkley and an own goal, before Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain added the third goal after the interval.\nNo other team in the entire qualifying process can match England’s record and Hodgson will have come away from their latest win with more evidence about Barkley’s ability to shape these matches and make telling contributions. Equally, too much can be read into this sequence of victories when the opposition, for the most part, has been generous in the extreme.\nIt is certainly not often in international football that the local fire brigade turns up with their hoses to water the pitch because the ground does not have a sprinkler system. The LFF Stadionas has only three sides, two of which are uncovered, and behind one goal there is nothing but a high fence to stop wayward shots disappearing into the adjacent high-rise block of flats.\nThe dressing rooms were old-school in every sense – in other words they resembled the changing quarters that might be found at an old school – and some of the locals clearly were not too impressed to find a considerable number of England fans in their end, going through their IRA songs. For a few minutes the brawling was as pronounced as at any England game in recent years and even after riot police arrived to divide the sets of supporters the trouble flared up again after Barkley’s deflected shot had given England the lead.\nBarkley’s confidence was clearly high after his performance against Estonia last Friday and he was ambitious enough to pull back his shooting foot from 20 yards out. His shot skimmed off the back of the centre-back Tomas Mikuckis and flew into the goal off the inside of the post.\nWithin six minutes England had doubled their lead and even at that early stage it was clear that Hodgson’s men would be finishing Group E with another straightforward win. Kane’s ability to find space in the penalty area had made him a regular threat. He had already taken aim on three separate occasions inside the opening half an hour and when he tried for a fourth time the ball came back off a post, ricocheted off the goalkeeper Giedrius Arlauskis and went in for the second goal.\nEngland were playing with a sense of control while still giving the impression they could move the ball a lot more quickly and were operating with a certain measure of restraint. As has been the case for most of this qualifying campaign, the imbalance of talent was such that it was difficult to read too much into England’s play. For long spells it seemed slightly uninspiring but at the same time they were comfortably the better team.\nWith more clinical finishing they could also have scored far more heavily. Kane, in particular, will be frustrated by how close he came on several occasions without actually managing to get on the scoresheet, particularly that moment early in the second half when Arlauskis blocked his shot and Kane was left with an exposed goal to pick his spot. A goal looked a near-certainty but the right-back Georgas Freidgeimas managed to get a small yet decisive flick on the shot to turn it behind. From the corner Barkley’s header was saved on the goal-line and again Lithuania were spared.\nAt the other end Jack Butland was being given a relatively easy reintroduction to international football, and there was little to trouble Phil Jagielka on the night he became the first Everton player to captain England. Butland did make a diving save in the first half to keep out Lukas Spalvis’s shot but the biggest lesson of his second international appearance – and the first since August 2012 – was that there are long spells in some England games when the goalkeeper occupies the role of long-distance spectator.\nJust after the hour Kyle Walker advanced from his right-back position and flicked the ball to Oxlade-Chamberlain on his outside. Suddenly there was the time and space for the Arsenal player to size up his options. Running in diagonally, he went for power and unleashed a right-foot shot into the roof of the net.\nDanny Ings, who replaced Kane just before the hour, looked busy and eager to impress and there was another substitute appearance for Dele Alli. Hodgson’s team had largely consisted of his supporting cast but, even then, the gulf between the two sides was substantial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:44:07.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
