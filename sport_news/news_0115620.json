Joe Mixon ran for 154 yards and two scores, and the Sooners (6-1, 3-1 Big 12) ran for 405 yards. \nTexas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes passed for 233 yards and ran for 58, but threw four interceptions. DeAndre Washington ran for 94 yards and a touchdown for the Red Raiders (5-3, 2-3). \nMayfield walked on and started at Tech two years ago before losing the job, and he transferred because he believed Tech had no plans to offer him a scholarship. In his first game against his former team, he helped the Sooners gain 617 total yards. \nIt was the fourth 200-yard game of Perine's career, and the most yards for the sophomore since he set the FBS record with 427 yards last season against Kansas. \nOklahoma jumped to a 21-3 lead, but two turnovers by the Sooners became scores for the Red Raiders. Reginald Davis caught a 6-yard touchdown pass from Mahomes, and Washington scored from 13 yards out to bring the Red Raiders back. \nPerine rumbled in from 10 yards out to give the Sooners a 28-17 lead at halftime. He ran for 132 yards and two touchdowns before the break, and Mixon added 67 yards and two scores. \nMark Andrews caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from Mayfield to make it 35-17. Perine got loose again for a 48-yard run and closed the drive with a six-yard score. The Sooners took a 49-27 lead into the fourth quarter. \nAbout the only negative in the game for the Sooners came early when cornerback Zack Sanchez left in the first quarter with a right leg injury. Sanchez, an All-Big 12 selection last year, was carted off and returned to the sideline later in the quarter with an air cast. \nAP college football website: collegefootball@ap.org \nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:54:20.960+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
