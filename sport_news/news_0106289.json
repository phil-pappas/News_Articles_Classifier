We get into spots like that and we battle back and get out of them,\" Spalding coach Scott Rombach said. \"I thought we played well and we'll see them again in the playoffs. This time it will be up there, so we will look to do to them what they did to us on our senior night.\" \nFor Spalding's three seniors, Mensch, Dalce and Sarah O'Callaghan, the loss was bittersweet, but they know that some revenge can be inflicted when the playoffs come around. \n\"I think we kind of dug ourselves into a bit of a hole here and there and we just got it together a little too late in the games,\" said O'Callaghan, whose 36 digs sent her over the 1,200 mark for her career. \"As that final game got tighter, I think the pressure really got to us.\" \nMensch, when questioned about whether frustration set in with the way the sailors blocked her, said \"They had really good blocks in the middle and everywhere I went, they would be. I had to go down the line a bunch of times. Whenever my ball gets blocked, it just makes me want to hit the ball harder and do better.\" \nDalce knows that when attention is paid to Mensch, she will get more opportunities. But she was also well aware of the tremendous job the Sailors did blocking the Spalding hitters. \n\"I think they were getting their blocks there more. I think I was able to be more effective when I got the ball. I think I was very effective with my team,\" said Dalce. \"They learned where I was hitting and were able to put their blocks and cover where I was hitting.\" \nSpalding finishes its regular season at 9-6 and 6-3 in conference play and should be the third seed. Mount de Sales, which still has a match to play against defending Class 4A state champion Severna Park on Thursday, sits at 12-4 and 6-1 in conference.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:06:40.315+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
