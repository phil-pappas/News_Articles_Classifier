What began as a report of Sarkisian looking “not healthy” when he arrived on campus Sunday has turned much, much uglier.\nSources reportedly told TMZ that Sarkisian was “very emotional” and crying when he appeared to show up intoxicated at the USC athletic facility.\nOur sources tell us … Sark appeared intoxicated at the USC athletic facility on Sunday — and at one point, he was sobbing in a corner. That’s when staffers decided to get USC athletic director Pat Haden involved.\nHaden says he spoke with Sarkisian on the phone and determined he was “not healthy” — and ordered him to take a leave of absence.\nThe more we hear, the more it becomes obvious that Sark is in serious need of help. Players reportedly noticed that their head coach wasn’t sober when he showed up for a meeting on Sunday. This is the second time his drinking habits have come to light, as Sarkisian also got into trouble before the season when he was drunk and acted inappropriately at a team event .\nIf that wasn’t bad enough, Sarkisian may have been drunk while coaching during a game earlier this season. His behavior has also already cost USC one recruit . Hopefully Sark gets the help he needs in a treatment program.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://larrybrownsports.com/college-football/steve-sarkisian-leave-of-absence-usc/277554", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAflciH.img&quot;}}", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/12/steve-sarkisian-emotional-crying-before-escorted-from-usc/", "http://larrybrownsports.com/college-football/daelin-hayes-decommits-usc/277607", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAffHQO.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAxGGq&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Was", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Washington", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfgzES.img&quot;}}", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_ncaa&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live", "http://larrybrownsports.com/college-football/steve-sarkisian-apologizes-drunk-salute-to-troy/271082", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfi42A.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;USC&#39;s", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://larrybrownsports.com/college-football/report-steve-sarkisian-may-have-been-drunk-during-arizona-state-game/277598", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;UW", "http://larrybrownsports.com/college-football/usc-steve-sarkisian-sober-special-teams-meeting/277594"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:38:34.921+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
