The opportunity to milk more disrespect from the national masses that question the validity of the Michigan State program — especially as it pertains to Michigan. The opportunity to finally lay to rest the perception that the only reason why Michigan State grew to such dominance was that the Wolverines wallowed in mediocrity the past seven years.\nDantonio would love nothing more than having Michigan ranked in the top 10 nationally entering next Saturday's intrastate renewal in Ann Arbor.\nThat's a very real possibility after the Wolverines' thorough domination of No. 13 Northwestern on Saturday in Ann Arbor. Considering the national desperation in propping up Michigan as quickly as possible and restoring the ideal that \"they're back,\" even though there are serious questions regarding the quality of the ranked teams they've beaten, it wouldn't stun anyone if the Wolverines advanced into the upper echelon of the nationally ranked Sunday.\nThe Spartans played lowly Rutgers on Saturday night in their final tune-up before the Michigan game.\nGet ready for a crazed week. Fan bases from both teams shouting full throated that they're better and ready to prove it. And unlike previous seasons in this game, there will be a valid argument on both sides because — for a change — this will be a contest between good teams.\nRegardless of the path both teams trekked, it will be a big stage next Saturday.\nFinally.\nThe best thing for the series is having both teams playing for enormous stakes. The Wolverines are much better, much sooner than most thought, if only because they look more organized and play with a better-defined identity of physicality on both sides of the scrimmage line. Granted, it could be argued that victories over Brigham Young and Northwestern were triumphs over fraudulently ranked teams.\nBut couldn't the same case be made today regarding Michigan State's second-week win over then-No. 7 Oregon?\nThe Ducks no longer are in the national rankings.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nSeidel: Credit Jim Harbaugh for U-M football's revival\nThis is the only time when the Michigan State-Michigan rivalry truly means something. When there's actually something worthwhile within the grasp of both teams besides bragging rights. The Spartans know that a victory would catapult them into serious College Football Playoff discussion — even if they finished 11-1 with a loss at Ohio State Nov. 21.\nMichigan knows that a victory over the program that has tormented the Wolverines the past seven years would definitively legitimize the dramatic improvements under Jim Harbaugh. It would rapidly accelerate the rebuilding clock, perhaps making the regular-season finale between Ohio State and Michigan truly meaningful for both teams for the first time in several years.\nThe Spartans haven't played well recently. They've won, but they haven't won convincingly enough to sell those outside of Big Ten territory that they're a legitimate playoff contender. And it can't be ignored that Ohio State remains the top-ranked team in the nation, but the Buckeyes have looked nothing like the best team in the land.\nThey were a 33-point favorite against Maryland on Saturday. They won, remaining unbeaten, but it was far from a dominating effort.\nSmack talk's fine. But it's time for Michigan State and Michigan to prove if they're legitimate in a far more important context. There's an opportunity for either team to step forward and seize their destiny.\nThe Spartans should love the hype approaching this week. It will be all about Michigan's resurgence, how that's good for the overall state of college football and how Michigan State will be reduced to pretender status in another seven days.\nDantonio will love it. And that's what makes this game a bigger deal than previous years, because both teams enter this week preparing from a sense of strength.\nContact Drew Sharp: dsharp@freepress.com.
