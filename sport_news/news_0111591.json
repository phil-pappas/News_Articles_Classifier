SMITH / STAFF COLUMNIST\nPublished: Oct. 15, 2015 Updated: Oct. 16, 2015 1:20 a.m. LOS ANGELES – The last game of the Dodgers’ disappointing season got ugly before it ended ugly, with a national TV audience catching Dodgers right fielder Andre Ethier and Manager Don Mattingly exchanging what appeared to be heated, hostile words, screaming and walking in opposite directions in the dugout during the bottom of the third inning.\nAnd this was when the Dodgers held a 2-1 lead over the New York Mets in what would turn out to be their loser-gets-nothing Game 5 defeat in the NLDS on Thursday night at Dodger Stadium .\nEthier, 33, the two-time All-Star, and Mattingly both said after the game that the heated discussion had nothing to do with a conflict between them and had no bearing on the game.\n“We weren’t arguing,” Ethier said. “We were just arguing actually a call on the field, not something between me and him, but something that happened on the field. There’s a certain sequence, something that happens after the play, and it didn’t happen, and he was questioning why, and I was telling him why.”\nMattingly said he was trying to settle Ethier down about an umpire’s call. “I didn’t want him thrown out of the game, and Andre’s pretty emotional.”\nIndeed, this was an intense game, the Dodgers’ season hanging on every play and every at-bat, and Ethier, longest tenured Dodger (10 seasons) and arguably the most frustrated of the Dodgers who’d like to win a World Series, knows how hard it is to get this far.\nAnd to win an NL West title. And to lose in the NLDS once and now twice.\n“I think every year is the best shot,” he said. “Honestly, I’ve been asked that a lot lately, comparing some of the playoff teams I’ve been on, and it really is just a blur ...\n“I really did have that feeling that we had a good chance to go far. That’s why this one definitely does sting more than I have felt in the past. You see how many opportunities we had.”\nHe knows how many opportunities he had, and that’s the painful part of what happened on Thursday night, the numb that will soon turn to ache as the reality and the finality set in.\nEthier sprinted and dove to make a spectacular catch on a Michael Conforto fly ball in the second inning and skidded chest first into the warning track, sparing a potential double or triple.\nHe did some things well, like making that catch and singling in the first inning. But he went 1 for 4 on the night, hitting fifth and behind a hot Justin Turner and leaving him stranded twice.\nHe knows he has a heavy hand in why the Dodgers were 2 for 13 with runners in scoring position.\n“I battled up there but I didn’t come through,” Ethier said. “There were opportunities I had when JT swung the bat so well tonight and the whole series, and I didn’t come through in the opportunity to get him to third base or to score him.\n“When you don’t do that, especially in the middle of the lineup, you lose a big opportunity, a big chance to score runs. He (Jacob deGrom) out-executed and out-pitched me.”\nIn the fourth inning, Ethier ran down Travis d’Arnaud’s sacrifice fly that trailed foul and considered dropping it. But Ethier said he didn’t have time to think about doing anything but making the catch, which led Daniel Murphy, who had stolen third on a Lucas Duda walk and a Dodgers’ defensive gaffe, to score the second and tying run.\n“I talked to Zack (Greinke) right after that and asked him what he thought,” said Ethier about possibly intentionally dropping the ball. “I told him what was going through my mind in that play.”\nA lot was going through Ethier’s mind all game. A lot was pouring from his mouth for part of it. A lot of chances were lost, along with his cool, on the last night of the season that sadly had an all-too-familiar finish.\nContact the writer: masmith@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:27:22.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
