Everything I did turned out to be good.\"\nSeventh-seeded Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova became the highest ranked player left after defeating Stefanie Voegele of Switzerland 6-4, 6-0.\nThe 29th-ranked Russian was broken when serving for the first set at 5-2 before taking seven straight games to close out the win.\nIn her sixth semifinal of the season, Pavlyuchenkova will play 99th-ranked Serbian qualifier Aleksandra Krunic, who beat Mona Barthel of Germany 7-6 (6), 6-3.\nAlso, Johanna Larsson of Sweden advanced to the quarterfinals by defeating Alison Van Uytvanck of Belgium 6-4, 7-6 (2).\nThe 59th-ranked Larsson rallied from 4-2 down to take the opening set. She saved a set point at 5-4 in the second before wrapping up the win on her third match point.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
