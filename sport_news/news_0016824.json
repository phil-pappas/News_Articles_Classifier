That’s how raggedy a bunch the Bears were.\nTwice the Lions touched punts that the Bears recovered. On a punt in overtime, Golden Tate returned it to midfield, but the Lions were flagged for a block in the back to drag them deep into their territory.\nJay Cutler committed his regularly scheduled turnover, this one a special little interception in the end zone in the third quarter.\nYou can yammer on about another last-minute drive that helped get the game to overtime, but there’s a turnover every game with this guy.\nTrust him at your own risk. If you think he has suddenly changed into a different guy, you’re kidding yourself. He’s the same guy with the same tendencies to make soul-crushing mistakes.\nFox’s defense turned out to be as miserable as his clock management. I mean, 37 points to the Lions? A team that struggles to score 21?\nThe Lions entered the game with one of the NFL’s worst offenses, but the Bears allowed 546 total yards and 353 in the air, including a 57-yard bomb to set up the winning field goal in overtime.\nWho’s the genius who let Harold Jones-Quartey take Calvin Johnson deep in overtime?\nThe one real threat the Lions have, and the Bears let him make the biggest play of the game.\nThe winless Lions apparently haven't cornered the market on ugly play and bad coaching.\n Detroit Lions Matthew Stafford Calvin Johnson Golden Tate", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56241349/turbine/ct-bears-lost-to-lions-roasenbloom-20151018"], "published": "2015-10-19T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:28:59.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
