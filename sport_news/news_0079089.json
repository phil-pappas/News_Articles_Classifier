Andrew Luck’s shoulder injury is rather mysterious.\nAdChoices The Indianapolis Colts quarterback has missed back-to-back games despite practicing in that span, and head coach Chuck Pagano has told reporters several times that Luck is “trending in the right direction.”\nPagano doubled-down on that phrase Wednesday after Luck was a limited participant in practice, but the signal caller’s own words suggest he could return Sunday against the New England Patriots.\n“Pretty darn close to where I want to be,” Luck said after Wednesday’s practice, according to The Indianapolis Star.\nWhile Luck officially was listed as limited Wednesday, reports from Colts practice paint a brighter picture as far as his availability for Sunday night’s AFC Championship Game rematch is concerned.\nAndrew Luck seems to be throwing normally and without duress at practice today.\n— Bob Kravitz (@bkravitz) October 14, 2015\nAndrew Luck: \"Certainly took the next step...on track.\" Luck said he continues to do more & more. \"Doing everything with less restriction.\"\n— Kevin Bowen (@KBowenColts) October 14, 2015 Luck threw the football 25-30 yards on more than one snap with the Colts’ first-team offense Wednesday, according to The Indy Star. This is a step forward from the last couple of weeks in which Luck watched as backup QB Matt Hasselbeck took snaps with the first-team offense.\n“If he’s ready to go, we’ll put him out there,” Pagano told reporters of Luck. “That’s as far as I’ll say on that. He’s a great communicator and we’ve got great docs and great trainers working with him. When he’s ready, we’re going to put him out there.”\nFor now, Luck still is day to day.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/bkravitz/status/654321846041620480", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/KBowenColts/status/654359892371898369", "http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/nfl/colts/2015/10/14/full-practice-for-luck-return-looks-likely/73925752/"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:34:54.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
