(AP) - Investigators are trying to find the cause of a basement fire at a New Hampshire restaurant that's forced it to close its doors for at least three weeks.\nWMUR-TV reports ( http://bit.ly/1haeiKB ) fire crews were called to Derry Restaurant and Pizza on Tuesday afternoon and found smoke coming from the rear of the building.\nOfficials say their efforts to extinguish the blaze were hindered by an electrical panel that had to be de-energized. It took less than two hours for firefighters to control the fire.\nThe entire property sustained smoke damage. The building also houses two apartments above. Restaurant officials say it will be closed for three weeks to a month.\nTwo families were temporarily displaced.\nNo one was hurt in the fire.\nInformation from: WMUR-TV, http://wmur.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
