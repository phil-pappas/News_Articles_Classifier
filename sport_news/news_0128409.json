Mandatory Credit: James Guillory-USA TODAY Sports The Carolina Hurricanes suffered more than just a loss in the standings on Thursday. Defenseman James Wisniewski is expected to undergo surgery on his left knee after tearing his ACL during the 2-1 setback to the Nashville Predators, the team announced on Friday. Fellow blue-liner Michal Jordan likely will be inserted into the lineup in place of Wisniewski, who is estimated to be sidelined six months.\nAdChoices Wisniewski did his best to keep his spirits up on Friday, taking to social media to thank concerned fans.\nI suffered a isolated torn ACL last night, thank you for the thoughts and prayers, I'll be back ready to go asap.. #perseverance\n— James Wisniewski (@jameswisniewski) October 9, 2015\nAcquired from the Anaheim Ducks at the 2015 NHL draft, Wisniewski logged just 47 seconds of ice time before his leg was pinned along the boards during his second shift of the game. The 31-year-old was expected to help guide Carolina's young defense as the team attempts to end a six-year playoff drought.\nWisniewski collected eight goals and 26 assists in 69 games with the Columbus Blue Jackets and Ducks last season. A fifth-round pick of the 2002 draft, Wisniewski recorded 53 tallies and 221 assists in 552 career contests with the Chicago Blackhawks, Montreal Canadiens, New York Islanders, Blue Jackets, Ducks and Hurricanes.\n(h/t Carolina Hurricanes )\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/jameswisniewski/status/652571271503462400", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/perseverance?src=hash", "http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=782508&navid=nhl:topheads"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:07:29.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
