Fox isn’t confident in the NCAA’s effort to increase scoring. \n“I think the shot clock change, the preliminary thought is that if we shortened the shot clock that scoring is going to go up,” Fox said. “Well, I think great defensive teams are saying, ‘hey I only have to guard you for 30 seconds instead of 35.'” \nAfter rolling out a 30-second shot clock and an expanded block/charge circle for last season’s postseason NIT Tournament, the NCAA adopted the policy for the 2015-16 season. \nThe move comes as the NCAA continues to to try increase scoring. \nTake Georgia, which averaged 68.2 points per game last season, good enough for 152nd nationally. The season before, and the first year following a rule change that tried to make the game less physical, Georgia averaged 68.9 points per game and ranked 262nd in the country. \nFox said the biggest change in offense won’t come from a shortened shot clock or from eliminating physicality. The rise and fall of points per game across college basketball will fall on the shoulders of the referees. \n“I think the greatest impact will be how we officiate the games,” Fox said. “Is the game going to be called as closely as it was two years ago or will it be as physical as it was last year? That will have the greatest impact on scoring.” \nThis is the first reduction in the shot clock for college basketball since the 1993-94 season, when it was dropped 45 seconds to 35 seconds. Not a single player on Georgia’s roster was alive when that season started, and Fox was in his first season as an assistant coach at Kansas State. \nWhile skeptical, Fox embraces the idea of playing faster and trying to score more often. Part of this comes from the strength of the returning backcourt with Charles Mann, Kenny Gaines and J.J. Frazier. \nBut it also comes from this season’s frontcourt being more capable of running the floor. All three of Georgia’s frontcourt freshmen, Derek Ogbeide, Michael Edwards and E'Torrion Wilridge, cited their ability to get up and down the floor as one of their strengths. \nYante Maten, the team’s most experienced returning frontcourt player, spent the summer improving his conditioning because of the expectations of a faster Georgia team. \n“I definitely am. I’ve really been working on my mobility and getting off at a faster pace,” Maten said. “It’s something we have worked on a lot this offseason.” \nThe team’s guards welcome the faster pace and hopefully more offense, even if their internal clock is sped up by a shorter shot clock. \n“We adjust to it and we will be fine. It doesn’t really matter but coach will push us there but I’m looking forward to playing more up and down,” Mann said. \nGaines says a faster game fits his “erratic” style of play better. He also likes the idea of playing defense for 30 seconds on one possession instead of the usual 35. \n“That whole five seconds is definitely does make a difference,\" Gaines said. \"The five second difference is definitely something good for college basketball overall.” \nFox does wonder about the effectiveness of the new rules. But regardless of the changes, he planned to play at a faster pace this season. That means more possessions, likely more points and hopefully more wins. \n“We felt that this team was going to be able to play faster anyways, so the change in the shot clock is something we supported and I don’t think it is something that will have a huge impact on how we try to play,” Fox said. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:34:38.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
