He dded two rushing scores to his pair of 39-yard passing TDs. Also completed passes to 8 different players.\nDEFENSE: A-\nNeutralized the Big Ten's highest-scoring offense to 11 punts, nine after its lone TD. The Lions called it college football's first \"no-huddle defense.\"\nSPECIAL TEAMS: C-\nDifficult day for kicker Joey Julius, who missed two extra points (without regular holder Chris Gulla) and pulled a kickoff OB. Punter Daniel Pasquariello looked better. Watch those onside kicks.\nCOACHING: B+\nUsed play-action effectively and implemented some nicely designed plays, two of which Hackenberg converted into passing TDs. Bob Shoop's defense overall was dominant.\nOVERALL: B+\n\"We just wanted to play as ugly as we possibly could for four weeks, because we were just saving all of that stuff up for this week,\" coach James Franklin said.
