They were still in the game,” Frolik said after the morning skate. “I'm very happy with what (the Jets) did for me. The two years there were great. They were great to me and the organization was great too. I got the opportunity there to play more and have more ice time again and I'm thankful to them.”\nWhile Frolik didn't want to get into the numbers, he didn't sound bitter about not securing the $5 million per season he was believed to be seeking on a multiyear deal of four or five years.\n“It's part of the hockey business and it is how it is,” said Frolik, who won a Stanley Cup with the Chicago Blackhawks in 2013 before joining the Jets in a draft-day trade for a pair of draft picks. “I think we were really close with them and it was just a couple of different numbers. In the end, that's the hockey business and you can't really do anything about it.”\nFrolik, 27, will suit up against his former team tonight at Scotiabank Saddledome as both clubs play their final game of the pre-season.\n“I've had that before, playing against my old teams and it's nothing really new,” said Frolik. “I've got a few buddies there for sure. But I'm going to play them like any other team. I'll just put the focus on my game.\n“I might chirp (friend and fellow countryman Ondrej Pavelec) if he's going to be in the net. Obviously, we're good buddies. It's going to be nice to see the boys again.”\nAs for being an unrestricted free agent for the first time, Frolik said he dealt with a myriad emotions, but mostly enjoyed the process of determining what his next move was going to be.\n“It's was definitely something different and something new for me,” said Frolik, who was chosen 10th overall by the Florida Panthers in the 2006 NHL Draft. “It was kind of interesting. You've got the week before free agency and I got the chance to be in Florida and meet with a few teams there. It was a cool experience to be in.\n“Obviously, it was a very difficult decision in the end. But you have to take the fun part out of it. It happened and now I'm here.”\nFrolik concedes there was a stressful element to the choice as well.\n“Definitely. I'm a guy who is always thinking a lot,” said Frolik. “It's a difficult decision and you've got just a couple of minutes to decide. You don't have much time there, (to sign) on the (dotted) line. But when I had the meeting with Calgary, I had a good feeling coming out of the meeting and I ended up here.”\nSince he's now with his fourth organization, Frolik is no stranger to having to fit in with a new group and that's helped with his transition with the Flames.\n“It's been good. Obviously, new faces, new guys and you try to find a little bit of chemistry. Every day I feel a little bit more comfortable here, the guys are great and hopefully we're going to have a good year,” said Frolik, who will skate with Lance Bouma and Mikael Backlund tonight. “It's a good organization and I'm happy so far here. Hopefully, I can get similar ice time to what I got in Winnipeg and hopefully the role will be the same as in Winnipeg.\n“Maybe I can play on the (penalty kill) and maybe get a little taste of the power play too.”\nFrolik put up 34 goals and 84 points over two seasons with the Jets and has been quick to leave a positive impression with his new teammates.\n“He's a hard worker and you don't really get to see that side of guys when you don't play with them,” said Flames captain Mark Giordano. “He's going to be a guy we rely on. You can tell right away that he plays the game right at both ends. That's the type of guy you want on your team.\n“He's a low-maintenance guy. He comes in, he does his job and doesn't say much. But he's a friendly guy and easy to get along with.”\nFrolik also caught the attention of head coach Bob Hartley by finishing first in the Flames' fitness testing, but he didn't stop there.\n“He's come as advertised,” said Hartley. “Unbelievable hockey. Great person, fun to work with. He's adding to our depth. Defensive responsibilities, offensive responsibilities, he's probably one of the most underrated two-way players in this league.”\nAs for the Jets, they'll be looking to end the pre-season on a high note after winning consecutive games to improve to 2-2-2 overall.\nJets captain Andrew Ladd and forward Adam Lowry will sit out with minor ailments, leaving several players on the bubble one final chance to impress and state their case for inclusion on the opening-day roster, which is due on Tuesday at 4 p.m. CT.\nHere's how both teams are expected to start tonight:\nJETS\nNic Petan-Bryan Little-Blake Wheeler\nMathieu Perreault-Mark Scheifele-Nikolaj Ehlers\nThomas Raffl-Alex Burmistrov-Drew Stafford\nChris Thorburn-Andrew Copp-Anthony Peluso\nToby Enstrom-Tyler Myers\nMark Stuart-Jacob Trouba\nBen Chiarot-Paul Postma\nOndrej Pavelec (Michael Hutchinson)\nFLAMES\nJohnny Gaudreau-Sean Monahan-Jiri Hudler\nLance Bouma-Mikael Backlund-Michael Frolik\nMichael Ferland-Sam Bennett-Josh Jooris\nBrandon Bollig-Matt Stajan-David Jones\nMark Giordano-Dougie Hamilton\nKris Russell-Dennis Wideman\nBrett Kulak-Deryk Engelland\nKarri Ramo (Jonas Hiller)\nKen.wiebe@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter.com/WiebeSunSports\nMichael Frolik praises Winnipeg from new home in Calgary\nBy Ken Wiebe , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Saturday, October 03, 2015 02:19 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 03, 2015 09:36 PM EDT\nCALGARY – Michael Frolik is happy with how he's fitting in with his new team and holds no animosity toward the Winnipeg Jets after leaving the team as an unrestricted free agent this summer.\nFrolik, the versatile forward, said the Jets were among the finalists to secure his services before he ultimately signed a five-year deal worth $21.5 million with the Calgary Flames that carries him through the 2019-20 season.\n“(The Jets) were still there, right until the end.
