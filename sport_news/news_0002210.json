TROY FLEECE/Regina Leader-Post Photograph by: Troy Fleece , Calgary Herald \nWhen Jerome Messam awoke on Wednesday morning, he expected to get taken on an emotional rollercoaster thanks to his favourite Major League Baseball team. \nIt turned out that his Canadian Football League team was the one that threw him for a loop. \nIn the stands at the Rogers Centre for the Toronto Blue Jays’ Game 5 against the Texas Rangers, Messam got a text message from his friend Junior Turner, a defensive lineman with the Calgary Stampeders. \nThe message read, ‘Welcome to the winner’s circle.’ \nBefore the bruising running back could answer his pal from Brampton, Ont., his phone rang. It was interim Saskatchewan Roughriders GM Jeremy O’Day with the news he’d been traded to the Stamps at the deadline. \n“When I found out I turned my phone off and enjoyed the game so none of that stuff would get to me,” said Messam, whose first baseball game he has attended in 10 years turned out to be one of the most memorable ones in team history — a 6-3 comeback win. \n“That experience was awesome. It took 22 years and I feel that game will put them on a World Series run.” \nNow the 30-year-old pending free agent turns his attention to another playoff run. \nWith a day to digest the news that he’s now wearing Red and White instead of green, Messam is pumped to jump into a playoff race. The Riders (2-13) were preparing to finish out a disappointing season in which they lost No. 1 quarterback Darian Durant, fired their head coach and GM, and then traded their veteran backup QB Kevin Glenn (earlier Wednesday). \nYet Messam was one of the bright spots for the Riders this season. He’s first in yards from scrimmage with 1,290 and second in rushing to B.C.’s Andrew Harris (866-826). \nMessam joins three-time CFL most outstanding Canadian Jon Cornish in the Calgary backfield, although neither will suit up Saturday against the Toronto Argonauts during a game played in Hamilton, because of the Blue Jays taking over Rogers Centre. Matt Walter draws the start instead. \nMessam realizes the situation in Calgary, and Cornish is expected to return from a head/neck injury when the Stamps come back from a bye next weekend. It will be a crowded backfield, and he might be riding shotgun during the playoff push. \n“I would be lying if I said it hasn’t crossed my mind,” Messam said. “I will worry about the things I can control and that’s to play well. We will see how it plays out. \n“Jon is a great running back and he’s obviously the guy there in Calgary. I just want to help any way that I can.” \nTurner couldn’t be more thrilled that his friend will be joining him in Calgary. The two formed a bond as high school rivals in Brampton and then it grew while they played on a city team. For years, Messam has hopped from B.C. to Edmonton to Montreal and then Saskatchewan, so Stamps defenders won’t mind seeing him in their uniform now. \n“I enjoy playing him because he brings the best out in me,” Turner said. “I know I will have to wrap up and really drive my feet to tackle him. He’s almost as big as me. We’re the same height and I maybe outweigh him by 30 pounds. He brings a load. I’m happy to have him on this team to see what he can bring to our offence. \n“Running backs aren’t supposed to be that size and move as well as he does. Having him can really help us down the road.” \nCoincidentally, the first team Messam will face is the Roughriders, who are coming into McMahon Stadium for a Halloween meeting. \n“It’s going to be tough,” Messam said. “I don’t know the emotions I will feel that day. I have a lot of friends on that team and I pretty much know what they do on defence, so I will have the upper hand in that sense. It will be tough emotionally being my first game suiting up for Calgary playing against my old team.” \nMessam’s emotions were sky-high on Wednesday, right at the moment Jose Bautista drilled that homer to send Rogers Centre into a frenzy. \n“I have it on tape,” Messam said. “It was an electric feeling. My girlfriend called it. She said he hasn’t had a moment in this series yet and it’s his time. Next swing of the bat, he knocked it out of the park.” \nSo does this prognosticator have a feeling about getting traded to Calgary? \n“She said I’m going to win a Grey Cup this year. Stay positive. Stay focused and play hard and I think you will go and win the Grey Cup.” \nibusby@calgaryherald.com \nTwitter.com/buzrbe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:05:44.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
