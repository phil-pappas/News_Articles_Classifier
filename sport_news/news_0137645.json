Kershaw will pitch opposite of Jacob deGrom; Greinke will start against Noah Syndergaard and Anderson against Matt Harvey.\nThe Dodgers did not name a starting pitcher for Game 4, which will be played at Citi Field in New York on Tuesday. Kershaw is presumably a candidate to pitch that game on three-days' rest.\nKershaw pitched on short rest in each of the last two postseasons.\n\"You kind of have to just go case-by-case,\" General Manager Farhan Zaidi said. \"A lot of times you have to see how a series evolves before you make any decisions on that.\"\nThe implication was that if the Dodgers are leading the best-of-five series after three games, Alex Wood could pitch Game 4.\nKershaw's last two postseasons ended with crushing defeats against the St. Louis Cardinals, in the NL Championship Series in 2013 and a division series last year.\nAsked whether Kershaw had something to prove, Manager Don Mattingly said he wasn't qualified to offer an opinion.\n\"There's probably few people in the world that can actually talk about Kershaw,\" Mattingly said. \"If you don't talk to Sandy Koufax or Bob Gibson or something like that, there's really no one else that's really on his level.\"\nPuig for Van Slyke?\nScott Van Slyke continues to be bothered by a swollen wrist, increasing the chances Yasiel Puig will be included as a reserve on the 25-man division series roster.\nAt the team's workout Tuesday, Van Slyke attempted to hit in an indoor batting cage.\nAsked how that went, Mattingly replied, \"It didn't go as good as I'd like. It's better than it was, but still not where we need it to be.\"\nMattingly didn't sound particularly enthusiastic with Puig's form, either, saying he looked \"like a guy that hasn't played in a while.\"\nPuig was part of a group of hitters that participated in a simulated game Tuesday against the likes of Anderson, Joel Peralta, Juan Nicasio and Carlos Frias. The former All-Star right fielder has played in only two major league games in the last five weeks. He was sidelined with a strained hamstring.\nMattingly tried to be optimistic.\n\"You never know what's going to happen at this time of the year,\" he said.\n(c)2015 Los Angeles Times\nVisit the Los Angeles Times at www.latimes.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1733644", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1733644&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/baseball/s-1733644&h=Clayton+Kershaw+will+pitch+Game+1+for+the+Dodgers+against+the+New+York+Mets"], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:17:59.081+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
