Coach Gregg Rehberger watched and analyzed his team intently during the Patriots’ light workout Friday. \nClad in a white, long-sleeved “WHGS” T-shirt, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, Rehberger occasionally shouted orders and instruction to the likes of Meghan Griffin, Cameron Santers and Callen Vander May, among many others. \nThe attention to detail he offered in team drills was meticulous. The reminders in the post-practice huddle were thorough, ranging from today’s weather forecast and what to wear to what to eat — and not to — from that moment up until the first kick today. \n“Let’s be 100 percent prepared for this,” he said to a group of anxious and excited Patriots circled around him. \nOn the eve of the Patriots’ biggest game of the season to date — the Passaic County tournament final — even the smallest of details mattered. And rightfully so. Wayne Hills, in its final tune-up, was preparing for its chance at history. \nThe Pats have won 11 county titles (the most in county history) but haven’t three-peated since winning four in a row from 1984-87. The desired feat will be within reach today for the tournament’s top seed when its takes the field at Clifton Stadium against rival and second-seeded Clifton in yet another county final. It will mark the fifth straight year these two rivals meet with a PCT championship at stake. \n“It’s always one of our goals to at least get here and be in this position,” Rehberger said on the walk back to school from the turf field at Wayne Hills. “We at least want to give ourselves the chance.” \nCollectively cold, drenched and disappointed following a 2-1 double-overtime loss to the Mustangs on Oct. 1 played in a freezing rain — and decided by a penalty kick — the Patriots have been waiting for this moment for three weeks. The rare regular season contest featuring the perennial two best girls soccer teams in Passaic County with a combined 18 titles has only added to the intrigue and storylines entering today’s much-anticipated showdown. \n“At the time [of the first loss], we didn’t know if we’d see them again,” Rehberger said. “Them, along with [Wayne] Valley are our two biggest rivals. It’s something we’ve discussed about seeing them again. I think we walked away from that first game upset, but understanding that changes needed to be made if we were going to run into them again in a game like this.” \nSanters, Wayne Hills’ junior facilitating center midfielder, offered a soft smile when posed the question of just how much the Patriots wanted their chance at redemption against the Mustangs after losing the regular season heartbreaker. \n“A lot,” said Santers, who will enter today’s match with a team-best seven assists. “Definitely a lot.” \n“It was just a really tough game, but we moved past it,” junior center back Olivia Prusakowski said. “It’s given us even more motivation to get where we are now, though. We’re ready for this.” \nRehberger thinks it is the first time Wayne Hills and Clifton will meet in the final after having played in the regular season. Both teams, though, were more than familiar enough with each other already, having met in the past four (and five of the last six) finals. With two such evenly-matched teams vying for the title, it will be all about execution today. \n“It’s definitely a bit of a chess match,” said Rehberger, noting that the last three finals have all been decided by 1-0 outcomes, including last year’s ending in double-overtime. “I don’t think either of us change up what we do too much at this point in the season. I do think we’ve changed since the last time, but we’ll do what we normally do. \n“Whatever team executes better will probably be the one that comes out on top.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:32:32.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
