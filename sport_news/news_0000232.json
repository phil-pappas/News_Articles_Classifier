There's a lot of perseverance in there from guys that have been here for the other two and getting knocked out. Hopefully we're able to have a little bit of luck but play great baseball and see where it goes.\" \nClayton Kershaw went down the list of proven veterans like Jimmy Rollins and Chase Utley added by Frideman, the club's new president of baseball operations, to boost the Dodgers' depth this year, then the left-hander mentioned the reliable rookies Joc Pederson and Corey Seager. \nA pair of aces among baseball's best never hurts either. Kershaw and Zack Greinke form quite the 1-2 punch for the Dodgers, who are still fighting for home-field advantage the rest of the way ahead of their best-of-five division series against the New York Mets. \n\"It's a fun mix, it's a talented mix and hopefully it's the right mix,\" Kershaw said after pitching the Dodgers to a third straight division title in an 8-0 thumping of the defending champion Giants on Tuesday night. \"We've still got something to play for. We're still trying to fight the Mets for home-field advantage.\" \nThe first-timers such as Seager were giddy running around AT&T Park's beer-soaked visiting clubhouse. \n\"It's awesome. It's on a different level,\" Seager said. \"It's fun and I'm going to go enjoy it.\" \nThat's exactly the kind of maturity and professionalism Mattingly insists is the biggest change with this group. Not to mention the desire to prove something on the October stage at last after all of the recent postseason failures that remain so fresh. \n\"A lot more professional I feel like this year, our guys get ready to play. I've never really worried about them about being ready,\" Mattingly said. \"I could trust them. They got down to business on the field and that was a good feeling for me.\" \nNow, the Dodgers are on to a third straight year in the playoffs for the first time in franchise history — poised to take the next step at last and get back to the World Series at last. They got to celebrate a third straight NL West title on the home field of the defending World Series champion San Francisco Giants, and while that might have been a little bit sweeter everybody involved just wanted to clinch and get it out of the way given a four-game losing streak had brought on some minor anxiety for the men in blue. \nEven Kershaw acknowledged the pressure of taking the ball and getting it done for his team a day after Los Angeles lost 3-2 in 12 innings on a night Greinke pitched. If had dragged on much longer, \"you start getting a little nervous, you start panicking a little bit,\" Kershaw said. \n\"We've got a veteran group with a lot of young talent, which is a great combo,\" Kershaw said. \"We've got guys that have been there before, from Chase to Jimmy, we've got guys that don't know any better.\" \nReigning NL MVP and Cy Young Award winner Kershaw has been on the mound for the last two playoff defeats to the Cardinals, including in a four-game division series a year ago in which he lost Games 1 and 4. He lost in the 2013 elimination game of the NL Championship Series, too. \n\"I've been through it now a bunch, I think this is my fifth postseason now,\" Kershaw said. \"I don't know if you can get wiser from failing all the time. I know what that feels like. Small successes obviously. I don't know, I'll let you know when I get there.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:19:32.629+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
