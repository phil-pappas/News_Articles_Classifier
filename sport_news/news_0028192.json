(AP) - Marlon Mack rushed 179 yards and a pair of second-half touchdowns Saturday to help South Florida end a three-game losing streak with a 45-24 victory over Syracuse. Mack scored on bursts of 25 and 45 yards, while averaging 8.5 yards per carry. Quinton Flowers threw for a season-best 259 yards and two TDs, and the dual-threat quarterback also scored on a 2-yard run that put the game out of reach in the fourth quarter. USF (2-3) stopped a skid that included losses to Florida State and Maryland on the road, and Memphis at home in the team's American Athletic Conference opener. Syracuse (3-2) lost for the second straight time after matching its victory for all of last year in the first three weeks of the season.
