If the Tigers should slip up, however, you can be certain the Vikings will be there to take advantage. And after winning three straight contests, East Hall enters the stretch run with plenty of confidence. \n\"We took on that tough non-region schedule early to learn how to compete, and our kids now have a great inner feeling that they’re never out of it,\" East Hall coach Bryan Gray said. \"I’ve got a great confidence in our kids, and it’s exciting.\" \nThe Vikings stormed back from the 13-0 deficit, taking a 20-13 lead -- only to watch Franklin pull back even at the interval, 20-20. The difference proved the third quarter, as receiver Jacquen Hopkins produced two touchdown catches. An 8-yard strike to Hopkins -- who finished with eight catches for 95 yards and three scores -- from quarterback Austin Parker gave the Vikings a 27-20 advantage. Then a 39-yard scoring hook-up between Hopkins and Markese Jackson made it 34-20. \nFranklin County tried its own as Tyrique David ripped off a 43-yard touchdown run to pull within 34-27 with 1:51 left in the third quarter. \nThat was all that East Hall's defense would allow, however, shutting out the Lions the rest of the way. \n\"The last three games (our defense) has been exceptional,\" Gray said of a unit that allowed 375 yards rushing to Franklin County -- all rushing. \"We’re undersized but we’re quick, and we’ve been getting great penetration from our defensive line. The secondary has also been lights out, and they’re a big reason why we’ve won three in a row.\" \nThe Vikings offense kept things balanced, passing for 195 yards -- Parker completed 22 of 26 attempts for two scores and an interception -- and rushing for 169, including 106 yards and two touchdowns on 24 carries for Jiel Vargas. Jackson also rushed for 57 yards. Vargas scored both of the second quarter touchdowns. \n\"We’re excited; we’re happy,\" Gray said. \"We’re going to enjoy this and celebrate, and then we’ve got Fannin County next week, and they look like a whole different entity this season.\" Associated Categories : Sports , High School Sports , Friday Game Night Associated Tags : High school football, East Hall football © Copyright 2015 AccessWDUN.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:11:40.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
