But tonight, I was first-string and this was the first time I played the entire game. I'm very excited that we won.\" \nMartell Marshall led Southern (3-2, 4-3) with 180 yards rushing and a touchdown on 21 carries. \nThe senior missed several plays throughout the contest because of cramps. Junior quarterback Marvin Fleming added 53 rushing yards and two touchdowns. \nFor the Panthers (1-4, 2-5), Terrel Brent, a junior, finished with 166 yards and two touchdowns on 17 carries. He also forced a fumble on the defensive end. \nMastbaum surprised the Rams by grabbing a 6-0 lead in the first quarter. The Panthers led late after Terry Mumford's 96-yard fumble return with 11 minutes, 2 seconds left in the fourth. \nFleming punched in the eventual game-winning score, a 5-yard run with 5:53 left. \nThat just left Francis' unlikely heroics. \nThe native of Jamaica attends Audenried, which doesn't have a football team. He played mostly junior varsity at Southern last year, his first playing football. \n\"This feels good,\" he said. \"But at the same time I know I can do better. I want to improve and not make everybody surprised that I can do this and do it more consistently.\" \nSouthern 0 8 6 8 - 22 \nMastbaum 6 0 6 6 - 18 \nM: Terrel Brent 12 run (kick blocked) \nS: Martell Marshall 2 run (Samid Williams from Marvin Fleming) \nM: Terrel Brent 89 run (run failed) \nS: Marvin Fleming 1 run (run failed) \nM: Terry Mumford 96 fumble (pass failed) \nS: Fleming 5 run (Marshall run)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:45:26.290+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
