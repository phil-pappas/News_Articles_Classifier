Where to watch Argentina v Namibia \nArgentina v Namibia gets under way at 12pm BST on Sunday 11 October. Live coverage is available on ITV HD and BBC Radio Five Live. \nPreview \nArgentina start Sunday's game knowing a second-place finish is theirs. New Zealand's victory over Tonga on Friday night means they will settle for a quarter final meeting against either Ireland or France, whoever comes out on top of Pool D's decider later in the day. \nThat is unlikely to faze them, however. Los Pumas will enter their final group game as one of the competition's in-form sides, having shrugged off the challenges of Georgia and Tonga following their spirited defeat to New Zealand in the opening game. Those 12 tries scored in those two wins solidified their position to the extent that coach Daniel Horcade can afford to make sweeping changes ahead of their quarter-final on Saturday 17 October. The 11 changes made brings the average age of the squad down to 26, with only scrumhalf Martin Landajo, lock Guido Petti, blindside flanker Pablo Matera and outside back Matias Morini retaining their places in the starting XV, while there will be a well-deserved evening off for Nicolas Sanchez. Jacques Burger retired after he was ruled out of Sunday's match Getty \nNamibia's campaign will end with them rock bottom of Pool C, but they can finish with their heads held high after recording their first point in their history of this competition after shocking Georgia before that spirited comeback at Sandy Park. \nSunday's match at the King Power Stadium in Leicester was meant to be a final swansong for captain Jacques Burger, who will retire after the competition. But a concussion suffered in the first half against Georgia means he has already played his last game for his country. Rohan Kitshoff will be hoping to fill the void as captain in Burger's role as openside flanker.
