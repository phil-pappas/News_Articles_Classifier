The match kicks off at 5pm. \nThe Samurai Blue currently occupy second spot with seven points from three games - two less than the impressive Syrians, who boast a perfect record, thanks to wins over Afghanistan, Singapore and Cambodia. \n“It is a very important game for us and nothing less than a victory will be enough,” said Japan coach Vahid Halilhodzic at a press meet on Wednesday. \nHaving been held to a 0-0 shock draw by Singapore in its home opener, Halilhodzic said, \"The match against Syria is going to be the hardest and most important of our fixtures this year. They have a couple of good players and they don't need many goal-scoring opportunities. But we've got excellent quality and experience ourselves.\" \n\"I have watched about eight of Syria's matches and I know each player's strengths and weaknesses and the way they play,” said the wily tactician. \nThe Japan coach has called up 20 year old Salzburg forward Takumi Minamino to enhance the team's potency up front. Japan will also be buoyed by an undefeated record against Syria, with seven wins and a draw from their previous encounters. \n\"We need to get ready to win the battle. We've got excellent quality and experience. We will come out with confidence and keep winning,\" the coach said at a press meet attended by nearly 40 Japanese journalists. \nThe Bosnian, appointed in February, has called up his Europe-based stars Keisuke Honda of AC Milan, Borussia Dortmund's Shinji Kagawa and Shinji Okazaki of Leicester City. \nA defeat against Syria would cast doubts on Japan's chances of making it to Russia. Only the eight group winners in the second round of Asian qualification are assured of a place in the third and last stage, where they will be joined by the four top second-placed finishers. \nSyria has been asked by the FIFA to play the game in Oman due to the political turmoil back home. \nFajr Ibrahim, Syria's coach, said, “Oman is our home and we are ready for Japan. My players have been together for a long time and they rely on strong bonding. We have had a good run and we hope to continue it and bring cheers to the people of Syria with a maiden spot in the World Cup.” \nOther matches (Thursday): Group A: Timor Leste vs Palestine, Saudi Arabia vs UAE; Group B: Kyrgyzstan vs Tajikistan, Jordan vs Australia; Group C: Bhutan vs Maldives, Qatar vs China; Group D: Turkmenistan vs India; Group E: Singapore vs Afghanistan; Group F: Vietnam vs Iraq; Group G: Myanmar vs Lebanon, Kuwait vs South Korea; Group H: North Korea vs Philippines, Bahrain vs Uzbekistan.
