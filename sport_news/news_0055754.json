The Lebanon, Ky., native assumed the point guard role after Janee Thompson suffered a season-ending leg injury last season. During the regular season, Epps averaged a team-high 14.3 points per game, which ranked eighth in the SEC. Within league action, she was atop the SEC with 15.1 ppg and had the second-highest field goal percentage at a .413 clip. Additionally, she was eighth in assists (2.9), ninth in free throw percentage (.750), and sixth in minutes played (33.6). Epps earned a spot on the prestigious Nancy Lieberman Award watch list, given annually to the nation’s top point guard. \nThe poll also marked the announcement of the SEC Preseason Media Poll. Kentucky was picked to finish fifth in the league, while 2015 SEC champion South Carolina was tabbed as the top team in the conference with 265 votes. The Gamecocks have three players on the Preseason All-SEC team, including Preseason Player of the Year Tiffany Mitchell. \nFollowing South Carolina in the preseason poll are Tennessee (248), Mississippi State (215), Texas A&M (207), UK (205), Ole Miss (169), Missouri (165), Arkansas (138), Georgia and LSU (128), Vanderbilt (80), Florida (78), Auburn (65) and Alabama (34). \nThe Wildcats open the 2015-16 campaign with an exhibition game against Union University on Sunday, Nov. 8 at 5 p.m. ET in Memorial Coliseum. Admission is free and the game will be streamed live on SEC Network+. Events on SEC Network+ are available exclusively on SECNetwork.com and on WatchESPN via computers, smartphones and tablets. \nSeason tickets for the 2015-16 season (includes Rupp Arena games) are available now for $65 online at UKathletics.com/tickets or by calling the UK Ticket Office at (859) 257-1818 or (800) 928-2287.
