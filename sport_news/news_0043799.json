The third, and often overlooked, phase of football was equally impressive for the Belichickans. That would be special teams, which was superb in every aspect. “Well, first of all I thought that we got real good play from our specialists in the game, which is always a key for good special teams play,” coach Bill Belichick said Tuesday in a conference call. “Our kickers, our snapper, holder, returners, all of the guys that are there that had a key role in the ball handling on those plays.” Kicker Stephen Gostkowski remained, like the Patriots, perfect on the season. He teamed with holder Ryan Allen and rookie long snapper Joe Cardona to make all six of his kicks: three extra points from 33 yards and field goals from 34, 49 and 57 yards, the latter tying the franchise record set by Adam Vinatieri in 2002. Gostkowski also had six touchbacks on seven kickoffs, giving him 24 on the season. That total ranks second in the NFL. Allen kept a low profile the past two games, punting just once. He was called on four times Sunday and came up big each time. The third-year pro from Louisiana Tech excelled situationally, placing three balls at the Dallas 13-yard line and one at the 20. Those kicks played a prominent part in the Cowboys starting their 12 drives on average at their 18, which all but doomed the Tony Romo-less offense to defeat. Danny Amendola averaged 13 yards on four punt returns. Amendola, who took over as the primary punt returner this season to ease the workload on Pro Bowl receiver Julian Edelman, is tied for eighth in the league with an average of 11 yards. Amendola got a great-double team block from Logan Ryan and Patrick Chung to spring him for a 25-yard return early in the first quarter, setting up a field goal that gave the Patriots a 3-0 lead. “We did a real good job with our corners on the gunners on the punt team in order to get the return started and Danny did a good job of running, so it was really a good group effort all around,” Belichick said. Conversely, the Patriots held the Cowboys to 21 yards on one kick return and an average of 3 yards on two punt returns. “The coverage was a combination of good kicking and good coverage and (our) returning yardage I’d say was a combination of some good holdups and good running,” Belichick said. “A little bit of everything there.” While the Patriots had to cover four punts Sunday their season total stands at a paltry nine. Allen has punted so few times he doesn’t qualify to be listed among the league leaders. And because of Gostkowski’s big leg, the Patriots have only had to cover seven kickoffs this season. Conversely, they have yet to have a legitimate kick return this season. Their only return came on a squib kick that monstrous tight end Michael Williams lugged back 8 yards. With a lack of game reps, practice takes on added importance for the kick return and two coverage units, which include core special teamers Brandon Bolden, Nate Ebner, Jonathan Freeny, Jordan Richards, and captain Matthew Slater. “Obviously, games are different than practices,” Ebner said. “But we work it as hard as we can in practice to prepare ourselves for the game and whatever comes up in the game we just have to be ready to take it on as it comes. Like I said, each week is different and we try to build from week to week and try to get as many reps as we can to be ready for it when it comes up.” Belichick pointed out there are plenty of things that don’t come up every week, including goal-line defense and 2-minute drives. But at some point they will. “You just keep preparing for them, and when it happens, you have to be ready to go,” said Belichick, who was a special teams assistant with the Detroit Lions in 1976. The Patriots were ready to go Sunday and departed Dallas with another big win, special teams contributing to the outcome as much as a stifling defense and a slow-starting offense. —Contact Rich Garven at rgarven@telegram.com.
