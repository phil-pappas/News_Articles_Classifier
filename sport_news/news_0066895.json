After days of hard practice, along with some tough decisions regarding his career, this Haryana lad will be exposed to his first professional bout at the Manchester Arena on Saturday night against a seasoned Britain's Sonny Whiting.\nVijender, ever since landing in the Northern English city of Manchester on September 8, has spent a majority of his time at the Francis Warren-owned boxing academy, training under the watchful eyes of renowned trainer Lee Beard.\nTalking about his opponent Whiting, who has already promised to put him \"through hell\", Vijender said his punches would do the talking in the ring. Rochester-based Whiting has fought three bouts till date and has a 2-1 win-loss record.\n\"He will hit me and I will hit him, but the end result would be in my favour. I will first study his movements and then unleash my barrage of punches. I always prefer to let my boxing do the talking. I am a man of action, not words,\" Vijender cautioned his opponent.\nThe 29-year-old from Bhiwani has been going through rigorous sparring sessions besides indulging in outdoor activities to keep himself fresh before this crucial bout. In fact, Vijender has to find time in between regularly to give television and magazine interviews to create hype for his maiden debut fight, being titled 'World War-III'.\n\"Let me tell you, everything is different between the amateur and professional boxing. I start my training around 10 am, but I don't know when it will end. This includes 8-10 hours at the academy and gym, with running around the city on fixed days. It's unlike what I used to train with the Indian squad at the NIS centre in Patiala,\" Vijender said on the eve of his fight.\nThe bout has already created hype around England and celebrities like English footballer Wayne Rooney and boxing sensation Floyd Mayweather Jr. are likely to watch Vijender's bout.\n\"As my first fight week approached, Lee put me through intense sparring sessions that included working on my body attacks and adding more effectiveness to my punches. Lee wouldn't let me go until I get my punches and foot movement right. He is also working on my mental strength. Pro boxing is not all about physicality; it's much more to do with mind games. You have to be one step ahead of your opponent mentally to gauge his next move inside the ring. Quick body movement and accurate punches are the primary requirements, but half of the battle is won in minds,\" the strapping six-footer added.\nVijender also informed that Lee, who has formerly trained pro stars like Ricky Hatton and Floyd Mayweather Sr, has put him through sparring sessions with a couple of WBO champions for the last one week.\n\"My fight will comprise four rounds (as opposed to three in amateur boxing), so it's important to think like a pro boxer. I have been training alongside Jack (Catteral) and Jimmy (Kelly). Their knowledge of pro boxing is definitely helping me a lot,\" he said.\nVijender knows that promotional part is very important to create a right kind of hype for an event, which has generated a lot of interest not only in Manchester, but back home as well.\nThe cost of a ticket at the 20,000-plus capacity Manchester arena is anything between 400 and 500. And, Vijender has been getting a lot of calls from his fellow Indian amateur boxers and friends to know about the timing of his bout.\nVijender has been living out of the suitcase these days, which is quite different from his amateur boxing days in NIS, Patiala.\n\"Here, it's very different. I sometimes feel homesick as there isn't any Indian boxer to talk to. After returning to my apartment, I don't have anyone to interact with. It's all very hectic out here with long training sessions from morning to evening, coupled with series of promotional engagements,\" said the Olympic silver medallist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T18:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:12:29.878+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
