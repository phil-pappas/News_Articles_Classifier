Imagine a stentorian baritone enunciating with perfect articulation and gravitas: \nTexas A&M. Ole Miss. One will disappear into the long night of irrelevance. The other goes forth, the flickering spark of championship hope still lighting a dark, uncertain path. \nAlabama: Look ahead to the coming showdown with LSU at your peril. Faltering Tennessee. Can. With a single victory transform agony into ecstasy. And Butch Jones ... can keep his job. \nAuburn and Arkansas. Coaches who hate each other. Two proud teams, once contenders, gather the tattered remains of their dreams about themselves to cloak the shame of a season gone horribly wrong. A battle. For pride. Auburn at Arkansas Noon, ET, SECN \nDisappointment and resolve fill the crisp October air as two struggling teams collide in the rolling hills of Arkansas, each seeking redemption and … OK, enough of that. \nArkansas had a week off after a respectable loss at Alabama, and Auburn got a lift its last time out, edging Kentucky, 30-27. \n2015 has not been kind to the contestants – Auburn was picked to win the league and Arkansas was thought to be a very big, very fast dark horse. \nThe Tigers are 4-2, which sounds better than it is. Arkansas is 2-4 which is every bit as bad as it sounds. \nGive Arkansas the edge in desperation – and in tacking guys and covering receivers, at which it is steadily improving while Auburn is not. \nAuburn QB Sean White and receiver Ricardo Louis got a little something going against the Wildcats, connecting five times for about 115 yards and two TDs. Let’s see if they can hook up enough to open the run against an Arkansas front seven that seems to be finding itself. Tennessee at Alabama 3:30 p.m. ET, CBS \nLong ago, when the world was young, the Third Saturday in October was a major date on the American sports calendar. Tennessee and Alabama were great rivals. Each game forced a reckoning, the winner had to reach deep into its soul and find the greatness within. \nThe luster has waned since Saban came to town – eight straight wins as indifferent fortune spun its wheel, and with a big assist from much better recruiting, cast the Tide up and the Vols down. \nBut this has always been a streaky series , with the two teams taking turns dominating each other for years at a time. Since 1955, the shortest win streak for either team was four (UT twice, 1967-70), the longest 11 years (Bama, 1971-81), and Tennessee won 10 of 12 (1995-2006, with one UA win vacated). Then the current Bama run started. \nSo beware the Vol, Alabama. You never know when the wheel will start to roll again. \nTo end Bama hegemony, Tennessee’s mistake-prone offense must achieve perfection against Alabama’s all-destroying defense, which last week intercepted four Texas A&M passes, returned three for long touchdowns and another set up a field goal. \nBut wait! Alabama’s most consistent offensive lineman, center Ryan Kelly, went out with a concussion in the second period of the Texas A&M game last week, and the running game became merely good, not devastating. Alabama’s not the same offense with him out of the lineup. \nThe Vols defense is spotty, but did hold off a Georgia comeback attempt after the Dawgs jumped out to a big lead, and that was Jones' first win over an SEC team other than South Carolina, Kentucky and Vanderbilt. \nAnother streak Tennessee would like to break is a 23-game dry spell against top 10 opponents. \nOK. OK. The new era of the Volunteer will probably not begin Saturday. But you never know - everything's got to start sometime. Texas A&M at Ole Miss 6 p.m. ET, ESPN \nTexas A&M will try to reform after a devastating loss to Alabama last week, and Alabama fans will be wholeheartedly cheering for Aggie victory, because the Tide’s hopes hinge on the Rebels losing at least one more conference game. \nOle Miss is coming off an embarrassing, lopsided loss to Memphis. The Land Shark defense collapsed – the great Robert Nkemdichi, significantly, suffered a second-quarter concussion and missed the rest of the game. If he’s not cleared to play Saturday, that’s trouble. \nThe other ones: Western Kentucky at LSU, 7 p.m. ET, ESPNU – Can Leonard get 300, or will Les pull him to rest before the bog ride to Tuscaloosa. Kentucky at Mississippi State; 7:30 p.m. ET, SECN – Kentucky is still in search of respect. State is trying to keep it. \nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
