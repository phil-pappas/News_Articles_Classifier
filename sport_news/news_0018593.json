We have 860 seats for every playoff game so our group will be out there every day,\" Darren Meenan of Douglaston, New York, said before the Mets' 13-7 win. \nMeenan, 34, founded The 7 Line, an independently owned Mets-based clothing website. \nRich Sidell, a 65-year-old Brooklynite, wore a homemade T-shirt featuring Utley's face at the center of a bullseye and handed out flyers featuring the same image. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T10:41:59.076+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
