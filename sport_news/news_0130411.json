He was 10 for 15 for 186 yards in a sparkling first-half performance. \nOn the first play from scrimmage, Russo hit Raheem Blackshear (15 carries for 84 yards) for a 51-yard gain. Three plays later, his 16-yard throw to Mark Webb provided an early lead. \nLate in the first quarter, Russo rolled right and found Shawn Thompson for a 7-yard touchdown.
