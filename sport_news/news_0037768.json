The tie was the third of the season for Whitman (1-8-3, 1-4-3 NWC), while the draw was the first of the fall for the Pioneers (7-4-1, 3-4-1). Midway through the second half, the teams were still scoreless when de Guzman placed a left-footed shot from 25 yards out into the top-right corner of the Lewis & Clark goal to change the scoreboard at the 67:49 mark. The goal came four minutes after the Pioneers nearly broke the tie with a shot off the crossbar. Lewis & Clark sent one shot wide of the Whitman goal shortly after de Guzman’s score, then found the back of the net with the equalizer in the 80th minute. Anna Thorndike redirected a long cross from the right touchline, slipping her shot past Missionaries goalie Haley Case. The only other shot coming in regulation time required a Case save in the 87th to keep the game knotted at 1-1. Halfway through the first overtime period, Whitman’s Brianna Brown was able to get off a shot on frame, but L&C’s Sandra Alvarenga, who finished the day with eight saves, was able to come up with the stop. The Pioneers answered with a pair of off-target shots in the next four minutes, which sent the contest to another period of extra action. The Missionaries gained the first chance at a game-winner just over three minutes into the second OT, but Alissa Soo’s attempt sailed wide of the goal. Four minutes later, Whitman was on the attack again and Chelsea Day nearly ended the battle, but Alvarenga again came to the rescue of her L&C teammates with another save. With time winding down in the second extra period, the Pioneers were able to get one last shot off on goal, but the attempt came from just over the midfield line and Case was able to easily scoop up the game’s long final shot. Whitman returns home for a 5 p.m. contest Wednesday against Whitworth.
