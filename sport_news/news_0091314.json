Quick Clicks Cop fired for Tasering man without cause \nCyle Larin fired a blast in the 33rd minute, which deflected off the hands of Impact goalkeeper Evan Bush and into the net to give Orlando the early lead. \nThe team said Impact forward Dominic Oduro leveled the match in the 44th minute with a controversial goal. The ball appeared to be secured by Orlando goalkeeper Tally Hall but it was kicked away by Oduro and into the net. \nSeb Hines would ultimately break through in the 80th minute, volleying a shot past Bush following a broken corner attempt, the team said. \n\"I'’s never easy winning games of football that you have to win. It comes with extra pressure. Winning football games is hard enough as it is without going into the game knowing that anything less than the victory won't do,\" said Coach Adrian Heath. \"But I thought the attitude of the players was absolutely magnificent and I thought we completely deserved the three points. A few weeks ago I said I believe this team could win four or five and I still think we can finish the season off unbeaten, and if we do I think that'll give us a great chance.\" \nThe Lions will have a bye next weekend, but will return to league play Oct. 16, against New York City FC. The team said kickoff is set for 7 p.m. at the Orlando Citrus Bowl. \nCopyright 2015 by ClickOrlando.com. All rights reserved.
