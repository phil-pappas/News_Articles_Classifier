The school renamed its basketball weight room the Mike Conley Jr. Strength and Conditioning Room.\nCOLUMBUS, Ohio -- Mike Conley spent part of this morning sharing his college history with Grizzlies teammates on the campus of The Ohio State University.\nThe Griz play their third preseason game tonight against the Cleveland Cavaliers at 6 p.m. in the Value City Arena at Schottenstein Center.\nConley, who celebrated his 28th birthday on Sunday, landed with the Grizzlies as the fourth overall pick in the 2007 NBA draft. He played for the Buckeyes just one season but packed a lot of memories in that brief period.\nAs a freshman, Conley averaged 11.3 points and was the leader in the Big Ten Conference in assists with 6.1 per game. The Buckeyes won the Big Ten championship and eventually had their NCAA tournament run end with a loss to Florida in the title game. On the road to the championship game, Ohio State defeated Central Connecticut State, Xavier, Tennessee, Memphis and Georgetown.\nOhio State is also where Conley met Mary Peluso and they married in July 2014.\nIn 2013, Conley donated $500,000 to Ohio State athletics. The school renamed its basketball weight room the Mike Conley Jr. Strength and Conditioning Room.\nIn this installment of “Three Questions,” Conley talks about his return to Ohio State and what this game against the Cavs will mean.\nWhat’s going through your mind with regard to playing an NBA game at your alma mater?\n“It’ll be a fun day for me and my family, and for my teammates to get to see the university. It’s going to be great.”\nCan you believe how much time has passed given you haven’t played an organized game at Ohio State since you were 19 years old?\n“It is weird. I’m sure I’ll be so excited, and have a little jitters here and there. But those are my people. I love all of the fans in Buckeye Nation. I’m excited to be able to play in front of so many family members and friends and people I only get to see over the summer.”\nWhat, if anything, can you get out of this game since you’ll face Cleveland Oct. 28 on opening night in FedExForum?\n“They’re doing the same thing we’re doing. We’re doing things to help us. We’re not doing things that key in on each team scheme-wise. We’re just trying to figure out what sets are best for us. We just have to continue to concentrate on us and not worry about the teams we’re playing.”", "external_links": ["http://media.jrn.com/images/Mike+Conley.png", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*132/Mike+Conley.png"], "published": "2015-10-12T18:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:01:06.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
