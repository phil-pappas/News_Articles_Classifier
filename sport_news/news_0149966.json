Higher Education Secretary Barbara Damron was scheduled to speak on the panel, and her counterpart, Chihuahua State Education Secretary Marcelo Gonzalez Tachiquin, was slated to discuss joint agreements.\n“We believe that we are just an ideal place for Mexican students to come,” said Dan Howard, NMSU executive vice president and provost, in a phone call from Chihuahua City. “Our natural partner is Mexico, and we need to do more to bring more of these students to New Mexico State.”\nNMSU President and former Gov. Garrey Carruthers has said he wants to increase the percentage of graduate students on campus to 20 percent of total enrollment from 14 percent currently, and he sees a fertile market in Mexico and China in particular. He canceled plans to travel to Chihuahua this week due to illness.\nThis fall, roughly 8 percent, or 1,288 of NMSU’s 15,490 students are international students. They come primarily from Kuwait, Mexico, India, Saudi Arabia and Brazil – in that order. Half are enrolled in graduate programs.\nNMSU already boasts the highest percentage of foreign students at a New Mexico public university, according to spokesman Justin Bannister. He said University of New Mexico has roughly the same number of foreign students, but with a fall enrollment of more than 27,000 students, the overall percentage is less.\nEnrollment on NMSU’s main campus has declined over the past five years, from a peak of 18,024 students in fall 2011. The enrollment peak came during the recession, as people lost jobs and sought degrees. As the economy has improved, the opposite has occurred and more people are heading to the job market instead of class.\nAt the same time, New Mexico’s population is not growing, and the state’s institutions of higher education are all jockeying for a static number of high school graduates, Carruthers has said.\nNMSU has been strengthening ties with Mexican institutions.\nNMSU struck an accord with the university Tecnológico Nacional de México earlier this summer, potentially opening slots for 300 engineering graduate students next year. Later this month, NMSU and the Autonomous University of Chihuahua will hold a two-day innovation and entrepreneurism event called CampusLink.\nIt may help that there are Aggies in Chihuahua state government: “There are several (Mexican) legislators who we have met who are Aggies,” Howard said.\nThe Chihuahua trip is all about “getting to know each other better, understanding capabilities and finding opportunities for partnership,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:18:48.348+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
