Bartolo Colon relieved, and Howie Kendrick hit a grounder up the middle. \nSecond baseman Daniel Murphy flipped to Tejada, who took the throw awkwardly for an apparent force as Utley slid past the bag and slammed into him, causing Tejada to flip over as the tying run scored from third. \nTejada was put on a flatbed vehicle after an air cast was placed on his leg. The Mets said Tejada suffered a fractured right fibula. Utley was ruled safe on a video review, which determined Tejada's foot missed the bag. Utley also appeared not to touch the base. \nAdrian Gonzalez followed with a two-run double off Addison Reed and scored on Justin Turner's double. \nThere was some history between Utley and Tejada. The Mets were angered over a takeout slide by Utley during a game against Philadelphia in September 2010. \n\"It was a little late,\" then-Mets manager Jerry Manuel said. \"You've got to be ready to respond. We'll take care of it. We'll slide hard, do stuff like that.\" Advertisement \nThe Dodgers' Zack Greinke (1-0), the major leagues' ERA leader, allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings. He struck out eight and walked none. \nYoenis Cespedes and Michael Conforto hit solo home runs off Greinke in the second inning. \nSyndergaard (0-1) gave up three runs and five hits in 6ï»¿1/3 innings. He struck out nine and walked four in following up Jacob deGrom's 13-strikeout performance in winning Game 1. Eight of Syndergaard's first 36 pitches reached 100 mph or more over the first two innings on an unseasonable 90-degree evening at Dodger Stadium. \nThe the best-of-five series shifts to Citi Field in New York for Game 3 Monday, with Brett Anderson of the Dodgers facing the Mets' Matt Harvey. Cubs 6, Cardinals 3: Kyle Hendricks and Addison Russell had successful squeeze bunts and Jorge Soler capped a five-run second with a two-run homer off Jaime Garcia, and Chicago evened its N.L. Division Series with St. Louis at a game apiece. \"Listen, I can't be more proud of our guys,\" manager Joe Maddon said. \"When you win a wild-card game like we did, I promise you, you settle in.\" \nCardinals starter Jaime Garcia wasn't feeling well but insisted he was OK to play despite having a stomach virus for three days. He then made a key error, leading to five unearned runs in the second inning. \n\"I was going to pitch, it was my game,\" Garcia said. \"I worked so hard all year for this situation and unfortunately it didn't go my way, but no excuse.\" \nNow the teams shift to Wrigley Field for Game 3 Monday. Jake Arrieta faces St. Louis' Michael Wacha in the best-of-five series. \n\"Getting back there 1-1 with our big dog on the mound, the atmosphere is going to be good,\" first baseman Anthony Rizzo said. \nThe usually steady N.L. Central champion Cardinals made two errors as the Cubs didn't hit the ball out of the infield in scoring their first three runs in the second. \n\"It is hard to watch a club that's played so well defensively, see a couple things happen that are kind of uncharacteristic for us,\" manager Mike Matheny said. \nLance Lynn, the presumptive Game 4 starter, replaced Garcia in the third as the first in a parade of relievers. Matheny said there are \"options\" for Game 4, with Lynn or lefty Tyler Lyons as possibilities. \nDexter Fowler, Soler and Starlin Castro each had two of Chicago's six hits in a game played in front of a lively crowd of 47,859, a postseason record at 10-year-old Busch Stadium, that included thousands of Cubs fans. \nSoler also doubled and walked twice in the Cubs' first postseason victory since 2003. Chicago had lost seven straight Division Series games. \nCubs closer Hector Rondon got stuck in the bullpen bathroom for several minutes during Game 1. Joe Walsh, St. Louis' director of stadium operations, said the lock froze and was replaced before Game 2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:04:38.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
