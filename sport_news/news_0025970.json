So far, so good. The Adrian College football team bounced back with a 50-14 win Saturday at home against Michigan Intercollegiate Athletic Association foe Alma to not only remain unbeaten in Adrian this season, but to also put itself back into the conference title race. “I’m happy with the way we responded,” Deere said. “We did a great job offensively and on special teams. Everything was working today on offense. I can’t say enough about my offensive staff. They did a great job, especially early, answering scores, and then we were able to get stops defensively.” The Bulldogs (3-2, 1-1 MIAA) shredded Alma’s defense on the ground, totaling 556 rushing yards. Adrian quarterback Stephen Milarch led the charge, totaling four touchdowns on the day (two rushing, two passing) to go along with 104 yards rushing and 86 yards passing. “We didn’t really change much tonight; we just played better football,” Milarch said. “Our 2-2 record just wasn’t good enough, and we came out with a little more fire.” While Milarch had a potent balanced attack under center, his right-hand man, explosive running back Emmanuel Stewart, had another impressive game, racking up 186 yards rushing with two long touchdowns from 66 and 48 yards out. David Nutter saw an increase in carries with D’Angelo Gaines sidelined with an injury, and the 5-foot-11, 231-pound back racked up 144 yards, including a 78-yard run. “We were able to run the football, and when you’re able to run the football, it opens up the passing game,” Deere said. Defensively, the Bulldogs struggled early, as Alma quarterback Dylan Zaborowski and wide receiver Sean McDonald found some seams and hurt Adrian with big plays. The two hooked up for two scores in the first half, but that was all they mustered, as Adrian picked up its defensive intensity and opened up the floodgates. “We played outstanding defensively in the second half,” said Deere. “I thought our D-line played well for the most of the game. I challenged our secondary at halftime. I told them I was embarrassed by the way we performed in the secondary in the first half. They took it to heart and came out in the second half and kept everything in front of us, and we put the game away.” While the secondary allowed 273 total passing yards to Alma (2-3, 0-2), the Adrian DBs were also able to steal momentum four times with interceptions. Cornerback Jarius Garner broke on the ball twice to pick off Zaborowski in the game, setting up the Bulldog offense with good field position. Page 2 of 2 - “We got a lot of pressure from Leslie Young and Damon Fuller, and that made it easy on the back end for us to get picks,” Garner said. Young added an interception in the game, as did free safety Mitch Osadchuk. Adrian forced Alma into a woeful 3-for-11 (27 percent) in third-down situations. Offensively, the Bulldogs were 6-for-13 on third down, but most importantly, converted in the red zone on five of its six attempts. A blocked field goal resulted in the only failed red zone drive for Adrian. Freshman wide receiver Darius Philon also saw some increased action in the contest, and the talented wide receiver from Winter Haven, Florida, made the most of his opportunity, making a 41-yard touchdown reception from Milarch. Mike Ford also got into the scoring action with an 11-yard TD reception with five seconds left in the first half to give Adrian some added separation on the scoreboard. Dontrell Tucker totaled 6 1/2 tackles to lead Adrian, while Young added six tackles and a sack. Though it’s early in the conference portion of the season, the Bulldogs moved into a tie for third place in the MIAA standings and will get an opportunity for a big win next weekend against undefeated Albion. “We’re just taking it game-by-game,” Milarch said. “Hopefully Olivet will lose one and give us a shot back in it, but we’re taking it week-by-week and just focusing on winning games.” By Brooks Sutherland The Daily Telegram - Adrian, MI By Brooks Sutherland", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:02:47.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
