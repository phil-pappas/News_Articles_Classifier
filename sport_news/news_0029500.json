Barrett back in the starting lineup at quarterback, remains the nation's No. 1 team after trouncing Rutgers 49-7 on Saturday night in Piscataway. After seeing some of their first-place votes get distributed elsewhere over the last several weeks, the Buckeyes' hold on No. 1 (49 of 62 first-place votes) has improved. \nUtah and Florida State, both unbeaten heading into the weekend, lost in different ways. The Utes, down seven spots to No. 14, struggled with turnovers and were overwhelmed early by USC while Florida State, well, if you haven't seen Georgia Tech's field goal block returned for a touchdown then you need to take a moment and check it out ( along with the spectacular radio call ) right now. The Seminoles dropped six spots to No. 15.\nTexas A&M and Cal both fell out of the top 25 following conference losses to Ole Miss and UCLA, respectively. The biggest moves up came from the Bruins and Pitt, both moving up four spots to break into the top 25.\nThe full Coaches Poll top 25: \n1. Ohio State (49) \n2. Baylor (10) \n3. TCU (2) \n4.
