The framing of draft rules (as stipulated under Section 112 of the 2013 Act) by the Department of Revenue will aid the government speed track work on big ticket projects such as the 290-km Rishikesh-Karnprayag railway line and power projects such as the Kishau Dam project that requires acquiring vast land. “The issue has been hanging fire for more than a year. Although the Act is in place, in the absence of draft rules its implementation has been affected. Further, once the draft rules get the go-ahead, the issue pertaining to the acquisition of land and payment of compensation will be clear. It will be easier for revenue officials to act at the ground level,” said Yashpal Arya, Uttarakhand Minister for Department of Revenue. Further, experts point out that with the exercise of drafting rules will also provide the government an opportunity to revisit the entire land acquisition in process. The state has been following the Public Land Acquire Act, in place since 1894. “The payment of compensation is not equal in most cases the land acquired in the areas near cities manage to get good remuneration price, while the land that may be far off may not fetch that much price. All these issues have to be worked out according to the Act,” said JP Joshi, Additional Secretary, Department of Revenue. Earlier, during the construction of Tehri Dam, a separate plan was brought for paying compensation to the beneficiaries and their numbers continued to rise and to this day, the compensation is awaited. However, the 2013 Land Acquisition Act mandates that the number of beneficiaries to whom compensation is paid is fixed and it is mandatory to pay the minimum amount being demanded. Once the draft rules are made, these would have to be passed by the Uttarakhand Legislative Assembly and then notified. Significantly as Uttarakhand is Congress- ruled state, like other Congress ruled states it had made it clear that it was opposed to changes in the 2013 Act which was passed by the UPA government.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:08:57.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
