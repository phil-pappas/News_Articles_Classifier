He will not. \n\"He could have won the race, so if you lose 25 points then it is difficult. \n\"He is very disappointed, but he is a racing driver and knows these things can happen, but he will keep on fighting. He fought here very well, he took pole position and led the race. He could have won the race and unfortunately the points are gone. \n\"So a racing driver never gives up, Nico especially. He will try in Austin again to do the same thing and hopefully finish in the lead.\" \nRosberg, who has now failed to finish two of the last four grands prix through no fault of his own, rued a season he claimed had been blighted by bad luck. \nBut Lauda added: \"There is generally speaking no good luck and bad luck from my point of view. Nevertheless, our reliability performance in the second half of the season went down. So we have to try and fix that.\" \nMercedes belatedly sealed consecutive team titles on Sunday after Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen was demoted to eighth by the stewards following his last-lap collision with Valtteri Bottas. \nBoth Hamilton and Rosberg will head to the team's HQ in Brackley on Monday to celebrate their constructors' championship. Lauda will be in Berlin on a prior commitment, but he recorded a video message ahead of Sunday's race which will be played out to the team's staff. \nOn Monday morning, Mercedes tweeted: \"Hand shakes, high fives and fist bumps all round right now. Brackley is absolutely buzzing this morning. What a feeling.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T16:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:00:45.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
