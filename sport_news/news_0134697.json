Some players claim they were tortured. \nFIFPro, which did not name Sheikh Salman, said candidates \"need to show a body of work based on social wellbeing, fairness, democratic values and human rights.\" \nThose who cannot \"should be eliminated from the process without further delay,\" FIFPro says. \nPresidential hopefuls must pass integrity checks overseen by FIFA's election committee before being accepted as candidates. \nThink your friends should see this?
