Kickoff is set for 8:00 p.m. inside Ohio Stadium. \nHere are ten things to know before the game: \n1) ‘Dark Night In The Shoe’ \nIt’s starting to become a theme that Ohio State plays the Nittany Lions under the lights, as this is the fourth consecutive year that they will play them in a night game. Ohio State is 47-23 all-time in night games, including their opening win of the season against Virginia Tech. \n2)New Look On Offense \nDuring last week’s game against Maryland, Ohio State used J.T. Barrett as their red zone quarterback. Barrett successfully lead the Buckeye offense to five red zone touchdowns, three of which he rushed for himself. \n3)No Red Zone, No Problem \nDespite not playing in the red zone Cardale Jones still threw for a career-high 291 yards while completing over 75 percent of his passes and two touchdowns. Jones will face off against another big time NFL quarterback prospect in Christian Hackenberg this weekend. No. 1 Ohio State Pulls Away From Maryland For Homecoming Win \n4)Fortifying The Defensive Front \nDefensive lineman Tyquan Lewis is now fifth in the Big Ten in both sacks (5.5) and TFL (9.0). 6.0 of his TFL have come in the last two games. \n5)Kings Of The Conference \nOhio State has won 26 consecutive games in Big Ten play and is already the first team since Minnesota in 1935, to go undefeated in the Big Ten for three straight seasons. The current FBS record is 29 consecutive wins in conference play. \n6)“Running” On All Cylinders \nOhio State’s offense is red-hot as they lead the big ten in rushing (230.0), total offense (460.0) and scoring (36.8). The offense is being led by prolific running back Ezekiel Elliot, who is second in the Big Ten in rushing with 139.2 YPG. If Elliot can rush for 25 yards this weekend, he will reach 3,000 for his career. \n7)Kicking His Way To The Top \nOhio State prides themselves on being good at flipping field position and punter Cameron Johnston makes this possible by leading the Big Ten with a 47.2 yard average. This mark is good enough for fifth in the FBS. \n8)Big Time Target \nMichael Thomas continued his streak of 22 consecutive games with a reception in his first ever 100-yard receiving performance last week against the Maryland Terrapins. \n9)Big Weekend For The Big Ten East \nA lot is up for grabs in the Big Ten East this weekend as Ohio State and Penn State are two of the four undefeated teams left in their half of the conference. Michigan and Michigan State are the other two and they face off this weekend as well. \n10)Streaking Is A Habbit \nWith a win over Penn State this weekend, Ohio State will have won 20 Straight games. This would be Urban Meyer’s fourth 20-game win streak giving him two more than any other coach in FBS history. Meyer has had a double-digit win streak at each of the four schools he has coached (Bowling Green, Utah, Florida, Ohio State). ©2015 by 10TV.com.
