(AP) - It's not often that a political event can bring together candidates like self-described democratic socialist Bernie Sanders and outspoken billionaire Donald Trump.\nBut the two will be among eight 2016 presidential candidates addressing a convention in Manchester on Monday put on by No Labels - a group that advocates for bipartisan problem solving. Other candidates planning to attend include former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb, both seeking the Democratic nomination, and Republicans Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, former New York Gov. George Pataki and Ohio Gov. John Kasich.\nA number of other elected officials, including Sen. Kelly Ayotte and Gov. Maggie Hassan, also plan to address the convention.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
