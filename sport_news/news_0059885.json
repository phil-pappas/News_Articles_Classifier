Nowak started the first five games of the season.\nHere’s the other injury news:\nCarroll said said starting left tackle Garry Gilliam (ankle) is also expected to play against the 49ers. Linebacker Bobby Wagner (pectoral), defensive lineman Frank Clark (hamstring) and cornerback Tye Smith (hip) are all expected back after missing last week’s game against the Panthers. Fullback Derrick Coleman (concussion) will not play, Carroll said. Coleman suffered the concussion in his two-car accident last week in Bellevue. Defensive tackle Jordan Hill (quad) and cornerback Marcus Burley (hand) will not play this week. Carroll said he expects Burley back next week while Hill is also getting closer. Cornerback Richard Sherman appeared on the injury report on Tuesday with ankle injury and was listed as a player who did not participate in practice, but Carroll said Sherman will play in San Francisco. Linebacker Brock Coyle had knee in his surgery this week, Carroll said. The Seahawks placed Coyle on the Injured Reserve list with the designated to return label. That means Coyle can return to practice in six weeks and return to games in eight weeks.  \n \n \nJayson Jenks : 206-464-8277 or jjenks@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @jaysonjenks .
