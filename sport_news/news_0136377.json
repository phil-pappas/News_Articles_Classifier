(AP) Ravenheart is the early 5-2 favorite in the $100,000 Maryland Million Nursery for owner and Olympic champion skier Bode Miller. \nThe six-furlong race for 2-year-olds is one of 11 on the Jim McKay Maryland Million card Saturday at Laurel Park. \nMiller purchased a barn at Fair Hill training center in northeast Maryland this year with the goal of becoming a trainer. \nRavenheart, who won his debut race at Delaware Park on Oct. 3, is trained by Francis ''Tres'' Albert II. The 2-year-old Maryland-bred was purchased for $27,000 at last year's Mid-Atlantic fall yearlings sale at Timonium. Carol Cedeno will be aboard. \nAlbert said Miller won't attend the race. The skier plans to skip this season's World Cup circuit to spend more time with his wife and recently born son.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:10:19.830+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
