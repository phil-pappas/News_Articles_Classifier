All it took was Ziggy Gordon's throw-in for the hosts to get beyond the Celtic defence as Kurtaj outmuscled and turned Boyata before firing into the far corner from 18 yards. \nRonny Deila had made three changes to his defence following Thursday's 2-2 draw with Fenerbahce and they continued to look uncomfortable early on. \nWith Efe Ambrose suspended and Charlie Mulgrew and Jozo Simunovic still injured, Tyler Blackett came in to partner Boyata with Saidy Janko in for the rested Mikael Lustig and Emilio Izaguirre back from a Europa League ban. Tom Rogic was also in for the injured Stefan Johansen in midfield. \nIzaguirre had a low drive pushed away by Michael McGovern soon after the opener but Hamilton were looking comfortable and Ali Crawford had a shot deflected wide before Gordon emerged unmarked at the back post following a corner, but could not turn his shot on goal. \nCeltic could not find their rhythm amid some incessant Hamilton pressing but they got their way back into the game from a set-piece after Lucas Tagliapietra chopped down Janko following some slack play from the hosts. \nGriffiths curled in the free-kick from the right and Boyata found space to cushion a volley into the top corner from six yards. \nCrawford's audacious free-kick had Craig Gordon scrambling but the ball drifted wide and Celtic were soon in front when Griffiths rose brilliantly to head Janko's deflected cross into the corner for his 12th goal of the season. \nHamilton fought hard to get back into it. The Celtic goalkeeper missed Imrie's free-kick but saw it flash wide and Grant Gillespie shot just wide from 25 yards. \nCeltic should have killed the game off on the break just before the hour mark but Nir Bitton missed the chance to release Griffiths and Kris Commons eventually shot wide. \nCrawford almost made them pay with a brilliant first-time effort towards the far top corner but Gordon made an excellent one-handed save and Carlton Morris missed the rebound. \nBut Celtic were comfortable during the final quarter and substitute Gary Mackay-Steven was inches from a third with an stoppage-time run and shot.
