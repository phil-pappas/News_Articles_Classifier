Whitehall hung around long enough and played well enough to indicate it's every bit as good as its record and could be a threat in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference and District 11 playoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:39:55.616+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
