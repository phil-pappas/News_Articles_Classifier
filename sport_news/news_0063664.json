That's no reason to start having nightmares about the curse of the billy goat.\nHave faith. The Cubs were clutch against the Pirates. They creamed the Cardinals. They've got the roster and the juice to beat the Mets. And now they're home for three games. (Be confident about that third game being necessary.)
