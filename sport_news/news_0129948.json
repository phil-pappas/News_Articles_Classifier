But getting down 0-2 against the Astros , and heading back to Minute Maid Park needing to sweep, would not be ideal. That's where Johnny Cueto comes in. The Royals hope. \nCueto, the NL Cy Young runner-up a year ago, was considered the ace the Royals were lacking when general manager Dayton Moore pulled the trigger in July on a three-for-one deal with the Reds . Cueto started out fine with KC, but he mostly struggled without knowing why , and posted a 4.76 ERA overall. \n\"That season is over,\" Cueto said in a press conference at Kauffman Stadium before Game 1. \"This is a new season. And you'll get to see what Johnny Cueto is all about.\" \nWell, what excellent timing -- with Kansas City's season in peril. Houston beat the Royals 5-2 on Thursday night to gain a 1-0 advantage in the ALDS. If Cueto isn't good in Game 2 and the Royals fall again, their second seascon could be over in one more game; Astros ace Dallas Keuchel is scheduled to pitch in Game 3 at Minute Maid Park. \nRoyals manager Ned Yost said he thinks Cueto, along with pitching coach Dave Eiland, have figured out whatever the deal was. \n\"There was a little concern that we couldn't figure it out,\" Yost said. \"It didn't worry us (too much), because we all knew we'd get it figured out by the time the playoffs started. And we did. I think Johnny's last four or five starts have been really, really good and we look forward to having him have another really good one tomorrow night.\" \nIn Cueto's final four regular-season starts, he closed with a 3.24 ERA in 25 innings, with a 15-9 strikeout-to-walk ratio and a .733 on-base plus slugging against. Not dominating, but not as troubling as before. He could be on the verge of a breakthrough. Of course, this is what happened to Johnny Cueto in his most recent postseason appearance: \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nThat won't happen -- the part about the crowd mockingly chanting his name, anyway -- because this a home game. Holding onto the ball is all up to Cueto, though. \nThe other starting pitcher in Game 2, left-hander Scott Kazmir , also has struggled since coming over in a trade with the Athletics for prospects. Kazmir's work in 13 starts -- posting a 4.17 ERA -- hasn't been what the Astros were looking for. Kind of like with Cueto. Kazmir acknowledges he hasn't been at his best, but he also doesn't think whatever his struggles, they're much to overcome. \n\"It really isn't,\" Kazmir said. \"Going through what I've gone through in the past however many years, it really doesn't feel like it's much at all. Just feels, like I said, like a little rough patch that happened at a bad time. It was something where I feel like one or two pitches throughout any one of those games could have been a different outcome. So my confidence was always there.\" \nKazmir has been strong against the Royals, and effective at Kauffman Stadium, in 2015. That won't hurt him mentally coming in. \nFor both Kazmir and Cueto, the second season respresents something of a second chance to make good on the promise both pitchers have for their second teams in 2015. \nBig start for both of these guys (USATSI)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:25:10.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
