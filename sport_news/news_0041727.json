He completed 16-of-18 passes for 243 yards and rushed 14 times for 82 yards and four touchdowns.\nScoring on two 10-yard runs and two 2-yard runs, Ward set the school record for rushing touchdowns by a quarterback in one season with10. He broke the mark of nine set by Case Keenum in 2007.\nFor SMU, this story has become painfully familiar. The Mustangs took a 23-7 lead over East Carolina but were then outscored 42-0 in a 49-23 loss last week.\nThe promise SMU's young team showed in losses to top-five teams Baylor and TCU has deteriorated into a 1-5 record. The Mustangs dropped to 0-2 in American Athletic Conference play. Houston improved to 5-0 2-0.\n\"We're looking for something to go wrong,\" SMU coach Chad Morris said. \"We've got to find a way to play four quarters.\n\"I can tell you this: We're not going to quit. We're not going to give in. We're not changing who we are. It's a process. I'll promise you, I'm going to get it turned around.\"\nHouston's seven rushing touchdowns were the team's most since running for seven against Texas Southern on Nov. 24, 2007.\nThe Mustangs, who stuck close statistically, were outgained 457 yards to 399. And SMU quarterback Matt Davis was close to matching Ward, throwing for 248 yards and three touchdowns and rushing for 46 yards and a touchdown.\nSMU also got some big plays from its defense, including season-highs of three sacks and five tackles for a loss.\nBut that was not enough to overcome the mistakes. SMU's turnovers made the difference.\nThe Mustangs looked ready to post the upset early. They took the opening drive 82 yards in 10 plays, scoring on Davis' 8-yard pass to Courtland Sutton.\nJustin Lawler's first of two sacks forced UH to punt, then SMU drove 70 yards to score on Davis' 1-yard run. They led 21-14 with 6:16 left in the first half and had the chance to take control after Jarvis Pruitt's sack forced Houston to punt from its 12.\nBut instead of getting good field position, the Mustangs started the drive at their 22 after getting flagged for unnecessary roughness on the return. Then came a false start on first down and Davis' fumble after getting sacked for a 9-yard loss.\nThat turnover, which gave Houston the ball on SMU's 12, dramatically changed the score and momentum.\nKenneth Farrow's 6-yard touchdown tied the score at 21 with 2:18 left in the second quarter. The Mustangs were in free-fall mode. Davis' 15-yard pass to Sutton put the Ponies on UH's 41, but freshman Braeden West fumbled.\nHouston drove 42 yards. With no timeouts left, Ward quickly got the play off and streaked around left end for a 1-yard touchdown with two seconds left in the first half. The Cougars' 14 points in the final 2:18 turned SMU's seven-point lead to a seven-point deficit.\n\"We're playing freshmen who are making freshmen mistakes,\" Morris said. \"I really am proud of our freshmen, but there's a certain time in a game where either they need to make a play or we need to make a play and we aren't making the play.\"\nLawler posted his second sack of the night on the first drive of the second half. Ward's fumble on the 5-yard loss was recovered by Andrew McCleneghen at the UH 42.\nBut three plays later, the Mustangs punted and the Cougars promptly scored on Ward's 10-yard run. That put the Cougars in control, leading 35-21 with 9:06 left in the third.\nTwitter: @BillNicholsDMN\nHouston 49, SMU 28: Complete coverage\nÂ\nClick here to visit the Mustangs page\nNichols: Mistakes plague SMU in 49-28 loss to UH; Cougars rush for 7 TDs\nSMU quick hits: Mustangs' offense improves on third down; WR's homecoming a success\nNational reaction: Lack of defense in SMU-Houston game was 'laughable'\nPhotos: Mistakes doom SMU in 49-28 loss to UH\nFive thoughts from the SMU Mustang's 49-28 loss to the Houston Cougars\nÂ\nOn Twitter:\n @BillNicholsDMN", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/08/five-thoughts-smus-49-28-loss-houston", "https://twitter.com/BillNicholsDMN", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/10/09/photos-mistakes-doom-smu-49-28-loss-uh", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/smu-mustangs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/08/smu-quick-hits-mustangs-offense-improves-third-wrs-homecoming-success", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/08/nichols-mistakes-plague-smu-49-28-loss-uh-cougars-rush-7-tds", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/08/national-reaction-lack-defense-smu-houston-game-laughable"], "published": "2015-10-09T07:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:16:51.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
