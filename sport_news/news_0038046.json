A birdie at the last sealed it, as Hepburn fired an even-par 71 to capture the individual title by two shots on a windswept Tuesday in Ithaca.

As soon as I made that eagle, I got really excited and I knew that I had a shot.\" \nFinishing in second was the trio of Tommy Davis, of Seton Catholic Central; Ryan Johnson, of Norwich; and D.J. Griffiths, of Susquehanna Valley. \nVestal's Nick Barney placed fifth at 4-over 75 and led the Golden Bears to their third team title in the past six seasons, with a five-man score of 393. Last week, Vestal captured the Section 4 Class A championship at Soaring Eagles Golf Course in Horseheads, with a record score of 376. \n\"One of my parents last week said, 'Get the broom, we're going to have a sweep,'\" Vestal coach Tony Policare said, referring to his team's capturing the three major fall golf events, including the season-opening DiNunzio Invitational in August. \n\"It's been elusive; we've won one or two of them but never swept,\" Policare said. \"It was really a lot of fun, and I'm excited for our guys as a team to come through and win all three of the major tournaments.\" \nBarney played with Griffiths and Davis, and saw his chances at the individual title take a hit when he made the turn in 4-over. But he played the back nine in even par, despite three-putts at holes 14 and 15, and kept grinding until the end. \n\"I knew I still had to keep going for the team score,\" he said. \"The other guys played really well and we got it done.\" \nHepburn bogeyed Cornell's third hole — normally a par-4 but playing as a par-3 Tuesday because of ongoing reconstruction of the fairway — but got the stroke back with a birdie at No. 4. He then got to 1-under at the par-5 sixth hole, but gave it back when he was unable to get up and down for par at the ninth. \nAfter continuing his ride on the bogey train to start the back nine, he drained a 4-footer for eagle on 13, then capped his even-par round by sinking an 8-footer for birdie on 18. Hepburn was unsure of exactly how he stood in relation to the field, and could only focus on his game. \n\"I knew the group in front of me was pretty close,\" he said, referring to Davis, Griffiths and Barney, \"and that I needed to stay at around 1-over or even par if I wanted to win, and I did that.\" \nOther scorers for team champion Vestal included Jared Reester (76), Luke Barney (78), Zach Keesler (81) and Colin Sabitus (83). \n\"I'm just proud of our kids, and this was an outstanding field,\" said Policare, whose squad also won STAC titles in 2010 and '12. \"Some great, well-coached teams, great golfers, and these scores indicate objectively the quality of golf here. To have three (Vestal) kids shoot in the 70s today, that's great.\" \nLed by Hepburn, Corning finished second in the team race with a team total of 412, three shots better than third-place Seton. Horseheads was fourth (422), followed by Susquehanna Valley (434) and Chenango Forks (436). \nHost Ithaca had four players entered in the tournament, and was led by junior Nick Miller's 10-over-par 81.
