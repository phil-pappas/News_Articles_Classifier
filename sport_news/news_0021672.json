ARMAS   \nMILWAUKEE (AP) - Greg Monroe could be a difference-maker this season for the Milwaukee Bucks. \nJabari Parker could, too. \nBut in the 6-foot-11 Monroe, the Bucks have a big man who fits into the dynamic of an up-and-coming team. He is the kind of prized free-agent signee that the franchise had trouble getting in the past. \n“We don’t want to be in a position where we’re surprised when things like this happen,” general manager John Hammond said. “Look, I can say it because I’ve lived it - there’s a new day in Milwaukee Bucks basketball.” \nThe rebuilding project is ahead of schedule in Jason Kidd’s second year as head coach. Milwaukee won 41 games and made a surprise run to the playoffs, losing in six games in the first round to the Chicago Bulls. \nThe Bucks let veteran center Zaza Pachulia go in the offseason. Forward Ersan Ilyasova, a seven-year veteran with Milwaukee, was traded to the Detroit Pistons. \nThe 25-year-old Monroe signed a three-year, $50 million deal, which includes a player option in the final year. He joins a young starting lineup that already includes Giannis Antetokounmpo at small forward, and the emerging backcourt of shooting guard Khris Middleton and point guard Michael Carter-Williams. \nThat other starting spot should eventually go to Parker, though the Bucks are being cautious about pushing their star forward after he tore his left ACL in December. \nThey can afford that luxury with a young and deep roster that added Monroe to the mix. \n“He’s a very good low-post player that you can play through down there because not only can he score, but he can really pass the ball,” said the Pistons’ Stan Van Gundy, Monroe’s former coach. \n“They got a great big guy to add to what’s a really solid young perimeter core. Things look like they are on the way up here.” \nHere are some other things to watch with the Bucks: \nROOM TO GROW: The 6-foot-11 Antetokounmpo, a native of Greece, has gotten better since his rookie year two seasons ago - and there’s still room for improvement. \nAntetokounmpo is a matchup problem since he plays like an athletic small forward, but can handle the ball like a guard. The Bucks have him working out more in camp at power forward, too, where he might be able to use his quickness against tall but slower players. \n“There’s stuff he has to learn at the four because he’s a guard,” forward John Henson said. “He’s learning.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:06:14.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
