By JAMES NOKES editorial@kcchronicle.com \nDropped calls don’t happen to Canaan Coffey on game days. \nIt’s not that the Batavia receiver doesn’t occasionally experience the annoying cellphone snafu, but rather the avoidance by the Bulldogs’ receiving corps of the word “drop.” Batavia wide receivers coach Bai Kabba banned any variation of the four-letter word. \nCompleted passes are a big part of the Bulldogs’ offense; and Kabba, a former Batavia multisport standout, wants to eliminate any potential negative thoughts. \n“The word ‘drop’ doesn’t exist on game day,” Coffey said. “We received 10 different note cards before the season started, and every week we focus on one of them. It’s something that has motivated us to play hard.” \nAs part of football’s continued offensive evolution, where spread sets focus on an aerial attack, the importance of solid play from receivers has grown. Summer camps, private lessons with specialized position coaches and voluntary group practices in spring and summer aim to increase receivers’ skill sets. \nOn a summer weekend, the Bulldogs quarterbacks and receivers will meet to run routes. Without the pressure of defenders, they are building a rapport. Wide receivers can familiarize themselves with the velocity of a pass, the spin on the football and a quarterback’s release point. \nBecause the delivery of the football needs precise timing, a quarterback can track how long each wide receiver takes to finish a route, how quickly they get into their break – the moment a receiver changes direction – and the location of their preferred catching zone. \n“Our summer training allows us to hit big explosion plays,” Coffey said. “The timing is key. You’ve got to develop a trust between wide receiver and quarterback to have an effective passing game. Receivers have to know where the sticks are. Certain routes go certain distances. One step too short on the route or one step too short by the quarterback in the pocket and it throws things off. Our quarterback knows our speeds and how long it takes each receiver to get to their route.” \nWhile quarterbacks and wide receivers need hours, days or months to get on the same page, St. Charles North has an interesting duo that has easily developed a feel for their tendencies. Quarterback Zach Mettetal and wide receiver Tyler Mettetal are twins. \nTheir bond runs so deep that Tyler joked he felt a sudden twinge when Zach took a big hit downfield, even though he didn’t see it fully. Other teams need an offseason to establish a connection the Mettetals have had their entire lives. \n“Since we were 12 years old, Zach has always told me if the ball isn’t there at the end of the route, come back to the ball,” Tyler Mettetal said. “Our offseason is route running, footwork and catching passes.” \nThe act of catching a pass becomes easier if a wide receiver can manipulate the defensive back in front of them. St. Francis coach Mike Fitzgerald has noticed more defenses have turned to press coverage where a defensive back lines up directly in front of a wide receiver and attempts to “jam” them – that is, push them off their intended route at the line of scrimmage. \nIf the timing between quarterback and wide receiver breaks down, the defensive line or anyone applying pressure has an extra second to make a sack or force a rushed throw. Coffey and Tyler Mettetal agreed that a good route gets the defensive back to turn his hips opposite the cut that is being made. \nA wide receiver also has a distinct advantage over the defensive back: the element of surprise. \n“We know the route being run; the defensive back doesn’t,” Coffey said. “I want to be explosive on all cuts, they should also be crisp. This year I look at the defensive back so I don’t tip the route I’m in by looking at the location I’m running to.” \nAt St. Francis, Fitzgerald preps the wide receivers like quarterbacks. The examination of defensive formations and player positioning dictates the route. If the Spartans’ wide receivers can read a defense like a quarterback, perhaps players at two very different skill positions can start to think alike. \n“The wide receiver position is big for us,” Fitzgerald said. “We want the defense to defend the entire field.” \nSuccess has bred many variation and copy cats of the spread offense, which also has been a staple at Kaneland for years. Fitzgerald theorized it’s easier to get players to buy into an up=tempo spread offense where seven to eight players get touches. It’s also an offense Fitzgerald said is the “great equalizer” because it doesn’t require massive linemen to push defenders out of the way. \nBut, it does require wide receivers to further their blocking skills. \n“Our perimeter screen passing game is essential so we can get our screen game going,” Fitzgerald said. “We take pride in having receivers that block well. While our game plan takes into account what the defense does, we tell our receivers if they want more passes thrown, they’ve got to make sure blocks are being thrown. That’s a good motivator to block well.” \nEven as he’s developed new skills, it’s old advice Tyler Mettetal turns to upon an incomplete pass. \n“If I drop a ball, the first though that goes through my mind is do 10 push ups,” Mettetal said. “Someone told me that back when I started playing football in second grade and it has stuck with me. I was quarterback for one year in second grade. I decided I wanted to catch the ball and run with it, that was more fun.” \nMetettal had good foresight. Modern offenses should allow him to have plenty of fun.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:20:51.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
