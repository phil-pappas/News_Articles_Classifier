Tighthead prop Hiroshi Yamashita replaces the more experienced Kensuke Hatakeyama, who drops to the reserves, and Justin Ives is at lock for Hitoshi Ono, who became Japan’s oldest ever international at 37 against Samoa. \nJapan has yet to field third-choice hooker Hiroki Yuhara and winger Toshiaki Hirose, while captain Michael Leitch and fullback Ayumu Goromaru are the only two Japan players to have played all 240 minutes so far. \nThe US made 13 changes following their 64-0 loss to South Africa. \nThe team resembles that which lost to Scotland 39-16 nearly two weeks ago, after leading 13-6 at halftime. \nUnited States: Chris Wyles (captain), Takudzwa Ngwenya, Seamus Kelly, Thretton Palamo, Zach Test, AJ MacGinty, Mike Petri; Samu Manoa, Andrew Durutalo, Al McFarland, Greg Peterson, Hayden Smith, Titi Lamositele, Zach Fenoglio, Eric Fry. Reserves: Phil Thiel, Oli Kilifi, Chris Baumann, Cam Dolan, John Quill, Danny Barrett, Niku Kruger, Folau Niua. \nJapan: Ayumu Goromaru, Yoshikazu Fujita, Harumichi Tatekawa, Craig Wing, Kotaro Matsushima, Kosei Ono, Fumiaki Tanaka; Ryu Koliniasi Holani, Michael Broadhurst, Michael Leitch (captain), Justin Ives, Luke Thompson, Hiroshi Yamashita, Shota Horie, Keita Inagaki.
