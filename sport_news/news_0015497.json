But he did skate on his own in the practice rink and showed up too late to join practice. \n\"I had to go get the X-rays. By the time I got back it was too late,\" Moore said. \nThe news was good. \n\"His X-rays were negative,\" coach John Hynes reported. \"He skated a little but today and we're going to see how he feels tomorrow. I'm not sure if he'll be in or not. It'll definitely be a decision for tomorrow.\"He actually blocked two big shots for us. I'm glad to see he's feeling better today.\" \nRELATED: Devils' practice lines and defense \nMoore said he wasn't worried about a serious injury. \n\"I wasn't worried. It stung, but that's part of the territory, I guess,\" he said. \"I feel great. It was one of those things I just think it kind of hit a tough area and locked up on me. It feels good now. Just a bone bruise.\" \nCould he have practiced with the team?\"I think so, yeah,\" he said. \nAs for playing Tuesdsay night against the Nashville Predators, Moore was hopeful. \n\"I'm going to show up and go through a game day like I normally would and if anything comes up I'll deal with it. I am fully expecting to (play),\" the defenseman said. \nThere was also positive news regarding Patrik Elias. The veteran forward has been skating on his own. He hasn't been on the ice with the team at all yet, including training camp, because of a right knee issue. \n\"Light skating,\" Hynes stressed. \"Not to put the cart before the horse. It's just to see how he feels with that first. He's making some progress. His activity level has recently just picked up.\" \n* * * \nGoalie Cory Schneider did not practice. His status for Tuesday night is undetermined. \n\"He's got a family situation,\" Hynes said. \"We'll talk to him a little later and see where he's at. He'll be back tomorrow. We'll probably make a decision either later today or tomorrow.\" \nThe Schneiders are expecting the birth of a child. \nRich Chere may be reached at rchere@njadvancemedia.com .
