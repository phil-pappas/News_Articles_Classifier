The speed and footwork of the MSU midfield, led by McKerchie, senior Sarah Kovan, and freshman Michaela Kovacs, thwarted the passing lanes of the Illini. \nMichigan State head coach Tom Saxton credited McKerchie, whose presence on the field played a noticeable impact, for opening up the offense. \n“The midfield is doing a much better job of when we gain possession, getting us out of pressure and opening up the game,” Saxton said. “I will single out Morgan McKerchie as she has found her form. It took her awhile, but it’s helped us a lot because she’s calm and technical.” \nSaxton noted the presence Kovan and Kovacs at the midfield position as well. \nComing into the second half, play continued to intensify as both teams battled to put a point on the scoreboard, with the Spartans showing a slight upper-hand in ball possession in the final minutes. \nIn the final seconds of the game, Jannelle Flaws fired a shot towards the Spartan net only to be blocked. Teammate Nicole Breece followed up with her own shot on goal that was saved by MSU senior goalkeeper Gabrielle Gauruder. In a flurry around the box, players collided as many thought time had expired. \nAfter deliberating with one another, the referees determined that there was a foul in the box. Flaws buried the penalty kick in the back right corner of the net to send the game into overtime. \n“I think we defended and outplayed [Illinois] 80 percent of the game,” Gjonaj said. “We shut down Janelle Flaws, and they had very good players on their side. I think we played very well together coming back from [the final call].” \nGauruder would deny the Illini for the remaining 20 minutes, finishing out the shutout with seven saves. The Spartans had several chances at gaining the advantage, battling the full 110 minutes for the fifth game to be sent into overtime this season. \nSaxton said that despite the wildness of the outcome, he was glad of the composure the Spartans maintained. \n“I thought the team had a great performance,” Saxton said. “Illinois is a good team, but I thought it was a pretty even game. I told my team after the game that [the final seconds of the second half] was one of the craziest things I’ve seen in my 25 years of coaching, and yet the way they caught their breath and responded in overtime was fantastic.” \nLooking to defend DeMartin once more, the Spartans will host Northwestern at 1 p.m. Sunday. \n- MSU Athletic Communications Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1Rx173Q TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:34:15.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
