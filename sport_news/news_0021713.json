Saints goalkeeper Kelvin Davis, making a rare appearance following Maarten Stekelenburg's withdrawal with a back injury suffered in training on Friday afternoon, caused uncertainty by unconvincingly responding to two routine crosses and his defence appeared unsettled as a consequence.In a sign of what looked likely to follow, Van Dijk, meeting James Ward-Prowse's 11th-minute left-wing corner, headed beyond Leicester goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel before seeing his goalbound effort cleared off the line by Danny Drinkwater.Ten minutes later it was captain Jose Fonte's header from Dusan Tadic's corner, but this time there was no one to rescue Schmeichel when the Dane had been beaten. Fonte was unchallenged as he neatly headed beyond Schmeichel and inside the left post.Not until the 36th minute, when Sadio Mane turned and sent a curling shot goalwards from the edge of the area to force a fine save from Schmeichel, did another goal look likely.From the resultant corner, Ward-Prowse crossed towards Graziano Pelle, whose header struck the post before falling to Van Dijk. Knowing little about it, the ball hit the defender and then the same post, but when the rebound again came back to him he was alert and responded by scoring with as easy a tap-in as he could expect.Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri responded at half-time by introducing his two most energetic substitutes, Nathan Dyer and Riyad Mahrez.Had Mane scored from distance after rounding the onrushing Schmeichel on the counter seven minutes into the second period, victory would have been secured. However, his heavy touch conceded possession and allowed Leicester to clear, and they regrouped, before gradually responding.In the 66th minute, Dyer crossed for Vardy, under little pressure, to head almost casually beyond Davis. The goalkeeper's reactions were far too slow.Leicester grew in confidence as the hosts, defending increasingly deeper, lost theirs. Their attacks became aimless, and their defending nervous.Vardy, who had previously acknowledged the need to remain prolific if he wants to make England's squad for Euro 2016, wasted what looked likely to be his finest chance to equalise when from close range he sent Mahrez's left-wing cross over. However, when tension grew at the announcement of five minutes' added time, Leicester continued to attack - and when Mahrez sent a through-ball towards Vardy, he atoned for his earlier miss by shooting into the top-right corner.
