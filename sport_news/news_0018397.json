On the other hand, the Cubs will face the New York Mets, which features three-time All-Star Curtis Granderson, who is also a Fifty/50 investor. Granderson's Mets and New York Yankees jerseys currently hang on the wall at Fifty/50.\nThe NLCS begins Saturday in New York with the winner of the best of seven series moving on to the World Series.\n“I’m a White Sox fan but am rooting for the Cubs,” said Fifty/50 Restaurant Group operating partner Eddie Mahoney, who has been friends with Granderson since they attended Thornton Fractional South High School together. “It’s good for baseball and the economy in Chicago and the overall vibe of the city. At the same time, it would be really great to see him win the World Series. I hope he goes five-for-five with five home runs and the Cubs win each game 6-5.”\nGranderson is an investor in most of The Fifty/50 Restaurant Group's venues, including Roots Handmade Pizza and West Town Bakery and Diner. He has been very supportive of the venues, going so far as to bring Derek Jeter and CC Sabathia to Roots on multiple occasions when they were Yankees teammates.\n(Ricketts brought Cubs president Theo Epstein to Fifty/50 shortly after he was acquired from the Boston Red Sox.)\nMahoney isn’t sure if Granderson will stop by Fifty/50 next week while in town for the NLCS. He said Granderson normally dines in but may opt for delivery this time around, based only on the fact that he liked to lay low when he traveled with the Yankees to face the rival Red Sox to avoid any hostility.\nCurtis Granderson Phil Velasquez/ Chicago Tribune Curtis Granderson tries his hand at making and tossing pizza dough Jan. 4 2012 at Roots Handmade Pizza, where he is an investor.\nCurtis Granderson tries his hand at making and tossing pizza dough Jan. 4 2012 at Roots Handmade Pizza, where he is an investor.\n(Phil Velasquez/ Chicago Tribune) Granderson’s presence will be felt at Fifty/50 either way. Fifty/50 will pay tribute to Granderson by bringing back his “Grandy Triple Stack Burger” during the series. Fifty/50 will also sell the Kyle Schwarber-inspired “Schwarber Bomb” alcoholic drink, which includes Red Bull and a bomb of your choice.\n“We’re representing both sides without being partial to the Mets,” Mahoney said. “We’re moreso partial to Curtis than the Mets. We want to show support to a guy who has supported us.”\nCurse cuisine: Ceres’ Table executive chef Craig Degel has created a Cubs-inspired “Curse of the Goat” pizza that is available at the Lakeview Italian restaurant for a limited time. The pizza features house-made goat sausage, aged goat cheese, kale and caramelized onions.\nOn the record: “The games aren't a communal event for me. I'm not going to have a big playoff party or a BBQ. I'll just order some food and maybe get a nice bourbon, a six pack and enjoy the games myself. ... I don't want to have to explain things to people or have them talking over me. I'm no teacher. If my kids want to learn something, that's super cool. If it's some adults? Get the (expletive) outta here. I'm no Steve Stone.” – “New Girl” star and Cubs fan Jake Johnson in an interview with rollingstone.com\n\"Curse of the Goat\" pizza from Ceres' Table Photo courtesy of Ceres' Table \"Curse of the Goat\" pizza from Ceres' Table in Lakeview.\n\"Curse of the Goat\" pizza from Ceres' Table in Lakeview.\n(Photo courtesy of Ceres' Table) “Don't worry New York, I'll be bringing proper pizza with me.

You can get the look as well when the barber behind the haircut visits Acme Hotel Company to give out Cubs-inspired haircuts Tuesday and Wednesday. Appointments with Miguel Rosas from New Style Barbershop in Moline are first come, first serve.\nBy the numbers: $1.45 million .
