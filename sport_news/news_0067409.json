Making matters worse, 33-year-old pillar Dwyane Wade suffered a hamstring injury that will interrupt his resurgent season indefinitely.

Image 30 of 30 Bosh provides insight on Aldridge’s transition 1 / 30 Back to Gallery Few, if any, players in the NBA are more qualified to discuss LaMarcus Alridge's move to the Spurs than Chris Bosh, who gave up sole possession of the spotlight in Toronto to team up with LeBron James and Dwyane Wade in Miami.\nOf course, their situations aren't completely identical. Bosh was clearly going to be third in that pecking order, while Aldridge, who signed the largest free agent deal in Spurs history after spending his first nine seasons in Portland, should remain the offensive focal point in San Antonio with Tony Parker and Tim Duncan both past their prime.\nRELATED: Spurs drop preseason opener as Aldridge struggles\nBut though he won't have to transform his game as substantively as Bosh, who became primarily a floor-spacing shooter with the Heat after doing pretty much whatever he wanted in Toronto, Aldridge will almost certainly have to sacrifice shots on a Spurs team brimming with depth.\nAnd that, Bosh told the media in advance of tonight's preseason game in Miami, could be easier said than done.\n\"The transition is the hardest part. He was getting a high volume amount of touches. Frankly, it's a lot easier to be a team guy then. But now you have to play within the offense and then people are telling you to be aggressive and you don't know how to do that. It's going to be a continuous thing. And usually when you figure it out, the season's over.\n\"At least that's how it was for me. I'm sure in that organization, they're going to try to fast-track him along. But when you're playing with all that talent, with all those expectations, you got people chirping at you what you should be doing and you know what you need to be doing within the organization, it's tough.\n\"I'm sure it's going to be frustrating at times for him, because he's used to getting the ball down on that left block. And he might get it on the right block. Or he might not get as many post touches or as many pick-and-pop looks. So, if it's limited, he's looking to move it, instead of shooting as usual.\n\"But they're saying, 'You've got to be aggressive.' So it's a fine balance, and you have to learn it.\"\nThe learning curve was plain to see as Aldridge shot 3 for 10 in last week's preseason opener against Sacramento. He'll take another step in the process tonight with his first game alongside Tim Duncan, who is slate to play after skipping the aforementioned Kings game.\nRELATED: Pop: Spurs know what to expect from Aldridge\nEven with the need for acclimation, Heat coach Erik Spoelstra thinks the pairing will \"absolutely work\" once they get used to each other.\n\"It's a great fit,\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \"(Aldridge) is such a skilled, savvy basketball player. You play him inside, outside; they're both similar in that regard. And now you have two guys that now when you're talking about a league that's playing with so much spacing around the 3-point arc, now you have two 7-footers that will absolutely punish you if you have mismatched lineups. So that's certainly unique.\"\ndmccarney@express-news.net\nTwitter: @danmccarneySAEN", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/30/41/05/6427001/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/32/17/15/6878065/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/32/61/46/7018929/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/47/70/8289822/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/72/8707714/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/63/8727780/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/32/24/53/6900463/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/21/02/11/4465238/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/27/74/8748830/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/30/50/47/6457840/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/17/8758265/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/30/50/47/6457804/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/27/47/8747457/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/21/02/11/4465238/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/44/63/8277220/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/32/24/53/6900463/3/920x920.jpg", "http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/miami-heat/sfl-miami-heat-lamarcus-aldridge-s101215-story.html", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/20/8762411/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/30/50/47/6457821/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/27/47/8747457/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/32/63/47/7027154/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/47/70/8289822/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/74/8707844/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/32/17/8758265/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752822/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/37/44/63/8277220/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/30/50/47/6457821/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/30/43/05/6435140/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/33/52/72/7253676/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752821/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/74/8707843/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/52/8706704/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/13/63/8436938/25/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/30/41/05/6427001/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/74/8707844/11/920x920.jpg", "https://twitter.com/danmccarneySAEN?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/52/8706704/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/40/46/7473562/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/33/52/72/7253676/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/73/8707839/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/13/63/8436938/25/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/30/43/05/6435140/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/30/50/47/6457804/21/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/32/17/15/6878065/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/34/40/46/7473562/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/32/63/47/7027154/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752821/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/74/8707843/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/34/40/46/7473559/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/73/8707839/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/30/50/47/6457840/21/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/33/20/8762411/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/47/70/8289815/37/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/37/47/70/8289815/37/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/30/72/8752822/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/15/72/8707714/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/63/8727780/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/34/40/46/7473559/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/27/74/8748830/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/32/61/46/7018929/11/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T23:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:49:55.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
