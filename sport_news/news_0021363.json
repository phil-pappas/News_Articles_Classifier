Eli Manning hadn't just led the Giants to a dramatic fourth-quarter comeback on Sunday night against the San Francisco 49ers. He essentially did it, given the personnel on the field when the winning drive started, blindfolded and with one hand tied behind his back. \nHe didn't have Victor Cruz, who hasn't played a down this season. He didn't have Rueben Randle, who left the game with a hamstring injury. And, until he begged his way onto the field after suffering his own hamstring tug , he didn't have Odell Beckham Jr. until 45 seconds were on the clock. \nHe was still able to complete an 82-yard drive with a perfect 12-yard throw and catch to tight end Larry Donnell for the touchdown in a 30-27 victory , which made this one feel different than his other 27 fourth-quarter comebacks. Not just different, but better. \nAnd here came the question: Is this as satisfying a comeback as you can remember? \nManning smiled. \n\"Well, there were a couple in the Super Bowl, obviously,\" and the press conference room erupted in laughter. \nRiiiight. The Super Bowl . The heavily favored Patriots. Two ridiculous catches, two MVP awards and two ticker tape parades through lower Manhattan. Yes, they do ring a bell. \nIt was easy to get a little carried away before remembering that this was a Week 5 win against a bad San Francisco team. Still, given what Manning was up against from a personnel standpoint — and given his ridiculous statistics from the game — it's hard to remember many better regular-season comebacks than this one. \nHe seemed to acknowledge as much when it was over. \nRELATED: Odell Beckham Jr. should save his best moves for the field \n\"This one was special just because we hadn't been as good in the two-minute drives as we once were,\" Manning said, pointing to losses to Dallas and Atlanta to start the season. \"I've got the confidence we could do it but sometimes you need that reinforcement, you need to do it, you need to have that success and get that attitude, get that feeling. It's big for this team. It was a big win today. It was special.\" \nSpecial indeed. Manning completed 41 of 54 passes for 441 yards with three touchdowns and one interception, and while there were a couple throws he'd like to have back — including an INT that was overturned by replay before the winning touchdown — this was the Giants quarterback at his best. \nHe had to be. The depleted Giants defense allowed the 30th best offense in the lead to march down the field and take the lead in the fourth quarter, but the 49ers left gave Manning the ball back with 1:45 on the clock and all three time outs in his pocket. \nThe Giants started the drive from the 18 when Manning scrambled for 11 yards and took a big hit when he thought, incorrectly, he could get out of bounds to stop the clock. Then came a couple of quick strikes to running back Shane Vereen, for 11 and 16 yards, to get the Giants to the San Francisco 44. \nWATCH: Larry Donnell makes an incredible game-winning TD catch \nThat's where he caught two big breaks. First, a dangerous pass under pressure landed in the hands of 49ers cornerback Tramaine Brock, but a replay review quickly and correctly overturned the interception. \nAnd then, after lobbying the trainers for much of the fourth quarter, Beckham returned to the field. Manning found Vereen again for 24 yards on a third and 10 to move the ball to San Fran 20, and on the next play, he targeted his star receiver and picked up a pass interference call. \n\"It's no touchdown but it is still a huge play getting that penalty,\" Manning said, \"and getting us close to take some legitimate shots at the end zone.\" \nFor the record, it was just one play to the end zone. Manning found Donnell at the back of the end zone , and his demonstrative, fist-pumping celebration coming off the field said it all. \nAnd, about a half hour later, one of his teammates said a little more ... \n\"It's amazing man,\" cornerback Prince Amukamara said. \"It just shows that Eli can work with anybody. He played amazing. I never lose doubt in Eli whether he throws 20 picks on year or whether he throws 30 touchdowns one year. All my trust is in Eli and that is the Eli ... this type of game is the type of game that Eli can do week in and week out and I'm sure everyone loves this Eli when he plays like this.\" \nThe Giants certainly have every right to feel that way this morning. They're in sole possession of first place in the NFC East because of this victory, which has to rank as the best comeback in a career filled with them for Manning.* \n* The two Super Bowls not withstanding. \nSteve Politi may be reached at spoliti@njadvancemedia.com .
