I imagined feeling satisfied and smug in the fact that I knew all along. I envisioned a gloating Twitter rant delighting in Manning’s unmasking. \nInstead, I feel an unprecedented deep well of respect building inside of me for what Manning accomplished in his prime and for the competitive fire he’s displaying in what is likely his final season. \nThis is so weird. Manning is a liability to the Broncos now. He’s thrown 10 interceptions in six games. He’s completing the lowest percentage of his passes since his rookie season. Denver’s defense is dragging him to victory after victory. Some people actually believe he should be benched for gangly Brock Osweiler. \nIt was just two years ago that Manning tossed 55 touchdowns and only 10 interceptions for the entire season. He was the MVP and a number of experts hailed him as the greatest QB of all time. I hated that Manning. I believed he was overhyped, a product of football rules massaged to make quarterbacks TV stars as ratings-grabbing as Donald Trump, Oprah Winfrey and Charlie Sheen. \nI had Manning pegged as soft, much softer than Brady, a QB as fierce in the pocket as Phil Simms. But this year Manning is displaying a kind of toughness that is just as valuable as taking a big hit in the pocket to deliver a ball downfield. Manning’s competitive toughness is a joy to watch. \nStripped of arm strength and playing for a head coach exercising more control over the offense, Manning is digging deeper than ever before to be an asset for a football team. He only has success when he outthinks the opponent. He’s surviving solely off preparation. Thirty-plus years of QB preparation are fueling Manning this season. \nIt’s cool to watch. I can see how much the game means to him. It means the world. Football means as much to Manning as it did to Ray Lewis and Dick Butkus and Mike Singletary. I can finally see Manning’s football soul, his emotion. He’s not some computer program rigged by Archie Manning. Peyton is a warrior. I’m rooting for him. I now appreciate his greatness in a way I never did before. \nNo way should the Broncos – 6-0 so far – bench Manning. His teammates are feeding off his competitive fire. He’s Willis Reed dragging a wounded leg during a playoff series. He’s so respected in the locker room that the players are rallying around him and they’re convinced he’ll deliver when they need him the most. \nSome people have wrongly analogized this Denver season to Elway’s final years as a Bronco. They suggest Denver’s D is carrying Manning the way Terrell Davis carried Elway. It’s a really bad analogy. Elway was a Pro Bowler his final two seasons. He threw 11 and 10 interceptions, respectively, his Super Bowl-winning seasons. \nManning and the Broncos remind me of the ‘85 Chicago Bears, an all-time great defense paired with a quarterback who fit the personality of the team. As the season progresses, Manning will get more and more comfortable with the fact that Father Time has spoken, he’ll make further adjustments to his expectations and he’ll manage the game and take strategic strikes. \nI’m now on the Manning bandwagon. I hope he gets his second Super Bowl. \nIn 2010, here’s how I ranked the all-time QBs: 1. Elway; 2. Joe Montana; 3. Johnny Unitas; 4. Dan Marino; 5. Steve Young; 6. Tom Brady; 7. Brett Favre; 8. Peyton Manning; 9. Roger Staubach; 10. Fran Tarkenton. \nToday, I’d rank them: 1. Elway; 2. Montana; 3. Unitas; 4. Brady; 5. Marino; 6. Manning; 7. Young; 8. Favre; 9. Staubach; 10. Tarkenton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:43:02.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
