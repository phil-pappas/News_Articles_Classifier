Stanford was picked to finish ninth. \nArizona was tabbed to win the conference title in a vote that was released during Thursday's Pac-12 media in San Francisco. The Wildcats have won the conference title nine of the previous 13 times they were picked first. \nThe Wildcats received 18 first place votes and 408 total points, compared with nine first-place votes and 378 votes for Cal, which features three returning starters and elite freshmen Jaylen Brown and Ivan Rabb. \nStanford is replacing three departed senior starters, including career scoring king Chasson Randle. \nPac-12 commissioner Larry Scott says he's intrigued by the idea of pushing back the start of the college basketball season and creating a one-semester sport. \n\"I absolutely think it should be explored. We should look at everything,\" he told reporters at Pac-12 media day. He also said the status quo has merit. \n\"We should realize that March Madness is something very unique, part of the psyche of the American sports fan, something that is very hard to re-create,\" he said. \"I do love the idea of college basketball being a one-semester sport.\" Women's soccer Samantha Witteman's goal at the 61-minute mark lifted No. 23 Cal to a 1-0 win over 19th-ranked Santa Clara in Berkeley.

Cal's Emily Boyd had three saves, and Andi Tostanoski had five for Santa Clara (9-5-0). Swimming Freshmen Amy Bilquist and Katie McLaughlin won two events each to lead the Cal women to a 174-120 victory over Utah at Spieker Aquatics Complex. \nBilquist won the 50-yard freestyle (23.05 seconds) and 200 backstroke (1:57.03). McLaughlin took the 200 free (1:46.65) and 500 free (4:50.40). \nThe Cal men beat Utah 165-128 as Ryan Murphy won the 50 freestyle (20.15) and 100 butterfly (47.22, fastest in the nation this year) and also swam on the winning 200 medley relay. \nFreshman Andrew Seliskar was Cal's other double winner, taking the 100 backstroke (49.11) and 200 breaststroke (2:00.46). Volleyball Nikki Hess recorded 15 kills and Kirsten Mead had 36 assists as Santa Clara (15-4, 6-1 West Coast Conference) swept past Pepperdine 25-15, 25-18, 25-22 in Malibu. \nIt was the Broncos' sixth consecutive victory. \nSan Jose State outlasted visiting Wyoming in five games, 18-25, 25-22, 26-28, 25-14, 16-14. \nGiulia Gavio had 16 kills and Tyanna Roy 14 to lead five players in double figures for the Spartans (11-9, 3-4 Mountain West). Softball Stanford's Jessica Plaza, Cal's Jazmyn Jackson and Annie Aldrete and former Bears star Valerie Arioto were among 43 players invited to compete at the 2016 USA Softball Women's National Team selection camp in January in Irvine.
