Fresh off last week’s signature win over Hershey, Greencastle-Antrim took care of business in dominant fashion Friday night against struggling James Buchanan, rolling to a 49-0 Mid-Penn Colonial Division victory. Some viewed this as a possible trap game for the Blue Devils (6-1, 2-1 MPC-Colonial), perhaps overlooking the Rockets (0-7, 0-4 MPC-Colonial) in anticipation of their upcoming showdown with league-leading Northern York. Turns out, G-A’s focus never wavered from the task at hand. “We pretty much did what we wanted to do in the first half, which allowed us to take out our starters,” Blue Devil head coach Chuck Tinninis said. “Most of them were out in the third quarter, and all of them were out in the fourth.” During that first half, Greencastle’s high-powered offense scored on all five possessions, racking up 364 yards, 19 first downs and a 34-0 lead at the break. Comfortably in control, Tinninis elected to pull several starters to begin the third quarter before eventually cutting loose the reserves on both sides of the ball. As a team, the Blue Devils amassed 431 yards of total offense while holding the Rockets to just 139. Quite simply, Greencastle had its way from the opening whistle. Receiving the kickoff, the Blue Devils needed just four plays to find the end zone, as quarterback Spencer Meyers connected with Demetrius Burton for a 40-yard touchdown and a 7-0 advantage. Imposing their will on the ground, G-A’s stable of running backs split carries throughout the ensuing 85-yard drive, capped by Kyrin Zimmerman’s 20-yard score on an inside reverse, pushing the margin to 14. After the defense held deep in its own end to force a turnover on downs, the Blue Devils continued to pound the rock, covering 91 yards on nine combined carries. Gains of 20-plus yards by Derek Measell and Bailey Parker initially flipped the field prior to James Hines barreling in from the 4, making it 20-0 early in the second quarter. A 45-yard strike from Meyers to Measell highlighted G-A’s next drive, eventually setting up the senior signal caller’s second touchdown pass, this time to a wide-open Zach Koons for a 27-point advantage. Following another JB turnover on downs, three quick completions by Meyers gave the Blue Devils first-and-goal from the 2, positioned to put the game out of reach. From there, Parker powered across for the 34-0 lead at halftime, allowing G-A to take its foot off the gas to start the third. Seizing the opportunity, Joey Burns and Caleb Schaeffer served as the Blue Devils’ feature backs, collectively chewing up 59 yards on six carries, including a 15-yard touchdown run by Schaeffer. Page 2 of 2 - Measell added the exclamation point on JB’s next snap from scrimmage, intercepting a pass and returning it 53 yards to paydirt, producing the 49-0 final. Isaiah Peck also contributed an interception for the Blue Devils in the closing seconds of the fourth. “We got to play a lot of kids, which was nice,” Tinninis said. “They had some opportunities to get in there and make plays.” Despite relatively short nights, Meyers finished 8-of-12 for 158 yards through the air while Hines rushed for a team-high 58 yards on eight carries. Seth Carbaugh carried 14 times for 45 yards to lead the Rockets with Clay Ziemba catching two passes for 42 yards. G-A’s can now officially turn its attention to next Friday’s Homecoming contest against Northern York, who enters at 6-1 overall and tied atop the Colonial at 4-0. “We’re where we want to be,” Tinninis said. “It should be a pretty interesting rest of the season.” Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. at Kaley Field.
