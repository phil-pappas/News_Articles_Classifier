He won the first two events in the NHRA Mello Yello Countdown to the Championship. \n“That was a great run,” Worsham said. “Really, all weekend we’ve run well. Coming here and getting down the track all four runs definitely helped up the confidence. We’re looking good.” \nDave Connolly was the fastest in Top Fuel, Drew Skillman topped the Pro Stock field, and Jerry Savoie qualified first in Pro Stock Motorcycle in the fourth of the six Countdown events. \nConnolly had a 3.744 at 329.18, both track records, on Friday night. Skillman had a track-record 6.471 at 213.47 in a Chevy Camaro, and Savoie ran the quickest pass in Suzuki history with a 6.765 at 197.74 during the final session.
