(AP) - With Major League Baseball facing the possibility of having no black managers for the first time in nearly three decades, Commissioner Rob Manfred says the sport must improve minority hiring.\nSeattle fired Lloyd McClendon, the only remaining African-American manager, five days after the 2015 season ended. Cincinnati fired Dusty Baker after the 2013 season, and in 2014 Houston's Bo Porter was let go and Texas' Ron Washington quit.\nSpeaking on Monday ahead of the World Series opener, Manfred says \"we have had a year where our numbers are down in terms of the diversity that we have in some of our key positions\" and \"it's incumbent upon us to come up with additional programs and ways to make sure that our numbers look better over the long haul.\"\nNext year could be the first season with no black managers in the major leagues since 1984-87, according to Richard Lapchick of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sports at the University of Central Florida.\nCopyright 2015 All rights reserved.
