In the case that a Pac-12 teams makes the playoffs, the next highest rated team would be selected to go to the Rose Bowl. Looking at last season, when Oregon, the Pac-12 champion, was selected to compete in the playoffs, the Pac-12 runner-up and South Division champion Arizona represented the Pac-12 in the lower-level bowl game. \nEssentially, if this year's college football playoff committee resembles last season's selections, the Utes would have two chances to make a New Year's Six bowl game, either as the Pac-12 champion or runner-up. \nBut Utah may have some in-state company in the major bowl games. \nWith a win over Boise State this past weekend, the Utah State Aggies find themselves in the driver's seat in the Mountain West Conference Mountain Division as the only undefeated team remaining in conference. The Aggies travel to San Diego State, the current West Division leaders, with a chance to hand the Aztecs their first loss in conference. With a win, the Aggies will be heavily favored in all of their remaining conference games. \nThe New Year's Six bowl games are required to feature the top Group of Five team, according to the college football playoff laws, granting access to the lower level conferences to find end of season representation. \nUtah State will need some help if it wants to become that representative, but the pathway is there. Currently, six teams sit in front of USU in the Associated Press' top 25 rankings, with the Aggies receiving the 36th most votes. Memphis is the leading Group of Five vote getter, having jumped to the 18th-ranked team in the latest rankings.

With only conference champions being considered, if the Aggies were to win the MWC, they'd be competing with the champion from the Conference USA, American Athletic Conference and Mid-American Conference for the New Year's Six bowl spot. If a lower ranked team were to upset a higher ranked team in these conference championship games, USU could easily find itself in a prized bowl game. \nIronically, it may not be Utah State's conference play that determines whether it makes the New Year's Six bowl games, but an in-state rivalry game with BYU in the final game of the regular season. BYU is on a three-game winning streak, which it could easily extend to seven if it is able to get a win over Missouri on Nov. 14. With BYU already receiving the 27th most votes in the latest AP top 25 rankings, it would likely find itself as a top 25 team. If Utah State runs the table in the MWC, it would be on an eight-game winning streak, and like BYU, find itself in the top 25. \nIf the Aggies were to take down BYU in the final game of the season, they'd get a late season boost in the eyes of the college football playoff committee. \nWhile the Utes appear to have the best odds of any local team to make a New Year's Six bowl game, don't be surprised to see their neighbors to the north make a serious push for a prestigious appearance of their own, that is of course, if BYU doesn't derail their plans first.
