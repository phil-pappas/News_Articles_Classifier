Darren Ambrose then put the home side in front. \nBut O’Connor rescued the Saddlers in stoppage while substitute Kieron Morris almost snatched it at the death when his strike from distance cannoned off the post. \nBoss Smith opted to stick the same 4-1-4-1 formation used in Tuesday night’s win against Barnsley but made two changes from the side that started in Yorkshire. \nRecalls were handed to fit again defenders James O’Connor and Andy Taylor with Matt Preston moving to the subs bench and Rico Henry missing out with an ankle injury. \nIn central midfield, skipper Adam Chambers made his 200th appearance in Saddlers colours. \nFor Colchester, experienced trio George Elokobi, Ambrose and Garvan were all named in Tony Humes’ starting XI. \nA total of 287 Saddlers had made the long trip to Essex but they had their hearts in their mouths inside two minutes when Craig MacGillivray’s clearance was chased down by Marvin Sordell. \nThe ball hit the striker and then fell kindly in the box for George Moncur but Chambers was on hand to expertly nip in and clear the danger. \nBuoyed by the move, the U’s continued to press and they came a whisker away again just moments later. \nA whipped in corner was met in the air by Elokobi but George Evans was in the right place to head off the line. \nColchester had made a bright start but in the 11th minute they found themselves behind through Romaine Sawyers’ sixth goal of the season. \nAfter a corner had been cleared, Anthony Forde regained possession and cut the ball back to the St Kitts and Nevis international who fired an unstoppable drive into the bottom corner. \nColchester responded with MacGillivray tipping a 20-yard drive from Alex Gilbey over the bar. \nAnd the U’s continued their bright start with Moncur gliding into the box and seeing a low strike well blocked by O’Connor. \nBut despite the home side’s attacking endeavour, Walsall doubled their advantage on the half-hour mark. \nLalkovic collected the ball on the edge of the box and hit a deflected strike nestled into the bottom corner and beyond the outstretched arms of Jamie Jones. \nColchester thought they had pulled immediately level when Ambrose’s lashed home a brilliant half-volley from 25-yards but the linesman had his flag up for offside. \nForde then took aim for the top corner but saw his strike well tipped over by the keeper. \nFalling two goals behind had taken some of the wind out of Colchester’s sails but they threated again just before the break with the lively Callum Harriott seeing a shot deflect inches past the post. \nBut within three minutes of the re-start Colchester had got themselves back into the game. \nAmbrose weaved his way down the right and cut the ball back to Moncur who curled a lovely strike into the top corner from 20-yards. \nAnd just two minutes later the home side where level with Ambrose again delivering a fine cross which allowed Sordell to tap home from close range. \nHaving seen a two-goal lead slip, anyone would have forgiven Walsall’s players for allowing their heads to drop. \nBut they responded emphatically by re-taking the lead. \nAfter Jason Demetriou saw a shot blocked, Chambers showed bundles of composure to cross for the on-rushing Evans who fired home first-time from 12-yards. \nYet the goal action wasn’t over and Colchester got back on level terms with virtually their next attack. \nA corner was punched clear by MacGillivray but only as far as Garvan who managed to steer the ball into the net from all of 30-yards. \nSmith responded by switching Morris and Jordan Cook for Lalkovic and Forde. \nAnd the move proved to be a positive one with Walsall quickly finding their free-flowing rhythm. \nYet it was the U’s who almost took the lead when Harriott’s cut back was fired wildly over the bar by Moncur. \nThe Saddlers responded with Cook getting to the byline and sending in a cross which was just too strong for an unmarked Tom Bradshaw. \nColchester then took the lead for the first time when another low cross from the right, this time from Harriott, was tapped home by Ambrose. \nSmith switched Evans for Flanagan with five minutes remaining. And the Saddlers almost pulled level with a defender nipping into to clear ahead of Tom Bradshaw following a goal mouth scramble. \nBut with the fourth official indicating six minutes of stoppage, the Saddlers did manage to snatch a point. \nAnother scramble eventually saw the ball fall for O’Connor who made no mistake by lashing into the roof of the net from six-yards. \nAnd with the wind in their sails, the Saddlers almost snatched it at the death when Morris cut inside and hit a rasping drive which cannoned off the post and to safety.
