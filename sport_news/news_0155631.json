He hasn't pitched since Sept. 24, when he faced the Cincinnati Reds.\nMatz had been projected to be the Mets' fourth starter in the playoffs, but his injury has put his availability for the NLDS in doubt. Still, the Mets aren't willing to rule Matz out yet, as they are waiting to see if he'll will be healthy enough to pitch in an instructional league game on Wednesday.\nPLUS : Rusty Staub suffers heart attack, now needs costly flight home from Ireland\n\"We're going to try to use the instructional league,\" Collins said. \"If he can't pitch Wednesday, there's a good chance he won't pitch. But if he can get an outing this week, or he can throw 90 to 100 pitches by midweek, he'll be okay.\"\nIf Matz's back heals in time for the NLDS, he could make his first major-league start in three weeks against the Los Angeles Dodgers in a potential elimination game or clinching scenario. Despite these potential circumstances, Collins expressed confidence in Matz's ability to deliver a strong postseason outing, even with the extended layoff.\n\"I'm not that concerned about it,\" Collins said. \"I'm sure every manager realizes it's the playoffs. It's still baseball. Nothing changes. Steven Matz has pitched against the Los Angeles Dodgers and pitched very well in his second start. If we can get out there that we know he's physically able to pitch the way he's capable of, I don't care what the scenario is. This guy can go out there and pitch a good ball game. He's done it, as I've said before, these guys have all grown up pitching big games. But if Steven is physically ready to do it, it doesn't scare me to put him out there.\"\nMaria Guardado may be reached at mguardado@njadvancemedia.com . Follow her on Twitter @mi_guardado .
