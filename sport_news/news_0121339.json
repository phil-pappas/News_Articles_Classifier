Filippenkov, who was 44, was the coach of the third-tier club. \nZenit says Filippenkov scored a goal before becoming ill five minutes before the end. \nFilippenkov played for CSKA Moscow from 1998-2001, finishing second in the Russian league and reaching a Russian Cup final. \nAfter taking his first head coaching job with Zenit Penza last year, Filippenkov built the team into a promotion contender. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:15:42.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
