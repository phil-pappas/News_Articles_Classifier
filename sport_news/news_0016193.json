The Walking Forward program managed by Avera Health has been awarded a $50,000 donation from the Pink Pony Fund of the Polo Ralph Lauren Foundation. Walking Forward assists Native Americans who live in Rapid City and surrounding communities as well as the Pine Ridge, Rosebud and Cheyenne River Reservations. It provides Native Americans access to clinical trials, palliative care and screening for colorectal, cervical, breast and prostate cancer. Since September 2013 in the United States, 25 percent of the purchase price of Pink Pony products benefits the Pink Pony Fund to support programs for cancer screening, early diagnosis, treatment, research and patient navigation.
