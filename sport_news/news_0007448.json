You get these in football and you've got to take full advantage – we did that. We've won 3-0 against 10 men. It was our first win and early on we showed nerves that first it's the derby and secondly we hadn't won. We exploited space and scored three goals. We've seen a lot of them home and away taking the game to opposition.\n\"Where they've slipped up is that they've left areas where you can exploit them and we noticed that. We could see if you got down the sides and got balls in the box.\"\nJones hopes the team can build momentum from the triumph.\n\"It's obviously massive. It's a derby win which makes it six in a row and that's great for the fans,\" Jones told Sky Sports. \"It's our first win of the season, and for the gaffer, and hopefully it can kickstart our season. Hopefully it can [be a springboard]. We spoke about the first win and getting closer to the other teams [at the bottom] where a gap developed.\n\"We go to Everton next weekend knowing back-to-back wins can get you out of trouble.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:27:49.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
