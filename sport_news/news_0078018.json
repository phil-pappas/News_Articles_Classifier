My game was much better than yesterday. I just didn't hole the putts.\" \nItaly's Giulia Sergas is four off the lead after carding a triple-bogey eight on the 18th in her 76 and admitted she was \" about to chew someone's head off\" after leaving the recording area. \n\"I went in the water twice,\" Sergas said. \"It was just the wrong club, wrong decision with the first shot and second shot. I'm now plus three, so you never know. If it happened to me it could happen to anybody.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:20:55.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
