I’m not saying one guy is better than the other. It’s the fit moreso and what gives us the best balance for the second unit, the best balance for the first unit.” \nIt was originally thought that Patterson would be the best ‘fit’ to play with centre Jonas Valanciunas, but his pre-season was poor enough that Luis Scola will fill the ‘4’ spot, just as he did on Oct. 18 at the ACC and again on Friday. \nIn seven pre-season games, four of which he started, Patterson averaged just 3.0 points, 2.1 rebounds, a single blocked shot and made only three three-pointers in just 10 attempts, not nearly enough looks for a guy who the Raptors need to spread the floor. \nMORE ’D,’ PLEASE \nWith or without Patterson starting, the Raptors are going to start their campaign on Wednesday night. DeMarre Carroll says he can’t wait. \n“We’re a little tired of playing each other, we’re just ready for the season,” he said. \nCarroll said he has enjoyed Casey’s defensive focus during training camp and that the team needs to continue to do more of the same to be successful this season. \n“I think everybody in the starting lineup can score, that’s not the hard part,” he said. “I think the hard part is trusting each other on defence, covering for each other because, if we can get stops, we can come down and score. We can learn the offence as we go, but first and foremost we have to keep focusing on defence.” \nCarroll said the second half against the Wizards, when Toronto held them to 19 and 18 points in the final two quarters, was the best defence the Raptors played all pre-season, and that a good start defensively will be key against the Pacers. \n“Indiana shoots a lot of threes, they try to play small ball with Paul George as a ‘4’, so we just have to focus on running guys at the three-point line and our bigs kind of protecting the rim. If we can do those things, I think we’ll come up with the win,” he said. \nCasey said the team will continue to work on some different offensive looks ahead of the Pacers matchup. \n“We’ve been working on a lot of sets that we haven’t shown or done in the pre-season, for good reason,” Casey said. “We’ll keep honing up on those, trying to click offensively, brush up on some other things defensively.” \nCasey also said that while defence is important, he doesn’t want it to get too far ahead of the offence. \n“The key is balance,” he said. “I don’t want to get in a situation where your defence is clicking at a high rate and your offence is out of rhythm. We want a balance. That’s the only way you can be successful in this league.” \nFLUID SITUATION \nIt remains to be seen how much the Raptors will miss Patterson’s outside shot. \nCasey said the team will try to be fluid in its configuration to deal with the lineup changes. \n“It’s a situation where we could play with two ‘4’ men and not really have any ‘3’ per se … it’s almost close to position-less. You can’t look and say: ‘That guy is a power forward, or that guy is a small forward.’ \n“We’re missing a little scoring but we have quite a few ‘4’ men, which is a good problem to have, but hopefully we can swing some of our ‘2’s to the ‘3’s and ‘4’s to the ‘3’s and let them play over there to get a little bit more balance.” \nRIM SHOTS \nCasey on guards Cory Joseph and Kyle Lowry: “I like what they bring to the table, those two together. Cory is gritty, Kyle is gritty, both of them are tough-minded guys, both of them can score in their own way … Casey on having a veteran like Scola on the roster: “It’s huge. In practice, he’ll make a point, make a coaching point, stop the play and just go and teach. You cannot put a value on that.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:28:47.313+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
