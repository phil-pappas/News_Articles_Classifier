RPI drops to 1-4-0, its lone win coming against top-ranked Boston College on Oct. 11.\nPlaying with 10 NHL draftees, Michigan got a pair of goals from Tyler Motte and Brendan Warren and scored three times in the final period to improve to 3-0-1.\nMore Information\nMICHIGAN 5, RPI 2\nMichigan 1 2 2 — 5\nRPI 0 1 1 — 2\nFirst period— 1, Michigan, Warren 1 (Marody, Martin) 2:40.

RPI, Kasdorf 1-4-0 (27-23).\nT— 2:15. A— 4,646.\n\"I thought we were a little tentative in the first period,\" RPI coach Seth Appert said. \"We made a few big mistakes; we didn't make a ton of mistakes and we didn't give up a ton of chances. Our turnovers and our mistakes are a little bigger when you're playing a team of their skill level.\"\nMichigan wasted little time getting the scoring under way, with Warren, a freshman, putting a wrister past RPI goalie Jason Kasdorf only 2:40 into the game from the left slot to give the Wolverines the first-period lead.\nIt took even less time starting the second period for the Wolverines to double their advantage. Motte scored on his stomach sliding across the right goal line when he pushed the puck just inside the left goal post only 28 seconds into the period. It was a goal both Appert and Kasdorf admitted shouldn't have been scored.\n\"There's a couple I would have liked back,\" Kasdorf said. \"I should have been off the post. I should have been involved. It would have been a simple save.\"\nBut RPI cut the Michigan lead in half when Zach Schroeder buried a rebound from just outside the crease at 5:03 after shots by Travis Fulton and Parker Reno were stopped.\nMichigan made it 3-1 at 15:11 on a wrister by Tony Calderone from the left circle and after Jake Wood scored on a power play with a great individual drive to the net at 12:27 of the final period, RPI was back in the game.\nLess than five minutes later, Warren scored again on a tipped shot from outside, then the Wolverines put it away with an empty-net goal from Motte at 18:26.\n\"We're trying to learn our lessons and fix our mistakes,\" said Wood, who scored his second goal of the season. \"We're working on those things and trying to get better every game.\"\nThe victory was Michigan's third in two seasons against the Engineers, having swept RPI in Ann Arbor last season. Michigan played Union to a 5-5 tie on Friday night in Schenectady.\n\"These were two tough teams,\" said Michigan coach Red Berenson . \"I really thought our team took it from them tonight. They (RPI) just couldn't get back in the game.\"\nMatt Graves is a freelance writer.", "external_links": ["http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775938/11/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775938/11/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/36/44/8775938/11/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-25T06:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:22:38.853+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
