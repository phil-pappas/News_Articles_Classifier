Switzerland's Mateo Sanz Lanz was third with ten points, the same as of China's Aichen Wang. \nRacing in the men's and women's events was split into two fleets - blue and yellow - according to the windsurfers' rankings. \nThe 26 year old Peina was unstoppable as she led in all the three races. A runner-up at the ISAF Sailing World Cup in Qingdao, China recently, Peina won the last race by an impressive one minute and six seconds. \nSpeaking after her dominating performance, Peina said, “My increased fitness and my ability to sustain the pumping played a big part. Also, I spent the last two weeks training here, which helped me a lot. I am familiar with the conditions here, including the hot breeze.” \n“It is a great venue for this sort of an event as we have the accommodation and training venue right next to the sea. It becomes so convenient and easy and the sailing conditions are superb as well,” she said. \nIn the men's fleet, racing was expectedly tight although the 9-10 knot shifty breeze proved a tactical challenge. \nLe Coq finished the day with two firsts and a second to go on top. The windsurfer from Brest, France said, “It was technically quite difficult on the race course, so I am pleased with my consistent performance. I was happy that I managed to be quite fast upwind, while downwind I sailed deep. Also, I like the conditions and I felt very comfortable out there today,” he said. “Getting a good start was very important and it worked out that way.” \nRacing continues on Tuesday with three more qualifying races for both fleets. After the concluding qualifying race, competitors will drop their worst race score. They will then be split into gold and silver fleets, to be determined by their overall positions.
