Rueben Randle is also good go, meaning Eli Manning should have a full arsenal at his disposal. \nIt felt like there was a decent chance Odell Beckham , Jr., could end up missing Monday night's divisional matchup against the Eagles . Or at the very least be a decoy. \nBased on the Giants wide receiver's warmups, however, it doesn't appear to be the case. \nBeckham is out on the field punting the ball (he's always doing something zany in warmups) and, as chronicled in video form by Ralph Vacchiano of the New York Daily News , looking pretty sharp with his cuts. \nThe Giants need Beckham to play and play well, with a potential shootout coming against the Eagles in Philadelphia. \nYeah, he's fine ... pic.twitter.com/aQTunG6fKa â€” Ralph Vacchiano (@RVacchianoNYDN) October 19, 2015 \nIf Beckham is a decoy, you wouldn't know it based on this video. He looks sharp as can be and potentially explosive. You're breathing a sigh of relief if you gambled and started him in fantasy this week. \nThe Giants should be feeling much better about their chances as well. \nESPN analyst Ray Lewis was spotted on the field talking to Beckham around 6:15 p.m. ET and, smiling broadly, said \"I think you have a good chance of seeing Odell Beckham play tonight.\" \nTom Coughlin told Suzy Kolber that Beckham \"is expected to play.\" \nBeckham is 'expected to play' Monday night.
