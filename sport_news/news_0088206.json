LOUIS — The Cubs played the Cardinals 19 times during the regular season but didn't face left-hander Jaime Garcia, who takes the mound Saturday for Game 2 of the National League Division Series.\nCubs manager Joe Maddon said his team will do its homework, but he thinks the first meeting could give Garcia the advantage.\n\"I've watched him from a distance; I know how good he is,\" Maddon said Friday. \"It can somewhat work in his favor.\"\nGarcia, 29, takes on Cubs right-hander Kyle Hendricks in what will be Garcia's seventh postseason appearance and first since the 2012 NLDS after battling injuries the last few seasons.\nGarcia's 2013 season ended after just nine starts because of left shoulder surgery to repair a torn labrum and rotator cuff, and he had 2014 surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome after pitching in just seven games. Those injuries came after Tommy John surgery in his rookie season in 2008.\nGarcia said there were \"tough days\" after his last surgery when he struggled with getting back to where he needed to be, but he is 10-6 with a 2.43 ERA in 20 starts this season.\n\"If it wasn't for all of the struggles and all of the downs in my career, I wouldn't be where I'm at at this point in my career — spiritually, physically and mentally,\" Garcia said. \"I just feel like we learn more from our downs than from our ups, and it's something I'm thankful for.\n\"Every time I take that mound, basically take it as if it's your last time ever to pitch in a major-league game. You don't take anything for granted.\"\nCardinals manager Mike Matheny also believes Garcia has grown from the injuries.\n\"You go through enough adversity, you're bound to grow from it if you're paying attention, and he pays close attention,\" Matheny said. \"He's a sharp guy. Through all the things that he's been through, just like any of us, you have a greater appreciation for things like health and opportunity.\"\nThe Cardinals haven't had much experience against Hendricks either. His only start against them this season was in May, when he allowed four earned runs in five innings. Hendricks, 25, expects a tough test in his postseason debut.\n\"They put together an unbelievable plan,\" he said. \"They know how to attack whatever pitcher they're facing that day, so when you're facing these guys, you've got to be thinking when you're on the mound. You've got to be in tune with the game, in tune with what they're trying to do, the at-bats they're putting together against you and make in-game adjustments.\"\nHendricks said he had been preparing for every possibility and wasn't caught off-guard to be named the starter over veteran Jason Hammel. Hendricks, 8-7 with a 3.95 ERA, said he will try to build on his last two starts, when he pitched 12 shutout innings against the Royals and the Brewers.\n\"I felt a lot better in my last two starts, was finally getting the ball down with some angle,\" Hendricks said. \"So I'm just trying to ... stay in that same zone, stay in my lane and just make good pitches tomorrow.\"\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Jaime Garcia Kyle Hendricks Chicago Cubs St. Louis Cardinals Joe Maddon Kansas City Royals", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56185a2f/turbine/ct-game-2-cubs-cardinals-spt-1010-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:59:18.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
