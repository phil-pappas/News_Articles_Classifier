(WKYT) UK football coach Mark Stoops hears it all the time. \"Everybody likes to put that bullseye on the quarterback.\" \nThe praise a quarterback receives can be uplifting and on the flip side, the negative analysis can be humbling. Patrick Towles has handled both extremely well. \n\"That's what I signed up for,\" said the junior from Highlands. \"This is what I want. I want everything that goes in with this position and I want the struggles that come with it. It's only going to make me a better player.\" \nHe's had his ups and down just like any QB and he has heard his share of cheers and deafening boos. For some reason it always falls on the shoulders of the same guy says Mark Stoops. \"Ya know it's always on the quarterback.\" Towles takes it all in stride. \n\"You can't really prepare for it. You want to convince yourself you know what it is going to be like, and stuff like that, but you can't. It's the most scrutinized position in sports. Really is the quarterback of any team. I'm always going to get too much of the credit when we win and maybe too much of the blame when we lose.\" \nWe all have had an opinion on the play of every quarterback we've ever seen. \nUK Offensive Coordinator Shannon Dawson is pleased through five game. \"In my opinion, the kid has made some big boy plays this year.\" \nBut at the end of the day, Towles has a firm handle on whose opinions make the most impact. \n\"The more stock that I put into what everybody else thinks, the worse shape I'll be. I've got two people I listen to about football and that's Coach Dawson and Coach Stoops. I think it's going to stay that way.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:46:41.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
