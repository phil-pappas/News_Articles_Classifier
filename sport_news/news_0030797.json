After being out for about an hour, Toomsoo, 12, said he recognized one of friends needed help.\n“When he was paddling in, I thought he was coming to get us and stuff and then his hand was all red and he was screaming for help,” Toomsoo said.\nAnother witness said a bystander wrapped his shirt around the victim’s bloody hand and several people called police. Beach patrol officials said the 14-year-old victim was bitten by a black tip shark that was between 4 and 5 feet long.\nPhotos of the victim taken by his friends show two open wounds on either side of his hand at the base of his fingers. They say he had surgery to repair the bite wounds.\nThere have been at least 10 shark attacks in Volusia County, FL this year, including one in the same area two weeks ago. Another 14-year-old surfer was bitten on his leg. Surfers, however, aren’t letting the threat of sharks keep from catching the waves.\n“We see sharks all the time,” Nick Anselmo said. “As a surfer, you can’t think about it.”\nToomsoo said even though he witnessed the attack first hand, he’s not afraid to venture back into the water either.\n“I’m not really scared about sharks,” Toomsoo said. “Now I know it can happen to anyone no matter what. You’re never safe.”\nThe victim said he punched the shark after it bit him to get away from it.\nCopyright 2015 WFTV/WSB/Witness photos via CNN.
