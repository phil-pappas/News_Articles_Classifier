It's one of my dream schools,\" he said. \"They'll definitely shoot up to the top with three or four others when they offer.\"\nOn Monday evening, after months of waiting, Crawford finally received the much-anticipated offer from the University of Oregon:\nSo grateful and excited to receive and offer to play at the University of Oregon! #GoDucks üê£‚úÖ pic.twitter.com/VhEKGRjIZv\n‚Äî VI (@kekoa_cRAWford) October 21, 2015\nGiven the late offer, and the fact that the dynamic playmaker had eliminated the Ducks from contention in August , it will be interesting to see exactly how much ground the program still has to make.\nAt the time of the elimination, Crawford said Oregon would \"easily\" jump into his top group.\nThat belief will now be tested.\nOregon already has four-star talent Dillon Mitchell in the fold, but would love to add another big-time playmaker ‚Äì and Crawford would fit the bill.\nThe California prospect is rated by Rivals as the No. 90 prospect in the country, and he holds offers from Arizona, Arizona State, Miami (Fla.), Michigan, Stanford, Tennessee, UCLA, USC, Washington and Washington State.\nOregon has wanted to add at least one more wide receiver to the class for some time. Expect Crawford to be one to watch until he makes a decision.\n-- Andrew Nemec\nanemec@oregonian.com\n@ AndrewNemec", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AndrewNemec", "https://twitter.com/kekoa_cRAWford/status/656677862414487552", "http://sports.yahoo.com/tcu/football/recruiting/player-Dylan-Crawford-158228", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoDucks?src=hash", "https://t.co/VhEKGRjIZv"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:32:00.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
