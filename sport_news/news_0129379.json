New Seasons Market, which has turned the phrases \"organically grown\" and \"locally produced\" into the building blocks of a successful corporate chain, seems to set the standard for how it can be done.\nSo it's not surprising that in the growing push for a higher minimum wage, New Seasons would not just weigh in but show how a pay hike can be handled even without a legislative mandate. The company announced recently that it would raise its starting wages from $10 an hour to $12 an hour , as The Oregonian/OregonLive's Anna Marum reported. The increase is lower than the popular $13.50 and $15 an hour proposals circulating among policymakers. But New Seasons' move is, as chief executive Wendy Collie told The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board, a significant investment from the company's bottom line, especially considering that the chain said it won't raise prices to pay for the wage increase.\nOregonomics The squeeze on middle-class jobs and threat to retirement security have everyone's concern -- all the more so in a time of the rebounding economy. But what can be done to restore hope for Oregonians? The editorial board of The Oregonian/ OregonLive is exploring questions that need to be answered in order to devise solutions that will put the state on a path to prosperity. Today: How one company is increasing its starting wages Previous editorials New Seasons also threw its support behind a government mandate to increase the minimum wage, provided there are certain \"common-sense\" conditions attached. The company's example, however, as well as the caveats it shares, show some of the hazards of a wage hike that businesses – even those that support increased wage floors - will face with a higher minimum wage.\nA wage boost for the lowest-paid necessa rily affects higher-paid employees . New Seasons did not want to boost its starting wage without recognizing its other employees, Collie said. So the privately held company is pushing through wage and salary increases for most of its 3,300-person work force throughout its 17-store chain to ensure that those who have labored with the company for years aren't neglected. The end result is the average wage across the company is now above $15 an hour, she said, at a cost of millions of dollars, said Collie, who declined to say exactly how much.\nCompanies will look for ways to pay for the change beyond taking a hit on profits. Collie said that the company will look at how to improve productivity and \"be smarter\" about how it operates its business. That means looking at whether the store can automate certain processes, change how they receive products from vendors or otherwise streamline the \"back of house\" functions that customers don't normally see.\nNew Seasons said it won't be reducing its staff as part of this change. But automation, for example, can lead to fewer new hires for a company, even if it doesn't displace existing employees.\nMandating the same wage increase for businesses in Portland compared to Prineville could sound the death knell for many rural businesses. Collie urged that the state recognize the difference in cost of living between rural Oregon and urban Oregon, echoing a theme in an opinion column she recently authored with Grand Central Bakery co-owner Claire Randall. Some of the farmers and fishermen from rural areas that supply the grocery chain simply could not absorb the cost of significantly higher wages, she noted.\nOregonian editorials Editorials reflect the collective opinion of The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board, which operates independently of the newsroom.

But even for a company with such progressive street cred as New Seasons, this is a tough sell among many $15 minimum wage advocates. While they agree that rural Oregon's cost-of-living is less than Portland's, they contend that the $15 figure is taking into account what rural Oregonians need.\n\"In Portland, the number that allows for self-sufficiency for a single parent is closer to $23 per hour, while at least half to all of Oregon's counties need at least $15 in order for families to attain self-sufficiency,\" according to the 15NowPDX coalition .\nUpscale companies like New Seasons will be better situated to deal with a mandated wage increase than businesses with a more price-conscious customer base. Collie noted that New Seasons would not, on its own, be able to institute a $15 starting wage without \"dramatically changing\" its operating model, labor structure and pricing. And no business wants to be an outlier on price.\nHence, her argument that a mandated increase in the minimum wage would create a \"level playing field\" for competition.\nThat's not really the right metaphor, however. New Seasons is not being singled out and forced to pay a higher wage than anyone else now nor would it in the future.\nWhile New Seasons has committed to not raising prices for this increase, it remains to be seen what happens if policymakers adopt a $15 minimum wage – and how fast one would be phased in. Collie acknowledged in general that \"if the minimum wage goes up over time, then everybody starts to raise prices over time or starts to operate (differently).\"\nExcept not every business can adjust operations and not every customer can absorb a price increase so painlessly. While Collie maintains that New Seasons isn't in an easier position than anyone else, you won't find $7.99 a pound for grass-fed beef hot dogs in many mass-market butcher cases.\nThis takes nothing away from New Seasons and its willingness to practice what it is preaching. Just as long as policymakers keep in mind the audience to whom they are preaching.\n– The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board", "external_links": ["http://www.15nowpdx.org/"], "published": "2015-10-09T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:26:08.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
