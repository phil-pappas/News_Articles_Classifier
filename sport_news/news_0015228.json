That's seven too many. On Thursday night, Andre Smith of Bogan High School was hit on the last play of the game against Chicago Vocational High . “It was a kick return play,” Stagg Stadium announcer Jimmy Smith told the Chicago Sun Times . “(Smith) was running and a guy blocked him, hit him pretty good and that was it. He went down and he got back up and walked backed to the visitor’s side of the field.”\nAfter walking off the field, Smith collapsed and was rushed to the Advocate Christ Medical Center. He died Friday morning. He was just 17 years old.\nSmith, who also played basketball and competed in track, was looking to make the Western Illinois football program as a walk on.\n Chicago Sun Times ]", "external_links": ["http://suntimeshighschoolsports.com/2015/10/23/bogan-football-player-dies-game/"], "published": "2015-10-24T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:25:42.368+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
