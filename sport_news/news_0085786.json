(Photo: Tony Ding / AP) \nEAST LANSING – Just when it was starting to look clear, it’s back to muddled – as muddled as it has been all season. \nThe Michigan State running back situation is a question again entering today’s home game for the No. 7 Spartans (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) against Indiana (4-3, 0-3). It is a four-man race now that junior Delton William’s redshirt has been removed, though there’s no word on when starting redshirt freshman Madre London (leg injury) will return. \nThe new starter, true freshman LJ Scott, had just eight carries for 16 yards (scoring twice) in last week’s 27-23 win at Michigan. The man who seemingly had fallen from the race, sophomore Gerald Holmes, was MSU’s best runner (eight carries, 33 yards) and pass protector at U-M. \n“Every opportunity he’s had this year he’s played well,” MSU co-offensive coordinator and running backs coach Dave Warner said of Holmes. “He’s performed well. So he’s right there in the mix with everyone. But there’s only one guy out there at a time. So those guys have to take advantage of their opportunities. But we’re excited about some of the things he’s done.” MSU happy to have quality, depth at running back \nWilliams said this week he’s excited about playing again and is determined to do what he can to improve. He had eight attempts for 15 yards at U-M and, like Scott, had a key miss in pass protection. Scott’s miscue is part of why he got less work than usual against the Wolverines. \n“Partially, yeah,” Warner said. “I don’t know that we played well overall at the running back position, I thought we missed some cuts. But part of it had to do with pass protection as well. Those other guys are just a little more experienced facing a wide variety of blitzes.” \nScott, with his team highs of 434 rushing yards and eight touchdowns, still looks like a back who could take over. But for now, Warner said, “it’s still a week by week deal.” CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1LSKRcM TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:23:28.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
