This North Portland charmer, a collaboration between bartender Lisa Hare and the collective, which features owners from The Bye and Bye, Dig A Pony, Jackknife and The Sweet Hereafter, took over the one-time Trebol space in July, expanding the dining room, adding a towering white bar and improving the already pleasant patio. Most nights, the bar fills with noisy crowds by 6 p.m., with bartenders sporting vintage cloche hats or colorful sleeve tattoos pouring beer into frosty steins. Inconceivably, Victoria's cocktails are inspired top-to-bottom by cult fantasy film \"The Princess Bride,\" including the Six Fingered Man, a citrusy beer cocktail made with rum and IPA, and the Murdered by Pirates, a muscular blend of scotch, rum and falernum. The Battle of Wits includes whiskey, dry vermouth, peach, black pepper and, blessedly, no iocane powder. There's food, too, including a small selection of southern coastal dishes like the low country boil, a one-pot mix of shrimp, kielbasa, potatoes and corn, plus several vegan-friendly options (buffalo-fried cauliflower po'boy, anyone?) and a pimento mac and cheese that's almost worth a visit on its own.\nOrder this: The Six Fingered Man and some pimento mac.\n4835 N.
