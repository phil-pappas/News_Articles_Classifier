Western Michigan is the only team with victories over more than one team among the top six in the league (Ohio University and Central Michigan). \nAt the bottom are four of seven teams without a conference victory. Kent State is the only one in that bunch with a pair of victories, albeit over winless Miami and UMass. \nThere are a lot of games yet to be played and a lot of potential for movement up and down, but for now, here are my overall power rankings and likely award winners, heading into the final five games of the season: \nTHE TOP TIER 1. Toledo (6-0, 3-0) - Nationally ranked at No. 19 and the most complete team in the league. 2. Western Michigan (3-3, 2-0) - Broncos have played toughest schedule in and out of conference. 3. Bowling Green (5-2, 3-0) - It's all about the 'O', although the 'D' is now better than given credit for. 4. Central Michigan (3-4, 2-1) - CMU already 1-1 in division so home game with Toledo will likely decide its fate. 5. Northern Illinois (4-3, 2-1) - Defending champs are rounding into form late, and still very much a factor. 6. Ohio (5-2, 2-1) - Bobcats' record is a product of the schedule. Stretch run will be telling. \nBest schedule down the stretch Central Michigan plays four of its final five games vs. bottom tier teams with the fifth being Toledo at home. \nToughest schedule down the stretch Toledo plays four of its final five against top tier teams, including Bowling Green and NIU. \nTHE BOTTOM TIER 7. Ball State (2-5, 1-2) - Young Cardinals have scored over 40 points twice and under 20 three times. 8. Kent State (3-4, 2-1) - If the Golden Flashes had any offensive punch they would sit much higher. 9. Akron (3-4, 1-2) - The ratio of wins to talent at Akron has yet to balance out, but time remains to be bowl eligible. 10. Buffalo (2-5, 1-2) - The Bulls are very much like Akron and could also make a big jump. 11. UMass (1-5, 0-2) - Easily the most disappointing team in the league to date. Poor defense and suspect offense. 12. Eastern Michigan (1-6, 0-3) - Eagles have shown signs of improvement, but no consistency. 13. Miami (1-6, 0-3) - RedHawks in the midst of rebuilding. Still a year away from 'any given Saturday.' \nBest schedule down the stretch Akron follows a well-timed bye week playing four of its final five games against bottom tier peers. \nToughest schedule down the stretch Eastern Michigan still has games vs. NIU, WMU and CMU. \nAWARDS WATCH \nOffensive Player of the Year - Matt Johnson, QB, Bowling Green, although Cooper Rush, QB, Central Michigan could emerge if he gets a West Division title. \nDefensive Player of the Year - Shawun Lurry DB, Northern Illinois already has seven interceptions, with at least one in all but one game this season. \nCoach of the Year - If Toledo wins out, Matt Campbell is the man, but John Bonamego, first year Central Michigan coach , has battled cancer since getting the job, has kept his team among the best in the league, and is a dark horse threat.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T23:18:02.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
