My goal was to catch Abby DeMeyer the senior girl on our team and it turned into a bit more than that. I’ve started to take in the top five in most of my races and I think I’ve done a good job. I feel really great. I’m excited to see my senior year and see what it really looks like if I’m doing this good as a freshman.” \nCoach Bill Dietrich’s thoughts \n“She is having a phenomenal season, it’s one of those learning curves where she jumps from the middle school race which is 1.5 miles to the high school race which is 5K. Sometimes they adapt very easily and sometimes it’s a tough transition but after the first three races she’s worked with Abby DeMeyer who is a senior captain and that all pulled each other through. There’s like four of them running in a pack and that made it easy for her. It’s very rare but she’s been doing a lot of prep work. She’s been on the cross country team since she was in fifth grade.” \nTaylor’s favorites \n•Song of all time: “Don’t stop believing” by Journey \n•TV show: “Castle” \n•Class: Gym \n•Food: Pizza \n•Saying or piece of advice: “I don’t stop when I’m tired, I stop when I’m done.” \n•Hobby: Snowmobiling \nWhat if ... \n•You could be any celebrity on earth for a week.
