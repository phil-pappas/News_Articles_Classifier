Tuskegee had different plans, however. The Golden Tigers continued their dominance over their rivals from Morehouse, scoring 35 first-half points en route to a 35-7 victory Saturday afternoon at A.J. McClung Memorial Stadium. \nTuskegee has now won 18 of the last 22 meetings against Morehouse dating backing to 1994, including winning the past four matchups. Since 2013, the Golden Tigers have completely dominated Morehouse, winning the classic by the scores of 54-10, 49-0 and now 35-7. \n\"I'm glad that we won and that this game is over,\" laughed 10 th -year head coach Willie Slater, who is 9-1 against Morehouse in his career. \"We now can focus on the next game without all this extra hype.\" \nThe Golden Tigers' defense was flying around the entire game forcing five interceptions, tying a nearly 30-year old program record. The last time Tuskegee had five interceptions in a game was in 1986 against Miles. \nSlater was very quick to recognize his strong defensive unit. \n\"They have been playing great all season long, except that hiccup last week,\" he said. \"The whole group deserves the credit, and they help this young offense that keeps making stupid mistakes.\" \nTuskegee (5-1, 2-0 SIAC) began the scoring quickly after forcing Morehouse to punt to begin the game, thanks to a questionable targeting call. On a third-and-long, Kevin Lacey was able to connect on a long pass to Devozea Gains over the middle of the field, but Gains was hit hard and high by Raynard Ware. The play was short of the first-yard marker, but the officials called targeting and gave the Golden Tigers an automatic first down. \nTwo plays later and Tuskegee was in the end zone as Josh Matthews took a handoff from the fullback position and rushed for the 8-yard score. \nFollowing the touchdown, Morehouse had two drives to put points on the board. However, one drive ended in an interception and the other ended with a short 18-yard punt. \nOnly needing to drive 25 yards to score a touchdown, the Golden Tigers made quick of it, using six plays to make it 14-0. Lacey ran the option to perfection, pitching the ball to Tyre Brooks after taking a hit that broke the running back free for the score. \nThings got worse quickly for Morehouse following the score. On the first play from scrimmage, Maroon Tiger quarterback Monqavious Johnson slipped as he threw, and Tuskegee linebacker Jason Ashley jumped in front of the intended receiver and returned it 29 yards for the score. \n\"That interception return was huge for our confidence,\" added Slater. \"I feel like after that touchdown Morehouse instantly had flashbacks to the last few years.\" \nTuskegee's defense continued to baffle Morehouse and Johnson late in the first quarter, forcing another punt that allowed the Golden Tigers to increase their lead even further. \nOn the pursing drive, Lacey found Leo Gilbert for a 34-yard play action completion which was followed by a big Dennis Norfleet run that put the Golden Tigers just three yards away from the end zone. \nA false start penalty back Tuskegee up five yards, but it didn't matter as Norfleet made all the yardage up on the next play as he hurdle into the end zone for the score to make it 28-0. \nTuskegee made it 35-0 with 9:16 left in the second quarter after Brooks scampered around the Morehouse defense to score his second touchdown of the game. \nThe second half was all about chewing the clock for Slater and Tuskegee as the Golden Tigers were able to continue to confuse the Morehouse offense. \nMorehouse (3-3, 1-1) head coach Rich Freeman played backup quarterback Kivon Taylor in the second half, but he ran into the same problems as Johnson did. Taylor threw three interceptions, including two in the red zone that smashed all the hopes of a Morehouse comeback. \nThe Maroon Tigers outgained Tuskegee 343-296 in the game, including picking up 232 yards from the air. Johnson, who entered the game with 12 total touchdowns and just four interceptions in five games, ended the day 11-for-21 for 151 yards and two picks. Taylor was 5-for-17 for 81 yards. \nLacey didn't have the greatest of games for Tuskegee, but it wasn't needed as the junior ended the game 8-for-16 with 108 yards from the air. Brooks rushed for 46 yards on 10 carries, including the two scores. \n\"We can't get too excited over this win,\" added Slater. \"From here on out, every time we take the field, we play a key conference game. We have to stay prepared.\" \nJoshua Fuller writes for the (Columbus) Ledger-Enquirer. 2 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1LoDMjY TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:54:10.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
