The Knights won 42-39 in 2014 in first-ever meeting between the two schools. ... The Knights are one of the hottest teams in the region with three straight wins. They are averaging 39.2 ppf over their last 4 games after scoring just 6 total points in their first two contests. ... The Raiders are yielding 45.6 ppg on defense. ...Habersham Central has lost 18 straight road games. The Raiders’ last win on the road was a 47-45 victory over Loganville in October 2011. \nHART COUNTY at JACKSON COUNTY -- WHEN: 7:30 p.m. -- HART COUNTY (4-2, 1-1 Region 8-AAA): Defeated East Jackson 62-0 last week -- JACKSON COUNTY (3-4, 0-3 Region 8-AAA): Lost 20-14 to Elbert County last week -- NOTABLE: Hart County leads series 12-0. The Bulldogs won 43-7 in 2014. ... The Panthers are on the precipice of missing out on the playoffs. They aren’t mathematically eliminated but they will need to win out and get some help along the way. However, the made history in their opener knocking off Madison County for the first time in program history and maybe history can repeat itself this week. ... Offense is the key for Jackson County. In their three wins, the Panthers have averaged 33 ppg. In their four losses they have scored a total of 21 points (5.2 ppg) with two shutouts. ... The Bulldogs were giving up 28.2 ppg until last week’s shutout win so it could be a favorable matchup for the Panthers. ... The Bulldogs, however, cannot afford a letdown. Their final three opponents after the Panthers are 15-4 and are fighting with them for a playoff berth. \nHERITAGE, CONYERS at LANIER -- WHEN: 7:30 p.m. -- WHERE: Lanier Community Stadium, Sugar Hill -- HERITAGE, CONYERS (0-6, 0-5 Region 8- ): Bye last week, lost 20-3 to Cedar Shoals two weeks ago -- LANIER (0-0,0-0 Region 8- ): Ranked No. 5 in Class ; defeated Gainesville 16-8 last week -- NOTABLE: Lanier leads series 1-0. The Longhorns won 49-20 in 2014 in first-ever meeting between the two schools. ... It looks a huge mismatch on paper. The Patriots have the second-worst offense in the region (52 points) while Lanier has allowed just 41 total points (6.8 ppg) on the season behind Derrick Brown, Devin Miller, Juwan Jones, and Michael Allen. ... It also could be a trap game with Lanier facing two tough road games to follow against Salem and Winder-Barrow that could help wrap up a second straight region title. ... The Longhorns have won 13 straight regular season games at home. Their only two losses at home since 2012 have been in the playoffs. Heritage has lost 6 straight road games. \nJEFFERSON at EAST JACKSON -- WHEN: 7:30 p.m. -- WHERE: Eagle Stadium, Commerce -- JEFFERSON (7-0, 3-0 Region 8-AAA): Ranked No. 3 in Class AAA; defeated Morgan County 17-0 last week -- EAST JACKSON (1-6, 0-3 Region 8-AAA): Lost 62-0 to Hart County last week -- NOTABLE: Jefferson leads series 5-0. The Dragons won 63-0 in 2014. ... The Dragons defense is third in Class AAA in points allowed (49, 7.0 ppg) which doesn’t bode well for an Eagles offense that has scored just 7 points in region play. ... It’s not any better on the other side of the ball for East Jackson. Jefferson is averaging 26.9 ppg while the Eagles have yielded the fourth-most points in Class AAA (282, 40.2 ppg). ... Jefferson, however, can’t get caught looking ahead to next week’s bye before closing out the season against Oconee County and Hart County in what should be a two-week showdown for the region title. \nLAKEVIEW ACADEMY at ATHENS ACADEMY -- WHEN: 7:30 p.m. -- LAKEVIEW ACADEMY (2-4, 1-3 Region 8-A): Lost 42-20 to George Walton Academy last week -- ATHENS ACADEMY (5-1, 3-1 Region 8-A): Lost 45-14 to No. 2 Prince Avenue last week -- NOTABLE: Athens Academy leads series 4-1.

Starting with the Spartans the Lions final four opponents have a combined 18-8 record. ... The Lions have been competitive with two of their losses by 5 points or less. Offensively their spread attack has averaged 15.3 ppg. Until last week, the Spartans were holding opponents to just 6.9 ppg. ... Lakeview’s defense has been tough yielding just 20.3 ppg. \nLUMPKIN COUNTY at BANKS COUNTY -- WHEN: 7:30 p.m. -- RADIO: WDUN 102.9 FM -- LUMPKIN COUNTY (2-5, 0-3 Region 7-AAA): Lost 41-35 to Fannin County last week -- BANKS COUNTY (4-2, 1-1 Region 7-AAA): Bye last week, defeated Fannin County 52-28 two weeks ago -- NOTABLE: Lumpkin County leads series 10-3. Banks County won 49-46 in 2014 snapping a six-game losing streak to the Indians going back to 1989. ... A huge game for the Leopards, who are peaking at the right time having 4 of their last 5 overall. A win keeps them in the mix for a region title with a monster showdown next week against Dawson County in Dawsonville. ... A young Indians team has found the going tough in 2014 after graduating several of their top players from last year. Defensively has the main issue allowing a region-worst 118 points (39.3 ppg) so far. They won’t get a break this week with a Leopards offense that is averaging 30.3 ppg on the season but 42.7 ppg in their four wins, including the Leopards biggest output last week since scoring 53 against East Hall in 2010. ... A loss for Lumpkin County would eliminate the Indians from the playoffs. \nMONROE AREA at BUFORD -- WHERE: Tom Riden Stadium, Buford -- MONROE AREA (2-4, 1-2 Region 8-AAAA): Lost 33-6 to North Oconee last week -- BUFORD (5-1, 3-0 Region 8-AAAA): Ranked No. 3 in Class AAAA; defeated North Hall 49-0 last week -- NOTABLE: Buford leads series 4-3. The Wolves won 51-12 in 2014 in first meeting between the two teams since 1951. ... This has the makings for a rout early on. Buford is rolling averaging 51.3 ppg in region play while the Hurricanes have scored just 12 total points during a two-game losing streak. Monroe Area is yielding 31.5 ppg on defense. ... The Wolves are just now getting close to full strength and will need it with a good North Oconee team coming to town next week and then a finish at home against Stephens County in the finale two weeks later. \nNORTH FORSYTH at JOHNS CREEK -- WHEN: 7:30 p.m. -- WHERE: Gladiators Stadium, Johns Creek -- NORTH FORSYTH (1-5, 1-4 Region 6- ): Lost 48-17 to West Forsyth last week -- JOHNS CREEK (3-3, 3-2 Region 6- ): Defeated Chattahoochee 26-21 last week -- NOTABLE: North Forsyth leads series 2-1, The Raiders won 14-13 in 2014. ... The Raiders offense has struggled during a four-game losing streak. After averaging 30.5 ppg the first two games of the season, the Raiders have scored just 43 points (10.7 ppg) since. Johns Creek, however, is yielding 26.7 ppg on defense so it could be a good matchup for the Raiders. ... It’s a key game for the Gladiators, who are locked in a tie for fourth with Centennial. The Raiders have a chance to play spoiler the last month of the season with three games against the top teams in the standings. \nNORTH HALL at MADISON COUNTY -- WHEN: 7:30 p.m. -- WHERE: Red Raider Stadium, Danielsville -- NORTH HALL (2-4, 1-2 Region 8-AAAA): Lost 49-0 to No. 3 Buford last week -- MADISON COUNTY (1-5, 1-3 Region 8-AAAA): Defeated Chestatee 59-29 last week -- NOTABLE: Madison County leads series 10-3. The Red Raiders won 49-20 in 2014. It was the first meeting between the two teams since 2001, which was the last North Hall win in the series at home. ... The Trojans took a step back last week despite playing the No. 3-ranked Wolves. They had lost by a point to Stephens County and then knocked off North Oconee on the road. ... Oddly enough, neither team is out of the playoff race despite just one region win each. The Trojans are tied with Monroe Area and White County for fourth place and Madison County is just 1/2-game behind that group. ... North Hall is a game behind North Oconee for third but owns the tiebreaker over the Titans so a win would put them in a strong position with all four games left against the other teams on the bottom of the region while the Titans still have to play Buford and Stephens County. ... The loser may be out of the playoff with three losses and so many teams bunched together. \nOGLETHORPE COUNTY at RIVERSIDE MILITARY -- WHEN: 7:30 p.m. -- OGLETHORPE COUNTY (0-7, 0-3 Region 8-AA): Lost 60-12 to Rabun County last week -- RIVERSIDE MILITARY (1-5, 0-2 Region 8-AA): Lost 14-3 to Washington-Wilkes last week -- NOTABLE: Oglethorpe County leads series 6-3. Riverside won 21-0 in 2014. The Eagles have won two straight in the series. ... This is an interesting matchup in that you have the worst offense in Class AA vs. the worst defense in Class AA going against each other. Oglethorpe County has been abysmal on defense allowing 339 points (48.4 ppg) which is 100 more than the next worst team in Class AA (Armuchee, 239) in points allowed. The Eagles, however, have scored a classification-low 34 points on the season (5.6 ppg). ... Riverside is very much alive in the playoff race and cannot afford a letdown. The Eagles are just 1/2-game behind fourth-place Greene County in the standings and the two teams meet next week in Greensboro. ... The Eagles still have No. 6 Union County left to play but also have Social Circle so a late season run is possible. \nPROVIDENCE CHRISTIAN at COMMERCE -- WHERE: Tiger Stadium, Commerce -- PROVIDENCE CHRISTIAN (0-6, 0-4 Region 8-A): Lost 21-14 to Hebron Christian last week -- COMMERCE (3-3, 2-2 Region 8-A): Bye last week, lost 35-14 to No. 2 Prince Avenue two weeks ago -- NOTABLE: Commerce leads series 1-0. The Tigers won 39-10 in 2014 in first-ever meeting between the two schools. ... The record is deceiving for Commerce. The Tigers’ three losses have been to Class AAA No. 3 Jefferson, Class A No. 2 Prince Avenue and to Athens Academy. The three teams are a combined 19-1 on the season. ... Expect after the off week for the Tigers, who are sixth in the Public power ratings, to tune up for the playoffs with the bottom teams in 8-A over the final month of the season. ... Only Towns County (217) has allowed more points than Providence (199) on the season while Commerce is averaging 24.6 ppg with its vaunted ground attack. \nTOWNS COUNTY at PRINCE AVENUE CHRISTIAN -- WHEN: 7:30 p.m. -- WHERE: Wolverine Field, Bogart -- TOWNS COUNTY (1-6, 1-4 Region 8-A): Lost 35-7 to Athens Christian last week -- PRINCE AVENUE CHRISTIAN (7-0, 5-0 Region 8-A): Ranked No. 2 in Class A; defeated Athens Academy 45-14 last week -- NOTABLE: Prince Avenue leads series 3-0. The Wolverines won 40-7 in 2014. ... It will be a tall task for Towns County. Prince Avenue leads Class A in scoring with 301 points (43 ppg) and is seventh in defense allowing 9.2 ppg. Meanwhile, the Indians have allowed 31 ppg on defense and have scored just 53 points all season. \nUNION COUNTY at RABUN COUNTY -- WHEN: 7:30 p.m. -- WHERE: Tiger -- UNION COUNTY (7-0, 3-0 Region 8-AA): Ranked No. 6 in Class AA; defeated Greene County 49-28 last week -- RABUN COUNTY (6-1, 3-0 Region 8-AA): Ranked No. 7 in Class AA; defeated Oglethorpe County 60-12 last week -- NOTABLE: Rabun County leads series 34-16. The Wildcats won 45-31 in 2014. ... It has been a streaky series that dates back to 1958. Rabun has won three straight after Union won five straight before that. ... This game will probably decide the region title, barring an upset over the final three weeks of the season. It will pit the Panthers’ No. 2 offense in Class AA (293 points, 41.8 ppg) against the Rabun defense, which is the stingiest unit in AA allowing just 55 total points (7.8 ppg) so something will have to give. ... The key matchup, however, may be the Rabun offense vs. the Union defense. The Wildcats are fifth in AA in scoring (251 points, 35.8 ppg) while the Union defense is giving up 18.1 ppg on the season. ... It is a critical stretch for Rabun County which has Washington-Wilkes up next followed by Greene County to end the regular season. The Tigers have righted their ship with two straight wins. \nWINDER-BARROW at CEDAR SHOALS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:16:41.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
