Then I saw Joe Marler starting and they were both doing exactly the same thing. It must be by design. Neither of them scrummage square.”\nAnother contentious area of any rugby match is the breakdown, where England repeatedly got on the wrong side of another French referee, Jerome Garces, against Wales.\nIn back-row forwards David Pocock and Michael Hooper, Australia have two of the best breakdown operators in the business.\n“Pocock and Hooper are great over the ball, which definitely means we have to focus extra hard there and work harder at preventing them from being successful, trying to take away their strength,” Morgan said. “If we can nullify their ability to get over the ball it will change the way the team has to play. They like to disrupt and slow people down.\n“But if we can get quick ball, it will change the pattern as well.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:38:32.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
