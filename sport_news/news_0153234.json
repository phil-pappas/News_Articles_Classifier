It was Ramapo's first appearance at Wayne Hills in four years and the Green Raiders' first win over the Patriots in Wayne since 2004. Wayne Hills had won nine of the last 10 games against the Green Raiders, dating back to the 2004 playoffs. \nThe 4-2 Patriots will seek to snap a two-game losing streak this Saturday night, when it travels to Teaneck High School. Kickoff time is 6 p.m. \nWayne Hills did everything offensively, but score points last Friday night. It moved the ball well, especially with junior tailback Luca Grave back in the lineup. But Ramapo (4-1) was clearly motivated for this game, especially after losing a 22-21 decision, at home, to Wayne Hills last season. \n\"Ramapo played a very good game,\" said Demikoff. \"They made plays and we didn't finish our drives. That was the difference. I could point to three key plays and pretty much say that's where we lost some good opportunities. But, again, the credit goes to Ramapo, because when they had to step up and make a key play on defense, they did it. (Ramapo head coach) Drew (Gibbs) has an excellent team and they're going to be tough on anyone they face the rest of the season.\" \nAs for his own team, Demikoff was disappointed in its ability to finish drives. \n\"We're right there, but the final score tells it all,\" the coach said. \"This was a big game for us, in that we had lost a close one to Pascack Valley a week ago and wanted to make a statement against a really good program, like Ramapo.\" \nThe Green Raiders were in control early, leading 14-0 in the second quarter before the Patriots got the offense going on a 61-yard shovel pass from quarterback Brendan DeVera to Grave. The play set up what would be Wayne Hills' only TD of the night, an eight-yard strike from DeVera to Vincent LoVerde that made it 14-7 after Dario Simi's PAT kick. \nOn its next series, Ramapo took advantage of a missed assignment in the Wayne Hills secondary to drive into the red zone, but the Patriots' defense stiffened and a field goal attempt was wide. \nLater in the second, Ramapo extended its lead to 20-7, but Wayne Hills put together an impressive drive at the end of the half, moving to within the eight yard line before an interception in the end zone ended the rally. \nIn the third quarter, Wayne Hills again drove deep, but lost the ball on downs when a pass in the end zone on fourth down fell incomplete. \n\"Twice, we're down 20-7 and are within a touchdown of making it a one possession game, and twice we didn't come through,\" said Demikoff. \"Eventually, it will cost you.\" \nIt did prove costly as Ramapo added two second-half scores to secure a 34-7 win. \nFor Wayne Hills, Grave accounted for over 200 yards of offense, rushing for 144 and hauling in that 61 yard pass. DeVera rushed 11 times for 61 yards while passing for 165 yards and one touchdown. LoVerde had three catches and the lone score and Joe Kenny continued his solid year on both sides of the ball. Kenny caught four passes for 80 yards and had 14 tackles on defense. Mike Zaccone, a sophomore, also played well, with 10 tackles. \nWhile Teaneck is not having a very good season, the Highwaymen have good athletes and are capable of big plays, according to Demikoff. \n\"Teaneck has shown the ability to score on every team they've played this year,\" said Demikoff. \"We're not taking any team lightly, especially Teaneck, which has plenty of offensive threats. The way we've been playing defense, we need to expect a bunch of different looks this Saturday and we better be ready for it.\" \nNOTES: A Wayne Hills victory on Saturday would all but assure it a spot in the upcoming NJSIAA playoffs. After this week's game, the Patriots will prepare for a huge assignment on Friday, Oct. 23, when it visits Paramus. Wins are big now for Wayne Hills, which would like to get a home game in the playoffs. \n\"Losing two straight probably cost us a home playoff game,\" said Demikoff. \"But we need to win games at this point and see what happens.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T18:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:28:29.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
