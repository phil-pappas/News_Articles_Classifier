Dickson (1-4 overall, 0-2 District 3A-4) stayed with the Wildcats in the first half and owned a 209-95 edge in offensive yards by intermission despite trailing by one point. Madill took control in the second half behind the running of seniors Micah Cooper, Ty Davis and Corbin Larason. The Wildcats started winning the war up front, and the Comets were unable to move the football throughout most of the final 24 minutes Madill (2-3,1-1), reversed the statistics and added to its lead following the break. The Wildcat offense rolled for 209 second-half yards, and the Madill defense held Dickson to just 69 yards following intermission. “This was a big win for us,” Madill coach Milton Cooper said. “We needed success in this game, and the players responded with the effort. “We had three tough games against three tough opponents prior to this contest, and we wanted to perform well tonight to gain back some confidence. We overcame a lot of adversity tonight with the penalties. This kind of adversity and our ability to overcome it will pay off for us on down the road.” Dickson took the lead on a long, steady drive that started at their own nine-yard line with eight minutes left in the first quarter. The Comets used 13 plays and five minutes of clock to move for a touchdown. Quarterback Cole King hit Jacob Reames on a 27-yard crossing pattern that Reames turned into a score to give the Comets a 6-0 lead. A special teams play early in the second helped set up the first Madill score. Davis returned a Dickson punt 23 yards to the Comets’ 29-yard line to put the Wildcats in prime position for a score. Six plays later, quarterback Jonathan Laffita hit Taber Bagley with a 20-yard scoring toss. After Jesus Alvarez’s kick, Madill had a 7-6 lead. The ensuing kickoff was fumbled by the Comets, and the Wildcats recovered at the Dickson 22-yard line with another short field ahead of them. This time it took Madill five plays to score, with Laffita taking it in on a quarterback keeper from a yard out for a 14-6 Wildcats’ lead. Dickson fought back with a score of their own late in the half. An 11-play, 75-yard march ended with King taking the ball around left end 10 yards for a touchdown to make it a 14-13 game as the teams headed to the locker room. Page 2 of 2 - “I thought we had good offensive tempo in the first half, but in the second half we just could not find a groove,” Dickson coach Bill Green said. “Our defense continued to play strong throughout the game. They were keeping us in the contest. But our offense just could not get untracked following halftime. I thought we matched up well against Madill, and I had hoped for a win. But we let this one get away from us.” A scoreless third quarter dominated by the Wildcats helped set up their third score. On the first play of the fourth, Davis scored on a four-yard run that capped a six-play, 64-yard march to put Madill up 20-13. A big defensive stand by the Comets held the Wildcats at the Dickson nine-yard line to keep Dickson’s hopes alive with 6:30 left in the game. The Comets drove to their own 25-yard line and was forced to go for it on fourth and 12 with time running out. King rolled left and headed for the first-down sticks. The Wildcats defenders knocked him out of bounds just short of his goal, and Madill took over at the Comets’ 37-yard line with 4:04 remaining. Two Dickson penalties moved the ball to the Dickson 11-yard line. Four plays later, Cooper scored on a 1-yard run to make it 26-13 and to dash the Comet hopes of a victory. “Our offensive and defensive lines took control in the second half,” Cooper said. “We had great blocking up front for our solid group of running backs. It doesn’t matter who we have as running back. Cooper, Davis and Larason are all excellent ball carriers. We don’t lose anything when we sub out with those three people. Plus they all had to play defense as well. It was a great showing by our entire team, especially in the second half. This was a must-win game for us.” Cooper finished with 125 yards rushing on 26 carries for the Wildcats, and Davis had six carries for 69 yards. Quentin Herbert led the Comets with 85 yards on 20 carries. Madill will host the Marlow Outlaws this Friday, and Dickson will travel to Plainview.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:18:31.440+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
