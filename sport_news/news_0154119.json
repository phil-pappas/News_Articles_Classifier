CBS Sports 128: 1-25 | 26-128 \nWhen it comes to the top of any college football rankings, one week can make a huge difference in the perception of the country's best teams. Only two teams (Ohio State and LSU) remain in the top five after Ole Miss, Notre Dame and Georgia all lost on Saturday, resulting a shake up throughout the CBS Sports 128. \nUtah, off in Week 5, moved up to No. 2 behind Ohio State; Baylor jumped up five spots to No. 3, LSU up one position to No. 4, and TCU up five spots from No. 10 following a vicious disassembly of the Texas Longhorns to round out the top five. \nGeorgia was one of the bigger movers this week, falling from No. 4 to No. 19 after the home loss to Alabama, who moved back up into the top ten to No. 9. Notre Dame dropped ten spots to No. 13, Ole Miss dropped 13 spots to No. 15 and UCLA dropped eleven spots to No. 18 after losses in Week 5. \nFlorida was a big winner this weekend and saw its stock jump in the CBS Sports 128 with a move from No. 22 to No. 11.\nAs we enter the conference schedule, it's clear the SEC has several teams worth considering for the league title as there are five teams in the top 15 positions of this week's rankings. But with no clear-cut favorite, LSU is the league's lone representative in the top five. \nHere's a breakdown how each conference fared in the top 25 of the CBS Sports 128 (highest-ranked team in parenthesis). \nSEC: 6 (No. 4 -- LSU)\nBig Ten: 5 (No. 1 -- Ohio State)\nPac-12: 5 (No. 2 -- Utah)\nBig 12: 4 (No. 3 -- Baylor)\nACC: 2 (No. 6 -- Clemson)\nAmerican: 2 (No. 24 -- Houston)\nIndependent: 1 (No. 13 -- Notre Dame)\nHere are the biggest risers and fallers after Week 5: \nRisers: Central Michigan , 75 (+26), Illinois , 49 (+25), Iowa State , 73 (+24), Arizona State , 37 (+19), Arkansas , 51 (+18), Virginia , 71 (+18).\nFallers: Oregon , 40 (-25), Nebraska , 69 (-23), Northern Illinois , -21 (78), Rice , 107 (-21), Arizona , 52 (-19), Virginia Tech , 72 (-19)\nAlex McAlister and Florida took a big leap up the CBS Sports 128 rankings.
