Filed: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 00:13 UK Last Updated: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 00:13 UK \nStoke City boss Mark Hughes has defended keeper Jack Butland for his challenge on Andre Ayew in his side's 1-0 win over Stoke City. \nThe England international miscued his kick as he attempted a clearance in the first half, and the ball landed on the edge of the box. Ayew and Butland raced to take possession, but the keeper ensured that his mistake would not be costly as he slid to clear the danger. \nHowever, the Swansea players reacted with fury over the manner of the tackle, which was echoed around the Liberty Stadium when the replay was shown on the big screen, but no action was taken by referee Robert Madley . \n\"The ball went under his foot and he had to try and retrieve it. It was probably a centre-half's tackle rather than a goalkeeper's tackle, but thankfully he got the ball first and was able to stop anything developing,\" Hughes told Sky Sports News . \n\"I was a little upset the replay was shown almost immediately in the stadium, that should not be allowed and that got a reaction from the crowd. We had to start to get a hold of the game to take that edge from the crowd again.\" \nStoke moved up to 11th in the Premier League as a result of their victory.
