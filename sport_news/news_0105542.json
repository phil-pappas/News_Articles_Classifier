Detroit didn't play its best on the road, but still found a way to win. \nAlthough coach Jeff Blashill stressed the importance of jumping out to a strong start in Detroit's second matchup with the Hurricanes, the Wings were sluggish at The Joe. \nThis time, they weren't as fortunate to walk away with their fourth straight victory. \n\"We probably found a way to win Game 2 when we weren't at our best and it's hard to do on a real consistent basis,\" said coach Jeff Blashill. \nON THE SCOREBOARD \nRiley Sheahan scored his first goal of the season to cut Carolina's lead to one goal late in the second period. Sheahan scooped up a rebound off Tomas Tatar's shot and used a quick backhand shot to beat Cam Ward. \nPOINT STREAK \nWings captain Henrik Zetterberg and rookie Dylan Larkin both extended their three-game point streaks on Friday. Zetterberg and Larkin recorded assists in Detroit's loss and have earned points in each of the team's first four games. Zetterberg leads the league with eight points. \nINJURY REPORT \nBlashill confirmed that Danny DeKeyser (foot) and Darren Helm (concussion) will be game-time decisions for Saturday's game against the Canadiens. Johan Franzen was placed on the seven-day injured reserve due to post-concussion symptoms. \nUP NEXT \nThe Red Wings won't have much time to dwell on Friday's loss. They boarded a plane after the game bound for Montreal, where they will play the Canadiens on Saturday, Oct. 17 (6:30 p.m. pregame, 7 p.m. face-off on FOX Sports Detroit).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:14:12.942+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
