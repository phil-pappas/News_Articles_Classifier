Shane Victorino spent the last part of 2015 playing for the Los Angeles Angels, who employed Klentak as assistant GM for the last four seasons. \n\"My phone has been blowing up the last few days from Shane Victorino,\" Klentak said. \"He's just through the roof excited.\" \nWhat did Victorino have to say? \n\"He said, 'Matt, when that team is good and is in the postseason, that place is rocking. There is no better town. You're going to love those fans. Those players. You're going to love everything about that city.'\" \nA 35-year-old Massachusetts native who spent the last four seasons as the Los Angeles Angels assistant GM, Klentak probably started getting a feel of what kind of media and fan expectations he'll be dealing with during his news conference. Again and again he asked how long it'll take to build a winner. \nWho can blame Klentak for not pinning down a certain year for an answer? After all, he hadn't even been to his new office yet. \nHis knowledge on the Phillies was from studying up for his interviews, although that'll change in a hurry because he headed from Citizens Bank Park to Philadelphia International to fly to Florida for organizational meetings that were scheduled to begin Monday night in Clearwater. \nIt already appears that Klentak has a needed Philly-management ingredient. He seems hungry to win. \n\"That is ultimately what this is all about,\" he said. \"You know that and I know that. Philadelphia knows that. That's why I'm here. I would not have left Mike Trout in his prime to come here if I didn't believe that. I promise you that. I look forward to contributing and helping this franchise get back to its winning ways.\" \nKlentak talked a good game his first day on the job. He sounded convincing insisting the Phillies will be winners again, perhaps sooner than some expect. \n\"I think the resources that this ownership has committed in the past and has committed to me that they will be committed again in the future is a huge advantage,\" he said. \"There's no question about it. That coupled with ... we will have the largest draft pool. We'll have the largest international pool. There's a lot of inherent advantages that are unique to this situation and also unique to this market. We will do it as fast as humanly possible.\" \nRandy Miller may be reached at rmiller@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @RandyJMiller .
