Going to the games, I really liked him as a running back when he was at Cal.“Still a big fan of him. It's going to be fun playing against him. He's a great running back. So it will be a great time.”Lynch is officially listed as questionable but Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said his team is counting on him returning Sunday from a strained hamstring that caused him to miss the last two games. Lynch is returning to start for the Seahawks (2-3) against Thompson and the Carolina Panthers (4-0) at CenturyLink Field.Thompson is returning to the city in which he starred at outside linebacker, defensive back and even running back at Washington. After then-UW coach Steve Sarkisian and defensive coordinator Justin Wilcox moved him from high-school star safety at Grant in Sacramento, California, to Huskies outside linebacker in 2012, Thompson took off. He became UW's do-it-all athlete and Carolina's 25th pick in May's draft. Five months later he's entrenched as the Panthers' starting strong-side linebacker. Sunday he will be guarding Seahawks tight end Jimmy Graham on some downs, chasing and perhaps spying quarterback Russell Wilson on others.It's the game of Thompson's 21-year-old life so far.“I can't wait. It's a second home, been there for three years. Loved it in Seattle,” said Thompson, who had to turn down endless UW ticket requests this week. “I can't wait to play in front of some of Husky nation, and it will just be a great homecoming.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:44:16.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
