The Hilltopper gridders led 15-14 at intermission, but inconsistency on both sides of the ball and a half-hour lightning delay over the final two quarters spelled defeat against visiting Sandwich, 36-22. It marked the third straight loss for Durfee, who dropped to 1-4 on the season. Behind by a pair of scores, the Hilltoppers stormed back late in the first half. On 3rd down and 7, Vieira completed a key 12-yard pass to wide receiver Nick Salmon, and picked up an additional 15 after Sandwich's personal foul. Vieira then found wide out Colin Medeiros in the Knights' end zone on a 15-yard strike with 2:03 left (14-7) Asante Monteiro (4 carries, 28 yards) electrified the Hilltoppers' home crowd, forcing a fumble at 1:46, putting Durfee on its own 29. With 31 seconds left, running back Eli Brooks (19 carries, 191 yards, 2 TD) powered his way up the middle for a 5-yard score. Vieira then faked out Sandwich, running in the conversion to give The Hilltoppers' its first lead, 15-14 before intermission. Durfee turned in a three-and-out opening the third quarter, but Sandwich immediately capitalized, blocking the punt and returning it for 18 yards at 9:56 to recapture the advantage 22-15. A lightning strike at 5:37 left in the quarter sent both teams into the locker rooms. According to MIAA regulations, a delay comes into effect up until 30 minutes after the first strike. \"I don't think that delay had anything to do with our performance,\" Durfee head coach Taylor Brown said. \"That blocked punt hurt us, and so did staying on the field after third and fourth downs. It's tough to win when making mental mistakes.\" The Knights' returned from suspended play and added another touchdown with 3:08 left in the quarter (29-15). Brooks brought Durfee to within a possession, chugging 60 yards into Sandwich's goal line eight seconds after (29-22). The Hilltoppers' endured more frustration, recovering the football on a squib kick, which was overturned after the referees ruled the ball didn't exceed 10 yards. Sandwich capitalized on the call, ending the night with RB Ryan McNally's second touchdown. \"We were gaining some momentum after our touchdown, and I thought we had (the ball) fair and square,\" said Brown. \"But it's out of our control and that's the way it goes.\" Vieira threw for 122 yards overall, but his outing also included four interceptions, three in the second half. No points were put on the board in the first stanza, but the Blue Knights' pulled ahead, 6-0 on Frank Kelleher's 5-yard run six seconds into the second. RB Ryan McNally ran in the Knights' second touchdown and added two on quarterback Tyler Cairns' conversion to Jason Mullin, as Sandwich led 14-0. \"Our defense and offense has played well in spurts all year, but haven't played how we're capable of for four quarters,\" Brown said. \"It's like we're a different team every quarter.\" By Connor Berube The Herald News, Fall River, MA By Connor Berube Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 10:56 PM Updated at 11:48 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:01:52.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
