The win leaves IOCL needing just a point from two games to qualify for the final whereas ONGC will be hoping for other results to go their way if they are to make it to the final.IOCL got off to a flying start as they won a penalty stroke 30 seconds into the game for a stick-check on Inderjit Singh. Sunil Yadav stepped up and slammed the ball into the roof of the net.More misery was piled on ONGCas Gangandeep Singh made it 2-0 in the ninth minute. Inderjit Singh’s shot was blocked by ONGC custodian, Navin, and the rebound fell kindly to Gagandeep who finished with a simple tap in.ONGC’s shoddy defending cost them again in the 18th minute as IOCL looked to have put the game to rest with a third. Affan Yousef made a darting run into the area and after cleverly shrugging off a couple of defenders, struck a shot that deflected off the stick of ONGC’s Diwaker Ram and ended up in the back of the net.IOCL were in no mood to relent and added another three minutes later courtesy of a penalty corner. Yadav grabbed his second of the game with a powerful low hit that flew past Navin into the bottom left corner. IOCL led 4-0 at half-time.The proceedings got worse for ONGC in the 47th minute as India international Yuvraj Walmiki showed his class with a breathtaking finish. After being forced wide in the area, Walmiki produced a rasping reverse hit, with absolutely no angle to work with, and beat Navin at the near post. There was some consolation for ONGC as Mandeep Antil pulled one back in the 55th minute.Earlier, Karnataka XI romped past Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL) 5-3 to keep alive their slim hopes of qualifying for the final.Results: Men: IOCL: 5 (Sunil Yadav 1st, 21st, Gagandeep Singh 9th, Affan Yousef 18th, Yuvraj Walmiki 47th) bt ONGC: 1 (Mandeep Antil); Karnataka XI: 5 (MD Raheel 7th, 38th, 47th, Poonacha MG 13th, Thimmanna PL 43rd) bt BPCL: 3 (Rajat Sharma 22nd, Jarnail Singh 48th, Gurpreet Singh 51st).
