According to the airline, the ongoing problem caused more than 450 flights to be delayed.\nMonday morning, websites that track delays and flight cancellations showed all Southwest Airlines flights were either on time or scheduled to depart at their regular times.\nSouthwest Airlines has been mum on the subject since its last update on Twitter Sunday afternoon where the company linked to statement saying travelers should arrive early, check-in online and print out boarding passes at home before arriving at the airport two hours early.\nA story Monday morning in USA Today said that the issue had been fixed by 5 a.m. PDT, and that Southwest Airline flights in the Eastern U.S. were running mostly on-time.\n-- Stuart Tomlinson\nstomlinson@oregonian.com\n503-221-8313\n@ORweather", "external_links": ["http://www.blogsouthwest.com/news/technology-challenges-affecting-online-and-airport-customer-servicing/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/todayinthesky/2015/10/12/glitch-southwest-airlines-warns-of-more-delays-on-monday/73804036/", "https://twitter.com/SouthwestAir?clk=GFOOTER-TWITTER", "http://www.fly.faa.gov/flyfaa/usmap.jsp", "http://www.flightview.com/airport/PDX-Portland-OR/departures", "https://twitter.com/ORweather"], "published": "2015-10-12T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:14:35.458+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
