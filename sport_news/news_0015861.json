We had clear chances and Rayo made for an end-to-end match. We consider possession to be a means of getting a result, and not an end in itself.\" \nThe coach, a former international team-mate of Paco Jemez with Spain, also heaped praise on the Rayo boss. \n\"I have a lot of respect for Paco because we were team-mates. He was a great defender and he is making his side better and better. I'm a big fan of his and I would like to see him at a big club.\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T11:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:10:09.032+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
