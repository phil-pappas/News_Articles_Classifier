The Michigan defense has held opponents scoreless in 14 of the last 16 quarters and allowed only seven points over the last 15 quarters. Saturday's goose egg represented the Wolverines' second straight shutout, a feat not achieved since 2000. It took the Terps until their final drive to top 100 yards of total offense for the day, an overwhelming feeling known well by Brigham Young. Both Maryland and BYU tallied only 105 yards against Michigan. On Saturday, the Wolverines also created three turnovers, held the Terps to a 1-for-18 showing on third down and allowed only 1.7 yards per play. After Maryland's first two possessions, the Terps produced only 35 yards on 46 plays. \nDrake Johnson: Looking like the same explosive running back who starred over the second half of last season, Johnson finished with 68 yards rushing on 13 carries, including a touchdown, and earned a 31-yard touchdown reception. Johnson capitalized on De'Veon Smith's absence and proved that he needs more touches as the season progresses. While Smith remains Michigan's most bruising rusher, Johnson clearly has the most pop and seems most able to turn the edge. \nThe defensive line: While the entire defense controlled the day, the line was especially dominant. The Wolverines pushed Maryland all over the field and spent the day in the Terps' backfield. Sacks were recorded Matt Godin (1.5), Willie Henry (1.0), Maurice Hurst Jr. (1.0) and Mario Ojemudia (0.5), and, all told, U-M finished with eight tackles for loss. Henry was especially disruptive through the day. On the downside, Ojemudia left the game with an apparent right leg injury . \nJehu Chesson: : The senior's second touchdown of the year came on a jet sweep that left all of Maryland in Chesson's vapor trail. He took it 66 yards for the Wolverines' second touchdown of the day and broke open what was a 14-0 game. Chesson also pulled in four catches for 41 yards. \nJourdan Lewis: Lewis was one of three Michigan players to record an interception, joining Jeremy Clark and Desmond Morgan, but Clark's was practically ceremonial. The junior has been U-M's best cover corner this season, proving himself to be among the best in the country, but before Saturday didn't have an INT to show for it. He finally got his at Maryland. \nSione Houma: Seeing increased playing time with Joe Kerridge out of action, Houma continues to show he has good hands and can make things happen with the ball. He caught two passes for 14 yards and ran two more times for 12 yards, all while continuing his reliable blocking. \nHOLDING STEADY Jake Rudock: The quarterback led Michigan to its fourth straight win, but it wasn't pretty. Rudock recorded his second fumble of the season and threw his sixth interception. Other than Drake Johnson turning a simple swing pass into a 31-yard touchdown, Rudock didn't complete a pass for more than 16 yards. Rudock completed 16-of-32 passes for 180 yards. \nSpecial teams: Michigan bottled up dangerous return specialist William Likely, thanks to solid coverage and handful of precise punts by Blake O'Neill, who averaged 40.3 yards on six attempts, putting two inside the 20 and booming one 59 yards. On the flipside, Jabrill Peppers recorded a season-long punt return of 31 yards. Michigan kicker Kenny Allen missed one field-goal attempt from 47 yards and converted two from 30 and 32 yards. \nSTOCK DOWN Ty Isaac: Michigan coaches tried to establish Isaac in the backfield with Smith out of the lineup, but didn't get results. He fumbled twice on six carries, landing firmly on the bench after putting the ball of the turf the second time. Isaac finished with 17 yards rushing. Additionally, Isaac broke free for a punt block attempt, but ended up colliding with the Maryland punter and giving the Terps a fresh set of downs. \nMichigan's ball protection and third-down efficiency: Michigan fumbled three times, losing two, and gave up one interception. While the Wolverines survives with those turnovers against a team like Maryland, they'll pay a heavy price if the mistakes continue the next two weeks against Northwestern and Michigan State. Moreover, Michigan was just 5 for 17 on third-down conversions. \nBrendan F. Quinn covers University of Michigan basketball and football. Follow him on Twitter for the latest on Wolverines hoops.
