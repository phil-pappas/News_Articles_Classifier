(Paul Sullivan / Chicago Tribune) Paul Sullivan Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Wrigley security worker Bob Gehrke remembered for his love of the Cubs, who loved him back. \nWhen Bob Gehrke retired from his job in plant maintenance at American Airlines 15 years ago, he was looking for something to keep him busy. \nIn 2001, Gehrke found the perfect opportunity: an opening in security with the Chicago Cubs, his favorite team since boyhood. Over the years, Gehrke could be found in different spots around Wrigley Field, but most of the time he guarded the entrance to the Cubs clubhouse. \n\"He was the biggest Cubs fan,\" said his wife, Lillian. \"I said to him this year, 'Watch 'em get to the World Series.' That's what he lived for. I guess he'll know.\" \nGehrke, 78, of Norridge, died of heart failure Oct. 13 at Resurrection Medical Center in Chicago. \nGehrke grew up on the North Side of Chicago and attended Steinmetz High School. He met his future wife, Lillian, at the Hub/Axle Roller Rink on Harlem Avenue in Norridge in the early 1960s, and they got married in 1963. \nAfter serving in the Marines and working jobs fixing car radios for the Chicago Police Department and with American Airlines, he joined Cubs security and immediately loved it. His preferred spot was outside the tunnel between the Cubs dugout and the clubhouse, where he would fist-bump players coming in after wins.

(Paul Sullivan / Chicago Tribune) \nCubs players loved Gehrke, who always had a positive outlook and was full of energy, telling everyone he met: \"You have a wonderful day.\" In 2013, Cubs second baseman Darwin Barney gave him a pair of shoes from the players, which Gehrke bragged about for weeks. \n\"Everyone walks through the tunnel, and he made everyone's day better, wishing us a splendid day, with the most genuine smile ever,\" Cubs President Theo Epstein said before Tuesday's playoff game against the New York Mets at Wrigley. \"Just a gentle, soft soul who loved the Cubs and cared about everyone who came through.\" \nOne of Gehrke's daughters, Kimberly Zepsa, died of lung cancer Sept. 13, a loss he could not get over. Lillian Gehrke said her husband became ill the day before the Cubs were to play the Cardinals in Game 3 of the National League Division Series at Wrigley, but was adamant about working the Oct. 12 game. \nManager Joe Maddon said Gehrke was distraught over the death of his daughter and was crying to him while guarding his position. \nChicago-area newsmakers and celebrities who died in 2015. \nGehrke was taken to Resurrection the next day, when the Cubs beat the Cardinals to advance to the National League Championship Series. He died that evening. \nGehrke had missed a ceremony to receive his 15-year pin from the Cubs while attending his daughter's funeral, so the Cubs will present the pin to his wife. This past summer Maddon presented Gehrke with a Cubs jersey with \"BOB\" on it, which his wife said he treasured. Lillian Gehrke said the jersey will be draped over her husband's casket at his funeral. \nGehrke was part of the Cubs family, and Epstein said the team would not forget his passion. \n\"Such an uplifting guy, it was a shame to hear the news, especially the timing,\" Epstein said. \"But we wish his family well, and when Joe said his spirit was living on in this tunnel, it's definitely true. I think everyone has been thinking about him walking through that tunnel.\" \nGehrke also is survived by a daughter, Jacqueline Nichols; mother, Marie Gehrke; four grandchildren; and one great-grandchild. \nVisitation will be from 3 to 9 p.m. Thursday at the Original Rago Brothers Funeral Home, 7751 W.
