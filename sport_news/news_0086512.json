We just have to learn how to be better from the neck up. No disrespect to them, but we are better than that [score].” \nRaines had been the only dent in the Buccaneers’ armor over the last five regular seasons, handing First Coast (1-5) its lone defeat — 18-10 in OT in 2013 — in a 48-1 run for the Buccaneers. \nIncluded in that was a savage, 62-7 beating last year and an overwhelming feeling that the Vikings (6-0), owners of the area’s most vicious defense, would repay the favor this time. \nIt wound up nothing of the sort. \nRaines went ahead 14-0 quick on a pair of Alex Rutledge touchdowns and then widened it to 20-0 midway through the third quarter on a Willie Wright 65-yard punt return for a score. But the expected breakaway to the finish, the running clock, the return beating, never materialized. \nPenalties were a glaring issue, a dreadful 16 of them for 155 yards, with four of those coming on fourth down to keep Buccaneers drives going. \n“We had too many yards in penalties,” said Rutledge, who had 174 yards rushing on 16 carries and scored on runs of 4, 29 and 53 yards. \n“We need all those yards going forward instead of backwards. We’ll go back to the drawing board. Coach said he’s got something for us for all those penalties.” \nSuper 11 selection Kevin Stepherson was the other problem for the Vikings. \nHe found his way through the Raines’ defense throughout the game, scoring more in one half than the Vikings had allowed in five full previous games combined (10). \nStepherson took a kickoff back 74 yards for a touchdown and helped turn a Vikings turnover into points on a 56-yard touchdown pass from Jevaro Hardy, trimming a Raines lead to 26-13 in the fourth quarter. The Buccaneers added a safety, too. \n“They’ve got a good football team. I think they’ve got to make a few corrections to make a run in the state playoffs, but they outplayed us tonight,” said First Coast coach Marty Lee. \n“We’ve got some things to clean up. We got three [district] games the rest of the season that we’ve got to worry about. It is what it is and that’s high school football.” \nRaines and its top-rated defense held First Coast to 30 rushing yards on 29 carries and had an interception by Davonte Lawrence on a trick play by Stepherson. Hardy finished 12-of-25 for 170 yards and a score. \nThe Vikings defense also stopped two deep drives by the Buccaneers, one that stalled at the Raines 4 and the other at the 28, both on downs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:45:55.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
