Wildcats head coach Mark Taylor said the coaching staff just about everything in their power to prevent the enormously lopsided 67-14 scoreboard, but it was to no avail.“They just laid down and quit in the second half,” Taylor said. “Nothing I could do about that. We played second string all second half. I have very seldom scored more than 50 points in a game. I hated it. I felt bad. We had guys score touchdowns tonight that have never carried the football.”Tanner Gaines opened the scoring from five yards out. Up next, Gaines connected with Jalen Furgeson or a 72-yard touchdown. Furgeson struck again, on defense this time, with a pick-six.Jacob Billingsly scored on a 47-yard run and Gaines connected with Jaden Graham for a 53-yard touchdown.Also making appearances in the end zone were Braxton Hendrix (a 1-yard touchdown carry), James Sims (32-yard carry) and Justin Walker (2-yard touchdown).The Wildcats’ (5-0, 3-0) undefeated 2A-4 Conference streak continues. Hector will host Mountainburg on Friday.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:26:00.922+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
