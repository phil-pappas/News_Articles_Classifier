Rams beat Cards with defense \nAn announcement could be made as early as Monday, according to multiple reports. \nThe Angels parted with Jerry Dipoto, who officially resigned in July, because of a rift with the on-field coaching staff. \nThe Angels considered their own personnel department, including former Dipoto assistants Matt Klentak and Scott Servais and director of pro scouting Hal Morris, before considering options from other teams. They included Eppler, Dodgers vice president Josh Byrnes and Blue Jays assistant general manager Tony LaCava. \nDipoto was hired earlier this week to become general manager of the Seattle Mariners. \nEppler has been with the Yankees since 2005, overseeing the reconfiguration of their scouting department. He was directly involved with scouting Masahiro Tanaka, including an extended stint following Tanaka's outings in person in Japan.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:42:57.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
