(Photo by Jamie Squire/Getty Images) TORONTO - \nKansas City Royals manager Ned Yost chose Chris Young over Kris Medlen as his starter for Game 4 of the ALCS on Tuesday. \nYoung has only made two starts since July 28, but they were good ones. He allowed one run in 11 1-3 innings over those two outings, with his final start coming Oct. 2. \nThe 6-foot-10, third-round draft pick out of Princeton in 2000 appeared as a reliever in Game 1 of the ALDS, giving up a run in four innings. Overall, he was 11-6 in 34 appearances — 18 starts — this year. \nYoung faced the Blue Jays once this year, a 7-5 loss on July 11. Edwin Encarnacion hit a two-run shot and Young yielded five hits and three runs over six innings. But over his 11-year career, Young has held current members of the Blue Jays to a .229 average (22 for 96) with two homers. \nMedlen was 6-2 with a 4.01 ERA in 15 appearances, including eight starts, this year. He returned from Tommy John surgery on July 20 and hasn't pitched since Oct. 1. \nGame 3 of the series is Monday night. The Royals have a 2 games - 0 games lead in the best-of-seven series. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
