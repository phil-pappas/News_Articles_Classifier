It doesn't help her cause at all that she will be ridden by a five-kg claiming rookie rider in Daman Singh, and may find herself overwhelmed opposite the judge as Ladybird, Providence, Victorious March, Visionist and Polished Chrome will attempt to go full-throttle in the final lap of the Delhi Race Club Trophy, the prime event of Saturday's bumper ten-race card.\nWhile I would never advise a bet in this race, indications are the eventual winner may emerge from the trio of Ladybird, Providence and Victorian March. The first-named, with advantage of a lung opener and assistance from Trevor Patel, is my choice.\nOne horse for whom I have been waiting for is three-year-old Uncle Scrooge, and despite the presence of the Pesi Shroff-trained first-timer Shooting Star in the fray, my money will most likely ride on Uncle Scrooge in the upper division of the Classical Act Plate. The MK Jadhav trainee has done a class IV+ rating on debut, and is expected to return to the winner's enclosure unless Shooting Star is in the Classic mould.\nFirst race at 1 pm.\nSelections:\nCielo Ray Plate - Div II (V, 1400m)\nZabrok 1, Secret Flame 2, Loveable Locks 3.\nThundering Power Plate - Div II (IV; 1000m)\nImperial Princess 1, Royal Sapphire 2, Locarno 3.\nCielo Ray Plate - Div I (V, 1400m)\nKiss The Star 1, Oreius 2, Midnight Star 3.\nClassical Act Plate - Div II (For 3y, maidens; 1400m)\nSeahorse 1, Grande Vitesse 2, Heather 3.\nParty Whip Trophy (For 2y; 1000m)\nDragon Of War 1, Siobhan 2, Night Fury 3.\nClassical Act Plate - Div I (For 3y, maidens; 1400m)\nUncle Scrooge 1, Shooting Star 2, Remember The Time 3.\nDelhi Race Club Trophy (Class I; 1200m)\nLadybird 1, Providence 2, Victorian March 3.\nGodrej Infinity Trophy (For 3y, maidens; 1000m)\nAnother Ace 1, Altus 2, Aamerican Agatta 3.\nPelican Double Stakes (IV; 2000m)\nBirkenhead 1, Huracan 2, Daishonin 3.\nThundering Power Plate - Div I (IV; 1000m)\nFew Dollars More 1, Scarlet Of Hope 2, Passion Prince 3.\nRecommendations\nBest bet: Seahorse (4-8)\nGood bet: Uncle Scrooge (6-6)\nChance bet: Imperial Princess (2-1)\nUpset: Gold Bag (7-3)\nToday's pools\nSuper jackpot pool: 5,6,7,8,9,10\nJackpot pool: I - 4,5,6,7,8; II - 6,7,8,9,10\nTreble pool: I - 3,4,5; II - 7,8,9; III - 8,9,10\nTanala pool: All races.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:04:42.369+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
