For starters, they could play for pride, redemption, and a poroporoake (farewell) for the coach and perhaps some of the more experienced players such as Leana de Bruin, Jodi Brown, and Casey Kopua. \nThe first game, which the Silver Ferns lost by 14 goals by the way, was Waimarama Taumaunu's 50th game as head coach, and she has already signalled this series will be her last in that role. \nTamaunu has experienced the highs and lows as a player, an administrator, an assistant coach and as a head coach. \nShe had a difficult job of filling Ruth Aitken's shoes, and instead chose a no-nonsense approach and created her own path to follow. \nThe players who have hinted at retirement have also had illustrious and resilient careers that should be celebrated. \nBrown first started her Silver Ferns career in 2002, won a World Championship, experienced detours along the way that were both positive (baby) and negative (injuries), and worked her way back into the team in 2012. \nDe Bruin played 34 tests for South Africa before moving to New Zealand in the new millennium and debuting for the Silver Fern in 2003. \nShe has been a stalwart of the team who also managed to earn back her black dress after having a baby (not an easy feat). \nCasey Kopua earned her Silver Fern stripes in 2004, made her on-court debut a year later, and has won gold medals at the World Youth Netball Championships, the Commonwealth Games and the World Netball Series, as well as three silver medals at the World Netball Champs. \nShe is also the most capped New Zealand netball captain, and recovered from a ruptured patella tendon to play in the World Cup in Sydney in August. \nAll these women deserve their time in the limelight, and, like the rugby players who get their 100th test cap presented to them after the game, they deserve to have their efforts and careers acknowledged. \nIn the furore that followed the All Blacks' annihilation of the French in the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals, the Constellation Cup hasn't had a chance to shine. \nResearch has shown that in the 1990s media coverage of women's sport in New Zealand rarely rose above 15% unless female athletes and teams were contributing to national identity via global multisport events such as the Commonwealth and Olympic Games. \nI'm not aware of any recent statistics with regards to New Zealand media coverage (which is complicated even more with social media) but the Silver Ferns, and those who may retire at the end of this series, deserve our attention and a great send-off. \nWatch the second game, and inspire the Silver Ferns to out-dazzle the diamonds next to them and on the Constellation Cup.
