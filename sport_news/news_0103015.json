By Jocelyn Sheets Newton Daily News \nPLEASANT HILL — All relays and nothing but relays. That is what the Southeast Polk Ram Relays is about. \nNCMP’s Aquagirls finished second behind Ankeny in the team scoring for both the varsity and junior varsity divisions at Thursday’s Rams Relays. Ankeny won the varsity competition with 116 points with NCMP in second with 81 followed by Southeast Polk with 72 in the eight-team field. In the junior varsity division, Ankeny posted a winning 81 points with NCMP with 70 and Southeast Polk with 55. \n“The whole meet is a relay meet, so that makes it really fun,” NCMP head coach Sarah Patterson said. “We let the seniors take over and lead the warmup, the pre-meet talk — everything. Their combined leadership is a thing of beauty.” \nHannah Rhoads and Samantha Hedrick combined to win the 200-yard individual medley relay in 4 minutes, 39.07 seconds. The Aquagirl duo was four seconds ahead of the second-place Ankeny team. Hedrick and Emily Miller claimed first place in the 100 butterfly relay in 2:03.39. \n“Samantha is so versatile, and is willing to swim wherever we need her. She is very focused and knows we need to keep training tough for a few more weeks,” Patterson said. \n“We are still in the training phase of our season. The junior varsity swimmers are starting to back off a little, but not much. The girls swam a little tired last night,but there were a lot of so lid times and some breakout efforts as well.” \nIn the medley relays, the NCMP varsity and junior varsity teams were second. The varsity team of Kaelee Knoll, Sierra Griffith, Miller, Rhoads, Sydney Jenkins, Lindsey Blommers, Hedrick, and Alexis Stout clocked a 3:56.18. The junior varsity team of Lakin Jenkins, Morgan Altman, Lynae Doland, Jaclyn Michener, Sarah Prendergast, Willa Colville, and Jessica Zahn posted a time of 4:27.85. \nElizabeth Myers and Madeline Webb were fourth in the 200 freestyle with a 4:18.51. Webb swam a season-best 2:07.29 despite having a severe ear infection over this last week. Blommers and Griffith placed second in the junior varsity 200 individual medley with a 5:09.50. \nStout and Sydney Jenkins were fifth in the 2 x 50 relay with Jenkins swimming a career-best split of 25.88 seconds. \n“Sydney has been practicing so well and has been so mentally. We are so proud of her and the grit and determination she has been showing,” Patterson said. \nTaylor Tremmel and Zahn placed sixth in the 500 freestyle and Zahn broke the six-minute mark with a 5:59.56. Patterson said she gave Zahn a big hug as this is a big milestone in a distance swimmer’s life. The team of Sarah Urias, who swam the event for the first time, and Alex Inskeep placed third in the junior varsity event. \nPatterson said both of the NCMP 200 freestyle relays did well. Standout splits came from Mariah Petro with a 33.71 seconds, Webb with a 26.48, Knoll with a 26.42, and Prendergast with a 26.89 seconds. \nThe 100 backstroke relays were a great event for the Aquagirls. Swimming the varsity race were Prendergast and Sydney Jenkins for second place. Julia Prime and Lakin Jenkins combined for second in the junior varsity event as both girls had personal-best times of 1:14.26 and 1:09.30, respectively. \nNCMP’s breaststroke swimmers were not to be outdone as both varsity and junior varsity relays were second. \n“Alexis DeVries and Sierra Griffith pushed Ankeny to the limit with splits of 1:20.63 and 1:14.08 in the junior varsity race. Lindsey Blommers and Hannah Rhoads watched those two race and figured they could do it too,” Patterson said. \n“Their race was even closer as they got touched out 2:28.02 to 2:28.26 by Ankeny. Both girls had good splits and Hannah was at a season best of 1:13.23. We’re so proud of all of these breaststrokers. They really take pride in swimming this stroke well.” \nThe Aquagirls’ junior varsity capped off the night by winning the 400 freestyle relay. Tremmel, Inskeep, Dusti Antle, Emily Hawkins, Brianna Fuller, Urias, Cami Schlosser, and Colville combined for the victory. Standout splits came from Antle, who dropped three seconds from her personal best time and Schosser who dropped two seconds. \nNCMP’s varsity squad battled hard for a third-place finish. Webb, Stout, Miller, Prendergast, Knoll, Myers, Sydney Jenkins, and Hedrick turned in a fast time. Standout splits came from Stout and Prendergast, who both swam low 58s and Sydney Jenkins, whose split was a 57.41. \n“Overall, it was a good meet with tons to build on a bit to work on,” Patterson said. “We look ahead to next week’s conference meet at Grinnell (Oct. 24), and then districts at Fort Dodge (Oct. 31) And, top off our season, we aim for the state meet in Marshalltown on Nov. 7.” \nContact Jocelyn Sheets at 641-792-3121 ext. 6535 or jsheets@newtondailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:27:40.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
