With the 2007 removal of Marmot Dam upstream, the Sandy has returned to being a free-flowing river, direct from the glaciers of Mount Hood to where it joins the Columbia River at Troutdale.\nYou never quite know how good the salmon viewing will be because of turbidity in the water. On Sunday, it wasn't particularly good, perhaps because overnight rain added some sediment, but the salmon didn't seem to care.\nAnywhere from 1,000 to 3,000 adult chinook make the journey up the Sandy from the Pacific Ocean, most spawning in the river as it winds through the many curves in Oxbow Park, then dying and returning nutrients back to the ecosystem.\nIt's a story well known to residents of the Pacific Northwest, but every year there seems to be a new human audience. This year was no different, as many families with young children, some riding on Dad's shoulders, made the short walk from the park's boat launch upstream to river access point L on the park map to reach this year's spawning grounds.\nThe splash of a fish tail drew exclamations from some of the viewers, but a clear view of the fish body was not to be had Sunday.\nSalmon spawning in Sandy River at Oxbow Regional Park Metro hosts Salmon Homecoming each year, inviting the community out to Oxbow Regional Park to take part in family-friendly activities with designated areas to watch the salmon spawning. By all accounts, this weekend's viewing was okay.\n\"The water clarity is certainly in the range of normal,\" said Mark Roger, an event volunteer from Tigard, \"though a few years ago the water was so clear you could look down and clearly see five or six fish holding in a pool.''\nThe spawning season continues into November, so clear water days could be ahead, though peak numbers of fish usually occur about now, in mid-October, according to Roger.\nHe went on to explain a bit of the process, though admitted he is not a fisheries biologist and learned most of what he knows by his own experience and his own research.\nThe fall run of chinook salmon leaves the ocean and enters the Columbia River from August until October, Roger said. It's only about 100 miles for these fish to reach their spawning grounds, a short distance compared with others of their species that may swim 1,000 miles or more in fresh water.\n\"These fish start their physical transformation almost as soon as they enter fresh water, so when the females get here they are ready to built their nests,'' Roger said.\nSalmon arrive together, but it's not like they are following a leader or traveling with friends. Each individually feels the urge to return to the home stream to spawn.\nThe female builds a nest, also called a redd, by scooping out cobble from a stretch of fast-flowing water. The ideal spot for a chinook redd is in rocks three to four inches around.\nThe eggs need lots of air, brought to them by fast-flowing water. A fast part of the stream makes for fewer predators and less silt accumulation. After the female lays eggs, several males battle over which gets to fertilize them.\nAfter a week or so of guarding the nest, the female either dies, or gets so weak she can no longer hold position in the current. From there the eggs are on their own, hatching in late winter and beginning the cycle again.\nIn four to six years, the few that survive will return to the Sandy River to spawn, perhaps during a future Salmon Homecoming at the park.\nIf you go: Oxbow Park is 25 miles east of downtown Portland. The easiest way to reach it is by driving Division Street all the way to the park entry road. Park admission is $5 per vehicle. Dogs are not allowed except service animals.
