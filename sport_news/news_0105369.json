SMU (1-6, 0-3) has lost five straight during a stretch in which the Mustangs have yielded 240 points. \nWith leading rusher Marlon Mack sitting out with a hamstring injury, Flowers broke USF's single-game rushing record for a quarterback on his first carry of the second half. Matt Grothe ran 146 yards against Connecticut in 2007, and Flowers nearly matched that with 142 on 13 attempts while building a 17-7 halftime lead. \nThe sophomore carried 10 more times in the second half to become the eighth player in USF history to top 200 yards rushing. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:54:21.667+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
