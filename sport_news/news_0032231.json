With seven weeks in the books, it may seem the season is nearing its conclusion, but there’re still seven weekends of football left until the last champions are crowned.\nPostseason at a glance\nLooking toward the postseason, 20 teams have already secured playoff berths, but 18 of them qualify just by showing up — all of Class 3AA South and the entire 2A classification. Logan (3AA North) and Juab (3A South) have played their way in.\nWith 20 berths locked up, 52 spots remain up for grabs.\nFourteen teams clinch playoff berths by winning this week regardless of the outcome of other games. In the larger classifications, they include Bingham and Jordan (Region 3), Lone Peak (Region 4), East (Region 5), Olympus (Region 6), Timpview (Region 7) and Springville (Region 8). Smaller classification candidates include Juan Diego (3A North), Canyon View, Manti and North Sanpete (3A South), Altamont (1A North), and Kanab and the winner of Monticello at Diamond Ranch (1A South).\nOther teams can clinch berths, too, but they’re dependant on the results of other games.\nUndefeated region matchups\nEight regions, including all four leagues in Class 5A, feature a pair of teams that remain undefeated in region play. Class 1A North and South each have three 1-0 teams, but they’ve barely begun region competition. This week, there are just two contests with teams unbeaten in region. In Class 4A, it’s Timpview at Corner Canyon (Region 7) and in 2A South, San Juan hosts Beaver.\nThe unbeaten\nEntering Week 8, seven teams remain undefeated. Diamond Ranch (5-0) is off to its best start ever. The Diamondbacks have won five in a row for the second time in school history and first time since 2012. Mountain Crest hasn’t started 6-0 since an 8-0 start in 1998.\nSpringville (7-0) has its best record since starting 10-0 in 2004. Sky View last saw 7-0 when the Bobcats won their first 11 contests in 2006. Lone Peak (7-0) is also off to its best start since its 14-0 season in 2011.\nDavis (7-0) started 9-0 in 2013, while South Summit (7-0) has matched its best-ever start of 2013.\nMost wins since\nNearly unbeaten Kearns (6-1) hasn’t won six games since going 7-4 in 2010. The Cougars haven’t been 6-1 since 1992 when they won 10 of their first 11 contests ... American Leadership (4-3) celebrates four wins for the first time in its 10-year history ... Provo (5-2) guns for six victories for the first time since 2009.\nConsecutive winning seasons\nBingham (6-1) is guaranteed its 12th straight winning campaign while Jordan (6-1) has secured its 11th straight and Davis (7-0), its 10th in a row. Highland (5-2), which has a bye this week, and San Juan (5-2) need one more victory to extend their streaks to 13 seasons, which would be the current state-high. (Skyline holds the all-time record: the Eagles had 23 consecutive winning seasons from 1989-2011.)\nThis week’s first-time matchups\nFive games pair programs meeting for the first time: Altamont at Wayne, Salem Hills at Westlake, Stansbury at Logan, Syracuse at Granger and Timpview at Corner Canyon.\nMost-played rivalries (min. 50 games)\nSpringville and Payson renew Utah’s fifth most-played rivalry for the 93rd time but first since 2010. Springville controls the series 54-31-7 and has won the last three.\nKanab holds a rather lopsided 68-4-1 series edge over Parowan as they play for the 74th time but first since 2012. The series began in 1949 and Kanab has won 51 straight over the Rams since 1971.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:39:47.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
