( USA TODAY ) – Dayton Moore has all the confidence in the world in Wade Davis, the closer he calls the best reliever in baseball – and has the stats to prove it. \nBut as the top of the ninth inning unfolded Friday, with the Toronto Blue Jays putting runners on second and third with no outs in a one-run game and the top of the lineup lurking, the Kansas City Royals general manager was not expecting any Houdini-like escapes. \nGetting to the bottom of the ninth tied would have sufficed for Moore. \n“Honestly, I was just hoping they wouldn’t score two and we’d win in the ninth,’’ Moore said. “Not to take anything away from Wade Davis because he’s certainly capable of getting out of jams and pitching in pressure situations, but they’re a great team. You expect them to probably put the ball in play.’’ \nNot against Davis, not in any way they could threaten the lead. \nAs a jam-packed Kauffman Stadium went from euphoria over the Royals taking a 4-3 lead in the eighth to an overwhelming fear that the Blue Jays may spoil the celebration, Davis calmly went about cleaning up the mess he had created by letting the inning’s first two runners get on base. \nWith some help from plate umpire Jeff Nelson’s suddenly wide strike zone, Davis got pinch hitter Dioner Navarro to whiff on a 98-mph fastball and leadoff man Ben Revere to swing through a wicked curveball for strike three. \nAL MVP favorite Josh Donaldson still had a chance to keep the Blue Jays alive after they had won four elimination games this postseason, but he grounded out to third as the Royals advanced to the World Series for the second year in a row with a 4-3 victory in Game 6 of the American League Championship Series. \nThe AL pennant, on the heels of the Royals winning their first division crown in 30 years, further validates Moore’s work in transforming the once-hapless franchise into a consistent contender packed with homegrown talent. \nEric Hosmer, who hit the eighth-inning single that drove in a hustling Lorenzo Cain with the winning run from first base, represents one of Kansas City’s cornerstones. So does Mike Moustakas, the third baseman who made the play on that last out. Yet another key piece is flamethrowing right-hander Yordano Ventura, who pitched 5 1/3 innings of one-run ball and could anchor the staff for years once he learns to harness his primo stuff. And ALCS MVP Alcides Escobar, though not homegrown, has developed into an All-Star shortstop as a Royal. \n“The core group has grown up together in the minor leagues and they’ve wanted to do something special in Kansas City for a long time,’’ Moore said. “They’re motivated, they’re focused and determined to win.’’ \nDavis was one of the pitchers the Royals acquired three years ago, in one of Moore’s most criticized trades. He relinquished three highly-regarded prospects – power-hitting outfielder Wil Myers and pitchers Jake Odorizzi and Mike Montgomery – to the Tampa Bay Rays for Davis and James Shields. \nShields was the staff ace for two seasons, helping the Royals reach the World Series last year for the first time since 1985, and Davis evolved from a so-so starter into one of the game’s most fearsome relievers. He registered ERAs of 1.00 and 0.94 in the last two seasons, with the latter one setting a franchise record, and took over as closer when Greg Holland faltered and was lost to injury this year. \nDavis actually entered Friday’s game in the eighth, after Jose Bautista tied the game 3-3 with a two-run homer and Edwin Encarnacion followed with a double. Davis closed out the inning, then had to wait out a 45-minute rain delay, as well as the Royals’ bottom of the eighth. \n“It definitely felt like it was longer than 15 minutes from what I originally heard, but it didn’t feel too long,’’ said Davis, who put a heat pack on his shoulder and rode a stationary bike to stay warm. “As long as I felt loose I was coming back out, especially when we scored.’’ \nManager Ned Yost acknowledged he got nervous about Davis’ ability to return to the mound as the delay grew longer, and that concern seemed justified after Russell Martin led off with a single and Kevin Pillar followed with a walk. Dalton Pompey and Pillar stole their way into third and second, respectively. \nYost stayed with his closer, getting reassurance in his faith from Holland – out following Tommy John elbow surgery – who told him Davis was determined to return to the World Series and would be fine. \n“That gave me a little bit of comfort coming from a fellow closer,’’ Yost said. “Even when he got a runner on third and nobody out, I knew Wade had that extra gear he finds in those situations, and boy, did he find it.’’ \nDavis and the rest of a sturdy bullpen, the Royals’ airtight defense and their relentless hitters are some of the main weapons the Royals will bring to the party beginning Tuesday, when they host the New York Mets in the World Series opener. \nLast year the Royals ended a 29-year absence from the playoffs and took the San Francisco Giants to the Game 7 of the World Series before bowing down to Madison Bumgarner in a 3-2 thriller. \nCain said that near-miss has fueled them. \n“Most definitely,’’ Cain said. “You remember how close you got and how much it hurt not to win it. Hopefully we’ll be able to prevail. It’s been a great run all the way around.” \nGALLERY: Top postseason moments ALCS Game 6: Blue Jays vs. Royals - Lorenzo Cain scores the Royals' go-ahead run from first base on a single from Eric Hosmer.
