Yet again. \nCatcher Miguel Montero, meet Mickey Owen.\nOwen suffered through a critical passed ball that ignited a Yankees’ rally in Game 4 of the 1941 World Series, a strikeout that should have been the last out of the game, but batter Tommy Henrich reached first base as Hugh Casey’s curve ball skipped off Owen’s glove and the Yankees soon turned a loss into a victory against the Dodgers.\nTuesday night at Wrigley Field in Game 3 of the NLCS, the score was tied 2-2 in the sixth when rookie Michael Conforto struck out on a curve ball with two outs and Yoenis Cespedes at third base. But Trevor Cahill’s pitch in the dirt bounced past Montero for a wild pitch and went all the way to the bricks.\nCespedes, who had easily stolen third, raced home with the go-ahead run as Conforto hustled to first.\nThis was not a passed ball. It was a wild pitch. There is a big difference. This is on the pitcher, but Montero said it was painful.\nThe Mets owned the lead and they were not about to give it up. They scored twice more in seventh to come away with the 5-2 victory over the Cubs and a 3-0 lead in the NLCS.\nOne more win and the Mets go to the World Series.\nOne more loss and the Cubs go where they’ve gone the last 107 years — home with no World Series title.\nThe Curse of the Billy Goat continues.\n“It hurts,’’ Montero said as he stood in front of his locker, reliving the agony of the fateful play.\n“I wanted that pitch there,’’ he said. “I wanted him to chase. I blocked the previous three pitches and I didn’t block that one. It cost us a run and gave them the lead. It was tough. I should have blocked it, I didn’t. Did I try? Yeah. But trying is not good enough for me.\n“Trying is for losers.’’\nYou had to feel for Montero, but that’s baseball on the October stage.\nNoted Cubs manager Joe Maddon, “Miggy’s able to block that ball a lot and he was upset with himself. It’s not an easy play, but it’s a play a catcher can make and he knows that … we just didn’t block the ball.’’\nNow the Cubs are looking at a miracle.\nThe Red Sox were in a similar position in 2004 and came back to stun the Yankees, winning four straight for young general manager Theo Epstein, who is now the Cubs president.\nThe Red Sox went on to win the World Series and broke the Curse of the Bambino, winning the World Series for the first time since 1918.\nThe Cubs are in much worse shape with the Curse of the Billy Goat, a billy goat named Murphy. Daniel Murphy hit another home run Tuesday night.\nThe Cubs have not won a World Series since 1908.\nIn 1969 when the Cubs were battling the Mets in September, a black cat cut across their path as the Mets eventually went on to win the World Series.\nThere’s always something: A Steve Bartman play. A painful wild pitch.\nThese Cubs have no luck when it comes to the postseason.\nIn 1941, the Yankees won the World Series the day after the Henrich play.\nThat was four short years before the Billy Goat Curse came into being.\nThe Cubs have to win four straight. Good luck.\nNoted first baseman Anthony Rizzo, “One New York team has blown a 3-0 lead. Let’s make it the other team. That’s the way we’re going to look at it.’’\nThese Mets have better pitching than those Yankees, though.\n“It’s going to be challenging, but I’ve seen it once before,’’ Montero said. “This is like trying to climb the Rocky Mountains. We can’t sit back and feel sorry for ourselves.”\nThere is no time for that.\nIt’s really the curse of great young pitching the Mets have thrown at the Cubs.\n“Man, those guys are good,’’ Montero said.\nYou make a mistake against the Mets, you pay.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chicago cubs ,  joe maddon ,  michael conforto ,  miguel montero ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  nlcs ,  yoenis cespedes", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:00:25.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
