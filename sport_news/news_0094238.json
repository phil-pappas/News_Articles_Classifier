Belichick has moved on to Miami, but let's take one more look at good win over tough Jets Comment By Jim Donaldson, Journal Sports Columnist providencejournal.com By Jim Donaldson, Journal Sports Columnist Posted Oct. 26, 2015 at 10:03 AM By Jim Donaldson, Journal Sports Columnist Posted Oct. 26, 2015 at 10:03 AM Bill Belichick surely is already on to Miami. He probably made that move Sunday night, given that the Dolphins will be coming to Foxboro on Thursday night. But we can afford to take a little more time to talk about the Jets and what was an impressive, come-from-behind, 30-23 victory for the Patriots on Sunday afternoon at Gillette Stadium. I wrote about Danny Amendola in my post-game column. With Patriots receivers – especially stone-fingered Brandon LaFell – dropping passes all over the place, and the Pats in danger of falling from the ranks of the unbeaten, the sure-handed Amendola saved the day with some clutch catches in the fourth quarter, highlighted by an 8-yard TD reception that gave New England a lead it never relinquished. But there are a number of other players who made noteworthy contributions to preserving the Patriots’ undefeated record in a game that screamed “upset.” The Jets came in ranked No. 1 in the NFL in fewest yards – and fewest points – allowed per game, with a defensive line that would be hard to handle for even the most experienced offensive line. And who did the Patriots have up front? Veteran Sebastian Vollmer was at left tackle. But, as Pats fan know, he’s supposed to be the right tackle and switched sides only because Nate Solder is now out for the season and his backup, Marcus Cannon, suffered a toe injury on the opening series at Indianapolis that sidelined him against the Jets. Also switching sides was Jake Kline, who moved from right guard to left because rookie starter Shaq Mason was out with a knee injury. At center, as he has been all season, was undrafted rookie David Andrews. Starting at right guard was another rookie, Tre Jackson, who was drafted in the fourth round out of Florida State. At right tackle was Cameron Fleming, who was a fourth-round pick last year, but was cut this summer and, after signing on with the Pats practice squad, was only activated the day before he wound up playing extensively against Indianapolis when Cannon got hurt. There was no way the Pats were going to be able to run the ball with that patchwork offensive line, so they didn’t even try. LeGarrette Blount and James White combined for just five carries and a gain of exactly one yard. Brady, for the first time in his 16-year, NFL career, led the team in rushing, with 15 yards on four carries. Even though the Jets knew Brady was going to be throwing on almost every play, they still couldn’t stop him. Recognizing coverages, as he does so well, and getting rid of the ball quickly, Brady completed 34 of 54 passes for 355 yards and two touchdowns, without an interception. He has thrown only one interception all season, and that one went off Julian Edelman’s hands in Indianapolis. Page 2 of 2 - At least nine passes went off receivers’ hands Sunday, with LaFell, just activated off the PUP list, dropping an embarrassing six of those. As one press box humorist noted, LaFell’s hands apparently were still on the Physically Unable to Perform list. But Brady remained unruffled by all the drops and led the one-dimensional Patriots to victory. “That’s why, one day, that guy will be in Canton (in the Pro Football Hall of Fame),” said Jets linebacker Calvin Pace. Prior to Amendola’s TD catch, the Pats were in a 3rd-and-17 situation at their own 27 when Brady connected with Edelman for 27 yards. “That was the back-breaker,” Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie said, as the Jets were leading, 20-16, at that point. Defensively, the Pats had problems at times getting off the field, allowing the Jets to convert 8 of 14 third-down situations. But linebackers Dont’a Hightower and Jamie Collins were outstanding, as they always are, and DL Rob Ninkovich knocked down four passes, which was more than any New England defensive back. Jets running back Chris Ivory came in as the NFL’s rushing leader, but was held to just 41 yards on 17 carries after having gained 146 against the Redskins and 166 against the Dolphins in the previous two games. Ivory was bothered by a tight hamstring early in the game, but Jets coach Todd Bowles said it was New England’s defense that was the problem. “I don’t think it affected him that much,” Bowles said. “Once he loosened up, he was OK.” It all added up to a very good win for New England. “There’s got to be different ways to win every week,” Brady said. To which Belichick added: “It definitely wasn’t our best performance, but in the end we were able to make the plays we needed to make when we needed to make them.” By Jim Donaldson, Journal Sports Columnist providencejournal.com By Jim Donaldson, Journal Sports Columnist Posted Oct. 26, 2015 at 10:03 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:00:52.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
