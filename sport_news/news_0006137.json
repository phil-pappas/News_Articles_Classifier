He found the rebound from Jake Muzzin's shot and slapped it past goalie Cam Talbot. \nConnor McDavid nearly tied it for Edmonton with 5.2 seconds left, but Jonathan Quick sprawled to catch his backhander right at the goal line. A replay review upheld the no-goal call. \nPearson's score came fewer than 3 minutes after Taylor Hall tied it for Edmonton on the power play. Hall redirected a pass from Ryan Nugent-Hopkins for his third of the season. \nAnze Kopitar and Jeff Carter also scored for the Kings. Drew Doughty had two assists. \nMcDavid set up Benoit Pouliot's first-period goal with an impressive sprint toward the net around a defender. McDavid and Nail Yakupov assisted on the goal, extending each of their point streaks to five games. \nJust over a minute later, Carter banked in a shot off Talbot from behind the goal line. \nKopitar picked the top corner on Talbot during an odd-man rush with 6:24 left in the second. \nEdmonton defenseman Justin Schultz left the game in the second with an undisclosed injury and did not return. \nNotes: It was the first meeting between the two teams this season. Edmonton won both games at home against the Kings last season, but lost the five-game series 3-2 overall. . Matt Hendricks (foot), Jordan Eberle (shoulder) and Griffin Reinhart (undisclosed) were out for Edmonton. . Dwight King (foot) and Matt Greene (upper body) were out for Los Angeles. ... The Kings are in Winnipeg to face the Jets on Tuesday. The Oilers also return to action that night in Minnesota against the Wild. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:33:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:35:46.280+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
