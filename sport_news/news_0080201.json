Royals rally with 5-run 8th inning, ALDS tied with Astros \nHouston relievers for the most part pitch to contact, and they got plenty of that in that fateful eighth, when Will Harris and Tony Sipp combined to yield five singles in a row to start the inning. What seemed like a secure 6-2 lead was suddenly jeopardized, and shortstop Carlos Correa’s error on a bouncer deflected by Sipp allowed the tying run to score. The go-ahead run came in on a groundout off Gregerson. \nSuch results are the chance a team takes with a bullpen lacking overpowering arms, and the last two innings of Game 4 presented a study in contrasts. \nMoments after Houston’s three top relievers were blowing the four-run lead, Royals closer Wade Davis was blowing away the Astros. He needed seven pitches to throw a critical shutdown inning in the bottom half of the eighth and struck out three in a six-out save. \nAstros relievers actually averaged slightly more strikeouts per inning than the Royals’ during the season – 1.01 to .931 – but in the postseason, when hitters bear down and don’t give away at-bats, the value of high-octane gas increases. \nAmong AL relievers with at least 50 innings pitched, the Royals’ Kelvin Herrera ranked No. 1 with an average fastball velocity of 97.2 mph, while Davis was two spots back at 95.8. Ryan Madson also checked in among the top 15 at 94.3. \nHarris (92.2 mph), Sipp (90.9) and Gregerson (89.1) lagged quite a bit behind. \n“If you have strikeout pitchers, it’s a little bit different,’’ Astros pitching coach Brent Strom told the Houston Chronicle in September, when the club’s bullpen had the worst ERA in the league. “We strike out our share, but when you’ve got these guys that have good contact skills, a groundball one way or the other, any time a ball is hit, you’re at the whim of the angles.’’ \nThe inability to get a key strikeout was best exemplified by Drew Butera’s at-bat against Gregerson, a sinker-slider specialist. Butera, who came in as a late-inning substitute for catcher Salvador Perez, had never before stepped up to the plate in the postseason, and he has a career .185 batting average in parts of six seasons. \nWith runners on second and third and one out, the situation called for a strikeout, or at least a popup, but Butera coaxed a 10-pitch walk out of Gregerson. Alex Gordon followed with a grounder snagged by diving second baseman Jose Altuve, who got the out at first as the go-ahead run scored. Had Gregerson retired Butera without the runners advancing, Gordon’s groundout would have ended the inning. \n“I’ll take my chances with six outs left with Harris, Sipp and Gregerson,’’ Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. “It just didn’t work out today.’’ \nHinch has no choice but to take his chances with them. The Astros pursued free-agent lefty Andrew Miller in the offseason, but he opted for the New York Yankees and had an outstanding season as their closer. Houston also looked into acquiring established closers Aroldis Chapman and Craig Kimbrel at the trade deadline but, ahem, struck out. \nThe Astros bullpen did make major headway this season, a prime reason for their turnaround from a 92-loss club in 2014 to playoff participants this year. The relievers’ ERA, a major league-worst 4.80 in 2014, plummeted to 3.27, fourth-best in the AL, while the number of saves jumped from 31 to 39. The free-agent additions of Gregerson and submariner Pat Neshek, along with Harris’ breakout season at 30, factored heavily in the improvement. \nGALLERY: ASTROS vs. ROYALS A link has been posted to your Facebook feed.
