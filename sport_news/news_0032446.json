Rachel’s hitting percentage passed Elyse Chubb’s previous record of .800, which she set against The Citadel on Nov. 8, 2011. Rachel posted 15 kills in the match, two shy of her personal high of 17 set in the team’s season opener against Colgate. On the season, the Louisville, Ky., native is fourth on the team with 104 kills and 106 digs. Despite recording just 12 kills in the first set, CofC (10-8, 2-2 CAA) took advantage of a strong presence at the net as well as several Elon miscues. Eight Phoenix attacking error coupled with a pair of service errors aided the Cougars early in the set. With the score tied at 9-all, a kill by Krissy Mummey spurred a 10-2 run to give the Cougars a 19-11 lead. Kayla Tronick picked up kills to earn two of the last three points in the set for CofC. The Cougars trailed most of the second set and by as many as four at 17-13, but the College scored five straight and seven of the next eight points to take a 20-18 advantage. It wasn’t enough, however, as Elon (3-15, 0-5) rolled off seven of the final eight to claim the set, 25-21. The College came out of the break hot, jumping out to a 12-4 lead in the third set, but Elon clawed it way back into the set. With the score 21-14, the Phoenix landed the next five points to close the gap to 21-19. Kennedy Madison posted a kill to ignite a 4-1 run to end the set. Rachel, who entered the match in the set, recorded seven kills in the frame alone. Melissa Morello finished the match with 11 kills and 16 digs, her fourth consecutive double-double. She has also posted double-digit kills in 16-of-18 games times this season. Britney Vallez had 26 digs while Allison Beckman ended with 40 assists.
