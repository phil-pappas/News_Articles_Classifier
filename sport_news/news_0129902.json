(Photo: Milwaukee Bucks/Lucian McAfee) \nMILWAUKEE â€” The Milwaukee Bucks say they'll be the first NBA team to use an alternate court design and jerseys, building on their \"Fear the Deer\" motto. \nThe alternate court will be used for four games this season, when players also will wear a new alternate uniform. The different looks were unveiled Saturday on the team's website. \nThe alternate floor will feature a Bucks logo at center court without the team's name. The team says the look would set a \"simple, aggressive tone.\" \nThe alternate jersey has the Bucks' fierce-looking deer logo against a black backdrop. The new looks will debut for the Dec. 9 game against the Los Angeles Clippers. \nThe Milwaukee Bucks'\"Fear the Deer\" court.
