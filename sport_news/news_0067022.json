(Tim Rupli) more > By Tim Rupli — Special to The Washington Times -   \nAnglers descend on Ocean City, Maryland, every August for the White Marlin Open. \nNow the No. 1 bill fish tournament in the world, the 2015 event produced over $3.9 million in prize money, including over $1 million for the heaviest white marlin, a 94-pounder. The winning fish was caught by Backlash, captained by Steve Richardson, with Cheryl McLeskey on the rod. \nNo invitation is needed to fish the white marlin. It’s the ultimate wide-open competition in the most exciting blue-water team sport. \nTo the uninitiated, bill fishing may appear inaccessible. Multimillion-dollar boats and expensive charters follow the pelagic migration and tournament trail, creating the appearance of a sport for the ultra-rich only. \nHowever, it’s not uncommon to see fishing teams in 26-foot center console skiffs trolling along side elite sportfishing yachts such as the Viking 80 captained by Ryan Higgins, winner of the Mid-Atlantic Cup in the long-standing match between the Ocean City and Cape May Marlin Clubs. \nThe mid-Atlantic offshore canyons stretching from Cape May, New Jersey, to Norfolk, Virginia, can produce an incredible white marlin bite. One such day produced more than 50 marlins caught and released by Ocean City-based bill fisher, a 61-foot Spencer captained by world-class marlin fisherman John Duffy. \nAfter the local bite, tournament-rigged boats like Contango, a 53-foot Jarrett Bay captained by Daryl Brower, head south to follow these highly migratory pelagics. \nI had the opportunity to join avid marlin fisherman John Kirlin for three unforgettable days on Contango with Ocean City-based mates Mario Kim and Aaron Rosenberg, who taught me to hook and catch blue marlins on stand up, light tackle. \nThe three-day trip netted six blue marlins — all caught and released — with another half dozen or more slashing through our baits only to be whiffed by yours truly. \nYes, marlin fishing can be expensive. Runs of up to 100 miles off shore are common. The big, fast boats with state-of-the-art electronics and tackle, and elite captain and crew, win most tournaments. \nHowever, many great fishermen started chasing marlins in skiffs so small they had to carry supplemental fuel bladders in the cockpit for the run back home. Full fuel bladders make for a great bed for an angler to nap halfway out before taking the helm from his fishing partner for the final hours run. It’s also a trip that gives real meaning to the “no smoking” sign. \nTournament angling, where only the biggest fish are gaffed and weighed dockside, is responsible for a tiny fraction of the recreational bill fish catch. The vast majority of offshore anglers strive to release marlins and sailfish unharmed, keeping only those few which are severely injured during a long fight. \nBluefin tuna and swordfish compete with marlins for ever-moving schools of baitfish, providing the ultimate gourmet meal for 100 of the lucky angler’s new best friends. \nBill fishing is the ultimate team sport. Captain, mates, and anglers must work together and trust each other to do their job. A successful fishing team must remain in sync often through uninterrupted hours and even days of non stop trolling. \nWith hours upon hours hunting for game fish in seas ranging from flat calm to gut-churning, the team must remain ever alert for the flash of a bill which could produce the grander, a 1,000-plus-pound marlin which is the hole-in-one of bill fishing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:42:56.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
