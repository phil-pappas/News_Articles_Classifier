But way before everyone walked around with a camera, Tom Duffy documented the life of his son, Matt, in thousands of pictures, some five dozen of which have just been posted at www.theplayerstribune.com . \nThe first picture of Matt Duffy, now the Giants' third baseman, came in the delivery room, when Cathy Duffy, told that she was the mother of a son, said as her husband clicked away, ``You know what this means, dad ... Little League.'' \nAnd the big leagues, too. Tom Duffy had a chance this year to photograph his son from the up-close-and-personal confines of the photographer's well at AT&T Park. \n``It's been a long journey,'' Tom Duffy told us Wednesday. ``It's the ultimate labor of love.''
