But ESPN has not heard the last of Bill Simmons.\nThe founder of Grantland and longtime ESPN columnist criticized his former employer’s coverage of the NFL and Deflategate as he launched his new podcast. In the second of two episodes of “The Bill Simmons Podcast” released Thursday, Simmons said it was “embarrassing” how ESPN’s coverage of the months-long scandal involving his favorite football team, the New England Patriots, and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stacked up against the work of other media outlets who don’t have a reported $15.2 billion broadcast with the league in 2011.\n“Granted, I’m a little biased here from what my experiences were the last two years at ESPN,” he said. “The way everyone else was covering Goodell’s role in this whole story versus the way ESPN covered it, it was embarrassing. And I couldn’t believe nobody called out ESPN about it, because you had Dan Wetzel at Yahoo, you had Sally Jenkins at the Washington Post , you had all the people in Boston, you had different radio personalities, and people really going after how the NFL was handling this, how Goodell was handling this, all this stuff. And especially in the weeks after the broken cell phone thing, when it came out that they had obviously leaked stuff, that something really legitimately shady was going on, and yet if you went to ESPN you didn’t see anything. Charlie Pierce on Grantland was the only person who went after them. On ESPN, they didn’t really do anything until that giant Don Van Natta and Seth Wickersham’s Outside The Lines investigation.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below “It’s hard to come away from that and not think that ESPN is in the bag for the NFL—because they were.”\nSimmons was critical of the NFL and Goodell during his 15 years with ESPN, notably in the final months of his tenure. In September 2014, the columnist formerly known as “The Boston Sports Guy” called Goodell a “liar” while discussing the Ray Rice domestic violence scandal during an episode of his “B.S. Report.” In addition to critizing Goodell during that podcast, Simmons dared his bosses to punish him for his remarks.\n“I really hope somebody calls me or emails me and says I’m in trouble for anything I say about Roger Goodell,” Simmons said, via Sports Illustrated . “Because if one person says that to me, I’m going public. You leave me alone. The commissioner’s a liar and I get to talk about that on my podcast ... Please, call me, and say I’m in trouble. I dare you.”\nESPN suspended Simmons for three weeks following those comments.\nIn May 2015, Simmons discussed Deflategate during an appearance on “The Dan Patrick Show” and said that Goodell didn’t have “ the testicular fortitude to do anything until he gauges the public reaction.”\nA day later, ESPN president John Skipper announced that Simmons’s contract wouldn’t be renewed when it expired at the end of September. In July, HBO announced a multi-year, multi-platform deal to be Simmons’s television home beginning in October.\nIn his podcast return on Thursday, Simmons was especially critical of the work of former colleagues Mike Golic and Mike Greenberg. This isn’t the first time that Simmons has clashed with the “Mike & Mike” radio program. Just three weeks after returning from his September 2014 suspension, Simmons feuded with the hosts after Golic took issue with comments he made about LeBron James on another ESPN Radio show.\n“I thought it was hilarious when [NFL Commissioner] Roger [Goodell] finally decided to give his interview and it was with Mike [Greenberg] and Mike [Golic] ... Whoa, buckle up, put some shoulder pads on Roger,” Simmons said, as his guest laughed. “This one’s going to get rough.”", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/09/sports/football/espn-extends-deal-with-nfl-for-15-billion.html", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2015/05/bill-simmons-fired-espn-contract-roger-goodell-dan-patrick-liar-video", "https://twitter.com/BillSimmons/status/649495997358313472", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/09/espn-bill-simmons-profane-rant-roger-goodell", "http://www.si.com/nfl/2014/09/24/espn-bill-simmons-roger-goodell-suspension", "http://grantland.com/", "http://ftw.usatoday.com/2014/11/bill-simmons-twitter-mike-golic-espn-suspension"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:21:43.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
