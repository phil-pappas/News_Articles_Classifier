The Patriots had scored at least 28 in each game this year averaging 422.4 yards, second to only San Diego. New England’s 325.2 passing yards per game were also second behind the Chargers.\nBut Sunday, the Pats were often their own worst enemies with 11 dropped passes, including six by just activated Brandon LaFell. Brady was slow getting untracked, overthrowing Rob Gronkowski, tossing a couple other passes at the feet of receivers.\nBut after three shaky quarters, Brady completed 13 of 16 passes for 135 yards in the final quarter to overcome a 20-16 lead.\nUntil then, the Pats looked vulnerable and uncharacteristically inefficient.\n“It wasn’t great execution from us most of the game,” admitted Brady. “They have a good defence. They rush well, have really good guys in coverage ... well coached.”\nAnd, with Ryan Fitzpatrick managing the game for the Jets it seemed they’d have a chance at the biggest upset of the season.\nThe Pats have now won eight of the past nine against the Jets and Brady is 22-7 against them, but that this one did not come easily was not unexpected. The previous four games had been decided by three or fewer points.\n“We’ve had a lot of close games with them over the years,” Brady said. “A lot of situational football has come into play, a lot of two-minute drives and stopping them at the end, overtime games. Not too many games have really gotten out of hand.”\nWith balls slipping through his receivers’ hands at a perplexing rate, it looked like this one might do precisely that — in favour of New York.\nThe Jets dominated the first half everywhere except the scoreboard where they trailed 13-10.\nThe Jets’ opening drive was worthy of the blooper segment on America’s Funniest Videos. Running back Chris Ivory lost three yards on the first play, then Fitzpatrick fumbled trying to escape the pocket.\nThe Big Oops by the Jets’ offence was followed by a big defensive stand limiting the Pats to a field goal.\nAnd, suddenly Fitzpatrick turned into a ball-control freak. Two long, clock-chewing drives gave the Jets a 10-3 lead with Brady impatiently stalking along the sideline. The go-ahead TD came when Jeremy Kerley caught a slant pass, on a 14-play series.\nAnd, while New England scrambled back on a one-yard sneak from Brady to take the lead at halftime, they were decidedly unBrady. Sloppy. And, they simply gave up the run game against the Jets, handing the ball off only five times while Brady was 34 of 54 for 355 yards.\nFitzpatrick actually had a better quarterback rating than Brady.\nA drop by slot receiver Julian Edelman in the third quarter limited the Pats to a field goal, and that looked costly when Fitzpatrick drove 13 plays and hit Ivory with a TD pass for a 17-16 lead.\nSo the butter fingered Patriots trailed for the first time this season heading into the fourth quarter. Brady got animated on the sideline.\nThe turning point with just more than five minutes to play came when Brady converted a third and 17, hitting Edelman in the middle of the field.\n“Jules made a real smart play,” said Brady. “There were a lot of plays that weren’t exactly how we drew them up. But I was glad to make some of those key plays when we needed them.”\nSuddenly, he couldn’t miss; three passes to Gronkowski, and Danny Amendola made a spectacular diving catch across the goal line for a 23-20 lead.\nThey never trailed again.\nGronkowski’s TD catch capped the comeback. And, the Jets, who began the game with a braincramp, ended it with one. After recovering an onside kick in a desperate bid to drive for the tying TD, Jets wideout Brandon Marshall was caught for a penalty — and Todd Bowles’ Jets looked on helplessly as the final seconds — and a chance for a share of the AFC division lead — ticked away.\nTEXAS ARMAGEDDON\nSunday, the misery just kept piling on for the Texans.\nBad: The 41-0 deficit at halftime was their worst ever.\nBadder: Quarterback Ryan Mallett keeps pulling a Where’s Waldo routine.\nThis time the quarterback missed Saturday’s team charter to Miami. The reluctant backup to Brian Hoyer did show up but only after having to take a commercial flight.\n“You’ve got to be on time,” Mallett said. “That’s not the leadership role I need to exhibit. I need to be better.”\nEarlier this year he seemed in a snit, disappearing from practice for a day, after losing the No. 1 job to Hoyer in training camp. He got the job back in Week 1, then lost it again in Week 5 and didn’t look happy, even leaving the bench early at halftime.\nBaddest: Arian Foster left Sunday’s game with a reported Achilles injury.\nQUICK HITS\nBrady became the fifth player in history to surpass 55,000 career yards passing ...The Saints have scored TDs in 152 straight games, second-longest streak in NFL history. The longest streak is 166, held by the Browns from 1957-69 ... Jadeveon Clowney, the first-overall pick of the 2014 NFL Draft, registered his first NFL sack yesterday ... The Dolphins had been 0-7 previously against Houston, the only team they had never beaten ... The Miami Dolphins have scored 82 under Dan Campbell, the most in two games for an interim head coach since 1961.\nPETERSON MAKES LIONS FEEL ILL\nAdrian Peterson said it was the shrimp that made him sick.\nEarlier reports, said it was the tobacco chew he swallowed that made him ill Saturday.\nEither way, it was the Lions who were feeling ill after Peterson and the Vikings got done with them Sunday.\nTeddy Bridgewater had one of his best games at quarterback and Peterson rushed for 98 yards on 19 carries as the Vikings (4-2) won an NFC North game on the road for the first time in three years.\nIn losing 28-19, the Lions defence had another rough day and quarterback Matt Stafford was harassed and hurried while being sacked seven times.\nPeterson became sick on Saturday after reportedly swallowing chewing tobacco juice during a turbulent flight on the team’s charter.\nPeterson said after the win he was blaming the shrimp he ate for vomiting upon the team’s arrival in Detroit.\nSunday, the only ones who felt like vomiting were Lions’ fans, who saw Stafford throw TD passes to Calvin Johnson and Eric Ebron, only to see the offence shut down after that by a Vikings defence that is shaping up to be one of the NFL’s best.\n“They got the job done for us,” Peterson said, of a defence that was ranked second in the NFL coming into Sunday, allowing only 16.6 points a game.\n“That’s why it’s called a team.”\nDOLPHINS 'HAVE AWOKEN'\nThe Miami Dolphins have a tough road ahead but at least on they’re back on the road again.\nAfter a tumultuous start to the season, the Dolphins Sunday won their second in a row under the intense gaze of new coach Dan Campbell.\nThe Dolphins battered Houston 44-26, building a 41-0 halftime lead behind quarterback Ryan Tannehill who was in total command, completing his first 18 passes and throwing for four TDs in the first 16 minutes.\nThis was football blitzkrieg. The Dolphins have gone from chronic under-achievers to a hit squad with killer instincts.\nMiami is in tough in a division with the Jets and the unbeaten Patriots, and they have a difficult schedule with three consecutive road games at New England, Buffalo and Philadelphia.\nBut they have run up 82 points the past two weeks and finally look like a team with some ambition.\n“The sleeping giants,” Dolphins owner Stephen Ross said, “have awoken.”\nMiami became the first team in at least 75 years to score four offensive touchdowns of at least 50 yards in a half, according to STATS. Tannehill extended his two-game streak to 25 consecutive completions, an NFL record, before he threw his only incompletion in the fourth quarter.\nHELL-RAISING WIN\nJay Gruden raised a little hell.\nAnd, Kirk Cousins ended up feeling heavenly.\nThe Redskins head coach ripped a verbal strip off his team Sunday after they fell behind by 24 points to the Tampa Bay Bucs at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland.\n“Everybody was pretty upset. Jay was livid,” left tackle Trent Williams said about the halftime locker-room outburst.\n“You rarely every see him in that state. But he was on the gas.”\nCousins got his foot to the pedal, too, throwing three second-half TDs, including the go-ahead score to Jordan Reed with 24 seconds left, for a 31-30 win and the largest comeback in franchise history.\n“It was a good lesson: Just keep playing and you never know what can happen,” said Cousins, who may have saved his starting quarterback job.\nEven before the game, Cousins has been under severe scrutiny.\nCousins finished 33 for 40 for 317 yards, and most importantly zero interceptions.\nTrailing 30-24, Washington got the ball at its 20 with a little less than 2 1/2 minutes and Cousins threw on every play, hitting Reed on a six-yard slant for the winning points.\n“I’m pretty sure there are fans, that probably were thinking, like, ‘Here we go again. Something bad’s going to happen,” defensive tackle Terrance Knighton said. “But everyone on the sideline had the confidence that we were going to score and win the game.”\nHARD LUCK CONTINUES\nLast week the Colts tricked themselves out of any chance to beat the Patriots.\nSunday, they self-destructed early.\nAndrew Luck threw two first-half interceptions, Griff Whalen lost a fumble and the special teams followed up last week’s disaster by allowing New Orleans to convert a fake field goal.\nThat allowed the Saints to build a 27-point lead, which was just enough to escape a second-half rally as a Drew Brees won a battle of classic quarterbacks with Luck, 27-21.\nBrees threw for 255 yards and one touchdown and got plenty of help from his ground game as Mark Ingram rushed for 143 yards and one score and Khiry Robinson had two TD runs.\nThe Saints are suddenly showing some life, rebounding from three consecutive losses to start the season to revive their playoff hopes.\nFor the Colts, this was classic ugly. Luck, who returned last week from an injured throwing shoulder, looked brutal, starting the game with five straight incompletions, and was loudly booed as the team walked to the locker room at halftime.\nIt took almost 17 minutes for the Colts to pick up a first down, Luck watched the Saints run 18 out of 19 plays during one stretch and then threw away Indy’s first scoring chance when he was picked off by Kyle Wilson in the end zone.\nThree TD passes in the second half brought some cheer, but Indy is 3-4, which is about as ugly a record as any first-place team in a division can ever claim.\nNFL\nPatriots offence wins with late surge over nasty Jets 'D'\nBy Bill Lankhof , Toronto Sun First posted: Sunday, October 25, 2015 11:11 PM EDT | Updated: Sunday, October 25, 2015 11:16 PM EDT\nThe New England Patriots were far from perfect Sunday.\nThey dropped passes.\nThey had no ground game.\nThey trailed for the first time this season heading into the fourth quarter.\nThe Jets had them on the hook.\nBut, somehow, Tom Brady found an escape route, rallying New England for a 30-23 win.\nSo, an imperfect afternoon still translates into a perfect 6-0 record; the surprising Jets falling just short in a chance to snatch a piece of first place.\nThis was a game featuring the NFL’s highest-scoring offence vs. a New York defence, ranked No. 1 over-all.
