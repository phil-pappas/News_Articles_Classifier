In the stem cell arena, he and his colleagues have published more than 20 articles on Multiple Sclerosis, Spinal Cord Injury, Heart Failure, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, Autism, and Charcot Marie Tooth Syndrome. In 2007, Dr. Riordan’s research team was the first to discover and document the existence of mesenchymal-like stem cells in menstrual blood. For this discovery, his team was honored with the “Medical Article of the Year Award” from Biomed Central. Other notable journals in which Dr. Riordan has published articles include the British Journal of Cancer, Cellular Immunology, Journal of Immunotherapy, and Translational Medicine.\nDr. Riordan is an accomplished inventor; listed on more the 25 patent families, including 11 issued patents. He is credited with a number of novel discoveries in the field of cancer research since the mid-1990s when he collaborated with his father Dr. Hugh Riordan on the effects of high-dose intravenous vitamin C on cancer cells and the tumor microenvironment. This pioneering study on vitamin C’s preferential toxicity to cancer cells notably led to a 1997 patent grant for the treatment of cancer with vitamin C. In 2010, Dr. Riordan received another patent for a new cellular cancer vaccine.\nUnder the umbrella of Medistem Panama subsidiary Translational Biosciences, Medistem Panama and Stem Cell Institute are currently conducting IRB-approved clinical trials in Panama for autism, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis and spinal cord injury using human umbilical cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells.\nThis event is sold out.\nAbout Riordan-McKenna Institute (RMI)\nRMI specializes in non-surgical treatment of acute and chronic orthopedic conditions using *AlphaGEMS flowable amniotic tissue allograft and bone marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) that is harvested using the BioMAC (Pat. Pend.) bone marrow aspiration cannula. Common conditions treated include meniscal tears, ACL injuries, rotator cuff injuries, runner’s knee, tennis elbow, and joint pain due to degenerative conditions like osteoarthritis. RMI also uses AlphaPATCH amniotic membranes as part of a complete wound care treatment regimen.\nRMI also augments orthopedic surgeries with BMAC and AlphaGEMS to promote better post-surgical outcomes.\nBMAC contains a patient’s own mesenchymal stem cells (MSC,) hematopoietic stem cells (CD34+), growth factors and other progenitor cells. AlphaGEMS is composed of collagens and other structural proteins, which provide a biologic matrix that supports angiogenesis, tissue growth and new collagen during tissue regeneration and repair.\n*Amniotic Therapies Inc. produces AlphaGEMS and AlphaPATCH products from donated amniotic tissue after normal healthy births.

In close collaboration with universities and physicians world-wide, our comprehensive stem cell treatment protocols employ well-targeted combinations of autologous bone marrow stem cells, autologous adipose stem cells, and donor human umbilical cord stem cells to treat: autism, cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, heart disease, and autoimmune diseases.\nIn partnership with Translational Biosciences, a subsidiary of Medistem Panama, SCI provides clinical services for ongoing clinical trials that are assessing safety and signs of efficacy for autism, multiple sclerosis, osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and spinal cord injury using allogeneic umbilical cord tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hUC-MSC) and hU-MSC-derived mesenchymal trophic factors (MTF). In 2016, Translation Biosciences plans to expand its clinical trial portfolio to include heart disease and cerebral palsy.\nFor more information on stem cell therapy:\nStem Cell Institute Website: https://www.cellmedicine.com\nStem Cell Institute\nVia Israel & Calle 66\nPlaza Pacific Office #2A\nPanama City, Panama\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13009986.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.rmiclinic.com/non-surgical-stem-cell-injections-joint-pain/stemnexa-protocol/", "http://www.stem-kine.com/", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13009986.htm"], "published": "2015-10-08T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T04:01:29.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
