If both sides have the same result, Slovakia will qualify automatically based on their head-to-head results. \nIn Group E, already-qualified England maintained their 100 percent record with a 2-0 win over Estonia. \nTheo Walcott beat the offside trap to finish from close range for England just before half-time. \nRaheem Sterling made it 2-0 with a goal in the 85th minute. \nSwitzerland also completed their qualification with a 7-0 win at home to San Marino that included three penalties. \nSeven different players found the net for Switzerland, with Michael Lang, Gokhan Inler, Admir Mehmedi, Johan Djourou, Pajtim Kasami, Breel Embolo and Eren Derdiyok on target. \nSwitzerland's qualification was not sealed until Slovenia conceded a late equaliser in Lithuania and could not find a winner following a floodlight failure. \nValter Birsa's penalty opened the scoring, but Lithuania's Arvydas Novikovas equalised four minutes from time to put Slovenia's hopes of even a playoff place in danger after the 1-1 draw. \nIn Group G, Russia stayed in good position to qualify with a 2-1 win in Moldova. \nSergei Ignashevich made the breakthrough in the 58th minute and Artem Dzyuba doubled the advantage 20 minutes later. \nRussia stayed in second place, two points ahead of Sweden who won 2-0 in Liechtenstein thanks to goals by Martin Berg and Zlatan Ibrahimovic, who also missed a penalty. \nSweden are assured of at least a playoff spot after Montenegro lost 3-2 to Austria, who have already qualified. \nMarko Arnautovic's 81st-minute equaliser and -- after Mirko Vucinic was sent off -- a stoppage-time winner by Marcel Sabitzer ended Montenegro's campaign. A win would have kept their hopes of a playoff spot alive. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
