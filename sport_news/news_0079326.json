The Sonora Wildcats stayed perfect in the Mother Lode League Tuesday with a 3-0 (25-10, 25-4, 25-8) volley victory over Tuolumne County neighbor Summerville in Bud Castle Gym. With three games remaining in the regular season, the Wildcats lead the MLL by two games over Bret Harte. Sonora did well in an upper division tournament Saturday finishing third in the Stockton Classic. The Wildcats beat Inderkum 2-0, Enochs 2-1 before losing to Lowell of San Francisco 2-1 in the semifinals. They bounced back to top Granite Bay 2-1 to take third place.“The girls played really well in Stockton on Saturday and you could definitely see that it carried over tonight,” said Wildcat head coach Kim Evans. “Granite Bay has some big players on their team and it was a very high pressure win, which is exactly what we needed right now. We are focused on each match as they come and want to play to our potential all of the time and I feel we did that against Summerville.” Sonora’s Kelsie Evans smacked a match-high nine kills and also had three assisted blocks and one solo and also served for a pair of aces. Also for the Wildcats (24-3, 9-0 MLL), Riley Patterson had eight kills and 11 digs, Kiana Pisula had 29 assists and three assisted blocks, Riley Henington had a match-high 13 digs and Grace Hernandez had seven kills and had two assisted blocks. For Summerville (3-5 MLL), Sarah Boyer had four kills and nine digs, Grace Fulkerson had three kills, Julian Craddock had six assists and Clare Caldera served 5 for 6 with an ace. The Wildcats next play Thursday at Linden and the Bears host Amador.
