That meager force will do nothing to change the plans of the Taliban to take over the country.\nAnd, of course, it will leave the carnage for the next president to deal with.\nBottom line is: President Obama will have handed over the Middle East, Pakistan and Afghanistan to Iran, Russia, ISIS, al-Qaida and the Taliban to spread terrorism throughout the world, including to America. That will be President Obama’s “commander in coward” legacy.\nDaniel B. Jeffs\nApple Valley\nLiberals never learn\nRe: “Takano triggers debate on wages” [News, Oct. 22]: When are people like Congressman Mark Takano going to get off the backs of business?\nThey have seen what happened in Seattle. Those who started getting a $15 hourly minimum wage wanted less hours, because it started making them lose benefits. The liberals have bred a bunch of takers. Instead of giving handouts, how about hand-ups?\nIf they want decent wages, then go to a trade school, and learn something that pays well. And, maybe if e-Verify was implemented, Americans could be put back to work. We see the false unemployment numbers and the stagnant and low wages.\nI will ask again: When have the Democrats done anything to make California better and not a welfare state? They just tax and regulate. The whole state is becoming Detroit.\nJohn W. Burns\nFontana\nWRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Letters to the Editor: E-mail to letters@pe.com .
