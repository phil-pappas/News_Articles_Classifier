(Photo: John E. Sokolowski USA TODAY Sports) \nAfter thinking it over for a week, Daniel Cleary has reconsidered and decided to report to the Detroit Red Wings' top farm club. \nThe veteran forward told the Free Press this afternoon that he will join the AHL's Grand Rapids Griffins on Tuesday. \n\"We have future Red Wings there, good players, and I want to be a good pro and a mentor to them,\" Cleary said. \nCleary had hoped to make the Wings, but that endeavor ended when he was waived Oct. 8. After clearing waivers the next day, the Wings assigned him to the minors. Cleary initially said he would not report . \nThat changed in the days following a Monday meeting with general manager Ken Holland and head coach Jeff Blashill. \n\"We talked about what I wanted to do, how I feel,\" Cleary said. \"I took some time to think about things, and this is the position I came to. \n\"I have a lot of passion for the game. I love being a Red Wing. I loved playing in Detroit.\" \nThe Wings were not planning on suspending Cleary and were going to pay him the $950,000 on his one-year deal. The money does not count against Detroit's salary cap. \nCleary has played 938 NHL games with Chicago, Edmonton, Phoenix and Detroit. He was a former first-round draft pick looking for a foothold when he came to Detroit on a tryout in 2005. He turned that piece of paper into a 10-year stay, along the way becoming a favorite of teammates and helping the Wings win a Stanley Cup in 2008. \nNow 36, Cleary is looking at a different role. \n\"I want to teach the young players what it means to be a good pro,\" Cleary said. \nAsked whether he would redo the summer of 2013, when he turned down multiyear offers from the Wings prior to July 1, only to end up coming back just as training camp began, Cleary said, \"It is easy to look back, but I made a decision with my heart, and I have to stand by that decision.\" \nCleary was brought back in September 2013, at the urging of then-coach Mike Babcock and numerous team veterans, including captain Henrik Zetterberg. At the time, Cleary had been an impact playoff player the previous spring (with 10 points in 14 games) and was among the leadership group in the locker room. \nBecause the Wings felt obligated to make up some of the $8.25 million over three years that Cleary turned down from the Philadelphia Flyers, he was re-signed twice, even as his on-ice contributions heavily declined. \nCleary said his wife and daughters will remain in the Detroit area while he is with Grand Rapids. \nPersonnel update: Defenseman Alexey Marchenko was assigned to the minors in expectation of the Saturday return of Danny DeKeyser. \nContact Helene St. James: hstjames@freepress.com.
