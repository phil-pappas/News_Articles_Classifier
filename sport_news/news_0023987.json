Cox/Getty Images US Soccer is returning to the Alamodome for the second time in 2015, as they bring the US Women’s National Team Victory Tour to the Alamo City. US Soccer announced on Friday that the US Women will play host to Trinidad and Tobago at the Alamodome on Saturday December 10th.\nThe announcement allays fears that US Soccer would not return to San Antonio after the horrific pitch for the Men’s National Team match against Mexico in March at the same venue. It will be the third visit to San Antonio for the US Women’s National Team after a game against Australia in 2013 and a 1996 match against Sweden at Blossom.\nThe US Women’s team are currently undefeated in Texas, and should have no troubles continuing that record against Trinidad and Tobago. Both sides will be using this match as preparation for the CONCACAF Olympic qualification tournament being held completely in Texas.\nWhile fans in Texas will be familiar with the USA ’s recent history, winning the World Cup, they may be less familiar with Trinidad and Tobago. But they should certainly know the Trinidad and Tobago coach, Randy Waldrum, who coaches Houston Dash in the NWSL.\nTrinidad and Tobago went agonizingly close to qualifying for the 2015 FIFA Women’s World Cup, finishing fourth in the CONCACAF Qualifiers. That pushed Trinidad and Tobago to a playoff for qualification, which they lost to Ecuador.\nIt has been a great decent run for Trinidad and Tobago and they will be hoping for continued growth in 2015, with the Olympic qualifiers in early 2016. For Trinidad and Tobago matches against teams like the United States will continue to help the side grow in to a future force in CONCACAF, they are certainly close and come the 2019 Women’s World Cup in France, could well be qualified for their first major tournament.", "external_links": ["http://www.socawarriors.net/"], "published": "2015-10-19T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:17:36.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
