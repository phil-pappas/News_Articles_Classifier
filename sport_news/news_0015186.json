He then got the chance to be a Parkland boys assistant under former coach Chris Bleam, the area's all-time leader in boys coaching wins before he resigned to coach club ball exclusively.\nThrough Chris Bleam, he became connected to Kelly Bleam, Chris' wife and the head girls coach at Northwestern. He assisted the Northwestern girls for a stretch.\nBut he then got a job teaching engineering at Palisades and soon became Joy Wolf's assistant there.\n\"I was always the assistant,\" he said. \"Always trying to learn.\"\nWhen Wolf resigned three years ago, Willman stepped in and finally became a head coach.\nIn his second season, things are starting to fall into place. Palisades (11-3-2) is not only in a good position in the District 11 Class 2A seeding picture, but it also has an excellent chance to make the Colonial League playoffs. The Pirates are currently in the fourth spot and can claim it if they beat Saucon Valley or Southern Lehigh beats Salisbury in Thursday's last Colonial League game.\nThis scenario was made possible because Willman's Pirates engineered a 2-0 win over Northwestern — Willman's one-time employer — last week.\n\"It's good knowing you're able to compete with the top teams in the league, especially Northwestern,\" he said. \"We're trying to get into the league and prepare for the district. I always tell the girls you have to play the best soccer you can by the end of the season. I think the girls are doing that. I hope it wasn't a fluke or a one-time thing.\"\nIt probably is not. Palisades has been a regular winner the last several years, including a league title in 2012, and taps into the rich Bucks County talent base.\nThis year sophomore Kayla Reed leads a talented offense and senior Ally Badman directs an improving defense.\nHe sees his time with both Bleams as valuable.\n\"Obviously they're two of the best coaches in the area,\" he said. \"Soaking everything up from those two is quite an experience.\"\nWillman said a close loss to Northwestnern last year helped changed the attitudes of the players.\n\"Then the girls understood what my expectations were, the way I wanted them to play defense,\" he said. \"I also think it was the seniors stepping up and taking a lot of leadership. They held themselves and their teammates accountable.\"\nThree on the rise\nPaige Jones, Saucon Valley — Scored 50th career goal in win over Freedom.\nLauren Binn, Saucon Valley — School's all-time leader in points with 212.\nCailyn Meikrantz, Salisbury — Became Salisbury's all-time leader in assists with 38; had seven assists in 9-1 win over Palmerton.\nThe defense never rests\nSouthern Lehigh has won 10 of 11 since a 2-3 start; has outscored opponents 66-8 in that time.\nParkland aas allowed only 20 shots on goal in 15 EPC games.\nNazareth has two straight shutouts and eight overall.\nCollege crowd\nShannon McGinnis (Emmaus) of St. Francis (Pa.) was named the Northeast Conference women's soccer rookie of the week. ... Sabrina Mertz (Northwestern) has started all 13 games for Lehigh and leads the team with seven goals, three assists and 17 points. ... Mackenzie O'Brien (Moravian Academy) and Jacelin Muschlitz (Wilson) are contributing at Muhlenberg. O'Brien has three goals.\nNotes: Ivanna Jones (Whitehall) has seven goals and four assists in last four games. ... While the move to four classes for next fall will give more opportunity, it also represents an interesting development. Just 10 years ago, Emmaus played in a state title game in a one-class spring stystem. Then the spring season was two classes; then it was one class. Then all of the spring districts moved into a three-class fall system. Now, we are looking at four. One does not have to be a veteran to have seen a lof of changes.\n(Records through Monday)\nTEAM RANKINGS\n1. Parkland 15-1\n2. Pennridge 7-3-2\n3. Saucon Valley 14-1\n4. Whitehall 12-2-1\n5.
