At least it is when it comes to television ratings. The Rangers’ four-game sweep of the Houston Astros this week in Arlington averaged a relatively hardy 5.31.\n“Relatively” is the key word. The Cowboys’ four exhibition games averaged a 13.5. If you are scoring at home, the Rangers averaged 138,256 homes with first place at stake in the AL West while the Cowboys averaged 353,000 for practice games without prime-time performers.\n(Note: Sunday night’s Cowboys season opener scored a 35.9 rating, which translates into 934,728 homes.)\nOf course, we are comparing inflatable balls to hard ones.\nHere’s another way to look at it: Over the past week, the Rangers averaged a 4.2 rating for seven games. In all, they played to 765,488 homes, much closer to the Cowboys’ 934,728.\n(And so you know: radio ratings take more time to percolate.)\nBefore this week, the Rangers season’s most watched game came Aug. 17 when the Rangers topped Seattle 4-3, also in Arlington. That game earned a 5.28 rating.\nMonday’s 5-3 win over the Astros scored a milquetoast 4.4. Things started to heat up with Tuesday’s 6-5 nail-biter (5.34).\nThen came Wednesday’s 14-3 blowout (5.47), and Thursday’s 8-2 trouncing (6.04), establishing back-to-back-to-back season highs.\n(Because you must be curious: Rangers averaged 10.5 and 9.1 ratings for their consecutive AL Division Series appearances in 2010 and 2011.)\nNadel hurt, but he’s still bringing it\nRangers radio voice Eric Nadel, who missed three games with a detached retina in his left eye, is still calling in pain.\nNadel, who suffered a detached retina in his right eye during the 2009 season, says he knew something was wrong in the fourth inning last Friday. With Rangers pitcher Colby Lewis still perfect against the Oakland A’s, blurriness and pain set in.\nNadel underwent surgery Saturday afternoon, missed three games and was back at work Tuesday night.\nHe is using an eye patch intermittently and relying more than he customarily does on a TV monitor. Most difficult, he said, has been judging fly balls.\nAs for what’s happening on the field, Nadel, on the job since 1979, said he has never experienced any season quite like this.\n“There is nothing to compare this to,” he said over the phone Friday before a doctor’s appointment. “The Rangers made a big push in 1978 but didn’t quite make it.”\nThose Rangers finished 87-75, tied with the California Angels and finished five games behind the Kansas City Royals in the AL West.\nFor the record, Jon Miller and Bill Merrill called Rangers games on radio that season. Miller and Frank Glieber were the TV team. Nadel joined them on TV the next season.\nLooking ahead\nShould the Rangers win the AL West, the AL Division Series would belong to Fox. Expect some games farmed out to Fox Sports 1 and possibly MLB Network. The AL Championship Series belongs to Fox as well.\nOnly local postseason coverage comes on radio.\nThe NLDS and NLCS belong to Turner’s TBS.\nThe AL and NL wild card games will be on ESPN.\nTalking Cowboys\nTroy Aikman and Joe Buck will be on the Fox “A Team” call for Sunday’s Cowboys-Philadelphia Eagles game.\nAikman and Buck return the following Sunday when the Cowboys host the Falcons on Fox.\nThis actually may be an unprecedented start-of-the-season run for the Cowboys.\nTheir first eight games are scheduled for broadcast by the top teams at Fox, NBC and CBS.\nNBC’s Al Michaels and Cris Collinsworth, who called the opener against the Giants, will be on the call for Cowboys-New Orleans Saints. CBS’ Jim Nantz and Phil Simms work the New England Patriots-Cowboys. Aikman and Thom Brennaman, in for Buck, making his annual pilgrimage to the baseball postseason booth, will work the Cowboys-Giants and Seattle Seahawks at Cowboys. Then it’s back to Michaels-Collinsworth when the Eagles visit the Cowboys on Nov. 8.\nIn all likelihood, the streak ends the next Sunday when the Cowboys visit the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Fox.\nSunday night Cowboys love\nThe Cowboys’ 27-26 victory over the Giants was the seventh-most-watched game in NBC Sunday Night Football ’s now 10 seasons on the air. Average viewership for the game was 26.77 million viewers.\nOver the years, the Cowboys and Giants have proved the NFL’s greatest gifts to NBC. It’s a match made in ratings heaven. The Cowboys traditionally have been the NFL’s top-rated team. The Giants bring TV’s largest market to their games.\nNot coincidentally, the Cowboys’ win over the Giants was their league-leading ninth meeting since NBC’s package debuted in 2006. It also was the fourth time the teams played in the Sunday night opener.\nIn addition, the Cowboys and Giants rank first and second in appearances. It was the Cowboys’ 32nd and the Giants’ 26th. The Cowboys have appeared in 11 of the top 16 most-watched SNF games, including five against the Giants.\nHere’s the rundown:\nRk.\nGame\nDateViewers (in millions)\n1.\nCowboys at Redskins\nDec. 30, 2012\n30.28\n2.\nCowboys at Giants\nJan. 1, 2012\n27.62\n3.\nSteelers at Broncos\nSept. 9, 2012\n27.57\n4.\nEagles at Cowboys\nDec. 29, 2013\n27.30\n5.\nChiefs at Broncos\nNov. 17, 2013\n26.95\n6.\nBroncos at Colts\nOct. 20, 2013\n26.94\n7.\nGiants at Cowboys\nSept. 13, 2015\n26.77\n8.\nBroncos at Patriots\nNov. 24, 2013\n26.50\n9.\nCowboys at Jets\nSept. 11, 2011\n25.77\n10.\nEagles at Cowboys\nDec. 12, 2010\n25.73\n11.\nVikings at Packers\nOct. 24, 2010\n25.68\n12.\nGiants at Cowboys\nSept. 8, 2013\n25.40\n13.\nCowboys at Redskins\nSept. 12, 2010\n25.26\n14.\nGiants at Cowboys\nSept. 20, 2009\n24.82\n15.\nGiants at Cowboys\nDec. 11, 2011\n24.52\n16.\nCowboys at Eagles\nDec. 14, 2014\n24.25\nAround the Horn\nMark Followill and former Cowboys offensive lineman Brian Baldinger will be on the Fox Sports Southwest call of SMU-TCU at 7 p.m. Saturday. What’s with Mavericks broadcasters and college football? Chuck Cooperstein will work play-by-play of Ole Miss-Alabama on Saturday night for Westwood One radio. … HBO’s Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel returns at 9 p.m. Tuesday with a segment on “NFL’s most visible owner.” Care to guess who correspondent Bernard Goldberg will be chatting with on a tour of the owner’s under-construction practice facility.\nVerne said it\nAmong Verne Lundquist’s signature calls is one he made in the Cowboys radio booth at Super Bowl XIII in 1979. Tight end Jackie Smith dropped what appeared to be a sure touchdown pass that would have tied the score in the third quarter. The Cowboys eventually lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 35-31.\n“Bless his heart,” Lundquist told listeners. “He’s got to be the sickest man in America.”\nMaking a guest appearance in the booth for the Cowboys’ season opener Sunday night 37 seasons later, this was Lundquist’s call of another key pass to a Cowboys tight end:\n“Here’s the snap. Fumbled by Romo. Picks it up. Has a shot in the end zone. It’s caught! Jason Witten! It’s caught. How do you do! Tie game!”\nFeherty’s world\nAsked on the conference call trumpeting his switch from CBS to NBC’s golf coverage if there are other sports he might like to cover, Dallas’ David Feherty responded:\n“Well, I’m not even an expert at golf. I just play one on television, kind of like General Hospital and being a doctor. … The Olympics would be more of an opportunity where perhaps if you’re calling a sport like the bobsled or curling, whatever, you don’t have to have so much technical knowledge. Know the names and love the sport.”\nOn Twitter:\n @bhorn55", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/bhorn55"], "published": "2015-09-20T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:18:13.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
