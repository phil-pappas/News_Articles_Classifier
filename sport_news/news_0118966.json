Bill Belichick doesn’t do that. In fact, the Patriots head coach revealed Wednesday, ahead of Sunday’s huge showdown with the Indianapolis Colts, that he hasn’t been to a grocery store in some time. Here’s the text of the exchange with reporters:\nQ: I know you can’t concern yourself with the mentality of Patriots fans, but has anyone pulled you aside at the grocery store and urged you to kick Indy’s butt?\n Bill Belichick: I haven’t been to the grocery store in a couple years.\nQ: Are you hearing from friends, family, neighbors?\nBB: Have I heard from my family and friends? Yeah, sure.\nQ: I think you know what I mean.\nBB: I mean, look, it’s the same questions every week. We’re getting ready to play a game on Sunday. We’re going to do the best we can to prepare for it and be ready to go and perform well on Sunday night.
