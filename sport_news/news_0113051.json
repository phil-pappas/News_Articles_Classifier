The country boy from Alabama had the benefit of no training camp before joining what turned out to be the NFL's finest team out of Georgia Tech in 1960. \nPoor Brian Westbrook. The Villanova University star felt he was underappreciated as a pro running back — until deciding after a punt bounced in front of him in the closing minutes of what looked like a lost cause against the New York Giants in 2003 to grab the football and make a run for it. \nBoth made the most of their situations, though, and in fact landed together in the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame this evening, when will be officially inducted at halftime of the Eagles-Giants Monday Night Football clash. \nBaughan, a linebacker, played the first six seasons of his 12-year career with the Eagles, making a good-enough impression to be forever honored. \nWestbrook turned that near misplay into a punt return for a touchdown that won the game for the Eagles and turned their season around, landing them in the third of what would be four straight conference championship game appearances and, eventually the Super Bowl in 2004, his third season with the team.

(Michael Perez / AP) \nBaughan was a nine-time Pro Bowl and four-time All-Pro selection, totaling 18 interceptions and 10 fumble recoveries during his career (1960-70, '74). \nWestbrook departed after the 2009 season as the team's all-time scrimmage yards leader, after having established himself as the prototype back for coach Andy Reid's version of the West Coast offense. \nWestbrook ranks second all-time in total touches (1,734); third in rushing yards (5,995), career touchdowns (68) and receptions (426) and fourth in carries (1,308) and rushing touchdowns (37). With 20 career 100-yard rushing games (regular season and playoffs), he ranks tied for third in team history behind Wilbert Montgomery (26) and LeSean McCoy (23).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:45:08.715+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
