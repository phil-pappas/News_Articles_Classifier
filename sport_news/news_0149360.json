Competing under the International Boxing Association (AIBA) flag due to the absence of a national federation, the Indians have time and again shown a remarkable ability to be unaffected by the administrative mess and deliver results. L Devendro Singh (49kg), Madan Lal (52kg), Shiva Thapa (56kg), Manoj Kumar (64kg), Vikas Krishan (75kg) and Satish Kumar (+91kg) have made the cut, through the Asian Championships. “The boys are very confident. It is again a very tough challenge but we have prepared as much as we could have and let’s see what happens now. These boys have given fantastic results despite everything and I am hoping this would continue here too,” chief national coach Gurbax Singh Sandhu said. “If we get a good draw, it will be an added advantage for us,” he added. The World Championships will decide 23 quota places for the Olympics in the 10 weight categories and 260 boxers from 73 countries will be in fray for the coveted slots. The Indian hopes would largely rest on the proven performers such as Vikas, Shiva, Devendro and Manoj. Vikas won a bronze medal in the 2011 edition, which made him the only Indian boxer apart from Vijender to have finished on the podium at the showpiece event. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:17:43.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
