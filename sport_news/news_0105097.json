Pic Stephen Cooper\nNICK WALSHAW The Daily Telegraph DAVE Smith makes no apologies for the bullish leadership style which not only dominated his reign as NRL CEO, but which has also been blamed for ending it.\nSpeaking with The Daily Telegraph o Tuesday night, Smith defended his handling of the unfinished, and heavily criticised TV broadcasting deal, which he was hoping would settle for $1.7 billion.\nThe former Welsh banker also denied suggestions he was being forced out of his role prematurely because Fox Sports, who are yet to re-sign for the sport’s broadcast rights, were refusing to deal with him.\nAsked if Fox executives had been disrespected during negotiations, Smith replied: “At the end of the day, these are commercial negotiations.\n“And that means we have to do best by the game — not just financially but fans, grassroots, all that stuff.\n“And, no, you’d never seek to disenfranchise anybody through that process. But it’s a commercial negotiation and sometimes they can be ... sometimes they can take a bit longer and sometimes people may not necessarily feel like they won.”\nPODCAST: BUZZ ON DAVE SMITH’S DECISION TO WALK AWAY\nGONE: Smith quits as NRL CEO\nREACTION: How fans and colleague reacted to Smith announcement\nBUZZ: Eastern suburbs banker didn’t get NRL\nQuizzed on suggestions Fox executives would no longer deal with him, NRL chairman John Grant — also seated in on the interview — interjected.\nARLC Chairman John Grant with Dave Smith at NRL Central announcing he is resigning as CEO of the NRL.

And we continue to do that.\nWho should replace Dave Smith as NRL CEO? “There’s no change. It is what it is ... and it’s at the most senior level.\n“So I’m not exactly sure how it can get more constructive or more senior.”\nAnd as for his leadership style, developed in the ruthless banking realm, being too much for senior league types?\n“Of course, I’m always driven to get the right outcome for our fans,’’ Smith said. “Always.\nREPLACEMENT: Who fills Smith’s shoes?\nRESIGNATION: Smith says ‘time is right’\nTIMELINE: All the significant dates in Smith’s tenure\n“That’s my job — John’s job too. And we’ll always be forceful when it comes to protecting the interests of the game. But that’s a normal commercial negotiation.”\nDespite failing to complete the deal under his tenure, Smith also insisted the NRL would eventually sign off on a contract worthy of the “Formula One of contact sport”.\n“And if I didn’t think we were going to get a great deal, the right deal, I wouldn’t be leaving,’’ Smith said. “But we will, and I am.”\n Smith defiant on his tough approach", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e3385be6aaf223fc4447f4f09d944e59", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/dave-smith-quits-how-rugby-league-reacted-to-nrl-boss-departure/story-fni3g0bn-1227575254815", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/departing-nrl-ceo-dave-smith-defiant-on-tough-approach/story-fni3fbgz-1227576166019", "http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9135252.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://polldaddy.com/poll/9135252/", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/nrl/dave-smith-quits-as-nrl-ceo-after-three-years-in-charge-john-grant-named-interim-boss/story-fnp0lyn3-1227575173749", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F20%2FFSD_201015_NRL_THREE_WAY_INT.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/10126505a3a8c202dadf8c0139449cf4", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/229175931&color=ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/"], "published": "2015-10-21T04:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T13:46:21.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
