( Mike Brohard / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nFORT COLLINS — Adrianna Culbert has a serious conundrum on her hands. \nThe senior doesn't really like to draw attention to herself, but the Colorado State senior is making it absolutely impossible with her play for people to even consider not paying attention. \nTake for instance a week in which she had a rare triple-double in a win against Wyoming —her fifth of the season — followed by an even rarer quadruple-double — the first in five years at the NCAA Division I level. \nQue the spotlight, accept the Sports Import/AVCA national player of the week. \nAll Culbert wants to do is shield her eyes. \n\"I'm used to being the person in the background who's doing little things to help everyone else,\" Culbert said. \"It's just different. It's a totally different role.\" \nMaking it tougher is her personality. She's competitive — almost to an unhealthy point, she admits — a trait that extends beyond the court. She's also built with a work ethic which won't allow her to stop trying to improve every facet of the game she plays. \nIt stems from being one of seven siblings, from coming from a household she said was a place \"where we didn't have a lot, but we had enough.\" So her mom, Carla, built into all of her brothers and sisters — all good athletes — not to expect anything to be given to them, but to go out and earn what they wanted. \nCulbert said her mom was often asked why all of the kids were so competitive, so she directed them to meal time. \n\"She's like, well, you have nine people at the table and you cook for six and that's what it is,\" Culbert said with a smile. \"You just gotta go. It's been a running joke in my family; if you don't get to the dinner table, you don't get to eat.\" \nBut if only it stopped there. \nShe lived with Acacia Andrews and Kaitlind Bestgen last year, and after practice, home life wasn't always easy. \n\"They would like go at it at practice,\" Andrews said. \"I was always the one in the corner going, 'look everybody. Be kind.' Sometimes they wouldn't talk to each other after practice, but then it'd be good.\" \nServing drills at club practices were deadly serious to her. So is a trip to the arcade. The Rams went during two-a-days, and Culbert couldn't find anybody to play her in basketball on the mini-court shooting game. She's trying to dial it back, as she said she's found not everybody in the world behaves in such a manner. It's a wonder she has friends, she jokes. \n\"Sometimes. Sometimes it gets a little competitive, a little feisty,\" she said. \"It's OK, we love each other for it.\" \nWhat Culbert feasted on was sports. She was all-state in volleyball three years running and a was a finalist for Michigan's Miss Volleyball. She was also all-state in basketball and competed in track. \nShe's also the first to admit she's not a measurable volleyball player by Division I standards. She's 5-foot-10, not 6-2. She doesn't touch 10-6, and she doesn't think she's all that fast. \nJust beware if you try to outwork her. \n\"The biggest thing I've always appreciated about Dri is she just brought her lunch pail to work every day, and she just wanted to get better,\" said her Dead Frog Far Out club coach Joe Steenhuysen. \"It wasn't about her, it was about I want to get better so my teammates are better. Ever since I've know her, that's her family.\" \nSteenhuysen said her all-around game was really developed by an earlier coach at Dead Frog, Jack Magelssen, when he was coaching Culbert's sister, then later as her high school coach. Culbert at first was asked to join in on drills and eventually was playing up a few levels. And Magelssen would point to another player and tell her that she was going to take Culbert's job if she wasn't able to do it all. \nBecause she didn't \"measure up\" she knew he was right. In the process, she also learned the game at a different mental level. Steenhuysen said Culbert sees the court better than any player he's ever had. She understands nuances to a different degree, dissects all the angles available to her, and in college, she's taken to film study to find weaknesses and how she can exploit them. Adrianna Culbert came to Colorado State to be a setter. She started at the right side as a freshman, but a switch to a 6-2 offense this season has allowed her to put all of her skills on display. ( Steve Stoner / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nShe may never hit over the block, but she sure knows how to get around it. \nStill, CSU coach Tom Hilbert said he has to be honest — that during the recruiting process, he under-evaluated her. He looked at her as a setter, and at first only invited her to walk-on. When a scholarship came open, he offered it to her. \nIt was after she signed, when he started watching her play her senior year of high school, he really started to see the player he was getting. \n\"She did improve herself,\" Hilbert said. \"The No. 1 characteristic she has is she will work at something to make herself better, and she understands how to learn and how to actively learn. Her jump has gone up 5 inches (now 10-1.5). I watched her a couple of tournaments and at AAU's, and I'm like, this kid can really hit.\" \nWhich came in handy. The Rams were struggling on the right side her true freshman year, Hilbert had seen her \"kill it\" in practice and scrapped the plan to redshirt her. She started her first match against Tennessee and she's been there ever since. \nHilbert said she made a bigger jump between her freshman and sophomore years, and now, she may be the best pin player he's had in terms of hitting with tempo on the right side and setting up her blocks. He considers her to be one of the top two all-around players he's had, along with Angela Knopf, who used to hold the school triple-double record. \nCulbert's game draws league-wide respect, too. \n\"The level of respect from other players speaks volumes as well,\" said New Mexico coach Jeff Nelson, who coached Culbert this summer as a group of Mountain West all-stars played in Europe. \"Players, you've really got to earn it with them, and I think she's really well respected throughout the league. \n\"Colorado State's one of our rivals, and our kids were happy for her (quadruple-double). I mean excited for her that she'd done that, got that. They just thought it was really awesome.\" \nNelson knows two of his Lobos on that European team, Julia Warren and Devanne Sours, immediately texted Culbert congratulations. \nShe started to get a bit uncomfortable with it all when she did notched her first triple-double of the season, something she, first, never thought about, and secondly, didn't know was really all that noteworthy. \nTo that point, there had only been four in program history when she pulled off her first this season. Then she started doing it more and more, leading to her program and Mountain West record fifth in a three-set win over Wyoming. \nBy then, she had kindly asked a sports information assistant to relay a polite request to the media to pass her over for consideration when it came to postmatch press conferences. \nBut Saturday, Culbert created a new storm, one that again she didn't realize was coming. \n\"(Team statistician) Jared (Hazel) came up to me after the game and said, 'do you know what you just did?' I said, no, and he said, 'you got a quadruple-double.' And I said, 'wait. How?'\" \nWell, 10 kills, 20 assists, 13 digs and 11 blocks (one solo) did the trick. It was just the second quad at the Division I level since 25-point rally scoring was adopted in 2008, and her's was the only one done in four sets; the other came in five. \nShe now has six triple-doubles on the year, tied for second most in the country with Meg Viggers of Southern Illinois, while Western Carolina's Jo-Leigh Vervelde has seven. Both of them have played 87 sets this year, Culbert 57. \nNaturally, now that she knows somebody is keeping a list, she'll keep tabs. She doesn't want to be tied with anybody in anything, let alone be second. The same goes for being an All-American. She was stunned as a sophomore to be named honorable mention. Again as a junior. This year, her goal is to erase the honorable mention tag. \nWith the season she's having, it's definitely a possibility, another reason for the spotlight to shine. \nReally, Hilbert is to blame. This is the first year in his 18 of coaching the program he's run a 6-2 offense, and it perfectly suits Culbert's all-around game. Maybe her first few years in college, it had to be seen more than once to really be appreciated. Now, it's all too clear to see. \n\"It's perfect for her,\" Hilbert said. \"It is to get the kind of numbers she's getting. She uses every tool that she has.\" \nBut her main goals remain the same, and that's to win a seventh straight Mountain West championship, a glow she loves to bask in because she does so with her teammates. \nThe rest of it, she's come to the conclusion she'll have to get used to. The alternative is to be less competitive, not play so well, and that's just not an option. \n\"I definitely would like to just learn to like (the attention), I guess. It's just a different aspect,\" she said. \"You grow up with volleyball being a team sport, and having a lot of attention on me is different. It takes me by surprise a lot, because I'm not used to it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:25:19.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
