He can use the players and he wanted to use him,” Pellegrini said on Friday. \n“But for me, when you don’t send a player to the national squad and you cannot use him for your club, I think the other sense must be the same. If a player didn’t play the last three games for his club he cannot play for the national squad. \n“But these are the rules. I think some day clubs will protest about that.” \nPellegrini insisted this had not led to a problem between him and Kompany, but would not confirm whether the defender would return to his starting line-up when the Premier League leaders face Bournemouth on Saturday. \n“There is not a problem with him. I think it was important for Vincent to work a complete week before he played and he couldn’t do it because he played for Belgium,” Pellegrini added. \n“We will have to see in the future when he can return to his position.” \nPellegrini also confirmed City’s Argentina striker Sergio Aguero is likely to be out at least a month. \nAguero, who scored five goals on his last City appearance against Newcastle, suffered a hamstring injury on international duty. \n“Sergio has a muscle injury. I think it is an important injury, so I don’t think he will be back before one month,” Pellegrini said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:00:46.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
