(Sean King for Shaw Media) By KEVIN DRULEY - kdruley@shawmedia.com \nAlmost top 'Dogs \nBoys and girls cross country coaches take differing approaches to DyeStat, a strong online voice on the sport that compiles rankings, results and other features throughout the season. \nThere was little else for the Batavia girls to do Thursday but revel, however, when the website placed the Bulldogs as the No. 19 program nationally, joining Illinois brethren Naperville North (No. 4) and Yorkville (No. 10) in the top 30. \nWith much of its core from last season's 11th-place state finish in Class 3A intact, Batavia has continued making strides while grooming other younger runners along the way. \nBulldogs coach Chad Hillman held out a handful of usual starters at the Bartlett Invitational on Sept. 26 in a bid to bolster the program for the stretch run. Understandably, he called it \"a good thing when you have the depth to keep pushing the front runners.\" \nJunior Addie Bobosky paced Batavia at Bartlett, as the team also relies on contributors from all classes, including sophomore Emma Stephens and senior Dakota Roman. \nHillman is especially enthused with the seasoned Roman's resolve. \n\"She's been a state meet regular, but she's had some not so stellar state meets,\" he said. \"She wants to turn that around and finish off great.\" \nRosary's Bens twins court communication \nRosary senior girls tennis players Natalie and Rebecca Bens find it both pleasurable and punny that they comprise the Royals' No. 2 doubles tandem. \n\"It was pretty automatic, seeing as we're twins,\" Natalie said. \"So they had to pair us up.\" \nThe St. Charles-bred duo followed the lead of their older sister, Rachel, a former Royal now studying – but not playing tennis – at the University of Dayton. \n\"We just tried out and we liked it,\" Rebecca said. \nBy extension, several other family members embraced the sport soon enough. The twins tout the skills of their younger sister, Madeline, an eighth grader looking to enroll at Rosary next fall. \nThe girls' father, Gary, has been known to wield a racket, too. \n\"Dad's pretty good at it, though,\" Natalie said. \"I think he played sometime throughout his youth, but he wasn't part of a team or anything.\" \nThe Benses helped Rosary win its own invitational last month, one of several successes for the team in the second half of the regular season. \nFreshman Maria Goheen, another Royals tennis legacy, also has shined as the team prepares for next week's Girls Catholic Athletic Conference tournament and the Waubonsie Valley Sectional on Oct. 17. \n\"I've been working a lot with the girls on the mental skills and training and being aware of what their mindset is going into competitive play,\" Rosary coach John Tsang said. \"So we're getting better at that. We're going to keep reinforcing that. \n\"A lot of it for this athletes is knowing how to compete. When you're in the middle of a tough match, how do you respond to pressure, right? Do you fight or flee? So we certainly want to fight, and we want to fight some more.\" \nThe Bens twins know Tsang's meaning when he talks about \"fight,\" and it isn't to bicker with one another. \n\"Communication is key,\" Rebecca said. \"And we're just moving around a lot. A lot of energy.\" \nIN THE GROOVE \nMonica Guyett \nSt. Charles North girls swimming, jr. \nWhat she did: Guyett helped paced the host North Stars to Thursday's 101-85 dual win against St. Charles East, winning the 200-yard freestyle (1:53.9), 500 free (5:06.23) and competing as part of the champion 200 free relay (1:37.52). \nMegan Safranski \nBurlington Central girls cross country, jr. \nWhat she did: The cross country newbie continued her standout debut season, winning the gold division race at the Aurora Central Catholic Invitational on Sept. 26. Safranski covered the three-mile course in 17:49. \nHITTING REWIND \nThursday's 7-0 road sweep of Larkin marked the St. Charles North girls tennis team's fifth straight victory. In an email, North Stars coach Sean Masoncup wrote the group was peaking at the right time. \nCOMING ATTRACTION \nBe not afraid. They're not real zombies. \nThe Kaneland cross country program will host its second annual Knight of the Zombies Pre-Halloween Run for Your Life on Oct. 9. Cost is $5 for the Trick-or-Treat run for second- through fifth-graders on Kaneland's short course and $10 for the 1.2-mile Run for Your Life, in which chasing \"zombies\" attempt to steal participants' flags as they traverse the course. \nRegistration is set for 4 to 5:30 p.m. The Trick-or-Treat run starts at 5:20, while the Run for Your Life is set to start at 6. Race headquarters are just west of Kaneland's Peterson Field.
