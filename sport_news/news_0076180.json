He served 13 years of his 18-year jail term. \nAfter his release, Sexwale played an active role in calming the deadly wave of political violence that engulfed black townships outside Johannesburg — sometimes while wearing MK fatigues. \nDuring the dark years on the prison island, Sexwale got involved in the running of the Makana Football Association, an informal league of political prisoners. \nThe association was given honorary FIFA membership in 2007. \nTaking the reins of the powerful football body would be a totally different ball game for the charismatic political stalwart. \nHis supporters believe that the anti-apartheid activist would draw on his business and political leadership to steer FIFA out of the corruption crisis. \nIn 1994, Sexwale was appointed by Mandela as the first premier of the country's richest province, Gauteng, which includes Johannesburg and Pretoria. \nSeen by many as a possible presidential candidate, Sexwale left government after four years as premier to start his company, Mvelaphanda, and became a multi-millionaire. \nBut his reputation almost suffered a blow in 2001 when he was named in a conspiracy to topple former president Thabo Mbeki, together with current deputy president Cyril Ramaphosa. \nThe plot was later found to be false. \nIn 2012, Sexwale suffered a political defeat at the ANC elective conference, failing to win enough votes for the position of party deputy president. \n\nPresident Jacob Zuma fired him the following year as housing minister and he has taken a less visible ANC role since. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:16:13.118+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
