Both Baker and Black will have their second interviews early this week and a decision is expected in the near future.\nAdChoices As our managerial carousel tracker shows, Washington has interviewed Baker, Black, Phil Nevin, Alex Cora , Ron Wotus, Ron Gardenhire, Andy Green and Tim Wallach in recent weeks as they look to replace Matt Williams. General manager Mike Rizzo has indicated that he would prefer an experienced manager after Williams' failed tenure, so Baker and Black would seem to fit the bill.\nBlack, 58, was fired by the Padres midway through the season but has been considered a candidate for openings in Seattle, Miami and Los Angeles so far this offseason. He managed in San Diego for eight and a half seasons and has indicated a desire to get back into the dugout next season.\nBaker, 66, has not managed since 2013, but has experience at the helm of the Giants (1993-2002), Cubs (2003-2006) and Reds (2008-2013). He has also been linked to the Marlins ' opening this fall, and may be considered by the Dodgers as well.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/san-diego-padres", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/los-angeles-dodgers", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/cincinnati-reds", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/31630/andy-green", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/chicago-cubs", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/players/292/alex-cora", "http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/washington-nationals", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/san-francisco-giants", "http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/teams/miami-marlins"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:20:15.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
