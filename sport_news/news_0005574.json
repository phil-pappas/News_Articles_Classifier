Kent State is fighting to stay afloat after suffering a pair of close losses to Minnesota and Marshall in the early season, and will face an uphill battle for bowl eligibility with a defeat. \nKEY MATCHUP \nToledo’s offense against Kent State’s stingy defense. The Golden Flashes lead the MAC in total defense and rank sixth nationally with just 258 yards allowed per game, posing a challenge for a Toledo offense that ranks 82nd nationally in scoring. \nThe Rockets’ season low in points scored came in a 16-12 win at then-No. 18 Arkansas. However, Toledo’s attack is relatively balanced. Rockets quarterback Phillip Ely has completed 52.1 percent of his passes for a total of 847 yards, and Toledo’s backs have combined for 701 rushing yards on the year. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nToledo: RB Terry Swanson. Last week at Ball State, he led the Rockets with 139 yards on 24 carries after recording just 75 yards in Toledo’s first three games. With Kareem Hunt’s status still undetermined for Saturday, Swanson could continue to play a major role out of the backfield alongside Damion Jones-Moore. \nKent State: DT Orion Jones. Jones has record 6.5 tackles for loss on the season, including 4.5 sacks for a total of 31 yards. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nToledo’s defense ranks second in the nation in the red zone scoring percentage, having allowed just one touchdown and two field goals in its opponents’ 13 trips inside the 20-yard line. . Toledo hasn’t opened the season 4-0 since 2001. . Kent State hasn’t won in Toledo since 1977, a 10-game losing streak. . The teams have played just four games since 1994. . The Rockets are ranked in the AP Top 25 this week for the first time since 2012. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:24:29.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
