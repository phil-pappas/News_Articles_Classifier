And we will be announcing a date in a few weeks.\n\"Both events will be in the November time frame as we have historically played these events in Australia.\"\nThe Presidents Cup has been played twice in Australia, both times at the Royal Melbourne Golf Club, with the Internationals recording their only win in the event there in 1998.\nThe United States got their revenge at the course in 2011.\nWorld number two Jason Day said he was delighted the event would be played in his homeland in four years' time.\n\"Whether we play at Royal Melbourne or some other golf course, I just like playing that sort of golf, and being back in front of the home crowd will be fantastic,\" said Day, one of the four Australians competing at the 11th edition in South Korea.\n(Reporting by Peter Rutherford; Editing by Amlan Chakraborty )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:19:26.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
