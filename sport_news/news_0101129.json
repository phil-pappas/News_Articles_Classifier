At least the Longhorns’ schedule gets a little easier (possibly) this Saturday. They take on No. 10 Oklahoma in Dallas, and if the Longhorns continue getting blown out by their Big 12 brethren Strong might not make it through the season itself – much less the offseason.\nPhoto: Tom Pennington, Getty Images LOWS\nAround the area:\nTexas coach Charlie Strong called his...

Image 14 of 14 College football week 5 rewind 1 / 14 Back to Gallery From Fort Worth to College Station, it was the Weekend of the Tweet in college football. First, Texas freshman defensive back Kris Boyd during halftime of the Longhorns' blowout loss at TCU retweeted a Twitter post suggesting he transfer.\n\"Our players should never be on their phone at halftime,\" UT coach Charlie Strong told reporters after TCU dialed up a 50-7 victory over the Longhorns. \"I was not aware of that.\"\nBoyd apologized for his tweet on Sunday. Over at A&M, sophomore receiver Ricky Seals-Jones was ejected in the first half against Mississippi State for a questionable targeting call. Later in the game and apparently from the locker room, he retweeted a post providing video of the hit.\nConsidering No. 9 A&M had defeated MSU 30-17 to enter its bye week undefeated, coach Kevin Sumlin took word of Seals-Jones' in-game tweet more in stride than Strong.\n\"We'll address that,\" Sumlin said.\nA&M's fourth-year coach had plenty to be happy about despite his receiver's itchy fingers. The 5-0 Aggies enter a bye week to rest and recuperate for No. 8 Alabama's visit on Oct. 17.\nCheck out the gallery to see the highs, lows, Quote: of the week and Heisman watch for week five of college football action.\nCOMING THIS WEEK\nSMU at Houston, 7 p.m. Thursday\nTexas vs. Oklahoma (in Dallas), 11 a.m. Saturday\nBaylor at Kansas, 11 a.m. Saturday\nRice at Florida Atlantic, 1:30 p.m. Saturday\nMississippi Valley State at Prairie View A&M, 2 p.m. (Waller ISD)\nCentral Arkansas at Houston Baptist, 2:30 p.m. Saturday\nIncarnate Word at Sam Houston State, 6 p.m. Saturday\nTCU at Kansas State, 6:30 p.m. Saturday\nCal at Utah, 9 p.m. Saturday\nArkansas at Alabama, 6 p.m. Saturday", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/37/8738757/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/36/8738721/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/36/8738751/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/36/8738751/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/35/8738687/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/35/8738687/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/36/8738750/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/35/8738685/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/36/8738719/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/36/8738721/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/37/8738766/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/37/8738754/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/36/8738710/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/37/8738756/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/37/8738757/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/37/8738756/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/36/8738750/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/36/8738710/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/35/8738685/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/37/8738754/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/35/8738684/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/36/8738689/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/36/8738689/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/37/8738766/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/36/8738719/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/35/8738684/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T04:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:55:56.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
