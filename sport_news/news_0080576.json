This answer (not literally) comes in the form of a book, Absolute Liberation written by Gurpreet. All of you who had either conveniently or morally avoided any question regarding money, how to double triple it, how to let it more coming by keeping detached to it, Gurpreet who moved out to France in 2006 to complete his MBA answers with élan! “Each time I would come back to Punjab, I would often find myself surrounded by the question, ‘How do we make more money’. This question was thrown in by my young friends, so I thought let me tell them and everyone who wishes to make more money,” shares Gurpreet makes a generous mention of the word ‘money’ pretty much unapologetically. Every cell of Gurpreet believes that it is possible to make a lot of money by keeping ones integrity and honesty intact. “Firstly, I feel emotional freedom and financial freedom are two different things but if you are emotionally stuck you can’t get financial freedom,” as he tells about the various techniques he has written in this debut book to be emotionally free! The first lesson that you can get here is, don’t attach yourself too much to money, and you will see it coming your way! Gurpreet asks you to actually put it in practice, like he does. “I have zero attachment to money, I still have the heart to make a lot of money, and I am doing it fruitfully.” This young entrepreneur who gives lectures at universities and MBA schools cites an example when he asked for a salary raise, thrice, at his previous job because he thought he wasn’t well-paid. “See here, people don’t like talking about money, most would be too embarrassed to talk about it. But we shouldn’t,” adds Gurpreet who is already halfway through his second book, “It is on stock investing, something I have been doing for the last four years,” adds this young lad who doesn’t want to call the debut book as a self help book. “It isn’t self help guide; I have plucked and pasted my lives experiences and my own journey in this book.” Well, Oscar Wilde had said ‘When I was young I though that money was the most important thing in life: now that I am old I know it is,’ Gurpreet Kang smiles and nods in absolute approval!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:12:43.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
