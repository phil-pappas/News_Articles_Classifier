Ogunbowale rushed for 83 of his 117 yards in the final 15 minutes. Offense • C+ \nThe receivers rebounded from some early drops with big catches in the second half. Nice to have Alex Erickson back, isn't it? The running game went nowhere until the end, when Dare Ogunbowale showed up in a big way. You've got to hand it to Joel Stave — nothing gets him down. Defense • B \nExcept for a brief lapse late in the first half and one play in the fourth quarter, the defense was stellar. UW stresses limiting big plays, but two long touchdowns accounted for almost a third of Nebraska's yards. When the defense needed a stop at the end, it got it. Special teams • C+ \nRafael Gaglianone's late missed field goal was deflating, but he made up for it with his game-winner. Punter Drew Meyer had great hang time but needed line drives into the wind. When he did, he pinned Nebraska at the 1. Andrew Endicott's out-of-bounds kickoff was a buzzkill. Coaching • B \nPaul Chryst's confidence in Gaglianone never wavered and it paid off in the end. The run was going nowhere but Chryst stayed with it and UW wore down Nebraska in the fourth quarter. The Badgers should have been spying Tommy Armstrong when he converted a third-and-15 late. Overall • B \nIt wasn't always pretty — actually, it was pretty frustrating for three quarters — but UW never gave in. The Badgers had a huge fourth quarter to come out on top in a must-win Big Ten game at an intimidating stadium. Not everything is clicking, but this team has character. \nContact Tom Oates at toates@madison.com or 608-252-6172.
