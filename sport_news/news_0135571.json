No. \n“But he’s something pretty special and we’re very excited he’s got Drake across his chest.” Ray Giacoletti starts his third season with the Bulldogs. \nThe Bulldogs also feature a trio of experienced guards, with sophomore Reed Timmer, senior Karl Madison and Penn State transfer Graham Woodward. \n“If the team starts struggling during practice or if you have a problems, they come and talk with you,” Olejniczak said. “They’re kind of like mentors or role models.” \nWith the trio of proven perimeter players to go with Olejniczak — not to mention Northwestern transfer and Valley High School alum Kale Abrahamson or 7-foot junior Jacob Enevold Jensen — Drake should improve on its 9-22 record from last season. \nThe question is: how much? \nMost prognosticators still see Drake as an afterthought in the Missouri Valley Conference, especially with Wichita State expected to dominate, again. \n“I think right now, we make a huge jump in Year 3,” said Giacoletti, who took over the program in March of 2013. “Then moving into Year 4 (2016-17), we can start talking about getting in the upper third (of the conference). \n“There’s a slow, correct progression that it takes. You’ve got to walk before you run.” \nThe Bulldogs stumbled early in 2014-15, losing eight of their first nine games. By mid-January, Drake’s record stood at 3-14. \n“It’s definitely a change from last year,” Timmer said, “in terms of how our team is collectively and how we act around each other.” Drake guard takes more of a leadership role. \nTimmer eventually gained his footing and became Drake’s leading scorer with 11.5 points per game. He also had a team-high 74 assists. \n“Reed Timmer was a young man last year,” Giacoletti said. “He’s a man, now, with all the minutes he was able to experience last year.” \nThe Bulldogs’ roster features a total of 10 players who are either freshmen or sophomores, so more growing pains may be inevitable. It’s also possible they’re poised for a breakthrough. \nNear the end of Drake practices, Giacoletti lets any player who wins a sprint (up and down the court) head to the locker room. \nOlejniczak hasn’t beaten Timmer, yet. But the surprisingly nimble big man is usually among the first three to leave. \n“I’ve never been with a team like this,” Olejniczak said. “We have so great a chemistry. Everyone is like a brother for each other.” Buy Photo Drake's Reed Timmer poses for a photo during Drake Men's Basketball media day on Monday, Oct. 5, 2015 at the Knapp Center and Shivers Basketball Practice Facility in Des Moines.
