Mississippi State has won six in a row against the Wildcats. The Bulldogs’ average margin of victory has been 9.8 points during the winning streak. \nLast year, Mississippi State played its first game in program history as the No. 1 team in the country. Kentucky played MSU to within a touchdown through three quarters. Christian Holmes’ touchdown return on an onside kick widened the final score to a 14-point cushion. Kentucky’s Patrick Towles was the best quarterback on the field through, throwing for a career-best 390 yards and rushing for a career-high 76 yards and two touchdowns. \n3 THINGS WE’RE TALKING ABOUT \nReplacing Redmond \nMississippi State will be without its top corner for the rest of the season. Will Redmond, who ESPN projected as a first-round draft pick, tore his anterior cruciate ligament last week, sources told the Clarion-Ledger. Redmond led the Bulldogs with two interceptions. Tolando Cleveland will likely replace the senior. Cleveland has started four games this season. The junior has 24 tackles this season, including 2.5 for loss. Other candidates to see increased playing time include Cedric Jiles and Jamoral Graham. \nMulti-scorers \nMississippi State has found the end zone in six scenarios this season. The Bulldogs’ offense has scored through rushing and passing in multiple games this season. \nBrandon Holloway returned a kick for a touchdown in the season-opener against Southern Miss. Fred Ross returned a punt 77 yards and scored against Troy. Nelson Adams pounced on a fumble for a defensive touchdown in the same game. Last week against Louisiana Tech, Brandon Bryant scored on a 73-yard interception. Bryant almost scored on a punt block last week as well. Mississippi State has yet to return a blocked field goal for a touchdown this year. MSU last returned a punt block for a touchdown \nElite trio \nWith his first touchdown pass last week, Dak Prescott joined Tim Tebow and Johnny Manziel as the only players in Southeastern Conference history with 50 touchdown passes and 30 rushing scores. \nHe holds every MSU passing record. He needs 96 yards to eclipse John Bond as the leading rusher in program history by a quarterback. Prescott is four touchdowns away from passing Manziel on the SEC career touchdowns list. He trails Tebow by 763 yards for most rushing yards in conference history by a quarterback. GAME-DAY DATA \nWhere: Davis Wade Stadium, Starkville \nTelevision: SEC Network \nLast meeting: 45-31 MSU, 2014 \nAll-time series: Tied 21-21 KEEP AN EYE ON \nPatrick Towles, QB: The Kentucky quarterback outplayed Dak Prescott in last year’s matchup. Towles threw for 390 yards and rushed for 76. He scored four touchdowns too. UNIT THAT COULD GIVE MSU FITS \nKentucky wide receivers : Kentucky boasts two wide-outs that have at least 28 receptions this season. Both Dorian Baker and Garrett Johnson averaged better than 11 yards per catch. The duo also has four touchdown receptions. 35 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.thec-l.com/1S0t5VL TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:12:54.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
