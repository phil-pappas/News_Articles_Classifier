Pittsburgh can ensure the game is at PNC Park with a win in either of its two remaining games or one Cubs loss in Milwaukee. \n\"It's exciting, especially in this game where we're trying to play at home,\" Marte said after the Pirates rallied from a 4-0 deficit. \"We play good baseball at home. We want to make our fans happy. We want to play here.\" \nAndrew McCutchen had three hits for the Pirates, including a home run.

Marte hit the next pitch into the right-field stands for his 19th homer this season and his third career walkoff shot. He also hit a game-ending homer Aug. 22 against San Francisco. \n\"He continues to show up big,\" Pittsburgh manager Clint Hurdle said. \"He likes the big situations.\" \nArquimedes Caminero (5-1) pitched a scoreless inning for the win.

The 24-year-old is 0-5 in his last nine starts. \nPittsburgh tied it 4-all with a three-run sixth inning after loading the bases with none out to chase Sampson. \nTony Cingrani relieved and walked pinch-hitter Michael Morse, forcing in a run. Another run scored on Pedro Alvarez's fielder's choice grounder, then Jordy Mercer tied it with an RBI single.

An inning later, Jay Bruce hit an RBI double and Suarez followed with a run-scoring single. \nMcCutchen pulled the Pirates to 4-1 when he led the fourth inning with his 23rd homer.

Votto singled in the third inning off Liriano to match Pete Rose's mark set in 1978.

He is 1-2 with a 6.00 ERA since moving into the rotation Sept. 18. \nPirates: RHP A.J. Burnett (9-6, 3.15) is 1-1 with a 3.68 ERA in four starts since being on the disabled list from July 31 to Sept. 9 with a strained flexor tendon in his right elbow. Burnett plans to retire at the end of this season, so this would likely be the last game of his 17-year career if the Pirates lose the wild-card game.
