(Erik S. Lesser/EPA) \nThe Redskins lost to the Falcons in overtime, 25-19, on Sunday at the Georgia Dome. Here’s how the 61 offensive and season-high 81 defensive snaps were divided up: \nQuarterback Kirk Cousins – 61 snaps (played 100 percent on offense) Colt McCoy – DNP \nIt was a mixed bag from Cousins. He went 21 of 32 for 219 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions, including the game-losing pick-six to Robert Alford in overtime. It’s the third time this season Cousins has thrown two interceptions, and the Redskins have lost all three games. The offense had to rely on Cousins because of an ineffective run game, and he came through on the final drive before regulation, leading the Redskins on a 46-yard drive in 24 seconds for the game-tying 52-yard field goal. There were other moments when Cousins was off however, including a number of passes thrown behind receivers. \nRunning backs Chris Thompson – 26 snaps (43 percent) Matt Jones – 20 snaps (33 percent) Alfred Morris – 14 snaps (23 percent) Darrel Young – four snaps (seven percent) \nTwo weeks after Redskins Coach Jay Gruden said he wanted Morris to be the lead dog, he hardly played down the stretch out of 20 offensive plays in the fourth quarter and overtime. Morris didn’t play in the fourth and received three snaps in overtime. It’s the second-fewest snaps Morris has received this season; He’d had 12 against the Giants. He finished with eight carries for 15 yards. \nThe entire run game struggled in its worst performance this season. Washington gained just 51 yards on 24 carries, averaging 2.1 yards per attempt. Jones led the unit with 11 rushes for 20 yards. \nWide receivers Ryan Grant – 49 snaps (80 percent) Jamison Crowder – 49 snaps (80 percent) Pierre Garcon – 47 snaps (77 percent) Rashad Ross – 11 snaps (18 percent) Andre Roberts – nine snaps (15 percent) \nIt was another impressive performance from Crowder, who caught all eight targets for 87 yards. The rookie has received a larger role over the past two games, and he’s definitely shined in the process, serving as a top target for Cousins. Garcon finished with three catches for 51 yards. \nTight ends Derek Carrier – 58 snaps (95 percent) Anthony McCoy – 11 snaps (18 percent) \nThe Redskins didn’t use too many two-tight-end sets with the absence of Jordan Reed. Carrier caught the only touchdown pass from Cousins, but Washington didn’t get much else from this position. He finished with two catches for 27 yards. \nOffensive line Trent Williams – 61 snaps (100 percent) Spencer Long – 61 snaps (100 percent) Kory Lichtensteiger – 61 snaps (100 percent) Morgan Moses – 61 snaps (100 percent) Brandon Scherff – 60 snaps (98 percent) Tom Compton – seven snaps (11 percent) Josh LeRiebus – one snap (two percent) Ty Nsekhe – DNP \nThe offensive line couldn’t establish the run, and Cousins was hit five times in the game. It allowed just one sack, but Cousins dealt with pressure on the game-losing interception in overtime, with a linebacker running free off the left side. \nDefensive line Jason Hatcher – 48 snaps (60 percent) Chris Baker – 44 snaps (55 percent) Terrance Knighton – 39 snaps (49 percent) Stephen Paea – 27 snaps (34 percent) Ricky Jean Francois – 15 snaps (26 percent) Kendric Golston – eight snaps (10 percent) Atlanta’s Julio Jones has a 2nd quarter pass knocked away near the goal line by Washington’s Kyshoen Jarrett. \nThe defensive line brought enough pressure to rattle Matt Ryan for most of the game, but it struggled to stop the run. Atlanta rushed for 176 yards, averaging 5.5 yards per rush. Baker had another nice performance, forcing two fumbles and recording a sack in his second consecutive game. \nLinebacker Keenan Robinson – 80 snaps (100 percent) Ryan Kerrigan – 69 snaps (86 percent) Perry Riley Jr. – 60 snaps (75 percent) Trent Murphy – 58 snaps (72 percent) Preston Smith – 31 snaps (39 percent) Will Compton – 20 snaps (25 percent) Jackson Jeffcoat – three snaps (four percent) Mason Foster – DNP (14 snaps on special teams) \nKerrigan seems to be returning to form now. He has three sacks in the past two games as the defense has been able to get to the quarterback often lately. The linebackers didn’t help with stopping running back Devonta Freeman, who had 153 yards on 27 carries and a touchdown. \nRiley Jr. played most of the game as he returned from a calf injury, but Compton replaced Riley Jr. at the end of the game. \nCornerback Bashaud Breeland – 80 snaps (100 percent) Will Blackmon – 80 snaps (100 percent) Kyshoen Jarrett – 56 snaps (68 percent) Deshazor Everett – DNP (15 snaps on special teams) Quinton Dunbar – DNP (nine snaps on special teams) \nThe Redskins received some solid performances from Breeland, Blackmon and Jarrett in the absence of Chris Culliver and DeAngelo Hall. Breeland finished with eight tackles, and an interception, and he defended four passes. Jarrett and Blackmon each defended a pass against Julio Jones. As thin as the Redskins were at the position, all three cornerbacks stepped up against an explosive Falcons offense.

(Johnathan Newton/The Washington Post) \nSafety Dashon Goldson – 80 snaps (100 percent) Trenton Robinson – 75 snaps (94 percent) Jeron Johnson – four (five snaps on special teams) \nGoldson led the defense with 10 tackles, while Robinson had six tackles and an interception of Ryan. Robinson cramped up after celebrating a missed field goal by the Falcons, but he later returned to the game. \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:08:58.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
