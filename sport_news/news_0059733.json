So it's entirely up to him. \n\"He has certainly not done his cause any harm. All you can do when you are given a chance to play for England is to go out against whoever that opponent may be and do it very well. And if you do that, you get yourself in the forefront of the manager's mind,\" the former Liverpool manager added. \nDefender Phil Jagielka, who wore the armband for England against Lithuania, has urged Hodgson to pick his strongest side for their upcoming friendlies against Spain, France and Germany. \n\"If we don't pick strong teams then the friendlies are pointless,\" Jagielka said. \n\"If we pick strong teams then we probably put ourselves under a bit of pressure, but we need to see where we stand. \n\"Hopefully we play well in those games and it gives us a bit more confidence looking forward to boarding the plane to France. \n\"He (Hodgson) will probably play his strongest team, if not pretty close to it, in both games. That should give you a good idea of how he is looking at these friendlies and how we go about it,\" the Everton captain added. \nEngland play Spain in Alicante on Nov. 13 before hosting France at Wembley four days later. \n(Reporting by Shravanth Vijayakumar in Bengaluru; editing by Amlan Chakraborty ) \nOur top photos from the last 24 hours.
