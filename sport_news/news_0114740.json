Chris Pizzello, file AP Photo 1 of 7 The Associated Press LAS VEGAS \nThe latest on the hospitalization of Lamar Odom, who was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel (all times local): \n12:10 a.m. \nLamar Odom lashed out about the media, his anguish over his reputation, and his relationship with estranged wife Khloe Kardashian in remarks videotaped in August by celebrity website TMZ. \nThe online video shows a visibly irritated Odom saying: \"Ya'll have discredited me, beat me down, took my confidence, took everything away from me. You will not do it again.\" \nHe slams a media report that he ambushed Kardashian outside a California gym, saying he lives in Las Vegas now. \nThe former NBA star and reality TV personality also railed against reports that he's a womanizer and drug addict and touted his accomplishments on the basketball court. \n\"I probably couldn't even get (expletive) hired by Home Depot right now because of how people look at me,\" he says. \"It's over.\" \nOdom was found unconscious Tuesday at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, about 70 miles from Las Vegas. Kardashian has been by his side at a Las Vegas hospital. \n--- \n10:50 a.m. \nThe Rev. Jesse Jackson says Lamar Odom is on life support but that his doctors think he's improving. \nJackson visited the former NBA star and reality TV personality at a Las Vegas hospital Wednesday morning. He says Odom was unresponsive Tuesday but \"has some responsiveness now.\" \nJackson added: \"Apparently from what the doctor said, he was much better off today than yesterday.\" \nJackson was in town for Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate. He stopped and spoke to the media as he was leaving the hospital Wednesday. \nHe says Khloe Kardashian and some of Odom's childhood friends were by Odom's side, and former Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant visited him last night. \nJackson says Odom's loved ones are \"just holding hands and hoping he can bounce back.\" \nOdom was found unconscious Tuesday afternoon at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, about 70 miles from Las Vegas. \n--- \n9:40 a.m. \nNye County, Nevada, Sheriff Sharon Wehrly said investigators sought a warrant to obtain a blood sample to determine if Lamar Odom suffered a drug or alcohol overdose. \nWehrly said detectives worked until early Wednesday collecting evidence and interviewing employees at the brothel where the former NBA player and reality show star was found unconscious. She said she couldn't immediately say what they believe caused Odom to become unconscious. \nBut she acknowledged that medics usually turn someone on their side, as Odom was, to relieve pressure on the chest and help them breathe. \nThe sheriff didn't say whether Odom ever regained consciousness while he was stabilized and taken to hospitals. \nBrothel owner Dennis Hof said Odom arrived alone, was \"polite and reserved,\" drank alcohol from the bar and took herbal sexual enhancement capsules. \nHof said Odom didn't use drugs in the presence of anyone in the house. \n--- \n7 a.m. \nReality TV personality Khloe Kardashian has been by Lamar Odom's side at a Las Vegas hospital since Tuesday evening. \nThat's according to a person close to the Kardashians who spoke anonymously because she wasn't authorized to speak to the press. Kardashian and Odom were married in 2009, but Kardashian filed for divorce in 2013, citing irreconcilable differences. \nOdom was found unconscious Tuesday afternoon at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, about 70 miles outside of Las Vegas. \nAuthorities said the 35-year-old was stabilized at the scene before being taken to a hospital. He was then transferred to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas. \nOwner Dennis Hof said Odom had been at his brothel since Saturday.
