Nitti; RB C.J. Williams; WR Will Carter; T Julie’n Davenport; LB Ben Richard; S Clayton Ewell Did you know? Bucknell has not played a Division I-A team since Kent State on Sept. 8, 2001. The Bison are 0-5 vs. I-A teams since 1978, losing to Army twice (1988, 1995) in that span. PLAYERS TO WATCH Army Ahmad Bradshaw, sophomore quarterback: Bradshaw looked out of sync and far from 100 percent in relief of A.J. Schurr last week. It was Bradshaw's first action since the second quarter of the Eastern Michigan game on Sept. 26 because of an ankle injury. Ball security should be Bradshaw’s top priority after fumbling four times against Duke last week. Rhyan England, sophomore safety: Army’s secondary leader returns after missing the Duke game with a concussion. England should play a bigger role in stopping Bucknell’s run game. Bucknell C.J. Williams, junior running back: Williams is a game-time decision after missing last week’s game against Lehigh with a concussion. He ranks sixth on Bucknell’s career rushing list (2,210 yards). Williams has had 11 career 100-yard games, including 131 yards in Bucknell’s 17-0 season-opening win over Marist. Ben Richard, sophomore middle linebacker: Richard, Bucknell’s leading tackler (52), had 18 stops in an overtime win at VMI on Oct. 3. He’s tied for the team lead with seven tackles for a loss. INSIDE THE HUDDLE Reinforcements not coming Junior cornerback and two-year starter Josh Jenkins, senior tackle Drew Hennessy, a starter in 2014, and sophomore defensive lineman Andrew McLean won’t play a down this season. As Army hit its midway point, coach Jeff Monken said all three are out. Jenkins has been working out and involved in team meetings and practices following a head injury from an on-post fight in July. Doctors wouldn’t clear Jenkins for contact and practices. Hennessy injured his ankle in a preseason scrimmage. McLean hurt his foot before training camp. Gibson shines in first start Highly touted freshman safety Gibby Gibson made his debut on defense last week to positive reviews by Monken. Gibson, as Army’s nickel back, was credited with only one tackle but was solid in coverage and played over the top of blocks, allowing teammates to make plays. He was limited to 26 snaps because of an ankle injury suffered inside of 9:00 left in the second quarter. “It was just fun to see some hard work pay off and help the team as much as possible,” Gibson said. “I worked really hard to get to that point.” Playing to win Monken said he didn’t think about playing freshman Chris Carter or junior Matt Kaufmann at quarterback with Army trailing Duke 44-3 midway through the fourth quarter. Carter and Kaufmann are third and fourth, respectively, on the depth chart. “We were doing our very best to stay in the game and have our best guys in there and keep it respectable,” Monken said. “We got to the point where it wasn’t. They beat the pants off us. We wanted to play the guys who we thought gave us the best chance.” Carter has received some second-team snaps in practice with recent injuries to Ahmad Bradshaw and A.J. Schurr. Special teams Senior kicker Dan Grochowski accounted for Army’s only points against Duke with a 22-yard field goal. Grochowski has attempted just three field goals this season. Army's Marcus Hyatt had a career-high 38-yard kickoff return last week. The Black Knights have not returned a kickoff for a touchdown in their last 354 attempts dating to 2007. Bucknell’s Joey DeFloria returned a kickoff 85 yards for a score against VMI on Oct. 3. Kicker John Burdick has missed four of his seven field goals on the year. Burdick’s long is a 30-yarder. Trends Army is 6-4 in its last 10 games against Division I-AA opponents, including a 37-35 loss to Fordham on Sept. 4. The Black Knights are 0-3 at Michie Stadium this season. Army has not lost its first four home games in a season since 2005. Bucknell has been outscored 47-24 in the first half this season. The Bison have scored just one touchdown in the second quarter. Quick hits with Army freshman fullback Drue Harris Harris leads all Army plebes with 157 yards rushing. His two touchdowns are third on the team. Harris was too big to be a running back when he started playing football in the fifth grade, so he was the team’s center. Harris’ bruising running style comes from watching NFL stars Adrian Peterson and Marshawn Lynch. “They are both just monsters on the field,” he said. Harris was interested in playing for Colorado State before the offer was pulled when coach Jim McElwain left for Florida. “Colorado will always be home. I just wanted to go out and experience something else.” If Harris is playing Madden, he’s using the 49ers. When Harris isn’t playing for Army or involved in his studies and cadet duties, he probably will have a football in his hand, tossing it around with friends. By the numbers minus-5: Army’s turnover margin through six games. minus-6: Combined rushing yards from Army quarterbacks Ahmad Bradshaw and A.J. Schurr against Duke last week. 7: Army’s fumbles in each of its last two games. The Black Knights lead Division I-A with 22 fumbles. 28: Most points scored by Bucknell in a game this season. It came in an overtime win over VMI. 64.4: Completion percentage by Army opponents this season. 101: Career receptions by Bucknell receiver Will Carter, suspended for last week’s game against Lehigh because of violating team rules.
