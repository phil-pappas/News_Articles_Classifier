Collins said he \"absolutely\" plans to pitch Harvey more than in only Game 1 of this series. Mets general manager Sandy Alderson said that's a determination made based on how Harvey feels \"appearance to appearance.\" \n\"We've tried to take it one step at a time,\" said Alderson, who admitted it's \"probably unlikely\" Harvey would pitch six times in the postseason if the Mets advanced to the World Series. \nJon Lester, the Cubs' $155 million lefthander, will oppose Harvey in Game 1. The force that is Jake Arrieta will pitch Game 2 for Chicago on Sunday. The Mets have yet to announce who will oppose Arrieta. That decision hinges on how Noah Syndergaard feels on Saturday. Not only did the hard-throwing rookie pitch an inning of relief Thursday, but he warmed up in the bullpen four different times. \nIf Syndergaard is still sore, rookie lefthander Steven Matz would start Game 2 for the Mets. It's expected that Jacob deGrom will pitch Game 3 for New York, although neither team has announced its starters for Tuesday's game at Wrigley Field. \nBut first up is a marquee matchup between the 26-year-old Harvey and the 31-year-old Lester. \n\"I think there's been a lot of ups and downs,\" Harvey said of his at times tumultuous season. \"I think obviously, all of the success that we're having as a team has definitely kind of put all of the downs a lot more out of my head than anything. \n\"So I think going into the playoffs and into this series, I think we all kind of went into it trying to flush all the ups and downs that we've had, keep the positives in our mind and really keep going forward with that.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:38:23.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
