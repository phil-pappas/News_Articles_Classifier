''It was so challenging on Thursday and Friday.\n''I felt I was surviving but played some really steady, good golf and that was a real difference - I got off to a start where most people got beat up.\n''I was able to play it two-over par for the first 36 and had a really steady, nice solid weekend.''\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:53:03.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
