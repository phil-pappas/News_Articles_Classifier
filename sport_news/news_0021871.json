Houston took a 6-2 lead into the eighth, but a tough error charged to the 21-year-old rookie keyed the Royals' comeback to even the matchup at two games apiece.\nGame 5 will be back in Kansas City on Wednesday night.\nLate in the game, a tweet from the account of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott congratulated the Astros on advancing to the AL Championship Series.\nBut the defending AL champion Royals had other ideas.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
