Headlining their attack are household names Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Edinson Cavani, who have six goals apiece this season. Zlatan, 34 now, is not the physical specimen he once was, but the man still holds his unreal ability to find the net from nearly anywhere. Meanwhile Cavani has taken a dip of form following an electric start to the season, having not scored since September. \nPSG's midfield is really where their magic happens. With Matuidi, Motta, and Verratti, PSG's had no problems creating chances (6 per match) for their targetmen. But PSG, too, felt the undying wrath of the international break, with Matuidi, Verratti, Angel Di María, and keeper Kevin Trapp all nursing injuries. Though the severity and duration of their players' injuries pales in comparison to Real's. Trapp will miss the match for certain, and the rest of them should be ready to go. \nWhere to even start with Real Madrid's injuries? \nGareth Bale has been ruled out with a thigh injury. Luka Modrić and Karim Benzema are hopeful to play against PSG, but one could argue it might be better to let them take their time. Modrić and Benz are vital to Real Madrid, and to rush them back from muscle and hamstring injuries, respectively, would be short-sighted. Pepe and James are unlikely to make the trip. \nSergio Ramos seems to be ready to go, so yay. \nJuventus vs. Borussia Monchengladach is indeed a top-of-the-table vs. bottom-of-the-table situation. And, for all intents and purposes, if Juventus do win on Wednesday night, they will be sitting pretty atop the group with nine points — exactly what you want after three Champions League group stage games and two of the next three away from home. \nThat sounds like a pretty good spot to be in, doesn't it? \nEasier said than done, sure, but as we have come to know about this version of Juventus, they certainly look the part when playing against European competition. That might not always be the case in Serie A — although Sunday's derby draw was a step in the right direction — but it's been true in the Champions League. They got the job done on the road at Manchester City. They dispatched of Sevilla rather easily, and now we look for them to get three more points at home against the only club in the group yet to win a game. \nManchester City have the opportunity to move into the top two in Champions League Group D when they welcome Sevilla to the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday evening. \nCity face the first of back-to-back Champions League fixtures against the La Liga side, but come into the game in excellent goalscoring form after hitting six past Newcastle and five past Bournemouth in their last two Premier League matches. \nUnai Emery's Sevilla have failed to match the form that led to fifth place in La Liga last season, and currently have just nine points from their opening eight league games. \nInconsistency has been their main concern, with impressive wins over Barcelona and Borussia Monchengladbach followed by disappointing performances against Celta Vigo and Eibar. \nOn a sodden night in the Russian capital seven years ago, Rooney and his team-mates defeated Chelsea on penalties to clinch United's third European Cup. \nThe venue may be different - CSKA Moscow play in the Khimki Arena, not the Luzhniki Stadium - but the feeling of going back to Moscow remains the same for Rooney ahead of Wednesday's Champions League Group B encounter. \nThe 29-year-old, speaking to the English press aboard United's chartered flight east, recalled that night in Moscow with a warm smile. \n``It was the highlight of my career,'' the striker said. ``It is a massive competition to play in, to win the trophy it's obviously great memories.'' \nThe Champions League has brought Rooney pain in his career too, including last year when he had to watch it from the sidelines because of United's failure to qualify under former manager David Moyes. \n``We want to get back to winning trophies, of course. That is why you play football - to try and be successful, certainly at this club,'' Rooney said. ``In the last few years we haven't been good enough. \n``There has been a big change in the club over the last few years and it's now starting to settle back down into a good rhythm with what the manager wants from us and we are improving. \n``If we keep going the way we are, keep improving the way we are, then we will have a good chance of being successful.'' \nMeanwhile, CSKA Moscow goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev is hoping to avoid another ``horrible'' night against United. \nThe last time United came up against CSKA was six years ago. United won 1-0 in the Russian capital, but in the opposing fixture CSKA came within a whisker of recording a historic win. \nCSKA established a 3-1 lead over the hosts, but Paul Scholes pulled one back and Antonio Valencia scored in the 92nd minute to snatch a draw for the Red Devils. \nCatch all Champions League games and highlights from SuperSport today. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
