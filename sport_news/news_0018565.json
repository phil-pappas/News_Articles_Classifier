We’ve had our ups and downs and it’s been great. I love playing next to him, we’re going to miss him next year.” \nThe pair are hoping next year waits a little longer. \nCenterville returns to Knightstown Thursday to take on Jac-Cen-Del in the semifinal of the Class A regional. \nCentral Christian Academy meets Greenwood Christian at 5 p.m. Thursday, while Jac-Cen-Del and Centerville play at 7 p.m., with the regional championship scheduled for 7 p.m. Saturday. \nThe regional champion meets the Switzerland County regional champion in the Floyd Central semistate Oct. 24. \nThe Bulldogs won the first round regional game just twice in the last four years, and they aim to take an extra step this year. \n“We want to come out focused, because we have a goal; we want to be the first team to win that regional,” Ricky Torres said. “We just have to take it one game at a time, that’s all we can do, is go one game at a time.” \nNobody has been able to knock off the Bulldogs since soccer split into a two-class sport in 2011. \nThey also won a single-class sectional in 2006. \nThis year’s sectional brought about as much drama as any. \nSeton Catholic defeated Centerville 2-1 in the regular season, the first time the Cardinals had beaten Centerville in program history. \nDante Torres played with many of Seton’s talented freshmen class growing up, and they were coached by Ricardo Torres, father of both Ricky and Dante. \n“(Ricardo Torres) coached a lot of those freshmen on travel ball, so he knows them,” Centerville coach Scott Ferguson said. “Dante knows three quarters of Seton’s players, so obviously, with them winning in September, there was a level of grit that the boys had that they just, I hate to say it like this, but they wanted to win when it mattered.” \nAs tough as that 2-1 loss in the regular season was, it also helped as extra motivation heading into the tournament. \n“It was awesome, it felt really good to beat them,” Dante said, adding that there was a little extra incentive in beating his former teammates. \nRicky Torres played with a chip on his shoulder, too, he said, after missing a penalty kick that would have tied the regular-season meeting. \n“During the regular season, we psyched ourselves out,” Ricky Torres said. “We knew they had some talent, we may have overlooked them a little bit – give them all the credit in the world, they’re a good team, great program from here on out.” \nRicky Torres has left a mark on the Bulldog program, and Dante looks to help the Bulldogs continue the success down the line. \n“… (E)ven though Dante’s a freshman, I feel like he has a lot of experience for a freshman, he’s a more mature freshman, so he’s going to be a great leader after our seniors are gone,” Ricky Torre said. \n“He’s always wanted to be better than me, stuff like that, so we have a little competition between each other, and it’s good to have him on my team.” \nAT A GLANCE What: IHSAA Class A boys soccer regional When/Where: Thursday and Saturday at Knightstown Cost: $6 per session or $9 for all sessions \nSchedule Game 1: Central Christian Academy vs. Greenwood Christian, 5 p.m. Thursday Game 2: Centerville vs. Jac-Cen-Del, 7 p.m. Thursday Game 3: Championship, 7 p.m. Saturday Next: Regional champion plays Switzerland County regional champion Oct. 24 at Floyd Central semistate 81 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://pinews.co/1LrcMQD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:58:36.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
