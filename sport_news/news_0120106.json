The Avalanche was down 5-0 late in the second period before goals from Gabe Landeskog — already his fourth goal of the season — and John Mitchell made the final score misleading.\nPatrick Roy was noticeably angry after the game.\n\"I'm not happy. I'm not happy at all,\" the Avalanche coach said. \"We didn't compete like we should. We turned the puck (over) on the last four goals. We made poor decisions in the neutral zone. That can't happen.\n\"I understand if we don't have our 'A' game. That doesn't mean we need to be 5-0 in the hole before we start playing.\n\"Tonight, I saw things where we were out of control. It was chaos in our own zone. We just couldn't focus. If you watch the video, we had guys changing on (one) goal while the play was coming in our end. It's unacceptable. We can't play like this. If we want to make the playoffs, this is not the type of performance we need.\"\nAdvertisement The late goals ruined Boston backup goalie Jonas Gustavsson's chance of getting a shutout in his first appearance for the Bruins. It wasn't a case of the 30-year-old Swede needing to be heroic, either: Colorado had only 12 shots through the first two periods and 22 for the game.\nAt the other end, Avalanche goalie Semyon Varlamov allowed five goals on 19 shots before Roy yanked him and sent out Reto Berra. Varlamov was hung out to dry at times, but after his three starts, his save percentage is a horrible .841 — well below the Astrom line — in a shaky start for the Russian considered among the NHL's top goalies.\n\"Varly does not have the start I'm sure he wants,\" Roy said. \"But at the same time, you look at the goal he gave up in the second, no help.\"\nVarlamov didn't try to dodge accountability.\n\"I feel terrible,\" said Varlamov. \"I didn't play well today. Twenty shots, five goals, I have to be better. . . Tomorrow's going to be a new day. I just have to forget about this game and look forward.\"\nThe upcoming stretch will provide a stern test of whether the Avs got the message after a shaky start a year ago put them in a hole they never completely climbed out of. Yet rather than going into the road-dominated stretch with, say, five or six points after the first three games, Colorado has only the two points from the 6-3 win over Dallas on Saturday and the pointless memories of the collapse on opening night against Minnesota and then the loss to the Bruins.\n\"They came out and they had a better jump than we did,\" said Landeskog. \"They ended up getting a couple of quick goals and after that, we started getting impatient with the puck. We started throwing the puck around and we started making bad decisions with the puck, and it definitely ended up costing us.\"\nThe Avalanche are at Anaheim Friday and Los Angeles Sunday.\n\"You at least want to go 2-1 on a three-game homestand, so we have to be better there for sure,\" defenseman Erik Johnson said. \"We have to make this a tough place to play. . . We'll regroup and get better and go on the road and get this thing turned around.\"\nBoston was even worse than the Avalanche on its own season-opening homestand, but the Bruins rebounded Wednesday.\nThe Avalanche failed to take advantage of an early power play after the Bruins' Zdeno Chara was called for holding former Boston teammate Jarome Iginla only 31 seconds into the game. Colorado had the first three shots of the game but rarely had possession of the puck after that, getting outshot 9-2 the rest of the period.\nBoston defenseman Kevan Miller beat a screened Varlamov from the top of the right circle at 5:49 to make it 1-0. Then Varlamov gloved down a Chara shot, but winger Jimmy Hayes got to it and scored at 8:11, putting Boston up by two and again drawing cheers from the many vocal pro-Bruins fans in the seats. (No, it wasn't as noticeable as for Red Wings and Blackhawks appearances, but within shouting distance.)\nIn the second, Tyler Randell tipped an Adam McQuaid shot from the point past Varlamov at 3:46, putting Boston up 3-0. Then after a Tyson Barrie giveaway, Boston's Chris Kelly scored off the odd-man rush to make it 4-0 at 9:30. And Ryan Spooner's goal at 15:32 chased Varlamov. David Krejci scored an empty-netter with 1:22 left.\nThe Avs had scored 10 goals in splitting its first two games but didn't put much pressure on the Gustavsson on Wednesday. Glaringly, Matt Duchene and rookie Mikko Rantanen don't have a point through three games.\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @tfrei", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:12:18.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
