Lows are expected to be 54 and 57. Game-time temperature for Game 2 on Sunday night at Citi Field in New York was 45 degrees.\n“It was freezing,” Bryant said “But when you’re playing in the game you don’t really feel it that much. A lot of it is mental. You don’t like playing in the cold but they have to play in the cold too.”\nIn New York, many of the players wore layers and some featured masks to cover much of their faces while at the plate and in the field. On Monday, both the Cubs and Mets worked out and there were plenty of shorts sleeves and some players wore shorts.\n“When I go out to hit I don’t feel the cold, I’m really focused on trying to hit the ball,” Cubs infielder Javier Baez said. “It was really cold and windy but it doesn’t mean we’re going to stop playing the game.”\nJoe Maddon on Cubs keeping the faith Cubs manager Joe Maddon on keeping the faith.\nCubs manager Joe Maddon on keeping the faith.\nSee more videos Still, Baez, who added that “sometimes you don’t feel your hands when it’s really cold,” will welcome warmer temperatures.\n“I love the heat,” he said. “I’m pretty sure not many people like the cold. I’m one of those.”\nThe Cubs mostly rely on their bats to win games and frigid temperatures can be a hindrance. After bashing baseball all season, they have scratched out a combined three runs on 10 hits during the first two games of the series. While much of the struggles can be attributed to superb Mets pitching, a little heat could help.\n“Preferably for the lineup, of course the guys will feel their hands a little bit better,” Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. “It should work out somewhat better for us offensively. I would like to believe that, but at the end of the day it's always about the other team and your starting pitching. It's always about starting pitching. I'd like to believe with a little warmer weather, our guys are going to have a little better feel at the plate.”\nCubs Game 3 starter Kyle Hendricks sees benefits to both cold and warm temperatures.\n“When it's cold, you can bust guys inside (and) when it's warm, you can warm-up easier,” Hendricks said. “It doesn't matter to me. No matter what the weather is, you've got to make good pitches and keep the ball down. So that's where my focus is.”\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs New York Mets Wrigley Field National League Championship Series Javier Baez Kris Bryant", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56255341/turbine/ct-joe-maddon-on-cubs-keeping-the-faith-20151019", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562559ac/turbine/ct-cubs-hope-bats-warm-up-in-the-heat-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-19T23:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:40:30.239+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
