I think guys that worry about the wrong things rather than focusing on being a good teammate for their team, playing the best that they can play, (because) I think also those things always create more value for every individual player.” \nCase in point: Julio Jones , who recently signed a five-year, $71.25 million extension with the Atlanta Falcons, and has quickly emerged as one of the NFL’s top receivers through three games this season. \n“Julio was a very good player when he came here, he started as a freshman, but he got better and better and better every year that he was here,” Saban said. “And I think the bigger question is how did playing his junior year in college affect his pro career? He might be arguably the best receiver in the NFL, or one of them at least. So how did that negatively impact him?” \nAfter splashing onto the college scene with 924 receiving yards as a true freshman in 2008, and 596 receiving yards as a sophomore, Jones nearly doubled his previous season’s marks with 1,133 receiving yards on 78 catches and seven touchdowns as a junior, propelling him to the No. 6 overall pick in the 2011 NFL draft. \nAlabama’s native Georgians eager to play in Sanford: Dalvin Tomlinson grew up roughly 60 miles southwest of Athens, Georgia. \nThe McDonough native had dreams of one day playing between the famed Sanford Stadium hedges. \nTo say he bled Georgia red as a child wouldn’t be far off. \nBut during his recruiting process, despite being “locked in on Georgia” early, the junior defensive tackle from Henry County (Georgia) elected to leave the state and signed with Alabama as part of a loaded 2012 class. \nThankfully, Tomlinson and 13 of his Crimson Tide teammates will get their chance to play in front of their homestate fans when No. 13 Alabama (3-1, 0-1 SEC) travels to Athens on Saturday for a pivotal matchup with No. 8 Georgia. \n“Growing up, I always wanted to play in Sanford Stadium,” Tomlinson said Tuesday. “It’s always been a dream of mine. So it’s pretty exciting, getting ready to go back home and play at UGA for the first time.” \nDespite a pretty strict 24-hour rule, discussion about this weekend’s game began minutes after the Tide knocked off Louisiana-Monroe last Satuday, with senior safety Geno Matias-Smith (Atlanta) saying he and senior tailback Kenyan Drake (Powder Springs) were already talking about it in the locker room. \n“I was in the locker room talking with Drake about the Georgia game already, because we’re both Georgia guys,” Matias-Smith said Saturday. “We’ve already said that we’ve got to have a great week of practice and 100 percent focus on this, because it’s going to be big.” \nThose conversations have continued throughout the week. \n“We’ve just been talking about how excited we are for the game and the atmosphere,” Tomlinson said. “We remember going back to, like, recruiting days and going to the UGA games and how fun it used to be. So it’s going to be a fun game going back home and playing.” 3 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1KNONcP TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T11:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:20:40.381+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
