She filed for divorce in 2013, but the split wasn’t immediately finalised and she reportedly remains his next of kin, able to make medical decisions on his behalf.\nOdom’s Kardashian connection gained him even wider fame than the two NBA titles he won with the Los Angeles Lakers in 2009 and 2010.\nOdom, who earned Olympic bronze with the USA at the Athens Games, last played in the NBA in 2013.\nOriginally published as Odom regains consciousness", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com.au/basketball/former-nba-champion-lamar-odom-regains-consciousness-according-to-family-representative/story-e6frf3f3-1227572459768", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c205d560131e7ee49a93268f812dddcf", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/148e1b98548b708171b322b0ce834815", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/c6d841b5448af4833a68d42b9221f49b", "http://www.foxsports.com.au/", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-17T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:47:02.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
