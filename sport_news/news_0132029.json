(NMSU photo)\nLAS CRUCES –Larry Beem, New Mexico State’s first All-America golfer and eventually the program’s head coach, died Friday night, the university announced early Sunday morning. It offered no details on the cause of death.\n“Our thoughts and prayer are with the family of Larry Beem,” said NMSU athletic director Mario Moccia said in a statement released by the university. “An All-American and Aggie Hall of Famer in his own right, as well as being a head coach. There’s no doubt we lost an important member of the Aggie golf community.”\nBeem played at NMSU from 1962-64, advancing in his final year to the quarterfinal round of the NCAA Championships. The 1964 NMSU graduate in business administration was inducted into the US Bank/NM State Athletic Hall of Fame in 1990.\nHe was the father of PGA professional Rich Beem, another Aggie Hall of Famer and champion of the 2002 PGA Championship among five pro tour wins.\nAfter a career as a head golf professional and course general manager, Beem returned to his alma mater as head golf coach in 1998 and served for six years before retiring in 2004.\nHe coached Aggies Scott Lieberworth and Jon Babich to three consecutive conference individual championships from 1999-2001, and led the Aggies to consecutive second place team titles in the rugged Big West Conference of the late 90s.\nBeem was a lifetime member of the Sun Country section of the Professional Golfers Association.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/LARRY-BEEM-MENS-GOLF-1962-64-399x600.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-27T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T13:31:14.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
