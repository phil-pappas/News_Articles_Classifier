It's the biggest word in this team,\" Williams said afterward. \"I'm a point guard. I think point guard first. I think pass first. I will never be a shoot-first point guard, because it's not my job. It's not my role.\"\nThere is little doubt that Bishop Ford, which has now won 18 straight games, is one of the hottest teams in the city.

When they were down, I picked them up. It's been that kind of thing all year. ... I just enjoyed watching them celebrate today.\"\nBishop Ford, which led for most of the game, didn't panic when the Flyers (19-6) made a late push.
