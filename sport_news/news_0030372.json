We can start from scratch instead of trying to fix something and we can have a bigger start ramp. \n''And at Walton Park there are toilets and changing rooms and we don't have that at Forrester Park, so that is a huge asset.'' \nThe track's estimated cost is between $250,000 and $300,000 and Heptonstall is confident the club can raise the funds. \nThe track would be a community asset, he said, and not just for the club's use. \n''There will be no excuse for BMX New Zealand to not allow us to hold nationals there. The only issue will be the location, in that Dunedin is so far south.'' \nUltimately, Heptonstall would like lights at the venue so the club can race at night.
