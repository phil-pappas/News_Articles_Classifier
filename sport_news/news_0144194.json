The Super Bowl comes to the second-year, $1.3 billion Bay Area venue in four months for its 50th year celebration. \nHere are five things we learned Sunday: \nSTUFFING THE RUN: Green Bay certainly looked better than its No. 27 ranking stopping the run, shutting down Carlos Hyde and San Francisco's second-ranked rushing offense. \nHyde was held to 20 yards on eight carries, while Reggie Bush was stuffed for no gain trying to go up the middle on third-and-11 in a play call that was immediately scrutinized. \nOn the ensuing drive, James Jones caught a 38-yard pass on the left sideline by barely staying in bounds. Rodgers then scrambled 17 yards to set up John Kuhn's 1-yard scoring burst. \n\"Our defense played lights out,\" McCarthy said. \"I think it's our best performance so far this year. Our ability to stop the run was our starting point and I thought special teams did a heck of a job.\" \nENDING THE SKID: San Francisco beat Green Bay to begin and end the year in both the 2012 and '13 seasons, eliminating the Packers from the playoffs after first spoiling their season openers. \nSo this win might have been a little sweeter, especially with so many cheering Cheeseheads in the crowd. \nMuch has changed since then, including all of the departed defensive personnel for the 49ers — with Patrick Willis, Justin Smith retiring and Aldon Smith's release before he recently joined the Oakland Raiders. \n\"You look at that defense, they've had some guys retire over the last year, they've had some guys go other places, so it's a different opponent,\" Rodgers said. \nKISS THE BICEPS: Not-so-subtle Clay Matthews made his mark on this game with a sack and some smack. \nWhen he sacked Kaepernick for an 8-yard loss in the third quarter, the animated linebacker kissed his biceps Kaepernick-style. \nFOX cameras picked him up on the mic saying, \"You ain't Russell Wilson, bro,\" in reference to Seattle's QB. \n\"Fortunately, we were able to wear them down both offensively and defensively and get a big road win,\" Matthews said. \nKAP UNDER PRESSURE: A week after throwing a career-high four interceptions, Kaepernick was under pressure all day again, throwing another pick and taking six sacks. \nHe now has 14 sacks through four games after being sacked 52 times last season, second-most in the league behind Carolina's Blake Bortles with 55. \nSan Francisco (1-3) has scored just 28 points over three games while giving up 107. The quarterback was booed in the fourth quarter. \n\"We're an offense that can run the ball and throw the ball,\" 49ers wide receiver Torrey Smith said. \"We're not doing either well right now.\" \nFRUSTRATION MOUNTS: 49ers coach Jim Tomsula isn't ready for an offensive overhaul or switch to backup quarterback Blaine Gabbert, but everybody involved is feeling the heat of an ineffective scheme and a quarterback who admittedly is being cautious with his throws to avoid further mistakes. \nKaepernick, who had played some of his best games against the Packers, went 13 for 25 for 160 yards and a 55.4 passer rating. \n\"We've got to collectively on offense have 11 guys going in the same direction,\" coach Jim Tomsula said. \"It's not fractured. There's a little frustration there but not fractured at all.\" \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WSOC-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:18:46.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
