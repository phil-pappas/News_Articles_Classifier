Goodfellow managed a fine cap to their prep careers. \nThe senior duo shot a two-round total of 154 and tied for ninth at the Iowa High School Athletic Association Class 4A state golf tournament Saturday at Elmcrest Country Club. \n“I can’t complain,” said Thrune, who tied for 31st at last year’s state meet. “I worked hard for it with a lot of hours during the summer. That was the goal was to come in and put up some numbers and have a good finish. I’ll take it.” \nThrune has come a long way since his parents, Brent and Katie Thrune, introduced him to golf as a youth. The work was more a labor of love for the game. \n“Ever since I was four years old I would come out with my parents,” Thrune said. “I was more worried about driving the golf cart and eating snacks than playing golf. My parents instilled it early in me and I loved it ever since.” \nThrune was an all-conference performer, who was a district medalist. He also helped Linn-Mar place fifth with a 635 total, which was higher than last year. \n“He’s had a great season,” Kahler said. “Anytime you get in the top-10 that is a really good finish. \n“I know he wanted higher. Boy, he competed for two days and that’s all you ask.” \nKahler replaced Bill Hoefle as leader for the Lions toward the end of the season. Linn-Mar Athletics Director Scott Mahmens declined to comment when contacted by The Gazette. \nGoodfellow made his first state appearance and carded consecutive rounds of 77. He wasn’t thrilled with the finish, but understood many good golfers didn’t reach the field. \n“I finished top-10 and a lot of players didn’t do that,” Goodfellow said. “You want to play your best, but it’s still good to be here.” \nThrune suffered a slow start, scoring a bogey on each of his first three holes. He settled down, making the turn with six consecutive pars. He followed an opening-round 74 with an 80 on a day where a steady wind and fast greens made things difficult. \n“It was hit the greens (and) fairways,” Thrune said. “Just no mistakes. Everything was playing safe. Try to get pars and move on to next hole. It was all about avoiding big numbers.” \nGoodfellow said he didn’t keep the ball below the hole on greens, but still recorded three birdies, including the par-3 No. 8 and par-5 No. 15. He had a bitter feeling with a bigger score on his final hole. \n“It was a good year,” said Goodfellow, who is unsure where he will golf in college. “I didn’t end it the way I want it with a double on the last hole. it was still a fun year.” \nWest Coach Don Bristow witnessed the strides Goodfellow made each season. Bristow lauded the result. \n“He’s been really great,” Bristow said of Goodfellow. “You’ve seen him get better and better every year. I’m happy to have him the last four years. I hate to see him leave.” \nCedar Rapids Washington had state title aspirations after getting last in the 2013 field. The Warriors were sixth at 636. They have improved and the bar is higher than ever for them. \n“Now we have expectations every year of where we should be,” Washington co-head coach Chris James said. “That’s what we want. \n“It wasn’t what we wanted to end this year, but I’m proud of the way the kids battled. It was a tough golf course. It wasn’t easy for anybody.” \nSophomore Alex Slattery shot 74 Saturday and tied for 16th with 158. The Warriors return four of their top players, including Frank Lindwall, who tied for 10th as a freshman in 2013. \n“It will be interesting,” James said. “This will hurt a little bit I’m sure ... Maybe that will be motivation for next year.” \nWaukee had managed four top-two team finishes since 2010, winning the title that season and again last year. Waukee defended its crown with a 616, topping runner-up Ankeny Centennial by eight. \nWest Des Moines Valley junior Ben Epperly fired a 2-under 68 for a total of 142 to claim medalist honors. He came in six shots better than Waukee teammates Tripp Kinney and Andrew O’Brien, who tied with the second-best score of 148. \nHost Cedar Rapids Xavier was 10th with 653. \nl Comments: (319) 368-8679; kj.pilcher@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:39:16.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
