But the Broncos would likely be bringing a much higher ranking to Maverik Stadium if they had held a late lead against BYU on Sept. 12.\nThe Cougars beat Boise, 35-24, on Tanner Mangum's 35-yard touchdown pass on fourth down with 45 seconds remaining. An interception return for a touchdown with 30 seconds left accounted for the final score.\nBoise quarterback Ryan Finley was intercepted three times in the loss. He was also sacked four times. As a team, the Broncos were penalized 11 times for 76 yards.\n  \"We learned from that game,\" coach Bryan Harsin said. \"Obviously we didn't win, but we got a lot of lessons and I think we learned from them.\"\nAfter the loss, Finley suffered a fractured ankle against Idaho State. Freshman Brett Rypien has quarterbacked Boise to four lopsided wins over Virginia (56-14), Hawaii (55-0) and Colorado State (41-10) and the Bengals (52-0).\n\"We've played cleaner than we did against BYU,\" Harsin said. \"We've been better with turnovers than we were in that game. … We've come together as a team [and] gotten a little more confident as the year has gone on.\"\n\nWells delivers for students\nUtah State football coach Matt Wells started work a little early on Monday.\nWells arrived on campus at 6:45 a.m. in order to greet \"a long line\" of students who wanted to make sure they secured Boise State tickets.\nAlong with athletic director John Hartwell, Wells passed out doughnuts and visited with the students for 30 minutes.\n\"It was good,\" Wells said. \"… The job they do is very much appreciated. They are a big part of having a home-field advantage. Hopefully, they will be exactly what they always are — loud.\"\nConstruction at Maverik Stadium this season has reduced seating capacity to 22,059. School officials expect a sellout against Boise State, although 500 tickets remained Monday morning.\nThe Aggies have played two home games this season. They drew 21,209 for the opener against Southern Utah. \nTheir game against Colorado State two weeks ago was sold out.\n\nAggies get advice on using social media \nUtah State players are not forbidden from using social media such as Twitter, Wells said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:38:19.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
