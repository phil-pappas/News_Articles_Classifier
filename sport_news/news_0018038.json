I don’t think he meant any harm,” Cooper said. \n“All he was getting at from my understanding was the commentating needs to lay off some of the boys. \n“But we are all big boys and I am sure we can handle it.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:44:47.998+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
