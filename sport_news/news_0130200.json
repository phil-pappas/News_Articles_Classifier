In what appeared to be a pre-emptive move after a 3-1 home loss to Southampton, Mourinho reminded Roman Abramovich, the team’s owner, that the club has a reputation for discarding managers. “If the club wants to sack me, they have to sack me, because I’m not running away from my responsibility, my team,” Mourinho said.\n■ Barcelona lost, 2-1, at Sevilla, missing the chance to take the provisional lead in the Spanish league.

The team is led by four veterans: goalkeeper Tim Howard, striker Clint Dempsey, midfielder Michael Bradley and defender DaMarcus Beasley. (REUTERS)\nLoading...
