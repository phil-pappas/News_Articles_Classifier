Talks are going on in a very cordial relationship. They have been longstanding partners. We are addressing their concerns and they are our concerns,” said Shukla. \n“We will work it out and whatever solution we will find, we will let you know. We keep negotiating with our sponsors, so this is not a new thing,” he added. \nPepsiCo had earlier notified the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), expressing its intention to withdraw from the IPL as title sponsor because of the controversy surrounding the spot-fixing case.
