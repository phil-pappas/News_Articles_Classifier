File photo / Union Democrat. The dead will rise again this Saturday for the fifth annual Walking Dead Sonora, Zombie Walk and Food Drive. People dressed as reanimated corpses will fill Courthouse Square and roam the streets of downtown Sonora from 4 to 7 p.m. Games, music and a newly added dance-off contest are among the family friendly activities offered at the popular free event held each year close to Halloween. “I’m very happy to have made it this far,” said organizer Michael Miller of the event’s continued success. “There’s definitely been an increase in attendance each year, like any apocalypse would grow.” The hit TV show “The Walking Dead” has inspired a recent boom in popularity for the undead creatures that have been a part of American pop culture since George A. Romero’s classic 1968 horror film “The Night of the Living Dead.” Miller started the event in 2011 after seeing a similar “zombie walk” in Merced. The event has grown from year to year, now typically attracting between 300 and 350 people. The annual event also serves as a food drive for the Tuolumne County Humane Society and Amador-Tuolumne Community Action Agency Food Bank. People are encouraged to bring human or pet food items to donate. “That’s the main cause, other than fun,” Miller said. Miller has seen people of all ages, some as young as 2, donning zombie costumes at the event. He encourages parents to be aware of what their children can handle, as some could find the costumes scary. Those who arrive in their own costumes will be eligible for a costume contest with categories for “Most Frightful,”“Most Original/Creative” and “Best Character.” Winners of the costume contest will receive a prize pack that includes vouchers for bowling and arcade tokens at Black Oak Casino Resort, two tickets to Pirates of Emerson Haunted Theme Park in Pleasanton, two tickets for the All Hallows Fantasy Faire in Sonora and two tickets to see the stage production of “Night of the Living Dead” at Playhouse Merced. This year’s new dance-off contest will also feature prizes. A makeup booth opening at 2 p.m. in Courthouse Square will be available for people to get dressed up in “basic zombie makeup,” though they will not be eligible for the contest. Miller said downtown Sonora merchants have told him the walk has proved to be good for business in past years. “A lot of local merchants are on board and really happy we bring people downtown,” he said. “It’s unique and really stands out on it’s own as a downtown Sonora event.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:03:37.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
