There's one thing I always wanted to do, to walk up to a customer and not have to hold my breath,\" says bar worker Willie Mackie. \"I finally get a chance to do that.\"\nIn a City Hall progress report, statistics show the air quality in bars and casino has improved from \"hazardous\" to \"good.\"\nThe report also indicates the ban has grown more popular over time. Before the change went into effect, a poll showed 56% of New Orleans residents favored the ban. That number has jumped to 64%.\nSays singer Vanessa Nieman, \"Not breathing in smoke every time a take a deep breath between phrases is a really great thing.\" She adds, \"a bonus is that you don't go home smelling like an ashtray.\"\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
