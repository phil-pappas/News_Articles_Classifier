Emery (287 NHL games) stood out in a sea of black as he played for Philadelphia Flyers the past two seasons and still had the white-and orange pads, blocker and glove.\nBut this one wasn’t about the goaltenders.\nIt was about total domination in all areas of the game by the Reign, who return 15 players from that championship team.\nThe Edmonton Oilers-affiliated Condors had no answer for the Reign anywhere on the ice. Reign players seemed to block shots at will and forced numerous turnovers throughout the game.\nVincent LoVerde, who started his pro career with Ontario in the ECHL in 2011, staked the Reign to a 1-0 lead nine minutes into the first when his shot from the right point sailed through traffic and past Laurent Brossoit.\nScott Saborin scored on a follow-up shot off an odd-man rush with two minutes left in the period for a 2-0 lead.\nThe Reign put the game away in the second.\nKris Newbury scored an easy goal off a turnover at 10:20, and got a power-play goal at 13:48, and Paul Bissonnette, known more for penalty minutes than goals, scored off a turnover at 14:48.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:31:32.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
