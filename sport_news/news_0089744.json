Choo was simply one of the best players in MLB after the All-Star Break. While his play on the field was extraordinary, it was actually his wife that spurred him on. \nChoo's wife, Won Mi Ha, did what any good spouse would do: She gave her husband words of encouragement during the All-Star Break. \n\"She is talking to me and she is saying that everybody's life is like a building,\" Choo said back in August. \"She is telling me that you spend your life building this building. Some people build things very quickly and very tall, but it might not have a solid foundation. Some people might build their building on sand and when it shakes, it falls. And she is telling me that I've built a very strong building, that, like everyone, it's going to get shaken, but it is built on a solid foundation and that I shouldn't try to change that. It will stand up sturdy.\" \nThose words helped Choo to regain his focus and confidence which led to him having the sixth best OPS (1.016) post-ASB. He was also top five in batting average (.343) and OBP (.455). It was such an 180-degree difference from the first half that I saw one person on Twitter suggest Won Mi Ha is the Rangers MVP for 2015. \n2015 Year in Review \nFor the season, Choo finished with a slash line of .276/.375/.463. On the team, he was second in OBP, tied for third in slugging, second in OPS, third in home runs, and first in walks and (welp) strikeouts. Among position players, Choo finished second in bWAR with 3.5 wins. His .838 OPS was actually .001 higher than his career average and he tied his career high with 22 home runs. \nChoo's wRC of 127 was seventh among right fielders in MLB and he even outpaced players like Jason Heyward, Carlos Beltran, Josh Reddick, Carlos Gonzalez and Matt Kemp. According to Fangraphs Defensive rating, Choo was 15th at his position, though he fared better than the likes of Nick Markakis, Jay Bruce, Ryan Braun, Nelson Cruz and Jose Bautista. He was also above-average in baserunning as he finished 11th among RFs according to Fangraphs. \n2016 and Beyond \nMidway through the season, I was hoping that Choo would be able to salvage his season in an effort to recoup some of his trade value to allow Jon Daniels and the front office to shed his payroll in the offseason. Never in my wildest dreams did I foresee the 32-year-old outfielder having the season that he did. \nSo what does the future hold for Choo as a Texas Ranger? \nI believe he is here to stay. He is still owed $102 million which will pay him through his age 37 season, but if he can be a 2.5-3 win player, Choo can produce for at least the next couple of years. To date, in terms of value, he has been worth $28.8 million according to Fangraphs as a Ranger which is $800,000 more than the team has paid him. \nThe Rangers signed Choo to be an important cog and in 2015, he was a major part of the success. His ability to be patient at the plate does not diminish with age so look for him to be a Ranger for years to come. \nEddie Middlebrook can be found on Twitter @emiddlebrook .
