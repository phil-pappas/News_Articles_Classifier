At the time of the stoppage, it was announced that the game would be resumed at 7 p.m. Saturday night. Through the early going, Bourne survived three turnovers via fumbles as the rains started to fall as the captains were at the pre-game coin toss and continued throughout the contest until the officials halted play. Case was not immune to giveaways as they threw a screen-pass interception by Bourne defensive lineman Tyler Griffin in the first quarter and fumbled the ball away to Bourne as the final lightning strike was happening. Despite the miscues and sloppy conditions, there were a number of big plays by both offenses that accounted for the Bourne lead. In the opening drive, the Canalmen started the track meet with a 60-yard scamper by senior quarterback Tyler Rondeau advancing the ball to the Case 34-yard-line. Five plays later, Jacob Haypenny, who rushed for 78 yards before the games was stopped, went into the end zone with the game’s first tally on a three-yard run up the middle. Haypenny rushed for the 2-point conversion to give Bourne an 8-0 lead. The Canalmen never trailed after that. Even though a 99-yard run by Case tailback Aidan Silva would not get the visitors tied as the Bourne defense stuffed the two-point conversion attempt. That score was set up when Bourne’s Rondeau had the ball stripped from his grasp as he was heading into the end zone that would have given Bourne a 14-0 lead at the time. Rondeau came back and made up for the miscue when he finished off an eight-play, 88-yard drive that was interrupted by the game’s first lightning delay. The Canalmen had stopped a Case drive on their own 12-yard line with 3:23 remaining in the opening quarter and Rondeau immediately got Bourne out from the shadow of its own goalpost with another long run, this time 46 yards to the Cardinals’ 44 yard line. Rondeau had rushed for 117 yards on five carries when the game was halted Three plays later Bourne was on the Case 28 yard line when lightning struck for the first time delaying the game a mandatory 30 minutes according to Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association rules. When play resumed, it took the Canalmen three plays for Rondeau to score to make it 14-6 as the first quarter ended. Neither team did much damage in the second quarter as the defenses stepped up until the second lightning strike stopped the game.
