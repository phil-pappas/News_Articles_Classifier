Jay Nixon have made a friendly wager over the 2015 World Series matchup between the Mets and the Kansas City Royals. \nIf the Mets win, Gov. Jay Nixon will wear a Mets jersey to work for a full day. If the Royals win, Gov. Andrew Cuomo will do the same wearing a Royals jersey. \nThe bet also includes each governor sending to the other various home state-crafted food and spirits, including Kansas City ribs and hot Italian sausage from Central New York. \nThe first game of the best-of-seven series will be played in Kansas City on Tuesday. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
