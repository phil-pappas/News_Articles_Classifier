Hobart added 11 carries for 100 yards as the Wildcats finished with 419 of their 473 yards on the ground. \n“We wanted to burn as much clock as we could tonight,” Hayden coach Bill Arnold said. “That’s one of the most explosive offenses you’ll see in Kansas.” \nHayden quickly set the tone after stopping Central’s opening drive on three plays. The Wildcats marched 71 yards, running out of their Wing T formation on 11 of the 12 plays. Gaito capped the drive with the first of his three short touchdown runs. \nAndover Central recovered to take its only lead at 7-6 on a 27-yard pass from Huslig to Isaac Anthemides. Huslig finished 11-for-17 passing for 211 yards and four touchdowns. \nBut the Wilidcats recovered two Huslig fumbles, including Caden Campion’s recovery at the Hayden 8 that preserved a 12-7 lead. Huslig scrambled for what appeared to be a first down on third and 15 from Hayden’s 20. But the ball came free and Campion pounced on it. \nHayden then went on a 13-play, 92-yard drive — the lone pass was a 38-yard completion from Dallas Crittenden to Schumacher — and scored on Gaito’s 3-yard run for a 20-7 halftime lead. \n“I think it meant the world,” Arnold said of the turnover and ensuing touchdown march. “It said, one, we’re going to play to the whistle. \n“If there aren’t 11 guys flying to the ball right there, we’re not getting that thing.” \nHayden went 80 yards in nine plays to start the third quarter, with Gaito’s third touchdown providing a 26-7 lead. Huslig mishandled a snap two plays later and Hayden’s Nicolas Desch recovered at Central’s 28, leading to a 1-yard run by Schumacher. \nSchumacher added a nifty touchdown run early in the fourth quarter to put Hayden up 38-14. On fourth and 6 from Central’s 28, he broke a tackle near the line of scrimmage and spun away from another defender on his way to the end zone. \nThat enabled the Wildcats to withstand two fourth-quarter touchdown passes from Huslig to Parnell. Parnell finished with four receptions for 127 yards. \n“That’s a powerful offense we played,” said Schumacher, who also had a 32-yard touchdown run in the first half. “But our offensive line really controlled their D-line and made good holes for me and the other guys.” \nHayden (6-1, 1-0) 6 14 12 6 — 38 \nAndover Ce.
