Players cannot switch models during the round. The penalty is known as a one-hole adjustment to the match. \nHowever, the referee was wrongly told that Mickelson was disqualified from the hole for using a different ball. In fact, Mickelson should have been allowed to finish the hole and then the adjustment would be made. \nJason Day , playing with Adam Scott , made birdie and won the hole to go 1 up. And then the one-hole adjustment made it 2 up.
