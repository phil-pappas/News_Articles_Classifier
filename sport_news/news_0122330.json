In just a few hours cans of red and white paint will be in use as one of college football's coolest rivalry trophies heads back to UNLV.The Fremont Cannon is a lot more than just a traveling trophy for the winner of the UNLV-UNR game. The cannon has one of the country's most-impressive histories as the always-present symbol at the now-annual \"Battle for Nevada\". The tradition of awarding the cannon to the winner of the game started more than four decades ago.And as of this weekend, it's back in rebel hands.Last time the Rebels won the math-up was two years ago in 2013, where students were able to see it as it was shown off around campus. Saturday, surely out for revenge, the Rebels won it back, winning the game 23 to 17.The cannon has been a symbol of bragging rights between the two Nevada schools for 46 years. Valued at more than $10,000, the trophy is considered one of the most expensive and heavieset symbols of rivalry in all of college football. Another fun fact --the Fremont Cannon is one of only two cannon prizes in all rivalry games, along with Illinois vs. Purdue. The Wolf Pack held the cannon first because they had beaten the rebels 30-28 in the first game of the series on Thanksgiving Day 1969. Today -- the cannon will be taken around UNLV'S campus this morning for a painting ceremony.It'll move from Lied Athletic Complex at 11 A.M. to the student union, where the red paint will be sprayed on the cannon around 11:15.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T16:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:40:38.943+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
