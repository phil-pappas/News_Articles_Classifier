That’s going to benefit us down the road and especially next year.” \nThe Crusaders, now 8-0 overall, are also 3-0 in GICAA Division II West Region play, while needing a win over CrossPointe (7-2, 2-1) to clinch the No. 1 seed in the state playoffs. \nCrossPointe is in a win-or-go-home situation heading into this week, with only two teams from each region advancing to the state playoffs. While currently tied with Lafayette Christian for the final playoff berth in the West, CrossPointe’s only chance to advance to state is by forcing a three-way tie for first. Lafayette’s victory over CrossPointe earlier this year is a head-to-head tiebreaker. \n“We want to keep things in our hands,” Frantz said. “I think of it as fun when you play against a friend. You want to beat him. Jeff and I talk all the time. I’m sure he’s telling his kids to let it all out this week.” \nCentral looked to be in playoff mode on Friday, scoring three times in the opening four minutes starting with a quick 55-yard touchdown pass from Jared Farlow to Deion Blackmon. Blackmon then scored on the Crusaders second possession with a 9-yard run. \nBy the time that Bailey Todd and Marcellous Giles added scores from 25 and 6 yards out, the Crusaders were well in control, leading 38-0 at halftime. \nCaleb Ruck came on at quarterback and Chris Nugent at running back for Farlow and Blackmon, respectively in the second half under a running clock. \nNugent and Farlow had touchdowns after halftime and Farlow picked up his 13th interception of the year. \nJesse Parkerson, Jared Ruck and Jordan Fuller dominated the line of scrimmage while also playing solid defensively with Avery Staples, Colt Dooley, Caleb London, Dustin Terrell and McKinley Reese.
