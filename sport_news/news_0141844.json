(Originally published by the Daily News on October 26, 2005.)\nAt the end, as the doctors tried to give Wellington Mara a few more weeks or months, finally just tried to give him one more Sunday, he was in a room at Memorial Sloan-Kettering. This was before they sent him home to his wife Ann for good. His great heart was still as strong as ever, as strong as his faith. But Mr. Mara was 89 and growing weaker after a long and terrible season of radiation. So now all who loved him prepared themselves for the end of a truly wonderful life, in his sport and his city and his time.\nWELLINGTON MARA DIES AT 89 OF CANCER IN 2005\nDuring the days, there was always family with him, some ex-Giant like Frank Gifford stopping by. The long nights were different. For so many of the nights in the quiet of the hospital room, for almost all of them, Mr. Mara's company was Ronnie Barnes, now the vice president of medical services for the Giants, once the Giants' trainer, someone who had first worked for the Giants as a student intern in 1976.\nHe was only there for anyone who had ever worked for Mr. Mara, or known him. Ronnie Barnes was every head coach or assistant coach or player or front-office man, every scout or secretary or broadcaster. Or intern. He was all of them.\nHe was a Giant, which meant Barnes was family. Mr. Mara was the head of that family the same as he was his own, his 11 children and his 40 grandchildren. This is not a way of making him more grand in death than he was in life, something more than he was. That is impossible, anyway. No, this is the truth about Wellington Mara's life around the New York Giants, what turned out to be his whole life, starting on that first Sunday in October of 1925, the Giants against the Frankford Yellow Jackets at the Polo Grounds. Family was family, whether it was Frank Gifford or Chuckin' Charlie Conerly or Sam Huff or Kyle Rote or Tittle or Summerall, whether it was Phil Simms or Lawrence Taylor or Bill Parcells. Or the kid, Eli Manning.\nFamily was family. Ronnie Barnes, out of Wilson, North Carolina, the first African-American graduate of the Sports Medicine Department at East Carolina, was family. He was the same as Mr. Mara. That means a Giant for life.\nNew York Daily News New York Daily News cover on October 26, 2005. New York Daily News New York Daily News article one Wellington Mara's death. New York Daily News New York Daily News article one Wellington Mara's death. Previous Next Enlarge Nobody asked Ronnie Barnes to spend these nights in the hospital. He wanted to be there. He was 24 when he first came to the Giants. Then he was an assistant trainer and before long he was one of the most respected figures in his field. The Ronnie Barnes African-American Resource Center is now part of the Joyner Library at East Carolina. He has written books on sports medicine. It all started because Mr. Mara and the Giants gave him a chance, the same kind of chance Parcells has always talked about.\nRonnie Barnes, a Giant for life, would be there now for Wellington Mara.\nThe old man would go to sleep with his rosary beads in his hands, and sometimes he would awaken in the night. He knew he wasn't alone, because Ronnie Barnes was across the room.\n\"Ronnie,\" Mr. Mara would say. \"Come talk to me.\"\nBarnes would bring a chair over next to the bed, and the two of them would talk about the Giants until Mr. Mara went back to sleep.\nMr. Mara went home to Rye last Friday. Nothing more to be done at Sloan-Kettering. Ann Mara woke her husband early Sunday evening after Eli Manning had brought the Giants down the field to beat the Broncos in the last 10 seconds and told him that 80 years after that first Sunday against the Yellow Jackets, his team had won the game. After a lifetime of Sundays, he had left a winner.\nLinda Cataffo Giants owner Wellington Mara at the N.Y.Giants Mini-Camp at Giants Stadium. He was the last great sportsman. We measure owners differently now, in championships and profit and headlines and even face time. Others have won more than the Giants. Certainly other owners have made more money. There was never a better owner than this because there was never a better man even in bad times. He honored his team and his league. And there was never anyone who loved a team like this, or ever spent more time around one, from that first Sunday at the Polo Grounds after Mass with his father Tim and brother Jack at Our Lady of Esperanza on Riverside Drive. It is almost impossible to get your mind around this kind of career, in any kind of business. Eighty years a Giant.\n\"Sundays are the same for me now as they were that first Sunday,\" he said to me a few years ago. \"I've always thought of them as family gatherings.\"\nThe last time I saw Mr. Mara was at a Boston College dinner at the Waldorf in April. I attended BC back in the '70s with John Mara, who runs the Giants now. Since then, more Maras than you could ever count have passed through our school. So of course if it was a big night for BC in New York, Mr. Mara was there, Ann Mara at his side. We all knew he had been fighting cancer for a while, but on this night, in his tuxedo, he looked terrific. Like Cary Grant, I told him.\nHe frowned at that and pulled at his collar and said, \"I'd rather be at a game.\"\n\"It's not football season, Mr. M.\"\n\"Any kind of game,\" he said, and then he was talking about Eli Manning, and the way he had finished his rookie year. Wellington Mara winked that night and said, \"That young man is my future.\"\nMike Albans Owner Wellington Mara at Giants practice at Giants Stadium in the Meadowlands, N.J. As much as he loved to talk about the old days, as much as he loved old Giants, he was always looking ahead, always wanting to talk about next season, even as the seasons began to dwindle to a precious few. He was still here. Still the head of the family. Still the Giants. The Celtics kept getting sold, the Yankees changed hands a lot before George Steinbrenner. It was the same with the Montreal Canadiens, another of the most famous brands of sports. And the Knicks and Rangers and the Garden.\nThe Giants were still the Mara family. Even when the late Tim Mara, Jack Mara's son, sold his share of the team to Robert Tisch, Mr. Mara still had his half. In his heart, it was still the family business. He was still at training camp and practice every day until his health finally took a bad left turn halfway through this year. The ball boy of Oct. 18, 1925, one who would make it all the way to the Hall of Fame, never lost the thrill of being on the field, being as close as he could be to the Giants.\n\"I always thought of myself as a football guy,\" he said once.\nGiant for life. He is survived by the former Ann Mumm and his children and his grandchildren and the amazing family that is the New York Giants. His legacy is so much more than championships and Super Bowls and the way the Giants helped carry a sport. It is a lifetime of grace and decency. No one in his sport was loved more than he was. No one inspired more loyalty. No one had more friends. Ronnie Barnes was one of them, and all of them. Two Giants in that hospital room, for life.\nmike@lupica.com\nTags: archives", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:59:03.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
