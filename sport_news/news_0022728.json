If opinion polls are correct, the ruling Civic Platform (PO), a pro-market, centre-right grouping in power for the past eight years, will lose to the conservative Law and Justice opposition party (PiS), run by the twin brother of late president Lech Kaczynski, Jaroslaw. Distrustful of the EU and an advocate of a strong NATO hand in dealing with Moscow, PiS opposes joining the euro zone in the near future, promises more welfare spending on the poor and wants banks subject to new taxation. â€” Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:02:03.875+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
