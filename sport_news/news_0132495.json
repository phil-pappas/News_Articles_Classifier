There's no need for that -- it's below the belt.\n\"It's a job we're in and we've had similar incidents over the years. We're accustomed to it now.\"\nBailey has appeared as a witness in betting-related corruption hearings against local jockeys and has been unpopular with some trainers for his hard-line anti-doping stance.\nLocal governing body Racing Victoria said it had assigned extra security at his house.\n\"Terry Bailey is one tough cookie,\" Victoria state's racing minister Martin Pakula told local media.\n\"Of course he'll be concerned for the safety of his family and he'll be concerned about this incident, but if I know Terry Bailey, those people that might want to deter him or racing integrity officials from doing their job and doing it properly, will be sadly disappointed.\" (Reporting by Ian Ransom, editing by Sudipto Ganguly)\nSports & Recreation Society & Culture Terry Bailey Melbourne Cup   417/68182   702/2272  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T11:36:25.877+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
