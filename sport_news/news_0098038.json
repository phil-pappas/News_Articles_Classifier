De Villiers returned home form the Rugby World Cup Monday after breaking his jaw in the Springboks’ 46-6 victory over Samoa Saturday. It was the latest in a series of injury setbacks for the 34-year-old center, who has since announced his retirement from test rugby. It went well with the operation. He had his wisdom teeth removed and a plate inserted in the jaw,” Springboks doctor Craig Roberts said. De Villiers said he hoped to return to England within a fortnight to support his teammates at the tournament. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:30:09.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
