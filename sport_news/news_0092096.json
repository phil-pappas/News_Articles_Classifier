Michael came in a trade with Seattle three weeks ago. \nRandle had 85 yards on his first three carries, but just 2 on his final 11 runs last weekend against Atlanta. Dallas couldn't hold a two-touchdown lead in a 39-28 loss. \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
