With one week to play in the regular season, St. Louis, Toronto and the Texas Rangers each had a magic number of five attached to their name.\nThe Cardinals have been the best team in the majors all year, an annual study in resilience that we should come to expect at this point. Toronto puts on nightly displays of power that have lifted the Blue Jays past Kansas City to the best record in the A.L. And then there were those Rangers, who had emerged from the wreckage of April to surprise all of us and take charge of the A.L. West.\nWell, this is what happens in the final week of the major league season. It's what makes the game so great for everyone, so terrifying for many.\nCheck those standings today and the Cards and the Blue Jays (and the Dodgers) all have a two next to their names. They could all clinch division titles tonight. The Rangers are still sitting on five. The Astros are charging and the Angels are, literally, coming.\nA three-game losing streak in the middle of a season doesn't always amount to much. This one does.\nHaving lost to the Astros' Cy Young candidate, Dallas Keuchel, and the Tigers' former Cy Young winner, Justin Verlander, the Rangers turn to their ace for hope tonight. Cole Hamels was brought here for nights like this (even if the GM and everyone else thought those nights would come in 2016 and beyond).\nHouston, which seemed so lost in dropping four straight to the Rangers here two weeks ago, was 4 1/2 back after losing at home to Texas Friday night. You could see the air leaking out of that Astro balloon, so many young players squeezing those bats in their first taste of pennant pressure.\nOr so we thought.\nThe Astros have won three straight since that night. So have the Angels despite the fact manager Mike Scioscia helped carry his closer, Huston Street, off the field Saturday night.\nNow Texas' lead is a mere 1 1/2 on Houston, two on LA. The Angels come to town Thursday knowing that no matter what happens tonight and tomorrow -- even worst case scenario for them where they lose to Oakland twice and the Rangers beat Detroit twice -- they will have a chance to catch the Rangers this weekend.\nAre the Rangers choking?\nNo. They are slipping. They are doing what baseball teams do in September, even really good teams.\nDid you see the Pirates' 3-0 loss to St. Louis Monday, a game that almost certainly means the Pirates will be forced to go the wild card route for the third time in four years? No shame in losing to the Cardinals, of course. But in a 3-0 game where St. Louis scored all of its runs in the ninth inning, the Cardinals stranded two runners.\nThe Pirates stranded 16.\nAgain, it's a great game and a frustrating, terrifying game at the same time. It's not the NBA where the team with the star players wins. Last-place teams can get a well-pitched game and a couple of timely hits and beat the best.\nOr the Rangers can load the bases with no outs in the fourth inning and let Verlander off the ropes by stranding all three.\nIt happens. It's why we watch. And, for now, it's why Rangers games are going to remain meaningful right into the final weekend.\nTwitter: @TimCowlishaw.\nOn Twitter:\n @TimCowlishaw", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/TimCowlishaw"], "published": "2015-09-29T20:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:12:38.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
