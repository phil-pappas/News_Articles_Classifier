Smith rushed for 19 yards and passed for 98 yards in the 27-20 loss to the Maroons. Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 6:00 am Danville hopes are finished BY CHAD DARE cdare@dancomnews.com Commercial-News.com \nDANVILLE — Caleb Griffin’s onside kick attempt in the final minutes bounced twice before hitting off Champaign Central’s Jack Tuftee, the ball was just sitting there for a second for anyone to grab before Central’s Carr Hess fell on top of it. \nThat play basically summarized Friday’s Big 12 Conference game and the Danville season —- so close, but yet so far away. \nCentral, rated No. 9 in Class 5A, held on for a 27-20 victory over Danville at Tommy Stewart Field. \n“We were close,’’ Danville junior quarterback Quentin Smith said. “All we had to do was to finish the game.’’ \nThe loss knocks the Vikings out of the playoff picture as they fall to 2-5 overall and 1-3 in the Big 12 Conference. Four of the five losses for Danville were against state-ranked teams and all five have been by one touchdown. \n“It’s frustrating that we didn’t get it done on one or two other occasions,’’ Luke said. “It’s tough on the kids. They are emotional and they should be. They know that they are a good team, and they are hurting because of not winning a couple more games. \n“That’s why I know we are going to be pretty good in the future — because these kids do care.’’ \nDanville, which scored first, had a 10-6 lead midway through the second quarter, but Central (5-1 overall, 3-1 in the Big 12) scored in the final minute of the first half on a 18-yard run by Josh Parker to take a 13-10 halftime lead. \nParker finished with a team-high 93 rushing yards on 14 attempts as the Maroons wound up with 297 rushing yards on 46 carries. \n“It was a battle out there,’’ said Danville senior linebacker Jaylen Ross, who had a a big 10-yard touchdown reception with 2 minutes, 22 seconds left in the game. “This one hurts, because it’s my senior year, and I wanted to finish strong. \n“I was really looking forward to winning this game and then losing by a touchdown again, just makes it worst.’’ \nRoss said the Vikings had a good defensive game plan for the Maroons, but they came up short a little in execution. \nCentral gained the vast majority of its yards on plays on either off-tackle plays or runs just outside of the tackles. \n“We knew we had to control the edges, and we just couldn’t get it done,’’ he said. “That’s partially my fault, I should have been coming off the edge a little better.’’ \nAccording to Luke, that has been a problem all season for the Danville defense. \n“I actually think we are getting better there,’’ said Luke, pointing out the Ross has just been playing that spot in the last few weeks. “Sometimes, it’s a process. We want it to get better a little faster than what it has, but it is what it is. We are just going to keep working at it.’’ \nThat’s also how Luke is viewing the final two weeks of the season, with a home game against Bloomington next Friday and the season finale at Urbana on Oct. 23. \n“As I told our coaches, we are just a step away,’’ Luke said. “We have to keep working at it. \n“We will have all the same kids back next year, and we just have to keep getting better.’’ \nThe Vikings tied the game at 13-13 early in the third quarter on a 22-yard field goal by Griffin, who also made a 29-yarder in the second quarter. \nCentral responded with a 10-play, 77-yard drive with Parker scoring on a 9-yard run. \nWith the Maroons leading 20-13, the Vikings had a drive working but Smith’s pass over the middle, intended for Blaize Cobb, was intercepted by Central’s Jake Beesley, who also had a interception in the first half. \nOn both occasions, Central capitalized with touchdown drives, the latter culminating with a 14-yard touchdown run by Tim Maiden, giving the Maroons a 27-13 lead with 5:04 left. \n“We had a couple of big turnovers,’’ Luke said. “Quentin has made a bunch of big plays for us and we haven’t turned the ball over a lot this year. \n“But, we’re not the type of team that can afford a lot of turnovers. The Champaign kid (Beesley) just made a great play over the top of Cobb.’’ \nDanville’s Justin Daubaris was held to just 99 yards on 29 carries. It was the first time this year that the junior didn’t run for 100 yards. The Vikings finished with 189 rushing yards as senior Jeff Dye had 57 on six carries. \nSmith was 7-of-17 for 98 yards in the passing department with Darryl Kelley having three catches for 43 yards and Ross had three receptions for 40. \n“We got the ball downfield, we just didn’t punch it into the end zone enough,’’ Smith said. “We just didn’t finish.’’ \nThat seems to be the story of the 2015 Danville Vikings.
