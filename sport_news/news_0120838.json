(Cheyenne, reviled for its persistent winds, wasn't included in the report because it didn't meet the population cut off of 100,000.)\nCoreLogic said its proprietary wind verification technology is placed in communities, allowing it to zero in more precisely than measurements collected at airports and monitoring stations.\nWind damage accounts for 20 percent to 30 percent of all property insurance claims and insurers are looking for ways to confirm severe gusts in specific areas, CoreLogic said.\nBoulder ranked second after Reno, Nev., for the highest urban wind speed measured in the first half of 2015 — 82 miles per hour.\nMonitors in Westminster recorded an 108 mile-per-hour gust, one of only three captured above 100 miles per hour not involving a tornado since 2006, CoreLogic said.\nAldo Svaldi: 303-954-1410, asvaldi@denverpost.com or @aldosvaldi\nAdvertisement", "external_links": ["http://www.corelogic.com/blog/authors/lindene-patton/2015/10/the-winds-of-change-are-blowing.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-23T11:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:06:02.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
