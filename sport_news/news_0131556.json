He attended the first LSU game this year. He didn't go to any games in 2014.\nA photo posted to Mike's Facebook page Friday showed him eating \"Gator tartare\" — a meaty concoction laid on the floor in the shape of the Florida mascot.\nNo. 6 LSU plays No. 8 Florida on Saturday in Baton Rouge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:22:18.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
