Jacob deGrom and Steven Matz will follow in Games 3 and 4, respectively.\nSyndergaard, 23, started Game 2 of the NLDS then came out of the bullpen in Game 5 Thursday. He threw only 17 pitches in an inning of work, but did warm up multiple times earlier in the game when deGrom struggled.\n\"I had (bullpen coach Ricky Bones) in earlier this morning talking about the warm-up sessions the other day, and actually the entire game he threw only about 80 pitches,\" said Collins. \"The first couple times (he warmed up) he threw only 16-18 pitches ... he said 'I feel great. I'm not stiff, I'm not sore.' And I said 'you got tomorrow.'\"\nMatt Harvey is starting Game 1 against Jon Lester Saturday. By starting deGrom instead of Matz in Game 3, the Mets will be able to bring deGrom back in Game 7, if necessary. Matz hasn't pitched a whole lot of late and is available out of the bullpen in Game 1.\n\nNoah Syndergaard will start Game 2 of the NLCS Sunday.
