Here we want to build from that platform, develop the attacking side of the game and be a threat. \n“If you’re going to go to that next level you need to develop the players you’ve got but also build on it and add to it. You can’t stand still in the Premier League.” \nA fractured ankle at 18 put paid to Garner’s playing career and so he started doing his coaching badges. \nStarting with the under-11s and working his way through, he was made first-team coach at Palace during their 2012/13 season. \nHe added: “I’d worked with Tony at Palace, I got on well with him — we have similar principles and values as people. \n“I spoke to him quite early on after I left Palace and he was keen to bring me in. It was great to be back on the pitch.” \nAlthough Albion have started slowly this season, especially at home, Garner believes there is potential at The Hawthorns and one day he wants the top job somewhere.
