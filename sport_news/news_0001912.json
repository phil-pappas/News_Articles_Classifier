Alex Galchenyuk broke a tie midway through the third period, and Pacioretty added an empty-netter. \nJames van Riemsdyk had a power-play goal for Toronto early in the second period. \nBernier finished with 27 saves. \nBabcock made the first coach’s challenge in NHL history and was successful in overturning a goal. \nBabcock challenged Jeff Petry’s apparent goal in the second period, arguing that Tomas Plekanec interfered with goalie Jonathan Bernier. Referees Frederik L’Ecuyer and Dan O’Rourke looked at the replay by the penalty box at Air Canada Centre and determined Plekanec made incidental contact with Bernier. \nMontreal defenseman P.K. Subban appeared to suffer a left leg injury in the third when he was boarded by Leo Komarov. \nTORRES ACCEPTS BAN: San Jose Sharks forward Raffi Torres will not appeal his 41-game suspension for a check to the head of Anaheim’s Jakob Silfverberg in a preseason game. \nThe players union said Wednesday that Torres will not contest the longest suspension in NHL history for a hit on another player. \nBRIEF: The Minnesota Wild assigned center Jordan Schroeder, a former first-round pick, to their AHL affiliate. The move was made Wednesday, after Schroeder cleared waivers.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:51:22.307+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
