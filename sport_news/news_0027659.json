Down the road, playing a game like that will benefit them. \nNo one likes to lose, especially that way, but the Gales showed a lot of grit and determination when things weren’t going their way, especially in the first half. But they came out in the second half and did what great teams do: They made adjustments and overcame a 7-0 deficit to take a 14-7 lead. \nA few little things proved to be the difference, but sometimes, you just have to give the other team credit for making plays when they had to, which is what Gahanna did in the first and second overtimes. \n“It was a tough loss and unfortunately, we are going to have a lot of guys with heavy hearts, but we don’t have time for that because we have a short week,” said Lancaster coach Rob Carpenter right after last Friday’s game. “It is big-boy time and we have to rally up and get ready for the next game.” \nIndeed they do. Lancaster will travel to Reynoldsburg on Thursday for an important Ohio Capital Conference-Ohio Division game. The Gales still have a lot to play for these next three weeks. \nComing back from such a tough loss is never easy, but if there is ever a team that can put it behind them, it’s Lancaster. \nThe players and coaches have done a great job all season of taking one game at a time. When you are winning, it’s so easy to look ahead, but watching how the Gales prepare each week, I can attest to the fact they have only focused on each week. \nThe coaches do a great job of making sure of the players are prepared and focused, and I’m sure this week will be no different. \nFriday’s loss should be just a blip on the radar screen for the Gales. Sure, they lost, but they just as easily could have won. Regardless of the outcome, you have to move onto the next week. \nLancaster has proved a lot of people wrong this season by starting the season 6-0. The Gales have beaten some quality teams, which is why they only dropped from No. 1 to No. 2 in the Division I, Region 2 computer poll. \nThe mark of a great team, however, is how they react when they face adversity. There is no doubt in my mind the Gales will bounce back in a positive way when they take on the Raiders Thursday night. \nThe coaches will have them prepared, and it will be up to the players to go out and execute the game plan. Again, watching this group in practice and how they go about their business, I have zero doubt they will give 100 percent effort to get back on track. \nIt has been a special season so far the Gales, and I’m sure they aren’t about to let one heartbreaking loss define their season. \ntwilson@lancastereaglegazette.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:56:05.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
