Hilton Sr. said. \"That's the hurting part.\" \n\"She's the one that spoiled everybody,\" granddaughter Corteona Hilton said. \"She was the one that gave the candy when mommy and daddy said no. It was tough watching it all over again.\" \nAs tough as it was for the family to learn of the mix up, T.Y. Hilton says he's glad the truth came to light. \nThe cemetery blamed the mistake on the previous owners. \nThe cemetery manager of Dade Memorial Park said the mistake became known when the plot where Lula Mae Hilton was thought to have been buried was purchased by the family of someone else who recently died. \nCopyright 2015 WPLG, family photos via CNN.
