This led to the tie-breaker where Sania and Martina proved a tad better to clinch it 7-5.\nJulia and Karolina fought well again in the second set to break the top seeds but Sania and Martina came back strong to break the European combine twice and take home the set and match.\nOverall, the reigning Wimbledon and US Open champions won 73 of the 131 points played in the match.\nSania has reached the final of this event in the last three editions, winning the 2013 title with Zimbabwean Cara Black.
