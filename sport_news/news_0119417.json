This LED light is weather proof and designed for mounting to vehicle bumpers, roll bars, brush guards, turrets and almost anywhere a powerful auxiliary light is needed. This light produces a spot beam that can reach distances up to 600’ and has a beam width of 100’. The 30 watt PAR46 LED light emitter in this unit is highly resistant to damage from shocks and vibration as well as up to 80% more efficient than incandescent lights. It has an average lifespan rating of 50,000 hours, making it an ideal choice for military and construction vehicles and equipment where reliability is important. This new LED light is fitted with a 5/8 – 18X2 stud that can be mounted to vehicle bumpers, roll bars, or the turrets of armored vehicles. This lamp is designed for rugged use and will hold position even under aggressive driving conditions. The LED lamp assembly in this light contains a built in driver which allows it to operate directly on a 12 volt power source. The low voltage capability makes the light ideal for use on cars or trucks which normally use 12 volt DC electrical systems. “This new stud mounted LED light has been released just in time for the hunting season,” said Rob Bresnahan with Larsonelectronics.com. “This spotlight will over power those standard head lights on most vehicles and ATVs.”\nLarson Electronics carries an extensive line of LED light towers, portable power distributions, explosion proof lights for hazardous locations, portable work lights and industrial grade LED area lights.
