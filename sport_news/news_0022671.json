There is still a long way to go for his health and recovery, but Odom's condition was reportedly stable enough this week for him to be discharged from Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas and transferred to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on Monday.\nI'm told Lamar Odom was successfully transferred earlier tonight to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in LA\n— Mark Medina (@MarkG_Medina) October 20, 2015 This report from Mark Medina of the Los Angeles Daily News confirms earlier reports from E! Online about the transfer of Odom. After being found unconscious in Nevada last Tuesday, Odom was reported to be on life support and needed machines to breathe for him while he was in a coma. It was reported he had a drug overdose that put him in that condition.\nSince then has has awoken from the coma and been able to communicate with friends and family. He was taken off a breathing machine and while his condition is still quite serious and the severity of his health isn't fully known or reported, things appear to have gotten better for him for the time being.\n\nE! News has exclusively learned that the former NBA star has been discharged from Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, where he has been receiving medical treatment after being found unconscious on Tuesday, and is heading to California. We're also told that Lamar was accompanied by Khloé Kardashian in the helicopter ride to Los Angeles.\nAs we reported earlier today, Odom's transfer to L.A. was pending his condition remaining stable. Doctors were in the early stages of working out the logistics of how the athlete would be transported to SoCal, because Lamar's stature previously prohibited him from being airlifted in a helicopter.\nE! News reported that the former Laker's health is improving day to day, but the 35-year-old celeb is going to need \"a lot\" of rehab in the coming months.\n\nOdom had reportedly been visited in the hospital in Las Vegas by former teammates from the Lakers and Clippers. We've seen some real progress with Lamar Odom the last couple days.
