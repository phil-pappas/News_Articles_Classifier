Yet now the Belgian playmaker has been warned by Jose Mourinho to up his workrate to reclaim his place in the team. Mourinho publicly rebuked Hazard during his first season and the desired response followed. Will history repeat itself? If so, Hazard has work to do from the substitutes' bench and in training to convince his boss. \nWhat difference does a day make? \nMourinho has often bemoaned the scheduling of fixtures around European matches, with Porto playing on the Friday before beating Chelsea on the Tuesday. Dynamo Kiev also played 24 hours ahead of Chelsea, losing for the first time in 38 Ukrainian Premier League games, to Shakhtar Donetsk. Yet if the Premier League had brought forward Chelsea's match with Aston Villa, the week after an international break, surely that would have been an issue? \nFeeling the Blues? \nOscar, Loic Remy and Radamel Falcao were left behind in London when Chelsea played at Porto in the last round. Oscar was an unused substitute against Villa, Remy made a late appearance and Falcao was not even in the squad amid reports the Colombian is keen to terminate his season-long loan from Monaco to seek first-team football elsewhere. Will Mourinho leave anyone behind this time? \nDefensive solidity \nA better team than Villa might have punished Chelsea on Saturday, but the Blues instead kept a first clean sheet since the successive defeats of Maccabi Tel-Aviv and Arsenal. Given the comments surrounding the Hazard selection - \"When you don't have the ball, quality means nothing and what means (thumps chest)... you have or you don't have\" - expect Mourinho to focus on being hard to beat as a priority. Winning comes second and he will be content with a point. It may not be pretty. \nKiev connection \nThe partnership between Andriy Shevchenko and Sergei Rebrov, now the Dynamo Kiev head coach, brought the side to the forefront of the European game. Neither thrived in spells in England, with Shevchenko floundering at Chelsea. Mourinho watched Ukraine take on Spain last week at NSK Olimpiyskiy. Cesc Fabregas won his 100th cap, but missed a penalty. Mourinho will hope the Spain playmaker is on top form.
