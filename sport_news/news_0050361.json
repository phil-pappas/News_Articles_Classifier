Though, by the end of the night, several Middletown turnovers made the difference in a 20-6 Salesianum victory at Baynard Stadium. After forcing an early Middletown fumble, Garret Cannon opened the scoring Friday night, scoring on a quarterback-keeper from two-yards out to give Salesianum a 7-0 lead. The Sallies lead would hold steady at 7-0 into the second quarter when Salesianum would again capitalize off a Middletown turnover. Deep in their own territory, Salesianum’s Evan Mullin intercepted a Vincent DelPercio pass returning it near the goal-line. On the very next play Colby Reeder pounded in the score from 2-yards out to give Salesianum a 13-0 lead after the extra point was blocked by Middletown. Salesianum led 13-0 at half time. Middletown struck for their first points in the opening seconds of the second half when Kedrick Whitehead scored from 74-yards out. Salesianum blocked the extra point attempt, and the Cavaliers trailed Sallies 13-6. After the fourth turnover of the night for the Cavaliers, Salesianum was set up in great field position again, and once more they took advantage. Griffin Salvo scored from 25-yards out to give Salesianum a 20-6 lead, one they would hold throughout the third and fourth quarter. In the end, five Cavalier turnovers told the story Friday night at Baynard Stadium. The loss breaks a two-game win streak for Middletown who now stand at 3-2 on the year. The Cavaliers are back in action next Friday night when they travel to take on A.I. duPont at 7:30 p.m", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:24:13.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
