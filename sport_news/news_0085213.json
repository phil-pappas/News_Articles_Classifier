The result eliminated Dynamo from the play-offs, while it left the Sounders still in the hunt for a spot. The game which was played at the BBVA Compass Stadium, saw Dynamo take the lead in the 65th minute through Ricardo Clark. But with eight minutes remaining, Martins, who has been in good scoring form, struck to earn Seattle Sounders a share of the spoils. Martins has now scored 15 league goals in 21 games for Seattle Sounders in the current campaign. He has also found the back of the net six times in his last eight games. Meanwhile, former Enyimba midfielder, Rasheed Olabiyi, was an unused substitute for Houston Dynamo in the encounter. He has so far featured seven times this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:31:17.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
