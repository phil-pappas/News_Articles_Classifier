April Sharpeta had died. \nBorn on Nov. 5, 2004, the black Lab was purchased as a hunting dog. But when the owner realized he did not have time to train the dog, he donated it to Delaware Fish and Game. \nIn 2006, Bear met Sharpeta for 10 weeks of K-9 school at Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission before certifying with United States Police K9 Association. The dog's specialty was tracking people and detecting deer, turkey, ducks, geese and bear that had been harvested. \nBear made his first find for Havre de Grace Police, when a subject stole a vehicle and escaped into a cornfield. It took Bear just eight minutes to track the suspect, who was suffering from life-threatening injuries from crashing the vehicle. \nOne week later, Bear made his first gun recovery, while tracing the steps of three suspects after shots were fired. Bear pulled off the track and went to the gun. \n\"It is an amazing and rewarding job to train as a K-9 team. All of the time and effort pays off when you find a person, return an article or locate illegal game,\" said Sharpeta. \"We created an unbreakable bond that allowed us to understand each other without even speaking. K-9 Bear was an outstanding dog. I am proud of the cases he made along with the loyalty that he showed me.\" \nBear’s final efforts involved finding the gun on state land left by a suicidal subject and tracking two homicide suspects from the crime scene to the site where they were apprehended. \nOn Sept. 26, Bear — ever the goodwill ambassador — greeted hundreds of families at a National Hunting and Fishing event in Marriottsville. \nTwo weeks later, on Oct. 9, Bear died after a short illness, his partner at his side. \n\"He will always be my greatest accomplishment at the Natural Resources Police,\" Sharpeta said.
