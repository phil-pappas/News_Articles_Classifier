The junior added two kills and two aces. \nMcKenna Painton posted a career-high 18 digs in the match. UA outdug the Huskies 62-60. \nArizona had no answer for the Washington presence at the net. Washington outblocked Arizona 13-6, while middle blocker Lianna Sybeldon posted 19 kills on an errorless 26 swings (.731). \nThe loss was Arizona's fifth to a team currently ranked in the top 10. Arizona has taken at least set in each of the five matches, including a pair of five set losses to No. 2 Texas and No. 7 Stanford. In addition to Arizona's seven set victories over top-10 teams, UA has forced deuce in six additional sets. Arizona is 0-6 in those sets. \nArizona is 12-0 against teams ranked outside of the top nine in the current AVCA Top 25, a record that will be put to the test on Friday when the Cats take on a 12-4 Washington State team in Pullman. \nUp Next: The Wildcats hit the road for four matches beginning in Washington. Arizona takes on the Huskies on Wednesday, Oct. 7 at 7:30 p.m. before heading to Corvallis to take on Washington State on Friday, Oct. 9 at 6 p.m. MST. Both matches will be televised by the Pac-12 Networks. \nCopyright 2015 Arizona Athletics.
