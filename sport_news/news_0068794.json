There is no real proof that Rob Gronkowski is indigenous to this planet other than a birth certificate that might or might not be the work of a master forger.\nHe/It is a 6-6, 265-pound headache and the primary reason why the Jets' top-ranked defense will be stressed Sunday in a way that it hasn't been through these feel-good first five weeks.\nAsk 100 people about the most effective way to stop Gronk and you'll get 200 different answers. Nobody is quite sure what works because nothing really does.\nTheory No. 1, via safety Marcus Gilchrist: \"You got to use your quickness. You can't get into a big fighting match with him because he's obviously bigger and stronger than you. So you got to try to out-quick him. You got to be technique-sound and anticipate and break on his routes before he even breaks.\"\nTheory No. 2, via safety Calvin Pryor: \"You have to get up in his face and try to jam him at the line. But at the same time, it's going to take a total team effort, all 11 guys to stop that guy.\"\nTheory No. 3, via outside linebacker Calvin Pace: \"We got some guys that can cover, but the thing is up front we got to get there. We can't give (Tom Brady) all day to throw and make it 7-on-7 for him.\"\nTodd Bowles' conclusion: \"I don't see anybody covering him. That's the problem.\"\nThe Hilary Clinton Theory probably has the best chance to succeed. It'll take a village to neutralize the best tight end in the league. Brady's rapport with Gronkowski only adds to the angst for opponents. There's some telepathy between the all-world quarterback and his most dangerous pass-catching weapon. The duo has combined for 58 touchdowns, second most for a quarterback-tight end tandem in NFL history.\nGronkowski, the fastest tight end to 60 career touchdowns, is on a path to become the most prolific player at his position. He's an unmovable giant with 425 yards and five touchdowns this season. He averages a cartoonish 18.5 yards per reception.\n\"Obviously nobody's come up with the magic answer,\" defensive backs coach Joe Danna said of devising a plan to cover Gronk. \"So you try to give him a number of different looks and maybe a few different techniques…. Maybe it's not just one guy. Maybe you got to double him. But you definitely don't want to end up behind him when he's down in the red zone, because it'll be hard to get around him.\"\nGronkowski's sheer size in confined quarters makes it virtually impossible to scheme to stop him. He's made a career of boxing out opponents in the red zone, but there's more to him than that.\nMike Ehrmann/Getty Images Rob Gronkowski's famous TD spike has become an all-too familiar sight this season. \"His size overshadows everything,\" Bowles said. \"Everybody fails to realize is that he's a very smart player.\"\nGronkowski's numbers in a pair of Patriots wins over Jets last season weren't astronomical (11 receptions for 99 yards, 1 TD), but his mere presence has a ripple effect across the entire defense.\n\"He's a big dude,\" Pryor said. \"He does a great job of shielding guys and catching the ball and making the plays when they need him. I can't take nothing from him. He's an outstanding football player. But with a year of experience and playing this guy before, I'm pretty sure it's going to be different (this time).\"\nGronk has heard it all before from virtually every opponent. The Steelers claimed before the season opener that they had a great plan for him. The Pro Bowler lit them up for three touchdowns. Rex Ryan, who faced Gronkowski 11 times in the previous five seasons, surrendered seven catches for 113 yards and a touchdown in Week 2.\nGronk, of course, is not the only potential landmine for Todd Bowles' stingy defense. Brady's connection with Dion Lewis, Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola could make for a challenging day. The Patriots' don't have the same firepower as Bill Belichick's 2007 team that won its first 18 games before losing to the Giants in the Super Bowl, but they're still averaging a league-high 36.6 points.\n\"We're not trying to confuse anybody,\" Pryor said. \"That's where people go wrong when they play the Patriots. They're trying to do too much.\"\nThe first order of business should be to attempt to take Gronkowski out of the equation.\n\"It's definitely a challenge,\" Pryor said, \"But at the same time, he's human.\"\nThat's debatable.\nhttp://twitter.com/MMehtaNYDN", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/MMehtaNYDN"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:13:32.242+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
