And the only defeat in that span was by three points on the road in Denver, one of the league’s toughest spots.\nTeddy Bridgewater hands off the ball to Adrian Peterson. Photo: Getty Images The Vikings are doing it with defense, ranking second in the league in points allowed and forcing at least one turnover in every game. That’s allowed them to thrive despite an up-and-down start from Adrian Peterson and an offense that ranks next-to-last in the NFL in yards.\nThe schedule definitely sets up for the Vikings to stay on the Packers’ heels — they don’t play a team currently with a winning record until their Nov. 22 home matchup with Green Bay.\nThis week’s rankings (last week in parentheses): \n1. Patriots, 5-0 (1): The interception of Tom Brady last week was just the third turnover all season by New England.\n2. Packers, 6-0 (2): James Jones, Randall Cobb and Ty Montgomery have combined for 12 TD catches in Jordy Nelson’s absence.\n3. Broncos, 6-0 (3): Peyton Manning’s 72.5 passer rating is 32nd in the NFL among qualifiers, ahead only of Ryan Mallett (63.6).\nBroncos QB Peyton Manning has been struggling. Photo: Getty Images 4. Bengals, 6-0 (4): Andy Dalton is on pace to be sacked just 16 times this season after being sacked at least 21 times in each of his first four NFL seasons.\n5. Panthers, 5-0 (7): Ranked 28th in the NFL in total offense but sixth in scoring offense. That’s a lot of short fields.\n6. Steelers, 4-2 (8): Reports of Blitzburgh’s demise were exaggerated — Pittsburgh has four players with at least two sacks each.\n7. Jets, 4-1 (9): Opposing quarterbacks have just a 32.8 passer rating against Darrelle Revis, second-lowest among NFL cornerbacks behind Carolina’s Josh Norman.\n8. Falcons, 5-1 (5): Turned the ball over a combined six times in the past two games after committing just two turnovers in the first four games.\n9. Cardinals, 4-2 (6): Cornerback Tyrann Mathieu (two interceptions, seven pass breakups, one forced fumble and 32 tackles) is having an All-Pro season.\n10. Vikings, 3-2 (16): Minnesota has allowed 16 points or fewer in three of its first five games.\n11. Eagles, 3-3 (18) \n12. Seahawks, 2-4 (10) \n13. Colts, 3-3 (13) \n14. Giants, 3-3 (11): What happened to the run defense? Big Blue has allowed a combined 279 rushing yards the past two games after giving up just 279 rushing yards in the first four.\nCardinals defensive back Tyrann Mathieu breaks up a pass intended for Rams tight end Jared Cook.
