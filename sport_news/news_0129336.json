After the 1986 season, Spurrier interviewed for the LSU head coaching job, but didn't get it and had to settle for the Duke job. And LSU would suffer at his wrath for that for many years to come. \nAfter the 2004 season, Spurrier would have likely been interested in the LSU job again as he was leaving the Washington Redskins, but the timing was not right. LSU had already hired Les Miles. \nSpurrier is 70 now, 0-3 in the Southeastern Conference and maybe headed to his first losing season as a head coach since 1987 at Duke. But on Saturday afternoon, he will finally be the \"home\" team's coach in Tiger Stadium. \nLSU \"agreed\" on Wednesday to \"let\" South Carolina move its scheduled home game at 11 a.m. Saturday in Columbia, South Carolina, to Tiger Stadium at 2:30 p.m. Saturday (TV time to be determined) because of a flooding rampage throughout that state in recent days. \n\"They are basically the home team for this game,\" said LSU athletic director Joe Alleva because South Carolina will be getting the ticket and concession money from LSU. \"We want our fans to make them feel at home.\" \nLSU has even decided to toss its beloved home whites to wear purple at home in a SEC home game for the first time since 1994. \nReally, Joe, you want LSU's fans to make Steve Spurrier feel at home at Tiger Stadium! You don't know the history with this guy. \nSpurrier has felt at home at Tiger Stadium for years. His Florida teams beat LSU in Tiger Stadium by 16-0 in 1991, by 58-3 in 1993, by 28-10 in 1995 and by 31-10 in 1999. Even then-LSU coach Nick Saban couldn't stop him. He lost 44-15 to Spurrier in 2001. No other passing offense in Saban's time at LSU shredded his defense as Spurriers' did that day. \n\"It was like watching a video game,\" said former safety Ryan Clark, who knew what he was talking about because he was in the video. \nAs Florida's quarterback, Spurrier was also 2-0 against LSU with a 20-6 win in 1964 and a 28-7 win in 1966 on his way to the Heisman Trophy. So, Spurrier was a sparkling 7-1 as a head coach and quarterback in Tiger Stadium and liked rubbing it in LSU's face, too, before LSU coach Les Miles took him by 28-16 in 2007 and again by 23-21 in 2013. \nAnd now, LSU wants to make Tiger Stadium a friendly roost for Spurrier and his Gamecocks. They're even going to play South Carolina's fight song after scores. \n\"Our goal is to make South Carolina feel at home,\" Alleva said. \nHas such a memo been sent to Leonard Fournette? Perhaps he should not play if you really want to be hospitable. And perhaps should invite Curley Hallman over so he can coach for Miles.That would be homey. \n\"Obviously, it's unusual,\" said Miles, who spoke to Spurrier by phone on Wednesday. \"He said that I might suggest that the fans not make any noise (as in the 1993 game). I said I was fine with that.\" \nBut Miles was kidding as he apparently didn't get Alleva's memo. Later at his weekly Wednesday night press conference, Miles revealed another idea for LSU fans. \n\"I would say to them to put away their fishing rod for the weekend and put away that weekend you were going to take your wife some place because there wasn't a home game,\" he said. \"Postpone those plans and pull the RV up, start cooking, come back to your comfortable confines of Tiger Stadium and start making a lot of noise.\" \nThey will likely be barbecuing chicken. \nSpurrier may be 70 and losing, but he is as sharp as ever, even if his team isn't. He knows spin when he hears it. He knows what's coming, and it's not a home game no matter what LSU says it is. \n\"The biggest challenge is LSU,\" he said with a chuckle when asked about a storm-riddled week at South Carolina. \"They got a big strong defense. They run the ball down everybody's throat.\" \nAnd he's playing at Tiger Stadium, and Fournette will not be trying to make anybody wearing white \"feel at home.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wwltv.com/1LjWF7y TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:16:26.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
