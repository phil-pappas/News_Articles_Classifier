Division Series on Sunday night, when the Rangers are going for a sweep in the best-of-five series against the Toronto Blue Jays. \nBeltre strained his back sliding into second base during Game 1 in Toronto and exited early from the series opener Thursday before sitting out Game 2 on Friday. \n\"He's day to day, has made some improvement, continues to get better,\" manager Jeff Banister said after Saturday's workout. \"We felt like the best thing for him to do is rest and get the treatments as needed.\" \nBeltre will be re-evaluated before Sunday's game. \nRookie Hanser Alberto took over for Beltre at third base, made an error and also drove in two runs. Alberto and fellow rookie Joey Gallo, who is not on the roster, were taking grounders at third during Saturday's workout. \nBlue Jays reliever Brett Cecil's postseason is over because of a torn calf muscle, and the left-hander has been replaced on Toronto's roster by rookie right-hander Ryan Tepera. Cecil was hurt while tagging out Mike Napoli in a rundown during Game 2. Cecil said he would not need surgery and would be ready for spring training. Astros-Royals: Dallas Keuchel has been asked why he pitches so well at home so many times that on Saturday, when it was posed yet again, Houston's ace had a little fun with the answer. Advertisement \"Maybe it's the temperature,\" he said. \"I don't know the AC ... set on 71.\" \nKeuchel went 15-0 with a 1.46 ERA at Minute Maid Park this season, which is the best such mark in modern major league history, eclipsing two pitchers for the Red Sox's Boo Ferriss and Tex Hughson, who both went 13-0 in 1946. \nOn Sunday when the Astros host a playoff game for the first time since the 2005 World Series, Keuchel will try to extend the mark and give Houston a 2-1 lead in the best-of-five A.L. Division Series against Kansas City. \nKeuchel's ERA in Houston is the lowest home ERA in the A.L. since Nolan Ryan had a 1.07 ERA in 1972 for the Angels. \nKeuchel went 1-1 against the Royals in the regular season, pitching eight scoreless innings in a victory in Houston on June 30. He had a tough time in Kansas City on July 26 when he yielded 10 hits and five runs in 6ï»¿2/3 innings. \nThe Royals will counter with Edinson Volquez, who went 13-9 with a 3.55 ERA this season. The last time he pitched in Houston, he allowed eight hits and five runs in five innings of a 6-5 loss on July 1. \nAstros center fielder Carlos Gomez, who has been limited to pinch running in the first two games because of a rib muscle strain, said that he expects to be in the lineup for Game 3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:05:54.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
