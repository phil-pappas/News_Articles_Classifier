This was the closest game in the history of the series. The previous closest came in 2006 when Wittenberg won 35-0. \nQuarterback Zack Jenkins completed 31 of 45 passes for 316 yards with three touchdowns and two interceptions. The Tigers went three-and-out on their first two drives. Jenkins threw an interception on the third drive. \nWittenberg scored its first points on its fourth drive. Ty Smith kicked a 30-yard field goal with 13:47 left in the second quarter. \nStump caught touchdown passes of 17 and 21 yards later in the second quarter as Wittenberg built a 17-10 halftime lead. \nAfter a scoreless third quarter, Smith kicked a 26-yard field goal in the fourth. Luke Bowling ended the scoring, catching a 15-yard touchdown pass from Jenkins. \nStump finished with 197 receiving yards. He broke teammate Zach Culvahouse’s single-game record of 14 receptions. Stump first hit that mark against Butler in 2014 and did it again versus Ohio Wesleyan this season. \nStump fell one short of the North Coast Athletic Conference record. It was set by Oberlin’s Felix Brooks-Church against Allegheny in 1996 and matched by Kenyon’s Andy Pillay in 2001 against Denison.
