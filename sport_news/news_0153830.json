And that's been happening all year. It's just that Brooke's been getting the storylines. I'm really happy for the team.\" \nSchutter, who has 17 goals and five assists on the season, hurt her ankle in Monday's win over Nazareth. She is expected to be back next week. \nRELATED: Parkland girls soccer team rolls past Whitehall \nJunior forward Chelsea Hudson tallied two goals and a pair of assists for Parkland, which improved to 12-1 on the season. \nRachel Medlar , a junior midfielder, and Ava Hanna , a freshman forward, each added a goal and an assist for the Trojans. \nParkland also got a goal from Jenn Guetzlaff and an assist from Helen Flynn . \n\"Brooke definitely plays a very vital role in our team,\" Medlar said. \"But we stepped up and got the job done. We can get the job done no matter who's up top.\" \nRegan Allsop made four saves to preserve the Trojans' shutout. \nOverall, it was a very convincing five-goal victory for the Trojans, who have won 11 straight games. \n\"Obviously, it was very exciting,\" Hudson said. \"We work very hard to make sure we can get things done the way Parkland gets things done. So if it means a 5 or a 6, it really doesn't matter. The more important thing is a 0 next to it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T10:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:35:05.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
