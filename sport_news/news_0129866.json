Clark Herald/Times Tallahassee bureau i Order Reprint of this Story TALLAHASSEE \nMembers of the Florida Legislature’s Black Caucus want Republican Gov. Rick Scott tolaunch an independent investigation into the police-involved shooting death of Corey Jones in Palm Beach County on Sunday. \n“Once again, another young black man has been killed by being someplace he rightfully belonged in our state,” said Rep. Edwin Narain, D-Tampa. \nJones, a 31-year-old musician and Boynton Beach resident, was shot dead at around 3:15 a.m. after an encounter with a police officer when his vehicle broke down on an I-95 exit ramp in Palm Beach Gardens. \nThe officer, Nouman Raja, was on duty in plain clothes and driving an unmarked police vehicle. The Palm Beach Gardens Police Department said Raja was investigating what he thought was an abandoned vehicle and when Raja left his own vehicle “he was suddenly confronted by an armed subject.” \nRaja’s vehicle had no dash camera and he wore no body camera. The Palm Beach Gardens Police Department waited nearly two days before commenting on the shooting, after getting pressure from the local police union. \nOnce again, another young black man has been killed by being someplace he rightfully belonged in our state. \nState Rep. Edwin Narain \n“It is these types of delays and lack of evidence that continue to create distrust between communities of color and local police departments,” Narain said. “It is a source of anguish and frustration for black people nationwide, and legislative action and enforcement appears to be the only proper remedy.” \nAlthough the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office and Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office are each looking into the shooting, Rep. Bobby Powell, D-Riviera Beach, said “an independent and thorough investigation by an outside agency” — in this case, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement — would help restore public confidence. \n“This has to stop,” Powell said. “There’s no evidence that we've seen to indicate that this man was a trouble-maker.... My community is frustrated and rightfully so.” \nIn a statement issued as the Black Caucus held a press conference Wednesday at the Florida Capitol, Scott’s spokeswoman Jackie Schutz said Scott has “offered the assistance of the FDLE in the two ongoing investigations by the State Attorney’s Office and the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.” \n“Our office continues to monitor any developments,” she added. \nCaucus members also called on their colleagues to pass bills that will increase transparency and accountability by police officers through the consistent use of body cameras and automatic, outside investigations into police shootings that are deemed justified. \nKristen M.
