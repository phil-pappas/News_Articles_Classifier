Ebenhack \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nPHILADELPHIA -- A lingering back injury has jeopardized Steven Matz's chances of making the Mets' postseason roster. \nMatz, the former Ward Melville star, was scratched from his scheduled start for the second straight day. He was scheduled to pitch on Thursday. Latest Mets stories Story Matz could miss next start with back stiffness Data Pro sports draftees from Long Island \nThe Mets could also send Matz to the instructional league in Florida to face batters if he's not ready to pitch by the weekend or if inclement weather forces a postponement. He could also face hitters in a simulated game on Wednesday. \n\"I'm not very concerned,\" said Matz, who compared the stiffness to a crick in the right side of his upper back. \"It's going to go away. It's just a matter of when.\" \nBut the Mets can't afford that kind of uncertainty. If Matz is added to the roster for the NLDS but must be taken off because of injury, he would be ineligible for the NLCS. \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \n\"The one thing you don't want to do is activate him for the first series, and then have a back flare-up,\" manager Terry Collins said. \nMatz first complained of the issue on Tuesday. The Mets believed he had just slept awkwardly, causing the stiffness. But the lefthander's condition did not improve on Wednesday, prompting the Mets to push him back once more. Mets Mets playoff hopefuls \n\"It's still lingering a little bit so we're just going to take it day by day,\" said Matz, who may undergo tests later Wednesday. \nTim Stauffer or Sean Gilmartin will start Thursday in place of Matz, whose lengthy injury history includes nearly two months on the shelf this season with a torn lat muscle. \nNotes & quotes: Thursday's scheduled night game has been moved to 12:05 p.m. in an effort to sidestep bad weather expected to hit Philadelphia . . . This weekend's three-game series at Citi Field against the Nationals may also be in danger of being washed out, though Collins said he wasn't aware of any contingency plans yet . . .
