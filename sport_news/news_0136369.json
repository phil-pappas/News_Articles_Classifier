Associated Press photo slideshow KENNESAW — Kennesaw State running back Micah Reed suffered a broken right fibula in the Owls’ win over Point last Saturday and will miss the rest of the season.The 6-foot, 216-pound junior transfer from Central Florida is third on the team in rushing with 68 carries for 309 yards.Kennesaw State coach Brian Bohannon said at his weekly news conference that Reed’s injury was to a non-weight-baring bone and surgery would not be needed. Bohannon said Reed is in a walking boot and should heal in six to eight weeks. Redshirt freshman Trey Chivers, who has 111 yards and a touchdown through four games, will take Reed’s spot in the starting lineup, but the surprise entrant on the depth chart is backup quarterback Jake McKenzie.Bohannon said the possibility of McKenzie playing running back had been discussed for a while. With Reed’s injury, it has become necessary as Kennesaw State prepares for this week’s Big South Conference opener against Gardner-Webb.“Jake is a tough, physical, hard-nosed player,” Bohannon said of the 6-foot, 206-pound redshirt freshman from Monroeville, Alabama. “Sometimes, you get caught between ‘he’s the backup quarterback, but he’s a really good player,’ so we’re going to go down that road and see where it takes us.“Jake just wants to play. You can ask him and say, ‘Hey, Jake, you want to go play safety?’ and he’ll say, “I’m all in.’”McKenzie has been effective when he has played, carrying the ball 19 times for 124 yards and three touchdowns. McKenzie has also completed each of his three of his pass attempts — all in the Point game — for 69 yards.Bohannon said McKenzie will see time at running back Saturday. McKenzie will remain Trey White’s backup at quarterback, but third-string QB Chandler Burks has been getting additional reps in practice to make sure he is ready if needed.“Chandler is getting some reps, where he wasn’t in the past,” Bohannon said.Burks has played in three games, with two carries for 7 yards. The Douglasville native, who was the first recruit to both commit to and sign with Kennesaw State, has yet to throw a pass.NATIONAL RANKINGS: Kennesaw State ranks second in the Football Championship Subdivision in rushing yards per game (341.6) and ninth in total offense (482.8).On the other side of the ball, the Owls are eighth in total defense (286.8) and scoring defense (16.2 points per game). The Owls are also the only team in the FCS that has yet to give up a sack.GAME BALLS: Running back Chaston Bennett, who had 160 total yards and scored three touchdowns against Point, was named the team’s offensive player of the game. Defensive back Derrick Farrow was the top defensive player after recording two tackles and grabbing his first interception of the year. It is the second time Farrow earned the award, along with the Edward Waters game. Running back Darnell Holland was named special teams player of the game, defensive end Auzoyah Alufohai earned the Thermos award and offensive lineman Chaz Nwadike claimed the knockdown award for the second time.UP NEXT: Kennesaw State (4-1) will host Gardner Webb (2-3, 1-0) in the Big South Conference opener at Fifth Third Bank Stadium on Saturday at 1 p.m.The game is sold out, but it can be seen online via ESPN3, or heard at KSUOwls.com.Gardner-Webb will come into the game on a high after upsetting then-No. 15 Liberty, the three-time defending conference co-champion, 34-20 last week.
