With the win, India have greatly improved their chances of making their third successive final here. The defending champions have climbed up to the second spot with six points. “I was happy with our performance in the first half but we had some issues in the second half,” said India coach Harendra Singh. “Overall it was a good game; both the teams played well and it was a great contest.” India started fast and it took them just three minutes to find the first goal through Arman Qureshi. India doubled their lead in the 11th minute through Gurjant Singh. India maintained the pressure on the opponents. After a series of attacks, the Indians received a penalty corner in the 34th minute but failed to convert it. In the second half, Argentina tightened their defence. In the 39th minute, Argentina earned their first penalty corner and captain Maico Casella converted. However, India regained their two goal advantage when Nilakanta Sharma scored off a rebound from a penalty corner attempt in the 50th minute. Argentina refused to give up and found their second goal in the 54th minute through a Nicolas Keenan deflection. But India managed to hold on. “India played a great first half and are tough opponents,” said Argentina coach Mariano Ronconi. India will face hosts Malaysia tomorrow. —Agency", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:51:49.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
