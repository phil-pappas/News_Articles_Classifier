However, even after losing Thursday night to the Capitals 4-1, Chicago is getting production from some new, young faces.\nWhile it’s a small sample size, 40 percent of the goals so far this season have been scored by a player who wasn’t on the team last season.\n4 of the 10 #Blackhawks goals this season have come from players who did not play for the team last season.\n— Christopher Kamka (@ckamka) October 16, 2015\nA pair of those goals came off of the stick of young phenom Artemi Panarin. Joining him is Artem Anisimov, who came over in the Brandon Saad trade.\nRookie Viktor Svedberg scored his first career goal Thursday night to join the group. Unfortunately, as Mark Lazerus notes , Svedberg’s defense has also allowed a pair of goals over the last two days.\nThe Blackhawks haven’t exactly exploded on offense so far this year. They were held to only one goal over their last two games.\nPatrick Kane is the only other player to have multiple goals on the year. He has a team high three goals and six points.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ckamka/status/654825247540137984", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Blackhawks?src=hash"], "published": "2015-10-16T05:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:38:20.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
