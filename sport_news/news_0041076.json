(AP) â€” The Macon-Bibb County Commission has narrowly approved spending $50,000 for a study to determine if Macon can support a baseball team. \nLocal media outlets near Macon are reporting that the commission voted 5-4 at Tuesday's meeting in favor of the study, which will be conducted by Washington, D.C.-based consulting firm Brailsford & Dunlavey. \nThe firm has performed studies on more than 50 ballpark projects. It says the study will take about 10 weeks to complete, once it is started. The study will analyze the financial impact of baseball in the county over a 20-year period. \nMayor Robert Reichert, who sponsored the resolution, says he is excited the study will move forward. \nThree minor league teams have had short stays in Macon since the class-A Macon Braves left after the 2002 season.
