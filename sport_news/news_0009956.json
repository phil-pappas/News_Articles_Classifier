(AP) â€” A fan was treated for a heart attack and taken to a hospital after No. 7 Michigan State stunned No. 12 Michigan 27-23 on Saturday with a last-second score. University of Michigan spokeswoman Diane Brown says she didn't know if the fan had the heart attack before or after Jalen Watts-Jackson returned a punter's fumble 38 yards to give the Spartans the victory with no time left. The spokeswoman also didn't know if the fan was rooting for the Wolverines or the visiting Spartans. It was a busy day in and around Michigan Stadium for medical personnel and police. Brown says 76 people needed treatment, including 12 that were taken to the hospital. Seven were arrested, including four for minors in possession of alcohol, two for disorderly conduct and one for resisting and obstructing.
