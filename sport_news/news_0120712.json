Along with those challenges would come many triumphs and frustration. I understood that both come with the job. Tough losses, upset parents, equipment and field issues, — it's all part of the role. \nBut I will admit that I never thought I would deal with recruiting of student athletes and student athletes leaving for athletic advantage from a public school to a private school. \nLooking back, this has been around longer than I originally thought, but it is much more serious and more prominent because of the advancement of technology and social media. \nMy first experience with recruitment came in the 8th grade, when my little K-8 Catholic School had some visitors in the early spring. The 12 boys in my grade shuffled out into the auditorium to listen to two men speak about their Catholic all boys school in northern New Jersey. \nOne man was a priest who was also the principal. He spoke about the school in general, handing us pamphlets, asking us if we had any questions. He asked us our names, shook our hands and told us how we would love the school. \nThe second gentleman was in a suit and said nothing as the prinicpal spoke. He just looked at us and smiled. \nWhen the talk was over, we started back to class. As we were almost out of the auditorium, the man in the suit called out three of us by first name and asked us to come back. We were confused, but went back. \nThe man then asked us if we played sports, and in particular, did we play football? He then went on to tell us how we could be great athletes if we went to their school. \nI thought it was pretty cool and I was proud — it wasn’t a coincidence that he asked the best three athletes in our class to hang back. For a day or two I wanted to go to the school, but it didn’t work out. I ended up going to their rival school, and the sole reason for that was our close family friend's son, who was three years older than me, attended that rival school and I thought he was the coolest guy I ever met. Back then, family friends trumped the recruitment efforts or lack thereof that went on. \nFast forward about 15 years, and I am an assistant coach for football at Spring Valley. We have challenges every day that we figure out and deal with — we don’t make excuses, we work hard and put in the time. Our proudest moments are when our student athletes graduate and continue their playing careers at the next level of education. \nTowards the end of the season, we heard around the locker room that some of the best kids on our team are thinking about leaving to go to a private school. I took one of the kids into the office and asked him what was going on. The young man was pretty forthcoming telling me how a “coach” from a private catholic school was coming to our campus handing out shirts, as well as promising each boy he spoke to a gym membership to work out and possibly a scholarship. \nI had already known that a lot of our junior high kids who were strong athletes went to private schools. I knew that was their choice and something we had to deal with, just like any other school. \nI also knew that it was completely illegal for a private school to recruit a student from a public high school, no less provide them with gear and gym memberships. I was able to intercept the gentleman the next time he was on campus and not so politely tell him to leave as he was in violation of some rules. \nI decided to call the private school and let them know of the recruiting violations they were committing. I spoke to the principal of the school (another priest) who was aghast that this individual was doing this. He assured me that this gentleman was not a member of their coaching staff and he they had some issues with him being on their campus. He thanked me for the call. \nI felt satisfied that I did my due diligence and that I was being told the truth... until months later, when I saw this same gentleman who was on my campus on television in a documentary, where he was standing on the sideline behind the head coach as they beat the team that was the subject of the program. \nSince then, I have had to chase “recruiters” from our intra-squad scrimmage. I've seen some student-athletes who started out strongly for our team mysteriously leave in the middle of the season. I've even had a student who was kicked out of one of the private schools come back to us — and not play a sport because, as he told us, “the new private school he would be attending advised him not to so he could play right away next year.” \nYou can’t make this stuff up. I don’t think the kids themselves are coming up with these plans out of nowhere. \nI wouldn’t feel so strongly about this if I didn’t see the other side of it. Most of kids do not go to play at Michigan or Notre Dame. \nLet me be clear — I think it is great for kids to go to private schools if it is the right fit for them. I am a direct product of private education, and I loved every minute of my all-male private high school education. I think there are many kids, many of whom are from the community in which I work, that have chosen to do this and it is a great choice. They need a change of scenery. Some end up going to college, playing their sport at the next level of education. Our coaches have always been proud of any kids, from private or public schools, who are able to further their education. \nThe problem I have is that these schools are run like a college, and as we all know, colleges are businesses — especially when it comes to athletics. These kids are not old enough to realize that the promises and dreams they are being sold on is the same thing they are selling to multiple students at the same position. That is how college athletics works, not high school. \nMany people would say that the private school education is better, but I am not one of those people. I would put my public school’s academics right on par and most likely above those schools. If you are a dedicated student who has the desire, you will absolutely be college ready after you leave. We have multiple kids who are admitted to Ivy League schools each and every year. \nI am sure many will disagree with my stance and say I am attempting to hold kids back from great opportunity, but I'd never want to hold a kid back from any opportunity — if it was right for them. The kids are and never will be the problem. Like every other teenager, they want to feel wanted and that they are special. \nAll I am asking is that if we are going to teach impressionable young students, we have to do it where we, as adults, do not base it on lies and deceit. \nIn the eyes of the states of New York and New Jersey there are rules in place for students who transfer that play athletics. I am not talking about recruiting and leaving for athletic advantage — that happens every year. Kids are quoted on it in the paper and speak about it on social media. \nI am talking about the loopholes schools administrators, coaches and parents knowingly use deceit to get kids on to the field without penalty. Everyone knows why they are transferring, yet there is no penalty. \nWe are teaching these kids that it is okay to break the rules and be deceitful in order to get what you want. I don’t think that any of these schools were founded upon these values, and it is sad to me, because I believed in and was proud of the moral standards of the school I attended 25 years ago. \nBut because of the competition between all of these schools, I don’t believe those standards exist anymore. 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1RyGc0j TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:49:07.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
