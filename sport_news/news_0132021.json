The Parliament’s Treaties Committee submitted a report earlier this month favouring a “go-ahead” to supply of uranium to India to meet its growing energy needs after examining various aspects of the treaty. Australian High Commissioner to India Patrick Suckling told The Tribune that the uranium treaty would be approved by Parliament in October after which Indian energy companies would be free to negotiate imports from Australia. Following signing of an agreement between the then Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi last year, a parliamentary committee looked into its details and took a year to finalise its recommendations. Talks of a civil nuclear cooperation agreement between the two countries began around two years ago when Australia lifted a long standing ban on selling uranium to India. India would become the first country that is not a signatory to the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) to get Australian uranium. India’s uranium needs are so far met with supplies from France, Russia and Kazakhstan. Suckling is in Chandigarh to explore collaborations in agriculture, education, infrastructure development and sports between his country and the states of Punjab and Haryana. “This is purely an exploratory visit, but after meeting political leaders and bureaucrats, we have identified areas of mutual interest and very soon we will facilitate meetings between officials and business on both sides,” he said. Australia has offered to help Punjab and Haryana in overcoming bottlenecks in agriculture that are preventing a “second green revolution”. Providing expertise to help improve irrigation systems, dairy development, food processions, management and storage of crops are some of the focus areas. The Australian High Commissioner said Indians accounted for the biggest immigrant group moving to Australia every year. However, after 2009, Australia overhauled its education system and ordered the closure of nearly 25 per cent “Mickey mouse” educational institutions providing substandard education. This has prevented people from using education as a backdoor route to immigration. Currently, there are nearly 50,000 Indian students in Australia and the number of students is rising by 15 per cent each year. Suckling said he was meeting officials of CII and FICCI to improve trade ties between the two nations. It was after 28 years that any Indian Prime Minister visited Australia. But with Prime Minister Modi declaring Australia as a strategic partner in many areas, including defence, the synergy between India and Australia is like never before.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:16:20.600+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
