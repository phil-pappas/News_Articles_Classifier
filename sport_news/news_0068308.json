(AP) - New Hampshire authorities say a hunter avoided a long, cold night in the woods by doing everything right when he got separated from his group.\nFish and Game officials say 49-year-old Greg Mock of Webster was hunting grouse with three friends in Odell on Saturday morning when he got lost. He then hiked up a mountain to get a cellphone signal and called 911.\nAuthorities told Mock to walk in a certain direction, listen for signal shots and call back if he didn't locate a trail within one mile. After his cellphone battery died, he began building a shelter and preparing to stay overnight, but conservation officers were able to locate him shortly after 5 p.m.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
