Give the game ball to defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo , whose unit is overachieving. Bottom line: The Giants could be 4-0, but instead are 2-2 and making major strides on both sides of the ball. There's a long way to go, but this team is starting to resemble the one I thought could make a deep run in the postseason.
