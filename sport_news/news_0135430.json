Leonard both made its fair share of mistakes in their District 10-8A matchup on Friday night, but the difference proved to be that the Eagles made the Lancers pay for their miscues on their way to a 34-0 road victory.\nOn each of its first two possessions, Atlantic (7-0, 4-0) wiped out long drives by fumbling the ball away. The Lancers (2-5, 2-2) followed those two turnovers with a punt and a fumble on their next two possessions, the latter of which came as the team was driving at the Eagles' 16-yard line.\nMeanwhile, with the game scoreless in the second quarter, the Eagles responded to the Leonard fumble with Shawndarrius Phillips hitting Corey Gammage for a 56-yard completion followed by a 35-yard touchdown pass to Samuel St. Surin.\nChanler Ferguson then picked off a Leonard pass on the ensuing possession and Atlantic came right back with a 48-yard touchdown drive, capped by a 15-yard run by Lamar Washington to take control of the game.\nFrom that point on it was all Eagles, who put the game away in the final two frames, outscoring Leonard 20-0 to cap off their second straight shutout. Phillips led the way offensively, as the senior quarterback finished the game completing all eight of his passes for 191 yards and three touchdowns.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5621acef/turbine/fl-atlantic-john-leonard-recap-1017-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:43:55.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
