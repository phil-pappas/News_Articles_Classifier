Courtesy Jim Killian/Provided × It wasn’t very funny at the time, but Charleston Southern junior center Jackson Williamson can’t help but laugh at his first game as a starter on CSU’s offensive line. That start came in Williamson’s first college game, as a true freshman, against city rival Citadel. Williamson earned the starting center job during fall camp but, due to an injury, he also was forced into long-snapping duties in the opening game. Midway through the first quarter, Williamson made his first mark on CSU football, snapping a ball over the punter’s head and through the end zone to give the Bulldogs a 2-0 lead. Needless to say, it was not a good beginning to what has been a very solid career. “It was scary,” said the 6-0, 280-pounder from Macon, Ga. “I think I graded out like 72 in that game. Awful. Going back and looking at the film from my freshman year, I don’t know how I ever got on the field.” But he did get on the field and he has yet to come off. Saturday’s game at Gardner-Webb will mark Williamson’s 32nd consecutive start at center for the Buccaneers, the nation’s 20th-ranked team in the latest FCS coaches poll. Charleston Southern, 5-1 overall and 2-0 in Big South play, enters the game on a four-game winning streak. With Williamson as the point man up front, CSU finished among the top 20 teams nationally in rushing offense in 2013 and 2014. This year’s offense is averaging 260 yards rushing per game. CSU offensive line coach Gabe Giardina, also the team’s offensive coordinator, admits it is very unusual for a true freshman to start at center on any level of college football. Out of necessity, Williamson was thrown into the fire early, something that Giardina says was never the plan. “Lord have mercy, no, we didn’t expect him to be a starter in that first season,” Giardina said. “We really didn’t have anyone else. As green as he was, he was our best option. “We were fortunate to have some more experienced, veteran guys around him so he relied a lot on those guys early on. But it wasn’t long before he knew what he was doing and took control of his role as a leader on the line.” Williamson was lightly recruited out of Jones County High School in Macon. He had offers from West Georgia and Carson Newman before making his final official visit to CSU just before signing day. “We had some contact with him when we were at Delta State, before taking this job, so we figured we’d roll the dice and offer him here,” CSU head coach Jamey Chadwell said. “It was a good gamble. He’s really become a force for us, a real leader. He’s tough as they come. He’s played through shoulders and knees. Most people would have missed time but he’s been our iron man. He’s been the one consistent guy all three years — a guy you can count on to come every day and give it all he’s got. We would not function as a unit without him out there. That’s how important he is to our success now.” Williamson credits his offensive line teammates, as well as learning film study, for his solid development as a leader on CSU’s line. “We had film study in high school but not as in-depth as we have here,” Williamson said. “I have a long ways to go but I feel like I learn something and I improve every day. I play with a great group of guys and together we work to help this football team win.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:19:21.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
