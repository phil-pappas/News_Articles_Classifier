State running back Tony Creecy (26). ¬ The Clemson Tigers played host to the North Carolina State Wolfpack at Memorial Stadium in Clemson Saturday, October 4, 2014. Gwinn Davis / Special to the Post and Courier CLEMSON – It’s hard to stay at or near the mountaintop, but Clemson’s making a habit of lingering in that conversation. Upon outlasting Notre Dame in a 24-22 nail-biter Saturday night, Clemson rose in the rankings to No. 6 in both the Associated Press and USA Today polls released Sunday. The Tigers (4-0, 1-0 ACC) were No. 12 in the AP poll last week, and took the spot of Notre Dame, which fell to No. 15. This marks Clemson’s first trip to the top ten since the final poll of 2013, after beating Ohio State in the 2014 Orange Bowl. It also means head coach Dabo Swinney will brandish a single-digit ranking at some point in four of his first seven full years at the helm, and a collective total of 22 weeks or polls. In the 17 seasons preceding Swinney’s full-time hiring, Clemson had a single-digit ranking for a total of six weeks: five straight weeks in 2000, and the preseason poll of 2008. It’s another feather in the cap of Swinney and his Tigers, who have won 42 straight games when leading after three quarters and hold a 6-4 record against top-ten opponents since Swinney took over. Overall, there was some shuffling in the top half of the poll. Four top-10 teams went down, including Notre Dame, helping Clemson, No. 8 Alabama, No. 9 Texas A&M and No. 10 Oklahoma climb into the top ten from a previous double-digit ranking. Utah, which was off this weekend, rose from No. 10 to No. 5. Defending national champion Ohio State stayed atop the poll, followed by No. 2 TCU, No. 3 Baylor and No. 4 Michigan State, giving the Big Ten and Big XII a duopoly on the first four spots. No. 6 Clemson is just a handful of voting points ahead of No. 7 LSU, the highest-ranked team out of the SEC. No. 11 Florida made the largest jump, up 14 spots after knocking off Ole Miss. The Rebels fell from third to No. 14 in the AP poll. No. 12 Florida State, which visits Clemson Nov. 7, actually fell one spot in the poll. Georgia and UCLA, previous top-ten members, fell to No. 19 and 20, respectively after losing to Alabama and Arizona State. New entrants to the top 25 include No. 22 Iowa, No. 23 Cal, No. 24 Toledo and No. 25 Boise State. \nAP POLL - Oct. 4 \nTeam (1st) Record Points Previous \n1. Ohio State (38) 5-0 1,444 1 \n2.
