It was a moment that I as a player dreamed about and as a coach I've dreamed about,\" Crouse said. \"To have it happen to me, it still doesn't seem real. It's amazing.\" \n\"I was never close as a player,\" Crouse said. \"But as a coach, obviously those priorities switch and it's not about me anymore. It's about wanting it for them. The team medal is something I've always wanted for them. It's the only occasion where the entire team gets acknowledgement. I wanted it for them and they wanted it.\" \nThird-seeded Notre Dame won the first district title in program history with a 3-2 win over top-seeded Bethlehem Catholic on Saturday at Northwood Racquet Club in Palmer Township. \n\"We know he really wanted to win team districts. He's been wanting that since the beginning of the season. So giving it to him and being able to do that just felt amazing,\" Notre Dame junior Julia Mowrey said. \nMowrey and the rest of the Crusaders singles players clinched the championship. \nMowrey posted a 6-3, 6-0 win over Brooke Adams at No. 3 singles. \nSenior Coco Chen and freshman Logan Lencheski , who won the program's first doubles title on Monday , also cruised to victories at their respective singles spots. \nChen had a 6-2, 6-1 win over Brenna Magliochetti at No. 1 singles and Lencheski had a 6-1, 6-2 victory against Molly Ehrig at second singles. \n\"We all have a lot of determination and love for it. I think we all want it as badly as the other,\" Lencheski said of the Crusaders singles players' success. \nNotre Dame will play District 4 champion South Williamsport in the first round of the state tournament at 2 p.m. Tuesday at West Branch Tennis Club in South Williamsport. \nIt's been quite a journey for the Crusaders the past couple years as they worked their way to the top of District 11 Class AA tennis. \n\"It was a rough outing the first couple years. The first year we got a couple wins. The next year barely fielded a team, had no wins. So it's been a nice turnaround these last couple of seasons,\" Crouse said. \"I think it's very fortunate that even the girls who stuck it out with us through the tough times, their passion for the game, their love for this game is transcendent to other members of the school. It has gotten more girls excited, more girls involved. Obviously they've put the effort in. They know what they wanted and were willing to work for it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:15:46.383+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
