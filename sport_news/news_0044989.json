They will also share resources regarding TV broadcasts. \nThe Open recently set up an office in China’s Hong Kong and the year’s first grand slam will show a documentary about Li’s career via its digital platform. \nMeanwhile, former world No. 1 Lleyton Hewitt has a wildcard into January’s Open to mark a record 20th-straight appearance at his national grand slam, which is also likely to be his last. \nThe 34-year-old, now ranked No. 296, had his best result when he finished runner-up in 2005 but hasn’t been past the second round in the last three years. \nTournament director Craig Tiley said in Melbourne at the launch of the 2016 Open yesterday: “We want to celebrate the great career Lleyton’s had but we need to sit down and talk with him because he will also want to focus on doing the best he can at the Open.” \nTiley said prize money for 2016 would rise by 10 percent to 44 million Australian dollars (US$32 million).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:13:11.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
