However, they couldn't maintain the pace once they had poked the Bears. \nUA scored nine unanswered goals to take a 10-4 lead before closing Sycamore out 11-6. \n\"For three quarters of the game, it went exactly how I thought it would go,\" Sycamore coach Nicholas Hellwig said. \"We came out fired up, ready to go. We played the game we needed to in those three quarters. Against top teams, you can't give up a bad quarter. Six goals in the third quarter is hard to come back from.\" \nEarly on in the game, the Aviators' passes were crisp, allowing them to set up their offense and bury shots in the back of the net. \nBut as the game wore on, the Aviators started turning the ball over and fatigue began to take its toll. That allowed the Bears to go on the offensive. \n\"They live on that counter-attack,\" Hellwig said. \"We could get to their first and second girl but we couldn't account for the third and fourth girl. That's where they beat us. That extra line through.\" \nEven though the rough ending to a good season wasn't what Hellwig and his team imagined, he said he wouldn't change a thing. \n\"It's been fantastic,\" he said. \"31 wins in a season is amazing. We were one short of the (school) record but I don't care. I'd give anything for them to have this season again.\" \nIn other state tournament action, Milford defeated Mason 10-9 in double overtime to finish in fifth place. The Comets finished sixth overall. \nMilford held a 7-6 lead with 32 seconds remaining in the fourth period when Mason called a timeout. After the restart, the timekeeper didn't start the clock. \nAmidst the consternation, the Comets scored to tie the game. \nIn the extra periods, the Eagles hung on to secure the victory. \n\"Table errors happen in any big match,\" Milford head coach Kevin Metzger said. \"All we can do when that happens is adapt, come back and win like we did. At the beginning of the year, we thought we had a really, really young team. From day one, they kept growing and figuring each other out. I couldn't have asked for a better turnout. We kept up with some of the top teams in the state. \" \nEarlier in the day, Princeton battled Sylvania in the ninth-place match. The Vikings fell 14-7, finishing in 10th place. 2 CONNECT 10 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1S3t9nB TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:11:13.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
