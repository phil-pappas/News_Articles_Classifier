All signs point to rookie lefty starting that game if the series advances that far.\n“As I sit here at this moment, I think he went too far tonight,” Collins said of bringing back deGrom on Tuesday. “He had to work hard.”\nMisplays \nMichael Cuddyer had a pair of misplays in the game that put runners in scoring position, but deGrom made sure the runs didn’t score.\nDeGrom misplayed a long drive from Justin Turner in the second into a leadoff double, and got a bad read on a drive from Corey Seager in the third that turned into a double.\nCuddyer went 0-for-3 and was pulled for a defensive replacement.\n“The ball really carried well,” Cuddyer said. “I just misread it.”\nFirst chance \nJeurys Familia threw 1 1/3 perfect innings to record his first postseason save in his first postseason game.\n“I’m not nervous, just excited to be there and help my team to win,” Familia said. “Just enjoy what I do, like I always say.”\nGreat inning \nHitting coach Kevin Long raved about the team’s seventh inning that resulted in two insurance runs that boosted the lead to 3-0.\nLucas Duda, Ruben Tejada and Curtis Granderson each walked against Clayton Kershaw, and knocked from the game, and David Wright had the two-RBI single.\nLong particularly complimented Tejada, who worked back from a 0-2 hole and earned a walk on the eight pitch of the at-bat.\n“The seventh inning was just a remarkable inning. And it’s three walks and a base hit,” Long said. “That’s all it was. That’s how you win games. ..I tip my cap to those guys in that room.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:55:03.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
