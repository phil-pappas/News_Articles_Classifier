QUINCY — The Concord Yellowjackets spoiled homecoming for the Quincy Orioles Friday night with a late touchdown, stealing a win 38-33. Quincy coach Rob Evans summed it up simply after the game, “that’s the way our season has gone.” “We have been just a click away all season,” he said. Evans said he was proud with the kid’s effort despite the loss. “We had a lot of underclassmen step up tonight,” he said. In his first start at running back for the Orioles, sophomore Jon Purvis scored two touchdowns and racked up 152 yards on 16 carries. Evans complimented Purvis on his effort after Friday night’s game. “He had a good night, we moved him from his guard position to the running back position for this game,” Evans said. The two touchdowns were Purvis’ first two touchdowns of his varsity career. Purvis scored at the 8:47 mark of the second quarter on a six-yard run and at the 7:43 mark of the fourth-quarter on a seven-yard run. Evans also complimented the effort of sophomore Bryce Ruhl. Ruhl had 149-yards on 11 carries for the game. “We had a lot of underclassman make plays tonight,” Evans said. Also scoring touchdowns for the Orioles were senior Josh Clark on a 47-yard pass play from Nathan Karney and a three-yard run in the third quarter. Senior Kalen Stahl also had a touchdown at the 5:56 mark of the third quarter when he caught a 66-yard pass from Karney. Karney had 144-yards of passing on the night and the Oriole offense had 420 rushing yards. Concord had 328 passing yards on the night and 279 rushing yards. The Orioles will play Thursday night in the Cascade Conference crossover game.
