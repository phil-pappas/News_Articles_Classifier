The struggles have amplified speculation that the coach and quarterback might be due for a change of scenery. Yet breaking ties with the duo would end the most successful run in team history and hinder their chances in the near future.\nSo, ahead of the Saints' Thursday night game against the Atlanta Falcons, we asked our NFL staff:\nShould the Saints think about moving on from Sean Payton and/or Drew Brees?\nLORENZO REYES\nWhen it comes to Brees, the Saints should start thinking about the future – though they shouldn’t rush to make a change. Truth is, most teams with an aging QB not named Tom Brady should do that. Even at 36 years old and in his 15th season, Brees is still serviceable, smart and accurate enough where he can make things work. But New Orleans should be realistic that the days of 5,000-yard seasons are probably done.\nPayton is a good coach with a Super Bowl ring. As the one with final say in personnel decisions, though, there are better options. Rather than to completely cut ties with Payton, a smarter choice would be to bring is a capable talent evaluator to work with general manager Mickey Loomis to allow Payton to focus on coaching. Whether Payton wants that to happen, however, is another question.\nUSA TODAY SPORTS WIRE\nUSA TODAY Sports' Week 6 NFL picks\nNATE DAVIS\nWhether or not the Saints want to move on from Drew Brees, who enjoys near Archie-esque status in the Big Easy, Father Time (and/or the salary cap) is going to force their hand – and perhaps sooner than later. But Payton presents an interesting dilemma. Conventional wisdom suggests diminishing returns for a coach who’s been with a team beyond 10 years. Payton is currently in his ninth season with the Saints and staring down the barrel of an extensive rebuild. Given the turmoil at the ownership level, it’s fair to say Payton is the driving force behind this franchise. But he’s also rumored to be the target of other franchises, who may be closer to a Lombardi Trophy and willing to surrender the draft picks for Payton that the Saints could really use to reboot. At the end of the day, the Saints should probably take their cues from Payton, a brilliant playcaller and proven coach. If he wants to construct a young, post-Brees team and feels his message can stay fresh with new players, you probably keep the marriage going. Otherwise, the Payton chip is probably one the Saints should cash in after the season.\nNew Orleans might need to consider life after Payton and Brees. (Photo: Chuck Cook, USA TODAY Sports)\nNANCY ARMOUR\nThere’s no question Brees is showing signs of his age and isn’t the quarterback he was five years ago. But neither he, nor Sean Payton, are the Saints’ biggest problem. Their offensive line is horrible; five games into the season, it’s already given up 15 sacks, tied for fifth-most in the league. It has limited their run game, too, which is practically non-existent at a paltry 3.6 yards per rush. Only three teams are averaging worse than their 85 yards a game.\nBrees and the Saints also are missing Jimmy Graham. Desperately. His replacement, Benjamin Watson, has all of 15 catches and one touchdown. Even more concerning, he’s only been targeted 21 times.\nBefore they ditch Brees and Payton, the Saints would be better giving them more to work with.\nUSA TODAY FANTASY SPORTS\nWeek 6 fantasy football rankings\nERIC PRISBELL\nI may be in the minority, but Sean Payton and Drew Brees both should be afforded the opportunity to stay with the franchise as long as they would like. For ages this franchise embodied on-field hopelessness. Payton and Brees were the ones who changed that. But clearly their connection to the franchise, and to the city, runs much, much deeper than that. What they and their Saints meant to New Orleans in the years after Hurricane Katrina can’t be overstated. This isn’t just any quarterback-coach tandem approaching the end of their run. And, to be clear, they are approaching the end of their run. But there are unique circumstances surrounding their impact in New Orleans. If Brees wants a chance to finish his career with another Super Bowl appearance, the best bet is to do that elsewhere. But it should be his decision. Same goes for Payton.\nMICHAEL MIDDLEHURST-SCHWARTZ\nThe Saints already showed last offseason that they're looking toward the future by stockpiling picks and overhauling the defense. And an NFL Network report saying Payton would listen to opportunities has ramped up speculation that this could be the coach's final year in New Orleans. General manager Mickey Loomis shouldn't be trigger-happy in parting with Brees and/or Payton, but it's something he must consider.\nThis Saints team is not one Brees is capable of carrying, especially in the quarterback's current state. A once-potent offense now looks devoid of playmakers. The defense, ranked last with 409 yards allowed per game, is a multiple-year rebuild. If Payton would command a significant return in picks from another team, New Orleans should embrace a new era. Brees shouldn't be pushed out, but a quarterback should be in play if the team is drafting in the top 10.\nPHOTOS: Week 6 games ranked by watchability\n14.
