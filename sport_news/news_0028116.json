He improved to 5-1 against Paire, who upset local favorite Kei Nishikori in the semifinals.\nPaire, who struggled with a sore left ankle, was broken four times and committed 12 unforced errors in the match.\n\"When I woke up this morning I couldn't walk,\" Paire said. \"One hour before the match it was very painful so I said 'what can we do?' I spoke with the physiotherapist and we got an anesthesia for my foot. I couldn't feel anything in my foot and it's tough to move when you don't feel your foot.\"\nWawrinka is the first Swiss winner in Tokyo since Roger Federer in 2006. In winning the Japan Open he adds his name to a list of champions that includes Rafael Nadal, Pete Sampras and John McEnroe.\n\"It's a big tournament for me,\" Wawrinka said. \"You've had some amazing winners here over the past. I got a lot of support here all this week and to add this title is very important for me.\"\nCopyright ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LoXuvQ&text=Top-seeded%20Wawrinka%20wins%20Japan%20Open%20for%204th%20title%20of%20year&via=usatoday", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/863fa09c4714a37465c1ceecbc4d51f06097d982/c=98-0-2903-2104&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/usatsports/a9ac6ea3b5d17e2d840f6a70670011a5.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1LoXuvQ&mini=true"], "published": "2015-10-11T10:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:10:01.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
