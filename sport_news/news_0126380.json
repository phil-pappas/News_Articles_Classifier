Sanders. But, Bernie, I don't think the revolution's going to come. And I don't think Congress is going to pay for a lot of this stuff.\"\nWith that jibe in Tuesday's Democratic presidential debate, Jim Webb tried to slam the door on the notion that Bernie Sanders is a serious candidate for the White House -- and at the same time posit himself as the best middle-of-the-road alternative.\nWebb, a gruff former U.S. senator from Virginia, has barely shown up in polls all year. His campaign has been so shoestring and under-the-radar that national reporters have complained that they can't get anyone from Webb's team to return phone calls.\nThe little-known candidate was strangely Lurch-like during the televised debate, as if he were wearing a body cast under his dark suit. But he did make the case that he's the Democrats' best hope for a successful presidency.\nThe Republicans in Congress have obstructed everything President Barack Obama has tried to do over the past seven years, preferring to grind government to a halt rather than compromise. Does anyone think it would be any different if Democratic front-runners Hillary Clinton or Sanders end up in the White House?\nThe GOP has a 25-year history of hating Clinton. No matter what the former secretary of state's goals are, no matter how leafy the olive branches she might offer, Republicans will continue to hate her. This might not be fair to Clinton, but it's a fact. Webb wants Democrats to ask themselves how she will get her agenda enacted into law.\nSame goes for Sanders. Republicans don't have the visceral, bizarre dislike for him that they have for Hillary, but he's an avowed Democratic Socialist. The party of free enterprise and corporate America thinks Sanders is ridiculous. Republicans will not offer him a single vote on a single issue. Not on his tax plan. Not on his free college plan. Not on a health-insurance-reform redo. Not on anything.\nIt's a shame that Democratic voters have to think about how their choice for president will be met by the opposing party in Congress. Not so long ago, presidents were given a honeymoon. The people had spoken, and the new occupant of the White House was allowed some freedom to prove voters had made the right choice. It was a Democratic House of Representatives, after all, that passed the Reagan tax cuts in the early 1980s.\nBut that was then. Democrats have to acknowledge the world as it is now, not as it should be.\nAnd so there is Webb. The 69-year-old writer-turned-politician is best known for opposing the war in Iraq, even going so far as to diss President George W. Bush at a White House reception. But he's not a former conscientious objector like Sanders . He's a military man, a decorated combat vet. Indeed, he sent shivers down many a spine Tuesday when he was asked who he was proud to have made a political enemy. His answer: the guy who made the mistake of throwing a grenade at him in Vietnam.\nJim Webb seems to suggest that he killed his greatest enemy. If this was a GOP debate, he'd have just won it.\nâ€” The National Memo (@NationalMemo) October 14, 2015 This tweet is exactly right. In a Republican debate, Webb's tough-guy response would have been a home run. But this was a Democratic event, so it seems his jocular reply sent some of the party's core voters diving under their beds.\nProgressives don't like that Webb could actually appeal to Republicans. Before the debate was even over, activist liberal news site Salon declared that Webb was the night's \"major loser.\" Salon writer Amanda Marcotte insisted he came across as \"obtuse and, at times, petulant.\" She criticized him for \"bragging about working for the Reagan administration and how he has 'a record of working across the political aisle.'\"\nYes, how dare he. Presidential candidates during primary season are expected to bash the other party, not insist they can find a way to work with it. Never mind that working across the political aisle is the only way to get anything substantive done in our system of government.\nThis much we know for sure: Webb made an impression with his performance in the first Democratic debate. \"In some ways, Webb was the most interesting, making it clear he didn't always go along with Democratic orthodoxy,\" wrote Jeff Mapes , The Oregonian's chief political writer.\nInteresting, or obtuse and petulant. Either way, it was a good start for Webb.\n-- Douglas Perry", "external_links": ["http://www.jameswebb.com/", "http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/bernie-sanders-applied-conscientious-objector-status-vietnam-campaign/story?id=33434041", "https://twitter.com/NationalMemo/status/654128146648834052", "http://www.salon.com/2015/10/14/jim_webb_is_the_biggest_loser_obtuse_petulant_out_of_touch/"], "published": "2015-10-14T17:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:06:42.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
