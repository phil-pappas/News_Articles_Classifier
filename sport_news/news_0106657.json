I want to be out there and playing but that's how it works. I have to wait for my chance and work hard in practice to get back in the lineup.\"\nJurco is a good skater and at 6-2 and 203 pounds, has the advantage of size. But it hasn't worked out that way yet, in the brief NHL career of the 22-year-old.\nHe had three goals in 63 games last season, and never found any offensive rhythm.\nOut of minor-league options, the Red Wings need to get a good read on Jurco this season as to whether he can be a productive player.\n\"I've got a lot of belief in Jurco, I've seen him be great for me at times,\" coach Jeff Blashill said of Jurco, who was a key player on Blashill's Grand Rapids Griffins team that won the 2013 Calder Cup. \"The No. 1 thing he has to do is skate and pressure on the forecheck and be a physical presence.\n\"In the simplest form, do a real good job of skating, and if you're going to make a mistake, make it out of skating.\"\nFriday return for Helm? \nDarren Helm looked to be on the brink of returning to the lineup. But now it looks like it might take a couple more days.\nHelm hasn't been able to completely shake off some concussion symptoms and now is aiming to make his season debut Friday against Carolina.\nHelm was involved in a violent collision the first 10 minutes of training camp during a practice drill and has yet to play in a game this season.\n\"We decided the best thing would be to wait a couple more days and go from there,\" said Helm, who also suffered a slight shoulder separation in the collision, although that's been cured. \"It's more the head (than the shoulder).\n\"There have been a few symptoms that have kind of plauteaued. I don't know if that was a mental thing or other stuff going on. We're just going to give it a couple of days and make sure it doesn't get worse, and hopefully I'll be good to go for Friday.\"\nHelm skated on the fourth line during Monday's practice before seeing the doctors later in the day.\nHelm said he passed the baseline concussion test, but it will take several games to get into the conditioning he wants to be at after missing the entire training camp and exhibition season.\nIce chips \nDanny DeKeyser (foot) participated in Tuesday's morning skate and impressed Blashill.\n\"He looked good out there,\" Blashill said. \"I haven't had an upate from our training staff and we haven't really spoken because he was inside of the window where we thought he'd be out, but he looked real good.\"\nDeKeyser strained ligaments in his left foot Sept. 30 against Pittsburgh and was expected to miss approximately a month.\n... Blashill will reunite Dylan Larkin with Henrik Zetterberg and Justin Abdelkader, while putting Johan Franzen with Brad Richards and Tomas Tatar, and placing Gustav Nyquist with Riley Sheahan and Teemu Pulkkinen.\n\"We're just looking for the best combintations,\" Blashill said.\nted.kulfan@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/tkulfan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:22:11.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
