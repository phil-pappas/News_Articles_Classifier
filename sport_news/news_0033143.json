In Part 1 of 5 today, we’ll analyze the starting rotation. \nSeason Review \nPerhaps the Nationals’ starting rotation could never be as good as it was supposed to be, because it was supposed to be legendary. Month-long unhittable stretches by Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg supported the notion that it could have been, had all parties been healthy, consistent, and consistently healthy. \nBut Scherzer lapsed when the Nationals needed him most. Strasburg battled injuries. Jordan Zimmermann pitched well more often than not — but not as well, as often, as he did in 2014. Gio Gonzalez overhauled his approach, got groundballs, but battled career-long troubles with command. Doug Fister fell away, Joe Ross emerged, and Tanner Roark filled in, all of which combined to give the Nationals the seventh-best starters’ ERA in baseball (3.70), the third-most strikeouts (921) and the eighth-most innings pitched (966 1/3). \nThose numbers indicate a strong season, but disappoint when compared with the league-leading 3.04 ERA the rotation posted over 1002 1/3 in 2014. Even with the addition of a former Cy Young award winner in Scherzer, they did not pitch as deep into games, or pitch as well, as they did in 2014. \nBore into the numbers further and discover that this Nationals rotation was, nevertheless, very good: Their starters combined to earn 18 wins above replacement, tied for the second most among any team behind the Cubs. Their FIP (fielding independent pitching) was 3.42, fourth-best in the big leagues. Their strikeout-to-walk ratio, 4.15, was second to the Mets. \nFor the most part, outside of a six week period in August and September — a fairly crucial one, unfortunately — Scherzer lived up to his billing. He threw two no-hitters, struck out 16 batters in one game and 17 in another, earned National League pitcher of the month twice, and set a team record with 276 strikeouts — second to Clayton Kershaw for most in the majors. Home runs derailed him in the second half. He allowed seven in the first three months of the season, then no fewer than six in any of the final three months, finishing with 27 home runs allowed, fifth-most in the majors. He won 14 games and pitched deep enough to lose 12, too. As Scherzer himself said multiple times, he came up just short of giving the Nationals what they needed in several key starts. His fellow starters did, too. \nStrasburg dominated when he was healthy, but he was not healthy until the second half. Once his back trouble subsided and his mechanics steadied, Strasburg had Cy Young stuff. His 10.96 strikeouts per nine innings was second to Kershaw among starters who threw at least 100 innings, just ahead of Scherzer. His changeup reemerged and his confidence did, too. Had he pitched the way he did in the last two months of the season all season, well… \nNext comes Zimmermann, who was good, but not great, assessment of his season molded by the standards he set in previous ones. He finished in the top 30 in ERA (3.66), and his characteristically high strikeout-to-walk ratio was again this season — 4.21, 14th best in baseball. He won 13 games this year, one fewer than last, and threw two fewer innings total. But that ERA jumped a full run and the strikeout-to-walk ratio dropped by two strikeouts. Zimmermann finished this year as a good major league starter by all numerical accounts. But though he was as consistent as any National, he was not the ace he was in 2013 and 2014. \nGio Gonzalez compiled the 10th best WAR of any major league starter. With an increased emphasis on groundballs, he turned in the eighth-highest groundball rate in the majors with nearly 54 percent, by far the highest of his career. Often, he was very good, but he was not good too often, still unable to shake the demon that pickpockets his command for innings at a time, dooming starts and games with walks and missed location: He walked more hitters per nine innings (3.54) than he has in any of his four seasons as a National. \nFister battled injury and mechanical trouble so unsuccessfully that he was moved to the bullpen, clearing permanent space for rookie Joe Ross. Ross, who pitched well enough to convince many in the organization that he will be a part of that rotation for some time, compiled 1.4 WAR in 76 2/3 innings — exactly the same number Fister accumulated when he led the team in ERA in 2014. \nStats like those can deceive: These Nationals starters earned 18.0 WAR, and the 2014 Nationals’ starters 18.1. Last year’s team won 96 games. This team won 83, in part because the starting rotation did not pitch as well as it could have, as often as it should have. \nOffseason outlook \nJordan Zimmermann and Doug Fister are free agents, and will almost certainly sign elsewhere next year. The rotation will look different. But the Nationals nevertheless enter this offseason in the same position they entered last year’s: With five strong candidates that could fill a formidable starting rotation, not necessarily needing to add. Last year, they signed Scherzer anyway. \nWith Zimmermann gone, the Nationals still have two elite starters in Scherzer and Strasburg, and Gonzalez will be back to anchor the middle, too. Tanner Roark won 15 games in 2014, and should get a full season of starts in 2016. He showed signs of his former self late in 2015 after he settled back into starting after being tossed from role to role. Ross seems likely to begin the season in the big league rotation, a sign of optimism given his early success. But General Manager Mike Rizzo has said repeatedly that pitching is key and emphasizes depth there. Despite having five legitimate starting candidates, he may choose to add more. \nPossible free agent targets \nThe Nationals payroll spiked to more than $162 million this season, highest in team history. In Zimmermann, Fister, Denard Span, Ian Desmond and others likely to depart, the Nationals clear plenty of space to add major pieces in free agency, should they want to do so. But they may not, opting instead to let the payroll dip nearer the mean. Their tattered bullpen needs an overhaul and the lineup has holes. The rotation would not seem to be a financial priority. It wasn’t supposed to be last year, either. \nShould the Nationals decide to add, there are elite starters to be had — namely Dodgers right-hander Zack Greinke, always enigmatic but recently unhittable. The 32-year-old would be due a six-figure, multi-year deal should he opt out of the remaining three years of his deal. Other big names loom, too: David Price, Jeff Samardzija, Mike Leake, Scott Kazmir and Yovani Gallardo are all becoming free agents this season, all around 30 years old, seemingly poised for long-term deals. Should the Nationals decide to lock down the top of their rotation ahead of Strasburg’s free agency next winter, they can take their pick. \nBut perhaps more likely, given the young pitching depth in the Nationals organization and the confidence Rizzo and his staff have in it, the Nationals may look to add a proven middle- or back-of-the-rotation starter to provide reliable innings at a less exorbitant price. Dodgers right-hander and groundball specialist Brett Anderson — who won 10 games with a 3.69 ERA this year — will be 28 next season. Rizzo drafted him when he was with the Diamondbacks in the third round of the 2006 draft, one pick after some kid named Maxwell Scherzer. Orioles left-hander Wei Yin Chen and Padres right-hander Ian Kennedy — both Scott Boras clients — are also free agents. That tier of pitcher may be the kind Rizzo targets to stabilize his rotation until highly touted youngsters mature. \nProspect to watch \nLucas Giolito, top pitching prospect in baseball according to Baseball America, is on his way. He finished the 2015 season in Class AA Harrisburg, and seems likely to begin next season — when he will be 21 in spring training — there or in Class AAA Syracuse. But he may find his way to the big leagues next season. Once he does, the Nationals expect him to stay there for a very long time. \nRoss likely earned himself a spot in the rotation, barring major offseason acquisitions. He will be starting his second season in the Nationals organization, not bouncing between levels, comfortable with major league life and teammates. \nHard-throwing left-hander Reynaldo Lopez, who also finished the 2015 season in Class AA Harrisburg, might knock on the door. Right-hander A.J. Cole, still 24, could earn another chance after a disappointing big league debut in 2015. Should the Nationals need to pull from the minor leagues to fill in again, they will reach into a still-deep pool of prospects to do so — with one front-of-the-rotation type nearly ready to earn his first major league chance.
