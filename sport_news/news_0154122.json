The lengthy ballot initiative lays out a regulatory and taxation scheme for cannabis and creates a network of 10 authorized growing facilities, which have already attracted private investors.\nHere are answers to some key questions about the proposal:\n___\nWHAT ARE THE ARGUMENTS BEHIND THE POT PLAN?\nBackers of legalization say passage of the amendment would get rid of failed marijuana laws that have contributed to the incarceration of thousands of nonviolent drug offenders and allow doctors and caregivers to provide pot to sick patients. Supporters claim the proposal would create jobs and generate tax revenue for communities.\nOpponents include business and farmers' groups, law enforcement associations and medical organizations. They cite the potential for pot-infused products to end up in children's hands, workplace safety issues and other concerns. Critics also argue it lets a small group of investors create a billion-dollar marijuana monopoly.\n___\nWHO WOULD REGULATE MARIJUANA UNDER THE PLAN?\nThe proposal creates a new agency called the Ohio Marijuana Control Commission, whose seven members would be appointed by the governor. The commission would set rules for growing, processing, testing, taxing, distributing and selling marijuana, medical marijuana and marijuana-infused products, such as candy, baked goods and other edibles.\nIt would license marijuana-growing facilities, consumer retail stores across the state and not-for-profit medical marijuana dispensaries. Commission members would set requirements on chemical content and potency of pot-infused products.\n___\nWHERE WOULD GROWING SITES BE LOCATED?\nThe designated sites are in Butler, Clermont, Delaware, Franklin, Hamilton, Licking, Lorain, Lucas, Stark and Summit counties. These would be the wholesalers that grow, cultivate and extract marijuana for commercial sale or medical use.\n___\nWHO WOULD QUALIFY TO USE MEDICAL MARIJUANA?\nPeople with debilitating medical conditions could get medical marijuana at not-for-profit dispensaries if they have a certification from their doctor. Patients don't have to be 21. Those younger than 18 would need a parent's permission.\n___\nCOULD PEOPLE WITHOUT A MEDICAL CONDITION BUY MARIJUANA?\nYes, in an arrangement similar to today's liquor stores, retail stores would be licensed to sell to those age 21 and older. The proposal potentially allows for more than 1,100 such establishments, a number arrived at based on the state's population.\n___\nCOULD OHIOANS GROW IT AT HOME?\nYes, with certain restrictions. Home-growers would pay a $50 registration fee with the commission. They could not have more than four flowering marijuana plants and eight ounces of usable homegrown marijuana at a given time for personal use. Adults could share a certain amount of pot.\n___\nWERE THERE ISSUES WITH THE BALLOT LANGUAGE?\nYes. The group behind the proposal, ResponsibleOhio, challenged the ballot language and title at the Ohio Supreme Court, claiming certain wording was inaccurate and intentionally misleading. The high court allowed the title to stand, but said part of the ballot wording was flawed and ordered a state board to rewrite it. Backers and opponents of Issue 3 have said they are satisfied with the ballot language revisions that voters will see.\n___\nDOES THE WORD \"MONOPOLY\" REMAIN IN THE BALLOT DESCRIPTION?\nYes. It's in the title: \"Grants a monopoly for the commercial production and sale of marijuana for recreational and medicinal purposes.\" ResponsibleOhio had argued in filings to the state's Supreme Court that the proposal doesn't establish a monopoly because more than one marijuana producer is involved in the commercial market. But siding with Secretary of State Jon Husted, the court said the title was not misleading, inaccurate or \"persuasive in nature.\"", "external_links": ["http://media.graytvinc.com/images/14159.jpg", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/299*168/14159.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:04:41.781+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
