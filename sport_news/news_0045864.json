The post was lying vacant since incumbent Jagmohan Dalmiya died in Kolkata on September 20. Manohar, a lawyer by profession, earlier held the top post from 2008 to 2011. The 58-year-old was elected for a full two-year term as all the six East Zone cricket units unanimously proposed his candidature for the board president's post. \"We have to work on a couple of issues regarding the board and restore the lost reputation as early as possible. I need two months' time, in which I will look into all the aspects,\" Manohar said after taking over as the president. The major reforms announced by the president include the appointment of ombudsman to address all the conflict of interest issues, appointment of independent auditors to check how the state associations are spending the BCCI's annual grants and upload BCCI’s balance sheets on board’s website. — IANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:31:00.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
