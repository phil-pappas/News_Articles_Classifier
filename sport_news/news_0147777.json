Franklin, who qualified fastest with a time of 2 minutes 4.06 seconds, won the gold, while Seebohm took silver with a time of 2:05.81. Hosszu settled for bronze with a time of 2:06.81. \nOther cancelled races included the men's 200-meter butterfly and women's 50-meter freestyle. \nAfter organizers released a statement and cancelled the evening session, noting the \"upward trend\" of the PSI readings, it hit the day's high of 242. \nThe morning session of heats was held as planned, and two more sessions Sunday were scheduled to go ahead. \nIn the Singapore leg of the event, four sessions were to run over two days this weekend. The event had earlier run in cities such as Moscow, Hong Kong and Beijing. The next leg is to be held in Tokyo on Oct. 28 and 29. \nAt a meeting held in Jakarta on Oct. 1, Indonesian officials turned down Singapore's repeated offers to help with fire-fighting operations, saying they could handle it on their own, although earlier Vice President Jusuf Kalla had said the country was open to help from all countries including Singapore.
