Not when redshirt freshman quarterback Zach Bednarczyk - who earned his second start after John Robertson's season-ending injury - absorbed punishment and tossed a pair of interceptions while going 13 of 31 for 164 yards and no touchdowns.\nAnd especially not when the Tribe scored five straight touchdowns to go from trailing late in the first quarter to leading by 38-10 early in the fourth. \nDown by 10-3 at the end of the first quarter, William and Mary put Villanova away in the second quarter with three explosive plays, sandwiching safety DeAndre Houston-Carson's 94-yard interception return for a touchdown between running back Kendell Anderson's 71-yard touchdown run and a 53-yard TD pass from quarterback Steve Cluley to wideout Christian Reeves with 1 minute, 12 seconds left in the half. \nTribe coach Jimmye Laycock didn't think Robertson's presence would have mattered. \n\"I don't know if he would have made a difference today the way we got after [Bednarczyk] with the pressure we got on him, and the things we did,\" Laycock said. \nLast season, Robertson, the Walter Payton Award winner, threw a game-winning touchdown pass against the Tribe with less than a minute to play. The year before, Robertson won the game on a 1-yard touchdown run in the final 30 seconds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:58:21.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
