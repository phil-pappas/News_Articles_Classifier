What was the message?\n\"What we just did,\" McPhee said. \"That's the message. When we lock arms, we're going to win. We've got to make sure them arms stay locked the rest of the season. I think we can do damage. That's what it's about. Us playing as a brotherhood and us going out there fighting for each other.\"\nMcPhee led the fighting. His interception of a pass bobbled by running back Latavius Murray set up a field goal just before halftime. With the Raiders looking to run down the clock in the closing minutes, McPhee exploded through the line on third-and-2 to blow up Roy Helu for a 1-yard loss.\nRich Campbell and Brad Biggs on Jay Cutler stepping up Rich Campbell and Brad Biggs on Jay Cutler stepping up when the Bears needed him most.\nRich Campbell and Brad Biggs on Jay Cutler stepping up when the Bears needed him most.\nSee more videos That forced the Raiders to kick a field goal with 2 minutes, 5 seconds remaining when a first down would have given them a chance to chew up the rest of the time and would have, at minimum, forced Bears coach John Fox to burn his timeouts.\nThe Bears classified McPhee as an ascending player when they signed him to a five-year, $38.75 million contract because he'd been a part-time player with the Ravens. As advertised, he has been a physical and violent force. Turns out, he was quite deserving of the captain's C he received as well. Fox said he brings a mindset \"that was needed.\"\n\"It's rare that guys can actually come together,\" running back Matt Forte said. \"It's more than just playing football together. Actually knowing the person, knowing their family, and we're not just teammates. We're out there and (we're) brothers, and you go out there and fight for each other. I'd fight more for my brother than somebody who was just a teammate. People definitely took it to heart and listened to what he was saying.\"\nWhat does a Bears win under John Fox look like? Steve Rosenbloom So that’s what a Bears victory under John Fox looks like.\nI wasn’t sure when we’d see that rarity, or if we’d see it before the Bears traveled to Tampa to face Lovie Smith’s Buccaneers two days after Christmas.\nBut there it was Sunday against the Raiders, as Robbie Gould drilled a 49-yard field...\nSo that’s what a Bears victory under John Fox looks like.\nI wasn’t sure when we’d see that rarity, or if we’d see it before the Bears traveled to Tampa to face Lovie Smith’s Buccaneers two days after Christmas.\nBut there it was Sunday against the Raiders, as Robbie Gould drilled a 49-yard field...\n(Steve Rosenbloom) When your best players are your best leaders, that's when you have a core in place to build upon. That's what the Bears look like they have in the 26-year-old McPhee, who was not fazed when Allen, who the Bears paid $11.5 million in March, and linebacker Jon Bostic were traded Tuesday.\n\"We have enough guys out here, you know, that we can get the job done,\" McPhee said. \"I loved playing with Jared. He ain't here right now and we can't dwell on it. So we have to just push forward.\"\nMcPhee said he recognized where the run to Helu was going based on film study. The defense needed a stop after Cutler had thrown a bad interception when it looked like the Bears were going to put the game away.\n\"I didn't even shake one little bit,\" McPhee said. \"It was, 'Well, time for me to go do my job. Make a play.' That's what I did.\n\"We saw guys who we have been waiting on to make plays, make plays. That's exciting.\"\nOne of them was cornerback Tracy Porter, who went from playing five snaps in his first game of the season last week in Seattle to being asked to follow Raiders wide receiver Amari Cooper from side to side.\nComing off consecutive 100-yard games, Cooper was targeted a team-high nine times but caught only four passes for 49 yards. His 26-yard touchdown on a corner route from the slot came against nickel cornerback Sherrick McManis as Porter only covered him on the outside.\nPorter was signed to a one-year deal for the minimum, a veteran who has performed for teams Pace and Fox have been with before. He could push for more playing time immediately.\nThe defense made strides in the loss to the Seahawks and came up big in the first win. Maybe McPhee is starting a little something in a season in which most assume the Bears will take some lumps.\n\"I am on a mission,\" McPhee said. \"That is my emotion. Playoffs. Win. Turn it around.\"\nbmbiggs@tribpub.com\nTwitter @BradBiggs\n Pernell McPhee Chicago Bears Jared Allen Roy Helu Tracy Porter Seattle Seahawks Jermon Bushrod", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5611ccc3/turbine/ct-rich-campbell-and-brad-biggs-on-jay-cutler-stepping-up-20151004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56127c20/turbine/ct-biggs-pernell-mcphee-spt-1005-20151004", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56127d3d/turbine/ct-bears-beat-raiders-rosenbloom-20151004"], "published": "2015-10-05T04:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:55:25.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
