It was great last year even when we weren’t a part of it. It was amazing to watch.” \nFor four-time champion Gordon, it is his last kick at the can as he retires at the end of this season and he said it will pretty much be all out all the time on Sunday for him. \n“You have to be a little more aggressive (at Talladega),” he said. “I watched Dale Jr., and a few other guys who protect their position when they’re up front aggressively. \n“But I can tell you that it’s a lot harder than it used to be; people are smarter, cars are more equal, and the draft and aerodynamics are different than they used to be.” \nGordon did get a leg up on the competition, winning the pole on a lap of 194.500 mph. \nKenseth said there are any number of things that will affect the outcome of the race and he views it as a giant chess game where a move early in the race can make a difference late in the race. \n“It’s all about being in the right place and being positioned properly and not making just the right moves for yourself, but yet the moves that the rest of the cars make too and certainly being a race in the Chase everybody’s kind of on a different agenda or some people are locked in and are just going to help their teammates — there’s all kinds of different scenarios,” he said. \nNewman, who last year made it through to the final Chase race at Homestead without ever winning a race, sees three scenarios in his quest to repeat that feat. \n“You can have a strategy where you know you have a car that can stay up front, you can think you have a car that can stay up front, stay in the middle all day and race and get crashed or cause a crash, or you can watch everybody from the back and try and learn and go at the end,” he said. \nCANUCK HAYLEY COMES UP BIG \nWhen the 2015 NASCAR Camping World Truck Series season started back at Daytona International Speedway, rookie Cameron Hayley said he was apprehensive about racing on the big superspeedways, tracks that were totally new to the 19-year-old Calgary native. \nOn Saturday, he steered his way through a series of late-race wrecks to bring home the No. 13 ThorSports Racing Toyota sixth — his best big-track finish of the season at Talladega Superspeedway. \n“I’m starting to like these two-and-a-half mile tracks,” Hayley said after getting out of his truck. \nAnd so he should because when the checkered flag ended the race only about a third of the 32 cars that started the Fred’s 250 finished without some sort of damage. \n“We were up and down all day,” Hayley said of the race won by Timothy Peters. “I mean I am happy, we avoided all the wrecks.” \nHe was running eighth when the final caution came out after a massive wreck that took out 10 trucks. \n“I think we could have had a top-five (finish) but we had to restsart on the outside lane which was not the preferred line,” Hayley said. \nNow it’s off to the tiny half-mile Martinsville Speedway oval next week, something he is looking forward to. \n“It’s the kind of track I grew up racing on,” Hayley said.
