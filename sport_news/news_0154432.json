Lamar Odom and Sasha Vujacic came from entirely different worlds but arrived together in Los Angeles with the Lakers 11 years ago. One was a talented veteran, trying to prove he could be an important piece to a championship team. The other was a 21-year-old kid from Europe just trying to prove he belonged.\n\"We played a long time together… we won together,\" Vujacic said on Wednesday. \"We understood what it means to be in a band of brothers. What it means to go through a lot of things together. It's just life. It takes a different direction later on. It's sad in a way. He's someone with a heart of gold. And right now he's fighting the battle of his life. We should all be cheering him on in our thoughts and prayers. I think he'll win this battle.\"\nThe news of Odom, who is in critical condition in a Las Vegas hospital after he was found unconscious at a Nevada brothel on Tuesday, hit the Knicks particularly hard. Vujacic and Knicks head coach Derek Fisher were Odom's teammates with the Lakers. Phil Jackson, Kurt Rambis, Jim Cleamons and Rasheed Hazzard were either coaches or scouts during Odom's seven seasons with the purple and gold.\nAlso, Carmelo Anthony was Odom's Olympic teammate in 2004 and considers him a close friend whose love of basketball was second to none.\n\"All he cared about was playing basketball,\" Anthony said following Wednesday's practice in Westchester. \"He wanted to give back to the league. He wanted to play. That's all he cared about. Every time I talked to him that's all he talked about, playing basketball, getting back on the court, wanting to put that jersey back on. So it's sad to see him in the situation he's in right now.\n\"He was a friend of mine. It's a sad situation to be a part of, just to be in, to see this whole story of where he was at as a player, as a person, and to see where he's at right now. The only thing you can do is pray for him, pray for his family right now.\"\nAndrew D. Bernstein/NBAE/Getty Images Carmelo Anthony and good friend Lamar Odom have shared many memorable moments together on the basketball court. Odom, who was a playground legend in New York City, briefly joined the Knicks prior to the final game of the 2013-14 season but never played for the team. He remained under contract until July 12, 2014 when was released. Jackson, the Knicks president, said at the time: \"Unfortunately, Lamar was unable to uphold the standards to return as an NBA player.\" Jackson was unavailable for comment on Wednesday.\n\"That really didn't matter to me,\" Fisher said. \"I know he wanted to get back on the court at some point but it's always been about his health and that's what I'm hoping will be the focus here.\"\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE.\nOdom's personal life has become the source of gossip tabloids in recent years following his marriage and subsequent divorce to reality TV star Khole Kardashian. Anthony has also lived a very public life and his wife, La La, also has a reality show yet Anthony rarely appears on the show.\n\"I know how to compartmentalize (my public life),\" Anthony said. \"I know when it's time to play ball. I know when it's time to work it's about business. I know off the court I do what I have to do with my family, my business and things like that. So it's different. You have to know how to manage that, those two different lifestyles.\"\nTags: lamar odom , sasha vujacic", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:10:21.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
