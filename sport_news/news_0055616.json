Thursday night's game included :\n1. Patriots (3-0) - An early bye week isn’t great, but they can rest, recharge and continue plotting their revenge.\n2. Packers (3-0) - Backup QB Scott Tolzien says watching Aaron Rodgers is like “watching (Michael) Jordan in his prime.” With no tongue sticking out, of course.\n3. Cardinals (3-0) - Carson Palmer has as many touchdown passes as Tom Brady (nine). What’s his excuse? Is he on a Vengeance Tour, too?\n4. Broncos (3-0 ) - Putting Peyton Manning in the shotgun helps. So would a running game. They’re 31st in the NFL, which doesn’t help a guy who can’t throw.\n5. Bengals (3-0) - Andy Dalton is doing his best to lure you in with his usual September splash. Four words for that: Do it in January.\n6. Falcons (3-0) - Some athletes shatter records. Then there’s Julio Jones. He’s on pace to obliterate marks for receptions (181) and yards (2,346).\n7. Panthers (3-0) - If you can put up points with a receiving crew featuring Ted Ginn, Philly Brown and Brenton Bersin, take a bow, Cam Newton.\n8. Steelers (2-2) - If no one’s seen kicker Josh Scobee since Thursday night’s debacle against the Ravens, he might already be in witness protection.\n9. Seahawks (1-2 ) - Shutouts are nice. But let’s not get too excited. It was only the Bears.\n10. Bills (2-1) - Definition of an obsession: Rex Ryan talks about the Patriots every week. Hello, is he even playing the Patriots?\n11. Vikings (2-1) - Adrian Peterson leads the NFL in rushing. Get used to that sentence. It’s not going away.\n12. Chiefs (1-2) - Stop the presses. A receiver caught a touchdown pass for the first time in two years. (Lot of good that did them in Green Bay).\n13. Jets (2-1) - Don’t say you weren’t warned. Ryan Fitzpatrick turned into a pumpkin. It is, what it is.\n14. Cowboys (2-1) - If only Brandon Weeden was their worst problem. Try having a defense that can't cover, pressure, or stop the run.\n15. Colts (1-2) - Andrew Luck is an interception machine. Luckily for the Colts, he’s also a fourth quarter escape artist.\n16. Chargers (1-2) - Thus far, they haven’t met a running game they could stop. How about giving some tackling lessons. That might help.\n17. Eagles (1-2) - DeMarco Murray could get a complex. They can’t run or win when he plays. But, they ran for a ton, and won - without him.\n18. Giants (1-2) - Eli Manning has yet to throw an interception this season. He’s gone 108 passes without one. There, we just jinxed him.\n19. Ravens (1-3) - How did they pull out a season-saving win in Pittsburgh? They have Justin Tucker. The Steelers don’t.\n20. Raiders (2-1) - Spoiler alert: They’re about to win three games in the first four weeks for the first time since 2002. Why? They play the Bears next.\n21. Rams (1-2) - Still waiting for the power run game that was promised. How about any run game?\n22. Dolphins (1-2) - Forget Ndamukong Suh’s contract. What about Ryan Tannehill’s rich new deal? Bet they’re loving his 59.7 passer rating on South Beach.\n23. Texans (1-2) - The good news? They’re in first place in the AFC South. The bad? They’re also in last place in the AFC South.\n24. Titans (1-2) - Sign that Marcus Mariota is pretty darn good? The Titans lead the league in 20-plus yard passing plays.\n25. Lions (0-3) - They’re bad at a lot of things, but no one’s worse at running the football. Lead back Joique Bell has 22 yards on 20 carries.\n26. Browns (1-2) - Watching Johnny Manziel lose would be far more entertaining than anything Josh McCown does, don’t you think?\n27. Redskins (1-2) - Kirk Cousins isn’t cutting it. So now what? Go back to RG-3, a guy you don’t want? Good luck with that.\n28. 49ers (1-2) - Colin Kaepernick has thrown 4 touchdown passes this season. Two to his team. Two to the other team.\n29. Buccaneers (1-2) - Last thing a team like this needs to see? Their kicker missing three field goals and an extra point.\n30. Jaguars (1-2) - Forcing a team to punt once would be an improvement over last week.\n31. Saints (0-3) - Don’t even think of blaming Luke McCown. Not with that defense.\n32. Bears (0-3) - Monsters of the Midway? Yeah, right. They’re already cashing in their chips and selling off parts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:36:23.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
