Ben Carson came in second with 14 percent, just ahead of Marco Rubio at 12 percent with Jeb Bush (7.1 percent), Carly Fiorina (6.5 percent), and Ted Cruz (5.1 percent) following.\nWhen Emerson polled GOP voters in March—before Trump had entered the race—Bush led all contenders with 19 percent support, with Carson at 13 percent and Rand Paul at 7 percent.\n Emerson also surveyed the Democratic field. Among 265 likely Bay State primary voters, Hillary Clinton leads Bernie Sanders 59 percent to 25 percent. No other Democratic candidate polled over 5 percent.\nIn a WBUR poll released in June , Clinton led Sanders in the state 59 percent to 8 percent. Sixteen percent of voters in that poll said they would support Elizabeth Warren for the Democratic nomination. Emerson’s poll this week shows that the former secretary of state has maintained a strong majority among Democratic voters, though Sanders seems to have picked up many former Warren supporters.\nThough hugely popular among Democrats, Clinton might have problems with independent voters in Massachusetts.\nDespite what Sanders might have said in the Democratic debate , Clinton’s use of a private email server continues to be an issue among independents. Forty-seven percent of independent voters said it made them less likely to vote for Clinton and 56 percent said her email practices harmed the country’s foreign policy.\nThe poll also noted that independents make up “roughly half the state electorate.”\nEmerson also asked respondents for their opinions on a few local issues of the day.\nFifty-one percent of Massachusetts residents surveyed said the New England Patriots will repeat this year and win Super Bowl 50. And 48 percent endorsed the return of Boston Red Sox manager John Farrell in 2016, compared to 22 percent who said he shouldn’t get another chance after two last-place division finishes.\nVoters overwhelmingly supported (71 percent) the Boston Police Departments pilot program to equip local officers with body cameras. Massachusetts was split on the issue of legalized recreational marijuana, with 41 percent supportive and 48 percent opposed. The state will vote on the issue in a 2016 ballot question.", "external_links": ["http://s3.amazonaws.com/media.wbur.org/wordpress/1/files/2015/06/Topline-2015-06-WBUR-Statewide-1-Political.pdf", "http://media.wix.com/ugd/3bebb2_82a741918bee4d2aa3685dddc0aebff1.pdf", "http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2016/president/ma/massachusetts_republican_presidential_primary-5205.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:14:21.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
