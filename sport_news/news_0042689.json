The club took 16 first-period shots and were creating chances early.\nThe power play still didn't convert (0-for-3) but the penalty kill was in midseason form and did not allow a shot-against over the course of two consecutive power plays by the Senators. Ottawa finished 0-for-3 on the man advantage.\nMarc-Andre Fleury, who finished with a 21-save shutout, turned away a Bobby Ryan shot off an odd man rush in the first period to preserve a scoreless game.\nThe Penguins next face the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday.\n(c)2015 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette\nVisit the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette at www.post-gazette.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738501&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738501&h=Penguins+sink+Senators+for+first+win+of+season", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738501"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:04:07.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
