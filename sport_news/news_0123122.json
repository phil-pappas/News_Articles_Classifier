Their father ran the family-owned Knudtson Manufacturing firm, and all four boys became skilled with their hands, Jones said.\nDaryl Knudtson served in the Navy in the early 1960s, assigned to the U.S.S. Bryce Canyon , Jones said. He helped build the U.S.S. Arizona Memorial to Pearl Harbor victims , dedicated in 1962, she said.\nAfter leaving the service, he worked as a self-employed millwright for many years, Jones said. He had lived with a roommate at the tidy apartment complex just east of Southeast Cesar Chavez Boulevard for 25 years.\nBoth Knudtson and his roommate died Friday. Jones declined to name the roommate, because his nearest relative has not yet been notified. Both men were in ill-health, she said, Her father could no longer walk and spent most of his time in bed.\nKnudston is succeeded by his former wife, Sharon Knudtson of Vancouver, and all four of his children.\n Fire investigators said Saturday that the fire was caused by discarded cigarettes or other smoking materials . It was unclear which man was smoking. Their apartment, part of a larger three-building complex, was 40 percent destroyed, Portland Fire & Rescue spokesman Ron Rouse said.\nFirefighters responded within two minutes of receiving a call that fire had been spotted at an apartment in the 3900 block. They found smoke and flames rising out of the building.\nFirefighters pulled the two men from their apartment, but medics were unable to save either man, Rouse said. One died Friday morning; the other died in the hospital Friday evening.\n-- Betsy Hammond\nbetsyhammond@oregonian.com", "external_links": ["http://oregonlive.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Return%20to%20the%20photo%20gallery&backurl=http%3A%2F%2Fphotos.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2F2015%2F10%2Fse_gladstone_street_fire_1.html&image=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F10%2F09%2F18933312-standard.jpg&pricingsheetid=&caption=%3Cp%3EPortland%20firefighters%20battle%20an%20apartment%20fire%20in%20the%203900%20block%20of%20Southeast%20Gladstone%20Street%20on%20Friday%20morning.%3C%2Fp%3E&affphotographername=Andrew%20Theen%20%7C", "http://oregonlive.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Return%20to%20the%20photo%20gallery&backurl=http%3A%2F%2Fphotos.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2F2015%2F10%2Fse_gladstone_street_fire.html&image=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F10%2F09%2F18933311-standard.jpg&pricingsheetid=&caption=%3Cp%3EPortland%20firefighters%20battle%20an%20apartment%20fire%20in%20the%203900%20block%20of%20Southeast%20Gladstone%20Street%20on%20Friday%20morning.%3C%2Fp%3E&affphotographername=Andrew%20Theen%20%7C%2", "http://www.nps.gov/valr/index.htm", "http://knudtsonmfginc.com/", "http://oregonlive.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Return%20to%20the%20photo%20gallery&backurl=http%3A%2F%2Fphotos.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2F2015%2F10%2Fse_gladstone_street_fire_2.html&image=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia.oregonlive.com%2Foregonian%2Fphoto%2F2015%2F10%2F09%2F18933314-standard.jpg&pricingsheetid=&caption=%3Cp%3ETom%20Holiday%2C%2034%2C%20watches%20crews%20work%20on%20his%20neighbors%27%20apartment.%20Holiday%20and%20his%20wife%20were%20not%20injured%2C%20but%20their%20apartment%20may%20have%20been%20dama", "http://www.navsource.org/archives/09/03/0336.htm"], "published": "2015-10-10T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:28:19.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
