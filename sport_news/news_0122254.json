In an event hosted by former Jesuit graduate and former LSU baseball star Mason Katz , Marx will show off his most recent book from 6-9 p.m. at Walk-On's Bistreaux & Bar at 1009 Poydras Street.\nPart of the focus of Marx's book tour is to promote the 'Books-to-schools program,' with Walk-On's and Business First Bank as the corporate sponsors. The program is in place to donate thousands of books to schools and youth groups throughout Louisiana.\n\"What's really important to me is to use the platform of sports to reach young people with messages that matter,\" Marx said. \"When messages are part of a sports story, they tend to reach young people with a little more impact.\"\nDan Borne reads an excerpt from 'Walking with Tigers.' A press release describes the book as \"an unconventional collection of LSU sports stories. These stories are not about games. They are about people and their lives. They are about the powerful reach of LSU sports and the passion that comes with a long history of excellence. You will find new material about Tiger greats Alex Bregman, Dale Brown, Kimberlyn Duncan, Leonard Fournette, Bert Jones, Mikie Mahtook, Raph Rhymes, Stanley Roberts, Jimmy Taylor and many others. You will also find entertaining stories about the Bengal Belles, a lucky can of corn, and an LSU sports bar in New York City.\"\nAnd a compelling chapter about Fournette, the Tigers' running back who has captivated the country with a record-setting four-game explosion to start his sophomore season.\nIn four games, Fournette has plowed through opposing defenses for 864 rushing yards and 11 touchdowns and in the process became the first SEC back to top 200 yards in three straight games.\nMarx met Fournette during his senior year at St. Augustine and followed his journey from ballyhooed prep legend to popular freshman to now.\nHere is an excerpt from the chapter\nBUGA Nation | August 10, 2014\nThe youthful but already widely celebrated head of state -- Leonard Fournette of BUGA Nation -- settles on a folding chair at the twenty-two-yard line of LSU's indoor practice field. More than thirty writers and broadcasters scramble to form a crowded ring around him. They all want a piece of the top-ranked freshman football player in America – need a piece of him for their stories. They have an endless supply of questions for the rookie running back.\nWas the first week of practice what you thought it would be ?\nHow tough is it to learn the playbook ?\nWhat's the reception been like around campus ?\nLeonard Fournette has been in the spotlight from the time he was in the 8th grade. Brett Duke, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune This is how it works at LSU's annual preseason media day. Journalists come with questions. Seated football players offer answers. But the frenzy surrounding Fournette -- literally surrounding him at the moment -- is unlike anything else going on here. The young man has yet to play a down of college football. He is nonetheless the top interview target of the day. Fournette has been hyped to the heavens -- the words 'Heisman Trophy' even creeping into the conversation -- and this is the first time since his arrival on campus that reporters have been allowed to speak with him.\nDo you have personal goals for the season ?\nHow do you handle all the attention ?\nLes Miles has mentioned Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods in the same sentence as you – what does that mean to you ?\nFournette's bald head shines under the glare of television lights. His mouth opens into a big smile and his braces glisten. Making twin tracks across his top and bottom teeth, they are seemingly at odds with his dark beard -- the braces a sign of youth, the thick facial hair a hint of manhood.\nYour first taste of contact the other day ... what was that like for you ?\nThe adjustment you're making to the college game ... is it a physical thing ? Or is it more mental ?\nAre you the fastest player on the team ?\nThe nineteen-year-old Fournette -- six-foot-one, 224 pounds of chiseled hope and expectation -- is wearing a white game jersey made perfect for him by the purple number sevens displayed on front and back. He chose his uniform number to represent the Seventh Ward of New Orleans. It was there that he grew up – known as 'Button' before anything else because his parents adored his button nose. It was there -- in a tough area plagued by poverty and crime -- that family and faith combined with football to make him who he is.\nHow anxious are you to play in that first game against Wisconsin ?\nYou think you'll be nervous ?\nWorking with the older guys at your position -- Terrence Magee and Kenny Hilliard -- how has that been going for you ?\nFournette answers with comfort and ease. He comes across as both confident and humble. Yes, he put up crazy numbers-- rushing for 7,619 yards and eighty-eight touchdowns -- during four years on the high school varsity at St. Augustine in New Orleans. Yes, Sports Illustrated recently declared him 'the most highly touted LSU signee of all time' and he is often compared to NFL star Adrian Peterson of the Minnesota Vikings -- so rare is his combination of size, speed, power, and moves. But there is so much more than that to Fournette. He already knows too much about death. He knows about struggling ... about overcoming the odds of his environment. He knows about doing right things when others around him might not be doing the same. He has a mother who constantly texts him with Scripture. He has a powerful thought -- \"I express my pain through football\" -- that never really leaves him. He has his self-imposed standards of the nation he and his family created.\nFor more information on the book, go to www.jeffreymarx.org .
