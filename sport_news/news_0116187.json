Josey Hajek missed 11 matches with a concussion, returned, then sprained an ankle. \nGustin expects both of them back Monday, but the Spartans will be without Grace McCarty, who suffered a torn ACL. \n“There have been a lot of matches in which we had zero varsity experience (from last year) on the floor,” Gustin said. “But with (Keith) and Josey back, they do have confidence that we can play with West Liberty. They don’t want to be sitting at home when the state tournament is going on.” \nSolon has qualified for four straight state tournaments. West Liberty (32-4) is seeking its third trip in five years. \n“(Comets setter) Cassedi Simon is so good in isolating one-on-one blocks for their hitters,” Gustin said. “She creates tough matchups. They’re a quick team, and she’s an offensive setter.” \nEven with the Spartans down this season, the area has been strong in 3A. \nNo. 5 Mount Vernon (23-12) — last year’s runner-up — opens at home against Monticello (13-13). No. 6 Center Point-Urbana (28-7) hosts Williamsburg (10-20). \nIn 4A and 5A, three Metro/Iowa City teams will be in action (the others earned first-round byes). Cedar Rapids Xavier (13-21) hosts Vinton-Shellsburg (13-21) in 4A; Cedar Rapids Washington (3-30) is at Waterloo West (13-23) and Iowa City High (15-14) hosts Davenport West (7-20) in 5A. \nSemifinals are Thursday in the larger three classes. \nMONDAY’S CLASS 5A REGIONAL QUARTERFINALS \n(All matches, 7 p.m.) \nDes Moines North (1-13) at Des Moines Lincoln (19-25) \nRegion 6 \nCedar Rapids Washington (3-30) at Waterloo West (13-23) \nRegion 7 \nDavenport West (7-20) at Iowa City High (15-14) \nMONDAY’S CLASS 4A REGIONAL QUARTERFINALS \n(All matches, 7 p.m.) \nVinton-Shellsburg (13-21) at Cedar Rapids Xavier (13-21) \nWaterloo East (11-21) at Decorah (9-23) \nRegion 7 \nNorth Scott (3-24) at DeWitt Central (9-15) \nMaquoketa (10-19) at Western Dubuque (20-11) \nRegion 8 \nWashington (6-21) at Clear Creek Amana (23-16) \nKeokuk (4-23) at Mount Pleasant (11-20) \nMONDAY’S CLASS 3A REGIONAL QUARTERFINALS \n(All matches, 7 p.m.) \nAplington-Parkersburg (12-16) at Iowa Falls-Alden (22-13) \nHampton-Dumont (9-21) at Waterloo Columbus (17-14) \nCrestwood (5-16) at Osage (23-7) \nWaukon (6-26) at New Hampton (26-8) \nRegion 6 \nWilliamsburg (10-20) at Center Point-Urbana (28-7) \nOelwein (12-21) at North Fayette Valley (13-15) \nSouth Tama (3-22) at Union (23-13) \nBenton Community (11-24) at East Marshall (8-18) \nRegion 7 \nMonticello (13-13) at Mount Vernon (23-12) \nDyersville Beckman (16-18) at Cascade (18-14) \nCamanche (14-19) at Davenport Assumption (21-12) \nAnamosa (2-23) at Northeast (9-18) \nRegion 8 \nSolon (10-23) at West Liberty (32-4) \nMid-Prairie (15-15) at Mediapolis (26-10) \nAlbia (9-14) at Centerville (26-6) \nCentral Lee (7-22) at Davis County (21-20) \nl Comments: (319) 368-8857; jeff.linder@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T22:28:07.978+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
