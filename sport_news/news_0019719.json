Cubs defeat Cardinals for trip to NLCS John Anderson, WKYC 9:42 a.m. EDT October 14, 2015 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nFor My Take, a simple question. Should we all become Cubs fans right now? Would the Cubs winning the World Series be the best thing for Major League Baseball? \nFunny thing is Hollywood may have seen this coming back in 1989 with the movie \"Back to the Future.\" One of the scenes shows the Cubs winning the 2015 World Series. \nCubs fans took to the streets last night after the Cubs beat the Cardinals in the NLDS. Can you imagine what the streets of Chicago would look like if the Cubs win the World Series? It would be their first title in 107 years. If that happens, Major League Baseball should throw a big party too. Imagine the interest level and the TV ratings for a Cubs World Series. We would all tune in to watch. It could be history and we would all want to witness history. \nBaseball ratings are up, but still not even close to football. The NFL national ratings are more than triple over the baseball playoffs. Nineteen million watched the Giants rally to beat the Niners. For the ratings, NFL on NBC Sunday night got a 13 rating. Baseball playoffs are averaging under a 4. \nBaseball needs a great story. Baseball needs the Cubs in the World Series. The only bad thing is if the Cubs win it and end their streak of championship-less seasons, the Indians would then be on the clock for the longest drought at 67 years and counting. \nTweet me your thoughts @johnWKYC.
