They finished 74-88, including a 35-46 road mark.\n\"Disappointing is a good word,\" second baseman Jedd Gyorko said. \"It takes years for teams to really jell and work together, but it's something we're going to keep working on moving forward. We have the right pieces and enough good guys in here to win, and we're capable of doing it.\"\nThey just won't be moving forward with Murphy.\nHe took over in mid-June after Bud Black was fired. San Diego was 42-53 under Murphy and finished fourth in the division — 23 games behind the Dodgers. Murphy had been guiding the Padres' Triple-A team in El Paso when he was promoted.\n\"All in all, I think for me personally it was a great experience,\" he said before his fate was announced. \"So I'm very grateful and I'm looking forward to the future.\"\nThe Padres were also in fourth place when Murphy took over.\n\"It was a tough situation for anyone to be thrown into,\" Gyorko said. \"It would be hard for anyone to come in like that. I don't know if anyone would have been better.\"\nSan Diego has not finished with a winning record since 2010 and has not reached the postseason since 2006.\n\"We had some goals that we set at the All-Star break and I think we lived up to them,\" center fielder Melvin Upton Jr. said. \"We just want to take all the positives out of this year and carry them over into next season.\"\nThe Padres were 5-14 against the Dodgers this season, and got swept in the final series for the first time since Aug. 30-Sept. 1, 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:43:31.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
