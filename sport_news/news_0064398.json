At 8:06 a.m., the heavy rain was expected to pass through the Butte Fire location, creating potential for flooding, debris flows and mud slides around the steep terrain. The warning remained in effect until 10:30 a.m. National Weather Service recommended moving to higher elevations and away from the burned areas.â€™ Travis Wilson, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, said that more showers are expected, but the bulk of the rain has already fallen. Calaveras County saw more rainfall than Tuolumne County. Placerville experienced 1.85 inches of rainfall and areas by Big Trees got about 1.75 inches. In Tuolumne County, Pinecrest saw 0.86 inches of rainfall while Columbia got 0.26. California Highway Patrol reported minor flooding in Calaveras County at Mountain Ranch east of Highway 49 and Highway 26 at Jesus Maria and a mudslide. CHP says Caltrans has responded and cleared the road at these locations. CHP says Amador County suffered multiple floods as well. The most notable took place at Electra Road at Highway 49. The road has since been closed. Pick-up catches fire CHP also responded to a pickup on fire Saturday morning on Highway 108 near Rushing Hill Lookout, south of Sonora. The incident occurred at 7:15 a.m. and was cleared at 8:40 a.m. CHP says nobody was hurt -- the parties got out of the car -- and the road was not closed. CHP also said the fire stayed within the vehicle and did not spread to any nearby vegetation.
