Like, for example, that carried interest is nothing but income and should be taxed.” He jumps into a Trump impression: “‘ And don’t you worry, I’ll take care of these hedge-fund guys !’ And then you get Jeb Bush saying the same thing, which is remarkable.”\nDukakis is referring here to the carried-interest loophole, a tax quirk that allows money managers to pay lower taxes on some income. Trump’s criticism of the loophole on the campaign trail has spurred a bipartisan push to end that benefit, including from Jeb Bush .\nYet despite his praise for Trump, Dukakis is firmly in Hillary Clinton’s corner for 2016.\nSo now to the key question: How was Dukakis’s Trump impression?\n@ejleven needs work, tbh.\n— Marin Cogan (@marincogan) October 19, 2015 Gallery: Scenes from Donald Trump’s rally at Ernie Boch Jr.’s home.\nPrevious -- of -- Next Guests arrived for a campaign rally Friday for Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump at the Norwood mansion of car dealer Ernie Boch Jr. Brian Snyder/ Reuters Previous -- of -- Next A worker carries a Trump painting to the side of the house.
