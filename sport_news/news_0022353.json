He said forensic experts have been rushed to the spot for collecting the samples to ascertain the nature of the explosive substance. Chief Minister Mufti Mohammad Sayeed was scheduled to attend a function in Shopian today but it was cancelled due to a strike call given by traders’ bodies. “The Chief Minister’s function in Shopian was cancelled last evening. It had nothing to do with today’s incident,” an official in the chief minister’s office said. He said Sayeed was scheduled to leave for Shopian “very early in the morning”, several hours before the incident took place. The official said Sayeed’s visit was called off following a strike call given by trader bodies. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:08:50.494+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
