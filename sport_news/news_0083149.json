On Wednesday, Rose was kind enough to sit down with SI.com and answer questions about his many walks of life.\n• DEITSCH: Rose on NBA Countdown | VAULT: Rose becomes a Pacers star\nSI.com: In your book, you discuss how growing up in Detroit and events like your father’s funeral impacted your life. How did the birth of your daughters and becoming a dad impact you?\nJalen Rose: There are different phases of your life, it’s the phase when you’re 16 and you get your license and you get a little more freedom from your parents. Then the phase when you’re 18, and you’re probably in college and it’s the first time you don’t have a curfew, and then it’s the phase where you have to be an adult and be a professional. And the ultimate phase happens mid-to-late 20s to 30s, when all of the bills start to be in your name, that’s when your life changes. And also if and when you start to have a family, or have kids. I started having kids, it changes your perspective. It gives you a sense of responsibility you didn’t even know you could have, that you’re living for someone else. You’re responsible for not only helping create this young person, but shaping and molding. It can be nerve-racking, it’s the toughest job. That’s why I love my mom and grandmother so much, because they did an amazing job. And that’s why I dedicated the book to them.\nSI.com: You started your own charter school in Detroit. Why was education specifically important to you as a way to give back?\nRose: For me, it’s how can I give back and influence in a way that is going to be long standing. Through education, to me there was no doubt that was the remedy. Through my foundation, I was already influencing via scholarship five public school kids for nine years. I also have a scholarship endowment at University of Michigan that’s graduated two students. Starting JRLA ( Jalen Rose Leadership Academy ) was just really a graduation of that mission. Living in a city like Detroit, when we were prosperous we had a population of 1.8 million people. Now we have 700,000. We’re trying to do what we can to come back to that thriving city. And I felt like my influence, because at the time we were opening jails but closing schools, it just gave me the courage to say I can do more to make a difference. The school is not just about educating those young kids. It’s also about life skills, social skills, etiquette, decision making, problem solving. Those life skills they’re going need if they’re going to be successful.\n• MORE NBA LeBron funds 1,100 scholarships | Wall’s off-the-court crossover\nSI.com: Your book discusses how you had confidence at a young age you would make it to the NBA. Did you ever have a moment where your confidence was shaken?\nRose: I say this with all humility: I always had irrational confidence. I always felt like I was. I tell a story in the book when I thought I was Steve Austin, The Six Million Dollar Man. Been watching a lot of wrestling, outside in the winter, in Detroit, still water in the pool, with my older cousin who’s now a principal, I decide my confidence is going to help me jump across the pool. I go bounce off the fence to get a running start, and I think I’m going to jump across the pool. [Jalen landed in the middle and quickly began sinking.] Luckily for me, she didn’t jump in too or we’d both be dead.\nPhoto: Jodi Buren for Sports Illustrated ​ SI.com: You played in an infamous game during college when the opposing fans were chanting “crackhouse” after an incident at a friend’s house was publicized. How would you describe your emotions during that moment?\nRose: That’s when you have to have a bunker, foxhole type mentality. That really tests your character and your toughness. People see celebrities or public figures or those that are successful in whatever genre of life, but they underestimate we all have to overcome turbulence, we all have to respond to bad decisions. For me, my career high game at Michigan was the only game I didn’t start. I started 104 games, the only game I didn’t start, that’s the game I had my career high. I always felt like I was somebody if I really needed to dig deep down to respond, I was always able to. That’s a trait I’m really fortunate to have.\nSI.com: What’s the most money you’ve seen someone spend during one night of partying?\nNBA Video Golden Hours: Inside the Warriors' nightlong NBA Finals celebration by Lee Jenkins", "external_links": ["http://gbmwolverine.com/2015/09/01/jalen-rose-to-release-book-detailing-fab-five/", "http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0804138907", "http://www.jrladetroit.com/"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:33:08.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
