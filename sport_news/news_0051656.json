The final score is one: ISU maintained its stranglehold atop the Big Sky Conference with a 3-2 victory and exhibited why it’s the team to beat by coming from behind 2-1. The Bengals put on a show at the net in front of 971 fans with four players — Makenzie Filer, Tressa Lyman, Marissa Todd, and Chloe Hirst — recording double-digit kills. The proactive and politically correct way to look at the match: The Bears proved they’re not going to go away quietly in defense of their conference title, taking the top team to five sets before losing 15-11 in the difference maker. UNC coach Lyndsey Oates took the proactive approach with her squad. “I was positive with them after the match,” Oates said. “It was a growing match (for us). We don’t mind losing this match in October if it means winning it in November at the (postseason) tournament when it matters.” The biggest difference on Thursday was the attack percentages in the fifth set when the Bengals had just two attack errors en route to hitting 60 percent. By comparison, the Bears had four attack errors while hitting just 50 percent. The Bengals (5-0 in BSC action, 13-6 overall) jumped out to an 8-3 lead in the fifth set as Lyman (22 kills) slammed a pair of kills, but the Bears fought back to 8-7 as Katie Champion (11 kills, 5 digs) found her rhythm. It was as close as the Bears (2-3, 6-12) would get. ISU took advantage of several UNC unforced errors and then went to their ace — Filer (15 kills), to finish the match. “You’re more urgent in a fifth set with it being just to 15,” UNC senior Kendra Cunningham (18 kills, 13 digs, 3 block assists). “A three-point lead in a 15-point set is big.” Oates judges a set after the first five points, and figured the Bears would need to execute better to win. “We didn’t excute well in the fifth set,” Oates said. “It came down to execution.” SERVING IT UP The Bears were the victims of seven serving errors and even more badly placed serves that set up ISU’s attack. “When we serve tough, we find out rhythm defensively,” Oates said. “When we served lollipop serves, they came back at us and got first-ball kills. Hopefully we learned our lesson there.” The Bears had just tree ace serves, half of what the Bengals dished up, which led to their progressive attack percentage that reached 66 percent in the fifth set to just 50 percent for the Bears. HAD THEM ON THE ROPES The Bears made a statement after losing the first set 25-19, being outscored 7-1 down the stretch. UNC started fast in the second set, but trailed 18-13 before Cunningham controlled the net and senior Katie Champion followed a block up with a kill to give the Bears the 26-24 victory. Champion said she’s gaining confidence while becoming a threat from both ends of the net for the Bears. “She’s playing like a senior,” Oates said of Cunningham. “She doesn’t have the experience of a senior because of all of her injuries, but she’s playing with confidence and we can move her from the right side to the left side.” The Bears won the third set 25-20 and looked to have all the momentum they’d need to knock ISU off. “You can’t get too confident or cocky though,” Cunningham said. “We had their game plan figured out but they came back just like we would have.” The Bengals answered with a 25-20 fourth-set victory as the Bears’ offense went stale and had little defense for the Bengals’ front-row attack. “That’s why they’re at the top (of the conference),” Oates said. “They’re very well rounded and have every position scoring.” WHAT IT MEANS Despite two losses to open confernce play two weeks ago, the Bears have established themselves as a strong contender, looking forward to next month when they hope to peak. “We’re behind developmentally because of our injuries, but that’s not a problem,” said Oates, whose squad will play host to Weber State at 2 p.m. Saturday at BOC Arena. “We can catch up in the next six to eight weeks and when we see them in the tournament we’ll be a different team. Whoever makes the most growth from this match wins the next one at tournament time.” ISU 25 24 20 25 15 UNC 19 26 25 20 11 ISU — Kills: Tressa Lyman 22, Marissa Todd 15, Makenzie Filer 15, Chloe Hirst 10.
