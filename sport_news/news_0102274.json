Thomas spotted Benning 20 yards from goal and sent over a long inviting cross which the left back lashed into the net on the volley.Home goalkeeper Brian Jensen then had to twice deny Zak Ansah as the Exiles pushed forward, but Yussuf had the final say when he turned well 18 yards from goal from Mitch Rose's pass to drill home a low finish inside the right post.
