Starting at 6 a.m. on Friday, October 23, the teams will run 36 legs from Lake Benson Park near Raleigh, all the way to Atlantic Beach.\nAnd once they reach the beach, they are treated to some tuna and a beverage of their choice to celebrate.\nShannon Tippette, Associate Publisher for Seniors Guide in the Triangle Area of North Carolina has volunteered with Alzheimer’s NC Inc. for the past 14 years, mostly on their memory walk committee. But this year, Tippette decided to start her own team for the Tuna 200.\n“I ran the Tuna 200 last year with the Eye of the Tiger team and decided to start my own team this year, Go Big or Go Home .” says Tippette. “Our team is composed of half senior industry professionals who work with clients who have Alzheimer’s Disease and friends, family or significant others of these team members. It is a fun team who is passionate about our cause!”\nGiven the connection to Seniors Guide , a publication specializing in independent living, assisted living and all other retirement options, it’s no surprise that Tippette’s team is raising money for an Alzheimer’s charity.\n“Go Big or Go Home is running to raise money for Alzheimer’s NC Inc.,” Tippette says. “AlzNC serves 51 eastern North Carolina counties by providing education, support and services to individuals with dementia, their families, health care professionals and the general public while raising awareness and funding for research of causes, treatment, prevention and cure for Alzheimer's disease and related dementias.”\nTo donate to the Go Big or Go Home team, go to https://www.crowdrise.com/gobigorgohomeforalznc/fundraiser/shannontippette , and for more information about the Tuna 200, visit http://tunarun200.com/ .\nSeniors Guide, a Richmond, Va. -based company publishes Seniors Guide magazines throughout Cincinnati, Ohio; Columbus, Ohio; Dayton, Ohio; Indianapolis, Indiana; Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; and Roanoke-Lynchburg, Virginia and features a correlating website of SeniorsGuideOnline.com.
