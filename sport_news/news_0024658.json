(AP) â€” Baker Mayfield threw for five touchdowns and No. 19 Oklahoma bounced back from its Red River upset to beat Kansas State 55-0 on Saturday, the first time the Wildcats have been shut out since 1996.\nKansas State had delivered serious scares to Top 25 opponents each of the last two weeks but the Wildcats (3-3, 0-3 Big 12) were helpless against the Sooners (5-1, 2-1). Oklahoma set the tone early, taking only 1:04 to score on its opening drive on a 22-yard pass from Mayfield to Sterling Shepard.\nThe Sooners took a 35-0 lead into halftime and just kept rolling in the second half.\nGoing into Saturday's game, Kansas State had scored in 234 straight games. The loss to Oklahoma marked the first time the Wildcats have been shut out at home since 1991.\nOklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield (6) scrambles with the ball during the first half of an NCAA college football game against Kansas State in Manhattan, Kan., Saturday, Oct. 17, 2015.
