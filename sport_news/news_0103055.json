They can’t, can they? \nSurely that wish must have crossed their minds, considering the drama and high TV ratings this National League Division Series has generated. \nThe matchup of teams from the country’s two largest markets was bound to draw plenty of attention despite the relative lack of playoff history between the clubs, but then Jacob deGrom reenacted his astounding All-Star Game appearance – only over seven innings – Chase Utley broke Ruben Tejada’s leg, Yoenis Cespedes sent a 111-mph laser into the second deck at Citi Field and Clayton Kershaw found vindication. \nWithout need of any extraneous hype, this clash has become the postseason’s most compelling theater. Las Vegas jumps on bandwagon, lists Cubs as favorite to win World Series \n“It’s turned into a really good series, obviously,’’ Dodgers manager Don Mattingly understated. \nAnd for the capper, Thursday's decisive Game 5 – still sure we can’t stretch it to seven? – matches up two of the game’s top right-handers in deGrom and Dodgers co-ace Zack Greinke, the Game 2 winner and a strong candidate to earn his second Cy Young Award. \nAnd that only begins to tell the story of this elimination game. \nThe Dodgers, winners of three consecutive NL West crowns for the first time ever, are looking at the possibility of getting bounced out in the first round for the second year in a row, leaving them still searching for their first World Series title since 1988. \nWith a record payroll in excess of $300 million, the Dodgers have made it clear nothing short of a championship will satisfy them. \nMattingly has gone 446-363 in his five seasons in L.A., accumulating the sixth-most wins in franchise history, but there’s a strong belief among team observers that he may not be brought back if Los Angeles falls short of the World Series. \nAnother key piece who may not return is Greinke, whose 1.66 ERA this season was the lowest in the majors since Greg Maddux’s 1.63 in 1995. MLB postseason schedule, matchups, TV times \nGreinke speaks highly of his time in Los Angeles – “I really can’t think of anything not positive to say about the whole experience,’’ he said – but he’s widely expected to opt out of his six-year, $147 million contract because, well, pitchers who hit the market after going 19-3 with a 1.66 ERA can pretty much name their price. \nThe Dodgers have enjoyed the rare luxury of sending two legitimate aces to the mound on back-to-back games for the last four years, rekindling memories of the 1960s, when they boasted the Hall of Fame duo of Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale. \n“With Clayton and Zack, they’ve given us two guys that stop streaks, save your bullpen, are just day-in, day-out consistent guys,’’ Mattingly said. “You can really count on what you’re going to get from them 90-something percent of the time.’’ \nA victory this evening would extend their time together and perhaps add one more reason for Greinke to stay, especially if the Dodgers go on to win the World Series. \nThe Mets will face a huge free-agent decision of their own as soon as their postseason is over. Clayton Kershaw, Dodgers tie NLDS, force Game 5 vs. Mets \nCespedes, probably more responsible for their first trip back to the playoffs in nine years than anybody else wearing blue and orange, is about to test to market as well, and with lots of leverage for demanding a nine-figure contract. \nThe powerful Cuban outfielder is building a case as one of the game’s most impactful players. The Oakland Athletics plummeted after trading Cespedes on July 31 of last year – although other factors also played into their collapse – and the moribund Mets offense came to life after the club acquired him exactly a year later. Again, other elements were involved – including David Wright’s return, Michael Conforto’s emergence and the addition of infielders Kelly Johnson and Juan Uribe – but Cespedes made a huge difference, with 17 homers, 44 RBI and a .942 in 57 games as a Met. He’s batting .313 with two homers in this series. \n“Putting Cespy in the middle of the lineup gets everybody in a different spot and lets them settle in,’’ Johnson said. \nCespedes, who turns 30 on Sunday, has said he wants at least a six-year contract, and the Mets have not shown much of an appetite for mega-deals in the last several years, so his New York stay could wind up being memorable but short. \nWith all the subplots involved, this prime-time affair has the makings of a special game. Before the series, both teams set their rotations so they had an elite starter rested and ready for Game 5. \nDeGrom, who overwhelmed the Dodgers with a five-hit, 13-strikeout performance in the series opener, has usually excelled following Mets loses and said he believes he raises his game in those situations. \n“You try to get your team back on a winning streak,’’ he said. “I think that will kind of be in my mind and I’ll go out there and just try to put up zeroes.’’ 46 CONNECT 50 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T12:43:18.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
