Yesterday we were disappointed because we worked all day and lost position on the last corner. I did a good sprint but from 30 positions back. Today we decided not to work as much, to save energy because we have a lot of climbers for tomorrow. If I was to have two leadout guys we needed to stay on wheels.\" \n\"When I saw 3km I needed to do a good effort to take Sagan’s wheel. When Sagan opened his sprint I say ‘ok, now I need to pass him, not wait’. I know I have good power at the end of this season. I am really really happy to take another win this season.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:51:37.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
