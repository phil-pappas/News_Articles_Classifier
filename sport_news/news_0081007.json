(AP) - Planned Parenthood is contesting the new approach Gov. Bobby Jindal's administration has taken to remove it from Louisiana's Medicaid program.\nThe organization amended its lawsuit in federal court Wednesday, seeking to keep the state health department from ending its Medicaid provider agreements.\nJindal, running for the GOP presidential nomination, had initially sought to oust Planned Parenthood's clinics in Baton Rouge and New Orleans without providing a reason, citing a state law that allows cancellation with 30-day notice.\nA federal judge questioned that reasoning.\nSo, the administration changed course and the health department cited Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast's $4.3 million settlement of false claims allegations in Texas as reason to end its Louisiana Medicaid contract.\nIn response, Planned Parenthood revised its complaint in federal court, saying Jindal's effort is still illegal.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
