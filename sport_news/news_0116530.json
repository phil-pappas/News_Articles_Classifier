But it’s not the only closure this weekend.\nIt will be the sixth of 30 weekend closures to prepare for the $3.6 billion Eastlink Light Rail, which will occupy the express lanes over Lake Washington.\n“This is the sort of thing we need to get done now to get ready for laying rails on the bridge,” said Bruce Gray with Sound Transit.\nThe eastbound lanes are being squeezed to one lane and diverted onto the express lanes from Friday at 11 p.m. to Monday at 5 a.m.\nIn addition, the Montlake Bridge will close Saturday at 5 a.m. and reopen Sunday at 5 p.m. for bridge deck repair.\nIn Bothell, drivers won't be able to connect on I-405 to SR 522 from 10 p.m. Friday until noon Sunday.\nThe Washington Department of Transportation says to plan ahead.\nSome major closures coming up this weekend.

They recommend that drivers come to the game from the south and use side streets -- anything but I-5.\nLooking ahead, the Alaskan Way Viaduct will be closed Halloween weekend for an inspection.\nFor more information, see the WSDOT blog.\nLIKE KIRO 7 Eyewitness News on Facebook", "external_links": ["https://t.co/h9pwPIaDe9", "http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "https://twitter.com/AlexisKIRO7/status/657147555361501184", "https://www.facebook.com/KIRO7Seattle", "http://wsdotblog.blogspot.com/2015/10/plan-now-for-busy-weekend-of-roadwork.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:48:12.919+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
