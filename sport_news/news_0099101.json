Keefe was \"distraught over a relationship with a girl,\" the suit states.\nThe hospital discharged him the next day -- Oct. 7, 2012 -- about 1:30 p.m., according to the suit. Less than 28 hours later, the college junior was dead from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to his chest in the parking lot of his fraternity, Pi Kappa Phi.\nThe lawsuit faults Corvallis' Good Samaritan hospital, alleging that doctors failed to have Keefe evaluated by a psychiatrist or mental health professional. The suit also alleges that doctors failed to collect a full mental health history from him to gain an understanding of his risk for suicide.\nA hospital spokesperson didn't return requests for comment for this story.\nThe suit states that Keefe is survived by his mother, Stephanie Schmitter, and his stepfather, Jeffrey Schmitter.\nIt seeks $1.5 million for his family's loss of society and companionship and $750,000 for future lost income that Keefe could have generated.\nKeefe's obituary says he was a junior who was studying fermentation science and had a passion for beer brewing.\nThe lawsuit was filed in Benton County Circuit Court by Portland attorney David K. Miller.\nRead the lawsuit here .\n-- Aimee Green\nagreen@oregonian.com\n503-294-5119\no_aimee", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/o_aimee"], "published": "2015-09-30T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:40:33.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
