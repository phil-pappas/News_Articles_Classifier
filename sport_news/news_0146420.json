In a hard fought game between rivals Myrtle Beach and Conway, the Conway Tigers won back the Victory bell 25-22 Friday night. JASON LEE jlee@thesunnews.com i Mullins (2-3) at Waccamaw (2-3) \nWhen: Monday, 7:30 p.m. \nThe game: There’s no doubt that the Warriors lost a bunch of talent from last year’s team. But that doesn’t mean Waccamaw can’t use this game against Mullins as a springboard into the rest of region play like it did a season ago. And don’t be surprised if the game plan is nearly identical. Last time, Kevin Gasque needed just 12 carries to reach 110 yards and a score while three teammates also rushed for touchdowns. \nLast year: Waccamaw 34-18 Carvers Bay (1-4) at Creek Bridge (0-5) \nWhen: 7:30 p.m., Monday \nThe game: If Carvers Bay is looking for a way to right the ship, this is the perfect opportunity to do so. The Bears are a perfect 9-0 all time against Warriors. On top of that, the average score in those games has been an eye-popping 42-2. Creek Bridge has been shut out in seven of the games, and it hasn’t scored a single point against Carvers Bay since 2008, five games back in the series. This season, the Warriors are struggling again. They’ve lost all five games by double digits and three of the five by at least 40 points. \nLast year: Carvers Bay 41, Creek Bridge 0 \nFavorite: Carvers Bay Green Sea Floyds (2-3) at Lake View (3-2) \nWhen: 7:30 p.m., Friday \nThe game: Green Sea Floyds probably isn’t feeling too great about this matchup after seeing Lake View shut down Aynor a week ago. The Blue Jackets, who also rely almost entirely on the run, were held to just 129 yards on the ground. Aspects like that are why the Gators are ranked in the top 10 in Class A. And considering they’ve already played two of the state’s best small class teams in Dillon and Lamar, there’s little likelihood they won’t be prepared for this one. \nLast year: Lake View 36, Green Sea-Floyds 26 \nFavorite: Lake View Editor’s note \nDue to the impending storm, all games other than Green Sea Floyds at Lake View were either moved up to Thursday or postponed to Monday. \nArea standings", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:03:15.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
