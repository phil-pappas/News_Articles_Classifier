It will be a bit slow as well but will turn later on in a day or two,\" Mathews said at the toss.\nWest Indies captain Jason Holder, leading the team for the first time in Tests, said he would hope to take advantage of having four pace bowlers in the side while bowling first.\n\"I would like to have batted first. But nevertheless it looks pretty good. We have four fast bowlers,\" Holder said.\n\"We came here to win the Test series. Both teams I believe are evenly matched. It just depends on who does better on a particular day.\"\nSri Lanka: Kaushal Silva, Dimuth Karunaratne, Lahiru Thirimanne, Dinesh Chandimal, Angelo Mathews (captain), Milinda Siriwardana, Kusal Perera, Dhammika Prasad, Tharindu Kaushal, Rangana Herath, Nuwan Pradeep\nWest Indies: Kraigg Brathwaite, Shai Hope, Darren Bravo, Marlon Samuels, Jermaine Blackwood, Denesh Ramdin, Jason Holder (captain), Devendra Bishoo, Jerome Taylor, Kemar Roach, Shannon Gabriel Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-14T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:54:54.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
