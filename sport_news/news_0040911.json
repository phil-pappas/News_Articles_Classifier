Watts-Jackson is out for the season. \nWatts-Jackson was in the right place to catch a floating football that Wolverines punter Blake O'Neill fumbled Saturday. He returned it 38 yards to lift the Spartans to a startling 27-23 victory. \nHe didn't have much chance to celebrate. The redshirt freshman appeared to land hard on his left hip after he was tackled into the end zone by Michigan tight end Jake Butt. \nJoyous teammates jumped on Watts-Jackson as he lay on a maize \"M\" in the end zone. He was carted off the field and hospitalized. \nMichigan's athletic director has released an open letter urging fans to avoid \"thoughtless comments\" after a punting mistake cost the Wolverines the game against Michigan State. \nJim Hackett does not mention O'Neill by name, but it is clear he is concerned about what the punter might face on social media. \nIn his letter Sunday, Hackett writes of the \"shocking reality\" that the Michigan community would send \"hurtful, spiteful and vicious comments\" to one of its students. He says such remarks from a \"small minority\" do not reflect the university. He adds that the \"program I know at Michigan\" is \"about the team, the team, the team.\" Advertisement AP Top 25: Stanford moved up five positions to No. 10 in The Associated Press Top 25 poll.
