His father Des was also a rugby referee. \n:: Joubert spent five years in corporate banking before becoming a full-time referee. \n:: He refereed on the world sevens circuit in 2003 and 2004 before being appointed to the Super Rugby list of officials. \n:: Joubert took charge of his first Test match in June 2005 when Wales beat the United States 77-3 in Connecticut. \n:: He took charge of the all-South African 2010 Super Rugby final between the Bulls and Stormers. \n:: In 2011, Joubert was handed the World Cup final between New Zealand and France in Auckland, but his performance attracted a great deal of criticism, especially from outside New Zealand, after the All Blacks won 8-7. \n:: Joubert was appointed to referee the first 2015 World Cup qualifying match between Mexico and Jamaica, which took place in Mexico City in 2012. \n:: Joubert was the man in charge of the 2013 second Test in Melbourne between Australia and the British and Irish Lions, which the Wallabies won 16-15. \n:: He refereed the 2014 Super Rugby final between the Crusaders and Waratahs, which went the Waratahs' way after Joubert awarded them an 80th-minute penalty.
