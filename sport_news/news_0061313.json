(Photo: David Olmos / Special to Kens5.com) CONNECT TWEET   son of former Clemens football coach Robert Lehnhoff, Steele football coach Scott Lehnhoff practically grew up at the stadium named after his father and mother, Glenda, a former secretary in the Schertz-Cibolo-Universal City ISD athletic department. \n\"It's a neat deal,\" Scott Lehnhoff said Tuesday. \"Every now and then, I'll pause in pregame and look up there (at the scoreboard) and see their name. I'm proud for them and their accomplishments, but that's completely separate from what I've done in my job. I really don't dwell on it.\" \nBefore he worked the sideline as a Clemens ballboy, Scott Lehnhoff watched the Buffaloes play from the stands. He even recalls \"losing\" a pacifier once or twice during a game when he was a toddler. Judson Rockets clinch 39th straight winning season \n\"For some reason, I remember Mom being really upset with me because I dropped my pacifier when I was about 2 years old,\" said Lehnhoff, 35. \"I dropped it on the concession-stand roof from up in the stands. I think we were playing Judson that night, actually, getting our butt kicked.\" \nWhile Judson is 6-0 against Clemens since 1980, Lehnhoff has yet to lose to the Rockets since he joined Mike Jinks' coaching staff at Steele in 2005 and became head coach in 2013. \nThe Knights are 5-0 against Judson since their first meeting in 2010, when Steele moved up to the UIL's largest classification. The Knights edged the Rockets 25-24 in a district game that year and went on to win the Class 5A Division II state championship. \nSteele (8-0) and Judson (7-0) square off in one of the area's most anticipated games this season at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Lehnhoff Stadium. Extra bleachers have been moved into the stadium and a crowd of more than 7,000 is expected to watch the rivals clash. \n\"As coaches, we haven't circled this date on our calendar or anything,\" Judson coach Sean McAuliffe said. \"It just happens to be the next game on our schedule. They happen to be undefeated and we happen to be undefeated. They've got a good team and I think we've got a pretty one over here.\" \nMcAuliffe is 0-3 against Steele since he went to Judson as Mark Smith's defensive coordinator in 2012. McAuliffe was promoted to head coach last year when Smith went to Madison. \nThe Knights scored a touchdown with 16 seconds left to beat the Rockets 23-22 last year. Steele won 34-20 in 2011, 42-35 in 2012 and 51-34 in 2013. \n\"As far as the fans and the communities involved, I think some of the excitement generated around the game is because you've got two pretty good football programs that are right down the street from each other,\" McAuliffe said. \"We both were able to do some good things last year and the records are what the records are this year. \n\"That generates a buzz, plus our kids grew up knowing each other. Sometimes they've gone to school with each other. There's some built-in excitement around it. Anytime you get to compete against people that you know and have done a great job, there's a tendency for the game to get hyped up quite a bit. It's always fun when you get to play people that you know.\" \nJudson and Steele both lost in the 6A state semifinals last year, but each was a play or two from playing in the title game of their respective divisions. \nNo matter what the coaches say, this is not your garden-variety district game. \n\"It would be coachspeak to say it's just another week,\" Lehnhoff said. \"The fact is our kids are excited about it. It's been a great game in the past and we expect another great game on Friday. Our kids know their kids. We're in very close proximity to them. \n\"They're undefeated, we're undefeated. We expect a great crowd. There's definitely a little bit more focus, there's a little bit more energy to practice. You can talk about each week is important as much as you want, but the fact is they know what this week is about.\" \nKENS 5 Class 6A Area Rankings \n1.
