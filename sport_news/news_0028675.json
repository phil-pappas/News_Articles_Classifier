Get a stop, and a shaky win over Army West Point would be secure.\n\"Guys were screaming their heads off, saying, 'We got this,'\" Cabinda said. \"I'm shouting calls, guys are echoing them. That's what so important, that urgency and will to get things done.\"\nCabinda's sack of Army quarterback A.J. Schurr with 1:21 remaining preserved the Lions' 20-14 victory at Beaver Stadium. To that point, such a stop was unclear. Army had scored on back-to-back third-quarter possessions and was driving late in the fourth.\nBut with time ticking on fourth down, Schurr was forced to pass, feeding one of Penn State's great strengths: the pass rush. Cabinda's blitz unraveled the pass play, giving Penn State an escape hatch to victory.\n\"It was on us at that point,\" Cabinda said. \"… Being able to get that stop on fourth down was just awesome.\"\nArmy coach Jeff Monken was less thrilled, primarily because Schurr took the sack. Schurr had brought Army back with two touchdown runs, one of 56 yards, but Monken wanted his quarterback to throw something in that situation. He saw two open receivers, including Edgar Poe, both for first downs.\n'We won today!' James Franklin reminds media, fans after Penn State edges Army Mark Wogenrich STATE COLLEGE — Penn State coach James Franklin said, through increasingly clenched teeth, that he has gambled once in his life.

Lost $20 in Atlantic City about 20 years ago and \"almost threw up.\" After that, Franklin said, he never gambled again.\nSo after his team's 20-14 win over Army West Point...\n(Mark Wogenrich) \"I'd love for [Schurr] to have given a guy a chance,\" Monken said. \"… Maybe [Poe] catches it and makes a play, maybe they interfere with us and we get a first down by penalty. But to eat it was pretty disappointing.\"\nCabinda, who replaced the injured Nyeem Wartman-White at middle linebacker, played his best game since making the switch. He had a team-high 14 tackles (also a career-high), two tackles for loss and a forced fumble.\nCabinda also managed a linebacker group that was without two opening-day starters: Wartman-White and Brandon Bell. Cabinda worked in rotations with Troy Reeder, Von Walker, freshmen Manny Bowen and Jake Cooper, and Ben Kline, who played for the first time in nearly two years.\n\"That's a tough offense,\" Cabinda said of Army. \"They make a lot of cut blocks, the guys play super hard, and they punch you in the mouth. Obviously, the mental aspect is tough, too. But I think we did a good job of being disciplined.\"\nMore injuries: Center Angelo Mangiro and punter Chris Gulla joined the list of injured Penn State players. Mangiro and Gulla both were hurt in the second half, Gulla trying to make a tackle.\nMangiro's absence forced Penn State to play without its top two offensive linemen: tackle Andrew Nelson has missed the past three games.\nNoteworthy: Defensive end Carl Nassib made an NCAA-best eighth sack of the season. … Bowen played a sharp game, making six tackles, three on special teams. He also recovered a fumble. … Redshirt freshman running back Nick Scott scored his first career touchdown. … Penn State improved to 4-0 at home for the first since 2008. … After recovering three fumbles, the Lions improved to plus-8 in turnover margin this season.", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ff90d/turbine/mc-penn-state-football-army-game-20151003"], "published": "2015-10-04T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:55:13.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
