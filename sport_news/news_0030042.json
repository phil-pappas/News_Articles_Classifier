Moser had one of the strongest arms and was one of the more polished quarterbacks at the camp. Moser also was one of the top two most accurate quarterbacks at the Harrisburg as well. Moser's leadership and confidence in his abilities, along with the way he carried himself, made him one of the best performers that day back in March.Season report: Moser has been outstanding through the first half of the regular season for Susquehanna Township. His team has played one of the harder schedules in the state and Moser has still produced great numbers on the field. Moser has completed 113 out of 172 passes for 1,576 yards (315.2 yards passing per game) and fifteen touchdowns. Moser has been set loose thus far in 2015 and it's paid dividends. His team has had to deal with a lot of injuries to key players on both sides of the ball but Moser and wide receivers Chris Ciotti and Alonzo Rivera have Susquehanna Township's passing game firing on all cylinders through the first five games.
