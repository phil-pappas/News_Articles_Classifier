The Friday night ACC spotlight in Blacksburg was crucial for both NC State and Virginia Tech. The Wolfpack needed to scrub away the scent of disappointment following their conference opening loss to Louisville. The Hokies, having lost of eight of their last 10 homes games against FBS opponents, had to show the program still had some Coastal mojo under head coach Frank Beamer. \nIt was Beamer's crew who put together a complete effort, leaving head coach Dave Doeren flabbergasted as to how NC State's hot start hasn't translated into consistent execution against ACC foes. Frank Beamer: \"Some games are just bigger than others, and this one was absolutely big. Big and critical.\" #Hokies — David Teel (@DavidTeelatDP) October 10, 2015 \nMuch like Saturday's loss to Louisville , the Wolfpack had a tedious series of defensive breakdowns against a team nobody would consider dynamic on offense. Virginia Tech was coming off a loss to Pittsburgh where they mustered nine yards on the ground and 100 yards of total offense, but racked up 200 rushing yards and 358 total yards against NC State. Quarterback Brendan Motley, who threw a total of two touchdowns in losses to East Carolina and Pitt, zipped three into the endzone against the Pack. \nAnd the penalties showed up again. NC State was flagged nine times for 81 yards, gifting Virginia Tech five of their 20 first downs. \n\"Nine penalties is going to kill you,\" Doeren said after the game. \"It was one of those games where everything was being called. It's just how it is sometimes.\" — Will Thompson (@thrillis4) October 10, 2015 \nNC State's offense isn't helping matters either. The focal point of the woes centers on quarterback Jacoby Brissett, who wasn't tasked with having to do much against their non-conference schedule. The Pack need more ouf of Brissett, who threw for 113 yards with a touchdown and interception, if they're going to turn the season around. \n2. NC State's season isn't a lost cause after Friday's loss to Virginia Tech, but it certainly shifts the perception of a season filled with potential into a giant pile of meh. \nI'll stick with the boxing metaphor to describe Louisville and Virginia Tech as being in the same weight class as the Wolfpack. These were winnable games and necessary victories for NC State to show something tangible after offseason talk of building and progress. Turns out the Pack have yet to develop a decent counter punch. \nMeanwhile, Doeren's 3-15 overall conference record lingers over everything. \n3. So, Kirk, about that tweet a few weeks back. Yeah.
