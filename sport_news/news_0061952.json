Three of those touches went for scores. \n“They had seven guys in the tackle box, and we had to throw a little bit and they were manned across the board so we had to throw to move the football,” said Hart head coach Mike Herrington. \nAnd that plan worked out just fine for the Indians (6-1 overall, 2-0 Foothill League), who found the end zone on four of their first five possessions to build a 27-7 halftime lead. \nMoore threw a pair of long touchdown passes, 63 yards to Brock Williams and 36 yards to Ethan Lazarek, to help build that lead. \nWest Ranch was playing without starting quarterback Jackson Clark, who was out with a concussion. The Wildcat’s lone score came on a 77-yard screen pass to Chad Clinkunbroomer from quarterback Wyatt Eget. \nIt was otherwise a second straight tough league game for the Wildcats (3-4, 0-2). \nJames added two scoring runs of 54 yards and 5 yards on his five rushes, all of which came before the half. He tallied 70 yards on the ground a week after exploding for 255 against Canyon. \nThe senior running back also added a 27-yard scoring grab for Hart’s final touchdown of the game midway through the third quarter. \nIt was an efficient night overall for Hart, which didn’t need to run very many plays to put points on the board. \nWilliams had two touchdowns and 98 yards on two catches for the night. His first score came on a play when Hart checked out of a run because the Wildcats were showing blitz. \n“They started blitzing a lot and we checked off on some of the blitz reads,” Williams said. “And we (scored) one of my touchdowns when we were beating their blitz.” \nMoore finished 11-of-17 passing with no interceptions in another strong outing to help keep Hart on track in league play.“You have five steps to go, not just two, so we can’t rest. We’ve got to stay focused and get back to work,” Herrington said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:38:31.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
