The Cubs and Cardinals both have their share of celebrity fans. And because the two teams are long time rivals and seem to be evenly matched in the upcoming best of five series, I asked some of these bold names (and one bitter White Sox fan) for their playoff predictions, via email. Here’s what they said:\nJenna Fischer, “The Office” actress\n“While you might be thinking it will be hard for the Cards to win without Carlos Martinez and a healthy (Yadier) Molina, I'm sticking with my hometown. I say, Cards in 3.”\nPete Wentz, Fall Out Boy bassist\n“I’m a true believer and I think the Cubs take this series. I don't wanna guess games -- superstitions and all. But how amazing will it be if (you know I mean when) it happens. To think that ‘Back to the Future II’ might have had the answers all along? Go Cubbies!”\nEllie Kemper, “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt” actress\n“Cardinals in five because they have home field advantage and the best fans in baseball.”\nJoan Cusack, “Shameless” actress\n“I had to ask my friend Debbie Jones, who got 9 out of 10 on the super fan quiz last week. According to Debbie, “I'm going with the Cubs in 5.” ... I gotta stick with my super fan sources.”\nRichard Dent, Super Bowl XX MVP\n“Chicago in three. They are peaking at the right time.”\nIke Barinholtz, “The Mindy Project” actor\n“I'm going Cubbies in five. In the battle of good vs evil, evil may win a lot but you always have to believe in the good. The Cardinals are evil.”\nStephen Colbert kicks billy goat out of 'Late Show' taping in nod to Cubs curse Luis Gomez Stephen Colbert is done living in fear of billy goats. The “Late Show” host – who graduated from Northwestern and performed at Second City – went off on billy goats Thursday while celebrating the Cubs’ wild-card game victory.\n“So many things I’ve been wanting to say about your kind for years, but...\nStephen Colbert is done living in fear of billy goats.

Why? Because we are the underdogs. Everybody thinks the Cubs are better than us right now. Never count the Redbirds out! (Joe) Maddon's gamesmanship of trying to make us the bad guys will backfire!”\nBonnie Hunt, “Life with Bonnie” actress\n“I would pick the Cubs in 5. Despite the fact that the Cardinals have the best record in baseball, the playoffs recently have seen the hot team advance, and as the Cubs have won 9 straight you have to believe in the Cubs. This is a young team with a belief in itself. Don't you know, this IS the year!”\nGary Sinise, “Forrest Gump” actor\n“Not going to make a prediction. But, I am jazzed and so excited about this amazing team, what they've done this year, and have a great feeling that we will see a tremendous finish to this season. ‘We Believe.’ Go Cubbies!”\nTwista, “Slow Jamz” rapper\n“I believe the Cubs will win in four games. They have a good, strong team. When you have nothing to lose and all to gain, your will to win is unstoppable.”\nZach Gilford, former “Friday Night Lights” actor\n“Given my life long commitment to being a White Sox fan, I pick the Cardinals in 3.”\nlgomez@tribpub.com\nTwitter @TribLuis\nFacebook @TribLuis\nInstagram @TribLuis\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Cubs St. Louis Cardinals Chicago White Sox", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617e4f9/turbine/ct-cubs-cardinals-celebrity-predictions-20151009", "https://www.facebook.com/TribLuis/", "https://twitter.com/TribLuis", "https://instagram.com/tribluis/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5617be8b/turbine/ct-stephen-colbert-cubs-billy-goat-curse-20151009"], "published": "2015-10-09T17:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:27:17.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
