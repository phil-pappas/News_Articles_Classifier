Babcock will get his name in the history books, but he gave the credit to assistant coaches Andrew Brewer and Jim Hiller.\n\"Someone's going to say I challenged â€” I didn't challenge nothing,\" Babcock said after the Leafs' 3-1 loss. \"Brew yelled in Jim Hiller's ear, and Jim Hiller said we're challenging. They were good enough to put it up on the screen, so I knew by the time the guy got over there.\"\nCoach's challenges are new to the NHL this season and can be made on goals involving goalie interference or offside plays.\nReferees Frederik L'Ecuyer and Dan O'Rourke looked at the replay by the penalty box at Air Canada Centre and determined Plekanec made incidental contact with Bernier and therefore it was not a goal.\n\"The play happened so quick and you couldn't see that stick that got me the throat,\" Bernier said.\nWhile scrappy winger Brendan Gallagher quipped that he was surprised he didn't interfere with the goaltender first, his Habs teammates were satisfied even though the coach's challenge cost them a goal.\n\"Smart play for them and obviously it worked out,\" said Montreal captain Max Pacioretty, who acknowledged he didn't know how the new system worked. \"It seemed like it was the right call from what I saw. Got to give them credit for the good decision.\"\nBecause he won the challenge, Babcock maintained his timeout. As part of the new rule, a coach must have his timeout left in order to challenge a goal.\nThe league takes over the expanded video review for the final minute of the third period and all of overtime.\nCoaches weren't allowed to try during the pre-season, but Michel Therrien of the Canadiens said his staff was prepared.\n\"This is something new for everyone, and we're going to learn through the course of the season,\" Therrien said after the morning skate. \"We're ready. We're anticipating and went through different situations with our staff because a lot of times behind the bench it's tough to make that call.\"\nThe other new rule is three-on-three play in overtime, replacing four-on-four in an effort to reduce shootouts. Alex Galchenyuk's game-winner in the third period prevented more history from taking place at Air Canada Centre on Wednesday night.\n___\nFollow @SWhyno on Twitter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:19:01.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
