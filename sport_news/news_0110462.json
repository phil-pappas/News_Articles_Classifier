The Hawks led GMG 43-0 after one quarter and won 72-0. By Troy Hyde Newton Daily News \nSULLY — Not giving a struggling Green Mountain-Garwin football team any confidence was part of the game plan for the Lynnville-Sully squad on Friday night. \nA 43-0 advantage after one quarter certainly kept the Wolverines in reverse, and the Hawks cruised to a 72-0 win in Class A District 7 action. \nSage Ehresman returned from an injury to rush for 79 yards and three touchdowns on six carries. Evan Squires gained 58 yards and scored twice on five carries. \nThe Hawks moved to above .500 for the second time this year. \nSage Zylstra had four tackles and three sacks to lead a Lynnville-Sully defense that held GMG to 63 total yards. Zylstra rushed for a touchdown in the fourth quarter. \nLynnville-Sully improved to 4-3 overall and 3-2 in district play. GMG is 1-6 on the season and 0-5 in league play. \n“We came out pretty vicious, and we scored on every other play it seemed like,” Ehresman said. “We were ready to go for this one. We had a great week of practice, we prepped really well for them and played like we know we can.” \nEhresman scored the Hawks’ first three touchdowns on runs of 20, 10 and 36 yards. \nTyler Van Zante connected with Kobe Fisk for a 27-yard touchdown after that to put the home team up 29-0. Fisk made it 36-0 following a 28-yard punt return touchdown. \nSquires scored on a 4-yard touchdown run to cap the scoring in the first quarter. Caden Dunsbergen took a punt to paydirt from 39 yards out. \nA third punt return was taken to the house in the second half as Tyson Vander Linden sprinted 57 yards for the final touchdown of the game. \nSquires scored on a 31-yard touchdown run in the third. Zylstra’s touchdown run in the fourth quarter covered five yards. \nVan Zante finished 4-of-6 for 62 yards and a touchdown. Elijah Collins was 2-of-6 for 29 yards. The Hawks rushed for 198 yards and six scores on 26 carries. \n“We knew we were a better team than we showed last week against BGM,” Lynnville-Sully Mike Parkinson said. “I think that might have woke us up a little bit. \n“They re-committed this week. They busted their butts and came out ready to play. We set the tone early, and I am glad our defense and special teams got it done.” \nThe Hawk defense forced two turnovers and had six sacks in the game. Fisk had an interception, and GMG fumbled away its first possession on the kickoff following Ehresman first touchdown of the game. Jesse Van Wyk had two sacks and Jackson Hardin had one. \n“The biggest thing about this game is to have fun,” Parkinson said. “There is a lot of things being said about football right now, but no one is talking about the fun the kids have and the bond they have with each other.” \nThe Hawks had a one-play scoring drive, three two-play scoring drives and returned three punts for touchdowns. Their longest scoring drives of the game were 59 and 57 yards. \nThe early advantage allowed the Hawks to have a little fun and make a few memories. \nThe Hawks were able to run two different plays where 10 of the 11 players on the field had a brother on the field with them. \nThe first play resulted in a long run by Squires that got called back because of a penalty. The second play came on a two-point conversion try. The ball was snapped over Ehresman’s head, but the senior tailback still had no trouble converting despite recovering the ball at the 20-yard line. \n“We set that up so we can play with our brothers because we don’t get to most of the time,” Ehresman said. “It was our opportunity to play with them and have some fun.” \nSage’s Ehresman’s younger brother Drake was on the field with him and Evan Squires’ brother Trevor also was included. The other brothers involved in the two plays were Caden and Carsen Dunsbergen, Jackson and Jayson Hardin, Caleb and Bryson Barnett and Isaac, Elijah and Abram Collins. \n“Isaac Collins came to me with the idea,” Parkinson said. ‘He thought it would be really cool to put all the brothers on the field at the same time. It is cool because it won’t ever happen again. \n“This wasn’t a game for us to goof around in, but here’s a chance to have some fun and get those guys on the field and make a memory.” \nThe other situation where Parkinson and the Hawks were able to make a memory happened after GMG was called for four unsportsmanlike penalties following a Lynnville-Sully touchdown. \nThe penalties, which resulted in GMG coach Mike Spurlin’s ejection, put the ball on GMG 8-yard line for the ensuing kickoff. \nThat’s when Parkinson inserted freshman Dane Fuchs, an offensive and defensive lineman, into the game for the kickoff. He took advantage of his one-time opportunity and booted the ball through the uprights. \n“He’ll walk away from this game and always remember that,” Parkinson said. \nLynnville-Sully held the Wolverines to negative four yards rushing on 31 attempts. Jacob Burt was 5-of-22 through the air for 67 yards. \nThe Hawks look for their fourth win in five games when they travel to North Mahaska (2-5, 1-4) on Friday. \nGMG 0-0-0-0—0 \nL-S — Sage Ehresman 20-yd run (Ehresman run) \nL-S — Sage Ehresman 10-yd run (Knapp kick) \nL-S — Sage Ehresman 36-yd run (Engle kick \nL-S — Fisk 27-yd pass from Van Zante (Knapp kick) \nL-S — Fisk 28-yd punt return (Engle kick) \nL-S — Evan Squires 4-yd run (Knapp kick) \nL-S — Caden Dunsbergen 39-yd punt return (Ehresman run) \nL-S — Evan Squires 30-yd run (Engle kick) \nL-S — Zylstra 3-yd run (Knapp kick) \nL-S — Vander Linden 57-yd punt return (Knapp kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T02:35:26.013+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
