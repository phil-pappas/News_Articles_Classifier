In contrast, the Ravens will be wearing just one color: black jerseys, black pants and black socks, though they'll have pink accents in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\nThe Browns have worn their new brown trousers three times (twice in preseason, once in the regular season), but paired them with brown socks until now.\nThe Ravens' alternate black jerseys, worn twice a year, are somewhat of a good luck charm for them. The Ravens are 13-5 in black .\nThe Browns have still not worn their new orange jerseys yet, though next week's home game against Denver would be a good opportunity to break them out. After all, Peyton Manning is used to throwing passes to players in orange jerseys. ðŸ˜‰\nTime to unveil the uniform combo for #CLEvsBAL...White | Brown | OrangeCheck out all the possible future combos HERE >> bit.ly/NewBrownsUnis\nPosted by Cleveland Browns on Thursday, October 8, 2015 All black everything. ðŸ˜ˆðŸ”¥ðŸ˜ˆðŸ”¥ pic.twitter.com/Rk7Ed3PG8W\nâ€” Baltimore Ravens (@Ravens) October 7, 2015\nBrowns Uniform Tracker 2015 Wk Opp. Jersey Pants Result P1 vs WAS White White L, 17-20 P2 vs BUF White Brown L, 10-11 P3 at TB Brown White W, 31-7 P4 at CHI White Brown L,0-24 1 at NYJ Brown Orange L, 10-31 2 vs TEN White White W, 28-14 3 vs OAK Brown Brown L, 20-27 4 at SD Brown White L, 27-30 5 at BAL White Brown ?", "external_links": ["http://www.baltimoreravens.com/news/article-1/Dates-Announced-For-Black-Jersey-Games/f410cf02-a75d-476b-9250-48f0eb5c1b40", "http://t.co/Rk7Ed3PG8W", "https://twitter.com/Ravens/status/651826752658911232", "https://www.facebook.com/clevelandbrowns/posts/10153729656839684:0", "https://www.facebook.com/clevelandbrowns"], "published": "2015-10-09T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:14:53.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
