Information shared in both publications applies at sites the author cites as well as in other area locations where anglers fish trout streams and where hunters work hunting dogs.\nTrout streams\nJ. Michael Kelly is best known as the former award-winning outdoor columnist at the Syracuse Post-Standard, but his involvements with trout streams from Rochester to Syracuse and across the Southern Tier span more than 55 trout-fishing seasons.\nOnce retired from weekly column writing, Kelly began focusing on book publishing and produced a collection of story/columns about the great outdoors in 2011 and then a totally fishing-focused text, “Fishing the Finger Lakes,” in 2013. A consummate interviewer and talented reporter/storyteller, his boundless production of detailed specifics and sound on-the-water advice come mainly from being on the various waters and actively fishing many of those locations for 50 years or more.\nHis latest book, “Trout Streams of Central New York,” a Burford Books production, provides trout-stream anglers an encyclopedic view of stream-fishing options from sites southeast of Rochester eastward to well past Syracuse and Utica to the Southern Tier waters bordering Pennsylvania.\nEach entry is an intimate view of that fishery, including a star rating, noteworthy information specific to that creek, stream or waterway and the best time to fish. The best-times entries often include effective fly patterns that would be most successful.\nWestern New York anglers might be drawn to the exceptional coverage given to Oatka Creek, Naples Creek, Springwater Creek and other popular streams in Genesee, Monroe and Livingston counties, as well as Catharine Creek.\nFor five-star status in the central New York area, Kelly cites Nine Mile Creek, Oriskany Creek and Chittenango Creek. Along the Southern Tier, the Cohocton River is the going-away five-star leader for its 40 miles of great brown and brook trout fishing.\nColor photos of 17 of the more effective fly patterns range from a diamond braid egg sack to a woolly bugger, a generous mix of tailless bugs and minnow-like streamer patterns.\nOn selected streams at given times of the year, Kelly offers anglers the possibility of catching a central New York “Slam,” which includes a brown, rainbow and brook trout all caught from the same stream on the same day. It’s possible.\nPart II, “Tactics for Taking … ” provides the reader a load of tips, tricks and approaches for Central New York that apply as well to trout streams in the Catskills, Adirondacks and Western New York. Live bait options, spinning tackle usage, seasonal fly-pattern selection, trout species variations and a thoughtful conclusion on manners and ethics makes this a must-get book for learning more about fishing lore.\nA release date is set for Oct. 23 in book stores, but the text can be ordered directly from the publisher online at burfordbooks.com .\nGun-dog training\nWherever hunters use dogs in their pursuits the main focus often moves from the harvest to the handling and outcomes of the dog’s behavior afield. The recent 3-F Club’s Youth Mentoring Pheasant Hunt was a good example; the kids watched for shots, the handlers and bystanders marveled at the dogs’ dexterity and successes.\nRobert Milner at Duckhill Kennels in Somerville, Tenn., has devoted a lifetime to training dogs for all types of field activities. Milner, a retriever-kennel operator since 1972, published his first book, “Retriever Training for the Duck Hunter,” in 1984, a “Back to Basics” book in 2000 and now has completed a comprehensive text on the pursuit, “Absolutely Positively Gundog Training.”\nFor Milner, the right hunting dog starts with the right fit of handler and puppy/hound. He suggests choosing a dog that easily responds to commands. He applies the B. F. Skinner psychology of “operant conditioning,” which, simply stated, means rewards rather than punishment applications and a low-key approach to giving commands.\nMilner admits that some rewards can be distracting, but the focus/goal remains intact more strongly than a military-command approach. He gives tips on how to distinguish innate behaviors and those that must be trained. As for punishments, he offers good times and ones to avoid that might imprint unwanted actions and reactions in the dog.\nLength of training sessions and the handler’s behavior are key factors in the training. More is not always better or best. One study showed training once a week had dogs learning fastest; training three sessions per day five days a week showed the slowest rate.\nHis leading suggestion when seeking a hunting dog is to avoid dogs/puppies trained for field-trial competition. Ideally, a well-trained dog shows steadiness in the blind before the shot and a penchant for finding a cripple rather than just bringing in birds that are down, close and out.\nMilner’s new book is available online at duckhillkennels.com .\nemail: odrswill@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T11:25:42.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
