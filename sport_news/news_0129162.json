During the previous two weeks, he was listed as a limited participant at practice. This week, Luck made more throws and twice was listed as a full participant. On Sunday, about three hours before kickoff, Luck was seen throwing with even more zip. \nBut the bigger question is whether he will be healthy enough to snap Indy's six-game losing streak against the Patriots in the first meeting since the \"Deflategate\" controversy erupted after New England won January's AFC championship game. \n___ \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
