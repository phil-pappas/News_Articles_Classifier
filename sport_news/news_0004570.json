Heather Abbott was at the finish line during the bombings. \nDoctors had to amputate part of her left leg because of her injuries. She now travels across the country speaking at events. On Wednesday, she's in Sioux Falls for the Disabilities Rights Conference. \n\"If I were standing with my metal leg, people would know, and they treat me differently. I can't say that I wouldn't have done the same thing myself before I became an amputee. I think people are just sometimes afraid to say the wrong thing,\" Abbott said. \nTonight on HealthBeat on KELOLAND News at 6 p.m. hear from a South Dakota official about the steps the state still needs to take to help those with disabilities.
