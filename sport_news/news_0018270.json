The coaches watched film to see how the Saints defend \"12 personnel\" - two tight ends and one running back - and they used it to try to get on the field against certain formations. \nMost defenses play their base defense against the two-tight end set, which brings a bigger body onto the field compared to a nickel formation, when a team has an extra cornerback. One reason the Eagles have not featured the two-tight end offense as much this year is they like playing three-receiver sets, with defenses responding by playing nickel to try to cover Jordan Matthews in the slot. The Eagles can then run against the nickel formation, when the defense has one less big body. \nOf course, the two-tight end offense allows the Eagles to have a bigger body on the field and better blocking. \n\"We can see right away how they match up to that and what we want to do,\" Celek said. \"If they go nickel, we can run the ball on them - we've got two guys who can block in there - and if they go into base and we want to pass it, we can pass it.\" \nThe Saints played both nickel and base defense against the Eagles' two-tight end sets. The Eagles have a balanced offense when both tight ends are on the field, with a near 50-50 pass-run distribution. \nCelek spent most of the game as a blocker - he blocked on 63.4 percent of his snaps, according to Pro Football Focus - but he also caught all three targets and a touchdown pass. A linebacker was on Celek each time, although he said he benefited from blown coverages. He didn't even know his numbers. Celek, a nine-year veteran, stopped caring about his statistical production after five or six years in the league. \n\"I don't look at stats anymore,\" he said. \"Doesn't do anything for me.\" \nErtz ran pass patterns on 63.6 percent of his snaps, and he blocked on the other downs. He finished with five catches for 60 yards, his best outing of the season. He has played 64 percent of the offensive snaps this year, which is a 14 percent increase from last season. But Sunday was the first time his playing time and Celek's playing time were steady together. \n\"I like to think I can get open regardless of who's on me,\" Ertz said, \"but we knew going into the game that the two-tight end package was going to be on the field a little bit more than it has in prior weeks.\" \nThe downside to playing two tight ends is it takes another skill position player off the field, usually a wide receiver. The personnel package where Celek and Ertz are most prominently featured brings Matthews to the sideline. \nWith the New York Giants visiting on Monday, the tight ends could again be involved. The Giants have struggled covering tight ends this season, allowing 36 catches for 395 yards and four touchdowns against tight ends in five games, an average of 7.2 catches, 79 yards, and 0.8 touchdowns. And in two games against the Giants last season, the Eagles' tight ends averaged 6.5 catches for 87.5 yards and 1.5 touchdowns. \n\"Hopefully it stays in the game plan,\" Ertz said. \nNotable. The Eagles signed offensive lineman Tanner Hawkinson from the San Francisco 49ers practice squad and released Julian Vandervelde. Hawkinson, 25, is a 6-5, 300-pound tackle from Kansas. He appeared in four games with the Cincinnati Bengals in 2012 and 2014. Hawkinson was a fifth-round pick in the 2013 draft.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:49:03.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
