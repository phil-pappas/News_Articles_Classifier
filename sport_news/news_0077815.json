Though I did not know it at the time, the best advice I received in preparation for my iron-distance triathlon (2.4 mile swim, 112 mile bike, 26.2 mile run) was also the simplest: \"Expect the unexpected.\" This held true not only for race day, but also the days leading up to it. The advance forecast for Sandusky, Ohio, the site of Challenge Cedar Point 140.6, was perfect. Sunny, cool, and most importantly, winds of 1 mile per hour. Sitting on the shores of Lake Erie, Sandusky is legendary for its wind, the bane of all triathletes. With the race scheduled for Sunday, we left Rochester on Friday for the 5-hour drive to Sandusky. The plan was to spend a relaxed Saturday readying for the race, packing the many bags of nutrition and changes of clothing an iron distance race requires, attending the mandatory athletes meeting and setting up our bicycles in the transition area. Leaving Rochester, the weather was perfect. Sunny, seasonable temperatures and no wind. But as we traveled through Pennsylvania and into Ohio, the winds picked up and the blue sky turned to storm clouds. As we approached Sandusky, the rain began, eventually turning into a torrential downpour. When making hotel reservations I had specifically not chosen a lake view room, as I feared I'd obsess over the lake, where the swim was to be held. Unfortunately, our room had a lake view, and upon opening the curtains Friday, we were greeted by whitecaps. While the storm was predicted to pass overnight, high winds were forecast for the weekend. Checking my phone when I woke Saturday morning, I found a warning I had never seen before, a \"swimming advisory.\" I further learned that the sprint triathlon scheduled for Saturday had been changed to a 5k \"fun run\" because of damage sustained by the race organizer's equipment due to the storm, and viewed a video of the devastation. Opening the curtains, I found the storm to have abated, but continued strong winds and whitecaps. Due to the state of the lake (a boat had overturned while attempting to set up the sprint course and its occupants had to be rescued by the Coast Guard!) the chance of the swim being held in it was slim. One reason we chose Cedar Point, though, was because of an alternate swim location, an inland bay. I learned on social media and confirmed online however that swimming was prohibited in the bay, which was in the midst of a blue green algae bloom. Getting caught up in the social media frenzy, I began both looking at 138.2 stickers (the race distance minus the swim) and other iron distance triathlons. As I proceeded to the athletes meeting early Saturday afternoon I was pretty much resigned to the swim being canceled. Neither whitecaps nor algae bloom were ingredients for a safe swim. At the meeting, a miracle: We learned that the storm which had churned up the lake had dissipated the algae bloom. Thus, the swim was on in the bay and I could earn my 140.6 sticker after all. Not surprisingly, the swim was my most eventful discipline. It began at sunrise, and combining the darkness, my nearsightedness and a lack of buoys, I had a difficult time sighting. Luckily, a convoy of kayaks directed me. Half of the swim was in an unprotected area of the bay, which I can only describe as the equivalent of swimming in a washing machine (the half iron swim, which began after ours, was rerouted in only the protected marina area of the bay). As I struggled, I could only think I would miss the time cutoff. But I remained remarkably calm. I finally understood the importance of being comfortable in the water preached by my swim coach. When I emerged from the water, I was sans wedding ring, which had fallen off in the cold water. But the ring could be replaced. I had made the cutoff by 20 minutes! My weak link complete, I knew absent disaster I would be an ironman! The bike was windy (sustained at 20 mph with gusts close to 30) and I suffered a flat tire at mile 30, but when I passed my wife at mile 90 of the bike I knew we were both going to finish. As for the run, I learned from mistakes at past marathons and ran a smart (albeit slow) 26.2 miles. When I crossed the finish line I felt my 30 weeks of hard work had paid off. Cheering as my wife crossed the line was a highlight of our almost 19-year marriage. So, bucket list item checked off, right? Uh, no. I know I can do better and have targeted 2017 for my next iron distance tri. Don't get me wring, though. I am thrilled to be one of the few who can call themselves an \"Ironman!\" By Steven Levitsky", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:46:44.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
