Dayton, 16, died after the Ford F-150 pickup truck he was driving rolled off Interstate 82 just east of Benton City on Monday night. \nTwo passengers in the truck, Jacob D. Kutrowski and Conner J. Perryman, both 17, were treated and later released from Kadlec Regional Medical Center on Tuesday. \nIt appears Andrew drove off the highway while heading east, then overcorrected, which caused the truck to roll, according to the Washington State Patrol. Troopers do not believe alcohol or drugs were involved. It’s unclear whether the teens were wearing seat belts. \nAndrew was a junior at Kamiakin High School in Kennewick and had attended the school since his freshman year, a school district official said. Counselors were available Tuesday for students who needed support. \nJacob attends Kamiakin High, and Conner is a student at River’s Edge High School in Richland. \nA post to an online page for a GoFundMe account started for the Dayton family described Andrew as a free thinker who was independent. \n“Despite his independent nature, at (the) young age of 16 he had an exciting future ahead of him,” said the post, written by a friend of the family. “And he was very loved by family and friends and will be sorely missed.” \nDonations to help pay for funeral costs beat the fund’s $10,000 goal Tuesday night. More than 150 people had contributed. \nStudents at Kamiakin were asked by classmates to wear flannel and camouflage clothing to school Tuesday to honor Andrew. A candlelight vigil was held at the duck pond at Columbia Park. To donate to the Dayton family, go to https://www.gofundme.com/2z69zqkg .
