Hingle-USA TODAY Sports Cowboys owner Jerry Jones took a shot at his own quarterback when touting the talents of Drew Brees. One week Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones is trying to convince the media that his backup quarterback is the best in the business, and the next he uses him as an example of why the team was unable to win a tight game.\nAdChoices After Drew Brees connected with C.J. Spiller for an 80-yard game-winning touchdown in overtime Sunday night, Jones said it is hard to beat a guy like Brees when your quarterback is “limited.”\n“I thought he did real good,” Jones said of Brandon Weeden, per Clarence Hill of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram . “He did good all night long. He took his initial look and threw it. He does some real good things, though it’s not quite apples and oranges when the guy on the other side of the deal is Brees and you’re dealing with a guy who is as limited as Weeden. We got in it even running out of time, or short-handed, in 2-minute or what have you, then these quarterbacks like Brees make a difference.”\nLimited? Jones obviously meant that as more of a compliment to Brees than a shot at Weeden, but it was less than two weeks ago that Jerruh was touting Weeden as one of the best passers in the game .\nWeeden looked pretty sharp when he drove the Cowboys 91 yards down the field and capped off a game-tying drive with a 17-yard touchdown pass to Terrance Williams. He ended up completing 16-of-26 passes for 246 yards, a touchdown and no interceptions. It wasn’t enough, as the Dallas defense fell asleep in overtime and allowed Spiller to take off.\nA significant injury to this running back didn’t help the Cowboys on Sunday. Weeden actually kept them in the game, but what will Jones say next week when Tom Brady comes to town? That game has the potential to get ugly.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/cowboys-lance-dunbar-torn-acl-mcl/276664", "http://www.star-telegram.com/sports/nfl/dallas-cowboys/article37756947.html", "http://larrybrownsports.com/football/jerry-jones-brandon-weeden-gifted-passer/274967", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:00:56.722+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
