FOOTBALL: Big-play Marshfield downs Bridgewater-Raynham, 40-28 Marshfield scores on a 64-yard touchdown pass and a 92-yard interception return en route to a 40-28 win over the Trojans. Comment By Scott RocheENTERPRISE CORRESPONDENT Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 11:02 pm Updated at 11:18 PM BRIDGEWATER – Big plays and turnovers proved to be costly for the Bridgewater-Raynham High football team on Friday night. After giving up a 64-yard touchdown pass on the game’s opening play and then throwing a costly interception late in the first half while driving for the potential tying touchdown to fall behind, 22-6, at the break, the Trojans were unable to recover in a 40-28 non-league loss to visiting Marshfield. Marshfield (4-0) needed just one play to score on the game’s first drive when quarterback Jack Masterson dropped back and hit a wide open Jason Darcy for a 64-yard touchdown. Masterson then found Danny Dalton in the back of the end zone for a two-point conversion and an 8-0 lead just 20 seconds into the game. Bridgewater-Raynham (1-3) responded on the ensuing possession. The Trojans marched 80 yards in 17 plays, with the bulk of work being done by Shawn Noel (30 carries, 115 yards). The junior back had 11 carries for 45 yards, including a 10-yard touchdown run to cut the deficit to 8-6 with 2:31 left in the first quarter. Marshfield regained the lead midway through the second quarter when the Rams went 79 yards on 10 plays and Masterson finished off the drive with a 23-yard TD pass on fourth down to Kyle Meeken for a 14-6 lead. B-R moved to the Rams’ 8-yard line on the next possession and faced a fourth-and-3 with a minute left in the first half when disaster struck. Dalton picked off a pass and raced 92 yards for a touchdown. Pat Kenneally caught the two-point conversion pass from Masterson for a 22-6 lead. On the Trojans’ opening drive of the third quarter, Marshfield’s Adam McNamara picked off a pass on fourth down and returned it 53 yards for a TD for a 28-6 lead. Christian Friedel’s 1-yard TD run for Marshfield blunted B-R’s comeback bid and gave the Rams a 34-21 lead in the fourth quarter. Brendan Ward’s 85-yard kickoff return for a score was Marshfield’s final TD.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:49:23.749+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
