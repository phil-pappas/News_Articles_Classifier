Show Caption Previous Next \nThe Tennessee swimming and diving program opens its home schedule Friday with the Orange and White Intrasquad Meet at the Allen Jones Intercollegiate Aquatic Center. \nThe event begins at 3 p.m. Admission is free. \nThis is the fourth year of the men's and women's combined scoring Orange and White Meet. The Orange team has won two of the first three years, including last year. \nThe Vols' intrasquad meet is different than most scrimmages because swimmers and divers are selected to either the orange or white team as freshmen and remain on that team for the rest of their career. \nThis year, the Orange and White meet will include alumni swimmers and divers for the first time. Each graduate can earn points for the team they competed with in college. More than 10 former SEC champions are scheduled to participate. \nBaseball: Tennessee continues fall baseball practice with a practice and intrasquad scrimmages Friday at Lindsey Nelson Stadium. \nPractice starts at 2:30 p.m. The scrimmage is at 4:45. \nAll practices and scrimmages are free and open to the public. \nSoftball: Tennessee softball players Meghan Gregg, Rainey Gaffin, Erin Gabriel and Lauren Irwin earned NFCA Division I All-American Scholar Athlete honors for the 2014-15 academic year. \nThe honor was awarded to 5,493 softball players across seven membership divisions, who recorded a GPA of 3.5 or higher. \nVolleyball: As part of Sunday's kids day promotion, a free youth volleyball clinic will follow Sunday's match between Tennessee and No. 22 Arkansas at Thompson-Boling Arena. \nThe match begins at 1:30 p.m. Doors open an hour before the match. \nThe clinic is open to ages 12 and younger. A tour of the team locker room will also take place. Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
