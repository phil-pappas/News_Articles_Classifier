I really wanted to go out on the court and try to win today.” \nMuguruza reached her first Grand Slam final this year at Wimbledon, losing to Serena Williams in straight sets. She was the first Spanish woman to reach a Grand Slam final since Conchita Martinez lost the French Open final in 2000, and the first to do so at Wimbledon since Sanchez-Vicario in 1995 and 1996. \nFourth-seeded Petra Kvitova and sixth-seeded Angelique Kerber were playing in the second singles match Monday. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T16:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:33:19.064+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
