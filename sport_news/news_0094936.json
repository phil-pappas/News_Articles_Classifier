After gracing us with a heck of a week during your press tour for The Martian , we’re here to give back with a gift just as special (but hopefully not as stressful). Here, we mapped out the places on which you’ve left your mark around our fair city. Bostonians, we give you full permission to take the Matt Damon Boston City Tour you never knew you wanted.\n1. Lesley University\nDamon’s mom, Nancy Carlsson-Paige, works at Lesley as a professor of early childhood education. She’s been there for 30-plus years .\n2. Harvard University\nDamon attended Harvard, but left in the spring of 1993 without a degree and headed for Hollywood with his Boston buddy named Ben Affleck. Not more than three years later, much of Good Will Hunting was shot around the area (even after the school originally refused to let them inside).\n3. Tasty Sandwich Shop\nThe Tasty is where Damon’s famous burger scene with Minnie Driver in GWH takes place. It closed in 1997 when Cambridge Savings Bank rebuilt the building on that corner. Now, instead of fabulous beefs, the area houses an Urban Outfitters, among other things. Le sigh.\nMiramax 4. Cambridge Rindge & Latin School\nDamon and Affleck went to high school here together. Damon’s high school drama teacher once told Boston magazine , “The first thing he said to me was, ‘I’m going to be an actor. He was so focused and eager.’” Aw.\n5. The Janus cinema\nOne summer, this was a place of employment for both Damon and Affleck, according to The Huffington Post . The biggest movie at that time happened to be Dead Poets Society , a movie they both auditioned for. The theater closed in 1998.\n6. (The old) Dunkin’ Donuts/Baskin-Robbins\nThe ever-famous ‘How do you like them apples’ scene was shot here . It’s now home to the Grafton Street Pub & Grill. The ice cream/doughnut hybrid store closed in 2000 and reopened two doors down in 2003.\n7. Central Square\nDamon told Vanity Fair that when he was 10 years old, he moved into a communal house in Central with his mom and brother.\n8. Massachusetts General Hospital\nDamon has been a big advocate for Massachusetts General Hospital over the years, having made in-person appearances at its cancer center’s “the one hundred” event in 2011, 2012, and 2014, Boston Business Journal reports . His dad, Kent Damon, received treatment at Mass General for multiple myeloma.\n9. Boston Public Garden\nThe most famous Good Will Hunting scene— that bench scene between Damon and Robin Williams— was filmed here.\nMiramax 10. Sonsie Restaurant\nA Newbury Street restaurant that Damon was rumored to frequent in the early 2000s. People reports that Damon and Affleck cohosted a New Year’s Eve bash at Sonsie after their GWH success.\n11. Legal Sea Foods\nIn a 2014 Reddit AMA , Damon said Legal Sea Foods is one of his favorite restaurants in Boston. He unfortunately neglected to mention which one exactly, so let’s just assume he meant the one at Park Square.\n12. Boston Municipal Court, South Boston Division\nThe court at which Will was sentenced in Good Will Hunting . Matt and Ben also shot a St. Patrick’s Day Parade scene in Southie along Broadway, but it was cut from the movie .\n13. L Street Tavern\nCharlie Harrington, location manager on Good Will Hunting , said that he, Damon, and Affleck took Robin Williams here so he’d get a sense of the area. Then came what led to an almost-brawl due to Ben having his hat on backwards inside the bar. (Yes, really.) Ah, Boston guys at heart.\nPlus, the many haircuts of Matt Damon:\nPrevious -- of -- Next In “Good Will Hunting,” Damon sports something like a bowl cut with a prominent part.
