Shooting guard Wesley Matthews and point guard Deron Williams also scrimmaged Thursday, and coach Rick Carlisle said Matthews and Williams might make their preseason debuts Friday, when Dallas plays Chicago in Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\"We'll see,\" Carlisle said. \"If they wake up feeling good (Friday), there's a good chance.\"\nMatthews ruptured his left Achilles' tendon on March 5. That injury typically take nine or more months of rehab, but Matthews has insisted all along that his goal was to play in the Oct. 28 season opener at Phoenix. The Mavericks have said they'll be cautious with Matthews' and Parsons' timetables, but Matthews clearly is well ahead of where many believe he would be at this point.\nWilliams missed the first three preseason games with a right calf sprain and the next three preseason games with a left calf sprain. Not surprisingly, Dallas is 0-6.\n\"Today was actually the first time me, Wes, Deron and Dirk (Nowitzki) were on the floor together at the same time,\" Parsons noted.\n\"It's going to be good, man. When we're healthy, we have a chance. We have a chance to compete in a tough conference. That's obviously our biggest issue is getting our guys back and being smart about it. But when we're healthy, we're going to be a fun team to watch and a tough team to play.\"\nParsons, Williams and Matthews were part of a 3-on-3 game Wednesday morning. When he emerged from the game pain-free, Parsons was told that if he had no setbacks overnight that he would be cleared to scrimmage on Thursday.\n\"Besides being exhausted and tired, I felt fine,\" Parsons said. \"A little bit rusty. Obviously it's going to take some time to get back to 100-percent, with making reads and timing and everything like that, but it's very positive that I'm able to get through a whole practice without any pain or pulling me out or anything.\"\nLike Matthews, Parsons' off-season-long goal has been to be ready by the season opener. Although he will not have played in any preseason games, Parsons said that if he has no setbacks over the weekend and is able to string together three or four good practices next week, he sees no reason why he can't play in the opener.\n\"I think most of it's mental at this point,\" he said. \"I've put in the work. I've put in the time. I've put in all the rehab. My legs are stronger than they've ever been. There's still going to be some mind games between the ears where I'm going to have to overcome and trust it and not favor it. It's going to come with time.\n\"Today when I was playing, I really wasn't even thinking about it. I was just playing basketball and doing what I love. I'm sure as time goes on and the more I play on it, the more comfortable I'll be.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @townbrad", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/townbrad"], "published": "2015-10-22T22:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:20:09.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
