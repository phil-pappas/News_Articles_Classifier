Buy this photo Staff photo by Joe Sarno Michelle Froelich of Lakeland goes up for a spike against Clifton on Wednesday in the Passaic COunty Tournament semifinals. \nAfter seeing his third seeded Lancers lose a tightly contested match to second seeded Clifton in the PCT semifinals on Wednesday evening Phillips hopes that the players that will return to the Lancers next fall have developed a taste for the tournament atmosphere that they will be hungry for again next fall. \n\"I was really glad that they got to feel the energy and that they got to see that they could do it,\" said Phillips. \nAgainst a Clifton team that entered the semifinal game on an 11 game winning streak that Lancers gave it all that they had but came away on the short end of a 25-15, 25-20 score. \n\"I was glad for the seniors that they got to feel the juice [of playing in the county semifinals]. Hopefully the underclassman will want to get back because it is special to be here,\" said Phillips. \nIn the first game the Lancers jumped out to an 8-6 lead only to see the Mustangs take control of the set by going on a 14-4 run. \nIt looked as if the Mustangs would cruise to victory when they took a 20-12 lead in the second set but the Lancers refused to go away without a fight. \nLakeland closed to within 23-20 but that would be as close as they would get. \n\"They worked hard. They wanted to be here, the results are unfortunately what they were,\" said Phillips. \"They were diving all over the place and I told them that, that is what they need to do all the time not just for when they are in the counties. They proved that they can do it.\" \nThe Lancers, who will find out their seed in the upcoming state tournament on Wednesday, are still dedicated to finishing their season strong. \n\"It is super hard to win in states but a realistic goal is to get a home match and one win in the states. Anything we can do from there is gravy,\" said Phillips who coached his team to wins over Passaic Valley and Passaic in the 48 hours following the tournament loss to Clifton. \nEmail: costelloj@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:45:39.984+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
