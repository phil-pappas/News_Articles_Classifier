Afterward, the Penn State defensive tackle sprinted around the green, something that winded him and made his father laugh.\nTerry Zettel had just completed a round of chemotherapy that left him barely able to walk. But he was on the golf course that day, leaving a lasting memory for his son.\n\"There are a lot of good moments,\" Zettel said this week.\nPenn State's all-Big Ten lineman hasn't missed a game this season, even as his father faced the end of a 19-month bout with cancer. Terry Zettel died Sept. 25, one day before Penn State's game against San Diego State. He was 46.\nAnthony Zettel played a career game the next day, making seven tackles and recovering a fumble in the Lions' 37-21 win. The performance earned Zettel a nomination for the Orange Bowl-FWAA Courage Award, which recognizes a player who perseveres through injury or hardship.\n\"I was more focused than I've ever been,\" Zettel said of the San Diego State game. \"I felt like he was with me there every step of the way, so it just felt different. And I know every game I play from now on, or whatever I do in life, he's going to be with me.\"\nZettel's father attended the Penn State-Temple game in Philadelphia, and Penn State's coaches gave Anthony Zettel leeway during camp and practice to visit family at their Michigan home. Zettel said that he's proud to have played against San Diego State.\n\"It was an emotional little spurt for me there, but at the same time, my dad, that's what he would want,\" Zettel said. \"When I would come home and he was going through chemo sessions, he would be yelling at me, like, 'Get back to college and go do your thing, because sitting here with me, you're not doing anything you want to do and bettering yourself.'\"\nZettel, who entered the season as an all-America candidate, is among Penn State's biggest personalities on and off the field. He has become a social-media star through videos of himself tackling a tree and round-house kicking a water bottle in Penn State's locker room.\nThat locker room has been beside Zettel for the past month. Fellow defensive tackle Austin Johnson wrote Terry Zettel's nickname (\"T-Bone\") on his arm prior to the San Diego State game. Coach James Franklin, defensive line coach Sean Spencer and several players attended a memorial service for Terry Zettel in Michigan the day after that game.\n\"Anthony is a special kid,\" Franklin said. \"His family is really special. All his brothers in that locker room are going to have his back.\"\nZettel said he's looking forward to playing again Saturday, when Indiana visits on homecoming. He has three games left at Beaver Stadium and plans to cherish every one.\n\"I want to do this for the Penn State football family, this town, this community, my teammates, my coaches, my family back home,\" Zettel said. \"I have a lot to play for, and it really makes playing hard every game a lot easier.\"\nBARKLEY PRACTICING: Franklin said on his radio show Thursday that freshman back Saquon Barkley practiced this week but isn't 100 percent. The coach saved Barkley's status for Saturday.\nBarkley did not play against Army because of an ankle injury he sustained in the first half against San Diego State two weeks ago. The Whitehall High graduate told Franklin that he could have returned in both games.\n\"Based on what I saw, I don't think he could [have],\" Franklin said on the radio show. \"But you'd rather see [players] have that mentality.\"\nA HEALTHIER DEFENSE? Franklin also hopes for returns from safety Marcus Allen and linebacker Brandon Bell, both of whom missed the Army West Point game. A determination regarding their status will be made later this week as well.\n\"Having Marcus Allen and [safety] Jordan Lucas [who did start against Army] and Brandon Bell would be significant for us,\" Franklin said. \"I don't think there's any doubt about that. ... A lot of it is, how do they react [at practice]?\"\nTV CHANGE: The Penn State-Indiana broadcast has been shifted from ESPN2 to ESPN. The network made the change because of the time and venue change for Saturday's LSU-South Carolina game.\nPENN STATE VS.
