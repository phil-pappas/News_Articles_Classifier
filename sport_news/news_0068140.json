Mathews, Skinner brothers help Elkins even series with Ridge Point By Jack Marrion   \nThe Elkins football team allowed more points to Ridge Point standout B.J. Rainford in three quarters Oct. 15 at Mercer Stadium than it had against two previous opponents. \nBut with the game on the line, the Knights took over. Two momentous interceptions by A.J. Mathews, three late defensive stops and a stellar night by the Skinner brothers behind a strong offensive line led to a 35-28 victory. \nQuarterback Romanon Skinner rushed for a three-yard touchdown with 2:14 remaining to break a tie at 28. Mathews followed with a leaping interception and the Knights ran out the clock to avenge last year’s 30-21 loss. \n“I told them that’s a very good team and they’re going to score,” Elkins coach Dennis Brantley said. “Just as long as we get one more point. I like the way our team responded in the second half. That’s what I’m very proud of.” \nRomanon Skinner rushed for 174 yards and three touchdowns and opened the scoring with a 23-yard touchdown pass to Shemick Watts. Leonard Harris added a first-half touchdown and Romellus Skinner sprinted for 157 rushing yards, including a highlight-reel run to set up a 28-21 lead in the third quarter. \nThe result was a victory in a playoff atmosphere that improved Elkins’ record to 6-1 overall, 3-1 in District 23-5A. Ridge Point fell to 4-3 and 3-1. Both teams trailed Texas City, which was 3-0 entering an Oct. 17 game against Bush. \nRidge Point proved capable of moving the ball against Elkins, notably during a 14-point second quarter. The Panthers answered Elkins’ first touchdown with a 46-yard scoring strike from Shane Gosson to Terry Petry. \nThe Knights were driving for the go-ahead score when Shyler Staton’s interception dramatically stopped the drive. Rainford then showed his considerable speed on an 82-yard touchdown reception for a 14-7 Panthers lead. \nRainford struck again with 37 seconds remaining in the half, scoring from four yards out for a 21-14 lead. \nBut the Elkins defense tightened, allowing only a fourth-down screen pass from Gosson to Rainford that went for a touchdown late in the third quarter. \nRomanon Skinner’s first rushing touchdown tied the game at 21 with 5:43 left in the third, coming after a failed fake punt by Ridge Point. \nThe Panthers drove again, but a deep pass was picked by Mathews, and Romellus Skinner’s big run set up Romanon Skinner’s second touchdown and a 28-21 lead. \nThe teams exchanged punts in the fourth quarter, followed by Elkins forcing a key three-and-out. Ross Blacklock’s stop for a short gain was followed by a sack from Kenneth Orji on third down. \nWith four minutes remaining, the Knights kept the ball in Romanon Skinner’s hands, gaining every bit of the winning 67-yard drive on the ground. Romanon Skinner used a perfect option-read fake with his brother for a 19-yard gain, adding a 16-yarder after Romellus Skinner’s 11-yard run. \nRomanon Skinner finished the drive, giving Elkins its most significant victory of the season. The Knights remain in the thick of the district championship race, defeating a talented rival. \n“This was a hard-fought rivalry, great players and great coaches on both sides, a lot of class,” Brantley said. “We wanted this victory so bad. We couldn’t go home again with another loss in this rivalry.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:25:17.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
