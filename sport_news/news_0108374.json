Navy quarterback Keenan Reynolds runs the ball in for a touchdown in the second quarter. The Navy Midshipmen played the visiting East Carolina University Pirates in NCAA Football at Navy-Marine Corps Memorial Stadium Saturday. (By Paul W. Gillespie / Capital Gazette) Bill Wagner Contact Reporter bwagner@capgaznews.com Star QB disappointed in play against Air Force in 2014 \nOne overlooked aspect of why Keenan Reynolds has been so successful is the fact he is intensely competitive. \nNavy's senior quarterback has always stated that winning is all that matters to him and admitted that losing sticks with him for a while. \nOf all the impressive statistics Reynolds has compiled during his stellar career, the one he is most proud of is 24-11. That is Navy's record with Reynolds as the starting quarterback, and does not include the come-from-behind victory over Air Force that he engineered as a freshman. \nOf the 11 defeats he has absorbed as a starter, none hurt more than last year at Air Force. Reynolds, hobbled by a nagging knee injury, was responsible for two turnovers and did not play up to his usual standards as Navy fell, 30-21, at Falcon Stadium in Colorado Springs. \n\"That's one of our main goals every year. If you look on the (equipment) truck, right on the back of the trailer it says 'Beat Air Force.' So it's a big deal for us,\" Reynolds said after practice on Tuesday. \"That loss last year stung. Losing is never fun, but losing to a service academy rival is tougher.\" Hijinks abound before rivalry football game (Tim Prudente) \nReynolds is certainly hoping to conclude his career with a 7-1 record in service academy games and will no doubt be seeking some redemption when Navy hosts Air Force on Saturday afternoon in Annapolis. \n\"Absolutely!\" Reynolds responded when asked if he has added motivation against Air Force. \"At the same time, you still have to remember that it's football and the keys to winning are the same. You have to be careful to not overhype it, to remain calm and poised and do your job.\" \nReynolds suffered the knee injury in the second game against Temple when standout linebacker Tyler Matakevich blindsided him and put a helmet into his knee. Reynolds sat out the following game against Texas State, but came back in Week 4. Midshipmen rotating multiple players in order to keep everyone fresh (Bill Wagner) \nIn hindsight, that proved a poor decision as Reynolds was hobbled and clearly not himself for the next three games, all of which the Midshipmen lost. Air Force was the culmination of that 0-3 stretch and Reynolds did not play against Virginia Military Institute the following week. \nHaving also gotten a bye week to rest, Reynolds returned against San Jose State on Oct. 25 and was back to full speed. He was in top form in leading Navy to a 5-1 record the rest of the way, including wins over archrival Army and San Diego State in the Poinsettia Bowl. \nA year later, Reynolds refuses to blame his subpar performance against Air Force on the knee injury. He rushed for just 27 yards on 21 carries and completed only 6 of 14 passes for 126 yards, missing a couple wide-open receivers off play-action. \n\"I've never used that as an excuse. I was watching the (Air Force) film today and I felt like that wasn't a problem,\" Reynolds said of the injury. \"I just didn't play well, and as a result we lost. Simple as that. They outplayed us that game and got the best of us.\" \nReynolds fumbled in his own territory and that turnover led to points for Air Force. He cost Navy points when he tried to force a pass to slotback Calvin Cass Jr., who had the ball wrestled away from him in the end zone by safety Christian Spears. \n\"It all started with turnovers. We had an interception in the end zone that was a huge play and we fumbled on our side of the field,\" Reynolds said. \"We didn't finish drives the way we needed to and that's why we got beat.\" \nNavy head coach Ken Niumatalolo does believe the injury affected Reynolds against Air Force last season. \n\"Keenan wasn't close to being 100 percent. He could barely move his leg. He sucked it up because he wanted to try to help us beat Air Force,\" Niumatalolo told the audience during a Navy football luncheon on Tuesday afternoon. \"Keenan is a competitive dude. I think he's quietly looking forward to this game.\" \nAir Force knew Reynolds was nursing an injury and clearly came in with the intention of roughing him up. Reynolds absorbed some vicious blows on quarterback keepers and even a couple questionable hits after handing the ball off. Cornerback Justin DeCoud was flagged for targeting after drilling Reynolds well after he had pitched the ball. \nReynolds was asked this week whether he is worried the Falcons will try similar tactics. \n\"That's how it is every week. I'm going to be a runner most of the time so teams are going to be physical. Every week somebody is trying to knock my head off,\" he said. \"That's the name of the game and if you don't want to get hit, then you aren't going to last long. I just keep playing, keep running hard.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:29:04.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
