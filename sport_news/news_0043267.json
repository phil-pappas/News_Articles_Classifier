I can't believe I killed my Jakey.''\nThe police response is detailed in a probable cause affidavit that was unsealed and filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court on Wednesday. The affidavit does not indicate what led up to the shooting.\nDavidoff has pleaded not guilty to a two-count indictment, charging her with murder and unlawful use of a weapon in the fatal shooting of Jacob Davidoff. Davidoff died from a gunshot wound to the back.\nGresham police had been called to the home in the 2800 block of Southeast Rosefinch Drive at 7:30 p.m.\nGresham Police Officer Mark DeLong found the teen's grandmother standing in the doorway to the home, signaling him to go upstairs.\nOn the second floor, DeLong saw Dianne Davidoff perform chest compressions on her son, as he lay on the second floor, near a doorway to a bedroom. DeLong pulled the teen out of the doorway and placed him in the middle of the hallway to help perform CPR, the affidavit said.\nAs he did, according to the affidavit, he heard Dianne Davidoff saying, \"I killed my Jakey! I can't believe I killed my Jakey!''\nDeLong asked the mother where the firearm was, and she pointed to a second-floor bedroom.\nGresham Sgt. Jared McGowan found a silver Ruger SP101 .38 special revolver on the bed, with bullets lying next to it, across from a fanny pack, deputy district attorney Amanda Nadell wrote in the affidavit.\nDianne Davidoff was also overheard talking to herself, police said, saying, \"Why did I do that? Why did I hurt him!? Why did I kill my baby!?'\nWhile police were in the home, Jacob Davidoff's father, Ryan Davidoff was walking to the residence. He told officers he was there to check on his son. The father was unaware the 17-year-old had been shot. Detectives notified the dad that his son was dead, the affidavit said.\nAccording to court records, Dianne Davidoff was in the process of moving that day into her parents' home with her children and her sister and sister's kids because she had lost her house due to foreclosure. She had been drawing unemployment benefits since she resigned in mid-July from a job in an orthodontist's office, the court records said.\nShe told court officials that she's been diagnosed with anxiety and attention deficit disorder, takes medication for it and uses marijuana several times daily for treatment, according to court records.\nDavidoff is being held at the Multnomah County Detention Center without bail.\n-- Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212\n@maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/maxoregonian"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:07:52.146+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
