Yet, they are both members of Canada’s middle class.\nThat group — a favourite target for pandering politicians — is so encompassing that it can include a single mother who earns $35,000 a year and a family pulling in more than $120,000, depending on whom you ask.\nThere are hundreds of working definitions of the middle class — based on everything from a family’s wealth to how many computers they own — and some economists say the term has become so nebulous as to be meaningless.\nAnxieties about the struggling middle class have sharpened into focus in the aftermath of the Great Recession amid slow economic growth, widespread job losses, declining job security, cost-of-living increases and sky-high household debt loads.\nAaron Harris/ Toronto Star\nKaty Pedersen and son Henry shown in Toronto, Ontario, October 1, 2015. Pedersen and her husband are middle class but quite comfortable. She believes the daycare cheque she receives for her 4-year-old son might be better off going to less forunate children he plays on the playground with.\nThe fate of the middle class is one of the defining issues of this federal election campaign, said Frank Graves, president of EKOS Research.\nA decade ago, 70 per cent of Canadians self-identified as middle class. That number has dropped below 50 per cent, Graves said, adding just 13 per cent of Canadians believe their children will be better off than they are.\n“The whole middle-class bargain is broken,” he said. “It’s deeply concerning and people say it’s always been like that. Well, no it hasn’t.”\nThe middle class is a buzzword on the campaign trail as federal leaders try to tap into fears that the “Canadian Dream” is getting further out of reach.\n“The middle-class issue is more one of a long-term perspective and anxiety that the old model of shared prosperity based on middle class progress is no longer working, and that that’s producing a stagnant economy and a dark outlook on what’s happening in the future,” Graves said.\nMiddle class angst is not unfounded.\nA popular definition of the term includes the middle 60 per cent of income earners, which could mean any family unit or unattached individual whose yearly earnings range from $27,400 to $118,000, based on Statistics Canada 2013 median income data.\nCrystal Schick/ Toronto Star\nLisa Belanger laughs with her husband Lou Pokol at their kitchen table where they enjoy coffee every morning in their Canmore, Alta., home, on September 21, 2015.\nIncome for the middle 60 per cent of families comprised 56 per cent of total income in Canada at its peak in the late ’70s, but has since fallen to 51 per cent. Meanwhile, the share contributed by the upper 20 per cent of households has risen to 43 per cent from 38 per cent in the same period. Incomes for the middle 60 per cent of households grew by 17 per cent between 1977 and 2011, while the upper 20 per cent saw growth of 49 per cent.\nThe shift in the middle class is as much due to upward mobility among higher-end earners as downward pressure on jobs at the lower end, said Philip Cross, former chief economist at Statistics Canada and a senior fellow at the Macdonald-Laurier Institute.\nBut politicians prefer to refer to the group as a whole in order to appeal to as many voters as possible, Cross said.\nWhen asked, none of the three leading parties provided an income range they consider to be middle class. That, Cross said, is a tip-off that pledges aimed at restoring middle-class progress are merely electioneering tactics, not real attempts to fix any problems.\n“If you announce a policy that says: ‘I’m going to help the middle class’ then everyone’s going to say: ‘He’s trying to help me!’\n“But if you say: ‘I’m going to help just one in 10 of you who has had a tough time over the past decade,’ most people are going to shrug and say: ‘Big deal, what’s in it for me?’ ”\nRick Madonik/ Toronto Star\nJose Cabanes works at a minimum pay job at Pearson International Airport. Cabanas left a civil service job in The Philippines hoping for a middle class existence for himself, his wife and their four children. It hasn't worked out that way as he works for such a low wage despite his experience and abilities.\nLumping together professionals — who share more in common in terms of education and skill levels with the upper class — with factory workers and clerical staff — whose job security is precariously close to that of low-income earners — belies the truth about which members of the middle class are genuinely struggling: those on the bottom, he said.\nThose are the groups that politicians should target, said Charles Beach, an income distribution expert and professor emeritus at Queen’s University.\nPoliticians need to focus on measures aimed at training and education for low-skilled workers, and on providing a better social safety net through with improved Employment Insurance to help members of the middle class who are struggling most, he said.\nBroad-based policies, such as across-the-board tax breaks are simpler to understand, easier to implement and more pleasant to sell, Beach added.\n“But they’re inefficient in the sense that a number of people who will get it — who benefit from it — don’t need it at all,” he said. “That’s a waste of resources that could be more efficiently used if they were targeted at the groups that needed it.”\nWho is middle class?\nThere are more than 100 ways to define the middle class based on income alone. Some methods use pre-tax income, while others say after-tax is the true measure; some focus on household incomes while others target individual earnings.\nMedian income\nFinding the median income — half earn more and half earn less — and then identifying a range around it is perhaps the most common method. One measure defines the middle class as families who earn between 50 per cent and 150 per cent of median income. Economist Charles Beach says that would result in a middle class range of family income between $41,800 and $125,300.\nBy percentile\nThe percentile-based method divides Canadians into deciles to capture the middle portion of incomes, usually the middle 60 per cent of the population, which excludes the top and bottom 20 per cent of earners. That would result in a middle class family income range between $46,200 and $142,500.\nMiddle-fifth\nOne of the narrowest definitions selects just the middle fifth of the income distribution. That would put the range of income for middle class families at between $70,500 to $100,100.\nNet worth\nOne popular defining characteristic of the middle class is its members’ ability to accumulate wealth and generate a flow of income to raise their well-being. Median net worth in 2012 was $243,800, so any family with wealth around that range would be considered middle class. The middle two quintiles in Canada have a net worth between $245,000 and $575,000.\nEquity and Lifestyle\nSome researchers define members of the middle class based on their possessions and lifestyle. This definition includes the wide segment of Canadians who have the means to own assets — including homes and cars. Given that about 70 per cent of Canadians own homes, this definition is one of the broadest measures.\nI think there I am (middle class)\nSelf-definition is a subjective method of determining who is middle class, but provides a good indicator of how people feel. Self-reporting Canadians tend to move themselves down in class levels compared to where statisticians would calculate they are based on earnings. The number of Canadians who identify as middle class has dropped off significantly since the recession. In a January survey conducted by Pollara Strategic Insights, 52 per cent of Canadians identified as middle class; 36 per cent identified as working class; 9 per cent identified as poor; and 3 per cent identified as upper class.\nWe asked the three major federal parties for their definition of the middle class. Here’s what they said:\nThe Liberals:\nThe official response: “We refer to ‘the broadest swath of Canadians whose working income gives them the capacity to provide decent housing, quality of life, and a good education for their families, while saving for a dignified retirement.’ ”\nThe unofficial definition: The Liberals’ middle class tax cuts would apply to individuals earning a pre-tax income of $44,700 to $89,401.\nThe NDP:\nThe official response: “Millions of Canadians identify themselves as middle class. They work hard, play by the rules and strive to give their children a better future.”\nThe unofficial definition: The New Democrats have suggested in the past that their definition focuses on the middle 60 per cent of earners.\nThe Conservatives:\nThe official response: “We don’t believe in the politics of division and so-called class warfare.”\nThe unofficial definition: The Conservatives have suggested that families with kids that have a pre-tax income of $120,000 or below are part of the middle class.\nMore on thestar.com\nJohnson & Johnson launches Ebola vaccine trial in Sierra Leone\nFerrari speeding towards 11 billion euro valuation", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:08:36.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
