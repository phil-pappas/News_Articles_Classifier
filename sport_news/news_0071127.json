No problems with the call at all.” \nAnd after Turton strategically slid his PK into the lower left corner past Novi goalkeeper Luke McDonald, the Shamrocks were able to keep the Wildcats off the board for the remainder of the match and move through to the next round. \nCC coach Gene Pulice credited the win to his team’s captains and senior leadership. \n“I think tonight was a standout performance from Justin Murray, leading us in the back,” Pulice said. “We had Matt Turton, who had just come back from a little bit of a head injury, back to 100 percent. He’s one of our captains and he came back. Then, of course, Peter Kirouac, our goalkeeper, who is another captain, who I think had an outstanding performance tonight.” \nShots on goal were hard to come by throughout the 80-minute match and it was reflected on the stat sheet. \n“It was hard-fought,” O’Leary said. “I thought a lot of the game was in between 30-yard lines. Actually, I thought it was a boring game from a spectators’ viewpoint. We had five shots and they had seven. And those are shots trying to shoot on goal. I’ll bet you of our five, that four of them were harmless. And of their seven, I’ll bet six of them were harmless. There weren’t many opportunities for either team, just that one busted play.” \nThe Shamrocks were able to put together a total team effort, according to Pulice. \n“I think everybody worked really hard,” he said. ‘We had a game plan everybody executed tonight well. We had Cole Moscovic, who stood on his head tonight and made a lot of big tackles and won a lot of balls for us. Jared Lee, defensive center-mid, who showed up tonight to play. Pat Flemming, our left back, who shut them down time and time and time again. Up top, we had Noah Walter, who broke through going to goal. It was a PK, but he broke through on a huge effort, so we drew the PK and we got a little bit lucky there.” \nThe Shamrocks were also able to keep Novi from penetrating the box area with its signature restarts on throw-ins and corner kicks. \n“My hat’s off to Novi tonight as well; they played a solid game,” Pulice said. “They have the best thrower (Connor O’Leary) that I’ve seen, so they can throw balls in from midfield and they’re difficult to defend.” \nNovi ends its season at 11-6-2 and will lose nine seniors to graduation. \n“It’s a class I’ve known for a long time, just because my son (Connor) is a senior, so a lot of those kids I’ve known,” O’Leary said. “Really, what I’ll miss is that they’re geniunely good kids. They work hard and they’re very coachable. They care about each other and they play the game the right way.” \nbemons@hometownlife.com 71 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.hometownlife.com/story/sports/high-school/novi/2015/10/20/shamrocks-pk-ousts-novi-district/74254924/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:12:24.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
