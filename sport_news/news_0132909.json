The mother of the rage-filled loner who shot and killed nine people at an Oregon community college blasted opponents of open-carry laws and bragged about her personal arsenal of weapons online, according to reports.\nLaurel Harper, a nurse who shared an apartment near the Umpqua Community College campus with her troubled 26-year-old son Chris Harper Mercer, boasted on Facebook that she owned a stockpile of handguns and assault rifles, according to vocativ.com .\n“And when the mood strikes, and as long as we’re tossing around brand names, I sling an AR, Tek-9 or AK over my shoulder, or holster a Glock 21 (not 22), or one of my other handguns, like the Sig Sauer P226, and walk out the door,” Harper bragged. “I find the shotguns are a little too cumbersome to open carry.”\nThe Facebook post was in response to comments about open-carry laws.\nMichael Sullivan/AP Mercer was killed during a shootout with police. Harper and Mercer moved to Winchester, Oregon, from Torrance, California, around 2013, neighbors and officials said.\nFormer neighbors that knew the pair in California said that Mercer kept to himself, but if he did talk, it would be as if he was having a temper tantrum.\nBut many described Harper as the opposite, outgoing, chatty and looking to make a new start in Oregon.\nSTEVE DIPAOLA/REUTERS The killer asked his victims if they were Christian before shooting them at point blank range, witnesses said. Harper hid her love for weaponry beneath her sunny exterior, and even argued that open-carry laws would not work everywhere.\nOREGON COMMUNITY COLLEGE SHOOTER WAS ‘ANGRY YOUNG MAN FILLED WITH HATE’: REPORTS “\nYou can’t be that naive, can you? It’s ridiculously easy to understand the apprehension associated with open carry. I moved from So. Calif. to Oregon, from Southern Crime-a-mania to open carry. An open carry law won’t work everywhere,” Harper wrote.\nRandy L. Rasmussen/AP People gather for a candlelight vigil at Stewart Park in Roseburg, Ore. Officials said her son was heavily armed when he arrived on the campus Thursday morning, carrying a half-dozen weapons with him.\nSeven other weapons were recovered from the home the mother and son shared, officials said.\nThe killer asked his victims if they were Christian before shooting them at point blank range, witnesses said.\nMercer died in a shootout with police shortly after the gunfire began at 10:38 a.m. Thursday.\nWith News Wire Services\nRelated Stories Giuliani changes tune on guns, slams Obama's push for laws Jeb Bush on Oregon college shooting: ‘Stuff happens' Nine Umpqua Community College shooting victims identified", "external_links": ["http://www.vocativ.com/news/236762/oregon-shooter-chris-harper-mercer-guns/"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:11:12.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
