(AP) — If Alex Morgan is on the verge of joining the National Women’s Soccer League’s new expansion team in Orlando, she still isn’t ready to say so just yet. \nMorgan says nothing is confirmed regarding a possible trade that would send her from the Portland Thorns to Orlando’s newly announced expansion team. But she acknowledged Saturday that her agent is in negotiations with the city she calls home. \nThe U.S. national team forward who helped the Americans win the recent World Cup made her comments before practice for Sunday’s exhibition match against Brazil. \nSports Illustrated first reported the potential deal that would send Morgan and Canadian Kaylyn Kyle to Orlando for the Pride’s first pick of the NWSL draft, two international slots, and the U.S. national team defender Meghan Klingenberg, currently with the Houston Dash.
