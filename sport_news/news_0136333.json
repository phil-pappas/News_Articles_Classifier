Show Caption Previous Next \nThe Tennessee swimming and diving team ended its two-day road trip Friday with a split against Virginia in Charlottesville, Va. \nThe UT men beat Virginia 210-90 to improve to 3-0 this season. The Tennessee women lost 174-121. Both Tennessee squads were coming off Thursday wins at Missouri. \nOn Friday, the Vols won 21 of 32 total events. The Tennessee men were dominant in the pool and on the springboards, winning 15 of 16 events. \n\"The thing that was most impressive with our men today is that we won every close race we were in,\" Tennessee coach Matt Kredich said in a school release. \"We didn't let up even when the meet was in hand. It's a testament of our values of our men's team to get better every day and to compete. We had some great finishes and dominant performances at the beginning.\" \nThe diving squad won all four competitions, led by senior Mauricio Robles' pair of victories on the 1-meter and 3-meter springboards. \nSophomore Sam McHugh wrapped up a successful weekend of swimming, collecting three more individual victories. The Tennessee native won the 200-yard butterfly (1:47.26), the 500 freestyle (4:27.20) and the 400 individual medley by eight seconds (3:52.39) The wins gave him six total in two meets; he won three races against Missouri (200 fly, 200 free, 200 IM). \n\"Sam showed a lot of versatility this weekend,\" Kredich said. \"He had a disappointing summer for him. I was worried about his confidence going in, but he's competing at a high level. It seems like he's on a mission.\" \nOn the women's side, Tennessee (2-1) won six events against a Virginia team that placed fifth at NCAAs. Tennessee finished 11th last year. \nSeniors Harper Bruens and Faith Johnson notably went 1-2 in the 50 freestyle, with Bruens going under 23 seconds in 22.96. \nTennessee won the final three events of the day, with freshman Madeline Banic winning the 100 butterfly (53.77), senior Lauren Driscoll taking the 400 IM (4:15.91) and UT winning the 200 freestyle relay (1:31.51). \nMen's Tennis: With a trio of three-set victories, three Tennessee men's tennis players advanced to the round of 16 at the USTA/ITA Ohio Valley Regional Championships at UT's Goodfriend Tennis Center. \nSophomores Igor Smelyanski, Preston Touliatos and Luis Valero all advanced to the third day of competition.
