It’s Jones’ eighth shutout in 36 NHL games. s He stopped 19 shots in San Jose’s 5-1 win in Los Angeles on Wednesday. \n“The few breakdowns we had — I had one — he makes you look pretty good at the end of the night,” Sharks captain Joe Pavelski said. “It’s awesome to see. We’re excited with the way he’s started here and it’s given us a lot of confidence.” \nMarleau scored his second goal of the game — and No. 458 of his career — with a wrap-around effort at 15:10 of the third period. Newcomer Joel Ward collected the only assist, his second helper of the night. \n“Huge goal at a key time,” Sharks coach Peter DeBoer said. “You’re heading into the final five minutes and you know they’re going to make a push. The two or three shifts prior to the goal we really kept our foot on the gas. We didn’t sit back and wait for something bad to happen. That set the goal for a big goal by a great player.” \nAnaheim, the two-time defending Pacific Division champion, lost its opening game for the eighth time in nine seasons. \nMarleau narrowly missed a hat trick late in the period on San Jose’s first and only power play. \n“Our line had a lot of chances early on and finally got that first one,” said Marleau, who played alongside center Logan Couture and Ward at right wing. “It’s nice to get a couple early, something to build off of.” \nMarleau broke the scoreless duel between Jones and Anaheim’s Frederik Andersen with his first goal of the season just 38.1 seconds before the second intermission. \nMarleau had partially fanned on a setup from Couture moments earlier. But Marleau got a second chance in the slot and buried a wrist shot over the right shoulder of Andersen. \nThe goal snapped a string of close calls for both teams. Marleau had a chance earlier in the period when he streaked down the right wing boards and into the slot only to be denied by Andersen. \nAnaheim’s best chance of the period came during a 2-on-1, but center Ryan Kesler kept the puck until he was behind the goal line. The puck slipped behind Jones, who had lost his stick, but continued harmlessly across the crease with 3:30 remaining in the period. \nThe Sharks got stronger as the game wore on as DeBoer continued to play four lines equally just as he did during Wednesday’s opening win in Los Angeles. \n“That’s a big strong team up front,” Jones said. “They do a good job getting in front of the net with bodies and sticks. We did a really good job boxing out. I was able to see a lot of pucks tonight.” \nBriefly: The Sharks unveiled a banner in honor of George Gund III , the team’s late original owner, during a pregame ceremony that included original head coach George Kingston . … Center Ben Smith and defenseman Dylan DeMelo were healthy scratches. \nRoss McKeon is a freelance writer.
