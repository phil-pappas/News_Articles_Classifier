Rutherford senior Sean Sullivan became the first boy in conference history to win three straight division titles as he breezed to the Colonial Division crown.\nBogota coasted to its second straight Patriot boys crown, placing runners in five of the first six positions en route to an NJIC record-low 18 points, a standard for boys and girls and the lowest score in any of the five former leagues that now make up the NJIC since the Ramsey boys won the 1977 Bergen-Passaic Scholastic meet with 16 points.\nBut perhaps the most historical feat of all was the first league title in any sport — team or individual — at Paterson Charter. Hector Cruz defeated Dwight-Englewood freshman David Khym by about 60 yards to win the Meadowlands boys race in 18:06, a personal best for Cruz on a warm day not conducive to top performances.\n\"I work hard, I stay dedicated, and I keep moving forward,\" said Cruz, who joined the small school's club team as a sophomore and became its best runner when it transitioned to varsity last year. \"I first started to run because I wanted to get in shape, but when I started working out, I did well so I kept working at it.\"\nCruz's performance was somewhat of a surprise. He had lost to multiple runners from Hasbrouck Heights and Saddle Brook at Garret during the dual-meet season that ended last week. He also finished fourth just two days earlier in the Varsity B meet at the Garret Invitational, which turned out to be the perfect preparation for Monday's win.\n\"I'm excited about winning and I'm looking forward to the rest of the season and moving forward some more,\" Cruz said.\nDwight-Englewood, with two freshmen finishing in the top six, held off Hasbrouck Heights, 41-52, to repeat as Meadowlands champ.\nSullivan's third straight win, in the day's fastest time of 16:47, was by 150 yards over Glen Rock's Owen Davitt and had the Rutherford standout looking ahead.\n\"I sort of had the choice to go after the school record here or at Darlington [in the Bergen County championships] and decided to just try and win today,\" Sullivan said. \"I have a lot of important meets coming over the next few weeks.\"\nLyndhurst, after losing many of its runners to graduation, edged Glen Rock, 54-56, for the Colonial title.\nBogota continued its fine season with an easy victory in the Patriot Division as Dan Daurio and James Draney finished one-two. The Bucs' fourth and fifth runners, Ryan White and Cole Geraghty, had season-best times.\nAlex Walter and Jane Burgoyne finished one-two in Colonial Division girls as Glen Rock held off a balanced Garfield effort to win its second straight title, 51-61. Walter's 20:45 was about 35 yards ahead of Burgoyne, whom coach Stacie Gallo called \"the hardest worker she's ever had.\" Burgoyne responded by running 20:54, a personal best at Garret.\nHasbrouck Heights won its first Meadowlands Division title since 2011, placing five runners in the top seven behind an excellent performance by Hailey Ross, the winner in 21:20.\nThe Patriot girls race, the final varsity event of the day, went to Park Ridge/Emerson, its first title since 2010, and Veronica Dunphy of Cresskill had the individual victory when the first girl across the line, Palisades Park senior Arianna Lopez, was disqualified. Lopez and runners from Cresskill and Park Ridge/Emerson did not follow the proper course.\nLopez, who finished first by about 100 yards, had weaved inside the large tree that serves as the guidepost for the final 150-yard sprint to the finish. The fence that usually runs from the tree to the finish line and protects the runners from spectators was down because of a Sunday festival, and Lopez was confused by the cones that served as the replacement, and a festival trailer that appeared to block the normal path.\nOfficials concluded that the pre-race instructions were appropriate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:31:57.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
