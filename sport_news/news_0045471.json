Voting begins Friday at 4:30 p.m. and ends Saturday, October 31 at 11:59 p.m. The three name options are Pirogue, Cocodril and Chompitoulas.\nYou can cast your vote by completing a form at Audubon Aquarium of the Americas or click here .\nState wildlife agents found the alligator six years ago. Since then, it's been living on the West Bank at the Freeport-McMoRan Audubon Species Survival Center, a private facility.\nAudubon's white alligators are leucistic, having a rare genetic condition that reduces the color pigmentation in their skin. Out of the population of 5 million American alligators, there are thought to be less than 15 gators that have this condition. As with all white animals, they are very vulnerable to the sun and predators.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
