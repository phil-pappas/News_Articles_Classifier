It was a moving experience for Jason Garrett. And now, the Cowboys coach is going to share that with his team.\nOn Friday, two days before the Cowboys face the Giants in a critical NFC East clash, Garrett will remove his team from its normal pregame preparation schedule to give them an experience that he called \"fantastic.\"\nThe Cowboys will spend Friday night in New York City, having dinner at One World Observatory in the World Trade Center, part of a visit to Ground Zero.\n\"I was there this summer with my wife,\" said Garrett, who was living in New York during the tragedy of 9-11. \"I wasn't there 10 minutes (when) I turned to my wife and said somehow, someway, we have to bring our team here. I think it's life-changing in so many different ways.\"\nMYERS: FIVE THINGS GIANTS MUST DO TO SAVE SEASON\nThe Freedom Tower opened to the public earlier this year and was instantly hailed as a triumph for a city that had been scarred 14 years ago.\n\"It was a significant tragedy in our country's history,\" Garrett said of 9-11. \"I feel like they captured it so well, not only the tragedy, but the response that everybody in New York and the surrounding areas and throughout our country had to this tragedy . . . You feel the tragedy but you also feel the response and the resiliency of our country as manifested by our country.\"\nJulio Cortez/AP Cowboys head coach Jason Garrett (l.), seen here with Giants counterpart Tom Coughlin in 2014, is having his team leave for New York to make a special trip to Ground Zero. So a plan was hatched, and the Cowboys' visit to East Rutherford was highlighted. Dallas is coming off a bye week, so Garrett didn't mind taking the team out of its typical weekly routine.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\nNormally, the Cowboys would make the trip north a day before the game. Instead, they will depart their Valley Ranch training facility after practice Friday afternoon to arrive in New York Friday evening. On Saturday, they will hold walkthroughs at the team hotel, then work through their brief on-field practice at a local high school.\nIt's a drastic departure from the norm for a Cowboys team that's dropped three straight, but Garrett believes it will be worthwhile. He likened it to team dinner he'd scheduled last year in London, before the Cowboys faced Jacksonville. The Cowboys closed the regular season by winning six of seven after that bonding experience.\n\"It was a really great evening for our team,\" Garrett said of the dinner in London. \"Unifying in so many different ways. And we feel like this can have the same kind of an impact.\"\nRelated Stories Mets manager responds to just one of Tom Coughlin's texts Tom Coughlin rips players, singling out Moore, after loss Daniel Fells gets great welcome home from his kids Tags: jason garrett , dallas cowboys", "external_links": ["http://facebook.com/nydnsports"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:13:29.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
