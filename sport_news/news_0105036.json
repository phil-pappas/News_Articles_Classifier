We beat FC Barcelona and Chelsea, and all the European clubs have that in mind.\"\nPSG enjoyed 60 percent of the ball on Wednesday but that did not translate to more scoring opportunities as Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Edinson Cavani and Angel Di Maria failed to ignite.\n\"All your players need to be at the top of their game if you want to compete with one of Europe's finest teams,\" said Blanc.\n\"The aim for the club remains to win the Champions League, but you have to remember the project is only four years old.\"\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:18:20.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
