(AP) - Officials say a Massachusetts family is receiving a bill after a mountain rescue in New Hampshire.\nWMUR-TV reports the Fish and Game Department says 36-year-old Andrew Tippit, of Rochdale, Massachusetts, was rescued with his family Friday evening on the Percy Peak Trail in Nash Stream State Forest. The department says the family was aware of the rainy weather and did not plan on being out after dark.\nOfficials said in a statement the family did not have a Hike Safe Card, which exempts the holder from certain search and rescue costs due to negligence. They also did not have state hunting or fishing licenses.\nThe department averages about 180 search and rescue missions each year. It can pursue reimbursement for rescue costs if the person rescued acted negligently.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
