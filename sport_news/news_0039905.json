East Coweta, Westlake and Newnan are in a three-way tie for second and South Cobb, Pebblebrook and Douglas County are in a three-way tie for third. The Eagles will have a hard time moving up in the region standings if they don’t cut down on the penalties. They committed 13 for 125 yards last Friday, and that played a huge role in handing Douglas County its first win. South Cobb was constantly finding itself in second-and-25 or third-and-25 situations, making it difficult to score. “We have to cut down on the double-digit penalties for triple-digit yardage,” South Cobb coach Sherrod Rainge said. “Our defense has kept us in games. We just have to find a way to get the ball into the end zone, whether it be running, passing or screen-passing.”South Cobb is also addressing special teams play in getting ready for Langston Hughes.The Eagles had issues with its punt team last Friday. They had a botched punt that Douglas County returned for a 50-yard touchdown. Another punting miscue put Douglas County on the South Cobb 6-yard line, resulting in another touchdown. “We gave up 21 points on the punt team alone, and that’s an area that you really don’t think about as much,” Rainge said. “But every aspect of the game is important.The Eagles seem to be moving forward in running the football, totaling 172 yards from the ground last week. Newly converted quarterback Michael Lapeyrolerie and Trevon Vance combined for 152 of them.Rainge said South Cobb wasn’t always comfortable running the ball early in the season with the offensive line being young and inexperienced, but the team has made strides since.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:11:08.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
