UAlbany football faces pivotal home game 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Albany\nPeople can disagree over whether they want to continue calling the University at Albany football facility \" Bob Ford Field \" or go with the brand-new \"Casey Stadium\" instead.\nWhatever the name, the Great Danes are facing a home game on Saturday that could determine the direction of the rest of their season.\n\"I think most definitely it's going to,\" head coach Greg Gattuso said.\nTrying to rebound from a humbling loss at Holy Cross, UAlbany returns to action against Maine in a Colonial Athletic Association contest at 3:30 p.m.\nIt's the first game for the Great Danes (2-3 overall, 1-1 league) since the football stadium was named after Tom and Mary Casey of Albany in return for a $10 million gift from a foundation established by their daughter and son-in-law. The artificial-turf field remains dedicated to Ford, the longtime UAlbany coach, which it has been since the $18 million venue opened two years ago.\nThe Great Danes were manhandled 37-0 by Holy Cross last week. Gattuso and players said the team has responded positively in practice, but Saturday will reveal how much they've really recovered from that beating.\n\"We have a lot to prove this week, what our character is like as a team,\" freshman linebacker Julian Cox said. \"We took a very big loss. Now we're in conference play and we have to win. We know that.\"\nThey're meeting an opponent that UAlbany has enjoyed success against over the years, even when the Great Danes were in the inferior Northeast Conference. UAlbany is 5-3 against Maine all-time, most recently a 20-7 victory in Orono last season. They've met the past six years in a row with the Great Danes prevailing four times.\n\"Ever since I've been here, we've been playing Maine very hard,\" junior left tackle Kevin Malloy said. \"It's kind of like we're almost rivals with them. I think the younger guys know that and they're going to step up this week.\"\nGattuso said he doesn't think past success against Maine (1-3, 1-1) is as significant for the Great Danes as being on their home field, where they're 2-0 this season with victories over Rhode Island and Duquesne.\n\"The most important thing for us right now is getting at home in front of a good crowd and coming out with energy,\" Gattuso said. \"The crowd will give us some. That's going to help us more than whoever the opponent would be. I'm happy we have a couple of home games to try and get ourselves righted.\"\nThe Great Danes face Villanova at Casey Stadium next Saturday.\nMaine is coming off a 48-17 loss at Richmond in which the Black Bears played both junior Dan Collins and sophomore Drew Belcher at quarterback. Gattuso said they're very similar players, though Collins is the better runner.\nGattuso said sophomore D.J. Crook is still his starting quarterback, even though Crook was benched at halftime against Holy Cross in favor of freshman Neven Sussman .\n\"It hurt, but that's just something to motivate me,\" Crook said. \"Work harder. I've got to do my job better. I wasn't playing to my potential. That was really a bummer. I'm with Coach Gattuso 100 percent.\"\nGattuso said he plans to use freshman tailback Elijah Ibitokun-Hanks more on Saturday to reduce the wear on freshman Elliot Croskey of CBA, who has rushed 100 times for 385 yards and three touchdowns this season.\nmsingelais@timesunion.com • 518-454-5509 • @MarkSingelais", "external_links": ["http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/31/8754777/9/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/31/8754777/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/31/31/8754777/9/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:19:06.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
