He's young, sublimely talented, has a cannon for an arm and is one of the best power hitters in the game. Most of the dream relied on the idea that the Marlins would eventually balk at the mega-deal that it would take to lock up Stanton long-term. \nMiami, it turns out, was willing to put their money down for Stanton, inking him to a 13-year, $325 million deal . \nAs of now, Stanton's not going anywhere. But it turns out that the Stanton Dream wasn't as farfetched as some may have thought. \nAccording to ESPN Boston's Gordon Edes , the Marlins would've \"seriously considered\" a deal that sent Stanton to Boston, with one catch: Xander Bogaerts would have to be part of the trade. \nFrom Edes: \"The talks never gained traction, the source said, because the Marlins insisted that shortstop Xander Bogaerts be part of the return. There was no point in talking further, the Marlins said, unless the Sox included Bogaerts. They had similar conversations with the Baltimore Orioles. You want Stanton, you need to give us Manny Machado. \nAny time the Red Sox checked in subsequently, the Marlins' message was the same. And as much as the Red Sox coveted Stanton, Bogaerts was a price they were not going to pay.\" \nThe Red Sox have known for years that they've had a budding star on their hands with Bogaerts, and that patience has finally started to pay off in 2015. The 20-year-old shortshop has made huge strides since breaking into the majors. He's currently tied for the MLB lead in hits a 194 and has gone from a liability at shortstop to one of the better defenders at the position, according to multiple advanced metrics. \nA deal to acquire Stanton, though, would've required a return of more than just Bogaerts. With the Red Sox's prize prospect as the centerpiece, the team would've had to throw in some other promising players to cap off the deal, some of which could've been one of the system's gems (like -- gasp -- Mookie Betts). \nSo far, it's worked out for both sides. The Marlins have a franchise cornerstone in Stanton. Meanwhile, the Red Sox have a talented crop of young players to build around.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:49:44.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
