Courtesy of Burt Lovejoy i Order Reprint of this Story \nA member of the walking dead has vanished from a west Pasco yard. \nThe zombie skeleton that welcomes visitors to the Lovejoy home went missing this week. But family members don’t believe he walked away on his own. \n“We believe he was stolen Monday night,” Rachel Lovejoy said. “We have so much stuff in our yard, we didn’t notice him missing right away.” \nThe loss is hardly a zombie apocalypse for the family decorations. A cemetery is in the front yard, and severed heads are impaled on the fence. Some larger items, such as fog machines and automated props, are saved for Halloween night. \nBut the zombie has sentimental value. The family worked for hours on the skeleton, melting plastic sheets on it to make it different shades of brown, Lovejoy said. \nMaking the loss tougher for Rachel and her husband, Burt, has been explaining it to their daughters, ages 6 and 3. Rachel Lovejoy said they just don’t understand. \nWe really just want him back. \nRachel Lovejoy, Pasco zombie owner \nA Facebook post about the theft was shared 230 times by Thursday in hopes of helping to track down the zombie thief. \nBurt Lovejoy tried to notify police, but ended up leaving the station after waiting for an hour, he said. \n“The police department was less than helpful, to say the least,” he said. \nThe family is offering a $50 reward for the zombie’s safe return. It also can be dropped off in the Lovejoys’ front yard in Montgomery Estates, no questions asked. \n“We really just want him back,” Rachel Lovejoy said. \nThe family’s neighborhood typically sees 100 trick-or-treaters on Halloween. Rachel Lovejoy said no one has complained about their gruesome creation. \n“We’ve never had any problems,” she said. “We’ve had nothing but compliments on our yard.” \nGeoff Folsom: 509-582-1543; gfolsom@tricityherald.com ; Twitter: @GeoffFolsom Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:00:58.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
