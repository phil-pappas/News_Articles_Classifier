Two other misdemeanor domestic violence charges were dismissed. \nSapp also has to stay away from the victim, prosecutor Lisa Luzaich said. He faces six months in jail if he violates terms of the deal. \nSapp, who played defensive tackle, was charged in June with arguing with the woman and pulling her arm or purse in an April incident at the M Resort in Henderson , and knocking the woman down a short time later at her Las Vegas condominium. The woman told police she ended up on the floor and thought she may have suffered a concussion when Sapp stepped on the right side of her face. \nThe accusation came just months after Sapp was fired as an on-air analyst for the NFL Network after a Feb. 2 arrest in Phoenix for assaulting and soliciting a prostitute during Super Bowl weekend. \nELSEWHERE \nNew college bowl game in Tucson \nA new bowl game is coming to Arizona Stadium this December. \nThe Arizona Bowl will feature teams from Conference USA , the Sun Belt or Mountain West Conference (of which San Jose State is a member) on Dec. 29 at Arizona’s home stadium. It will be the first bowl game in Tucson since 1999. \nThe addition of the Arizona Bowl brings the total to a record 41 bowl games this season, meaning nearly two-thirds of FBS teams will play in bowl games. \nThe NCAA certified three new bowls in May, in Arizona, Orlando and Austin, Texas. Austin bowl officials decided not to start their bowl this season. \nNBA : A former Milwaukee Bucks cheerleader has sued the team, saying the flat-rate pay system dancers work under leaves them earning far less than minimum wage. \nThe lawsuit is believed to be the first of its kind on behalf of dancers against an NBA franchise, and it comes after several similar filings against NFL teams recently. \nLead plaintiff Lauren Herington says she and others haven’t been fairly compensated for games, practices, team functions or photo shoots. She also says the team’s appearance policy required mandatory workouts, regular salon visits and tanning sessions, for which the dancers weren’t reimbursed. \nNHL: The Minnesota Wild claimed left wing Chris Porter off waivers from Philadelphia. \nGolf: Jimmy Mullen and Paul Dunne both marked their professional debuts with an 8-under 64 to grab a share of the lead after the first round of the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship at St. Andrews, Scotland. \nTennis: Venus Williams advanced to the semifinals of the Wuhan Open in China by beating Johanna Konta of Britain 6-4, 3-6, 7-5. It was her 701st career victory. Latest videos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:25:33.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
