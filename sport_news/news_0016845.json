Right now, he just doesn’t get it. Over the past two weeks, on different continents, he has played and scored in two Premier League games for Arsenal and played and scored in two World Cup qualifiers for Chile. While diminutive in stature at 5 foot 6 and 136 pounds, he is immense in spirit and skills. It is the size of his heart and the depth of his desire that persuade managers to be reckless with his health. “Alexis is relentless going forward,” Arsenal Manager Arsène Wenger said on Saturday after his winger returned from South America with just enough time to take part in one short practice before the game against Watford. “I worried about him because he has a hip rotator muscle problem,” Wenger said. “But there are periods when a player is in a scoring moment — and to interrupt this can sometimes disturb the flow.” Wenger, who has managed Arsenal since 1996, struggled to think of any other player with such contagious enthusiasm as Sánchez. To give you a sense of his exhaustive schedule, here is Sánchez’s output since the beginning of the month: Oct. 4: Sánchez sparks a 3-0 win at home over Manchester United, scoring twice and looking peeved when Wenger substituted him because of clear signs of that hip injury. Oct. 9: Scores for Chile in a 2-0 World Cup qualifier over Brazil in Santiago, Chile. Oct. 14: Scores twice and sets up another goal for Eduardo Vargas in Chile’s 4-3 win over Peru in another World Cup qualifier in Lima, Peru. Oct. 17: Scores the opening goal to break Watford’s resistance in a 3-0 away win that keeps Arsenal in second place in the Premier League. We won’t dwell on the 17,000 frequent flier miles he has accrued, the changes in time zones and climates he has endured, or the time he has spent on the treatment table between training sessions. We also won’t dwell on Arsenal’s concern over a player who has spent the last two summers playing in major international tournaments in South America, first the World Cup in Brazil in 2014 and then the Copa América this year, which Chile won on home soil. And maybe, if nobody tells him there are physical and mental limits to how many games a body can take, Sánchez won’t pause to consider what his breaking point is. There is, after all, a must-win game for Arsenal this Tuesday in the Champions League as it takes on Bayern Munich. “I don’t know if there is any reason to change the team,” Wenger mused Saturday night. “Maybe Alexis or Mesut Ozil could take a rest.” Maybe not, in the case of the relentless Chilean. The danger of interrupting the flow — as Wenger put it — is that he could tamper with someone who has proved to be a true game winner, someone whose running almost embarrasses his teammates into playing at his same level. Years back, the Germans referred to an Englishman, Kevin Keegan, as “Mighty Mouse” because of his small stature and huge running skills. Sánchez is the Chilean version of Keegan, and his club and national team need every ounce that he is willing to give. \nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T16:39:59.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
