Today, the Tigers (13-6, 4-4 West Coast Conference) return to the road to play Santa Clara (15-5, 6-2) at 6 p.m. at the Leavey Center. On Saturday, Pacific heads north to start the second half of WCC play at 1 p.m. against USF (15-6, 2-6) at War Memorial Gymnasium. In their five-game win against the Gaels, coach Greg Gibbons made a move that he hoped would improve his team’s production at opposite hitter. Junior Alicja Wilk moved from middle blocker to the right side and gave her team a career-best 15 kills on 34 swings with six digs in Pacific’s come-from-behind 22-25, 25-15, 21-25, 25-22, 16-14 victory. The Tigers had nice balance, as Lexi Elman had a match-high 19 kills, with Kimmy Whitson and Maycie LaBass each finishing with 12 kills. Whitson, Pacific’s senior setter and captain, nearly had a triple-double with 43 assists and eight digs to go with her 12 kills. The Gaels had 30 block assists and 19 total team blocks, but the Tigers persevered and earned a much-needed win. The Tigers enter today’s match tied with Pepperdine for fifth place in the WCC, while the Broncos are a game behind No. 12 BYU (17-2, 7-1) and San Diego (13-6, 7-1), who are tied for first. Santa Clara handed BYU its only loss in conference play, a four-game decision on Sept. 26 and have since won five of six. The Broncos are coming off a five-game loss last Saturday at Loyola Marymount (15-6, 5-3). Nikki Hess leads Santa Clara and is fourth in the conference with 4.14 kills per set, and Jensen Cunningham is third in the WCC with 1.21 kills per set. Elman leads the conference with 4.88 kills per set, and Whitson is third in the WCC in assists with 10.75 per set.
