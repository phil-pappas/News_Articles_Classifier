Akeil Barrett and Miguel Gallardo made sure their team wasn’t going out. \nComing off the bench at halftime, Barrett forced a game-tying penalty kick and scored the game-winning goal as the Armada held off FC Edmonton in a wild 3-2 clash at the Baseball Grounds. \nGoalkeeper Gallardo preserved the victory with a string of diving saves in the last 20 minutes, clinching a win that ranks among the season’s high points. \n“One thing that’s identified this team is that we never give up,” Gallardo said. “We always keep fighting.” \nGuinean center forward Alhassane Keita snapped his two-month scoring drought before being red-carded shortly after halftime, leaving the Armada to fight on for 40 minutes with 10 men. \nThe Armada’s chances of reaching the North American Soccer League playoffs remain slim, but for one more week they’re alive and kicking. \nReinforcements boosted the Armada against Edmonton (7-8-4), as Shawn Nicklaw was back from World Cup qualifying in Turkmenistan and Haitians Pascal Millien and Mechack Jerome also were back after international duty. \nThey helped an Armada defense that dominated possession, swallowing Edmonton’s attacks and pinning the Canadian club deep. \nJaime Castrillon came close with a pair of close-range shots in the first half, but in spite of constant dribbling surges from Keita, the Armada (5-9-3) needed 30 minutes to break through. \nKeita dribbled inside from the right, traded short passes with Jemal Johnson, continued his diagonal run into the penalty area and finished past Edmonton goalkeeper Matt VanOekel from 10 yards. \nThe goal was Keita’s seventh of the season and his first since Aug. 8 against the Tampa Bay Rowdies. \nThen, five minutes after halftime, Keita’s night turned upside down. \nYellow-carded in the first half for a foul on Eddie Edward, Keita lunged in late on Cristian Raudales and referee Daniel Fitzgerald immediately pulled out his red card — the club’s ninth ejection of the season. \nThe undermanned Armada conceded goals from Edmonton’s Daryl Fordyce and Sainey Nyassi in the 62nd and 66th minutes, setting up a result that would have officially eliminated Jacksonville. \nJust when the Armada’s night looked sunk, though, Barrett turned the tide. The Jamaican dashed into the box, ran into the challenge of Johann Smith, and referee Fitzgerald pointed to the penalty spot. Millien struck the penalty low to the left corner to tie the score. \nThen, two minutes later, Johnson’s long-range shot caromed off an Edmonton defender and bounced loose. There, free in the box, was Barrett. \n“Just kick it hard to the far post,” Barrett said. “That was my aim.” \nGallardo then weathered a full-scale Edmonton bombardment in the closing minutes, denying several close-range scoring chances. \nThe Armada has little time to relax, with the first-place Ottawa Fury coming to the Baseball Grounds Wednesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:12:52.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
