Bass Jr. was scheduled to begin closing arguments at 1 p.m.\nBefore closing his case this morning, attorney Tom Withers, representing 45-year-old Corizon nurse Gregory Brown, presented four character witnesses.\nAttorney Willie Yancey II, who represents former deputy Jason Kenny, closed without presenting any witnesses.\nBass has taken under advisement several motions for directed verdicts of acquittal and was expected to rule before jurors returned for closing arguments.\nFormer deputies Kenny and Maxine Evans along with Brown are charged in the death of Ajibade, 21, at the Chatham County jail late Jan. 1 or early Jan. 2.\nKenny, 31, and Evans, 56 face charges of involuntary of manslaughter in Ajibade’s death. Bass yesterday directed a verdict of acquittal of Brown for that charge, but he remains in the case on charges of public records fraud and making a false statement to investigators.\nAll three pleaded not guilty.\nYesterday, Evans testified she was truthful during her interviews with investigators in the wake of Ajibade’s death even if her responses were not always consistent.\n“I may have made some misstatements,” Evans testified about her recollection of how many times deputies looked in on Ajibade as he sat in a restraining chair. “I was truthful as to how I remembered it.”\nShe said her testimony to the Chatham County grand jury in June was from her memory, adding she was as truthful as she could be.\n“Were you reckless that night?” defense attorney Bobby Phillips asked.\n“No, sir, I was not,” Evans replied.\n“Did you cause his death?”\n“No, sir, I didn’t.”\nEvans also told jurors that Ajibade’s death “bothered me for a long time, and I still think about it.”\nEvans’ election to take the witness stand opened her to cross examination by Assistant District Attorney Matt Breedon, who questioned Evans about her seven statements to Georgia Bureau of Investigation agents, sheriff’s internal affairs investigators and the grand jury in the case.\nProsecutors contend Ajibade was left in the restraining chair in a holding cell at 11:47 p.m. Jan. 1, then ignored between 12:09 a.m. Jan. 2 and 1:38 a.m. when Evans found him unresponsive.\nBreedon repeatedly challenged Evans about seven statements and the five checks listed on a restraint chair log Evans generated.\n“I generated the log prematurely because I knew one had to be done,” Evans testified.\n“Which one of these seven different statements is true?” Breedon asked.\n“He was checked (five times). The times don’t coincide with checks that were made,” Evans responded. “The checks were done. The times may be inaccurate.”\nBefore resting yesterday morning, prosecutors presented an audio interview of Evans with internal affairs officers in which she told them she “estimated” hours in which Ajibade was checked on in the restraining chair.\n“You didn’t lie about it...but this document is falsified,” Deputy Cpl. Rick Hall told Evans.\n“I estimated, I didn’t say I did the actual checks,” Evans responded. “I just estimated.”\n“You didn’t actually perform these checks even though you listed it on an official document,” Hall said.\nKenny and Evans are on trial for involuntary manslaughter for causing Ajibade’s death “without any intention to do so.” The charge said that Kenny caused the death during the commission of “reckless conduct...without intention to do so by tasing (Ajibade) while he was restrained.”\nEvans is charged with reckless conduct by failing to monitor Ajibade’s status.\nIn addition, both are charged in two separate indictments with committing perjury before the Chatham County grand jury that was hearing the case in what the state contends was part of an attempt to cover up their involvement in the death.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14033157_4.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/ajibade_3_1_0_1_3.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14766969_3_1.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14033157_4.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14766969_3_1.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/ajibade_3_1_0_1_3.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14033152_3.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14033152_3.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:04:03.275+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
