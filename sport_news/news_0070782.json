We did a lot of bad things, but we found a way. That's what this league's all about. \n\"We certainly hope that it's a huge wave of momentum for us now that we're heading back home and going against a real good football team. I'm not going to think about Denver for a while. To me, we talk about mental toughness and character and staying together, and those aren't just words. That's easy to say and harder to do. \n\"When things weren't going well defensively, and they were going up and down the field, there was no grumbling. Guys weren't turning on each other. The offense was like, 'Hey, more TV time for us,' so we were right back out there with more opportunities. From the mental toughness standpoint, I always talk about the rollercoaster emotions of an NFL game, and this one would be a hell of a ride at Cedar Point. I could tell you that.\" \nThe Browns trailed the Ravens, 14-3, late in the first quarter, but from that point until midway through the fourth quarter, Cleveland scored 20 of the next 27 points. Unlike last week's loss to the San Diego Chargers, the Browns found a way to answer the opposition's scores with their own points. \nUntil Justin Tucker's game-tying kick in the final minute of regulation, the Browns answered each of Baltimore's second-half scoring drives with points. \n\"I thought our guys just hung in there, and that's what this game is,\" Pettine said. \"We were on the short end and have been on the short end of those types of games, and today, we found a way to make more plays than they did at the end. \n\"On Wednesday, we talked about it being a division game, how important it was. We talked about the history of it. I thought from then on, our guys practiced with good energy, good focus, and that's one thing that I think that we're doing a good job this year. We're practicing well. We've had one practice which I would consider a clunker a couple weeks ago, but other than that, we go out, we're productive, very few mistakes. We're not repeating a lot of plays. We're sharp. We're getting finished under the time we allot for it. It's efficient, and I'm just glad we got rewarded for it.\" \nBrowns quarterback Josh McCown added, \"We talked about responding. We talked about (how) half the league loses every weekend, but we were going to be the team that responded the best, and so, I think we were all in agreement that that was a pretty good response, and so, for me, individually, (I'm) humbled and proud to be a part of that group because there's a lot of high-character men in there, and when you do what we did these last seven, 10 days, it's special, and it's something you always remember.\" \nSince the Browns returned to the NFL in 1999, they had beaten the Ravens just eight times in 32 tries. Only three of those wins came in Baltimore, where they had lost all but one of their games at the Ravens since the end of the 2002 season. \nHowever, with the win, the Browns started off AFC North play with a victory for the first time since 2004, and recorded their first overtime win since the last time they won in Baltimore, also by a 33-30 count, on November 18, 2007. \n\"When you're sitting at 2-3, you're looking for everything you can to give you momentum,\" McCown said. \"We've got a tough stretch coming. That's a very good Denver defense and Denver football team coming to Cleveland. We need all hands on deck. We need everybody to come and make that as rowdy and tough a place to play as we can, and we've got to go out and get after them.\" \nDefensive lineman Desmond Bryant added, \"T o overcome all the adversity that we faced in the game, I told the guys that this was the greatest kind of win in my opinion. We have that fight in us. There are some dogs out there willing to put it all on the line. We got punched in the mouth early, but we recovered from that, and we were able to finish the game, and there was nothing better than that. \n\"The way I look at it, we just entered the second quarter of the season. The first quarter didn't go the way we wanted it to. You don't win the game or lose the game in the first quarter, so this was a great start to the second quarter. We've got a long road ahead of us. Denver's not going to come in next week and lay down. We've got a lot of work to do, but this was a great stepping stone to that.\" \nFollowing the season-opening loss to the New York Jets, veteran defensive back Tramon Williams said several of his teammates were hanging their heads in defeat when the Jets began stringing together good plays. However, in last week's loss to San Diego, Williams saw a different group of players, ones who believed victory was possible. \nOn Sunday, the Browns got over that emotional hurdle of fighting but coming up short. \n\"We all came together as brothers,\" second-year wide receiver Taylor Gabriel said. \"We could feel it on the sideline, everybody wanted to win and get the divisional win. We were always one play away. There were big catches, big plays by the offense, and the defense stepped up as well. We all came together and got the win.\" \nVeteran linebacker Karlos Dansby added, \n\"I think we did what we had to do to get the win. Whatever was necessary, we did it. A couple guys made some sacrifices and we got off the field when we needed to get off the field. We stood up when we had to. When our backs were against the wall, we stood up and made plays to give our offense an opportunity.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RC2T3r TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:21:03.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
