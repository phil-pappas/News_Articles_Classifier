It means the effort, in this case the United States’ campaign to get to the 2016 Summer Olympics, wasn’t necessarily good enough, but it wasn’t necessarily too poor, either. At least not yet. “We had five games, four wins, and right in the most important game, we were not really prepared because we were not good enough,” U.S. Under-23 head coach Andi Herzog told SI.com on Tuesday. “It’s a little bit disappointing, but in the end, we’re still alive and now we have to beat Colombia.”\nThe U.S. beat Canada, 2-0 , in the CONCACAF Men's Olympic Qualifying Championship third-place game after losing by the same score to Honduras in the semifinals three days earlier. The win ensures the U.S. has one last opportunity to qualify for Rio 2016, by winning a home-and-away playoff against Colombia during the March 21-29, 2016, FIFA international window.\nMORE: Olympic qualifying playoff changed to two-game series The Americans breezed through the group stage in CONCACAF, defeating Canada, Cuba and Panama by a combined score of 13-2. They looked set for their first Olympic qualification since Beijing 2008 but instead fell to a Honduran side headed to its second successive Olympics.\nPlanet Futbol USA U-23s keep Olympic dream alive, beat Canada to reach playoff by Liviu Bird", "external_links": ["http://facebook.com/liviubird", "http://twitter.com/liviubird"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:03:47.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
