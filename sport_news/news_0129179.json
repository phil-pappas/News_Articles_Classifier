Niesen couldn't say Monday when the examination of whether there is a case will be concluded.\nGerman weekly Der Spiegel alleged Friday a slush fund of 10.3 million Swiss francs (about $6 million at that time) was set up to buy the votes of four Asian representatives on FIFA's executive committee.\nThe German football federation vehemently rejects the allegations. Bid committee chief Franz Beckenbauer says he never had money given to anyone to buy votes.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
