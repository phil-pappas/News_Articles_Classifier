The Pats have won the division 12 times in head coach Bill Belichick's 15 seasons up there. There's also the not-insignificant fact that they're the defending Super Bowl champs. \nIt will feel unfamiliar because of the sound of silence now emanating all week from One Jets Drive. Where ex-Jets head coach Rex Ryan once made Patriots Week a hypepathon, current head coach Todd Bowles and the Jets are approaching this one like any other date on the calendar. The Jets are boring, everyone. But, so far, they're successful and boring. \nThat the 4-1 Jets can pull even with the Pats in the division is also somewhat unfamiliar ground. For all of Ryan's bluster, his teams missed the playoffs the last four seasons and went 1-7 against the Pats. \nBut for as familiar as the Pats seem, let's take a look under the hood at this year's version to see what the Jets are up against on Sunday. \n1. They're still the Patriots. Which means they still have quarterback Tom Brady, which means their offense is still the best in the league. Brady is 38, but you wouldn't know it. He's completed 70.6 percent of his passes, thrown 14 touchdowns against just one interception. Oddly, Brady's Total QBR (73.2) ranks sixth in the league, behind even Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick (76.6.). \n2. How good is their offense? They're first in offensive DVOA (32.8 percent), second in pass offense DVOA (52.4 percent), and first in rush offense DVOA (16.6 percent). The Pats are also first in third-down conversions (51 percent), second in red-zone percentage (73.91 percent), and third in yards per play (6.4). In conclusion, the offense is damn good. Same as it ever was. \n3. Dion Lewis? Really? Lewis, the 5-foot-8, 195-pound running back, was out of the league last year after missing 2013 with a broken leg. Yet, he's just another player the Patriots have plugged into their system and gotten production from: 5.0 yards per carry running the ball, plus 26 catches for 256 yards and a touchdown. Lewis is also one of those small, shifty backs who's dangerous in space—exactly the sort of matchup problem the Eagles exploited against the Jets' linebackers in Week 3. He had been limited last week by abdominal injury, though. \n4. Not so great against the run. The Patriots' defense is a bit shaky, especially against the run; per Football Outsiders, their team DVOA against the run (0.5 percent) ranks 29th. Oh, and look: The Jets, led by running back Chris Ivory, lead the league with an average of 146 rushing yards per game, with Ivory racking up 5.5 yards per carry. \n5. Thin at tackle. Because of injuries, the Patriots have just two healthy offensive tackles: Sebastian Vollmer—their usual right tackle—and Cameron Fleming, who had only come off the practice squad on Saturday. Starting left tackle Nate Solder is out for the year with a torn bicep, and his backup, Marcus Cannon, injured a toe Sunday night at the Colts, though it's not yet known whether than injury will keep Cannon out of Sunday's game against the Jets. PLUS: Brandon Marshall says he was nearly flagged for flag after TD \n6. Thin at corner. With Tarell Brown, their No. 2 corner, now on injured reserve (foot), the Pats have just four healthy cornerbacks: Malcolm Butler, Logan Ryan, Justin Coleman, and Rashaan Melvin. \n7. Matthew Slater hurt, too. Slater, the Patriots' gunner and all-around special teams ace, hurt his knee against the Colts, but the Boston Herald reported Tuesday that he walked without a noticeable limp or the aid of crutches. His status for Sunday will obviously be determined as the week progresses. Why is this a big deal? The Jets have allowed 75 points, but their special teams has accounted for 14 of them, thanks to touchdowns on a punt return and a blocked punt. \n8. This, per Kim Jones of NFL Media. It doesn't have any bearing on the eventual outcome of Sunday's game. but still: NYJ have NFL's #1 ranked total & scoring D. Tom Brady is 6-0 in his career facing such defenses this late in the season (13 TD, 5 INT). — Kimberly Jones (@KimJonesSports) October 21, 2015 \n9. Any kind of Deflategate hangover for Brady? Nope. Here's Belichick on that very topic: \"Tom always prepares hard, always works hard, always tries to do his best on the practice field, preparation on Sunday. So it's been like that for 16 years.\" \n10. What about Darrelle Revis? Revis, the star cornerback whose return has transformed the Jets' defense, won a ring last year with the Patriots. Belichick was extra insightful when talking about Revis on Wednesday, and by extra insightful I mean completely and totally boring: \"He was a pleasure to coach and really has a great understanding, instinctiveness to the game, studies his opponents well, always well prepared, very professional. Obviously, he's a great player.\" Thanks, Bill! \nDom Cosentino may be reached at dcosentino@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @domcosentino .
