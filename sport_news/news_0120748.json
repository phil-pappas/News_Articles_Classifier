A dominant defensive performance. Mayberry running roughshod all over the opposition. Trujillo to Baken again. Just another week for the undefeated Demons (6-0, 1-0 Class 4A Pikes Peak League) as they clobbered the home team on its homecoming night 49-17. “It’s a little bit of extra motivation when the opponent picks you for their homecoming,” Durango head coach David Vogt said in a phone interview with The Durango Herald. “These guys just keep playing hard and not giving in to anything the other team is trying to do. They’re executing at a really high level on both sides of the ball.” The Lancers came out an inspired bunch. They marched down the field on the opening drive of its homecoming night and set up shop in the red zone. The Durango defense, as usual, wasn’t in the mood to celebrate. Liberty quarterback Hunter Wierenga lost the ball and Durango’s Jack Madden pounced on it to turn the tide early. On the ensuing drive, the first possession of the game for the Durango offense, the dynamic duo of quarterback Terrence Trujillo and wide receiver Lucas Baken connected on a 29-yard touchdown strike to give the Demons a 7-0 lead. The hookup capped off a 10-play, 82-yard drive and was the ninth time Trujillo has hit Baken for a touchdown in six games so far this season. If the usual components of the Durango assault are hitting on all cylinders, Lawrence Mayberry has to be in on the action – and he joined the fray in a big way. On the first drive of the second quarter, after a punt backed the Demons deep in their own territory, Mayberry took a hand-off from his own four-yard line and busted through the defense untouched for a 96-yard touchdown run. After another forced fumble by the Durango defense, Trujillo found Daisun Fugate in the endzone to close out a five-play, 48-yard drive with a 25-yard touchdown to extend the lead to 21-0 and the rout was on. Though Trujillo threw two interceptions late in the first half, the defense, led by Laitham Johnson, Madden, Manassah Brockus and Diego Arias wouldn’t allow the Lancers to get back in the game. Coming out of halftime leading 21-3, the defense started the second half the same way they started the first. A fumble recovery deep in Liberty’s zone led to Mayberry’s second touchdown run of the night, a 14-yard scamper from the senior that gave the Demons a 28-3 lead. A Trujillo 20-yard run in the third quarter made the score 35-3 and then came Mayberry’s third of the night, a 20-yard run that was the sixth time he’s carried the ball across the goalline in the last two weeks. “He’s just a special kid,” Vogt said of Mayberry. “The line is doing such a good job for him, and when he gets those holes he makes people miss. It’s the same old thing with him. He’s been doing it for awhile.” At 42-3, the homecoming crowd, for the most part, was sent home. After a score from Liberty (3-3, 0-1 PPL), Peyton Woolverton came in the game and found Kade Jackson on an 80-yard touchdown pass to give the Demons a 49-10 lead and rub a little salt into the wound of the home team. A late score for Liberty gave those who stayed reason to cheer, but it was too little, too late for the Lancers. Next week is the Demons’ homecoming and they’ll look to extend the winning streak to seven as they host Palmer Ridge Friday at 6 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:19:41.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
