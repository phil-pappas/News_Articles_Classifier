The opponent, whether it's the Blue Jays or Royals, won't matter. \nHarvey was slated to pitch Game 5 of the National League Championship Series but there wasn't a need for one. Asked if extra rest will benefit him now, manager Terry Collins cryptically said \"He's not going to get a lot of extra rest.\" \nCollins could also see a possibility of Harvey pitching three times in the World Series, which would likely mean as the Game 1 starter. \nDeGrom is the other option but Collins saw signs of fatigue in the starter during his outings lately. DeGrom struggled in, but won, his last two starts, which would make the manager cautious about putting the pitcher in a position to pitch three times in the World Series.

Is it going to benefit us to start him and use him three times? You've got to put them in situations where they're going to have more success. I'm not sure where we're going to go just yet. I like our rotation, no matter who's out there.\" \nIf Harvey and deGrom start Games 1 and 2, which would be in Toronto or Kansas City, then Noah Syndergaard would start Game 3 and Steven Matz in Game 4. \nCollins doesn't want to announce the rotation until the Mets know their World Series opponent. He said an ESPN report that came out Friday morning was erroneous because the team had just decided on the order. \n\"There can't be a report,\" Collins said. \"We just had a meeting five minutes ago and I'm the only guy who's got the sucker written down.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:29:00.414+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
