Kasey Kahne was second at 193.638, and Hendrick teammates Jimmie Johnson (third) and Dale Earnhardt Jr. (fifth) followed. \nMatt Kenseth was fourth. \nThe qualifying runs open the opportunity for the Hendrick drivers to draft as a group at the front early in Sunday’s race. The day is particularly important for Earnhardt Jr., who needs a win to advance to the third round of the Chase for the Sprint Cup. Dale Earnhardt Jr. remembers father's final Cup win \n“We all understand what’s at stake and what our goal and mission is,” Gordon said. “If we can stay together, we better our chances. We know what Junior has to do and what we have to do. We have four excellent race cars and four race teams to work together to make that happen. \n“We can’t control everything out there, but we can get the green and go racing and see how it works out.” \nGordon, who also won the pole for the Talladega spring race, was easily the fastest of the 12 drivers who advanced to the second round of qualifying Saturday. He expressed confidence that he will have a good shot at winning in his 46th and final trip around NASCAR’s biggest track. \nFive Chasers — Kurt Busch, Carl Edwards, Kyle Busch, Ryan Newman and Martin Truex Jr. — failed to make the second qualifying round. Gluck: Low-risk riding could reap big reward at Talladega \nThe qualifying session was delayed by an unusual occurrence on pit road. When Clint Bowyer was given the OK by NASCAR officials to leave pit road for his qualifying run, his car was in reverse and he bumped into Justin Allgaier’s HScott Motorsports Chevrolet, which was parked behind him. \nThe contact caused minor damage to the rear of Bowyer’s car but more significant front-end damage to Allgaier’s. Allgaier’s qualifying run was delayed while his crew patched his Chevrolet’s front end. \nBowyer apologized afterward, saying he didn’t know his car was in reverse. 'Dega: 'Hopefully it all stays on the ground' \nIronically, Bowyer will be moving to the HScott team next season. \nTruex Jr.’s qualifying speed was disallowed after he dropped below the track’s inside yellow line during his run. He will start 43rd Sunday. \nJeb Burton and Michael Annett failed to qualify. \nPHOTOS: Chase drivers, rankings and points", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:41:40.264+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
