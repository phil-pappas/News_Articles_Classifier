(Kevin Richardosn/Baltimore Sun) Jon Meoli Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun A foot injury has ended Lorenzo Taliaferro's year for the second straight season. \nThe Ravens placed running back Lorenzo Taliaferro on season-ending injured reserve Wednesday with a foot injury, then used his vacant roster spot to claim running back Raheem Mostert from the Miami Dolphins. \nTaliaferro was inactive in Week 1 while dealing with a sprained MCL in his knee, and returned to the fold as the teamâ€™s best rusher with seven carries for 34 yards and a touchdown in Week 2 against the Oakland Raiders. \nBut late in that game, Taliaferro tweaked the same foot he sprained to land him on injured reserve in December 2014. He said it was the same foot, but a different injury, and had six carries for 13 yards in Weeks 3 and 4 before being inactive with the injury Sunday against the Cleveland Browns. \nThe 2014 fourth-round NFL draft pick will end his second season having played just 16 games for the Ravens, and his injury is an opportunity for rookie Buck Allen to step into the No. 2 running back role, provided starter Justin Forsett is healthy. \nMiami waived Mostert on Tuesday, and the Ravens will be his third team in a month. He went undrafted out of Purdue and had an impressive preseason with the Philadelphia Eagles. He led the NFL with 351 yards from scrimmage (14 catches for 194 yards and 39 carries for 157 yards) in four preseason games, and also had two punt returns for touchdowns.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T23:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:18:53.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
