Former Giants safety Tyler Sash, who was found dead in his Iowa home on Sept. 8, died of an accidental drug overdose, an autopsy confirmed.\nThe Iowa state medical examiner's office said that Sash overdosed on two pain medications, methadone and hydrocodone. Sash had endured a recent shoulder dislocation and had a history of chronic shoulder pains, \"significant conditions,\" according to the medical examiner.\nThe autopsy found that Sash's death was from an \"accidental mixed drug toxicity involving methadone and hydrocodone.\" According to The Associated Press, Sash's body will undergo further tests to determine if he might have suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), a degenerative brain disease found in many former NFL players.\nView Gallery Sports Stars Lost in 2015\nSash, who was 27, was a key special teams player on the Giants' 2011 Super Bowl team, but his career was checkered. In 2012, he was suspended for the first four games of the season after testing positive for Adderall, although he claimed he had a prescription and hadn't know it was banned by the NFL.\nA year later, the Giants cut Sash, and he did not play again. He'd make news again in May of 2014 when he was arrested and charged with public intoxication and interference with official acts in his hometown of Oskaloosa, Iowa.\nHe had been riding a scooter with the lights off at 1:30 a.m., and when police told him to stop, he led them on a four-block chase before ditching the scooter. When found in the woods, he refused to leave and needed to be tased before being taken to jail. He pled guilty to public intoxication and was fined $65.\nRelated Stories Tyler Sash's death hits home for Tom Coughlin, Eli Manning Tags: tyler sash", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:56:25.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
