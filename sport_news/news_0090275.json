(Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) \nAllen Park — Lions tight end Eric Ebron is glad his knee injury isn’t significant, but he was still upset to miss Sunday’s game against the Arizona Cardinals, especially as he watched his team lose 42-17.\n“Of a game that I should’ve absolutely tore apart? It was hard,” Ebron said of watching another loss. “That was my gameplan going in. It still hurts because I knew we shouldn’t have been in that situation.\n“If I would’ve played, we wouldn’t have been in that situation, but stuff happens, man. It’s the NFL. You risk your life every time you go out there, so it hurts.”\nThe Cardinals clobbered the Lions on Sunday, taking advantage of Detroit’s six turnovers on offense. Arizona won the second quarter 28-0, and after going into halftime with a 28-7 lead, the Cardinals remained comfortably ahead for the rest of the game.\nEbron likely would’ve helped the offense, though, as he had in the first four games. He had 15 catches for 179 yards and two touchdowns in his first 3 1 / 2 games this year before exiting in Week 4 against the Seattle Seahawks with a left knee injury that held him out of Week 5.\nEbron later was asked why he would’ve performed well against Arizona, but the answer left the possibility that he was talking about the rest of the Seahawks game. A Lions media-relations employee planned to ask Ebron for clarification after practice.\n“Just basically their personnel that they had,” he said, presumably discussing the Cardinals. “I knew I was unmatched in that game. We knew I was unmatched in that game, and we knew that in order for us to open up our offense we needed me to do what I do best and I was on a roll. I was going to. I was feeling it and then (center Travis Swanson) bombed on my knee.”\nSwanson accidentally rolled up on Ebron in the second quarter in Seattle when he had two catches for 21 yards. Last week, Cincinnati tight end Tyler Eifert had eight catches for 90 yards and two touchdowns against the Seahawks.\nLions coach Jim Caldwell didn’t want to discuss the hypothetical possibility of having Ebron in the blowout loss to Arizona.\n“I know what happened,” he said. “We got our ears kicked in.”\nEbron returned to practice Wednesday, which is a good sign for how he’s recovering. He also ran during practice last Friday, and after missing most of the game in Seattle, Ebron said it was “a great relief” that his knee injury wasn’t serious.\n“Me personally, I thought it was horrible,” he said of his initial reaction. “But when I got the report back, what had happened, I was excited and ready to do whatever I had to do to play.”\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:53:32.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
