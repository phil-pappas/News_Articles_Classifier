Ashley Young is not quite ready after injury.\n\"It's always better that a manager can select from a lot of players. There have been times when I could not select from many, like last year, but this year it's much better,\" he said.\nCaptain Wayne Rooney is expected to start up front for United, despite his struggles in front of goal this season and criticism for his all-round contribution.\nShould Rooney, who turns 30 on Sunday, score he would move second on his own in the all-time Premier League scoring charts with 188. He would also equal Denis Law's 237 goals for United and be joint-second on the club's all-time scoring list behind Bobby Charlton on 249.\nRooney will be involved in his 20th Manchester derby having scored eight times, but for German midfielder Bastian Schweinsteiger it will be his first taste of one having joined from Bayern Munich.\n\"I am definitely looking forward to the derby against City. I think it is something very special and we should be very happy that we have two big clubs in one city that are also playing in the Champions League,\" he told United's website.\n\"I remember when I was in Munich we were always looking for that, but the other team at 1860 Munich didn't play so well!\n\"We were always looking for a derby but it was sadly not possible.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:41:22.923+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
