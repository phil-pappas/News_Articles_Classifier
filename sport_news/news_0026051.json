Other speed tiers, including other \"Performance\" tiers, are not changing.\nThe higher speeds are only available to Comcast customers who subscribe to a bundle of services , or to new customers who subscribe to the new service tiers.\nSome modems have a reset button, but Comcast suggests unplugging it for 10 seconds. The faster speeds should materialize when the modem comes back.\nWant to check your speed? Go to speedtest.net before resetting your modem, and revisit the site afterward.\nRates for many Comcast cable TV and Internet plans went up at the start of the month .\nComcast charges new, Internet-only subscribers $75 a month for the 75 Mbps service, or $90 for 150 Mbps.\nThe company's rate structure is extremely complex, and Comcast says there is no standard pricing for the new speeds for customers who subscribe to a bundle of services.\n-- Mike Rogoway mrogoway@oregonian.com\n503-294-7699\n@rogoway", "external_links": ["http://customer.xfinity.com/help-and-support/internet/power-cycling-your-modem/?CCT=53BA3D76CB1473BFF49C79FE4AA86DFF1EE2DE626F409A5975BC3E65B9BE0D46E4BDD02D854EA372B2E636E69F3308269C0C1B57A81E273957F5A5522F1F69AAF5D5B02848C81E899B94C4204F9C40A1219", "http://www.speedtest.net/", "https://twitter.com/rogoway"], "published": "2015-10-20T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:50:23.867+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
