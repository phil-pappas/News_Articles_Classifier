Baylor jumped to No. 2, while TCU, Utah and Clemson rounded out the top 5. Michigan State fell from No. 4 to No. 7 after its nail-biting win over Rutgers. Michigan climbed to No. 12, Iowa moved up to No. 17 and Northwestern fell to No. 20 as the Big Ten landed five teams in the Top 25 media poll. Click HERE to read the full AP Top 25.\nFor the first time this season, I bumped Ohio State down a peg on my Associated Press Top 25 ballot.\nThe Buckeyes won at Maryland, 49-28, to improve to 6-0 but it certainly wasn't convincing against an embattled Terps squad that has a strong case to be considered the worst team in the Big Ten at this point. They led by only a touchdown late in the third quarter before pulling away.\nMeanwhile, Utah continued to impress as it defeated previously No. 23-ranked California to improve to 5-0. The Utes are now the lone unbeaten team in a strong Pac-12 Conference, and every week their season-opening win over Michigan (winner of three straight shutouts) looks more impressive.\nSo I went with Utah No. 1 and Ohio State No. 2.\nHere is my complete ballot following Week 6 action:\nPLUS: 10 takeaways from Rutgers' loss to Michigan State\n1.
