Good teams move on, with differences squashed in-house early if they are raised at all.\nNot all those teams have a monotone coach who drives home the point by answering, \"We're on to Baltimore\" to every question asked about an ailing defense and an undercut veteran cornerback.\nMike Pettine doesn't have to be Bill Belichick, in other words. But he needs to show more leadership than he did this week. In particular, he needs to rally (and rally around) his defense, the one O'Neil is coaching in his likeness.\nOr you get the feeling this season is going to go sideways and spin out of control.\nHow the defense responds on the road against a rested Baltimore team is clearly the most intriguing aspect of this season so far and offers a glimpse of what's to come.\nI know some of you only see intrigue in the possible improvement of the No. 2 quarterback. But the Browns actually took steps with Johnny Manziel on the bench last year and could do so again with Josh McCown at quarterback.\n Do you know Ravens' QB Joe Flacco's record vs. Browns? cleveland-browns-2015, cleveland-browns-videos, nfl, mike-pettiine, tramon-williams, karlos-dansby, paul-kruger, joe-flacco\nThey did it not only by winning seven games before the trap door swallowed them. But also in winning convincingly twice in the division and playing Baltimore to a narrow loss at home and a respectable defeat behind Connor Shaw in the season's final game.\nThat sounds like a weak-tea compliment, but the way the defense dominated Pittsburgh at home and Cincinnati on the road was a fundamental gain that suggested a defensive-minded head coach could be, might be, maybe even was the right guy in Berea.\nInstead, four games later, a veteran defense built on Pettine's specifications from the secondary in ranks last in the league in yards allowed and 31 st against the run.\nPettine did himself no favors this week with his unnecessary comments about Haden deciding he \"didn't want to go\" last week in San Diego. As soon as the words were out of his mouth, you knew he'd spend his next press conference walking them back.\nThe Browns were still talking Thursday about something that happened Sunday. (Granted, in part, because the media was asking). But they control the message, and it got muddled once again. Sunday in Baltimore will tell us how well they compartmentalize the noise, some of it self-created.\nBut more importantly, it will show how much they still want to turn this season around for a young head coach and how much they believe in their even younger defensive coordinator.\nA year ago, the first four Browns opponents scored 30, 24, 23 and 28 points, respectively. In four of the next five games, they scored 10, 13, 17, and 3. Two of those games were wins over Pittsburgh and Cincinnati. Sunday is their first chance to show they've made sustained progress in the division.\nFor now, some players are airing concerns they shouldn't be talking about. And the coaches are redirecting the focus, right back at you. It's a bad look. Teams that want to be good don't get there this way.\nSunday we find out which direction the Browns want this season to go.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/agZKF7U5s8A", "http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/eye-on-football/25330694/mike-pettine-misspoke-on-joe-haden-cb-wanted-to-play-vs-chargers", "http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/cle/2014.htm"], "published": "2015-10-11T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:28:06.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
