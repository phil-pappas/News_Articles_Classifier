Southern Boone forced seven California turnovers and rushed for 310 yards on 52 carries to beat California 48-21 Friday night and advance in the Class 3 District 6 playoffs. \n“Tonight didn’t go like we wanted of course, but sometimes adversity like that pops up,” California head coach Marty Albertson said. “You’re not going to beat any good teams with seven turnovers.” \nThe Pintos’ offense struggled to gain any traction to start the game. Quarterback Jacob Wolken threw an interception on the opening possession, then California had fumbles on three of its next five drives. \nDespite all of the early mishaps, the Eagles only held a 12-0 lead after the fourth turnover in the first half. \nAfter Wolken threw his first interception that gave Southern Boone the ball at the Pintos’ 30-yard line, Laron Wallace scored four plays later from the 5. \nWallace scored again one play after the Eagles recovered a California fumble — its third turnover — early in the second quarter. The 15-yard run gave Southern Boone a 12-0 lead. \nThe Pintos’ defense was on the field for most of the second and third quarters, as Southern Boone added two more touchdowns during that span. \n“I thought the defense played well in the first half,” Albertson said. “They got worn out the second half, basically.” \nThe Eagles moved the ball 59 yards on eights plays to extend the lead to 18-0 before halftime. Quarterback Spencer Taggart and receiver Gannon Mueller connected on a receiver screen pass for a 17-yard touchdown. \n“It seemed like they had the ball the whole first half and we didn’t have it very much, and when we did have it, we turned it over,” Albertson said. \nTo start the third quarter, Southern Boone took seven minutes off the clock as the Eagles moved down the field for the touchdown and a 26-0 lead. A fake punt on a fourth-and-5 helped the cause, as Mueller took the snap and rushed up the middle for a 35-yard gain. \nCalifornia answered with a quick touchdown drive — albeit its longest of the day — to cut the lead to 26-7. Josh Woodruff took a pitch from Wolken for 29 yards, the Wolken found receiver Landon Mouse for a 16-yard gain to move the ball into the red zone. Two plays later, Wolken completed a pass to a wide-open Mouse in the end zone for a 17-yard score. \nThe teams traded touchdowns for the rest of the game. \nSouthern Boone’s Tanner Smith scored from the 1-yard line to push the Eagles’ lead to 34-7, then Wolken needed just two plays to find receiver Ethan Hodges over the middle. Hodges hauled in a one-handed catch and sprinted to the end zone to make it a 34-14 game. \nA Taggart to Trevor Garriott 3-yard connection gave the Eagles a 42-14 lead, then Woodruff completed a 73-yard halfback pass to Hodges late in the fourth quarter for the score. \n“They played us basically man-up the whole time across,” Albertson said. “They were giving us the short throw most of the time and we burned them deep a couple of times later on, but it was way too late by that time.” \nSouthern Boone’s Brandon Bowden iced the game with a 5-yard touchdown run to provide the final margin. \nSouthern Boone (6-4) will play at 7 p.m. Friday at Fulton (8-2), while California ends at 6-4. ﻿", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:10:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:09:27.828+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
