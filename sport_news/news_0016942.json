We’re all excited to go back home, and excited to be where we are. We have a lot of confidence going into this series.\"\nHESITATION: Noah Syndergaard made his first career relief appearance and fired a scoreless seventh inning to help preserve the 3-2 victory over the Dodgers.\nSyndergaard warmed up four times in the pen before coming in, and struck out two while also issuing a walk. It’s uncertain which game he will start in the NLCS.\n\"Exciting. It was a lot of fun,\" Syndergaard said. \"Travis [d’Arnaud] met me on the mound and talked about executing one pitch at a time, and kept it as simple as that.\"\nLINEUP DISCUSSION: Collins said the team considered sitting Lucas Duda on Thursday, although it wasn’t given too much thought. Duda went 0-for-3 but had a pivotal walk that helped set up the game-tying run in the fourth inning, and finished 2-for-18 (.111) in the series.\n\"Lucas has been the guy,\" Collins said before the game. \"You never know when he breaks out, because as we’ve seen, if he breaks out he carries you.\"\nBRIEFS: Collins said he had been told infielder Juan Uribe (chest) had yet to begin any baseball activities. That indicated Uribe will not be available for the NLCS. … Jacob deGrom went 2-0 with a 1.38 ERA over 13 innings in the series, outdueling Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke in his two starts. … Jeurys Familia became the first Met to record a six-out save since Jesse Orosco in Game 7 of the 1986 World Series. … The Dodgers’ fell to 4-1 in elimination playoff games since moving to Los Angeles in 1958. … Justin Turner’s two doubles gave him a Dodgers playoff-record six in one series.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:46:38.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
