The team management's decision to release players like Fikru, last year's captaon Garcia and Jofre Mateu, who played a key role in their title-winning run, has definitely raised a few eyebrows. \nImage: Chennaiyin FC players celebrate after scoring a goal against Atletico De Kolkata during last season of the Indian Super League. \nPhotograph: PTI © Copyright 2015 PTI.
