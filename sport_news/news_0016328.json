Johnny suffered a groin injury and is awaiting a scan but we’re hopeful,” the IRFU said on Twitter. \nIreland, which avoided any serious injuries before center Jared Payne was sent home with a fractured foot last Saturday, lost O’Mahony in the second half of the hugely physical test when his foot stuck in the grass and he twisted his knee. \nSchmidt, who was initially hopeful that the injury looked the least serious of the three, could face further backrow problems for the quarterfinal against Argentina if Sean O’Brien is cited for striking France’s Pascal Pape in the stomach. \nMeanwhile, Ross Ford and Jonny Gray are in danger of missing Scotland’s World Cup quarterfinal against Australia after both were cited yesterday. \nFirst choice hooker Ford and lock Gray, who forms an effective partnership with older brother Richie, have been cited for a lifting tackle during Scotland’s thrilling 36-33 win over Samoa on Saturday. \nTheir hearing will take place in London today. \nAustralia will have breathed a sigh of relief as star No 8 David Pocock escaped a citing for an incident during its epic 15-6 win over Wales on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:41:41.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
