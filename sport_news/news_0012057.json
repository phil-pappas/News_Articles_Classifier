The Rough Riders have to feel they won’t be a pushover for anybody after taking the Spartans right to the wire. \n“It was a pretty even game today compared to the first game, when they dismantled us,” said Catasauqua coach Carrie Saul, a former head coach at Phillipsburg. \nCatasauqua received an outstanding effort from sophomore goalkeeper Hannah Greenberg , who made 17 saves to keep her team in the game. Greenberg made a number of sparkling stops on high scoring Southern Lehigh forward Meghan Reese (30 goals, 17 assists), who was held without a goal or an assist for the first time this season. \nRELATED : Quinn Bachman has become a fixture for Catasauqua field hockey \n“(Greenberg) had a heck of a game today,” Saul said. “She stepped up to the balls really well.” \nThe difference in the game came with 17:30 left in the first half when Southern Lehigh’s Paige Gehman scored off an assist from Allison Schroy . \n“On that goal the ball was blocked in a way that it spun and it kind of pushed back her (Greenberg’s) hand and trickled in,” Saul said. “It was a bummer.” \nWednesday’s loss ended a string of five straight league wins for the Rough Riders. Saul feels she’s getting the most out of her roster, which is small in numbers this year. \n“We have a very small bench,” she said. “We really only have two or three subs each game. It’s a tribute to our fitness that we’re able to play a full game against teams that have a lot of subs. I don’t think I’ve ever had numbers this low. This is a whole new ballgame.” \nSenior forward Quinn Bachman , who leads Catty with 27 goals and 12 assists this season, can easily see the growth of the team since the beginning of the year. \n“We have improved a lot,” Bachman said. “And it helps to have the home field advantage. We’re more comfortable on our field.” \nSaul made a key defensive adjustment after Tuesday’s 4-2 loss to Lehighton. \n“We weren’t approaching the ball correctly,” Saul said. “(Against Lehighton) we were basically running straight to the offensive players rather than approaching them at the proper angles. We corrected that today.” \nCatty finishes its regular season on Wednesday against Northern Lehigh. Then it’s on to the postseason, when the Rough Riders hope to make some noise. \n“We have to embrace the postseason now,” Saul said. \n“We were definitely the underdog today but I think we represented ourselves well,” Bachman said. “This should help us a lot going into the postseason.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T02:50:17.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
