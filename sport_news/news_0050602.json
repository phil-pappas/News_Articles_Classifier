Is this a team still finding itself? Or kind of sleepwalking toward the showdown with Ohio State? Speaking of Ohio State, it's College Football Playoff or bust for Michigan State, right?\nA: \"It’s definitely playoff or bust for the Spartans, these players and coaches believe they have the goods to win it all. Well, they did before key players started going down like no other season in Mark Dantonio’s tenure.\n\"MSU’s best linebacker (Ed Davis) and cornerback (Vayante Copeland) are out for the season; both starting offensive tackles, including possible first-round pick Jack Conklin, are questionable at best for Saturday with knee injuries; Conklin’s backup, Dennis Finley, broke his tibia and fibula Saturday; senior safety RJ Williamson just had biceps surgery and is out until at least the last game of the regular season; and starting tight end Josiah Price and receiver Macgarrett Kings Jr. missed the last game and are uncertain for Rutgers.\n\"That doesn’t explain all the struggles. But against Purdue, for instance, it was 21-0, Finley went down, MSU’s center had to move to left tackle and the second half was “let’s get out of here” in bad weather. Then it got dicey. MSU’s defense has been inconsistent for certain. This team is definitely still finding itself and won’t like the discovery unless the injuries stop.\"\nQ: Michigan State's defense is in the middle of the Big Ten pack in most categories, not what we've come to expect in recent years. Is this the effect of losing coordinator Pat Narduzzi? Or of losing so many players in the secondary to the NFL that the \"No Fly Zone\" isn't what it used to be?\nA: \"That tremendous secondary of two years ago is all gone now, including two first-round corners. And now two of this year’s starters in Copeland and Williamson are out. Beyond that, sophomore safety Montae Nicholson was billed as the next big star for MSU in the secondary and has been the worst player in that secondary, struggling mightily to tackle in space.\n\"The front seven has been good – Air Force and its triple option skews the rushing numbers a bit – but Purdue did get some things done against the Spartans at the point of attack. I can’t look at this defense and trace any of the struggles directly to Narduzzi leaving. But his passion and energy are rare, and I’m sure that is missed to some extent.\"\nQ: Middletown North High School graduate Shilique Calhoun is coming back to New Jersey . He's been a dominant Big Ten player for three years in the big picture. But as someone who sees him every game, where has he improved the most this year, and what do you think his NFL future holds?\nA: \"This has been Calhoun’s best year, though Purdue did a good job of keeping him quiet last week. In a game against Central Michigan that was close going into the fourth quarter, he basically put MSU’s defense on his back with 2 ½ sacks and several hurries – and a few holding calls that should have been called. He was charging in against double teams with MSU going to a three-man rush often in the second half.\n\"Calhoun became a star two years ago because he scored three defensive touchdowns early in the season. He is much better against the run now vs. then, and he’s a better pass rusher as well. I’ve never considered him a lock to be a standout in the NFL. I think he’ll go in the first two rounds and be a solid pro, at least.\"\nQ: We hear so much about the Ohio State quarterbacks and Penn State's Christian Hackenberg that somehow a top NFL prospect like Michigan State QB Connor Cook sometimes flies under the radar. What are the strengths of Cook's game? What's his personality like in that is he the type who relishes flying under the radar, is motivated by it, or tunes it all out?\nA: \"I think Cook’s flying under the radar this season in part because he hasn’t been putting up big numbers. He actually had a great first half against Purdue (which was his 28th win, giving him the all-time MSU record), and then the offensive line got bizarre and he threw seven times in the second half for 11 yards. He has played well overall this season, but I wouldn’t call it his best football yet.\n\"He has missed on some passes, and accuracy is something he continues to try to improve. He came up big in a third-quarter stretch against Oregon that gave MSU control of that game. He has a big arm with an easy, quick motion, and he can make any throw. He’s more athletic than you might think. As far as personality, I think he’s pretty good at tuning it all out. His best trait is the ability to instantly forget about a mistake and keep playing.\"\nQ: Speaking of under the radar, Mark Dantonio isn't the newsmaker that Jim Harbaugh, Urban Meyer or even James Franklin is. But he sure does win a lot. What's the secret at Michigan State? How does he react to sharing East Division space with some of these big personality coaches?\nA: \"Well, Dantonio has certainly been asked enough about Harbaugh, and he’s had some great battles with Meyer already. Recruits against all of them, of course. I don’t get the sense Dantonio cares about attention for himself. I’m sure he’d gladly cut down to two media appearances a year if he could (if he didn’t need to do it to sell the program).\n\"The secret is player evaluation and development more than anything. This staff has a great system for identifying players and making them better, as seen in three “two-star” recruits who have been first-round picks (Le’Veon Bell, Darqueze Dennard, Trae Waynes). It’s been a long-term build, obviously involving great defense and physical football. Team chemistry has been very good. And then MSU’s recruiting momentum has surged in the past few years. Dantonio is now able to recruit nationally like Michigan State hasn’t done since the 1960s.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:26:21.062+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
