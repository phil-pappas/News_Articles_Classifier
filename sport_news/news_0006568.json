Squali rates shares as a buy with a $45 price target. \nYahoo's report did not give details of the plan to spinoff of its 15% stake in Alibaba. \nNo, Yahoo isn't beefing up its own search algorithms; it's actually using Google's. The transaction may save Yahoo about $9 billion in taxes. \nCFO Ken Goldman said the company's board authorized it to proceed with the spin-off, despite not receiving the early initial approval it had sought from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. \"We'd like to see if they can get that done this quarter, and if they can do it in a tax-free manner\". Two of her top deputies- marketing chief Kathy Savitt and former acquisitions head Jacqueline Reses -left the company in the recent weeks, raising concerns about morale inside the company. Yahoo said its third-quarter earnings fell to $76 million, or 8 cents a share, from $6.77 billion, or $6.70 a share, a year ago. \nThomson Reuters had forecast earnings of 17 cents per share based on an average of analyst estimates, The Wall Street Journal said. While Mayer and her team have talked about the impressive growth of this group - up 55% year over year to $255 million in the second quarter - investors have noted there is confusion about this. Mayer framed it as an opportunity to simplify the company's structure and improve expense discipline. \nApart from its Alibaba stake, Doshi said he'd be watching for growth in Yahoo's mobile , video , native advertising and social spaces. On Sunday, the company will stream, for free, a National Football League game featuring the Jacksonville Jaguars and Buffalo Bills. \nEarlier this month, the company revamped its mobile e-mail application with a cleaner look. Still, a few analysts doubt these initiatives will be enough to reverse the company's trajectory.
