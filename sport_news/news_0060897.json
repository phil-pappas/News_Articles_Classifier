After an 18-yard pass play that put the Eagles into the red zone, Bradford looked to Riley Cooper only to find Saints corner Brandon Browner.\nBrowner, one of the Saints key off-season signings, pulled in the teams first interception in the end zone for a touchback.\nDrew Brees then lead the team on an 80-yard touchdown drive, hitting receivers Willie Snead and Brandin Cooks for key gains before finding Tight End Benjamin Watson for the score, giving the Saints a 7-0 lead that they would carry into the second quarter.\nThe Eagles offense shook off their turnover and picked up right where they left off, marching down the field and back into the redzone, but once again, Bradford was picked off.\nDelvin Breaux, another corner starting his first season with the Saints, picked off a pass intended for Miles Austin and silenced the crowd at Lincoln Financial Field.\nThe Eagles would not be denied much long though. After forcing a Saints three-and-out, Sam Bradford found receiver Josh Huff for a 41-yard touchdown tying the game at 7-a-piece.\nBoth defense would hold for the rest of the half until the a Drew Brees fumble within the two-minute warning set up the Eagles for a field goal as the clock expired.\nUnfortunately, that wasn't the last fumble of the game for the Saints. Brees would fumble the ball one more time and recent addition Michael Hoomanawanui would lose the teams third. Brees would add an interception as well, bringing the saints to four turnovers on the day.\nPhiladelphia took advantage of nearly every one of those turnovers to put up 29-points in the second half and bury the Saints 39-17.\nBrees put up 335 yards passing and a touchdown, but the team's turnovers were too much to overcome. The Eagles put up 519 total yards on offense.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
