(Contributed photo/Michael Spencer) Comments \nIt's common knowledge – or at least it should be – that you don't schedule a wedding on a Saturday during football season. \nSo what do you do if you want to tie the knot and still root on your favorite team? Here's a solution: Just plan your wedding for the pre-game tailgate. \nTwo Alabama fans, known as \"Chip and Carrie\" said their vows ahead of today's Alabama/Tennessee game. The wedding was captured in photos and tweets by Knoxville television station WATE's Michael Spencer. There is a wedding going on in the tailgate area at Bama right now. Got to hang with the officiant. pic.twitter.com/H22GASfDLU — Michael Spencer (@WATEMichael) October 24, 2015 The crowd has gathered for the wedding. pic.twitter.com/PSGPB3rzkZ — Michael Spencer (@WATEMichael) October 24, 2015 This is a legit wedding. pic.twitter.com/1yCP1jJkmH — Michael Spencer (@WATEMichael) October 24, 2015 Congrats to Chip and Carrie. pic.twitter.com/vD44sL4Kwe — Michael Spencer (@WATEMichael) October 24, 2015 \nThe photos quickly spread online and sharp-eyed viewers honed in on one particular guest (no, not the Bama Pope, whatever is going on with that.) The photos show a man wearing an Alabama shirt and, for some reason, a Speedo-style bathing suit. \nYou can see that a little clearer here: — We're From Tennessee (@LoneNutVolFan) October 24, 2015 \nThere's no explanation as to why the man is wearing a bathing suit at the wedding or who exactly \"Chip and Carrie\" are but we wish them the best.
