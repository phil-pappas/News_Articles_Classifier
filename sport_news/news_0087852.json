(AP) - Tupelo tourism officials will spend a week in England next month selling the city and the Elvis Presley Birthplace as destinations.\nThe Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal ( http://bit.ly/1GcaqEQ ) reports Tupelo Convention and Visitor Bureau director Neal McCoy said Tupelo was invited to take part in \"Elvis at the 02,\" which is billed as the largest Elvis exhibition ever in Europe.\nMcCoy says the exhibit - which shows some items that had never before left Graceland - was supposed to be a nine-month show, ending in August, but because it's been so successful, they extended it three months.\nMcCoy, the bureau's international sales director, Jennie Curlee, and Mayor Jason Shelton will fly to London on Sunday, Nov. 1, and return the following Friday.\nInformation from: Northeast Mississippi Daily Journal, http://djournal.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
