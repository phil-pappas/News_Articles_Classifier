Well, better than many of us.\nSister Lilla Lottinger was recently visiting dad when some fellow missionaries convinced her to dance as a tribute to her late mother, who was a vibrant dancer.\nEnter Silento and his hit song 'Watch Me (Whip/Nae Nae).' The spirit takes control and the women dance to everyone's delight.\nWatch them Whip. Watch them Nae Nae. Clearly, this isn't their first time performing.\nThe missionaries said they were just having some innocent fun.\nAnd if you think something is wrong with this dance, Sister Lottinger wants you to remember First Corinthians Chapter 10 verse 31.\n\"Whether, then, you eat or drink (or dance) or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.\"\nHaving trouble viewing this video on a mobile device?
