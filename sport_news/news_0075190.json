Two-thirds of the 298 people who died were Dutch.\nThe 15-month probe did not explicitly say who had fired the missile, but it identified an area of 320 square kilometres (120 square miles) from where it said the launch must have taken place. All of the land was in the hands of pro-Russian separatists fighting Ukrainian forces at the time of the disaster, according to daily maps of fighting released by the Ukrainian National Security Council.\nRussia and the rebels insist that if the plane was destroyed by a missile, it must have been fired by the Ukrainian military.\n\"The Russian commission categorically disagrees with the conclusions of the final report. They are fundamentally wrong, the lack of logic there is beyond comparison,\" Oleg Storchevoi, deputy chief of the Russian Aviation Agency, said in a televised news conference on Wednesday. \"I had a feeling that the commission was cherry-picking the evidence to suit a theory they had chosen.\"\nStorchevoi said Russia \"will use its right\" to continue the probe and has already appealed to the U.N.'s civil aviation agency to intervene.\nStorchevoi hinted that Russia believes that some of the evidence has been faked. He accused the Dutch of \"hiding important data\" from Russia, calling into question the authenticity of the shrapnel and pieces of the missile reportedly found in the wreckage.\nSpeaking in Donetsk, rebel leader Alexander Zakharchenko denied any involvement in the crash.\n\"We have said before and we still say that we did not shoot down the plane,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:39:23.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
