I sort of thought he may have been joking but I quickly became aware that he was not joking. He said that everybody is doing it, all the big boys are doing it. Will you take it on?” McCullum was quoted as saying. \nMcCullum said he rejected the approach in a later phone call, saying “I wish I had said no straight away. I could not comprehend that Chris would put me in a position which would risk my future in the game.” \nIn 2010, Modi used a social media account to accuse Cairns of fixing a game in the now defunct Indian Cricket League, a rival Twenty20 competition to the IPL, in 2008. \nCairns sued Modi in London for libel and was awarded damages, but is now subject to the perjury action. \nAsked why he did not immediately report the approaches, McCullum said: “I kind of did not want it to be true. He was someone I looked at as a friend.” \nHe said he reported the allegations to cricket’s anti-corruption authorities in 2011, after listening to a lecture from the International Council’s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit during the World Cup, and has given other statements to investigators. \nDefense lawyer Orlando Pownall suggested that McCullum had not told “the unvarnished truth”. \n“I was scared to come forward and say that someone I admired in New Zealand had asked me to come forward to match fix,” McCullum said. \nThe trial continues.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:09:33.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
