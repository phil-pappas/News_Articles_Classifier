Degenhardt threw an interception in the game but it wasn’t the throw that caught his coach’s attention. It was the chase his 15-year-old sophomore quarterback gave after the play that did.\n“It should have been a pick-six but he just took off after the kid,” Gagne said. “He had a horrible angle on him but he was determined to make that tackle. And he did make it. Everyone else was focused on the interception, and while I wasn’t happy with it either, I was really focused on the fact that he’s a competitor that just threw an interception and then took off and made a tackle that I didn’t think he was capable of making.\n“I knew he had the arm and I knew he had the height, but that was one of the first times that I found out about this inner competitor that he has. He’s more than a big kid with a big arm. We saw we had something internal there, too.”\nDegenhardt went on to throw for more than 2,000 yards and lead the Grey Ghosts back to the playoffs for the first time since 2009. Now a 6-foot-6, 190-pound junior, Degenhardt has completed 33-of-52 passes for 542 yards and five touchdowns and added three more scores on the ground to help Westford get out to a 3-0 start.\nIt’s the sort of production you’d expect from a kid who has watched home videos of himself learning to throw a football at the same age he was learning to walk. It didn’t hurt that his father, Chris, has some experience, having played quarterback at Holy Cross.\nWhile dad was certainly an invaluable resource over the years when it came to playing the position and developing on the field, Degenhardt said the most valuable piece of advice he’s gotten from his father had nothing do with throwing the ball.\n“He taught me about being selfless and that you’re only as good as your team,” Degenhardt said. “I feel like I have a great relationship with these guys. I trust everyone out there and I feel like they trust me too. The most important thing he taught me is to be a leader and do everything for my brothers on this team.”\nDegenhardt certainly has the size and big arm that could someday allow him to follow in his father’s footsteps as a big-time college quarterback. He’s attended a number of camps and has already drawn the interest of several Division 1 programs. But what impresses his coach even more than Degenhardt’s physical gifts is his football IQ.\n“On and off the field, he’s a really smart and intelligent kid,” Gagne said. “Whenever he makes a decision, good or bad, our conversation is ‘What are you thinking here or why did you go there?’ and he has an answer. Or he’ll come off the field and say, ‘Hey coach, I like this,’ and my first question is why. I won’t run it unless there is a definite answer, and he always has one.\n“Now, he’s starting with the why and it’s great,” Gagne said. “There is no more comfortable feeling for a coach than knowing your quarterback has his reasons ready and mapped out for why he wants to try something. It makes him like another coach on the field.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:09:09.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
