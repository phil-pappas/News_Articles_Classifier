Police say the pastor shot Smith after Smith threatened him with a brick. \nAuthorities have declined to publicly identify the pastor, who was questioned and released without charge and who is cooperating with the investigation. \nPolice say the men knew each other and had problems. Officer Keisha Beasley-Dorsey said the pastor previously filed a complaint at Smith with the department. \nSmith’s sister, Deja Ward, told The Detroit News that her brother and his wife had lived at one point with the pastor. Ward added Smith had no problems with anyone. \n“He never brought beef to anybody,” she said. “He wanted closure so he could start counseling. I guess it turned out a whole other way.” \nWard said her brother had worked for a suburban Detroit manufacturing company but was suspended after having an argument with the pastor. Smith’s company offered him anger management classes, which he planned to attend after reconciling with his wife, she said. \nWard said Smith loved football and played for the Michigan Lightning, a semi-pro team. A post on the team’s Facebook page described him as “a Founding Father of our organization” who had an “infectious smile” and exhibited “tenacity and skill.” \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:57:34.174+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
