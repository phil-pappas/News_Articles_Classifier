Staff photo by Alex Resnak slideshow CANTON — Etowah ran through the Cherokee County volleyball tournament without dropping a set and won its first title since 2009.After beating Woodstock and Creekview at home Thursday night, the Lady Eagles stayed just as hot Saturday to beat Cherokee, Sequoyah and River Ridge at Cherokee.“That was a very big win for us against Sequoyah,” coach Kim Robertson said. “I thought the girls came out very strong. They’re passing the ball extremely well, which allows our setters to get the ball to our weapons. This is the time that you want your girls peaking, in October, so they’re all big for us.”Natalie Lucco led Etowah with 32 kills in Saturday’s matches, while Paige Horton and Nicole Ferris added 19 and 18 kills, respectively. Jessie Cohen and Sydney Hotaling split time at setter, while Madeline Gilmer played well defensively in the back.Despite the Etowah senior class’ accomplishments, this is the first time the group has been county champion, and Robertson hopes the success can carry over to the upcoming Area 5 tournament.“It shows that we’ve been working hard, and it’s a good payoff for all the hard work the girls have put in over the years,” Robertson said. “The rewards are starting to come this year, so, hopefully, we can carry that through the area tournament and on to state.”Woodstock coach Anita Dodd was also impressed with some things her team did after the Lady Wolverines came back from trailing in the third set to beat Cherokee in the day’s final match.“I think we played better earlier in the day, but it was nice to see them come back from being behind and pull forward at the end,” Dodd said. “I think they woke up. We made some changes this week as to how we’re playing. If we can just get our momentum and move forward like that, we can make it back to state again.”If Woodstock makes a run in the area tournament, it will likely be on the strength of Emilee Harris, who led the team (32 kills Saturday), Mackenzie Keeton (48 digs) and Jane Townsend (71 assists).Host Cherokee did not play as well Saturday, going 1-2 with a win over Creekview, but coach Pamela Bonitatibus is confident the Lady Warriors will be ready to play when the matches become more meaningful.“We were missing a few players with injuries, but, as long as we can play together as a team, we can win,” she said. “They really started to play together (Saturday), which is good getting ready for area tournament.”Emily Pope led the Lady Warriors with 12 kills, while Morgan Swan had 21 digs.Sequoyah entered this year’s tournament as the two-time defending champion, but the Lady Chiefs fell to Etowah in straight sets to surrender their crown.“I think we’re still up-and-down, as we have been all year,” coach John Edwards said. “We tend to do better when we get pushed. We were able to come up with big plays when we needed to. That’s always good to see, as opposed to the other side, which would be to give up and let them beat you. There are some things we’re still working on, as far as controlling what we do.”The Hartman twins carried Sequoyah offensively with Kelley recording 27 kills and Lauren adding 20. Karen Morris recorded a team-high 14 digs in three matches, while Annika Lanning racked up 65 assists.Creekview had a lead in the third set against Sequoyah but it could not hold on for the win. Coach Morgan Green was pleased with her team’s performance, but she would have liked to have done better.“We’re doing OK,” Green said. “I had higher expectations, but we’re slowly getting there and making it work. We’re going through some learning processes still, but we’ve been able to turn it around and push through against Cherokee. It really showed we are making some changes we need to make.”Doraly Blanton led the Lady Grizzlies with 10 kills, and Hayley Hunter led the defense with 13 digs.River Ridge coach Julie Winfield also said her team could have played better.“The girls have played how I expected,” she said. “I wish we would have beat Woodstock to redeem ourselves from when we played them a few weeks ago, but we’re seeing good things.”Brittany Castro led the Lady Knights with 24 kills, while Tina Peterson had 42 digs.Despite the lack of a county championship, Winfield has plenty of confidence in her team to make the Class state playoffs.“I told the girls this is our prep time to get ready for the area tournament. I do think we’ll succeed in the area tournament. Whether we get first or second is up to the girls, but I think we’ll be successful there.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:27:02.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
