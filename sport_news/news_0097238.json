UMHB will host the Bulldogs in a 1:00 PM kickoff at Crusader Stadium in a rematch of last year’s NCAA Division III National Championships First Round Game. \nThe Cru is coming off a 54-6 victory over Louisiana College last Saturday in Pineville as UMHB improved to 6-0 overall and 2-0 in American Southwest Conference play on the year. The Cru swept two meetings from Texas Lutheran last season, posting a 72-16 regular season win in Seguin before outlasting the Bulldogs 27-20 in the postseason match-up. The playoff game stretched over two days due to multiple lightning delays. The Cru and Bulldogs are in direct competition for a playoff bid this season with the American Southwest Conference losing its automatic bid and you can expect a playoff type atmosphere in what could be a soggy Crusader Stadium this Saturday \n“All of the preparation in building a team leads up to being able to play in a game like this one,” Cru Head Coach Pete Fredenburg said. “Playing in a game like this, with this kind of importance is what you want. There won’t be any surprises between the two programs because we know each other so well. It is an opportunity for people to rise to the occasion and that’s what our players need to do this week.” \nTexas Lutheran enters the game with a 5-1 overall record. The Bulldogs are ranked 24 th in the country by D3football.com and are receiving votes and sit just outside the top 25 in the American Football Coaches Association this week. TLU has won back-to-back Southern Collegiate Athletic Conference championships and advanced to the NCAA postseason for the first time last year. The Bulldogs also have three former Cru players and coaches on their coaching staff. \nUMHB will enter the contest ranked #2 in the country by the AFCA and #3 in the nation by D3football.com. The Cru has a 60-game regular season winning streak, has won 44 straight regular season home contests and has never lost a regular season game at Crusader Stadium. \nFor more information on parking, traffic flow and game day events, please visit the following link: http://www.umhb.edu/stadium/game-day-information/#directions-parking . There will be parking reserved for Texas Lutheran University fans in the parking lot at the corner of Martin Luther King, Jr. Drive and College Drive. Bulldog fans are encouraged to enter the stadium through ticket window #3 at the southeast corner of Crusader Stadium. \nSaturday’s game will also be broadcast live on K101.7 FM and through the station’s web site with the pre-game show starting at 12:30 PM.
