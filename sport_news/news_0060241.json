The 21-year-old lost the next five games on the trot before signaling she could not continue.\n\"This is a sad day today,\" said Muguruza.\n\"I'm very sorry I had to retire today, but I had a really amazing week here in Wuhan.\n\"I really want to congratulate Venus. She's always such a tough player and she had an amazing week, as well.\n\"For sure we'll play again soon, and it's going to be a tough match, of course.\"\nCurrently ranked eighth in the world, Muguruza is projected to rise to a career-best fifth when the new rankings are released on Monday.\nWilliams will climb from 24th to 14th after capturing her first WTA title since Auckland in January and her first Premier-5 level event since Dubai in five years.\nWilliams chalked up her 700th career match win when she won her second round clash with Germany's Julia Goerges but had tough run to the final.\nShe was pushed to three sets by British qualifier Johanna Konta in the quarter-finals 6-4, 3-6, 7-5 then saved a match point in her semi-final victory over Italy's Roberta Vinci.\n\"It was a great week,\" Williams said. \"To win the tournament and have the 700th...so, some great moments this week.\"\n(Reporting by Julian Linden in Singapore; editing by Amlan Chakraborty )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T13:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:21:23.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
