Bay Area News Group Posted: 10/02/2015 06:51:27 PM PDT Updated: 10/02/2015 06:51:28 PM PDT Landon Donovan to the rescue of the Pittsburgh Steelers? \nProbably not, but a Steelers' fan tweeted the former Earthquakes' star after Pittsburgh lost to the Baltimore Ravens in overtime Thursday night, asking him in a roundabout way if he'd like to kick for her Steel City favorites. \"Has it been said yet the Steelers need a new kicker? Cue @landondonovan.\" \n\"I'm in,\" Donovan tweeted back on Friday. \nDonovan, who has retired from soccer, was presumably kidding. But at 33, he'd be a kid among NFL kickers. Sebastian Janikowski of the Raiders is 37. The 49ers' Phil Dawson is 40. \nPro Football Talk reported the Steelers had begun the search for a new kicker Friday after Josh Scobee missed two field goals in the fourth quarter Thursday night. Had he made one, Pittsburgh likely would have been the winner of a game that was tied 20-20 at the end of regulation.
