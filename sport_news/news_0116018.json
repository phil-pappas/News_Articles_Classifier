As one political observer ‎put it, \"They lost the bones and flesh.\"‎\nNour's chairman Younis Makhyoun said in a public ‎statement Monday night that \"although Nour lost ‎the one party list constituency it chose to contest in the ‎first stage — the Nile West Delta, as many as 25 out of ‎a total of 160 candidates who ran as independents ‎qualified for the run-off round.\" \"We have five in ‎Alexandria, nine in Beheira, four in Al-Fayoum, one in ‎Assuit, one in Beni Suef, one in Qena, two in the New ‎Valley, and two in Marsa Matrouh,” Makhyoun said.‎\nMakhyoun refused to answer questions on whether his ‎party will withdraw from the second round, scheduled ‎‎22-23 November. There has been a lot of talk in ‎Nour circles that Younis came under pressure in the ‎last few hours to withdraw from the polls. ‎\nMeanwhile, remnants of Mubarak's once ruling and now defunct ‎National Democratic Party (NDP) who ran as ‎independents failed to win a single seat. In ‎Alexandria, at least 10 candidates identified as NDP ‎diehards were kicked out of the race. Just one former ‎NDP candidate, Riza Dief Allah, and two Nour ‎independents qualified for the run-off round in Al-‎Amriyya district, west of Alexandria.‎\nThe biggest winners in Alexandria are candidates of ‎the Free Egyptians Party, founded by business tycoon ‎Naguib Sawiris, and the \"Future of the Homeland\" Party, ‎founded by a number of young political activists loyal to ‎President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi.‎\nIn general, as many as 65 independent candidates ‎fielded by the Free Egyptians Party were able to qualify ‎in the Nile West Delta and Upper Egypt governorates.‎\nNext to the Free Egyptians Party comes the old Wafd ‎Party whose 27 independent candidates qualified ‎for the run-off round.‎\nTwo independent leftists were able to qualify in ‎Alexandria: Kamal Ahmed, a former long-time Nasserist ‎MP in Attarian district, and Haytham Hariri, son of the ‎late leftist activist Abul Ezz Al-Hariri, in Karmooz ‎Moharrem Bey district.‎\nIn the governorate of Al-Minay in ‎Upper Egypt, Bahaa Fikri, a former NDP secretary-‎general, failed to qualify. Semi-official figures show that ‎independents fielded by the Free Egyptians and Wafd ‎parties qualified instead.‎\nIn Al-Minay's nearby governorate of Assuit, no NDP ‎diehards were able to win seats or even qualify.‎\nSemi-official reports show that former NDP officials ‎were able to win seats only as candidates on the party ‎list fielded by the \"For the Love of Egypt\" ‎coalition in the Nile West Delta and Upper Egypt. ‎\nTopping the list of successful \"For the Love of Egypt\" ‎Mubarak-era figures in Alexandria are industrialist and ‎chairman of Semouha Sporting Club Mohamed Farag ‎Amer, businesswoman Sahar Talaat Mostafa, ‎businessmen Farag Siidawi, Mohamed Al-Moghazi and ‎Mohamed Al-Zini in Beheira, and Ahmed Raslan in ‎Marsa Matrouh.‎\nThe victory of the \"For the Love of Egypt\" coalition also ‎came at the expense of the Egyptian Front and the ‎Independence Current Alliance, an umbrella grouping of ‎Mubarak-era figures.‎\nThe Egyptian Front is composed of two political parties ‎‎— the National Movement and Egypt My Homeland — ‎founded by Mubarak's last prime minister, Ahmed ‎Shafiq.‎\nAhmed Al-Fadalli, the alliance's coordinator, announced ‎Tuesday night that it might decide to withdraw from ‎the second stage, leaving the field wide open to \"For the ‎Love of Egypt\" coalition to win the remaining party list ‎constituencies with 60 seats.‎\nAl-Fadalli complained that HEC's approval that the ‎alliance contest the Upper Egypt party list ‎constituency just days ahead of the vote day ‎negatively affected its performance.‎\nThe Independence Current includes 42 low-key political ‎parties, most founded under the former regime of Hosni ‎Mubarak as democratic décor.‎\nSemi-official figures show that competition in the first ‎stage's run-off round will cover around 65 per cent of ‎independent constituencies — or around 444 seats. The ‎number of independent seats up for grabs in the first ‎stage stands at 226.‎", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:34:16.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
