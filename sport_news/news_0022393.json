(AP) - The state has purchased 5,000 kits of the opioid antidote naloxone, commonly known as Narcan, to distribute to friends and families of people at risk of an overdose. The kits are now available at the state's 10 community health centers for free.\nThe purchase of the Narcan is part of a statewide campaign announced Tuesday aimed at combating drug abuse. It cost $500,000 to purchase it, paid for with federal block grant money. The state also is launching a public awareness campaign that will include television ads, but officials couldn't immediately provide a cost estimate.\nMore than 300 people died from drug-related overdoses last year in New Hampshire and the state is on pace to match that number in 2015.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:30:01.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
