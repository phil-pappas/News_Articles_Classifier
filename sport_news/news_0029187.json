Stanley, who built the property in 1909.\nOf the four projects, the film center will tally the most out-of-state visitor days — 221,378 — for the lowest construction costs — $24.5 million — according to Anderson Analytics and HVS Convention, Sports & Entertainment Facilities Consulting.\nThe huge popularity of shows such as \"The Walking Dead\" and the ever-growing spending on Halloween each year point to the country's increasing fascination with being frightened.\n\"Avant-garde films are not the same draw as the horror genre,\" said Jon Nicholas, executive director of the Estes Park Economic Development Corp.\nThe proposed center will include a 500-seat auditorium, two outdoor amphitheaters and a 13,000-square-foot center that will house rare-film archives, interactive displays, movie memorabilia, and production facilities and classrooms.\nRendering of the Loveland water park ( Go NoCO ) Film industry heavyweights — including \"Lord of the Rings\" star Elijah Wood; \"Shaun of the Dead\" writer, director and star Simon Pegg; \"Night of the Living Dead\" director and writer George Romero; and Mick Garris, who directed the TV miniseries \"The Stand — have joined the film center's board.\nJohn Cullen, founder of the Grand Heritage Hotel Group, which owns the Stanley, has committed $13 million of his own money to finance the project.\nEven after Cullen's backing, the project is $11.3 million short. Go NoCO is asking Colorado taxpayers to cover $9.7 million the gap from the RTA, the biggest ask of state taxpayers among the four.\nSupporters argue the facility will be the first of its kind in the U.S. and could start within a year of incentive approvals.\nPeliGrande Resort & Windsor Conference Center\nMetro Denver, Colorado Springs, Aspen and Eagle County all host luxury resorts. But Weld and Larimer counties, despite the huge economic strides they have made the past decade, don't have one.\nSupporters promote the PeliGrande Resort as Northern Colorado's first four-star golf resort, a modern day Broadmoor with 300 rooms, a luxury spa and 58,500 square feet of meeting space.\n\"We are not doing the ordinary. We are doing the extraordinary,\" said Dave Jones, CEO of Senate Hospitality, the hotel's developer.\nJones told the commission the PGA will bring a Champions Tour event to the planned Raindance National Golf Course, which is being built as a separate project nearby.\nRendering of complex/theater addition to Stanley Hotel. ( Go NoCO ) Hosting the tour is expected to draw amateur golfers from around the country who like the bragging rights of having played on courses where the pros have. Also, Loveland has had one of the tightest hotel markets in the state, with little to offer on the high-end, supporters argue.\nBut for several months now, occupancy rates in both Larimer and Weld counties have softened with the price of oil, and several hotels are slated to open in the area, said Robert Benton, a hotel industry consultant in Parker who compiles the Rocky Mountain Lodging Report.\nThe resort is expected to bring in 46,080 net new out-of-state overnight stays a year and cost about $110 million, of which the state is being asked to fund $3.3 million, local governments $3.9 million and public improvement fees $19.4 million.\nOf the four projects, the PeliGrande is the one outside analysts question the most. For nearly a decade, more golf courses have closed than opened in the U.S., and millennials seem to show little interest in the sport.\n\"Does Colorado really need another golf course right now?\" asked Mike Cahill, CEO of Hospitality Real Estate Counselors in Greenwood Village.\nAt an average cost of $33,000 per room, Cahill also questions what level of luxury the resort can achieve, but concedes what passes as high-end in Windsor doesn't need to match Manhattan requires.\n\"Luxury is relative,\" he said.\nIndoor Waterpark Resort of the Rockies\nOne hot lodging trend, especially in parts of the country where temperatures are most frigid, are waterpark hotels where families can escape for a few days, Benton said.\nThe Resort Development Group is proposing a 300-room property with a 75,000-square-foot indoor waterpark and a 55,000-square-foot outdoor waterpark in Loveland.\nThe hotel is expected to cost $138.3 million, making it the most expensive of the four projects in Go NoCO. State taxpayers are being asked for $6.1 million, while local incentives worth $8.8 million and another $14.8 million in public improvement fees are expected to cover the funding shortfall.\nU.S. Whitewater Adventure Park\nColorado's rafting industry generates more than $100 million a year in revenues, but most of that money comes in just two months — May and June.\nThe U.S. Whitewater Adventure Park wants to provide a year-round alternative with a 20-acre artificial whitewater river system pumping 1,200 cubic feet of recycled water a second.\n\"It is a game changer, not only for northern Colorado, but for all of Colorado,\" said Scott Shipley, president of S2O Design in Lyons.\nThe $61 million park, visible from Interstate 25, will be adjacent to the Indoor Waterpark Resort of the Rockies and will be only one of four of its kind in the country built to Olympic standards. About $39.2 million in private debt and $9.8 million in private equity are backing the project, leaving a funding gap of $11.9 million.\nPublic improvement fees will cover $10 million, local subsidies about $817,000 and the state is being asked for $1 million under the RTA.\nShipley, who competed in three Summer Olympics, helped design the U.S. National Whitewater Center in Charlotte, N.C.\nThe Colorado Economic Development Commission is expected to give a thumbs up or down on the Go NoCO application on Nov. 12.\nAldo Svaldi: 303-954-1410, asvaldi@denverpost.com or @aldosvaldi", "external_links": ["http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1017/20151017__NoCo_development~p1_300.jpg", "https://www.hrec.com/company/", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1016/20151016__20151018_K4_BZ18GONOCOJPIC~p4.jpg", "http://extras.mnginteractive.com/live/media/site36/2015/1016/20151016__20151018_K4_BZ18GONOCOJPIC~p1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:06:36.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
