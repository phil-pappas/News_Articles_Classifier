When he returns to action on Sunday, the Jaguars will be squaring off against the Texans at EverBank Field.\nThe former Auburn standout suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in the final game of the 2014 NFL season. After having reconstructive knee surgery in the offseason, Marks will make his 2015 debut for Jacksonville on Sunday.\n\"I feel good about it,\" Marks said . \"After a good week or two weeks of practice, I feel like I'm ready. I went out and did a couple things to kind of clear my mind, so I feel real good about it. I've been practicing for it, I've been preparing for it, so I'm ready.\"\nRELATED: NFL WEEK 6 SCHEDULE, TV, ODDS\nMarks almost made it back last week against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After a full Wednesday practice preparing for the Bucs, though, the former Vigor High School star found out he wasn't quite ready.\nJacksonville coach Gus Bradley said Marks had now overcome the physical and mental hurdles standing in the way of his comeback.\n\"I think that last week he really wanted to play and didn't feel he was quite ready,\" Bradley said , \"so he kind of came back Wednesday and said 'I'm going to play this week.' It almost forced the battle mentally. Then, I guess it's, 'How long will it take?' I talked to him and said, 'I'm going to get after you pretty good to help you fight through it.' He said to me, 'You can say whatever you want, Gus. This is my own battle in my mind, and I've got to get it right.' He took that approach with it.\"\nJacksonville has won only one of its first five games this season. The Jaguars are hoping a return to form by Marks, who has been acknowledged as the team's best player over the previous two seasons, will help spark a turnaround.\nMarks led Jacksonville with 8.5 sacks, 15 tackles for loss and 16 quarterback hurries to go with 44 tackles last season. He finished third among NFL defensive interior linemen in sacks, behind the 10 of All-Pro Marcell Dareus , a former Huffman High School and Alabama standout, of the Buffalo Bills and the nine of NFL Defensive Rookie of the Year Aaron Donald of the St. Louis Rams. Marks was an alternate for the Pro Bowl last season.\nFOR MORE OF AL.COM'S COMPREHENSIVE COVERAGE OF THE NFL, GO TO OUR NFL PAGE\nBefore being injured, Marks had started all 32 games since he joined the Jaguars after four seasons with the Tennessee Titans.\n\"I've had a good two weeks of practice,\" Marks said . \"I'm 100 percent ready, but I still don't know what to expect.\"\nThe Texans and Jaguars kick off in Jacksonville at noon CDT Sunday.", "external_links": ["http://jacksonville.com/sports/football/jaguars/2015-10-16/story/jaguars-notebook-team-makes-london-plans", "http://www.jaguars.com/news/article-JaguarsNews/-Thursday-takeaways-Marks-fights-mental-hurdle/05726204-8501-4838-bb1e-09ddd5bb2bde", "http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/184016/jaguars-senderrick-marks-says-hes-ready-for-his-season-debut"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:28:47.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
