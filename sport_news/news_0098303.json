According to News.com.au, Australia will play their upcoming domestic match (Sheffield Shield) and annual cricket match i.e Prime Minister's XI with a pink ball as a preparation for first ever day-night Test between Australia and New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval from November 27. Voges, who has an experience of playing with the pink ball for Western Australia, revealed that his bowlers are practicing with the ball at night time to get an idea of it. He also advised skipper Steven Smith to score as much as he could during the day time because batting at night could turn out to be extremely difficult. The 36-year-old stressed that it would be tough for batsmen to pick up the pink ball as the depth perception of the ball is quite different under lights. In a bid to revive dwindling interest in Test cricket, Australia and New Zealand had earlier agreed to meet in the first day-night game.
