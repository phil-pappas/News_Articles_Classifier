SAC Invitational Women’s cross country squad wins title, men place second Posted: October 21, 2015 9:24   21, 2015 9:24 p.m. College of the Canyons took home the 2015 Mt. SAC Invite ‘sweepstakes’ title as the program with the best men’s and women’s overall performance for a second consecutive year — and for the second time in school history. Photo by Mike Whitman/COC Sports Information Office A A A \nThe College of the Canyons cross country program turned in a historic performance at last week’s 68th Annual Mt. SAC Invitational, with the women’s squad winning the team title for the first time in school history and the men’s team taking second place. \nThe Cougars also ran away with the event’s ‘sweepstakes’title as the program with the best men’s and women’s overall performance for a second consecutive year — and second time in school history. \nThe 2014 Mt. SAC sweepstakes title COC won last season (men’s first place/women’s third place) was the first in the history of the program. \nThe Mt. SAC Invite, which annually attracts more than 500 runners from two-dozen schools around the state, was held on Friday in Walnut. \nOn the women’s side, COC won the event with a team score of 36, to best second place Hartnell College (81) and host Mt. SAC (102). \nAdditionally, Canyons saw its top five runners each place in the top 15. Freshman Jessica Ruiz turned in another strong performance, placing fourth with a time of 18 minutes, 22 seconds on the three-mile course. COC sophomore Lexi Whitman was the next Cougar to cross the finish line, taking sixth place with a time of 18:45. \nNot far behind were freshman Chelsea Wells with an eighth place mark of 18:56, and sophomore Amanda De Jesus in ninth place at 19:00. Lizeth Flores rounded out the Canyons top five in 15th place at 19:31. \nThe second place team performance turned in by the men’s side was highlighted by the second place individual finish of COC sophomore Ethan Walker who posted a time of 20:44 on the four-mile course. Walker has now finished in the top two at three events this season. \nCOC sophomores Joseph Rosales (21:25) and Jason Hillquist (21:30) finished 12th and 13th, respectively. \nAlso included in the Canyons top five were freshman Alejandro Bernal’s time of 21:38 to take 15th and fellow freshman Nick Liebmann’s 16th place time of 21:41. \nAs a team, COC’s 57 points trailed only Mt. SAC’s first place total of 37. Hartnell took third place with 83 points. \nCanyons will next participate in the Western State Conference Finals on Friday, at Legg Lake Park in Whittier. \nHeading into the conference finals the men’s team is currently ranked No. 4 in Southern California, with the women’s team ranked No. 2. \nWomen’s Soccer \nThe COC women’s soccer team is also knocking on history’s door. \nOn Tuesday, the Cougars exploded for 10 goals — including seven in the first half — in a 10-0 home victory vs. an overmatched West L.A. squad. \nThat scoring output was the first time Canyons had netted double-digit goals since Oct. 15, 2013, and only the second time the Cougars have done so since 2011. \nCoincidentally, the 2013 milestone was also achieved in a 10-0 victory against West L.A. \nCOC sophomore Mari Kneisel entered Tuesday’s match just four goals shy of tying the program’s all-time career goals mark of 36, set by forward Stacey Atwater in 2013. \nThe sophomore scored her first goal of the game, and 13th of the season, less than nine minutes into the first half to push the COC lead to 2-0. \nThe Cougars also received a pair of unassisted first half goals from Kailey Marquez, brining her season total to six. \nAlso scoring for Canyons in the first half were freshman Amanda Balzar and sophomore Astrid Perez. \nBut in the 33rd minute it was Kneisel again, finding the back of the net on a penalty kick. Roughly 90 seconds later Kneisel booted another ball in to get the hat trick, and draw within one goal of the scoring record. \nKneisel, the reigning WSC Player of the Year, is already the program’s career leader in points with 93 (35 goals and 23 assists). \nCanyons (7-1-4, 5-0-2) is currently tied with L.A. Valley College for first place in the WSC, South division. \nThe Cougars are in the midst of a three-game win streak and have not lost since a 1-0 defeat at Santa Barbara on Sept. 18. Canyons has outscored its opponents 34-8 during that span, while posting four consecutive shutouts. \nCOC will host Citrus College at 4 p.m. on Friday. \nMen’s Soccer \nThe COC men’s soccer has put together a lengthy undefeated streak of its own, with the Cougars not having dropped a match since a 2-0 loss at Glendale, also on Sept. 18. \nCanyons (3-4-6, 3-2-5) currently sits in fourth place in the WSC, South. The Cougars are five games behind first place Oxnard College, but just two games behind second place L.A. Mission. \nOn Tuesday, Canyons played to a 0-0 draw with visiting Glendale College. \nCOC continues to feature a strong defensive front that, for the most part, has been effective in keeping opponents away from the net. \nCanyons has not surrendered a goal in six of its last seven contests, thanks in large part to the play of freshman goalkeeper Cristian Arriaga, who has posted five shutouts in nine starts while saving 49 shots in 13 total games. \nArriaga’s five shutouts rank third in the conference, while his 49 saves place him fourth. \nCanyons will next travel to face Santa Barbara at 7 p.m. Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:48:48.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
