Iriarte left island after his junior year to pursue football in Hawaii in hopes of playing the sport at the next level. He already has a few scholarship offers but continues to grind on the football field one game at a time. \nIriarte said, \"Football has been pretty good. The level of talent here is pretty high but we still have a few players on Guam who can probably make it out here and make it big. The games and everything have a lot of hype and it's a big deal. Hawaii is the 5th state that produces D-1 athlete so we face the big boys and the kids are fast. All of my teammates we work really hard and we take everything serious and it's all business for us. We don't take things lightly and we practice day in and day out. We have 3 hour practices and we also have study hall to keep the boys in check so that they make the grades to play that weekend. We lift every Monday and Tuesday to get stronger and then on top of that the coaches expect us to watch film at home and to study the defenses and the other opponents that we are going to face.\" \nIriarte has led Radford to a 9-0 record during the regular season and will be heading into the playoffs this Saturday for their first playoff game against Waialua.
