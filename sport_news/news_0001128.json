They’ve been good pitchers.”\nThat one-season growth of the Mets’ staff makes the Cubs’ road to the World Series at least as treacherous next year, and the year after. And don’t forget the Mets get another stud, Zack Wheeler, back from Tommy John surgery next year.\n“Listen, with good health, these guys will be here for many years to come,” Maddon said. “No question.”\nThat’s not to suggest the Cubs won’t be better next season – or even to suggest they won’t be the chic pick to win the National League pennant, especially if they add another significant pitcher to their own rotation.\nBut as young and dangerous as the Cubs have become, by design of Theo Epstein’s fourth-year Plan, so have many of the other teams in the National League – making the work Epstein and his front office do this winter even more significant than the Jon Lester-Miguel Montero-Dexter Fowler winter of a year ago.\n“There are many great teams – great, not just good – in the National League, and teams that have a chance to be great,” said Epstein during the team president’s annual post-season media briefing late in the week. “The Cardinals aren’t going anywhere; they haven’t for 100 years. They have a pretty young core. They’re going to be aggressive and motivated this winter. They’re never going away.\n“Pittsburgh has had three outstanding seasons in a row and have the building blocks in place to be good for a really long time. The Giants are three-time World Series champs, and I’m sure are going to add a number of key pieces this winter The Dodgers are extremely talented and extremely rich; they’re not going anywhere.\n“The Nationals’ window hasn’t necessarily ended at all; they’re still really good, and I’m sure they’ll bounce back from this year. The Mets, if they can keep their rotation healthy and performing the way it is now, are going to be dangerous as can be for a long period of time.\n“I’m sure I’ve left others out.”\nNot many. Epstein named nearly half the Cubs’ opponents in what he calls “an incredibly competitive landscape” just in the their league alone.\n“And that motivates us,” he said.\nOne of the keys about that landscape is a youthful trend that is not unique to the Cubs. The Pirates and Mets both have built their cores through drafting, trades for minor-leaguers, and player development, much like the Cubs.\nThe Cardinals have been doing that for decades, and just when it seems tempting to suggest the Cards’ core is aging away, consider that five of the position players on their playoff roster were 26 or younger, as was their closer and top two setup men. And two of their best starting pitchers this year turned 24 during the season.\nThree rookies hit five home runs for the Cards in the four playoff games against the Cubs – exactly the same as the Cubs in that series.\nThe Giants’ entire infield is made up of 20-something homegrown players, along with their MVP catcher and much of their pitching. The Nationals have the presumptive MVP in Bryce Harper, who turned 23 only this month and already is a three-time All-Star.\nIt was a common refrain – and not necessarily wrong – that the balance of power, at least in the NL Central, has shifted with the Cubs’ rise. But this is a team that for all its 97 wins, still finished in third place.\nAfter the Cubs eliminated the Pirates and Cards in back-to-back rounds, World Series veteran David Ross wasn’t willing to so quickly say a changing of the guard was in play.\n“Obviously, it’s the best division in baseball for a reason,” he said. “What I feel we’re witnessing is a change in culture, of expectations. These guys expect to win. The city expects us to win. That’s what we’re doing. That’s what’s special to be a part of.\n“What these guys should be most proud of is that they’re changing a lot of history of losing.”\nWhat will set this newly competitive Cubs team from past versions is how quickly and significantly the early-20s core can get even better, how much Epstein’s crew can make happen over the winter and into the next trading deadline, and what kind of appetite ownership has for being as aggressive as it takes to stay competitive in the shark-infested waters of the National League.\nNot one pitcher on the Cubs’ playoff roster, for instance, was homegrown. At least for the next two or three years, any championship-quality pitching the Cubs add almost certainly must be bought or traded for.\nWill they have enough resources to go after this winter’s top free agent, David Price? Or even the Nationals’ big-ticket Jordan Zimmermann, a right-hander they’ve coveted in recent years, who might command something less than Price?\nThey need at least two big-arm starters and at least three established bullpen guys to feel confident of having a pennant-caliber team. And that doesn’t include the center field issue or shoring up the outfield defense in general – their top two non-pitching areas of concern.\n“Just in our division, like the Cardinals and Pirates, we have to try to attain a really high standard,” Epstein said of the plan this winter to elevate a team with already lofty expectations, even as it’s currently constructed.\n“Certainly, we need to raise the bar as far as the type of team we want to build and the path to being a great club – not just being a good club, if possible,” he said.\n“We have to put ourselves in a position where we have a chance to be great. So we can win the division and not have to go through the coin flip of being in the wild-card game. I’m not saying you can always get there. Some things are beyond your control. We’ll see how things shake out.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:01:53.704+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
