Gabriel Fernandes had the first shot of game in the 5th minute when he blazed a long searching ball from the back over the Kerala Blasters FC goal.The visitors continued with their early pressure and called Kerala keeper Stephen Bywater into action in the 12th minute.\nMumbai kept pushing on, looking more likely of the two sides to break the deadlock. Norde's pace and strength made life difficult for Kerala defenders Rahul Bheke and Gurwinder Singh. His shot in the 38th minute could have easily found the back of the net had it been a yard to the right or left of Bywater.\nBoth managers rang in the changes in the second half to alter the course of the game. Kerala gaffer Peter Taylor replaced Manandeep Singh with Ishfaq Ahmed while Mumbai City FC's marquee player-cum-coach Nicolas Anelka bought on Ashutosh Mehta and Selim Benachour for Aitor Fernandez Lopez and Thangjam Singh.\nSingam had a golden opportunity in the 76th minute to put the visitors ahead when he was through one-on-one with Kerala keeper Bywater. Only a last-ditch tackle by Kerala's skipper Peter Ramage saved the home-team's blushes as the score remained 0-0.\nNorde could have put the game to bed two minutes from time but the Haitian failed to wrap his foot around the ball as his shot was dragged wide of the target.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:19:04.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
