The weather was a factor throughout and a two-hour lightning delay killed any chance CCHS had in the contest. \nCCHS received the opening kickoff but their first series stalled after a screen from Tyler Howard didn’t pick up enough yardage to move the chains. \nEast Hamilton would take the Jeremiah Baird punt, the Hurricanes would dink and dunk their way up the field before the Jets held them to three points on a field goal attempt. \nThe Jets second possession would not result in a first down and Baird was forced to punt a second time. However, the Canes partially blocked his kick, and East Hamilton ended up with excellent field position. \nCCHS simply couldn’t hang with the East Hamilton wideouts on Friday. Before you knew it, the Hurricanes had completed a long ball to the CCHS 23 yard line, ending the first quarter. \nThe Canes would have a touchdown erased after one of their wide receivers pushed off on the Jets Daniel Richards, only to score two plays later making it a 17-0 ball game. \nJake Kerley and Dylan Wyatt produced most of the Jets offensive yardage on the ground. However, multiple penalties and turnovers would keep the Jets moving backward all night. \nAfter yet another Baird punt, the Hurricanes would pop off a run to the Jet four yard line, resulting in another touchdown for the Canes. \nWith 36 seconds left in the half, things would go from bad to worse for the Jets. Lightning, strong winds and heavy rainfall would delay the contest for just over two hours. \nAfter the break, Daniel Richards blocked an East Hamilton punt, resulting in the Jets only points of the night and a 17-7 score. \nTy Tabor, Cole Parton and the rest of the defense did their best to try and stop a potent East Hamilton offense but the Hurricanes proved to be too much in this one. \nCumberland County would eventually fall to 4-3 on the season with a final score of 24-7. \nThe CCHS Jets will host Livingston on Oct. 16.
