(AP) - Rutgers converted three fourth-quarter turnovers into touchdowns and kicker Kyle Federico capped an improbable comeback by making a 26-yard field goal as time expired Saturday for a 55-52 victory at Indiana. \nThe Scarlet Knights (3-3, 1-2 Big Ten) tied a school record by rallying from a 25-point deficit in the final 20Â½ minutes. \nFederico won it after having two extra points blocked. \nChris Laviano led Rutgers by going 28 of 42 for 386 yards with three touchdowns and one interception. \nBut it was a botched snap on a rare Indiana punt that turned the game. Kemoko Turay scooped it up and scored on a 26-yard return to make it 52-39. \nRutgers then took advantage of both of Nate Sudfeld's interceptions to tie the score at 52. \nSudfeld was 32 of 42 for a career high 464 yards with four TDs for Indiana (4-3, 0-3), which lost its third straight.
