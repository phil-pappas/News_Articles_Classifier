Cross said he thinks this team is capable of a championship and these last 3 games will show what this team is made of. \n\"We think we are good enough to compete for a championship,\" Cross said. \"We have shown that this year. And even in our losses, if we had a little luck on our side we could have won. We can beat anyone on any given day.\" \nThe Miners are still far from a championship, but if they continue the play they have shown all season long, Coach Cross's comments are not hard to believe. \nThe Lady Miners wrap up the season hosting Charlotte, Old Dominion and finally Middle Tennessee.
