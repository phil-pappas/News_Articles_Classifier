But some residents aren't happy about the vote.\nRobert Brown, of St. Charles, said he would work to replace the mayor and five alderman who voted in favor of the measure.\n\"We want to be pride of the Fox,\" Brown said. \"We want to be a beautiful community that draws people in … We don't want to be video gamblers.\"\nIn the 5-5 vote, with Rogina acting as the tie-breaker, the St. Charles City Council cast its final vote after months of debate about whether the city should allow video gambling machines in its bars and restaurants.\nCommittee approves video gambling in St. Charles Alexa Aguilar St. Charles is poised to approve video gambling at its next City Council meeting after another long committee meeting Monday night in which both sides made their plea.\nAldermen voted 5-4 to advance a measure to allow video gambling at St. Charles bars and restaurants that receive a gaming license...\nSt. Charles is poised to approve video gambling at its next City Council meeting after another long committee meeting Monday night in which both sides made their plea.\nAldermen voted 5-4 to advance a measure to allow video gambling at St. Charles bars and restaurants that receive a gaming license...\n(Alexa Aguilar) \"Video gaming will only be divisive if people allow it to be,\" Rogina told the assembled crowd.\nAlderman did add the caveat that video gambling would only be legal if the state passes a budget and that municipalities continue to receive their 1/6th share of the proceeds.\nThe state collects 30 percent of the net income from the gambling machines, but is supposed to forward 5 percent of that amount to the municipality where the gambling takes place.\nIn Darien, which first opposed video gambling when the state approved it in 2009 and eventually allowed it at seven locations, reported earlier this month that the state is behind in paying municipalities their share because of the budget stalemate in Springfield.\nDarien's budget for this fiscal year forecasts $75,000 in tax revenue from video gambling.

Previous meetings lasted for hours, as proponents and opponents voiced their opinions. They fell into two camps: those who felt the money would provide a boost to local businesses and those who said that gambling could create social problems and didn't fit with St. Charles reputation as family friendly.\nThe residents who spoke Monday said they were disappointed by the vote, and St. Charles' image is now tarnished. But the mayor disagreed.\n\"As to the assumption of the impact on the town's image, I have been blunt in my response: this town's image cannot be tarnished,\" Rogina said, adding that the council has made and moved on from emotional and controversial decisions, such as voting for the Red Gate bridge or allowing Lazarus House, the town's homeless shelter, to be downtown.\nVideo slot machines spin through some suburbs Kimberly Fornek Video gambling is alive and well in the western suburbs.\nDarien had seven places with video gambling licenses, Oakbrook Terrace had nine and Countryside had 17 as of the end of August.\nFor the businesses that installed video poker and slot machines, the gambling has brought in additional revenue.\n... Video gambling is alive and well in the western suburbs.\nDarien had seven places with video gambling licenses, Oakbrook Terrace had nine and Countryside had 17 as of the end of August.\nFor the businesses that installed video poker and slot machines, the gambling has brought in additional revenue.\n... (Kimberly Fornek) Most of the aldermen who voted in favor have previously said they did so because of the dire forecast from the state about decreased money coming to municipalities. Those projections mean the city has to look elsewhere for funds, the aldermen said.\nSt. Charles staff have projected that the city could receive more than $100,000 if it allowed the machines in its bars and restaurants.\nAlexa Aguilar is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.
