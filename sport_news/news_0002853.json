In the movie Self/Less, an older man tries to stay young by uploading his consciousness to a younger body. Can technology prevent humans from aging? DCI The \"hearty\" differences became apparent only after researchers studied nearly 3,000 adults for about 10 years. By the end of the study, published online today (Oct. 20) in the journal Radiology , the researchers found that male and female hearts grow differently over time.\n7 Ways Your Body Betrays You\nThe study focused on one heart chamber, the left ventricle, which pumps oxygenated blood out of the heart into the body. As people age, the left ventricle declines in its capacity to pump blood.\nBut the researchers found that this decline happens differently depending on a person's sex: In men, the heart muscle around the chamber grows larger and thicker with age, while in women the muscle maintains its size or gets smaller, the researchers found. [ Your Heart Health: 5 Numbers to Know ]\nIt's unclear why these sex-based differences occur, but this \"fascinating discrepancy\" may help researchers determine whether gender-specific therapies are necessary for men and women who have heart problems, the researchers said.\nEven A 5-Minute Run Is Good For Heart Health\n\"Our results are a striking demonstration of the concept that heart disease may have different pathophysiology in men and women, and of the need for tailored treatments that address such important biologic differences,\" senior study author Dr. Jo√£o Lima, a professor of medicine and radiological science at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore and director of cardiovascular imaging at the school's Heart and Vascular Institute, said in a statement.\nThe study is the first long-term research using MRI scans to observe left ventricle structure and function over time, the researchers said. Other researchers have examined people's hearts using ultrasound scans, but MRI scans are more detailed, the researchers in the new study said.\nThe study included 2,935 adults ages 45 to 84 years. None of the participants had cardiovascular diseases when they enrolled in the study. The doctors performed an MRI scan on each participant at the beginning and end of the study.\nPage 1 / 2 Previous / Next Tags men and women blood aging Human Body Physiology Anatomy Health heart ", "external_links": ["http://static.ddmcdn.com/en-us/news/js/ad9f4f9-1ca3333.js", "http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/dnews-anti-aging-tech-large-192x108.jpg", "http://pubs.rsna.org/doi/abs/10.1148/radiol.2015150982", "http://malsup.github.com/jquery.form.js", "http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2", "http://static.ddmcdn.com/en-us/news/img/video-icon.png", "http://www.livescience.com/43025-5-numbers-healthy-heart.html", "https://discovery.csharmony.epsilon.com/Account/Register?b=news", "http://www.livescience.com/39074-what-is-an-mri.html"], "published": "2015-10-21T17:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:48:29.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
