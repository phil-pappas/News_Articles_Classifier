He’s the only tight end who has seen significant playinig time or targets in the early part of the season. \nKern caught his first career pass for UA, an 11-yarder, in the second quarter of the season-opening win over UTSA. \nThere was a belief that the Cats might start to utilize the position in the pass game more after the tight ends saw frequent action in the spring including ten receptions between the group in the annual Spring Game. \nBut UA lost a big target to injury during Fall Camp when sophomore Trevor Wood was shut down for the season with a shoulder injury. \nThe primary offensive role for Kern and backups Matt Morin and Darrell Cloy has been blocking. \nOur David Kelly asked head coach Rich Rodriguez about the status of the tight end in the passing game plus got reaction from Kern on his first collegiate catch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T12:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:24:58.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
