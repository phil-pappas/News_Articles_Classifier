There have been no cosmic signs or bad omens to speak of in this National League Championship Series, certainly nothing worthy of a documentary or public rally. And please stop talking about curses.\nIn winning the first three games, the Mets have reduced this series to its simplest terms. They have rendered 1969 and 2003 and 106-year droughts or any other historical reference irrelevant. These Mets are better than the Cubs because of powerful starting pitchers and a team that executes in the clutch unlike its young, less experienced opponent. They also have New York's new Mr. October, Daniel Murphy, reprising Reggie Jackson while the Cubs have managed a meager five hits per game.\n\"We're not hitting the ball as we normally can,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said in the understatement of the postseason.\nNor are the Cubs catching the ball the way playoff teams must or manufacturing runs in familiar fashion. Suddenly, nothing works.\nNot even Wayne Messmer's microphone worked for the first few notes of the national anthem, requiring him to start over with one that did. Things only went downhill from there on the field.\nNo, Cubs, no. What a waste of ideal conditions for October baseball.\nA game-time temperature of 73 degrees — 28 degrees warmer than Game 2 in New York — with a light breeze created a picture-postcard backdrop to start a playoff game. This was the North Side's boys of summer playing deeper into autumn than ever before at home, showing an early spring in their step partly because they didn't have to dress for winter. In other words, this was Soler Weather.\nJorge Soler withered in the chilly winds of New York, with Maddon admitting he benched him in Game 2 \"based on the cold.\" Mother Nature helped write Soler's name into the sixth spot in the order for Game 3 while Maddon simply held the pen. He referred to it as his \"Fahrenheit lineup.\"\n\"There is a decent opportunity he could put the ball over the wall,\" Maddon predicted pregame.\nFour hours later, Soler did just that, showing how well he sees the ball when not wearing a ski mask and stamping Maddon's shrewd move with a game-tying home run to center field. Then the fun stopped at Clark and Addison.\nMets starter Jacob deGrom slowly got into the groove, keeping the Cubs guessing the way Matt Harvey and Noah Syndergaard did in Games 1 and 2. Other than two solo home runs, Cubs hitters were deGrominated, managing a meager four hits in seven innings off the pitcher.\nThe Mets have no obvious villains, so rowdy fans unleashed the most venomous boos toward plate umpire Ted Barrett, whose calls reminded everybody how much the human element still dictates what's a ball or a strike. But lousy umpiring didn't hurt the Cubs as much as poor fielding and paltry hitting.\nThe Cubs couldn't even use the home field to their advantage. Wrigley's confines seldom have been friendlier than they were in a wild sixth inning when ivy saved the Cubs a run. That's the ivy, not Ivy, the Cubs' computer data base named after the green stuff that grows on the outfield wall.\nSoler dived to catch Mets shortstop Wilmer Flores' sinking liner but missed badly, and the ball rolled to the right-field wall. Hustling over, center fielder Dexter Fowler convincingly raised his arms when he lost sight of the ball in the ivy. Umpires declared Flores' hit a ground-rule double, which meant Michael Conforto, who easily would have scored, had to return to third base.\nPerhaps it was appropriate because Conforto was on base only after Trevor Cahill's wild pitch — one catcher Miguel Montero thought he should have handled — went to the screen on a swinging third strike, allowing Yoenis Cespedes to score the go-ahead run.\nMets manager Terry Collins argued the ground-rule-double call vehemently enough to be ejected in a regular-season game, but to no avail. Though it defied common sense, the umps made the correct call according to the rulebook. Ground rules for the 101-year-old ballpark clearly state any ball that goes into the ivy and stays there results in the batter and all runners getting two bases if the outfielder never attempts to retrieve it. Fowler, as savvy as they come, never did.\nWhat seemed like a significant moment at the time became moot an inning later.\nThat's when Kyle Schwarber botched one of several plays that magnified the Cubs' defensive limitations at the worst possible time. First, Soler misjudged Flores' liner, then Kris Bryant double-clutched a ground ball Murphy beat out for a single before Schwarber misplayed Cespedes' fly ball into an RBI single.\nSchwarber supplied the Cubs' first run with an opposite-field home run, but his misadventure in left field left a deeper impression. As Schwarber covered his mouth with his glove to yell something in frustration, he knew. Everybody in the crowd of 42,231 knew.\nIt's (not) gonna happen after all. It will take all of Maddon's innovation to manage even one victory now — a well he has gone to often.\nBetween the time the \"Rocky\" theme played after the Game 2 loss in New York to the moment it blared through the ballpark during Tuesday's introductions, Maddon continued to take quirky measures to motivate his team — and even himself. Players walked into the clubhouse before Game 3 to find a picture on the wall of Bauldie Moschetti. Maddon credits Moschetti, his semipro manager in 1975 when he was a catcher for the Boulder Collegians, for the opportunity to sign a free-agent contract with the Angels after that season.\n\"That's my own personal motivation going into these next couple games,\" Maddon said of the photo he bought on eBay.\nThat's vintage Maddon, cleverly creating a stress-free environment in which players thrive. A master of diverting attention from his team, Maddon turned a simple question about personal motivational tactics into a 576-word response.\nHe reflected on the impact of Steve Schnall, Maddon's freshman football coach at Lafayette College. He revealed how his time in the Angels organization as a roving instructor exposed him to managing styles he liked and loathed. He learned from his own mistakes through trial and error, like the time in 1986 while managing Double-A Midland (Texas) when he pasted local classified ads in the clubhouse to show his disappointing players they had job alternatives.\n\"I was wrong,\" Maddon said. \"But as you go forward, I'd never seen an uptight moment be beneficial to any group. Never.\"\nLike never before, Maddon now needs some magic to keep the Cubs loose and positive on the brink of elimination. Leader Anthony Rizzo offered some help.\n\"One New York team has blown a 3-0 lead,\" Rizzo said. \"Let's make it the other New York team.\"\nRizzo knows his history. Only the 2004 Red Sox — a team Cubs President Theo Epstein knows something about — have recovered from a 3-0 deficit to win a league championship series, doing it against the Yankees. No other team has even forced a Game 7.\n\"Win on Wednesday — that's it,\" Maddon said. \"I'm really happy it's not a five-game series.\"\nAs the skies continued to empty, that was the only bright spot.\ndhaugh@tribpub.com\nTwitter @DavidHaugh\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Joe Maddon New York Mets Wilmer Flores Daniel Murphy Wrigley Field", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56272344/turbine/ct-cubs-mets-nlcs-haugh-spt-1021-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-21T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:36:57.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
