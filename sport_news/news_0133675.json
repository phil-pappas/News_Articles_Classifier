I wanted to win it for myself, not just for the fans,\" she said. \nTseng, who broke down in tears after Saturday's dismal round of 76, started slowly Sunday when starting on the back nine, missing short putts on 10 and 11. To compound her misery, she sprayed her tee shot on the par-5 12th far to the right, but it was kept in play by a fortuitous bounce of the trees. \nThat seemed to revive the former world No. 1, who birdied the 12th, 13th, 15th, 16th and 18th holes sandwiched around a bogey on 17th, which left her 1-over for the tournament with nine holes to go. \nTseng's performance took a turn for the worse on the front nine, when she carded three birdies, two bogeys and one triple bogey to finish the tournament with a total score of 3-over 291. \n\"This week I really failed off the tee. I hit six tee shots out of bounds and two others in the water,\" Tseng said. \n\"I just hope I don't bring those errant drives with me into the next few weeks,\" she said. \nStuck in a winless streak on the LPGA Tour that has lasted more than three years, Tseng has been encouraged by a recent run of good form and had expressed ambitions last week to win the Taiwan tournament. \nTseng has finished in the top five of three of her last four LPGA Tour events, including a second-place finish at the LPGA KEB Hana Bank Championship in South Korea, which concluded on Oct. 18. \nAlthough disappointed at her performance in Taiwan this time, Tseng said she was deeply moved by her fans. \n\"I really want to thank my fans. They gave me huge encouragement on the golf course. They tell me, \"It's OK.\" They are happy just to see me regardless of how I performed. I was moved,\" she said.
