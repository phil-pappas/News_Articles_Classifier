It appears Las Vegas oddsmakers believe the same thing and expect this weekend's game to be a historic scoring fest in Waco. \nAccording to KVUE news partner the Austin American-Statesman , Oddsharks placed the over/under for the game at 88.5 points. The over/under allows fans to bet on how many total points will be scored by both teams combined. The person betting can choose to bet the teams will score fewer than 88.5 points combined or more than 88.5 points. \nThe previous record for a game also involved Baylor and was 88 in 2012 against Oklahoma State. \nBased on the first few games of the season, Baylor is averaging 64 points per game, tops in the nation, while Texas Tech is averaging 53.8 points per game. On the flip side, Baylor is giving up just 23 points per game, while Texas Tech is giving up 36 points per game, 108th in the nation out of 128 teams. \nIn Texas Tech's last game, the team surrendered more than 700 yards of offense and gave up 55 points in the game.
