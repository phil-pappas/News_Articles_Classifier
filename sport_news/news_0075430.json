(AP) - Jordi Quintilla scored the winner in the eighth round of penalty kicks, Tim Melia made two saves in the tiebreaker and Sporting Kansas City beat the Philadelphia Union on Wednesday night for their third U.S. Open Cup title.\nSporting KC won the shootout 7-6 after the teams played to a 1-1 tie.\nJohn McCarthy was brought into the game in goal at the very end of extra time after leading Philadelphia to two shootout wins in the tournament, but stopped only Krisztian Nemeth as the Union lost the championship game at home for the second straight year.\nNemeth tied it in the 65th minute, tucking a curler past starting goalkeeper Andre Blake for his fourth goal in four U.S. Open Cup games.\nSebastien Le Toux opened the scoring in the 23rd minute when he ran onto a perfect long ball from fellow Frenchman Vincent Nogueira and beat Melia to the far post. Le Toux has 16 career goals in the competition.\nSporting Kansas City earned one of the United States' four spots in the 2016-17 CONCACAF Champions League.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
