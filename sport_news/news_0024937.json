The Lynx had to wait several nail-biting moments as the referees huddled around a monitor at mid-court before saying the shot was good. \n\"Everything fell on the line, did what I could,\" Moore said. \"Fortunately I have a pretty quick release and it worked out.\" \nThat shot ended a thrilling game and put Minnesota in a position to clinch the title in Game 4 on Sunday. \n\"It was an unbelievable basketball game,\" Minnesota coach Cheryl Reeve said. \"Might be one of the best WNBA finals games in our history. That one's got to be up there. Two teams that had great offense and just delivering blows to each other.\" \nMinnesota is trying to win its third title in five years. The team that has won Game 3 has won 70 percent of the titles since the WNBA went to a best-of-five format in 2005. Indiana is trying to become the first No. 3 seed to win a title. The first 18 championships were won by either one or two seeds. \nAs had been the case in the first two of the games in the series where each team won by six points, this one came down to the end. Neither team led by more than five points in the fourth quarter. Minnesota trailed 77-74 with 2:08 left before Renee Montgomery hit a 3-pointer to tie it with 1:11 left. \nBoth teams missed shots over the next 40 seconds before Indiana had the ball with 25 seconds left. Shenise Johnson's jumper from the corner was partially tipped with a few seconds left and the ball went out of bounds giving Minnesota one last chance to win in regulation, which Moore took. \n\"That was a great player making a great play at the end of the game,\" Fever coach Stephanie White said. \"I'm proud of how hard we fought.\" \nMoore didn't do much in the first three quarters after playing just 12 minutes because of foul trouble. The 2014 MVP scored 12 points in the final period to lift the Lynx. Seimone Augustus added 13 points, and Montgomery had 12. \nJohnson finished with 17 points to lead Indiana. Tamika Catchings added 10 points and 10 rebounds. SHARE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T13:03:28.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
