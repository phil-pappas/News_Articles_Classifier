The fate of 586 candidates will be decided in 49 assembly constituencies by a total of 1.35 crore voters.\nAs per the 2010 Assembly Election results, Bhartiya Janata Party had won 13, Janata Dal (United) 29, Rashtriya Janata Dal 4 seats each while Congress, Communist Party of India and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha one one seat each. But the equation has changed drastically since then. Lok Janshakti Party that fought along with RJD is now with the BJP. JD(U) that was with BJP is now contesting with support from RJD and Congress. Predictions are hard to make this election and the surveys hardly show any wave.\nLet's look at some key battles that will take place in the first phase:\nKalyanpur\nEligible voters: 2,13,334 (1,15,365 men and 97,961 women)\nSitting MLA: Manju Kumari of JD(U); Total votes: 59,325 votes\nRunner up: Rekha Devi of LJP; Total votes: 42,893 votes\nThe election took place in 2013 bypolls and BJP and JD(U) had broken up by then so Kalyanpur can be safely assumed in JDU's hands. It's reserved for an SC candidate and this time Maheshwar Hazari is contesting for JD(U) here. Hazari is Ram Vilas Paswan cousin, who had earlier defeated Paswan's own brother Ram Chandra Paswan and this time is set to fight against Paswan's nephew Prince Raj from LJP.\nUjiarpur\nEligible voters: 2,47,123 (1,31,847 men and 1,15,271 women)\nSitting MLA: Durga Prasad Singh of RJD; Total votes: 42,791\nRunner up: Ram Lakhan Mahto of JD(U); total votes: 29760\nThis seat has been given to RLSP by the NDA. Although BJP witnessed victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls from Ujiarpur LS constituency with Nityanad Rai of the BJP getting 36.95% vote share. But if JD(U) and RJD's vote share are put together, they garned 43.84% vote share. Alok Kumar Mehta from RJD will be contesting from this seat. The party got 2,56,883 votes (29.91%) from here in the LS polls. It seems an easy win for the RJD from here.\nBihpur\nEligible voters: 2,29,901 (1,20,860 men and 1,09,037 women)\nSitting MLA: Kumar Shailendra of BJP; Total votes: 48,027\nRunner up: Shailesh Kumar of RJD; Total votes: 47,562\nThe seat was won by JD(U) in 1995 and subsequently by RJD until 2010. BJP was able to win from the RJD's safe seat in 2010 assembly election with a mere margin of 465 votes. With JD(U)'s support, RJD candidate should be able to record victory for the grand alliance this time.\nBegusarai, Matihani\nEligible voters: 2,83,485 voters (1,52,745 men and 1,30,740 women)\nSitting MLA: Narendra Singh alias Bogo Singh of JD(U); Total votes: 60,530\nRunner up: Abhay Kumar Sarjan of Congress; Total votes: 25,518\nBJP leader Bogo Singh was denied a ticket by the party in 2005 and decided to contest as an independent candidate. He won with a margin of 30,000 votes. JD(U) called him in during 2010 assembly election. This time BJP's Sarvesh Kumar will be contesting against JD(U)'s Bogo Singh. Sarvesh has got 16,667 votes in previous assembly election as an independent candidate but this time his candidature from BJP might put him in the driver's seat. This constituency has more number of voters from forward caste, particularly the Bhumihar, making it an easy field for BJP but only if Bogo Singh's popularity among the youth and the poor has waned. Singh has generously donation for sports events in the district, for marriages of poor girls and is also one its top constitution contractors. He als has 15 criminal cases pending against him.\nKey Candidates\nBhagalpur: Sitting Congress MLA Ajit Sharma will contest to save his seat and might even succeed as BJP's Arijit Shashwat who is son of BJP senior leader Ashwini Choubey hasn't been received well by party workers on ground level. BJP rebel Vijay Prasad Shah is contesting from Bhagalpur and been reportedly received support from party workers of the BJP in Bhagalpur.​\nTararpur: While Hindustani Awam Morcha's state president Shakuni Chaudhary will contest from Tarapur (Munger), JD(U) has roped in educationist Mewalal Chaudhary to fight against Chaudhary, who was formerlya JD(U) leader .\nKhagaria: Shakuni Chaudhary's son Rajesh Kumar alias Rohit will contest from Khagaria, whereas sitting MLA Poonam Devi Yadav of JD(U) will give him a fight. Poonam is a three time winner from Khagaria, out of which she won twice as an independent candidate.\nBihar Assembly Election - 1st phase 131 - Kalyanpur (SC)\n132 - Warisnagar\n133 - Samastipur\n134 - Ujiarpur\n135 - Morwa\n136 - Sarairanjan\n137 - Mohiuddinnagar\n138 - Bibhutipur\n139 - Rosera (SC)\n140 - Hasanpur\n141 - Cheria Bariarpur\n142 - Bachhwara\n143 - Teghra\n144 - Matihani\n145 - Sahebpur Kamal\n146 - Begusarai\n147 - Bakhri (SC)\n148 - Alauli (SC)\n149 - Khagaria\n150 - Beldaur\n151 - Parbatta\n152 - Bihpur\n153 - Gopalpur\n154 - Pirpainti (SC)\n155 - Kahalgaon\n156 - Bhagalpur\n157 - Sultanganj\n158 - Nathnagar\n159 - Amarpur\n160 - Dhauraiya (SC)\n161 - Banka\n162 - Katoria (ST)\n163 - Belhar\n164 - Tarapur\n165 - Munger\n166 - Jamalpur\n167 - Suryagarha\n168 - Lakhisarai\n169 - Sheikhpura\n170 - Barbigha\n235 - Rajauli (SC)\n236 - Hisua\n237 - Nawada\n238 - Gobindpur\n239 - Warsaliganj\n240 - Sikandra (SC)\n241 - Jamui\n242 - Jhajha\n243 - Chakai\n​", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js"], "published": "2015-10-11T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:21:15.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
