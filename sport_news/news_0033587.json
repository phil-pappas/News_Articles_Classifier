Other trucks will take away the chemical by-products of the process.\n“That totals 200 chemical trucks per month that Elba never had before,” Kronquest said, citing documents Kinder Morgan filed with federal regulators.\nSavannah resident Pat Doyle summed up the primary sentiment in the room with a question as the presentations were wrapping up.\n“Is there any benefit to anybody but Kinder Morgan through all this?” she asked.\nThe facility currently imports and stores liquefied natural gas on a private island in the Savannah River about five miles downstream from downtown Savannah. With domestic shale gas booming, imports are down to only a handful of shipments this year. The planned addition of 10 modular liquefaction units would allow the facility to liquefy the natural gas that arrives as a gas by pipeline, an energy-intense process that shrinks its volume by a factor of 600, making it practical to ship out to foreign countries.\nProject assessment coming\nThe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission will issue an environmental assessment for the project on Feb. 5, it announced Thursday. Other federal agencies with jurisdiction over the project will have until May 5 to complete their review.\nHouston-based Kinder Morgan is the same company that’s proposing the controversial Palmetto Pipeline that would carry gasoline, diesel and ethanol through southeast Georgia. The expansion of Elba is otherwise unrelated to that pipeline.\nAmy Hughes, a local lobbyist for Kinder Morgan and its subsidiary Southern LNG, attended the meeting Thursday but declined comment. Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Melissa Ruiz did respond to an email request Friday. She indicated the trucking numbers were a “maximum case.”\n“It represents a rough estimate of truck activity during construction,” she wrote. “Many of these trucks could originate from local suppliers. KM has been and will continue to investigate other forms of transportation such as water transport to reduce traffic to and from the facility. We do not have a final number as we are currently in the bidding process for an engineering, procurement and construction contractor.”\nRuiz also pushed back against the Sierra Club’s contention that many of the jobs generated by the project would not go to local residents.\n“KM has hired a local recruiting firm to assist with hiring over 100 full time jobs, which will include individuals from the local community,” she wrote, noting that seven of 12 hires so far were local. “KM is working with Savannah Tech to assist in training of the future work force of the tri-county area and has contributed $50,000 to Savannah Tech for a process technology simulator to enhance their industrial maintenance technology curriculum.”\nKronquest said it appeared from her recent tour of the facility that the high-paying engineering jobs were recruited from elsewhere, often Houston. She was unimpressed Friday with Kinder Morgan’s reply.\n“So they’ll hire some low level maintenance guys; we know that,” she said.\nKinder Morgan also disputed the Sierra Club’s analysis of a 700 percent increase in greenhouse gas emissions from the site.\n“For instance, the permitted emissions for the expansion equipment will be approximately 50 percent less than Elba’s air permit for existing operations,” Ruiz wrote.\nBut the Sierra Club didn’t compare permits. Instead, its analysis compared actual self-reported emissions from Elba in 2011, when it was last operating fully and emitted about 50,000 tons of greenhouse gas equivalents, to the facility’s new air permit issued over the summer, which allows almost 400,000 tons of greenhouse gas equivalent emissions annually. The increase in those numbers is 700 percent increase.\nPublic comment\nSimona Perry, vice president of the nonprofit Pipeline Safety Coalition, on Thursday urged audience members to get involved by intervening in the case through FERC.\n“The reason why the push to get interventions is that it sends a clear message to FERC that citizens are watching what’s happening,” said the native Savannahian and seventh generation Georgian. “And this is really the only communication you can have with them to really show that.”\nPerry has seen it work before. When her group held a workshop about intervening in a project in the Northeast, 500 people responded.\n“And all of a sudden FERC said maybe we should hold some meetings there,” Perry said. “The industry was put on notice that people were watching and that’s really the power of this, and I encourage everyone to think about it.”\nKronquest encouraged the audience to also contact local officials.\n“As important as becoming an intervenor is getting in touch with your elected officials,” she said. “You can do it as simply as with an email asking them what they think of the expansion proposal.”\nElected officials who have already filed letters of support for the project to FERC include Sen. Johnny Isakson, who expressed his support in 2013 along with then-Sen. Saxby Chambliss. That same year, then-Congressman Jack Kingston also sent a letter of support. Buddy Carter, who now holds Kingston’s first district seat, also supported the project with a letter in 2013 when he was a state senator.\nKinder Morgan expects to begin construction in the second quarter of 2016. The Sierra Club has already requested a more rigorous analysis of the environmental effects of the expansion, a document called an Environmental Impact Statement. If FERC agrees to that analysis, it could delay the project several years.\nThe Commission encourages electronic submission of motions to intervene via the eFiling link on the Commission’s website at http://www.ferc.gov/docs-filing/efiling.asp .
