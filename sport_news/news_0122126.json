AMANDA MCCOY â€” SUN HERALD | Buy Photo \nIt's been a year since the Bay High Tigers defeated rival Pass Christian 17-13 in Pass Christian. The rivalry ignites again Friday when the Tigers host the Pirates in the first Region 8-4A game for both teams. \nThere is a lot at stake Friday night as the Tigers and the Pirates both have 3-2 records. Bay High and Pass Christian have strong running games and have scored a minimum of 28 points each in the last three games. \nThe defenses for the Tigers and Pirates have been productive with the Pirates allowing only six points in their last two games. \nFor the first time in years, the Pirates enter division play with a winning record, as they have won their last three games. But coach Jeff Hopgood's Tigers have won two of their last three games and have placed 132 points on the scoreboard in the process. \nBoth teams are coming off of open dates. \nKeishaun Pullom and the Tigers \nWith a week off from play before entering the Pirates Friday at 7 p.m., Hopgood said his practice goals were to keep his team mentally focused and physically strong. \n\"Our practices have been going well,\" Hopgood said. \"I feel like everything is on track. We had a good bye week and we worked on our timing. We scrimmaged a lot and we took some time off last Friday to let them get their legs back under them.\" \nPart of the Tigers' success has been their explosive senior running back Keishaun Pullom, who is averaging 10.5 yards per carry. \n\"We're looking for our guys to move the ball,\" Hopgood said. \"We run the ball and try to do that every week. Pass Christian has a good defense so it's going to be a great challenge for us. We're excited about the challenge.\" \nHopgood said he is also looking for a solid performance from his defense against the Pirates. \n\"Our defense is going to have to step up and play well,\" he said. \"Pass Christian has some very fast running backs and they seem to have found their niche on offense. They are a physical football team. This game is two evenly matched football teams. It's going to come down to us making some big gains on the kicking game and not turning the ball over.\" \nVJ Swanier and the Pirates \nPirates coach Casey Wittmann still remembers the close loss at home to the Tigers in 2014. \n\"It was a good game,\" he said. \"Bay High made a couple of plays in the second half that we didn't make. It's always a big rivalry for both teams. We had a good week of practice. The kids are excited about getting into district play. We wanted to win homecoming, go into district play with a winning record and make the playoffs. We've reached two of those goals. \nThe Pirates have averaged more than 200 yards rushing in their last two games thanks in part to running back VJ Swanier. The junior is averaging 8.8 yards per carry. \n\"VJ is running the ball really, really well,\" Wittmann said. \"We have several guys that can run the ball. They are doing a good job of not turning the ball over.\" \nWittmann praised the performance of his defense so far, but said they will have to step it up Friday night. \n\"Bay High is running the ball well,\" he said. \"They have a good offensive line and some good rushers. Our defense has gotten better every week. We had a shutout last week. But Friday will be a physical contest. We will have to play our best. For us to win, we'll have to minimize turnovers and make those five or six plays that can change a game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T23:43:19.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
