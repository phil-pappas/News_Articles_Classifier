(Photo: Getty Images) \nLast week's record: 4-1 \nOverall record: 20-11 \nWelcome to Week 7 in college football as the season makes its way past the halfway point. Four unbeatens took their first losses last week (Navy, Oklahoma, Northwestern, and California), and 16 remain including four from the Power 5 conferences. \nThis week, I key in on the Big Ten and the SEC as the battle to stay relevant intensifies. I also make a surprise pick that’ll see a local team get its first win of the season. \nNo. 8 Florida vs. No. 6 LSU: Florida recently received shocking news that its starting quarterback Will Grier had used PEDs. Whether intentional or not, he has been suspended for the season. This doesn’t automatically mean blowout for LSU. Florida’s defense has played above average and will be keying on Leonard Fournette. LSU’s passing attack, led by sophomore quarterback Brandon Harris, is ranked 123rd in the FBS. Stopping Fournette is vital for the Gators, but so far it has been an impossible task. I like LSU, but not in blowout fashion. Final Score: LSU 26, Florida 25. \nNo. 10 Alabama vs. No. 9 Texas A&M: Picking against Alabama might be the most difficult prediction in college football. They always seem to play better as the underdog, the SEC was reminded of that when the Tide throttled Georgia in Athens. This matchup comes down to how well the Aggies can throw against the Crimson Tide defense. Rushing against Alabama doesn’t work. In the Tide’s only loss, Ole Miss managed just 2.9 yards a carry, but the game changer was Chad Kelly’s 10 yards a pass that still stands as Alabama’s only blemish. Texas A&M loves to throw and this is why it's a great matchup for the Aggies. I am going Texas A&M. Final Score: Texas A&M 27, Alabama 24. \nNo. 18 UCLA vs. No. 15 Stanford: Stanford appears to be playing the way preseason predictions had them since a Week 1 upset at Northwestern. UCLA is coming off a much-needed bye week after getting stunned by Arizona State. Both of these teams match up very closely, but Stanford always steps up its play in the Pac-12. Defense favors the Cardinal over UCLA freshman quarterback Josh Rosen. Final Score: Stanford 29, UCLA 27. \nNo. 17 Iowa vs. No. 20 Northwestern: Surprise...the Hawkeyes are undefeated, and I believe they’ll stay that way after this Big Ten showdown. Northwestern is a very good team, but after getting punched in the throat at Michigan last week, I don’t think they have what it takes to bounce back against a tough Iowa team. The Hawkeyes aren’t the type of team to win big, but they’ve been getting the job done and I like their offense against a shredded Wildcat defense. Final Score: Iowa 22, Northwestern 21. \nNo. 7 Michigan State vs. No. 12 Michigan: The governor's trophy is the least to what’s at stake in this matchup. The proud tradition of Michigan football seems to be restored under first-year head coach Jim Harbaugh, while Michigan State has been playing its heart out week after week. There are two big factors that are going to determine this rivalry. The defense goes plays in favor of the Wolverines' FBS-leading six points against, which has only allowed 14 points total in its last five games with consecutive shutouts. As for coaching, I believe it is tilting Michigan’s way with Harbaugh. Michigan has been dominating -- to say the least -- since its season-opening loss to No. 4 Utah. The Spartans, however, have been edging its opponents with an average margin of victory of 10. Michigan football is playing on another level right now, and I believe they upset Michigan State. Final Score: Michigan 26, Michigan State 19. \nPenn State vs. No. 1 Ohio State: Penn State couldn’t have picked a better time to play Ohio State coming off of a 5-game winning streak since an opening day loss at Temple. Not to downplay the Buckeyes starting out 6-0, I have been impressed with the way Penn State has bounced back. Arguably, neither team has beaten anyone decent, and Temple appears to be the toughest opponent on either teams' schedules thus far. The Nittany Lions have been without its No. 1 running back Saquon Barkley -- he’s questionable to return for this game -- and although Penn State quarterback Christian Hackenburg has been playing better, I don’t think he’s played the competition to prepare him for this tough road test. I am going with the Buckeyes in this one. Final Score: Ohio State 25, Penn State 21. \nDelaware State vs. Florida A&M: The likelihood of the Hornets getting a victory this season under new head coach Kenny Carter is almost gone. However, hope is not lost as Delaware State travels to winless Florida A&M. The Hornets defense needs to carry the team as the offense seems to surrender more scoring opportunities than it produces. I like DSU to finally get a win in what surely will turn out to be a sloppy football game. Final Score: Delaware State 26, Florida A&M 22. \nHave a particular game you’re looking forward to?
