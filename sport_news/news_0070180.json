but refused to admit he had erred in that ambition. \n\"I think the opposite,\" said Saint-Andre when asked if he regretted his focus. \n\"You have to use your assets. \n\"They were extremely reactive, much faster than us, and then you realise that, well, we have good players but New Zealand have a reactivity, a speed an technique in defence of high quality.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:10:35.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
