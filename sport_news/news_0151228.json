Joe (Flacco) came over and said: ‘Just let him win the game.’ “ \nFlacco trusted his kicker. \nAfter seeing Steelers kicker Josh Scobee miss twice in the final 3 minutes from 49 and 41 yards, the Ravens’ Justin Tucker kicked a game-tying 42-yarder with 3 seconds left. Then in overtime, Tucker made a 52-yarder to win it as Flacco predicted. \n“When you have a guy like Justin, kicking field goals is a pretty safe bet,” Flacco said after the 23-20 OT victory over the Steelers at Heinz Field. “He’s pretty darn good.” \nTucker also kicked a 40-yarder early in the fourth quarter as the Ravens erased a 13-point second-half deficit. Tucker, a fourth-year kicker, has made 10 of 11 field goals this season. \n“In this league, most games come to three points,” Harbaugh said, “so you’d better have a great kicker.” \nThe Ravens needed this win to avoid an 0-4 start. The team opened its season with losses at Denver, 19-13, and Oakland, 37-33, and then 28-24 at home to Cincinnati in Week 3. Under the current playoff format, only one team has recovered from an 0-4 start to reach the postseason -- the San Diego Chargers in 1992. \nWith 8 minutes left in the third quarter, the Ravens trailed 20-7. Flacco started the rally with a 15-yard touchdown pass to wideout Kamar Aiken. Tucker then scored the next nine points at a stadium that’s notoriously hard on kickers. \n“No matter which end of the stadium you’re kicking at, it’s a tough stadium to kick in,” Tucker said. “It’s a tough place to play in. This is one of the most electric stadiums to play in. To be able to come in and win in such a dramatic fashion with really a consummate team effort, it’s really special.” \nThe Ravens entered ranked 27th in rushing, yet ran for 191 yards on 39 carries. Justin Forsett led with 150 on 27 carries. \nFlacco completed 20 of 33 passes for 189 yards and a touchdown, but also turned the ball over twice and failed to convert a fourth-down sneak with 4:20 left. But the team’s defense and kicker bailed him out. \n“This first win should catalyze us to go on to big things,” Tucker said. \nAll three of Tucker’s kicks came toward the stadium’s closed end. Scobee, who made a 45-yarder and a 36-yarder in the first half, missed twice toward the open end. \nTucker said his philosophy for Heinz Field is “just to keep it simple.” \n“When we pick out a target behind the goal post, we aim small to miss small,” Tucker said. “When I was lining up each one of those kicks tonight, we were aiming a foot to a foot-and-a-half just left of center and letting the ball just do what it’s going to do. \n“On the last one, more than anything, I was just thinking, let’s just rip it and get the (heck) out of here. That’s exactly what we did.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:23:29.859+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
