Comment   Dave Horvath Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated Oct 24, 2015 at 11:13 PM By Dave Horvath Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated Oct 24, 2015 at 11:13 PM Providing more abundant fishing opportunities for the state’s anglers was the impetus behind a series of public meetings hosted by the Missouri Department of Conservation (MDC), including Oct. 15 in Neosho. Citizens were welcomed in the Neosho National Fish Hatchery by MDC staff to provide comments about proposed changes to regulations regarding smallmouth bass and rock bass, also known as goggle eye. “The smallmouth bass and rock bass are really important to Missouri anglers,” Fisheries Division Chief Brian Canaday explained about the proposals. “They are highly sought after, kind of an iconic species in Ozarks streams. What we are trying to do is make sure that we can maintain those at a really good level for anglers and the environment long term. We want to make sure we have good fishing today and in the future.” A tremendous amount of research is being conducted, Canaday revealed, including angler surveys, movement studies of the fish, open houses with the public and more to come up with recommendations that are simple to follow, good for the species, help set good angler expectations and help maintain the species. “Those simplified regulations are really important to us because we want folks to go fishing,” he insisted. “We don’t want them to be intimidated by the regulations. We want them to be able to understand them. We want to make sure they are easy to enforce, easy to follow so they want to go out fishing and go fishing more often.” The goal is for all fish to reach maximum growth potential within reason in Ozarks streams. To do that, the state seeks a 7-inch limit on rock bass or goggle eye statewide, Canaday said, but keep a limit of 15 fish per day. “What we are proposing to do, if you are generally fishing statewide for smallmouth,” he said, “we’ll keep that at a 12-inch fish, six per day. If you are in a special management area (SMA) – a special management zone that we’ve designated – we’re recommending that you keep one smallmouth bass per day at 15 inches, no matter where you are fishing in those special management zones.” Depending on where you fish, Canaday said, the current regulation might be one 18-inch fish per day, two 15-inch fish per day or one 15-inch fish per day. “What we want the public to understand is, wherever you go fishing in these special areas, this is the regulation,” he said. “They can follow the regulations without confusion.” Eliminating confusion is one of the main goals, Canaday said. “We don’t anyone to think, ‘I don’t know the regs. I just won’t go fishing,’” he said. “I think what we’ve done with what we’ve proposed is provide an opportunity for people who want to catch fish in a special management area and also still allow for those people who want to just go out and catch a mess of fish for their families. It’s a good balance.” Page 2 of 2 - Canaday described the special areas as typical beautiful Ozarks streams with good access and good fish populations and habitat. “That’s why they are so special,” he said. “They are a unique area, and we are looking at maybe even expanding some of those areas a little bit.” Some special management areas are 15 to 18 miles long, Canaday said, and may be up to 50 miles of a stream. They typically are between hard start and stop points to ensure the boundaries are clear to anglers. That keeps anglers from floating into a 15-inch zone from waters where 12-inch smallmouth are legal and vice-versa. Biologists are studying several streams with such areas, including the Elk River in McDonald County, Canaday said, with an eye of expanding SMAs to protect more fish and grow bigger fish for anglers. “We want to really hear from the public and get their opinions, their thoughts, their ideas on what they think we want to have for the fish population,” he said. “We really want to hear from our citizens because we are here for them to manage forest, fish and wildlife.” Information received from anglers and the public will be coupled with biological information, Canaday said. Agents will be consulted before proposals are brought to the regulations committee and ultimately to the conservation commission, which sets rules. He expects the process to reach the commission by next spring. If approved, new regulations would go into effect in March 2017. Rick Horton, a fisheries biologist stationed in the Neosho MDC office, has heard no opposition from local anglers over the proposed changes. He pointed out that the Elk River is an outlier in the state because the regulation there is two black bass over 15 inches, as opposed to one smallmouth over 15 inches in most of the state. “It just makes the Elk River more conformed with the rest of the SMAs,” Horton said. “Basically, if you go to a special management area, the regulations will be the same statewide with the new regulation change.” The new regulation on rock bass, Horton said, is an attempt to keep the goggle eye in the stream until 7 inches in length. “Through some harvest studies, some people would keep fish anywhere from 5½ inches on up,” he noted. “With putting a 7-inch limit on there, what we should be able to do is see a better rock bass fishery statewide in all our Ozarks streams. We’ll still have some special management areas with the larger rock bass limit, but the 7 inch is kind of a uniform thing, just to make it easier for anglers.” MDC is accepting public comments through Friday at mdc.mo.gov/node/9092 or through U.S. mail to Missouri Department of Conservation, Attn: Policy Coordination, P.O.
