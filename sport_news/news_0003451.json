Photo by Charlotte Wilder Rowers moved back and forth across the dock like shadows, barely visible. It was 5:30 a.m., and the lights on the Hancock Tower sparkled like stars on the black water of the Charles River.\nRelated Links An insider’s guide to Head of the Charles, the essential autumn-in-New-England event At Head of the Charles, boats worth $50,000 try not to crash Inside the boat house of the Union Boat Club, a rowing club located just behind the Hatch Shell, eight rowers milled about the rowing shells perched on racks. All working professionals between the ages of 23 and 32 who rowed in college, they were preparing to practice with their coach for the last time before the big race: the Head of the Charles Regatta, where they will compete against other club teams and some top-level college programs from across the country.\n“Everyone who rows at this point, at this level, is still doing it with a job,” said Hank Schless, one of the rowers who competed for Bates College up in Maine. “A lot are married and have kids, and the cool thing is that everyone wants to be there. In college, you get those kids who are doing it because they’ll stay in shape, it’s a cool activity, and you get a six pack from it. That’s great. But we’re here still doing it because we love it.”\nOne of the rowers wore a spandex onesie printed to look like Iron Man’s suit. The others wore more muted shorts and vests. They joked around in the boathouse before carrying their boat from its berth to the dock.\n“Toes to the edge!” ordered the coxswain, Tom Ivancic. “Toes to the edge, roll to waist, ready...roll.”\nThe rowers put the boat in the water, got themselves and their oars situated, and pushed off. Their coach, Henry Palmer, called for his Border Collie Nelson, who ran out of the boathouse and joined his owner on the motor boat.\nPalmer followed the rowers out from the Charles River Basin and up under the Mass. Ave bridge to the more narrow section of the river, where they practice six to nine times a week.\nRowing competitively requires coordination with other people in addition to an insane level of personal fitness. Rowers have to be in sync on and off the water—they can’t skip many practices because the other people in the boat depend on them. That sense of community is a large part of what helps these guys wake up at 4:45 each morning.\nNelson the Border Collie coaches the rowers. Photo by Charlotte Wilder On the river, it felt about 15 degrees colder than it did on land, where the temperature at that hour hovered around 50 degrees. The wind whipped around the boat and Nelson curled up below the console, nestling himself against Palmer’s feet.\nIvancic called out a command and the men began pulling harder. Palmer, who rowed at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut and in England before returning to the U.S. to coach, accelerated the motorboat to keep up.\n“It’s a grind,” Palmer said as the men’s oars caught the water. “You just can’t get away from putting in all the hours. What I like so much about the sport is that it’s all about preparation. You show up on race day and luck is not involved. It’s whoever’s prepared the most.”\nThe men stopped rowing, breathing heavily and sweating. One of them tried to drink from the wrong end of his water bottle.\n“You got any jokes?” Palmer asked into his megaphone.\n“What do you call a cow with no legs?” called out Iron Man. Palmer shook his head.\n“Ground beef,” said Iron Man.\nPalmer gave the guy grief and the men started rowing again. They were practicing the bend from the Weeks Bridge to the Larz Anderson Bridge, a spot that’s notorious for crashes . They kept a clean line through the arches as they sped past Memorial Drive, where cars were starting to drive by with more frequency. It was close to 6:45 a.m. The city was beginning to wake up.\nBack at the boathouse, some men left quickly to get to work by 7:30, while others had a bit more time. Schless planned to eat two breakfast sandwiches and a protein shake and drink a big coffee.\n“The great thing about rowing,” Schless said, “is that after that morning practice you’re like, “I can eat whatever I want.’”\nRise and grind.
