Saunders died at the age of 60 on Sunday, leaving a gaping hole in the organization he was rebuilding from the ground up. Sam Mitchell, who took over as head coach when Saunders went on a leave of absence in September, says Flip's imprint was on the entire organization. That's from the roster to the coaching staff to the new practice facility that opened this summer. General manager Milt Newton says the team has had discussions with the NBA about not playing in the season opener in Los Angeles against the Lakers. But as of now he believes the game will be played.
