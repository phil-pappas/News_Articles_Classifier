Pullman, Washington, where No. 8 Stanford is playing Washington State, was a possible contender. \nTemple students, alumni and fans lobbied ESPN on social media after the upstart Owls rallied in the fourth quarter last Thursday to beat East Carolina for its first ever 7-0 start. \nTemple-Notre Dame is the only matchup of ranked opponents this weekend. It’s Temple’s first appearance in ABC’s primetime game of the week. \nThe only previous “GameDay” broadcast from Philadelphia was Nov. 16, 2002 for the Harvard-Penn game. The hometown Quakers won 44-9. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:46:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:29:35.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
