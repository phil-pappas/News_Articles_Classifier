The Cougars (3-1), who host Stonewall Jackson on Friday are second at 19.25. \nThe only other area team in the top 16 of that region is Robert E. Lee. The Leemen (2-3) are 12th with a 14.20 rating, .3 points behind No. 12 King William (14.50). \nWilson Memorial (1-3) is on the outside looking in, tied at No. 17 with Bluestone and Central Woodstock at 12.25. However, all three are only .15 points behind No. 16 Prince Edward (12.40) for the final playoff spot. \nIn Group 1A East, Riverheads (4-0) is firmly in second place behind Essex with a rating of 22.50. The Trojans, Group 1A finalists last year, have an average of 24.50, while Franklin is third at 20.00. \nIn Group 3A West, Waynesboro is currently 11th with an average of 18.00. Brookville (25.80) and Staunton River (23.20) are first and second, respectively in that region. \nThe first round of playoffs begins the week of Friday, Nov. 13. \nWeekly Rankings as of Sept. 29 \nGroup 2A East \n1.
