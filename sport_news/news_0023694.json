But put Jalen Watts-Jackson's winning fumble return to beat U-M at the top of the list.\n• This MSU defense is still growing: Dantonio made a bold move by starting freshmen Grayson Miller and Khari Willis at safety, and they played well in the best overall effort of the season from the defense. Shilique Calhoun and the front seven formed a wall, and Michigan gained only 230 yards.\n• Connor Cook is on fire: Cook took a late sack, then couldn't get a strong throw off amid pressure on his final play to an open receiver. But he passed for 328 yards and could have had a lot more with help from his wideouts — a perfect fourth-down pass dropped by Macgarrett Kings Jr. would have set up MSU for the go-ahead score. Cook is playing like a first-round NFL draft pick.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nRexrode: MSU looking to stretch its good fortune\nUp next for the Spartans: Indiana\nMatchup: Indiana (4-3, 0-3 Big Ten) at No. 7 Michigan State (7-0, 3-0).\nWhen: 3:30 p.m. Saturday.\nWhere: Spartan Stadium, East Lansing.\nTV/radio: ABC (Channel 7 in Detroit), WJR-AM (760).\nLine: No line.\nKnow the foe: Indiana and Rutgers combined for 1,223 yards of offense Saturday and 15 TDs in Rutgers' 55-52 comeback win — which happened only because of a fumbled punt and two Nate Sudfeld INTs in the fourth quarter. Indiana standout running back Jordan Howard put up huge numbers early in the season but has been out with an ankle injury. Indiana nearly upset Ohio State at home, falling, 34-27, and also has narrow wins over Southern Illinois and Western Kentucky. This is a typical IU team under Kevin Wilson — explosive offense, overmatched defense.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nWindsor: Final crazy play shows strength of both MSU, U-M\nWhat to watch for\n• Psychological recovery, from opposite ends: Mark Dantonio has consistently readied his team for the next game, regardless of the most recent result. But this week still has to be a challenge coming off events and emotions of Ann Arbor. Meanwhile, Indiana led Rutgers, 52-27, late in the third quarter at home Saturday and lost, 55-52. Call in the shrinks!\n• New-look secondary gets bigger test: The Spartans and their freshman safeties handled things well downfield against U-M, but Michigan's passing game is pedestrian compared with Indiana's high-tempo attack. Nate Sudfeld returned from an ankle injury to throw for 464 yards and four touchdowns on Rutgers. IU's offense is highly potent with Sudfeld.\n• Special-teams spark: This has been the worst overall kicking game of Dantonio's nine seasons at MSU, but the punt-block team turned in one of the biggest plays of his career. Can MSU build off that? The punting, kicking and coverage situations all need to improve for the Spartans to stay on track toward their lofty goals.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/8228f7c963566013b55e68bd2bff6f7dc7b8f07c/c=474-0-1969-1495/local/-/media/2015/10/19/DetroitFreePress/B9319322376Z.1_20151019003851_000_G2VC9CUB8.1-0.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d1ae02827a73bd6a111db4e87fd91187dc8dd2c1/c=847-0-1803-956/local/-/media/2015/10/18/DetroitFreePress/B9319322383Z.1_20151018222839_000_G2VC9COSK.1-0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T10:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:50:40.325+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
