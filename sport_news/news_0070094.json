Sounders defender Brad Evans flicked it off his head across the goal, and Barrett, who came on in the 85th minute, ran onto the ball and one-timed it into the net from 2 yards away for his fifth of the year. \nThe Sounders (14-13-5, 47 points) extended their unbeaten streak to six games (4-0-2). \nLos Angeles (14-9-9, 51 points) clinched a playoff spot and climbed into a Supporters Shield tie with the New York Red Bulls. New York has four games left, and the Galaxy have two. \nIn the 36th minute, Robbie Keane converted a Seattle defensive giveaway into a goal. Seattle’s Zach Scott, playing on the defensive left side, sent the ball toward Gonzalo Pineda at the top of the box. But he left it short, and Pineda couldn’t reach it. \nKeane did, running onto the errant pass, taking it to the top of the penalty spot, and firing into the back right center for his 17th of the year. \nFC DALLAS 4, DYNAMO 1 \nFRISCO, Texas (AP) - David Texeira scored twice, and Kellyn Acosta added a third second-half goal and FC Dallas beat Houston to become the first Western Conference team to clinch a playoff spot. \nTexeira put Dallas ahead when he fired a rocket from 20 yards that caromed off the crossbar in the 51st minute. Kellyn Acosta one-timed a shot off the crossbar 2 minutes later, and Texeira added an insurance goal in the third minute of stoppage time. \nComing off back-to-back losses on the road, including a 3-2 loss to the L.A. Galaxy, FC Dallas (14-10-5) beat the Dynamo for the fifth consecutive time and swept all three meetings this season. \nRicardo Clark scored from 15 yards to pull Houston even after Mauro Diaz scored on a penalty kick to give Dallas the early lead. \nREAL SALT LAKE 2, RAPIDS 1 \nCOMMERCE CITY, Colo. (AP) - Joao Plata and Luke Mulholland scored 10 minutes apart in the first half and Real Salt Lake beat Colorado to eliminate the Rapids from the playoff race. \nThe Rapids (8-12-10) struck first. Kevin Doyle headed a long cross from Sean St. Ledger in the 16th minute, snapping a shot from 15-yards out that found its way into the far corner. \nReal Salt Lake (10-12-8) struck back in the 33rd minute when Plata bent a free kick over the Colorado wall and just under the crossbar.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:31:24.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
