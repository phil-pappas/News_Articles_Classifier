Here the decades share close quarters and I fancy I can hear voices long since silenced, can see faces compress into that crystalline focus peculiar to photographs made from glass plate negatives. The Sumpter dredge is one of those places. The dredge is not particularly old by the standards of a county founded in 1862, barely a year after the first shot of the Civil War was fired. (At Fort Sumter, that was — an event commemorated in the name of the town where the dredge sits. Never mind the “p” that got wedged between the “m” and the “t,” a change apparently prompted by the postal authorities, a bunch which, it seems, has from early days practiced the bureaucratic tediousness for which it is still known.) The white-painted behemoth that dominates the southern end of Sumpter was the last of three similar gold-mining contraptions that plied the valuable gravels flooring the Powder River Valley. The surviving dredge first gouged into those strata, seeking the rich entrails that dozens of streams disgorged from veins in the Elkhorn Mountains, in 1935. Its cacophony — the anecdote has it that so constant and thorough was the racket that Sumpter residents eventually stopped noticing the dredge except when it shut down, creating a sudden and unnerving silence — didn’t cease until 1954. This period is within the memory of many current county residents. The dredge, suffice it to say, hasn’t quite the historical patina of Oregon Trail ruts. What the dredge does have is presence. There is, most obviously, its physical presence. The dredge, standing more than 50 feet high and weighing 2 ﬁ million pounds, seems far too big to have ever moved around under its own power. You’d as likely expect the Geiser Grand Hotel to pull itself across town, scrunching along rather like a hermit crab. But the dredge, which looks to me like something designed by men more accustomed to draping their blueprints over a pine stump than a drafting board, was a machine of considerable abilities, including propelling its mass across uneven terrain. I wonder, though, even in our era when the simplest implements are tinkered with on a computer screen before being brought to tangible life on an assembly line, whether the Sumpter dredge could even be replicated, must less improved upon. This is of course a moot question. A thing like the dredge, designed to churn verdant valleys into slag heaps, would no doubt prompt hysterics in the offices of environmental regulatory agencies in Salem and Washington, D.C., were some company to propose building it. These days the appointed saviors of the planet look askance even at suction dredges that one man can operate — these being to the Sumpter dredge what a balsa glider with a rubber band-powered propeller is to a 747. Besides its imposing bulk, the dredge exudes a different sort of presence, this one less blatant, perhaps, but no less real. It is a link to a different age. This connection seems to me most powerful inside the dredge. It is a curious place. I am struck anew, every time I step into its cool and dim interior, by how utterly organic it is, how indisputably analog. This is a simple machine, an assemblage of iron and thick heavy beams of wood, ignorant of silicon, a feat of macroengineering rather than microprocessing. Brutal yet elegant. I don’t have an especially vigorous imagination but when I stroll around the dredge, when I run a finger across the chilly curve of an electric motor’s housing or place my palm on the smooth grain of a Douglas-fir truss, I have no trouble conjuring the men who worked here decades before my birth. I can see in my mind’s eye their hands, rough with thick callouses, manipulating levers and whacking balky pressure gauges and gesturing to co-workers, as must have been necessary what with the overwhelming din. I see them clad in plain garments of cotton and wool, the sweat trickling down their cheeks in summer, the clouds of their exhalations in the frigid January of a mountain valley. I see where the tread of their heavy boots has smoothed the grooves the saws left in the floor planks. I have felt this same queer sense of eras nearly colliding in a few other places in Baker County, principally inside 19th century homes. It is fine to read about history. But historians, no matter how prodigious their research nor how fluid their prose, can compete with the physical reality of a place such as the dredge. No book can replicate the experience of standing where people stood who are many years in their graves, of putting your hands where theirs once rested. At that instant, even in a machine that has not run since Eisenhower was president and the term “cordless” was not yet needed, you can almost feel the warmth of another person’s touch, the blood coursing through the veins.
