Parkey missed a field goal in the fourth quarter of their 26-24 loss at Atlanta in Week 1.\nKelly remains committed to his style, philosophy and personnel. He dismissed any criticism about his controversial personnel moves during the offseason.\n''I think we have the right guys, and we're doing the right things,'' Kelly said. ''We need to execute the plays better. That's what we need to do.''\nThe Eagles offense continues it's inconsistency. The offense has played well in the first half and second half of games, but the unit has put it all together for an entire game. Quarterback Sam Bradford looks as if he's still not comfortable in the offense and star running back DeMarco Murray complained about not getting enough touches after the loss at Washington.\n\"You either make plays or you don't make plays,\" Kelly said. \"And if you're not making plays, you have to continue to work on them so you can make the plays.''\nOn the bright side, the Eagles trail first-place Dallas, Washington and the New York Giants by one game in the NFC East. Kelly has been quick to remind people the 2013 Eagles team started the season 1-3 before rebounding and winning the division title.\n-- Geoffrey C.
