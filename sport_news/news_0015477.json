Or maybe that's what makes LSU play best, as Tigers' coach Les Miles likes to say it.\nIt wasn't the mother of all distractions having to move an away game to Tiger Stadium, but the slightest change goes against the grain and tickles a coach's paranoia.\nRead more: Leonard Fournette Heisman Watch after South Carolina.\nLSU took care of business in Saturday's 45-24 victory and never let the goodwill toward South Carolina interfere with with a fierce competitive will to win.\nIt's a good week on the old report card for the Tigers, who are now ranked No. 6 in the AP top 25 and No. 5 in the coaches top 25. Leonard Fournette got outrushed by a teammate but still leads the nation . Extra credit points for everyone -- except for that kickoff team.\nAnd away we go:\nOFFENSIVE LINE: A-\nThe rushing yardage says so and although South Carolina managed to gum up the works in the first half, it had more to do with committing extra men into the box. Even with a numbers disadvantage, LSU averaged 4 yards per carry. The pass protection was good and when LSU got near the goal line, getting into the end zone wasn't a problem. Will Clapp continues to devastate DEs and LBs when he pulls. He opened the way for Fournette's 87-yard scoring run by taking out the end on the opposite side. Jerald Hawkins mauled the LB on the play, which allowed Fournette into the secondary.\nLSU tackle Vadal Alexander saw same thing in Derrius Guice, running game he sees in practice | Video The Tigers rolled up 396 rushing yards, led by Guice with 161\nLSU used some different blocking schemes than in past games. Maea Teuhema had some problems with quick DT Gerald Dixon Jr. He had a false start penalty and came out of the game for a couple of series. Ethan Pocic got his third holding penalty of the season, Vadal Alexander was solid in run blocking and pass protection. Give Hawkins an attaboy for hustling to recover a fumble by freshman Nick Brossette deep in LSU territory. The only sack had more to do with pass coverage on a one-receiver route and Brandon Harris may have been late to move on the play.\nRUNNING BACKS: A\nIt was slow going in the first half until LSU switched to a 3-wide receiver set to spread out the Gamecocks. LSU ran 24 times for 103 yards in the first half and 30 for 293 in the second. Fournette dug for yardage when there was none and had a career high three pass receptions. Derrius Guice outrushed Fournette and showed moves Fournette can't and put on a better overall show. Darrel Williams is just as tough as Fournette. He ran four times from the fullback spot and picked up three first downs and a touchdown. Nick Brossette nearly made it a tighter final score with his fumble inside the LSU 10-yard line and immediately was pulled. Rules are rules, Les Miles hates fumbles.\nLeonard Fournette: 'I just had to make a play' | Video Leonard Fournette talks to reporters about his 87-yard TD run vs. South Carolina.\nNot only the LSU passing game got better but the rushing attack found a great deal of confidence Saturday. John David Moore's injury changed some of the scheme and freshman BryKeithon Moore made some mistakes, such as a silly block in the back for a penalty and an incorrect pass route which foiled a swing pass. But other college teams have to be envious of what LSU can throw out there at running back every week and it appears Les Miles' confidence in the backup has grown.\nWIDE RECEIVERS/TIGHT ENDS: B+\nNot a lot to complain about after two weeks of red marks everywhere. Travin Dural dropped another easy throw, Trey Quinn nullified his best play this season with an illegal shift but otherwise a good bounce back from the group. Dural looked focused and energized, especially early in the game picking up some extra yardage after the catch as he finished with four catches for 109 yards. He also made a heads-up play to snag his deflected TD pass. Dupre' is establishing himself as the teams top wide out. He held on for a key third-down completion of 28 yards despite taking a big hit and adjusted nicely on the fade pattern for a TD. He made his cut well after the ball was in the air.\nPass wasn't intended for him, but LSU's Travin Dural made the big play | Video He hauled in a 62-yard TD pass on a deflected pass\nTyron Johnson has been getting more and more playing time. His blocking has improved although he could have been called for holding on two occasions. He made a key catch to convert a third down play. In another instance he caused an incompletion buy getting in Dupre's way. Still no Dillon Gordon, who missed his third straight game. Colin Jeter didn't catch a pass but had a key block on Fournette's 87-yard TD run. The wide receivers were scuffling and still have room for improvement but they took a big step and have to go into Florida week feeling good about themselves.\nQUARTERBACKS: A-\nHarris must be doing well. Les Miles let him talk to reporters after the game, our first access since the middle of Week 2. He either ran or passed for first downs 10 times and although he was off target with a few throws, most of them were on the money. Another game with no turnovers. Harris was particularly good on the final drive of the first half. He passed for three first downs and when the clock was under 15 seconds, he threw away two balls instead of forcing it into the end zone to preserve the field goal. He got some luck when a pass to DeSean Smith ricocheted to Dural.\nLSU QB Brandon Harris on TD pass: 'Guy drilled me in the face' | Video LSU quarterback talks about his 62-yard TD pass to Travin Dural vs. South Carolina.\nAll in all Harris made good decisions. He knows better when to run now, getting two first downs with his feet. His touchdown pass to Dupre' was lofted to the perfect spot, which allowed Dupre to run under it. When presented with an off target shotgun snap he snagged it and immediately headed for the sidelines instead of trying to turn it into a big play. Miles and Cam Cameron trusted him more to throw over the middle. He seems to be blossoming at the perfect time.\nDEFENSIVE LINE: A-\nThis group was active all day and providing decent pressure. It's hard to get sacks when the quarterback is getting it out of there quickly but LSU made him make some poor throws with the front four pass rush early in the game. Davon Godchaux popped him one time after getting rid of the ball. The line had to deal with some trickeration and handled it pretty well. South Carolina rushed for 74 yard and never really established any ground work. Arden Key hustled around the field and Lewis Neal got his team-high fourth sack. Three of the four QB hurries came from the D-line. This group is also improving with the backups playing more. Isaiah Washington got some snaps and Sione Teuhema had three tackles. DTs Greg Gilmore and Frank Herron didn't make much noise on the stat sheet but they allowed the starters to get some rest.\nLINEBACKERS: A-\nLSU is fine with Kendell Beckwith and Deion Jones in the game. Both are sure tacklers, I saw only one missed tackle between them. South Carolina's longest run from scrimmage was 11 yards and there were only three of 10 or more. When the reserves come in things aren't as solid. Beckwith and Jones have proven to be adept at pass coverage. Jones broke up a pass and Beckwith stopped a couple of receivers in their tracks, and the run defense is strong. Both can play sideline to sideline and shut down most of South Carolina's wide game. The test is going to come when LSU faces a team that can run the ball with a big running back.\nSECONDARY: B-\nThis wasn't the secondary's best game and it started early. Nickel back Dwayne Thomas is no better than LSU's third best cover corner and he got matched up on South Carolina's best receiver Pharoh Cooper early in the game The result was a 42-yard completion to set up a field goal. Cooper was matched against safety Rickey Jefferson on his 43-yard TD catch because Jefferson played too close in man-coverage. Jamal Adams may have played too far right on the fourth-down, 26-yard TD pass to TE Jerrell Adams. There was clearly a communication problem on that play. TreDavious White and Kevin Toliver had good games. Toliver got another interference call but refuses to back down from playing tough coverage. Give Adams an assist for tipping John Battle's interception, and battle for making an athletic play. It might get better when senior Jalen Mills comes back from his season long injury hiatus.\nSPECIAL TEAMS: C\nLSU offense comes together in 45-24 rout of South Carolina | Vlog LSU beat writer Jim Kleinpeter and columnist Ron Higgins break down the Tigers' victory on Saturday.\nIf I gave individual grades for each group, the kickoff team would get an F. The first play of the game was a kickoff out of bounds by Trent Domingue, close to a touchback but still OB. That was the theme as the Gamecocks starting field position was their own 35 yard line. It got so bad Miles had Domingue squib kick and the result was about the same. LSU was fortunate a South Carolina player was offsides when kicker Landon Ard recover his onsides kick. And I haven't even gotten to the 96-yard return for a TD by a freshman who had never touched the ball before in a college game. To be fair, there was at least one block in the back on that play and possibly a holding penalty. There was also a gigantic hole for the guy to run through. The punting was adequate and there was no return game with Ard getting three touchbacks on five kickoffs. LSU scholarship kicker Cameron Gamble couldn't get the ball to the end zone with the wind at his back. Trent Domingue is rocking along with another field goal and is now 7 for 7.\nCOACHING: A\nA good game all around for LSU coaches, who had to adjust to a new schedule. Just because LSU had an away game turn into a home game doesn't mean it was a cakewalk. Players had every reason to be distracted with all the talk about moving the game. Coaches hate when new things filter through the players minds. I thought Miles did a good job having the players ready since LSU came out with another strong start. Defense could have started better but it complemented the offense well and made enough plays. Cam Cameron had a good mix of running and passing, finally letting Brandon Harris throw a variety of pass routes. Having the lead with a running game like LSU's is like having a strong bullpen topped Mariano Rivera as the closer. South Carolina had only 24 snaps in the second half. Miles has done a good job of bringing the team along and not asking Harris to do too much. The wide receivers also responded to his threats about reshuffling the deck.\nOVERALL: A\nLes Miles: 'Crowd sounded like 100,000 to me' | Video LSU coach Les Miles talks to the media about the Tigers' victory against South Carolina.\nIt still was not a picture perfect game but wouldn't you rather save that for later? LSU has one turnover through five games and has not trailed. Les Miles gives not a thought to style points and the way the schedule is set up has worked in LSU's favor. Having the home game last week means the tigers go 42 days between road games. That's a bonus. LSU came through against a solid program, even if it is struggling a bit now. You have to like LSU's position but the biggest test of the season comes Saturday, and it's right where LSU likes it. In Tiger Stadium and at night. LSU doesn't need to develop one more characteristic -- a killer instinct. The Tigers had a chance with South Carolina facing fourth-and-8 and trailing 31-10. LSU blew a coverage and gave up a TD, allowing the Gamecocks hang a round some more and score another. LSU answered each time but. . .\nScroll down for grades from previous games:\nEastern Michigan\nSyracuse\nAuburn\nMississippi State", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:42:16.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
