I really appreciate them for understanding that.” \nElliott says his beloved grandmother was feisty and combative, living life to its fullest until it was time. \n“She never wanted to sit down,’’ said Elliott of his grandmother, whom Elliott said was a victim of old age. \n“No one could ever tell her what to do. She was one of those stubborn individuals who never wanted to give up until it was time to go.” \nElliott knew of his grandmother’s fate, but waited until the final funeral arrangements were made before approaching Milanovich. \nIt just so happened the funeral coincided on the same day the Argos were to play the Calgary Stampeders. \nElliott flew to Mississippi, stood by his mom to offer support and reconnected with family members he hasn’t seen in a while. \n“I don’t think my teammates know what they did for me,’’ said Elliott. “They kept my spirits up and gave me a chance to keep my mind off things.” \nElliott says his grandmother wasn’t much of a sports fan, seldom attending any of his games in person. \n“But she’d call every week telling me: ‘I’m proud of you baby, I love you, keep doing your thing.’ She actually made me a quilt I carry with me every city I go to and I’ve got it in my house right now. \n“I just hold on to that quilt because it’s a quilt full of her love. When I wrap myself in it at night, it’s all good.” \nThe Argos weren’t that good against Calgary, trailing 17-0 at halftime and never really threatening the defending Grey Cup champions. \nHaving Elliott back in the lineup helps, but the biggest key with this Argos franchise has been turnovers. \nElliott is aware of the team’s standings and the possibility of winning the East, which would require Toronto winning all three of its remaining games and having Hamilton lose two of its three. \nAll three of Toronto’s opponents — Montreal, B.C. and Winnipeg — have losing records, each team having already lost to the Argos. \n“We’re basically approaching these games as though we need to win them all to make it to the playoffs,’’ said Elliott of his 9-6 Argos, who assured themselves of a post-season berth last weekend following losses by the Lions and Als. \n“We realize we’ve clinched a playoff berth, but we’re not relaxing. \n“We’re treating these games like we need to get in. Honestly, we’re trying to get that playoff bye and we still have a chance at it.” \n\nHURTING ALL OVER \nThe Toronto Argonauts’ offensive line has taken a beating this year, bodies dropping when injuries hit, players switching from one side to another. \nAfter playing 15 games, Tyler Holmes and Greg Van Roten have emerged as the only linemen to start each game for the Double Blue. \nHolmes may emerge as the lone survivor, at least heading into Friday night’s game against the Montreal Alouettes, a team whose strength is on defence with its line setting the tone. \nDuring his availability on Wednesday, Argos head coach Scott Milanovich said Van Roten, who has started at centre, guard and tackle, is questionable for Friday. \nA day earlier, Van Roten and defensive tackle Euclid Cummings got into a fight during practice. \nMilanovich would also say that veteran Wayne Smith is down. \n“We’ll have to lean on guys who haven’t played much,’’ said Milanovich. \nThe Argos have recently added to their practice roster by bringing in linemen the team has liked, but has been unable to play because of the ratio. \nVan Roten is an American, allowing the Argos to replace an import with an import. \nCanadian H-back Alexandre Dupuis (foot) seems ready to return. \nMilanovich also confirmed American punter Jake Rogers will make his CFL debut Friday night. \nIf one were to include receiver Dave Stala, Rogers brings to nine the amount of kickers the Scullers have signed this season. \nStala wasn’t acquired to punt, but he has been forced into duties following injuries to Swayze Waters.
