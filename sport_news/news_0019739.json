Ken Morgan, Walla Walla Union-Bulletin Print this article Advertisement MILTON-FREEWATER — McLoughlin High School battled back twice from one-goal deficits to earn a 2-2 tie with La Grande here Tuesday in Greater Oregon League girls soccer action. Photo by Greg Lehman Mac-Hi’s Harmonie Correa (right) kicks the ball away from La Grande’s Alissa Welberg during Tuesday’s match. “Our girls just didn’t let down,” Pioneers coach Martin Martinez said. “Our goal was to beat La Grande by two (La Grande won 2-1 earlier) and win the GOL. Other teams just let down after they get scored on. We just kept on going.” The Tigers took advantage of their outside speed to score first. Brittany Hanson streaked down the right side, beat the Pioneer defense off the dribble, and fired home a grounder into the left corner of the net for a 1-0 Tiger lead with four minutes gone. Seven minutes later, the Pioneers answered. The Tigers failed to make a good clearance, and Harmonie Correa gathered the loose ball to the right and outside of the 18-yard box. With Tiger keeper Kylee Schelin off her line, Correa lobbed her shot over Schelin and into the net for a 1-1 tie. Adaris Ramirez found Rachael Lyon for a blast in the 21st minute, but the shot went over the top. Ramirez ripped a shot off Schelin in the 22nd minute and earned Mac-Hi’s first corner kick, but the Pioneers couldn’t convert. What opportunities the Tigers had, were run off by the defense of Daniela Betancourt, Mallory Copeland and Sydney Richwine in the Pioneer back. Lyon’s header missed wide right with seven minutes left in the half. Tiger Brittney Bertrand got off a shot with 3:35 left, but Pioneer goalie Vide Roemo made an easy save of the bouncer and the teams went to intermission tied 1-1. The Pioneers got chances to start the second half. Lyon was in a scrum in front of the Tiger net, but her shot on an open net was cleared by the Tiger defense in the 41st minute. Leslie Ponce fired a shot over the net in the 43rd minute. The defense trio of Betancourt, Copeland and Richwine blocked, ran off runners and made steals to keep the Tiger offense at bay into the 72nd minute. “They are pretty solid in the back,” Martinez said. “They’ve been playing together since sixth grade, so they know each other and trust each other.” In the 72nd minute, the Tigers’ Hanson blasted a shot on goal, but Roemo made a two-fisted bat-away save to keep the match tied. The Tigers earned a corner a minute later. Alissa Welberg took the corner and lofted one to the head of Alina Carson, whose header was a popup, but Roemo caught the ball inside the goal and La Grande took a 2-1 lead. “The machine was broke and the field didn’t get lined,” Maritnez said. “My goalie just didn’t see where she was at.” Back came the Pioneers. In the 76th minute, a Copeland cross was misplayed by the Tiger goalie, and Lyon cleaned it up to even the battle at 2-2. “It was a little nerve racking (being down 2-1),” Lyon said. “I heard Harmonie (Correa) yelling at me telling me to shoot. I kind of swung my left foot and it kind of went in. That was cool.” The Tigers took one more shot with 10 ticks left, but Copeland headed it away and the Tigers and Pioneers settled for a 2-2 tie. “We possessed a lot,” Martinez said. “They capitalized on our mistakes. If we had a bad pass, that’s when they would come and hit us. Other than that, we controlled most of the game, but this year we have an issue with putting goals into the net.” The Pioneers host Baker Thursday at 6 p.m. “We need to win-out against Baker and Ontario,” Martinez said of the Pioneers’ postseason picture. “We need to focus and not get overconfident, then we will finish second (in the GOL). The top two go and we’ll get a home game (in the playoffs).” More like this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T22:43:28.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
