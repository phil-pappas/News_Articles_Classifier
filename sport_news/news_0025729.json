CHARLES – When St. Charles North girls tennis coach Sean Masoncup told his team throughout the season that 'every match counts', did it ever follow through to be true. \nThe North Stars came into this weekend's Upstate Eight Conference Tournament trailing Geneva by four points for in overall conference points. Although the North Stars swept doubles play, Geneva's Grace Krueger won the No. 1 singles title to help the Vikings hang on by one point over the North Stars to win the team title at the Upstate Eight Conference Tournament. \nNorth won the tournament over Geneva, 35-32, but the Vikings' four point lead proved valuable in winning its third straight conference team title, with 66 points to North's 65 overall. \nKrueger beat Streamwood's Alaina Kanthaphixay, 6-3, 6-4, to help Geneva just edge out North. \nAlthough Krueger was Geneva's only champion, the Vikings scored all important points in doubles play, with two second place and two third place finishes to hang on to the victory. \n\"It was one of my goals coming into the season, so it's a really great feeling,\" Krueger said of her conference title. \"I just tried hard to work hard throughout the season and it paid off.\" \n\"As a team, we got a lot of points in third and fourth place finishes that really matter,\" Krueger added. \"It just showed that even if they lost a match or weren't playing to the best of their ability, that they have a short memory and don't take it to the next match.\" \nIn his first year as girls tennis coach at Geneva, Zach Evans followed suit, leading the Vikings to their third straight UEC title. \nSure, he's the coach, but Evans said the girls worked hard all season and took care of business when it mattered most. Evans said a few matches stuck out to the importance of getting points this weekend, but Liz Prendergast's come from behind win to reach the No. 2 singles final was a big boost for the Vikings. \n\"It means a lot but it really had nothing to do with me,\" Evans said of the team's success. \"It's all due to the girls. We had a lot of depth and it didn't matter who I rotated in, they found ways to get wins for us. We have a very good team this season.\" \nThe win provides Krueger and the Vikings a bit of momentum heading into next weekend sectionals. But it also provided quite the boost for the North Stars and No.1 doubles pair Morgan Rerko and Emma Spellman. \nAfter earning the No. 1 seed at the tournament, the senior duo earned a bye before taking care of Batavia (6-0, 6-0) and St. Charles East's (6-4, 6-1) top doubles pair to earn the conference crown. \n\"I really think we're peaking at the right time,\" Rerko said. \"We've come a ways and have really gotten to know how to play alongside each other. The confidence this gives us moving into sectionals is huge.\" \n\"It's all about playing your best at the right time,\" Spellman added. \"We feel we've gotten a lot better since day one, and we're excited to keep playing and see how far we're able to go.\" \nThere was certainly a bit of disappointment from the North Stars, one point shy of forcing the tie-breaker to come into effect, which would have been most overall champions. The North Stars held that at a 4-1 edge. \n\"I feel bad for the girls because of how hard they have worked, but there's always winner and a loser in these tournaments,\" North coach Sean Masoncup said. \"Geneva is a great program and if you're going to lose, it should be to a team like that. We played phenomenal in my opinion.\" \nThe Tri-Cities schools held their own in the final standings as East (54) wrapped up third place, while Batavia secured fourth place with 51 points. \nBatavia got a conference champion at No. 3 singles as Kate McClure beat North's Madelyn Murray, 6-1, 6-1. East's top finishers were second-place results from its No.1 doubles pair of Emily Sullivan and Paige Ackerman, as well as its No. 3 doubles team of Maggie Petrov and Michelle Navid, who fell to North's Katelyn Boeke and Julia Nickolson in the finals. \n\"We did everything we could and there was nothing more that I could have asked from the girls,\" Masoncup said. We either exceeded or equalled seeding.\" \nFriday and Saturday's conference tournament was one last test before team's head to next weekend's sectionals at their respective sites. East will remain at home, hosting the sectional that will also include Geneva and the North Stars. Batavia and coach Brad Nelson will take part in the Naperville North Sectional. \n\"We have a good amount of momentum,\" Evans said. \"We had to scrape out some wins here this weekend and it's good to do that right before sectionals. I think the girls are as confident as they've been this year and we're all excited to see how this all plays out.\" \n\"It's the first time in quite a while that North has been in the hunt for a conference title,\" Masoncup said. \"We had the most champions by far and we are real excited going into sectionals. We're playing our best tennis at the right time and it showed this weekend.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:59:49.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
