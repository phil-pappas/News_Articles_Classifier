K.C. Johnson Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune Bulls coach Fred Hoiberg said Derrick Rose was getting \"cabin fever.\" \nDerrick Rose entered the remodeled Bulls locker room at the United Center on Monday night and squinted at the lights through a partially swollen left eye. \nThough Rose didn't have a formal session with reporters on his first day back with the Bulls, he said the fractured left orbital bone he had surgically repaired Sept. 30 is feeling better and he's scheduled to be fitted for a mask Tuesday. \nWith Rose expected to be cleared at least to run this week, the Bulls remain hopeful he's ready for the bright lights of the regular-season opener Oct. 27. Like most things at this time of the NBA calendar, it's a work in progress. \n\"From Derrick's standpoint, the biggest thing is just getting out of the house,\" coach Fred Hoiberg said. \"He was getting such cabin fever. The opportunity for him to get back in here is very important.\" \nRose watched the Bulls' 123-115 exhibition loss to the Pelicans from the locker room because Hoiberg said Rose still experiences blurry vision occasionally. \nHow well Rose's conditioning responds and how easily he adjusts to wearing a mask will determine whether he is ready when the regular season comes into focus. It will also be important to see how his vision responds once he begins activity. \n\"It's still very swollen, but he's definitely making progress from when I saw him a week ago,\" Hoiberg said. \nFor the third time since Rose suffered the injury in the first practice of training camp Sept. 29, coaches reviewed film with him. This time, the session came after the morning shootaround. \n\"He still isn't able to do anything as far as court work,\" Hoiberg said. \"Hopefully he'll get clearance in the next couple days to at least get a sweat going and get a little bit of running. \n\"Different guys learn different ways. It's very important once we get him back to show him and be able to run it firsthand to get the timing right. But he's able to pick it up quick. It's a lot of the same things we were doing, just adding on different wrinkles and different options.\" \nAs for the game, the Bulls blew a 20-point lead as Anthony Davis scored 26 points in 27 minutes to lead the Pelicans. Bobby Portis took advantage of early foul trouble from Nikola Mirotic and led the Bulls with 20 points and 11 rebounds. \n\"I'm just trying to bring positive energy,\" Portis said. \"I'm picking things up well.\" \nHoiberg again started Kirk Hinrich, Jimmy Butler, Tony Snell, Pau Gasol and Mirotic. Gasol logged second-half minutes (6:36) for the first time in his second exhibition appearance. \nHoiberg continues to insist Doug McDermott, who scored 17, will draw a start. Snell has struggled but scored 15 before leaving in the final minutes when he rolled his left ankle on Dante Cunningham's foot. \nSnell called the injury \"minor,\" but he used a crutch for support and limped through the postgame locker room. \n\"I like the rhythm that Doug's had coming off the bench,\" Hoiberg said. \"Tony takes a little pressure off of Jimmy in that lineup because he can guard the best perimeter player.\" \nLayups: Joakim Noah sat as a precaution for the second straight game after suffering a bruised left knee Thursday against the Nuggets. He participated in the shootaround, worked out before the game and will return either Wednesday or Monday. ... Hoiberg said Taj Gibson would make his exhibition debut either Wednesday or more likely Monday. ... Mike Dunleavy began work on a treadmill but is weeks away from returning from back surgery.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:30:32.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
