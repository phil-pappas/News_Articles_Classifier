But the Wolverines remained outside of the top five of NJ.com's Big Ten power rankings because of a season-opening loss to Utah and the undefeated records of other teams in the conference. \nAs time has passed, however, it's undeniable that Michigan is the best team in the conference. A seven-point road loss to the Utes, who are now ranked fourth nationally, no longer looks like much of a blemish. Meanwhile, the Wolverines have throttled their next five opponents by a combined score of 160-14. \nMichigan brings three straight shutouts into Saturday's huge matchup with rival Michigan State. The Spartans are 6-0, but they appear vulnerable after beating Rutgers and Purdue by a combined 10 points in the past two weeks. \nThat instate showdown will establish the early leader in the Big Ten East Division, while matchups with Ohio State loom for both teams. The West Division appears wide open, but Iowa can grab hold of the top spot with a win over Northwestern on Saturday. \nPLUS: Norries Wilson earned Rutgers players' respect as interim coach \nCheck out the Week 5 power rankings to see how much teams moved up or down.
