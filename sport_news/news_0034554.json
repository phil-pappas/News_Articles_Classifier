Katz spoke to an NCAA expert who gave him the rundown on the penalties the Cards could face. The expert said IF the allegations are proven true, Louisville would be subject to a Level 1 case . What does that mean? According to Katz: Recruiting sanctions Scholarships taken away Postseason ban \nThe expert also said the NCAA will require full cooperation from current players, former players, and recruits, and that historically, if the allegations aren’t categorically denied immediately, that’s not a good sign for the school. So far, no one in the Louisville administration, especially Rick Pitino, has denied anything except knowledge of the situation.

There’s a 50/50 shot I leave alive after rubbing this some of the fan’s faces. I’ll take my chances. THE MAN October 9, 2015 at 1:36   \nHow can Pitino survive this?

That’s why. Rixter October 9, 2015 at 4:45 pm | Permalink \nHow? The university president doesn’t care, and Pitino’s boss, the Athletic Director doesn’t care. That’s how. Just win, baby!

Murica October 9, 2015 at 2:19 pm | Permalink \nUNC violations are small time now. The shameful acts committed by UL really makes all of America look like a third world country, and UL is essentially the Taliban of North America. If the NCAA doesn’t punish UL, I would be in favor of sending in the Marines to clean out that cesspool. WTF October 9, 2015 at 2:42 pm | Permalink \n(Murica) That had to be the most ignorant comment I have read on here and I have read numerous comments that blew my mind how stupid people are. Huh? October 9, 2015 at 1:43   \nDon’t know what the various levels of sanctions are but no mention of games being forfeited for ineligle players? If not than other than Pitino leaving seems UL won’t get hit that hard doc October 9, 2015 at 1:45 pm | Permalink \nI doubt they will take any games away. Unless they can prove that a player came to UofL only because of this mess, it’s next to impossible to declare anyone ineligible. TeamNoSheep October 9, 2015 at 1:51 pm | Permalink \nRemoving scholarships, limiting recruiting activities (or TV appearances), and taking UL out of the postseason would destroy their ability to recruit. It would probably push some current players to transfer. In short, it would take years for UL to recover. Retroactively taking away wins doesn’t really hurt anyone but the coaches ego. \nThe thing that bothers me is that Rick could probably resign and have a new job by next weekend. He’d escape scot-free unless he stays to “take his whipping” or the NCAA institutes a show-cause penalty, which I’d doubt they’d do to a HOF coach. matt October 9, 2015 at 2:02 pm | Permalink \nit doesn’t just have to be a recruit that came because of strippers. Up until last year coaches couldn’t even provide jelly for athletes to put on their bagels, a coach paying for strippers to perform for current players is most definitely an impermissible benefit. If McGee paid for strippers to perform for Behanan that is a violation. Kevin Ollie October 9, 2015 at 2:06 pm | Permalink \nUConn won the national title one year after their postseason ban.

Why would this be any different? memphis October 9, 2015 at 2:27 pm | Permalink \nCal and Penn State didn’t win national championships. If they had lost to Michigan, they might take their banner but I don’t see them taking a championship. ukjaybrat October 9, 2015 at 2:43 pm | Permalink \n@memphis, but what about their final four year? just bc they won a championship, they’re going to leave all the games in place? \nPersonally, I think taking or leaving games based on whether or not a team won a championship is just stupid. a violation is a violation. games are games, whether it includes an NC or not. Ha! October 9, 2015 at 2:56 pm | Permalink \nIf the NCAA really wanted to prevent this stuff from happening in the future, you would think they WOULD strip a title. Now would be a good time to start. \nSelf-imposed sanctions are just a slap on the wrist. You start taking banners, coaches might actually start making sure this shit doesn’t happen. Sunni about that October 9, 2015 at 3:15 pm | Permalink \nDoc, don’t know if they have ever had to prove a recruit came to a school because of impermissible benefits such as money or hookers. What about Marcus Camby? Took benefits from an agent as a senior which made him ineligible. These UL guys are certainly then ineligible. doc October 9, 2015 at 3:18 pm | Permalink \nExpecting to make sense of anything the NCAA does is a waste of time. They may hit the hard, they may not. It just depends on which way the wind is blowing that day. Davender's Goggles October 9, 2015 at 1:43   \nIf the allegations are true (and it’s looking more and more like they are), whether Pitino knew about it or not is really beside the point – he has to be fired either way. I think he’s made it perfectly clear he ain’t resigning, and as close as him and TJ are, it’s almost hard to envision him being fired… but I don’t see how they can expect anyone to take them seriously as a program if they keep him. EverythingsBlue October 9, 2015 at 1:46   \nIs it me, or does Katz seem a bit…..u …..”rattled” by the potential ramifications for Louisville AND Pitino? Phantom October 9, 2015 at 1:46   \nThe way I look at it, with how the NCAA treated Coach Cal in the Rose thing, where they had NO proof, it would be a travesty if they didn’t forfeit some wins in UofL’s case here which appears to have LOTS of proof. Wait! October 9, 2015 at 3:23 pm | Permalink \nIf they can’t take down banners for USING HOOKERS to get those banners then they have no business sanctioning anybody for anything. Buck Naked October 9, 2015 at 1:51   \nAfter the NCAA botched the Miami football scandal and the North Carolina basketball scandal…..why would anyone put faith in the NCAA? They have no credibility or ability to enforce any penalties now. Louisville will be in and out of the news all season and then some random report will come out next summer when nobody is paying attention to college basketball. Duff October 9, 2015 at 1:56   \nThat program is toast, but as of right now I do not see Pitino going anywhere. He already said he is not resigning and there does not seem to be much evidence to suggest he knew. If there was evidence, it more than likely would have been in that book. Powell is the only one who said Pitino knew, and she has not provided any hard evidence. If U of L can keep Pitino separate from Magee, then they keep him. Davender's Goggles October 9, 2015 at 2:06 pm | Permalink \nThat’s a good point – there likely is no evidence that proves Pitino knew about it. Although to most any objective party that seems completely implausible, they will only fire him if there is proof he knew about it…. makes me wonder if the pressure becomes intense enough for Magee, would he spill it all. I guess this is obvious, but he seems like the huge X factor in all of this. \nThe truth of the matter is, we know the NCAA takes months to decide on much less complex situations than this – this will likely be a long, long process. ukjaybrat October 9, 2015 at 2:45 pm | Permalink \nsyracuse and smu would disagree with the notion that “not knowing” is good enough to not be in trouble. even if pitino isn’t fired, he won’t be on the sideline for a third (or more) of the season Wait, it's Louisville October 9, 2015 at 3:26 pm | Permalink \nI certainly hope they do keep Pitino because after the two banners come down for ineligible players we will be able to make fun of them forever. And there is no moral argument that they got rid of him. … As if they had any morals. Duff October 9, 2015 at 4:21 pm | Permalink \nLouisville knows they are in trouble. A lot of trouble. But, if I’m Louisville, I am going to do my best to keep Pitino. Distance myself from him for now? Yes. But, if I am thinking in terms of my program’s future, who am I going to attract to replace him? No one! Louisville is not an elite program, but they do have an elite coach. If there’s nothing there to connect Pitino to Magee, and enough there to solely put this on Magee, I keep Pitino. Louisville is just waiting for all the facts to come out. Smyrna_Cat October 9, 2015 at 2:03   \nIt is hard to imagine this not being partially (or mostly … completely?) true based on comments from UL. I expect many ex players will probably try to offer as little info as possible since the NCAA has no impact on them. Existing players and recruits that went to other schools will be a lot more direct and upfront. I expect everyone will try hard to avoid any discussion of sex. For me, the biggest question is whether McGee cuts a deal (he might if the evidence against him is as strong as it appears to be) or if he keeps quiet. \nI think UL reaches an agreement with Pitino for him leaving.

The Whore will end up in prison for pimping her underage daughter. I am sure the DA office in Louisville is working hard to clean the mess up. Tej October 9, 2015 at 2:11   \nThe question is whether the NCAA will rule within the next 2-3 years. We certainly want and expect a thorough investigation of any violation no matter the school. But, we’ve learned that for some unknown reason, the NCAA does not act with any speed. The UNC investigation has gone on for a couple years and there’s no reason to believe UL’s will be any shorter. The issues and the evidence in these cases are not overly complicated. Surely, 6 months is adequate time to interview witnesses, conduct a hearing, and rule. NCAA October 9, 2015 at 2:13   \nWe take care of our own, and UK is not one of ours since you took Terrence Jones. Kansas, Duke U of L and N Carolina came to us on their knees, where they belong. They know how to grovel the right way. Skal will never see the court at UK! We call it Kantering a recruit! UKALLDAY October 9, 2015 at 2:18   \nLouisville is toast, who cares they weren’t going to be good anyway …. So if Blakaney and his dad excepted services from the whores.

Shaka October 9, 2015 at 2:23   \nMcGee will not cut any deals. His lawyer is a big UL alum. Wasn’t he the same guy who represented Chris Jones? Curious where not so wealthy guys like Jones and Mcgee get the money to pay for these expensive attorneys or maybe they are just working for free to help out their favorite school? Louisville athletes never seem to have a problem finding money to pay professionals. ukjaybrat October 9, 2015 at 2:50 pm | Permalink \nMcGee will take the fall and get a HUGE paycheck in the mail in exchange for keeping his mouth shut J-Dub421 October 9, 2015 at 3:07 pm | Permalink \nHopefully the NCAA will follow the money trail. There is simply no way that McGee had the funds to do this by himself. Computer Blue October 9, 2015 at 3:09   \nJurich is the person responsible for this. Due to his suppression of the media in Louisville he has lowered the accountable of his self and department. That has lead to this travesty along with the taxpayer theft of the Yum Center.

That’s why it should be abolished. And what is bothering me is that with all the time required of the NCAA to investigate Lou, UNC, and who knows who else, when will they have time to make a ruling on Skal? The season is knocking on our door. M@dScientist October 9, 2015 at 3:35   \nI love the quotes from Pitino that “I don’t know what resigning would accomplish, I think that’s the cowardly way out.” And how he was upset the President didn’t mention him in his new conference. Really? Take a hint. Just because you don’t want to resign doesn’t mean you’ll be coaching next year! October 9, 2015 at 3:39   \nAnybody else remember when they took your game off of TV? Man that was a sucky season. Duperclay October 9, 2015 at 4:08   \nThe NCAA wiped out the Gophers final four year in 97 after it was found that school work was done for some of the players. Academic fraud. They got hit hard as far as recruiting sanctions go. But the coach Clem Haskins was proven right away that he was heavily involved in it all. Stitch Jones October 9, 2015 at 4:28   \nNail these losers….You cannot ignore the long history of Louisville sports being so corrupt…. The national media is shining a light on this story and is starting to realize what we have been saying for a long time. Jurich, Pirino and Petrino are win at all cost scumbags. They speak of “being a Louisville Man”. If the example they put forth is it…I would never want to be one… The hypocrisy here is laughable….. My guess is Richard Pitino is somehow involved with this mess and it is going to get bad quickly…. I hope the NCAA does the right thing and punishes the program accordingly.
