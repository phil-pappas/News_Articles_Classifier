The Wallabies knocked the hosts out of their own tournament with an excellent display of rugby that will make them a side to be feared going into the knockout stage. In the third minute, Mike Brown produced a superb try-saving tackle, denying the Australians a try. Four minutes later though, Bernard Foley put his side in front with a well struck penalty. In the 10th minute, the Aussies were forced into a substitution with Kurtley Beale replacing the injured Rob Horne. Owen Farrell levelled matters in the 12th minute for the English. Seven minutes later Foley dived over for the first try of the match and from then on there was no stopping Michael Cheika’s charges as they went on to lead 17-3 at the break. George Ford was introduced in place of Jonny May as the Roses looked to flip the match in their favour. In the 49th minute, the men in gold increased their lead through Foley’s boot as he scored yet another penalty to make it 20-3. Cheika’s men were caught napping in the 55th minute and Anthony Watson beat two defenders and dived over to make it 20-10 after the conversion. Stuart Lancaster’s troops looked to slowly reduce the deficit when in the 64th minute Farrell slotted over a penalty. The scoreline sat at 20-13 heading into the final quarter and the home crowd believed there was still a chance. In the 71st minute, Foley put the match to bed with a superb penalty and just as the match looked all but settled, Matt Giteau scored a late try for the two-time world champions to wrap up a 33-13 hiding to condemn Lancaster’s lads to a first round exit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T23:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T01:48:35.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
