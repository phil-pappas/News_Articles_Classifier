(AP) - Planned Parenthood of Northern New England patients and supporters plan to gather at the New Hampshire State House as part of a national show of support for its services as members of Congress fight over its funding.\nThe gathering Tuesday at 8 p.m. is dubbed \"National Pink Out Day.\" Similar events are scheduled at the University of New Hampshire, Dartmouth College and Colby Sawyer College.\nSome conservatives want taxpayer money withheld from the women's health care provider after the release of secret videos in which Planned Parenthood officials discussed the transfer of fetal tissue to researchers. The anti-abortion activists who made the videos say they show that Planned Parenthood is illegally profiting from fetal organ sales, an accusation the group denies.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:28:20.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
