Her mother Shanti Devi claims Heera, who was named Geeta by Bilquis Edhi of Edhi Foundation that looked after her in Pakistan, disappeared a decade ago from a Baisakhi mela at Malia village, near Kartarpur in Jalandhar, where she was married. Heera’s son Santosh, who was five months old then, is excited to meet his mother. He has since been raised by her maternal uncle Vinod Mahto here. Shanti says she recognised her daughter on seeing her picture in the media and went to meet External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj along with her family. The family moved from Bihar to Ludhiana for work 35 years ago. Shanti’s husband Janardan Mahto currently lives at their village in Saharsa district. Heera’s elder brother Vinod (31), who works with a private company, says they are seven siblings and Heera was 19 years old when she disappeared. “Her appearance seems to have changed a bit over the years, but she resembles my sister. We will go to receive her when she returns. We are ready for a DNA test,” he says. The family has not been in touch with Heera’s husband ever since her disappearance. Santosh, who was born at the parental home, has been living with them ever since. “We lost her at a Baisakhi mela and looked for her at railway stations in Kapurthala, Nawanshahr, Jalandhar and Chandigarh, besides orphanages, but could not find her. We also lodged a missing person’s report with the police,” says Vinod. On the basis of inputs gathered from her Ludhiana-based siblings, the Kartarpur police have traced a copy of the missing person’s report lodged on April 26, 2006. Kartarpur SHO Dilbagh Singh said someone came to the police station on Friday to get the report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:18:11.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
