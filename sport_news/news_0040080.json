He’ll face Texas lefty Cole Hamels .\nAfter losing the first two games at home, then bouncing back in Game 3 on Sunday night, the Blue Jays routed the Rangers in Texas. Toronto started knuckleballer R.A. Dickey , the 2012 NL Cy Young winner, and replaced him during the fifth inning with hard-throwing left-hander David Price , who won the AL award in 2012.\nNow Stroman, who spent most of the summer rehabbing his knee at Duke University while also finishing up his degree, will try to pitch the Blue Jays into their first AL Championship Series since 1993, when Toronto won the second of back-to-back World Series titles.\n“I’m just so excited for this opportunity,” the 24-year-old righty said Tuesday as the Blue Jays held an optional workout. “Those dog days at Duke when it’s kind of tough to get through a workout with the knee pain, that’s what you kind of have in the back of your mind to keep you going.”\nStroman allowed four runs, three earned, over seven innings but didn’t get a decision in Game 2, which Texas won 6-4 in 14 innings.\n“Look, he’s a tough opponent,” Rangers manager Jeff Banister said Tuesday as his team worked out in Texas before flying to Toronto. “This kid’s got electric stuff.”\nCatcher Chris Gimenez said it will be important for the Rangers to try and slow down Stroman’s pace.\n“He loves to work quick,” Gimenez said. “He’s very exuberant on the mound with his emotions, and that’s a good thing, don’t get me wrong. But for us to be successful, we’ve really got to stick to our game plan, which is bringing him up in the zone, slowing him down and getting him in the middle of the plate.”\nJust as he was in Game 2, Stroman will be opposed by Hamels.\n“Who else would you rather have on the mound when you have to win a game than your ace?” Gimenez asked.\nThe Rangers also hope to have four-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glove winner Adrian Beltre in the lineup again Wednesday. The slugger left Game 1 with a strained back but returned with two hits in Game 4. Banister said Tuesday that he hadn’t heard anything new from his training staff about Beltre’s condition.\n“I take that as we’re all good,” Banister said.\nGibbons wouldn’t say whether Price, who threw 50 pitches in a three-inning relief stint Monday, would be available out of the bullpen again Wednesday.\n“I wouldn’t necessarily count on it,” Gibbons said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:22:50.287+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
