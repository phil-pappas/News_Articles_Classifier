(Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty Images) \nCristiano Ronaldo collected his fourth Golden Boot award this week, and his family, including mom Dolores and young son Cristiano Ronaldo Jr., accompanied him to Tuesday’s award ceremony. It wasn’t anything that happened on stage, however, that’s got people talking today. Instead, Thursday’s buzz is all about a short backstage conversation that was caught on video. \nThat’s the elder Ronaldo’s mother and Ronaldo’s son apparently discussing the Real Madrid star’s greatest rival, Lionel Messi, who plays for Barcelona. Ronaldo’s son seems to ask how many FIFA Ballon d’Or awards and Golden Boots Messi’s won. Dolores, however, isn’t having it. \n“I don’t want to know about Messi,” she says, then proceeds to list off her son’s accomplishments instead. \nFor the record, Ronaldo has three Ballon d’Or awards and four Golden Boots. Messi, meanwhile, has four Ballon d’Ors (one he won when it was still called FIFA’s World Player of the Year award) and three Golden Boots. \nAlthough some might presume Dolores was mad at her grandson’s question, that’s likely not the case. The youngest Ronaldo’s interest in his dad’s rival is nothing new. Backstage at this year’s ceremony for the Ballon d’Or, which Ronaldo beat out Messi for, Ronaldo’s son actually met Messi and the two had an adorable exchange. \nIt doesn’t seem Ronaldo has a problem with his son looking up to fellow strikers either. What Ronaldo might have a problem with, though, is his son looking up to goalkeepers. In the trailer for Ronaldo’s upcoming documentary about his life, the two discuss what his son wants to be when he grows up. \n“I’m going to be a goalkeeper? Okay, dad?” \n“A goalkeeper? Are you joking?” Ronaldo answers.
