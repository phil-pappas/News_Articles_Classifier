When they get inside the ropes for the final round at the TPC Sawgrass Dye’s Valley, instincts will take over and it will be more about winning a golf tournament than protecting their position among the top-25 on the Web.com Finals money list, the threshold for returning to the big Tour. \n“I came here to try to win the event,” said Grillo, another in a long line of talented players from Argentina and the 54-hole leader at 13-under-par 197 after he birdied three-of-six holes on the back nine for a 67. “You don’t get anywhere trying to save what you’ve got.” \nA shot behind is Reavie, who birdied the 17th hole for a 67 to finish two shots behind Grillo at 11-under 199. Glover (69), who parred his first 15 holes before his only birdie of the day at No. 16, is third at 10-under and Saunders (68) is fourth at 9-under. \n“[Sunday], you’ve got to come out and shoot the lowest number ... that’s the only thing that matters,” Reavie said about having card in hand, which was the case when he won the second leg of the Web.com Finals two weeks ago in Davidson, N.C. “I can be more aggressive.” \nGlover, who hit 15-of-18 greens, said his long string of pars was not the product of conservative play. He challenged the downwind holes and posted his 15th under-par score in his last 19 rounds, encompassing the three Web.com Finals and the Wyndham Championship on the PGA Tour. \n“That was the best I played all week,” Glover said of his tee-to-green game. “I hit a bunch of good putts and was all over the hole all day.” \nWinning the tournament for any of the front-runners, depending on how others finish, could well give any of them the Finals money title and with it a full exemption onto the PGA Tour for the 2015-16 season and a berth in The Players Championship. That’s enough of a plum to throw caution to the wind, so to speak, and enter the new season without having to worry about their priority status. \n“It’s everything,” Reavie said. “It’s not being in the re-shuffle [priority] category. It’s picking my schedule, it’s being in The Players.” \nDesperation time is reserved for the players near the bottom of the top-25 in Finals earnings. \nFive players among the top-25 entering the Web.com Tour Championship missed the cut, effectively dousing their chances: Eric Axley, Ryan Spears, Steve Allan, Justin Hicks and Jhonattan Vegas. \nThe five projected into the top-25 to replace them, based on their tournament standing after the third round, are Robert Garrigus, defending champion Derek Fathauer, Tyrone Van Aswegen, Greg Eason and Kevin Tway. \nThose five are playing hard: their average score in the third round was 67.4. Tway has made the biggest leap up the Finals money list, going from 62nd to a projected 23rd after a 67 that left him tied for seventh in the tournament. Van Aswegen (66, tie for fifth), has jumped from 44th to 15th and Eason (70, tie for 12th) has gone from 46th to a projected 24th. \nGarrigus (projected 21st) and Fathauer (22nd), who are tied for 17th, have risen 12 spots. \nBased on last year’s money list, conservative estimates by the Web.com Tour are that nine cards are in play for Sunday’s final round. \nTwo players from the PGA Tour FedEx Cup list who entered the Tour Championship with no finals earnings had big days on Saturday to give themselves a fighting chance. \nLuke Guthrie of Ponte Vedra Beach (65) and Andres Romero (66) a countryman of Grillo are tied for seventh and projected to be in a tie for 32nd in Finals earnings.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T07:16:32.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
