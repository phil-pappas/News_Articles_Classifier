Before two weeks ago, the last time I'd watched a pro baseball game on TV was before my kids were born, and I'm a grandma now. I attended a few games in Milwaukee to see the Brewers play and traveled to Wrigley Field in Chicago a few times after the children came along. But I was more interested in hanging with friends and drinking beer than watching the game, which always seemed so long and boring. Not like football, with all its action. With all the hoopla surrounding the Chicago Cubs, though, I've been faithfully watching the Cubbies since Oct. 7. That's when Jake Arrieta so skillfully pitched against the Pittsburgh Pirates to win the wild-card game 4-0, enabling the Cubbies to advance in the playoffs. I took in the game out of the corner of my eye as I worked a night shift at the News Tower. Early on during Tuesday's game, which of course ended in a glorious 6-4 win against rival St. Louis Cardinals in Chicago, I was focused. My eyes zeroed in on practically every Arrieta pitch. So precise! How can he make the ball drop like that? Wow! But then, I became distracted. I noticed a graphic on the bottom right side of the television screen with nine little squares and some backward \"K\"s inside and outside a grid. What the heck? My boyfriend explained that the graphic's aim is to look like a batter's box. And that the grid represents the strike zone. At that point, I recognized it was better to not ask too many questions during the game. I learned the next day from asking sports writers Jay Taft and Matt Trowbridge that a backward \"K\" represents a strike that was called by the umpire and a \"K\" represents a swing-and-miss by the batter. And through Googling, I found out: — That the KZone system was first developed for ESPN in 2001 by Sportsvision Inc. and is now used by many other networks as well. — Its aim is to depict through an animated graphic the strike zone and whether the ball that was pitched was in reality a ball or a strike. — And that the system is only for entertainment purposes. Now that I understand what the KZone is, I'm going to try to disregard it completely — even if I have to put my hand in front of my eyes to block out the bottom right of the TV screen — while I'm watching Arrieta and other Cubs pitchers continue their quest toward winning the World Series for the first time since 1908. I can pretty well second-guess the umps' calls on my own. I don't need any comparatively newfangled gizmo to divert my attention from the actual pitch. Page 2 of 2 - Taft begs to differ with regard to the usefulness of the KZone. \"It's helpful for the true baseball fan,\" he told me. Ouch, but touche!
