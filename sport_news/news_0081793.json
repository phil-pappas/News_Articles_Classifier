After shooting the professor, the students took cover and were then asked to stand if they were Christian, according to her account . He then told them they were going to meet God before shooting them, she said.\nThe victim, Anastasia Boylan, is undergoing surgery for a bullet wound to her spine but is expected to survive .\nHarper-Mercer was also the son of an interracial couple, and his Spiritual Passions dating profile says he was looking for a female of a similar ethnicity. His profile says he was a Leo and his stance on drugs was \"never.\"\nWhile there are few, if any, extreme red flags from the shooter's personality and online profiles, the most telling may be the fact that he grew up without a father figure , according to information his uncle relayed to the Daily Beast.\nAn Inquisitir roundup of Mercer's social media profiles reveals he was a supporter of the Irish Republican Army.\nA Guardian report addresses rumors that a warning was posted to the messaging site 4chan early Thursday morning saying, \"Don't go to school tomorrow if you are in the Northwest.\" The report also says, however, that verifying the source of the post is hard because all posts to the site \"are by definition anonymous.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.inquisitr.com/2463920/chris-harper-mercer-26-year-old-shooters-myspace-facebook-instagram-twitter-trail-did-harper-mercer-post-a-warning-on-4chan/", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/02/ce/3d/shooterprofile.JPG", "http://ktla.com/2015/10/01/umpqua-community-college-shooter-targeted-christians-father-of-oregon-shooting-victim-says/", "http://spiritualpassions.com/seeme/ironcross45.html", "http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/oct/02/chris-harper-mercer-first-details-emerge-of-oregon-college-killer"], "published": "2015-10-02T20:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:21:14.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
