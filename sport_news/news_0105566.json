Photograph by: Alec Salloum , Regina Leader-Post \nREGINA — Six is the magic number for Finley Easton and the LeBoldus Golden Suns so far this season. \nLeBoldus completed its regular-season schedule with six victories in as many games by defeating the Winston Knoll Wolverines 62-0 on Friday at Mosaic Stadium. \nAnd, once again, Easton had a six-pointer — something in which he specializes. \nThe Grade 12 slotback had his seventh touchdown reception of the season Friday, when he hauled in a 25-yarder from Brayden Kuski in the Schwann Conference game. \nAs usual, Easton made the reception count. Seven of his nine receptions this season have produced a major. \n“I try to even it out with a couple of more receptions, but that’s the way the game goes,’’ Easton said with a chuckle. “I’ve had good luck and I’ve been able to make it to the end zone.” \nHe usually does it from a considerable distance. His average per catch is an eye-popping 31.8 yards. \nEaston’s big-play capability was also evident when he returned a punt for a touchdown in the regular-season opener. \nIt has been that kind of year for the John Foord-coached Golden Suns, who have won the past three city and provincial 4A football titles. This season, LeBoldus has outscored the opposition 322-34. \nSemba Mbasela has some impressive numbers of his own. \nOn Friday, the Grade 11 running back gained 272 yards on 23 carries — the last of which was a 33-yarder that put him over the 1,000-yard mark for the season. He finished the regular season with 1,013 yards, which is quite the feat over a short campaign. \n“I’m very happy for him,” Easton said of Mbasela. “We’re a good running team and Coach Foord takes a lot of pride in that. It’s great that (Mbasela) was able to do that.” \nMbasela rushed for touchdowns of eight, eight and 25 yards on Friday. Kuski threw two TD passes during another dominant performance by the Golden Suns, who have won 35 of their past 36 games (including 10 in a row). \nIn other Schwann Conference action Friday, the Riffel Royals defeated the Sheldon-Williams Spartans 32-7 and the Campbell Tartans downed the Balfour Bears 64-0. \nCampbell placed second in the Schwann Conference with a 5-1 record, followed by Riffel (4-2), Sheldon-Williams (3-3), Winston Knoll (2-4), Balfour (1-5) and the Thom Trojans (0-6). \nThe Schwann Conference quarterfinals are set for Friday, when LeBoldus will receive a first-round bye. The quarterfinal matchups will be Campbell versus Thom, Riffel versus Balfour and Sheldon-Williams versus Winston Knoll.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:42:12.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
