He has done marvellous things for this country and this rugby team.” \nJapan coach Eddie Jones weighed into the debate in his Daily Mail column, saying Lancaster was entitled to a “proper review”. But that did not stop the Australian lining himself up as a possible replacement. \n“If England approached me, would I listen to them? Of course I would, but whether the RFU part ways with Stuart Lancaster is a big and difficult decision,” he wrote. \nEngland have already felt the reverberations of becoming the first former winners to go out in the pool stage when they slumped to eighth in the latest world rankings, equalling their lowest ever position. \nThere could also be repercussions from governing body World Rugby who said in a statement on Monday they were probing an alleged “breach of the match-day communications protocol” by the England coaching team during the 33-13 loss to Australia. \nThere was good and bad news on Monday for the Wallabies, whose game against Wales on Saturday will decide who finishes top of Pool A. \nAustralia winger Rob Horne’s shoulder injury is not as bad as feared but they could lose loose forward Michael Hooper who has been cited for charging into a ruck shoulder first against England. \nSamoans Alesana Tuilagi and Faifili Levave were also cited for foul play during the loss to Japan on Saturday and could miss their country’s final Pool B match against Scotland. \nTalk of South Africa’s demise after a shock defeat by Japan in their opening game has dissipated after wins over Samoa and Scotland and coach Heyneke Meyer played it safe by naming a strong side for the Pool B finale against the United States on Wednesday. \nWith a victory still required to ensure they reach the quarter-finals Meyer has made just two changes, both due to injuries, to his starting lineup. \nTighthead prop Frans Malherbe replaces Jannie du Plessis for his first start of the year, while speedster Lwazi Mvovo comes in for JP Pietersen, with Bryan Habana moving over to the right wing. \nThe two matches on Tuesday offer four teams the chance of winning their first match of the tournament. \nFiji, after spirited performances in defeat by England, Australia and Wales in Pool A, start as hot favourites to beat Uruguay while Canada face Romania in Pool D.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:21:09.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
