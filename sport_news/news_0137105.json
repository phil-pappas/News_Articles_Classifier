First Half Highlights: Ramapo had a near perfect first drive, capping it off when Joe O'Hagan crashed through the middle for a score from four yards out. The drive was a good mix of running and passing, with four first downs and a touchdown on nine plays. After forcing a Wayne Hills punt, Ramapo went 58 yards on seven plays, this time Keith Woetzel scoring on the quarterback keeper from 14 yards out to make it 14-0. This was accomplished in similar fashion to the first drive, with three first downs and a touchdown in seven plays. Wayne Hills got things going on a shovel pass from Brandon DeVera to Luca Grave for 61 yards to the 13. Two plays later, DeVera found Vinny Loverde near the left pylon for an eight yard score. Ramapo went eleven plays from their 20 and had first and goal from the seven, but a field goal attempt was wide right and the Raiders came away empty. A key play in the drive was a 52 yard completion to Jack Scordato, who was wide open on the left sideline. Ramapo had another drive, scoring on an eight yard run from O'Hagan to make it 20-7, with five minutes left in the half. It was another nine play drive, picking up four first downs along the way. The play to set up the score was a 32 yard pass to Greg Latushko on the left sideline, where he did the tightrope walk before going out of bounds. Wayne Hills went on a twelve play drive down to the 12 yard line, but their chances of closing the gap went down when Latushko intercepted in the end zone with 30 seconds left in the half. Second Half Highlights: Halfway through the third quarter, Ramapo went 94 yards on fourteen plays, scoring on a Woetzel keeper for 27 yards on fourth and eleven and made it 27-7, with 1:22 left in the quarter. In addition, Ramapo picked up five first downs along the way and all but nailed the door shut for Wayne Hills. Wayne Hills went twelve plays, but Latushko intercepted another pass at the one yard line, advancing it to the ten. Ramapo made it past midfield and ended up punting, as Wayne Hills went past midfield, courtesy of a 43 yard pass to Joe Kenny, who had a great run across the field after the catch. Once again, Ramapo struck back, with Woetzel intercepting on the 11 and going 89 yards for the score with two and a half minutes left. Play of The Game: Woetzel's touchdown saving tackle in the third quarter kept Wayne Hills out of the end zone and shut down any chance they had of getting back into the game. It also showed heart and desire to run down the carrier on a breakaway. Game Balls: Woetzel was sensational, completing 14 of 24 for 200 yards, rushing for 107 and two touchdowns on 14 carries, making a touchdown saving tackle in the third quarter, returning an interception 89 yards for the score, and being in on numerous other tackles. O'Hagan ran for 111 yards and two scores on 23 carries. The line was outstanding, helping the Raiders to 441 yards of total offense - one drive was for nine yards, making the balance 432 yards on six drives. The line, left to right, consists of Chris DiTommaso, Matt Connor, Jack Allen, Christian Nazare, and Brian Raguseo. Latushko had two interceptions to kill scoring drives deep into their territory and caught five for 52 yards, symbolizing Ramapo's defense bending, but not breaking at times, making the plays to stop Wayne Hills. In addition, Ramapo's receivers did an outstanding job blocking on plays like the bubble screen, getting them extra yardage. In a losing cause, Grave rushed for 145 yards on 16 carries and caught a shovel pass for 61. Kenny had five receptions for 86 yards and had a hand on his share of tackles. Audibles: Ramapo head coach Drew Gibbs - \"Woetzel is a team player and does what he is asked. The bigger the moment, the more he steps up. Our offensive line dominated from start to finish. The rivalry means a lot and is important to any player who ever wore a Ramapo uniform.\"Ramapo QB/DB Keith Woetzel - \"When I intercepted the ball, I kept my eye on the receiver and saw the quarterback release it. I got the ball and the blockers did the rest. We always hustle, never give up; when I caught the runner on the long run, they didn't get it into the end zone and that's why it pays to hustle. On offense, I give credit to our line: they're big and were physical. We've played against the Wayne Hills kids since third grade and there's nothing better than beating them.\"Ramapo RB/DB Joe O'Hagan - \"Our offensive line was great tonight. After that first drive, we knew they couldn't stop us. It's an incredible rivalry and it's great to win in our senior year.\"Ramapo WR/DB Greg Latushko - \"On the interceptions, we worked on those plays this week. I saw the passes coming and made the plays. Coach Gibbs talked about the rivalry this week and how it's the best game to play in.\" FEATURED PRODUCT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:52:03.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
