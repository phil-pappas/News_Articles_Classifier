Violence marked the run-up to the poll, with at least three people killed, and many worry that street protests in the coming days could lead to deadly confrontations with security forces.\nAt least seven people were killed in election-related violence in 2010 — when Conde defeated Diallo in a runoff — and some 50 people died in the run-up to Guinea's 2013 legislative elections, according to Human Rights Watch .\nEarlier this week, Diallo and fellow opposition candidate Sidya Toure — who placed third in 2010 — alleged fraud and said they would not recognize the results.\nPreliminary results available earlier Saturday placed Conde well out in front, and Diallo told reporters in a statement delivered from his Conakry home that he would organize demonstrations, saying he did not trust the courts to address his concerns.\n\"I will invite the other candidates and all the citizens who are the real victims of this electoral hold-up to organize, conforming to the law, peaceful demonstrations to express our disapproval of this situation,\" Diallo said.\nConde's supporters credit him with improving the electricity supply in the capital, Conakry, and keeping the country relatively stable despite an Ebola epidemic that has killed more than 2,500 people in Guinea.", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:28:38.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
