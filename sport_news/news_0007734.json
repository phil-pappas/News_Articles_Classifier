Once again, Tom Brady and the league’s highest-scoring offense foiled the upstart Jets in a 30-23 victory that wasn’t decided until the last second.\nThe loss drops the Jets’ record to 4-2, two games behind the undefeated Patriots, and dampens New York’s odds of ending New England’s six-season reign atop the division. The consolation is that the Jets have 10 games left, remain in control of a wild-card playoff spot and get another stab at the defending Super Bowl champs at MetLife Stadium on Dec. 27.\n“It was our fault,” said Jets first-year head coach Todd Bowles, who by losing in New England completed a sort of NFL head-coaching rite of passage. “We fought until the end and it wasn’t good enough.”\nThe final score probably shouldn’t have been as close as it was. Patriots receiver Brandon LaFell dropped four passes in his season debut, and teammate Julian Edelman flubbed another in the end zone on the second half’s opening drive. The Patriots had to settle for a field goal, which gave them a 16-10 lead that the Jets quickly erased.\nOn the next drive, Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick led the team on an 80-yard drive that ended when he found Chris Ivory wide open by the right sideline for a nine-yard touchdown pass. It was Ivory’s most productive play of the game, as the Patriots loaded the line of scrimmage with defenders to hold the running back to only 41 rushing yards on 17 carries.\nBut remember the Patriots’ dropped passes? Well, the universe evened everything out. Fitzpatrick—who had his best and first interception-free game of the year by completing 22 of 39 pass attempts for 295 yards and two touchdowns—threw to receiver Brandon Marshall at the goal line early in the fourth quarter. The pass had to be slightly behind Marshall, to his right, since two defenders were to his left. Marshall twisted around and got hands on the ball but couldn’t haul it in. “That is all on me,” Marshall said.\nThe Jets instead kicked a 30-yard field goal, which gave them a short-lived 20-16 lead. On the next drive, Brady threw for 85 yards and hit Danny Amendola for an eight-yard touchdown. On the drive after that, Brady led the team on a 10-play, 68-yard drive that ended when he found All Pro tight end Rob Gronkowski somehow unguarded for a 15-yard touchdown pass. After the extra point, the Patriots led 30-20.\nThe game wasn’t quite over. Fitzpatrick got the ball back with 1:13 left and gained 43 yards in 55 seconds after passes to Marshall, Chris Owusu and Zac Stacy. Bowles opted to try a 55-yard field-goal attempt, which Nick Folk easily made. Folk then hit a perfect onside kick that Marshall recovered at midfield with 14 seconds left.\nThe Jets, out of timeouts, wanted to move the ball slightly downfield to make it easier for Fitzpatrick, who doesn’t have the strongest arm, to heave a desperation pass into the end zone. Fitzpatrick threw to Eric Decker in the center of the field for a 12-yard gain and rushed to spike the ball to stop the clock with one second left. The problem was that Marshall got confused and was lined up improperly. Officials penalized him with a 10-second clock runoff, which ended the game. “I should have done a better job of figuring that out faster,” Marshall said.\nThe Jets initially recovered after an ominous start on a dark afternoon that stayed dry after a morning rain. Fitzpatrick fumbled on the game’s second play as he scrambled, but the Jets defense held the Patriots to a field goal. But for the rest of the game, the defense had trouble containing Brady, who completed 34 of 54 pass attempts for 355 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions, and Gronkowski, who caught 11 passes for 108 yards.\n“We tried to switch things up on Tom and show him different looks, but Tom is great,” said Jets cornerback Darrelle Revis, in his first game against the Patriots since he left New England this past offseason. “He suckered in the defense.”\nWrite to Stu Woo at Stu.Woo@wsj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:57:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:05:16.762+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
