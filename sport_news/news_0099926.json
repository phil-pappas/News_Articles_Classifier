Press Conference video via 12thman.com\nPlay of the defensive ends...\nSumlin: Myles Garrett has done a little bit of everything the last few weeks. It has been tough on him. The last two weeks he's seen people chipping him, three guys blocking him, and that can be frustrating. Last week against Arkansas he caused a fumble, this week he created a fumble.\nDaeshon Hall made some big plays for negative yards. Those guys are creating some real negative yardage plays and turnovers. It's easy to get frustrated. Last year he got frustrated and he showed it. This year he has grown up mentally, he hangs in there and keeps going.\nState of team\nSumlin: For us right now, there are a lot of things we can improve on. To get to where we are right now playing the quality of opponents we have played, it is important. We will be able to get some people back, we lost Ricky Seals-Jones for part of the night. Speedy Noil, Jeremy Tabuyo, and Otaro Alaka didn't play. We have things we can improve.\nThe bye week is about getting our energy back, healing up physically but also mentally. That's the part that is underrated, the mental aspect. Take a deep breath, regroup, recruit a little bit, and try to get a bunch of those guys back. To win a game without those guys who have been major contributors is even better, tonight is a big win.\nHow team handled Ricky Seals-Jones ejection...\nSumlin: It was a great job by our offensive staff, Aaron Moorehead and Jake Spavital, because Ricky is a big part of what we are doing. We didn't have Speedy or Jeremy, we went from a regular rotation to having three guys out instead of one [after ejection]\nSubstitutions went great. We didn't miss a beat from a formation or operation standpoint. Those guys reacted well and the staff did a good job with the guys who came in.\nPlay of Kyle Allen...\nSumlin: he came out and has been playing well, picked up where he left off last week. I think he pressed a bit towards the end. He operated well, anytime you throw it 41 times and don't have a turnover, everyone who touched the ball did a nice job.\nI think we can play better and that will be our challenge going forward. If we can just get a little bit better every week we have a real chance.\nMore on Ricky Seals-Jones...\nSumlin: You heard me say last week, Ricky the last couple weeks has played very well. He's been physical, blocked like crazy, and done a great job. We got him involved early and got him in the end zone, it's just too bad that happened tonight. I've been really pleased with how he has approached playing without the football and I don't look for this to set him back at all.\nOn tweet from Seals-Jones during the game after his ejection...\nSumlin: I didn't know that. We will address that later.\nAtmosphere of Kyle Field...\nSumlin: It was great. Over 104 thousand. It was loud down there. How about those lights? That was cool. I just looked up and it was like stars up there, that was neat. It caught me off guard. Just when you think you can top the towel waving, it looked like a Star Wars deal. 104 thousand people being loud and you look around to start the fourth quarter... The whole place swaying, it's just a neat atmosphere. It's the best stadium in college football.\nTo view the entire press conference video, click here\nTexas A&M 30, Mississippi State 17: Complete coverage\nClick here to visit the Texas A&M Aggies page\nHairopoulos: Sumlin breaks through vs. Top-25 team at home; A&M has bye to prepare for Bama\nTexas A&M quotable: Sumlin impressed with play of defensive ends; 'will address' Seals-Jones tweets during game\nTexas A&M quick hits: Seals-Jones catches 1st TD pass of season, gets ejected for targeting\nFive thoughts: No. 14 Texas A&M improves to 5-0 despite slow second half offensively\nPhotos: Kyle Allen, ground game carry A&M past Mississippi State 30-17\nKate Hairopoulos answers Texas A&M/SEC questions at 3 p.m. Wednesday, Oct. 7; ask yours now\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-14-texas-improves-5-0-despite-slow-second-half-offensively-defeat-21-mississippi-state-30-17", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/04/texas-quotable-sumlin-impressed-play-defensive-ends-will-address-seals-jones-tweets-game", "https://youtu.be/-1sO8drA8rk?t=13", "https://youtu.be/-1sO8drA8rk?t=111", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1sO8drA8rk", "https://youtu.be/-1sO8drA8rk?t=406", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texas-aggies", "http://www.12thman.com/", "https://youtu.be/-1sO8drA8rk?t=221", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/hairopoulos-sumlin-breaks-vs-top-25-team-home-bye-prepare-bama", "https://youtu.be/-1sO8drA8rk?t=646", "https://youtu.be/-1sO8drA8rk?t=316", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/texas-quick-hits-seals-jones-catches-1st-td-pass-season-gets-ejected-targeting", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/chats/2015/09/30/kate-hairopoulos-answers-texas-amsec-questions-3-pm-wednesday-oct-7-ask-now"], "published": "2015-10-04T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:03:52.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
