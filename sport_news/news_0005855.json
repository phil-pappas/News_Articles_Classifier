Norm Wood Contact Reporter nwood@dailypress.com Injuries and roster adjustments have been significant storylines for #Hokies this season \nBLACKSBURG — Over the summer, there was a sense from the more optimistic faction of Virginia Tech fans that this season would bring a return to the nine- or 10-win Hokies of the not-too distant past. \nThose ambitions don't seem as likely at this stage, but injuries and unforeseen roster changes haven't done Tech (3-3, 1-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) any favors. With the most important half of Tech's season, and maybe of Coach Frank Beamer's career, still to come, here's a midseason report card for the Hokies: \nOFFENSE \nThough Michael Brewer's broken collarbone in the season-opening loss to No. 1 Ohio State did nothing for Tech's confidence, offensive coordinator Scot Loeffler has managed to get something out of backup quarterback Brenden Motley (completing 55.7 percent of his passes for 1,019 yards, 10 touchdowns and five interceptions; 194 rushing yards and three touchdowns). \nTech isn't making much of a ripple in the national total-offense rankings (378.5 yards per game; 88th of 127 Football Bowl Subdivision programs, ninth in the ACC), but Motley has done all that has been expected of him — and more. Proving he's more than just a running quarterback, he's held onto the ball for the most part and helped Tech do a decent job of sustaining drives (average time of possession 31 minutes, 8 seconds; 44th in nation). \nConsistency, especially on the offensive line, has been Tech's biggest problem. Tech's 100 yards, including 9 rushing yards, and seven sacks surrendered Oct. 10 in a 17-13 home loss to Pittsburgh represented the bottom of the barrel for the Hokies' offense. \nAfter five games of rotating Travon McMillian, Trey Edmunds and J.C. Coleman at tailback, along with contributions from Shai McKenzie before Tech decided to redshirt him and fullback Sam Rogers, McMillian finally became Tech's featured tailback in last Friday's 28-13 win against North Carolina State. \nMcMillian has a team-high 319 rushing yards, including 7.4 per carry. He will be expected to help improve a rushing offense (172 yards per game, eighth in the ACC) that has been up and down all season. \nMotley has had some capable targets, but not as many as Loeffler had hoped. Wide receiver Isaiah Ford, whose 28 catches have gone for ACC highs in receiving yards (421) and touchdowns (six), is one of the best in the conference. Cam Phillips (21 catches for 274 yards and a touchdown) is a good complementary receiver, and Rogers and tight ends Bucky Hodges (14 catches for 207 yards and two touchdowns) and Ryan Malleck have had their moments, especially with Hodges and Malleck working in the slot and spread wide, but Tech hasn't been able to develop any kind of depth at the receiver spots. \nTech has given up 15 sacks (2.5 per game, fourth-most in the ACC). Tech has stuck with the same starting five on its offensive line for all but one game (Kyle Chung started at left guard against N.C. State instead of regular starter Wyatt Teller), but freshman Yosuah Nijman has started to push left tackle Jonathan McLaughlin (who gave up three sacks against Pittsburgh) for more playing time. Brewer could return as soon as Saturday's game at Miami. \nGRADE: C+. \nDEFENSE \nAs devastating as Brewer's injury could've been for the offense, Tech's defense has had to endure even bigger adjustments in terms of injuries, absences and position changes. \nCornerback Kendall Fuller played in just three games before undergoing season-ending surgery for a torn meniscus in his knee he suffered in August. C.J. Reavis, a projected starter at strong safety, was dismissed from school before the start of preseason practices. \nMiddle linebacker Andrew Motuapuaka missed two games with a strained medial collateral ligament. Defensive end Dadi Nicolas, who had nine sacks last season, has struggled with a thumb injury on one hand and jammed fingers on his other hand. He doesn't have a sack yet this season. Defensive tackle Corey Marshall has been slowed by foot and hamstring problems. \nGreg Stroman, who started at nickel cornerback in three of the first four games, was moved full-time to receiver after the loss to Pittsburgh. \nDefensive coordinator Bud Foster, whose unit is giving up 341.2 yards per game (39th in the nation) has had to lean on true freshmen Adonis Alexander (tied for ACC lead with three interceptions) at safety and Mook Reynolds at nickel cornerback, and redshirt freshman Terrell Edmunds at cornerback. \nAlexander and Edmunds are now starters, along with veteran free safety Chuck Clark (tied for ACC lead with 51 tackles) and cornerback Brandon Facyson (tied for ACC lead with eight passes defended). That's a lot of in-season roster turnover. It's resulted in a unit that has been prone to giving up big plays (30 plays of 20-plus yards; more than all but 24 FBS teams, including nine teams from Power Five conferences) and uncharacteristic large gains on the ground (190.7 rushing yards per game, 96th in the nation). \nDespite the youth in the secondary, Tech is still giving up the 11th-fewest passing yards per game in the nation (150.5). Foster also has gotten solid play out of strong-side linebacker Deon Clarke, who paces the team with seven tackles for loss. \nMaybe most importantly, Tech is forcing teams to make mistakes. Tech is tied for the ACC lead with 13 takeaways. \nGRADE: B-. \nSPECIAL TEAMS \nOther than Tech getting its hands on a couple of kicks, including a blocked punt by Terrell Edmunds that was returned for a touchdown by Alexander in Tech's 51-24 win at Purdue, the Hokies have been relatively unspectacular on special teams. \nKicker Joey Slye has been solid on field-goal attempts of 40-to-49 yards (5 of 6), but he's just 6-of-10 overall on attempts. Punter A.J. Hughes has put 10 of his 32 punts inside the opponents' 20-yard line and is averaging 42.7 yards per punt (eighth in the ACC). \nDer'Woun Greene had an 82-yard kickoff return at Purdue, but he's struggled with injuries, and Tech's kickoff-return game behind Greene and Kevin Asante has been otherwise quiet. \nStroman hasn't always looked comfortable on his 12 punt returns (averaging just 2.8 yards), sometimes losing ground to try to gain ground and fielding a few punts inside the 10-yard line. Tech has done a nice job limiting big returns, holding opponents to 19.4 yards per kickoff return and 6 yards per punt return. \nGRADE: C+. \nCOACHING \nTech's coaching staff should get some leeway for having to deal with so many injuries and in-season adjustments, but there are issues that need addressing. \nTech is by far the most penalized team in the ACC, getting flagged 50 times for an average of 71.3 yards per game. There has to be concerns about pass protection. Some of the protection problem is likely the result of Motley, who didn't have much experience prior to being called into starting duty and may not have the best instinct of when to throw the ball away or use his ample running skills to avoid trouble, but Loeffler and offensive line coach Stacy Searels will have to continue to evaluate (especially at the tackle spots). \nWhen Brewer returns, he'll need all the help he can get to protect what will surely be a sensitive collarbone laden with a metal plate and six screws. Beamer isn't winning any new fans, and may not be generating much of a recruiting buzz, with a 3-3 mark, but the Hokies still find themselves in the thick of the Coastal Division race at 1-1. \nIf Tech finishes the regular season at 8-4 or better, which would put the Hokies in prime position to end up in the ACC championship game, he likely can silence a lot of critics. A record closer to .500 won't do much to stabilize Beamer's job status in his 29th season in Blacksburg. \nGRADE: C+.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T09:51:56.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
