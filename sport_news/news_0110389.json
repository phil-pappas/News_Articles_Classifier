And in stoppage time Lanzini's through ball sent Payet clear and the Frenchman deftly chipped Wayne Hennessey to seal West Ham's fourth away win of the season. \nThe Eagles played the entire second half at Selhurst Park with 10 men after Dwight Gayle was sent off for two yellows — a needless lunge on Payet, and a rash challenge on Cheikhou Kouyate. \nCarl Jenkinson had put the visitors ahead in the 22nd with his second goal in two matches, but Yohan Cabaye equalized moments later with a twice-taken penalty after Gayle had encroached into the area. \nWest Ham provisionally moved third with 17 points from nine games. Palace dropped two spots to sixth with 15 points. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T19:38:36.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
