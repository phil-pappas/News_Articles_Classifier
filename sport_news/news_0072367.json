Scotties pull out a 21-12 win over the Raiders By Adam Brewer, for the Greene County Messenger Herald-Standard | 0 comments \nWAYNESBURG -- Nursing a 14-12 lead with 4:59 left in regulation, Southmoreland’s Jaden Datz broke away for a 55-yard touchdown that stole back the momentum, as the Scotties pulled out a 21-12 triumph over Waynesburg Central Friday night. \nThe Scotties (3-4, 3-3) snapped their three-game losing streak, pulling to .500 in the Interstate Conference and keeping their playoff hopes alive for another week. \n“We were able to put it all back together again,” Southmoreland coach Mark Adams said. “The last three weeks we have turned the ball over and been sloppy on both sides of the ball. Tonight we held onto the ball and we made the big plays in the fourth quarter.” \nThe loss officially eliminated the Raiders (1-6, 1-5) from the postseason after losing four of the last six meetings to their Westmoreland County rival. The last three games in the series have been decided by a combined 15 points. \nAfter a scoreless third quarter, Waynesburg marched down the field and cut the deficit to 14-12 after an electrifying 62-yard touchdown run down the sideline by quarterback Colin McCracken. \nThe Waynesburg sideline was called for excessive celebration on the scoring dash and the 5-yard penalty was added to the ensuing two-point try. \nThe Raiders completed the pass, but the receiver was stopped two yards short of the end zone. \n“We had an unnecessary celebration penalty and that moved us back five yards on the two-point try,” Waynesburg Central coach Russ Moore said. “We practiced a lot of two-point passes this week, but those five yards were critical. We didn’t get the pass to the goal line and then Southmoreland bounces right back with a long touchdown run.” \nAfter a failed onside attempt by the home team, the Scotties extended their lead to nine with an inside misdirection run by Datz 13 seconds later. \n“We caught them in a trap on the long run and it’s a play we like to run a lot,” Adams said. “That’s the play of the game and Jaden did a great job of breaking that run. I thought all three of our backs were outstanding tonight.” \nDatz ended his night with 145 rushing yards on 19 attempts with 104 yards coming in the second half. \nBoth teams traded punts and turnovers on downs on their next couple of drives, and the Scotties sealed the victory with an interception by Rossel Ritenour with 12 seconds left. \nAfter both teams failed to score on their opening drives, the visitors took a 7-0 lead at the 1:27 mark of the first quarter with a 34-yard scoring toss to Mike Moresea from Jonathon Leighty. \nMidway through the second period, Southmoreland doubled its lead to 14-0 after Leighty connected with Moresea on a 17-yard slant. \n“Jonathon did exactly what we asked him to do,” Adams said. “He got the ball out of his hands quickly and made smart decisions. He has a cannon for an arm and he can read a defense. He is a first-year quarterback and it’s all about keeping his confidence up.” \nThe Raiders countered the two-touchdown deficit with a scoring drive of their own, when McCracken found Cole Garrett in the back of the end zone for a 15-yard touchdown pass on fourth-and-8. The touchdown pass capped an 11-play, 71 yard drive. \nWaynesburg trailed 14-6 at halftime, as the teams traded fumbles and empty drives in the third quarter. \n“Waynesburg has some hard-nosed kids and we knew it was going to be a fight,” Adams said. “The last three years it has been a battle from start to finish. We wanted to stop their running game and make them one-dimensional.” \nLeighty finished the game with 117 yards on 8-of-17 passing, while Moresea hauled in six receptions for 97 yards. Andrew Polakovsky also added 78 rushing yards on 13 carries for the Scotties. \nMcCracken had a stellar night, both on the ground and through the air. The junior signal caller rushed for 111 yards and threw for 107 yards on 8-of-22 passing. \nJack Fudala rush 56 yards on the ground on 11 rushes, while Zach Eisiminger collected 50 yards on 11 carries for the Raiders. \n“It’s frustrating because we have lost a lot of close games, but these kids don’t quit,” Moore said. “They haven’t quit on me. Our offense has been turning the corner the last three weeks. We are a running team and I thought we had some success against their tough defensive line.” \nBoth teams will be hosting conference games next week, as Southmoreland welcomes in Washington and Waynesburg entertains McGuffey.
