Utah State’s defense set up sophomore Kent Myers with short fields, and he capitalized on them. Utah State scored 35 of its 52 points off of turnovers.\nFor Boise State, it did not help that its No. 1 running back Jeremy McNichols was injured. His presence was deeply missed as the Broncos could not get their usual rushing yards. Penalties were the only things slowing down the Aggies. The Aggies, however, did not let those keep them off the board.\nThe upset brings the Aggies’ home winning streak to 12, which ranks as the fourth-longest home winning streak in school history.\nThis is the report card for the Utah State Aggies game versus No. 21 Boise State.\nQuarterback \nWith starting quarterback Chuckie Keeton out with a knee injury, Myers, who began the season as the back-up, made his third start in three games this season. Having beat Colorado State on homecoming weekend and then another win over Fresno State last week, the Aggies felt confident in their back-up quarterback to get the job done.\nAnd what a job he did. With help from his defense, Myers threw for three touchdowns and ran for one more. Against Colorado State two weeks ago, his legs got the job done. Last week against Fresno State, it was his arm.\nThe reports said he needed to use both against Boise State if the Aggies even stood a chance at beating the Broncos, and he listened. He was 17 for 24 for 157 yards, and he had 14 carries for 63 yards and a touchdown.\nIn three games, Myers has exceeded expectations. He had a very good game with both rushing and passing like he was supposed to.\nIn the fourth quarter, third-string quarterback Damion Hobbs came in for a few plays to give Myers a breather. Fans saw that the junior is a decent second-stringer behind Myers, who, at this point, will most likely be the starter for the rest of the season if Keeton doesn't return.\nMyers has had three terrific games, and he deserves a terrific grade.\nGrade: A \nRunning backs \nDevante Mays, LaJuan Hunt and Hunter Sharp were an effective committee. They combined for 93 yards and two touchdowns on the ground.\nMays had the best night of the three though. With 11 carries for 63 yards and a touchdown he was Utah State's go-to guy when it came to rushing the ball. In the first half, he had a breakout run of 48 yards that gave Utah State the spark it needed to keep its foot on the gas.\nWith the other two backs contributing good runs and being able to give Mays breaks throughout the game, they all put on a solid performance against a tough defense.\nGrade: A- \nWide receivers \nFor what Hunt and Sharp did not do rushing they made up for in receiving. The two combined for nine receptions for 93 yards and two touchdowns. Individually, Sharp stood out though. He had a team-high seven receptions for 42 yards and had two touchdowns.\nThe rushing game is somewhat weak for these two players, but they are excellent in receiving. When Utah State had long third downs, the Aggies turned to their receivers for help, and they delivered. Yards after catch was a contributing factor for their success. Myers seemed to be going with screen options for most of the game, and they were working.\nThese receivers played well when the Aggies were driving up the field, but they were outstanding when it came to the red zone. Overall, the receivers did a good job, not a terrific one, but a very strong performance.\nGrade: A- \nOffensive line \nOn Friday, the offensive line shined bright under the lights. The line only gave two sacks on the night and many times gave Myers plenty of time in the pocket.\nAlso, the offensive line did a great job of creating huge holes for Mays, Myers and the other running backs for Utah State. Penalties will come to haunt them later in the season, however. They need to crack down on the simple mistakes if they want to continue to play this well.\nGrade: B+ \nFront seven \nWhat a night for the defense of Utah State. It caused eight Boise State turnovers. The defense created five fumbles, thanks to the defensive line pushing back Boise State’s offensive line and getting in quarterback Brett Rypien’s face, causing him to make mistakes.\nIt was a great night for the Aggies’ defense, and it deserves most of the credit for the crowd getting into the game, the offense having short fields and Boise State not being able to find a rhythm throughout the game.\nGrade: A \nSecondary \nContributing to the defense’s five fumbles, the Aggies’ secondary had three interceptions, one returned for a touchdown. The deciding factor of this game was the defense, but the focus is going to be on two main players: linebacker Kyler Fackrell and linebacker Nick Vigil. These two were in the Boise State backfield the entire night and never looked back. Early in the game they pinned their ears back and went after Rypien.\nThe defense only gave up 26 points and 333 total yards to the No. 21-ranked team in the nation and that deserves credit.\nGrade: A \nSpecial teams \nThere is not much to be said about special teams because they were not used very often. When they were used, they did their job well.\nOn punts, Aaron Dalton had two punts inside the 20 and his average on the night was 40.3 yards. A decent night for the punter as he only kicked it seven times with a long of 51. Utah State made its only field goal of the night, with it being a 51-yard attempt from Jake Thompson.\nOverall, it was a normal night for the special teams. Nothing special, but also nothing dull.\nGrade: A- \nCoaching \nUtah State head coach Matt Wells, offensive coordinator Josh Heupel and defensive coordinator Kevin Clune had a great game. The decisions they made were precise and thought out.\nWells will be credited with the win, but really it was what Clune did on defense that won the Aggies the game. His defense was tough the entire game, only slowing down for a second in the fourth quarter as they let Boise State climb back into the game with two touchdowns. What they did in the first half was really all that needs to be talked about. The calls of all three coaches helped win the game and without them the game could have been a lot different.\nGrade: A \nOverall \nIt was a huge victory for Utah State secured by an outstanding performance from the defense. This victory not only puts the Aggies ahead of Boise State in the Mountain West Conference, but it also increases their home winning streak to 12. It was a huge night for the entire team with very few errors on both sides of the ball.\nGrade: A \nLogan Dzatko is a freshman journalism and communications major attending Utah State University.
