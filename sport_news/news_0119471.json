The Blue Jays were coming off a series loss in Minnesota and got rained out at Nationals Stadium on June 1. Jordan Zimmermann pitched a gem in the first game, beating R.A. Dickey 2-0 to leave Toronto with a record of 23-30, their lowest point of the season. Washington's starting pitcher in the second game was Max Scherzer, coming off five wins in a row and with a season ERA of 1.51. \nKevin Pillar hit two home runs off Scherzer and the Jays won 7-3 to start an 11-game win streak. \n\"We were on the ropes, seven games under .500 at the time, against a guy who has thrown two no-hitters this year and Pillar took him deep twice,\" Gibbons said. \"That started the win streak. We climbed back over .500. That's the one that jumps out at me. We really could have disappeared but we regrouped against maybe the top pitcher in the game, after getting beat by Zimmermann.\" \nNO GOLD WATCH, YET \nSocial media blew up on Saturday night and Sunday morning regarding a report out of Chicago that Mark Buehrle was going to pitch his two innings on Sunday, then ride off into the sunset. \n\"I guess I'm retired,\" said Buehrle, sarcasm dripping from every syllable. \n\"I was told I was retiring. I got about 400 text messages today from friends who are 'Sad to see you go, to be retiring.' And I'm like, 'What's going on here?' Apparently I'm done, and what a way to go out.\" \nThis was after he was lifted after getting only two outs and allowing eight runs (none earned) in the process. He's still uncertain if he'll retire or not. \n'STAY FOCUSED, HAVE FUN' \nThis is Josh Donaldson's fourth season in the big leagues and he has been in the playoffs every year. His advice to his less-experienced teammates? \n\"We need to continue to do the things we've been doing all year,\" he said. \"Enjoy the moment but also focus on the things that we've focused on to get here. We feel like we're a very good ball club and we're ready to go after a new experience. \n\"It was a good year but this is the time of the year where it really matters and I'm looking forward to that the most.\" \n'DESERVED THE CHANCE' \nJose Bautista doesn't want to hear any criticism of the decision to give Buehrle the start Sunday to try to get his 15th consecutive season of 200 innings. \n\"He's one of the best pitchers in baseball because of all he's done for such a long time,\" Bautista said. \"That's just one of his accolades, having so many years of 200 innings pitched. Obviously it's unfortunate he didn't get it done, but he deserved a shot. \n\"I really don't want to get on social media or start reading articles about how that wasn't the right move. I don't even want to hear it. So I'm going to be the one to step ahead of all of that and say that that man deserved that shot that he got today to get 200 innings. \n\"It's just unfortunate he didn't get it done, unfortunately we didn't get the win and we didn't get the home-field advantage. But it is what it is. \n\"We're still a great team, division winners and we're just going to do what we need to do now to get going for the playoffs. \n\"It was an outstanding season by every single person in here.\" \n-- Ken Fidlin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T05:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:36:09.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
