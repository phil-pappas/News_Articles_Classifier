I think we will be smart with that. . . Of course I want to stay. My goal is to work hard for the team and be with the team when the season starts, and now it's close. So let's see after this day.\"\nRantanen is one of six Avalanche players living in a hotel, along with Skille, Reto Berra, Rendulic, Everberg and Brandon Gormley. The young Finn had one goal and no assists in five exhibition games for the Avalanche.\n\"That last game against L.A., they had a solid lineup, the best lineup you could have, so when you see you can battle with those guys and with the best D-men in the world, of course it gives you confidence,\" he said. \"But you have to play well to play in this league.\"\nRantanen has signed a three-year entry level contract that will kick in if he plays in 10 regular-season NHL games. So it's possible, even probable, that he essentially will be playing the start of the season under what amounts to a trial and then the Avalanche will make a decision on what would be best for his development â€” staying with Colorado, going down to San Antonio of the American Hockey League or returning to play another season in the Finnish professional league with TPS Turku.\n\"I'm a young guy and I have never played in the NHL yet,\" Rantanen said. \"The first nine games, the biggest thing is to get the team to win and I want to help with that and play well.\"\nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @TFrei", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:21:31.944+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
