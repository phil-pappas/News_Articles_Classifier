By Jeff Deters jeff.deters@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The rise of the Kansas City Royals began in the standings in 2013, the same season the likes of James Shields and Wade Davis arrived to help get the Royals over the hump and maximize their window of opportunity. \nShields served as the team’s ace for two years before departing as a free agent, and Davis has gone from mediocre starter to dynamite setup man and closer. The maturation of Mike Moustakas, Salvador Perez and Eric Hosmer also was big, but perhaps no Royal has changed more than manager Ned Yost. \nYost, to his core, is really about as old-school manager as they get, having spent 12 years on Bob Cox’s staff in Atlanta. But Yost has adapted to the Royals’ changing and winning culture since he took over in May 2010. \n“When I took over this team, I’d spent all spring training basically evaluating or watching a major league team,” Yost said. “But I spent more time in the minor leagues watching Mike Moustakas, Eric Hosmer, Salvador Perez, these types of guys, (Kelvin) Herrera, who were all in A-ball at that time. “And by the time they got to the big leagues, I think they still kind of had some old-school ways, because I grew up under Bobby Cox. And Bobby was a guy that really wanted no emotion in the game. He didn’t like celebrations. He didn’t like music. He wouldn’t even let them wear Oakley sunglasses back in those days.” \nYost followed in Cox’s footsteps early in his tenure before coming to the realization that if the Royals were going to be successful he had to change himself. \n“I think it finally got to a point in these kids’ second year where I realized these guys are different, they’re from a different generation than I grew up,” Yost said. “It doesn’t mean that it’s right or it’s wrong, but it’s who they are. And I think in order to have success, you have to allow them to be who they are.” \nThat’s not to say the Royals didn’t go through some growing pains along the way to back-to-back postseason appearances because they did. Hosmer and Moustakas struggled greatly early in their careers, and Alcides Escobar often was overmatched at the plate. \nBut ultimately Yost let his team play music, including Latin, in the clubhouse before and after games. He also let celebrations occur when deemed worthy, and he made the decision not to spend as much time in the clubhouse, instead choosing to let the players police themselves. \nThe young players understand what Yost was trying to accomplish, and they are thankful for it now. \n“He’s been a good manager,” Escobar said. “He’s very positive. He supports you as a player. We always play hard and play with energy. He has a lot to do with that.” \nIn 2010, the Royals went 67-95. This year they went 95-67 and claimed their first division title in 30 years and the first AL Central title in team history. \nAlong the way, Yost even learned to trust his coaches more, a lesson he learned from his tenure as manager of the Brewers. Together, Yost’s formula of old-school ways and modern-day modifications have made the last two seasons his most enjoyable as a manager. \n“The last two years has been probably the most fun that I’ve had managing,” Yost said. “I’ve got a coaching staff that I just love being around. We can communicate very effectively. They’ll, at times, step up and give me their opinion when my opinion is different, which I love that about them.” \nROYALS HONOR FALLEN FIREFIGHTERS — Prior to Game 5, the Royals honored the two Kansas City firefighters who lost their lives in the line of duty. \nLarry J. Leggio, 43, and John V. Mesh, 39, were killed battling a blaze that engulfed an apartment complex Monday. Members of the Kansas City Fire Department took the field during a moment of silence before the game. \nRoyals Charities will donate net proceeds from the 50/50 Raffle during Wednesday’s game to the Surviving Spouse and Family Endowment Fund (SAFE), administered by the Kansas City Metropolitan Crime Commission, as well as IAFF Local 42. \nFor a time, the Royals were possibly going to wear specially designed KCFD Royals hats during batting practice but MLB rules prohibit the wearing of altered uniforms on the field on game day. \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:41:55.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
