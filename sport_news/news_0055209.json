Private consumption may also receive a fillip from the imminent civil service pay revisions and is expected to grow by 8 per cent by 2017/18.\nOn the production front, the acceleration would be supported by construction activity at first, with manufacturing gradually picking up pace, the report said.\nAt the same time, the bank said India’s projected growth outlook is subject to substantive downside risks.\nThe most immediate is related to corporate and financial sector balance sheets, and in the longer-term the implementation of the Government’s reform program – e.g. GST, land acquisition, and improvements in the business climate, some of which have been delayed, it said.\nUnblocking the pipeline of infrastructure projects, ensuring sustainable means of financing and unlocking private investment are necessary to realise the meaningful and sustainable increase in investments embodied in the baseline scenario, the bank said.\nOn the external front, major risks stem from weak growth of India’s key sources of trade, investment and remittance flows; increased volatility in financial flows; and higher global food prices due the severe El Nino expected this year, it said.\nDevelopment outcomes are increasingly tied to states’ priorities and capacities. Following the recommendation of the 14 th finance commission, state governments have been awarded greater fiscal resources and spending autonomy.\nWhile the increased devolution of unconditional resources is a positive development, efficient utilization of these resources may vary across states.\n“A simultaneous scaling down of centrally sponsored social sector schemes presents risks for development outcomes, unless compensated for by the states,” it warned.\nAccording to the bank, India features a stable external position and a relatively low volatility of equity and debt flows. These characteristics stand as exceptional among large emerging markets, it added.\nWhile many of the South Asian nations had improved their external position after the 2013 taper tantrum, they saw it deteriorating again in 2015. But India’s current account deficit and nominal exchange rate were barely impacted, it said.\nIndia’s real GDP growth is set to exceed 7 per cent for CY-2015.\nTail winds from lower oil prices contribute to this strong performance, given that the country is a net oil importer, it said, adding that the limited vulnerability to the international turmoil will continue to support India’s economy in the short term.\nAnnual growth is set to increase from 7.3 per cent in FY 2014-15 to 7.5 per cent in FY 2015-16.\nWhile private consumption appears as an important factor throughout, gross fixed investment is increasingly playing a more prominent role, the report added. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:37:40.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
