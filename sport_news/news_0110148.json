Caviness sent a swing pass to Nixon, who picked up two blocks and then ran 84 yards down the sideline for a touchdown in Liverpool's 29-12 victory over the Northstars in a Class AA Section III playoff game on Friday. \nYou can watch the play in the above video. \nThe touchdown came in the second quarter right after Cicero-North Syracuse had been stopped on fourth-and-goal when Joe Scro intercepted a pass at the goal line. \n>> Class AA Section III tournament bracket \nWith Nixon's score - and a surprise two-point conversion out of a fake - the Warriors moved out to a 15-0 lead. \n\"Me and Jordan, we knew we had to connect, to get another touchdown and get the team going,\" Nixon said. \"It was a designed for me so he just put it out there. We got two great blocks and the rest was ... \n\"When I saw I had the two blocks, everything else was wide open. Great blocks.\" \n\"We kind of game-planned the whole week to get our athletes the ball and let them be athletes in space,\" Caviness said. \"That's what we tried to do with Daryl - get him the ball quick, get him disguised but get him the ball so he could go make plays. That's what happened.\" \nThe two would connect for another touchdown play of 16 yards on a screen pass in the second half. \nLiverpool (7-1) moves on to play Baldwinsville (6-2) on Friday in a sectional semifinal game at Cicero-North Syracuse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:12:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:23:06.825+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
