By Seattle Times staff The Associated Press \nPASADENA, Calif. — With UCLA’s season seemingly teetering on the brink of collapse, Josh Rosen calmly propped it back up with a passing performance that put the freshman’s name in the Bruins’ record book. \nRosen completed a school-record 34 passes and threw two of his three touchdown passes to Devin Fuller, and UCLA got back on track with a 40-24 victory over No. 20 California on Thursday night. \nRosen passed for 399 yards in another splendid game for the standout rookie, and Thomas Duarte had career highs of 10 catches for 141 yards for the Bruins (5-2, 2-2 Pac-12). UCLA rebounded from consecutive losses to Arizona State and Stanford, along with a drop from the national rankings, with a 573-yard offensive performance and a stellar effort by its patchwork defense, which sacked Cal star Jared Goff five times. \n“Every time you win, it’s a step forward,” said Rosen, who broke the completions record set by Richard Brehaut and Brett Hundley. “Especially with our bye week, that was three weeks without a win, so it felt great to come out here and put it to them.” Most Read Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:02:32.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
