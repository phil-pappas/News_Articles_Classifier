The last was a three-run shot by Howie Kendrick in the ninth inning for the Los Angeles Dodgers in their NL Division Series game against the New York Mets.\nCorrea hit two of Houston's four homers against Kansas City, and the Chicago Cubs hit a postseason-record six home runs in their victory over St. Louis.\nCubs rookie Kris Bryant, who hit a two-run shot off Michael Wacha, found it hard to count all the home runs in that game.\n\"Everybody is smiling, obviously,\" Bryant said. \"It's fun when you hit, what was it, I think it was six home runs or something.\"\nThree of Toronto's first eight batters homered in an ALDS win at Texas, and Cespedes highlighted New York's 13-7 win over the Dodgers by crushing a three-run shot.\n\"It's really cool to see,\" said the Mets' Travis d'Arnaud, who hit a two-run homer. \"It's good for the fan base.\"\nWhile this is an era of pitching and defense, Mets manager Terry Collins is a fan of the long ball.\n\"When we hit home runs, we think we got a big chance to win,\" he said. \"It's all about trying to get on base, and then have somebody up there that can hit something into the seats.\"\nThe 61 runs scored Monday also set a postseason record.\nThe previous postseason record for home runs was 15 on Oct. 3, 1995, according to STATS. Like Monday, there were four postseason games on that day 20 years ago.\nThe record for runs was 48 on Oct. 5, 2002.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
