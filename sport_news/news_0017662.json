Miami-Dade unemployment rate ticks down in September \nUnemployment rate falls to 5.8 percent in Miami-Dade County \nThat’s towest rate since 2008 In this photo taken Wednesday, July 15, 2015, job seekers listen as Kaysara Mandry, center, talks about job opportunities at the Domino's booth during a job fair in Miami Lakes. Alan Diaz AP i Order Reprint of this Story \nThe seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in Miami-Dade County dipped slightly to 5.8 percent in September, according to a state report released Friday. \nThat’s the lowest local jobless rate since 2008, although the numbers are preliminary and won’t be finalized until next month. The county’s unemployment rate stood at 5.9 percent in August and 6.5 percent in September 2014, according to the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity. \nAll signs were positive in this month’s numbers: The labor force grew while the number of people looking for work who can’t find it — the official definition of unemployment — was down. (The unemployment rate does not count people who have given up on the job hunt.) \nSouth Florida’s economy has been steadily recovering since 2012, mainly thanks to a resurgence in the construction and tourism industries. \n5.9 percent Unemployment rate in Miami-Dade for September \nThe unemployment rate in Broward County also fell, dropping to 4.9 percent in September. That’s down from 5.2 percent in August and 5.8 percent in September 2014. Unlike Miami-Dade, Broward’s numbers are not adjusted to account for seasonal changes in the workforces, meaning they’re less reliable as a month-to-month economic indicator. \nFor the second straight month, Broward also created the third-most jobs in the state, adding 22,800 jobs year-over-year. \nThe statewide picture improved as well. Florida’s unemployment rate stood at 5.2 percent in September, down from a revised figure of 5.4 percent in August. (The state last month reported August’s rate at 5.3 percent.) Meanwhile, the national unemployment rate held steady at 5.1 percent.
