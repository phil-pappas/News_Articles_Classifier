I can honestly say that. \n“People will want to put pressure on for different reasons. I don't feel it, I don't want it, but anything externally, there is no drama.” \nRodgers's position came under scrutiny at the end of last season, after Liverpool were humiliated 6-1 at Stoke City on the final day in Gerrard's last game before joining the Los Angeles Galaxy. \nFSG came out in support of the Northern Irishman, who formerly worked alongside Jose Mourinho at Chelsea, but obliged him to make changes to his back-room staff. \nAssistant manager Colin Pascoe and first-team coach Mike Marsh both left the club, with Sean O'Driscoll and former Liverpool midfielder Gary McAllister joining the back-room staff. \nRodgers spent around £80 million during the close season, much of it recouped from the sale of Sterling to City for £49 million, but Liverpool have struggled. \nThey have won only one of their last nine games inside 90 minutes and needed penalties to beat fourth-tier Carlisle United in the League Cup. \n“He was maybe fortunate to stay on at the end of last season,” said former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher, who played under Rodgers. \n“He'll have known himself that he had to make a good start and he hasn't.” \nArsenal manager Arsene Wenger backed Rodgers to bounce back from the setback. \n“I am always sad when that happens because I think he is a quality manager,” said the Frenchman after his side's 3-0 defeat of Manchester United. \n“But that's the way it goes now and I wish him good luck. I am sure he will find a job again.” \nRodgers is the second Premier League manager to part company with a club this season after Dick Advocaat, who stood down at Sunderland earlier yesterday. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:20:27.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
