It’s 3:30 in the office at any media agency; that time of day when the consumption of chocolate increases dramatically, as do vacant stares, and the number of screens showing obscure Buzzfeed quizzes. Here's why the Rugby World Cup 2015 man of the match Twitter voting system doesn’t work Rugby fans have been left bemused by some of the man of the match awards at this year's Rugby World Cup. In this guest post David Hickey explains why the #MOTM hashtag voting is throwing up these results. As a global provider of social media intelligence, I was stoked that the man of the match system for Rugby World Cup 2015 has a social media element to it. How Facebook Reactions will change social media In this guest post Con Frantzeskos looks at what Facebook's new 'reactions' emoticons will change brands' experience of social media. Facebook has confirmed it’s now testing a new Reactions feature in Ireland and Spain which may be soon rolled out worldwide. Essentially the Reactions feature is similar to the traditional ‘Like’ button but it provides users with a spectrum of emotional responses. The new addition will allow users to Like, Love, Haha, Yay, Wow, Sad or Angry a post. The sustainable development goals - why marketing and business need to be across them Ahead of November's UN climate conference in Paris, Andrew Woodward argues the marketing, advertising, communications and corporate affairs industries need to be more across the sustainable development goals and what they will mean for business globally. Over the last few years, the United Nations (UN), governments globally an increasing number of big businesses have been looking at the future of the planet and its inhabitants. They have been asking a few basic questions, like “How’s it going?” and “How’s it looking?”. With great power comes great responsibility: Why we've updated the ADMA Code of Practice Today ADMA is releasing a new Code of Practice for its members . Here CEO Jodie Sangster explains why. In 2006 John Howard was Prime Minister. The iPhone was a year away from its consumer release, Twitter had just launched and the NBN was merely an opposition policy platform. It was also the year that ADMA (then The Australian Direct Marketing Association) last updated its Code of Practice. To win on social media you need fauxthenticity In this guest post Parnell Palme McGuinness argues Westpac and Airbnb fell foul of social media by trying to be too human and forgetting they are brands. People demand authenticity on social media. I can confidently say this, because I have heard it said ad nauseam by the gurus and high priests of social. The only problem is, it’s not true. Three ways journalists annoy PR professionals In this response to a Fairfax Media article about three things that annoy journalists David Satterthwaite bemoans the annoying behaviours of journalists in their interactions with PR professionals. Your computer *pings*. It’s an email from a journalist you contacted days before and you open it eagerly, hoping they’ve read the information you sent and want to write an awesome story about it. What can we do about community manager burnout? In the run up to World Mental Health Day Julie Delaforce argues businesses need to give more backup to community managers or risk burnout. Do you know what happens when you’re in the middle of giving birth and your midwife’s shift finishes? She goes home. The same is true for almost any professional whose work operates 24/7. Yet in the world of community and social media management managers lament that they are “always on”, “the job never ends”, and “the Internet doesn’t sleep”. 'Does Social Media advertising work?' makes very little sense as a question. Now it’s been answered In this guest post Simon Veksner argues social media has well and truly proven itself as an advertising channel. Not long ago, it was quite common for marketers to question whether social media advertising “works”. It’s actually a bit of a strange question, if you think about it. Fighting a new wave of ad-fraud: how to recognise ghost sites? So-called ghost sites are part of a new wave of fraudulent websites argues Timothy Whitfield . How do marketers and agencies spot and avoid them? If I needed money for a new kidney then I would get into ad-fraud! It’s lucrative, easy and completely legal. Creating an ‘Innovation Economy’ will be an evolution, not a revolution In this guest post Sam Court argues Australia's bid to become an innovation hub will need a mindshift from everyone about what innovation really is. If Australia truly wants to become a global hub for innovation, we need to not only look at funding mechanisms for high-risk start-ups, but also at giving better incentives for established brands to make calculated investments. No wonder Big Coal say they're losing the PR battle In this guest post Tony Jaques argues the mining industry doesn't need to fight a losing PR battle but rather needs a targeted issue management strategy. The Australian coal boss of the world's largest mining company has warned that the industry is losing the PR battle against environmental activists who are trying to shut down fossil fuels. Who won the social media battle between AFL and NRL? With the AFL and NRL grand finals taking place over the weekend Claire Waddington looks at which code won the battle for social media attention. Like many great rivalries – Coke or Pepsi, Uber or taxis, Netflix or Stan – shifts in popular opinion muddy the debate, but according to media intelligence agency, Isentia, there was a clear winner in the longstanding AFL or NRL tug-of-war over the weekend. It's time for agencies to cut the shit and embrace the hybrid Agencies need to start embracing people with across-the-board experience in advertising rather than siloed specialists to become sustainable argues Andrew Cornale . Coming from a diverse digital background, I've been in a number of different agencies (creative, advertising and marketing) and have seen how they operate. Some experiences were good, some not so good but one thing that I picked up is that the industry is filled with so much bullshit, it's unbelievable. Three steps to growing your agency without destroying its soul In this guest post Ryan Bonnici outlines three steps most agencies can take towards sustainable growth. Most owners of growing agencies are pretty focused on generating as much new business as their agency can handle. With a growing whip-smart team and the promise of a long-awaited payday, shiny new client opportunities are the things that dreams are made of. But have you ever had a massive client opportunity come your way that didn’t quite feel right? Are you Yahoo Serious? \nToday News.com.au asks the big question of the day – Whatever happened to Young Einstein star Yahoo Serious? \nIndeed the author of the piece, Matthew Murphy, writes it was a question asked of an Australian friend of his living in New York while on a date: “‘That is a question no Australian has asked in 20 years,’ my friend informed her date.” \nBut that’s untrue. Indeed Dr Mumbo and a colleague were discussing the same question just this week. And when you actually perform a Google search for old Yahoo what comes up is his IMDB profile, a couple of Young Einstein links, and several articles asking ‘Where is Yahoo Serious now?’.And then Wil Anderson jumped in on Twitter to remind everyone he actually recorded a whole podcast with Rove McManus two years ago on the very same topic: \nWhile the News.com.au article manages to do a decent job of reproducing his IMDB and Wikipedia page, it never actually gets close to answering the question.
