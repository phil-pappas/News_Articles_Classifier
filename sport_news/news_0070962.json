It was a very brief phone conversation, probably less than five minutes. \n\"He put the phone down, hung up and said it was Cairnsy and he 'just made me a business proposition'.\" \nDressed in a dark grey suit, white shirt and deep blue tie, he added: \"I didn't ask any more questions. \n\"We stayed together for a short time. I didn't ask any more questions ... As soon as I heard it was about business, I wasn't interested any more.\" \nGiving evidence last week Mr McCullum, 34, claimed the proposition was about match fixing, and that Cairns told him other players \"did not have the balls to do it\". \nHe added that Cairns, who was considered one of the best all-rounders in the world for much of his career, shifted the discussion to the topic of \"spot fixing\" while they were in a hotel room in Calcutta in April 2008. \nMr McCullum, a wicketkeeper-batsman, said he was \"shocked\" by the query, in which Cairns allegedly sketched out his suggestions on a piece of paper. \nMr McCullum claimed the meeting took place in Cairns's hotel room. It had been arranged when Mr McCullum was in a bar with Mr Ponting, and Mr McCullum got a taxi to the hotel, he said. \nOver a bottle of red wine and a curry ordered on room service, Cairns asked Mr McCullum if he knew \"anything about spot fixing in cricket\", Mr McCullum claimed. \nIn 2010 Cairns was accused by the chairman of the Indian Premier League, Lalit Modi, on Twitter of match-fixing at the Chandigarh Lions in the Indian Cricket League (ICL) two years earlier. \nHe brought a libel action against Mr Modi and successfully sued him, winning Â£90,000 in damages. \nCairns, 45, from Auckland, is charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice, while Andrew Fitch-Holland, from Burton Road, Manchester, is accused of perverting the course of justice. \nThey both deny the charges. \nThe court heard that Mr McCullum had previously described Mr Ponting as his \"best friend in cricket, outside New Zealand\". \nOrlando Pownall, defending Cairns, asked Mr Pointing if, as far as he was concerned, the \"business proposition\" made by Cairns to Mr McCullum had been \"unremarkable\". \nThe batsman replied: \"Yes, because I had no idea what the proposal or proposition was, so it wasn't a remarkable thing.\" \nHe added that he had not been aware that Mr McCullum later met with Cairns, and that they had never spoken of the phone call again. \nWhen Mr Pownall suggested this was \"somewhat unusual\" given the amount of time they had spent together at the tournament, Mr Ponting responded: \"It was none of my business. Brendon's business life and personal life was none of my business. \n\"I was never going to ask him about business propositions.\" \nMr Pownall further asked: \"Had Mr Cairns or anybody else approached you to fix matches, you would have gone straight to he authorities, wouldn't you?\" \"Yes,\" said Mr Ponting, adding that he would have reported any approach without undue delay. \nMr Pownall also asked Mr Ponting if his interest in horse racing had earned him the nickname \"punter\". \nHe agreed, telling the jury that he also understood what was meant by the terms \"spread-betting\" and \"spot fixing\". \nMr Ponting was asked if he would also have expected Mr McCullum to understand what the terms meant. He replied: \"Right now I would, in 2008, maybe not as much.\" \nHowever, the cricketer told jurors that it was likely match-fixing would have been a \"feature of the game\" in 2008.
