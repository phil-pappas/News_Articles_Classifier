More importantly, the win sets up the much-anticipated showdown with No. 1 Northern Valley/Old Tappan (5-0) on Friday night in Hillsdale. \n“It will be a big one,” promised Pascack Valley senior wide receiver Mike Pimpinella. \nAnd it will also be crammed with enough juicy subplots to surely give the game a playoff feel. \nBecause the Indians dropped down to North 1, Group 3 this season, it will be the only meeting of the season between two of North Jersey’s serious sectional title contenders. Pascack Valley beat the Golden Knights twice last season, giving the Indians nine wins in 14 games against NV/OT since 2003. \nThe Indians warmed up for the occasion by reaching a season high in points behind the dynamic passing combination of Pimpinella and senior quarterback Colin Dedrick. The pair teamed up for four touchdown passes, highlighted by a 89-yarder on the third play of the game to set the tempo for the afternoon. \n“He just comes through on his reads, and he always seems to be open,” said Dedrick, who completed seven passes to Pimpinella for 215 yards. “They were giving me Mike all day.” \nThe Indians also did their usual nice job on the ground. Senior running back Andrew Flores was the workhorse (22 carries for 116 yards), but senior Jake Giambona (47 yards, three touchdowns) and junior Josh Tillis (85 yards) did their share of the heavy lifting. \nEqually eye-opening was the defense, which did an outstanding job of keeping Bergenfield senior quarterback Jovani Haskins from putting his stamp on the game. Senior linebacker Joe Williams, a candidate for The Record Defensive Player of the Year, was particularly effective, staying in Haskins’ face while knocking down three passes and sacking Haskins once. \n“That was fun,” Williams said. “When you get a chance to go after the quarterback like that, you go do it.” \nIt was all part of an interesting day for Pascack Valley coach Craig Nielsen, a Bergenfield alum whose class was celebrating its 40th reunion Saturday. Nielsen said he bleeds Pascack Valley green, but it’s not easy playing the alma mater. \n“I root for Bergenfield every game except one,” Nielsen said with a smile. \nThree of Pascack Valley’s victories this season have been decided by a touchdown or less while NV/Old Tappan has run roughshod over the opposition, averaging a North Jersey-best 47.4 points per game. At the very least, it will make for some very interesting matchups and even more interesting theater. \n“Matchups don’t mean anything,” Pimpinella said. “On paper is on paper. This game is going to be decided on the field.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:18:22.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
