But his influence is being felt more and more — and the junior from Topeka, Kansas, expects to see even more time when BYU (4-2) hosts its second-straight American Athletic Conference opponent, Cincinnati, on Friday night at 6 p.m. MT on ESPN. \n\"As far as I know, my role has been increased for this week,\" said Tuiloma, who also has a quarterback hurry in 2015. \"They want me to collapse the pocket more, so I think I will get more plays in this week. I feel healthier this week, so I'll be out there more.\" \nTuiloma tried to come back as early as Week 4 against Michigan, but setbacks hindered his progress and he finally got back on the field in the Cougars' second home game in a four-week stretch last weekend.

Allred/Deseret News/File) \nThe wait was too long in many ways, he said. \n\"I wanted to be back as soon as I could, as soon as I was ready to be back and comfortable,\" Tuiloma added. \"I mean, 4-6 weeks was what we were looking at with the trainers. I'm feeling pretty good — a lot better than before.\" \nTuiloma prides himself in stopping the run, but he knows he will be relied on more to help cover the pass and bat down throws at the line of scrimmage. He's already preparing for that with the possibility of Bearcats quarterback Gunner Kiel cleared to return to game action Friday against BYU. \nKiel, a Notre Dame transfer, has not been given the starting job, but Cincinnati coach Tommy Tuberville said Monday he will compete with incumbent Hayden Moore to start Friday after suffering a neck injury Sept. 24 against Memphis. \n\"I just try to collapse the pocket as fast as I can, since they are a passing team,\" Tuiloma said of Cincinnati. \"I prefer a run stop team; it's more of my forte. I take pride in stopping the run.\" \nEither way, the Bearcats' pocket passers could present a challenge across the BYU defense. Kiel has 868 passing yards and five touchdowns with five interceptions in 2015, while Moore has thrown for 836 yards, six touchdowns and three picks at a nearly 67 percent completion rate. \nMendenhall said defending the pass better starts with Tuiloma and the defensive linemen up front. \n\"It starts first with defensive linemen getting their hands up, and then we add variety to coverage,\" Mendenhall said. \"You have to add variety and put more stress. We did that well for three quarters (against East Carolina). And then we can't make plays on ball in the air in a tight stretch. \n\"I'm pretty optimistic of what I saw.\" \nListen to interviews with Mendenhall, Tuiloma and offensive lineman Ryker Mathews in the \"Cougar Cuts\" section below.
