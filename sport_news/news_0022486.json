Jackson led the Tigers with 44 yards on the ground in the loss. \nBY ANDY KRUTSINGER \nMt. Pleasant News \nThe Iowa Wesleyan football team had it’s share of troubles in Saturday afternoon’s conference game against Eureka. The Red Devils were able to capitalize on four Tiger turnovers and running back LeAnthony Reasnover went for 145 yards and three scores on the ground to help hand Wesleyan the 35-0 loss. \nReasnover scored the first two touchdowns of the game, one in the first quarter and one in the second, but the biggest play of the first half was a 50-yard interception return with less than two minutes to go in the second quarter. Eureka’s Ricky Martinez had the pick-six that pushed the game to 21-0 at halftime. \nIn the second half, the Red Devils were able to score two more times, one on a Reasnover rush and another on a six-yard pass to Dontai Johnson. The Tiger offense was unable to cut into the lead, and Wesleyan fell to 0-7 on the season. \nAlex Payne was back in at quarterback for the Tigers. He went 6-15 for 109 yards and one interception. His favorite target was Jeremy Gomez, who caught three balls for 35 yards, but Tylor Hoyle had the longest catch of the day, a 66-yard catch and run in the second half. \nBryson Oliver ran for eight yards on five attempts and had two catches for eight yards. The leading rusher on the day was Larry Jackson, who gained 44 yards on nine attempts. \nThe Tigers out-passed the Red Devils 109-52 in overall yardage, but the Red Devils netted 340 yards on the ground, while the Tigers netted just 16. \nIowa Wesleyan (0-7 overall, 0-6 in district play) has three more shots to jump into the winner’s column. This Saturday, they will play MacMurray College (2-4, 2-4) on the road. After that, they will travel to Martin Luther College (2-5, 1-5) and then finish up with Crown College (3-4, 3-3) at home in the last game of the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T01:57:44.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
