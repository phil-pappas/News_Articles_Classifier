Tennessee is a big-time school, a big-time program. They have produced a lot of superstars. I told my dad and my uncle about the offer, and they were really excited.\" \nThe 6-foot, 175-pound Jones said last week on Twitter that he was still committed to USC but that his recruitment is now open . He has a good relationship with USC assistant coach and Mobile native Tee Martin. Ironically, Martin quarterbacked the Vols to the national title in 1998. \n\"Tennessee is an outstanding school, an outstanding program,\" Saraland coach Jeff Kelly said. \"I think this offer will give Velus a tough choice to make down the road. With everything that has happened at USC, he is definitely investigating and looking into his options, and there are some really good options out there for him.\" \nWhen he decided on USC, Jones also had SEC offers from Florida, Mississippi State, Kentucky and Missouri. UCLA, California, Louisville, Southern Mississippi, Troy, South Alabama and Tulsa also had offered him. Alabama and Auburn have both expressed an interest in Jones in the past but haven't extended a scholarship offer. \nJones said he talked to Tennessee coach Butch Jones on Tuesday morning. \n\"He told me a little about the school and how excited they are about me,\" Jones said of the conversation. \"He said they thought I could do big things there and had been looking for someone with my type of talent. I was honored.\" \nJones has tentatively scheduled visits to Mississippi State later in the season and Cal-Berkeley after the season. He said he also would likely visit Tennessee at some point. He has no timetable for finalizing his college decision. \n\"I want a place I'm comfortable with, a place I can call home, a place where I can focus on my education and on football,\" he said. \"If I find something I think is better for me than USC, then I'll go after it. I'm just waiting to see what is out there. I'll know when it happens. It will be a gut feeling.\" \nJones has played some of his best football for the Class 6A No. 5 Spartans (7-1) in the last three weeks. He has scored 10 touchdowns in wins over Citronelle, Baldwin County and LeFlore by way of reception, run or kick return. \n\"He's always been really good, but the last three or four games he has played at a different speed,\" Kelly said. \nAs a junior, Jones caught 51 passes for 1,118 yards and nine touchdowns in helping Saraland to the Class 6A championship game. He was a first-team All-State and All-Region selection. Kelly said the recruiting attention has not affected Jones' play on the field at all at any point. \n\"He is focusing on this year and playing ball, and he knows there will be a time to worry about recruiting,\" Kelly said. \"He has not let it affect him at all. Velus has been an outstanding teammate. He practices hard and plays hard. This hasn't changed him one bit.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:39:29.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
