(WKYT) - B. Wayne Hughes’ Beholder, sporting the first Breeders’ Cup saddle towel seen this week at Keeneland, made her first appearance on the main track Thursday morning galloping once around under exercise rider Janeen Painter. She was pre-entered in the $5 million Breeders’ Cup Classic (G1) and $2 million Longines Breeders’ Cup Distaff (G1) with first preference in the Classic. \nBeholder, who had an elevated temperature Tuesday morning, came on the track at the Beard Course chute and went straight off down the backside. After going once around, she returned to her barn on Rice Road and walked the shedrow under Painter for about 20 minutes. \n“Things are a lot better today than they were two days ago,” trainer Richard Mandella said. “It was just a simple gallop this morning. We’re back in the game.” \nBeholder, who has had two five-furlong breezes at Santa Anita since winning the Zenyatta (G1) on Sept. 26, is scheduled for one work here before the Classic on Oct. 31. \n“I am not sure when she will have a little breeze,” Mandella said. “We will let her tell us. We came here ready to run.” \nBeholder was one of the first horses to move into the designated Breeders’ Cup barn area on Rice Road and Mandella is a big fan of his star runner’s accommodations. \n“This is a great setting back here to train horses,” Mandella said. “It was very well thought out and these barns are great.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:30:30.628+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
