The Falcons improved to 4-0 for only the fourth time in club history. \nFreeman had touchdown runs of 16, 23 and 6 yards. He set up another score with a 44-yard reception. \nNothing went right for the Texans (1-3). Quarterback Ryan Mallett was yanked after the Falcons built a 42-0 lead. Running back Arian Foster made his season debut after tearing his groin early in training camp, but he couldn't find room to run. He even had the ball knocked out of his hands by one of his own teammates, leading to a Falcons touchdown. BENGALS 36, CHIEFS 21 \nAndy Dalton added to his streak of impressive games and big plays, throwing a 55-yard touchdown pass on the run, and Cincinnati stayed unbeaten. \nThe Bengals (4-0) matched the third-best start in franchise history, two wins shy of the club record. \nDalton completed 17 of 24 for 321 yards with the long touchdown pass to Brandon Tate during a scramble. \nAlex Smith was sacked five times, the Chiefs (1-3) settled for Cairo Santos' club-record seven field goals, and the defense couldn't keep up with another one of the NFL's top passers. PANTHERS 37, BUCCANEERS 23 \nCam Newton threw for two touchdowns and Josh Norman returned one of Carolina's four interceptions of Jameis Winston for his second TD of the season. Advertisement \nNewton tossed scoring passes of 6 and 12 yards to Ted Ginn Jr. A week after making a game-saving interception in the end zone against New Orleans, Norman scored on a 46-yard run back and later returned a another pick 34 yards to set up a second TD. \nThe Panthers improved to 4-0 for the first time since 2003. The Bucs (1-3) have dropped 11 consecutive home games. JETS 27, DOLPHINS 14 \nChris Ivory ran for a career-high 166 yards and Ryan Fitzpatrick threw for 218, one touchdown and one interception to lead the Jets at Wembley Stadium in the first division game played in London. \nMiami's Ndamukong Suh, the highest-paid defensive player in league history, had three tackles — the first in the third quarter — and no sacks. \nBoth teams have byes next week, as usual for teams playing in London. Miami (1-3) will face lots of questions about its poor performances thus far. \nFitzpatrick threw for 172 yards in the first half, including a 58-yard completion to Brandon Marshall on the first play for the Jets (3-1). REDSKINS 23, EAGLES 20 \nKirk Cousins threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Pierre Garcon with 26 seconds left for Washington. \nStarting at their own 10 with a little more than six minutes remaining, the Redskins (2-2) drove 90 yards on 15 plays to take the lead for good in a back-and-forth game. \nCousins finished 31 for 46 for 290 yards and no turnovers. Sam Bradford threw three second-half touchdown passes for the Eagles (1-3), but their new kicker, Caleb Sturgis, missed an extra-point attempt and a 33-yard field-goal try. BEARS 22, RAIDERS 20 \nJay Cutler threw for two touchdowns and redeemed himself following an interception by helping set up a 49-yard field goal by Robbie Gould with 2 seconds left for Chicago. \nIt was the Bears' first win under coach John Fox. \nThe Raiders (2-2) grabbed the lead on a field goal by Sebastian Janikowski with just over two minutes remaining that was set up by an interception by Charles Woodson deep in Oakland territory. \nCutler then led Chicago (1-3) from its 20 to the Oakland 32 before Gould nailed the winner. GIANTS 24, BILLS 10 \nRashad Jennings broke three tackles to score on a 51-yard touchdown catch midway through the fourth quarter for New York. \nEli Manning went 20 of 35 for 212 yards and three touchdowns for the Giants (2-2). New York's defense did the rest with Prince Amukamara stripping receiver Robert Woods of the ball to force a fumble with 3:41 left. \nThe Bills (2-2) were called for 17 penalties totaling 135 yards. COLTS 16, JAGUARS 13, OT \nAdam Vinatieri kicked a 27-yard field goal with 4:36 left in overtime to give Indianapolis an NFL record-tying 15th consecutive win over a division opponent. \nThe 1972-73 Miami Dolphins also win 15 straight. \nMatt Hasselbeck made his first start since November 2012 in place of the injured Andrew Luck, and led the Colts (2-2) on a 53-yard march to step up the winning points. \nThe Jaguars (1-3) lined up twice for field goals with 6 seconds left in regulation, but Jason Myers' first attempt from 53 yards sailed wide right — just after the Colts had called timeout. Myers' second chance also went wide right. Then in overtime, his 48-yard attempt went wide left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T14:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:51:47.277+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
