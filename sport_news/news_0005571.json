The new is that they haven’t met each other as unbeaten teams since the 1986 season. The familiar is that just two years ago in 2013, the two programs met for a conference championship with Havelock winning, 21-7. After that tough loss and two blowouts last season, the Eagles are hungry for another shot at the Rams, with a team they feel well enough equipped to win. “I think more than hungry, now this year it is a confidence,” Riggsbee said. “I don’t think they will beat us just by stepping off the bus. Our guys know that our team is better than it has been in recent years and I’m confident in them, confident in how we have prepared and in our game plan, but more importantly, they (Eagle players) are confident.” West Craven has rushed for 1,600 yards as a team with senior quarterback Darious Abrams leading with 770 (eight touchdowns), senior running back Danny Harvey has 380 (eight TDs) and junior Jaquel Whitehead has chipped in 241 (six scores). Havelock’s rushing attack has been even more potent led by the sensational play of junior running back Tony Sharpe who has run for 1,129 yards and 18 touchdowns in seven games. Juniors Corey Cooper (quarterback) and Montrece Gatling (running back/defensive back) have added 435 and 458 yards, respectively. Gatling has run for seven touchdowns and Cooper has added three. Also at stake in this game is a lot of pride and the non-existent “county championship,” as both teams have beaten New Bern this season. “Mainly what we have told the kids all week is this is their shot to show a lot of people that they are on top. We have nothing to lose and Havelock are the ones with everything on the line,” Riggsbee said. Bryant said the game is part of a different goal for his kids. “Every year preseason when we talk about goals we talk about going undefeated in nonconference first, then in conference,” he said. “New Bern just happens to be on our nonconference schedule and West Craven in our conference.” Neither team has lit the scoreboard on fire with the passing game as Cooper has thrown for 711 yards and 10 touchdowns to six interceptions, while Abrams has passed for 402 yards and six scores and two interceptions. West Craven wide receiver and Abrams’ older brother Malik, has been the go-to pass catcher, hauling in three touchdowns this season on 326 yards receiving. Defense, like the run game, has been a flourishing aspect of the game for both teams. Page 2 of 2 - The Eagles are allowing 13.0 points per game, while Havelock holds opponents to 13.3 per. Havelock has 23 sacks as a team, while West Craven has produced 15. “I think that our defensive line is going to be the best that they have seen and I also think that their defensive line will be the best we have seen,” Riggsbee said. Bryant said much of the same about the defense of the Eagles. “They are going to be the best D-line we’ve seen so far,” he said. “They are tall, athletic and long and they have some linebackers that can tackle well.” Two winning streaks worthy of note are on the line for Havelock. The Rams have won 34 straight road games and 29 straight Coastal 3A Conference games.
