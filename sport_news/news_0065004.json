By Mark Lelinwalla Filed Under New York Giants , Sports News , Sports , NFL \nThis is one of those moments when the game of football takes a backseat to everything. \nOn Monday, Bleacher Report reported that New York Giants tight end Daniel Fells lost parts of his foot and will never play football again as he continues to battle an aggressive, potentially life-threatening MRSA staph infection. \nDoctors hope that powerful antibiotics can keep Fells from coming down with a blood infection and losing his entire foot. \nAs of Sunday morning, Fells, 32, had already undergone five surgeries to ward off the MRSA infection with more procedures possibly on the way. After suffering a foot injury earlier this month, Fells received a cortisone shot. When the pain didn't subside, his temperature shot up to 104 degrees and he was diagnosed with the MRSA staph infection on October 2. \n“This is a serious situation that has been taken seriously from the beginning,” Giants spokesman Pat Hanlon said in a statement to the media. “We’re all fighting for Daniel.” Even through the trying ordeal, there has been a glimmer of good news, though.
