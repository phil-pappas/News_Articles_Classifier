The freshness comes from the first new coach in a decade, the addition of two marquee veterans and the push from the next generation. Injuries already have set in, but still the approach is one of renewed rosiness. \n“We have the personnel to be really good,” captain Henrik Zetterberg said. “You will always get injuries, but we have guys that can get the job done no matter what. We are tired of going through the whole season and then when the fun starts, we are only there for two weeks.” \nThe Wings make the playoffs with a regularity that would make a Swiss clockmaker swoon — 24 consecutive seasons, by far the longest active streak in the NHL — but the equally regular early exits have left players ticked off. \n“We are not dwelling on 24 years,” defenseman Kyle Quincey said. “We are dwelling on the fact that we have lost in the first round a couple of times. We are definitely hungry, that is for sure. \n“This just feels like a fresh start. We got a new voice, a fresh voice.” \nThat belongs to Jeff Blashill, who took over as coach in June. He sees a team that, with a good foundation and daily hard work, has good times on the horizon. \n“I would say there are two things that really could separate us,” Blashill said. “One is the character of the group in the locker room. I know that sounds cliché-ish; it’s not at all. The parity in the league is such that the difference is so minimal it comes down to character, it comes down to who is getting just a little bit better every day. And I think we have as good character (as), if not the best of, anybody in the league. \n“The other part is depth. We have great depth with the four lines through the defense and through the goaltending position, and that extends down to Grand Rapids. I think our depth and our character are the two things that will help us get to the spot we want to be.” \n‘Time for a coaching change’ \nJeff Blashill’s office at Joe Louis Arena is bare of any personal mementos, of pictures of his wife or their three children. It’s not so much deliberate as it is habit. As a career coach, he works in a field where tenure tends to be short and exits tend to be rushed. \n“That is the nature of this business — you just never know,” Blashill said. “I’ve gone into every job hoping I can make it to Christmas.” \nBlashill’s predecessor, Mike Babcock, was in Detroit for 10 years. The first five saw one Stanley Cup championship, two Stanley Cup finals appearances, three Western Conference finals appearances and only one first-round exit. The latter half saw three first-round exits and two second-round exits. The Wings offered contract extensions to Babcock throughout the 2014-15 season, but ultimately his decision to leave for Toronto was not mourned. \n“It was time for a coaching change for both Mike and the club,” Zetterberg said. “We needed a fresh voice. And it was easy for us to have Blash take over. He was ready. He had been doing a good job in Grand Rapids and really improved as a coach every year, got more and more confident as he got experience. It is an easy transition for us to have him as a coach.” \nVeterans on the team know Blashill from the season he spent as an assistant to Babcock, in 2011-12. The younger generation were coached by him in the AHL over the past three seasons. Sharp: Wings' youth movement renews energy \nThe few players Blashill felt he didn’t know well enough, he watched on video over the summer. Blashill was promoted by the Wings on June 9, signed to a four-year deal — and that was the end of his vacation. \n“The summers before you start a new job, whether it is this job or the other jobs I have taken, you have that nervous feeling,” Blashill said. “You want to make sure you are prepared. So the summers aren’t quite as enjoyable as the summers where you are settled in. I certainly enjoyed my summer, but I wanted to make sure we were prepared.” \nFresh faces \nAs Blashill did his homework, general manager Ken Holland went to market. A year after the top three defensemen the Wings pursued via unrestricted free agency — Matt Niskanen, Dan Boyle and Stephane Robidas — all signed elsewhere, for equal or less money, the Wings got their men. July 1 yielded Mike Green, a creative, offensive defenseman who shoots right, and Brad Richards, a creative, offensive center with a significant playoff résumé. \nThe Wings have not had a productive right-hand shot defenseman since Brian Rafalski departed four years ago. \n“Green was our top target,” Holland said. “He plays top-four minutes, was a two-time finalist for the Norris Trophy. He turns 30 (on Monday), so he is at a great age. He can create offense, he can make a pass, transition from defense to offense. We thought with the players we have here, he’d be a great complement.” \nSigning Green for three years and $18 million wasn’t the only hefty financial decision the Wings made over the summer. After two years of injury, ineptitude and disappointment, the Wings bought out the remaining three years on the contract of Stephen Weiss, a player for whom Babcock had pushed in 2013. \nThat enabled making a one-year, $3-million commitment to Richards, who was still basking in the afterglow of his second Stanley Cup title. Richards appears on a late-career tour of Original Six teams, bouncing since 2014 from the New York Rangers to the Chicago Blackhawks to the Wings, piling up numbers with the miles. \nRichards, 35, won the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoffs’ most valuable player in 2004 with the Tampa Bay Lightning. He is durable (he has missed just 20 games the past six seasons) and productive (he has accumulated 26 points in 48 playoff games over the past two seasons). \nIdeally, once Pavel Datsyuk returns from off-season ankle surgery, Richards will be the reason Datsyuk and Zetterberg can play together. \n“There were a variety of reasons we signed Brad,” Holland said. “We had gotten the news that Pavel needed surgery. He won a Cup in Chicago. He won a Cup with Tampa Bay. He is a center, and you can never have enough centers. He has high hockey IQ. He is creative. He can get the puck to his wingers. \n“We made a decision to buy out Stephen Weiss, and rather than sit on the money that freed, we brought Brad here. Add everything up, it made great sense.” \nRichards and Green have veterans excited — “we made the right moves that should help us get out of Game 7s,” Zetterberg said — and the younger generation have veterans smiling. \nNone more so than Zetterberg. He will celebrate his 35th birthday on opening night. He became a first-time father in August, which is why spending September surrounded by the likes of Dylan Larkin, Andreas Athanasiou, Anthony Mantha and Tyler Bertuzzi was so invigorating. \nZetterberg knows that he is getting old for a professional athlete. He remembers a decade ago, when he and Datsyuk began taking over for Steve Yzerman and Brendan Shanahan. \nNow Zetterberg, Datsyuk, Johan Franzen and Niklas Kronwall have all rounded into their mid-30s, and being pushed turns out to be as fun as pushing. \n“That is the way it is supposed to be, and it is fun to see,” Zetterberg said. “It is fun to be on the other side, and it is actually inspiring for us to improve and be on our toes.” \nLarkin had such a good September he made the Wings roster at 19. Athanasiou looked almost ready to challenge for an NHL spot. Mantha looked good. There are good prospects on defense, too. From Detroit to Grand Rapids, the Wings look stocked. \n“There’s been a lot of energy this camp and a lot of good kids where you can tell they are on their way,” Franzen said. “We have a really deep team, and when you have this kind of depth, then you can be a real playoff contender.” \n‘The streak is not the goal’ \nThe Wings’ playoff streak is an achievement that should not be sullied just because the Wings have not made it past the second round in five years. In two of those years, 2013 and 2015, the Wings lost Game 7s to the eventual Cup champion and Cup runner-up, respectively. \nIt is, though, the parts that interest the Wings more than the sum of the streak. The NHL season is long — 82 games over half a year — and now that the salary cap has created nearly league-wide parity, every game really does matter. It is a rigorous, challenging task to get to the playoffs, and so to get there only to go home so soon afterward is crushing for such a proud team. \n“It is tiring for us,” Zetterberg said. “Obviously you have to make the postseason to go all the way, so we have to keep that streak going, but the streak is not the goal for us. We want to go further.” \nZetterberg does not want to be the captain under whom the streak ends. Blashill does not want that mark next to his NHL head coaching debut. The streak matters, but in the way that it is a necessary part of a greater goal. \n“The streak is a heck of a compliment to the longevity and success the Red Wings have had,” Blashill said. “It will be looked at in the history of the NHL as an unbelievable thing. \n“For our team in particular, the streak doesn’t mean anything. What matters though, is getting in the playoffs. Our goal is to win the Stanley Cup, and the only way to win the Stanley Cup is to earn one of the eight spots in the Eastern conference to compete in the Stanley Cup playoffs.” \nOctober may be the second-best month in the NHL behind June, when the last team standing starts a summer-long soiree. In October, every team is optimistic. For every team, anything can happen. \nThe Wings enter the season with an exhilaration sprung from fresh faces young and old, and a motivation kindled by a string of early playoff exits. Fun is theirs to grasp.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:40:54.352+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
