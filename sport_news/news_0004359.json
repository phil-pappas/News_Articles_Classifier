The Bears won, 22-20. — H. Rick Bamman - hbamman@shawmedia.com \nLAKE FOREST – Stop the presses and rerack the video, not only is Bears defensive coordinator Vic Fangio here to resurrect the glory days of a once proud defense, he thinks he can deliver the first World Series title for the Cubs in 107 years, too. \n“Don’t be surprised if the Cubs win the World Series this year,\" Fangio said after Wednesday's practice to open his session with the media. “San Francisco, I was there for five years and the Giants won three World Series and they’d never won one before, and I was in Houston when they got to their only World Series. \n“I bring good luck to the baseball teams.” \nAsked whether he’s planning on running for mayor next, Fangio shot back, “If [the Cubs] win, I probably could. Or at least they’ll hire me.” \nIt’s amazing what one win can do to change the mood around an NFL team. \nAccording to Fangio, “Winning has cured more ills than penicillin, and winning just feels better.” \nClearly the quote of the day at a much more enthusiastic Halas Hall than anyone has seen since the beginning of the 2015 season, mainly because the Bears are beginning to believe there will be more to celebrate this year than just their lonely \"W\" to date. \nThe best thing about the Bears' 22-20 win over the Raiders is that several defenders, including Pernell McPhee, Jarvis Jenkins, Adrian Amos and Tracy Porter, strung back-to-back solid performances, and playmakers are starting to emerge. \nFangio has been slow to dole out praise, but he was in a giving mood with an extra bounce in his step Wednesday. \n“Well, I’m pleased with the win, No. 1. Our defense has been progressing each and every week, I think. We’ve been getting better and better and had some solid play in there in spite of the three losses. But we are improving.” \nHe also talked about what McPhee is starting to mean to his group. \n“I think he’s done a decent job all year long,\" he said. \"There are certain aspects in the games he excels in, and they came to surface this past week. And we expect him to be one of our good players not only this year but moving forward.” \nFor his part, Jenkins thinks McPhee is a huge piece of the puzzle and even credits him for some of his own success. \n“Because he is a leader. He knows that he’ll get the ball rolling. He comes out with a positive energy trying to get us going and that’s been working. \n“Anytime you are confident in what you are doing and how you are playing, that rubs off on other people.” \nJenkins also believes the big uglies up front are helping the secondary get its act together and knows the play of Porter, Amos and others is benefitting him. \n“We’re getting rushes. Those guys don’t have to cover for so long. That ball is coming out fast,\" said Jenkins, who has three sacks. \"Pass rush always complements your secondary. Like my sack, that was a coverage sack. I actually got to the quarterback fast last game. I credit those guys on my coverage sack.” \nFangio was particularly impressed with Porter’s play against Amari Cooper on Sunday after telling the media he doesn’t usually ask his DBs to shadow a player all over the field. \n“He’s got good corner ability,\" Fangio said of Porter. \"He’s got good movement, got good football instincts and savvy. Knows how to play the game, understands the game. The game’s not too big for him.” \nAs for Amos, Fangio said he really is starting to lead the secondary. \n“Obviously, he’s the most experienced guy back there. When I say experienced, even though he’s a rookie, he’s had the most reps within our system in our short time here. He’s become the vocal commander back there.” \nFangio certainly knows there is work to do. \n“Well, 'Turn the corner,' that is a pretty strong statement,\" he said in response to a question. \"We still are 1-3.” \nBut the Bears' defensive chief and his troops are sounding like a group that believes they’re seeing the light at the end of the tunnel. \n• Chicago Football editor Hub Arkush can be reached at harkush@chicagofootball.com and on Twitter @Hub_Arkush.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:31:12.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
