Image 16 of 16 Spurs' hiring of Becky Hammon kicked off pro sports revolution 1 / 16 Back to Gallery The Spurs had absolutely no interest in starting a revolution when they hired Becky Hammon as the first full-time female assistant coach in the history of U.S. professional sports.\nIndeed, they didn’t reference her gender at all when announcing the hire last August. And as Gregg Popovich would say later, “It doesn’t matter if you’re a man or a woman,” Popovich said. “It’s the same pick-and-roll.”\nRELATED: Becky Hammon crosses another item off her bucket list - from the sky\nOthers were apparently watching. As noted last week by Fortune magazine , no fewer than six other women have since attained prominent positions within the bounds of professional sports:\nSarah Thomas, NFL referee Jen Welter, NFL coaching intern Beth Mowins, NFL broadcast announcer Nancy Lieberman, NBA assistant coach Jessica Mendoza, MLB broadcast announcer Jessica Siegal, MLB instructional coach It certainly could be a coincidence. But given the success the Spurs have had with Hammon, who fit seamlessly with Popovich’s veteran staff before leading the summer league squad to victory in Las Vegas, it’s hard to imagine their historic hire didn’t have at least some influence on the sudden female influx.\nIf so, Hammon gladly serves as a torchbearer.\n“I hope this opens the door for more women to walk through and make a spot at the table in men’s professional sports,” she said earlier this summer . “Guys don’t have to get up and leave the table. Just scoot over a little bit.”", "external_links": ["http://fortune.com/2015/10/02/women-in-mens-sports/", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/33/60/57/7277525/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/47/52/8551043/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/40/36/6686602/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/47/52/8551043/7/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/24/52/8473226/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/24/04/6635807/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/41/32/6690455/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/27/10/6648332/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/becky_hammon/bio.html", "http://www.expressnews.com/sports/spurs/article/Spurs-Becky-Hammon-Just-call-her-Coach-6375831.php", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/14/51/64/3317046/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/04/22/51/1124937/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/24/04/6635807/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/41/07/6689272/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/41/07/6689272/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/41/32/6690454/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/41/32/6690455/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/41/07/6689271/3/920x920.jpg", "http://mysa.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20San%20Antonio%20Express-News&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/20/27/8455655/15/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/60/60/8588331/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/33/60/57/7277525/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/20/27/8455655/15/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/14/51/64/3317046/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/60/60/8588331/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/41/32/6690454/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://www.expressnews.com/sports/spurs/article/head-tag-with-5670818.php?cmpid=twitter-premium&t=f245b0b7d1eb16c911", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/40/24/52/8473226/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/61/55/8330070/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/31/40/36/6686602/7/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/37/61/55/8330070/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/31/41/07/6689271/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/31/27/10/6648332/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/40/20/27/8455655/15/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/04/22/51/1124937/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:37:05.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
