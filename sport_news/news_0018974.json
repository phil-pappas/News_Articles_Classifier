He took over last month following the sacking of Niko Kovac. \nMalta have not won in 23 competitive home matches and will finish bottom of the group after taking just two points from their nine qualifiers. \nAlso in Group H, Bulgaria and Azerbaijan square off in Sofia with both teams out of contention for next year's tournament. \nBulgaria saw their hopes of qualifying end in Saturday's defeat to Croatia. They have not won at home in qualifying and are fourth in the standings, two points clear of Azerbaijan. \nIn Group A, anything but a defeat against Iceland in Konya will see Turkey clinch a play-off place. \nTurkey have won just one of their eight encounters against Iceland but a home draw would be enough to see Fatih Terim's side clinch third place and in the process cause Holland to miss their first Euro finals since 1984. \nTurkey won 2-0 at the Czech Republic on Saturday and are third in the pool, two points clear of the Dutch, who won their game at Kazakhstan 2-1 on Friday. \nShould the Turks finish level on points with Holland, Terim's side holds a superior head-to-head record. \nIceland and the Czech Republic have earned direct qualification to France but victory in Turkey would see Iceland finish top of the pool. \nThe Czechs, who visit Holland, are one point adrift of Iceland, who have the edge on goal difference should both teams finish level on points. \nIn the other pool game, Kazakhstan will look to clinch their first win in qualifying when they take on Latvia in Riga. \nThey are bottom of the pool but can overtake fourth-placed Latvia in the standings if they clinch three away points. \nBelgium square off against Israel in Brussels knowing victory will see them finish first in Group B. \nMarc Wilmots' side are on a 13-match unbeaten run at home in competitive fixtures. \nBelgium won 4-1 at Andorra on Saturday to move two points clear of second-placed Wales and book their Euro 2016 spot. \nWales, who host Andorra, have a better head-to-head with Belgium meaning Wilmots' men must win their game against Israel to be assured of taking top spot in the pool. \nIsrael go into the contest needing a win and hoping Bosnia and Herzegovina drop points in Cyprus in order to finish third in the standings. \nBosnia and Herzegovina are favourites to clinch the play-off place after beating Wales to move third. \nThe Bosnians are one point clear of Israel and two points above Tuesday's opponents Cyprus. \nCyprus, who beat Bosnia and Herzegovina 2-1 the last time the sides met, need a victory in Nicosia and for Belgium to deny Israel three points in order to take a play-off spot.
