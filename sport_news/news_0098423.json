Having trailed by 17 points, the Bengals went on to beat Seattle, 27-24, in overtime.\nThe day started well for the Bengals, with Andy Dalton driving his team 86 yards for a touchdown on their opening drive. It looked like it could get out of hand in Cincinnati’s favor when Dalton connected with A.J. Green for an apparent 72-yard touchdown on the team’s next possession, but a holding penalty nullified the play, and Cincinnati settled for a punt.\n Related Coverage Packers Roll Past Rams, but Aaron Rodgers’s Interception Streak Ends OCT. 11, 2015 N.F.L.
