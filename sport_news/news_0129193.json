That would translate to 16 wins over an 82-game schedule. \nHere are 5 talking points after the Devils' first 5 games: \n1. Playing without the lead \nWhen Lee Stempniak scored at 3:07 of overtime Sunday afternoon, it gave the Devils their first lead of the season. Playing from behind creates a lot of pressure. \n\"At times,\" Stempniak said. \"I think when it happens early, we're trying not to change our mentality. We're trying to play the same way no matter what. Obviously as the game goes on and things tighten you have to start taking chances late in the game. So that's hard when you're trailing.\"When it's early you obviously want to have the lead. But I think as a whole we've tried to preach that patience of continuing to play our game, not get running around early and taking chances too early and taking yourself out of the game.\" \nTechnically, goalie Cory Schneider has not yet played with a lead. \n\"That's all right. I'll take the win first,\" Schneider said. \nRELATED: Lee Stempniak shows how to become a Devils hero \n2. No goals from young forwards \nThe Devils have scored eight goals in their first five games and seven of them have come from veteran forwards. The other was scored by defenseman Eric Gelinas. \nReid Boucher, Stefan Matteau, Brian O'Neill, Sergey Kalinin and Jacob Josefson have all yet to score a goal. \n3. Adam Larsson continues to impress \nThe young defenseman broke through last season. Everyone waited to see what he would do this season with a new coaching staff and the answer has been impressive. \nSkating with Andy Greene on the Devils' top defensive pairing, Larsson has been sensational as he gets more and more responsibility. At this rate, he could be an All-Star. \n\"They were very good. They had tough matchups all night,\" coach John Hynes said of Greene and Larsson. \"I thought Greene played really solid, as he usually does. But it's nice to see Larsson really taking a step in some of these roles as a real young defensemen, to be able to play those types of minutes and be consistent.\" \n4. An enthusiastic young coach \nHynes has been interesting, to say the least. \nHe has pulled his goalie in two games with three minutes remaining, including once with the opposing team on a power play. Although he doesn't want to get labeled as an analytics geek, he clearly believes in using them. \nHynes, along with GM Ray Shero and a player vote, made a solid choice in naming Greene captain. \nAs for his style and lineup choices, he's been adaptable. He's still experimenting with his line combinations and most would admit he's done a good job with what he's been given. \n5. The absence of Patrik Elias \nThe word is that Elias is skating on his own more and more as he recovers from a sore right knee. When he is seen around Prudential Center, he's in good spirits. \nBut what does this season hold for the 39-year-old veteran? Will he be okay when he is ready to play, or is he prone to reinjuring the knee and missing most of what could be his last season? \nMore to the point, where will he fit in? The Devils' lineup is not deep enough that a player of Elias's caliber would be unable to step in, but where might that be? The guess right now would be on the wing with Jacob Josefson as his center. That pairing could help both players. \n* * *", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:30:11.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
