Behrman said he wasn't able to get a 16th player for that first tournament until the last minute, but the field for this year's event features 128 players from more than 20 countries.\nWhile players chased a $3,000 top prize that first year, they will be competing for $188,000 this year, including $40,000 to the winner.\nMuch of the attention will be focused on Shane Van Boening of South Dakota, the only player to win three straight U.S. Open titles. He'll be chasing his fourth in a row this year.\nFinland's Mike Immonen and England's Darren Appleton, who both own back-to-back championships, are among the top contenders. In fact, Van Boening, Immonen and Appleton have combined to win every U.S. Open title since 2006.\nA win by Van Boening would tie him with Earl Strickland for the most all-time victories in the event at five.\nThe American is coming off a loss last month in the finals of the World 9-Ball Championships in Qatar. Taiwan's Pin-Yi Ko, ranked No. 1 by the World Pool-Billiards Association, won that event and is entered in the U.S. Open field.\nPlay begins at 10:30 a.m. Sunday. Through Thursday, there are daily sessions at 10:30 a.m., 12:30 and 2:30 p.m. Night sessions run at 7, 9 and 11 p.m. Friday's schedule consists of quarterfinals at 1 p.m., semifinals at 3 p.m. and the 7 p.m. final.\nTickets are $10 per session.\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
