Pocock's back-row partner Hooper reacted to England's verbal muscle-flexing by vowing the Wallabies will leave their talking for the pitch. \n\"I think the great thing is we get 80 minutes to play on the weekend,\" said Hooper. \n\"We're sick of training each other, we've been doing that for months now. \n\"We go against each other every day in training, so when you get your hands on another team it's a good thing and you can do it together. \n\"And the belief in the group leaves us really keen to do that together.\" \nFormer Australia coach Bob Dwyer stoked the fires by claiming England loosehead Joe Marler cuts illegal scrummaging angles, but Wallabies boss Cheika refused to add weight to the accusations. \n\"Do I have to answer to him as well?\" said Cheika. \n\"The only scrummaging technique we are interested in is our own. \n\"Bob's got massive experience and is very well-respected, he's won the World Cup so his opinions are always out there. \n\"But trying to pick a fault in anything in the opposition, and trying to complain about it or talk about it is a weakness on our part. \n\"Talking about the opponent or some flaw in the opponent from our point of view is disrespectful, and it leads to an excuse environment.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T14:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:41:50.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
