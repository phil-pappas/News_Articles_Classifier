A search for a new manager has commenced and the squad will be managed in the interim by Kevin MacDonald.\" \nThe club added that assistant manager Ray Wilkins, first-team coach Mark Robson and performance analyst Seamus Brady had also left with immediate effect. \nSky sources understand Villa have approached former Lyon manager Remi Garde, but he's one of several candidates being considered. \nIt is also understood that the club are not in a rush to appoint a Sherwood successor with MacDonald taking charge for Wednesday and possibly against Tottenham next weekend. \nSherwood remained typically defiant on Saturday evening and insisted the club had the quality to turn around their fortunes. He also stayed calm concerning a perceived lack of support from the Aston Villa hierarchy. \nHowever, Villa's defeat seems to have been the final straw and news of his departure was announced on Sunday lunchtime. \nSherwood arrived at Villa Park on February 14, signing a contract until the summer of 2018. He replaced Paul Lambert after a winless run of 10 league games in which they scored just two goals. \nHe started his managerial career at Tottenham, stepping in for the sacked Andre Villas-Boas in December 2013, but was dismissed at the end of that season. \nAfter losing to Swansea, Sherwood stated he had not had any contact with Villa's owners and that he would continue working flat out to improve the team's situation. \nThe 46-year-old said: \"We're in a difficult moment, but I believe we will get out of it and this club will be in the Premier League next season. They have got to improve surely, they have got to improve and I'm expecting them to improve to keep us in the league. \n\"We survived last season and went to the [FA] Cup final and nobody spoke to me then. So I'm not expecting anybody to speak to me now.\" \nSherwood also joked he would avoid a call from the board if it wanted to sack him. \"I'll just turn my phone off,\" he said.
