Central Michigan fell to Western Michigan, 41-39. UB lost to Bowling Green, 28-22.\nTrending: If UB can’t run, it will be ugly. Anthone Taylor finished last week with a respectable 93 yards. But he had only 28 yards on nine carries as UB fell behind, 21-6, in the first half. Can UB count on its running game against a good Mid-American Conference defense? The jury is way out.\nStat check: Central Michigan is converting 44.7 percent on third downs and holding the ball 32:41, second best in the MAC. UB’s offense is underachieving on third downs (37 percent) but still is holding the ball 32:34. Which offense plays keep-away?\nStar gazing: Central’s best player is junior QB Cooper Rush (No. 10), who will make his 30th career start. He’s a lot like Joe Licata, only he’s producing more. He’s good in the pocket and he spreads the ball around. He’s third in the MAC in yards per game (295). He’s second in the MAC and 14th in the nation in completion percentage (67.4). Rush is doing it despite a lackluster running game. Watch out for TE Ben McCord (No. 89), second in the nation among TEs in receiving yards (373). ... On defense, DTs Jabari Dean (No. 52) and Louis Palmer (No. 8) ate UB’s lunch last season. Central’s two safeties, Tony Annese (No. 18) and Kavon Frazier (No. 5), are far superior to UB’s safeties. Sophomore Amari Coleman (No. 7) has played like a shut-down corner.\nAt stake: This game may well make or break UB’s season. UB needs to win one of the next two to have a realistic shot at a 7-5 record. Central Michigan isn’t as tough as next week’s foe, Ohio. Can UB overachieve this season or not? We probably find out Saturday.\nPrediction: Central Michigan 24, UB 19.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:45:12.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
