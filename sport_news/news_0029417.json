Woolridge shook free of the Gettysburg defender and took it 80 yards to the house. A two-point conversion from Brewer to Chase Carlile tied the game with 1:53 left in regulation. \n\"We are instilling that we're a team and that won't give up,\" Kennard-Dale head coach Patrick Weider said. \"No matter how far behind, we'll keep fighting.\" \nK-D (2-5, 1-3 YAIAA II) took the lead when Carlile scored on the first play of overtime with a 10-yard run. Then, after a 3-yard loss on the Warriors' first play of overtime, the Rams forced three straight incomplete passes to seal the victory.

Brewer has the legs to get away and we needed that with the way that they were defending us.\" \nGettysburg (1-6, 0-4) forced five turnovers in the first half, including four interceptions of Stike. The Warriors' two scores both came on very short fields. \nThe first followed Tyler Wilt's 39-yard punt return to the Rams' 8-yard line. Three plays after Wilt's return, Edny Celius took a sweep around the right end for a score with 3:34 left in the second quarter. \nThen Stike had a pass attempt that was deflected and intercepted by Gettysburg linebacker David Johnson who motored down to the Rams' 3-yard line. Celius scored on the next play to give the hosts a 14-0 lead with 1:31 left in the half. \nKennard-Dale outgained Gettysburg 414-234 and had a 13-7 advantage in first downs. \n\"They executed better than we did,\" Gettysburg head coach Matt Heiser said. \"Their backup quarterback was a little faster and quicker than the starter. But they were running the same plays and they didn't do anything that we didn't see on film this week.\" \nCarlile finished the evening with 97 yards rushing on 22 carries and caught three passes for 21 yards. Woolridge reeled in four passes for 128 yards. Kennard-Dale", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:04:35.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
