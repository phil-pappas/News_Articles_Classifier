In reply to Rajasthan's 318, Maharashtra top order flopped as they were reduced to 131 for 5 and they looked like folding up today itself.\nBut, Rahul Tripathi (47 batting) and Khurana (64 batting) had other ideas as they stitched 113 runs for the unbroken sixth wicket to take the visiting side to safety. Maharashtra are now even poised for first-innings points as they are now just 74 runs adrift with five wickets in hand.\nKhurana has so far hit six fours in his 99-ball knock while Tripathi was batting solid in his 107-ball stay at the crease as he hit two fours and a six.\nFor Rajasthan, K Ajay Singh grabbed two wickets while giving away 40 runs while Deepak Chahar, Aniket Choudhary and Nathu Singh took a wicket apiece.\nBrief Scores: \nRajasthan 1st Innings: 318 all out in 102.1 overs (Ashok Menaria 84, Rajat Bhatia 59; Samad Fallah 3/77, Shrikant Mundhe 3/94).\nMaharashtra 1st Innings: 244 for 5 in 71 overs (Chirag Khurana 67 batting; K Ajay Singh 2/40).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:33:35.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
