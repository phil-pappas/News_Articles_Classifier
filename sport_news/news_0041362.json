The Warriors rolled to a 7-1 win over Clarkson last night at Lawler Rink to open the season; a Clarkson team that last season was one of the tightest defensive teams in the nation, allowing the second-fewest shots in the country. \nThe Warriors put 27 on goal last night — Clarkson outshot Merrimack 31-27 — chasing Steve Perry after scoring six times on the game's first 18 shots. \nThe Warriors capitalized most on the rush, entering the zone with possession and using their speed to create mismatches in numbers when entering the zone. \n\"We are good on the rush, which is something over the last couple of weeks we have recognized,\" Merrimack head coach Mark Dennehy said. \"We have guys who can make plays and we also don't need as many looks as we've needed in the past to score. It's hard to score goals at this level. For us to get seven against a team that doesn't give up much, those are positives for sure.\" \nMathieu Tibbet and Ben Bahe each had a pair of goals for the Warriors while three players — Bahe, Brian Christie, Aaron Titcomb and Brian Christie — recorded three points each. \n\"Obviously it's a positive start,\" said Christie, a senior, who is also serving as Merrimack's captain this season. \"It's nice to put some goals on the scoreboard. There are some things we need to clean up, little things like being more decisive on the breakout, but overall you can't ask for much more on opening night.\" \nChristie has been on a line with Justin Hussar and Bahe. All there formerly played with the Topeka Roadrunners and Christie had previous experience with both players; he played with Hussar his first year in Topeka and then Bahe his second season after Hussar moved to the USHL. \n\"Benny Bahe, two huge goals, Hussar to start the third,\" Christie said. \"I thought we had a good preseason together, we've been together about the first month or two, and we've known each other for quite a while. Hard work paid off tonight.\" \nDespite the results, the Warriors still come away with things they need to work on, in particular a sloppy first period that ended in a 1-1 tie but with the Golden Knights holding a 14-5 edge in shots. \n\"I think there was some good and some we need to work on,\" Dennehy said. \"We got some bounces tonight, but all-in-all, a good first game. It's nice to be able to score some goals. (Collin Delia) made some big saves when we needed him to. The penalty kill was good. The power play has some work to do but it's early, so that's understandable. \n\"We turned too many pucks over in the first period especially at the offensive blue line. We just played a simpler game. We took advantage of some of the things we thought we could be using the points and spreading the zone. We didn't do that in the first period. That was a good sign, the guys were reacting. We had a D-zone face-off play that they snuffed out pretty quick so we made an adjustment on the bench and our guys didn't miss a beat. That's a good thing, these guys are locked in.\" \n\nat Lawler Rink, Merrimack College \nClarkson (2-1-0): 1-0-0—1 \nMerrimack (1-0-0): 1-3-3—7 \nFirst Period: 1.
