By Savannah Morning News Officials on Tybee Island are urging caution for anyone heading to the city this weekend.\nAlthough the National Hurricane Center is predicting a path for Hurricane Joaquin that travels well to the east of Tybee Island, the associated weather pattern may bring heavy rain and wind to the Tybee Island area through the coming weekend.\nWinds from the storm will result in high risk of rip currents developing on Tybee Island beaches. Given the expected heavy surf and strong rip currents, we are advising that people stay out of the water this weekend especially in the hours before and after high tide. Young children and people with limited swimming skills would be at serious risk should they be allowed or choose to enter the water with such a large, powerful hurricane off shore. Tybee Island’s Ocean Rescue team became inactive for the season as of October 1st, so lifeguard protection will be unavailable. Therefore, only swimmers with tethered flotation devices will be allowed in the water while the rip current warning remains in effect.\nThis year’s extra rainfall has saturated the ground, so the added rain and heavy surf may lead to a high flooding potential throughout the area. Drivers who are confronted with water covering the road should turn around. Twelve inches of moving water is enough to carry a car away. A vehicle stalled in water may become irreparably damaged if the driver attempts a restart. Follow the safety guideline, “Turn around! Don’t drown!”\nThe added risk of flooding near spring or neap tides will also increase the chances that U.S. 80, or Tybee Road, may be covered near the hours of high tide. Highest high tide at Ft. Pulaski Station will be today at about noon, then somewhat lower on Saturday at 1 p.m., and lowest on Sunday, at about 2 p.m. The evening high tides are much lower than the afternoons’ and have a lower risk of flooding the road, although they could contribute to run-off problems during rain. These times will be Saturday at 12:36 a.m., Sunday at 1:35 a.m. and Monday at 2:32 a.m.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/TYBEE", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/TYBEE"], "published": "2015-10-02T09:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:56:41.007+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
