(John McCoy/Los Angeles Daily News via AP) \nNEW YORK â€” Los Angeles Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley was suspended two playoff games by Major League Baseball on Sunday night for his late takeout slide that broke New York Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada's right leg. \nUtley's agent called the penalty \"outrageous and completely unacceptable\" and said there would be an appeal. \nThe Mets and Dodgers are tied at 1-all in the NL Division Series. Game 3 is scheduled for Monday night at Citi Field. \nAn appeal would allow Utley to play until the hearing process is complete. MLB would likely try to resolve the matter Monday, before the series resumes. \nIn handing down the penalty, MLB executive Joe Torre called it an illegal slide. Umpires ruled it a legal play Saturday night. \nTorre said after a complete review, he concluded Utley's slide merited punishment. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:32:31.016+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
