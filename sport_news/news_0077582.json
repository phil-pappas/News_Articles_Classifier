Justin Verlander went on to win the Cy Young Award that year, and Max Scherzer followed suit in 2013. \nDetroit won four consecutive AL Central titles thanks in large part to its starting pitching, but the staff struggled this season as the Tigers sank to last place. \nJones remained in his role as pitching coach when manager Jim Leyland stepped down and was replaced by Brad Ausmus after the 2013 season.
