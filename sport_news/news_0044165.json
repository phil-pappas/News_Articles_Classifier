Good luck in the @mls postseason KüöÄ \n‚Äî Kevin Spacey (@KevinSpacey) October 8, 2015 \nIn perhaps one of the strangest pieces of D.C. synergy in the history of the city‚Äôs soccer scene, Netflix‚Äôs ‚ÄúHouse of Cards‚Äù star Kevin Spacey tweeted the message ‚ÄúCongrats to D.C. United on your impressive come-from-behind win to clinch a playoff spot! Good luck in the MLS postseason, K,‚Äù followed by a rocket ship emoji. Rocket = space = Spacey. \nTurns out, this little relationship developed last month, when the actor who plays Frank Underwood posed with players from the team at a charity event called Under The Lights, a gala event hosted by Spacey and Cal Ripken Jr., that supports both of their youth foundations. Thanks for coming @DCUnited ! When can we talk what Frank U's goal celebration would look like? Open to suggestions‚Ä¶ pic.twitter.com/CwrxErwpSO \n‚Äî Kevin Spacey (@KevinSpacey) September 29, 2015 \nThis is all very nice, but this could be a marketing boon. The playoffs happen right around Halloween. And with a berth secured, a House of Cards theme night ‚Äî potentially with an appearance from Spacey himself at RFK Stadium ‚Äî would draw a pretty awesome crowd.
