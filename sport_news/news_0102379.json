Doctors saw bruising and what they thought were fractures, and Cox and Carter were accused of child cruelty and neglect.\nProsecutors dropped the charges this week after experts questioned whether the child had fractures, and diagnosed rickets, vitamin D deficiency and a blood disorder that causes people to bruise easily.\nThe child — whose name and gender have not been revealed — was initially put into foster care, but while the criminal case was ongoing, a family court ruled that it should be adopted.\nCox and Carter say they plan to appeal, though legal experts say the odds are against them.\n\"We just want our child back,\" Cox told ITV news. \"We are going to appeal this adoption and we are going to fight to get our child back, every step of the way.\"\nLois Langton, a partner in the family department at London law firm Howard Kenendy, said it was \"an unbelievably tragic story\" that should never have happened.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T13:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T18:01:43.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
