I may not agree politically with some of my neighbors, however, I have to and will always respect their right to vote for whomever they wish. Perhaps the sign thief will do the same.\nBETH KINSTLER\nSavannah\nCounty’s Henderson Golf Course on a ‘death spiral’\nI have played the Henderson Golf Course on a regular basis for more than 12 years. I want to commend Gallea Golf Properties, the course manager, for doing an excellent job in maintaining and improving the greens and fairways.\nTheir crew is out on the course every workday doing the necessary trimming, mowing and cleanup. I see them daily from my house.\nWhat has not been done is the further work necessary to make the course into a first class venue. The cart paths are a mess in certain areas and potentially unsafe. Whole sections need to be completely repaved. I am confident that visitors to the course are not impressed by these cart paths. Many of the sand traps require work to make them acceptable for golfers. Bridges also need upgrades in some areas.\nI would think that Chatham County as the owning entity should take responsibility for the capital expenditures required for these infrastructure improvements.\nThe course is highlighted in the Chatham County website and should be a source of pride for the community. In its current condition, that is not the case.\nSomebody needs to step up and take ownership of this situation before the improvement costs become prohibitive and a death spiral commences.\nJOHN FITZGERALD\nSavannah\nIt’s time for the GOP to focus on the big prize\nThe deep divisions within the GOP in the U.S. House of Representatives have now worsened. The closed-door meeting of the GOP members to select their nominee for speaker fell apart when Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, the candidate for speaker, decided unexpectedly to drop out of the race. The whole election for the next speaker has now been postponed.\nThe uncertain future of the House GOP leadership is extremely worrying. The GOP cannot afford the kind of divisions we are witnessing at this crucial election season. The resignation of Speaker John Boehner, and now the exit of Kevin McCarthy, leaves the Republican Party in chaos — a situation that could have been avoided had the GOP united at least for the election of the next speaker.\nNow this important position of House Speaker is up for grabs, all because the GOP members of the House cannot for a moment put aside their differences for the good of the party and the country. Kevin McCarthy dropped out because he knew that even after getting the nomination, he did not have the 218 votes in the House to win the speakership. And this came about because a sizable group of conservative members endorsed Rep. Daniel Webster for speakership. This was like a vote of no confidence in the majority leader.\nThe GOP must put its house in order before the 2016 presidential elections to avoid a major electoral disaster. It is time for the GOP to start focusing on the big prize — winning the White House.\nLAZARUS JAWIYAMBE\nSavannah\nCongress has an historic opportunity before them\nWith a group of hard core, extremely right wing Congressmen forcing the resignation of one speaker and the withdrawal of another leading candidate for speaker, the U.S. Congress now has an historic opportunity.\nClear thinking Republicans can join with clear thinking Democrats to elect a bi-partisan speaker. This would of course give power to some Democrats, perhaps even naming some as chairs of committees, but it would allow those who are really committed to governing to elect a speaker.\nCompromise is not a dirty word.\nWe have the USA only because of the “Great Compromise.” Our country became strong and respected because those in power, up until now, always respected the rights and concerns of the minority, whomever that happened to be at the time.\nRunning roughshod over those with different opinions and “my way or the highway” are not strong principles of government. They are a roadmap to failure.\nCome on, U.S. Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Savannah, take this idea to Washington.\nTONY CENTER\nSavannah\nTybee candidate explains why he missed forum\nI want to explain why I was unable to attend the candidate forum at Tybee. Last Thursday evening a very dear friend of mine died tragically in a traffic accident on the Bull River Bridge. Susan Allen Bartoletti and her husband Chris are close friends as well as co-workers of mine at Huc A Poos on Tybee where I work part-time.\nAs soon as I found out about the accident I was at Chris’s side doing my best to help him, his mother and sister as well as Susan’s parents and brother in any way I could. I think that is the right thing to do in these circumstances. I worked with them to arrange Susan’s memorial service and continued to do my best to be there for them in any way I could.\nMy mistake was believing that I could attend Susan’s memorial on Monday and then leave for the candidate forum. I was wrong, I needed to stay to continue to support Susan’s family. Upon learning that Susan’s service would be on Monday I should have let Shirley know I would not be there. As I said I made a mistake in that regard. However, I do want to let you know that I did notify Freda Rutherford, an instrumental part of Forever Tybee and one of it’s founders, of my inability to attend via a Facebook message on Monday afternoon at 3:57 pm. This is another mistake by me for I should have notified Shirley Wright who was the organizer of the forum.\nI apologize to organizers and the citizens of Tybee for being unable to attend the candidate forum and not properly notifying any of you. That being said, I was where I needed to be and firmly believe I did the right thing.\nJOHN E.
