But Proebstle, the team's starting tight end as a senior, has told a story that could have a bearing on the future of the game he and his teammates played and love.\nIt's the tragic story of his late brother, Dick Proebstle, an MSU quarterback who lost the starting job to Steve Juday in 1963 and had to stop playing before his senior season of 1964 because of concussion-related issues — an ahead-of-their-time decision by Dr. James Feurig and then-coach Duffy Daugherty.\n\"Unintended Impact,\" released this year by Beaver's Pond Press, tells of Dick Proebstle's unraveling life as his brain erodes from the effects of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE). The family donated his brain after his 2012 death to the Boston University Alzheimer's Disease and CTE Center, which did the research that led to the NFL's 2013 concussion lawsuit settlement of $765 million with former players.\nAs Boston University professor of neurology Dr. Robert Stern writes in the book's foreword, \"very little is really known\" about CTE, which was first identified in the 1920s in boxers and called \"punch-drunk syndrome\" by some. Proebstle's book pieces together his brother's decline starting with hard shots to the head at Canton (Ohio) Central Catholic High and tells the story of a man who ultimately loses his personality and values to the disease.\nBook cover (Photo: Courtesy photo)\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nProebstle: Respect, chemistry propelled MSU's 1965 team\nThat demise included a disastrous second marriage and the loss of millions after a highly successful career in business. Once the family realized some of what was happening to Dick's brain, years of pain were seen in a different light, and Proebstle said there was catharsis for all in setting the record straight.\nThat was the first priority of the project for Proebstle, of Deer Park, Ill., who previously wrote two award-winning fiction novels and owned a management consulting firm. The second priority was to raise awareness of CTE and let people know \"that this can get pretty ugly.\"\n\"It is personal. It is a tragedy,\" Proebstle said. \"It does deal with a very contemporary topic. It certainly doesn't denigrate football — at least I didn't intend it to. I think it kind of just opens the door for what people have experienced, or know about, or think they know about, CTE.\"\nProebstle intends to remain involved in the CTE discussion, and the Dick Proebstle Scholarship Fund has been established at MSU to help finance concussion research. Unlike some involved in that discussion, Proebstle said he is \"all in\" with football and believes the sport can and should survive.\n\"Will we ever eliminate all the concussions? No, I don't think so,\" Proebstle said. \"And I don't think it's a logical way to approach life, to try to eliminate every possibility where you may be hurt. Even hurt seriously. To me, that's not a formula for living; you can't live in a bubble.\n\"But there are a lot of basic, obvious things we can take care of, around education and awareness and protocol on the sidelines. … I mean, we're smart people. We should be able to use our brains and technology to make the game safer while still preserving the qualities that make it exciting.\"\nBubba Smith, left, with Don Japinga. (Photo: Special to the Free Press)\nProebstle's book does much to convey what he loves about the game and what it did for him, starting with the teams he and his brother played on at Central Catholic for John McVay — who went on to join Daugherty's staff at MSU, later coaching the New York Giants and building the San Francisco 49ers' 1980s powerhouse teams from the front office.\nProebstle chronicles Daugherty's recruitment of the brothers and writes that his parents believed Daugherty \"understood the concept of the student-athlete\" while Ohio State's Woody Hayes \"was the antithesis of the student-athlete concept preached by my parents.\"\nJuday edged Dick Proebstle for starting quarterback in 1963 after they were co-MVPs of the spring game, and Juday wrote for the book that \"Dick's work ethic, dedication and skills caused me to work harder than I ever thought possible.\" Dick started late in the 1963 season after Juday was hurt, including a loss to Illinois for the Big Ten title.\nAfter he was encouraged to give up the game before his senior season, Dick stayed to help with the team and served as a personal coach for backup quarterback Jimmy Raye. Raye, who took over the job in 1966, wrote in his 2014 book \"Raye of Light\" with Tom Shanahan that Dick was \"an exceptional character guy and a great friend and confidant\" who was key in Raye's grasp of the position.\nDick also helped his brother, sternly telling Jim he needed to get his priorities in order and recommit to the team before his senior season. Jim did and contributed significantly to the achievements that will be celebrated this weekend.\nThat was Dick Proebstle before CTE changed him, and that's the brother Jim Proebstle wants to be remembered. He also hopes this story can help answer the chilling question asked in the book's introduction: \"How many other Dick Proebstles are there?\"\nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com. @joerexrode .
