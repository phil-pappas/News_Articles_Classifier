The senior, who was instrumental during last year's state run, buried a header on a cross from Edwin Rueda with 19 minutes left to give No. 6 seed Streamwood a win over No. 7 Larkin in a Class 3A Jacobs regional play-in game at Millennium Field in Streamwood. Keeper Daniel Dominguez needed 1 save to seal a shutout in goal. The Sabres (10-6-4), who finished fourth last year at the Class 3A state finals, will square off with No. 2 Jacobs Wednesday at 5 p.m. in the first of two semifinals. McHenry 2, Jacobs 1: The Golden Eagles (15-5, 3-2) earned at least a share of the Fox Valley Conference Valley title for the first time since 2002, but a second half Warriors goal created absolute chaos within the division to end the regular season. McHenry's win denied the Eagles an outright title and opened up a 5-way tie with CL South (back-to-back titles), McHenry, Dundee-Crown and Huntley.
