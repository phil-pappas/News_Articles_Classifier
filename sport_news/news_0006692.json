The Senators are 3-3-2 and have lost four straight at home (0-2-2) for the first time since 2006-07.\"It wears on you. Fans come and they pay their money and they want to see wins and not 4-1 losses,\" forward Bobby Ryan said. \"You can't stay in the hunt losing points at home, especially when you're on a homestand and you haven't found a way to get anything out of it.\"Senators coach Dave Cameron is at a loss to explain what ails his team.\"As a coach you look for indicators,\" Cameron said. \"You look for the practice, you look for how they're carrying themselves, you look for how they are at the meetings when you're preparing them, for signs that they're not into it. I didn't see any of that.\"Richardson broke a 1-1 tie with 5:29 left when he dove for the puck and was able to get it behind Anderson. Boedker made it 3-1 with 4:11 to go and completed the hat trick with an empty-netter with 2:01 remaining.Boedker opened the scoring with just over a minute left in the first period, slipping behind Erik Karlsson and beating Anderson to the glove side.Ceci tied it late in the second, taking a pass from Ryan and beating Lindback to the short side.The Senators played the final two periods without Curtis Lazar. Lazar went-face first into the corner boards on a hit from Zbynek Michalek in the first period. Lazar took a few more shifts, but didn't come out for the remainder of the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:37:16.814+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
