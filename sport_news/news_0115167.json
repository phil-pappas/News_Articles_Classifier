He's apparently a doctor in the off season.\nIn Game 4 of the ALDS, it looked like Houston would storm to the ALCS and the Royals season would end short of expectations and Yost's prediction would be way off its mark.\nBut then the bats came alive in the eighth inning.\n\"I just remember sitting there thinking, you know, Game 4, and we were down, you know, those runs. And I'm thinking, 'Man, somebody has to get home. Somebody has to get going. Nobody's doing anything offensively. And sure enough in the eighth inning the bats came alive,\" Yost said Wednesday. \"And from that point, we've been swinging the bats really, really well.\"\nYost said he would be aggressive in a game that could clinch the Royals a World Series berth.\n\"We're in great shape. Our bullpen is in great shape. I think (Ryan) Madson threw the most pitches that was 15. (Luke Hochevar) Hoch threw 12, (Kelvin) Herrera threw 11. We didn't even use Wade (Davis) or (Danny) Duffy. We'll go Adam full bore,\" the manager said.\nHe said he pulled catcher Salvador Perez when Herrera was coming in to pitch on Tuesday because the Royals had a big lead and he wanted to spare Perez potential pain.\n\"When he gets fouls off the mask, it comes with Herrera pitching because he throws so hard. He gets a lot of fouls straight back,\" Yost said. \"I just didn't want to take a chance of him getting hit again yesterday.\"\nYost will turn to Game 1 winner Edinson Volquez to clinch a World Series berth for the Royals.\nLast week, Volquez and Perez switched up their game plan after seeing how Volquez was pitching in the bullpen before the game.\n\"It was like, okay -- we know they've got a lot of power hitters over there. And he told me, 'Like how do you feel pitching down and away?' And I said, 'I feel sexy tonight,'\" Volquez said.\nIf he feels sexy again on Wednesday, the Royals could be playing Tuesday night at Kauffman Stadium in Game 1 of the World Series.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
