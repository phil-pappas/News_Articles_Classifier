We’re young in the secondary, and when you get those d-backs thinking, it can result in points. Their quarterback was having the game of his life. I don’t know if he threw a bad pass all night.” \nAnd, the Hurricane racked up 778 offensive yards, including 282 receiving yards and three touchdowns from junior Jonathan Adams. \n“We tried to put a safety over him with a corner underneath him,” Joyce said of Adams. “As soon as that happened, they threw it to their other go-to guy (Ke’dren Brunson, 2 TDs).” \nThe Bombers were able, however, to score 41 points against Jonesboro, the most by Mountain Home since 2012.

(Photo: Neal Denton/The Baxter Bulletin) \n“We struggled to block against Nettleton, and against Jonesboro they run a very similar defense so we just decided to read that outside linebacker and turn every play into an option-type play,” Joyce said. “It really helped us on some of our big gains there.” \nFive different players scored touchdowns for Mountain Home at Jonesboro, including quarterback Zane Walker passing for 286 yards and two touchdowns. \n“We’ve improved offensively for the past few weeks,” Joyce said, “and I feel we’ve done a good job this week of getting prepared and putting out guys in the right spots to move the ball. Our first couple drives, we have to score in the red zone. Our first two drives, we spun our wheels (against Jonesboro).” \nNorth Little Rock will throw everything but the kitchen sink at the Bombers, according to Joyce. \n“Their base formation is a double-tight ‘I’ formation,” Joyce said, “which is different for a North Little Rock team. I’m sure they’re going to take some shots downfield, but they don’t have the same opportunity Jonesboro had with those receivers last week.” \nThe Wildcats have a new coach this season in Jamie Mitchell and are in a learning phase much like the Bombers were last season. \n“They have a new coach and are adjusting to a new system, you can see it with their play,” Joyce said. “They have gotten better each week it seems with different formations, shifts and motions. They’re starting to get a better handle on it and don’t get as many procedure penalties. They’re slowly building. I feel like we have some opportunities to score some points.” \nThe Bombers still are searching to end a 23-game conference losing skid. \n“Defensively, we’re trying to throw different looks at North Little Rock,” Joyce said, “because they have so many formations and plays. If you can name a play, they have it in their playbook.” \nBombers vs. Wildcats \nWho : Mountain Home (1-3, 0-1) vs. North Little Rock (0-4, 0-1) \nWhere : Bomber Stadium, Mountain Home \nWhen : 7 p.m. Friday \nWhat to Know: Mountain Home achieved offensive balance (more than 200 yards both rushing and passing) for the second straight game last week, but fell in both of those contests. Receiver Payton Parker has at least 130 receiving yards the past two games. ... North Little Rock has advanced at least as far as the state semifinals five of the past six seasons. Charging Wildcats coach Jamie Mitchell is in his first year at the school. 29 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/sports/2015/10/01/mhhs-hosts-north-little-rock-conference-home-opener/73178934/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T17:19:11.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
