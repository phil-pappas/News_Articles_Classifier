But that wasn't the case for one of the east London club's former coaches. \nDicks told the People: \"Training is fun. Players have a laugh and a joke. I remember coming to watch training here under Avram Grant. It was a dire place. No-one was smiling or joking.\" \nCredit: HITC Sport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T13:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:26:29.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
