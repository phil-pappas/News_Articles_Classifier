The team had left a day earlier.\n\"That talk is still pending but it will still take place sometime before the end of the year,\" he added.\n\"There are a lot of things in favour of Bayern but it is clear there are most likely other good-looking brides out there other that Bayern. But at the end of the day we are optimistic that Pep Guardiola will stay at Bayern.\"\nBayern are top their Champions League group with two wins in two matches but the Spaniard has yet to emulate predecessor Jupp Heynckes who won the treble, including the Champions League in 2013.\nGuardiola, who has refused to comment on any issue related to a new deal with Bayern, is reportedly top of the wish list for several major European clubs.\n\"I know of no interest for Pep Guardiola but I am also not interested in that. We have a season to play and am optimistic he will be our coach after July 1, 2016.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:34:00.117+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
