Barrett. \nOf course, the psych major was going to sit down and talk to his QBs first. He didn’t want them finding out what was happening on TV or in the newspapers. \nMeyer could have chosen his words more carefully. Just say “we’re not going to announce anything right now” instead of “I need to analyze it,” which made it sound like he needed his head examined when Barrett was clearly the way to go based on the “sheer production” Meyer eventually cited on Tuesday. \nPoint is, Meyer handled his QBs if not the press conference the right way. When we look back over the course of the last three months, he probably massaged egos and assuaged feelings in a manner that might actually belong in a Coaching 101 manual. \nWhen Meyer was over-the-top in praising Barrett’s leadership during the summer, I thought it meant Barrett was a lock to start. In retrospect, it really meant Meyer knew Barrett could better handle being the guy on the sidelines wearing a headset. \nIt’s like retracing the scenes in a movie mystery and slapping yourself upside the head when you realize that everything leading up to this (inevitable?) conclusion now makes sense. \nDid Meyer make promises to Jones for not leaving for the NFL this past spring? He insists he did not. \nDid he fear that by handing the job back to Barrett, who started all 12 regular season games last season before getting hurt, that the pipeline from Jones’ alma mater, Cleveland Glenville, to Columbus would dry up? \nIf that were the case, Meyer wouldn’t have leapfrogged Barrett over Jones on the depth chart in an eyeblink when incumbent Braxton Miller suffered a season-ending shoulder injury days before the 2014 opener. \nDid Meyer feel a debt of gratitude to Jones for coming to the rescue during that magical post-season run? He’d only be human if he did. \nI like the theory put out there this week by ESPN college football analyst Chris Low. He suggested that Meyer probably knew Barrett was the right guy all along, but opted to start Jones and let things play out, rather than turn back to Barrett and risk Jones checking out mentally before the season even started. \nWith a back-loaded schedule, there would be plenty of time to turn back to Barrett if Jones faltered. Sticking with Jones as long as Meyer did wasn’t a huge risk, given the opposition and knowing Barrett could always be summoned. \nJones, so care-free in the 2014 postseason, knowing he was playing with house money, looked different under the weight of heavier expectations. Now for the stretch run, the Buckeyes have a fresh J.T. Barrett, so masterful in executing the read-option in tandem with Ezekiel Elliott, and a chance to pile up those style points for the College Football Playoff committee that eluded the Buckeyes much like third-down efficiency and red-zone conversions with Jones at the controls. \nMeyer knows he needs to keep Jones engaged. It won’t be easy because what “package” is the strong-armed “12 Gauge” suited for that wouldn’t tip off the defense the Buckeyes are throwing deep? \nThis is where the master psychologist needs to go back to work because at some point OSU may need Jones again, given Barrett’s injury history dating back to high school. \nJones is a well-liked goofball and shouldn’t become a distraction or divisive. The players voted Barrett, not Jones, a captain. \nIt’s finally time to let the captain steer the ship. 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1LOJhIX MORE STORIES", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:48:53.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
