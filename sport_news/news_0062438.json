There are a lot of good feelings there. \n\"But I have got to think about the three points only. We just have to concentrate on ourselves, on giving a good performance and taking a big step towards qualification for the next stage. It is an important game for everybody.\" \nNavas is a likely starter in a three-man attacking line also including Raheem Sterling and Kevin De Bruyne that will be playing behind striker Wilfried Bony. Leading striker Sergio Aguero and playmakers David Silva and Samir Nasri are injured. \nBoth sides go into the game with three points from two games, trailing group leaders Juventus by three. \nCity manager Manuel Pellegrini sees the fixture, and the return at the Estadio Ramon Sanchez Pizjuan in a fortnight, as pivotal to the group campaign. \nThe Chilean said: \"You never know because after that we have to play two more games, but at this moment I think these two games will decide which one of the sides will qualify.\" \nSevilla have not won in England in three previous visits but have strong pedigree having won the Europa League for the past two seasons. \nPellegrini said: \"No one gives them as a gift the two Europa Leagues they won. They have important players, a good manager and are a very good team.\" \nPellegrini's opposite number Unai Emery paid tribute to one of his club's favourite old boys as he arrived in Manchester for the game. \nThe 43-year-old, who has been nominated for the FIFA World Coach of the Year award and was linked with West Ham last summer, said: \"We know what Jesus Navas means to Sevilla. We are very happy for him and happy he is playing and getting game time. We know he is contributing and he is a top, top player. He is a lovely person as well.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:16:36.014+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
