After waiting in the Standard Road back-up to get into the gate, I then spent much time sitting as I waited behind several vehicles who were stopped in the middle of the parking lot traffic lane. We waited there, stopped still, until somebody came and got into a parked car and drove away. As I sat there I watched several families, very young children in tow, running across Tuolumne Road after parking in the church parking lot. Other families gave up trying to get into Standard Park parking lot and opened car doors and their kids took off from Standard Road running pell mell between parked cars and in between those of us sitting in line to get to their games on time. Most of the kids I saw were very young and very short and could not be seen until they appeared out from between two cars and were in the traffic lane. I finally made my escape only to be stopped behind a car on Standard Road who was just sitting in the road waiting for someone to come out of the park and leave so they could get a spot. Tuolumne Road with the usual daily traffic and the Casino auto and bus traffic from out of town is a fast and busy thoroughfare these days. It is also particularly wide at the Standard Park/Standard Road intersection. Are the entities — Soccer Assoc., Park and Rec Dept., County etc. — involved in this dangerous madness just waiting for a tragedy before something is done — with the inevitable lawsuit? Your kids are only wearing shin pads not armor. Judy Olson Taught to believe in kindness To the Editor: I am not calling anyone a bigot, but I know I am prejudice. We are all prejudice to some degree. Maturity shows when we are willing to defend everyone from bigotry. Even if I am prejudice toward some individual or social group, standards influence my choice of words so that I don’t say hurtful things. It is rude to say things that intentionally hurt others. I may not know I am insulting you, but if I used hurtful words why wouldn’t I choose to stop when asked? I was born in Mexico. I’m not often identified as the Mexican guy. Growing up, I witnessed bigotry as white people insulted Mexicans and Blacks. Mexicans insulted whites and Blacks. Blacks insulted whites and Mexicans. It helps to not stand out. Are we born bigots, or do cultural norms shape us? I believe bigotry is the by-product of ignorance. If you express bigotry, children will learn. My mother taught me to believe in kindness. Sometimes I forget, but when someone reminds me, I realize they too are teaching me what they believe. I would not like it if someone held a sign accusing me of being a bigot. If my mother had not taught me how to be kind, it would not mean kindness is out of fashion. In a civilized world we do not need laws to force people to be kind. All we need is to ask each other kindly and hope that is enough. Children are still learning the many lessons our parents forgot to teach us. Gavin Watkins might have children of his own someday. His behavior is recorded in our newspaper. He might be asked by his children, “Are you a bigot?” Has anyone asked him kindly if he would please leave his flag at home?
