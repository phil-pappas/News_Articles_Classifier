With more than volleyball at the heart of the match, the color pink overshadowed the red and black of New Bern’s gymnasium. The teams played a best-of-3 instead of prep volleyball’s traditional best-of-5 and New Bern swept the Falcons 2-0. Scores from the match were 25-14 and 25-22. “We came out better than we have in the recent past,” New Bern coach Heidi Griffee said. “It was a lot of fun and for a great cause and it’s encouraging that we played well going into the game with Conley tomorrow night.” Griffee said that she did not know an exact dollar amount that was raised but that she would guess around $500. All proceeds went to New Bern: Get Your Pink On. Epiphany head coach Darryl Radford echoed Griffee’s words about the cause and said he was proud of what he saw from his team. “At Epiphany, you know we want to help as much as we can with such a great cause and we really appreciate coach Heidi (Griffee) and New Bern for being a part of it with us,” he said. “I thought my girls got behind from Kjersti (Solter) hitting some bombs off the serve and then we were able to put that behind us and play better from there. It was a fun match and how volleyball should be played.” Epiphany made the Bears work for it in the second set, rallying for several points on long volleys to lead 17-15 at one point. New Bern then closed strong for the win. Solter led the way with 17 service points, six kills and nine aces. Faith Hanford delivered seven kills, while Avery Davis added eight kills. For Epiphany, Haley Radford had four kills and 11 service points.
