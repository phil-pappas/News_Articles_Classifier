But Draheim’s return last Saturday against Saskatchewan coincided with the first 100-yard rushing performance by Harris since Aug. 6, the week before Draheim was injured in Hamilton. \nTHREE THEMES \nNO BALL FOR YOU \nIn his experience as the Lions’ special teams captain, eight-year veteran Jason Arakgi can’t remember another instance when he didn’t award a game ball, given to a player who does something impressive to help win the game. The Lions did win, convincingly, but porous coverage allowed the Roughriders to rack up 305 yards in kickoff returns last Saturday. Next up is the Blue Bombers’ Troy Stoudermire, the CFL’s second leading kick returner. “It was done (no game ball) to send a message,” Arakgi explained. “We didn’t play well. And we need to play well in all three facets of the game.” \n12 ANGRY MEN \nAfter the CFL admitted one of its officials blew a call that cost the Blue Bombers a chance to beat the Calgary Stampeders (Sept. 25), Winnipeg suffered another gut-wrenching defeat on Oct. 3 against Edmonton on Sean Whyte’s 53-yard, last-play field goal. Despite a suggestion by Winnipeg Sun columnist Paul Friesen that the Blue Bombers are the “happiest 4-10 team on the planet,” equanimous head coach Mike O’Shea, pictured, insisted Friday that’s not the case. “Nobody’s happy with where they’re at. They’re angry. But that emotion is going to allow you to prepare for the next opponent.” \nKEEP THE LID ON \nLions GM Wally Buono took flak for having the BC Place Stadium roof closed last Saturday in perfect weather for fall football. “Fans come to see the stars on the field, not the stars in the sky,” Buono contends. Still, if anybody is asking, coach Jeff Tedford, pictured, prefers the shuttered look, too. He points out that the undulating roof at Investors Group Field in Winnipeg has been designed to maximize crowd noise. “I felt the environment last game (against Saskatchewan) was an advantage,” Tedford said. “I told our fans (on radio) I appreciated that. We need it again.” \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nWINNIPEG \nDefensive end \nAn NFL veteran who dressed for 56 games with five teams, the 30-year-old brother of Jabar Westerman was pursued by the Lions in free agency but chose to sign with a team willing to go all in. The CFL sacks leader with 12, Westerman joked Friday he can add more if Jon Jennings cooperates and “just stands there.” Seriously: “We can’t allow him to extend a play and throw it downfield. We have to try and do a good job of keeping him in the pocket and make the throws for him tougher, especially when he’s on the run.” \nB.C. \nTOMMIE DRAHEIM \nLeft tackle \nThe Lions are trying to downplay the fact that running back Andrew Harris’s production dipped precipitously with Draheim out of the lineup (ankle). But Draheim’s return last Saturday against Saskatchewan coincided with the first 100-yard rushing performance by Harris since Aug. 6, the week before Draheim was injured in Hamilton. “For the most part, teams were really focused on shutting me down,” Harris says. “But Tommie’s our guy. He’s our starter. It definitely makes a difference when he’s in there.” Draheim, 26, was a three-starter at San Diego State and spent time with five NFL clubs from 2012-2014. © Copyright (c) The Vancouver Sun", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T15:04:57.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
