Texas lost 50-7 to TCU after a mistake ridden first half.\n\"I felt (the players) were ready, just by the way they worked all week,\" head coach Charlie Strong said. \"I thought when the game first started off, we were going to be in good shape. We knew this was a good (TCU) team. We knew this is the No. 4 team in the country. But still, though, that should not stop us from going out and playing our best.\"\nStrong on the loss\n\"We came out today and just didn't play hard. Just simple fundamental techniques ... we're looking for more leadership. We need to do a better job of coaching and we've got to get this turned around. We have no choice.\"\nStrong on his message to the team\n\"I told them, 'we're not going to give up and we're not going to give in. We have to learn how to compete.' We don't know how to compete yet. There's something about pride - pride in yourself ... You have to know when things aren't going right, that some has to step up. That's just not what we're getting right now.\"\nRedshirt freshman quarterback Jerrod Heard on the offense\n\"There's a lot we need to get done as far as offense. But we can't get down right now.\"\nSophomore running back D'Onta Foreman on Saturday's mistakes\n\"We have to clean up or mistakes. As a team, we just got to come together and figure out why we made mistakes.\"\nSenior linebacker Peter Jinkens on the team's belief in Strong\n\"We still believe in him. He's a great coach and a great man. All we got to do is rally behind him.\"\nTCU 50, Texas 7: Complete coverage\n√Ç\nBox score\nDiscuss this and the Big 12 with Chuck Carlton on Thursday; ask questions now.\nPhotos: See the celebration as TCU dominates Longhorns\nTwitter reaction: Texas 'can't blame this one on the refs'\nFive thoughts: Longhorns blown out, QB replaced in 50-7 loss to TCU\nTexas quotable: 'We don't know how to compete'\nLonghorns freshman on Twitter during halftime with team down 37-0\nMiscues aplenty as Texas 'just didn't play hard' against TCU\nCarlton: Unbeaten Oklahoma rolls into Cotton Bowl, as Texas staggers along\nFive thoughts: TCU erupts in first quarter, beats Texas in back-to-back seasons\nTCU quotable: Boykin, Doctson reflect on record-breaking day\nCarlton: TCU shows it can rely on more than miracles in rout of Texas\nJosh Boyce congratulates Josh Doctson, his replacement as TCU's top TD catcher\nOn Twitter:\n @Nick_Castillo74", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/texas-rangers/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/carlton-unbeaten-oklahoma-rolls-cotton-bowl-astexas-staggers-along", "http://d-news.co/SYNiW", "http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510030085&home=85&vis=83&final=true", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/tcuhornedfrogs/2015/10/03/tcu-quotable-boykin-doctson-reflect-record-breaking-day-patterson-just-need-count-blessings", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/longhorns-freshman-twitter-halftime-team-37-0", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/tcuhornedfrogs/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-tcu-erupts-first-quarter-beats-texas-back-back-seasons", "https://twitter.com/Nick_Castillo74", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/twitter-reaction-texas-blame-one-refs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/texas-quotable-know-compete", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/carlton-tcu-shows-can-rely-miracles-rout-texas", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/photos-see-celebration-tcu-dominates-longhorns", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/miscues-aplenty-texas-just-play-hard-tcu", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-texas-first-quarter-woes-lead-50-7-loss-tcu", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/josh-boyce-congratulates-josh-doctson-replacement-tcus-top-td-catcher"], "published": "2015-10-04T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:42:51.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
