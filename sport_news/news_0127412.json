You come to college football trying to get on the field, and I've been out there in several different ways,\" he said. \"I think my favorite thing to do is run fake field goals or fake punts. I'm just happy to be out there.\" \nThis season, Brees is 7-of-9 on field goals while also averaging 41.1 yards per punt and 60.2 yards per kickoff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:56:02.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
