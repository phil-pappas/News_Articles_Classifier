A fourth area school, Merritt Island, received votes. \nAll four will play with district titles on the line on Friday. Palm Bay, now No. 10 in Class 5A according to the votes of Florida sports writers, will visit the Mustangs, who got 2 votes. The Pirates, winners of six in a row, received 22. The top-ranked team in the class was Plantation American Heritage, with 142 votes. \nCocoa, which will host Astronaut in a Friday game that will determine the District 5-4A champion, remained fourth this week in its class. The Tigers got 102 points and one first-place vote. Jacksonville Raines remained first, with 14 first-place votes and 157 points, while Jacksonville Bolles was No. 2. \nHeritage returned to the 6A rankings after a 28-15 win over Sebastian River on Friday. That put the Panthers a win away from the District 14-6A title, which would be decided if the now-No. 9 team wins at Jensen Beach. Heritage got 19 points. Armwood was at the top of the 6A rankings with 147 points. \nMiami Columbus was the No. 1 team again in Class 8A. The other teams ranked at the top of their classifications were 7A Dwyer, Trinity Christian of Jacksonville in 3A, 2A Jacksonville University Christian and, in 1A, Fort Meade. \nContact McCallum at 321-242-3698 or bmccallum@floridatoday.com.
