Boldt texted with Hernández often as Hernández endured a frustrating few months: Logistical problems kept him from playing in the Copa América in Chile, and he missed Mexico’s Concacaf Gold Cup triumph after fracturing his collarbone in an exhibition just before the tournament. United Coach Louis van Gaal began the preseason intending to use Hernández in a substitute role similar to one he had played in recent years — news that depressed Boldt and Leverkusen — but a few days before the transfer deadline, everything changed.

Credit Jerome Miron/USA Today Sports, via Reuters On Aug. 26, Hernández badly missed a penalty kick in Manchester United’s victory over Club Brugge in a Champions League match; television cameras caught van Gaal looking incredulously at an assistant coach after the attempt, which went wide right after Hernández appeared to slip as he made contact with the ball. Days later, Hernández said, he had a meeting with van Gaal in which the coach informed him that he would be a backup player for the team during the season and that he was free to pursue a transfer. Then, on Aug. 30, word spread that Manchester United was trying to acquire the teenage striker Anthony Martial, which would push Hernández even further down van Gaal’s pecking order. Bayer Leverkusen had stayed in touch with Hernandez and his agent throughout the summer and had just pocketed 22 million pounds (roughly $33.5 million) by selling the rights to the South Korean forward Son Heung-min to Tottenham Hotspur. Leverkusen sensed an opportunity. On Aug. 31, after hurried negotiations, Hernández arrived in Germany for a physical exam and the completion of his move. “All of it — the missed penalty, the look on the manager’s face, our sale of Son to free up some money — all of it needed to happen just that way for this to work,” Boldt said. “That’s football sometimes. It’s crazy.” Continue reading the main story Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week. Hernández laughed. “This club, it’s hungry — it is a club people know, but it wants to be bigger; it wants to prove more,” he said. “Like me.” Settling in will take some time. Hernández is searching for a house in Cologne or Düsseldorf, cities that are nearby. He is adapting to the pace of a new league. And he has a translator whispering in his ear in the locker room while Coach Roger Schmidt talks tactics in German. All of it is an adventure for Hernández, who said he hoped that his quick comfort in his new home would carry over to his international play. While the American midfielder Michael Bradley used the word “hate” in an Instagram post last week about the rivalry between the United States and Mexico, Hernández said that emotion was too strong for him. Still, he acknowledged that games like Saturday’s came with a different emotional level. He said he expected the crowd at the Rose Bowl to favor Mexico. While American fans are vociferous, he said, nothing quite compares to Mexicans who are living in the United States. “For the most part, I think, the Mexicans in America have had hard lives, have pushed so hard to reach America that when they have a chance to celebrate the Mexican national team, it is like for a day, they are back in their country,” he said. “For Americans, they are growing up as soccer fans. Soccer is still kind of a new sport for them. There are so many other sports, too, and it’s improving. But to Mexicans, it’s all there is. Soccer is everything.” That devotion, Hernández said, is part of what motivates him to seize the opportunity he has been given at Leverkusen. He did not want to come back to North America to play in M.L.S. or the Mexican league, where he began his career. He did not want to give up on his dream yet. Despite the uncertainty of the past few years, Hernández, 27, believes he can be a top player in Europe. He believes he can thrive. And in Germany, he believes he has finally found the place where it can happen. Correction: October 9, 2015 An earlier version of this article misspelled the surname of a Manchester United player.
