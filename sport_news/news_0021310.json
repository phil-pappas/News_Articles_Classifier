Solis/AP South Carolina's head coach Steve Spurrier announced his immediate retirement on Monday. The ever-quotable and master trash talker Steve Spurrier has oft been asked at media days about his expected date for retirement, and that time has finally and unexpectedly arrived.\nNow 70 years old, the South Carolina coach informed his players of his decision Monday night , in the middle of a disappointing 0-4 SEC start this season.\nIt is unclear why Spurrier chose the middle of his 11th season with the Gamecocks to announce his retirement, but apparently the man who said he \"didn't want to coach too far\" into his 60s is ready to call it quits — even if he went a little longer than he predicted.\nIn honor of the future Hall of Fame coach's retirement, here are some of his most memorable Quote: s.\nOn staying in the game:\n\"People ask, 'Why are you still coaching?' I forgot to get fired and I'm not going to cheat.\"\nButch Dill/AP The 70-year-old future Hall of Fame coach is famous for his clever quips during media days. \"The Pope is 77 years old and he's in charge of a billion people. All I have to do is put 11 on the field.\"\nOn retirement:\n\"That retirement thing, I don't think I'd be very good at it. I can go to the beach, stay four or five days and then, 'Hey, let's get on out of here. We've been here long enough.'\"\nOn Tennessee's lack of Sugar Bowl appearances while he coached at Florida:\n\"You can't spell Citrus without U-T.\"\nA dig at Florida State's expense:\n\"You know what FSU stands for, don't you? Free Shoes University.\"\nAfter a fire in the Auburn library destroyed 20 books:\n\"The real tragedy was that 15 hadn't been colored yet.\"\nOn his 2006 offensive line:\n\"Well, we can't trade 'em. So I guess we have to coach 'em.\"\nOn old adages:\n\"The guy who said defense wins championships hasn't watched us a lot.\"\nJohn Raoux/AP Spurrier was in the middle of his 11th season with the Gamecocks, who are currently 0-4 in SEC play. On Biblical Redemption:\n\"I'm probably more of an Old Testament guy. You spear our guy in the earhole, we think we're supposed to spear you in the earhole.\"\nTo one of his players, Danny Wuerffel, after an interception:\n\"Danny, it's not your fault...It's my fault for putting you in the game.\"\nLove for the media:\n\"A lot of familiar faces out there. I would've figured a bunch of you guys would have retired by now.\"\nAsked how he kept his sanity for 26 years as head coach, he replied: \"Same way you sportswriters do it, I think.\"\nschiusano@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Steve Spurrier quits, takes blame for South Carolina’s slide South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier announces retirement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:52:17.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
