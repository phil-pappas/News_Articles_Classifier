Odds of a Manchester City victory are placed at 7/4, with a draw at 12/5. Most of the major sports books have this cracker of a match lined up the same way. \nI’m sure the absence of City scoring sensation Sergio Aguero has a lot to do with this. \nRegardless of what Oddsmakers says, Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal sees his side as the underdog. \n“It is not so important who is the favorite. When you look at the facts, they are first. We are second or third, there is goal difference and points difference. They are the favorites I think,” the Dutchman said. \n“We have one day less [to prepare after Moscow flight] but we have to do it and that’s what we’re doing. We hope we can beat City.” \nVan Gaal said he is relaxed ahead of the match on Sunday, despite this being one of the most hyped up Manchester Derbies in recent memory. \n“For me it’s not any issue because I have to do my work,” he said. \n“You have to work more rationally and not emotionally. I think for the fans it’s very emotional. Of course, we hope that we can beat Manchester City.” Paul M.
