I remember it being quite tight off the tee so, while it's quite short and therefore score-able, you've got to drive the ball well to go low there.\" \n\nOutside of the British Open and the BMW PGA Championship, fans have had little top-notch golf to watch in England in recent years and Westwood believes they will flock to the venue that is situated 50 miles north of London. \n\n\"I'm sure we'll get some decent crowds supporting the British players,\" said the world number 44 who has amassed 23 European Tour wins in his career. \n\n\"British golfers have enjoyed a lot of success in recent years so it's great that we can stage another tournament in England to share that success with the fans.\" \n\nThe event starts on Thursday and is hosted by Woburn professional and world number 42 Ian Poulter. \n\nThe British Masters will be hosted by Westwood, who had two spells at the top of the world rankings in 2010 and 2011, and fellow Englishmen Justin Rose and Luke Donald in future years.
