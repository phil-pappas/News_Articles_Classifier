I about lost it.”\n“I have covered male sporting events all over the world and it took coming to Indianapolis to face my first gender discrimination,” he added.\nPublic relations staffs from both the Colts and the Jaguars apologized to the women.\nColts spokesman Avis Roper said the usher was in an area where he didn’t know who was allowed access.\nThe Association for Women in Sports Media says it’s unfortunate that such issues continue to exist.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Yahoo_Graham", "https://twitter.com/Joey_TNews/statuses/650785221349142528", "https://twitter.com/Joey_TNews/status/650785221349142528"], "published": "2015-10-05T12:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:10:56.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
