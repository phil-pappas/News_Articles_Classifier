Maggie Beck / Union Democrat, copyright 2015 The Mother Lode and the rest of drought-stricken California desperately need rain, but geologists, hydrologists, foresters and other specialists who study post-fire erosion and debris flows know that too much rain on incinerated watersheds can unload forces as deadly and destructive as any fire. \nLight rains that started Wednesday night and continued into Thursday were ideal, according to people overseeing fire containment, hazardous debris removal and erosion control efforts in the 110-square-mile Butte Fire burn zone. \n“It’s good, because it dampens down the dust and raises the humidity a little bit,” Chief David Switzer of Mokelumne Hill Fire Protection District said. “But the concern is we’re going to get a double whammy, a horrendous fire followed by a wet El Niño winter. Out on Jesus Maria Road, it’s burned down to mineral soil.” \nDean Peterson, who heads Butte Fire debris removal operations and hopes to have all burned properties cleaned by Jan. 1, said gentle rains are exactly what he and his crews need to work safely. Hazardous materials assessments began Wednesday in Jesus Maria. \n“It’s not a downpour that’s going to move hazardous materials into creeks and streams. It consolidates the ash and debris and keeps it from drifting in the air. Right now this is a godsend,” Peterson said. \nScientists who study post-fire erosion say rainfall intensities approaching a half-inch an hour can be a concern on severely burned watersheds. \nBurn area emergency response teams are expected to assess the entire Butte Fire burn in coming weeks to determine the level of threat to specific neighborhoods, roads and infrastructure. \nScientists with the U.S. Geological Survey, the NRCS and other agencies are aware of one of the most deadly post-fire flash floods in California: Christmas Day 2003 in the Old Fire burn in San Bernardino County. \nThe Old and Grand Prix fires burned more than 140 square miles, much of it steep mountain front in the San Gabriel and San Bernardino ranges above the city of San Bernardino. The blaze resulted in six deaths and destroyed 1,003 homes. \nThe USGS produced watershed burn severity maps before the fires were extinguished. Local, state and federal agencies warned people of the impending threat that loomed above them in burned-off drainages aimed at their neighborhoods. \nOn Dec. 25, 2003, heavy rains on slopes north of San Bernardino unleashed deadly debris avalanches and flows in Waterman Canyon and Cable Canyon, killing 16 people, including nine children. \nThe USGS also cites post-fire debris flows on Feb. 6, 2010, below the 2009 Station Fire burn in Los Angeles County, where heavy rains unleashed flows that overtopped sediment-retention basins and damaged or destroyed 46 homes in La Cañada Flintridge.
