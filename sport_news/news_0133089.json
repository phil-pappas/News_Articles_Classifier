(Photo by Greg Macafee) Greg MacAfee Reporter COTTONWOOD- It was a night of excitement, reminiscing on old times and rain as Richard Williams and Golden Cobra Center of Fitness brought an end to a legacy in the Verde Valley. As Richard Williams is moving on to the next level, chasing his dream, he promoted his last fight with the New York Style Throwdown III at Vinnie's New York Chef's Pizzeria in Cottonwood. The fight card included two main event title match belts that did not disappoint with the four fighters battling the conditions in the rain to see who was going to come out on top. The fight card also included six fighters from the Verde Valley showcasing their cases, along with two fighters from Larson's Boxing and Fitness gym in Camp Verde putting on a Muay Thai showcase demo. The first match of the night was a boxing demo between Manuel Robinson from Dragon's Eye Muay Thai in Cottonwood and Gino Medivil from Justo's Gym in Tempe. The two boxers went three, two minute rounds. A flurry of punches were thrown by both boxers, and both rewarded a trophy for their demo. The real fighting got started when Myduen Tran from 2 Knuckle Sports MMA in Surprise took on Maddelynn Gevkink from Sitan Gym in Chandler. The fight lasted three two-minute rounds. Both contenders battled furiously never giving up. Both fighters used a combination of kicks and punches. Ultimately in the end it was Gevkink who got the final word winning by unanimous decision in front of what seemed like a home town crowd for her. In the second bout of the night two Verde Valley fighters squared off against each other. Matt Soto from Golden Cobra Center of Fitness took on Angel Gonzales of Dragon's Eye Muay Thai in Cottonwood. Gonzales ended up walking out of the ring victorious after putting on an impressive display of punches, kicks and knees. The Verde Valley fighters were on display again in the third judged fight of the night. Jacqueline Montijo of Larson's Boxing and Fitness took on Nikki Cordova of 2 Knuckle Sports MMA. It was a battle between the two fighters, as both had their moments throughout the fight. By the end of the second round Montijo was bleeding from the nose. The strong willed contender out of the Camp Verde gym never stopped. On numerous occasions Montijo had Cordova pinned against the ropes, throwing a furry of alternating kicks to her ribs. Cordova flipped the script on her a couple times and threw a multitude of punches that resulted in blood dripping from Montijo's nose. Ultimately Montijo came out on top for the victory and the second Verde Valley Victory of the night, winning by unanimous decision. After a brief intermission in which the Cottonwood City Mayor spoke highly of Richard Williams and Golden Cobra Center of Fitness, the fights continued. Chris Hardeen of Team Gladiators in Flagstaff took on Besmik Gashi from Kicker's MMA in Phoenix. It was a hard fought battle from both contenders. Gashi threw a barrage of kicks to Hardeen's legs, and both fighters went back and forth through three two-minute rounds. Gashi came out victorious. Michael Garcia from Larson's Gym turned in the only knockout of the night when he landed a kick to the face of his opponent Jose Sanchez from Team Gladiators in the third round. It was a back and forth battle of kicks and punches thrown by both fighters until it seemed like Sanchez was losing stamina. Garcia then ended the fight and the event doctor was called to the ring as Garcia walked out victorious. Before the next fight could begin, the skies opened up and the rain started coming down as some fans ran for cover Nicholas Salantri of Golden Cobra and Miles Mansell of Xayaveth Muay Thai Gym stepped into the ring and put on the gloves. The semi-main event was a battle for the Amateur Muay Thai Arizona State Middleweight Title, and the two fighters did not disappoint. Salantri came out with a flurry of punches only to be countered by kicks thrown by Mansell. Throughout the five round matchup the fighters locked up multiple times throwing elbows and knees to each other's ribs. Mansell came out victorious in the end as he took the title back to Avondale. In the Main Event, two 12-year olds were fighting for the Junior Amateur Muay Thai United States Cruiserweight Title. Corey Hines of MMA lab in Glendale took on Ray Allen Jr. of Ali Alhalabi in Houston, Texas. Even though both fighters are still young students of the game they showed why they deserved the main event fight. Slipping more than Mansell and Salantri in the fight before them, Hines and Allen both landed a significant amount of punches and kicks in the five one and a half minute rounds. Allen landed a surprising spinning kick in round four, and Hines landed punches and kicks throughout the fight. The traveler from Houston was victorious in the end as he made the journey worth it taking home the Junior Amateur Muay Thai United States Cruiserweight Title.-- Follow Greg Macafee on Twitter @greg_macafee and Instagram @VerdeValleyNews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:36:28.769+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
