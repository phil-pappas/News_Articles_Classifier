Aurora The hype of Senior Night was not enough to propel the Aurora offense on Friday night, as the Houn’ Dawgs fell to four-time defending state champion Lamar by a score of 41-0. The Houn’ Dawgs produced fewer than 150 yards of total offense on the night, gaining just 29 on the ground and 110 through the air. The loss was Aurora’s fourth on the year, giving the Houn’ Dawgs an even 4-4 record with one final game before district play. Aurora will face East Newton on the road in Week 9. Marionville In a battle of unbeaten, top-ranked teams in the MidLakes Conference, the Comets came up a little short on the road at Skyline, falling by a score of 58-37. The defeat was the first suffered by Marionville on the year, as the Comets have rolled over almost every opponent thus far, but Skyline’s adjustment from a pass-heavy offense to a run-centered one was too much. The Comets scored the first touchdown of the game, but Skyline responded quickly, taking a 7-6 lead. Marionville would recover said lead on a touchdown pass from Jacob LaSalle to Rane Bateman, but again Skyline erased the deficit, and the Comets never found the advantage again. The loss gave the Comets a 7-1 record heading into the last regular season game. They will face Stockton at home.
