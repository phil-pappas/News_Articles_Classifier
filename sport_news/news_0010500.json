Comment Follow @@LDLDanielGreen Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 1:00 PM For the first game and at least 85 percent of the second set, the Leesville Lady Cats were completely out of sorts. Then something changed. Leesville (19-8, 1-1) put together a huge run to win the second game, propelling the Lady Cats to a four-set victory over the Vinton Lady Lions on Tuesday afternoon in district play, 18-25, 26-24, 25-21, 25-17. Vinton (9-12, 0-3) dominated the first half of the first set, building a huge 9-3 lead before Emily Moore and Kiera Jackson combined for six aces to tie things up at 13-13. However, the Lady Lions were able to get a couple of aces and kills to reclaim a five-point lead at 21-16. Leesville was able to stay within five points for the next few volleys, but eventually, Vinton claimed the win in the first game, 25-18. After a Breâ€™Zhanna Eddington kill and Alizai Walker block, Leesville tied the second game with Vinton at 3-3 and again at 4-4. However, it looked as if the Lady Cats were going to fall behind by two sets as Vinton continued to pound kill after kill en route to a 23-17 lead. But Walker secured a kill, while Jackson got another ace and Eddington another kill, cutting the deficit to 23-21. A Leesville hitting error gave Vinton the advantage at 24-21, but the Lady Cats were able to recover, scoring the final five points of the game, three of which came on an ace and two kills by Eddington, allowing Leesville to tie things up at a set apiece. The momentum shift proved to be huge as the Lady Cats scored eight of the first nine points in the third set. Tyana Ellis drilled a pair of kills, while Iris McNeely picked up an ace as Leesville continued to maintain a seven-point lead midway through the set. The Lady Lions refused to go away and cut the deficit to 20-19 on an ace. But a couple of hitting errors allowed Leesville to go back up by three points and Eddington secured the third-set win with a kill and block to push the Lady Cats to a 25-21 win. Vinton jumped out to an early lead during the fourth set, but once again, the duo of Eddington and Ellis proved to be too much for the Lady Lions. The Lady Cats took the lead for good at 9-8 and never looked back in earning the win. Eddington had a season-high 16 kills in the victory, while also collecting three aces, two blocks and two assists. Moore had three aces and 13 assists, while Ellis was good for four kills and nine assists. Jackson added six aces in the win. The Lady Cats faced the Westlake Lady Rams on Thursday and will be back at home on Tuesday for another district game with DeQuincy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:13:55.183+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
