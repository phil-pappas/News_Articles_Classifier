Cincinnati, which also opened the 1988 and '75 seasons 6-0, is off until playing at Pittsburgh on Nov. 1. \nHere's a number of things that stood out: \nSPREADING THE BALL: With the Bills focusing their coverage on receiver A.J. Green, Dalton turned his attention his other offensive threats, including Marvin Jones, who had a career-best nine catches for 95 yards, including a 10-yard touchdown. Tight end Tyler Eifert and running back Jeremy Hill also scored touchdowns receiving, while Giovani Bernard scored on a 17-yard run. \n\"We have a different swagger,\" said Green, who had no problem being limited to four catches for 36 yards. \nMANUEL TRANSITION: The Bills' offense sputtered after Manuel capped the game-opening drive with a 2-yard touchdown run. On its next four possessions, Buffalo combined for 7 yards and 0 first downs. \nMaking his first start in over a year, Manuel finished 28 of 42 for 263 yards with a touchdown and interception on a poorly underthrown pass directed at Chris Hogan that was picked off by Darqueze Dennard. \nIt was the second-most yards passing for Manuel, though 126 came on Buffalo's final two drives. \nFIELD POSITION: Penalties, sloppy special team play and Manuel's interception allowed the Bengals to enjoy an average drive start of midfield in the first half. \nThe Bengals, however, were limited to scoring just 17 points despite having three first-half possessions begin in Buffalo territory. \nThe Bills were flagged eight times for 93 yards. That included a taunting call against cornerback Ron Brooks on a punt return, allowing the Bengals to start at Buffalo's 49 and led to their first touchdown. Buffalo entered the game with an NFL-leading 54 penalties for 490 yards. \n\"Still too many penalties, dumb penalties,\" Bills coach Rex Ryan said. \nMCCOY ON THE RUN: LeSean McCoy had 17 carries for a season-best 90 yards, including a 4-yard touchdown, in his first game after missing two with a pulled left hamstring. With a 10-yard run in the third quarter, McCoy became the NFL's 61st player to surpass the 7,000-yard plateau. \nBY THE SACKFUL: Bengals defensive end Carlos Dunlap had 1 1/2 sacks to up his team-leading total to 6 1/2. Cincinnati now has 17 this season — three short of matching last year's total. \nThe Bills were held without a sack for just the second time in their past 35 games. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T08:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:09:19.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
