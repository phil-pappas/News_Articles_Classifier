He's earned that.\" \nThe 10-time All Star managed to produce a fast ball, slider and change-up against the five Phillies batters he faced and surrendered two doubles. He did not record a strikeout or walk. \n\"I think a lot of position players, sometimes say stuff about pitchers, 'why or you doing this or that?'\" Ichiro said. \n\"I can't say it was fun but I'll never talk bad about a pitcher again. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T08:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:39:37.090+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
