Anaheim acquired the veteran defenseman from Vancouver last summer after he played 10 years with the Canucks, who drafted him in 2001. Bieksa was reunited with Ryan Kesler, the longtime Vancouver forward who moved to Anaheim before last season. \nVancouver improved to 2-0 on the road by winning the new season's first meeting between the Pacific Division's top two teams last year. Anaheim won its third straight division title, while Vancouver finished a surprising second before losing in the playoffs' opening round. \nAnaheim was shut out in San Jose last Saturday in its opener before returning to Honda Center for its first real game on home ice since Game 7 of the Western Conference finals, when Chicago advanced to win the Stanley Cup. The Ducks have lost a Game 7 at home in three straight seasons, but they enter this season among the championship favorites after advancing an extra round into the postseason every year. \nBoth teams opened at a furious pace, with end-to-end chances throughout. After a scoreless first period, Vatanen got the Ducks' first goal of the season when his long, low shot went through Mike Santorelli's screen. \nCracknell evened it later in the period with a sharp-angled shot that somehow deflected off Andersen's shoulder and landed behind the goalie. The journeyman got his first regular-season NHL goal since April 4, 2013, and just the seventh of his 85-game NHL career. \nNeither team had many chances in the scoreless third, although Miller used his mask to stop a late redirection by Carl Hagelin. \nNOTES: A small group of vocal protesters gathered outside Honda Center to call for the suspension of Ducks D Clayton Stoner, who faces charges in Canada related to a 2013 grizzly bear hunt in Canada. ... Cracknell hadn't scored a goal in his last 49 regular-season games, although he got a postseason goal in 2014 for St. Louis. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:09:31.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
