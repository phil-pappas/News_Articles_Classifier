This collaboration reflects ICC’s commitment to the Spirit of Cricket, which is to use the popularity of the sport for social good. For UNICEF, the International Cricket Council is a powerful ally given its reach in the international cricket community across the globe. This partnership provides UNICEF a critical platform to reach millions of children, adolescents and their families and positively impact their lives. ICC Chief Executive, David Richardson said: “Investing in initiatives that will improve the health, education, nutrition, protection and sanitation of children is so important to the lives of us all and we are proud to work with UNICEF in bringing these projects to life. ICC and UNICEF together will engage the broader cricketing community in work to empower children and adolescents and will, in particular, during the many ICC Events over the next five years, develop and implement various community outreach programmes and initiatives in collaboration with coaches, cricketers and cricketing personalities.” UNICEF believes in incorporating the power and potential of sport into country programmes across the world to promote the healthy development of children and teach important life lessons such as respect, leadership, cooperation and equality. Major ICC events also provide opportunities to raise awareness on a range of socio-economic issues and support initiatives for children’s rights and wellbeing. “UNICEF is delighted to unite with ICC to improve the lives of children. Through this partnership we aim to change the lives of millions of children across the globe. This will support us in our quest to create a world fit for all children” said Tony Lake, UNICEF Executive Director. UNICEF brings extensive field presence and experience in improving children’s lives. It partners with civil society groups and community-based organisations that deliver services for children. About UNICEF UNICEF promotes the rights and wellbeing of every child, in everything we do. Together with our partners, we work in 190 countries and territories to translate that commitment into practical action, focusing special effort on reaching the most vulnerable and excluded children, to the benefit of all children, everywhere.
