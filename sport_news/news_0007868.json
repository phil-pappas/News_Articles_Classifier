Greenbrier and Harrison are both 4-4, 3-2, with two games left. \nIf Greenbrier’s first drive was a sign of how the game would go, it was clear the Panthers would have a struggle. \nGreenbrier’s defense was able to hold the Goblins’ run game, forcing Harrison to end their first drive with a punt. A dropped fair catch from Carter Burcham put the ball right back into Harrison’s hands at the Panthers’ 43 leading to a touchdown. \nThe Panthers had an opportunity for a touchdown when Harold Ross connected with Brandon Thomas midfield or a 76-yard touchdown pass, but an unsportsmanlike penalty at Harrison’s 40 wiped the points off the board. \nGreenbrier ended the third quarter with a fourth-down turnover with an incomplete pass from Burcham. A 70-yard interception return by Kanon Kirkland put the mercy rule in effect the fourth quarter as the Goblins took a 35-0 lead. \nNoah Ditmanson rushed for 150 yards and a touchdown for Harrison. \nNext week, Greenbrier will travel to Clarksville before closing out the regular season at Vilonia.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:54:13.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
