MVP Bailey Peach, Dartmouth Played a good all-around match for the Indians in a 25-23, 25-18, 26-24 volleyball win at New Bedford on Friday. Finished with 15 kills, 15 service points, 11 digs and six aces for Dartmouth (11-1, 1-1 Old Colony League), which completed its first regular-season sweep over the Whalers in the five years that Rachel Lassey has been coaching the team. QUOTABLE “I believe this will be a momentum game for us. They got their feet wet. They’re really playing hard, but they know how it feels now (to score goals). I don’t think they’re going to give up.”--Wareham field hockey coach Suzanne Modlowski, after her team scored twice in a 2-2 tie with Case. The 0-9-1 Vikings had scored just one goal in the nine games prior, and it came all the way back in the season opener.
