After JMU went up 24-17 on their first overtime possession, Maine answered back with a touchdown of their own and sent on the PAT team. But then they shifted into that offset formation the Colts tried against the Patriots.\nMaine’s backup quarterback Chris Treister explained to the Bangor Daily News how the play worked:\nFor the conversion, the Bears lined up in a formation that had snapper [Justin] Perillo and Treister, in the “shotgun,” alone in the middle of the field, kicker Brian Harvey and Troy Eastman wide right and the other seven players bunched up on the left side.\n“I have the option to shift (the players) and just kick it, to have it snapped over to Pushaun (Brown) and run ‘outside zone,’ or I could run a sprintout to the right and have a run-pass option,” Treister explained. “I chose the latter and had to win the game on that one.”\nThe play ended with Treister diving into the end zone over two defenders.\nThe Colts used the formation Sunday night in their 34-27 loss to the Patriots. The primary intent, according to coach Chuck Pagano , was to catch the New England defense with too many players on the field, with the option to run a play if they got “a certain look.”\nThey did not get that look .\nThe Colts tried a unique formation on 4th down. It didn't work. #NEvsIND http://t.co/Eh0HXpFV00\n— NFL (@NFL) October 19, 2015 Back in 2011, Maine made SportsCenter for correctly running the trick play. We will certainly continue to see the Colts’ attempt on ESPN too, albeit for different reasons .\nSigns of Deflategate in Indianapolis on Sunday night\nPrevious -- of -- Next Indianapolis Mayor Greg Ballard looks at a sign at the entrance to the New England Patriots tunnel before their game against the Colts.
