Filed:   23:16   23:16 UK \nStoke City right-back Glen Johnson has reminded England boss Roy Hodgson that he has not hung up his boots at international level just yet. \nThe 31-year-old has not made an appearance for the Three Lions in over a year, but Johnson concedes that he still finds it odd to have free time during international breaks. \nNevertheless, the former Liverpool and Chelsea defender, who has 54 caps under his belt, is adamant that he is too young to rule himself out of contention for a recall. \n\"Am I still available? Of course,\" he told The Mirror . \"I've done more than most in my era for England, I'm more than happy with what I've done. \n\"The time off we get in the international break is something new to me. I've got young kids and normally when the lads get time off you are in hotels and things, and you never kind of get it. Now, with the days off, it's been great to spend time with the kids. \n\"So for every negative there's a positive. But I have not retired [from international football], and I am not going to. I'm too young.\" \nEngland qualified for Euro 2016 by winning all 10 of their qualifiers. Enter your email address to subscribe to Sports Mole 's free match previews newsletter!
