He’s going to be up against players that are equally as fast, equally as good, equally as strong, and equally as smart. Finding a way to be successful at this level, will come to him, but there will be a little bit of growing pains along the way.”\nMcDavid went into Thursday’s game with four assists in the preseason and a handful of near misses. He’s been as advertised so far, looking dominant at times playing on a line with Taylor Hall.\n“Great players possess a great skill-set all across the board. The four fundamentals you have to master in hockey are skating, shooting, passing and puck handling,” Messier said. “Those are four basic skills that every hockey player has to work on from the time they start the game, and he obviously does that very well, and you could see (Thursday) morning and in the games.\n“The experience that comes along with that is critical, being able to think the game and see the game differently and slow the game down is a critical component to it. We’ve seen all the best players do it, all the way back since we were watching hockey in the ’60s and through the ’70s. Great players have a way to find open ice, they have the ability to do great things at great moments. Connor is no different then all the other players that have come before him and like a lot of other players that are already on the team — great players like (Jordan) Eberle in scoring big goals and Hall, winning championships in junior and the list goes on.”\nWinning the NHL Draft Lottery in April and earning the right to select McDavid, changed the entire Oilers organization.\nWith a new general manger and a new head coach there is optimism the team will be able to climb out of the Western Conference basement where they’ve lingered since getting to Game 7 of the 2006 Stanley Cup final.\n“I think there is definitely a distinct feeling coming into this year then there has been in the past, there is no question,” Messier said. “There’s been a lot of change in the organization. With Connor coming in, he’ll complement all the other players that are already here and are getting well-established into the league.”\nMessier also believes the Oilers have the perfect coach to help get them out of the basemen in Todd McLellan.\nMcLellan is the Oilers’ sixth coach in the past six seasons, but is expected to stick around longer than Pat Quinn, Tom Renney, Ralph Krueger, Dallas Eakins and Todd Nelson did.\n“I have a tremendous respect for all coaches and especially coaches that have done it and done it well in one place,” Messier said. “Todd comes in here with the resumé that the players can look at and see that he’s been through a lot and he’s coached a lot of great players and has credibility. How he establishes the relationships with the players and with every player will ultimately determine the success, just like any other coach on any other team.\n“So far, watching the practice (Thursday) morning, there is definitely a renewed sense of optimism that you can physically feel watching the players from the stands.”\nderek.vandiest@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/SUNdvandiest\nFormer Oilers star Mark Messier says Connor McDavid has the qualities common to great players\nBy Derek Van Diest , Edmonton Sun First posted: Thursday, October 01, 2015 08:14 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 01, 2015 11:46 PM EDT\nMark Messier spent time with Connor McDavid this summer, shooting the Rogers Communication commercials together.\nYet, the former Edmonton Oilers great had never seen the future star play live prior to Thursday’s preseason contest against the Vancouver Canucks.\nMessier was anxious to see first-hand the buzz concerning McDavid, although he expects the No. 1 selection in this summer’s NHL Entry Draft to make a smooth transition into the league.\n“Meeting Connor this summer and shooting the commercials together, I got to see what a great young man he is and I know he’s excited to get the season started,” Messier said following the Oilers morning skate. “His off-ice demeanor, his work ethic, his commitment, all the things that make great players great, he obviously has, but there is going to be a learning curve, there is no question.
