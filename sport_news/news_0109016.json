With that being said, we’ve just got to step up and make plays.\" \nSo now the Giants have to figure out how to get Beckham involved despite defenses paying extra attention to the wide receiver. Although Beckham draws away defenders, creating space and opportunities for other receivers, he still wants the ball in his hands, and the Giants want to see that just as much. \nStill, they’re not going to force the ball into double coverage and risk turnovers. \n\"We have other people that if the coverage is strictly dealing with [No.] 13, then people have to be able to come through for us,\" coach Tom Coughlin said. \"That’s what we’re counting on.\" \nOne thing that’s become a trend is that Beckham is seeing far fewer targets from quarterback Eli Manning in the second half. \nIn Monday’s 27-7 loss to the Eagles, Beckham finished with seven catches for 61 yards. Manning targeted him seven times in the first half, and only once in the second. \nOffensive coordinator Ben McAdoo said the Eagles played more two-deep coverage, which affected Manning’s ability to throw in Beckham’s direction. \n\"We’re not going to go in and say we want to target him a certain amount of times each game,\" McAdoo said. \"Although we definitely don’t want him to disappear in the second half, and that’s not a fault of his own, that’s no fault of Eli’s.\" \nThe only game where Manning targeted Beckham more in the second half was Week 1 in Dallas, when he had five receptions for 44 yards. Beckham finished with eight targets, six of them coming after halftime. \nIn the following week’s game against the Falcons, Beckham was targeted 10 times in the first half, and just twice in the second. \n\"Teams are going to have plays during the game when they’re going to double-team him and try to take him away and that’s fine,\" Manning said. \"But other guys have to make plays.\" \nBeckham drew away coverage Monday night against the Eagles, but the rest of the Giants’ receivers failed to execute their chances. \n\"They’re going to watch Odell because he’s that type of guy, he’s that type of threat,\" tight end Larry Donnell said. \"So other guys have to step up and be ready to make plays when their number is called so we have a chance to win the football game.\" \nRegardless, the Giants just want to make sure Beckham, who has four touchdowns, is on the field Sunday against the Cowboys. \nThe receiver continues to be bothered by his hamstring, though he expects to practice Saturday and be ready to play Sunday. \nCoughlin said he’ll tolerate not having Beckham as a full-practice participant during the week if it means he’ll be ready for the game. \nAnd once the game starts, the Giants would like to get Beckham more involved. \n\"We want to target Odell as much as possible,\" McAdoo said. \"He’s a playmaker, a heck of a player in this league.\" \nEmail: iseman@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T19:58:54.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
