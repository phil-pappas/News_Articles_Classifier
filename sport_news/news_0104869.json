Perhaps there is something to hearing them aloud, or maybe it adds some accountability. \nWhatever it is, Carlos Dunlap put it out in the ether last summer that he was shooting for the NFL single season sack record, a full 23, in 2015. \nFive games into the season, he smiles at that now. He’s on pace for 16 – which would be a career high and a Bengals franchise record – but it’s not so much about the number. It was about what it represented. \nDunlap is in his sixth year in the NFL, and is closing in on his 27th birthday. Part of it is the natural evolution of a man, and a football player. Part of it was holding himself accountable for evolving. Bengals-Bills: What you need to know \n“That way I keep it in front of me,” he said. “The more you see it, the more attainable it is, or the more you want to attain it. I try to take that approach more. That’s always been my personal goal, I just haven’t said it as much. I feel like saying it more is keeping it in the forefront so you’re more mindful of (what you’re) trying to attain.” \nHe leaned to his left on the wide armrest of a black and orange Bengals leather chair around the corner from his locker in Paul Brown Stadium, the kind that could anchor a proper man cave – large enough to make a man who stands 6-foot-6 look normal sized. Dressed in all black team gear – of course with orange accents from his sleeveless hoodie to his gym shoes – Dunlap couldn’t look more at ease. \nHe’s in the third year of a five-year, $40 million contract extension. He’s in the second year of running the Carlos Dunlap Foundation, which is making a real impact in the Greater Cincinnati community. He has one year of an accelerated master’s program from the University of Miami under his belt, with one summer to go. \n“He’s matured, there’s no question,” defensive line coach Jay Hayes said. “He came here when he was 20 years old. He has matured and that has helped. His overall personality, play, being a professional, those types of things. That has helped.” Bengals-Bills: Matchup of the game \nWhich brings Dunlap to the present, and voicing the goal of 23 sacks back in the summer. \nAlong with committing to his classes, Dunlap drilled down on himself as a player. In 2014, he realized that the “circle” was placed on him. Michael Johnson was in Tampa Bay. Geno Atkins was working his way back from ACL rehab to an All-Pro level. Dunlap was, in many ways, the man associated with the pass rush on the defensive line last season. \nHe finished with eight sacks – his largest total since his rookie year – but it wasn’t good enough. Dunlap saw a player who could get to the quarterback, but wasn’t taking him down. Hits and hurries are nice; sacks are what count. \nSo he cut weight – about eight pounds – to play at 280, and worked on his technique.

But Johnson could. \n“It’s an added discipline,” said Johnson, who earned his degree from Georgia Tech last summer. “To be able to go to class and lock in but also get your workouts in. You have to be disciplined with your time, your effort, and carry that into the season with your studying in the film room, playbook and also taking care of your body. It crosses over. If you put in 100 percent effort in one aspect of your life, it’ll carry over to another one.” \nThrough five weeks, Dunlap is reaping the rewards of the discipline. He’s tied for the league lead in sacks. The team is undefeated. A victory – and another sack – Sunday will only intensify the spotlight through the bye week and into a big game in Pittsburgh on Nov. 1. \nBut even though Dunlap voiced the dream – the individual goal of an NFL record – he deflects the praise. He quickly points out – as do the coaches – that Atkins is once again playing at an All-Pro level and is just one sack behind Dunlap. Northwest's Preston Brown leads Bills vs. Bengals \nThe defensive end credits the secondary for giving him extra time to finish a play if he can’t beat his man immediately. He notes the other six Bengals who have had a hand in bringing down a quarterback as well. \n“It’s clearly evident it’s a group effort,” Dunlap said. “Hopefully we stay that way. We compete within the group, as a group. That elevates our game the most.” \nHis teammates and coaches who have seen Dunlap develop have seen this coming. The front office felt it when it extended his contract. This year’s success could be deemed the next step in the journey of a career. \nOr it could be the run up to a leap. \n“I was trying to figure how to level up myself,” Dunlap said. “When I say level up, I mean I tried to better myself for the team. I’ve been fortunate enough to do some good things but I tried to find a way to get better. Because getting to the playoffs four years in a row is good, but we want to be great. We’ve got to figure out how to reinvent ourselves so we can keep the good stuff that we’ve done but take that extra step up. \n“That’s what, basically, was my whole offseason (was about). We want to keep what we’re doing that’s good, but we want to get better. So we’ve got to figure out what it is to take that extra step and I feel like we’re starting to take that extra step.” Buy Photo \nCincinnati Bengals defensive end Carlos Dunlap (96) fires up the crowd in the third quarter during the NFL game between the Seattle Seahawks and the Cincinnati Bengals, Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015, at Paul Brown Stadium in Cincinnati, Ohio.
