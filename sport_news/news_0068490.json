The greens are very undulating and firm so it's hard to get it close to the hole. \n\"I thought at the beginning of the week even par would be a pretty good score just because it's so tough to get it close, so I am really happy with one over par today.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:11:31.449+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
