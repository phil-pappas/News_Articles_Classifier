The lefty made his 31st start for a career high, topping his 30 outings in 2009 as a rookie with Oakland. Healthy for the season again, he also reached a high for innings with 180 1-3. \nJust three balls left the infield against Anderson and no San Francisco runner reached second base until an eighth-inning throwing error by second baseman Howie Kendrick. Anderson gave up four hits, struck out three and didn't walk a batter in 7 2-3 innings. \nTim Hudson (8-9) allowed three runs and three hits in 2 1-3 innings in the final start of his 17-year big league career. \nChase Utley hit a sacrifice fly after Andre Ethier's leadoff triple in the second, Adrian Gonzalez added an RBI single and Ethier drove in a run on a groundout for the NL West champion Dodgers. Los Angeles split the four-game series with the reigning World Series champions, bouncing back a day after being shut out 5-0 on Mike Leake's two-hitter. \nThe 40-year-old right-Hudson said his farewell last weekend across the bay in Oakland where his career began in 1999, pitching opposite former Giants lefty Barry Zito. \nManager Bruce Bochy expected Hudson's outing to be short considering he has been bothered by a tender left hip. Hudson walked off to a roaring ovation in the third, tipping his cap in every direction before going through a lineup of teammates who moved in front of the dugout rail to offer hugs and handshakes. \nHudson will be honored during the weekend along with left-handed reliever Jeremy Affeldt, who announced his retirement Thursday and entered to relieve Hudson. \nHudson is the majors' active wins leader for a few more days with 222 career victories. He won his first World Series ring last season and winds up having thrown 46,631 pitches against 13,005 batters. \nThe Giants won the season series 11-8, beating the Dodgers in eight of 10 at home. \nKenley Jansen pitched a perfect ninth for his 35th save. \nFILM SESSION \nFans were asked to boo during the \"Kiss-Cam\" and seventh-inning stretch as Netflix filmed for a portion of an upcoming original series, \"Fuller House,\" due out next year. \nTRAINER'S ROOM \nDodgers: OF Yasiel Puig was playing four innings in an instructional league game and is now running at 100 percent on his strained right hamstring in what manager Don Mattingly called \"pretty miraculous\" and \"legendary\" — yet that doesn't mean he's certain to make the division series roster for the best-of-five series against the Mets. \"Like three days ago he was running at 80 percent and having pain and then all of a sudden he's going 100 percent and feeling fine,\" Mattingly said. \"It's been pretty miraculous, actually, to me.\" \nGiants: World Series MVP Madison Bumgarner is being shut down and won't start Sunday. Manager Bruce Bochy spoke to him about the decision given the lefty threw 270 innings last year and another 218 1-3 this season. ... OF Nori Aoki was being examined by renowned concussion specialist Dr. Micky Collins at the University of Pittsburgh on Thursday. Even if cleared he is \"doubtful\" to play the rest of the season. \nUP NEXT \nDodgers: LHP Alex Wood (11-12) starts Friday night against San Diego looking to bounce back after his eight runs allowed to Colorado last Sunday matched a career high. \nGiants: Rookie RHP Chris Heston (12-10) looks to end his first year in the majors with consecutive wins as he pitches the opener of a season-ending series against Colorado. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:04:28.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
