Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015, (AP Photo/Jae C. Hong) \nMOMCHENGLADBACH, Germany (AP) — Borussia Moenchengladbach head coach Andre Schubert says U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann had a “responsibility” to substitute defender Fabian Johnson during the Americans’ 3-2 loss to Mexico on Saturday. \nJohnson was came off in the 111th minute of the playoff for a Confederations Cup berth after complaining of soreness in his thigh. \n“When a player feels a tightening of their thigh in added time in a game and could then be on the verge of a more serious injury, I only think it’s the responsibility of the team and himself to have him subbed off,” Schubert said Thursday. \nJohnson was replaced by Brad Evans with the score 2-2, and Paul Aguilar scored for Mexico in the 118th minute. \nKlinsmann criticized his defender afterwards and told reporters Monday that he sent Johnson back to Germany. \n“I had a very severe word with Fabian Johnson, and I sent him home today,” Klinsmann said. \n“He can rethink his approach about his team,” the 51-year-old Klinsmann added.
