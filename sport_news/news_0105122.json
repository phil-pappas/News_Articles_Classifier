The Champion Golfer of the Year sounds off on flying home with the Claret Jug, living out of the back of a Dodge and his (caffeine-free) jet-lag cure.\nThere were a bunch of us on that jet heading back from St. Andrews: Jordan Spieth, Harris English, Jason Dufner, Billy Horschel. A moment like that can be surreal when I think about where I once was and where I am. You never know how long it's going to last, but I try to enjoy every moment.\nAdChoices Back in my mini-tour days , my house and my transportation were one and the same. My closet was the trunk of the green Dodge Intrepid that I drove everywhere, with my clubs stuffed in it and a bar that I hung my clothes from. On the rare occasions when I flew, I went economy and it felt like the ultimate luxury.\nMostly I deal with jet lag with a pretty basic formula: I work out on the day of my arrival, stay up as late as possible that first night and then, when it's time to crash, crash hard. I've never had a cup of coffee in my life. Not because I think I wouldn't like it. I'm afraid I'd love it.\nThe upside to traveling in more comfort is that it takes less of a physical toll and allows me to better enjoy my quality time. With my kids the age they are, that's my number-one priority.\nI've been lucky with my luggage . Once, at the 2007 British Open at Carnoustie, my clubs didn't show up till Wednesday. Overall, though, I've had the good fortune of never having to go without a fresh change of clothes.\nMy circumstances have changed , but at heart I'm still that midwestern guy. On the road, I don't really need, or even want, five-star amenities. I just want to feel like I'm at home.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.golf.com/"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:52:11.497+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
