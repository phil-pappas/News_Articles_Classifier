It was the second-straight week the Coyotes scrimmaged at home, as they worked out with Barstow the previous week. Coyotes right fielder Biggie Hernandez, batting cleanup, slugged a no-doubter in the second inning to put Cerro Coso on the board first. He also made an appearance on the mound later in the game, throwing two innings. “He’s been solid, doing what we expect him to do,” said Cerro Coso head coach Justus Scott. “He’s a presence at the plate with his power.” Left-handed pitcher Darrell Allen got the start on the mound for the Coyotes. He threw three innings and three strikeouts while allowing two earned runs and two walks. “We extended him a little bit today,” Scott said. “He had 45 pitches, which was about 10 more than usual. We like to extend guys a little bit through the course of the fall.” The scoreboard went back-and-forth early, with Cerro Coso and Taft exchanging two-run innings in the third. However, the Cougars held the control offensively, while the Coyotes worked on getting playing time spread around and figuring out where they were in in-game situations. Right-hander Scott Flinn came into the game in the fifth and tossed a 1-2-3 inning, striking out two Cougars in the process. He allowed one hit in two frames. “Flinn is pitching backwards by throwing his breaking ball early for strikes,” Scott said. “Strike 1’s a huge pitch in college baseball, and he’s been able to get the ball in there early.” On Saturday, the Coyotes will visit the Antelope Valley Marauders in Lancaster for their third scrimmage of the fall. “You can drill it out and work every day, but in-game action is where you learn,” Scott said. “The game moves a little faster each time, so it’s good for them to get out there and hit different pitching. “You want to go out there, compete and work well. These two scrimmages we’ve had, it’s been about working out and seeing what we have.” By Christopher Livingston", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:25:53.221+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
