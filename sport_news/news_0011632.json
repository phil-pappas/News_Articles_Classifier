The win lifted Monaco to eighth place, nine points behind leader Paris Saint-Germain, which hosted Saint-Etienne in a late game. \nAfter a good start to the season, Reims slumped to a third straight loss that left the Champagne side lagging two points behind Monaco in 11th. \n\"I'm only interested in winning points for my team,\" said goalkeeper Johny Placide, who made a series of good saves but was powerless to block Silva's header. \"These three consecutive losses are annoying. We are lacking aggressiveness.\" \nMonaco could have added a couple of goals before the interval but Carillo hit the woodwork twice in the first half and Placide thwarted a fine volley from former France midfielder Jeremy Toulalan. \nPlacide was decisive again to deny Nabil Dirar's 20-meter effort in the 66th minute and the Reims goalkeeper won another one-on-one with the midfielder 10 minutes later. \nReims was reduced to 10 men in the 68th after Antoine Devaux was sent off for a second yellow card. The hosts played better after Devaux's dismissal and their best chance came in added time. Jordan Siebatcheu fired a low shot onto Danijel Subasic's post after taking advantage of a bad clearance from the Monaco defense. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:59:20.002+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
