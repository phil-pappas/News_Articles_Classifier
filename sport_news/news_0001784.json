EAST RUTHERFORD – Rex Ryan has not forgotten the last time he coached against Tom Coughlin and the Giants in a game that counted.\nPreseason Snoopy Bowl affairs between MetLife Stadium co-tenants are not included.\nNow the head coach of the Buffalo Bills, Ryan talked at length with reporters via conference call about the memorable Jets-Giants 2011 Christmas Eve game, a 29-14 Giants victory sparked by Victor Cruz’s 99-yard touchdown that sent \"big brother\" all the way to a Super Bowl XLVI triumph in Indianapolis five weeks later.\n\"There’s no question it sticks with you,\" said Ryan, whose new team will welcome the Giants into Ralph Wilson Stadium for a 1 p.m. game Sunday in Orchard Park, N.Y. \"If we would have won that game, we would have made the playoffs and the Giants would have probably been out. Actually, no probably about it, they would have been out. \n\"Yeah, that one, you remember that day, it was Christmas Eve, we were totally in control of that game, and then the third-and-10, they hit the 99-yard touchdown pass into double coverage. … If you could point at one play that turned maybe not just a game around but maybe a season around, that was that game. That play. Because the Giants came out a totally different team at halftime, and they carried it throughout the rest of the regular season and the postseason, and they won a Super Bowl. So obviously it changed their fortune that season, and it certainly changed ours with that play and that loss.\"\nRyan denied that he had any say in the Jets’ decision to cover up with curtains the Giants’ Super Bowl murals painted on the wall outside their locker room before that fateful game. Had that touchdown pass to Cruz gone incomplete, does Ryan believe the Jets could have gone on to win Super Bowl XLVI instead of the Giants?\nHis answer revealed the bravado of the old Rex, not the muted version that closed out his tenure with Gang Green the past two seasons. \"Yeah,\" he said. \"I absolutely do. Yup.\"\nAt one point during the call, Ryan was asked if he missed New York.\nHe replied with sarcasm and a bit of a chuckle: \"I live in New York. I don’t know what you’re talking about.\"\nThe new Rex Ryan, same as the old one.\nBRIEFS: Giants CB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie (concussion), DE Robert Ayers (hamstring), LT Ereck Flowers (ankle) and DE Owa Odighizuwa (foot) returned to practice. … Ryan acknowledged that the Bills will likely be without RB LeSean McCoy (hamstring) and WR Sammy Watkins (calf) on Sunday. Rookie RB Karlos Williams should get the start ahead of McCoy, while Wyckoff native Chris Hogan will see an increase in his snaps if Watkins is out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:43:37.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
