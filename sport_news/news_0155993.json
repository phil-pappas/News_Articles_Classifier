(AP Photo/Gene Puskar) Kickers are often take it for granted, both in real life and fantasy football .\nAdChoices Until a game like Thursday night.\nWhich is why Baltimore Ravens coach John Harbaugh smiled when asked about the importance of having reliable kicker.\n“In this league, most games come down to three points,” Harbaugh said. “We have a great kicker.”\nKickers made the difference as the Ravens rallied for a 23-20 victory over the host Pittsburgh Steelers in overtime.\nWith the Steelers clinging to a 20-17 lead, they twice called on Josh Scobee to extend the advantage in the final minutes of the fourth quarter. However, Scobee missed from 49 yards with 2:24 remaining and 41 yards with 1:06 left while kicking into the open end of Heinz Field, a stadium historically tough to kickers because of the swirling wind patterns.\nThat set the stage for Tucker to force overtime by kicking a 42-yard field goal with three seconds remaining.\nScobee’s misses also influenced Steelers coach Mike Tomlin’s decision-making in overtime. Pittsburgh drove to the Baltimore 33-yard line on their second possession of the extra period, but eschewed a potential game-winning field-goal attempt on fourth-and-1 only to have Michael Vick throw an incomplete pass.\nThe Ravens then drove 32 yards in eight plays to set a game-winning 52-yard field goal by Tucker with 5:08 remaining. The win was Baltimore’s first of the season in four games after starting 0-3 for the first time in franchise history.\nTucker has made of 10-of-11 field goal attempts this season and 107-of-119 in his four-year career.\n“No matter which end you spin it, which end of the stadium you’re kicking in, it’s a tough stadium to kick in,” Tucker said. “It’s a tough place to play in. It’s one of the most electric stadiums to play in in the National Football League. So to be able to come in and win in such a dramatic fashion with just a consummated team effort, it’s really special.”\nScobee spent the first 11 seasons of his career with the Jacksonville Jaguars before being acquired in a trade just before the start of the season. The Steelers were forced to make a trade after losing kickers Shaun Suisham and Garrett Hartley to season-ending injuries during the preseason.\n“I feel like I let the team down and it’s not something that I ever want to remember doing,” Scobee said. “It’s a bad feeling. It was a hard-fought game on both sides. I wish I had been able to come through, but it just wasn’t my night.”\nScobee is just 6-for-10 on field goal attempts through four games and it is easy to wonder if the Steelers will be on their fourth kicker by the time they next play, visiting the San Diego Chargers on Oct. 12 for a Monday night game.\n“We have to turn the stones over,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said asked of the possibility of changing kickers. “We have to find ways to win games. Obviously, that’s an element of it. It was an element of the outcome tonight.”\n—\nThe Cincinnati Bengals are 3-0 for a second straight season, but this doesn’t have a fluky feeling to it, mainly because of the play of fifth-year quarterback Andy Dalton.\nDalton has completed 66.3 percent of his passes for 866 yards with eight touchdowns and one interception.\n“He’s really playing well,” an NFL personnel man said. “You can see him really starting to mature into a quality quarterback. He’s sure of himself. He looks like a leader now.”\nDalton showed that last week as the Bengals rallied for a 28-24 road win over the Ravens.\nHe threw an interception in the end zone and also fumbled while getting sacked, with linebacker C.J. Mosley returning it 51 yards for a touchdown to put Baltimore ahead 17-14 with 6:49 left. On the first play after the kickoff, Dalton threw an 80-yard touchdown pass to A.J. Green.\nWhen the Ravens took the lead again in the fourth quarter, Dalton again led the Bengals back throwing a seven-yard TD to Green with 1:46 left for the game-winner.\n“That’s one of Andy Dalton’s best qualities is decisiveness and his ability to feel the spacing on the field,” Bengals coach Marvin Lewis said. “He’s got to make sure the ball’s go to the right spots. He’s done a good job of that.”\nDalton also integrated Green, the Bengals’ No. 1 wide receiver more, as he had 10 receptions for 227 yards and two touchdowns after having a combined eight catches for 108 yards and one score in the first two games.\nThe Bengals haven’t been 4-0 since 2005 and will look to stay perfect Sunday when they host the Kansas City Chiefs. It might be wise to jump on Dalton now while he still holds good value.\n***\nBuffalo Bills running LeSean McCoy (hamstring) and wide receiver Sammy Watkins (hip) have both been ruled out for Sunday’s game against the New York Giants, but coach Rex Ryan isn’t fretting.\nRyan believes his team can raise its record to 3-1 without the two stars, which speaks to the improved depth for a team that hasn’t been to the playoffs since 1999.\nRookie running back Karlos Williams, the fifth-round draft this year from Florida State, had 112 yards and a touchdown on 12 carries in last week’s 41-14 road win over the Miami Dolphins last Sunday on a day when McCoy was limited to 16 yards on a 11 carries. In his first three games, Williams is averaging an impressive 7.8 yards a carry with 186 yards and three TDs on 24 carries.\nThe Bills also have a worthy replacement for Watkins should he miss the game. Robert Woods would join Percy Harvin in the starting lineup, and Chris Hogan would slide into the No. 3 spot. Woods has nine receptions for 125 yards this season.\nWilliams and Woods could be good value plays for your fantasy football team.\n“Are we better off with Sammy Watkins and LeSean McCoy, 100 percent yes, but we have good players behind them,” Ryan said. “Every team in the league will go through similar things; it’s how you respond to it. The whole team’s confident in the guys that are behind those players. We have a game to play. I don’t think the Giants will come in here and feel sorry for us.\n“We have a lot of guys out, but the next man has to step up. We’re fortunate we have a deep team and we’ll have to rely on our depth.”\n***\nBrandon Weeden is already feeling the heat after one start in place of injured Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo.\nWeeden completed 22-of-26 passes for 232 yards — though with no touchdowns and one interception — against the Atlanta Falcons last Sunday, but the Cowboys lost 39-28 at home. Though Weeden had an 84.6 completion percentage, he drew heavy criticism from the media and fans after attempting only two passes longer than nine yards.\nThe criticism bothered Weeden, who also doesn’t have the full faith of owner/general manager Jerry Jones and coach Jason Garrett. The trade with the Bills for journeyman quarterback Matt Cassel after Romo broke his left collarbone Sept. 20 in a win over the Philadelphia Eagles is proof.\nRomo was placed on the injured reserve list with a designated to return, but is not eligible to play again until Nov. 22 for the game against the Dolphins at Miami.\n“Obviously you guys are beating a dead horse, talking about throwing the ball underneath,” Weeden told reporters. “That was our plan all along. You look back, was there a couple times I could’ve thrown a ball maybe to an outside receiver given the plays that were called? Maybe one or two I could’ve thrown it out there. But those were the matchups we liked and that’s what they were giving us in coverage.”\nOne player who benefitted with Weeden’s low-risk style was running back Lance Dunbar, who had a career-high 10 receptions. Though Dunbar carried just twice for 13 yards, he might be a good fantasy play Sunday night when the Cowboys visit the winless New Orleans Saints.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://www.fanduel.com/fantasy-football"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:17:32.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
