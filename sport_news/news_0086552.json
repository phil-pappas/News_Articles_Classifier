But soon, ownership will need to look at the team's future — mainly where it will play baseball decades from now.\nA league-designed Rangers shirt showing the Dallas skyline riled up some residents of Arlington — the team's home since 1972 — and made Rangers officials wince. That insensitivity by Major League Baseball and a decline in attendance this year led to speculation about what the Rangers might do when the team's contract with Arlington and Globe Life Park expires in less than a decade.\nThat's a topic Rangers officials are uninterested in discussing publicly.\n\"We have a lease at Globe Life Park with the City of Arlington until April 2024,\" wrote team spokesman John Blake in an email. \"Other than that, the club really has no further comment.\"\nArlington City Manager Trey Yelverton said there have been no discussions with the Rangers about what happens after 2024, when the team's contract ends. He said city officials will continue working with the Rangers on maintaining and enhancing the current stadium and listen when the team considers its next steps.\n\"As those needs become more defined, it'll be a priority for Arlington to maintain the relationship we've had for 40-plus years,\" said Yelverton, who isn't concerned about current speculation. \"The conversation that matters the most is the one between us and the team.\"\nThe staff of Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings did not make him available for comment last week. And Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said there haven't been discussions with the county about a stadium for the Rangers. And he praised the Rangers' longtime home.\n\"If the Rangers ever were interested in moving to Dallas, we'd love to have them here,\" he said. \"But I think the focus right now needs to be on our great chances this postseason.\"\nGoing into Sunday's game at Globe Life Park, the Rangers lead the Toronto Blue Jays 2-0 in the best-of-five American League Division Series.\nJohn Crawford, president and CEO of Downtown Dallas Inc., said it's not too early to discuss the Rangers future. He said construction — including site preparation and infrastructure — for a downtown stadium would probably take five years. Internal discussion among Texas officials, scouting sites, negotiating financing and getting voters on board could take years more.\n\"Asking these questions isn't premature,\" said Crawford, who is happy to make the case that the Rangers should move to Dallas.\nPast efforts It also isn't unprecedented. Dallas officials assembled a preliminary presentation in 1988 to try to lure the Rangers out of Arlington. There were proposed sites next to the convention center, in the arts district and next to Farmers Market.\nInstead, Arlington voters agreed to chip in $135 million to build a new stadium next to the old Arlington Stadium. That new venue both followed and bucked prevailing trends.\nThe stadium — originally known as The Ballpark in Arlington — took inspiration from the retro stadium style that started with Camden Yards in downtown Baltimore. The red brick stadium evoked early 20th century ballparks.\nThe construction of ballpark followed the prevailing design style but rejected the idea of moving downtown. Despite recent outliers — including the San Francisco 49ers, Atlanta Braves and the Cowboys — teams have generally steered away from the suburbs.\n\"You have to talk market by market,\" said Bill Dorsey, chairman of the Association of Luxury Suite Directors. \"It's not one size fits all.\"\nThe case for Dallas In Dallas, Crawford said city leaders can make a persuasive case about why the Rangers should move east.\nHe said about 46,000 people live in downtown Dallas, an area that encompasses more than just the central business district. There are also 130,000 people working downtown.\n\"There's a huge audience that can be drawn in,\" Crawford said.\nThe pools of fans are potential season ticket holders as well as casual followers who might go to a game after work. Crawford said downtown conventioneers would also be a new audience for the Rangers.\nAlso, the region's population has moved east and north. About two-thirds of people in the Dallas-Fort Worth area now live in the eastern half of the area.\nDrop in attendance Rangers officials shot down speculation that lower attendance this year was a sign of problems at Globe Life Park or a waning fan base in Arlington. Attendance was down about 8 percent despite a late season rally and playoff appearance.\nBlake said the drop was the result of the disastrous 2014 season, when the Rangers finished in last place with their worst record in nearly 30 years. The team's season ticket base dropped from 21,240 to 16,336.\n\"The impressive part is that the club was only down 8 percent on overall attendance which is an indication that a lot of the difference was made up in individual sales,\" Blake said.\nHe also noted that this year's attendance was comparable to 2010, when the Rangers were in first place for much of the season.\nIf the Rangers decided to move to Dallas, it's difficult to know how that would affect walkup ticket sales. That might depend greatly on the location and ease of access.\nCrawford said areas near Fair Park, in the Cedars-Southside area and along the Trinity River near Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge could be considered for a stadium.\nHe said all would be within walking distance to rail stations, which could ease traffic concerns. A site near the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge would require a pedestrian connection across Interstate 35E to DART's Victory Station.\nThe case for Arlington There are also cases to be made for ignoring trends and staying in Arlington.\nThe team has an established fan base in Tarrant County and knows what to expect. When the Rangers started their last playoff runs starting in 2010, attendance spiked and was near the top of the Major Leagues, even with the often brutal Texas summers. The presumption is that a new stadium would be a dome or have a retractable roof, no matter where it was built.\nSecuring a stadium deal likely would be easier and more predictable in Arlington. The city's legendary Mayor Tom Vandergriff helped bring the Washington Senators to Texas in the early 1970s, and the city's identity is closely tied to its baseball team.\nWhen it came time to build a new stadium for the Rangers, voters overwhelmingly approved the plan for bonds to be repaid with a sales tax increase. Although the stadium didn't serve as an anchor for additional development as hoped, the 20-year debt was paid off 10 years early.\nVoters by a solid margin also agreed to build a new stadium for the Cowboys. And even though that cost the city nearly 2½ times as much as the ballpark, AT&T Stadium is also on pace to be paid off 14 years early. The bonds are expected to be retired in 2021 and give Arlington a shot at bidding for a new Rangers stadium.\n\"It's clear that we've got that down,\" Yelverton said about stadium financing.\nBoth stadium deals had opposition but not enough to kill the funding. And few would predict that a new Rangers stadium would fail in Arlington, despite many economists warning that these aren't good public investments.\nDallas doesn't have sales tax capacity to funnel to a stadium. But the city and county could use other taxes or fees and tax increment financing zones to help pay for a stadium.\n\"I do understand why people go to the suburbs,\" Dorsey said. \"There's land. There's easier access. You don't have some of the critical issues.\"\nThe Rangers have also purchased the adjoining parking lots from former team owner Tom Hicks. So, Texas now has control of the surrounding property for additional development or just the revenue generated by the parking lots.\nEven if the Rangers decide to move, they wouldn't have to leave their baof llpark the moment their lease ends. The stadium is well maintained, and the Rangers have spent about $50 million on renovations the past five years.\nDorsey the Association of Luxury Suite Directors said the amount of money a team sinks into a stadium can sometimes be a hint about its future intentions.\n\"If they let a stadium go down or deteriorate for a bit, sometimes that's a sign they're thinking about moving,\" he said.\nAt Texas Stadium, there were complaints for years about the venue's deteriorating condition and patchwork roof in need of a paint job.\nWhile Arlington seems the safe bet, there are reasons sports teams have generally headed back to the big cities.\nThe Rangers could also decide to stay at Globe Life Park long after 2024. At 30 years old by then, it's unlikely to be an outdated embarrassment like the old Arlington stadium.\nBut being good enough isn't always enough now. To accommodate fans desire for more technology and amenities, Dorsey said stadiums often have major renovations after 10 or 20 years.\n\"The shelf life for stadiums and arenas is getting shorter and shorter,\" he said. \"Used to be, a stadium could be around for 50 years. ... The shelf life for a stadium is rarely more than 30 years anymore.\"\nMORE RANGERS MUST-SEE COVERAGE The Rangers are back in the postseason as the AL West Champs.\nFULL PLAYOFF SCHEDULE HERE\nLatest news Fraley: How June demotion sparked Rangers lefty Jake Diekman to pitch 'with a vengeance'\nGrant: How Rangers second baseman Rougned Odor rediscovered his 'edge,' 'swagger'\nScouting the ALDS Game 3 pitchers: Which Blue Jays Martin Perez loves, hates to face\nCould the Texas Rangers move to downtown Dallas?
