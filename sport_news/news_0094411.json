They don’t know what the right thing is — hardly an unusual position for them, despite being a $10 billion industry.\nAdChoices If they understood the right thing, instead of just the right thing for them and their partners in the fundamentally crooked NCAA, nobody would even be discussing the remote possibility of Fournette sitting out next season at LSU.\nMORE: Best NFL player ever from each SEC school | How good is Leonard Fournette? Just watch\nFournette, a once-in-a-generation running-back talent, has to think of himself, because nobody in the NCAA or the NFL is going to think of him above themselves.\nIf either understood what the right thing was, we might long ago have seen Herschel Walker in the NFL after his freshman year. Bo Jackson after his sophomore year. Jadeveon Clowney after his sophomore year . Jameis Winston after his redshirt freshman year.\nEven Adrian Peterson after his senior year … in high school .\nInstead, they all waited their turn — except that it wasn’t “their” turn at all. It was their adherence to NFL and college football rules that benefit everybody but them, rules they had no say in creating and have none in changing.\nThat’s how you become a $10 billion industry like the NFL is. You do everything in your considerable power to keep that money out of the hands of others for as long as possible. You also let other billion-dollar industries do your dirty work for you. (And, of course, we know how that other industry makes its money, and off whose backs.)\nDon’t worry, this won’t be another cry for the NFL to create a legitimate minor-league system and stop freeloading off of college football. After nearly a century, they’re still content to leave the training of their future employees in the hands of thousands of others with their own agendas … and even reserve the right to complain about how they’re getting trained .\nThe NFL’s not killing that golden goose any time soon.\nBut suppose you’re an NFL team that believes, behind closed doors and out of earshot, that Fournette is the next Jim Brown. Would you rather get him into your system as fast as possible? Put him on the roster, even if he doesn’t play right away, although nothing would stop him from earning playing time? Or put him on the practice squad, even at his likely first-round salary, if he proves too raw for now?\nIsn’t it more sensible, and even cost-effective, to raise him up yourselves, groom him to be a pro the way baseball and hockey franchises do with their prodigies?\nOr would you rather leave Fournette’s most formative years as a football player in the hands of … Les Miles?\nAsk yourself the same question about Clowney two years ago, when the option of sitting out a year was raised just as it is with Fournette.\nAsk it about Winston, who could have come off a national championship debut and been immediately embedded with professionals and adults, rather than with the coddling at Florida State and Tallahassee.\nNBA teams figured out the right answer to that decades ago. They bet right on Moses Malone , Kevin Garnett, Kobe Bryant, LeBron James and, yes, even Darryl Dawkins . Others washed out early. That’s how it goes sometimes, in every other walk of life.\nThe reasons to deny young talent a fair, true chance are almost always completely self-serving. In every other sport, they can’t, and don’t, survive the light of day.\nExcept in football.\nThe NFL’s age limit is just a random number. It signifies zero about who’s “ready” and who isn’t. There are always exceptions, as every sport, and every industry, has always proven.\nFournette is an exception, an outlier, as LeBron and Bryce Harper and Michael Jackson and Leonardo DiCaprio were.\nFinding creative ways to deny him a chance to pursue his greatness on his terms — not someone else’s — is wrong, period.\nBut the NFL lately has struggled constantly to do right. Why should Leonard Fournette expect anything different?\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAeTwLj.img&quot;}}", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2013-03-06/jadeveon-clowney-2013-nfl-draft-south-carolina-ncaa-eligibility-unjust", "http://www.wsj.com/articles/why-the-nfl-has-a-quarterback-crisis-1441819454", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_ncaa&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live", "http://www.sportingnews.com/video/80308", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2015-09-13/moses-malone-death-dies-obituary-greatness-basketball-76ers-rockets", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Who", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nfl/story/2015-09-30/adrian-peterson-nfl-straight-from-high-school-oklahoma-heisman-cedric-benson-vikings-draft-207", "http://www.sportingnews.com/nba/story/2015-08-27/darryl-dawkins-dead-chocolate-thunder-philadelphia-76ers-sixers-planet-lovetron-nba", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/story/2015-09-30/leonard-fournette-nfl-draft-herschel-walker-cfb", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf0LgZ.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Will", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4656890-best-nfl-players-from-every-sec-school-alabama-georgia-auburn-lsu-florida-tennessee", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf0WkG.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AA4BZeP&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;LSU", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Is", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB1tos2.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Fournette", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Fournette&#39;s", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/story/2015-09-26/leonard-fournette-lsu-running-back-heisman-candidate-leader-syracuse", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAf0d3E.img&quot;}}"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:01:12.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
