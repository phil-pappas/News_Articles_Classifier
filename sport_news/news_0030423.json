And Paul plans to swap out his old \"U\" for a new \"U.\" He's thinking red for this one.\n\"I'm really about to change it,\" he told reporters Monday. \"I'm about to go over it. My heart is at the University of Utah right now. Forever.\"\nFans' hearts are surely with Paul as well after the senior linebacker racked up seven tackles, a forced fumble and a catlike diving interception against Cal in a 30-24 win. This season, Paul is tied for team lead in tackles with 39, and has two picks, two recovered fumbles, one forced fumble, 2.5 tackles for a loss and four pass deflections.\n  Fully healthy for his first time in a Utah uniform, Paul has given the defense a dynamic playmaker in the middle of the field. A former linebacker himself, coach Kyle Whittingham said he often finds himself marveling with everyone else.\n\"He's got great instincts for a linebacker, he's always around the ball,\" he said. \"Gionni is a guy who is a playmaker, and he's got as good instincts for a linebacker as certainly we've ever had here. That's certainly his strength.\"\nPerhaps the impact of Paul's performance was diluted by great performances all over the defense on Saturday night. Utah took Pac-12 player of the week in offense (Devontae Booker) and special teams (Tom Hackett), but Paul was beaten out for defensive honors by Washington's Travis Feeney, who had 2.5 sacks in an upset over USC.\nBut Paul isn't as worried about week-to-week honors as he is about having a great season. One of his goals this year: become an All American.\n\"Coach Whittingham emphasized if you write down your goals, there's like a 90 percent chance they come true,\" he said. \"I'm hoping to be [an All American].\nPaul can be freakishly competitive. He says he has a running competition with Marcus Williams, Dominique Hatfield and other defenders over who can make the most game-changing plays.\nHe didn't come away with the most tackles or the most picks against USC, but his interception, coming off a tipped ball off Hunter Dimick's mitts, was dazzling. Even he isn't sure how he came up with it.\n\"Yoga,\" he suggested. \"We take yoga classes, but I don't really know how I caught the ball. I just reached out for it and it ended up in my hands.\"\n\nRotations in the trenches\nWhile the Utes said they hoped for five set starters to play almost the whole game on offensive line, nearing the midway point, the team has become comfortable with a rotation.\nWhittingham said the right guard spot is a half-and-half split between Salesi Uhatafe and Hiva Lutui, while left tackle is \"two-thirds Sam [Tevi] and one-third Jackson [Barton].\" The arrangement has been going on for the last few games. In the case of Barton, Whittingham said, it comes down to playing well in practice and in games.\nThe offensive line relies on chemistry as much as any of the units on the team. But right tackle J.J. Dielman said the rotation hasn't affected how he plays all that much.\n\"It's different chemistry, but it's effective,\" Dielman said. \"I know Leka [Uhatafe's] strengths and weaknesses, and I know Hiva's strengths and weaknesses. I know how to cater to my guard, you know? And they're playing lights out, both of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:38:32.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
