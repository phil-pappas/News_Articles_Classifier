Comment   Will Gilbert Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 12:01 AM By Will Gilbert Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 12:01 AM Heber Springs Prior to last week’s bus accident, it had already been a difficult year for Heber Springs regarding injuries to key players. Heber Springs Coach Darren Gowen said it’s depressing to think about how many more players were absent from practice this week due to injuries sustained in the crash that sent eight players and one manager to the hospital with a variety of injuries. Gowen said 24 players dressed out for practice this week in preparation for Central Arkansas Christian (4-1, 2-0), which enters the game tied atop the 2-4A standings with Stuttgart. “It’s been pretty good, upbeat practices,” said Gowen. “These are really good kids. They just want to get out there and get back to a routine and they’ve done a good job with that. We don’t have a lot of numbers out there but the ones out there are doing whatever they can just like this community has … Everybody has stepped up and said ‘I will do whatever I need to do’ and I am very proud of that.” The Panthers started the year with 39 players listed on their roster. Although low in numbers entering tonight’s pivotal game, Heber figures to be emotionally high while playing for those who can’t dress out and one player, junior William Rubio, who remains in the hospital recovering from critical injuries. “It’s a little depressing to count how many players are going to be out,” said Gowen. “I have no doubt we are going to come out and play hard. They are going to come out and do what they are asked to do. I’m sure there will be quite a few people there supporting them. We are going to go out and play hard, have fun and do our best.” Heber could jump back into the thick of the 2-4A Conference race with a victory. The Panthers defeated CAC 36-15 last fall in a game played in wet conditions helping slow the Mustangs’ aerial attack. Averaging 32.6 points per game, CAC boasts a balanced attack led by quarterback Noah Evans (6-1, 185). The junior has completed 93 of 174 passes for 1,214 yards and 10 touchdowns with nine interceptions. Evans’ primary targets are junior receiver Josh Johnson (6-0, 170) and senior receiver Hunter Corbell (5-8, 155). Johnson enters the game with 32 receptions for 475 yards and two touchdowns, while Corbell has made 29 catches for 336 yards and one touchdown. The Mustangs’ running game revolves around running back Braylon Harris (6-0, 215). The senior has carried 79 times for 516 yards and seven touchdowns. Harris also has three touchdown receptions. “They throw and catch really well and they have a pretty good running back also,” said Gowen. “In order for us to get a win we are going to have to go out and execute our game plan on defense. We are going to have to tackle well in space and get pressure on their quarterback. You always want to eliminate something so if we can stop the run and make them just throw that will be very big for us.” Page 2 of 2 - CAC, which relied on its defense to defeat Helena-West Helena Central 17-15 on the road last week, mixes up its alignment. “They put a lot of pressure on your inside running game and try to make everything go to the edges,” said Gowen. “If we can sustain our blocks on the edge we should have a pretty good night.” The Mustangs opened their season with a 34-6 win over Baptist Prep before falling to No. 2 ranked Pulaski Robinson, 55-35. CAC bounced back from that defeat by winning three straight over Valley View (50-14), Riverview (27-14) and Helena (17-15). In honor of Rubio the Panthers will wear No. 25 decals on their helmets and all fans are encouraged to form a spirit line as the players take the field tonight. The Panthers 92-3, 1-1) are averaging 17.8 points per game and allowing 33.8 per contest. The all-time series versus CAC is tied at 1-1. Hootens.com favors the Mustangs by 3. Fans can listen to Voice of the Panthers Billy Morgan and longtime partner Lance Hamilton broadcast the game live on 99.1 KRZS The Stallion.
