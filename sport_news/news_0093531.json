Two long Alabama drives ended in field goals before Tennessee zipped down in four plays for a touchdown and a one-point lead.\nJust 5:49 remained. Margins were thin and 101,821 witnesses knew it. The season was in jeopardy along with an eight-game winning streak over Tennessee. Nick Saban said players looked \"sluggish\" all day as eight games without a bye became a factor. The nerves, though never left the stands and Alabama found just enough juice.\nSeven plays, two fades and a Derrick Henry rumble later, Alabama's season was saved for at least another two weeks. A fifth sack and first fumble recovery sealed it as cigar smoke replaced anxiety.\nCrimson Tide quarterback Jake Coker never worried.\n\"I don't know,\" he said, \"there was just a feeling. We were going to get it done.\"\nJake Coker postgame after Tennessee win Jake Coker postgame after Tennessee win\nIt required an act Alabama hadn't completed since the opening drive. Eight straight Alabama drives fell short of the end zone after Derrick Henry's first-quarter 20-yard touchdown run. Penalties and pass-protection issues troubled the Tide all afternoon, adding to the stadium's collective uneasiness.\nThere wasn't much said in the huddle before drive started at the Tide 29.\n\"We knew what we had to do,\" said tight end O.J. Howard. \"We had to go down and get a score or else ...\"\nIt didn't start well as the pocket dissolved on the first snap. Once again, Coker had to make something happen with his feet. A two-yard loss could've been worse.\nThe next play didn't need as much time. The first of Coker's fades went 29 yards up the Tennessee sideline in an acrobatic catch from ArDarius Stewart. First down, ball at the Vol 44. Facing third-and-six a few plays later, Coker found Ridley on the opposite sideline for a crucial 15-yard gain to the Vol 40.\n\"Based off what they gave me, I just did what (Lane Kiffin) told me to do,\" Coker said. \"Really, they weren't perfect balls, but those guys, ArDarius and Calvin, made some huge plays.\"\nJake Coker postgame after Tennessee win Jake Coker postgame after Tennessee win\nFrom there, it was Henry's show. After running just nine times in the first half, he got the heavy load late. The clock became a factor at that point, too.\n\"Well we want to milk the clock as much as we can,\" Saban said. \"We were in position to kick a field goal and win the game as well, but they had three timeouts. Most of the time, the other coach is not going to let you take the clock and the game.\"\nTwo Henry runs put Alabama on the 14 with a first down and a little more than two minutes left. A little misdirection put Henry back in the end zone. It looked like a jet sweep to the right with Ridley coming in motion, but was really a Henry run to the left. Right guard Alphonse Taylor and tight end O.J. Howard had the initial key blocks while Stewart sealed the edge.\n Watch Derrick Henry's game-winning touchdown against Tennessee Watch as one of the country's best running backs gives Alabama the lead with a gritty 14-yard touchdown run against the Tennessee Volunteers\n\"(Taylor) leads off first and I go off his block so the guy he took, I take the next guy past him,\" Howard said. \"I did that. We gave Derrick a little crease and he scored a touchdown.\"\nThe drive spanned eight plays, 71 yards and left 2:24 for Tennessee's last shot. It reminded center Ryan Kelly of the season-saving drive at LSU last November.\n\"It was just about doing your job,\" he said. \"In those situations, things can get a little bit unraveled. You're just trying to score so bad that you kind of overdo your job, or whatever. But everybody just needed to do their job. That was the message right before that drive.\"\nCoker was 2-for-2 for 44 yards on that last possession. Henry ran five times for 29 yards â€• 14 on the game winner.\n\"Some people grew up tonight,\" said Alabama linebacker Reggie Ragland. \"We needed a game like that to show what kind of tough team we is.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T08:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:47:02.302+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
