I don't know, if somebody told him he is going takeover Kotoko and he was so excited and jumped the gun. I don't know if he spoke to Otumfuo and he told him this is the case go ahead,' he told Kasapa FM. \n'When Otumfuo Opoku Ware spoke to me to takeover Kotoko that was Christmas and I didn't discuss it with anybody until February. That is me and when I was even sacked, I didn't say anything about it, because the protocol and etiquette is something that you have to be careful about. \n'I believe that the seat of Otumfuo should be respected in many ways, even higher than the seat of the president of the country and therefore you need to be very careful. I don't know the sort of conversation, he had with Nana, but protocol would suggest that he should have waited' \nFor more sports news visit allSports.com.gh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:15:24.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
