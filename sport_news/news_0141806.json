A 2-year-old died at OU Medical Center Children's Hospital in Oklahoma City, hospital spokeswoman Vallery Brown told CNN. Thirty-three people suffered injuries in the incident. Actress Maureen O'Hara dies at 95 \nA woman suspected of drunken driving crashed a car into a crowd of spectators at Oklahoma State University's homecoming parade, killing three people, authorities in Stillwater said Saturday. \nAnother thirty-four people were injured, eight of them critically, according to a police spokesman. Seven of those eight were taken by helicopter to a hospital, while 10 spectators -- one critical and nine \"seriously injured persons\" -- were taken by ambulance. Another 17 \"walking wounded\" took themselves to the hospital, according to Capt. Kyle Gibbs. \nThe names of those killed and injured weren't immediately released. \nGibbs said the car's driver, Adacia Avery Chambers of Stillwater, was arrested at the scene on suspicion of driving under the influence and taken to the city jail. She is not believed to be an OSU student, he said. \nAccording to a police statement, Chambers drove her 2014 Hyundai Elantra into an unmanned police motorcycle before careening into the crowd of spectators. \nWhen asked by a reporter whether the 25-year-old Chambers was \"obviously intoxicated,\" Gibbs said, \"Certainly probable cause for the arrest, yes sir.\" \nGibbs said that Oklahoma state law mandates blood tests for any \"serious fatality accident.\" The results of those tests won't be known for several days, he said. \nThe deadly crash occurred at 10:31 a.m. (11:31 ET), just hours before the school's centerpiece homecoming event -- a football game between the nationally ranked, undefeated OSU Cowboys and the University of Kansas -- and only two blocks from the soon-to-be jam packed 50,000-person Boone Pickens Stadium. \nThe festive scene turned into one of horror, one the university president called a \"horrible tragedy.\" \n\"We are shocked and heartbroken by this horrible tragedy,\" said President V. Burns Hargis. \"The Oklahoma State University Homecoming parade is the most wholesome of events and to have it marred in such a way is incomprehensible.\" \n'People flying in the air' \n\"I can't describe it any more clearly than this: People flying in the air,\" OSU graduate student Paul Sims said of the moment of impact. \nAnother witness, Geoff Haxton, said he was about 100 yards from the crash site. \n\"All there was was smoke and panic. Half the emergency personnel in the county were here,\" Haxton said.\" People were running. (My) first instinct was to get my kids away from the street.\" \nTwo Stillwater Fire Department vehicles participating in the parade were among the scene's first responders, according to Tom Bradley, the city's fire chief. \nGame to go on \nAfter careful deliberation, officials decided to let the football game proceed, Hargis said. \n\"We're going to play, and we're going to remember the victims at the game, and we're going to move forward,\" Hargis said. \"But we will remember what's happened today.\" \nBefore the game, the OSU football team knelt in solemn prayer at the 25-yard line. \nFox Sports sportscaster Tim Brando described the pregame atmosphere as \"the kind of somber feeling\" that he'd never had before. But, he said, \"there is a game to be played, and a football team that is undefeated.\" \nTragedy familiar to OSU athletics \nCoping with tragedy is nothing new for Oklahoma State University's athletics department. \nIn 2001, a plane carrying the men's basketball team crashed in a snow storm in Colorado returning home from a game. Ten people -- including two players, a broadcaster and university personnel -- were killed. \nIn 2011, the women's head basketball coach and an assistant were killed in a plane crash in Arkansas. \n\"When something like this happens and, God forbid it happened again, we have to pull together as a family. We've got to try to do that,\" Hargis said after the 2011 crash. \nOn Saturday, he echoed those words. \n\"The Cowboy family pulls together. Unfortunately, we've had to do it before. We'll do it again.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:27:01.425+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
