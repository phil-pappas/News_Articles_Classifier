Ithaca had done next to nothing offensively, and the Pioneers seemed poised to score just their second victory over Ithaca in 15 all-time meetings. \nIn the end, they did, but it wasn't without a huge Bomber comeback try. \nIthaca scored 27 unanswered points, including a Max Rottenecker 30-yard field goal in overtime, but VanGalen hit Jerred Beniquez from 25 yards out on Utica's only play of OT and the Pioneers prevailed, 30-27, in an Empire 8 Conference clash before a crowd of 3,017 fans at Charles A. Gaetano Stadium. \nBomber junior quarterback Wolfgang Shafer fueled the comeback for Ithaca (3-1 overall, 1-1 Empire 8), throwing three touchdown passes in just over 7 1/2 minutes of game action. He got the Bombers on the board with a 5-yard pass to senior wideout Josh Oliver with eight seconds left in the third, then connected with senior tight end Kyle Hastings from 33 yards out and Oliver again from 31 yards away midway through the fourth to pull the visitors to within three. \nIthaca's defense, led by sophomore linebacker Kenny Bradley (9 tackles), forced four straight Utica punts over the final 15 minutes of regulation, after the Pioneers had punted just twice in their first 11 possessions. \nRottenecker tied it at 24 with a 35-yard field with 4:03 to play in regulation, then gave Ithaca a brief overtime lead. But on his team's first play in overtime, Beniquez made a leaping grab in the end zone over the outstretched arms of Ithaca safety Anthony Skretny to set off a wild Pioneers celebration in the end zone. \nUtica's only other victory over Ithaca came four years ago, a 20-15 decision in Utica. \nShafer finished the game 29-for-46 for 298 yards but was intercepted four times and sacked eight times. Three of those interceptions led to Utica touchdowns. Sophomore running back Tristan Brown led all ballcarriers with 73 yards on 16 carries for Ithaca; Oliver had nine receptions for 88 yards, both game highs. \nVanGalen was 18-for-30 for 254 yards and a pair of touchdowns for Utica, which lost a 47-40 overtime decision a week earlier to 25th-ranked SUNY Cortland. \nIthaca held Utica to 343 total yards, well below its average entering the game (476.8). \nThe Bombers hit the road again next Saturday, taking on Empire 8 foe Hartwick at 2 p.m. in Oneonta. Utica heads to Brockport for a 7 p.m. clash on Saturday. 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://ithacajr.nl/1RprpF0 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:42:30.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
