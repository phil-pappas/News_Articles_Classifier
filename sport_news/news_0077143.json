Created after the conclusion of the long-drawn-out General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) round of talks, it had widely been assumed that regional or bilateral trade agreements would now be a thing of the past. It was presumed that a framework had been created for global trade regulation and all progress on trade-related issues would be carried out under the aegis of the WTO. As a result of vastly diverging interests between developed and developing countries and even within these two groups, however, the WTO is losing its clout and effectiveness. The Doha Development Round launched in 2001 to focus on developing countries’ problems has been deadlocked for several years now. Little hope is being pinned on the Nairobi summit in December to reach any conclusion on long-pending issues like agriculture or industrial goods and services. In the meantime, most countries are justifiably not prepared to wait endlessly for these interminable negotiations to reach fruition. Roadblocks need to be removed urgently if trade is to become more free and thereby enabling higher economic growth. Regional trade agreements have become the only solution. The newest one on the block is the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) concluded earlier this month by 12 countries, including the US. The agreement is being scrutinised carefully as it covers an area with a population of 800 million people comprising 40 per cent of the world’s GDP. It is described as the largest regional trade accord ever signed in the world. Apart from the US, the other members are Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, Japan, New Zealand, Canada, Chile, Peru and Mexico. The US, the major driver in the TPP, is simultaneously carrying out negotiations for a parallel agreement with the European Union, known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), and is expected to follow the template of the TPP. The accord aims at slashing tariffs by 90 per cent within the 12-nation grouping and ultimately creating a unified market on the lines of the European Union. It has also covered ground on non-trade issues like intellectual property rights, causing concern among health advocacy groups like Medecins Sans Frontieres that this will lead to higher drug prices and harm growth of generic drugs output. Significantly, the agreement does not include China, evidently, a deliberate strategy to keep control of the group with the US. It also does not include India which has been keeping its focus both on the failing WTO as well as the proposed new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RECP) with ASEAN , along with five other countries, including China. The TPP, however, threatens to derail the effectiveness of both the WTO as well as other regional trade agreements and may ultimately become the template for future accords. In such a scenario, it is possible that countries like China would seek to be part of it and ultimately conform to the norms laid down by this large regional group. The question is, should India stay away from the TPP or instead try to become a member of this new trade agreement? There are varying views on the issue with the Peterson Institute for International Economics having weighed in by saying that India’s exports could rise by $500 billion annually if it joins the TPP. On the converse, it has said there could be an annual loss of $50 billion in case China and APEC join the TPP later. Textile exporters are anxious for India to join the grouping as staying out could harm growth in this sector. The TPP rules on zero duty access stipulate that even the yarn being used in the fabric of garments needs to be sourced from a member country. This could be a huge handicap for Indian textile and garments exporters which will then have to face duties of 14 to 30 per cent in major markets. On the other hand, the domestic pharma industry is already up in arms over the fact that the TPP takes a very different line on patents as compared to the WTO. Judging by reports, the group has sought to extend the patent life of drugs and make it easier to “evergreen” patents, thereby reducing the prospects for the entry of cheaper generic drugs into the market. Provisions like these have sparked severe criticism within the US. As a consequence, even presidential contender Hillary Clinton is backing down from supporting it while economists like Jagdish Bhagwati have criticised its “deplorable architecture”. Controversial as it may be, the TPP is here to stay. Countries like South Korea and Indonesia are already queueing up to become members to take advantage of the free market that will exist in this grouping. India also needs to consider the benefits of joining a large trade bloc that is now moving ahead more rapidly than any other till now. As for non-trade issues, it is quite likely that opposition within the US as well as other member countries may lead to alterations in the existing framework. Pragmatism and self-interest are the underpinnings of any country’s policy. It is thus imperative for India to make the move towards joining the TPP. And it should do so from a position of strength. Though it is an oft repeated and somewhat hackneyed truism by now, it is a fact that this is one of the world’s largest markets. The opening up of the market may be a slow process but for developed countries like the US and the EU, it will still be worth the wait. At the same time, India needs to revive the stalled talks with the EU on a free trade agreement while continuing the process of becoming part of the RECP in Asia. In other words, it needs to move quickly on multiple fronts to enter into regional trade pacts with the rest of the world. Unless it moves speedily in this manner to expand its trade horizons, it will be left far behind in the global trade race in the years to come.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:21:59.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
