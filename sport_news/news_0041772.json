His IQ of football is really high,\" said U-M receiver Maurice Ways, who battles Lewis in practice. \"He knows splits, alignments, he knows personnel, in terms of who he's going against, what their strengths are, what their weaknesses are. Athletic quick, heck of an athlete. A great corner.\"\nLewis, a junior from Detroit Cass Tech, won a starting job in the middle of last season and was the Wolverines' only certainty at the position entering this year. Junior Channing Stribling has become more consistent, and Jeremy Clark shifted from safety, giving U-M a potent rotation between the three of them this season.\nHighlighting Lewis was only part of PFF's look at the Michigan-Northwestern defensive battle Saturday at Michigan Stadium (3:30 p.m., BTN).\nThe website notes that U-M's defense ranks No. 3 nationally without a preseason All-Big Ten selection, and Michigan is the \"the only team with a top-three run defense and pass rush, according to our grades.\"\nIn other rankings, they have Chris Wormley and Maurice Hurst as the most impactful defensive linemen in college football.\nJabrill Peppers ranks 11th nationally among safeties.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nU-M stats soaring: No. 2 in overall, scoring defense\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nDurkinâ€™s imprint on U-M's defense is easy to spot\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nWriter: Michigan best team in Big Ten (right now)\nContact Mark Snyder at msnyder@freepress.com . at @mark__snyder.
