(AP Photo/Paul Beaty) (Paul Beaty) Comments \nAs the Toronto Blue Jays battle the Kansas City Royals for a spot in the World Series, one of their former rookies is fighting a much more important battle against cancer. \nDetroit Tigers lefthander Daniel Norris announced on his Instagram page today that he was diagnosed with thyroid cancer this summer while in the Toronto Blue Jays organization before his trade to the Tigers. \nNorris was the top prospect (along with Matt Boyd and Jairo Labourt) who was traded to Detroit in exchange for ace starter David Price at the trade deadline. \nIn the post, Norris said he opted to wait until the end of the season to have surgery. \nIn 13 major league starts between Toronto and Detroit this season, Norris posted a 3.75 ERA with 45 strikeouts and 19 walks.
