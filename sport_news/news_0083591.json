They host the Cubs on Saturday as the league championship series begins. LOS ANGELES — They stood around the mound in an intense huddle, conducting an animated conversation none of them anticipated, or desired, this early in the most important baseball game of their lives. Together, they came — the manager, concerned his ace was exhausted; the ace, convinced he was only just revving up; and the infielders, concerned the fate of the game hung in the balance.\nMaybe it did.\nHow else do you describe the moment, when under a darkening Los Angeles sky, a Mets crisis loomed.\nBottom of the third inning in this decisive Game 5 of the National League Division Series, already down a run, and with the Dodgers mounting another rally against a seemingly tired pitcher who’d just walked his second batter of the night, runners on first and second with one out. Chavez Ravine was rocking under the hopeful cheers of the home crowd, all of them wondering, waiting, whether Terry Collins was about to pull starter Jacob deGrom from the mound, perhaps opening the floodgate to a Dodger coronation.\nBut the manager had faith. The ace had grit. And the infielders? Well, they had belief — and a few hits in their bats, too. DeGrom stayed in the game, and with one pitch — a double-play grounder he started with his own glove — secured his place forever as a Mets hero, leading the team to a 3-2 win, pushing them into a National League Championship Series meeting with the Cubs.\nAt 27 years old with less than two years of major league experience, deGrom swapped a trademark near-100-mph fastball for a veteran’s guile and grit, pushing himself through six innings no Mets fan will soon forget, dancing on the edge of oblivion, runners all over the base paths, but none to cross home plate again. The cornstalk frame, the permanently flared nostrils, the bulging locks of hair busting out of his baseball cap already paint a memorable portrait. But his second win in this series, against the Dodgers’ two best pitchers, that is what painted a picture of celebration, an effort to set up the leaping last-out dance of closer Jeurys Familia and the ensuing mob of delirious Mets.\nDaniel Murphy deservedly led the way, because if deGrom was the one fighting on the mound, Murphy was his counterpart at the plate, a singular force of baseball nature willing these Mets toward another series. There was Murphy in the first inning, driving home Curtis Granderson with a deep double to centerfield, a misplay by the fielder allowing him to take third, a base-running flourish capped by Murphy’s batting helmet flopping by force onto the Dodger Stadium dirt.\nThere was Murphy in the fourth inning, leading off with a single, taking second on Lucas Duda’s walk and stealing third when the shifted Dodger infielders failed to get back and cover. It was a daring, dangerous play and, as it turned out, a brilliant one. One batter later, Travis d’Arnaud hit a foul ball fly out to right field, allowing Murphy to score the tying run.\nAnd then there was Murphy in the sixth inning, needing nobody’s help to change the course of the game, a line drive home run to right field giving the Mets the lead.\nMaybe Murphy won’t be here next year — he is a free agent at season’s end. But like the team he plays for now, he is a study in resilience, a player whose frustrating penchant for base-running blunders erased them all with one crazy steal on Thursday night. Like the manager he follows, he understood the stakes.\n“Every out means something. Every run is hard to get. So you just can’t give runs away,” Collins was saying before the game, an unknown prescience guiding his words. “Every day seems like it’s the last. There is no, ‘Hey, look, get through the day.’ You’ve got to break out anything you think might help you win this game tonight because tomorrow, if we don’t win, it’s all over with.”\nBut because they did, the journey continues, the dream lives on. The faith of a manager, the grit of an ace, the support of an infield made it happen.\nThese Mets flew west intent on extending their magical 2015 ride, determined to dip once again into the resolve that has defined their year, daring to believe this was too soon to bid goodbye to such a memorable year. They boarded their flight insisting they’d buried the disappointment of Tuesday’s potential clincher at home, that they’d already flipped the internal switch to the muscle memory of the Game 1 win in Los Angeles.\nThey believed in the hearty makeup of deGrom, in the patience of their unlikely slugger Murphy, in the calm yet coiled leadership of their skipper, Collins. They came confident they had more to conquer, convinced it was possible to be content with what they’d accomplished so far while simultaneously clawing for more.\n“Nobody wants to fly all the way across the country for one game,” Collins admitted in the aftermath of the Game 4 loss. “But I think that we’re as excited as we were the other night. Obviously, the first game was really impactful.\n“This is where you want to get. You want to get to postseason. Any time you’re down to win or lose, it’s a tough situation. There’s a lot of pressure on both teams. But I’ll tell you, I’m so proud of the way our guys made it through the season. This, to me, is gravy.”\nPour a little more on their, Terry. These Mets aren’t done eating.\nEmail: sullivan@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:08:35.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
