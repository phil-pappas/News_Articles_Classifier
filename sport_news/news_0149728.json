He played 18 games as a backup for the Raiders before getting released two months into the season. He joined the Cincinnati Bengals and played two games. \nThe Bengals released Bilukidi just before their first game of last season, but the Ravens inked him to a contract using the roster space vacated by Ray Rice. He appeared in four games for Baltimore last fall. \nAll told, Bilukidi has appeared in 24 NFL games and has notched 16 tackles, a sack and a defended pass attempt. \nBilukidi will have to clear NFL waivers on Sunday before becoming a free agent. Bilukidi's agent, Darren Gill, said they will wait to see what happens over the weekend before deciding how to proceed. \nNOT IN THE HUNT \nThe Detroit Lions on Thursday released defensive end Phillip Hunt, who played for the Bombers in 2009 and 2010, and led the CFL with 16 sacks in his second season before heading south to join the Philadelphia Eagles. \nHunt has also appeared in 24 NFL games as a backup since 2011, registering 24 tackles and four sacks for the Eagles and Lions. \nAccording to a source, however, it was just a temporary release due to roster shuffling. \nMISSING OUT \nThe Bombers are trying to avoid becoming just the fourth team in the last 20 years to miss the playoffs in the same year it is hosting the Grey Cup. \nThe last franchise that failed to qualify for the post-season in a hosting year was the Edmonton Eskimos in 2010, when they finished last in the West Division with a 7-11 record. Ottawa missed in 2004, while the Bombers also failed to make it to the post-season party in 1998 under Jeff Reinebold. \nIf Winnipeg misses the playoffs this year it will mark just the second time in franchise history they have failed to qualify four seasons in a row. \nHOMECOMING GAME \nThe Bombers don't have any Manitobans on their roster this year, so all of their road games are homecomings for some of their players. \nThat's usually the case in Vancouver more than anywhere else, and this year is no different. There are five Canadians on Winnipeg's roster who hail from B.C. this season, which is tied for the team high. There are also five players from both Ontario and Quebec. \nThe B.C. boys on Winnipeg's roster who made the trip home for Saturday night's game at BC Place were linebackers Graig Newman (Langley) and Jesse Briggs (Kelowna), offensive linemen Sukh Chungh (Port Coquitlam) and Matthias Goossen (Richmond), and defensive end Louie Richardson (Vancouver). \nCanadian cornerback Derek Jones also played his college ball in B.C., attending Burnaby's Simon Fraser University. \nTITLE IN SIGHT \nWinnipeg native and Lions running back Andrew Harris went into Saturday night's contest only seven yards behind Saskatchewan's Jerome Messam for the league rushing lead, and he had two games in hand. \nMessam mustered just eight yards on five carries against the Tiger-Cats on Friday night, giving him 826 yards in 15 games. Harris had 819 yards in 13 games prior to Saturday night's tilt with the Bombers, but he did have the advantage of a league leading 170 carries, which was 35 more than Messam had received. \n“That's the ultimate goal right now for me, other than the playoffs,” Harris said Friday. “That's something I haven't done in my career yet. I've been close a couple times and been right up there with a couple guys. So yeah, that's definitely something I want to accomplish and I'm working hard to get that.” \nkirk.penton@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:46:09.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
