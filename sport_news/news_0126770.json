(Photo: Steve Perez, Detroit News) \nDetroit — Dozens of Detroit King High School parents and supporters gathered outside the Detroit Public Schools administration offices at the Fisher Building on Monday to protest the decision to forfeit the PSL championship football game.\nKing, ranked the No. 1-ranked team in the state by The Detroit News, beat Cody, 20-2, in the PSL semifinals on Friday at DCP-Northwestern. After the game, a fight between players broke out and several players from both teams were involved. DPS police dispersed the melee with pepper spray, according to reports.\nAfter a review, the district announced Monday that the title game, scheduled for Friday at Ford Field, would be cancelled and Cass Tech was declared the winner.\nBut that decision is under review by DPS emergency manager Darnell Earley, who met with DPS executive director of athletics Alvin Ward on Tuesday morning.\n\"He understands the implications of this decision are very serious,\" said Michelle Zdrodowski, chief communications officer for DPS. \"He is in the process of reviewing the decision that's been as it relates to code of conduct and district policy to ensure that it followed both of those.\"\nKing coach Dale Harvel and Cody coach Calvin Norman both told The Detroit News on Monday that Harvel took steps to avoid any confrontations between players after the game.\nWard made the decision Monday to have King (8-0) forfeit the game said that there would be no appeal. But with Earley getting involved Tuesday, the review could produce a reversal.\nThe financial implications of cancelling the game are dire, especially for the cash-strapped district. The rental fee for Ford Field is in the tens of thousands of dollars, and although there were two championship games scheduled, a King-Cass Tech rematch would be one of the most anticipated games in the state this season.\nIn their first meeting this season, King beat Cass, also ranked among the top teams in the state, 31-28, in overtime.\nA rematch at Ford Field for the PSL title would attract a litany of college coaches and recruiters, as the two teams have several potential Division I prospects.\n\"(Earley) understands the magnitude of what has happened and the game on Friday but he also understands that rules have to be followed,\" Zdrowski said. \"We will issue a final decision once that review is complete.\"\nDETROIT NEWS\nKing forfeits shot at PSL title after brawl; Cass named champ\nKing parents met Monday night and decided to have the protest at the school administration offices to let their voices be heard.\n“We feel that the decision was too harsh and it was made too swiftly without all the information in and it wasn’t due process to come up with this decision,” said Dr. Cecil Forbes, who is the team physician and a King alumnus. “To expel the kids from school and to forfeit the game is just too harsh.”\nRod.Beard@detroitnews.com \nTwitter.com/detnewsRodBeard", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:19:08.347+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
