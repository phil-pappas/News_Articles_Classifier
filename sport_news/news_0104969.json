My track record entitles me to be considered. \n\"I'm ambitious and I still want the England job, but I have less chance now even though I'm better equipped to do it.\" \nRevealing the secret meeting with Beckham, who was then at Real Madrid, he said: \"David said 'the next manager needs to have experience to handle Champions League and World Cup games', but I didn't agree. \n\"I got on the front foot and asked David to lunch in Madrid ... he could see I was serious and I think I left having convinced him I could do it. \n\"He said if anybody at the FA asked him about me he wouldn't have a problem, but he didn't think he would have a say.\" \nAllardyce, who led Bolton to eighth place in the Premier League in 2006, once joked he would have been given a shot at a top-four club if his surname had been \"Allardici\". \nHe left West Ham in the summer and on Saturday signed a two-year deal at Sunderland.
