He explained in court that he was referring to other state immigration laws that his office was allowed to enforce at the time.\nArpaio also was asked about whether his immigration efforts were politically driven. \"It wasn't politics for me. I was trying to enforce the laws,\" he said.\nThe six-term sheriff also is being called into court for his office's failure to turn over traffic-stop recordings before the profiling trial and bungling a plan to gather the videos once they were publicly revealed.\nHe could face civil fines and possibly a criminal contempt case.\nOther subjects being examined at the hearings include allegations that Arpaio launched a secret investigation of the profiling case's judge in a failed bid to get him disqualified and that his officers pocketed personal items seized from people during traffic stops and busts.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:35:15.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
