We'll see.\"\nFour-time most valuable player James on Tuesday received an anti-inflammatory shot to ease discomfort in his back, a precautionary move which he said had become customary for him during the preseason.\n\"It was all part of the process,\" said James, an 11-time NBA All-Star. \"We had already known that, looking at the schedule, looking at the preseason, we were going to do that. It's all part of my maintenance program in the preseason.\"\nJames readily concedes that the Cavaliers, who were beaten by the Golden State Warriors 4-2 in the NBA Finals four months ago, will not be ready to start this season as genuine title challengers due to multiple injuries.\nKyrie Irving (knee surgery), Iman Shumpert (wrist surgery), Kevin Love (shoulder surgery), J.R. Smith (hamstring) and Matthew Dellavedova (sore ankle) are among those players who have either missed games or not played during the preseason.\n\"I don't think we will immediately be able to play at a high level because we have so many guys out,\" James said. \"I don't think our chemistry is where it needs to be to start the season off.\n\"I think as we get guys back into the flow of things, guys come back off of injury and we're able to put the time in on the practice floor, I think we'll be a much better team.\"\n(Reporting by Mark Lamport-Stokes in Los Angeles; Editing by Steve Keating )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:47:17.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
