Storylines galore? Look at college QBs in state of Utah Utah notebook: Fake punt return catching on elsewhere Utes back in the college football spotlight Two undefeated teams will clash Saturday night (8 p.m., ESPN) in Salt Lake City as the No. 23 California Golden Bears face the No. 5 Utah Utes .\n23\nThe 5-0 Cal Golden Bears come into Rice-Eccles Stadium ranked No. 23 in the country. It will be the second game of 2015 where Utah will face an opponent ranked in the Top 25, although two more current Top 25 opponents (USC and UCLA ) remain on the schedule.\n3\nThis weekend marks the third time that ESPN's \"College GameDay\" will make a stop in Salt Lake City. The last time Lee Corso, Kirk Herbstreit and the rest of the \"GameDay\" crew came to Rice-Eccles, Utah was ranked No. 5 in the country, and was facing a No. 3-ranked TCU team led by current Cincinnati Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton . Unfortunately for Utah, it was a 47-7 beat down by the Horned Frogs. The Utes will certainly be hoping for a different result this Saturday with all eyes on them.\n+39\nCal is led by quarterback Jared Goff, who is among the best in the country. The junior has thrown for 50 touchdowns — including 15 already this season — to just 11 interceptions in the last two seasons. That gives him a +39 difference in touchdowns to interceptions. Goff is considered by many to be the best NFL quarterback prospect in college football, and he has the numbers to back it up. He'll be facing the best defense he has faced all season when he faces Utah, and it should be a big test for both the Utah defense and Goff.\n43.4\nThe Golden Bears don't play much defense, but they can put the ball in the end zone. The Bears have averaged 43.4 points per game, including 73 points in Week 1 against Grambling State, and 45 against Texas in Week 3. Obviously, Grambling State is an FCS school and Texas has been a disaster, but it is still impressive to put up that amount of points against anybody.\n.444\nUtah and Cal have matched up nine times since 1920, and Cal has had the upper hand, winning five of those games. Most recently, though, Utah has won three of the past four matchups, including a 49-27 win back in their last meeting in the 2012 season.\n5-0\nThe Golden Bears will give Utah all they have, but the Utes will be 5-0 after Saturday night. The Utah front seven will make things very tough for Goff, and Utah's offense should continue rolling right along. A 5-0 start for Utah would be its first since 2010 when it started 8-0 before dropping three of its last five regular-season games.\nCJ Pronk is a Deseret Digital Media contributor and a Stansbury High School graduate.
