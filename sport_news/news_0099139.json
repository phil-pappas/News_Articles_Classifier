Rhodes is expected to be OK when the Vikings play Sunday at Denver. \nSendejo, however, has a knee injury and did not practice Wednesday. He was replaced by Robert Blanton after getting hurt in the game. Wide receivers Charles Johnson (rib) and Jarius Wright (hand) were also held out of practice, along with defensive end Justin Trattou (foot). \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:50:37.929+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
