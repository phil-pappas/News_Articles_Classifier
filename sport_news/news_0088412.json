The Douglas County sheriff was big on the Second Amendment and down on legal marijuana. Conservative Roseburg -- \"a red dot in a blue ocean,\" the local newspaper publisher called it last year -- liked that about Hanlin.\nHanlin's stances became world news Thursday after a 26-year-old man killed nine and injured nine others at Umpqua Community College before dying in a firefight with officers. In some circles, Hanlin was the hero sheriff who refused to speak the shooter's name . In others, he was the \"insane\" sheriff who had balked at gun control and shared a shared a video on Facebook, suggesting the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting was a hoax.\nAs President Barack Obama and pundits debated gun control laws, Hanlin, for once, refused to chime in.\nHanlin, 53, has spent half his life as a deputy, mostly in Roseburg. He was born in the Western Oregon town, the youngest of three kids raised by a forester and a department store worker . He grew up on a small ranch and \"had the same goofy flattop haircut that he has now,\" said Bud Smith, a retired Roseburg lawyer who has known Hanlin's family for 40 years.\n\"He was what every mother would want their son to be,\" Smith said. \"Just a very honorable and decent person.\"\nHanlin graduated in 1980 from Glide High School then worked for a few years in the Douglas Forest Protective Association while taking classes, like so many of his friends, neighbors and now constituents, at Umpqua Community College.\nHe left, briefly, in 1983 for Bend, where he earned an associate's degree from Central Oregon College in computer information systems. He returned home in 1986, and in 1989 began his multi-decade career with the Douglas County Sheriff's Office.\nWhen he first ran for sheriff in 2008, he did so, as Douglas County sheriffs have for 20 years, unopposed. Even without an opponent, he raised more than $24,000 , mostly from residents and construction companies. More than 37,000 voted for him.\nWith broad shoulders and a blonde crew cut, Hanlin looked the part of tough officer. But, in interviews with the Roseburg press, he praised deputies who \"talked to people like people.\" And he always smiled -- with teeth showing -- in his Facebook photos.\nHanlin was a typical Roseburg man, a Republican who spent his free time hunting, fishing and riding a Harley Davidson motorcycle to other rural communities.\nOn Facebook, he shared posts from Sarah Palin and The Tea Party, cartoons of the founding fathers befuddled at the idea of background checks for muskets.\nIn January 2013, a month after a 20-year-old shot 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary, Hanlin posted a conspiracy video that suggested the Newtown, Connecticut, tragedy might have been staged by the federal government to provide a pretext for \"disarming the public\" and that grieving parents were actually \"crisis actors.\"\n\"This makes me wonder who we can trust anymore,\" Hanlin wrote. \"Watch, listen, and keep an open mind.\"\nTwo days later, he posted a letter he said he had sent to Vice President Joe Biden.\n\"Gun control is NOT the answer to preventing heinous crimes like school shooting,\" he wrote.\nHanlin told the Roseburg News Review that his political views \"don't have a lot to do with providing public safety\" but that those beliefs, however controversial in Portland, have gotten him elected twice.\nDozens of Roseburg residents wrote to the Roseburg paper, supporting Hanlin.\n\"You go, Sheriff Hanlin,\" wrote Virginia Busch. \"This disgusting, fear-mongering, gun-toting, ignorant country bumpkin is proud to stand with you!\"\nA few months later, Hanlin posted a photograph from the Columbine shooting accompanied by a legislative testimony from the father of one of the victims: \"No amount of gun laws can stop someone who spends months planning this type of massacre.\"\n'LET ME BE VERY CLEAR'\nThough much of Hanlin's online activity centered on gun rights, Hanlin spent his in-person lobbying time fighting for his county.\nAs the federal government phased out timber payouts, Douglas County slashed the sheriff's budget, forcing Hanlin to choose between cutting his force and reducing the number of inmates lodged in the county jail.\nHanlin traveled to Salem in April 2013 to ask a legislative task force to extend the timber payouts. Already, property crime had \"skyrocketed,\" under the smaller force, he told lawmakers.\nLast year, as Oregon edged closer toward legalizing pot, Hanlin told the Roseburg News Review he believed marijuana was a gateway drug that had ruined one of his family member's life. On election night last November, the News Review reported Hanlin proudly showed a cell phone photo of his ballot: He had voted against an initiative to legalize marijuana sales.\nThis April, he again spoke out against gun control. When other law enforcement officials asked him to speak at a Salem hearing in just three hours, he immediately set off on the two-hour trip.\nHe sounded calm but convicted in what he said was an unprepared testimony : \"To expect local law enforcement to run down and do an investigation into whether or not a private individual has conducted a background check is nearly impossible,\" he told Oregon lawmakers.\nHis office, he explained, was too cash-strapped to even respond to everyday calls of domestic violence and vehicle crashes.\n\"People come up to me and say that they are proud to have him as a sheriff,\" Smith said. \"He's just somebody I'm really proud to watch grow up in our community.\"\nWhen Hanlin filed Monday , Sept. 28, for a third term, he told the Roseburg paper that his biggest challenge would be the budget cuts.\nThree days later, a gunman opened fire in an Introduction to Expository Writing class at Umpqua Community College.\nThursday evening, Hanlin took a firm stand.\n\"Let me be very clear,\" he said. \"I will not name the shooter. I will not give him the credit he probably sought prior to this horrific and cowardly act.\"\nBy the next morning, it was Hanlin's name dominating Twitter. Thousands shared screen shots from his Facebook, calling him \"treasonous\" and \"an ordinary redneck\" who \"dresses like a Nazi.\" Others called on Governor Kate Brown to remove Hanlin from his post.\nOf particular offense, they said, was the Sandy Hook conspiracy theory, a theory Hanlin told reporters Friday he did not believe.\nAt a morning press conference, Hanlin carried himself with the same calm he had in testifying before legislators. But this time, he did not share his convictions quite so loudly.\n\"Sheriff, you've come under attack yourself for being a strong Second Amendment advocate,\" one reporter said. \"How do you feel about the politicalization of this tragedy?\"\n\"My focus right now is on getting this investigation completed and taking care of the victims and the victims' families,\" Hanlin said. \"Now is not an appropriate time to have those conversations.\"\nTwo hours later, Hanlin walled up his Facebook, going as silent online as in person.\n-- Casey Parks\n503-221-8271\ncparks@oregonian.com; @caseyparks", "external_links": ["https://secure.sos.state.or.us/orestar/gotoPublicTransactionSearchResults.do?cneSearchButtonName=next&cneSearchFilerCommitteeId=12549&cneSearchContributorTxtSearchType=C&cneSearchFilerCommitteeTxtSearchType=C&sort=desc&by=TRAN_DATE&cneSearchPageIdx=1", "http://www.nrtoday.com/news/17393722-113/a-humble-hero-falls-deputy-donnie-martin-loses", "http://www.nrtoday.com/news/1990271-113/obituaries-obituariesivg-community", "https://twitter.com/caseyparks", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeTD-zezDNU", "http://www.nrtoday.com/news/4397135-113/hanlin-gun-letter-sheriff", "http://www.nrtoday.com/news/18419240-113/sheriff-hanlin-files-for-third-term"], "published": "2015-10-03T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:27:31.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
