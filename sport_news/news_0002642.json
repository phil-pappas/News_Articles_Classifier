McLellan still hasn’t made a final decision on who should be the first-line right winger. Now Eberle’s injury forces him to find an immediate replacement on the second line’s right side. \n“Ebs is a big part of our team and will be a big part when he comes back, but there’s nothing we can do about it,” McLellan said of the loss. “It’s the same song and dance from a coach — you lose a key guy and somebody else has to step up.” \nAt least this year there are some forwards who are actually stepping up. Leon Draisaitl and Anton Slepyshev have delivered excellent camps, with both looking sharp in their auditions as top-six right wingers. \nOf course, the Oilers haven’t faced a lot of staunch opposition so far in the pre-season, where most of their opponents have been thick with AHL prospects and thin on major-league talent. \n“There (have been strong showings) in exhibition season, which is a really good sign, that’s all we’ve been able to evaluate on,” said McLellan. “But when the real bullets starting flying we’ve got to see that elevation continue. We expect that to happen but we’ve got to witness it.” \nWith Ted Purcell back in the mix after missing two weeks with an injury, the Oilers have some options. Slepyshev, for one, has good wheels, a good shot and has really endeared himself to his teammates with his work ethic and ability. \n“I had a lot of fun playing with him last game,” said Taylor Hall. “He’s a guy who wanted to learn, who really wanted to work with his linemates. For someone who doesn’t know the language, that’s great. You see why he’s been captain on a national team. Guys like that are guys who are going to get an opportunity to fill for Ebs. So far he’s doing a great job.” \nDraisaitl, who seemed to be pegged for the AHL before camp began, has played his way back into the the picture in a big way. He’s adapted very well to the wing and becomes an attractive alternative for a lot of reasons, including the insurance he can provide as centre. \n“I think Leon was in a good position to keep pushing even before Jordan’s injury,” said McLellan. “He’s had a good camp. He’s shown an ability to play in different positions. \n“Now when we play this Vancouver team, which I think will be closer to an NHL-calibre team, we’ll get a better indication of how he handles that.” \nPurcell, who skated on the first line at the start of camp, practised Tuesday and is ready to take a spot. Where remains to be seen. \n“Our lines are in flux right now,” said McLellan. “It’s not an automatic that one individual will move into that spot. We’ll tinker with it and see what we come up with.” \nAs for Nail Yakupov, a right winger and former first overall draft pick, he doesn’t seem to be in the equation. \nFollow me on twitter.com/sun_tychkowski", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:25:52.466+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
