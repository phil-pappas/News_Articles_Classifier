Senior Jack Baumann, who set the Hannibal career scoring record earlier this season, scored four times against the Spartans. His third goal of the match, which came in the second half set the Pirates record for most goals in a single season. His fourth goal extended the record to 38. Meanwhile, sophomore Cory Allensworth recorded assists on three of his teammates’ scores, giving him the single-season record for assists with 24. Hannibal (15-8) was tied 1-1 with Battle at halftime before outscoring the hosts 3-0 in the final 40 minutes of play. On Saturday, Hannibal rallied to upend North Central Missouri Conference leaders Marshall on Saturday in Marshall. Hannibal (7-4 in the NCMC) defeated the hosts 3-2 to drop Marshall to 17-6 overall and 10-1 in league play. The Owls got on the board early in the first half when Marco Rodrigues scored to put his team ahead 1-0. Hannibal senior Heinrich Theune responded with the first of his three goals in the 23rd minute, however, to tie the match. Theune added his second goal two minutes later to give the Pirates a brief 2-1 advantage before Rodrigues knotted the score before halftime. The score remained tied before Theune completed his hat trick with a game-winning goal in the 66th minute. Theune, a foreign exchange student from Germany, now has 16 goals on the season. “He’s been huge,” Hannibal head coach Eric Hill said of Theune’s contributions. “He’s becoming a really important part of this team.” Hill wasn’t 100-percent sure, but said he believed Saturday’s win was his team’s first victory at Marshall since 2007. The coach was pleased with his team’s performances Saturday and Monday, and said his club’s recent string of success (four straight and five out of six) was a long time coming. “The guys played really well. You could just tell the team was growing throughout the year,” Hill said. “I think you could see the guys steadily coming along and growing together.” The Hannibal junior varsity squad lost to Marshall 4-0 Saturday before defeating Battle 4-0 Tuesday. Hannibal volleyball ends strong season at district tournament: A 21-7 season ended abruptly for the Hannibal High School volleyball team Monday. The Lady Pirates, seeded fourth in the Class 4, District 9 Tournament at Troy Buchanan High School, were knocked off by the hosts in the opening round of the tourney. Troy Buchanan (9-20-1) swept Hannibal 25-14, 25-20. Page 2 of 2 - “We didn’t deserve to win,” Hannibal head coach Kelsey Ortwerth said. “We played timid and uncontrolled. The girls are pretty upset, as am I. But we were outplayed.” Seniors Calen Bailey and Anna Murphy paced the Lady Pirates with three kills each. Murphy had a team-high six digs while Bailey added five. Senior Lauren Wheelan had four set assists and four digs, and sophomore Shelby Nelson led the squad with six blocks. Hannibal finished 21-8 overall.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:44:48.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
