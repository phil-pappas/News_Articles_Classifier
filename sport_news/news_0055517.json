(Photo: WLTX) \nColumbia, SC (WLTX) - A week ago, Steve Spurrier shocked the college football world when he announced his resignation as the head coach of the South Carolina Gamecocks . \nIt ended his 11-year tenure leading South Carolina, and in a broader view, his hall of fame coaching career that included a national championship at Florida. \nAnd while he's quick to point out that he merely resigned--and didn't retire from the working world--he's clearly at a crossroads in his life. News19's Alyssa Lang had a chance to speak to him about what he's been up to since the big announcement, what his future plans are, and just what he thinks of the new coach's idea to blast music during practices. \nAlyssa: So a week later, what's the temperature like for you? \nSpurrier: It's about what I thought. Gosh, I've been doing this 30 years or so as a head coach and I knew someday it had to end, and just really I believe and I'm convinced that a week or so ago was the best time to wind it up and turn the head coaching job over to one of our assistant coaches, which ended up being Shawn Elliott. I think he did a super job first week and everybody's happy and away we go. \nAlyssa: So you went through a weekend of watching football but not being directly involved. what was the feeling like were you missing it? Were you feeling the itch? \nSpurrier: No I don't think so. I knew that the time would come that hey, you gotta hang it up, your coaching career is finished. And I really felt that way. So no I have no regrets or anything, no lookbacks. I did have a chance to go up to the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Gameday. ESPN invited me up there. And I really went just to see the University of Michigan, the Big House there, and after going up there and being on the sideline and talking to [Michigan] Coach [Jim] Harbaugh and also Coach [Mark] Dantonio of Michigan State, and just looking around, 100,000 people, bands, cheerleaders...I realized college football is just a big, big business, and it's really serious about who wins and loses. \nAlyssa: So has your viewpoint kind of changed now that you've been able to be an outsider? \nSpurrier: Yeah, it changes a little bit. When you're coaching or when you're a player, your minds just on what you've gotta do to try and win the game, to be successful. So I always would just come to the stadium and have my list of ballplays, try to get them in there the best way possible. \nAlyssa: So what was the experience like this weekend, being behind the desk, talking about it rather than on the front lines? \nSpurrier: I sort of prepared for this so it wasn't anything too shocking. \nAlyssa: As far as your family and the people around you how do you think they're feeling, how's the reaction been from them a week later? \nSpurrier: Oh I think everyone's been about what you'd expect. You know, congratuations on a really good coaching career, and sort of 'what are you going to do next' is always the next question. But there's plenty of time to figure out what's next. But I'll definitely have something planned. Like I said I'm resigning as head coach here at South Carolina, but I'm not retiring from life. There's more to life than just coaching football. So I'm looking forward to that next adventure. \nAlyssa: What do you think that next adventure is? \nSpurrier: I don't know, Alyssa, I really don't have any idea. I'm sort of in off-season and we'll see as it goes. \nAlyssa: Is there a bucket list? Like, I've always wanted to do this in the fall but I've had football so I haven't been able to do it. Are there a list of things that you want to be able to do now? \nSpurrier: My wife and I, Jerri, we enjoy traveling. In fact I've got to get my passport updated, I've only got one more year on it. But travel, see the world, see the country, things of that nature. But I'll find something that hopefully will get my interest, something that I'll try to be good at.
