They also broke a 28-game winless streak against Heath on Sept. 29. \n\"We didn't win all (four games), but we pulled some victories out of that,\" coach Judd Bone said. \"I would rather end on that. I told them from Day 1 let's not look at the beginning of the season, let's move forward.\" \nThe Generals have clearly moved forward and improved and although they were outmatched in the first half trailing 3-0 at the break, a goal by Allyssa Grove from about 30 yards out put the Generals on the board in the second. \nThat goal represented more than a point on the scoreboard. On Senior Night, a game typically spent reminiscing on memories, Grove's goal pointed to the future. It speaks volumes about the improvement and potential the Generals program has. \n\"At the beginning of the year, they would've never thought about taking that shot or to have the confidence to know that they can score on corner kicks,\" Bone said. \nBut Monday's loss also showed places where the Generals must improve before their playoff game against John Glenn and before next year. \n\"Our downfall all year has been recovering after a goal,\" Bone said. \"If a team punches one in early, it really affects our mentality and trying to bounce back from that has been our achilles heal all year.\" \nAnd against Harrison Central, the same was true. The energy was there early in the game and on the field, but once Harrison Central scored 10 minutes into the game things changed. \nThen when Grove scored things changed again, the girls were loud and excited once again. \n\"All of these girls have more in them than what they know,\" Bone said. \"We have to get these girls to play at the ability they have and not the ability they think they have.\" \nThe Generals started putting together the pieces a little late to make a difference this season, but seen through the goals allowed, and mistakes made by an improving, yet inexperienced team Monday were glimpses of potential and hope. Now they need to build on it for the future. \n\"It's been our goal to keep getting better every week,\" Bone said. \"We finally hit our stride there a couple weeks ago and unfortunately we just couldn't put it together today.\" \ncteaguerob@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T13:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T16:15:00.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
