The Red Sox selected the ShoreTel solution for its robust feature-set, virtualized platform, redundant network architecture, ease of management and the ability of the system to grow with the organization.\nWorking closely with ShoreTel partner Harbor Networks ®, the team purchased the ShoreTel IP-PBX solution with integrated unified communications, ShoreTel Enterprise Contact Center, ShoreTel Conferencing, and ShoreTel Mobility. When fully installed by the start of the 2016 baseball season, the system will support 700 phones, with many of the Red Sox employees using the ShoreTel Mobility offering. In Boston , the Red Sox will install a ShoreTel solution at their Fenway Park® front office and call center operations, in Boca Raton, Fla. at their parent company office, and in Ft. Myers, Fla. at JetBlue Park®, home of their spring training facility.\n\"The goals for our new communications system are to improve employee productivity and efficiency, simplify maintenance and reduce costs – we're confident ShoreTel will meet all of these requirements and more. I estimate we'll save at least $25,000 per year on managed services costs alone,\" said Brian Shield , vice president of technology for the Red Sox. \"The robust ShoreTel contact center solution is key to our success – we're excited to have call analytics and management tools that will help us limit hold times, more efficiently direct calls to sales, and integrate with our Microsoft Dynamics® CRM system. We are driven to understand our customers and the fan experience, and with ShoreTel we expect to make that experience even more positive.\"\nShoreTel Mobility will be another key efficiency-booster for the team. \"With so many traveling personnel, we need mobile phones to be an extension of the office, and ShoreTel Mobility will be critical to making staff as productive as possible,\" comments Shield.\nShield is looking forward to reduced administration time with the new system as well. \"The ability to have leading-edge telephony that is easy to administer without adding new staff is a win-win,\" he says.\n\"The Boston Red Sox are leveraging the power of ShoreTel's integrated UC system, contact center and mobility application to streamline communications and improve employee productivity regardless of location,\" said Mark Roberts , chief marketing officer at ShoreTel. \"With customers that range from small businesses to universities to professional sports teams, ShoreTel is committed to providing reliable, flexible solutions that allows businesses to seamlessly communicate and collaborate internally and externally.\"\n\"All of us at Harbor Networks are huge fans of the Boston Red Sox and of ShoreTel,\" said Greg Bertschmann , president of Harbor Networks. \"We are thrilled to be the trusted provider of this best in class technology to a championship organization like the Red Sox.\"\nThe Red Sox are the fifth professional baseball team to select ShoreTel for their UC needs, joining the San Francisco Giants, Los Angeles Dodgers, Cleveland Indians and Miami Marlins.\nAbout ShoreTel, Inc.\nShoreTel, Inc.
