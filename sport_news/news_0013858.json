If you commit total body, mind and soul... If you devote the necessary amount of time, effort and energy... If you are prepared to play the hand that is dealt to you... Then you will be successful,” John Adkins. One runner that has taken that quote to heart is Duncan Clark. Clark is turning in an impressive senior year, nothing that surprises his coach. “Duncan came off a very good track season and ran deep into the month of May,” Kirksville coach Geoff Hutton said. “He basically didn’t take a lot of time off between track season and cross country.” Clark competed at the state track level last season but instead of taking time off during the summer, he went right back into training for cross country. “I put more miles in over the summer and got a bigger base in. I just kept training and kept pushing myself to get better every day,” Clark said. “Over the summer, I put in more faster paced stuff than I had in the past. I tried to go out and do several workouts where I tried to hit certain paces and faster times than I normally would run.” Clark would put in over 500 miles over the summer in preparation for this season but it wasn’t the quantity of miles that helped, it was the quality of the miles he put in. “This was a summer where he figured out that it didn’t matter how many miles he ran but it was what he put into those miles. It’s probably the first summer he had a lot more quality miles instead of the quantity of mile,” Hutton said. Ever since Clark’s freshman year, Hutton had a feeling that this type of season was on its way. “Duncan is really a student of the sport. He understood as a freshman where he needed to improve and what his limitations were,” Hutton said. “Over the course of his career he’s grown up, improved his core strength, trained a little bit better and understood how to race with people.” Last season, Clark ran the state cross country race and finished 14th with a time of 16:52. This season, Clark is looking to improve that and with a personal best of 16:27, he’s well on his way to doing that on Nov. 7 during this year’s state cross country race. Clark has just two more races this year before the state race, with his next being the Mexico Autumn Classic on Oct. 20. Page 2 of 2 - “I’m looking forward to getting back to state and see how I stack up this year compared to the other competitors, and improve my place and time in state,” Clark said. Clark points to Hutton as being someone who has really helped him with the success he’s had over his career. “He’s been a great coach and he’s taught me a lot. He’s helped me push myself to do harder workouts that I thought I couldn’t do,” Clark said. Hutton will miss one of his better runners after he graduates from the program in the spring, but knows that Clark will move on to help another program with his work ethic and talent. “I think Duncan is going to get to continue running at the next level. Right now, we’re looking for a solid finish in the cross country season and have a break. Then, we’ll have a solid preseason getting ready for track season,” Hutton said. “Hopefully, we can send him on to another program where he can help them out.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:43:03.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
