We put our all into it, Polly pumped most of the race. So we were happy to at least go out on a solid race.\" \nThe Olympic champions return to New Zealand from a busy schedule. They have had consistent performances without being able to dominate an increasingly competitive class and know there is work today ahead of Rio 2016. \n\"It's been a long year. We started in Miami on the 9th of January and we can't really remember any real breaks since then. It just feels like we have pushed a little too hard for a little too long,\" Aleh conceded. \n\"We have come away from this week with some great learnings, clearer than ever before. So there are some big pluses for us in the greater scheme. \n\"We are looking forward to next year, to some training at home over the summer and getting back to where we need to be going into Rio.\" \nThe New Zealand men's crew of Paul Snow-Hansen have finished the regatta 12th. Ad Feedback \nMeanwhile, light conditions in Bermuda saw the opening day of racing at the America's Cup world series event abandoned. \nWinds never reached the 6 knots limit required for racing, meaning a frustrating start to the weekend for Bermuda which is looking for its first America's Cup action ahead of hosting the main event in 2017. \nThe world series organisers have decided to add a third race now to the second and final day now. \nAll three races will carry double points, adding pressure to the final event of the year with 60 points on offer. \nTeam New Zealand lead the series on 72 points followed by Britain's Ben Ainslie Racing on 65 with cup holders Oracle (US) on 64. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:19:38.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
