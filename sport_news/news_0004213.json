Jon Bostic found himself injured too often. Brock Vereen lacked an element of toughness and failed to earn his keep on special teams.\nAll three players were discarded this week, each under different circumstances. Allen and Bostic were traded Monday to the Panthers and Patriots, respectively. Vereen was waived a day later.\nSo as the Bears returned to Halas Hall on Wednesday to intensify their Week 4 preparations for the Raiders, the recent surge of roster activity had players' attention. This week's moves, several veterans said, became another reminder of the performance-based stakes of the league.\n\"That's the way it should be with everyone,\" safety Antrel Rolle said. \"Everyone should hold themselves accountable. This is a week-to-week, performance-based, what have you done for me lately business.\"\nGeneral manager Ryan Pace's decision to move a five-time Pro Bowl playmaker and two recent draft picks were neither scare tactics nor a sign of surrender. As much as anything, they were evidence that the Bears will actively seek to mold and reshape their team to the big-picture vision.\nTight end Martellus Bennett, naturally, offered up the most colorful analogy, likening Pace's recent wheeling and dealing to a massive road construction project.\n\"Sometimes it takes you longer to get home,\" Bennett said. \"But when they finish the construction, it's smooth sailing all the way. (At the time), you hate the construction. But later, you're like, 'Man, I'm glad they fixed that road.' That's kind of like what it is right now.\"\nBear Download: Outside linebacker competition The Tribune's Rich Campbell and Dan Wiederer break down the Bears' linebacker situation.\nThe Tribune's Rich Campbell and Dan Wiederer break down the Bears' linebacker situation.\nSee more videos Amid the roster turnover, the Bears also understand they must find ways to win. Across the locker room, players echoed similar messages, noting that the 0-3 start would help separate the fighters from those who weren't all in.\n\"I think you see who's willing to work and you find out who has character,\" linebacker Lamarr Houston said.\nDefensive lineman Jeremiah Ratliff agreed.\n\"But,\" Ratliff added, \"talking isn't going to do anything. So we go out and just work. Period. Work harder than you worked before. Make it noticeable. Make your whole team see it. Make them follow it. Make them believe. That's what we have to do. Period.\"\nCutler practices: Jay Cutler returned to practice Wednesday as a limited participant, still working through the hamstring strain he suffered during the first half of a 48-23 loss to the Cardinals on Sept. 20. What that means for Cutler's potential to start Sunday against the Raiders, however, remains fuzzy.\nCutler may still be a bit of a long shot to return to his starting role this week. If he can't, Jimmy Clausen would start again.\nStill, coach John Fox said he felt encouraged by Cutler's work Wednesday.\n\"I thought he had a good practice,\" Fox said. \"He was limited. Obviously we're trying to treat him and get him better as we move forward. But I thought we had a good day today.\"\nInjury updates: After missing the last two games with a hamstring issue, wide receiver was a limited participant in Wednesday's practice. Also limited were Ratliff (ankle) and defensive ends Will Sutton (elbow) and Ego Ferguson (knee).\nPunter Pat O'Donnell (right knee) and offensive tackle Jermon Bushrod (concussion) sat out Wednesday.\nBarring a setback, O'Donnell should be ready for Sunday, though the Bears have a short list of emergency replacement options.\ndwiederer@tribpub.com\nTwitter @danwiederer\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears Martellus Bennett Jared Allen Ryan Pace Jermon Bushrod Lamarr Houston NFL Pro Bowl", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c87dd/turbine/ct-bears-download-outside-linebacker-video-spt-20150930", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c7203/turbine/ct-bears-roster-turnover-bits-spt-1001-20150930-10"], "published": "2015-10-01T15:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:03:23.791+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
