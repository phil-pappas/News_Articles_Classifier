What he needs are the old people.” \nJackson is 58 and retired, a former minor league baseball player and construction worker but back at the turn of the millennium was part of a regular group of athletes who would congregate at Darby Park in Inglewood, Calif., for fiercely contested games of streetball. Heat's Dwyane Wade, Erik Spoelstra emotional discussing Lamar Odom \nThat is where he first met Odom, then a gangly 20-year-old with a killer smile that stayed in place even when he was dishing out the kind of trash talk that accompanied every play in frenetic battles. \n“Back then he looked like he didn’t have a care in the world,” Jackson told USA TODAY Sports. “But Hollywood got into him and it took him away from where he felt comfortable.” \nJackson and Odom did not have a friendship of particular tightness, more one of familiarity. Yet Jackson went down to the medical facility, where Odom was moved to on Tuesday following a three-day binge allegedly involving cocaine and sexual-performance enhancers, on behalf of a community of Los Angeles-based ballers to whom the now-stricken 35-year-old was just one of the guys. Kardashians leave hospital as Lamar Odom remains in coma \nWhile outside the hospital, Jackson fielded calls and messages from California, as rumors hardened that Odom’s condition was worsening. \nIt would be both difficult and callous to criticize the Kardashian family’s handling of the situation and Jackson himself appreciates that the surrounding media circus made a restrictive policy on visitors necessary. \n“You just don’t know what is going to happen,” he said. “But I know that it is a shame that there is no one up there who ran with Lamar at Darby Park or was his friend before everything crazy happened in his life and he got wrapped up in showbiz. \n“If I could get up there I would speak for everyone back in L.A. Just give him some straight talking, just like we always did if someone had messed up. That’s what he will need to hear if he gets out of this thing, not people just saying ‘yes’ all the time. But he’s got to make it first.” \nPHOTOS: Lamar Odom through the years", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:50:18.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
