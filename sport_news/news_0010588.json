Trailing 4-1 early in the third period, the Minnesota Wild scored four times in a span of 5:07 to take the lead and went on to a 5-4 victory over Colorado on Thursday night at the Pepsi Center. \nZach Parise's hat trick was the impetus for the Wild, which looked to be on the ropes after two periods, when the Avalanche had the big lead on the strength of goals from Jarome Iginla, Erik Johnson, Gabe Landeskog and John Mitchell. \n\"We were really, really good for what, 45 minutes? Even the start of the third I thought we were solid, kept the puck deep. And then all of a sudden they scored that second goal, and the momentum shifted. We just couldn't stop it. It's a good and they certainly deserve credit for what they did in the last 15 minutes,\" said Patrick Roy. \nWATCH: Can the Avalanche make the playoffs? \nThe Avs had hoped this was ominous: After having the second-worst power play in the NHL last season, Colorado's first power-play goal of the 2015-16 came only seven seconds into its first manpower advantage of the season. It also was shortly after Parise rang the puck off a post on a breakaway against Semyon Varlamov following a Nathan MacKinnon turnover, keeping the game scoreless. \nAfter the Wild's Jonas Brodin was called for holding, MacKinnon won the faceoff and got the puck back to Tyson Barrie at the right point, and then Iginla beat Minnesota goalie Devyn Dubnyk with a one-timer from the left circle.

Beauchemin fired the puck wide of the net, hoping for a fortuitous carom off the end boards, and that's exactly what happened. Landeskog, the Avs' young captain, was unattended just to Dubnyk's right and directed the carom in the net. \nThe Wild got within 3-1 on Parise's shot from the slot at 6:55 of the second, but the Avs responded, with Mitchell knocking the rebound of Johnson's shot from the top of the right circle past Dubnyk at 8:07 to make it 4-1, and that was where it stood after two periods. \nThen the Avs fell apart. The opening-night party was ruined. \nMinnesota kept battling, and Parise's second goal made it 4-2 before Nino Niederreiter's score at 7:05 — which appeared to come after the Wild should have been called for icing — got Minnesota within 4-3. \nThomas Vanek, taking advantage of a Matt Duchene turnover and tied it at 9:18. Then Parise scored again at 10:14 to put Minnesota ahead. \n\"In the third period, I should have stepped up and stopped those shots,\" said Varlamov, who faced 30 shots. \"It was a tough third period. It's hard to say what was happening, I don't know. ... I can say I should have played better.\" \nThe Avs lost to the Wild twice to open last season, 5-0 at Minnesota and 3-0 in Denver. That ultimately foreshadowed a 4-8-5 start from which the Avalanche didn't recover. \nMitchell said: \"Well, I guess you would call that a collapse. You're in a good spot going into the third period and you know they're going to come out hot, they're going to try and throw everything at the net. At that point, we have to do what we did in the first two periods, move our feet, chip pucks in, get on the body, get some forechecking going. We got away from that.\" \nThursday's loss made the Avalanche 12-5-3 in home openers since the franchise moved to Denver from Quebec City in 1995. \nTerry Frei: tfrei@denverpost.com or @tfrei Get sports news and updates right in your inbox \nSign up to receive news alerts and a daily roundup of all things Colorado sports delivered to your inbox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:51:58.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
