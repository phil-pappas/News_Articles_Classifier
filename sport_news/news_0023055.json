I’ve got to show up and bring him what I’ve got.” \nGruninger squared off with Moose Jaw’s Landon Quinney in a spirited second period tilt that few of the 5,000-plus Oil Kings fans would have seen coming, considering Gruninger had amassed a mere 12 penalty minutes in his first 34 career WHL regular season games. \n“He obviously felt like he needed to address something, and good for him,” said Edmonton coach Steve Hamilton.”It’s his first fight in the league, and fighting’s not a big part of the game anymore, but I think it’s important to understand that you can do it, it’s part of being confident in yourself and handling your own business if it ever comes to that.” \nThe bout could be called a split decision; Gruninger (17-years-old, six feet tall, 177 pounds) and Quinney (17, 5-11, 195) were still throwing punches after they’d fallen to the ice and the official was trying to break them up. \n“Heading to the box, I was asking (Quinney), and he said that was his first fight too, so I said, ‘There’s no better way for our firsts to be against each other’,” said Gruninger. “It’s not bad, I thought, for our first.” \nGruninger’s coach and veteran teammates certainly thought so. The game was tied 1-1 at the time, and though the Oil Kings would go on to lose 3-2, they credited the second-year winger with giving their bench a momentary spark. \n“That takes a lot of bravery to step up like that and he was trying to get energy for the boys,” said Edmonton captain Brandon Baddock, a 20-year-old who is no stranger to fisticuffs, having fought more than 20 times in his career. “Huge kudos to him, that was awesome.” \nJabs and roundhouses are just the latest of many items in Gruninger’s toolbox. After dressing for just 28 games as a rookie in 2014-15, when he recorded 3 goals and 2 assists, Gruninger’s quickly emerging as a reliable two-way everyday player this season. He’s already played seven games, including five of the last six since forward Brayden Brown departed Edmonton after requesting a trade a week and a half ago. \n“Progression-wise it’s been going good lately, and and I’m just trying to get better every game ,every night I’m in,” said Gruninger, who has two assists so far this season. “I just try to play my part and if (fighting) is part of my game, then sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesn’t. You’ve just got to keep going with whatever happens.” Edmonton Oil Kings forward Tyson Gruninger shows he's no pushover By Brian Swane , Edmonton Sun First posted: Sunday, October 18, 2015 09:26 PM MDT | Updated: Sunday, October 18, 2015 09:32 PM MDT \nThere had been but a lone fight in the Edmonton Oil Kings’ first nine games this season, before the second came from a rather unlikely source. \nActually, make that a heretofore unlikely source, because after having his first career scrap on Saturday, Tyson Gruninger doesn’t sound like a player who his gloves for the last time. \n“I know my role on the team, and fighting’s part of the game and I’d say fighting’s probably part of my role: being physical (and) get in guys’ kitchens,” said the forward from Drayton Valley. “Guys not liking me is pretty much one of my main goals out there, so if some guy wants to fight me I can’t really back down.
