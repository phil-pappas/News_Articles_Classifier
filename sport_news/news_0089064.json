The Royals forced the decider at Kauffman Stadium by rallying from a four-run deficit in the eighth inning Monday at Houston.\nThe Astros will counter with Collin McHugh , who threw a gem in winning the series opener.\n“Obviously this is the deciding game,” Cueto said through a translator after the Royals worked out Tuesday afternoon. “We either win and stay or you go home.”\nCueto has long been considered one of the game’s dynamic pitchers, his herky-jerky style often giving hitters fits. He was an All-Star a year ago with Cincinnati, and finished second in Cy Young voting in the National League , a big reason the Royals were so keen to get him.\nBut when it comes to the playoffs, things have been a struggle. Cueto is 0-2 with a 5.52 ERA in four postseason starts, including a pedestrian outing in Game 2 against Houston.\nThe Royals have won nine of their past 10 elimination games, and now have momentum on their side. Their rousing comeback to force the series back to Kansas City drew comparisons to their comeback against Oakland in last year’s wild-card game, when they dug out of a similar four-run hole in the eighth inning against Jon Lester and the A’s.\nThe situation right now? Solving a pitcher who shut them down less than a week ago.\nMcHugh allowed two runs — both on homers by Kendrys Morales — and six hits over six innings against the Royals in Game 1, shrugging off a 49-minute rain delay in the process. With a vicious slider and unflappable confidence, he calmly took care of a potent Kansas City lineup.\nThat placid demeanor was still there Tuesday, 24 hours from the biggest start of his career.\n“I don’t know how I come off to other people,” McHugh said. “It’s always interesting. I have to ask my wife a lot how I look to other people. She usually gives me honest feedback.”\nWhile he may not be as recognizable as Cueto, the right-hander who bounced through the Mets and Rockies systems before landing in Houston has been every bit as tough. He won 19 games during the regular season, and has won his last six decisions overall.\nIn fact, when Houston manager A.J. Hinch was asked whether he could use star pitcher Dallas Keuchel on three days’ rest in relief, he replied: “Not if McHugh pitches the whole game.”\nClearly, the Astros aren’t lacking any confidence after their Game 4 meltdown.\n“I know pouting and being negative and dwelling on the past is not going not help us,” Hinch said. “We’re in Game 5 of the division series with a chance to control our own destiny. It can’t get any better than that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T05:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:22:12.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
