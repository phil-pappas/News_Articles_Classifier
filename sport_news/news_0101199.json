AP FILE PHOTO Knicks head coach Derek Fisher. (AP File Photo/Matt Slocum) \nFisher has found himself in the center of an embarrassing episode after flying to Los Angeles following the team’s workout Saturday at West Point, and hours later being involved in an altercation with his former teammate and current Memphis Grizzlies player Matt Barnes in a dispute over Fisher being at the home of Barnes’ estranged wife, Gloria Govan. \nAfter discussing it vaguely Wednesday, Fisher was reluctant to expand on the details that have surfaced since then with the New York Post reporting that Barnes drove up from the Grizzlies’ training camp in Santa Barbara when his children called him and told him that Fisher was in the home, and TMZ.com writing that an eyewitness said Barnes came into the backyard where Fisher was and punched him in the mouth, the two fighting until the children begged them to stop. \nFisher stuck to his story that he flew cross-country to see his children, who live there with his wife, whom he filed for divorce from in March, and that he missed Monday’s practice at the team’s practice facility because of plane trouble. The story seems curious since there was the option of a commercial flight and assistant coach Kurt Rambis said Monday that he was unaware of Fisher’s absence until shortly before the practice session and he certainly would have been able to have been made aware if Fisher was stuck in Los Angeles. \nThe episode, with the departure, the missed practice and the involvement with Govan, a reality television star who was the wife of his friend, has raised questions about Fisher’s focus and judgment, questions that would be asked if it was a player who missed a practice for this sort of incident. \n“That’s understandable,” Fisher said. “But I think we all remember there are a ton of people that work in New York City that have families in other cities or back on the West Coast. You work six days, you have a seventh day off. You go back and visit family. You come back to work on Monday morning. That was my plan. It didn’t work out that way for reasons that were not in my control and I can’t change it at this point.” \nFisher said he has spoken with Knicks president Phil Jackson about the incident, but would not divulge any details or the tone of the conversation. And he hoped again that the attention would go away. \n“I’m basically done, kind of, I guess talking about the situation directly,” Fisher said. “You know, last night what I said just about personal and private things stand that way, at least from comments from me. It’ll stay that way for me. The process is the process. That’ll play out. As far as me commenting on it I won’t be. That’s about as much as I’ll say.” \nFisher would not say if there would be legal ramifications, but the Redondo Beach (Calif.) Police were called to the scene. \nAt Grizzlies practice, Barnes told reporters, “We were friends. We were good friends at one point. .. It's a personal matter. My focus is on basketball. Being here early, I don't want to start it off by having anything negative.” \nFor his part, Fisher, who stressed character to his team throughout last season, and he and Jackson pushed to rid the roster of players who they felt didn’t measure up, would not address if he felt he had done something wrong. \n“I appreciate the question honestly,” Fisher said. “But it’s still something I can’t comment on until the situation or the process plays completely out. If I decide to or have the opportunity to address it later I guess I will. At this point that’s probably not the right thing to do. \n“I guess distraction is subjective, and it’s only what we allow to be a distraction,\" he added. \"Personal and private things happen in people’s lives, good and bad sometimes. It’ll remain that way as far as commenting and making statements publicly. For now, that’s all I can say and will say. It’s just about from a basketball perspective that our team’s still going out and playing games and doing what they need to do. They can’t control what’s happened. I can’t control it at this point, so we just focus on playing basketball and doing our job, and that’s what we’ll do.” \nEmail: popper@northjersey.com © 2015  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:26:41.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
