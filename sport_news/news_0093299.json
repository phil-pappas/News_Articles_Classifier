He was booked in Washington County early Friday morning, Lt. Henry Reimann said.\nPolice say Jackson and his older brother, Vance Roberts, kidnapped prostitutes, drove them to Roberts' home in Hillsboro and held them captive for days.\nAfter the brothers' 1990 arrest, their mother bailed them out, and they vanished. With no explanation, Roberts surrendered in 2006. Roberts was convicted in 2007 and is now serving a 108-year prison sentence for his crimes.\n-- Emily E.
