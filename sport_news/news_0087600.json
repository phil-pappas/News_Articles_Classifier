When each of the students told him they had already bought their tickets to Saturday's homecoming game against Wisconsin, a smile widened across his face. It’s the same smile he wears when he hears fans vocalizing the ‘I-L-L’ chant in the middle of an airport outside the state. “I think that’s kind of neat, people coming up to you who really enjoy watching this football team,” Cubit said. “There’s excitement out there.” Different feel At this point last year, excitement was hard to find. Entering the second half of the 2014 season, Illinois was 0-2 in the Big Ten and coming off a demoralizing home loss to Purdue, which finished the year winning three games. It was the Illini’s 17th conference loss in 18 tries since 2012. But this year the Illini can hold their heads a little higher with one Big Ten win already under their belts as they take on the Badgers at Memorial Stadium to open the second half of the season. Illinois (4-2 overall, 1-1 in the conference) has lost quite a bit more than its record would suggest. Not counting the firing of coach Tim Beckman prior to the start of the season, key members absent on the field today will include Josh Ferguson, Justin Hardee, Mike Dudek and Marchie Murdock — all impact players who are out due to injuries. Murdock, who also missed the Illini’s 29-20 loss to Iowa on Oct. 10, is the most recent loss to an offense starving for depth at wide receiver. To replace Murdock, freshman Dez Cain will make his first career start for Illinois. “We’ve definitely simplified it a lot, especially with these young wideouts,” starting quarterback Wes Lunt said. “I think when we put less in the playbook, we play fast and the receivers respond pretty well.” Wisconsin (5-2, 2-1) could also be missing a major piece of its offense should an injury force the Badgers to play without tailback Corey Clement, who has missed the past six games with a sports hernia. Clement, who is hopeful to return today, carried the ball eight times for 16 yards in the season opener before his injury forced him to stop playing. He rushed for 949 yards and nine touchdowns last season as a complement to Melvin Gordon. “You see Clement on the sideline, and that perks you up a little because of how good that player is,” Cubit said. Page 2 of 3 - Going to air Since seeing Gordon go to the NFL and Clement’s injury, the Badgers have emerged as a pass-heavy team led by senior quarterback Joel Stave, who halfway through the season leads the conference with 1,708 passing yards. “They’re throwing the ball a lot more than I can ever remember,” Cubit said. “Their offensive line, they’ve got some young guys up front; they’ve got three redshirt freshmen that are starting and they’re big kids — they’re typical Wisconsin guys.” Defensively, both teams rank among the top-30 in the country, but Wisconsin holds the edge in most every category. The Badgers are allowing just 10.9 points per game, which ranks third nationally. “It won’t be the same Wisconsin it was a couple years back, but this is still Wisconsin, this is still the Big Ten West,” Illini offensive lineman Teddy Karras said. “Everyone is just about even. It’s about whoever shows up on Saturday.” — Jordan Wilson can be reached at wilsn07@yahoo.com.
