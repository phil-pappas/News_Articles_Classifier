(AP Photo/Joseph Nair) \nSINGAPORE — Maria Sharapova won her first match since the Wimbledon quarterfinal in a 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory against Agnieszka Radwanska at the WTA Finals on Sunday. \nSharapova was sidelined after the Wimbledon semifinals until the Wuhan tournament in China four weeks ago with a prolonged foot injury. \nShe retired in the third set of her first match at Wuhan with a left wrist injury. \nSharapova, looking rusty from the lack of match play, needed 2 hours, 47 minutes to finally nail down the win against Radwanska. \nShe served for the match at 5-2 and dropped her serve. At 5-4, she double-faulted on her first match point, but won the match two points later when Radwanska netted a forehand. \nThis marked Sharapova's 13th career win in 15 matches played against Radwanska. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:42:04.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
