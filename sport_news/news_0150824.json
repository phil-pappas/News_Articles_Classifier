Dropping his arm, he was struck in the jaw and again in the ribs.\nIn this rough neighborhood in northeast Detroit, a punch could lead to a shooting.\nInstead, after the three-minute pummeling, the two men slapped hands in a sign of respect.\nThat’s exactly why three groups – Detroit Police, Osborn Neighborhood Alliance and Matrix Human Services Center – have joined together to begin a boxing school.\nThey hope local kids find camaraderie, even family, in the middle of a boxing ring.\n“It’s a chance to do something positive,” said a volunteer trainer, Herb Robinson.\nIt’s about more than teaching kids how to bob and weave, stick and move, he said.\nThe Matrix School of Boxing, which opened last week, will help keep the youths out of trouble by giving them something to do after school three times a week, he said.\nThe school will promote literacy and social skills by encouraging the youths to read books about boxing and listen to lectures from speakers from all walks of life.\n“They can taste it all, do anything,” said Ken Brown, the center’s director. “They can see life outside Eight Mile Road.”\nThe school grew from a popular midnight basketball and boxing program that began last year at the Matrix community center.\nWith basketball the biggest draw, the midnight program began with 15 youths and now draws 45, said Brown.\nThe boxers shared the center’s gym with the basketball players but now have their own space.\nThe center knocked down a wall in its basement and turned a former storage room into a boxing gym.\nWith a $5,000 donation from Quicken Loans, it set up a boxing ring, body bag and two speed bags.\nThe wall has a drawing of a bumble bee with boxing gloves, in honor of Muhammad Ali’s maxim of floating like a butterfly and stinging like a bee.\nBut the gym is a work in progress.\nIt still needs a wall mirror and the fledgling fighters need more headgear and other equipment.\n“They can fight here instead of in the street,” said Carlos Chambers, a volunteer trainer. “There’s no reward for fighting in the street.”\nBuy Photo From left Thomas “The Hitman” Hearns, eight time world title winner, talks with coach Carlos Chambers and Tyrone “Poison Ivory” Ivory, after a boxing demonstration at the Matrix Center in Detroit on Oct. 13.   (Photo: Robin Buckson / The Detroit News) \nDuring the grand opening of the boxing gym last week, Brown asked the young boxers what they liked best about the midnight boxing program.\nSeveral gave the same answer: They love to fight.\nThe school will help them channel their aggression in positive ways, said police Officer Jay Dantzler.\nAs they learn to box, they’ll also obtain discipline and confidence, he said.\n“They look to you for leadership,” he said. “They come to you when they have any other kind of problems.”\nBoxing will allow the youths to spread their wings in other ways too, said other volunteers.\nAs they become good enough to compete in Golden Gloves, they’ll get a chance to travel around the state and country, said organizers.\nSome of the kids will be staying at a hotel for the first time in their lives.\nVolunteer coaches said they get something out of the experience as well.\nChambers, who fought on the amateur level, said his dreams of turning pro were never fulfilled but he can help others.\n“I still can do good things for the kids,” he said.\nDom McCrary, who has been fighting in the midnight program, gives Chambers a lot of credit.\nMcCrary, 21, said he began fighting with nothing.\nChambers got him boxing gloves, headgear, shoes and hand gear that McCrary was eventually able to pay for.\n“Coach Carlos was always by my side,” said McCrary. “It’s a blessing to have someone like that in your life.”\nMcCrary said he has come to see his coach as family.\nAnd, despite trading blows with other youths for a year, he feels the same way about them.\nFDonnelly@detroitnews.com\n(313) 223-4186\nTwitter: @francisXdonnell", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:31:02.854+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
