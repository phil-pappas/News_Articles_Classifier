For the second consecutive game week, a starting safety has been added to the injury report in the lead up to kickoff.\nStarting free safety Anthony Cioffi is listed as questionable with an upper body injury for Saturday's game against Michigan State (8 p.m., BTN). Cioffi has been Rutgers' best defensive player this season, leading the team with two interceptions and ranking fourth with 18 tackles.\nBefore Rutgers played Kansas on Sept. 26, starting strong safety Davon Jacobs was added to the injury report with an upper body injury. Jacobs missed that game and he is listed as questionable against Michigan State.\nRedshirt freshman Kiy Hester took Jacobs' spot in the starting lineup against Kansas. Hester, who had nine tackles and two pass break-ups in a 27-14 win over Kansas , is in line to start again.\nIf Cioffi is sidelined, redshirt freshman Saquan Hampton would likely move into the starting free safety spot. Versatile backup Andre Hunt would also be in line for an expanded role at both safety spots and in sub packages.\nRELATED: Wide receiver John Tsimis ruled out for Michigan State game\nNo. 3 cornerback Jarius Adams is also questionable with an upper body injury. Rutgers currently has six scholarship defensive backs not on the injury report. The secondary depth already had been stretched thin after four experienced defensive backs were kicked off the team before the season opener .\nOn the positive side, right guard Chris Muller and defensive ends Djwany Mera and Kemoko Turay have been removed from the injury report. Those players had been listed as probable on Monday's injury report .\nHere is the full injury report:\nOL Zack Heeman (Lower body): Probable\nCB Ronnie James (Lower body): Probable\nCB Jarius Adams (Upper body): Questionable\nFS Anthony Cioffi (Upper body): Questionable\nSS Davon Jacobs (Upper body): Questionable\nTE George Behr (Lower body): Out\nWR Dontae Owens (Lower body): Out\nRB Desmon Peoples (Upper body): Out\nLB Nick Rafferty (Upper body): Out\nLB Austin Rosa (Lower body): Out\nDB Charles Snorweah (Upper body): Out\nWR John Tsimis (Lower body): Out\nDT Darius Hamilton (Lower body): Out for season\nLB T.J.
