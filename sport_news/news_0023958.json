Some of those people walked to a nearby liquor store where, according to Gilmore, they got into an altercation with others.\nSoon after the group returned to the home, about 7:30 p.m., a car drove by and shots were fired, Gilmore said. Three of the injured were in serious but stable condition, he said. One was being treated at Stroger Hospital in Chicago, another at Advocate Christ Medical Center in Oak Lawn and a third at Ingalls Memorial Hospital in Harvey.\nFranciscan St. Margaret Hospital in Hammond treated four people, but their conditions and status were unknown, Gilmore said.\nThe South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force is assisting with the investigation. No one was in custody. Gilmore did not have a description of the car and did not know how many people were in it.\nCheck back for more information.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Daily Southtown Shootings", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56266d5e/turbine/ct-cal-city-shooting-met-1021-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:54:42.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
