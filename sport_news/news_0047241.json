(Creative Commons Attribution 2.0 Generic License) \nIf you're an advertiser lamenting the plummeting value of website ads, MassChallenge finalist Ader has a pitch for you: consider joining the wonderful and weird world of video games. More specifically, the wonderful and weird world of watching other people play video games. \nWhy, you ask? Well, I hope you got the memo: there's this thing called video game streaming —where people log onto a website or app and watch others play games —and it's becoming a big deal. Just last year, Amazon bought game streaming site Twitch for nearly $1B, and it now brings in more than 100 million unique viewers every month, according to its website. This year, Google followed Amazon's lead with the launch of its own game streaming site through YouTube. \nSo here's where the advertisers come in: starting in November, Ader will launch the beta phase of its \"influencer marketplace for Twitch,\" with 300 Twitch streamers getting paid by brands to sponsor their products and services. What Ader does is play the role of a paid endorsement matchmaker, connecting brands with streamers that are interested in creating a new revenue stream for themselves, with Ader taking around a 20% cut for every contract signed. \nThe idea was conceived in the past few months by three college students: CEO Justin Warden, Chief Marketing Officer Aiyanna Green, who both go to Amherst College, and Chief Product Officer Sahil Chaturvedi, who goes to UMass Amherst. On Twitch, a higher engagement rate than other sites \nWarden told me this week that the big idea behind Ader is that brands can no longer rely on traditional Web advertising for strong engagement with prospective customers, especially with the recent scourge of adblockers that are now hitting iOS. \nAder actually started out as a startup trying to figure out how to make ads work in this new world of adblocking, but the team eventually pivoted when they realized they could combine the concept of influencer marketing with the growing popularity of Twitch and other game streaming sites, where user engagement seems to be disproportionately higher than other websites. Twitch, in particular, boasted an engagement level of 100 minutes last year , which makes it an engagement giant in comparison to YouTube's 227.82 seconds of engagement. \"We realized there’s a disconnect in the ad industry between how ads are perceived in the public and how ad industry thinks ads are being perceived.\" \n\"We realized there’s a disconnect in the ad industry between how ads are perceived in the public and how ad industry thinks ads are being perceived,\" Warden said, noting the popularity of adblock software, especially with younger people. \"If you’re in the adtech space and you’re my age, you’re going to be using adblock.\" \nBecause every Twitch broadcast includes a chat room for viewers, Warden said it can provide brands with an easy way to grok consumer sentiment. In the future, the startup plans to develop a platform that will hook into the chat room's API, letting it scan the feedback of users whenever a streamer is promoting a particular product or service. \"We have a really unique advantage,\" he said. \"Through Twitch, you can provide really live and intimate feedback as to how users view a particular sponsorship.\" Clients say they value smaller, more intimate audiences \nWarden acknowledged that Twitch has its own \"Influencer Program,\" but noted that it only works with a few of Twitch's top streamers, whereas Ader will work with streamers of all audience sizes. Out of the 300 streamers it will start working with next month, Warden said they average anywhere from 200 to 1,000 concurrent viewers. And in working with Ader's first three clients, he learned that they actually prefer to work with streamers who have smaller audiences because it increases the chances of one-on-one interactions. \"They want smaller streamers with a lower price point and a niche audience.\" \n\"It’s what our clients want,\" Warden said. \"They want smaller streamers with a lower price point and a niche audience.\" That way, he added, there's a strong bond of trust between the streamer and her audience. \nWhile there's one client he isn't allowed to disclose yet, one of the other clients is another young Boston startup: PracticeGigs, an online platform that connects amateur tennis players with more seasoned players. The sometimes messy world of transparency and disclosure \nTwitch is a place where streamers can gain massive audiences, not just because of their mad skillz but because of their personalities and the opinions they may have on any given game of subject. So if the idea of streamers accepting money to promote a product raises a red flag for you, there's a precedent for that concern. The issue of disclosure and transparency has been a major issue in gaming communities in the past few years. \"That trust is essential.\" \nLast month, for example, the Federal Trade Commission reached a settlement with Machinima , an online entertainment network that generates game content for Twitch and YouTube, for failing to adequately disclose that some of its videos that appeared to give objective opinions of Microsoft's Xbox One were actually paid endorsements. \nWarden said this is an issue that Ader has given a lot of consideration and not just for the purpose of following FTC guidelines. He said having streamers disclose paid endorsements is also important to build and maintain trust with their audiences. That's also why streamers will be able to give them own opinions of the products or services they're paid to promote, he said. \nBut to increase the chances of a higher value proposition for brands, Warden said Ader has a system that will match brands with streamers who are more inclined to like certain kinds of products or services, such as role-playing games, which tend to have devout fans. The system is currently human-powered, he added, but Ader plans to eventually build a technology platform that will automate those connections in a bidding process of sorts. \n\"That trust is essential,\" Warden said. \"It’s important to match a streamer that will like their product, but if they don’t like that product they should be able to say that to their audience. It’s really valuable to their audience.\" Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:54:09.860+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
