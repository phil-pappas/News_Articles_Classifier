Want hard-running? Nay’s your guy. Enjoy a ground assault that churns up the turf a yard (or 3) at time – dust or no dust? Croatan’s your team. The result: Nay, a 5-foot-10, 195-pound junior, is nearing the school record for rushing yards, and the Cougars (6-2, 1-1) are one win from setting a school record for victories heading into Friday night’s East Central 2-A Conference battle against Southwest (3-5, 0-2). The Cougars are 0-12 against the Stallions since Croatan opened in 1999. “I’m the old-fashioned hit-you-in-the-mouth running back,” Nay said. “I don’t mind trying to beat you to the edge. I don’t mind trying to juke you out, but if you’re in my way first 7 yards you better be prepared to hit me because if not, you’re going to be hurting tomorrow morning.” Which isn’t to say Nay would rather be a tank than a motorcycle. “I don’t intentionally look to hit anybody,” he said. “Usually, if I hit you, it’s because I don’t have anywhere else to go except through you. But if there is a hole, I’m going to try to hit that hole. But where there’s a hole, there’s always a person. So there’s not too many open holes with a straight lane to a touchdown.” Behind a veteran offensive line of large proportions and an offense that leans toward a power-I with occasional forays to an I-formation or double-wing scheme and motion, Nay has rushed for 1,150 yards and could break the school record for rushing against the Stallions. Garrett Bridges owns the record of 1,239 yards. “I had my goals set out, like being the best rusher around, beating the school record on touchdowns, rushing yards,” Nay said. “That’s all there and it’s pretty attainable it seems like right now. But I couldn’t personally have the success I am this year without the line and all them blockers.” Nay, who surpassed 1,000 yards in just seven games, hopes to at least hit 1,500 yards, which with three regular-season games left along with at least one playoff game seems doable. “I felt 1,500 was something that not many people after me are going to be able to get,” he said after a recent practice. “And if they do get it, it’s well-deserved. I don’t have much of an excuse not to get at least that with the guys in front of me.” Page 2 of 3 - Nay gave a glimpse of what he was capable of last year when he rushed for 200 yards against East Carteret, although he got banged up after that and Croatan had two other go-to backs (Warren Fields, 1,023 yards, and Zach Tracy 741 yards). But coach David Perry knew that with Nay and Ethan Bridges, who had 594 yards a year ago and 705 yards this season, he’d have another formidable one-two punch on the ground. To further that, Perry eased the burden on Nay, who has played linebacker as well as running back. But Croatan changed from a 3-5-3 scheme earlier this year to more of a four-linebacker setup, allowing Perry to drastically limit Nay’s time on offense and keep him fresher to run the ball. “We couldn’t have asked for much more than (what he’s given),” Perry said. “He gets extra yardage after he gets hit. A lot of times the stuff we’re running is inside stuff, so the yardage is the extra churning of your feet and leaning hard and getting 2 or 3 extra yards. It doesn’t look spectacular, but in the heat of the game those are huge.” And while he’s not extraordinarily fast – Perry estimated Nay runs the 40 in the range of 4.7 seconds – he’s no slowpoke, either. Against North Brunswick, he returned the opening kickoff 75 yards in a 14-7 victory. “He’s got enough speed that if he breaks it, he’s broke it,” Perry said. “North Brunswick has been conference champions in all the sprints the last few years and he broke through and was gone. The kids didn’t run him down.” While he’s not playing much linebacker these days, Nay is still doing double duty of a sort. He is also the team’s deep snapper. Nay didn’t mention he snapped the ball during an interview and shrugged at being possibly the only running back around who does before last week’s Northside game. Perry said he couldn’t recall having a running back snap for him, but there is a reason for his position decision. “Those are the only guys guaranteed to be untouched,” Perry said, referring to the rules that keep defenses from hitting the snapper until after the fact. “You can’t hit them until they get down the field. You get a couple yards, a little juke and you’re untouched down the field.” And often headed for a tackle, which is what Nay seeks to avoid – or run through – out of the backfield. Not that he started out as a running back. As a youngster, the 16-year-old Nay played quarterback, and, by his accounts, not very well. Page 3 of 3 - “Those were dark days,” he said. “I went out to a tryout. I guess I was the only one on the team that could throw well. So I was instantly a quarterback. Then I didn’t know any other position at the age of 7. So I stuck with what was comfortable.” But he eventually moved to running back and never looked back. Still, as he looks back on the season to date, he said he was a bit surprised at how quickly he hit 1,000 yards. “But,” he added, “it’s certainly nice.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:18:15.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
