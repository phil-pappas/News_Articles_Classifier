He sealed his spot in the third round with a stunningly easy victory Sunday at Charlotte, leading 227 of 334 laps and burnishing his status as a championship favorite. \nKevin Harvick: Harvick wasn’t Mr. Untouchable on Sunday. After a virtually perfect performance two weeks ago at Dover, where he led 355 of 400 laps in a must-win scenario, Harvick was mostly quiet at Charlotte. He finished second, but he failed to lead a lap, leaving Logano to enjoy top-dog posture. Still, Harvick is in great shape to advance to the third round. He has wins at both Kansas and Talladega. \"We’re just going to go to Kansas and keep our head down and grind away,\" Harvick said. Gluck: Costly mistakes can be killer in second round of NASCAR's Chase \nMartin Truex Jr.: Truex lit a new fire under his championship hopes Sunday with a solid third-place finish, easily his best of the Chase. He hasn’t won at Kansas or Talladega, but strong finishes at those tracks will push him into the third round. \"Talladega still looms. It still makes us nervous,\" Truex said. \nTHREE DOWN \nKyle Busch: Busch had a sour Sunday at Charlotte, his day highlighted by a wacky pit-road collision with Kyle Larson. He’s 10th in Chase points and will need excellent runs at Kansas and Talladega or a win at either to advance. He is winless at Kansas and has only one victory at Talladega. Dale Earnhardt Jr.: 'We hit fluid and flew into the freaking wall' \nDale Earnhardt Jr.: Earnhardt now is on the ropes in his search for his first championship. He had repeated encounters with the outside wall Sunday at Charlotte, finishing 28th at a track where he remains winless in points races. Junior is carrying an ace in his firesuit pocket, however, and that’s his excellent history at Talladega, where a win would launch him into the third round. \nMatt Kenseth: Considered among the top three title favorites by many, Kenseth dropped into a hole Sunday after a series of problems left him with a 42nd-place finish. He’s last among Chase drivers, 45 points behind leader Joey Logano. A win can obviously fix that problem, and Kenseth has victories at Kansas and Talladega. \nGALLERY: CHASE FOR THE SPRINT CUP STANDINGS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:36:29.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
