He also caught a 57-yard touchdown on a screen play that helped give the Indians the lead for good, 15-14, early in the second quarter. \nGroton (4-2 overall) completed the Division VIII portion of its schedule at 3-1. Notre Dame (4-2) dropped to 2-1 in the division, with a game remaining next Saturday at Newfield. Moravia is also 2-1 with a division game left against Spencer-Van Etten. \nThe division champion would be decided on a tiebreaker if all three teams finish at 3-1. Groton’s only division loss came to Moravia, which lost to Notre Dame. The top two teams in each of the Class D divisions in Section 4 qualify for the quarterfinals, with two others advancing as wild cards. \nDerrick Stark scored both Crusaders touchdowns, the first on a 2-yard run that gave them an 8-7 lead in the first quarter, with Iman McKay adding a two-point run. Stark’s 5-yard scoring run put Notre Dame up 14-7 less than a minute into the second quarter. Buy Photo The Notre Dame Crusaders took on the Groton Indians Friday night on the Crusader's field.
