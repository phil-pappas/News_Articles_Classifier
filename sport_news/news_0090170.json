Vestal, ranked 21st in Class A by the New York State Sportswriters Association, dropped to 3-2. \nVestal senior quarterback TJ Wegmann accounted for all four of his team’s touchdowns. He scored on runs of 42, 1 and 3 yards, and also connected with Rusty Virkler for a 32-yard touchdown on fourth-and-9 to give the Bears a 14-0 lead midway through the second quarter. \nWegmann completed 10 of 17 passes for 153 yards and ran 19 times for 117 yards. Logan Wiland added 101 yards on 23 rushes and Virkler caught eight passes for 124 yards. The Golden Bears had a 388-260 edge in total offense, with all of Corning’s yardage coming on the ground. \nWegmann scrambled for a 3-yard touchdown run on fourth down to bring Vestal within 28-26 with nine seconds remaining. After a pass interference call against Corning on the first two-point try, Wegmann was pressured as he rolled to his left and his potential tying pass zipped behind Evan Flynn and through the back of the end zone. \nJust over two minutes earlier, Vestal tried to take the lead after Wegmann scored on a 1-yard run to bring the Bears within 21-20. Corning stopped a pass on the first two-point bid, but Vestal gained another try because of a penalty. Wegmann scampered to his left and came up just short of the goal line on the second attempt. \nSullivan followed with his 47-yard touchdown after Zach Turner recovered an onside kick. Vestal took over at its own 28 and Wegmann directed the Bears down the field, with the big play a 39-yard strike to Virkler that moved the ball to the 16-yard line.
