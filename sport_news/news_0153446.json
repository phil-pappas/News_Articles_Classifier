After that finish, it dropped to 19th.\nEven though it had a rough outing, Helmer said he still believes in the team.\n“They are continuing to grow with a sense of urgency,” Helmer said. “They aren’t just going to quit and they are continuing to develop into the team they want to be.”\nHelmer said the team’s struggle might be because it hasn’t been training extremely hard and putting in tiring work preparing for the track season. That said, he said he believes that in the next few weeks the team will get its legs back and sharpen up its performance.\nRedshirt senior Rorey Hunter had been under the weather, but now is feeling better and ready to run well, Helmer said. He said he has seen strong performances in practice from both redshirt junior Jason Crist and redshirt sophomore Kyle Duvall.\n“We can feel it coming,” Helmer said. “We are ready for a good meet.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:29:37.883+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
