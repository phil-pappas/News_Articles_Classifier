Diaz's firing comes almost a year after she was placed on leave following allegations of domestic violence stemming from a camping trip.\nThe board approved the dismissal with a vote of 7-0 and did not discuss it at the meeting.\nMarti Diaz (Courtesy Marti Diaz)\n Crispin said the district has targeted his client and that her firing is an act of retaliation . He said plans to file against the district in federal court.\n\"We believe that this has been a foregone conclusion for a long time,\" Crispin said. \"The board's action is just to perform a rubber stamp of what the district administration really wants to accomplish.\"\nDistrict spokeswoman Christine Miles declined to comment on Diaz's employment. The Oregonian/OregonLive has requested documents relating to Diaz's employment, though Miles said the district is still reviewing the details of the request and does not typically release personnel records.\nDiaz deferred comment to Crispin, who provided the district's notice of intent to terminate Diaz, her response to that recommendation and a tort claim notice sent to the district this summer.\nThe district spelled out the grounds for Diaz's firing in a July letter from Human Resources chief Sean Murray, citing state laws allowing the firing of an educator for inefficiency, immorality, insubordination and inadequate performance.\nConcerns with Diaz's behavior came to light after other Portland Public Schools principals say Diaz and her partner got into a physical altercation during a camping trip last fall. Witnesses reported that Diaz and her partner got into a fight inside their recreational vehicle and upon exiting Diaz's partner said she had hit her, according to to the district's letter. Witnesses also reported that Diaz's partner's face was red and swollen.\nDiaz was arrested and placed on leave last October but the Clackamas County District Attorney declined to prosecute her because no one saw her hit her partner, there was no sign of serious injury, her partner did not want Diaz charged and the principals waited 11 days before reporting the incident to police.\nRegardless, the district states the situation warrants Diaz's firing, according to documents.\n\"In short, you engaged in actions that constitute criminal conduct, even though that conduct was not charged, and you are no longer fit to perform your responsibilities at PPS,\" the district's letter reads. \"Although this proposed recommendation to end your employment with PPS takes the circumstances in their totality into account, the District would be making this recommendation based on your conduct on the camping trip if that is all that had occurred.\"\nCrispin submitted a written response to the district's proposal to terminate Diaz. He said the district has added other accusations in order to justify firing her.\nIn the letter Crispin argues that the district relies on false accusations made by Diaz's white colleagues, who were allegedly severely intoxicated at the time, showing bias against Diaz, who is Latina. Diaz left the group once students arrived at the campsite and returned to her recreational vehicle. Diaz and her partner argued and pushed each other, but claims about Diaz's partner's face swelling are inaccurate, Crispin wrote in the letter. Diaz's partner also denies saying that Diaz hit her.\nDiaz believes the district has retaliated against her for reporting that her colleagues were intoxicated in front of students, according to a complaint filed with the Bureau of Labor and Industries in July. Diaz said she felt her colleagues violated district policies and rules by continuing to drink once children appeared at the camp.\nThe district also lodges several other complaints about Diaz's role as an administrator, according to documents. The district claims Diaz bullied another staff member and created a hostile work environment.\nDiaz had served as an assistant principal and principal at Kelly since 2010. She said in her state complaint that the district gave her additional responsibilities, including sending her to conferences to recruit diverse employees. The school's test scores improve d under Diaz's lead.\nCrispin claims in his letter that teachers may have criticized Diaz's leadership because they were pushed to advance the struggling school and asked to change techniques. He said in an interview that Diaz was committed to better serving the Hispanic community.\n\"That upsets the apple cart,\" Crispin said in an interview. \"She was a darling of the district as long as she stayed in her place.\"\nOther concerns center around a report of alleged inappropriate conduct between a male counselor and female student at Kelly Elementary. Staff found a letter in Diaz's office from the student's parents stating that the counselor rubbed the student's bare thigh and made inappropriate comments. Diaz is accused of failing to report the allegations, according to the district's termination letter.\nCrispin states in his response to the district that Diaz \"had little recollection\" of the incident and would need to review her notes, which the district had denied her access to. Diaz was also out of the office frequently for meetings and said another administrator, who claims to not have been involved, was in charge at the time. He wrote that the district has unlawfully denied Diaz access to documents needed to defend herself against the district's allegations.\n\"(Diaz) was certain she would never have allowed a student to be in danger,\" Crispin's letter reads.\nThe Teachers License and Practices Commission confirmed that both Diaz and the counselor are currently being investigated.\nDiaz's goal is to continue in education, Crispin said. He said she hopes to keep encouraging disadvantaged youth and children of color to develop an appreciation for learning.\n\"Her ideal is to be in position where she can continue to do that,\" Crispin said. \"She loves what she was doing.\"\nKelly Elementary, which serves more than 600 students, was led by two different interim principals during the last seven months of last school year. Amy Whitney, who was assistant principal of Lane Middle School , has taken the helm.\n--Laura Frazier\nlfrazier@oregonian.com\n503-294-4035\n@frazier_laura", "external_links": ["http://www.pps.k12.or.us/files/about-us/Kelly_Amy-Whitney_v2.pdf", "https://twitter.com/frazier_laura", "http://www.pps.k12.or.us/files/board/10-20-15_Businesss_Agenda_REVISED.pdf"], "published": "2015-10-21T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:21:02.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
