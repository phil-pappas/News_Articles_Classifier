Dominos driver Ashley Williams, 23, was out on a delivery when she came across something odd.\nAs she was searching for the address, a man came running out of his home, clearly frantic. At first, Williams assumed the man was her customer. She slowed down and rolled down her window.\n\"He started saying call 911, and he's not breathing,\" said Williams.\nRealizing something was very wrong, Williams parked and dialed 911. At the request of the operator, she followed the man inside the home. She couldn’t believe what she found.\n\"I saw the guy on the ground. He was blue,\" said Williams. \"I thought he was dead.\"\nThe homeowner told Williams the man had overdosed. Luckily, she had taken a first aid class that included CPR training. Guided by the 911 operator, Williams started compressions.\n\"Whenever he would gasp for breath every once in a while, it would give me hope that he was going to be OK, but I was really worried that he wasn't going to make it,\" said Williams.\nFirst responders arrived within minutes.\nThey used Narcan, an emergency medication that stops an overdose, to revive the man. District Fire Chief Joe Koczrowski said in cases of overdose, first responders have a limited window of time to administer the drug. Koczrowski said Williams' efforts gave them that time.\n\"He would not have survived,\" said Koczrowski. \"If she wouldn’t have stopped, he would have passed away.\"\nKoczrowski said he considers Williams, who is also a mom and a college student, a hero. He added that the patient should recover from the episode.\nWhen the ordeal was done, as if saving a life wasn't enough, Williams still had to make her delivery. She said the customer was very understanding.\n\"He tipped me and everything,\" laughed Williams.\nCopyright 2015 WAFB .
