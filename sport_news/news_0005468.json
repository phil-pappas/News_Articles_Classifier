The Bengal captain said the entire video footage of the incident would go to the BCCI. He said he has also spoken with Ganguly on this matter. “Yesterday, I spoke to him (Ganguly) and told him about the whole incident. He was very upset because somewhere his name was also raised and that is why I was also very upset about it. I felt really bad,” Tiwary told mediapersons after the match.
