Arwind Santos converted the foul shot, 85-74.\nFajardo then buried a fade away jump shot to put the Beermen ahead, 87-74. Globalport’s Stanley Pringle and Doug Kramer each scored a basket to make it a nine-point game, 78-87, 3:52 to play.\nFajardo again came through for San Miguel with another big jumper from the low post for a 90-78 lead, 3:32 left.\nAlex Cabagnot also delivered a big game for SMB as he collected19 points and eight assists, while Santos added 11 points. Lassiter came off the bench with 10 points, so was Gabby Espinas as he had all 10 markers in the second period.\nPringle, the Rookie of the Year last season, finished with 20 points, while Jensen added 16 points, and Joseph Yeo and Kramer had 13 and 10 points respectively for Globalport.\nTerrence Romeo, the third year guard of Batang Pier who had an impressive stint with Gilas Pilipinas, struggled with five points on 2-of-8 shooting from the field as he played under the weather.\nNearly three months after he was appointed coach of the league’s most popular squad, veteran mentor Tim Cone makes his debut with Barangay Ginebra San Miguel as they face their former team Star Hotshots today.\nCone coached the Star franchise for four seasons where he bagged five championships, giving him a record 21 league titles and a second coaching career Grand Slam in 2014.\nThe management of San Miguel Corp. (SMC), which under its umbrella owns Ginebra, Star and San Miguel Beer, decided to move Cone to the Kings in the hopes of ending the popular team’s title drought.\nThe game between Ginebra and Star is set at 5:15 p.m., right after the 3 p.m. encounter of Rain or Shine and Mahindra, where playing coach Manny Pacquiao is expected to join the Enforcers (formerly Kia).\nThe Elasto Painters – minus injured ace point guard Paul Lee – are aiming for their second straight victory after hammering a come-from-behind 96-87 decision to the Hotshots last Wednesday.\nCone took over a Ginebra team that has the “twin towers” of 7-foot center Greg Slaughter and 6-10 forward Japeth Aguilar, which makes the 57-year-old mentor excited to implement his ‘triangle offense’ system.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:31:07.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
