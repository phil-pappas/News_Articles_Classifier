The Terrapins lost All-Big Ten guard Laurin Mincy (13.5 points) while No. 2 scorer Lexie Brown (13.3) transferred to Duke. \nOhio State is expected to contend with Big Ten Preseason Player of the Year Kelsey Mitchell, who became the first freshman to lead the nation in scoring last season. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
