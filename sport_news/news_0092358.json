(Photo by Brent Kennedy) Brent Kennedy Contact Reporter Oakland Mills boys soccer scores three in first half to beat Wilde Lake, win fifth straight county game \nAn Oakland Mills team with a penchant for late-game adversity, made things a little easier on itself Wednesday against Wilde Lake. \nThe Scorpions scored three times in the first half — on goals by three different players — and cruised the rest of the way to a 3-1 victory over the Wildecats on the road. \n“We did make a point after yesterday where we did not play well in the first half on (Hammond’s) senior day, of making sure we were more prepared and ready tonight,” Oakland Mills coach Don Shea said. “Today, was definitely different, where we got our three (goals) quickly and then were able to hold that the rest of the way. We got to play a lot of guys and a lot of different formations.” \nThe win was the fifth straight county victory for Oakland Mills (8-2, 8-5), which still has an outside shot at earning a share of this year’s county title. The Scorpions would need to beat Glenelg on Friday in its regular season finale and then have Mt. Hebron lose to Long Reach in their meeting on Thursday. \nRegardless of the outcome, though, Oakland Mills is headed toward the postseason with some momentum thanks to its recent string of strong play. \n“Playoffs is everything for us and Shea really makes sure we are ready for that,” said Jefferson Fuentes, who anchors the middle of the field for the Scorpions. “We are understanding each other really well right now, our chemistry is getting higher and we are just playing better overall.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T05:41:56.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
