Here are some of the highlights:\nQuestion: Didn't see much of the Texas-Cal game? I know Jerrod Heard is a great athlete; is he a good passer?\nSherrington: Here's what I like about Heard as a passer: He's pretty careful about his targets. He's not trying to fit balls in any tight windows. He's often finding guys who are wide open, and if he sometimes underthrows them, meaning they have to come back to the ball or wait on it, that's OK. I'd rather see a QB do that than try to get too perfect and overthrow a wide-open receiver. But he's also made some nice downfield throws as well. The interception by Cal was a very nice play by a LB that Heard didn't see. What Heard has given Texas is exactly what it needed with an OL that's so young: He's athletic and can run from trouble, and he can throw deep. Bubble screens aren't helping Texas. They need to go vertical.\nQuestion: Totally impressed with UT's QB Heard. Looks like a Vince Young starter kit. Just wish he had Vince's size. But you can't have everything.\nSherrington: Watching him the other day, here's who I thought of: Johnny Manziel. That TD run down by the goal line, where he ran parallel to the goal line for about 20 yards, was vintage Johnny Football. I don't think he's as quick as Johnny, but he probably has more straight-line speed. The crazy thing is, Texas didn't see this coming. I realize some guys just play better when the lights are on. But all you heard last year and even early this year was that Heard just wasn't ready. Yeah, right.\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW"], "published": "2015-09-25T01:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:41:37.224+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
