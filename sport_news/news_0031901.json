The visiting Black Raiders downed the Mariners 68-0. \nRockland â€” After starting the campaign 0-2, the Oceanside football team bounced back with two impressive wins to even its record at 2-2. \nThus, there was a buzz in the air on Friday night, Oct. 2 as the Mariners hosted the always-tough, top-ranked, championship-driven Winslow at Wasgatt Field. \nWhen the night ended, the only buzz that remained was the sound of a spinning buzzsaw in the ears of the Mariners, who were left wondered what just cut through them. \nIt was the Black Raiders, who dominated the game from start to finish en route to an impressive 68-0 win. \nThe Black Raiders have been an equal-opportunity pillager this fall, beating Belfast 43-0, John Bapst of Bangor 63-0, Mount Desert Island 35-20, Madison/Carrabec 57-7 and now Oceanside 68-0. \nThus, Winslow has outscored opponents 266-27 in five games. \nIn Friday's game, the Mariners had 35 rushing yards on 30 carries and Brandon DeBrosky was 2-of-7 passing for 15 yards. Nate Raye had four kickoff returns for 85 yards for the hosts. \nIt had been about 20 years since the Black Raiders played a game in Rockland. Winslow scored three touchdowns over a span of 70 seconds to close out the first quarter en route to the lopsided win. \nSenior quarterback Jacob Trask got the Black Raiders on the board with 1:10 to go in the first quarter after scampering 21 yards to pay dirt. Backup quarterback Ryan Gagnon tacked on the first of his six extra points after the play. Following a Mariner fumble on the ensuing kickoff, it took two plays for the Black Raiders to go 39 yards, capped by a 14-yard run by Nate St. Amand. \nAfter a quick three and out by Oceanside, Trask hooked up with Nate Gagnon on a 61-yard touchdown pass for a 21-0 Black Raider lead as time expired in the quarter. Fullback Kenny Rickard added two scores for the Raiders and Trenton Bouchard added a 65-yard punt return in the first half. Dylan Hutchinson had a 74-yard reception for a TD from Trask to close out the first half. \nTrask was 3-of-8 for 148 yards and two TDs, while Gagnon completed both of his passes for 35 yards and a TD. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Crabtree Point Standings for Class C North, Oceanside (2-3, 93.8462 points) is sixth, while Winslow (5-0, 136.8421 points) is first in the 10-team region.
