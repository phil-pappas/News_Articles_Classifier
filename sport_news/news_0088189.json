He played on the JV basketball team when he was at Veritas Christian Academy two years ago. Now in his second year with the Blues, he also is a starting offensive tackle. \nQuiet and polite, he thanks his family and God for giving him the courage to do the things many kids do. \n“Honestly, my family and God is what’s got me through it,” said Rhoton. \n“Just trusting in him and trusting that he has a better plan for my life. When it gets hard, I’m doing the Lord’s will. That’s all I want to do with my life, that’s my motivation.” \nRhoton has been playing football since he joined the Roberson youth program as a youngster. It was there that Asheville School coach Gus Schill first saw him play as a teammate to Schill’s son David, now the Blues' starting quarterback. Rhoton played running back and receiver in youth ball, but his size is one of the reasons he’s playing on the line in high school. \n“It’s easy to mistake this as a weakness but it’s not,” Gus Schill said of Rhoton only having one full arm. \n“It’s a strength. He accomplishes more than most people even think about. He’s a man, a real man and I’m proud to coach him and our school is blessed to have him here.” \nPlaying on defense can be a little tricky for Rhoton. Schill says he uses his athleticism and intuitiveness to make plays. \n“He has to do some things that are a little unorthodox to get to the play,” Schill said. \n“Instead of shedding a block the standard way he may have to spin or he may have to out-hustle the blocker to get to the ball. Sometimes it does put him at a disadvantage and a blocker will get into him, push him around a little bit. But Eric will never quit fighting and he’s like that every game. \n“He fights to the very end. There will be a play or two where somebody will get to him but it won’t last. He’ll find a way to figure it out. He’s all heart.” \nWhen asked how often he has to use a spin move in order to get to the ball carrier, Rhoton smiled. \n“A lot,” he said. \n“My body is kind of off balance. I have to play off balance the entire game. So I try to play with my strong side. That’s pretty much what I have to do.” \nWith the exception of his first two years in high school, David Schill has been Rhoton’s teammate since they were playing youth football. \n“He’s the most selfless kid here,” Schill said. “He will lay down himself for anyone else on this team. I’ve never met anyone I’ve trusted more or is as good as person as he is. I've have known him a really long time. I know what he is all about and I really just like him.” \nRhoton is the youngest of four children to Dr. Eric Rhoton, a neurosurgeon, and his wife, Diane. Those who know the family have heard the story about how Rhoton's parents bought him a prosthesis, which was expensive and not covered by insurance. \n“We got it and thought it would be a great thing for him,” Dr. Rhoton said. “Within a day or two he threw it off the deck and our dogs ate it. He didn’t want anything to do with it since.” \nThat may say more about Eric Rhoton’s desire to use the body he was born with rather than with anything artificial. \nPeople sometimes stare but there are those times when it's out of admiration for how Rhoton plays the game. \n“A couple games ago, we played against the Carolina Gladiators (one of their players) came up to me and said I was an inspiration to him,” Rhoton said. \n“That meant a lot to me that I meant a lot to him and that I’m making a difference.” 18 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1S1Eip1 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:43:30.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
