Brandon Belt faces four weeks of rehab and figures to be fine for spring training.\nDr. Ken Akizuki performed the surgery on Belt’s right knee.\n“At times, it was bothering him,” manager Bruce Bochy said. “He was playing through it. He had his days when it bothered him a little bit more, which is normal with a torn meniscus because it moves around a little bit.”\nBelt had been shelved with another concussion and wasn’t going to play the rest of the season anyway. His season ends with a .280 batting average, 18 home runs and 68 RBIs in 137 games.\n“We expect he’s going to be fine and OK once he gets some time off,” said Bochy, referencing Belt’s concussion issues. “That’s how you have to feel. Certainly for his sake, I don’t want this to stay with him or be one of those cases where it could come up again at some point.”\nThe Giants started Kevin Frandsen at first base Tuesday. Wednesday, it’s Nick Noonan .\nDon’t expect Marlon Byrd to reach enough plate appearances to have his $8 million option for 2016 vested. He needs 15 plate appearances in five games and isn’t in Wednesday’s lineup, and the Giants plan to give Jarrett Parker and Mac Williamson steady outfield work the rest of the way.\n“I’d like to play them as much as I can,” Bochy said. “For us to get a better look at them and for them to get some more playing time up here, it’s going to be valuable for both of us, the players and us.”\nGeneral manager Bobby Evans spoke with Byrd before the game and said the team still could be interested in the outfielder if he falls shy of the 550 plate appearances that would kick in the option.\n“It’s no reflection on him,” Evans said of the Giants’ decision to play younger outfielders now that they’ve been eliminated from the race. “We were happy to bring him here, and we certainly benefited from his leadership on and off the field.”\nByrd is hitting .275 with three homers and 30 RBIs in 36 games since being acquired before the trade deadline from Cincinnati. He’s hitting .409 (18-for-44) with runners in scoring position. But he played Hunter Pence ’s position, right field, as Pence was shelved with an oblique strain.\nNext year, the Giants will have Pence, Angel Pagan and Gregor Blanco under contract, and Nori Aoki has a club option. Plus Jarrett Parker is playing for an Opening Day job.\n“You have to have these conversations, too,” Evans said of possible negotiations with Byrd. “What kind of role would he anticipate? When he came here, he was to fill in for Pence until he came back. At no point did we think Pence wouldn’t come back.\n“Now, as you look at next year, would he be comfortable with the role? He may benefit from being a free agent. He has to determine what’s the best option, the best playing time situation and whether ours is the best situation, and we have to determine what our biggest needs are.”", "external_links": ["http://launch.newsinc.com/js/embed.js"], "published": "2015-10-01T02:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:44:27.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
