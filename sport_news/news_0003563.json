The 32-year-old mother was shot dead while heading to Tahrir Square with two dozen other peaceful marchers.\nThe 17 defendants came forward to testify in investigations of El-Sabagh's killing, but were later charged by the general prosecution.\nFourteen of the defendants belong to the Socialist Popular Alliance Party, as di El-Sabagh, while three do not.\nThe prosecution previously said investigations revealed El-Sabagh died from wounds sustained from \"light birdshot\" that a Central Security Forces (CSF) officer fired at her and other protesters. The police officer was charged with “beating that led to death,” then found guilty in a court trial and sentenced to 15 years in prison. His sentence was appealed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:34:34.502+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
