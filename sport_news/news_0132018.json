He has become the focal point of opposing defenses and will be when Cathedral is host to No. 1-ranked Becker at 7 p.m. Friday at St. Cloud State’s Husky Stadium. It’s the Crusaders’ homecoming game. \n“It’s been a fun year playing receiver,” Buckentine said. “Our quarterbacks, Quinton Young and Zach Sufka, have been doing a really good job getting me the ball. \n“Our passing game is pretty solid.” \nEverything else has had its lapses for the Crusaders (0-6), who have struggled with consistency and a small line. \nOne thing that has been consistent has been the passing game. The Crusaders have had one of the top passing offenses in the state the past two seasons, led by all-staters Tommy Auger (2014) and Brady Yoerg (2013). \n“Those are some pretty big shoes to fill,” Buckentine said. \nBuckentine was moved to the No. 1 receiver position this year. That was the spot held by Auger last season. Auger moved from tight end to the No. 1 receiver spot when Yoerg graduated. Credit Buckentine for making the most of the opportunity.

The 33 receptions ties him for most in the area with St. Cloud Apollo’s Cole Johnson. \nWith those numbers, teams are trying to shut him down. \n“I hear (opposing) coaches against us yell: ‘Watch No. 3. Watch No. 3,’ ” Buckentine said. “The last game, I had a guy on me at the line and another guy back eight yards. \n“I think I would prefer to have only one guy on me. I like the challenge, though. It also shows that the work in the offseason has paid off.” \nHis best games came in Week 1 against Holy Family Catholic and Week 3 against Foley. Against Holy Family Catholic, he had eight catches for 110 yards and 1 touchdown. Against Foley, he had 10 catches for 92 yards and a touchdown. \nAt 5-foot-11-inches and 175 pounds, he’s certainly not big. He has made himself stronger. \n“You can really see the difference in him physically,” Auger said. “I’m happy for him. \n“He put in the work and it’s nice to see it pay off.” \nStory continues below.

(Photo: Kimm Anderson, kanderson@stcloudtimes.com) \nWhile his personal statistics are coming along nicely, the victories haven’t come on the field. Cathedral has been outscored 165-60. The Crusaders have been competitive in most of their games, including losses at Foley (27-19) and at Milaca (28-22 in overtime). \n“It’s definitely frustrating not winning yet,” Buckentine said. “But I think it’s still super fun overall. \n“I look forward to the games all week. We haven’t put together, I feel, a full game as a team yet. We’re still confident we can turn this round.” \nBecker (6-0) presents a formidable challenge. The Bulldogs are defending state Class 4A champions and ranked No. 1 in the state by The Associated Press. \n“They are obviously really good, defending state champs and a bigger school than us,” Buckentine said. “We definitely go in as the underdogs. \n“No one is really expecting much from us in that game. We don’t have much to lose. We hope that we can surprise some people, maybe.” \n“We knew this one was going to be a tough one on the schedule,” Auger said. “I know this sounds cliche, but all we’re trying to do is get better. \n“We’re trying to execute our plays and blocking the right guys and playing the right defensive gaps and doing what we’re supposed to be doing on every play. If we do everything we’re supposed to, that’ll be the most we can ask.” \nTough week \nEden Valley-Watkins head coach Jon Thielen said his squad was stopped four times in or near the red zone (inside the 20) in the Eagles’ 34-28 at Howard Lake-Waverly-Winsted. \nIt was especially upsetting to EV-W because and not only because it was the Eagles’ third straight loss after a 3-3 start. Plus it was the Lakers’ first win after five straight losses. \n“We’re struggling,” Thielen said. “We’re trying to get better.” \nThe Eagles are host to Melrose (4-2) at 7 p.m. Friday in Eden Valley in another game that promises to be a shootout. The Dutchmen are led by senior running back Zack Pierskalla, who is third in the area in rushing yardage. He has rushed for 872 yards and 12 touchdowns on 121 carries, a 7.2-yards-per-carry average. \n“He looks like it,” Thielen said of Pierskalla. “He’s real athletic and mobile and they’ve got nice size up front blocking for him.” \nEV-W has the most passing yards in the area. Quarterback Reese Jansen has completed 111 of 181 passes for 1,310 yards and 19 touchdowns with seven interceptions. The Eagles’ Deshaun James, Greg Lux, Travis Thielen and Jacob Streit are in the top 15 in the area in receptions. \nMelrose’s passing game, led by quarterback Tyler Braegelmann, has emerged as the season has progressed. Braegelmann passed for 266 yards and three touchdowns in a 30-26 Week 5 loss to Maple Lake. \nHonored \nSt. Cloud Apollo boys head golf coach John Lieser is receiving a prestigious award from the Minnesota Public Golf Association. \nIt’s presented to an individual for “a signficant contribution to the interest, growth and spirit of Minnesota Public Golf,” according to Ron Poferl, who is secretary of the Minnesota Public Golf Association. \nLieser, who writes a golf column for the Times, will be honored Friday at the Greenhaven Golf Course in Anoka. \nFollow Tom Elliott on Twitter @sctimestom or call 259-3661. 136 CONNECT 18 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.sctimes.com/story/sports/high-school/2015/09/29/area-notebook-senior-shines-crusaders/73050994/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T00:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T17:38:16.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
