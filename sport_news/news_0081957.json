The 14-time Grand Slam champion failed to win a major title for the first time in 10 years and did not reach beyond the quarterfinals at a Slam this year.\nBut the Spaniard and his camp have reason to believe next year will yield better results, despite the negativity surrounding his 2015 season.\n“It’s normal that when I was winning a lot, they’d put me to the moon and now they put me very low,” Nadal said in Beijing. “That’s part of the show, that’s part of the game. So I accept everything and know what I did in the world of tennis, know how difficult are all the things that I’ve done. I’m happy and proud about what I did to be where I am today, all the work that I had to do to become the player that I am. So I’m gonna keep working hard, keep waiting for chances for my future and I believe I’m gonna do it.”\nTennis Mailbag: Are Nadal's recent remarks, commercial decisions worrisome? by Jon Wertheim", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:54:26.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
