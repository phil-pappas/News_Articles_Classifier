But Oregon State Police Superintendent Richard Evans Jr. was able to give legislators last week some rudimentary dimensions on the challenge ahead for his agency in its pledge to work through a decades-long stockpile of untested sex-assault evidence kits.\nAmong the points he shared: There are 5,652 untested evidence kits in the possession of local law enforcement agencies throughout the state. The oldest kits date back more than three decades to 1983. At least 1,100 kits are more than 12 years old, according to a report by The Oregonian/OregonLive's Maxine Bernstein.\nThen there are the unquantifiable costs. Victims, many of whom saw their kits and cases fall into a black hole of inattention, have felt alone and forgotten, said Michele Roland-Schwartz, executive director of the Oregon Attorney General's Sexual Assault Task Force . The message stemming from law enforcement's years of neglect has been that offenders can get away with their crimes, she told The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board. Evans himself acknowledged to legislators that there's a perception out there that \"law enforcement wasn't doing its job for victims.\"\nCertainly, some offenders have gotten away with their crimes. Although an untested kit does not equate to an unsolved case, it does mean that no one ever looked at the DNA in these cases to compare it with DNA from other assaults. Already, cities that have started working through their inventory of untested kits are finding a single offender tied to multiple cases. Detroit, for example, has identified a suspected 549 serial offenders from its testing. That kind of information can provide support for victims' accounts and help take a serial offender off the streets. That is, if the kit is actually tested.\nCredit national attention as well as state legislators and law enforcement agencies , finally, for acknowledging that current protocol needs to change – and be written down. In Evans' testimony, he laid out a road map for how the state plans to improve, sharing some of the recommendations that a work group of law enforcement and sexual-assault advocates are developing for handling sex-assault kit testing in the future. Most significantly, Evans said that starting Jan. 1, local law enforcement agencies will be urged to submit kits within 14 days of receiving them, replacing the unwritten policies and unknown criteria that some agencies relied on previously.\nThe work group also plans to develop a form for agencies to fill out that will help the Oregon State Police lab \"triage\" which cases need immediate attention – for instance an unidentified attacker's assault on a juvenile – versus others that can wait. The work group is also recommending that kits from victims who are not ready to proceed with a police investigation be held for 12 years, matching the statute of limitations for rape. Those kits – like about 750 in the current inventory – won't be tested until the victim is ready to go forward, a key protection for those victims supported by advocates, including Roland-Schwartz, who is a member of the work group.\nOther issues remain, including how to provide notification and support for victims who may be retraumatized by having their assault investigation reopened, said Roland-Schwarz. And Evans said he does not know just what kind of strain the new 14-day policy will put on his agency, adding that he will report back to legislators.\nA commitment to report regularly to legislators is, in fact, not a bad idea. After all, the concept that all kits should be tested is not new – Portland Police acknowledged the need for widespread testing more than a decade ago after the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl by a man who was linked, belatedly, to at least two earlier assaults . But follow-through seems to be a perennial problem . An annual report on progress, problems and compliance by local law enforcement agencies may be the best way to show that, finally, this is a lesson learned.\n– The Oregonian/OregonLive editorial board", "external_links": ["http://www.freep.com/story/news/columnists/rochelle-riley/2015/10/06/women-step-up-to-help-solve-rapes/73477808/", "http://endthebacklog.org/", "http://oregonsatf.org/", "https://olis.leg.state.or.us/liz/2015I1/Downloads/CommitteeMeetingDocument/80492", "http://oregon.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?clip_id=10249"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:07:52.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
