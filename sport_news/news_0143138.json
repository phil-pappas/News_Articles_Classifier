Where: Memorial Stadium, Lincoln, Neb. TV: ABC. Radio: AM-920. \nTickets: Sold out. Line: Nebraska by 11/2. Series: UW leads, 5-4. \nCoaches: Wisconsin's Paul Chryst (22-21) vs. Nebraska's Mike Riley (95-83).

FOUR THINGS TO WATCH \nCAN UW RUN TO DAYLIGHT? Take away a 326-yard performance against Hawaii in Week 4 and the Badgers' ground game has been unimpressive. UW enters the game averaging 167.8 yards, ninth in the Big Ten. The Badgers have owned Nebraska in three of the four meetings since the Cornhuskers joined the Big Ten in 2011. In winning three times, UW has averaged 351.8 rushing yards and 5.8 rushing touchdowns. Nebraska is third in the Big Ten against the run (85.0) and last against the pass (353.8). Do UW's coaches put the game in the hands of quarterback Joel Stave or do they test Nebraska on the ground? \nCONTROLLING ARMSTRONG A CHALLENGE: UW's defense contained Nebraska quarterback Tommy Armstrong Jr. last season and limited him to 62 passing yards and 17 rushing yards. Armstrong leads the Big Ten in passing yards per game (274.2) and is second on the team in rushing (31.2 per game, 4.2 per carry). UW defensive coordinator Dave Aranda noted this week that Armstrong takes unusually deep drops and is adept at finding open space and making unscripted plays. \"A lot of people when they're rushing the passer don't set the edge on him like they should,\" Aranda said. \"And then he is just out there creating. ... You'd like to be able to keep him in the pocket. You'd like to be able to try to get pressure on him. But he sees pressure and he flushes out. ... That is a challenge.\" \nIS STAVE CONFIDENT? Stave, who has started 33 games, suffered four turnovers (two interceptions, two fumbles) in the 10-6 loss to Iowa last week. Not surprisingly, coach Paul Chryst was asked this week if he was concerned at all if Stave's confidence was wavering. His response: \"No. Not at all.\" Stave's performance Saturday will be telling. \nSTEVENSON TO MAKE DEBUT: Some UW fans were bitter when they learned in July that tailback Jordan Stevenson was not admitted to school after signing with the Badgers. Seeing Stevenson eventually sign with rival Nebraska left those fans seeing red. Stevenson, who totaled 4,991 yards and 53 touchdowns in high school, has not played in Nebraska's first five games. However, he is expected to make his debut against UW. He could handle kickoff returns, but it is unclear whether he will get any work at tailback. HISTORY LESSON \nNebraska fans were excited to see the Cornhuskers leave the Big 12 for the Big Ten in 2011. Those fans have come to dread seeing their proud team face UW on the football field. \nUW has won three of the teams' four Big Ten meetings and the Cornhuskers' defense was embarrassed in three of the games. \nUW welcomed the Cornhuskers to the Big Ten with a 48-17 victory in 2011. Nebraska gained a measure of revenge by rallying for a 30-27 victory in the 2012 league opener in Lincoln, but UW rolled to a 70-31 victory in the '12 league title game. Nebraska grabbed an early 14-point lead last season in Madison, but Melvin Gordon helped UW roar back for a 59-24 victory. \nUW has outscored Nebraska, 204-102, in the four games and the key has been the ability to run the ball. \nThe Badgers have rushed 194 times for 1,407 yards, 7.3 yards per carry and 351.8 yards per game with 23 touchdowns. The Cornhuskers have rushed 179 times for 818 yards, 4.6 yards per carry and 204.5 yards per game with nine touchdowns. DID YOU KNOW? \nFor just the fifth time in school history, UW has held four consecutive opponents to no more than 10 points. \nUW blanked Miami (Ohio), 58-0; defeated Troy, 28-3; shut out Hawaii, 28-0; and lost to Iowa, 10-6. \nThat ties the third-longest streak in program history. \nUW's \"Hard Rocks\" defense held seven consecutive foes to no more than 10 points in 1951. The 2004 team held five consecutive teams to that mark. PREDICTION \nBoth teams are coming off staggering losses. Nebraska blew a double-digit lead in the fourth quarter and fell at Illinois, 14-13. UW suffered a 10-6 loss to Iowa despite having the ball in Hawkeyes' territory on eight of 12 possessions. Expect an emotional effort from both teams, but UW will run the ball effectively enough, quarterback Joel Stave will rebound from a four-turnover performance and the Badgers' defense will continue to excel. \nWisconsin 24, Nebraska 14", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:40:48.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
