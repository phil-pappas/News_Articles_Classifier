In many ways, it would be a verdict on how the Browns felt about their head coach.\nEarlier in the week, Pettine told his team this could be their \"defining moment.\" Win here, where the Browns had lost the last seven years.\nAnd maybe, just maybe, he's right.\nStart with the final score: Browns 33, Baltimore 30. In overtime. The Browns won the kind of game that they have been losing week after week. Make it year after year. You could even say, decade after decade.\n\"We talk about mental toughness and character and those are great words,\" said Pettine. \"Easy to say, but tough to do.\"\nEspecially for the Browns, who came into this sunny Sunday at M&T Bank Stadium having lost 8-of-9 dating back to last season. Especially with Pettine having to apologize to the team for how he mishandled the Joe Haden injury situation early last week. Especially after the first quarter, when the Browns' defense was invisible and Baltimore had a 14-3 lead.\nEspecially in the third quarter, when the Browns were behind, 21-9. Or when Pettine wasted timeouts at the end of regulation.\nEspecially after last week's 30-27 loss to San Diego on the final play of the game.\n\"When you lose a game like we did in San Diego, it feels like you lost twice,\" said Joe Thomas.\nBut this time, the Browns' left tackle was smiling. He was like a big kid who was told there was no money left for Christmas presents, then found his favorite Xbox Game under the tree.\n\"Now this will give us a real boost,\" said Thomas. \"I know it's one game, but it still means a lot.\"\nFor eight years, Thomas has been on the field for every snap of the offense. He is the team's senior member, the only one left from the last team to win in Baltimore. That was in 2007, when the final score was 33-30 in overtime. The Browns finished 10-6 that season led by a hot quarterback having a career year by the name of Derek Anderson.\nONE WONDERFUL AFTERNOON\nRight now, the Browns are 2-3. Their defense remains a mess. But they have Josh McCown setting team records. He is the only Brown to throw for at least 300 yards in three consecutive games.\nEver.\nMcCown was 36-of-51 for a stunning 457 yards. He threw two touchdown passes. He ran for a touchdown. Thomas said Baltimore set its defense to take away the Browns' running game. Cleveland had nine yards rushing in its first eight attempts.\n\"After the first quarter, we said 'screw it,' we're going to play with three wide receivers ... and throw the ball downfield,\" said Thomas, who raved about McCown's leadership and how he \"gets us into the right things\" on offense.\nPettine said he realized in the middle of the week that they \"might have to throw it 50 times to win.\" Rookie Duke Johnson said he could feel the momentum on offense, \"especially in the second half.\"\nThe Browns thought they'd score whenever they got the ball.\n\"We could feel it on the sidelines,\" said receiver Taylor Gabriel. \"We were always one play away (in some losses). But we made big catches, big plays on offense and the defense stepped up. We all came together as brothers.\"\nWILL IT CARRY OVER?\n\"Sometimes you have wins that can define a season or be a turning point,\" said Pettine. \"We hope this is it for us. We did a lot of bad things, but found a way (to win) ... I don't know if it has sunk in yet ... this is a huge win for us.\"\nBaltimore quarterback Joe Flacco had a 13-1 record against the Browns. So many times, he made the big plays at the end of games to turn the orange helmets blue.\n\"To find a way to win a game like this with everything on the line, I can't tell you how satisfying that is,\" said Pettine, who knows his team rallied during the week to practice well, then refused to wilt under the pressure in Baltimore.\nGary Barnidge caught a touchdown pass with his feet. I can't explain it. He can't explain it. It just happened. Barnidge is the first Browns tight end to catch touchdown passes in three consecutive games since Ozzie Newsome in 1983!\nMcCown said he didn't see Barnidge's grab at the goal line. McCown lofted the ball up high, then was knocked flat on his back. As they ran off the field, Barnidge told McCown, \"I caught it. I didn't use my hands, but I caught it!\"\nIndeed he did. Just as the Browns seemed to catch something special on this day.\nPettine called it \"resolve.\" Some of the players mentioned \"confidence.\"\nThere was more than a little joy watching grown men dancing on a field as the Baltimore crowd turned silent, then trudged to the exits. This was a game that seemed to be won and lost several times by both teams.\nBut only the Browns were smiling at the end.\n\"There's a roller coaster ride of emotions in an NFL game,\" said Pettine. \"This one would be one helluva ride at Cedar Point.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:23:27.129+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
