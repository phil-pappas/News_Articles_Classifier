Please see www.mercurynews.com for complete coverage. \nMcCaffrey had three touchdowns and 335 all-purpose yards late in the third quarter, including a 96-yard kickoff return and a 70-yard touchdown run, as the Cardinal steamed toward its eighth consecutive victory over UCLA. \nThe game was full of highlights, none more stunning than Stanford receiver Francis Owusu's touchdown catch in the third quarter on a flea flicker pass. While falling to the ground, Owusu pinned the ball on the back of a UCLA defender -- his arms wrapped fully around -- and held on.

Meyer) \nThe Cardinal took advantage of several UCLA gaffes, including a poor pass by quarterback Josh Rosen that cornerback Alijah Holder turned into a Pick 6. \nStanford has scored more than 40 points in four consecutive game, its longest such streak since 2011. An entertaining first half began with a thud, at least for Stanford fans. Facing fourth-and-short from UCLA's 42 yardline, Cardinal coach David Shaw sent on the punt team. The decision wasn't well received by the homer crowd, but it proved fortuitous. \nOn UCLA's fourth play, quarterback Josh Rosen underthrew a pass on the left sideline. Cornerback Alijah Holder stepped in front of the receiver, grabbed the ball and then produced a nifty 31-yard interception return for a touchdown.

'14 Rose Bowl (Kevin Anderson) and only the fourth turnover the Cardinal has forced this season. \nThe Bruins zoomed down the field as tailback Paul Perkins unleashed a dazzling 43-yard run that took UCLA into the red zone. But two penalties killed the drive and the Bruins settled for a field goal. \nThe big plays continued -- immediately. McCaffrey returned the ensuing kickoff 96 yards to set up a short touchdown pass from Hogan to tight end Austin Hooper, giving the Cardinal a 14-3 lead.

(Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) ( Nhat V. Meyer ) \nThe Bruins wasted no time answering. On first down, Rosen and receiver Darren Andrews connected on 70-yard catch-and-run touchdown. \nFrom there, the pace of scoring slowed -- much to Stanford's liking. The Cardinal took 14 plays and more than seven minutes to push its advantage to 21-10 on Hogan's laser to Devon Cajuste. But the key plays took place well before the scoring strike, when Stanford converted third downs of 12 and 13 yards. Both times, Hogan hit Hooper, his favorite receiver. \nLess than one minute into the second quarter, the teams had combined for 31 points. There was more to come. McCaffrey charged nine yards for a touchdown midway through the quarter to cap a three-play drive, then scored on a 28-yard dash with 2:13 left before halftime. \nThe Bruins provided the final points before the break, on Perkins' short touchdown run with 11 seconds remaining. \nThe Cardinal took steps to prevent a major UCLA comeback, in the form of a flea flicker. McCaffrey took the snap from center in the Wildcat formation, pitched to Bryce Love, who then flipped to Hogan. Hogan gathered himself, then tossed a 41-yard pass to Owusu in the end zone. Owusu reached around the back of a UCLA defender, grabbed the ball and managed to hold on as they tumbled to the grass. \nThe amazing catch gave Stanford a 42-17 lead. \nFormer Stanford all-conference safety John Lynch was the honorary captain.
