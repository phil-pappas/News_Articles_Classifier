It has been a really good start to the season for me and I maybe did not expect it to go this well. \n“At the start of the season I set myself a target to try to become a regular in the Under-21s and try to get a few starts in the Premier League. \n“Obviously I have got a few starts already, which has been great and I cannot thank the players and staff enough for helping me settle in.” \nSwans slump \nLamela is also finding it hard to explain his sudden elevation. \n“I don’t know what has changed,” he said. \n“I don’t know if it is because I am more settled. I need to keep working, keep working hard every day. I am always wanting to help my team.” \nSwansea manager Garry Monk would appear to have more problems to contend with than Pochettino after a recent slump that has brought just one point from the last three league games. \nSwansea’s recent record against Spurs offers more cause for concern — the Welsh club have lost the last seven meetings between the two sides — but Monk is convinced that trend is about to change. \n“We’ve had some very good games against them since we’ve been in the Premier League. But at the same time we have only taken one point from those matches, even if we have deserved better in some games,” he said. \n“But it’s a record that we want to change, that’s our focus and we’ll be aiming to do that this weekend. \n“We were excellent against them at home last season and we know that they are a very good team with fantastic players and a forward-thinking manager.” \nSwansea’s recent problems appear to have been up front, with Monk’s side mustering just one goal in the last four games. \n“It’s important that we improve as a team. The two games we haven’t performed in — Watford and Southampton — have come in a short space of time and for me it is about us performing better and then we’ll be fine,” Monk added. \n“The chances we have created have fallen to different players, but I don’t mind who scores because it’s all about winning games. \n“It’s about that consistency level - to try and get back to where we were at the start of the season.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:17:59.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
