Photo: AP\nSeven days and counting.\nBack to the Future trilogy aficionados will know the date. For those fans, October 21, 2015 is the day when all your Christmases come at once. In the second instalment of the iconic series, Marty McFly and Dr. Emmett \"Doc\" Brown travelled 30 years into the future to that precise date.\nWhat does any of this have to do with sport? Well, strangely enough, there's an undeniable link.\nA prophetic moment? Will Back to the Future's joke about the Cubs actually come true?\nIn 1989, when the film was released, and in the years since, film buffs have pored over the choices the film's creators made in creating a vision – albeit with a comedic bent – of how that year in the distant future might look.\nAdvertisement Of course, the flying DeLorean time machine is central to the whole series, but director Robert Zemeckis and his team had fun with concepts such as automatic shoelaces, Jaws 19, holograms, thumbnail ID technology, flat panel TV sets, drones, internet video chat systems, flying cars and, most famously, hoverboards.\nBut for eagle-eyed sports fans and cinematic devotees, there's a memorable reference to the Chicago Cubs breaking through and winning baseball's World Series. More than 25 years ago the Cubs were the butt of many jokes as they possessed one of the more famous droughts in world sport: their last World Series win came in 1908. Remarkably, casting ahead to 2015, that drought is still alive.\nMichael J Fox in the second instalment.\nEarly in Back to the Future II , Marty McFly stands within sight of Hill Valley's famous clock tower surveying the damage after Griff (grandson of Biff, of course) and his gang crash into the courthouse after a hoverboard chase. Out of the blue there's a sports flash in the sky declaring that the Cubs have swept Miami to win the World Series. How unlikely! And against a team from Miami!\n\"Who would have thought – 100-1 shot,\" an old man utters to Marty McFly. \"I wish I could go back to the beginning of the season and put some money on the Cubs.\" Cue the cryptic music.\nIn a nod to the off-beat humour of the film's creators, Chicago won the World Series against a Miami-based team whose logo was depicted as an alligator. Back in the late 1980s no Major League Baseball team was located in the sunshine state even though Florida has since gained two franchises: the Florida Marlins (now the Miami Marlins) in 1993 and the Tampa Bay Rays in 1998.\nEven though such a World Series match-up was impossible given that the Marlins and Cubs are both members of the National League, did Zemeckis and screenwriting partner Bob Gale know something back then about Chicago's title hopes in 2015?\nThe Cubs are enjoying a successful season and are one of the leading chances to finally win the World Series and finally end their 107-year title drought. Knock me down with a bolt of lightning!\nOn Tuesday night in the US they advanced to the National League Championship Series for the first time in 12 years with a 6-4 victory over the top-seeded St. Louis Cardinals.\nThe Cubs thrilled an energised home crowd at Wrigley Field with their batters led the way as they clinched the best-of-five division series 3-1.\nChicago will next face either the New York Mets or the Los Angeles Dodgers in the championship series which is scheduled to start on Saturday.\nOf course, sport and its role in the space-time continuum are fundamental to the storyline of the Back to the Future trilogy. Without the reference to the Cubs' breakthrough win and the chat with the old man in the Hill Valley square, the seed would never have been planted for Marty to buy the Gray Sports Almanac during his foray into the future and potentially reap the financial benefits.\n\"What's the harm in bringing back a little info on the future? Maybe we can place a couple of bets,\" Marty tells the Doc as they initially prepare to travel back to 1985 before the next part of the storyline intervenes.\nDoc shoots back: \"I didn't invent a time machine to win at gambling. I invented a time machine to travel through time.\"\nBiff (that's the old 2015 Biff and not the youthful 1955 Biff) manages to overhear their conversation and steals Marty's idea. And there's the narrative for the second film right there. Old Biff \"borrows\" the DeLorean and travels back to 1955 to hand deliver to the younger version of himself a guaranteed financial goldmine: the Sports Almanac. Marty and the Doc are forced to travel through time back to stop that event happening and re-set the course of history.\nInserting a sporting almanac into the narrative of a time-travel series was a classic touch, but did the Back to the Future team contemplate the prospect that 2015 would actually be the drought-ending season for the Cubs? Will they be responsible for a remarkable sporting prophecy? Time will tell of course, but for as long as Chicago are alive in the World Series chase, fans of the film can only dream and enjoy the moment.\nGreat Scott!", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/ADXs2C4Vmho"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T21:03:54.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
