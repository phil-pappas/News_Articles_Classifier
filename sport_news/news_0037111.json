The absence makes it unlikely that the cornerback will be available this weekend when the Patriots take on the Indianapolis Colts. According to the NFL Network, Brown is not only likely out for Sunday, but his foot injury is considered “potentially serious” and he’s seeking a second opinion. This isn’t great news for the Patriots. Brown suffered a broken foot last year in Week 15 when he was with the Oakland Raiders. He came out of training camp as the second best cornerback behind Malcolm Butler this summer. Brown started the first two games of the season against Pittsburgh and Buffalo. He didn’t play against Jacksonville and appeared on the injury report for the first time this season after that. The 30-year-old made seven tackles last week against the Cowboys, primarily working in the slot against Cole Beasley. He played 62 percent of the defensive snaps. As it is, the Patriots depth at cornerback isn’t great. With Brown likely out, the Patriots will continue to rely on Butler and Logan Ryan, who has started the past two games on the outside. Ryan has the ability to move in the slot. That’s where he played against Jacksonville, when Brown was out. In that game, Justin Coleman played on the outside opposite of Butler. The Patriots also signed cornerback Rashaan Melvin this week. If Brown’s injury makes it so he can’t play this season, the Patriots will have to look at veteran trade targets to add more depth. Brown was the only player to miss Friday’s practice. Dion Lewis was present after popping up on the practice report Thursday with an abdomen injury. The running back was limited. Dont’a Hightower practiced all week after suffering a ribs injury against Dallas.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:56:55.974+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
