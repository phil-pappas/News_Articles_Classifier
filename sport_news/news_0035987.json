Both players missed the postseason last year due to injuries but enter this season healthy.\n\"Expectations are high and our goal is to win a championship,\" Almeida said.\nThe goaltending appears to be solid, as two of Utah's three goaltenders from last year's squad are on the opening day roster. Ryan Faragher, who attended the Anaheim Ducks Prospects Camp, and Eric Levine combined to go 14-10-2-1 last season.\n  Plenty of fresh faces abound on this year's team as well. Alex Krushelynski is touted as the team's fastest skater and the club is also excited about 21-year-old rookie Josh MacDonald.\n\"We've got a great team here,\" MacDonald said. \"We're starting to gel on the ice, which is good. There is a lot of talent here.\"\nNot only new faces, but new teams will be visiting the Maverik Center. The Central Hockey League combined forces with the ECHL in the offseason and the American Hockey League expanded into California and swallowed old ECHL markets such as Fresno and Bakersfield. \nThe new-look ECHL has 28 teams in all, divided into Eastern and Western conferences. The Grizzlies' schedule is Utah's most diverse since the 2001-02 season in which the team played 13 opponents in the AHL. \nThe Grizzlies will only face three teams in the Eastern Conference this year — the Toledo Walleye and Kalamazoo Wings on the road and the Gwinnett Gladiators at home. New Western Conference foes — the Allen Americans, Quad City Mallards, Rapid City Rush and Tulsa Oilers — will all travel to Utah for the first time.\nHowever, the Grizzlies remain in the same division with longtime rivals Colorado, the Idaho Steelheads and the Alaska Aces, and they will be joined this season by the Rapid City Rush.\nTim Branham enters his third year with the Grizzlies. He is 75-51-17 as Utah coach, guiding the club to the playoffs in each of his first two seasons. Utah has made the postseason 8 consecutive years.\nBranham's expectations are also high.\n\"It's a process,\" he said. \"I want to keep improving every single day and I want to work toward a common goal of winning a championship.\" \nAfter its two games against Colorado, the Grizzlies will return to the Maverik Center on October 23-24 to square off against the defending champion Allen Americans.
