Anthony had hit a home run. (“He’s a good boy,” John said.) And on the subject of unbelievable, we should clarify:\nThis was not unbelievable.\nHeck, Anthony Rizzo predicted something like it publicly in January, when he said the Cubs would win the National League Central. They didn’t win it, but they are heading to the National League Championship Series as the only NL Central team left in the playoffs.\n“Everybody said he was nuts,” John said. “But here we are.”\n• MORE MLB: Full postseason schedule, start times, TV listings\nHere they were, pounding Cardinals’ pitching and generally acting like the Cubs can win the World Series, which was never my interpretation of the Constitution. It’s been 107 years, you know. The Cubs haven’t even played in the World Series since 1945.\nThe Cubs know about the history. Some know the dirty details. As Rizzo said Tuesday night, “This organization’s never won when we were down 0-1. We’ve never clinched at home. We’re doing things that we shouldn’t be doing this year. But we’re having a great time. These fans deserve it.”\nSo yeah, they know. Caring is another matter. They have not talked about the drought all year.\n“Nope, never,” catcher David Ross said. “We’re trying to win baseball games. I’m not worried about what happened last year or 10 years ago or 100 years ago. I’m here to win ballgames. Whatever the history is … it doesn’t matter who was sitting down the leftfield foul pole. It doesn’t matter to me.”\nRoss stood just a short throw from where fan Steve Bartman reached for that Marlins foul ball in 2003. Bartman didn’t cost the Cubs the game, but how the Cubs reacted to it did. They melted down. It was one of many signs over the years that even when the Cubs were good enough, the pressure of fighting history would overwhelm them.\nOn the field after Game 4, owner Tom Ricketts said he had been choked up the last couple of days, seeing all the ‘W’ flags around town, feeling the North Side passion that has built up for more than a century.\n“This is gonna be a great run,” Ricketts said. “We’re gonna go all the way.”\nMLB Video Cubs power way past Cardinals again in Game 4 to win NLDS by Jon Tayler", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Rosenberg_Mike"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:04:14.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
