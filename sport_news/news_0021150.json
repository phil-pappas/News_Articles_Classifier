The Volunteers had dropped three of four, blowing two-touchdown leads in each of their losses.\n\"They had a different look,\" Tennessee coach Butch Jones said. \"This football team was not going to be denied.\"\nThe defeat was doubly painful for Georgia (4-2, 1-2 SEC), which lost star running back Nick Chubb to an injured left knee on the first offensive play.\n\"We're still pretty hopeful that it won't require surgery, but we're not 100 percent sure of that,\" Richt said.\nGeorgia's Reggie Davis dropped a potential game-tying 56-yard pass with less than four minutes left. The Bulldogs drove from their own 1-yard line to Tennessee's 27 in their final possession, but a pass to Malcolm Mitchell in the right corner of the end zone was broken up as time expired.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:33:49.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
