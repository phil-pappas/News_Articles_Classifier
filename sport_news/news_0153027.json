We tell them about clubs and activities that they can get involved in and just try to make them comfortable and welcome. I also write about issues and opinion for the school newspaper, The Torch . I’m the vice president of the Conservative Club, which is politics. We discuss issues and politics and have guest speakers. We had a lawyer from Cuba talk last year. We meet twice a month. As the vice president, I help promote the club and organize meetings. I’m trying to arrange speakers.\n \nQ: Are you political outside of school? \nA: I’ve grown up in that environment. You can always catch me watching Fox News. We’ve had yard signs during campaigns. I love watching the debates, which is bad for my studying (laughs). Those are entertaining. They are intense. I really follow Carly Fiorina. There are so many candidates trying to get attention. I have my favorites, but I’m still developing opinions.\n \nQ: Where do you want political science to take you? \nA: I’d love to go to law school. My ultimate dream is to be on the LPGA Tour. I watch a lot of golf. My favorite is Morgan Pressel. She is the only Jewish player on tour. She lives in Boca Raton. I’m hoping I can run into her when I’m in college.\n \nQ: Tell us about your recruitment. \nA: Florida Atlantic was my No. 1 choice. I wanted to play for a Division I team. FAU is around 30,000 students. I also looked at Florida Gulf Coast, which is in Fort Myers, Fla., and Lynn University, which is in Boca Raton. Lynn has won the Division II championship. I’ve always wanted to live and play golf in Florida.\n \nQ: Did Florida Atlantic approach you? \nA: I wrote a letter to the coach. I sent my scores and swing video to a number of colleges. The Florida Atlantic coach, Kathy Baker-Guadagnino, actually won the 1985 U.S. Women’s Open. Having a coach with that type of experience could take my game to an entirely different level. My grandparents, Ann and Meyer Weisman, live in Boca Raton half the year. My mom’s parents live in Columbus half the year and in Fort Myers, Fla., half the year.\n \nQ: How close do your grandparents live to campus? \nA: It’s about five to 10 minutes. My grandma says I can have Friday night dinners with them. I’l l be able to see aunts and uncles, too.\n \nQ: Who takes the swing videos? \nA: My swing coach, Gerry Hammond. When I picked up a golf club for the first time as a 6-year-old, Gerry was my coach. Every Friday afternoon at 4, you can see me taking a lesson from Gerry. He’s a family friend. Gerry has inspired me.\n \nQ: Did you break your father’s heart playing golf? (Scott Weisman won a state doubles tennis championship in 1984 for Bexley and lettered at Ohio State from 1985-88.) \nA: We had been a tennis family, no question. But my dad also plays golf. We’re out there every Sunday.\n \nQ: You are a Blue Jackets fan? \nA: I am a big fan of hockey. We go to a lot of games. Brandon Dubinsky is my favorite player. I actually played golf with him at Muirfield Village. I did not beat him. He’s a lefty and hits the ball a mile — just kills it.\n \nQ: What else do you do? \nA: I volunteer with the First Tee throughout the year. My high-school coach, Cory Tucker, runs the Columbus branch. We teach golf to inner-city children. Each day, we work on a particular skill. But we also teach life lessons.\n \nQ: Why law school? \nA: My cousin, Aaron Weisman, just graduated from law school. I’ve always looked up to him. I also enjoy writing and having an agenda. I’m an organized person, and I think I’d be comfortable in that course of study. People ask me, “Do you want to go to school that long?” I love school.\n \nQ: Are you an active participant in class? \nA: I raise my hand quite a bit. I always try to sit in the front. For a while it was because I couldn’t see (laughs). I’ve just got my glasses.\n \nmznidar@dispatch.com \n@markznidar", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:16:18.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
