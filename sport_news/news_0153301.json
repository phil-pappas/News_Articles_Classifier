Richard Adam “Rick” Hall on Friday pleaded guilty to a 25-count indictment charging him with child molestation and related charges and was sentenced to 15 years in state prison.\nThe sentence from Chatham County Superior Court Judge Timothy R. Walmsley is concurrent to a 17-year federal sentence imposed Sept. 21, and resulted from a negotiated plea between prosecutors and defense attorney Richard Darden.\nThe state charges were contained in an eight-page indictment returned March 5, 2014, involving four separate victims beginning on Feb. 14, 2006, and continuing until Nov. 21, 2010.\nAssistant District Attorney Emily Puhala had withheld acting on the indictment while the federal case proceeded.\nThere is no parole in federal sentences. In addition to the custody term imposed by U.S. District Chief Judge Lisa Godbey Wood also sentenced Hall, 53, to supervised release “for the rest of your life” once he is released from prison and said he must register as a sex offender.\nHe, a deputy sheriff for 28 years, was arrested Dec. 20, 2013, and has remained in custody since then.\nHe was fired March 7, 2014, two days after the Chatham County grand jury returned the indictment.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/Hall_5.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/Hall_5.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T20:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:51:21.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
