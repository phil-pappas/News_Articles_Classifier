When he starts he makes a difference,\" the coach added. \"There were a lot of questions on our strikers. Giroud and Walcott are outstanding at the moment and that confidence shows.\"\nGiroud is pleased with the consistency Arsenal is showing and insists the competition between himself and Walcott is healthy.\n\"It's nice to win this kind of game after a Champions League game,\" Giroud said. \"The main thing is the team is doing well - that's the best thing for me. As long as we are winning I am pleased with that.\n\"Me and Theo have a good understanding. He was in good form, now it's me, so we try and bring our small game to the big machine.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:29:27.366+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
