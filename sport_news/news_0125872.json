They hit us with an out-and-a-go, a bubble-and-a-go, straight go-around and we just went brain dead and couldn’t cover anything.” \nThe opening kickoff fell between the two Conway kick returners. One was able to recover the kick but was immediately tackled at the 11. \nIt was a quick three-and-out for the Wampus Cats and the resulting punt gave the Bulldogs great field position. \nFrom that drive one could tell it was going to be a tough night for the Conway defense as it took Greenwood five plays to score a touchdown on a 1-yard rush by quarterback Luke Hales, bringing the score to 7-0 after the extra point. \nConway tried to come back with a couple deep passes over the middle, but fell incomplete, causing the Wampus Cats to punt again. \nThis time, the Bulldogs were in their own territory, but that didn’t stop them as Hales dumped a pass over the Conway secondary to wide receiver Ryan Padilla for a 55-yard touchdown pass, bringing the score to 14-0 halfway through the first quarter. It was the first of four touchdown passes for Hales. \n“Those guys are special guys,” Greenwood coach Rick Jones said about the offense. “We are very fortunate. I’ve been around a couple quarterbacks and those guys are pretty special guys. I can’t say enough about them.” \nThe Cats’McCall Dail ran 64 yards for Conway’s first touchdown of the game, bringing the score to 14-6 after a failed extra point. \nAfter forcing Greenwood to its first fourth down, Wampus Cats quarterback Breylin Smith was intercepted by Bulldogs defensive back Jax Burgess. \nGreenwood fired back with an 86-yard touchdown pass from Hales to Padilla, bringing its lead to 15. \nConway fought back on the next drive, but was held to a 17-yard field goal by Christian Underwood bringing the score to 21-9. \nThe Wampus Cats and Bulldogs were trading field goals and touchdowns respectively, which caused Conway to get into a 35-12 hole by halftime. \nGreenwood received the opening kickoff after halftime and scored on a 68-yard touchdown pass from Hales to wide receiver Garrett Collins, giving the Bulldogs a 30-point lead. \nThe Conway offense continued to stall, while the defense was allowing the Bulldogs to drive all over the Wampus Cats, invoking the mercy rule early in the third quarter with a 49-12 lead. \nMidway through the third quarter, Conway started a drive that would result in its final points of the game on a 10-yard touchdown pass from Smith to wide receiver Tanner Thone, bringing the score to 49-19. \nOn their ensuing possession, Greenwood would put the Wampus Cats away with a 44-yard touchdown pass, bringing the score to 56-19. \nIt looked like one of the problems for Conway was yards after catch. A receiver would receive the pass and was hit immediately or fell down, causing the play to be dead. \n“To get ready for Alma, we’ve got to forget about this game and move on,” Ashcraft said. \nFriday, Conway plays the 4-2 Alma Airedales on the road.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:27:02.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
