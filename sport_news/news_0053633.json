On the next play, James picked up two yards. That would be his last carry of the night.\nJames' implausible final stat line: 74 yards on two carries in the Scarlet Knights' 31-24 loss to the No. 4 team in the nation .\nThe obvious question after the game was how the team's starting running back could average 37 yards per carry, but only get two carries?\n\"He did not get banged up,\" interim head coach and running backs coach Norries Wilson said to dismiss one theory for the lack of carries. \"That was actually a function of the rotation. It wasn't on purpose. It's just how the rotation came out.\"\nWilson has been trying to find the right touch to handle a backfield loaded with talent. Wilson's solution has been to evenly rotate series among James, Josh Hicks and Robert Martin, with Justin Goodwin serving as the third-down back.\nThe rotation has been successful, most notably in a 312-yard rushing performance in a 27-14 win over Kansas on Sept. 26 . But the predetermined rotation doesn't account for riding the hot hand, which can lead to a situation like Saturday night when James languished on the bench after breaking the team's longest run of the season.\n\"It was tough, but that's the rotation we have,\" James said. \"Sometimes you might not get that many carries. That's just how it is. I trust the rotation and that's what the coaches want and that's what we do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:59:52.614+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
