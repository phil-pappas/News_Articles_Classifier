The Marauders brought home the Mingus Cup with a win over the Sedona Red Rock Scorpions. It was the first time in four years that Mingus has won the Mingus Cup. The meet was a double dual with Sedona and Northland Prep Academy. NPA went on to beat Mingus. The Marauders only took 16 swimmers to the meet, which was the smallest of the three schools. \"Swimmers stepped up all over the place with great swims from Nick Ruggiero, Danni Schulz, Brandon Gemmill, David Briggs, and Joshua Holcombe,\" Wesbrock said. \"Captains Sean Williams, Caleb Furey, Christine Wills, and Emily Dorris did a fantastic job leading the team to victory.\" The Marauders were at Arizona State University Saturday for the Thunder Pitchfork Invitational. -- Follow Greg Macafee on Twitter @greg_macafee and Instagram @VerdeValleyNews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:53:09.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
