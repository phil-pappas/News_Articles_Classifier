Our best pick of the week now 3-1 on the season. The pick of the week was the Jets across the pond to beat the Dolphins and the Jets pretty much made it look easy by winning and covering the 7-point spread. We had the Giants as a good bet to keep it close and cover against the Bills but they actually won outright for and easy cover. The Packers were 10 points better according to the Specumetrix model so we expected them to win and cover and they did beating the 49ers by 14 and covering the 8-point line. Finally, the suddenly for real Bengals also were a bet for us to win and cover and they did both by defeating the Chiefs and easily covering the 4-point spread. Overall we've gone 12 up and 3 down for a winning percentage of 80 percent. You can see all of the picks at Specumetrix.com . Our approach of only picking the games that we are most comfortable with is a winning strategy so far this year and we look to keep that going this week. The pick of the week is the Jaguars getting three points vs. the Buccaneers. Both teams are bad but Jameis Winston has been a turnover machine for the Bucs and therefore the Specumetrix system likes the Jaguars. We also really like the Rams to cover the 10-point spread against the Packers. Other recommended plays include the Giants minus seven against the reeling 49ers and Steelers to win and cover against the Chargers. In the Monday night tilt, the Bears are a good bet to keep it within the 10-point spread and cover. Remember, the idea is not to pick every game but to pick the winners.
