Susana Martinez on Wednesday shortly before they lined up for the clinic at East San José Elementary School.\nSchool nurses and volunteers in college nursing and pharmacy programs will provide free flu vaccinations to children 17 and younger in some 470 schools across the state through early December, including 90 Albuquerque schools.\n“We’re going to have almost 500 schools where we bring vaccine to you,” Martinez told about 40 first-grade students at the Albuquerque school just minutes before they received vaccinations. “We want to make sure you don’t miss school. You don’t want to miss school because you can’t learn.”\nMartinez also warned the children to wash their hands frequently, cough into their sleeves, and “no fingers in the nose” to avoid getting sick.\nThe School Kids Influenza Immunization Project began in 2008 at 70 New Mexico schools, and has grown each year since, said Anna Pentler, executive director of the New Mexico Immunization Coalition.\nThe program provides vaccine paid for by the federal Vaccines for Children program at no cost to students or their families. Most children receive a FluMist nasal vaccine that protects against four strains of flu virus expected to circulate this winter.\nPentler credited the program for New Mexico’s high rate of childhood flu vaccinations. During the 2014-15 flu season, about 69 percent of New Mexico children aged 5-12 received a flu vaccine, compared with a U.S. rate of 62 percent, according to CDC data.\nMany of the approximately 140 East San José students who received vaccinations on Wednesday are from low-income families and would not have received a flu vaccine were it not for the school-based clinic, said Elizabeth Miller, the school’s nurse. The clinic allows kids to get vaccinated without parents taking off time from work or paying a co-payment, she said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:06:53.762+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
