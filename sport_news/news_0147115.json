(AP Photo/Michael Conroy) Sponsored Links The Associated Press INDIANAPOLIS â€” \nA male usher stopped three female journalists from entering the Jaguars locker room after their loss to the Colts because they were women, asking other men if it was OK before finally allowing them inside. \nGraham Watson of Yahoo Sports and Joey Chandler of the Tuscaloosa News both said on Twitter on Sunday night that they were not allowed inside the locker room after Indianapolis' 16-13 overtime win until the usher first checked to make sure the women were allowed to enter. The women were at the game as part of the Associated Press Sports Editors sports media diversity weekend. \nPublic relations staffs from both the Colts and the Jaguars apologized to the women. \nColts spokesman Avis Roper tells The Associated Press the usher was in an area where he didn't know who was allowed access. \nThe Association for Women in Sports Media says it's unfortunate that such issues continue to exist. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WPXI-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:23:14.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
