After New Orleans kicker Zach Hocker missed an easy field goal at the end of regulation with the game tied up, Drew Brees made up for it in overtime by throwing an 80-yard touchdown pass to C.J. Spiller —the 400th touchdown pass of his career—just 13 seconds into OT.\nIt led to Cowboys fans all over the country flipping out on Twitter. But none of them flipped out quite like Texas governor Greg Abbott . He took to his personal Twitter account to express his frustration with the Cowboys. And he did it in a very, er, interesting way:\n*#%>¥! @Cowboy defense. More porous than the Texas border.\n— Greg Abbott (@GregAbbott_TX) October 5, 2015 Welp. That’s one way to put it! Hey, Governor, at least the Cowboys' defense isn't the Texans' defense , right?\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com .\n[ via SB Nation ]", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/GregAbbott_TX/status/650876302312935424", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js", "https://vine.co/v/e21iau1Jipi/embed/simple", "https://twitter.com/cowboy", "http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000549761/article/jj-watt-texans-pitiful-in-blowout-loss-to-falcons", "http://www.sbnation.com/2015/10/5/9452875/texas-governor-porous-dallas-cowboys-defense-mexico-border"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:29:54.482+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
