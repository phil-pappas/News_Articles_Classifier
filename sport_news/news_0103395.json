Recently, James traveled to Australia to compete as a boxer in the Master Games. He came back with more than a gold medal; James found redemption. \nFrom the outside, it looks like your average hangar nestled to the west of the Tea Airport. \nHead through the door and you are in the ring with Top Flight Boxing and Training where former Olympic hopeful James is putting young newcomers like Aron Baloun through the paces. \n\"I'm assuming he's going to push me a little bit so. I'm assuming it will be hard,\" Baloun said. \nCoaching is something James has loved since he was a kid. After 22 years in law enforcement, it now helps fill his time in retirement. Without it he'd... \n\"Probably die. You hear of policemen, they do nothing after they retire... a lot of them pass away,\" James said. \nIf that's the case, then James will be around for a while with the busy schedule he keeps. \nIt's not every day you see a boxing ring next to a Piper Cherokee airplane. You could say the 58-year-old, who says he feels more like 48, has plenty of projects up in the air. \n\"Only one-percent of one-percent of people are pilots. I always enjoy doing things that other people can't do or won't do,\" James said. \nIt took James eight years to learn how to fly. Recently, he finally felt experienced enough to bring guests in his plane for a ride. \n\"A lot of people would like to do it and if it was easy, as they say, everybody would be doing it. But it's not easy. Flying isn't easy. That probably was the toughest thing I've ever learned to do,\" James said. \nExtremely goal-oriented, fitness and competition have given James' life purpose. A champion boxer when he was young, he almost didn't get into the sport because his mother didn't think he could handle the punishment. \n\"My mom used to call me the cry baby. That's what I was known as because my niece used to beat me up all the time and my mom used to tell me, 'Next time she does this, grab her fingers and bend them back.' When I'd go to grab her fingers, she'd grab mine. There I'd go crying again,\" James said. \nJames would eventually get over his penchant for tears. After entering a boxing competition while he was a student at South Dakota State, he quickly realized he was a natural. \n\"And the way I got good, I just watched videos of some of my best fighters. Muhammad Ali being the main one,\" James said. \nJames later fell short of the 1988 Olympics, losing in the trials. After expecting a second shot at qualifying following a favorable court ruling, he wasn't allowed to hit the ring because of time constraints. Missing out on that opportunity was disappointing. \nDecades later, he had moved on from boxing until he heard of what's called the Master Games. \n\"I saw a guy in his 60s doing it and I said, 'If that guy can do it, I should be able to do it.' I decided in 2014, I'm going to train and get ready for that event,\" James said. \nAs you can see, he's back where he likes to be, on top. In fact, he's just back from his latest triumph, winning a gold medal against tough opponents at the Australian Master Games. \n\"The young thug picks on the old man and the old man knocks him out. That's what these guys are like,\" James said. \nWearing the medal around his neck, you can tell how much the victory means. \n\"It represent the Olympics. Olympic gold. In 1988, I should have been the one in the Olympics. I didn't get that opportunity. Not because of my doing but because of the U.S. Olympic Committee. Now I've got my sweet justice right here,\" James said. \nHe won't rest on the win for long; he's already planning to become a bodybuilder with his daughter next. \n\"I know I have my limitations. I know I got a bad shoulder, a bad knee. But I work within those limitations. I don't let it stop me from doing whatever I want to do,\" James said. \nIt's a mindset he passes along to his clients. James is inspiring Baloun to try new things. Day one of boxing may be a slow go but over time, it will develop into a useful skill for this family man. \n\"It's better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it. I think I might have stolen that one from Jerry as well,\" Baloun said. \n\"If you've got the time and dedication to put into it, anybody can learn,\" James said. \nAs long as you don't let your age put you up against the ropes. \nJames is hoping to win a gold medal in bodybuilding next year. With his drive, we won't bet against him. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
