(Photo by Christian Petersen/Getty Images) The Chicago Bears had an opportunity to get to the .500 mark on Sunday against the Detroit Lions, but they missed out on the chance as they fell by a score of 37-34. On the Lions' first drive of the game, they moved the ball quickly thanks to big runs from Ameer Abdullah and a long reception from Golden Tate, and they ultimately took advantage of a Bears coverage breakdown to score. Lance Moore got inside position on Sherrick McManis and snared a 20-yard touchdown reception to give Detroit a 7-0 lead.

Eddie Royal made a big play on a screen pass as he made his way through traffic to get the Bears into the red zone. That is where they would stay, however, as Jay Cutler's read option run and an incomplete pass forced the team to settle for a 27-yard field goal by Robbie Gould to make it a 7-3 game. The Lions' next drive ended quickly as Jarvis Jenkins and Eddie Goldman teamed up to sack Matthew Stafford, and the Bears' offense made some big plays on their way to a touchdown. Alshon Jeffery made a couple of big plays to help move the ball down the field, and Matt Forte's running also contributed. Neither player figured in the touchdown, however, as Jeremy Langford got the carry and dove across the goal line for a one-yard touchdown and a 10-7 Bears lead.

The Bears appeared to be stalling out near midfield on their next drive, but after eluding two potential tacklers, Cutler heaved the ball down the field and found Jeffery open to give the Bears a first-and-goal opportunity. Unfortunately for Chicago, they were unable to punch the ball in, and after a pass intented for Bennett fell incomplete, Gould kicked through a short field goal to make it a 14-13 game. Cubs-Mets NLCS Schedule: Game Dates, Times The Lions responded with a scoring drive of their own to extend their lead before the half, but not without a fair amount of controversy. After Golden Tate caught the ball near the goal line, it was knocked out of his hands by Kyle Fuller. The ball ended up in the arms of Jonathan Anderson, but after a video review, it was ruled that Tate scored, giving the Lions a 21-13 lead at halftime. On their first possession of the second half, the Bears got a couple of great plays out of Cutler as he scrambled to find Marquess Wilson and Bennett for long first down completions, but the quarterback made a mistake in the red zone that cost the team dearly. On a fade route to Jeffery, Cutler badly underthrew the receiver and had the pass intercepted to keep the Bears down by eight points.

After the Lions got a field goal of their own to make it a 24-16 game, the Bears got another huge break.

The Lions' next drive got off to a rollicking start thanks to a Golden Tate catch and a fake punt that gave them new life, but they ultimately were forced to settle for a field goal that made it a 31-27 game with a little under three minutes to go. Video 'Back to the Future' Stars Talk Film's Predictions It appeared that the Bears had finished off the game after a Stafford pass fell incomplete late in the game, but a flag for roughing the passer extended the drive and allowed the Lions to score. Stafford lofted up a pass that Calvin Johnson came down with in the back of the end zone, and the Lions seized a 34-31 lead with just 21 seconds to go in the game. Fortunately for the Bears, they were able to get down the field quickly and kick a game-tying field goal. Cutler found Jeffery for two long completions, and Gould booted through the field goal to knot things up at 34-34 and force an overtime period.
