Her car's front end was crumpled. My rear end was dented and detached. The bumper of the van in front of me — the van that had been waiting to turn left while I idled behind — was chewed up.\nI sighed.\n\"Were you using your cellphone when it happened?\"\nShe grimaced.\n\"Yeah.\"\nI gave her points for honesty, but yeah, of course yeah. What else, short of a stroke or faulty brakes, would cause her to slam into a car?\nThe mating of cars and cellphones has been recognized as dangerous since humans first gained the ability to hurtle along in steel machines while texting, dialing and checking Facebook.\nIf knowledge were wisdom, we'd stop doing it. By \"we\" I mean every driver who ever irresponsibly used a cellphone. By \"irresponsibly,\" I mean anything that involves the driver taking her eyes or mind off the road for longer than it takes to say \"car crash.\"\nVoice commands while driving still distracting and risky, AAA study says Jerry Hirsch Drivers who use hands-free commands remain distracted for up to 27 seconds after they have made a call or changed music, according to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.\nWorking with researchers at the University of Utah, the auto club’s safety branch found that this lingering distraction raises...\nDrivers who use hands-free commands remain distracted for up to 27 seconds after they have made a call or changed music, according to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.\nWorking with researchers at the University of Utah, the auto club’s safety branch found that this lingering distraction raises...\n(Jerry Hirsch) And yet, for all the yammer and all the laws designed to break us of our bad habits, drivers by the millions continue to roll merrily along the deadly path.\n\"People very much have a do-as-I-say mentality,\" Beth Mosher, director of public affairs at AAA Chicago, said when I called Thursday. \"They don't want distracted driving on the road. If you ask people, and we have, 'What is your biggest traffic safety fear on the roadways?' they say distracted driving or drunken driving. But when we ask those same people, 'Do you text and drive?' the majority say yes.\"\nAs it happens, on Thursday AAA had just released its latest study on distracted driving, an analysis of hands-free, voice-activated systems in cars, the kind most drivers imagine are safe.\nImagine again.\n\"You can have your hands on the wheel, your eyes on the road, seemingly paying attention and legally using your car system to send out a text,\" Mosher said, \"but your mind is otherwise engaged.\"\nI have a car with a so-called hands-off phone system. I also have a phone that takes voice orders while I'm in the car.\nI still wind up fiddling with them while I'm driving or glancing to see if they're following my commands. I've long had a sense they distract me dangerously and the AAA study reinforces it.\nThe researchers looked at three types of smartphones and at infotainment technologies in 10 brands of car — systems that let you send a text, make a call, change the music.\nGoogle Now, Apple Siri, Microsoft Cortana? All were rated highly distracting.\nSome of the in-vehicle systems were deemed less distracting than others, but all had the potential to lure drivers into risky behavior.\n\"One of the things we highlighted in this study — and so many people are guilty of it — is how people stop at a light and think, 'This is when I'm going to send out that quick email or text,' \" Mosher said. \"The car's stopped. You're not going anywhere. But this study shows that the distraction can last up to 27 seconds.\"\nIn other words, it can take almost half a minute to come back to full attention after you've sent that text or checked your voice mail. You may be rolling along by then, still fixated on the idiotic message from your boss.\nIt's hard to know if drivers are getting better or worse in this regard. Mosher says there's no reliable data, but I'd vote for worse.\nLots of drivers still cruise around with a phone blithely pressed to their ear. Many of us who avoid that trap are guilty of other risky behaviors. Almost all of us are addicted to the convenience of communicating in the car.\nBut here's something really inconvenient: a car crash.\nIf you've ever been in one, you know the jolt, the dismay, the realization of how quickly an accident could change your life, or end it.\n\"Sometimes it takes crashes for people to wake up,\" Mosher said.\nI'm guessing the woman who rear-ended me won't be on the phone in the car again soon. I need to tidy up my habits too.\nOne day better technology may help us stay safe. Until then, we have to do it for ourselves.\nmschmich@chicagotribune.com\nTwitter @MarySchmich\n AAA", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56297c47/turbine/ct-schmich-cell-phones-met-1023-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5628fcde/turbine/la-fi-hy-aaa-distracted-driving-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:16:47.301+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
