Growing up, there were some things I could never understand: What was it that Meat Loaf wouldn’t do for love? Did that owl really know how many licks it took to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop? How could anyone tell the difference between Kurt Russell and Patrick Swayze?\nBut most confusing was college football. How was it the only major sport that couldn’t always agree on a national champion, that couldn’t figure out how to have the top teams play each other in the final game of the season? The College Football Playoff has helped reduce the likelihood of such scenarios — and will do so even more successfully upon the inevitable, though still not imminent expansion to an eight-team tournament — but a confounding problem still exists: Roughly half the teams are eliminated from championship contention before the season starts.\nUnlike college basketball, where any team can advance to the NCAA Tournament, the structure of the college football season and the incentive for major programs to schedule the least threatening opponents possible in non-conference play makes it nearly impossible for any team not from a Power Five conference to reach the playoff.\nFollowing Memphis’ impressive win over Mississippi, the American Athletic Conference now has three teams (Houston and Temple are the others) in the AP Top 25 but even if any of them — or Toledo, also in the Top 25 and from the Mid-American Conference — run the table, it’s unfathomable to believe that team would supplant two power-conference champions. Last year, TCU and Baylor held equal, if not better, credentials than eventual national champion Ohio State, but were excluded. If the Big 12 gets left out, what shot does the Mid-American have?\nWhat’s most baffling is that Butler and Villanova and Wichita State have proven in basketball that the most unexpected moments become the most interesting and memorable moments. Boise State proved that in the incredible Fiesta Bowl upset of Oklahoma in the 2007 — a game that essentially was played for nothing more than pride.\nNow, imagine if the Broncos got to play another game that year. Imagine if the title were on the line. Unfortunately, imagining is all we and the overlooked programs can do. This weekend, the eventual road to disappointment may start, with TULSA (+10¹/₂) giving Memphis a serious test, while EAST CAROLINA (-3) kicks Temple from the rankings, one week after breaking its 36-year hiatus.\nCalifornia (+3) over UCLA: The decimated Bruins’ defense — allowing an average of more than 41 points over the past three games — is in for another long night. Jared Goff has had two weeks to prepare and is due for a big bounce-back after his five-interception head-scratcher against Utah.\nSYRACUSE (+6) over Pittsburgh: One day, I will get used to these teams being in the ACC. Today is still not that day.\nIowa State (+37) over BAYLOR: Even the nation’s best offense isn’t worth that price.\nClemson (-7) over MIAMI: The Clemson collapse isn’t coming. This team is different. And Deshaun Watson is the reason.\nTennessee (+15¹/₂) over ALABAMA: The Crimson Tide rarely carry the same swagger when the spread slides over two touchdowns, while the Volunteers already have come painfully close to upsets of Oklahoma and Florida this season.\nIndiana (+16½) over MICHIGAN STATE: After one of the most improbable and thrilling wins in college football history, the Spartans will revert to the team that barely seemed interested in its first six games — all failed covers — while facing another uninspiring opponent.\nMichigan State coach Mark Dantonio Photo: Getty Images Texas Tech (+15) over OKLAHOMA: The Sooners’ blowout win over Kansas State proved they still may end up atop the Big 12, but the Red Raiders’ offense is capable of going toe-to-toe with just about any team in the country.\nKansas (+34) over OKLAHOMA STATE: The Cowboys need to prove they’re a top-15 team before getting the respect that comes with this line.\nTexas A&M (+6) over MISSISSIPPI: Which version of the Rebels will show? The victors at Alabama or the frauds who folded at Memphis? I’m not laying points to find out.\nWestern Kentucky (+16½) over LSU: There’s a reason this game is being played in Baton Rouge. Switch the fields and the ending wouldn’t be so obvious.\nFlorida State (-6½) over GEORGIA TECH: While the Seminoles are starting to peak with Everett Golson’s improved play, the Yellow Jackets have flushed all reason to believe, losing five straight games. The fact that these two teams met in last year’s ACC title game soon will seem that much more remarkable.\nUSC (-3½) over Utah: A line that looks insane will soon become clear. While the Trojans’ problems have been exaggerated because of the departure of Steve Sarkisian, the Utes’ inconsistencies have been masked by an undefeated record.\nRUTGERS (+21) over Ohio State: Urban Meyer finally made the right move by putting in J.T. Barrett as the starting quarterback, but the Buckeyes’ defense doesn’t yet look to be the dominant force it appeared over the summer that it would be.\nBest bets: Tulsa, Indiana, Tennessee\n2015 record: 54-49-2\nBest Bets: 11-9-1\nLast season: 139-122-2\nFollow @HowieKussoy on Twitter for additional picks\n\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under bettor's guide ,  college football ,  pigskin profit", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:21:33.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
