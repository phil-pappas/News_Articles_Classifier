David LaChance said.\nLaChance says one of his officers had been tracking Magnetic Sims, 31, of Newark, New Jersey. LaChance says Sims was the subject of an ongoing investigation into heroin trafficking. Rutland police were notified when he was headed to New York City and making his way back up to Vermont.\n\"Through contacts with the Amtrak police, he was able to determine that he did in fact go down on the train from Rutland, Vermont, to New York City. And was advised when he was en route back to Vermont,\" LaChance said.\nLaChance says police had enough evidence to get a warrant to search Sims the moment he stepped off the train. They say they found the heroin and arrested him.\nSims denies the drug trafficking charges against him. He's facing up to 70 years in jail and is being held on $200,000 bail.\nSims' arrest is just one of many heroin-related arrests Vermont police forces have made at Amtrak stops. In August, another New Jersey man was arrested after police seized over 2,000 bags of heroin from him at the stop in Essex Junction. Two different Amtrak lines, two more drug carriers. Now the question is-- how can police stop it from happening again?\nPeople took to social media after Sims' arrest urging better inspections. Barbara wrote on Facebook, \"It's about time that the trains also do the same as airports. Scan them and start going thru the baggage. Don't understand why they don't.\" And Charlotte said, \"Drug dogs at train station would be a great deterrent.\"\nLaChance says he'd like that too to sniff out offenders, but he can't authorize it. He says drug dogs need to be approved by Amtrak.\n\"There's been questions as far as legally, as far as stopping people coming off the train. So when we have solid information-- like we had in this case-- it makes it much easier,\" LaChance said.\nAn Amtrak spokesperson says the company serves more than 500 destinations and has 300 different routes, so there is no way they can control everything that goes on. He says they work with local police departments to help monitor the passenger trains and who's riding them.\n\"It's our job to talk to the employees of the train, too. Conductors-- they see these people every trip. They know where they're getting off,\" LaChance said.\nLaChance says train workers are authorized to share passengers' identifications with police. That is one way they confirmed Sims was on the train Wednesday night. And the detective hopes that cooperation will lead to other drug offenders, too, that he's certain are riding the rails.\nA Rutland judge chose to hold Sims on a pricey bail because he said there was a significant risk that Sims wouldn't appear in court based on the two serious charges, Sims' lack of connections to the Rutland area and the length of the potential sentence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:35:50.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
