We’ll get there eventually.)\nThe Chargers are back on Monday night for the first time since last season’s opener in Arizona, and they welcome the ESPN Monday night crew to Qualcomm Stadium for the first time in nearly two calendar years for an appointment with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\nIt is the only game of the day, and there is peer pressure involved. Players are aware the rest of the league is watching.\n“You’re that last game of the week,” Chargers coach Mike McCoy said. “All your buddies, wherever they are throughout the league, are watching you. It’s an opportunity for players and organizations to showcase themselves.”\nBut while the whole NFL community may be watching, what about the general viewing public? Not so much any more, even with a landscape where anything involving football is all but guaranteed a big TV rating.\nOnce ABC relinquished the Monday rights to ESPN in 2006, and NBC negotiated to take over the Sunday night window that had previously belonged to ESPN, the equation changed dramatically.\nNBC’s production is routinely the highest-rated TV show of the week. Through four weeks of the 2015 season, the Sunday night game has averaged just a tick under 25 million viewers per week and was the No. 1 show all told for three of those four weeks.\nThe week it wasn’t? The first one, and the show that beat it out was the Thursday night opener, also on NBC, with 27.3 million viewers tuning in for the Patriots and Steelers. Three nights later, the Cowboys and Giants lured 26.7 million viewers into the tent.\nThe second highest-rated show on TV most weeks has been CBS’ Thursday night telecasts, with the combined viewership on CBS and the NFL Network putting those figures just a tick below NBC’s ratings.\nESPN and Monday night? Good, for cable. Those games have averaged 13.6 million viewers per game over the first four weeks, leading each week’s cable ratings but well below the Sunday night numbers.\nI’m not sure even Pete Rozelle and Roone Arledge ever imagined so much prime time football could be so popular, when the NFL commissioner and the president of ABC Sports agreed to move a game to Monday night every week beginning in 1970.\nIn those early years, the ratings were big but the game’s stature was bigger. When Howard Cosell, Don Meredith, Frank Gifford and the rest of the traveling circus arrived, your town was the center of the world for a night.\n“Monday Night Football” was often as much performance art as football game during the Cosell-Meredith era. People watched to see what they’d say or do next, even – maybe especially – those who claimed they couldn’t stand the abrasive Cosell.\nEven during the later years on ABC, when Al Michaels and John Madden steered the ship, the chemistry of the broadcasters could make up for a stinker of a game.\nThat brings us to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit. (Told you we’d get here.)\nThe character was one of the first created by Walt Disney for Universal Pictures in the 1920s, but when Walt left Universal the character stayed behind.\nFlash forward almost 80 years. NBC, which wanted Michaels for “Sunday Night Football,” acquired him from Disney, parent company of ABC and ESPN, by trading the rights to Oswald.\nIt was a good move for Mike Tirico, who has been ESPN’s main Monday night voice since 2006. It was a great move for Michaels, who was joined by Madden at NBC and has since established similar chemistry with Cris Collinsworth.\nMonday night will never be what it was. But it’s still the only game in town.\nThe Chargers, even with some lengthy absences from the showcase game (1987 through 1992 and ’97 through 2002), have played 42 times on Monday night, 26 of them at home. They’re 21-21, with two (this week and Nov. 9 against the Bears) on this year’s schedule.\nThey’re .500 on Sunday nights as well, 6-6, and they’re scheduled to face Kansas City in a Sunday night game Nov. 22. But that falls within NBC’s flex scheduling window, meaning it could be bumped for a more meaningful game.\nThat one, in other words, the Chargers will have to earn.\nContact the writer: jalexander@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T13:32:43.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
