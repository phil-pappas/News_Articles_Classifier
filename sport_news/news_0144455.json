Butt has only seven catches combined in the three games since and no touchdowns, while four other tight ends — Ian Bunting, A.J. Williams, Khalid Hill and Henry Poggi — have each caught passes.\n\"We played six guys in the game last week. I wish we could have played seven,\" tight ends coach Jay Harbaugh said this week. \"By nature, it's a little more involved as a group because this guy's in, that guy's in. It's not just the 'Jake Butt Show' as I think has been evident the last few weeks.\"\nSpreading the ball around is Harbaugh's preference instead of using one primary target, regardless of how talented Butt is.\n\"From the get-go they were really, really excited to be part of this scheme, and I think it's obvious why. The opportunities in terms of playing time and the diversity of assignments and responsibility is kind of unparalleled at this level,\" Harbaugh said. \"It's really not close what we ask them to do, and the ball's getting thrown to them. We throw the ball eight times per game to my group, and I don't think anyone else is that high in the country. I don't think anyone else is even close.\"\nThe tight ends all can be used for explosive plays. Against BYU, Butt was hit on a seam for a 41-yard gain, and Hill was on the receiving end of Jake Rudock's play fake for a 20-yard gain down the middle. Against Oregon State, Williams had a 22-yard gain, Bunting a 21-yarder.\n\"Coaches give an opportunity to everyone, not just somebody who is a certain type of guy,\" Williams said. \"He just encourages everybody to get involved the best way you can.\"\nContact Mark Snyder at msnyder@freepress.com .
