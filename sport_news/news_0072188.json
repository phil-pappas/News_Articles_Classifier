I knew if I beat that one guy and the guy wasn’t behind me, it was just me and the punter and the boys were there.\n“We’re always talking about making plays on special teams. It’s just one of those things I need to learn from. The most important thing is protecting the ball.”\nQuarterback Colin Kaepernick re-discovered his mojo to earn man of the match with 340 pass-yards and no interceptions in regular play.\nHowever, it wasn’t such good news day for Hayne.\nBack in the win column like pic.twitter.com/qSnLYI1KWW\n— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) October 18, 2015 With star running back Reggie Bush ruled out before the game with a calf injury and kick-return specialist Bruce Ellington also inactive with a calf complaint, Hayne was expected to see major game time, but he was largely unsighted after an ugly start to the match.\nHayne coughed up the ball with his third fumble of the season with his first punt return of the game.\nIt was his only carry of the match as coach Jim Tomsula refused to use the Aussie at running back.\nHe finished with stats of one punt return for a four yard gain with one fair catch and another punt he left untouched.\nIt was a day of mistakes for the Aussie. Here are his three biggest blunders.\n1. HAYNE FUMBLES PUNT\nJARRYD Hayne’s day got off to a nightmare start when he made his third fumble from six games in the NFL.\nIt was the only time Hayne got to run the ball against the Ravens.\nHayne marked the punt close to the sideline on his own 30-yard line and danced his way through a crowd into the middle of the field for a five yard gain before he was heavily tackled from behind.\nHayne dropped the ball backwards in the crunching tackle and it would have been a disaster for San Francisco if cornerback Dontae Johnson wasn’t able to dive on the loose ball.\nIt was a bad start for the Aussie and the reaction on social media was not forgiving.\n. @49ers On #7Mate . @JarrydHayne fumble. http://t.co/7mZ2Ibl46U #BALvsSF http://t.co/o1hG2ZdoXt\n— 7 News Sydney (@7NewsSydney) October 18, 2015 Jarryd Hayne beats a heap of blokes on first punt return... but Fumbles the ball... he fumbled the ball... lucky his teammate fell on it.\n— Brenton Speed (@BrentonSpeed) October 18, 2015 Jarryd Hayne sponsored by Butter Fingers\n— Mitchell Gardner (@GWade92) October 18, 2015 Jarryd Hayne is trash lol. I don&apos;t know why there&apos;s so much hype about him.\n— Max Merry (@maxxuhmillion) October 18, 2015 That @dkurtenbach is a shocker - \"So Jarryd Hayne can’t run from scrimmage and now he’s a liability in the punt return game……. 🇦🇺\"\n— Matthew Murphy (@TheMurphstar) October 18, 2015 2. HAYNE CONFUSES FAIR CATCH\nJARRYD Hayne’s second blunder again came with the 27-year-old at punt-returner.\nWith the clock winding down at the end of the first half, Hayne fielded a difficult punt on his own seven-yard line after scrambling towards the sideline to make the catch.\nThe former NRL star called a fair catch early, but was still put under pressure by the Ravens’ special teams defence.\nThe decision to call a fair catch was also heavily criticised with one American NFL expert summarising the 49ers performance by saying: “Kaepernick up, Hayne down”.\n“The Australian rugby league convert fumbled his first punt return, though the 49ers somehow recovered despite there being a sea of Ravens players around the ball, and Hayne later made a fair catch of another punt inside the 49ers’ 10-yard line,” ESPN staff writer Paul Guterrez said. “That’s a no-no.”\nJarryd Hayne calls for the fair catch and the #49ers will have one more drive before half. 1st & 10 from the 8 w/ :40 remaining. #BALvsSF\n— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) October 18, 2015 3. HAYNE MISSES BLOCK\nROOKIE Jarryd Hayne got some meaningful game time on the field in the second half on the San Francisco offensive team, but never got to touch the ball.\nHayne stepped in to give star running back Carlos Hyde a breather, but quarterback Colin Kaepernick ignored Hayne to focus on his passing game.\nHayne was then expected to provide some protection coverage for Kaepernick, but made one bad miss and was quickly taken off the field.\nWhile Hyde was on the sideline struggling with his foot injury, Hayne missed a block on\na Ravens linebacker, which led to Kaepernick getting sacked.\nFeel the breeze...

Davis’ run did not gain any yardage.\nDespite Hyde carrying a foot injury, Tomsula continued to call on him ahead of Hayne and Davis.\nHyde finished with 21 runs for 55 yards and a longest gain of 14 yards.\nTomsula said he has noticed his team improving this season.\n“We’re measured by the wins and losses columns,” he said.\n“Getting one in the left column is important for us.\n“The guys come to work every day. I see them getting better every day. This is a good team. It’s a good group of guys willing to work.\n“Every time you win it’s a very good thing.”\nTomsula confirmed Hyde aggravated his foot injury during the match, but does not believe it is a serious concern.\n“Carlos, the foot got a little sore there,” he said.\n“It’s no secret. We just tried to take it easy on him there and give the other guys some reps. We’ll just continue to stay on top of that.”\nHyde said he is hopeful of playing against 49ers divisional rivals Seattle next week.\n“I just tried to put too much pressure on it. Too much weight on it,” he said.\n“It hurts when I put too much weight on it.\n“It just shocked me. How much it hurt when I tried to put too much weight on it. So I just went down.”\nHyde said he will “definitely be ready” to play the Seahawks on Friday morning AEDT, but admitted he finds it difficult to step off his injured leg.\nHere’s how Hayne’s tough day played out.\nAt least he caught this one. Source: AFP\nFIRST QUARTER\nWITH Bruce Ellington inactive with a calf injury Aussie Jarryd Hayne was expected to be promoted to kick return duties, however the first kick-off of the game featured 49ers returner DeAndrew White stepping in for Ellington with Hayne on the sidelines.\nWhite took a touchback to let the Niners’ attack start their first drive from the 20-yard line.\nHayne stepped onto field for the first Ravens’ punt of the game after the Niners’ defence stopped Baltimore inside their own half.\nHayne marked the punt close to the sideline on his own 30-yard line and danced his way through a crowd into the middle of the field for a five yard gain before he was heavily tackled from behind.\nHayne dropped the ball in the crunching tackle and it would have been a disaster for San Francisco if cornerback Dontae Johnson wasn’t able to dive on the loose ball.\nHayne wasn’t dropped when the Ravens were next forced to punt with five minutes left in the first quarter.\nThe kick bounced along the turf towards the sideline and stopped 14 yards out from the Niners’ defensive endzone with Hayne not given a chance to run the ball back.\nHayne also stepped into the game as a receiving option on the 49ers next drive.\nHe lined up on quarterback Colin Kaepernick’s left, but wasn’t used as Kaepernick instead passed to Anquan Boldin on the right side.\nThe Niners made back to back drives which ended in field goal opportunities for kicker Phil Dawson, who converted both goals to give San Francisco an early lead. 49ers 6-0 .\nSECOND QUARTER\nBALTIMORE came close to scoring with their next drive, but were forced to take a field goal at fourth and goal early in the second quarter. 49ers 6-3 .\nHayne was again overlooked at kick return in favour of DeAndrew White.\nOn the next drive Colin Kaepernick threw a monster downfield pass to receiver Torrey Smith who ran into the endzone untouched for a huge 76-yard touchdown play. 49ers 13-3 .\nThe Ravens were also forced to settle for three points on their next drive when Kaepernick was almost picked off, trying to convert on third down. Dawson again slotted the goal to extend the Niners’ lead. 49ers 16-3 .\nHayne took a fair catch on the final punt of the half. He stepped in for three punts in the first half, but only made one carry for a four yard gain and one fumble.\nJarryd Hayne calls for the fair catch and the #49ers will have one more drive before half. 1st & 10 from the 8 w/ :40 remaining. #BALvsSF\n— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) October 18, 2015 At half time primary running back Carlos Hyde had 12 carries for 48 yards as well as two receives for five yards.\nBoth Hayne and Mike Davis were not used at running back for the Niners’ in the first half with Hyde and Kaepernick the only Niners to make a rushing play.\nCoach Jim Tomsula said he was happy with the half time score, but concerned about his team’s failure to convert touchdowns in the Ravens’ redzone.\n“We’ve got to find more success in the redzone,” Tomsula said.\n“We appreciate field goals, but we need seven (points). So we’ve got to punch it out.”\nHalftime, 49ers 16-6 .\nTHIRD QUARTER\nKEY 49ers running back Carlos Hyde went down injured in his first run of the second half.\nTrying to cut through the Ravens’ defence, Hyde fell down with an apparent ankle injury, however the Niners’ star did carry a foot injury into the game.\nSan Francisco took an injury time-out.\nHayne immediately stepped in for perhaps the biggest shot of his NFL career with the Niners’ just 40 yards from the endzone.\nHayne was in the game for two plays while Hyde received treatment, however Kaepernick threw the ball on both plays before Hyde returned and replaced the Aussie.\nJarryd Hayne may score a Touchdown here... Prepare for Australian tweets.\n— Chadwiko Menendez (@ChadwikoRCC) October 18, 2015 The Niners again fell short converting a first down in the redzone and were again forced to settle for three points from a field goal at the end of the drive. 4 9e rs 19-6 .\nThe Ravens hit back when quarterback Joe Flacco launched a sensational pass deep in the endzone to Steve Smith. The 34-yard touchdown play got the visitors back in the game. 49ers 19-13 .\nDeAndrew White stepped into the game as kick-returner again, but the kick sailed over the endzone to give San Francisco a re-start on the 20-yard line.\nHayne stepped into the game at running back for a series of downs in the third quarter but did not get given the ball with the 49ers instead relying on Kaepernick to make a series of passes.\nHyde was on the sideline and appears to be struggling with his foot injury.\nHayne did have to provide protection for Kaepernick on a number of plays and he missed a block on a Ravens linebacker in the lead up to the Niners’ quarterback getting sacked.\nHyde returned to the game straight after the miss.\nFOURTH QUARTER\nSAN Francisco extended their lead when Kaepernick found receiver Quinton Patton wide open in the endzone.\nHowever, the 49ers failed to convert a two-point play attempt.\nKaepernick was forced to pass under pressure and was picked off. 49ers 25-13 .\nThe Ravens hit back again when Flacco ran wide and found Kamar Aiken in the endzone with a 20-yard pass. It was a huge conversion with the game slipping away from the visitors at fourth and goal.\nThe score made it a one possession game. 49ers 25-20 .\nHayne was given a run at kick-returner for the first time in the NFL, but the kick sailed long.\nMike Davis stepped into the game to give Hyde a break, relegating Hayne to the pine.\nDavis’ run took the game to the two-minute warning with the 49ers only needing to hold onto the ball for their second win of the season.\nThe Ravens launched one final drive to try and steal the game with Flacco moving the chains to the 41-yard line with 13 seconds remaining.\nFlacco’s hail-Mary final throw into the endzone was knocked away by safety Eric Reid to give the 49ers a big win.\nFull time 49ers 25-20 .\nPRE-MATCH\nJarryd Hayne will get some serious snaps.
