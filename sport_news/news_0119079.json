AL DIAZ adiaz@miamiherald.com i Order Reprint of this Story \nNow, the vultures are circling as well as those “Fire Al Golden” banner planes. \nThe boos began as No. 6 Clemson scored its third touchdown of the day late in the first quarter, a few minutes before University of Miami quarterback Brad Kaaya was sent to the locker room with an apparent concussion after being pummeled for the second time. \nA few minutes later, fans began exiting Sun Life Stadium – just like UM’s season seemed to have exited any realm of hope. \nWhatever could go wrong, pretty much did Saturday at Sun Life Stadium, where the Tigers humiliated the Canes 58-0 in the worst defeat in UM history. UM head coach Al Golden speaks after the 58-0 loss to the Clemson Tigers on Saturday, Oct. 24, 2015. \nAfter one quarter the score was 21-0. \nAt halftime the score was 42-0. \nAfter three quarters: 45-0. \nNot star Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson, not backup Clemson quarterback Nick Schuessler, but third string freshman quarterback Kelly Bryant ran 59 yards to cap a 4-play drive to make it 51-0 after the extra point failed with 11:48 left in the game. \nBefore this, the worst margin of defeat for the Hurricanes was a 70-14 loss to Texas A&M on Dec. 8, 1944. \nThe worst shutout loss in Miami history was a 52-0 loss to Samford in 1927. \nHow bad was it? \nFormer UM national champion Joaquin Gonzalez, who was honored during the game for being part of the upcoming 2016 UM Sports Hall of Fame class, posted this tweet aimed at Canes coach Golden and “@CanesAllAccess’’ – athletic director Blake James – “I’m done holding my tongue! This guy needs to leave South Florida…I will buy his plane ticket!!! Economy!!!’’ @GoldenAl @CanesAllAccess I&#39;m done holding my tongue! This guy needs to leave south Florida....I will buy his plane ticket!!! Economy!!! &mdash; Joaquin Gonzalez (@Joaquin_UMOL73) October 24, 2015 \nLater, Gonzalez tweeted to James that he should “take his headset at halftime!! Do not wait until end of season, make a statement dammit!!!!” \nOther former UM players joined in. Former defensive tackle Warren Sapp after Kaaya was sacked and left the game on the second play of the second quarter: “2-man Rush sack #MyLawd.’’ \nWatson, who leads the ACC with 15 touchdowns, completed 15 of 19 passes for 143 yards and a touchdown before he was replaced. \nKaaya, who came into the game with a league-leading 1,795 yards, completed six of 10 passes for 51 yards and an interception before he was hurt. \nAlso injured: UM’s leading receiver Rashawn Scott, in the fourth quarter. \nUM allowed 567 total yards – 416 of them rushing, and gained a sickly 146. \nKaaya’s backup, redshirt freshman Malik Rosier, had seven of 22 passes for 42 yards, with two interceptions. \nClemson (7-0, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference), which could end up back at Sun Life celebrating New Year’s Eve in the College Football Playoff semifinal, looked like a national contender. \nMiami, (4-3, 1-2) travels to Durham, North Carolina, next Saturday for a 7 p.m. game against Coastal Division foe Duke, ranked 23 rd this past week. \nSusan Miller Degnan: 305-376-3366 , @smillerdegnan Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:54:28.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
