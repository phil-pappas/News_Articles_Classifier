Place Sunday. The Caps won 3-0. Photograph by: Mark van Manen , PNG \nIn honour of the Toronto Blue Jays, here’s something else that’s good every 22 years, the Monday morning musings and meditations on the world of sports: \n— The deeper meaner of the Vancouver Whitecaps’ 3-0 victory over Houston on Sunday won’t be revealed until their playoffs are complete but the mere fact the Caps are now talking about what lies ahead instead the mess they left behind is a significant development for this team. \nHeading into this season, it was imperative the Caps offered concrete evidence that their long-range plan was working, that their younger players were developing into difference-makers and would form the nucleus of an elite team. \nThis season, alas, did not supply that concrete evidence but the Caps, who finished 16-13-5, will still host their first-ever MLS playoff game they still finished second in the Western Conference and those are significant achievements. \nAs for the plan, well, the jury is still out. Three years ago, the Whitecaps made the playoffs and were bounced in the first round by Los Angeles but the presumption was the team would continue to grow. Gerson Koffie, Russell Teibert and Darron Mattocks were on the 2012 Caps. Kekuta Manneh, who scored the crucial first goal on Sunday, was added the following year and Matias Laba arrived last year. All are still young. All, more or less, are still promising. But the Caps are still waiting for a payoff from those players. \nMLS, meanwhile, is trending toward bigger names and bigger stars. For the Whitecaps to keep pace with the league’s elite teams, that young core will have to take another step forward or the organization will have to rethink its philosophy. \nIt all starts with their playoff, against an undetermined opponent on the road Nov. 1 and at home Nov. 8. It just doesn’t end there. \n— Had a think over the Canucks’ recent travails and came up with this. \nLast season, when they closed out games confidently and efficiently, Willie Desjardins’ squad had a distinct identity. They were a four-line, six-defence team that divided the work load evenly. \nEven though they were a largely veteran outfit, that approach enabled them to keep the pressure and the pace up, which, in turn, allowed them to control the flow of the game. This also allowed them to finish 30-1-3 in games they led after two periods. \nBut this year, they’ve lost that identity. It’s hard to know, in fact, what their identity is meant to be. \nDesjardins’ fear of using youngsters Jake Virtanen, Jared McCann and Sven Baertschi makes them, essentially, a three-line team but the three kids plus Bo Horvat and Ben Hutton give the Canucks a youthful aspect. \nDoes that make them a young team? Not when you’re afraid to play the kids. That leaves the veteran core but you can’t really call them an old team, either. \nAll this means they’re caught in between and that’s a dangerous place to be. Who are we? What do we do best? That uncertainty, moreover, tends to show up in the third period when the game is on the line and that’s even more dangerous. \nThe Canucks have to decide who they are and be that thing. The faithful can live with a younger team this season. They can tolerate an older team if it’s successful. But the Canucks can’t be a little of both. \n— One other thing about the Canucks. It’s become clear the Sedins’ lack of foot speed make them a liability in the chaos of overtime and three-on-three hockey. The Canucks have now been involved in four overtimes, the Sedins have yet to produce a goal and the Canucks’ only win in extra time came in a shootout. \nThere are other options. The kids, for example, might not be a bad place to look. \n— The emergence of quarterback Jonathon Jennings is significant on about 49 different levels for the Lions, and the most interesting might be its impact on the sale of the team. \nDavid Braley is looking at a significant price for the Leos. The issue is the $40-million number that has been kicked around Lions circles was hopelessly optimistic; at least it was pre-Jennings. \nBut there’s a different look and a different feel to this team right now. Jennings, a 23-year-old rookie who has the look of a franchise quarterback, makes the Lions a more attractive investment. Maybe it’s not $40 million worth but he does change things. \nBraley, meanwhile, has indicated he isn’t in a hurry to sell the team. There’s also some suggestion GM Wally Buono will be offered an extension before his contract expires at the end of the 2016 season. Throw in the intrigue over Andrew Harris’s future and the least you can say is these Lions are the most interesting 6-10 team in franchise history.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:36:50.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
