It is a good win; we could have won by a bigger margin. But I am satisfied and I try to look at the positives.” \nThe commanding win helped Oman go on top of Group D with 11 points from five games, while otherwise higher-rated Iran is in second place with eight points from four games. \nTurkmenistan's 1-0 win over Guam on Tuesday moved it up to third place with seven points - same as Guam - which trails on goal-difference and takes fourth place. Tuesday was India's fifth defeat in as many matches and it is firmly rooted to the bottom. \n“The win confirmed a good week for Oman as we surprised everyone with the draw against Iran and now this win, which has given us three points,” Le Guen said. \n“We deserved to win as we created many chances, though it was frustrating not to score in the first half. We should have been more efficient in front of the goal,” the Frenchman said. \nThe Omani coach said he was not worried with the goalless scoreline at the interval, adding, “I told my boys that the goal will come, so just be patient. Once we scored the first goal, I knew we could score more. It was a good display by our defence line as I was worried about counter-attacks, but we held firm. Abdulaziz [al Miqbali] was in good form, he had an assist and two goals.” \nLooking ahead, Le Guen said that Oman will play a friendly game at home on November 11 or 12 before travelling to Turkmenistan for the next World Cup qualifier, in Ashgabat on November 17. \nThe Omani coach also lauded Indian goalie Gurpreet Singh Sandhu for making ‘three-four brilliant saves’. \nAmour ruled out Oman defender Abdulsalam Amour has been ruled out of the qualifier at Turkmenistan after receiving a yellow card in the 40th minute against India, making it a second booking and leading to his suspension. \nLe Guen said, “It's a blow to the team as he is a key member of our defence.” Similar content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:53:25.527+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
