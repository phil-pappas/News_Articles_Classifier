Maybe 80,000 of the 110,000 fans remained in their seats. The other 30,000 were already out in the parking lots, celebrating a win that was quick and dirty, like a blindside punch. Those that stayed wanted to see this thing through the end. \nThe Wolverines were going for their third straight shutout and, for all involved, this was a big deal. The program hadn't done so since 1980. The current players were born in the mid-90s. \nHere came the crescendo: For the final plays — a few mostly meaningless snaps in Northwestern territory — the crowd thundered. \"De-Fence.\" \"De-Fence.\" \"De-Fence.\" It wasn't quite the notes of Ravel's \"Bolero\" soaring through the afternoon air, but the chills were still there. \nJabrill Peppers waved his arms up and down. He wanted more. He got more. \nThe noise built and the Wolverines responded, as they did all day. For the current Michigan defense — the one that hasn't been scored on since mid-September — a certain temperament of invincibility is developing. This is a group that means it when it says, as Peppers did after the Wolverines' 38-0 win, \"We don't want to give them anything. If a shutout is a byproduct of that, so be it.\" \nAnd nothing means nothing. \nNorthwestern came to Ann Arbor on Saturday as one of the best rushing teams in the country, averaging 248.8 yards per game. The Wildcats run it run it until opponents wear down, holes open up and points are scored. The method took them all the way to a No. 13 ranking. \nMichigan wasn't having any of that. It gave Northwestern 38 yards on 25 carries. \nThat's a 1.5-yard-per-carry average — less than one-third of the Wildcats' 4.4-yard-per-carry season average.

Quinn discuss Michigan's 38-0 win over Northwestern on Oct. 10, 2015. The passing was no better than the running. Michigan limited Northwestern to 15 completions for 130 yards. For the third straight week, an opposing quarterback was pulled. Wildcats quarterback Clayton Thorson completed just 13 of his 27 attempts before calling it a day. He might now see the likes of Jourdan Lewis in his dreams at night. \n\"Best corner in the country,\" Peppers said of Lewis, who intercepted a ball for the second straight week, snatching this one out of the hands of a receiver, and returned it for a 27-yard touchdown. \n\"That makes everybody's job a lot easier,\" Peppers continued. \"When you've got a guy who can shut down half the field, that makes our jobs easier. It's expected from him. It's not like, 'Oh, good job.'\" \nNo Michigan player could precisely relate or explain the attitude that's now swirling around this defense, but perhaps that's resolutely it — they're so good because they don't feel good about themselves. \nDefensive end Willie Henry doubled his season sack total by nothing two on Saturday. Shaking his head after the game, brow down, he told reporters that he still sees some \"slip\" on the defense. \n\"We're going to get that corrected,\" he added. \nThis is a defense that has allowed 378 yards in the last three games combined. \nThis is a defense that hasn't allowed one point in 12 quarters. \nThis is, as of now, the best defense in the country. \nWhatever.

It's just up to us to execute it. We have a lot of talented guys that take pride in what they do.\"\nThat pride is residual. The offense has to reach for a bar set absurdly high, as do the special teams. The runoff showed Saturday with U-M scoring at least one touchdown on offense, defense and special teams in the same game for the first time since 2003. \nIt began with Jehu Chesson shooting himself out of a canon on the opening kickoff of the day, going 96 yards untouched. \nIt ended with the crowd on its feet chanting for a few more stops. \nOf course, the stops were made more roars followed. Michigan stuffed Northwestern in a phone booth to start the day and had zero interest in letting it out. A few weeks ago the Wolverines allowed Oregon State to score a late, useless touchdown to break up a shutout. That hasn't happened since. \nIn fact, nothing has happened since. Zero points. \nHenry credits a dedication to technique, studying opponents' tendencies and, most importantly, execution. That's the ultimate difference. While new defensive coordinator D.J. Durkin is executing what Jim Harbaugh calls \"near flawless\" gameplans, nothing would matter without players making plays. \n\"It's all up to us,\" Henry said. \"We go out there and play on Saturdays, so it's not always up to the coaches. Maybe (early in the year) the players came together and said we're going to play harder and this is the year when people don't expect much out of us, we've got a new coach and a lot of hype coming around him. \n\"But coach Harbaugh is not the one out there playing. We are. So we've got to step up as a unit.\" \nOr as Peppers put it: \"This is what we expect to do.\" \nNext week it will be Michigan State. \nCue up Strauss's \"Hero's Battlefield.\" \nBrendan F.
