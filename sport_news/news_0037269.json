Ahead of the crucial Big Ten showdown, some Michigan fans decided to make the trip to East Lansing and paint the town maize and blue.\nEmphasis on the maize.\nThe Wolverines fan(s) took spray paint to the Earvin \"Magic\" Johnson statue outside of the Breslin Center. Not happy with the disrespectful act, Alvin Ellis III of the Spartans basketball team tweeted out a picture of the vandalized statue.\nNot only did the Michigan fans go after the statue, but they also left their mark elsewhere on campus:\n@MikeWilson247 I agree. Here's a picture as well pic.twitter.com/ewqEkJBOc4\n— Ryan Cole (@ryan_cole9) October 15, 2015 It's probably not the best idea to anger a rival that has owned the series in recent years. This \"prank\" will undoubtedly fire up the Spartans a little more than they already were—and that could be bad news for the Wolverines.\nIn case you missed it, this is just the latest act of vandalism toward a statue. Last week, TCU fans defaced Baylor's Robert Griffin III statue with purple spray paint.\n[Twitter, h/t College Spun ]\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://t.co/ewqEkJBOc4", "https://twitter.com/ryan_cole9/status/654667185697087488", "http://bleacherreport.com/", "http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2577396-tcu-fans-take-purple-spray-paint-to-baylors-robert-griffin-iii-statue", "https://twitter.com/MikeWilson247", "http://collegespun.com/big-ten/michigan-state-big-ten/photo-michigan-fans-vandalized-msus-magic-johnson-statue", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:06:51.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
