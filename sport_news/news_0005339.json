Even still, the Vols kept up with the Wranglers going into the third quarter. A 56-yard rushing touchdown from Nathan Cottrell brought the Vols within 2 points.Their rush defense had no answer for the Wickenburg backfield, however. The Wranglers put up 441 yards on the ground and scored 6 rushing touchdowns, four of them coming in the second half.\"They were just a lot like Mohave,\" said coach Ray Smith. \"The bottom line is, we were in the right places. They were more physical than us.\"Cottrell had a good day, rushing for 145 yards and three touchdowns. Quarterback Daniel Mazon completed 9-of-16 passes for 91 yards, half of those coming from a 45-yard pass to Eric Peppiatt.The Vols made some halftime adjustments on offense, and scored a touchdown in the third quarter and two more late in the fourth. It wasn't enough to negate the Wickenburg run game, though.\"We ran the ball good. We could score,\" said Smith. \"The kids are playing hard. We just got to get physical.\"Smith played some younger kids against the Wranglers, especially on defense. Sophomore Michael Thomas, who has been starting in the secondary for the past two games, had 3.5 tackles for the day. Veteran defensive tackle Juan Lopez and sophomore linebacker Edmond Ashton led the team with tackles, with 5 and 4.5 respectively.The Volunteers wrap up their season when they host Parker (3-6) this upcoming Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:58:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T02:17:06.417+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
