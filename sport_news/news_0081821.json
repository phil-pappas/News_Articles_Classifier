United entered Sunday's penultimate game of the season against the Chicago Fire knowing that a win would keep them in contention for 2nd place in the East and a 1st round bye in the playoffs. Having snapped a 6 game winless streak, with a victory against New York City FC in their last game, and an away game against 3rd place Columbus Crew remaining, victory was a necessity. \nThat said, the first 30 minutes showed no real difference between the DC United, and the side sitting firmly at the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings. With United's Bill Hamid making several saves up high... \n...and down low, to thwart the Fire attackers... \n...who were pushing forward at every opportunity \nBut Hamid and the United defense held firm \n...giving no quarter \nUnited were also pushing forward, but seemed unable to get that final ball into the box. \nA series of corners proved no real threat to the Chicago goal \nFinally, in the 39th minute Chris Pontius slotted the ball in from a tight angle to give United the lead. \nChicago attempted to get back into the game before the break, but were still unable to get through United's defense \nAs the second half began, it seemed clear that the thought was not \"when\" would United add to their score, but by how much with Chicago's keeper, Jon Busch, called into action time and time again. \nIn the 67th minute, a Fabian Espindola corner met the head of Bobby Boswell, who planted the ball perfectly in the far netting \n4 minutes later, Espindola, himself, was on the scoreboard, and United had a 3 goal lead \n...rather than celebrating, Espindola immediately ran towards the ball boy to restart play as soon as possible, perhaps sensing that Chicago were broken, and there was an opportunity for this to turn into a rout \nThere was only one more goal though, with United substitute Alvaro Saborio netting the final goal of the game in the 80th minute \n...to put United in pole position for that first round playoff bye, and leaving battered and bruised, ready for their season to end. \nFollow Simon Heseltine on Twitter: www.twitter.com/simonheseltine More:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:49:29.961+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
