Print this article Advertisement NAMPA, Idaho — Northwest Nazarene and Oregon Tech were clearly the class of the field here Tuesday as the College of Idaho Invitational golf tournament concluded a three-day run at the Ridgefield Golf Club. But Walla Walla Community College’s Lauri Malinen managed to at least crash the party. Malinen, a freshman from Helsinki, Finland, shot a final-round, 2-under-par 70 to finish third in the field of 69 players at 3-under-par 213 after three trips around the 6,928-yard layout. He finished six shots behind the winner, Keynan Fanslow of NNU, and five shot behind runner-up Jack Strickland, also of the Crusaders. Fanslow shot a 1-under 71 Tuesday, his third consecutive round in red numbers, to win the tournament at 9-under-par 207. Stickland’s final-round 68, which equaled the best score of the day, left him one shot behind Fanslow at 8-under 208. Jacob Berg of Warner Pacific also shot 68 Tuesday, but two previous rounds in the high 70s left him in a tie for 17th place at 225. Fanslow and Strickland carried their team to a first-place finish with an 849 tally for their top four scores over 54 holes of play. Oregon Tech finished a close second at 851, just two shots behind the winners. And WWCC claimed third place in the field of 12 schools, albeit 47 shots off the pace at 896. Other than Malinen, players from NNC and Oregon Tech filled out the top 10 positions in the individual standings. Oregon Tech’s Tyler Swinton finished just one shot behind Malinen in fourth place at 214 after a final-round 73. Two more Owls, Montana Frame and Houston Knox, tied for fifth place at 215. NNU players Michael Delie and Justin Higgins along with David Murphy and Josh Whitley of Oregon Tech were in a four-player knot for seventh place at 217 to round out the top 10 players in the field. “Lauri played great this week,” Warriors coach Mike Rostollan said of his prize freshman. “Each of his rounds was lower than the previous one. Any coaches loves that kind of scoring.” Malinen began the tournament Sunday with an even-par 72 and followed up Monday with a 1-under 71. Daniel Dolin of WWCC turned in a second straight 2-over-par 74 and finished in a three-way tie for 14th place at 8-over 224. Tucker Keyes of Walla Walla also shot 74 Tuesday and finished in a three-way tie for 20th place at 226. Garrett Newswick turned in WWCC’s fourth counting score Tuesday, a 78 that gave him a share of 39th place at 233. Dillon George and Zac Adams shot non-counting 80s, with George finishing in a tie for 41st place at 234 and Adams in a tie for 55th place at 246. “My four counters came through again today with some solid scores that moved them up the leaderboard,” Rostollan said. “I’m really proud of a third-place finish in the company of colleges in this field. Northwest Nazarene and Oregon Tech were just too deep for us, but we were the best of the rest.” Walla Walla University was also entered in the tournament and finished in 12th place at 977. Brendan Collins led the Wolves with a final-round 76 that gave him a share of 27th place at 229 for 54 holes. Cameron Cuenco shot 81 and earned a share of 52nd place at 241. And Jarrett Johnson and Cameron Fitzgerlad matched 83s and finished 60th and 61st, respectively, with scores of 256 and 257. Cole Henderson of WWU shot a non-counting 91 Tuesday and finished in 62nd place at 259. WWCC was unable to field a full women’s team here. Lauren Victorino led the Warriors with a 24th-place finish in a field of 35, with Mansa Jimenez placing 28th and Korbie Jenks 30th. Jimenez shot 94 Tuesday for a 185 score over 36 holes, Jimenez scored 94 and finished at 199, and Jenks shot 107 for a 204 total. “Marisa, Lauren and Korbie are still getting used to college golf, and their scores don’t always reflect the terrific shots they can shoot during a round,” Rostollan said of his three women. “Some of the simple things can be straightened out, like aim and alignment, and a few strokes can be saved. A couple of other tournament fundamentals will also help.” Kyla Clancy of Rocky Mountain College in Billings, Mont., was the women’s champion with a 150 score after a closing-round 76. Natalie Mullins of host College of Idaho finished second, three shots back at 153 following a second-round 78. College of Idaho did take the women’s team championship with a 640 score, four strokes in front of Oregon Tech. Five schools entered full women’s squads. Next up for the Warriors will be the Fall NWAC Tournament that will be played Nov. 1-2 at the Wine Valley Golf Club.
