That one game on the schedule everyone looks forward to seeing. Sadly because of scheduling problems and the New York State tournament format, many of these old time rivalry games are disappearing. Caledonia/Mumford versus LeRoy might be the next to go. But Friday night in Penn Yan, the Mustangs and Panthers squared off once again in one of those games. For those around who can remember, the Penn Yan - Geneva game was always the last regular season game of the year and usually was played around Veteran's Day each year. The Johnson - Costello American Legion Post 355 sponsored the game, and there was a trophy awarded to the winning team each year. This was before the Section V tournament and State Tournament was played. So this game was the tournament game for the teams. There was much excitement generated in both towns for this game. And they were always hard fought and exciting. In 2015, this is just another game on the schedule. But for what it is worth, Geneva and Penn Yan renewed this rivalry before a nice crowd at Mustang Field and another chapter was written. Unfortunately for the hometown Mustangs, the Panthers would come out on the celebrating end. Geneva defeated Penn Yan 29-18. The Mustang offense came into this contest averaging 38 points per game, but it would be the Mustang's offense that would let them down. The Geneva defense had an answer for most of the Penn Yan scoring attempts and stopped them twice inside the 5 yard line to thwart scoring drives. These failed attempts would come back and haunt the Mustangs later in the game. Geneva received the opening kickoff and immediately scored to grab a 6-0 lead. But Penn Yan's talented kickoff specialist Sean Emerson answered on the ensuing kickoff. He galloped 86 yards to score and knot the game at 6. On the next series for Geneva, they coughed the ball up in their own end zone for a safety and the hometown Mustangs led the game 8-6. But the Geneva offense once again responded on a 3 yard touchdown pass and the first quarter ended with the Panthers leading 14-8. In the second quarter, Penn Yan scored their only offensive-driven touchdown of the game. Tanner Irwin ran the ball in from 3 yards out. With 9 minutes left in the half, the score was tied at 14. The Mustangs threatened on their next possession, but were stopped at the Geneva 2 yard line. But Geneva once again fumbled in their end zone for the game's second safety, and Penn Yan jumped out to a 16-14 lead as the first half came to an end. The teams exchanged possessions in the third quarter with neither team denting the goal line. The final 12 minute stanza began with the score remaining 16-14 in favor of the Mustangs. Page 2 of 2 - As the final quarter began, Penn Yan's Jesse Baily forced another Geneva fumble on a punt and the Mustangs appeared to be in business on the Geneva 7 yard line. But in a game deciding goal line stand, Geneva stopped Penn Yan from scoring. The Penn Yan defense stonewalled the Panthers with Chevy Gordon and Cadin Lloyd stepping up with big plays. Remarkably, the Panthers fumbled for a third time for another safety. Penn Yan's lead expanded to 18-14 with 3 minute left in the contest. But in lightning-like fashion, Geneva dominated the final 180 seconds scoring twice and defensively shutting the Mustangs down totally. The game ended with the Panthers celebrating a 29-18 win. And the stunned Mustangs and their hopeful fans lamenting their second straight loss. Time certainly flies in the quick moving high school football season. The regular season schedule comes to an end next Friday night. The Mustangs will travel to East Rochester to take on the undefeated Bombers from East Rochester/Gananda. They will hope to right their gridiron ship in this contest with critical sectional points and tournament seeding on the line. It will be a tough task against a very talented opponent. Who knows, maybe it will the start of another gridiron rivalry. Dundee 21 Marcus Whitman 6 The Dundee Scot football team traveled to Rushville on Friday evening to take on the hometown Wildcats in a Finger Lakes West contest. The Scotsmen scored three time in the first three quarters to build up a 21-0 lead. Whitman scored late but it would not be enough. Dundee coasted to a 21-6 win to even their league record at 3 wins and 3 losses. They will host Midlakes next Saturday in the regular season finale. this will be a huge game for the Scotsmen with a sectional game on the line. There was no further scoring information on this game available. Further details will follow.
