Senior won 44-14. The Broncs play Billings Skyview Friday at Wendy's Field at Daylis Stadium at 7 p.m. If the Broncs win, they will claim the Daylis Bowl as city champion. \nFriday Night Lights Friday \nGreat Falls (2-6) at Billings West (5-3), 4 p.m., Wendy's Field at Daylis Stadium \nIt’s homecoming for West. The Bears have won five straight. “We’ve won five in a row and are playing pretty well as a team,” first-year West coach Rob Stanton said. “As a coach, you are looking for perfection and can nitpick. But when you can put wins up, that is what we are trying to do.” \nBillings Senior (7-1) vs. Billings Skyview (1-7), 7 p.m., Wendy's Field at Daylis Stadium \nIf the Broncs win, they will lock up the city championship, which has been held by the Falcons the past three years. The Daylis Bowl, given in years when there is a clear-cut city champ, is made out of wood from the old student section east bleachers. The inaugural Daylis Bowl was presented to West in 2005. Floyd Creekmore created the bowl after the old grandstand was demolished in the spring before the 2005 season. Saturday \nLaurel (5-2, 2-2) at Billings Central (5-2, 3-1), 7 p.m., Wendy's Field at Daylis Stadium \nIf Billings Central wins, it will clinch the second playoff spot out of the Eastern A. A Laurel win could force a three-way tie for second place in the division if Sidney also wins.
