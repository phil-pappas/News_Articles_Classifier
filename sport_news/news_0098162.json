It was for the Taft junior varsity volleyball team Thursday evening in a 25-21, 21-25, 14-16 loss to the Arvin Bears in Arvin. “It was a much better game this time than last time,” said Taft coach Suzanne White. “This time we took a game off them.” With the loss, Taft falls to 10-10-2 overall and 4-3 in the South Sequoia League. Taft had a little bit of momentum early in the first set after jumping out to a 4-2 lead highlighted by a pair of aces from Ali Moon. The Lady Wildcats regained the lead with three unanswered points to lead 7-4 but the Lady Bears countered by tying the score at seven. The teams tied each other one more time before Taft pulled ahead again with a 3-1 run. Arvin narrowed the lead down to two but Taft held on to the narrow lead until the Lady Bears tied the score at 17. The teams would knot the score two more times before Taft went on a 4-0 run to close out the first set. Taft carried their momentum into the second set with a 3-1 run including the opening two points of the set. Arvin countered with a 3-1 run to tie the score at four. After the teams tied at five, Arvin scored two points to take a 7-5 advantage. The Lady Bears would hold onto the small lead until Arvin went on a 6-0 run to lead 15-8. Thanks in part to Sierra Phillips’ tip, the Lady Wildcats countered with a 6-0 run to whittle the lead down to one at 15-14. Arvin regained the lead but the teams would tie three times. The Lady Bears finally broke through with a 6-2 run to win the second set. A seesaw battle broke out in the final set with Taft and Arvin tying each other five times. The Lady Bears attempted to pull away after the final tie with a 5-0 run but Taft closed the gap to 10-8 highlighted by Katie Brown’s ace. Arvin hung onto the small lead until Taft tied it at 12 on Alyssa Reeves’ ace. The Lady Bears regained the lead but Taft countered with two unanswered points and were one point away from winning at 14-13. However, Arvin scored the final three points to win the set and match. Brooklyn Yaws led in kills with 5 while Reece Hamilton had 4. Brown led in aces with 3 while Moon had 2. Roslyn Maino had a dig. Taft returns to action Tuesday when they host Cesar Chavez.
