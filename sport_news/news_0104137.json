That's so much motivation. For those that keep saying that, keep doubting me. I love it.\" \nHarris, a sophomore from Bossier City, Louisiana, won the starting job this summer and has, in the words of coach Les Miles, done \"exactly\" what LSU needed. For the most part, that has been managing an offense featuring running back Leonard Fournette and producing 325.5 yards rushing per game as a team. \nIn three of LSU's first four games, Harris passed for fewer than 100 yards. A game against heavy underdog Eastern Michigan may have been the low point, when Harris was victimized by a couple drops in or near the end zone and finished 4 of 15 for 80 yards. \nBut in each of LSU's recent victories over South Carolina and Florida, Harris eclipsed the 200-yard mark to raise his season average to 135.3 yards passing per game. This week, LSU hosts Western Kentucky, whose quarterback, Brad Doughty, averages 378.7 yards passing. \n\"You don't play football at risk of injury without playing with a little passion and caring about how you're received,\" Miles said this week when asked about Harris' inclination to engage his critics publicly. \"But he needs not to worry about that at all. \n\"The opinions that matter will all come from ... that big building that we practice in,\" Miles continued. \"Others don't know. ... So he needs to just do the things that he's been doing and not try to exceed the play call.\" \nHarris appeared to exceed one play call shortly before the first half last week, but it worked out. \nAfter being flushed from the pocket, Harris slipped a tackle while rolling right and launched a deep pass that Malachi Dupre hauled in for a 50-yard touchdown. \n\"He had a few guys he could have thrown the ball to,\" Dupre said after reviewing film of the third-down play. \"He was smart and realized that at the worst-case scenario, it could have been an interception, but it would have just been like a punt that they would have had to do anyway. So Brandon's just becoming a great quarterback and a leader.\" \nDupre said there have been times when he wanted to tell Harris to ignore the critics, but the receiver said he has also come to appreciate Harris' ability to handle criticism and make it work for him. \n\"He likes to step up to challenges and I feel like he keeps hearing a lot of noise outside of the team — people talking about how he can't throw the ball — just because we weren't throwing the ball as much the first couple games of the season and we didn't have that much success throwing the ball in the first couple games,\" Dupre said. \"I think that bothered him a lot and it just drives him more and more. \n\"I see how hard he works. He's only getting better,\" Dupre added. \"He made some really beautiful throws this weekend and I think he just wants to keep proving people wrong.\" \nWHAT'S AT STAKE \nLSU aims to remain unbeaten and firmly in contention for a College Football Playoff bid. Western Kentucky seeks what would be a program-defining victory over an unbeaten, top-10 team on the road. \nKEY MATCHUP \nLSU's pass rush, which has racked up 17 sacks through six games, against a prolific WKU passing attack that has produced 407.1 yards per game. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nWestern Kentucky: QB Brad Doughty, who passed for a nation's-best 4,830 yards and 49 TDs in 2014, has averaged 378.7 yards passing this season and already has passed for 24 TDs. \nLSU: RB Leonard Fournette continues to be among the top candidates for the Heisman Trophy, averaging 200.3 yards rushing after his 180 tough yards on the ground and two TDs against Florida. Fournette's rushing totals of 1,202 yards and 14 TDs are both tops in the country, even though he's played six games — one fewer than many of his peers because LSU had its opener canceled by lightning. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nWestern Kentucky is in its seventh season as a member of the NCAA's top-tier Football Bowl Subdivision. ... The Hilltoppers have gone 1-3 against ranked opponents since moving up to the FBS level. ... WKU has scored 308 points this season, about 11 points down from last year's record scoring pace. ... WKU's only loss this season came at Indiana by a score of 38-35. ... LSU is averaging 325.5 yards rushing this season. ... The Tigers have won 23 straight when rushing for 200 or more yards. ... The Tigers have not lost a nonconference home game since 2000 against UAB, winning the past 44 at home against non-SEC programs. ... LSU averages 135.3 yards per game passing, but QB Brandon Harris has demonstrated he can throw for long gains, including two passes for 50 or more yards to Malachi Dupre last week. \nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:51:34.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
