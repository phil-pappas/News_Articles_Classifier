The projectile's remains were located in the Eshkol Regional Council.\nThe rocket launching triggered rocket sirens morning in Israeli communities in the area, the IDF said. No injuries or damage were caused and no group has yet taken responsibility for the attack.\nOn Friday, prior to the attack, six Palestinians who were part of a large group of rioters that approached the Gaza border with Israel were shot and killed by IDF soldiers. A seventh Palestinian died Saturday from gunshot wounds sustained in the riot, Palestinian media reported\nSome 200 Palestinians approached the Gaza-Israel border fence from the Strip, burning tires and throwing rocks. They ignored calls by soldiers to stop, entering a 100-meter perimeter area that is a closed military zone, and getting to within 50 meters of the fence, an army spokeswoman said.\nThe demonstration was called in solidarity with Palestinians in the West Bank and Jerusalem and followed a spate of attacks by Palestinians against Israelis and reprisals by Jews against Arabs.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:40:23.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
