According to court records, Samual Ray Steele, 43, shoved Michael W. Elliot, 63, of Angels Camp to the ground the night of July 23, 2012, after leaving Claussen’s Corner bar. Elliot died July 28, 2012, at University of California, Davis, Medical Center from a head injury. Multiple people who were at the bar that night reported seeing Steele and Elliot arguing. The argument continued outside the bar, the records state, and ended just before midnight when Steele pushed Elliot, who fell and hit his head outside his South Main Street apartment. Both Steele and Elliot had been drinking alcohol, the records said. When Angels Camp Police Officer Jim McKeon arrived on scene shortly after midnight July 24, 2012, he was flagged down by multiple people who were trying to assist Elliot, the records state. Steele was one of those people. After further investigation, Steele was arrested Aug. 7, 2012. He originally pleaded not guilty in August 2012, but in November 2012, he changed his plea to no contest. Steele was sentenced Nov. 27, 2012, to 224 days in jail, but was placed on probation because of time served and good conduct, the records state. A motion filed by the Calaveras County Probation Department dated Sept. 11 states Steele violated the terms and conditions of his probation, which was scheduled to end Nov. 26. According to the probation department, Steele failed to show proof he completed a substance abuse treatment program. Records show he was removed from a Calaveras County substance abuse program Feb. 24, 2015. In the motion, the probation department recommends Steele’s probation be revoked and reinstated, and that he serve 100 days in jail. Additionally, the department recommends his probation be extended to Nov. 26, 2017. On Sept. 25, Steele failed to appear for his violation of probation arraignment. He was arrested on Oct. 1. Steele is being held in Calaveras County Jail on a no-bail hold.
