Siloam Springs (4-4, 1-4) must defeat Russellville in the season finale to have a chance at a playoff berth. \nGreenwood had 313 yards of offense in the first half and scored on its first four possessions. \n\"We were methodical, we didn't want to punt,\" Greenwood Coach Rick Jones said. \nGreenwood's defense forced a three-and-out on the Panthers' opening possession, and the Bulldogs answered with four consecutive touchdowns. \nLuke Hales scored on a 5-yard run on Greenwood's seventh play with 8:05 left in the first quarter. \nAfter another three-and-out, the Bulldogs went 63 yards in four plays with Jordan Green scoring on a 13-yard run with 5:43 left in the opening quarter. \nThe Panthers ran eight offensive plays on their next series before punting. \nGreenwood led 21-0 just eight seconds into the second quarter after Green's 10-yard touchdown run. \nAfter another three-and-out, Greenwood mounted a 10-play drive, converting two third downs before Hales scored from 2 yards out. \nGreenwood looked like it had its 35-point lead at halftime an 11-play drive, but Kenny Wood was ruled down just outside the end zone to end the second quarter. \n\"I was frustrated right before the half,\" Jones said. \"I thought we had it dialed up, and we just didn't get it done. We had some penalties and some things. We wanted to get the clock running in the second half.\" \nThe Bulldogs opened the second half with a nine-play scoring drive with Hales scoring on a 20-yard run with 10:20 left in the third quarter to enforce the Arkansas Activities Association's sportsmanship rule with a 35-0 lead. \n\"We knew what we needed to do,\" Jones said. \"This group of kids, and we haven't done anything yet, but so far I've been really pleased. They prepare well Monday through Thursday and then go out and play hard every time.\" \nCaden Martin capped a short four-play drive with a touchdown with 5:09 left in the third quarter. Jarrod Cooper added his sixth extra point to set the final score. \nGreenwood allowed just 25 yards in Siloam Springs' first 25 plays. The Bulldogs rushed for 281 yards and passed for 171. \nSports on 10/24/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:19:02.842+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
