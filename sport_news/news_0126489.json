Additionally, the pitchers left a few too many balls over the heart of the plate.\nSo they’re down 2-0 in the ALCS, as they head back to Toronto for Game 3, which is Monday evening at Rogers Centre.\nMORE: Best photos from Blue Jays-Royals ALCS | Five takeaways from Royals comeback win in Game 2\nThat’s not ideal, of course, but all hope isn’t lost. In fact, here are five reasons Jays fans can hold onto hope for the next couple of days.\n1. Tulowitzki showing life © Provided by Sporting News After coming off the DL, Toronto’s shortstop went hitless in four of the five games in the Blue Jays’ ALDS win against the Rangers, then went hitless in Game 1 of the ALCS. Two of those at-bats were with two outs and at least one runner on, but his outs ended the threats.\nThat effort dropped his postseason average to .080 (2-for-25) heading into Game 2. He broke out of that slump on Saturday with a pair of hits, including an RBI double in the sixth inning.\n“Good day for Tulo,” Toronto manager John Gibbons said. “He's been taking a little heat. He's such a good hitter. It's a matter of time. Big at-bats today, that really gets him going.”\n2. Home sweet home © Provided by Sporting News Let’s start with this: The Jays were 53-28 this year at home, compared to 40-41 on the road. This Blue Jays’ roster wasn’t put together to succeed in Kansas City’s bigger park where it’s harder to hit home runs.\nThis roster was designed to power the baseball over outfield fences, something they did very well at the Rogers Centre this season (123 homers in 81 games).\nLike Kauffman, though, the atmosphere is a huge advantage for the home team.\n“That place tends to get really loud, and their crowds can get rowdy,” Royals second baseman Ben Zobrist said. “I anticipate it being very loud, very hostile for us, as the visiting team.”\n3. Stroman’s up © Provided by Sporting News Toronto’s rising right-handed star gets the ball for Game 3 in Toronto. He missed most of the year with an ACL injury, but came back to post a 1.67 ERA in four regular-season starts and had a 3.46 ERA in two starts during the ALDS.\nThe team has confidence in him. Remember, he got the must-win Game 5 start against the Rangers and gave up just two runs in six innings.\n“We'll have Stromy going on Monday,” Gibbons said. “We feel good. It's a lot tougher from here. But we have a pretty good team, too.”\n4. Been there, done that © Provided by Sporting News The Blue Jays, as everyone remembers, were down 2-0 in their ALDS series against the Rangers and came back to win that one. The defending AL champion Royals are a better team than the Rangers, but there are reasons for Jays fans to avoid panic attacks.\nFor one thing, this is a best-of-seven series, so Toronto isn’t truly back-against-the-wall until the Royals win their third game of the ALCS. And at least this time, the Blue Jays get to head home facing a two-game series deficit. That wasn't the case last series.\n“We're at home,” Gibbons said. “That's where you've got to win. It won't be easy, no doubt about that. But we get one win out of the way, that can turn things in a hurry.”\n5. Bautista’s due © Provided by Sporting News At least, that’s how the thinking goes. Toronto’s premier slugger didn’t register a hit in Kansas City, though he did strike the ball hard a couple times and he still managed to get on base — he walked four times in the two games. So it’s not like he’s lost at the plate.\nAnd Bautista is the kind of powerful hitter who can change a game — and a series — with one swing of the bat, regardless how many trips to the plate it’s been between hits.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2015-10-17/mlb-playoffs-2015-five-takeaways-from-royals-comeback-win-in-game-2-of-alcs-blue-jays-david-price-stats", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658461-mlb-playoffs-2015-american-league-championship-series-photos-pictures-royals-blue-jays-alcs/slide/366680", "http://www.sportingnews.com/"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:49:30.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
