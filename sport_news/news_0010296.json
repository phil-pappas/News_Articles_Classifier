Minister of State for Culture and Tourism Mahesh Sharma was also ticked off over the phone for his uncharitable remarks on Dadri killing and writers’ protest that landed the party in an embarrassing situation. BJP functionaries say the Prime Minister is “livid” at party’s controversial “motormouths”. The leaders, however, denied having received any dressing down by Shah, sources said. A senior party functionary said the four leaders, including Uttar Pradesh MLA Sangeet Som, Union Minister Sanjeev Balyan and MP Sakshi Maharaj, were “reprimanded” by Shah, who warned them against making comments that “threaten to derail” the Modi government’s “development agenda” and provide “fodder” to anti-BJP elements to “defame” the party and the PM. “They were told in clear terms that their unwarranted remarks were shifting discourse from the Prime Minister’s agenda of development, employment generation and poverty reduction,” he said. The party source said the aim of the exercise was to send a warning across the board about consequences of statements that may shift the focus off the government’s key agenda and cause embarrassment to the PM and the party. “A message has been conveyed that everyone should desist from making statements that create unnecessary controversies. People prone to making controversial statements have been specifically conveyed the party’s unhappiness,” he said. Some of the remarks, especially those on beef ban, are believed to have harmed party’s prospects in the first two phases of the ongoing Bihar elections. Sources say the aim of the exercise is also to send a message in the state, which holds the key to BJP’s fortunes. While Opposition leaders such as RJD’s Lalu Prasad have been having a field day in Bihar elections, courtesy the controversial utterances, BJP’s key ally Akali Dal has also termed the Dadri lynching a “shame” for the country. “What happened after the lynching incident in UP is damaging the NDA, the BJP and damaging the PM more than anybody else,” SAD MP Naresh Gujral was Quote: d as saying. Meanwhile, as Congress dismissed Shah’s exercise as “mere gimmick” and “empty formality” after the “horse has bolted”, BJP leaders concerned termed their meeting with Shah a routine engagement. “I came to discuss regional issues and was not asked for any clarification,” said Sakshi Maharaj. “Every action has a reaction, I had taken action so there was a reaction,” he told mediapersons. Sangeet Som and Balyan also said they discussed party matters. After a Muslim man was lynched by a mob in Dadri over rumours of cow slaughter and beef consumption, Mahesh Sharma described the lynching as an \"accident\". Sangeet Som who visited Dadri claimed that “cow killers” were rescued by the Akhilesh Yadav government. While Khattar recently said Muslims here must give up beef, Sakshi Maharaj demanded a death penalty for cow slaughter. However, even as the party tried to rein in its leaders, RSS mouthpiece \"Panchjanya\" said: “The Vedas order killing of anyone who slaughters the cow. Cow slaughter is a big issue for the Hindu community.” What got them into soup \"Muslims can continue to live in this country, but they will have to give up eating beef\" Manohar Lal Khattar, Haryana CM \"I don’t want to link this issue with communalism. This is a social issue\" Sanjeev Balyan, Union minister \"Leaders need to change their mindset or get beaten up by the people in full public view\" Sakshi Maharaj, BJP MP \"Like Muzaffarnagar, they (UP Govt) have taken those who have slaughtered cow in a plane\" Sangeet Som, BJP MLA \"This should be considered an accident and should not be given a communal colour\" Mahesh Sharma, Union minister", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:00:24.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
