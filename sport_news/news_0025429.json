Fast or feast? Thrown in the nine days of celebrations are the obvious music, dance, family and friends. Worship, dance, celebrate, sing, restrain or release—Navratris bring out the true blue streak in each. A few celebs share a leaf from their festive memories. Dandiya in Barcelona\nSophie Choudry\nWhat I love about Navratri is the fact that it is such a joyous festival. It is all about music, dance, family and friends. It really brings people together in a special way! When I was in college and a popular TV host in London, I remember having been invited as chief guest for some Navratri events. I mean can you believe it, I played Dandiya not only in London, but in Paris, Barcelona and Andorra as well!” Colourful times,colourful memories\nJuhi Chawla\nEver since I was a kid living in Cuffe Parade, Navratri meant Dandiya in our building. We had these huge ramps in the parking spaces of the first floor, opened to the skies, where one or the other building would have a Dandiya session happening. And through those weeks my friends and I would all get together and go play Dandiya. We would all really look forward to that festive time to play Dandiya in our ghagras!...Coincidentally this year, I am going to Kolkata for the Durga Pooja, which is going to be very special for me as I have always heard about it but never seen it before. Celebrating the good old way Kunwar Amarjeet Singh\nNavratri is one of my most favourite festivals, as I have a deep connection with Maa Durga, whom I have immense faith in. I also just love the energy of this festival, which is so vibrant and colourful! I absolutely love playing Garba and Dandiya too. I am going back to my home in Indore this year to celebrate Navratri, where I will visit some pandals to play some fun traditional Garba. All about friends and family Shantanu Maheshwari\nI am from Kolkata and have grown up watching idols being made for Navratri. Navratri marks the start of a good festive season for me. The festival is all about spending time with my family and friends. I am more of a Dandiya person than Garba, as I simply enjoy playing Dandiya! I also love hopping from one pandal to another to take part in as many traditional Dandiya events as I can. The Punjabi way!\nShivangi Verma\nNavratri is about victory of positivity over negativity. I celebrate Navratri by worshipping our goddesses Durga, Lakshmi and Saraswati. I am a Punjabi and so for us Navratri is known as Navratras or Naratey, entailing us to fast for the first seven days. On the eighth day (Ashtami), we break our fast by calling young girls home who are treated as Goddesses. We wash their feet and offer them our traditional rice, halwa and chana along with a token amount of money as shagun. This ritual is called Kanjak. In the spirit of religion Manjari Fadnis\nDuring Navratri, we have an Akhand Jot at home, where we light a diya, which is lit constantly for all the nine days of the festival. We also do a Navratri pooja every morning and evening at home for all the nine days. I also really enjoy playing Dandiya with friends and family during the season. And of course gorge on my mom's home-made besan ke ladoo, which she makes yearly during Navratri as prasad. Fasting & feasting\nManasi Parekh Gohil\nEvery year during Navratri, attending at least one or two of Dandiya and Garba events is mandatory for me. If I have time, I try to travel along with my husband Parthiv to his shows in Gujarat. This year, we plan to deck up our beautiful devi which I got from an ashram in Coimbatore last year. We sing hymns and chant for her. Parthiv will also be fasting. Tattoos, trends & more\nDalljiet Kaur\nI have lovely memories of Navratri. During my last show, Iss Pyaar Ko Kya Naam Doon, I went to Gujarat and saw the best Navratri of my life. People were dressed so beautifully and I actually ended up getting some fashion tips from them. Few girls had shown me some trendy tattoos, which I was amazed to see. I still recall that trip and hope that every Navratri I get a chance to visit Navratri pandals. Not that I am a great dancer, but Garba is something that brings out the dancer in everyone. I will take my son out this year and show him the colourful festival of Navratri. manpriya@tribunemail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:22:41.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
