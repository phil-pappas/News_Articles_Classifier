File photo Related article » LOS ANGELES – So, a new guy will be writing out the Dodgers’ lineup every game next season – or will he?\nAs Don Mattingly found out this past season, game-day decisions are no longer the sole province of the manager. Data-based, analytically-minded front offices – and the Dodgers are at the forefront of that movement since the hiring of Andrew Friedman a year ago – expect to have significant input into lineup construction, defensive positioning (i.e. shifts) and bullpen usage.\n“I think it’s great. I love it,” Mattingly maintained even as he left the Dodgers this week. “I love the information. I love the analysis of players. I think it’s great, honestly. I really think the information is really good.\n“Am I one thousand percent with everything that comes through it? Probably not. But I love the information and how do we analyze players. The analytics are nothing but great information for me.”\nBut did the constant input and expectation that the information would be implemented take away his autonomy as manager?\n“I just look at it as collaboration and us working together,” Mattingly said. “That relationship (with the front office) was not strained in any way. I feel like I’ve always been a guy who works with anyone.� Information is good. Discussion is good. Debating things back and forth is good. At the end of the day, you put your lineup out there.”\nGM Farhan Zaidi went so far as to say “the model of how we worked with Donnie will be a good model for us going forward” when a new manager is hired.\nThat model included constant “back and forth,” Friedman acknowledged.\n“Sometimes he (Mattingly) would text me, ‘Hey, thinking this. Any thoughts?’ Because we had a fresher perspective,” Friedman said. “Just like in the winter we would talk to him and say, ‘Hey, we’re considering this trade. What do you think?’ because he was part of the management team of this organization.”\nBut the perception that Mattingly was told who to play and how to construct the lineup on a daily basis was “just not true,” Friedman said.\n“It’s not ‘Hey, here’s your lineup. Go put it up,’” Friedman said. “There’s healthy conversations that go back and forth every day. Sometimes he would text us. Just like my relationship with Joe Maddon and I’m assuming Farhan’s relationship with Bob Melvin. That thought partner back and forth to debate things. That’s healthy. That’s good.”", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwp20b-friedmanmattingly.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/nwp20b-friedmanmattingly.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:23:32.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
