Now there is an exception to Rule 6-6d that says a player will not be disqualified for an incorrect scorecard if he was not aware of the rules violation when he signed the card. \nThe rules are updated every four years by the Royal & Ancient Golf and the U.S. Golf Association. \nThe biggest change, previously announced, was banning the anchored stroke used primarily for long putters.
