Dwayne Williams was covering, so there's obviously a pretty significant height difference there, but Williams had great position and Villamin showed great timing, awareness and hands to grab the ball out of the air.\nThree observations (and a bonus)\n1. Have to start with a quarterback update, right? The media was able to watch a bit of scout team work, where Mitchell and Collins split reps, and a team period, where Mitchell was the only quarterback to take snaps on a possession that began around the OSU 25-yard line.\nBy my count, Mitchell went 5-of-13 (every play was a pass) but converted two key fourth downs to keep the drive moving and also got the Beavers going up-tempo on a couple different occasions. On the final play of the workout, a red-zone pass over the middle got to Victor Bolden but was nicely knocked away by linebacker Bright Ugwoegbu.\nFollowing practice, Mitchell also pulled true freshman tight end Noah Togiai aside to work on routes on their own.\nHere's Andersen on the quarterback situation entering Saturday night's game against Colorado:\n\"The great thing is when a young man (Mitchell) — especially with a very young football team — has proved himself to practice well enough to get into a game situation and see how he can react and how he is going to play, and then the opportunity presents itself, we'll play him,\" Andersen said. \"And if that's at the quarterback spot this week, then so be it in certain situations.\n\"Seth's gonna start the game, and we'll see how it goes as we move forward throughout the game.\"\n2. Devin Chappell, who had been running with the second team at safety for the majority of the week, was back working with the first unit on Thursday.\n3. There was a brief scuffle that interrupted the Beavers' final drive. Offensive lineman Fred Lauina was in the middle of it and got pulled, and the entire ordeal was squashed after a few seconds.\n4. Uniform update: Many Beavers were working out in their flat black helmets.\nQuotable\n\"I couldn't tell you what made them tackle better. They were in better positions, from A to Z. When you sit back and you look at the defense and what we were doing, you are going to have young men make plays on you in this league. There were some great balls that were thrown and there were contested balls and (Washington State) made plays on them. We were able to make some plays on some balls that were in the air in the second half. We were able to drop underneath some coverages and confuse the quarterback a little bit and force him to make some bad throws.\" -- Andersen on what changed defensively in the second half against Washington State\nComing up\nI will have more on Gary Crowton joining the Beavers as an offensive consultant, as well as some midseason superlatives.\n-- Gina Mizell | @ginamizell", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ginamizell"], "published": "2015-10-22T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:12:23.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
