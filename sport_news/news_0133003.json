Physically and mentally the game became more difficult for Watford as well and we took advantage of that.\" \nSanchez started the scoring in the 62nd minute when Mesut Ozil was tackled in the penalty area, only for the ball to roll onto the Chilean's feet for him to lift over Heurehlo Gomes and into the net off the post. It was his 10th goal in his last six games at club and international level with Chile. \nSix minutes later, substitute Olivier Giroud fired a cut-back from Ozil into the roof of the net, before Ramsey netted his first club goal of the season, following a neat pass from Hector Bellerin. His effort deflected into the net off of Ikechi Anya. \nThe Wales international said Arsenal had to be patient to overcome Watford, which lost its momentum once Arsenal went ahead. \n\"It was difficult, in the first half they pressed us really well,\" Ramsey said. \"We stuck with the game plan and thankfully our quality showed.\" \nWatford stayed on 10 points, six points above the relegation zone and 14th in the standings. \n\"I think for one hour, we play really well,\" Flores said. \"We have our chances in the first half but the first goal, when we are playing very well in the second half, is a very hard kick for the team and we are down for the next 10 minutes.\" \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:03:13.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
