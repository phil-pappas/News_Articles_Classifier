Member Comments # 1 tsbmolina @ 10/09/15 02:30 PM Kat Bailey, US Gamer does not know what she is talking about. Livin Da Dream amd MyGm mode is great and her review and reasoning for scoring NBA 2K16 as low as she did is laughable. NBA 2k16's MyGm mode feels sterile, really Miss Kat Bailey? She harped on the story mode more then the actual gameplay. I will take her US Gamer review with a grain of salt. Kat makes the podcasts hard to listen to.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:51:21.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
