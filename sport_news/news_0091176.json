Next up Milford By Dave Frederick | Oct 22, 2015 Photo by: Dave Frederick Sydney Ostroski scores at 21:55 of the first half in what proved to be the only goal of the game. Sydney Ostroski is a field hockey forward who strikes suddenly. It’s what she does. Last Thursday night, October 22,at Champions Stadium Sydney tipped a hard shot from Tess Bernheimer into the goal cage midway through the first half giving Cape a 1 to 0 led. And that’s how it ended as the Vikings controlled field position and and shots on goal throughout the contest. Cape outshot the Panthers 9-2 with a 10-1 advantage in penalty corners Goalie Riley Shields had a huge first half save off a cannon shot from the Panthers Jamie Trabaudo. Cape got a great defensive game in the middle of the field from sophomore Annie Judge. Cape is now 12&0 with three away games left at Milford, Woodbridge and Delmar. The Panthers drop to 9 & 2. \nDelmar is 12-0-1 and host Cape on November 3 the last game of the regular season. \n\"We practice hard and prepare hard and have fun doing it,\" said Coach Kate Austin after the game. \"No one is this program is talking about streaks or records over a bunch of years. We are trying to win a championship this year just like lots of other teams.\" Jody Boyer moves the ball upfield (Photo by: Dave Frederick ) Cape surrounds goalie Riley Shields to celebrate the victory (Photo by: Dave Frederick )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T05:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:07:03.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
