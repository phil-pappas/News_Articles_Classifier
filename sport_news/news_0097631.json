(AP) - New York Jets running back Stevan Ridley has practiced for the first time this season and could face the New England Patriots, his former teammates. \nRidley is currently on the physically unable to perform list after tearing the anterior cruciate and medial collateral ligaments in his right knee while with the Patriots last season. \nCoach Todd Bowles says Wednesday that there’s “a chance” Ridley could play Sunday. Ridley was a full participant at practice, but Bowles wants to see how he feels as the week progresses. \nCornerback Dee Milliner, on short-term injured reserve, also fully participated but must miss two more games before he can be activated. \nCornerback Buster Skrine (concussion), safety Jaiquawn Jarrett (knee) and running back Bilal Powell (ankle) all sat out. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:52:11.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
