For Celtics, it's just a business trip Comment Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 1:55 PM By SCOTT SOUZA@scott_souza Posted Oct. 2, 2015 at 1:55 PM WALTHAM, Mass. – Celtics coach Brad Stevens has said he has been working through different lineups and rotations in his head for the past two months. That he has a few specific ones in mind heading into the first two preseason games in Europe over the next week is news to his players based on their training-camp experience. “Every single day we’ve been switching it up in practice and really balancing the team,” newly acquired forward David Lee said. “That’s been a huge plus for me. I’ve gotten a chance to play alongside a different big every single day, play some [power forward] and [center], and play with a different point guard every day. “It’s been great rather than have me play with the same guys, then I get in the game and I am out there with someone else where I have no idea what their strengths and weaknesses are.” Stevens will have to put five guys out there together to start the preseason opener in Milan on Tuesday afternoon, and come up with a rotation that may leave a notable name or two on the bench. But the coach cautions about jumping to conclusions about what that will foreshadow for opening night against Philadelphia on Oct. 28. “We’re going to treat this entire next couple of weeks like a practice – including the game days,” Stevens said prior to the final workout Friday afternoon before heading for Italy. “I think it’s very likely that we will start different lineups in each game overseas. We can certainly discuss it and talk about it. But I don’t think anything will be set in stone. I think you want to have it set by the time we start our last week of the preseason.” That said, when the coach was asked how “set” the lineups and rotations are in his mind, he responded: “I’ve got a pretty good idea.” After facing Olimpia Milano on Tuesday, the Celtics will head to Spain for a matchup with Real Madrid on Thursday. Beyond reading the lineup tea leaves, the two-game swing through Europe will provide the players a chance to see how they stack up against competition other than themselves, while also spending some quality time with each other without the distractions of home. “We’re trying to win those games, and at the same time, come together as a team,” Isaiah Thomas said. “Going on a trip like this, everybody here is all we’ve got out there. We don’t really know too much out there. We are going out there as one, and that’s going to help us.” Page 2 of 2 - Thomas and Jae Crowder have talked about how this training camp has already been very helpful after arriving in Boston in midseason trades last year. For Lee and free-agent acquisition Amir Johnson, as well as the rookies, the European preseason games will be even bigger in finding out how they mesh with the returnees in their first chances to take the court against an unfamiliar foe. “From scrimmages we’ve had in practice I can kind of see where I am going to fit in – at least offensively and defensively with what we’re doing,” Lee said. “I think there is a lot of potential for some great things to happen. It’s just continuing the day-by-day buildup of what we’ve already put in. “Coach can give us a blueprint on what he wants to have happen on the court. It’s up to the players to take that and run with it. It’s about making everybody a threat and playing to everybody’s strengths on the court.” Stevens said he is not looking for the best five players to start a game, or even finish a game, but the best combinations of five players to do both. Thus, there is the continuous juggling of those combinations in practice to find the few that he will go with when the games start for real at the end of the month. “They understand this is about us, this is about our growth, and that they’ll get their opportunities whether they are in the rotation to start or not,” Stevens said. “[Olimpia Milano and Real Madrid] are going to have us spinning with some of the things they do just from the [extra] time that they’ve been playing together. “These two teams can run teams out of the gym on any given night with their level of play. That’s a good thing for us right now.” By SCOTT SOUZA", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:29:25.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
