Just four of those goals were at even strength. Voracek's last 35 games had resulted in just 19 points and one even strength goal. \nThe narrative against Giroux's even-strength numbers - especially at Wells Fargo Center - was written about at length last season. \nGiroux silenced any carryover with a second-period, even-strength goal to help the Flyers pound the Blackhawks, 3-0, in front of a raucous atmosphere on a night the Flyers honored Kimmo Timonen. \nGiroux's goal extended the Flyers' lead to 2-0 after Sam Gagner - in the lineup for the second straight game - put the Flyers ahead with a power-play goal 5 1/2 minutes into the period. Gagner's wrist shot beat Blackhawks goalie Corey Crawford high over his glove. \nGiroux's goal, which came with less than four minutes left in the second period, was the result of a failed wraparound attempt by his linemate, Michael Raffl. The puck came off Crawford's pad and right onto the stick of the waiting Giroux, who put it past Crawford in tight and let off a big fist pump to celebrate. \nLast year, it took Giroux 36 home games to score his first even-strength goal in front of the home crowd. That was in March, against the same Blackhawks. \nMatt Read sealed the game following up a Wayne Simmonds shot that was mishandled by Crawford to put the game away with 2:35 to go in the game. \nThe Flyers played another strong defensive game in front of goalie Michal Neuvirth, who again filled in for starter Steve Mason (personal leave). Neuvirth became the first Flyers goalie since Jeff Hackett (October 2003) to record back-to-back shutouts in his first two starts in a Flyers uniform. He stopped all 30 Chicago attempts on goal after stopping 31 Monday in a 1-0 win over Florida. \nThe 120 minutes of shutout hockey is the longest the Flyers have ever gone to open a season at home. \nFor the second straight game, his best work came in the third period. Chicago outshot the Flyers by 15-5 in the third period, failing to score on three power-play opportunities. \nAfter blocking 17 shots in Monday's win against Florida, Flyers players combined for 17 more blocks, with Mark Streit's four blocks leading the way. \nThe Flyers, winners in two straight, take a 2-1-1 record into a brief break. They don't play again until Tuesday, a home game against the Dallas Stars. \nOn Twitter: @Jeff_Neiburg", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T06:52:03.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
