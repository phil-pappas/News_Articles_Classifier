Oct. 16, 2015 (Photo: Scott Utterback/The C-J ) Buy Photo 9 CONNECT 29 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLEXINGTON, Ky. – Anthony Davis was only at the University of Kentucky for a year, hasn't lived here since the spring of 2012, but every time he's returned – for alumni games or, as was the case Saturday, an NBA exhibition at Rupp Arena – it's like he's coming home. \n\"It feels amazing, just brings back memories of when I played here,\" Davis said before his New Orleans Pelicans played the Sacramento Kings and former Wildcats stars DeMarcus Cousins, Willie Cauley-Stein and Rajon Rondo. \"It's just amazing to realize the fan base that Kentucky has behind you. Whether you're in the league or you're playing here, they're still going to support you no matter what.\" \nThey'd roared for Davis the night before, when he was a guest at UK's annual Big Blue Madness event. Although he said it was not planned for the benefit of several high-profile recruits on hand, Davis entered the arena in the middle of John Calipari's speech and the cheering caused his old coach to pause and introduce him. \n\"Coach Cal don't hold that much weight around here anymore,\" Davis joked. \"It just shows that I got much more power than Coach Cal.\" Ex-Cats, Drake fire up Big Blue Madness \nWhen it comes to cool, that's hard to argue. Davis, who led the Cats to an NCAA title, won national player of the year and was the No. 1 overall NBA draft pick in 2012, has already become one of the biggest stars in the NBA. His presence at Madness certainly didn't hurt with the latest batch of recruits. \nHe can still remember being on the other side, coming to that event as a high school star, and thinking: \"I'm coming here.\" UK always spends at least a quarter of a million dollars on bells and whistles to entertain fans and, more importantly, impress the visiting prospects. \n\"No one does it better than Kentucky,\" Davis said. \"Once you see that, it's one of the things that made me commit.\" \nThat experience \"opens your eyes to a lot of things.\" He can still recall – and on Saturday pointed to – the exact spot where he was standing for Madness six years ago. \n\"You just get chills,\" he said. \"Even when you're walking around and people are like, 'What's up, Anthony?' These people already know me? It just changes your whole perspective of college basketball.\" Video | Former UK star Willie Cauley-Stein discusses what Big Blue Madness means to recruits, Kyle Tucker/The C-J \nCauley-Stein, who the Kings drafted sixth overall this summer after a three-year UK career that included two Final Fours, couldn't agree more. He also became sold on the Cats while visiting for Big Blue Madness in 2011 – and he also has vivid memories of the experience. \n\"I don't see how you don't come here if you see that,\" he said. \"Every pro was here. John Wall was here. Rondo was here. All the dudes were back. (Back) then, I didn't think I was coming here. And then I came (to Madness) and was like, 'Oh, this is it, Ma. I'm going to Kentucky.' It's just that live.\" \nCalipari and the Cats like to say there's no place like this, and Cauley-Stein's reaction to life in the NBA supports that idea. All the attention, the autograph requests, the media obligations, the expectations must be a bit overwhelming for a rookie, right? \n\"It's about the same as college,\" Cauley-Stein said. \"Or at least at Kentucky.\" Big Blue Nation flocks to Rupp Arena every year to watch the Cats practice and to hear Coach Calipari's yearly speech. \nDavis was playing the part of tour guide for his teammates this weekend. Some were shocked by UK's on-campus practice facility and palatial Rupp Arena locker room, each of which are nicer than many in the NBA. \n\"I get a chance to show them what Kentucky basketball is all about, and they love it,\" Davis said. \"I get a chance to see old teammates that I played with, and to get to experience Big Blue Madness again is an amazing feeling. I'm excited to come back every year.\" \nKyle Tucker can be reached at (502) 582-4361. Email him at ktucker@courier-journal.com.
