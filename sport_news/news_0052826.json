The Carlisle captain drilled a low 18-yard curler which went in just inside goalkeeper Barry Roche's left-hand post.However, a mistake by Newcastle loanee Macauley Gillesphey let in Miller for Morecambe's equaliser in the 35th minute. The defender gave the ball away inside his own half and Miller broke forward to leave Mark Gillespie helpless with a raking 20-yard drive.Kennedy's luck was out when he hit the bar for the second time in the 60th minute with a header from Grainger's cross.But Morecambe's pace up front bothered Carlisle and leading scorer Barkhuizen missed a couple of chances before finally grabbing his sixth goal of the season when he raced away with no defenders near him to slot the ball past Gillespie.Miller made it 3-1 in the 74th minute, applying a close-range, far-post finish after Jamie Devitt had whipped in a cross from the left.Asamoah lashed home a second goal for Carlisle in added time after latching on to Michael Raynes' header, but it came too late to change the outcome of the game.
