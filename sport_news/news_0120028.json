Both ranked in the top 12. Big Ten race. College Football Playoff hopes. Bragging rights. All on the line. \nWe barely can wait, but kickoff isn't till 3:30 p.m. Saturday (ESPN). \nIn the meantime, check out our experts' predictions: \nMark Snyder \nMichigan 21, Michigan State 14: Michigan has all the momentum with its remarkably consistency and uberconfident defense . The Spartans have explosive offensive potential, but it has been inconsistent all year, and the defense has been vulnerable to the big play, which U-M has made often, especially in the run game. Week after week, many have expected the Wolverines tore turn to earth and MSU to regain its championship pedigree. At some point, maybe it's just a new season. \nJoe Rexrode \nMichigan 30, Michigan State 21. The Spartans can win this game, and it's not like it would take a complete Michigan collapse for that to happen. Even with U-M soaring and MSU struggling and smarting, these teams are close. And the Spartans have had a week of hearing how they'll lose . MSU's offense will get things done against U-M's defense . But the MSU defense lacks confidence and cohesion. And the MSU kicking game is a mess. That's the difference. \nMitch Albom \nMichigan State 24, Michigan 23: Anyone remotely healthy for the Spartans will play. They know, and their coach knows, that the season is shot if they lose this game. Michigan, on the other hand, is playing with house money. Usually, that makes you pick the looser team, and the Wolverines could well win this one on better attitude alone. But something tells me that everything we have seen with the Spartans the last few seasons should not be dismissed. But, hey. Rivalry week. Predictions are as foolish as the point spread . \nDrew Sharp \nMichigan State 21, Michigan 17: If Connor Cook plays like a first-round NFL draft pick, the Spartans have an excellent chance, regardless of the array of injuries that have claimed nine of the 22 projected starters . That might explain MSU's difficulties, but it doesn't excuse them. Michigan doesn't intimidate the Spartans. But you still must battle through the pain. Quarterbacking will make the difference Saturday. And Cook can further cement his legacy as one of the biggest winners in Michigan State football history. Rivalry experience has MSU's Cook prepared for U-M \nJeff Seidel \nMichigan 24, Michigan State 17: Michigan's defense will be the story of the game, slowing down MSU's running game and getting pressure on Connor Cook. Cook will keep it close, throwing back-shoulder passes and finding some small windows. But Michigan quarterback Jake Rudock will manage the game, get a few first downs with his legs and finally connect on a deep pass, giving U-M a seven-point win. \nShawn Windsor \nMichigan State 20, Michigan 17: So many things to think about as we consider the game of the century . This is a good place to start: How the heck did we get here? It's a safe bet that MSU has been asking itself that for a while now, and that Mark Dantonio is using his underdog status as fuel. Look, the Spartans have the better quarterback and more explosive receivers. If the offensive line is healthy, that should be enough for MSU to stick around into the fourth quarter. U-M will run the ball well and take advantage of MSU's inconsistent safety and cornerback play. In the end, though, this Spartan group is a bit too seasoned and frothy not to find a way to pull it out.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:37:06.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
