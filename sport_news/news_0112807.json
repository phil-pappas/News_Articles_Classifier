Thinkstock We've been reporting about the marijuana policies of presidential candidates , some of whom would like to turn back the clock on legal recreational sales in Colorado and a handful of other states.\nBut there are plenty of reasons to let Colorado's experiment go forward.\nMillions of them, in fact.\nIn March, recreational marijuana sales topped $42 million , with total cannabis sales exceeding $81 million when the medical marijuana figures were added.\nAt the time, the retail numbers represented a new record.\nNow, they look modest in comparison with the latest digits.\nNew Colorado Department of Revenue data shows $59.2 million in recreational sales and $41.4 from medical marijuana sales during August — a sizable bump from those March figures of five months earlier. Add the sums and you get $100.6 million.\nRelated Stories Recreational Marijuana Sales Top $42 Million in March, Another New Record National Cannabis Summit Highlights a Week Full of Pot Events The benefits of such revenue for the Colorado economy are obvious — and counties across the state are doing mighty well, too.\nWe've included a document featuring the latest tax info below. But here's a graphic revealing how much revenue assorted Colorado counties collected from recreational marijuana sales in August....\nColorado.gov ...as well as one showing the haul from medical marijuana sales....\nColorado.gov ...and a third depicting local government distribution of the 10 percent retail marijuana tax.\nColorado.gov Note that the totals don't include local taxes placed on marijuana by many municipalities.\nThose amounts would boost the figures even higher.\nBy now, it's clear that those who predicted that marijuana sales would quickly plateau once the novelty of recreational sales wore off could hardly have been further off-base. Coming up on two years since the January 2014 launch of recreational sales, the numbers continue to build.\nMeanwhile, local governments have become ever more accustomed to the steadily increasing flow of marijuana tax money — and in all likelihood, even officials who opposed Amendment 64, the 2012 measure that legalized limited recreational sales in the state, would find it painful to suddenly go cold turkey when it comes to such funds.\nLook below to find the document compiling data from marijuana taxes, licenses, fees, transfers and distribution for the month of August 2015.\nColorado Marijuana Tax Figures August 2015\nContact: Michael Roberts Follow: Michael Roberts Westword Westword", "external_links": ["https://www.colorado.gov/pacific/revenue/colorado-marijuana-tax-data", "https://www.scribd.com/doc/284548427/Colorado-Marijuana-Tax-Figures-August-2015", "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Michael-RobertsWestword/111180895657427", "http://www.twitter.com/denverwestword", "https://www.scribd.com/embeds/284548427/content?start_page=1&view_mode=scroll&access_key=key-K0QR76Jxv7dz4Eo0Ki0u&show_recommendations=true", "https://www.facebook.com/DenverWestword"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:11:14.767+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
