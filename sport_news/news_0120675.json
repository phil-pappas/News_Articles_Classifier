The City's attempt to regulate this message is an attempt to restrain the expression of conditions of poverty to other citizens.\"\nThe permanent injunction in Grand Junction prompted Police Chief Robert White to send a bulletin to officers notifying them that \"effectively immediately,\" officers may not charge people for panhandling.\nAdvertisement \"Denver did a commendable thing taking prompt action to suspend enforcement of a panhandling ordinance that violates the First Amendment rights of a people who ask for charity in public places,\" Silverstein said.\nDays earlier, the Colorado Springs Police Department ordered police to stop issuing panhandling citations \"on or near streets or highways\" after the ACLU accused the city of illegally enforcing panhandling ordinances.\nThe police department also stated that \"passive solicitation is lawful everywhere in the city.\"\nOn Friday, Sgt. Nick Smetzer with the Boulder Police Department said he didn't think the Grand Junction ruling and resulting Denver police response would affect the way Boulder officers handle panhandling.\nHe said officers didn't have an issue with people asking for charity \"as long as they're not bothering anybody doing it.\"\nSilverstein believes that this ruling will cause ripple effects throughout the state.\n\"I believe that all or almost all of the panhandling ordinances in Colorado will need to be reviewed and many will need to be repealed or dramatically amended,\" Silverstein said. \"Denver is commendable for getting out in front of that.\"\nThere are still conditions in which officers could charge someone for panhandling including things like using volent or threatening gestures, touching others, blocking a vehicle or pedestrian and soliciting from someone in a vehicle, according to the bulletin given to Denver officers.\nThe order from White is a suspension, meaning that city council is considering formal amendments to the ordinance to \"bring the law into compliance with recent court rulings,\" the document said.\nElizabeth Hernandez: 303-954-1223, ehernandez@denverpost.com or twitter.com/ehernandez", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T10:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:02:27.030+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
