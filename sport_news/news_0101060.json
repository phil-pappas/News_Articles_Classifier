(Photo: Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nVOORHEES Sam Gagner was getting a workout in Saturday night, watching on TV in the locker room as his teammates got — as Wayne Simmonds put it — “spanked.” \nGagner, 26, hadn’t been scratched in consecutive games in his career until the Flyers’ losses to the Tampa Bay Lightning and Florida Panthers. \n“I want to be a part of things,” said Gagner, whom the Flyers acquired at the draft from the Arizona Coyotes. “I definitely feel like I can help, so it’s frustrating. I want to be out there helping my team. To not be able to, it’s not fun, but hopefully (Monday) and hopefully I get a chance to do that.” \nSunday, it appeared as though that chance may come soon. R.J. Umberger was missing from practice with what the team called a “maintenance day.” The last time the Flyers used that term was with goalie Michal Neuvirth, who was actually injured. \nSimmonds, who had been on Sean Couturier’s line, was moved to Scott Laughton’s. Sunday’s practice had Gagner on the right wing of Couturier’s line with Brayden Schenn on the left. \nMight Dave Hakstol be mulling a change? \n“Possibly,” the coach said. “I haven’t made any lineup decisions yet. It’s too early.” \nThrough the first two games, Gagner and Vinny Lecavalier have been the two scratches on offense – both healthy. That means sitting nearly $8 million in salary against the cap on gamedays. \nThat’s about as close to literal as the Flyers can come to putting their money where their mouth is when saying they’ll suit up the best lineup regardless of salary. \nBut Gagner thinks that may not be the case. He had one goal and three assists in six of the team’s seven preseason games, playing all three forward positions. \n“I thought I had not a great camp, but a good enough camp to be in the lineup,” Gagner said. “The motivation’s there. I want to be out there helping my teammates and helping it be a playoff team. That’s my main focus. I feel like I’ve kept a good attitude, pushed myself in practice to stay ready. Hopefully when the opportunity comes I can get in there and stay in there for good.” \nNo player likes to sit, but there were expectations on Gagner to help the Flyers’ offense that ranked 20th in the league last year. After getting traded from Edmonton and Arizona in the last two years and Coyotes GM Don Maloney publically saying “at the end of the day, we didn't think he could play center at the National Hockey League level for us,” Gagner was hoping he wouldn’t have to wait to prove people wrong. \n“I felt like I played pretty well (in preseason),” Gagner said. “The production was there. I don’t really know what to say.” \nNot having the opportunity to help the Flyers made Gagner’s workout Saturday night even more frustrating. \n“I think during the preseason we got to see him in different spots,” Hakstol said. “At this point in time, unless things change, we see him as a winger. To say it’s been tough to find a spot…it’s early. I’ve said it. We’re gonna need everybody here and when he gets his opportunity, he’ll be in and he’ll be ready.” Flyers eager for home opener \nMonday night the Flyers will open their home slate against the Florida Panthers, the team that just “spanked” them Saturday. The Flyers will be looking for revenge, but are even more excited just to play at Wells Fargo Center. \n“Home opener is always fun,” Jake Voracek said. “It’s always a little bit special. It’s fun. Everybody’s excited to play in front of the home crowd. We don’t want to give them two points.” \nIt will also mark the first home game that counts for Hakstol, who only really admitted to feeling any emotion at all about his rookie NHL season before the national anthem of the Flyers’ first preseason game. \n“It’s 100 percent different just from, I’m sure, the atmosphere to the intensity,” Hakstol said. “And the level of play at the regular season is a whole different animal.” Loose pucks \nFormer Flyers coach Craig Berube will be in the building for the home opener. He will be scouting for the World Cup of Hockey next year on behalf of Hockey Canada. … Despite giving up four goals in less than seven minutes, Steve Mason will get the start for the Flyers against the Panthers. \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com .
