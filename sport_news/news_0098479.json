What do you think? Log in and start commenting \nAlthough they beat Second City rivals Blues in the League Cup and threatened to get something at Anfield when going down 3-2 to Liverpool, a derby-day defeat to Albion and last Saturday’s 1-0 home loss to Stoke City means Villa are already four points adrift of safety. \nSherwood has been booed off at the end of matches against Stoke and Albion, as well as at half-time against Blues. \nAnd he admitted last week that he is still searching to come up with his best 11 after a summer overhaul of the squad in which he spent more than £50m – mainly on unproven players from France. \nReports at the weekend suggest Villa's next two games – away at Chelsea followed by a home clash against Swansea City – could be crucial to Sherwood's future. \nOne claim suggested Sherwood could be fired if he fails to win one of the clashes.
