Rayo's Jozabed hit a late consolation goal, but it was very much Neymar's night. \nThose results saw Spain's big two move two poin ts clear of Villarreal, who face Celta Vigo on Sunday. \nAlso on Saturday, Sevilla came from behind to salvage a 1-1 draw at Eibar - but their unconvincing away form should concern them heading into Wednesday's Champions League visit to Manchester City. \nBorja Baston gave in-form Eibar an early lead but the mid-table Andalusian visitors improved in the second half and drew level through Kevin Gameiro's close-range effort on 71 minutes.
