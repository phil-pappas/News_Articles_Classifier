It's a chance for them to respond. You look at the way Texas responded this past weekend with a lot of media scrutiny. I expect USC to respond the same way.\" \nThe firing of coach Steve Sarkisian on Monday means the Trojans enter the game with their fourth coach in four seasons. Lane Kiffin was coach in 2012 when the top-ranked Irish won 22-13. Notre Dame beat USC and interim-coach Ed Orgeron 14-10 in the second game after Kiffin was fired in 2013. Sarkisian guided the Trojans to a 49-14 victory last season. \nA week ago, both teams were ranked and the game looked as though it would be a resume-building victory for the winner trying to make a case for a College Football Playoffs berth. \nUSC's 17-12 loss to Washington on Thursday in a game where the Trojans were favored by more than two touchdowns ended that. It will now be the ninth straight year the game won't pit two ranked teams. \nThat's quite a change from when the rivalry's heyday in the '60s and '70s when the winner won six AP national titles, with Notre Dame winning in 1966, '73 and '74. The Trojans won in 1962, '67 and '72. USC won two more titles in voting by the coaches in 1974 and 1978. \nStill, Kelly believes a win over the unranked Trojans (3-2) would provide a boost for the Irish (5-1). \n\"I still think when you talk about beating USC it still carries a lot of weight because people know the talent they have on that football team,\" he said. \nThe Trojans embarrassed the Irish last season when Cody Kessler threw for six touchdown passes in a 49-14 victory. Kelly last year called the loss a red letter day for Notre Dame, saying \"We got our butts beat and it wasn't as close as the score.\" \nKelly said Tuesday it's not something he will bring up this week because the Irish players know \"that standard of play is not acceptable.\" \nKelly, who has never faced a ranked USC team as Notre Dame coach, said the game is just as important as always for those involved. \n\"There's a special feeling playing USC. I know that that still resonates with our players and coaches,\" he said. \"Look, whether it's a rivalry that goes back with implications to the national championship or not, for us in the short term, we got beat up pretty good against them last year. For our football team, we certainly want to show ourselves a lot better than we did last year.\" \nWHAT'S AT STAKE \nThe Fighting Irish have to keep winning to keep their College Football Playoff hopes alive. USC already has lost two home conference games and is looking to end a tumultuous week after the firing of coach Steve Sarkisian. \nKEY MATCHUP \nUSC QB Cody Kessler vs. Notre Dame secondary. Kessler was held without a touchdown pass, the first time that's happened in a year, and threw two interceptions in a 17-12 loss to Washington. Kessler ranks seventh in the nation in pass completions at 69.5 percent and 20th in yards per game at 290.6. He threw for 372 yards and six touchdowns against the Irish a year ago. The Notre Dame secondary has struggled at times, giving up eight passes of 25 yards. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nUSC: CB/WR Adoree Jackson. The 5-11, 185-pound sophomore was in for 94 plays against Washington, including a season-high 30 snaps at receiver. He could be forced to play a lot on offense again this week because of injuries. He has 10 catches for 196 yards and 11 tackles and a pass breakup. He also averaging 10.2 yards per punt return and 23 yards a kickoff return. \nNotre Dame: DL Sheldon Day. The 6-2, 285-pound senior has 21 tackles and career-highs with eight tackles for loss, two sacks and has matched his career-high with nine quarterback hurries and has been disruptive all season. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nUSC head coaches are winless in six tries when their first games against Notre Dame are in South Bend. .. Notre Dame is averaging 503 yards a game total offense. The Irish haven't averaged 500 yards a game since 1970. ... USC teams with two or more losses are 2-16 in South Bend. The wins came in 1971 and 1997. ... Notre Dame RB C.J. Prosise has two games this season where he has rushed for three touchdowns. The only other Irish running back to do that in the past 100 years was Reggie Brooks in 1992. \nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:30:47.066+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
