The Super Eagles is like a family, there could be misunderstanding and I believe the NFF, who are the father of both Oliseh and Enyeama, to wade in. \n\"Yes, call the two parties together with the purpose of settling whatever misunderstanding between them because Nigeria needs Enyeama, Super Eagles need his experience and for the good of the Nations Cup ticket, we cannot afford to prosecute it with a divided house,” Akwuegbu pleaded. \nAkwuegbu is current coach of Austrian third-tier league side, FC Gratkorn, having earlier turned down interest from Belgian side, KRC Harelbeke. \nHe believes that it is not important pointing fingers as to who is right or wrong in the feud between Sunday Oliseh and Super Eagles captain Vincent Enyeama which led to the Lille of France shot-stopper calling time on his international career. \n“The issue at the moment is not who is right, neither is it who is wrong. What is important is peace. Super Eagles are in the middle of a competition like Nations Cup qualifier. \n“Unity is important, the qualification ticket is vital and to achieve this there must be peace, there must be unity. \n“So, the two parties must sheath their daggers for the good of the country,” Akwuegbu stressed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:16:18.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
