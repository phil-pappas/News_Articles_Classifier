Second, will the Michigan punter be “accidentally” fed to the crocodiles in his home country of Australia? Finally — what did the people in Hawaii do to all those sharks that made them go on a feeding frenzy? I knew their football team stunk but c’mon! It was a wacky week on the turf again as Winfield laid another goose egg in Augusta, Kansas State got run over by Oklahoma (literally) and most of the crowd actually stayed and watched KU’s game until the very end as the Jayhawks played their best game of the year to date! Also, Southwestern delighted a packed homecoming crowd as the Builders SHUT OUT their rivals, the Bethany Swedes, by 24-0! Speaking of shut outs, our Skunk of the Week game goes to Wichita Collegiate this week who SLAMMED the door shut on Leon-Bluestem, beating them by a blistering 76-0! kA 4=2DDlQAbQm%96 E@A vFCF E9:D H66< H2D $@??J H9@ 925 2 !t#utr% #tr~#s @7 `d\\_P $92C:?8 E96 CF??6C\\FA A@D:E:@? 2C6 E96 E9C66 >FD<6E66CD @7 tC:4[ $4@EE 2?5 r2DDJ H:E9 E96:C >2E49:?8 >2C<D @7 `c\\`P $E2J:?8 9@=65\\FA :?
