No. 4 Michigan State beats No. 14 Michigan in shocking fashion \nMoments after the improbable win (ESPN Stats and Information says MSU had a 0.2 percent win probability going into the final play) a Twitter account was set up to salt Michigan’s wounds. \n“Michigan’s Punter,” with the handle @michiganpunter , took to the Twittersphere to say in its first tweet, “Sorry everyone. I blew it.” Sorry everyone. I blew it — Michigan's Punter (@michiganpunter) October 17, 2015 \nThree minutes later: “There goes my scholarship,\" a tweet that saw thousands of retweets and favorites. There goes my scholarship — Michigan's Punter (@michiganpunter) October 17, 2015 \nIt’s a shame for Michigan punter -- the real one -- Blake O’Neill, who had a tremendous game punting the football. \nHe pinned the Spartans inside the 20-yard line three times and sent one booming punt an incredible 80 yards (it’s hard to make punting sound exciting, but trust me, these are impressive stats). \nBut the repetitive highlights, internet GIFs and ESPN Classic re-runs won’t focus on the hang time on O’Neill’s punts. \n@Michiganpunter certainly isn’t. The third tweet (and final tweet as of the initial posting of this article) joked that the Australian native O’Neill was headed back to his home country. I'm moving back to Australia — Michigan's Punter (@michiganpunter) October 18, 2015 \nThe parody account had over 600 followers in its first hour of existence. \nThe internet is a fascinating place. Michigan State had a 0.2% win probability before THIS. https://t.co/DtZZJ6D9Nj", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:45:48.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
