(WGEM) - \nWith a (3-)0 record in the toughest football conference in the country, the Western Illinois football players are beginning to believe they belong to be ranked in the Top 25. This week the Leathernecks are coming in at number 20 in the STATS FCS Poll.\"It's nice to be recognized. At the same time, rankings don't mean much until the very end of the year,\" says head coach Bob Nielson. \"Our goal is to be a better football team this week.\"A week after beating ranked Northern Iowa team, the weary Western Illinois squad gets no rest. Bob Nielson and his staff now have to prepare their team l for a date with the only other undefeated team in Missouri Valley Conference play, Illinois State. \"It's just the mindset of this team right now. South Dakota week we took care of South Dakota. UNI (Northern Iowa) week we took care of UNI. This week we're taking care of Illinois State,\" said redshirt-freshman Xavier Rowe. \"We have tunnel vision. It's just one week at a time until we are where we want to be.\" The Leatherecks' defense which only gives up 155 yards on the ground per game.However they will have their hands full, Saturday, while trying to stop the conference's leading rusher Marshuan Coprich. \"Their skill players are really good but I also think we have the skill players that can take care of that,\" said Rowe. \"We should be fine and be 4-0 and number one in the conference.\" A way around the Redbirds defense could be through it.Illinois State's defense gives up 175 yards on the ground per game, allowing Nikko Watson and company room to run.\"Our main focus is to spread out the defense and open up some holes for me on the inside,\" says senior running back Nikko Watson. \"If they want to load the box, then we can pass to Lance (Lenoir Jr.) and Joey (Borsellino) on the outside. It's a good one-two punch.\" A win over Illinois State would also be Western Illinois' first over the Redbirds since 2010. Kickoff is 2:00p.m. on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:33:06.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
