AP\nCOMMENTARY\nSo much for waiting until January for any big broadcasting news . Per a press release Thursday night, NESN announced that incoming play-by-play voice Dave O’Brien will be joined by longtime color commentator Jerry Remy for at least 100 games on the network’s Red Sox broadcasts next season.\nDennis Eckersley and Steve Lyons, both of whom have booth experience but have usually served as studio analysts on NESN’s broadcasts, will also join O’Brien—who is replacing the beloved Don Orsillo, as you may have heard—from time to time. One or the other will also join O’Brien and Remy in a three-man booth on occasion.\nWithout considering the curious path that brought NESN to this point, an easy conclusion can be drawn: The Red Sox are going to have an outstanding television broadcast team next season.\nOn most nights, it should rate on the short list of the best in baseball, though Dodgers icon Vin Scully owns the top spot permanently until he turns off the microphone for the final time. Rumor has it that San Diego also has some serious and appealing talent in its TV booth.\nOf course, that curious path can’t be entirely overlooked, because viewers aren’t ready to forget how NESN got to this point. Yes, NESN got this right, or as right as it could have given the unnecessary decision to dump Orsillo, an immensely likable broadcaster who had built up a decade-and-a-half of trust and shared, memorable baseball experiences with the audience.\nA large, vocal segment of Red Sox fans did not want a change in narrator for our best Red Sox memories. But since those with the power to make a change decided to wield that clout, it must be acknowledged that the broadcast team they did assemble is one Red Sox fans will enjoy, presuming they eventually allow themselves to enjoy it.\nSome fans, a scattered but determined few, have told me they will boycott NESN’s broadcasts next season in protest of the decision to dump Orsillo. I admire that loyalty, but suspect the vow will be a challenge to sustain if the Red Sox field a winning team. Just when you think you’re out …\nO’Brien is a superb broadcaster, as anyone who has heard him call baseball and college basketball games on ESPN or listened to Red Sox radio broadcasts over the past nine seasons should be aware. (Strangely, some among us aren’t aware: I’ve been bewildered during this whole process by the number of Red Sox fans who were furious with NESN’s dismissal of Orsillo, but were utterly unfamiliar with O’Brien’s work. I suspect it’s a demographic thing.) O’Brien will win you over if you let him, and maybe even if you resist.\nMore Eckersley in the booth? That’s always a good thing. I’ve written this a few times before, but I’m always happy to reiterate it, because I grow stauncher in the opinion with each passing national broadcast in which we’re subjected to Harold Reynolds’s relentless non sequiturs with Fox Sports and Cal Ripken Jr.’s grumbled generalities on TBS: Eck is the best baseball analyst around, national, regional, radio, television, whatever. He’s been in the booth with Remy, his former teammate from 1978-84 with the Red Sox, on a couple of occasions, and the hitter-pitcher banter and insight has been excellent. NESN is lucky to have him. So are we.\nThe news that Lyons would be part of the mix in the booth next season generated a mostly negative reaction in my Twitter feed. I understand the frustrations—he’s too talkative sometimes, and his sense of humor can be crude. I don’t mind him, though, more or less perceiving him in the same way I did during his four stints with the Red Sox as a player. He can fill in when those more talented are unavailable and hold his own until they return. He’ll occasionally make you laugh, more than occasionally make you wonder what he was thinking, but generally does no harm if he remembers his limitations. He’s replacement-level, though probably a little worse than Chico Walker would be if the Red Sox just gave him a chance.\nI must admit to some level of surprise—pleasant surprise, that is—that Remy will play such a significant role in 2016. I assume the three-man rotation saves NESN a few bucks since it cuts back Remy’s duties without really enhancing Eckersley’s or Lyons’s, who were already under contract.\nI do wonder whether the backlash regarding Orsillo’s departure was a factor in the decision to retain Remy in such a prominent role. When he spent the ninth inning of the 162nd game of the 2015 season silent and in tears as Orsillo called his final three outs of their 15 seasons together, I wondered whether some of Remy’s raw emotion within the moment came from a hunch that it might be his final game, too.\nNESN never said anything other than that Remy would be back in some role. But until the confirmation came, as it did yesterday, you could never be sure. As an analyst, he had one of his most engaging and incisive seasons in years. I’m glad he’s sticking around.\nIt will be fascinating to hear O’Brien and Remy together. During those ballgames when Eck is in the mix, it should be an exceptional trio. But the whole thing will take some getting used to for all of us.\nNESN has rallied from its awkward dismissal of Orsillo to put together an excellent broadcasting team. But if it takes a long time for fans whose anger is still smoldering from how this all went down, well, that’s the network’s own doing, too.\nChad Finn can be reached at finn@globe.com .
