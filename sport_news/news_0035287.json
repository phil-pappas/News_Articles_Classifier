Posted: Saturday, October 17, 2015 12:12 am Tigers take tumble against Pine Tree By JORDAN MOSS Tribune sports writer dailytribune.net | 0 comments The Mount Pleasant Tigers playoff chances are slipping away. Mount Pleasant fell to 2-2 in district play losing on the road at Pine Tree by a score of 28-17. The Tigers were in the game all the way to the fourth quarter and had multiple chances to re-take the lead towards the end of the game. The Pirates led 21-17 but failed to make two field goal attempts, one hitting the post and Mount Pleasant blocking the other. Mount Pleasant was unable to capitalize and regain the lead. The Tigers offense could not get anything going earning just two first downs in the entire second half. A late Pine Tree touchdown by running back Maliq Owens sealed the victory for the Pirates putting Pine Tree up 28-17 with 1:40 to play. Owens finished with 195 yards on 30 carries with a pair of second half scoring runs. Pirate quarterback Daniel Bonamy threw for 10-of-15 for 156 yards and one TD. Pirates receiver Konnor Johnson hauled in four receptions for 11 yards. Tigers running back Travion Holloman finished with 129 yards on 24 carries and caught two passes for 41 yards including a 36-yard touchdown reception. Quarterback Ladarrius Patterson completed 5-of-12 passing for 123 yards with one TD and one interception. Wide receiver Kevin Perez caught three passes for 80 yards. The Tigers caught a break on the first Pine Tree play on offense when Owens fumbled the ball allowing Mount Pleasant to take possession on the 18. The Tigers failed to find the end zone despite the short field but were able to get on the scoreboard first with a Sammy Puente field goal to take a 3-0 lead with 8:12 to go in the first. It took the Pirates just four plays to respond when quarterback Paul Bonamy hit Konnor Johnson for a 71 yard touchdown pass on a 3-and-12 to put Pine Tree in front 7-3 with 6:26 left in the first quarter. Holloman put the Tigers back in front with a 36-yard touchdown reception from Patterson giving Mount Pleasant a 10-7 lead with 2:09 remaining in the first. Special teams errors once again hurt Mount Pleasant. The Tigers had a bad snap go over the punters head setting up Pine Tree with the ball on the Mount Pleasant 4-yard line late in the second quarter. Three plays later Shaffer Russell ran the ball in for the Pirates to put them up 14-10 with 1:14 till halftime. Mount Pleasant responded quickly when Holloman broke a 39-yard run putting the Tigers in position to score before the break. Holloman capped off the drive with a 14-yard TD to give Mount Pleasant a 17-14 lead heading into halftime. In the second half the Pirates defense shut the Tigers down. Mount Pleasant failed to move the ball or find any rhythm on offense while Owns began gaining steam on the ground for the Pirates. A 6-yard Owens score put the Pirates up 21-17 with 6:05 left in the third quarter and the Pirates never trailed again. The Tigers will next be in action at 7:30 p.m. this coming Friday night when they host Longview at Sam Parker field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:15:10.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
