He said yesterday there were some talks about an extension with the Bruins when Peter Chiarelli was still the general manager, but those did not go too far. And when unrestricted free agents-to-be like Soderberg were allowed to speak to teams a week before free agency began, he found that the Avs were very interested in him.\nThe B’s accommodated him by trading his rights at the draft to Colorado for a sixth-round pick in 2016 and, before free agency even began, Soderberg was a rich man, signing a five-year, $23.75 million deal. It was a contract the cash-strapped Bruins would have never been able to afford, even if they wanted to.\n“I knew the Avalanche was a team that wanted me and they were the most interested team. They called me a week before I got to free agency and I said, ‘Yeah, of course, I want to sign.’ I tried to get that trade done and I did,” said Soderberg, whose rights had been traded to the Bruins from St. Louis for goalie Hannu Toivonen in 2007.\nThe B’s precipitous fall from elite status to also-ran coincided with Soderberg’s time in Boston, though he remembers his two-plus years fondly — for the most part.\n“It was a great time, especially the first years,” said Soderberg, who had a pair of assists in his first two games. “The first year we went to the (Stanley Cup) finals and the second year we won the Presidents’ Trophy. Still, I think we all know in the playoffs we could have made a good run when we lost Game 7 to Montreal. That was a big disappointment. Then last year wasn’t very fun at all. It was hard for all of us.”\nDid he have any clue why things went off the rails last year?\n“No idea,” said Soderberg. “We worked hard the whole year but we didn’t get anything going. We still got (96) points or something but it was a hard year to make the playoffs. It was a hard year.”\nWhile it appeared that the Avs had signed Soderberg to be their second-line center — a role he had trouble with in Boston — he is currently centering a third line between youngsters Mikko Rantanen and Borna Rendulic.\nCoach Patrick Roy, who spoke highly of Soderberg’s work thus far, said he’s been dropped to the third line not through any fault of his own, but because Roy wanted to move Nathan MacKinnon back to center behind top pivot Matt Duchene.\n“He’s a team guy, and I appreciate that,” said Roy.\nFormer Bruins winger Jarome Iginla, who signed with Colorado before last season, said Soderberg gives the Avs an element they were missing.\n“I think he’s been great. We’ve been this skilled team, we have a good, skilled fast group. But to add his size has been good, and he’s a competitor,” said Iginla. “He’s big in the corners, he’s in front of the net, he keeps the puck a long time.\n“It’s been a good fit, guys like him and (Francois) Beauchemin and (Blake) Comeau to go with (John) Mitchell and (Cody) MacLeod, to add the size and the grit with the skill has been good and we’re starting to build that identity to where we’re not just a skilled team but a physical, aggressive team, too. And he’s a big part of that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:25:14.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
