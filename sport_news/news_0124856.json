Every phase failed. Every. One.\nThe Eagles just whipped the Saints. You can't spin it any other way.\nNew Orleans' offense lacked punch in both phases. The defense allowed a previously rattled Sam Bradford all the time in the universe within the pocket to pick apart the Saints even after two interceptions in the end zone.\nSean Payton, 'We struggled to stay on the field offensivelyâ€™ The Eagles beat the Saints 39-17 in Philadelphia, Sunday Oct. 11, 2015.\nAnd poor, poor Brandon Fields with two shanks on punts. Your time in New Orleans will be brief.\nUnfortunately for you Who Dats, this season is just getting longer despite fewer games. ...\nThe Saints seemed to pick up numerous breaks from the officiating end with a couple of pass interference penalties waived off after the officials conferred. The trend turned against the Saints late in the second quarter, though.\nDrew Brees hit the deck for a sack-fumble the Eagles' Fletcher Cox . But it appeared like Brees' elbow was at least down and possibly his knee before the ball came loose. Even Fox Sports officiating expert Mike Pereira said via Twitter, \"They have to find where #DrewBrees loses possession, looks like the knee is down first on the review.\"\nDrew Brees, 'This game should have been much closer. We turned the ball over four times' Drew Brees, 'This game should have been much closer. We turned the ball over four times'\nAnd yet the Saints received another break with an unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on the Philadelphia bench. The Saints defense at least held the Eagles to a field goal.\nUltimately, this didn't matter considering how poor the Saints played overall. ...\nKeenan Lewis must not be healthy yet. Once again he only received a smattering of snaps while Brandon Browner, Delvin Breaux and Damian Swann opened up at cornerback. We also saw Kyle Wilson playing safety at times in place of Jairus Byrd .\nIt honestly probably wouldn't matter who played on the back end. The pass rush was nonexistent against a beleaguered Eagles offensive line. I can count on one hand how many pressures the Saints had on Bradford. ...\nThe Saints' offensive line had no answer for Cox, by the way. The guy dominated just about anyone with a pulse on the Saints' front five. The Eagles defensive end beat the Saints around the edges and up the gut for with six tackles, three of them coming on sacks and two forced fumbles. ...\nFirst-round pick tackle Andrus Peat made his starting debut on place of the injured Terron Armstead. It didn't go so well.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/search?q=%23DrewBrees"], "published": "2015-10-11T23:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:08:09.952+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
