He rushed for 11 yards on 21 carries against the Atlanta Falcons and Dallas Cowboys. He watched replacement Ryan Mathews rush for 108 yards on 25 carries against the Jets. Mathews' first carry went for 27 yards - more than Murray's yardage total for the season.\n\"I thought [the offensive line was] able to get some creases going, they were able to block it,\" Murray said. \"[The running backs] were able to run it under the center even more, and I thought Ryan and [Darren Sproles] did a good job running through some good trash and made some good reads.\" \nThe Eagles ran from under center on four of 15 rushes when Murray last played, against Dallas. They rushed from under center on 13 of 36 handoffs on Sunday, including Mathews' 27-yard gain. \nMathews said after the game he prefers it when the quarterback is under center. LeSean McCoy said the same thing last year. Murray did not state a preference. \n\"I've done both, and I've had success both in underneath and in the gun,\" Murray said. \"I know the type of player I am and what I'm capable of doing.\" \nWhen Murray rushed for 1,845 yards last season in Dallas, the quarterback was mostly under center. Murray pointed out that it was a different offensive system. \nThe problem in the first two weeks was not as much where the quarterback lined up, but how the line blocked. Murray said he noticed better blocking against the Jets. He credited Mathews and the offensive line. \n\"I think we need to continue to create more opportunities,\" Murray said. \"The first two games didn't go accordingly for anyone, but I think we can learn from the mistakes we all made.\" \nWhen coach Chip Kelly was asked earlier in the week if Mathews deserves the majority of the carries, Kelly said the coaching staff is not concerned and needs to see the health of the players entering Sunday's game. He said Murray \"fits in perfectly\" with the Eagles. \nOn Thursday, Kelly said Murray wants to play Sunday because he's a \"highly competitive player\" - not to try to compensate for the way he played in the first two games. \nMurray has not had more than 13 carries in a game this season. If Mathews and Sproles maintain a presence in the running game, there might not be a significant number of carries for each running back. Murray said it would be helpful to develop a rhythm on the field but also understood what he signed up for, too. \n\"I feel like anyone feels like they need to get lathered up, so to speak, to get comfortable back there,\" Murray said. \"I don't know the exact number, but I know there's a lot of guys to touch the ball in this offense. I knew it when I came here, I know it now.\" \nMathews said he's \"just here to help\" and he does not know what his workload will be on Sunday. \n\"More, less - as long as we're winning,\" Mathews said. \nThe running game could be the focal point of the offense Sunday if the game remains in Landover, Md. With rain and wind expected in the region, the sloppy conditions could keep both offenses on the ground. In that case, the Eagles will need better production from Murray - if he plays. \n\"As a running back, you kind of look forward to those games because you get a lot of carries,\" Murray said. \"I'm sure we'll be able to weather the storm.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:04:11.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
