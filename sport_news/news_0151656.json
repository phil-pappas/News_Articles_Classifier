(AP) — Hundreds were rescued from fast-moving floodwaters Sunday in South Carolina as days of driving rain hit a dangerous crescendo that buckled buildings and roads, closed a major East Coast interstate route and threatened the drinking water supply for the capital city. \nThe powerful rainstorm dumped more than a foot of rain overnight on Columbia, swamping hundreds of businesses and homes. Emergency workers waded into waist-deep water to help people trapped in cars, dozens of boats fanned out to rescue others in flooded neighborhoods and some were plucked from rooftops by helicopters. \nWith so much water, officials said it could take weeks or even months to assess every road and bridge that's been closed around the state. Several interstates around Columbia were closed, and so was a 75-mile stretch of Interstate 95 that is a key route connecting Miami to Washington, D.C. and New York. \n\"This is different than a hurricane because it is water, it is slow moving and it is sitting. We can't just move the water out,\" Gov. Nikki Haley said at a news conference. \nOne death was reported in the area on Sunday, bringing weather-related deaths to seven since the storm began days earlier. The system drenching South Carolina was part of an unusual combination of weather conditions involving a slow-crawling low pressure system meteorologists called unusually deep for this time of year. \n--- \n10 Things to Know for Monday \nYour daily look at late-breaking news, upcoming events and the stories that will be talked about Monday: \n1. TORRENTIAL RAIN SWAMPS HUNDREDS OF SOUTH CAROLINA HOMES, BUSINESSES \nEmergency crews rescue scores of people from flooded buildings in Columbia, S.C., hit by over 18 inches of precipitation in the last few days. \n--- \nDoctors Without Borders leaves Afghan city after deadly airstrike as death toll rises to 22 \nKABUL, Afghanistan (AP) — The U.S. and Afghan governments vowed Sunday to jointly investigate the attack on a hospital in Kunduz that killed 22 people, as street-by street battles continued between government forces and Taliban fighters and officials warned of a looming humanitarian crisis for civilians trapped in the city \nAmid accusations that U.S. jet fighters were responsible for what Doctors Without Borders said was a \"sustained bombing\" of their trauma center in Kunduz, President Barack Obama and Afghanistan's President Ashraf Ghani promised investigations. Obama said he expected a full accounting of the circumstances surrounding the bombing, and that he would wait for those results before making a judgment. He said the U.S. would continue working with Afghanistan's government and its overseas partners to promote security in Afghanistan. \nSome top U.S. officials said the circumstances surrounding the incident remain murky, but others indicated the U.S. may have been responsible. Army Col. Brian Tribus, a spokesman for American forces in Afghanistan, said Saturday that a U.S. airstrike \"in the Kunduz vicinity\" around 2:15 a.m. Saturday morning \"may have resulted in collateral damage to a nearby medical facility.\" \nU.S. officials speaking on condition of anonymity said American special operations forces advising Afghan commandos in the vicinity of the hospital requested the air support when they came under fire in Kunduz. The officials said the AC-130 gunship responded and fired on the area, but U.S. Secretary of Defense Ash Carter said it's not certain yet whether that was what destroyed the hospital. \nThe officials were not authorized to discuss the incident publicly. They also said the senior U.S. military investigator is in Kunduz but hasn't yet been able to get to the site because it continues to be a contested area between the Afghans and the Taliban militants. \n--- \nChaffetz has made congressional career confronting establishment, harnessing social media \nWASHINGTON (AP) — One-time college placekicker Jason Chaffetz wants to boot Republican House leaders off their path to promotions. \nChaffetz declared Sunday that he's running to replace retiring House Speaker John Boehner, even though Boehner has chosen Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy as his successor, and upend the would-be GOP leadership slate. \nIt's not a new role for Chaffetz. The 48-year-old chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee has never been shy about seeking leading roles in politics. He's climbed the power ladder through a mix of media savvy and confrontations with some establishment favorites. And despite having strong family roots in Democratic politics — his father was the Utah co-chairman for Michael Dukakis' presidential campaign in 1988 and was once married to Dukakis' wife, Kitty — Chaffetz entered Congress in 2009 ideologically aligned with the tea party-tinged class that propelled the GOP into the House majority two years later. \nIt's far from clear that Chaffetz will win enough support in the House's complex selection process. Within moments of his announcement, Republicans friendly to McCarthy raised questions about his fitness for the post. But Chaffetz insists that the biggest House majority in decades needs an overhaul at the top, and that he's being called to lead it. \n\"I've had enough members who've come and said, 'Please Jason, do this,'\" Chaffetz said on Fox News Sunday. \"'We don't want to fight internally. But realistically, we can't vote to promote the existing leadership.'\" \n--- \nSpike in Palestinian attacks and rising tensions stoke fears of another Intifada \nJERUSALEM (AP) — A series of grisly Palestinian attacks that killed several Israeli civilians has prompted the government to take unprecedented security measures amid growing public debate over whether the specter of another Palestinian Intifada, or uprising, is on the horizon. \nIsrael's prime minister vowed a \"harsh offensive\" to counter rising violence that has focused in recent weeks over Jerusalem's most sensitive holy site sacred to both Muslims and Jews, in a series of so-called \"lone wolf\" Palestinian attacks against Israelis. On Sunday, Israel announced that Palestinians would be temporarily barred from Jerusalem's Old City, the first time Israel has taken this step since it captured the Old City in the 1967 Mideast War. \nThe latest spike in violence comes at a time when many Palestinians no longer believe statehood through negotiations with Israel is possible. Israeli commentators have raised the possibility of a third uprising, though Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has so far prevented major outbreaks of violence despite his growing friction with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \nIsrael's leading newspaper commentator, Nahum Barnea, called the recent violence the \"Third Intifada,\" referring to Palestinian uprisings in the 1980s and the early 2000s. \"Not calling it by name allows the political and military establishment to evade, repress, shirk responsibility,\" he wrote in the Yediot Ahronot newspaper. \nBut Hani al-Masri, a Palestinian political analyst, said it was not likely the start of a new uprising. \"Intifada needs a leadership and the Palestinian political leadership is against it,\" he said. \n--- \nHope fades for finding survivors in mound left by Guatemala mudslide that killed at least 131 \nSANTA CATARINA PINULA, Guatemala (AP) — Hope faded Sunday for finding any survivors of a mudslide that killed at least 131 people as the smell of rotting bodies spread across the enormous mound of earth and rescuers reported the buried dwellings they reached were filled with water, suggesting anyone trapped inside would have drowned. \nRescue workers on Sunday pulled more corpses from the mound created when a hillside collapsed and covered about 4 acres (1.7 hectares) with mud and dirt as deep as 15 yards (meters). \nJulio Sanchez, spokesman for Guatemala's volunteer firefighters, said 131 bodies had been pulled from the mud. \nAt an improvised morgue, 82 bodies have been identified and handed over to relatives, said municipal medical examiner Dr. Carlos Augusto Rodas Gonzalez. However, other bodies, some of which were found in pieces, remain unidentified. \nThe grim list of the dead who have been identified included at least 26 children and teenagers. \n--- \nIn classroom terror, survivors played dead, prayed for survival in merciless shooting rampage \nROSEBURG, Ore. (AP) — The gunman had already shot several students at close range when he stood inches from Lacey Scroggins and demanded she stand up. \nIt was only the fourth day of community college for the 18-year-old aspiring surgeon. She was face down, her head tucked between her outstretched arms, among dead and dying classmates. \nScroggins could hear someone gurgling. She felt the weight of mortally wounded Treven Anspach against her, the 20-year-old's blood flowing onto her clothing. \nShe prayed and played dead, frozen to the floor. The killer stepped over her and shot someone else. \nIn a rampage lasting about 10 minutes, Christopher Harper-Mercer took nine lives Thursday morning in chilling fashion before killing himself as officers closed in, placing the small town of Roseburg among settings that have become infamous for inexplicable violence. \n--- \nUS search teams find debris, oil sheen in near last known position of cargo ship off Bahamas \nNASSAU, Bahamas (AP) — The search for a U.S. cargo ship that was lost during Hurricane Joaquin off the southeastern Bahamas turned up more clues Sunday but no word yet on the fate of the vessel or its 33-member crew. \nAircraft and ships taking part in the search located a container that appears to have come from the 790-foot El Faro, according to the owner of the vessel, while the Coast Guard said it has found a debris field that includes what appear to be pieces of container. They also spotted an oil sheen in the sea. \nThe latest finds follow the discovery of an orange life ring that was confirmed to have come from the El Faro a day earlier. Chief Petty Officer Bobby Nash said it was too early to come to any conclusion. \n\"We still don't have communication with the ship and we don't even know if the debris field is from the ship,\" said Nash, a Coast Guard spokesman. \nThe fourth-day of searching across a wide expanse of the Atlantic Ocean near Crooked Island was aided by the first day of calmer weather now that Joaquin has left the Bahamas and was en route to Bermuda. Two Coast Guard cutters, the Northland and Resolute, were expected to continue searching overnight Sunday as the aircraft returned to their bases. \n--- \nAP Top 25 shake-up: Florida, Utah, Clemson rise; Georgia, UCLA fall, but Ohio State still 1 \nOhio State remained No. 1 in The Associated Press college football Top 25 and tied a poll record on Sunday, despite lagging support from the voters. \nMeanwhile, No. 2 TCU and No. 3 Baylor edged forward, No. 4 Michigan State slipped and No. 5 Utah and No. 6 Clemson took big jumps. \nAfter four top-10 teams lost on Saturday, the rankings were rattled and five teams received first-place votes. The Buckeyes received 38 first-place votes, their fewest this season after beginning as the first unanimous preseason No. 1. TCU has five first-place votes, Baylor received 10, Utah has seven and No. 9 Texas A&M has one. \nOhio State was the only team in the top 16 to have the same ranking this week as last. \nThe Buckeyes held off Indiana 34-27 on Saturday and have now been top-ranked 101 times, matching Oklahoma for the most in the 79-year history of the media poll.
