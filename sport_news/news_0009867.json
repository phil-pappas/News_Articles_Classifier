As a result, Utah dropped in the national rankings that were released Sunday. \nUtah dropped to No. 13 in the Associated Press Top 25 Poll and to No. 14 in the Amway USA Today Coaches Poll . Utah was previously No. 3 in the AP Poll and No. 7 in the Coaches Poll. \nAs a No. 3-ranked team they had received 16 first-place votes and were second only to No. 1 Ohio State in terms of votes. After Saturday's loss, Utah is no longer receiving first-place votes, as would be expected. \nUtah also dropped to No. 13 in the FWAA-NFF Super 16 Rankings and to No. 14 in the ESPN power rankings. Utah was previously ranked No. 4 in the FWAA-NFF rankings and No. 3 in the ESPN power rankings. \nUtah is still one of three Pac-12 teams ranked in both polls with Stanford the highest-ranked team in the conference at No. 8. The Cardinal are followed by Utah (No. 13/14) and UCLA (No. 24/25). Cal dropped out of the rankings after losing 40-24 to UCLA. Four teams from the Pac-12 received votes this week, including Cal, USC, Oregon and Washington State. \nOhio State remains the No. 1 team after a convincing win over Rutgers. The Buckeyes received 39 first-place votes and looked more like the No. 1 team behind quarterback JT Barrett. The Buckeyes are followed by Baylor, Clemson, LSU, and TCU in the AP Poll.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:06:21.567+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
