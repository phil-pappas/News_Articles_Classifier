Pleasant News \nELDON â€” The New London football team helped keep its playoff hopes alive on Friday night at Cardinal. The Tigers broke a scoreless tie in the second quarter and racked up seven touchdowns over the last three quarters to run away from the Comets in a 49-14 victory. \nAustin McBeth racked up five touchdowns in the game. The first two came early in the second quarter and were both four-yard runs. The Comets cut the Tiger lead in half with a touchdown pass late in the second quarter, and New London went to the break with a 14-7 lead. \nA 16-yard score by McBeth gave the Tigers some breathing room early in the third quarter, and then a 31-yard pass from Blake Nehring to Jayden Flowers broke it open at 28-7. \nAlready leading by three touchdowns in the fourth quarter, McBeth scored on a 42-yard run to push the lead to 35-7. Tyler Stevenson scored on a 26-yard run a few minutes later, and after a Cardinal score made it 42-14, McBeth tacked on one more touchdown with a 53-yard rush to end the scoring. \nMcBeth finished the game with 157 yards on the ground on 14 attempts to go along with his five scores. He also caught three passes for 39 yards. Stevenson went for 93 yards and a score in his seven attempts, and also caught four passes for 37 yards. Keontae Luckett and Flowers each had four carries. Luckett went for 48 yards and Flowers ran for 34. \nNehring went 13-18 passing with one touchdown and one interception. Flowers was his leading receiver, with four catches for 51 yards and a touchdown. Flowers also made all seven of his extra-point attempts. \nColton Francis led the team in tackles, with eight. McBeth finished with 7.5 tackles, Helmerson had seven, Reno Chiri and Tyler Mttler had six, and Stevenson finished with 5.5. \nThe Tigers moved to 4-4 overall with the win and 3-3 in the district. With one game remaining, New London could still make the playoffs in a variety of ways. A win over Lone Tree (5-3, 4-2) and a WACO loss to Danville would get them in automatically.
