After Sunday night’s preseason finale, Trotz said Collins wouldn’t “wow you as a sexy player or anything like that,” but was a pleasant surprise because of his consistency. \nCollins found out that night he’d make the opening day roster, and when Trotz was asked about Collins two days later, his descriptions got more colorful. \n“It’s the consistency factor, the getting the job done,” Trotz said. “He’s not a Ferrari; he’s one of those useful pickup trucks that get the job done. He’d probably do a commercial for a truck company. \n“That’s what he is. He’s the guy that than pick up a lot of stuff that some of those other guys can’t do and that’s really important to have.” \nEarlier in training camp, Trotz called Collins “the perfect 13th forward.” The 26-year-old, a former seventh-round draft pick of the Columbus Blue Jackets, has 19 games of NHL experience across three seasons, but he signed with Washington hoping he could land a spot on the roster. His play on the penalty kill unit, his experience playing both center and wing and his consistency all have him likely to be on the fourth line beside Michael Latta and Brooks Laich in Saturday’s season opener. \n“He does a lot of does detail things that we know Joel Ward used to do here for many years that probably didn’t get noticed a lot until we started watching real closely,” Trotz said Sunday. “So I’m real happy with Sean’s camp.” \nCollins learned he’d be sticking around shortly after Trotz said that to reporters. He had allowed himself to consider making the roster was a real possibility Oct. 1, when he played in an exhibition game at Carolina. The preseason game before that, he had scored a goal against the New York Islanders, further bolstering his case. As a January call-up in Columbus last season, Collins appeared in only eight games, notching two assists during a five-game road trip. \nHow long Collins will be with the Capitals is unclear, though he would have to clear waivers to be reassigned to Hershey. With top-line center Nicklas Backstrom (hip) out for potentially the first four or five games of the regular season and Chris Brown (hand) out for two to six weeks, Washington is carrying extra forwards. To have the 22-man active roster the Capitals desire, two forwards – likely some combination of Galiev, Brown and Collins – will be in Hershey when everyone’s healthy. \nCollins has no problem being compared to a pickup truck if that’s what keeps him in Washington. \n“Going back to my days in college, it’s kind of how I stayed in the lineup,” Collins said. “A young guy coming from an almost unknown junior league, I was an offensive player, but they had older guys to fill those roles. So just to stay in the lineup, I had to be responsible for my own end, good on the walls, good on the faceoff circle when I was playing up the middle. \n“Those kind of things really helped me stay in the lineup when I was in college. I’ve just continued to work on them and continued to develop them in the pro level.” Isabelle Khurshudyan covers the Washington Capitals.
