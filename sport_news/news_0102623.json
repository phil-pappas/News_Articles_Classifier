Unfortunately, none of it has translated into much goal production — 13 in seven games for the Kings, six of those by Tyler Toffoli, who has the same number as the entire Ducks team through four games. For both teams, the prime culprit is shooting percentage. The Ducks, despite creating the fourth most scoring chances per 60 minutes in the league, also own the league’s worst shooting eye at 2.78%, according to puckalytics.com. And they just took over ownership of that dubious category from the Kings who, thanks to Friday night’s three-goal explosion against Carolina, have risen to fourth worst at 3.92%, while still leading the NHL in Corsi scoring chances per 60 minutes.\nWe mention all of this a) as a reminder that it’s early; b) as a warning not to unload your underachieving Hollywood stars just yet, and c) suggest there could be a few under-the-radar skaters available on the waiver wire or through a trade who are better than their surface stats. One name that jumps out, at the moment, is Dustin Brown. The Kings captain has not been a fantasy factor for a few years, bottoming out last season with 11-16-27 totals and a minus-17. Even his 26 PIMs were a career-low for an 82-game schedule. And through seven games this month, Brown has done nothing to alter his fantasy stock with just two assists and a minus-1. However, as blogger Jason Lewis points out on hockeybuzz.com, Brown’s enhanced stats — shot generation, carrying the puck into the offensive zone — show he is actually becoming more involved in the Kings attack, though he doesn’t have the goals or assists to show for it. Brown’s elite puck possession figures have resulted in 25 shots on goal (an early, but career-high, 3.6 per game) and, eventually, some of those shots are going to go in. Brown, meanwhile, also passes the eye-ball test. As Lewis notes, he appears to be in better shape and, having moved up on to the top line with Anze Kopitar and Marian Gaborik in the season’s third game, the opportunity is there to reclaim some of his old scoring magic. Keep an eye on him.\n— Nicklas Backstrom returned to the Capitals lineup last weekend following off-season hip surgery and promptly racked up four goals and seven points in four games. The odd thing about this, however, is that Backstrom has not been skating with Alex Ovechkin, except on the power play. Instead, Backstrom has been between Marcus Johansson and Justin Williams while Ovie has Evgeny Kuznetsov and T.J. Oshie as his linemates. This clearly is an example of where breaking up a team’s top line to spread the scoring wealth has worked out as planned as the Caps are the highest-scoring team in the NHL at the moment.\n— One that hasn’t worked out: The Ducks have split up Corey Perry and Ryan Getzlaf for a second time.\n— Radim Vrbata is back on the the Canucks’ top line. Seems that while Brandon Sutter was flourishing early on alongside the Sedins (five points in six games), it wasn’t rubbing off on the twins, who had just six points between them in that same span before Thursday’s shakeup.\n— For his debut game as Blue Jackets head coach on Thursday, John Tortorella kept the lines intact. But not having scored since late in the first period, he replaced Ryan Johansen on the first line with Brandon Dubinsky to start the third. Johansen worked between Matt Calvert and Boone Jenner but had only four shifts in the final period. Whether this was just one of those in-game adjustments, or a sign of a larger shakeup, we’ll have to see. But Johansen owners have to be a little nervous.\n— Mats Zuccarello of the Rangers has hit the post three times already this season.\nHOT AND NOT (Forwards the first three weeks)\nDavid Krejci BOS\n5-7-12, 6 PP\nEvgeny Kuznetsov WAS\n3-8-11, plus-5, 10 PIMs\nTomas Plekanec MON\n5-4-9, plus-10\nMartin Hanzal ARZ\n0-9-9, plus-4, 8 PIMs\nArtemi Panarin CHI\n2-6-8, plus-4\n- - - - - - - -\nRyan Getzlaf ANA\n0-1-1, minus-3\nJakub Voracek PHIL\n0-3-3, minus-2\nDavid Backes STL\n0-2-2, minus-2\nPatric Hornqvist PIT\n0-1-1, minus-4\nGAMES THIS WEEK\n4 — CGY\n2 — LA, NAS, SJ\n1 — NYR\n(All other teams play three games)\nTHOSE OTHER STATS: SHOOTING PCT.

More comfortable in Mike Babcock’s forecheck and get-it-to-the-net style, Komarov is also a solid contributor in the hits category and chips in with a handful of PIMs as well.\nConnor Brickley C, Panthers *\nKomarov-lite? Second-rounder in 2010 is playing just fourth-line minutes, but sure makes things happen when he’s out there: A goal and two assists in six games, a plus-3 and five minors. A top six-role may be a ways off, but if you need a penalty guy without all the negative side-effects, he’s someone to monitor.\nFrancois Beauchemin D, Avalanche * * *\nUsually one of those D-men you grab to keep your plus-minus figures in check, the veteran likely won’t match those numbers now that he’s left the Ducks, but he’s making up for it by producing five assists in six games and seems like a decent bet to hit 30 points for the first time in a decade.\nINJURY UPDATES\nPaul Stastny is out with a broken foot sustained on Friday ...
