The second-year receiver spent three weeks getting counseling in Houston at a facility operated by former NBA player and coach John Lucas. \nBryant says he learned from his mistakes and has a better understanding on how to avoid them in the future. \nThe Steelers (2-2) have a week to get ready for a trip to San Diego. Bryant's presence should help an offense that had trouble getting downfield against the Ravens. Bryant averaged 21 yards a catch during his rookie season, scoring eight touchdowns in 10 games. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:34:39.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
