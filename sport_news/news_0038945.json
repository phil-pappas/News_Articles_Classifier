Sponsored by Bills 14, Titans 13 Oct. 11, Nissan Stadium, Nashville, Tenn. This was a laughable performance for the Bills for most of the game, but luckily, Tyrod Taylor came to the rescue. Taylor engineered two late scoring drives with the help of his running prowess and a 46-yard bomb to Chris Hogan to give Buffalo its first victory over the Titans since 2000. An ugly win if there ever was one, but a win nonetheless. Up next, the undefeated Bengals. Giants 24, Bills 10 Oct. 4, Ralph Wilson Stadium Flags, flags and more flags. The Bills couldn't stay out of trouble against Eli Manning and the Giants and sunk to .500 in defeat. Without stars LeSean McCoy and Sammy Watkins -- both sidelined with injuries -- the Bills' offense was mostly lifeless. Buffalo ran for just 55 yards (2.3 average) on 24 attempts. Bills 41, Dolphins 14 Sept. 27, Sun Life Stadium Tyrod Taylor played like a seasoned veteran, Buffalo's defense looked like the one Rex Ryan has been bragging about, and the Miami Dolphins were, well, an absolute train wreck. Add it up and the Bills embarrassed their AFC East rivals 41-14 at muggy Sun Life Stadium. Patriots 40, Bills 32 Sept. 20, Ralph Wilson Stadium The Ralph was rockin'. Then it wasn't. Then it was again. But in the end, the Patriots did what they always seem to do ... beat the Bills. Tom Brady threw for 466 yards and 3 TDs as New England dominated much of the game before allowing three fourth-quarter scores to make things interesting. Alas, on the Bills' final drive, Tyrod Taylor threw his third interception to end hopes of a miraculous comeback. Despite a lot of talk all week, the Pats proved they are still tops in the division. Bills 27, Colts 14 Sept. 13, Ralph Wilson Stadium They say it's not how you start, but how you finish. Well, \"they\" would still be quite impressed with what the Bills did in Week 1 against Andrew Luck and the Colts. Buffalo put on a show and QB Tyrod Taylor made his coaches look smart with an efficient stat line and an impressive 51-yard TD bomb to Percy Harvin to ignite the crowd. After the Bills scored on their opening drive of the second half to open up a 24-0 lead, the party was on. What's next for the Bills? Scroll ahead to look at the rest of the Bills schedule this season. Week 6 Oct. 18, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium Cincinnati is the only postseason qualifier the Bills will face between Week 3 and Week 10. The other six clubs (Miami twice) had a combined record of 23-57. Week 7 Oct. 25, 9:30 a.m. Wembley Stadium, London (Insert corny English phrase in a terrible accent.) Luckily for the Bills, they aren't the \"home\" team for this one. The Jags are regulars in England, committing to a game each year at Wembley from 2013 to 2016. Week 8 Nov. 8, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium Coming off the bye, this is the first of three key AFC East games in a row for Buffalo. The Bills have defeated the Dolphins three straight years at home and will look to extend it to four for the first time in the series' history. Week 10 Nov. 12, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday night) Met Life Stadium The Bills visit Rex Ryan's former home in their first of two primtetime games this season. They also begin a stretch of five games on the road in six weeks -- something they haven't done since 1991. Week 11 Nov. 23, 8:30 p.m. (Monday night) Gillette Stadium The Bills finally won in Foxborough last season -- the first time in 13 tries -- in the final game of the year. This game will be a Monday nighter and not since 2009 have the Bills played two prime-time games in one season. Week 12 Nov. 29, 1 p.m. Arrowhead Stadium After the Patriots game, the Bills have to turn around on short rest and travel to Kansas City. That's just as tough a task as playing a team coming off extra rest. The NFL did the Bills no favors with that one. Week 13 Dec. 6, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium J.J. Watt, arguably the best defensive player in the NFL, has a new buddy in Houston and someone with which the Bills are quite familiar. Former Patriot Vince Wilfork joined the team this offseason, signing a two-year contract. Houston defeated Buffalo, 23-17, last season. Week 14 Dec. 13, 1 p.m. Lincoln Financial Field Of course Rex returning to Met Life is a big deal. But another new Bill has this one circled on his calendar. Running back LeSean McCoy was traded to the Bills for young linebacker Kiko Alonso in the offseason and most likely wants to put on a good show for his former fans. Week 15 Dec. 20, 1 p.m. FedExField The Bills have struggled mightily in recent years, but they have had Washington's number. The Bills are 6-0 against the Redskins since 1993. Week 16 Dec. 27, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium Tony Romo is clearly among one of the better QBs the Bills face in 2015. Interestingly, Buffalo is at home in most cases where it faces an elite (or near-elite) quarterback (Brady, Romo, Luck, Manning). Week 17 Jan. 3, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium A fitting end to the season with Rex Ryan hosting his former team at the Ralph. In the 55 years the Bills have been playing in the AFL and NFL, they have never played a slate where they start with two games at home and finish with their last two at home.

There was no sign of a limp, and all of his body parts seemed to be in functioning order, particularly that smile he wore on his face as he slipped on his sport coat amidst the near emptiness of the Buffalo locker room. \n\"I'm doing good, nothing major, so I'm ready to roll,\" Tyrod Taylor said. \nThere is no telling how much longer Taylor can play the way he did Sunday because in the NFL, quarterbacks who run out of the pocket and down the field with reckless abandon as often as he did typically don't last too long. But for as long as he can, it sure is a sight to behold. \nOn a day when their injury-ravaged offense was about as awful as it could possibly be, the Bills pulled out a hard-to-believe 14-13 victory over the Tennessee Titans because Taylor did things that no Bills quarterback has ever done, not even Doug Flutie. Tyrod Taylor's late heroics bail out Bills \nIn rushing for a quarterback team-record 76 yards, Taylor rallied the Bills from a 10-0 deficit by making two plays that will forever be etched on this season's highlight reel. The first was his dazzling 22-yard touchdown run to get the Bills back into the game in the third quarter. And then there was his 24-yard scamper to convert a near-impossible third-and-23 in the fourth quarter that keyed a drive that ended with him throwing a game-winning two-yard touchdown pass to Chris Hogan on third and goal. \n\"He willed us, man,\" said running back Boobie Dixon. “He made a couple really good plays that saved the game for us. He's a heck of a player and a great leader and we expect those things from him.” Eric Wood, Bills center \nThat he did, because without Taylor's improvisational running and scrambling, the Bills would never have won this game against an improving, but certainly not ready-for-prime-time Tennessee team. \n\"He made a couple really good plays that saved the game for us,\" said center Eric Wood. \"He's a heck of a player and a great leader and we expect those things from him.\" \nFor as dynamic as Taylor can be in the open field, he's just as laconic in his post-game press conferences. He doesn't say much of anything that would interest anyone, the classic example of a guy who lets his play speak for him. \n\"He's not a real rah-rah guy or a loud speaker,\" said Percy Harvin. \"He gets us up in the huddle and gives us confidence that way, but he's not a big rally the whole team guy.\" \nPoll: Is Tyrod Taylor the Bills' long-term answer at QB? \nThroughout two and half quarters, though, Taylor's play spoke nothing, and it was making Bills fans scream in aggravation because he couldn't get anything going. The Bills had four first downs and 51 yards of offense in the first half, and when newcomer Denarius Moore fumbled a punt early in the third quarter to set up a short touchdown run by Tennessee's Antonio Andrews, the Bills were in what looked like an insurmountable 10-0 hole. \nAnd then Taylor went to work. Over the next nine plays, the Bills matched their first-half first down total as Taylor ripped off a 26-yard scramble up the middle, and followed that with a designed rollout run that ended with him tip-toeing along the sideline and into the end zone. \n\"There were two plays called in the huddle and we got up and they gave us the look we wanted and I was able to make a play,\" said Taylor. \"There was a bunch of great blocking on that play.\" — NFL (@NFL) October 11, 2015 \nBut that was only the beginning of the heroics. After the Titans put together a 72-yard drive that ended with a Ryan Succop field goal, Taylor took it to a new level and almost single-handedly won the game. \n\"The quarterback has the biggest heart,\" said coach Rex Ryan. \"Man, it was tough sledding, but he has guts. He wasn't playing great, but at the end of the day, he's the reason we won.\" \nHere's why. After back-to-back penalties on Seantrel Henderson, the Bills were in a third-and-23 hole at their own 7. As you know, the odds of converting that are about slim and slimmer. However, Taylor bought time in the pocket and when nothing was available, he took off up the middle and weaved his way just past the first-down marker, a 24-yard gain that became 39 when Tennessee's Zach Brown horse-collared him for a personal foul. \n\"He busted it wide open with his legs and teams have to respect that,\" said guard Richie Incognito. \"That one where he took off and then got the personal foul, they were playing two-man (two deep safeties) and that thing just opened up. He had the presence to take off and hurt them up the middle. It was a game-changing play for us.\" Bills cornerback Stephon Gilmore (24) celebrates after an interception sealed the win in Nashville.
