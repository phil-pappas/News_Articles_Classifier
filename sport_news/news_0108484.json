(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) more > By DOUG FERGUSON   \nNAPA, Calif. (AP) - The HSBC Champions made a significant change to its criteria this year, which was good news for Daniel Summerhays, Justin Thomas and Matt Jones. \nThe World Golf Championship in Shanghai previously placed an emphasis on winning tournaments, taking 20 winners from PGA Tour events (based on the strength of the field) and 10 winners from the European Tour, along with winners from the other tours. The final category was the top 50 in the world ranking. \nThis year, the world ranking was moved up to No. 3 in the order of criteria. That was followed by the top 30 from the FedEx Cup, with a caveat. At least five players had to come from the FedEx Cup list, even if that meant going beyond 30th place. \nOnly two players who made it to the Tour Championship - Steven Bowditch and Harris English - were not in the top 50 in the world. Summerhays (31), Thomas (32) and Jones (33) were next in line and are headed to Sheshan International to play for a $9.5 million purse with a big ranking in points. \nIan Poulter, meanwhile, slipped out of the top 50 at the Monday cutoff, bumped out by Andy Sullivan and Emiliano Grillo winning. Poulter narrowly finished behind Hunter Mahan, who made the cut at the Frys.com Open and then shot 67-72 to tie for 32nd. \nIt will be the first WGC event for Summerhays and Thomas. \n___ \nBUCCANEER MCILROY? And to think Rory McIlroy was nearly a Buccaneer. \nThere was a time when McIlroy contemplated coming to America for college. Graeme McDowell went to Alabama-Birmingham. Colin Montgomerie was at Houston Baptist. Adam Scott spent one semester at UNLV (though it is believed he never did find the library). \nMcIlroy was lined up to play for the Buccaneers of East Tennessee State. \n“I signed a letter-of-intent to play for ETSU, did my SAT, did everything like that, so I was fully ready to come over and play college golf,” McIlroy said last week at the Frys.com Open. “But at that point, I knew that I really wanted to turn pro earlier. I had no intention of graduating at all, so I thought it was just better to play amateur golf.” \nIt worked out for him. He played in the Walker Cup, turned pro and effectively wrapped up his European Tour card in his second start as a pro. \n“By the time I was probably just getting out of college, I had just won my first major,” he said. “It was a good decision in the end.” \nMcIlroy didn’t mention who else recruited him out of Northern Ireland. \n“I wasn’t that good back then,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T04:49:22.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
