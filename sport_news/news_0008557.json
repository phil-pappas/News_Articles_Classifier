Pool B brought together Ljubljana of Slovenia, Santos of Brazil and Denver of the United States, while in Pool C are Trbovlje of Slovenia, Kolobrzeg of Poland and New York Harlem of USA. \nTeams in the same group play each other with the top two moving to the knockout quarterfinals. The last four advance to the semifinals where the winners dispute the title. \nNovi Sad ruled the 2014 World Tour in Sendai, Japan where it defeated Saskatoon of Canada in the final. Manila West, which defeated Doha in the Manila Masters final, finished fiftn behind Kranj and Bucharest. \nWith Abueva are Aces teammate Vic Manuel, who made a last-minute decision to join the team, Mahindra’s Karl Dehesa and Talk ‘N Text rookie Troy Rosario. \n“Laban lang kami para sa bayan,” vowed Abueva. “Basta kami, ibibigay namin lahat ng makakaya para sa Pilipinas.” Abueva etched his name in the history books of FIBA 3×3 basketball last year by making a dramatic comeback from the hospital where he had earlier brought his wife who was about to give birth to their fourth son. \nWith undermanned Manila North trailing Xinzhuang in the quarters, Abueva burst into the Fashion Hall of SM Megamall, barricading his car at the venue’s entrance, and saved the day for his team to the deafening roar of the packed five-story balcony. \nManila North would lose to Doha in the semis, but the defeat was avenged in the final by Manila West with Romeo, KG Canaleta, Rey Guevarra and Aldrech Ramos. \nAbueva and Co. couldn’t be denied this time, however, as their strong second place finish qualified them to the World Tour and an anticipated rematch with Doha.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:26:13.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
