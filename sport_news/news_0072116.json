After the Highlanders threatened on their first drive, but turned it over on downs, they came back the next drive and Lucas completed a 15-yard touchdown pass to Bryton Belvin for the first points of the game. \nAfter a sloppy start from the offense on its first two drives, Astronaut changed quarterbacks and put Jordan Wojciechowski under center. On Wojciechowski’s first snap, he handed off to Javian Hawkins, who broke three tackles around the line of scrimmage before taking off for a 76-yard touchdown. \nOn the first Highlanders play following the Hawkins touchdown, Lucas completed a swing pass to Devyn Castor. Massengill sniffed it out and ran down Castor to force and recover a fumble, setting up a 39-yard field goal from Tristan Schultes. \n“Those plays completely changed the momentum of the game,” Massengill said. \nTristan Schultes converted a 39-yard field goal on that drive, and Massengill would make his presence felt again in the second half. \nLate in the third quarter Lucas dropped back to pass and Massengill read the play and dropped to block the pass, tipping it in the air as defensive lineman Harry Hampton dove on the ground to intercept it. \n“Don’t sleep on Harry now, Harry is an athlete,” Massengill said. “I saw the tackle step back and made a high-hat read. I saw (Lucas) long-arm the throw and they had been completing a lot of short stuff behind, so coach always says if I can’t get there get my hands up.” \nTaylor’s game-winning score would follow on the next drive. The Astronaut secondary that struggled early would come up big on a fourth-and-goal at the four as Jordan Taylor broke up Lucas’s throw to the end zone to get the ball back to the War Eagles, and then the War Eagles stopped the Highlanders again on a last second heave to the end zone from Lucas. \nAstronaut has a meeting with Class 4A, District 5 leader Cocoa next week, and Lake Highland Prep (5-2) meets Holy Trinity Episcopal (6-1). \nAstronaut 18, Lake Highland Prep 12 \nAstronaut 0 10 0 8 — 18 \nLake Highland Prep 6 0 6 0 — 12 \nHOW THEY SCORED \nLHP — Belvin 15 pass from Lucas (kick failed) - 3:38. \n2nd Quarter \nA — Hawkins 76 run (Schultes kick) - 6:29. \nA — Schultes 39 field goal - 6:29. \n3rd Quarter \nLHP — Sheikh 70 fumble return (run failed) - 7:39. \n4th Quarter \nA — Taylor 4 run (Schultes kick) - 10:56. \nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS \nRushing: A — Javian Hawkins 15-149 TD, Devell Taylor 6-35 TD, Brad Canarie 5-17, Jordan Wojciechowski 4-12, Cameron Ockerman 1-1, Leron Berry 1-1; LHP — Elijah Lucas 16-68, Nick Deese 3-6, Devyn Castor 11-51.
