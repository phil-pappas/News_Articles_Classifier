Kelly marked his 383rd day of living in space on Oct. 16, surpassing the previous record of 382 cumulative days, according to NASA. This isn't the only record the astronaut will break while on his journey. On Oct. 29, he will break the record for single longest spaceflight by an American astronaut with 216 consecutive days in space. Michael Lopez-Alegria, who spent 215 days in space in 2006, held the previous record. Kelly tweeted on Oct. 16, that \"records are meant to be broken.\" He noted that one of his colleagues will likely surpass his record when NASA sends astronauts to Mars. Kelly's year-long mission in space will end on March 3, 2016, \"by which time he will have compiled 522 total days living in space during four missions,\" NASA said in a statement. He has a twin brother (Mark). NASA will be examining both of them to see what happens to the human body in space over such a long time period.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:23:44.163+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
