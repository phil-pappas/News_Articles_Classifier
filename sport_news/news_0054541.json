We did it last year. We're glad we did. We'll take a hard look at all the free agent starters, and we'll have to balance our short-term interests, our long-term interests, our financial picture, and our roster and payroll strategy.\n\"I won't rule anything out. I won't rule anything in, except to say whether it's through trade or free agency, we would like to add at least one quality starting pitcher this winter.\"\nPrice, 30, was a four-time All-Star for Cubs manager Joe Maddon with the Rays. Zimmermann, 29, is from Wisconsin and has averaged 202 innings the last four seasons.\nPrice and Greinke easily could command contracts that dwarf Lester's deals, and the deep-pocket Dodgers are expected to push to re-sign Greinke.\nAdvancing to the National League Championship Series created a short-term spike in revenue. That success, combined with a thick core of young stars, likely will help the Cubs land a huge television deal after 2019 that would increase their revenue significantly to accommodate a big-ticket free agent like Price.\nPhotos of the players arriving and leaving Wrigley Field the day after the season ended.\n\"The 2016 payroll is not going to be as big as the 2020 payroll because of the (new) TV deal,\" Epstein said. \"But what the team accomplished this year should help. We'll have an aggressive mindset.\"\nSome of that pursuit in free agency, however, will be tempered because the Cubs have six arbitration-eligible pitchers, including 22-game winner Jake Arrieta.\nArrieta, 29, could come close to tripling his $3.63 million salary, and he's not eligible for free agency until after 2017. Epstein admitted that the projected raises among the arbitration players could put a \"big dent\" in their available dollars, but he at least will explore the possibility of discussing an extension with Arrieta and agent Scott Boras.\n\"We'd be foolish not to want to do that,'' Epstein said.\nThe Cubs also could adjust their sights and aim for a shorter deal with John Lackey, 37, a former Red Sox teammate of Lester and catcher David Ross who threw 218 innings in 2015. The Cardinals are expected to try to re-sign him.\nIf the Cubs can't re-sign switch-hitter Dexter Fowler (who could command a multi-year deal after making $9.5 million this year), they could look to Denard Span, who is coming off an injury-plagued 2015, to fill the leadoff and center field duties while Albert Almora receives more minor-league seasoning.\nmgonzales@tribpub.com\nTwitter @MDGonzales\nPrivacy Policy Major League Baseball Chicago Cubs Theo Epstein David Price Zack Greinke Free Agency Jordan Zimmermann", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56293c02/turbine/ct-wrigley-field-the-day-after-20151022", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56298f32/turbine/ct-free-agents-cubs-main-spt-1023-20151022"], "published": "2015-10-23T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:24:50.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
