MBA on offense first, Glenn Coleman under pressure and brought down by Daniel Monroe when you make a big play dab to celebrate.Now it's the Ryan Parker show.He is churning out some tough yards showing why the Irish want him.Back to Parker, he runs into the pile and bounces outside breaking lose and reaches for the pie line, but he is short.Give the man the ball again, he is stopped and shaken up on the ball, but he is alright.With Parker out, they try Kalvin Watson, but he is stuffed at the 1.Now Parker is back. I'm guessing they give it to him.Well, I'm wrong!They sneak it with Wil Austin for the touchdown.This one was back and forth, but MBA pulled away in the end taking it 35 to 21.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:37:55.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
