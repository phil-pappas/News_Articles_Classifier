We just kind of ran and figured we'd see what happened. But my eighth-grade year, we had a phenomenal race and everything started to click for us. I can still remember when they called our names for finishing second. We never thought that would even be possible.\" \nBut it has been possible for Annandale, again and again over the past few years. And the run does not seem to be showing any signs of ending. As the Section 5A meet — scheduled for Oct. 29 in Milaca — draws closer, the Cardinals find themselves ranked No. 1 in the state in the most recent Class A state poll. \nSchlafke, who finished sixth in the state as a freshman, fourth as a sophomore and ninth last year, leads the way. She is ranked No. 10 in the most recent Class A individual rankings. \n\"The thing about Elizabeth is that she is just so consistent,\" Annandale coach Scott Massmann said. \"She's just such a hard worker. She's not a person about whom you ever have to worry if she'll be ready for a race. She always is.\" Buy Photo \nAnnandale's Elizabeth Schlafke after a fourth-place finish at the state meet in 2013. (Photo: Bre McGee, Bre McGee, Special to the Times) \nSchlafke knows expectations have risen over the years, for both herself and her team. \n\"It's been cool to see how many people have started to recognize us, especially after we won our state title,\" Schlafke said. \"People don't usually recognize cross country runners. But that was a big thing around town. A lot of people really started to take notice. \n\"There's pressure because everyone sort of expects us to do well now. \"But we try not to worry about that and just focus on running the way we know we can run. Mr. Massmann is great about knowing when we might be feeling the pressure. And he'll get our minds off it. He just lets us know what we're doing well and what we can still work on.\" \nOf course, it takes more than one runner to achieve the kind of success the Cardinals have experienced in recent seasons. Massmann said developing depth has been a key factor in building the program. \n\"It's gone from 80 to 90 to 100 kids out for cross country in grades 7-12 — boys and girls,\" said Massmann, a Rocori High School graduate who is also the boys head coach. \n\"For a lot of these kids, the season will end at the conference meet coming up this Tuesday. But every year, a lot of them stick around and keep coming to practice even when they won't be running at meets anymore themselves. There's just a lot of dedication there.\" \nAnd Schlafke is hoping that dedication pays off in one more state title before her long and successful prep career draws to a close. \n\"My sophomore season (when the Cardinals won the state title) was my favorite year of high school so far,\" said Schlafke, who is looking at running at either Sioux Falls or Minnesota-Duluth next season. \"It was such a great experience to win down there. It was just so overwhelming and exciting. I really didn't even know how to process it at the time. \n\"My goal, and the goal for everybody on our team, is to experience that again. We'd love to get back there and win another state title. That would be the perfect ending to my senior season — to go out on top.\" \nFollow Frank Rajkowski on Twitter at @rajko1973 or like him on Facebook at www.facebook.com/sctimesfrank . 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.sctimes.com/story/sports/high-school/2015/10/18/schlafke-annandale-aiming-more/74076998/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:43:08.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
