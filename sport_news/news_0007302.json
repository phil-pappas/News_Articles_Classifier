That intense rivalry only adds spice to what promises to be an epic conclusion to a memorable event.” \nWhile acknowledging the threat from a Wallabies outfit markedly improved since Cheika was appointed coach last year, there was confidence the experienced New Zealanders would prevail. \n“The All Blacks are ready to pounce on the mouse which is roaring,” Rattue said. \n“Street fighter coach Michael Cheika has revived Australia, but the tournament was always going to stretch their power resources to breaking point.” \nNapier said New Zealand would fancy their chances of unsettling a Wallabies scrum which looked vulnerable against Argentina without prop Scott Sio. \n“Sio’s replacement was pinged three times by referee Wayne Barnes,” he said. “That equates to a major problem for Cheika, who will also be worried by defensive errors and ill discipline.” \nOther factors cited in New Zealand’s favour were the extra day they will have to recover before the final and their recent dominance over the Wallabies. \nThey have met 11 times since the All Blacks beat Australia in the 2011 World Cup semi-final, with the Wallabies managing only one win and two draws. \nTVNZ’s David Agnew said the All Blacks also had the powerful emotional incentive of wanting to send out veterans Richie McCaw, Dan Carter, Keven Mealamu, Conrad Smith and Ma’a Nonu on a high. \n“There’s some emotional petrol to be used up,” he said. \n“The end of the most successful All Blacks era ever is just waiting for the candles to be lit and it’ll be some swansong statement from some of the best the game will ever see.” \nNew Zealand scribes warned the main danger facing the All Blacks was Australian flanker David Pocock, who has been in scintillating form and is capable of single-handedly inspiring his team to victory. \n“The All Blacks are zooming in for the Cup. Pocock is the key man who can release that grip,” Rattue wrote.
