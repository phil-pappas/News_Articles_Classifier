Their bans arguably give both of them reputation problems in the 2016 race election to determine who will succeed Blatter. \nA tax exempt non-profit organization, FIFA presides over one of the world's most popular sports -- it generated Â£2 billion in revenue in 2014, partly helped by the success of the World Cup in Brazil. \n\"The proceedings against the South Korean football official Chung Mong-joon were opened in January 2015 based on findings in the report on the investigation into the bidding process for the 2018/2022 World Cup,\" said the FIFA Ethics Committee statement. \nBlatter, Platini, Valcke and Chung have 48 hours to appeal. \nThe FIFA Ethics Committee is another blow for the 79-year-old Blatter, who is facing a Swiss attorney general probe. \nThe Swiss authorities are looking into allegations believed to center on a 2005 TV rights deal between FIFA and Jack Warner, the former president of CONCACAF, the governing body of football in North and Central America and the Caribbean, as well as an alleged \"disloyal payment\" to Platini. \nBlatter's lawyers said the Ethics Committee had \"based its decision on a misunderstanding of the actions of the attorney general in Switzerland, which has opened an investigation but brought no charge against the President.\" \nThe world players' union -- FIFPro -- said the suspensions \"cast further doubt\" on the FIFA presidential election on February 26 in 2016. \n\"A pattern has emerged that leaves FIFPro with little or no confidence in the ability of FIFA to reform from within,\" said the statement from the world players' union. \n\"In addition, with senior officials, the 2018/2022 World Cup bidding process, and other issues still under investigation, FIFPro considers any decision regarding proposals to reform FIFA during this tumultuous period as lacking any credibility,\" added the FIFPro statement. \n\"Only a complete governance overhaul involving key stakeholders such as the players and clubs will be sufficient. The new reform Task Force announced by FIFA recently does not meet this criteria.\" \nNeither Platini or Chung were immediately available for comment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:08:50.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
