(AP) - A former diving coach at two central Pennsylvania high schools will spend up to seven years in prison for possessing child pornography and abusing a young girl, who was not on the diving teams. \nForty-three-year-old Patrick Fatta was sentenced Friday by a Lancaster County judge to two years, nine months to seven years in prison. \nFatta coached at West Hempfield High School for about four years and was also working at Manheim Township High School when he was charged last November. He was suspended then removed as coach at both schools. \nAdministrators say Fatta passed background checks before being hired. \nFatta pleaded guilty in July to felony child pornography charges and misdemeanor counts of molesting the girl, who was between 5 and 9 when the alleged abuse happened between 2009 and 2013. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:37:26.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
