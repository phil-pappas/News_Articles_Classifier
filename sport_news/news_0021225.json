Advertisement HBU men's soccer defeats ranked opponent for first time From   \nSophomore forward Marcelo Acuna’s goal nine seconds after Seattle tied the game at one gave HBU men’s soccer a lead they would not relinquish as the Huskies upset No. 19 Seattle, 3-1, Friday evening at Sorrels Field. The win was the first over a ranked opponent in program history. HBU had gone 0-3-0 in prior occasions. The win also snapped Seattle’s seven-game winning streak, while the three goals were the most the Redhawks had allowed all season. “The boys battled like crazy tonight,” said HBU head coach Steve Jones. “I’m proud of the boys. It was a heck of a defensive effort, especially towards the latter portion of the game. I’m proud of each and every one of them. Now we have to prepare ourselves for another Top 25 [team, Utah Valley] and see if we can prove ourselves once again. I also want to thank all the fans that came out for their support. It was a great atmosphere tonight.” Acuna led all players with four shots and three shots on goal, as HBU improved to 5-6-0 overall and 1-2-0 in the WAC. Thilo Borgmann had a pair of shot attempts. Chance Pope earned the win as he stopped three shots. Three players had two shots for Seattle (9-3-0 overall, 2-1-0 WAC). Shane Haworth stopped four shots as he took the loss in goal. Acuna narrowly gave HBU a 1-0 lead just 2:34 in as his header attempt hit the cross bar. The Huskies drew first blood nine minutes later, as Acuna sent a backwards pass to Darrell Johnson, who beat Haworth near side for a 1-0 lead. It took 17 seconds for Seattle to tie the match as Michael Roberts fired a rocket well outside the box that snuck under the cross bar. HBU would get the lead right back nine seconds later as Acuna beat Haworth, assisted by Dominick Faletto, in a wild series of events. “The individual [goal] is secondary,” said Acuna. “We had a great game and a great team effort. We beat the No. 19 team in the country. We have another game Sunday against the No. 23 team and we’re going to fight for it.” HBU held a slim 5-4 advantage in shots in the first half, but Seattle had five of the six corner kick attempts. The Redhawks came inches close to tying the match as Sergio Rivas’ shot hit the cross bar in the 70th minute. With under a minute left in regulation, Pope made a spectacular diving stop on Jeff Rose’s scoring chance. Seconds later, Faletto beat the defense who had moved up to help score the equalizer and scored past Haworth to seal the win. “The game plan was to come out and defend hard and put away opportunities,” said Pope. “I think the difference in the game was we were able to put away those opportunities where we hadn’t before.” Seattle doubled up the Huskies in second-half shots, 8-4, and outshot the Huskies in the match 12-9. The Redhawks had all seven of the half’s corner kicks and held a decisive 12-1 advantage. HBU hosts No. 23 Utah Valley Sunday at 1:00 p.m. The Wolverines defeated UT Rio Grande Valley tonight, 1-0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:13:14.393+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
