She believes no man has the right give his woman an ultimatum.\n\n\nIrina Shayk. Pic/Getty Images \nThe Russian model-and-actress, who is currently dating Hollywood hunk Bradley Cooper, doesn't often talk about her love life. However, in a recent interview with Britain's Hello magazine, she spoke out in support of women's independence from a male partner's perspective.\n\"I don't think any partner of mine would ask me to do that (pick between love and career). Mutual respect is very important in a relationship and since my work is part of my life, he would have to respect it,\" said the 29-year-old fashionista.\n\"I believe women should be independent and have their own life. But I also think that when a couple decides to have a family, things change because you need to live in unison. Of course, I want to have a family, but there's a right time for everything. When my time comes, it will happen,\" added Shayk, who dated Ronaldo for five years before they split post-Christmas last year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:13:09.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
