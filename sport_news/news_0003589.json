Queen Creek led 19-0 at halftime. \n\"It was a great team effort on defense,\"Schureman said. \"It's 11 guys just getting to the ball and hitting the ball carrier and most people don't like that. \nWestview's offense got going in the third quarter, scoring on a 10-yard run by Stacy Campbell and then on a 46-yard run by Rodney Knox to pull within six points but Queen Creek responded in the fourth quarter, with a one-yard run by Honea and a nine-yard touchdown pass from Honea to Jordan Ackert which put the game out of reach for the Knights. \nQueen Creek and Westview both sit 7-2 heading into the final game of the season. The teams are in a tight race in Division II that also includes the likes of Mesa Skyline, Gilbert Williams Field and Scottsdale Saguaro. \nHonae said the Bulldogs confidence-level is high. \n\"I feel we have a great chance no matter who matter who we play,\"he said.
