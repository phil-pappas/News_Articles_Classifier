On Friday, he returned to his first full practice since Sunday.\n\"It's definitely nice to be back around the team setting here, and start focusing on hockey again,\" said Mason, smiling softly but speaking in a somber tone, after Friday's practice in Voorhees.\nMason said there was \"definitely a mental hurdle that needed to be overcome. It just takes time. That's why I took time to come out to the morning skate [Wednesday] - to be around the guys and also to start working back at hockey and doing things you love to do.\"\nMore coverage VOTE: Will the Flyers make the playoffs?

Latest hockey odds The Ontario native did not want to go into specifics about the medical emergency, but he has a strong support system in the locker room.\n\"It's good to see him around the guys,\" winger R. J. Umberger said, adding that the stress Mason has been undergoing can be relieved a bit by being with his teammates. \"When you're at the rink, you can just be a kid and play hockey. We have a group of guys, a team, that is supporting him. He's one of our brothers.\"\n\"We're a family in here,\" winger Wayne Simmonds said.\nMason said goalie coach Kim Dillabaugh wants him to \"focus on fundamentals that were making the game sharper in training camp and in the first game of the season.\"\nThe 27-year-old goalie said he had \"no set timeline\" for returning, but was \"preparing myself for Tuesday, as I would any normal situation. You definitely kind of itch to get back out there and just start playing again and start to have fun.\"\nMason's backup, Michal Neuvirth, posted shutouts in the last two games.\nFlyers coach Dave Hakstol said he would decide who starts Tuesday after watching upcoming practices. But he seemed to be leaning toward Mason when he said, \"I don't think it [Neuvirth's hot streak] changes our situation at all.\"\nAfter Tuesday's game against Dallas, the Flyers play in Boston on Wednesday. They figure to use a different goalie in each game.\nAt the end of Friday's practice, the Flyers had an unusual drill borrowed from Hakstol's days at the University of North Dakota - two three-on-two formats in one offensive end, with two goalies at the same end about 20 feet apart. The groups were allowed to pass it to teammates on the other side of the ice.\n\"It's just a good compete drill; a good-goal-scoring drill and guys have fun doing it,\" said winger Chris VandeVelde, who played for Hakstol at North Dakota. \"That's UND there.\"\nBreakaways. Umberger returned to practice after missing the last two games because of an undisclosed injury. He may replace Ryan White in Tuesday's lineup. . . . The last Flyer with three straight shutouts was Ilya Bryzgalov in 2012.\nscarchidi@phillynews.com\n@BroadStBull", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNHL_Philadelphia_Flyers"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:21:10.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
