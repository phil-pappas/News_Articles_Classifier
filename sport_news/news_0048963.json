It was my first time going through that, seeing the business side of [hockey].” \nAfter the Chicago Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup for the second time in Saad’s three seasons, the franchise had severe salary cap problems. An unrestricted free agent who played on the Blackhawks’ top line centered by Jonathan Toews, Chicago had no room to extend Saad’s contract. That led to an eight-player trade that brought Saad to the Blue Jackets. A few days later, he signed a six-year contract. \nNot bad for a hockey player from Gibsonia, Pa., who will turn 23 on Oct. 27. \nSaad said he knew the night before the deal became official it was likely to happen. \n“That night, it was something I thought about for quite a bit,” Saad said. “Kinda don’t believe it until it happens. \n“It’s been great ever since being traded,” said Saad, who’s expected to produce points on the Blue Jackets’ top line. “They’ve welcomed [my family] with open arms.” \nOn Tuerday night, Saad attended Paul McCartney’s sold-out three-hour concert at Nationwide Arena. \nFavorite song? \n“’Hey Jude’ — I liked the piano. He has so many hits that it’s tough to [pick one],” said Saad, who attended Pine-Richland High School when he commuted to Youngstown to play in the Phantoms’ final season in the NAHL (2008-09). The following season, owner Bruce Zoldan folded the NAHL Phantoms to create the USHL’S Youngstown Phantoms. \nIn Chicago, Saad was often recognized by fans away from the arena. His presence in Columbus has not yet reached that level. Few recognized him before and after the concert. \n“We were in a private box, kinda secluded,” said Saad, saying he enjoyed just being a fan. \nSaad’s arrival has increased expectations for the Blue Jackets, who have qualified for the Stanley Cup Playoffs just twice since being created in 2000. \n“He’s been very good for us but think there is more that he can do,” Blue Jackets head coach Todd Richards said. “His impact right now is just scratching the surface.” \nThe Blackhawks were hoping Saad would give a two-year hometown discount then cash in for a bigger deal. \n“We never got too close,” Saad said. \nThe Blue Jackets will play in Chicago on Saturday and Saad will be presented his second Stanley Cup ring. He’s not sure what to expect from the United Center crowd. \n“It’s going to be emotional, but exciting as well,” Saad said. \nIn Chicago, Saad lived in a furnished luxury apartment downtown. This summer, he bought a house in Columbus. \n“First time owning a house, getting furniture, things like that, it was hectic at first,” Saad said, “Now that I’m settling in, I’m feeling more comfortable. \n“The city is growing, a lot of new bars and restaurants. But the biggest thing is having success in hockey.” \nOne thing new for Saad is a slow start. During his first season when he was a Calder Cup (rookie of the year) finalist, the Blackhawks won the NHL’s Presidents Cup as best regular-season team. The Blue Jackets have opened this season with four defeats, including Wednesday’s 7-3 loss to the Ottawa Senators. Saad scored the game’s first goal, his third as a Blue Jacket. \n“We’ve had a rough start, but I know we have a lot of leaders,” Saad said. “It’s a challenge and I want to embrace it.” \nFor now, he said he’s leading more by actions than words. \n“Kinda still getting my feet wet with the guys,” Saad said. “It’s a new learning curve for me.” Other stories of interest", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:40:16.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
