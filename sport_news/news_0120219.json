That’s not home. \nAnd that brings up the number, so little and yet so big, that looms over the Armada’s season. \nIn seven months and 14 games across nine states and provinces, the expansion club has won … \nZero. Nil. 0-for-2015. \n“It’s incredible to me, with the talent that we have, that we haven’t been able to win away,” goalkeeper Miguel Gallardo said. “We’ve played some games where we’ve deserved more.” \nThe last chance of the season comes Sunday afternoon, when the Armada finishes its away schedule against FC Edmonton. \nThe 2013 Edmonton squad is the only team in the North American Soccer League’s modern era to complete an entire season without winning away from home. \nBy Sunday night, the Armada — 0-12-2 in its 14 road games this season — could join them. \nNot the kind of history the Armada, which set a league attendance record of 16,164 in its first-ever match with Edmonton at EverBank Field on April 4, had in mind. \nJacksonville has been outscored 20-2 in its nine fall season road games, all losses. \nA win Sunday would not only allow the Armada to avoid the dubious distinction of a winless road campaign, it would also complete an improbable sweep. Jacksonville topped Edmonton 3-1 in the season opener, then charged from behind for a 3-2 victory on Oct. 17 despite playing down a man for 40 minutes. \nThe Armada’s resilient showing gives Gallardo plenty of confidence ahead of a rematch only eight days later. \n“We’re all going in with a positive mindset, knowing we’re playing a team we beat two times,” he said. \nEdmonton has seen its own numbers turn sour, getting mathematically eliminated from postseason contention by the loss to the Armada and drawing fewer than 3,000 fans per game, by far the lowest average in the NASL. \nAnother bonus for Jacksonville is the return of top scorer Alhassane Keita, who tormented the Edmonton defense last week but received his second red card of the year. \nAlthough Wednesday’s 3-1 loss to the fall season champion Ottawa Fury extinguished the Armada’s flickering playoff hopes, the players are optimistic that they’ll erase the zero from the away win column Sunday. \n“We’ve got to get that monkey off our backs,” Gallardo said. “It’s a great opportunity for us to go out there and break that cycle.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:21:40.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
