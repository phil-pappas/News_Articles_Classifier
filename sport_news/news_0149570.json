(Ezra Shaw / Getty Images) \nBrett Anderson ended his regular season spectacularly, giving up only two runs and four hits over 7 2/3 innings in the Dodgers’ 3-2 victory over the San Francisco Giants on Thursday afternoon at AT&T Park. \nAbout the only time Anderson’s rhythm was disrupted was in the seventh inning. \nThe seventh-inning stretch was used to film a scene for the upcoming television series, “Fuller House,” a sequel to “Full House.” As Anderson was warming up, actress Jodie Sweetin called out to Giants outfielder Hunter Pence, then sang “Take Me Out to the Ballgame.” \n“I didn’t know what the hell that was,” Anderson said. “That was terrible. I didn’t know if that was serious or what was happening. \n“I thought it was just her being awful at signing. I had to collect myself there for a second.” \nAsked if he was a fan of “Full House,” Anderson replied, “I was, but I never watched it while I was pitching.” Get news and notes on all the Dodgers matchups >> Open link \nAnderson pitched the majority of the game with a three-run lead. \nThe Dodgers scored their first run in the second inning, when Andre Ethier triple and scored on a sacrifice fly by Chase Utley. \nAnderson scored the first of the Dodgers’ two runs in the third inning, when he went from second base to home on a single by Adrian Gonzalez. Howie Kendrick scored later in the inning on a fielder’s choice. \nThe start was the last in the regular season for Anderson, who is expected to start Game 3 for the Dodgers in a National League division series against the New York Mets. \n“Hopefully, it carries over into the postseason,” Anderson said. \nAnderson finished the regular-season with a career-high 31 starts and 180 1/3 innings. He improved his record to 10-9 and earned-run average to 3.69.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:55:56.971+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
