City have not commented following the development. \nCity fans have regularly booed the Champions League anthem over the past year in protest at the financial fair play punishment meted out to the club by UEFA in 2014. \nCity were fined Â£49million, hit with a transfer spending cap of the same amount and forced to limit their Champions League squad last season to 21 players rather than the regular 25. \nTheir disgruntlement with UEFA grew when a match against CSKA Moscow in the Russian capital last October was ordered to be played behind closed doors because of the behaviour of home fans. A number of City fans had already paid for tickets, travel and accommodation and felt they were being unfairly punished. \nAn organised boycott of the anthem was arranged in conjunction with Bayern Munich fans, who had a similar issue over a game in Moscow, prior to a game against the Germans last December. Both sets of supporters turned their backs during the anthem. \nCity manager Manuel Pellegrini this week refused to criticise supporters over the matter. \nThe Chilean was asked before the Sevilla game if the continued booing might be affecting his players in creating a negative atmosphere before games. \nPellegrini said: \"I think we always have in the Etihad the atmosphere we need in Champions League, Capital One Cup or Premier League. We always feel the fans are behind the team and they always support us a lot. \n\"I don't think the atmosphere is lower than what we need. It is a good atmosphere.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:19:58.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
