Notably the government had imposed a 10 per cent import duty on wheat, for the first time since 2006, in August after private flour millers started importing high-protein stocks from Australia despite surplus stocks of other varieties of wheat with the FCI-the nodal agency for foodgrain procurement and distribution in the country. According to officials, the Agriculture Ministry was also in favour of the hike as overseas buying sends a wrong signal on local prices and is also detrimental for the local markets and farmers' sentiments. State-owned Food Corporation of India (FCI) procured 28.08 million tonnes of wheat in 2014-15 crop year (July- June), of which 26.62 million tonnes were purchased under the relaxed quality norms due to the crop damage because of untimely rains and hail storm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:07:50.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
