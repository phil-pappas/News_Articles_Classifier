Blood is generally drawn and spun down, then reinjected into the injured area. \nAccording to the Hospital for Special Surgery (HSS): \"Platelet activation plays a key role in the process of wound and soft tissue healing. The use of platelet rich plasma (PRP), a portion of the patient's own blood having a platelet concentration above baseline, to promote healing of injured tendons, ligaments, muscles, and joints, can be applied to various musculoskeletal problems.\" Results with PRP are generally mixed. It believed to have limited side effects \"as the patient is utilizing their own blood, which they should have no reaction to,\" according to HSS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:53:50.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
