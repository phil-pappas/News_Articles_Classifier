I have the utmost confidence in him running or throwing. \n\"Garrett is just one heck of a player and a heck of a quarterback, and he still gets better every day. He's a coach's dream and I'm glad he plays for us.\" \nA unanimous selection as the Central Wisconsin Conference 8 Offensive Player of the Year as a junior when he put up Madden-like 3,106 yards of total offense and 36 touchdowns, Groshek has taken his game to another level this season. \nEntering the opening round of the WIAA Division 5 playoffs on Friday, Groshek, who has started 36 varsity games in his Falcons career, has accounted for 2,359 yards and 38 touchdowns, including 28 TDs through the air. \nHe has accumulated those numbers despite taking only nine snaps in the second half of the Falcons seven conference games. The only game Groshek played from start to finish came in Week 2 against St. Mary's Springs. \n\"Garrett had a heck of a season last year. This year he has made a lot of leaps and bounds from last season,\" Lusic said. \"He is just a better football player overall mentally and physically. \n\"He eats and sleeps football in the offseason. He's a student of the game and he's a heck of a leader and competitor. Not only does he want to be successful, but Garrett wants the team to be successful.\" \nYou started your varsity career at linebacker, but have made a lot of noise on varsity as a quarterback Garrett. Which side of the ball do you prefer and why is that the case? I love playing football. As long as I can be on the field and help the team, it doesn't matter to me which side of the ball I play. I'm a football player. \nHow do you see your role on this Amherst football team? I would say being a distributor and making sure we use all of our weapons. \nWhere do you feel you've made the greatest strides as a football player over your Amherst varsity career? Maturing and being able to read the game a lot better. \nYou spent your freshman season as an understudy to Chris Zblewski. What did you learn from him during that season and how did you apply those lessons to your game? I learned from Chris, and all of those seniors (on the 2012 state championship team), that you have to practice hard every day. Do you have a pregame routine you go through before the opening kickoff of every game? Not really, just eating at The Whitetail Lanes before the game. \nWhat has been the highlight of your football career up until this point? This whole season. I love being able to practice and play with these guys (on this team) every day. \nOnce the football season is over you head right into basketball. How does basketball fit into the overall scheme of your athletic career? It's my No. 2 sport, but it has been a great three years (playing basketball) so far, and I'm excited to play one more season with these guys. \nWho has been your role model growing up and what lesson have they taught you that you'll take with you the rest of your life? I don't really have one. There's more than one person that I look up to. I want to be my own role model and do the right thing. \nIf you could choose to meet one person in the history of the world, dead or alive, who would you want to meet, and what would you like to find out about them? (Former North Carolina State men's basketball coach) Jimmy Valvano. I would just like to talk with him because I loved the energy and enthusiasm he had every day. \nName something on your bucket list that you absolutely have to get done by the time you turn 40: Graduate from college. \nWhat is your greatest fear? Losing my last high school football game. \nTell us something about yourself the average person may not know about you: I had a great time being in the school musical \"Grease\" last year. \nHow would you define happiness in your life? Playing football. \nWhat can't you live without? Football right now. \nGarrett Groshek", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:24:13.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
