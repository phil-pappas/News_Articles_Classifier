Tech drops third straight home game By Diego Gaytan 0 DT1 \nThe Texas Tech women's volleyball teams celebrates a score in a huddle together on the court on Saturday during their game against Kansas State University at the United Supermarkets Arena. Tech fell to Kansas State in three sets, with scores of 25-20, 24-26, and 19-25. \nIn its third-straight home loss, the Texas Tech volleyball team dropped three straight sets to a Kansas State Wildcats team that refused to drop marginal leads Saturday afternoon in the United Supermarkets Arena. \nIn each of the three sets, the Wildcats scored first. \nThe Wildcats gained an early step ahead of Tech as they took the first set 25-20, the Wildcats committing only three errors in the set. \nThroughout the first set, the Wildcats never trailed and led by as many as eight points. \nFollowing two kills from Kansas State off a Tech timeout, freshman outside hitter Sarah Redding entered the set and boosted the Tech attack with three kills in a 4-0 run to cut the Wildcat lead to 14-18. \nJunior middle blocker Lauren Douglass landed a kill for the Red Raiders to lower Tech’s deficit to 23-20, but the Wildcats ended a comeback bid with two kills. \nTech coach Don Flora said although Kansas State executed the plays it needed to make for a set win, miscommunications from Tech affected the team throughout the match. \n“I’m not going to say they didn’t play well, I thought they did some good things, but I thought it was more taking care of our 30 by 30,” Flora said. “That means taking care of our teammate, serving our teammates, doing the right things to take care of our teammate and execute.” \nIn the second set, Tech lost in extra frames 26-24 as Kansas State edged out the Red Raiders. \nKansas State started the second set with three consecutive points, but a kill and block from Douglass stopped the Tech offense from allowing the Wildcats from taking charge as it did in the first-set. \nA challenge call from Kansas State on an out-of-bounds call placed the Wildcats ahead 7-6, a lead they kept until the late in the set as a pair of errors tied the match at 20 each. Tech nearly took the set as it neared set point at 24-23, but a Kansas State block sandwiched in between two kills sealed the set win for the Wildcats. \nRedding said the Wildcats crunched out wins versus Tech as they created opportunities without committing errors from their attack. \n“They were playing clean,” Redding said. “They weren’t making errors and we were making errors, and that was the difference in the game.” \nIn the final set, Tech recorded its sixth loss in the Big 12 Conference as Kansas State took the set 25-19. \nDespite the loss, Redding tallied up double-digit number in kills with 11 to lead the team, and freshman setter Morgan Reed, who played all three sets for the first time in her career, led the team in assists with 26. \nTech’s loss to the Wildcats dropped the team’s overall record to 13-9 and 2-6 in the Big 12. \nThe Oklahoma Sooners play host to the Red Raiders as the teams play a Big 12 opener rematch at 7 p.m. Wednesday in McCasland Field House.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:06:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:04:18.713+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
