Twelve months later, the shoe might just be on the other foot. After being decisively beaten by division rivals the New York Jets at Wembley, Dolphins coach Joe Philbin is at risk of losing his own job.\nThat scenario had been floated before kickoff, the Miami Herald reporting that team owner Stephen Ross was running out of patience after a poor start to this season. The Dolphins were humiliated 41-14 by another of their AFC East adversaries, Buffalo, last weekend and have now lost three of their opening four games. This was not how things were supposed to go after an offseason of heavy investment.\nRelated: Priest alleged to have pulled gun on boy because he was a Dallas Cowboys fan\nMiami added new faces at wide receiver, tight end and cornerback, seeking to upgrade a team that has finished in the middle of the pack for three years running under Philbin into a playoff contender. But it was the six-year, $114m contract handed to defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh that truly captured fans’ attention – making him the best-paid defender in league history.\nA 6ft 4ins, 320lb force of nature, Suh had wreaked havoc on opposing offenses over the last five seasons in Detroit, but his impact in Miami so far has been minimal. On Sunday he was manhandled by a backup guard. Brian Winters was drafted into the Jets lineup following an injury to Willie Colon, but more than held his own. Suh finished with three tackles and no sacks.\nPerhaps Miami’s money would have been better spent on the other side of the ball. The Dolphins are well-supported in the UK, a legacy of those years when NFL games were broadcast free-to-air on Channel 4 in the 1980s and 90s. A sizeable portion of this pro-Miami crowd fell for the sport while watching Dan Marino tear up the record books. It was he who drew the loudest cheer at Saturday’s fan rally in Trafalgar Square.\nNobody has yet mistaken the Dolphins’ latest quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, for the second coming of Marino, but the 2012 first-round pick had shown sufficient promise to earn a $96m contract extension in May. He is capable of thriving in this league but was never given the chance here behind a porous offensive line that allowed the Jets’ pass rushers to harass him at will.\nRelated: New York Jets pack their own toilet paper for Wembley trip\nInstead it was left to Jets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick to channel Marino as he launched a 58-yard pass down the left sideline to former Dolphin Brandon Marshall on New York’s first offensive play. Chris Ivory ploughed past Suh and into the end zone two plays later. The running back lost control of the ball as he was going to ground, but replays confirmed officials’ initial ruling that he had crossed the line before fumbling.\nNew York added a pair of field goals before Miami began to muster a response. Tannehill gave a glimpse of his quality as he stood firm in the face of an unblocked Jets linebacker, floating the ball over his opponent and into the hands of tight end Jake Stoneburner for an eight-yard touchdown.\nThe Dolphins, though, had only got into striking distance with the help of back-to-back pass interference penalties against their opponents that moved the ball more than half the length of the field. By half-time, Miami had accrued just 65 net yards, as against their opponents’ 282.\nThey trailed 20-7 at that stage, New York having added a further touchdown on a 10-yard dart from Fitzpatrick to Eric Decker. The Jets increased their lead further in the third quarter, Zac Stacy capping a 78-yard drive by forcing his way over the line from close in.\nMiami, to their credit, kept fighting. Or perhaps they were only just waking up. Both of these teams must have been fighting significant jet lag after only flying into London on Friday for a game that kicked off at the equivalent to 9.30am back home.\nA long punt return from Jarvis Landry early in the fourth quarter set Miami up on the Jets’ side of the field. Tannehill connected on passes to Jordan Cameron, Kenny Stills and then Stills again for a 10-yard touchdown.\nThe Dolphins got the ball back quickly and marched back down the field. Wembley roared as Greg Jennings pulled in another Tannehill touchdown pass, only for the play to be wiped out by an offensive pass interference penalty. New York made the most of their reprieve, Darrelle Revis making a brilliant interception in the end zone. Miami would get the ball back once more, but once again the Jets stole it back with a pick.\nWembley was already half-empty by this stage, with the NFL’s latest sell-out crowd here recognising that the game was up. The question left hanging in the air was whether the same would go for Philbin’s tenure as head coach.", "external_links": ["http://miamiherald.typepad.com/dolphins_in_depth/2015/10/blowout-loss-will-move-ross-to-consider-firing-philbin-during-bye.html"], "published": "2015-10-05T02:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T21:08:29.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
