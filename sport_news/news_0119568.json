Posted: Friday, October 9, 2015 11:15 pm Umatilla outlasts Eustis in renewal of rivalry MARK F. FISHER Correspondent dailycommercial.com | 0 comments \nThe Umatilla Bulldogs (3-4) forced the Eustis Panthers to surrender the ball on downs with 1:22 remaining to preserve a 16-12 victory in the renewal of a rivalry that had been in hiatus since 2006. \nThe Panthers (2-5) had closed the deficit from 16-6 to only four points (16-12) late in the fourth quarter as Beau Brecklin engineered an 11-play, 50-yard drive culminating with a 5-yard touchdown pass to Jacob Locke with 2 minutes, 9 seconds remaining. \nBrecklin’s quarterback keeper for the 2-point conversion was stopped, requiring a successful on-side kick and a touchdown in order to pull out the road victory. \nBoth teams came out ready to play, ready to pick up the win in the the renewal of the rivalry. It didn't matter that the game had nothing to do with district rankings or possible playoff aspirations. \nThis was all about bragging rights. \nTurnovers and field position were critical in the first half that saw the Umatilla’s Tyler Belyeu prevent a long touchdown by Billy Brett with a shoelace tackle at the Umatilla 3-yard line. Four times the Panthers tried to punch the ball into the end zone and four times the Bulldogs defensive front held. \nFor Umatilla, disaster struck after the Bulldogs gained possession at the 1-yard line. A bad snap from the shotgun sailed into the end zone where Eustis' Ryan Mathews recovered it to give the Panthers a 6-0 lead as time expired in the first quarter. \nUmatilla responded to the adversity with its own 11-play, 65-yard drive to take a lead 7-6 on Caleb Robinson’s 21-yard circus catch in the end zone. \nUmatilla pushed its advantage out to 13-6 on its initial possession of the second half when Robinson scooted in from 6-yards out for his second touchdown of the contest. \nThe balance of the half was a battle of wills as each squad struggled to maintain a drive against the other’s defense until Brecklin was hit as he released a pass that fluttered into Umatilla defenisive lineman Ethan Shreve’s hands at the Umatilla 36-yard line. The big lineman was tripped up at the Eustis 11-yard line. \nAnd then it was the Panthers’ defensive front and back field that turned away signal caller Josh Enfinger and the Bulldogs forcing them to settle for Dalton Starling’s 25 field goal and the 16-6 lead with 5:12 remaining in the game. \nEustis responded with the drive that brought them back to within 4-points before the Bulldogs was able to snuff out the final drive and run out the clock for the much sought after and long missing “W” and the bragging rights that come with it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:24:21.208+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
