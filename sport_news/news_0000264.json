Staff Reports Read Article \nThe Boston Red Sox have hired former Philadelphia Phillies general manager Ruben Amaro Jr. to serve as their first base coach, the team announced Monday. \nAmaro, 50, has no previous coaching experience. He will also serve as an outfield instructor and assist in baserunning instruction. \nAmaro was the Phillies’ GM for nearly seven years. Philladelphia announced on Sept. 10 that it would not renew his contract. He played eight seasons in the major leagues and was a teammate of Red Sox manager John Farrell on the Cleveland Indians in 1995. \n“I am truly honored to join the Red Sox, a first-class organization with a tremendous history,” Amaro said. “I was honored that (Boston president) Dave (Dombrowski) and John would consider me for this opportunity and add me to this dynamic coaching staff. I am poised, focused and ready to bring anything I can in terms of experience and knowledge to this position.” \nAmaro replaces Arnie Beyeler as Boston’s first-base coach. Beyeler was the only coach not retained from Farrell’s 2015 staff.
