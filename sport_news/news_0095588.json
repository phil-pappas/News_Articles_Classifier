(AP) - The deaths of a Hattiesburg police officer and paramedic have forced a grim realization: Pike County needs to expand or replace its memorial to first responders who die in the line of duty.\nSupervisors voted this year to add the names of Liquori Tate and Dennis Rushing, but the current monument is nearly full. Tate was shot to death in May. Rushing died in an ambulance crash last year. Both were from Pike County.\nThe Enterprise-Journal ( http://bit.ly/1PP0vHH ) reports that board president Chuck Lambert said two more names will need another memorial.\nCounty administrator Daniel?Calcote said McComb Monument Co. will charge $175 per name and $3,900 for a second monument.\nSupervisors postponed a decision until they learn what it would cost to replace the current monument with a larger stone.\nInformation from: Enterprise-Journal, http://www.enterprise-journal.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
