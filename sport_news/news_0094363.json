Offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo had hinted Darkwa, who led the Giants in rushing in the preseason, could see some work . But until the coaching staff informed him he was going in moments before he did, Darkwa said he was, er, in the dark about getting carries.\nPLUS : Tom Coughlin says Damontre Moore's benching is between them\n\"They told me the drive before. I wasn't really expecting it, but I try to stay ready,\" Darkwa said. \"I always look at the film, and I'm always asking Rashad and Andre and Shane questions, just in case.\"\nGiants coach Tom Coughlin said the plan was for Darkwa to get carries all along.\n\"He certainly did look good out there,\" Coughlin said. \"His touchdown run, when he cut back behind the slanting defensive line, was really quite an outstanding play. ... We planned on having an opportunity with him, and he did come through for us.\"\nNow the question is whether or not Darkwa gets more chances to come through for the Giants. Sunday's win saw the Giants strike almost a 50-50 run-pass balance . Quarterback Eli Manning threw 24 passes, and the four running backs combined for 21 rushes.\nDarkwa had the most with eight, but Vereen led the team with 56 yards on his four carries, breaking a 39-yard run. The team finished with 132 yards on 25 carries, counting four kneel-downs by Manning. Jennings had five carries for 19 yards while Williams had four for 13.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:42:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:50:29.323+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
