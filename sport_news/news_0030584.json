I’m not going to say he is or he isn’t [starting]. If they come out in something else and he doesn’t [start], that makes me out to be a liar.\" \nRichardson will be returning to action after being suspended for the first four games this season for violating the NFL’s substance-abuse policy. \nBowles indicated Richardson likely will play more than 10 snaps, but he won’t play the whole game. \nJackson getting closer \nWashington WR DeSean Jackson hasn’t played since suffering a hamstring injury on opening day, but he practiced on a limited basis Wednesday and coach Jay Gruden said he is \"very, very close\" to returning. However, neither one would commit to Jackson playing against the Jets. \nCB Darrelle Revis, who likely would be matched up against him, isn’t worrying about Jackson’s status. \n\"I don’t care if he plays or not,\" Revis said. \"It’s about us as a team.\" \nJackson said in August he believes \"no one can guard me,\" not even Revis or Seattle’s Richard Sherman. When asked if those comments mattered to him, Revis said, \"No, not at all.\" \nCollege spirit \nRookie DE Leonard Williams, the sixth overall pick in this year’s NFL draft, wore a USC T-shirt in the locker room, two days after the school dismissed coach Steve Sarkisian. \"I’m wearing the T-shirt because I’ve still got to represent,\" Williams said, \"and at a time like this is when I’ve got to represent most.\" \nWilliams called Sarkisian a \"great guy\" and indicated he saw no evidence of issues with Sarkisian while around him. Sarkisian reportedly is having alcohol-related problems. \n— J.P.
