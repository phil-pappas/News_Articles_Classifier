The Rebels offensive line opened up holes all night for 1,000-yard rusher Chase Johnston who piled up 18 carries for 187 yards and three touchdowns. Johnston now has a lofty 1,365 yards rushing on the season to go with 21 rushing touchdowns. The United fans, ready to celebrate Senior Night for the Red Storm, were speechless in the first half as the running clock started with 1:03 left in the second quarter as the Rebels held a 42-0 lead. \"We got our butts kicked by a good football team,\" said United coach Fred Lucas, whose team slipped to 6-2 on the season. The Rebels (8-0, 6-0), ranked No. 2 in the Class 2A poll of the Associated Press, played like a quality state-ranked team the entire night. Rebels coach Jade Noard was pleased with his team's performance. \"Obviously, it was as good as you could script it,\" Noard said. \"We did some things early on those drives and made them change their defense. That opened up it up.\" About his offensive line, Noard added, \"That's who we knew we were going to lean on all year. We got some push at the line of scrimmage. That first half just speaks for itself.\" Runningback Alfred Mono scored the lone touchdown of the night for United on a 75-yard run to paydirt with 8:14 left in the game. Mono finished with 160 yards total rushing on 16 carries. Michael Moore (59 yards) and Sam Brownlee (25 yards) rounded out their rushing attack. Defensively for United, Mono and Kal Youngquist had 3 solo tackles apiece. Youngquist also had a team-high 8 assists on the night. United (6-2) will be gunning for their seventh win next Friday at Mercer County.
