The game will be televised on ESPNU. \nAlabama State head football coach Brian Jenkins said he doesn't necessary think his team plays better on the road, but there's a little more pressure in winning at home. \n\"We prepare for every game the same, and we look at every game the same, and that's with respect,\" Jenkins said. \"I don't think there's a comfortableness on the road or not. I just think we didn't get the task done when we should have.\" \nAlabama State got its first two wins of the season on the road before a 45-34 loss at home to Southern on Saturday. \n\"I'm still a bit bothered by Saturday,\" Jenkins said. \"I really thought it was a game that we could've won and should've won. I'm encouraged because we fought all the way to the end.\" \nArkansas-Pine Bluff (1-4, 0-3) is coming off a bye week after a 61-14 loss to Alcorn State on Oct. 3. The Golden Lions allowed 418 rushing yards to the Braves, something that Hornets junior running back Khalid Thomas said he found surprising. \n\"We like going into the game as the underdog,\" said Thomas, who had 112 receiving yards against Southern. \"We have something to prove, and we don't want anyone to dictate what we do. Playing on the road helps us focus on those things.\" \nThe Hornets won't play another home game until Nov.14 against Prairie View A&M and Nov. 21 against Miles in the Turkey Day Classic. \nSophomore wide receiver Jamir Hannah said that the team has to eliminate mental errors that have hurt in home games this season. \n\"We have a lot of talent on this team,\" said Hannah, who caught two touchdown passes against Southern. \"We have to be more detailed and focused throughout the game. We didn't play very well in the first half last Saturday. Everybody has to play together.\" \nAlabama State will play its fourth game in 20 days Thursday. Hannah said conditioning has been very important to get through this difficult stretch. \n\"Our coaches talk about taking care of our bodies,\" Hannah said. \"I'm still feeling every one of these games, but this is what we set out to do all throughout camp. It's just a blessing to be able to compete in every game.\" \nALABAMA STATE AT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T15:49:04.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
