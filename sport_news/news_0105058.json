Smith (12.7 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 2.5 apg), F LeBron James (25.3 ppg, 7.4 apg, 6.0 apg), F Kevin Love (16.4 ppg, 9.7 rpg, 2.2 apg), C Timofey Mozgov (10.6 ppg. 6.9 rpg, 1.2 bpg). \nKEY ADDITIONS: G Mo Williams (free agent, Hornets), F Richard Jefferson (free agent, Mavericks ), C Sasha Kaun (free agent, Russia). \nKEY LOSSES: F Shawn Marion (retired). \nCOACH: David Blatt, second season with Cavaliers and overall; 53-29. \nEYES ON: Irving. He starts the season on the sideline as he continues to recover from a fractured kneecap sustained in Game 1 of the Finals. There's no timetable on his return, leaving Williams to help James run Cleveland's offense. Irving emerged as one of the league's elite point guards, though he's dogged by injuries. The Cavs need him to drive and create shots -- for himself and others. \nOUTLOOK: As long as the peerless James stays healthy, the Cavs should win the Eastern Conference and return to the Finals. Blatt seems more comfortable in his second year and better prepared to handle everything that comes with the grind of an NBA season. The additions of Williams and Jefferson will help in case of injuries. Tristan Thompson's contract holdout could become an issue if it drags on, depriving the Cavs of frontline depth. \nCHICAGO BULLS \nLAST SEASON: 50-32, lost to Cleveland Cavaliers 4-2 in second round. \nSTARTING FIVE: G Derrick Rose (17.7 ppg, 4.9 apg, 3.2 rpg), G Jimmy Butler (20 ppg, 3.3 apg, 5.8 rpg), F Mike Dunleavy Jr. (9.4 ppg, 3.9 rpg, 1.8 apg), F Pau Gasol (18.5 ppg, 11.8 rpg, 2.7 apg), C Joakim Noah (7.2 ppg, 9.6 rpg, 4.7 apg). \nKEY ADDITIONS: F Bobby Portis (draft, No. 22). \nKEY LOSSES: None. \nCOACH: Fred Hoiberg, first season with Bulls and overall. \nEYES ON: Hoiberg. The Bulls hope Hoiberg and his fast-paced offense make all the difference after they fired Tom Thibodeau following a falling out with management. A former Chicago player, Hoiberg led his alma mater Iowa State to a 115-56 record and back-to-back Big 12 tournament championships. \nOUTLOOK: The Bulls' success still largely hinges on Rose's ability to stay healthy, and he's recovering from a broken orbital bone -- his latest of many issues. Noah struggled last season after knee surgery, Gibson had ankle surgery in June, and Dunleavy had back surgery in September. \nINDIANA PACERS \nLAST SEASON: 38-44, missed playoffs. \nSTARTING FIVE: G George Hill (16.1 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 5.1 apg), G Monta Ellis (18.9 ppg, 4.1 apg, 1.9 spg), F C.J. Miles (13.5 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 1.1 apg), F Paul George (8.8 ppg, 3.7 rpg, 1.0 apg), C Ian Mahinmi (4.3 ppg, 5.8 rpg, 0.8 bpg) \nKEY ADDITIONS: G Ellis (free agent, Mavericks), F Jordan Hill (free agent, Lakers ), F/C Myles Turner (draft, No. 11), F Chase Budinger (trade, Timberwolves), G Toney Douglas (free agent, Pelicans), G Joe Young (draft, No. 43). \nKEY LOSSES: C Roy Hibbert (trade, Lakers), F David West (free agent, Spurs ), F Luis Scola (free agent, Raptors), G C.J. Watson (free agent, Magic ), G Donald Sloan (free agent, Nets ). \nCOACH: Frank Vogel, sixth season with Pacers and overall; 205-144. \nEYES ON: George. After missing all but six games last season with a broken right leg, the two-time All-Star hopes to find his old form. When George returned late last season, he wasn't the same player. But a summer of work has given him confidence and George has looked good in the preseason. \nOUTLOOK: Larry Bird thinks he has at least three legitimate double-digit scorers in George, Ellis and Hill. If George is healthy, Hill is as aggressive as he was late last season and Ellis plays like himself, the Pacers could be in the playoff hunt. \nDETROIT PISTONS \nLAST SEASON: 32-50, missed playoffs. \nSTARTING FIVE: G Reggie Jackson (14.5 ppg, 6.0 apg, 4.2 rpg), G Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (12.7 ppg, 3.1 rpg, 1.3 apg), F Marcus Morris (10.4 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.6 apg), F Ersan Ilyasova (11.5 ppg, 4.8 rpg, 1.0 apg), C Andre Drummond (13.8 ppg, 13.5 rpg, 0.7 apg). \nKEY ADDITIONS: Morris (trade, Suns), Ilyasova (trade, Bucks), F Stanley Johnson (draft, No. 8). \nKEY LOSSES: F Greg Monroe (free agent, Bucks). \nCOACH: Stan Van Gundy, second season with Pistons and 10th overall, 403-258. \nEYES ON: Johnson. The Pistons have had a hard time acquiring any major help via free agency in recent years, so they need to make good on their lottery picks. Johnson could fill a need on the wing. \nOUTLOOK: The Pistons haven't made the playoffs since 2009, and although Van Gundy's track record is a successful one, taking over in Detroit was a major challenge. The loss of Monroe means Drummond will be under pressure to take another big step toward stardom. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:32:48.585+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
