The wind played a factor in the match, with Barnstable (1-8) using the wind at their backs to get a late first half goal. Senior Felipe Campos knocked home the icebreaker two minutes before the half off an assist from classmate Francisco Alves. Dennis-Yarmouth (4-4) enjoyed the wind at their backs in the second half, with Sinha knocking home a free kick from 25 yards out at 9:21 of the half to knot the score at 1-all. Sinha then collected a pass with his back to the goal, lofting a scissor kick into the Barnstable net for the lead. Giffee made four or five big stops according to coach bill Altieri, while junior Braedy Leidner helped lock down the Dolphins box with strong play at sweeper. D-Y also got strong play from Arryson paul on defense, senior Max Perant in the midfield and senior Sonam Sherpa at striker.

BOYS GOLF Martha’s Vineyard wins its own invitational: It seems only fitting that the inaugural Vineyard Golf Club High School Invitational would be captured by the home team as Martha’s Vineyard High School eked out a three-shot win over Bishop Feehan Saturday in cold, blustery conditions. Finn Simpkins led the Vineyarders with a medalist-tying, 1-over-par 73 on the windblown Vineyard Club layout in Edgartown. Unfortunately for Simpkins, he lost in a playoff for the first-place honor to Feehan’s David Chatfield on the par-3 10th hole. Each of the nine competing teams used three of their four players score to determine the team aggregate score. Simpkins was helped by an 80 from Zak Ganz and an 84 by Chris Mayhew to record the 237. Feehan also had a 78 from Chatfield’s brother Patrick and an 89 by Martin Murphy for itsr 240. Finishing third in the team competition was Coyle-Cassidy (248), as three teams from the Eastern Athletic Conference dominated the rest of the field. Nauset Regional took fourth (250), Falmouth (257) was fifth followed by Somerset Berkley (262), St. John Paul II (276), Bishop Stang (289) and Dennis-Yarmouth (333). Nauset’s Lane Bohman took third in the individual competition after shooting a 78 over the 6,223-yard layout. Patrick Chatfield was fourth with his 78 (he lost on a match of cards to Bohman) with Coyle and Cassidy’s Kyle Leitch taking fifth with a 79. The conditions were difficult with some wind gusts reaching speeds over 50 mph. However, the course drained well from Friday’s four-plus inches of rain and was in great shape for the 36-player field.
