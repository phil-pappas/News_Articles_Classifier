He spent eight years with the club, winning the MLS's top executive award in 2012 and 2014. \nManning begins his new job Friday, overseeing all TFC team and business operations. Toronto has been without a president since the 2013 firing of Kevin Payne, who doubled as general manager. Tim Bezbatchenko is Toronto's current GM. \nLarry Tanenbaum, board chairman of the Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, announced Manning's hiring Monday. The move leaves a president in charge in each of the company's prized assets: Brendan Shanahan with the NHL's Maple Leafs, Masai Ujiri with the NBA's Raptors and Manning with Toronto FC.
