Just before midnight, the driver of a 2007 Mini Cooper traveling east along Highway 4 east of Vallecito Bypass Road at a high rate of speed lost control, causing the the car to cross the road and hit some trees, according to a CHP report. A 16-year-old was transported from Mark Twain Medical Center to Modesto Memorial Hospital, where he died Monday afternoon. The driver and another passenger sustained major injuries and were transported to Mark Twain Medical Center. The passenger has been released from the hospital. Alcohol and drugs are not believed to be a factor, the report stated. In an accident on Friday, Dino Caraveo Jr., 27, of Tracy, was driving a 2002 Honda Civic east along Highway 26 near Jenny Lind Road about 5:30 a.m., according to a CHP report. Cecilia Ferreira, 47, of Valley Springs, was driving a 2013 Ford Fiesta about 45 mph west along the highway. Caraveo was driving at an unknown speed when he allowed the Honda to travel over the double-yellow lines and into Ferreira’s path. The vehicles collided driver’s side to driver’s side. Caraveo’s car spun around and came to a rest in the left-hand turn lane, while Ferreira’s car spun around and slid down a dirt and grass embankment. Ferreira sustained moderate injuries and was transported to Mark Twain Medical Center. Her condition was unavailable Monday afternoon. Caraveo sustained minor injuries from his seatbelt but refused medical treatment. He was booked into the Calaveras County Jail on suspicion of driving under the influence of alcohol and driving with a blood alcohol level of 0.08 or more.
