To the naked eye, the Browns defense is coming off of a second consecutive week of giving up over 400 yards of total offense to an opponent. The film, however, according to head coach Mike Pettine and some players on the defense, shows something different.\n\"Sometimes you just can't see it from afar,\" defensive back Tramon Williams said, \"but we feel that we are close, so, at the end of the day, that's all that matters.\"\nFor his part, Williams has been one of the few bright spots on the Browns defense so far, even with his penalty that gave the Chargers a second shot at winning on Sunday. He's a leader who came to Cleveland from Green Bay, where it's rare to have three losses this early in October.\n\"We have to get some things cleaned up,\" Williams said, \"but we saw some good things on film.\"\n\"We are close,\" linebacker Christian Kirksey said. \"If you watch film -- I know a lot of people outside, they are not watching the film; they are just watching the game on Sunday and they see the stats and they think, 'The Browns are doing this bad and doing that bad.' There are a lot of good things on film that we can learn from and build off of.\"\n\"One thing we're not going to do is anything wholesale and hit the panic button,\" Pettine said. \"We know we're close, but there are things we have to do better.\"\nIt's a stark contrast to the spring, when safety Donte Whitner ranked the team's secondary among the league's best.\n\"You're going to look at the stats and I'd say we were No. 1 or No. 2 in every category in the (NFL) that really distinguishes whether you are a top secondary,\" Whitner said in May . \"So I'm not going to say top-5 or top-6, I'm going to say top-3 and that's based on men lie, women lie, stats don't.\"\nUnfortunately for the Browns right now, the stats aren't telling a kind truth. As of Monday, the defense ranks last in the league in total yards per game. They've allowed the fourth most passing touchdowns and are next-to-last in the league in rushing yards per game. All four of the team's opponents have scored 27 or more points.\nMike Pettine declared on July 29, the day before training camp opened, \"the theme for this year is going to be 'words into action.'\" It's something he's mentioned in press conferences multiple times since.\nThe film may have looked promising, but it certainly couldn't have hidden the fact that the Browns defense allowed seven plays of 20 yards or more against the Chargers, including two of over 60 yards. A week earlier, the Raiders logged six plays of 20 yards or more, including three of 40 or more yards. They gave up career-long plays to Danny Woodhead and Dontrelle Inman on Sunday.\nThe Browns are not a young defense facing a steep learning curve. They are an expensive, veteran defense repeating many of the same issues that plagued them a year ago and dealing with new issues they didn't expect. Whether it's scheme or personnel is a question to which we may never fully have an answer. Regardless, there's enough ailing this unit to cover everyone and everything.\nThe Browns defense may very well be close. With 12 games left, including all six divisional games, close won't cut it if they hope to salvage their sinking season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T17:29:16.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
