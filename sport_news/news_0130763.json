And as has been the case this year it would Mercedes on the front row -- as Nico Rosberg was on the pole, with his teammate Lewis Hamilton right alongside. The German was hoping to trim Hamilton's lead in the overall points standing -- but would instead deal with mechanical issues. \nRussia's Daniil Kvyat would get the majority of crowd support in Russia. \nEarly on Nico Rosberg would have major issues with his ride as his throttle would not be working correctly -- and thus affect his performance. \nThat allowed teammate Lewis Hamilton to overtake him for top spot. \nIt also spelled the end of the German's day, and all but kill his chances of catching the Brit in the overall standings. \nFormer four-time drivers champ Sebastian Vettel was able to move up as he is able to overtake Kimi raikkonen on the inside on lap 17. \nLater on Raikkonen is involved in a crash with Valterri Bottas -- much to the charging of the McLaren team. The Ferrari driver tries cut inside but t-bones the Finn and knocks him out of the race. \nRaikkonen's ride would not be in good condition. \nAnd with all that drama going on behind him Hamilton is able to cruise to victory -- his second straight in Sochi. \nAnd that means a congratulations from Vladimir Putin. \nSebastian Vettel would come in second, and Sergio Perez was third, which is the highest finish for Force India this year. Hamilton extends his overall points lead on Vettel and Rosberg. And Kimi Raikkon's crash incurred him a penalty which meant Ferrari cannot catch Mercedes for the constructors title.
