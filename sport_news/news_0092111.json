Elliott — a former walk-on — did not. \nThe diminutive native of Panama City was all by himself, with a chance to make a play. From the stands, a handful of Elliott’s family members watched it all happen in slow motion, with father Jay Elliott sure of what was about to occur. \n“I knew he was going to catch it,” Jay Elliott said. \nJavien Elliott completed the play by recording his first career interception in the first meaningful series he ever played with FSU’s starting defense. \n“It’s just in the air so long. And everything was quiet,” Elliott recalled. “Once I caught the ball, that’s when I heard everything go off.” \nTeammates immediately swarmed Elliott during the third quarter of FSU’s 41-21 win over Louisville. Elliott — who enrolled at FSU in the spring of 2014 as a walk-on before receiving a scholarship prior to the 2015 season — then ran to the sideline to celebrate before getting mobbed a second time by ecstatic teammates. \nNo. 9 FSU (6-0, 4-0 ACC) could turn to Elliott again when it plays at Georgia Tech (2-5, 0-4 ACC) on Saturday because starting nickel back Trey Marshall is out for the regular season with a biceps injury, and Hunter did not practice Monday or Tuesday because of a concussion, according to Seminoles coach Jimbo Fisher. \nElliott first caught Fisher’s eye as a scout team player last season from the very first time he began matching up — and keeping up — with scholarship receivers. \n“He started covering our guys, and I’m thinking, ‘Are our guys not running? What’s going on?’ And he was competing very hard,” Fisher said. “We tell the [scout team] guys, ‘Give us a game look. Work them hard. Don’t just give in to them. Make those guys better.’ And he did it. He was running right with them, contesting balls and throws.” \nFisher eventually awarded Elliott a scholarship before this season, and felt comfortable using him on special teams throughout the year. \nElliott forced a fumble late in a blowout victory over Texas State and recovered a fumble on special teams against Boston College, but Saturday was his first extended action on defense.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:17:57.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
