Hungary’s right-wing government declared its southern frontier with Croatia off limits to migrants, blocking entry with a metal fence and razor wire just as it did a month ago on its border with Serbia. Croatia began directing migrants west to Slovenia, which said some 300 had arrived and would be registered before continuing their journey to Austria and Germany, the preferred destination of the vast majority, many of them Syrians fleeing war. But their movement had slowed visibly, with dozens of buses lined up at Serbia’s border with Croatia through the night and into Saturday as Croatian police controlled their entry, a Reuters reporter said. Slovenia suspended rail traffic with Croatia. Aid agencies are concerned about backlogs of migrants building in the Balkans, battered by autumn winds and rain as temperatures drop before winter. Hungary said it had reinstated border controls on its frontier with Slovenia, effectively suspending Europe’s Schengen system of passport-free travel. Both Slovenia and Hungary are part of the Schengen Area while Croatia is not. A government spokesman said Budapest had taken the step because “migrants appeared” on the Slovenian side of the border. Hungary says it is duty-bound to secure the borders of the European Union from mainly Muslim migrants threatening, it says, the prosperity, security and “Christian values” of Europe. Asked what would happen if Germany was to close its doors, Croatia’s interior minister warned of a “domino effect”. “It will be a lot of trouble for all countries and I cannot predict what will happen in this situation,” Ranko Ostojic, speaking in English, told reporters at a migrant camp in the eastern Croatian village of Opatovac. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:17:00.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
