(Photo: USF Athletics) \nA smile snuck across Willie Taggart's face as I posed the question. \n'What makes Jamie Byrd special?' \nHe politely waited for me to finish the question but halfway through you could see how excited he was to brag on his senior. \n\"You know he's going to hit something and he's going to hit it hard,\" said USF's third-year head coach. \"He just dives in and throws his body in there and he really has no fear for contact.\" \nByrd is the Bulls' hard hitter. He is a quiet kid who is responsible for a lot of loud. He leads the team in interceptions this season (2) but he's known as a physical player . \nHis tenacity and willingness to throw his, albeit smaller, weight around has earned a nickname that is downright perfect. \n\"I laid a hit on a player in practice one day and he said I came crashing down like an Angry Bird,\" Byrd said with a smile, referencing the popular video game Angry Birds . \nFormer USF defensive lineman Todd Chandler was the man who dubbed No. 2 'Angry Byrd'. The name instantly stuck. \n\"That first year he came out here he played like an Angry Bird,\" said linebacker Auggie Sanchez. \"He hit everything and he was a big time player for us and he lived up to the name Angry Byrd.\" \nThe video game features different types of birds, all with different strengths, attempting to crush pigs staged around obstacles. Birds are aimed and fired towards the pigs by the player. \n\"That little small one that come really fast, I think he reminds me of that one,\" said safety Nate Godwin. \"The little small guy but he's going to hit you hard and he's going to come real fast.\" \nHis coach agrees. Taggart describes Jamie as Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde because he is so nice in the locker room and plays so angry on the field. \n\"You need that edge on the field,\" said Byrd. \"Kids approach me like, 'That's the Angry Byrd! That's the Angry Byrd!' And it's kind of like it makes you feel like a super hero or something.\" \nUSF will try to win back-to-back games for the second time since Taggart took over as head coach in 2013 when the Bulls travel to face the UCONN Huskies on Saturday. Kickoff is set for noon and will be televised nationally on ESPNU.
