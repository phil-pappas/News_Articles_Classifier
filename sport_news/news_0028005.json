He runs with reckless abandon, and he plays with a lot of confidence. I don't think the size of the stage matters to him. He just has a job to do, and he's very instinctive in a lot of the things that he does. I am not surprised at all.\"\nGuice has rushed 29 times for 263 yards now this season — a 9.1 yards per attempt average not far shy of Saturday's 10.1 yards per attempt.\n\"In camp, he showed us what he can do, and he's getting better, just like all the other running backs,\" senior offensive tackle Jerald Hawkins said. \"From Leonard (Fournette) to Darrel (Williams) to Nick Brossette, they always upgrade, and they always show us something new each game.\n\"To tell you the truth, just the mentality when they run the ball, they always have it on their mind, 'Any play can score,' and that's how they run. We love that about 'em.\"\nLongtime high school coach Eric Held, now an assistant at Catholic, saw much of the same special potential from Guice as he remembers from Jeremy Hill at Redemptorist.\nCatholic High coach Dale Weiner not surprised by LSU RB Derrius Guice's success Freshman running back led Tigers with 161 yards, scored first college touchdown Saturday against South Carolina\nHill went on to rush for 2,156 yards and 28 touchdowns in just two years at LSU before challenging Corey Dillon's Cincinnati Bengals rookie rushing record last season with 1,124 yards and nine touchdowns.\n\"I had the opportunity at Redemptorist, my last year there in '07, when Jeremy was a freshman — and he got to play a significant number of snaps — to be his position coach and offensive coordinator there,\" Held said. \"Both of those guys, even at young ages, the physicality that they played with, not afraid of contact, explosiveness, vision as well (stood out), and both of them with running back drills, they always wanted a drill that incorporated more than just one drill, where they were challenged. And it helped the other backs as well.\"\nThe 5-foot-11, 222-pound Guice \"is a little bit faster than (Hill) and a little bit shorter,\" Held said, and \"nothing they did at a young age in their first year at LSU, none of that was surprising to anybody that was around them.\"\nWhat has perhaps been most impressive from Guice is the strides in maturity he's shown from the time LSU offered him in 2013 to his signing this February and now .\nThe young LSU standout, this week's SEC Freshman of the Week , visited his alma mater late last week.\nLeonard Fournette on RB teammate Derrius Guice: 'He's a man' | Video LSU running back Leonard Fournette talks to the media after Saturday's victory against South Carolina.\n\"He has come a long way, and I'm really proud of him,\" Weiner said. \"It happens to a lot of young people and I think to a degree all of us. We hear things in high school (from) our teachers, our coaches and obviously your parents. But those in authority growing up will say things and try to teach you certain things, and you may not appreciate it at the time.\n\"But I think it's one of those things where once he left Catholic High School and the program, I think it started to occur to him. He saw some things for the first time, 'You know what, I think they did have my best interests at heart, and I think some of the things that I've been taught really are true.'\nLSU RB Derrius Guice reminiscent of former star Jeremy Hill Catholic High assistant Eric Held worked two years with Guice after having also coached Hill at Redemptorist\nWeiner pointed to Guice's recognition as the program's Student-Athlete of the Month in June, his patience behind Fournette and his work on special teams as more visible signs of that progression.\nAnd both he and Held —who said he hasn't been surprised by Hill leaving a mark early in his NFL career, either — see even bigger success in Guice's future if he continues on his path in that regard.\n\"The stable of backs they have at LSU, not only this year, but every year, is just phenomenal,\" Held said. \"It's been a Running Back University, with coach (Les) Miles and (running backs) coach (Frank) Wilson, as well, and getting those guys involved and showcasing their talents. They're also one of the top rushing teams in the country, and it's a real good fit for both of those guys, where they ended up.\n\"It's a good situation for both of those guys to be in, and, like I said, Derrius still has 30-something games in his career, and if he stays healthy and everything else goes well, he'll be the same type of guy that's highly scouted by NFL teams in a couple years and go from there. But still a whole lot of ball for him to play.\"", "external_links": ["http://player.espn.com/player.js?playerBrandingId=4ef8000cbaf34c1687a7d9a26fe0e89e&adSetCode=91cDU6NuXTGKz3OdjOxFdAgJVtQcKJnI&pcode=1kNG061cgaoolOncv54OAO1ceO-I&width=576&height=324&externalId=espn:13854912&thruParam_espn-ui", "http://player.espn.com/player.js?playerBrandingId=4ef8000cbaf34c1687a7d9a26fe0e89e&adSetCode=91cDU6NuXTGKz3OdjOxFdAgJVtQcKJnI&pcode=1kNG061cgaoolOncv54OAO1ceO-I&width=576&height=324&externalId=espn:13854457&thruParam_espn-ui"], "published": "2015-10-15T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:28:46.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
