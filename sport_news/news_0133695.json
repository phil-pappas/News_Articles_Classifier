Older guys taught them composure and how to run races.” \nOf his personal performance, McDermott, who’ll play golf next year for Lafayette, said, “I just felt like I had it.” \nPleasantville overcame an on-course foot injury to Dylan Bronkema, who typically finishes a point-scoring fifth on his team. Instead, junior Will Blasdell grabbed that scoring spot, running 17:.40.2 for 59th place out of 239. \n“He really came up big for us,” coach Brett Alcantara said of Blasdell.

John Jay-Cross River, Mamaroneck, Bronxville and Ursuline took the two through five spots in a 24-team field. \nGrace Bugara was Lakeland/Panas’s top finisher in fourth. Sunny Nagpaul was 11th, Jenna Pressman 19th, Claire Smith 25th and Maggie McCarthy 27th. \n“Our whole team pretty much PR’d,” said Bugara (18:37.8). \nBugara wasn’t a fan of the course, although she said she liked that it “runs fast.” \nShe wasn’t alone. \n“I hate this course. I think it’s an awful course. I was nervous all week for this course,” said Mamaroneck’s Lauren Chapey, who worried about getting lost and about slipping on the route's many woodchips. \nBut she needn’t have worried. \nChapey, who earlier won the White Plains Gressler meet, the Brewster Bear and Manhattan, was the top finisher among 182 girls in 18:02.6. \nUrsuline freshman Sarah Flynn (18:10.2), who said she hoped for some “ending speed,” was second and Bronxville’s Kaitlin Ryan (18:22.7) third. \nChapey seemed particularly happy, since her team won its first league title just days earlier. \n“This is the best girls team we’ve ever had,” 15-year Tiger coach Bob Morrissey said. \nJohn Jay-Cross River’s Eion Nohilly ran a personal-best 15:34.5, sprinting across the finish, to beat runner-up Greg Crowley of Scarsdale by more than 19 seconds. Irvington’s Luke Carmosino outkicked Mamaroneck’s Sam Mollin for third. \n“I wanted to beat him but he had the better day,” Crowely said of Nohilly, who’s a friend. \nStill, Crowley’s day wasn’t bad. Crowley, who has four major wins this season, ran a personal best, knocking 30 seconds off his previous top time at Woodlands.

He was not to be broken.” \nTwitter: @HaggertyNancy 9 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1S4ThyA TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:54:35.080+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
