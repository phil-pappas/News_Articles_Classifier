The Pittsburg soccer team added another road win to their record after defeating Basehor-Linwood 2-1 Saturday in Basehor. After falling behind early and trailing 1-0 at the half, the Purple Dragons put on a rally to score a pair of unanswered goals to come back and beat the Bobcats on their home pitch. “Taking a win off a long road trip is always a challenge. I’m proud that our players got it done, clawing from behind to steal the win,” Pittsburg head coach Sean Lauderdale said. “We made some personnel changes at half to maximize what we could get out of the squad, and they came out energized and ready to play.” Pittsburg moved to 12-2 this season following the win over the Bobcats. The Purple Dragons have a 5-0 record as the Southeast Kansas League Champions. The Bobcats came out of the gates with a strong attack against the Purple Dragons. After a miscue by PHS on a missed defensive clear, Basehor-Linwood took advantage and put the first goal on the scoreboard near the five-minute mark. The Bobcats remained in control for the remainder of the first half, dominating possession and keeping the Purple Dragons at bay. Changes made by Coach Lauderdale to PHS’ lineup seemed to spark the Purple Dragons as they kept the Bobcats on the defensive. Pittsburg’s Jamie Maldonado found forward Jose Ayala with a slotted pass, putting him on a breakaway. Ayala took it from there as he tied the game, 1-1, on with a goal in the 53rd minute of play. Both teams battled back and forth for the remainder of the second half until Pittsburg pulled ahead on a goal in the 76th minute from Lukas McConnell, who scored a on a left-footed shot to the side of the net. Pittsburg held of Basehor-Linwood for the remaining time in the second half to hold for the win. “They took some pretty hard knocks but didn’t get demoralized and still found opportunities to score,” said Coach Lauderdale. “I can’t ask for much more out of a squad than that. This is the kind of touchstone moment that will serve us as we head into regionals in the upcoming weeks.” PHS senior goalkeeper Sullivan Lauderdale had nine saves on the day with one goal allowed. Others taking shots during the match for the Purple Dragons included Carlos Calderon, Enrique Romero and Maldonado. PHS soccer is in action next when they host Columbus at 4:30 p.m. on Oct. 20 at Pittsburg High School.
