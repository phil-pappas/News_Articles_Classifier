The winner hosts the wild-card Chicago Cubs in the NL Championship Series opener Saturday. \nWith Chase Utley on the bench again, the Dodgers handed hometown Mets rookie Steven Matz his first loss in the major leagues. \nKershaw’s one-out single led to a three-run third. Adrian Gonzalez looped an RBI single and Turner added a two-run double, providing enough support for the lefty ace. \nThe reigning NL MVP and three-time Cy Young Award winner snapped a five-start losing streak in the playoffs — the longest in Dodgers history. \nAfter dropping the series opener 3-1 to deGrom, Kershaw was 1-6 with a 4.99 ERA in 12 career postseason games, including nine starts. He had lost elimination games each of the past two years, once on three days’ rest. \nBut this time, Kershaw was just as dominant as he normally is during the regular season. \nKershaw struck out eight, walked one and yielded only three hits, quieting another revved-up crowd at Citi Field as the night wore on. Daniel Murphy hit his second solo homer off Kershaw in the series, both coming in the fourth inning. \nKenley Jansen got four outs for his second save. With two runners on in the eighth and the count full, he retired Murphy on a fly to right. \nThe right-hander then worked a 1-2-3 ninth as the Dodgers ended a seven-game losing streak in road playoff games. \nThe 24-year-old Matz was pitching in a big league game for the first time in 19 days after a balky back sidelined him late in the season. Still, he looked sharp early and snapped off several effective curveballs. \nThat same pitch caused him trouble, too. \nKershaw singled to left-center on a 2-2 curve in the third for the first hit of the game. \nWith two outs, Howie Kendrick grounded a single up the middle and Gonzalez dumped an RBI single into center.
