Woods says recovery will be 'long and tedious'   \nMEXICO CITY (AP) — Tiger Woods is facing what he calls a long and tedious recovery from another back surgery and is not sure when he will come back. \nWoods was in Mexico City on Tuesday for the Bridgestone America's Golf Cup, an exhibition he was supposed to play with Matt Kuchar. That was before he announced he had a second back surgery after his doctor discovered a fragmented disc that was pinching a nerve. He had surgery a month ago. \nWoods already has said he won't be able to play his Hero World Challenge the first week of December in the Bahamas. Perhaps more telling was that he has not even started rehabilitation from the surgery. \nHe says the one part in his favor this time is he won't be changing his swing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:21:04.999+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
