Class A Geneseo Regional The Leafs cruised to the regional title, and Monica Lieving caught fire on the back nine to earn medalist honors with a 77 on Oct. 7. The first tee can set the tone for a players round, but the ladies’ tees at Maple Bluff Golf Club in Geneseo requires a demanding first tee shot. Lieving knew almost immediately, her iron off the first tee was trouble. Nestled among a line of trees down the right side of the fairway, players had to stare down a large bunker on the left side of the fairway with out of bounds just beyond the bunker. Lieving’s shot sailed out of bounds into the courses driving range, and she had to settle for a triple bogey on the first hole. Heading into the back nine, Lieving needed to rebound fast after carding a 43 on the front. She was able to patch things together and supplemented several pars with birdies on holes 15 and 16 to nail down the individual medalist title. The Leafs’ team continued to play poised and loose with three players carding scores in the 90’s. Geneseo’s Lauren Murray fired a 92 to finish in ninth, Emma Vandemore shot a 96 to tie for 11th place and Jenna Cheek came to the clubhouse with a 98 to grab 16th place. Not far off the pace were Amber Dauksas in 19th place clubbing a 100, and Sierra Sommer’s 105 landed her in a tie for 21st. Peru-St. Bede Sectional Lieving’s par on the 18th hole ended up meaning more than anyone expected. With the final group approaching the last hole at Spring Creek Golf Course in Spring Valley, Lieving’s final hole would determine history on Oct. 12. Geneseo girls’ golf coach Steve Brucher told the Lady Leafs, if Lieving parred the final hole they would tie for the sectional title. “She left her tee shot short,” said Brucher of the par-three 18th. “She had a chip up an incline. I thought it was going to be tough. She hit it inside of two feet for almost a tap in par.” However, when Lieving’s par putt dropped, it was enough for Geneseo to claim a one-stroke victory. “I couldn’t imagine it any other way,” Lieving said. “There’s nothing more I can ask for really.” Geneseo earned the program’s first sectional title posting a 366 team score to hold off runner-up Lanark Eastland (367) in the 12-team field.

With a par on the final hole, Lieving qualified for a playoff with Lanark Eastland’s Karissa Freidag. “I love stuff like that,” Lieving said. “It’s fun to feel so much adrenaline. A playoff is one of the best situations to be in, because you get to fight for yourself.” A senior, Lieving won the individual title on the second playoff hole with a pair of pars. The top seed coming into the sectional, Geneseo had to face the worst of the conditions on the golf course. Geneseo’s seed had them tee off late in the day as the wind began to pick up, just as the Leafs’ players began play on the longer back nine. Teams which started on the back nine were shielded from the wind by the course’s valleys on front nine. However, Geneseo continued to show their mental toughness by not looking for excuses and battling through the conditions. “I started to get worried,” Brucher said. “It’s a tough go of it on the back nine with the wind. The girls did a great job. They persevered, and battled through and were rewarded for it.” Geneseo’s underclassmen Cheek (92) and Murray (95) played beyond their years. The Leafs’ Vandemore and Amber Dauksas each carded a 100, and Sierra Sommer shot a 101 to provide consistent scores from every member of the team. While the Leafs are going to be making back-to-back state trips, Geneseo’s Dauksas and Lieving are the only two players with state experience. “I think it speaks to the depth of our team and our program,” Brucher said, “That we have been able to do this with almost a completely different lineup.” By Chris Steele", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:00:57.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
