I was trying to be careful. That curveball he threw me, it was a good one, it was pretty close.\n\"You could argue that I got the benefit of a borderline call. Bottom line is I ended up on first and Tulo came through.\"\nThe Royals weren't sure the walk was warranted.\nKansas City manager Ned Yost said after the game that he tried to get an appeal on Bautista's check swing, but the umpires couldn't hear him over the loud Rogers Centre crowd.\nVolquez was adamant the pitch wasn't a ball.\n\"I saw the pitch and that was a strike,\" he said. \"A breaking ball doesn't have to be right in the middle (when it's caught). What matters is where it was when it crosses the plate.\"\nAs the series shifts back to Kansas City on Friday for Game 6 with the Royals up 3-2, Bautista said he's not about to alter his approach at the plate.\n\"I want to make something happen, especially with men on base, but I've got to be patient enough to swing at strikes,\" he said. \"It's a tough act, balancing that out.\n\"I'm not going to change anything. I'm just going to continue with my plate discipline and hopefully force them to throw strikes.\"\n___\nFollow @throwinsmoke on Twitter\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T06:32:55.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
