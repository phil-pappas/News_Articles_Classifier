Games one, two, and, if necessary, five will be played on the Royals home turf in Kauffman Stadium.\nHow important is that? Well, consider the Royals lost all six games they played against Houston and New York on the road.\nThere are many factors that enter into that 0-6 record, including the Astros' and Yankees' stadiums.\nThe new Yankee Stadium is just 314 feet down the right field line, so the Bronx Bombers load up with lefties who can pull it down the line and over the wall.\nHouston's Minute Maid Park, meantime, has a short left field, only 315 feet. The Astros lineup is packed with righties who pull the ball over the short porch in left.\nThere are other home field quirks too, like the hill in the middle of dead center in Houston. Ask Lorenzo Cain how much fun that is. Cain tripped on the hill and smashed into the center field wall while tracking a fly ball during one of the Royals losses there earlier this year.\nWhile the Yankees and Astros build their roster to suit their ballparks, so do the Royals. The Royals play in spacious Kauffman Stadium. They're roster is loaded with pitchers who induce fly balls and outfielders who routinely chase them down.\nThe Royals are 4-2 against the Yanks and Astros at Kauffman this year. That's not perfect, but it's way better than 0-6 on the road.\nYeah, home field advantage is really important, especially for the Royals.\nKansas City will find out who'll they'll be playing when the Astros and Yankees square off on Tuesday.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
