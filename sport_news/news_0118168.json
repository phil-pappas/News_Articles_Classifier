It shattered the old record set by 42 flyers in June. \nWeiss said the record was verified by a panel of judges from FÃ©dÃ©ration AÃ©ronautique Internationale, the international group that keeps track of skydiving and other aviation-related records. \nOne judge on the ground witnessed the jumpers leap from three separate aircraft at 13,500 feet, create the formation and then break apart at 5,500 feet. Two other judges reviewed photos of the jump later and confirmed Monday it was official. \n\"It was an absolutely incredible experience,\" said Weiss, who was also one of the jumpers. \"We're a very small community, although we're growing, and to get everyone together from all over the world, especially to achieve such a difficult goal, is very rewarding.\" \nWingsuit flyers from 12 countries — including the United States, Canada, Britain, Australia, Russia, Poland, South Africa and Israel — took part. \nWeiss said the flyers actually broke the old record twice Saturday. After 50 people went out for a first jump there was time for a second one, so 11 more joined in. \nSkydive Perris was the site of another record earlier this month when 202 divers linked up to form the world's largest sequential skydiving formation. \nWingsuit diving differs in that skydivers wear special suits with pressurized wings attached to their bodies, allowing them to glide horizontally while they fall at a slower rate than regular skydivers. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:29:30.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
