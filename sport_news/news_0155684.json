Cornell has played once before on a Friday night, falling at Princeton, 34-31, in 2007; all told, Cornell is 5-4 in games played on days other than Saturday, including eight Thanksgiving Day matchups with Pennsylvania. \n\"Friday night's always fun, we all remember playing on Friday night in high school,\" junior nose guard Mike Staples said. \"And especially with Colgate -- it's not a league game, but it's kind of like a natural rivalry because we might have played them 90 times in the history of Cornell football. That's always fun.\" \nIn fact, Friday's game will be the 97th between the schools since their first meeting in 1897; Cornell holds a slim 48-45-3 edge, although the Raiders (1-3 overall, 1-0 Patriot League) have had the better of recent clashes. Cornell has lost six straight and 29 of the last 36 to Colgate, including last year's 27-12 Raider win in Hamilton. \nBut for the Big Red (0-2, 0-1 Ivy League), it's not about recent or ancient history. It's about this year, and the players and coaches see a lot about which to be optimistic. \n\"Compared to last year, it's almost like night and day on both sides of the ball,\" said senior fullback Julian Gallo, who had his first reception last Saturday, a 7-yard touchdown catch in the Red's 33-26 loss at Yale. \"Everyone can feel we're at this tipping point in the program, and we're just waiting for that momentum to get started.\" \nOne might have thought that process was starting after a little over 29 minutes of last Saturday's game at Yale, which found the visitors ahead, 26-7. Archer admitted that he was beside himself when his team took a 19-point lead on the team that had crushed his squad a year ago, 51-13. \n\"I think I was out on the hash mark greeting them as they came off the field,\" Archer said Tuesday before practice. \"It was great to see them having a great time and executing and dominating in that first half.\" \nBut Yale gained a modicum of momentum when it scored with 32 seconds left in the half, just 15 seconds after the Red scored what would prove to be its final points. And the Bulldogs kept right on charging, tying the game at 26 with 1:12 to play following a blocked Big Red field-goal attempt, then getting a quick three-and-out and scoring the game-winning touchdown with 32 seconds to play. \nStaples bristled at the suggestion that the Big Red needs to learn how to win (\"I don't know what that means ... we've all won games before,\" he said), but Archer hinted that there is a learning process, especially for a team that's won just four times over the last two-plus seasons. \n\"As a coach, you try to practice situational football, creating a third-down or a red-zone situation,\" he said, \"but it's really hard to create 'Hey, let's win the game in the fourth quarter' in practice. The only time you can learn how to do that is in those situations. We weren't ever really in that situation last year, except for maybe the Columbia game (the Red's only victory, 30-27), and here we've been in them in our first two games. \n\"We controlled every facet of the game but then made some big-time critical errors to let them back in the game, and weren't able to finish,\" he said. \"That's really the biggest thing.\" \nFour of Cornell's six first-half possessions ended with touchdowns; after halftime, Cornell punted three times, turned the ball over twice and had a 42-yard field goal try blocked, which set up the game-tying TD. \nColgate started the year with three straight losses before finally getting on track last weekend at Holy Cross, 31-14, in its conference opener. Junior tailback James Holland led the charge with a career-best 141 yards on 24 carries, and classmate Jake Melville completed 14 of 19 passes for 145 yards and a touchdown. \nDefensive back Chris Morgan took Patriot League Defensive Player of the Week honors for his performance against the Crusaders, which included seven tackles and an 60-yard interception return for a touchdown to seal the game with 3:12 to play. \nArcher is assuring his players that Colgate's overall record doesn't tell the whole story. \n\"Year in and year out, Colgate's a very good football team,\" he said. \"Their quarterback (Melville) makes it all go, he's a great player and very dynamic. They run a 3-4 defense, very movement-based, they blitz a lot, so it'll be a different test from the two defenses we've seen so far, and a completely different offense.\" \nThe Big Red jumps back into Ivy League play next Saturday when the 24th-ranked, defending champion Harvard Crimson come to town for a noon kickoff.
