The series was designed to bring together street stockers who run on both paved and dirt ovals with a little bit of both on the schedule.\n\"Mother Nature kind of stepped in on us,\" said Robert Fisher, Circle Track general manager. \"We had two dirt races planned out of six, but the first got rained out. And there have been delays in building a (new) dirt oval in Memphis, so all our races this year have been on pavement. But the plan is still to go both surfaces in the future.\"\nStill, the combination of dirt and paved racers has provided some entertaining racing so far. \"They slide it sideways, bang some fenders, and no one has gotten out front and run away with an event,\" Fisher said. \"These are all lifetime racers, local heroes where they're from, and it's provided a great show.\"\nThe race will pay $5,000 to win, and the season champ will pocket $2,500 from a $30,000 points fund, and there's a nifty points tussle coming into the finale.\nJust two points separate the top three drivers in the standings — Shawn Smith of Louisville (140), Todd Kempf of Huntingburg, Indiana (139) and Curtis Peeples of Round O, South Carolina (138). Three others, Brian Bayer (130) and Roger Williams (123) of Indiana and Loren Short of Michigan (119) are still in striking distance, especially since points will also be awarded for the 25-lap qualifying races run before the main event.\nThere should also be some Mid-South drivers who will try to get in on the fun. \"We've had inquiries from a number of guys who run dirt tracks in Mississippi and Arkansas asking about gear ratios and other things they would need to do to their cars to run in this event,\" said Craig Wack, MIR's Director of Marketing and Public Relations.\nMIR Vice President/General Manager Pam Kendrick said, \"The Rusty Wallace Racing Experience has been a staple here every third weekend of the month, but we're looking for a couple of competitive series to come here, help sustain the (oval) facility and keep it viable.\"\nCircle Track's parent company, The Enthusiast Network, has had several successes in Memphis — including a stop on this year's Hot Rod Magazine Power Tour. \"We picked Memphis in part because of the long-term relationship the company has had with the facility,\" Fisher said.\nWhile all that's going on, the MIR drag strip is hosting a three-day IHRA Team Championship, that will run through Saturday on the drag strip. It will feature 30 top sportsman and junior racers from MIR and 11 other tracks competing for team and individual honors.\nIt kicks off a full October slate of events, highlighted by next weekend's IHRA World Finals, which will draw more than 300 entries in Nitro Funny Car and Harley, Pro Mod, Pro Stock, Jet Dragster and Sportsman classes to the finale of the 11-race IHRA national tour.\nKendrick said MIR has had a solid season, highlighted by the most successful stop on the Super Chevy tour, a Professional Drag Racers Association event, the Power Tour and solid growth in both MIR's regular Summit Racing Series bracket races and Midnight Madness events on the drag strip.\n\"We've been able to grow some events very well, and we want to continue to bring in more genres of racing, manufacturer's series, an all-truck event,\" Kendrick said. \"We're looking to utilize the facility as fully as possible.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:16:46.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
