Wake was heavily involved in Miami's win over the Tennessee Titans this past Sunday, when he recorded four sacks. It was easily the best performance of the year for Wake, and also one of the best in his career. Wake rushed Titans quarterback Marcus Mariota several times and is a big reason why Miami came away with an easy win. Campbell's Dolphins Make it Look Easy in Tennessee All four of Wake's sacks came in the second quarter of the win. This was only the third time in nearly 25 years that single quarter feat has been accomplished. The total was also only a half-sack short of Wake's personal record in a game. Wake entered Sunday's game with no sacks on the year and had been mostly invisible on defense. As was the case for most of the team, Wake under performed in Miami's first four games. That led to the team having a 1-3 record, and also had the Dolphins ranked near the bottom of the league in terms of team defense. Dolphins Owner Launches Anti-Racism Effort The hope going forward for Miami is that Wake can build on this performance and continue to contribute on a high level. The Dolphins can only go as far as their highly touted defense takes them. Wake and Ndamukong Suh are seen as the biggest parts of that defense. Suh has still been held off the board in the sacks department through five games. Wake has been with the Dolphins since 2009 and has been to the Pro Bowl three straight times. If the 33-year old can turn his season around, a fourth straight appearance could be in the cards for Wake. Wake and the Dolphins will look to make it two wins in a row when they host the Houston Texans on Sunday. Published at 2:10 PM EDT on Oct 21, 2015 \nNews breaks at inconvenient times.
