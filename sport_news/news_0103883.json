Changing of the leaves is starting to happen at lower elevations, but more dramatic colors should arrive toward the end of October and early November.\nTo help leaf peepers find the best scenery, Georgia’s State Parks offers an online “Leaf Watch” travel planner, found at www.GeorgiaStateParks.org/leafwatch.\nCloudland Canyon State Park, with sweeping vistas and trails along streams broken by waterfalls, is a top picking for fall foliage. Gilmer Chamber of Commerce Starting Oct. 1, Leafwatch tracks bursts of color throughout the state, focusing on 13 state parks. The site offers color updates from park rangers, recommendations for day hiking trips, calendar listings and availability for lodging for last-minute getaways. On the website, you can even learn why leaves change color (it has to do chemical processes in the plant as the weather cools and season changes).\nWhether traveling to the Appalachian Mountains for hiking, or heading south for paddling, Leaf Watch will keep an eye on the changing foliage.\nTraditionally, some of the most popular spots for leaf watching include Amicalola Falls, Black Rock Mountain, Cloudland Canyon, Tallulah Gorge and Unicoi State Park.\nFall at Amicalola Falls State Park in Dawsonville, from Kim Goldstein. The website, which has been offered every fall for the past several years, will be updated on a weekly basis, most likely in the middle of the week so foliage seekers can make their weekend plans accordingly.\nHere is a look, based on reports at Leafwatch, at five state parks already showing great color:\nBlack Rock Mountain State Park\nThe forest is beautiful now, with park rangers seeing reds, yellows, and oranges. Peak expected this weekend.\nAt an altitude of 3,640 feet, Black Rock Mountain is Georgia’s highest state park. Roadside overlooks and the summit Visitor Center offer sweeping views of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The 2.2-mile Tennessee Rock Trail is a good choice for a short, moderate hike. For an all-day challenge, take the 7.2-mile James E. Edmonds Backcountry Trail.\nhttp://gastateparks.org/BlackRockMountain\nCloudland Canyon State Park - near Chattanooga\nThe sky is blue, the air is crisp and the leaves are really starting to color up now. From the Overlook Trail you can see a patchwork of color as the different trees on the canyon walls change. Elsewhere in the park the leaves are progressing nicely. This weekend and next weekend should be fantastic times to visit the park.\nOne of Georgia’s most beautiful parks offers easy-to-reach rim overlooks and challenging hiking trails. A favorite hike takes you down a long, steep staircase to the bottom of the canyon, where you’ll find two waterfalls. The 5-mile West Rim Loop is moderately difficult and offers great views of the canyon. Rental yurts are located off this trail.\nhttp://gastateparks.org/cloudlandcanyon\nFort Mountain State Park — Chatsworth\nDogwoods have finished their display, and now the oaks are beginning to show some bright yellows in the tops. The hickories are also bright yellow in the higher elevations of the park, plus some of the maples are also turning red on the lake trail. Our park is still mostly green, but the cool nights should speed things up.\nThis park is best known for a mysterious rock wall along the mountain top, plus a variety of trails. For the easiest walk, take the 1.2-mile loop around the park’s pretty, green lake. For a challenging, all-day hike, choose the 8-mile Gahuti Trail. Mountain bikers have more than 14 miles to explore. Hwy. 52 has beautiful mountain scenery and overlooks that are worth stopping for.\nhttp://gastateparks.org/fortmountain\nSweetwater Creek State Park - Lithia Springs\nYou can now see considerable change in the leaves. The most noticeable reds are from the Sourwood trees and the Sumacs as well and more subtly, the Red Maples. The Tulip trees (Tulip Poplars) are yellowing as well as the gorgeous Umbrella Magnolias along Jack’s Branch on the White Trail. The best short hike to see the glory of Fall is the Red Trail which takes you to the five story Civil War era New Manchester mill ruins and the half mile of whitewater rapids (up to class IV) of Sweetwater Creek. This is a great time to see the gorgeous juxtaposition of leaves ( greens and yellows and reds) with a brilliant blue sky in the background.\nJust west of Atlanta you’ll find 9 miles of hiking trails, a beautiful creek and small lake. For an easy walk, take the popular 1-mile Red Trail which follows the creek to the ruins of an old mill. For more of a workout, continue past the mill to the Blue Trail, where you’ll climb steep bluffs for outstanding creek views. Sign up for a guided hike to learn more about this park’s Civil War history.\nhttp://gastateparks.org/sweetwatercreek\nF.D. Roosevelt State Park - Pine Mountain\nNice reds are showing as the dogwood, sourwood, blackgum, and cherry leaves dapple the green landscape. Much of the leaf color is still to come as we await the yellow hues of oaks and hickories.\nMany people are surprised to find hardwood forests and rolling mountains south of Atlanta. The 6.7-mile Wolf Den Loop is a favorite section of the longer Pine Mountain Trail. For a touch of history, drive to Dowdell’s Knob to see a lifesize bronze sculpture of President F.D. Roosevelt and great views of the forested valley. Ga. Hwy. 190 is a pretty driving route.\nhttp://gastateparks.org/fdroosevelt", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/21/9c/00/amicalola-falls-leaf-watch-1.jpg", "http://gastateparks.org/fdroosevelt", "http://gastateparks.org/fortmountain", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/21/65/5b/cloudland-foliage.jpg", "http://gastateparks.org/BlackRockMountain-Hiking", "http://gastateparks.org/BlackRockMountain", "http://gastateparks.org/sweetwatercreek", "http://gastateparks.org/cloudlandcanyon"], "published": "2015-10-22T14:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:01:16.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
