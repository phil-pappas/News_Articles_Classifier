Updated: Wed 12:05 AM, Oct 21, 2015 / Headlines List / Article \nLEXINGTON, Ky. (WKYT) - Kentucky Sports Radio's Matt Jones discusses the chances of Harry Giles coming to Kentucky. Giles is the No. 1 recruit in the country. \nDid you watch Big Blue Madness this past weekend? I did and I enjoyed it. They had Drake there, they had recruits, we got to see the team, it was a big time atmosphere. \nBut for John Calipari the entire weekend's about recruiting and he had big time talent in. The most important two are De'Aaron Fox, a point guard that I think is as good as anybody in the country and Harry Giles, the No. 1 player in America. \nHarry Giles is from North Carolina and it's not likely that Kentucky will be able to get him to come, but there is a chance. Most people think Duke has led for a couple years. He's amazingly talented. Think Kevin Durant, but with the ability to shoot in the college game about as good as you've seen. \nCalipari wants him in Lexington. He's an amazing talent, but getting him out of North Carolina is hard. However there was good news on Monday. Giles is not going to visit home state North Carolina. That's big, that means the No. 1 player in America will go to either Kentucky or Duke. \nI don't know if they'll get him, they probably won't. But we know that North Carolina has no chance. It's Kentucky or Duke and if they pull Harry Giles, he might be one of the two or three best players Calipari has ever had.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:54:15.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
