The Empowered Committee would meet soon to discuss them,\" a senior official told PTI.\nThe Central GST (CGST) will be framed based on the model GST law. Also, the states will draft their own State GST (SGST) based on the draft model law with minor variation incorporating state-based exemption.\n\"Trade and Industry should also be a part of the law because ultimately they would pay the tax. Hence, their views are essential. The drafts will be put up on website by first week of November,\" the official added.\nThe drafts of the proposed legislations are based on three principles -- definitional clarity, certainty in assessment and promoting ease of doing business, the official said.\nThe model GST law and iGST law have been drafted by the officials of both Centre and States, the official added.\nAlthough the government had planned to roll out the GST, which is touted as the most comprehensive indirect tax reform since Independence, from April 1, 2016, it seems difficult in view as the Constitution Amendment Bill is stuck in the Rajya Sabha where the ruling NDA does not have a majority.\nThe government, however, is going ahead with the preparatory work necessary for smooth implementation of the GST, which will subsume various levies like excise, service tax, sales tax, octroi, etc, and will ensure a single indirect tax regime for the entire country.\nThe government has already put up three reports of empowered committee on GST on refunds, payment process and registration for public comments by October 31.\nThe date for next meeting of the empowered committee has not been finalised yet. It was scheduled to meet last month but the meeting was deferred. â€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:18:45.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
