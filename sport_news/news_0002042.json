He earned the nod with the Royals starting right-handed pitcher Edinson Volquez . \n\"I'm fired up,\" Johnson said. \nThat leaves Michael Cuddyer on the bench to start the series. Johnson has had just six at-bats all postseason while coming off the Mets' bench. The Mets had thought about starting him in the lineup or fiddling around by putting Juan Lagares in center field and shifting an outfielder into the DH spot to improve their outfield defense. \nRELATED : Alex Rodriguez: Mets can win '3 or 4' World Series in next 5 years \n\"We looked at all the possibilities,\" manager Terry Collins said. \"And if (Johnny) Cueto was starting, we were looking at perhaps somebody else, because his numbers against lefties are pretty good. We thought tomorrow night that Kelly gave us our best opportunity and if we need to make changes, we will. \n\"But yeah, we're pretty happy with our outfield defense. This is a big park, like ours. I think Yoenis has shown that he can play centerfield. And if we need to make moves, we'll make moves later in the game.\" \nThe Mets traded for Johnson this July from the Braves. \nCollins also said there is a \"chance\" that Juan Uribe could still make the World Series roster . Uribe hasn't played in over a month because of a chest injury. If he does get put on the roster, it could be at the expense of infielder Matt Reynolds. \nMike Vorkunov may be reached at mvorkunov@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @Mike_Vorkunov .
