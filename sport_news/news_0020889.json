Telfer. \"This one would be so easy to solve. We could reach across the aisle. Progressives and conservatives could come together around this issue to name a new state flower, the Kankakee mallow.\"\nIt has long been the somewhat nonsensical and self-aggrandizing tradition for U.S. states to claim various things, such as flowers, as their own. Here are some of them.\nThe official Illinois bird is the cardinal.\nAnimal: White-tailed deer.\nFish: Bluegill.\nInsect: Monarch butterfly.\nMineral: Fluorite.\nTree: White oak.\nThere are other official state things, including a song. The Illinois General Assembly nominated and approved an official song in 1925; lyrics by Charles H. Chamberlain, music by Archibald Johnston. It is titled, cleverly, \"Illinois,\" and it starts like this:\nBy thy rivers gently flowing, Illinois, Illinois,\nRobbie Telfer Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune Robbie Telfer, Calumet Outreach Coordinator of Field Museum and poet, helps to lead a group of college students and residents collecting seeds and redistributing them in other areas of the Beaubien Woods Forest Preserve, Saturday Oct., 3, 2015.\nRobbie Telfer, Calumet Outreach Coordinator of Field Museum and poet, helps to lead a group of college students and residents collecting seeds and redistributing them in other areas of the Beaubien Woods Forest Preserve, Saturday Oct., 3, 2015.\n(Abel Uribe / Chicago Tribune) O'er thy prairies verdant growing, Illinois, Illinois,\nComes an echo on the breeze.\nRustling through the leafy trees, and its mellow tones are these, Illinois, Illinois,\nAnd its mellow tones are these, Illinois.\nYou can hear it here .\nNow, if you just listened, you might feel the need to immediately start your own campaign for a new state song, any new state song.\nBut hold on. Let's get back to that flower.\nThe official state flower — approved as such by the General Assembly in 1908, after its selection by a vote of Illinois schoolchildren the previous year — is the violet. It's a nice enough flower but, as Telfer and some like-minded folks note, it is also the state flower of New Jersey and Rhode Island and Wisconsin.\n\"And that is just not right,\" says Telfer.\nHe is no wild-eyed radical, though he is a poet. He is a fine poet too, having performed around the world and worked with Young Chicago Authors, where he helped organize its Louder Than A Bomb poetry festival for years. He has also been a teacher, co-founded the live literary variety show, the \"Encyclopedia Show\", and was an individual finalist at the National Poetry Slam.\nTake a look at some of Illinois' state symbols, as identified on the state's official website .\nHe is now happily in the employ of the Field Museum, where he wears the title of Calumet Outreach Coordinator and works \"as one part of a very dynamic team of folks both at the museum and with Habitat 2030, and sometimes leads tours that engage people \"with their surrounding natural spaces, helping to foster a sense of wonder, participation and stewardship of regional ecological treasure.\"\n\"A few years ago, I really started getting into gardening and became interested in native Illinois plants,\" says Telfer, who lives in an apartment in the Albany Park neighborhood where he tends \"a garden of mostly native plants and some vegetables. Many of the native plants are genetically tied to the north branch of the Chicago River, so the seeds are being harvested for eventual wild reintroduction, with permission.\"\nLast year is when he paid the $15 registration fee to join the Illinois Native Plant Society and first heard of the Kankakee mallow.\n\"It only grows in one place, its native habitat 20-acre Langham Island in the Kankakee River,\" he says. \"But no one was sure it was still there.\"\nAnd so did the mallow become his cause, and part of a larger issue for him.\n\"It is tragic, all the species of animals and plants that have vanished,\" he says. \"For centuries there was not much thought given to the idea that things could just end. People saw the world as endless, timeless, ours to have forever.\"\nTelfer talks about one of the exhibits he sees every day at work.\n\"It is an awesome exhibit that lists all of the mass extinctions our planet has suffered,\" he says. \"There was one caused by meteors, another by volcanoes. … We are now in the midst of the sixth mass extinction, and that is all attributable to humans. There are plants and animals becoming extinct every day and you look at that and it's easy to become hopeless. It gives you a sort of dark knowledge that is sometimes hard to grapple with.\"\nBut working at the Field Museum also \"gives me, and those who visit, especially children, a sense of wonder, gives knowledge. It inspires.\"\nThus inspired, Telfer became a member of the newly formed Friends of Langham Island, a small group, some of whom traveled to the island last summer to find the mallow.\n\"I did not go on that first trip to the island with these people, these brilliant and kind people, who are sort of EMTs for nature,\" says Telfer. \"They couldn't find the mallow, the island was so overgrown with invasive species.\"\nBut they believed that its seeds were still there, a hope of rebirth buried in the ground, and Telfer joined some of these people over the winter, going to the island a number of times to cut down trees and burn them and make rolling fires that they hoped would awaken those \"sleeping\" seeds.\nThey were eager to see the results of their work, but heavy spring rains had swelled the river and made it off-limits to boats. A drone was flown over the island but its photos and video could not confirm the mallow's presence. Then, on the first day of August, a group took a boat back to the island, filled with what Telfer calls, \"an anxious excitement.\"\nAnd what did they find?\nIn short: the mallow lives. And Telfer has written about these adventures , saying in part, \"(We) felt like we had discovered gold, or when Jed Clampett found 'bubbling crude,' precious and profound.\"\nTelfer, whose ecologically-minded/boat-rowing pals included Trevor Edmonson, Michael Rzepka, Linda Masters, Michael Swierz and Stephen Packard, admits that, \"I actually don't really care if it does become the state flower. I care that it lives and goes on living.\n\"To find it alive was a powerful and moving moment. I'm not Indiana Jones but to be on that island with friends and discover this thing that we had done together had worked was a powerful and moving moment and my hope is that this can bring some more attention to issues of conversation. I actually feel like I am living a poem.\"\nrkogan@tribpub.com\nTwitter @rickkogan\n Entertainment", "external_links": ["http://www.ill-inps.org/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56210037/turbine/ct-ae-1018-kogan-sidewalks-20151015", "http://www.illinois.gov/about/Pages/StateSymbols.aspx", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-553951fc/turbine/chi-illinois-state-symbols-20150423", "https://www.illinois.gov/about/Audio/ilsong.mp3", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5620fff8/turbine/ct-ae-1018-kogan-sidewalks-20151015-002", "http://habitat2030.org/blog/kankakee-lazarus/"], "published": "2015-10-16T16:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:57:26.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
