Who starts the series on the mound and who they will be facing is still a mystery.\nWhether it’s the Los Angeles Dodgers or New York Mets, the Cubs will have both of their top of the rotation guys available. Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester have both pitched against the two possible opponents already this year.\nJake Arrieta The Cubs ace had the most memorable moment of the Cubs season earlier this year against the Dodgers when he pitched his no-hitter. While that can’t be expected again, it’s fair to say that Dodgers hitters won’t approach the plate with much confidence against Arrieta.\nIn comparison, his numbers against the Mets seem relatively pedestrian. In both of his outings this season against the Mets, Arrieta went eight innings allowing only one run. The Cubs won both games 6-1. He let up a combined eight hits with 17 strikeouts.\nJon Lester Lester hasn’t pitched since Game 1 of the NLDS, the lone loss to the Cardinals. Judging from his starts so far this season, Lester would much prefer to face the Mets in the NLCS.\nIn his two starts against the Mets this year, the Cubs are undefeated. Lester allowed a combined three runs with only five hits in each game.\nThe Dodgers, on the other hand, have gotten to Lester regularly. Lester started two games against Los Angeles, never getting beyond the sixth inning and allowing at least four runs in each start.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T12:10:31.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
