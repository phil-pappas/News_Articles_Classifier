However, Dhoni denied to such rumours later in the day. \nNotwithstanding criticism for making Ajinkya Rahane warm benches, Indian skipper MS Dhoni, had a day before Kanpur ODI, hinted that the talented batsman may not feature in the playing eleven for the first ODI against South Africa as he fits into the setup only in the 'top three' batting slots. \n[ Finisher Dhoni takes blame for loss ] \nDhoni, who had earlier criticised Rahane for not rotating the strike enough in limited overs, had said that the Mumbai batsman should only bat at the top of the order and not at five or six. \n\"I think four is the number for Rahane. Even four is quite low for him I would say,\" said Dhoni on the eve of the match. But, Dhoni shocked all when he announced Rahane made it to the playing XI. \nAfter losing the first of their five-match One-Day International (ODI) series by a slender margin of five runs against South Africa here on Sunday, India captain MS Dhoni said it was a game they should have won and they should have scored more runs between 36 to 40 overs, the period when Kohli was on the crease. \n[ We should have scored more runs from 35th to 40th over, says Dhoni after loss ] \nVirat scored 11 runs (18 balls) in the match while Rahane scored 62 runs in 62 deliveries. \nHowever, such reports are not new, rumours of clash of thoughts between Dhoni and Kohli started coming from time to time ever since India toured Australia last year. \nOneIndia News Read more about: Other articles published on Oct 12, 2015 Please Wait while comments are loading...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T10:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:35:28.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
