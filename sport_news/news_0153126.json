Reports had suggested that the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI) had advised Airtel to withdraw or to modify appropriately the ongoing 4G LTE advertisement before October 7 or seek a review of the decision. Airtel spokesperson denied having received any such order and said it was not withdrawing the campaign. The spokesperson added that the telecom operators’ campaign on 4G that calls its services to be the fastest in India was based on rigorous tests and the company would engage with the advertising industry watchdog to clear whatever misconceptions that may have cropped up on that. Airtel has 4G presence in more than 300 towns and the advertisement campaign was launched in August after it announced nationwide 4G services rollout, calling Airtel Challenge, saying: “If your network is faster, we will pay your mobile bills for life.” The Airtel advertisement, which contains statements such as a movie download in three minutes, album upload in 1 minute statements, is false is many contexts, the ASCI said. The claim in the advertisement, “Airtel 4G is the fastest network ever” and “If your network is faster, we will pay your mobile bills for life”, is misleading by omission in the absence of appropriate disclaimers in the advertisement, it added. Reports also suggested that the Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) had also upheld the decision of the ASCI. It viewed the advertisement and considered Airtel’s response and the opinion of a technical expert presented at the meeting before reaching a conclusion. Airtel further said it was engaging with the ASCI to provide it with necessary technical data in support of the advertising claims — and that the prescribed process was being followed to schedule a review of the issue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:12:12.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
