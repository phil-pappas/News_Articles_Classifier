Gettys, did not make the August trip to the Bahamas with the rest of the men's hoops team after failing to meet team expectations in the preseason. \nHaywood transferred to UNCW last year and was forced to sit out the 2014-2015 basketball season due to NCAA rules. He never played in a game for the Seahawks. \nCopyright 2015 WECT.
