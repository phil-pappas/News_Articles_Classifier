The money for the shoes was raised through the UCA student-athletes’ annual pancake breakfast. \nBefore giving the youngsters’ shoes, the athletes washed their feet, a simple but highly symbolic experience of becoming a servant. \nAt first, it was awkward to both washer and washee. Neither was used to the process. But neither will forget it. A connection to a longtime memory was made. \n“The new people weren’t sure about washing feet, but they learned to love it,” said Jessie Taylor, a UCA softball player. “It’s humbling experience.” \n“At first, the kids look at you like ‘what’s going on?’ when you wash their feet,” said UCA softball player Randi Wallace. “Then, there are smiles on their faces. They’ve never experienced anything like that before.” \nMany of the young people have never had a new pair of shoes. \nWhat they receive is a gift of respect and a treasured item that is practical. \n“The smiles on their faces mean everything,” said Wallace. \nSeveral hundred miles away, on the same weekend, the Northwestern State football team spent an afternoon at a Methodist church in Natchitoches. \nThe NSU team is nicknamed Demons, but on this day, they were angels. \nThe football players, in the midst of a five-game losing streak, packed 20,000 boxes for meals for homeless, some of which went to flood victims in South Carolina. \n“It bonded us together in a different way,” said coach Jay Thomas. \nThe next game, the Demons went out and upset Lamar. \nNo way to tell whether the humbling act of providing meals for the needy directly result in a victory any more than handing out shoes and backpacks and washing feet will result in victories over championships for the UCA athletes. \nBut that’s not it. \nIt’s a group of athletes, in performance- and record-based activities, looking at success and life experiences from a different perspective — from the lens of giving and service. Winning and losing have a different meaning. \nIt’s a different scoreboard, one with much more staying power. \n(Sports columnist David McCollum can be reached at 501-505-1235 or david.mccollum@thecabin.net )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:29:39.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
