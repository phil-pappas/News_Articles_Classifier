I am fully focused on finishing the season strong and helping the New York Cosmos win the NASL championship. In the coming months I will decide the next step in my career.” \nThe Cosmos rank third behind Ottawa and Minnesota in the table with two regular-season matches remaining. \n“The decision to retire is not an easy one but I believe it is the right time,” Raul said. \nRaul has seven goals in 26 appearances for the Cosmos. \n“Raul is one of the world’s most iconic players,” Cosmos coach Giovanni Savarese said. \n“I knew when we signed him what he would bring on to the pitch but his knowledge, passion, professionalism and commitment exceeded my expectations.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:50:45.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
