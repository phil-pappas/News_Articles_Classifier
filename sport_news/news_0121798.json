Congratulations to our team in Brackley and Brixworth who have worked so hard to make this achievement possible, winning a second world championship in a row,\" said Mercedes-Benz boss Dieter Zetsche in a statement.\n\"After winning in 2014, we raised the bar again to secure this year's title and we needed to because our rivals gave us plenty of headaches as they stepped up their performance. The work by our team is the perfect example of what drives Mercedes-Benz forward: the best technology.\n\"Most importantly, though, we must not forget the human factor... We have two exceptional sportsmen at the wheel, Lewis and Nico, and a fantastic team behind the scenes, who have delivered 12 wins in 15 races so this year.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:38:41.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
