Hopefully I can give him some advice on both sides of the seat. \n“There’d be no reason at all why we couldn’t get a pretty reasonable result; definitely a top five result.” \nAfter recently returning from retirement to race alongside Jack Perkins at Sandown and Bathurst, PRA team principal Tim Edwards said Ingall was the best possible candidate for the position. \n“It’s great to have Russell on board. He has a lot of experience at the Gold Coast circuit which was what we were looking for,” Edwards said. \n“Our aim is to keep our lead in the team’s championship so that means avoiding a DNF next week. Russell has also worked with our car #6 race engineer Adam De Borre so they already know how the other operates which will make the process that much easier.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:38:54.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
