(AP) - Henrique Ribeiro kicked a 38-yard field goal to end the game and give Chattanooga a 20-17 victory over Wofford on Saturday. \nDerrick Craine ran for 90 yards with a touchdown, and quarterback Jacob Huesman ran for a score to help the Mocs (6-1, 4-0 Southern Conference) snap a seven-game road losing streak against the Terriers. Ribeiro also made a 34-yard field goal in the third quarter. \nQuarterback Brad Butler ran for two touchdowns to lead Wofford (3-5, 1-3). \nButler bulled in from the 6-yard line, and then ran in for the 2-point conversion to cap a 16-play, 61-yard drive and tie the game at 17-17 with 2:25 remaining. \nHuesman completed three passes and ran for 21 yards on two carries, and Craine ran for 16 yards on a fourth-and-2, to set up Ribeiro’s game-winning kick. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:27:08.232+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
