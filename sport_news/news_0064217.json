It's everything you could need and more,\" said ASU Football Equipment Operations Coordinator Jerry Neilly. \nNeilly said the work is hard and the hours are long, but it's a job he wouldn't give up for the world. \n\"You get to act like a kid, you're around twenty year olds all day, makes you feel young,\" said Neilly. \nPerhaps my favorite thing the team travels with is a trunk full of snacks. \nNeilly says the trunk is full with everything from gum to cookies to crackers, whatever the team wants. \nASU football also travels with their locker room. \nHow you might ask? \nWell Neilly and his team replicate all the signage from ASU's home locker room and take all the replicas on the road. Players also will have all the pictures and memorabilia they have in their home locker on the road. \nNeilly's staff even takes the same air fresheners on the road, so the locker room smells the same. \nThere's nothing this guy doesn't think of. 2 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://12ne.ws/1Lw4zuI TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:38:12.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
