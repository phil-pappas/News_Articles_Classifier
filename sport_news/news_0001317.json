Each day recently seemed to offer a different reason to sell — Europe, China, Japan, biotech stocks, high-yield bonds. The Fed won't tighten. The Fed will tighten.\nAll of the churn resulted in the worst quarter for U.S. stock since 2011, a resounding dirge that somehow managed to end on an up note Wednesday.\nMost of the action was centered on the downside, with 16 public companies in the state losing 40 percent or more of their stock value during the quarter. Almost all of them deal in commodities or energy.\nBonanza Creek Energy was the biggest loser, falling 77.7 percent during the quarter. Investors who valued it at $2.35 billion a year earlier now put a $202 million price tag on it.\nTriangle Petroleum was down 71.7 percent, Ascent Solar Technology was off 67.1 percent, Bill Barrett Corp. lost 61.6 percent of its value, and so on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T14:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:35:48.948+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
