League spokesman Michael Signora says in a statement emailed Monday that \"an error by the clock operator\" after a touchback allowed extra time to run off, and \"it is the responsibility of the side judge to supervise the timing of the game.\" The statement adds: \"Had the side judge or any of the other six on-field officials noticed the timing error, they could have corrected it.\" The NFL will review the work done by the clock operator and game officials. ___ AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:58:52.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
