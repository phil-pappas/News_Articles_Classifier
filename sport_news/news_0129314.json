Lucas leads the Cardinals with 219 digs this season. The Cardinals are going into Saturday’s NHS Cardinal Invitational with a full head of steam, winning six of their last nine matches. By Jocelyn Sheets Newton Daily News \nNewton High’s Cardinals have picked up momentum as they head into Saturday’s Newton High Cardinal Invitational volleyball tournament. The Cardinals have gone 6-3 over the span of a week. \nThe Cardinals are coming off an emotional, come-from-behind win at home against Grinnell. Newton won the final three sets of the best-of-five match to net its first win in Little Hawkeye Conference play since the 2013 season. The Cardinals were winless in LHC in 2014. \n“We’re going into it with a lot of confidence in ourselves as a team. We’re working to win it,” Newton senior libero Fran Lucas said. Lucas is ranked 11th in Class 4A for digs, leading the Cardinals with 219 digs. \nTuesday, Newton evened its overall record to 14-14 with the win over Grinnell. The Cardinals have doubled their match wins from a year ago. \nTwo other big factors for the Cardinals going into Saturday’s tournament are — Cardinal head coach Laura Sherratt will be back at the helm, and it is Dig Pink for breast cancer awareness. Sherratt has not coached a match this season because of maternity leave. She said she would be coaching the Cardinal practice Friday and returns to coaching full-time Saturday. \nAction begins Saturday at 8:30 a.m. There are two four-team pools. Teams in Pool A, which are Newton, Des Moines North, Class 2A’s third-ranked Eddyville-Blakesburg-Fremont, and Boone, play in the NHS upper gym. Pool B — Carlisle, Class 4A third-ranked Harlan, Class 4A 13th-ranked Pella and Ottumwa — will be in the NHS lower gym. \nAdmission is $6 for adults and $4 for students. \nThe top two teams in each pool advance to championship pool matches to be played in the upper gym. The bottom two teams in each pool advance to consolation pool play in the NHS lower gym. \nThere is a 30-minute break between the conclusion of pool play and start of championship-consolation round matches. \nHarlan is going for its fifth consecutive Cardinal Invitational championship. Harlan beat EBF in last year’s championship match. Newton finished sixth in the tournament a year ago. \nNewton opens pool play against Des Moines North at 8:30 a.m. on court No. 1. The Cardinals take on EBF on court No. 2 in the second round then finish pool play against Boone on court No. 1. \nJuniors Megan Pressgrove and Kaytlin Ahn lead the net attack for the Cardinals with 130 kills and 120 kills, respectively. Ahn had 10 solo blocks and nine assisted blocks while Pressgrove had put up three solo blocks and has 18 assisted blocks. Junior Morgan Allen has seven solo blocks and 24 assisted blocks. \nTaylor Shipley, another junior, and Pressgrove lead the team in set assists. Shipley is second to Pressgrove, who has 171, with 165 set assists. Shipley also has delivered 64 kills. Senior Emily Fitzgerald has 49 kills and senior Allison Ergenbright gas 13 block assists and three solo blocks. \nAs a team, Newton is serving at a 79-percent clip and has 115 ace serves. Pressgrove tops the ace serve list with 23 followed by Fran Lucas with 22, Ahn with 21, sophomore Audrey Lucas with 17 and Fitzgerald with 10. Senior Adrienne Bergman is the top server, going 79-of-85 at the service line for 93 percent and delivering six aces. \n“We’re excited about Saturday’s tournament. We want to keep this momentum up,” Fran Lucas said, following Tuesday’s home win. \nFans are reminded it is Dig Pink and to wear pink to support the Cardinal volleyball team’s effort to raise funds for breast cancer awareness and its effort to win its home tournament. \nContact Jocelyn Sheets at 641-792-3121 ext. 6535 or jsheets@newtondailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:10:08.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
