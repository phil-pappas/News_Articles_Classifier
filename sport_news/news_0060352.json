The Mets won 8-3 to advance to the World Series. CHICAGO – As soon as Lucas Duda’s three-run homer cleared the center-field wall in the first inning, a three-hour coronation began at Wrigley Field.\nOver 27 outs spanning nine innings, the Mets worked toward a designation they had not received in 15 years, a time remembered more for its failures than successes.\nAt 11:39 p.m., Wednesday, when Jeurys Familia struck out Dexter Fowler, the coronation became official. The Mets are the National League champions, and headed to the World Series, which begins Tuesday.\nThe Mets completed the sweep of the Cubs with an 8-3 win in Game 4 of the NLCS. They won the National League pennant for the fifth time in franchise history, and their first since 2000.\nFamilia fell to his knees after fanning Fowler.\nDaniel Murphy set the postseason mark with his sixth straight game with a homer, and Duda tied the franchise mark with five RBI in this clincher.\nIt took a combination of patience and urgency from the front office to end this franchise’s 14-season World Series drought, and the results of those approaches were displayed in a Mets team that dismantled the Cubs.\nThe Mets outscored Chicago, 21-8, in this series.\nThe patience part of the plan lied in the team’s collection of arms that took years to accumulate, and made the Cubs’ potent lineup look like a Class AAA lineup.\nAs the Cubs were forced to toss Jason Hammel, whose elimination game performances matched Kevin Brown’s infamous outing for the Yankees from 2004, the Mets turned to Steven Matz.\nWhile Matz only lasted 4 2/3 innings, he allowed just one run, and the relievers – aside from Tyler Clippard – did a fantastic job to never allow the Cubs back in the game.\nThe urgency came through in the offensive success. Mets executives knew they needed to upgrade the lineup at the trade deadline, and made the necessary moves, with the main acquisition Yoenis Cespedes. The trades transformed a once feeble lineup into one of the game’s best.\nDuda, who entered the night 3-for-24 in the postseason, hit a 3-2 fastball to deep center to give the Mets a 3-0 lead. One batter later, Travis d’Arnaud made it back-to-back homers when he took Hammel’s 0-1 offering over the wall in right field for a 4-0 lead.\nThe Mets set a franchise mark for postseason homers this fall.\nOne inning later, Duda hit a two-run double to give the Mets a 6-0 lead, and it marked the fifth time a Mets player has accomplished the feat.\nOnce the Mets had that 6-0 lead, it was a slow, non-dramatic march to the game’s end. The Cubs scored a run in the fourth to slice the deficit to 6-1, but Murphy hit his seventh homer of this postseason – a two-run shot – in the eighth to give the Mets an 8-1 lead.\nThis team had mostly been projected before the season to finish second-best in the NL East, and, if everything broke right, perhaps they may be a wild-card team.\nFor more than half the year, it appeared this might be their fate. Injuries to David Wright and Travis d’Arnaud hampered the lineup, and it negated countless stellar pitching outings. The Mets then made their trades, and transformed into one of baseball’s elite offenses.\nIn an electric weekend at Citi Field in late July/early August, the Mets tied the Nationals atop the NL East, and led the division each day beginning Aug. 3.\nIn the NLDS, the Mets bested the Dodgers’ duo of Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke in five games. In this round, they tamed the Cubs’ young hitters, and beat Jake Arrieta.\nA new flag will fly high at Citi Field now, a remembrance for this night.\nNine years after Carlos Beltran struck out against Adam Wainwright to end the Mets’ last attempt to reach the World Series, the Mets are once again National League champions.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:29:54.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
