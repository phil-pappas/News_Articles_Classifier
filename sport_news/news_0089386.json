The Lewiston Tribune reports that on Wednesday the board approved extending alcohol sales at Boise State University and University of Idaho football games for the rest of this year's playing season. However, BSU's request to permit alcohol sales at pregame basketball events failed 5-3. Board member Richard Westerberg says he thinks the board is sending mixed messages. He added that the board should re-evaluate approving any alcohol sales on college campuses once the football season ends. Alcohol sales at football games were first permitted by the board in June. Before, alcohol service was only approved for corporate sponsors and their guests.
