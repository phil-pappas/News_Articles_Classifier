Now he’s angling for a move to Real Madrid, according to multiple outlets in Spain and France, who reportedly see him as a replacement for either Cristiano Ronaldo or Gareth Bale. Hazard himself even liked an Instagram post linking him with a move away.\nThat, obviously, won’t come as good news to Chelsea fans, but it’s actually not as bad as it sounds. In fact, for practically all parties involved, this hypothetical transfer could make a lot of sense.\nEden Hazard Eden Hazard wants to attack from the left wing and not much else. When he does that at Chelsea he’s berated by his manager for not defending and mercilessly hacked-down by opposing defenders when he goes forward. Hazard is the most-fouled player in the Premier League and doesn’t get that much relative protection from referees. There’s a reason small, flair players like Hazard tend to leave England towards the peak of their careers, and it’s because in a less-physical league like Spain, he’ll be able to express himself more.\nJose Mourinho\nEden Hazard is an incredible talent, but he’s not really the kind of player the defense-minded Mourinho likes at his disposal. He doesn’t want superstars who distract from the team — it proved at issue when he was the manager at Real Madrid, and he never boasted a Cristiano Ronaldo-esque superstar at Inter Milan, Porto or during his first stint at Chelsea. If Chelsea could sell Hazard at a big price, Mourinho might be quietly happy to pursue a cheaper, less high-profile, more tactically disciplined replacement.\nCristiano Ronaldo/Gareth Bale If Hazard comes to Real Madrid, one of Ronaldo or Gareth Bale would have to leave. If it’s Ronaldo, he’d simply jump to a club for one final mega-payday as his career starts to decline. If it’s Bale, who’s been perpetually unappreciated at Real Madrid, he’d sign a massive contract at a club like Manchester United, where he could be the star without living in Ronaldo’s shadow.\nReal Madrid Money isn’t really an object for Real Madrid, and there’s been tension brewing between Ronaldo and Bale. Ronaldo is also about to turn 31, so the club does need to start planning for life without him. If they can shift one of those players and bring in a high-profile player like Hazard to usher-in a new, more unified era, they’d probably be quite pleased\nChelsea Chelsea as a whole probably stand to gain the least from losing a big name like Hazard. Still, it’s not all bad. It would allow Mourinho to build his Chelsea dynasty by giving him the freedom to construct the squad he wants, and the club will undoubtedly get a huge amount of money for him.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Article/Hazard-chelsea-rupture-consommee/59535", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HztHffLCOVA", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T19:42:44.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
