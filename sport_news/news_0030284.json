The University of Maine coach hopes his players have grown weary of it as well. \nThe Black Bears gave up 176 passing yards in the second half of a victory over Rhode Island two weeks ago, and were burned for 319 yards in a blowout loss at Richmond last week. MAINE (1-3, 1-1 CAA) AT ALBANY (2-3, 1-1) \nWHERE : Bob Ford Field, Albany, N.Y. \nKICKOFF : 3:30 p.m. Saturday \nWHEN MAINE HAS THE BALL : If quarterback Dan Collins is to guide the Black Bears to their first road win, he’ll need to avoid interceptions. He has thrown four in three road losses; Albany’s defense has picked off opposing QBs eight times. Maine generated only 123 passing yards last year in a 20-7 home loss to the Great Danes. \nWHEN ALBANY HAS THE BALL: Redshirt freshman running back Elliot Croskey has picked up 385 yards and three touchdowns this season and will be vital to Albany’s efforts to establish a ground game, something Richmond was able to do last week in a 48-17 wipeout of Maine. The Great Danes start underclassmen at all of the skill positions, and were shut out last week at Holy Cross. \nKEY MATCHUP : Maine cornerback Sherrod Baltimore vs. Albany wide receiver Brad Harris. Harris leads the Great Danes with 276 receiving yards and, at 6-foot-3, is 5 inches taller than Baltimore. But Baltimore is a senior, Harris a sophomore, and the Black Bears will need their best defensive back to win this matchup. \nKEY STAT : 319. That’s how many passing yards Maine surrendered to Richmond, a number that needs to be significantly lower if the Black Bears are to beat Albany. \nOUTLOOK : Maine gets middle linebacker Christophe Mulumba Tshimanga back from a leg injury, and he will help settle things on defense. Both offenses have been struggling, so this shapes up as a low-scoring affair, with Maine’s secondary being the biggest wild card. If they stop Albany sophomore quarterback D.J. Crook (817 yards, 6 touchdowns), the Black Bears should prevail. \nOF NOTE : Maine will be minus starting rover linebacker Cabrinni Goncalves, out with an undisclosed injury. \nDID YOU KNOW?

And we’ve been outjumped or outplayed for the ball,” Cosgrove said. “They’re almost unsound to put the ball up in the air in a one-on-one like that because it’s a 50-50 ball. It could go the other way. And that’s what we’re trying to tell our players – that ball is your ball.” \nThe biggest problem for Maine has been breaking in newcomers at safety , with starter Darrius Hart and key reserve Mozai Nelson both lost for the season because of injuries. Jason Matovu and Sinmisola Demuren are the starters, with Spencer Carey and Jeffrey DeVaughn the backups. All are seeing action for the first time this season. \nDemuren was beaten twice for touchdowns against Richmond on “double moves,” when the wide receiver took a step to the corner of the end zone but headed for the post instead, then did the opposite the next time. \nNone of this is sitting well with cornerback Sherrod Baltimore , the lone senior in the secondary. \n“It’s embarrassing, honestly. Any time you lose it hurts, but 48 (points), it’s like, damn,” Baltimore said. “I don’t want to keep hearing that’s the moral of the story, we’re young. That’s not going to keep being the excuse. Ain’t no excuse when you lose. Nobody cares.” \nBaltimore intercepted two passes against Rhode Island but dropped two potential picks at Richmond. So he’s blaming himself as much as anyone for what happened last week, when the Spiders threw for four touchdowns despite steady rain. \nThis week, he said the defensive backs made it a point to get into the film room earlier and to improve their communication. Cosgrove planned to conduct more drills where a receiver and a defensive back battle for a pass, particularly on “back shoulder” throws. \nBaltimore wants to restore the safeties’ confidence. \n“I was on them at first so it wouldn’t get to this point, where we had to lose, they had to catch passes on them,” he said. “I’m not saying losing is a good thing, but this could wake them up.” \nIt should help that Maine is unlikely to see a pair of wide receivers as good as Richmond’s the rest of the season. Albany suspended wideout Josh Gontarek, last year’s CAA rookie of the year, Sept. 30 after a marijuana arrest. The Great Danes then were skunked 37-0 at Holy Cross last Saturday. Sophomore Brad Harris and freshmen Jordan Crockett and Zee Roberson are the starting wide receivers. \n“I don’t think anything’s working right now (in the passing game),” Albany Coach Greg Gattuso said. “People are loading up to stop our running game, and I don’t blame them. We’ve got to try to keep the defense at least honest a little bit, and we haven’t been able to do that because they don’t respect our passing game.” \nSophomore D.J. Crook is a first-year starter at quarterback for Albany. \nBaltimore likes the matchup. \n“We can get physical with them,” he said. \nOpposite Baltimore at cornerback is sophomore Najee Goode , who inherited the No. 1 that Axel Ofori Jr. wore in past seasons. Goode got into 10 games last year as Ofori’s backup and is playing with much more confidence this season. Cosgrove sees a future star. \nGoode sees passes that he should have intercepted. He has been credited with two pass breakups, but no picks. He relishes the chance to play press coverage and, like Baltimore, vowed that better days are ahead for his picked-upon unit. \n“We’re going to see the same type routes (as against Richmond),” Goode said. “It’s going to give us another chance to redeem ourselves. It’s in everybody’s head for sure. We don’t want to be the reason why we lost. We want to stand out and be the reason why we win games.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:13:52.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
