While it can be a harmless response to stress or emotional upset, or caused by interactions among medications, it can also be a sign of serious and even life-threatening health issues.\nJournal Report Insights from The Experts Read more at WSJ.com/Encore More in Encore: The New Retirement To Age Better, Avoid Stereotypes About Aging Keep Your Bonds Safe Men Seeking Friends Stay ‘Fast After 50’ Boost Your Brain Power If patients haven’t cracked their head open or otherwise injured themselves in a fall, they may be discharged from the emergency room without a clear diagnosis of what caused them to pass out. But many are admitted to the hospital for further workups, which account for about 6% of all hospital admissions and costs the health system an estimated $2 billion annually.\nNew Guidelines Over the years, a number of guidelines have been published by researchers and medical societies to help doctors evaluate and manage patients with syncope. Cardiology groups are now in the process of updating guidelines with newer evidence. The aim is to help ER doctors avoid admitting patients to the hospital when it isn’t necessary, without missing a more serious condition and sending patients home who then have a stroke, heart attack or other potentially fatal illness.\n“Patients may come to the emergency room saying they’ve blacked out, but they may not remember details or there may not have been any witnesses, so it can be very tricky for an ER doctor,” says David G. Benditt, a cardiologist and researcher at the University of Minnesota who has been involved in developing guidelines for syncope. If patients are admitted to the hospital for further observation, they may be subjected to a battery of expensive tests such as MRIs and CT scans, “which mostly turn out to be of little diagnostic value,” he says.\nOne approach is to evaluate patients in a special syncope management unit, or so-called rapid-access blackout clinic. At the University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis, ER nurses may send patients for a follow-up visit to a heart clinic where Dr. Benditt sees syncope patients. About half of the time, in-depth conversations with patients and families about their medical history and symptoms make it possible to arrive at a diagnosis, Dr. Benditt says, so it is important for patients to provide as much detailed information as possible.\nA common type of fainting known as vasovagal syncope can happen when the body overreacts to stressors such as the sight of blood or severe emotional upset. A sudden drop in heart rate and blood pressure can reduce blood flow to the brain and cause a brief loss of consciousness. Fainting can also be caused by a form of low blood pressure that happens to some people who stand up after sitting or lying down, known as orthostatic or postural hypotension.\nSimple Fixes Doctors may suggest simple fixes such as physical maneuvers that help counter the fainting response, including crossing the legs and tensing muscles or practicing standing with the back against a wall without moving for 20 minutes three or four times a week.\nENLARGE Researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston developed guidelines known as the Boston Syncope Criteria in 2007, identifying as many as 25 factors that put patients at increased risk for adverse outcomes within 30 days. That has helped the hospital safely reduce admissions, while identifying patients who might benefit from a hospital stay of up to 24 hours for observation.\n“Most syncope doesn’t mean something ominous,” says Shamai Grossman, an author of the Boston guidelines who is director of observation medicine in the department of emergency medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess. He says he has had patients who pass out every time blood is drawn, and treated one patient who would pass out every time he laughed too hard.\nBut a history of cardiac disease such as a prior heart attack or abnormal heart rhythms is generally a worrisome sign. “If you’ve already had damage to the body’s electrical system, those are generally an automatic admission for evaluation,” Dr. Grossman says.\nA study he co-wrote, published in the American Journal of Emergency Medicine in August, identified several risk factors that can be used to predict how long patients might stay in the hospital. Those who had clear vasovagal syncope—passing out from a blood draw or bad news—generally had less than one day in the hospital, while abnormal heart rhythms, coronary artery disease, abnormal vital signs such as heart rate, an implantable defibrillator, anemia, gastrointestinal bleeding and nervous system abnormalities were predictors of longer lengths of stay.\nAvoiding Returns Dr. Grossman says his team is now studying how to best care for ER observation patients with syncope “to keep them from coming back and further curtail the need for hospitalization even in patients who may previously have required lengthy hospital admissions.”\nIn one syncope case used for a coming textbook on geriatric emergencies, doctors discussed a 76-year-old man who fainted in a restaurant while dining with his family, initially complaining of nausea. When he stood up to go to the restroom, he immediately fell backward and was unconscious for one minute. His medical history included high blood pressure, high cholesterol and depression, and he was on three medications to treat the conditions. He had been briefly admitted to the hospital with chest pains in the past but was told he didn’t have a heart problem.\nPreviously in Health Matters Preparing for Trip Trouble (June 2015) Grown-Ups Need Shots, Too (March 2015) Age and Malnutrition (January 2015) What to Expect From Surgery (October 2014) At the emergency room, his vital signs were normal, and his blood tests and physical exam showed nothing remarkable. He felt even better after being administered a liter of fluids. He was admitted for observation, where he got more fluids and tests, including an electrocardiogram, and placed on heart monitors. He felt better after 16 hours, had a meal and was able to walk, then sent home with a diagnosis of either vasovagal syncope or orthostatic syncope, the type preceded by standing. An outpatient stress test was set up with his primary-care doctor to make sure he was followed for any developing issues.\nWhile some doctors commenting on the case said they might have done other tests to see if problems with his heart or medications might be causing the faint because of his age, Dr. Grossman says patients over 65 who are otherwise healthy and have no cardiac risk factors are at no greater risk than anyone else for a bad outcome following syncope. “If it doesn’t look like anything worrisome,” he says, “they should be able to go home.”\nER teams are also focusing on ensuring that patients get a timely follow-up visit with a doctor or clinic after discharge. “We tell patients this was the first part of your evaluation, and the rest of it can be completed safely elsewhere tommorow,” says Brian J. Browne, chairman of the Department of Emergency Medicine at the University of Maryland Medical Center.\nMs. Landro is a Wall Street Journal assistant managing editor in New York and writes the Informed Patient column.
