Tennessee will visit Bryant-Denny Stadium at 2:30 p.m. CT Saturday. Before that, the Nick Saban radio show will provide one final glimpse inside the action.\nWe'll have all the important updates once he arrives around 7 p.m. Refresh the page for the latest. Greg McElroy is the media guest and Chris Stewart is pinch hitting for Eli Gold as the host.\nSegment 4\n-- Saban said all the best games have been on the road this year. He wants positive vibes in Bryant-Denny Stadium at 2:30 Saturday afternoon.\n-- They practiced with extra noise for the defense so they could be used to it like the offense does for road games.\nSegment 3\n-- On Eddie Jackson: Saban said he was always an \"instinctive player.\" He didn't have the same burst after tearing his ACL last spring, so they moved him to safety. He was apprehensive at first but it's worked very well.\n-- Does Saban have a funny story about McElroy? Saban said McElroy was the opposite of \"energy vampires.\" He always did everything right, was a good example to teammates. \"This is the kind of guy you win championships with,\" Saban said.\n-- Does Saban educate new players on rivalry? He said Scott Cochran does it. \"He's a little bit out there,\" Saban said. He fills the players in on the traditions and rivalries. Read more on Cochran .\n-- Saban said he didn't envision the growth of the university in his nine years here. He gives the credit to Robert Witt, then president of the university, and late AD Mal Moore.\n-- Any plan to use Minkah Fitzpatrick on offense? Doesn't sound like it, long answer short.\n-- How about Calvin Ridley's development? Saban said he got fast-tracked when Robert Foster got hurt. They were going to move him along slower before that. He's a mature guy. Like Fitzpatrick, he doesn't act like a freshman. \"They don't go rat trap on you in the game.\"\n-- New to practice this year: A 3-minute intense period of good-on-good attacking the ball. It's made a big difference on both sides of the ball. The idea started with a conversation with Cowboys coach Jason Garrett, a Saban assistant with the Miami Dolphins.\nSegment 2\n-- They sang happy birthday to Saban a week early since there's no show next week. It took Saban three blows to get all the candles on his birthday cake.\n-- On Reggie Ragland: Saban said it really clicked 1/3 way through last season. He was always an outside LB but they needed him at middle LB. He has the record of 26 production points (graded when coaches grade film).\n-- Asked about Jake Coker's dislike for sliding, Saban said he doesn't want to change his competitive spirit, but he has to be smart about it. He wants Coker to run it in an \"intelligent way.\"\n-- Saban said people should respect Tennessee. The Vol offense is very good, Joshua Dobbs is a great QB with two \"really good\" running backs. Saban said Vols could easily be undefeated.\nSegment 1\n-- Saban was running a little late, but he's here now.\n-- Most encouraging statement Saban uses? He said the team has played very well at times but it loses focus on occasion (like late first half, early second at Texas A&M). So he's been driving home \"feelings and choices.\" You have to make a choice about how much focus you bring to the situation.\n-- McElroy going for points, telling Saban he looks younger and younger ever year.\n-- Saban returns the favor, telling the former QB he was one of the big parts of the program who bought in \"when we weren't any good.\"\n-- Peewee from Grand Bay is the first caller once again. Saban wants to know how he thinks J.C. Hassenauer looked. Peewee said he looked a little shaky at first but got better. Saban said the backup center played \"decently.\"\n-- Saban said Texas A&M was the only place Alabama's been where they weren't booed. He was very impressed with the atmosphere with 105,000 people in Kyle Field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:20:55.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
