Their every move is covered, digested, talked and written about.\nThe slightest injury is worthy of headlines, and when the manager announces that his catcher is not injured, that makes big news. \nSuddenly, we know (and deeply care about) the back-up catcher's dad (who works for the Blue Jays). Who's inoculated against chicken pox? We reported that. We can't get enough of of the players wives and kids. Heck, the friends of their wives and kids are interviewed.\nIn short, a Royal Blue tidal wave has struck this region of the United States.\nNormally, this would be a cause for major concern for the other teams in our area. In the battle for coveted air-time and newspaper space, Royals news is a slam-dunk winner.\nNews about the Chiefs, Jayhawks, Wildcats and Tigers is squeezed off the front page, and all but nonexistent on TV sportscasts.\nThat is perfectly alright for athletic officials at our three major colleges and for Chiefs P.R. executives.\nThanks to the Royals, very few of us are focusing major attention on the season put up by those teams.\nWhile the Royals were clinching the home field advantage, eliminating the Astros and taking a two-games to none lead over Toronto, the Chiefs have lost five straight games, and stand 1 and 5 on the season. Missouri has lost three of their last four games, and stand 1-3 in the SEC play. Kansas State has dropped three straight, and is 0-3 in Big-12 play. And KU is 0-6 on the season.\nNormally, this would warrant a major investigation. (I can only imagine what Jason Whitlock would write, but it would be fun to read).\nChiefs Coach Andy Reid would be closely questioned at his weekly press conferences (Does Alex Smith really give you your best chance to win?), and his every move would be scrutinized and questioned.\nSunday's loss at Minnesota featured a 4th down and 1 play where the Chiefs running back was whistled down short of the first down line. The Chiefs argued, and the replays appear to agree, that the runner was not down. \nThree years ago, this would have sparked outrage from Chiefs fans all over the country, but when the Chiefs are so clearly out of the AFC West race, the poor call attracted barely a murmur. I only counted two questions about the ref's ruling during Coach Reid's postgame press conference. \nPerhaps the fact that almost all the city's major reporters and commentators are focused on the Royals plays a role in that.\nThe same goes for the three college programs.\nSaturday, Kansas State was cold-cocked by Oklahoma 55-0. It is the worst loss of Bill Snyder's K-State career. A big crowd filled Bill Snyder Family Stadium, with millions more watching on regional television, but we haven't heard much about the blow-out over the past few days.\nMissouri continued to struggle offensively in their 9-6 loss at Georgia. This is usually followed by the \"anti-Gary Pinkel\" crowd venting their frustrations, but the airwaves have been largely silent.\nKansas actually showed some fight in their loss to Texas Tech, but that does not erase the Jayhawks' issues, which are deep and serious. But, don't expect Kansas fans to mutiny, and if they do, it wouldn't get much coverage.\nOf course, there's no real reason for the college fans to overreact. All three schools are playing missing their starting quarterbacks (in fact KSU and KU are playing 3rd or 4th-string guys at QB). Bill Snyder's best offensive game plan won't work if his QB can't make the plays. Missouri is clearly a team in transition, with injures at running back and the offensive line, and a suspension at quarterback, holding their offense in check. The Tigers will be a lot better next season.\nAnd, as ugly as KU's season has been, they appear to be getting better under first-year coach David Beatty. Saturday's game was proof. After falling behind, KU rode the passing of true freshman Ryan Willis to make the game interesting.\nThe Bishop Miege grad's 350-yard effort tied a school record, and gives his coaches and teammates hope that the program might have another prospect at QB.\nThe Chiefs are another story.\nAndy Reid and GM John Dorsey are not beloved and respected like Bill Snyder.  Theyr haven't won back to back division titles like Gary Pinkel. They aren't in year-one of a difficult rebuilding job like KU's David Beatty. They can't point to graduation rates or future recruiting as signs of progress.\nNFL coaches and GMs are hired to do one thing: win football games.\nAfter that incredible 9-0 start in their first year, Reid/Dorsey's team has gone 12-18. While that's not good, the Chiefs have not been truly bad. Until this year.\nSo, while our football teams have floundered in recent weeks (an 0-6 record), their failures are drowned out by this thrilling Blue October.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
