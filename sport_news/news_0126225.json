The senior attempted just five passes but completed all five for 225 yards and five touchdowns covering 43, 38, 29, 65 and 50 yards. For good measure, he completed three two-point conversions.\nDEFENSE\nTelly Crawford, KIPP: The senior safety was instrumental in KIPP's 58-6 victory over Middleton on Friday, returning two interceptions for touchdowns. Crawford's returns covered 56 and 50 yards — both in the second quarter — as the Phoenix held Middleton to just 51 passing yards. He now has five interceptions for the season.\nNominations: Coaches can nominate candidates for Player of the Week by emailing john.varlas@commercialappeal.com.
