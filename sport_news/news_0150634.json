He also is the defending 6A South Region and Coastal Conference champion.\nStiff competition\nPrincess Anne’s Doria Martingayle finished runner-up at the Group 5A state meet and won the 5A South Region and Atlantic Conference titles last season as a sophomore. But to win a state title she has to outrun George Marshall’s Heather Holt, who beat her by 22 seconds last season in the state meet.\nMoving up\nKellam, which was competitive in 5A, moves up to 6A this season after another round of reclassification. It also makes Kellam senior Ryan Drew’s chances of winning a state title even tougher as he must run against Cox’s Jonathan Lomogda. Last season, Drew finished third at the 5A state meet. “If we were in 5A, Ryan would be contending for a state title,” said Kellam coach Bill Bernard. “But it’s going to be exciting with Jonathan and Ryan. Ryan is going to get better competition and it will be tougher to win a state title.”\nMoving down\nGreat Bridge is moving from Group 5A to 4A. The move should benefit the Wildcats, who now will compete in Conference 17. Coach Bill Volkman said the Wildcats are the team to beat on paper: “The boys have worked very hard this summer and I expect all that hard work to pay off in the end. We’ll see what happens.”\nGreat expectations\nLast season Hickory finished third at the Group 5A state meet but coach Jud Sarver is thinking bigger this season. The Hawks are led by senior Kailyn Gyuricsko and sophomore Jodi Tolarchyk. Tolarchyk last season was runner-up at the Atlantic Conference meet, sixth at the 5A South Region meet and fourth at in the state. Gyuricsko was third at conference, ninth at region and 16th at the state meet. Maddie Eason, Bela Melendez, Kate Miller, Jessica Hibler and Abbie LeFevre give the Hawks depth.\n___\nTOP BOYS TEAMS IN SOUTH HAMPTON ROADS\n1. Ocean Lakes\nThe Dolphins lack a top runner but have incredible depth as 37 athletes are competing for the top five spots. “We will be led by a very equal senior foursome of Lance Sheridan, Drew Park, Ryan Schleicher and Logan Sawyer,” Ocean Lakes coach Mike Nestor said. The Dolphins have won nine Beach District or Coastal Conference titles in a row. They also are the defending 6A South Region champions.\n2. Cox\nThe Falcons return one of the nation’s top runners in Jonathan Lomogda, who finished third at the Group 6A state meet last season. They also have junior David Scherrer, who finished seventh in the region, along with six freshmen who ran under 5:15 in the 1,600 last year.\n3. Kellam\nThe Knights return four of their top five runners led by Ryan Drew (fourth at 5A state meet) and senior Christian McDonald, a state qualifier. And they have sophomore Jack Kirschner, senior Jonah Anderson and sophomore John Mikovitz.\n4. Hickory\nThe Hawks are the favorites for the Atlantic Conference title because of their depth, which has been lacking in recent seasons. Leading the way is senior Jarrell Hibler, runner-up at last year’s conference meet. Others include Cameron Riedy, Tyler Lefevre, Will Gamberg, Dylan McCormick and Chad Brown.\n5. Great Bridge\nThe Wildcats are led by senior Dayton Pack and junior Alex Belin, third and seventh, respectively, at the PenSouth Conference meet. They also welcome sophomore Johnny Chasnet, a first-year runner, and freshman Caleb Mincheff. Coach Bill Volkman thinks both have a chance to be special runners.\n___\nTOP GIRLS TEAMS IN SOUTH HAMPTON ROADS\n1. Ocean Lakes\nThe Dolphins are lead by all-state candidates Rachel Boyce and junior Madeleine King. King won the 6A South Region last season and was eighth at state. They also have Ashley Cooper, Natalie Kubicki, Lauren Nery, Morgan Will, Hannah Saunders and Laura Grabarcyzk. The girls have won either the Beach District or Coastal Conference title the past seven seasons.\n2. Hickory\nSenior Hannah Glasgow – eighth at the 5A state meet – is injured and will not compete this season. But coach Jud Sarver thinks the Hawks will still be strong even without her. They are led by senior Kailyn Gyuricsko and sophomore Jodi Tolarchyk. Maddie Eason, Bela Melendez, Kate Miller, Jessica Hibler and Abbie LeFevre give the Hawks plenty of depth.\n3. Kellam\nThe Knights are young and talented, led by sophomores Eileen Vedder and Taylor Jones both 5A state qualifiers and top-five finishers in the Atlantic Conference. Coach Bill Bernard predicts this will be a breakout year for both runners.\n4. Princess Anne\nThe Cavaliers are led by junior Doria Martingayle, who last season finished runner-up at the 5A state meet. The Cavaliers will get help from sophomore Kasey Sutryk and seniors Emma Jennings and Maggie Marshall, who was runner-up at the conference meet.\n5. Great Bridge\nWildcats coach Bill Volkman is excited about the upcoming season. Juniors Ally Jones and Carley Hill finished 16th and 19th, respectively, at the PenSouth Conference meet. Also watch for sophomore Abby Oliphant, who has the potential to be very good.\n___\nAROUND THE COURSE\nCox returns five of its top seven girls runners.
