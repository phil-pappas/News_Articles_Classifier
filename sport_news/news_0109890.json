(Photo: Troy Babbitt-USA TODAY Sports) \nThe Wolf Pack football team host Hawaii at 1 p.m. Saturday on the Mountain West Network. Here's a breakdown of the game. \nHawaii (2-5, 0-3 MW) at Nevada (3-4, 1-2) \nWhen: 1 p.m., Saturday \nWhere: Mackay Stadium (capacity, 30,000) \nTV/Radio: None/94.5 FM \nLine: Nevada favored by 7.5 \nLast week: Nevada lost to Wyoming; Hawaii lost to New Mexico Week in 1,000 Words: Ghost of Chris Ault haunts Pack \nPosition-by-position \nQuarterback: Max Wittek, who missed last week’s game with a knee injury, is expected to start for Hawaii. The USC transfer has talent, but he hits on only 44.9 percent of his passes and has more picks than touchdowns. Nevada’s Tyler Stewart is coming off a career-best 287-yard game. Edge: Nevada \nRunning backs: Hawaii’s Paul Harris (421 yards, 5.5 ypc, three TDs) has put together a nice season, but Hawaii doesn’t have much depth here. Nevada’s Don Jackson and James Butler have to set the tone for the Wolf Pack. They rush for 258.7 yards/game in wins and 114.8 yards/game in losses. Edge: Nevada \nWide receivers/tight end: For Hawaii, Quinton Pedroza, a Utah transfer, is expected to miss the game with injury, leaving Dylan Collie (21/276/1) and Marcus Kemp (20/325/2) as the top targets. Nevada’s Jerico Richardson has been consistent and Wyatt Demps is coming off his best game. Edge: Nevada \nOffensive line: Nevada coach Brian Polian said Hawaii’s offensive line is greatly improved, but the unit still averages just 3.3 yards per rush and has allowed 16 sacks. Wolf Pack OG Jeremy Macauley (knee) is expected to play 40 snaps, which should help the line, which is coming off a down game. Edge: Nevada RGJ writer Chris Murray breaks down Nevada's game against Hawaii and predicts who will win. Chris Murray/RGJ \nDefensive line: Nevada’s line was dominant two weeks ago and bad last week, so it depends which group shows up. Hawaii runs a three-man front led by Kennedy Tulimasealii (2.5 sacks, 8.5 TFL, 35 tackles), who Nevada must contain. Hawaii has held teams to 4.3 yards per rush. Edge: Hawaii \nLinebackers: Hawaii’s Jerrol Garcia-Williams (60 tackles), a Las Vegas native, is one of the MW’s top backers. Nevada’s Matt Lyons is on pace for 98 tackles and Jordan Dobrich is coming off back-to-back double-digit tackle games. Both are solid groups that don’t force many turnovers. Edge: Nevada \nSecondary: Marrell Jackson (50 tackles, three fumble recoveries) is an excellent safety. Hawaii’s secondary doesn’t have an interception this season. Nevada’s secondary did not play well against Wyoming, either in the pass or run game. This remains a vulnerability. Edge: Hawaii \nSpecial teams: Hawaii has been good in the punt game but vulnerable in kick coverage, allowing 28.7 yards per return. K Rigoberto Sanchez is 6-of-8 but missed a 22-yarder last week that basically would have won the game. Nevada’s group, led by K Brent Zuzo and P Alex Boy, is steady. Edge: Nevada \nCoaching: Norm Chow is very likely coaching his last season at Hawaii as he’s 10-34 overall and 4-23 in MW play in four seasons. He hasn’t been able to get Hawaii turned around. Nevada fans are down on coach Brian Polian and a loss here would add more ammunition to their anger. Edge: Nevada \nPrediction \nNevada 30, Hawaii 20: Good luck trying to predict how the Wolf Pack will play based on the last month of games. Nevada has been up and down and all around with little to no consistency at any position or in any facet of the game. Polian has challenged his players, specifically his seniors, and has called this game the team’s “Super Bowl.” If the team doesn’t respond to that, the season will basically be over. I get the feeling Nevada will come out with a much improved effort after the dud at Wyoming. It certainly helps the Wolf Pack is playing a Hawaii team that has struggled to score and a team coming off back-to-back trips to the mainland. Home field hasn’t been much of an advantage for Nevada the last two years, but I like the Wolf Pack to win this one and keep its faint West Division title hopes alive.
