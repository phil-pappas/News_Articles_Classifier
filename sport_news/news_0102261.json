In three years, the foundation has raised more than $200,000 and helped 76 people fighting breast cancer.\nBusch sponsor Mars hosted six of the champions — the others were not healthy enough to attend — in its suite overlooking Charlotte Motor Speedway's Turn 4 on Saturday night.\n“It’s neat to be able to help them out and give them a fresh breath of air and maybe even a fresh breath of life,” Kyle Busch told USA TODAY Sports. “Hopefully they can enjoy a great day of not having to worry about things and think about things, and just kind of let loose a little bit.”\nThe Pretty in Pink Foundation assists under-insured or uninsured patients with their medical costs, which include things like radiation treatments, chemotherapy and doctor visit co-pays.\nKyle and Samantha Busch founded the organization online a few years ago and reached out, saying they wanted to help.\n“Sometimes they get labeled as ‘breast cancer patients,’ but we want them to be able to go back to their other lives,” Samantha said. “They never worry about themselves; they always talk about how it affects their family or friends. To be able to give them some small peace of mind, that’s what’s special.”\nKyle, who will drive a pink M&M’s car in support of the foundation’s efforts at Charlotte, admittedly puts up more of an emotional wall than his wife (“My nature, for some reason, is I’m more of a business guy”). Samantha dives into the patients’ stories and has even befriended a handful of them on Facebook, a quality Kyle said makes them a good team.\nSamantha said she’s noticed a change in the demeanor of the patients she knows when they realize there’s $5,000 or so they no longer have to worry about with their treatments. And the annual visit with them often leaves her fighting back the tears.\n“It’s hard not to get choked up,” she said. “I try to keep it together for everybody.”\nSaid Kyle: \"We still hear from people we helped the first year. They send in letters and tell us how they’re doing better and life has changed for them. They feel like they got a fresh chance on life.\"\nFollow Gluck on Twitter @jeff_gluck\nPHOTOS: Behind the wheel with Kyle Busch\n© Peter Casey, USA TODAY Sports Peter Casey, USA TODAY Sports\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/jeff_gluck", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:56:06.305+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
