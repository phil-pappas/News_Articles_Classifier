(AP Photo/Carlos Osorio) By Justin Boggs Staff Writer \nWhile Ohio State remains the prohibitive favorite to win the College Football Playoff, despite losing a game earlier this season, Vegas oddsmakers give Michigan the fourth-best odds to win this year’s title. \nMichigan is not one of the 16 remaining undefeated teams eligible for this year's College Football Playoff. \nThe Wolverines are coming off a dominating 38-0 win over No. 13 Northwestern. This weekend, Michigan hosts No. 5 Michigan State in a battle that could decide the Big Ten’s East Division.Standing in Michigan’s and Michigan State’s ways later this year will be Ohio State, who defeated Maryland 49-28 Saturday. The Buckeyes have remained No. 1 in the major college football polls, even though OSU has struggled at times against relatively weak opposition. According to Bovada, Ohio State has the best odds of winning the College Football Playoff at 11-to-4 odds. Behind unbeaten Baylor and LSU is one-loss Michigan at 19-to-2 odds. Although Michigan State is unbeaten and has a noteworthy win against Oregon, Michigan State has the 10th best odds at 20-to-1. MSU’s odds took a tumble after the Spartans narrowly defeated Rutgers 31-24. Meanwhile, Michigan State’s ranking has dropped from No. 2 in the nation by three spots.Michigan, under first-year head coach Jim Harbaugh, has already matched its win total from 2014 when the Wolverines went 5-7. Since Michigan’s season opening 24-17 loss at now No. 4-ranked Utah. Since then, Michigan has outscored its opponents 160-14. Michigan also has a win over then No. 22-ranked BYU 31-0.Because of Michigan’s recent success, the Wolverines are consider an 8.5 point favorite over Michigan State this Saturday.
