Paced by Etowah’s 433 rushing yards, county teams averaged 209.7 yards on the ground and scored a combined 14 rushing touchdowns.Not only were team rushing totals up in Week 9, but there were also some strong individual performances, with six players breaking the 100-yard barrier.Individually, county-leading rusher Brittain Brown led the way again, carrying the ball 24 times for 274 yards, taking his season rushing total over 1,000 yards to 1,247. He also recorded rushing touchdowns 13, 14 and 15 on the season.His biggest runs came when the Warriors (4-3, 2-3 in Region 5 ) needed them the most. He scored on runs of 62 and 82 yards in the third quarter to tie the game at 21, but it was not enough as Cherokee fell to Milton 28-21.Also going over the 1,000-yard mark on Friday was Etowah’s Tyray Devezin. The junior rushed for 128 yards on 24 carries to up his season total to 1,029. He was not the only back rolling for the Eagles (7-1, 5-1 in Region 5 ). Trey Moore rushed for 125 yards on seven carries.The Eagles are used to running the ball well this season, but coach Dave Svehla said this week’s impressive numbers were a result of a team effort.“We’re predicated on running the football, and everyone knows that,” he said. “What I was most pleased with was the total effort. This was probably our most complete game with our guys up front, and I liked that our guys ran north and south. We didn’t try to bounce a lot out to the sideline. I thought we did a good job of staying inside and picking up tough yards, and I think our line did a good job of making that possible.”With both backs playing so well, Etowah was able to get away with completing just six passes on nine attempts, but, when the Eagles did throw, they still looked to Devezin and Moore. The duo combined to catch two thirds of Etowah’s completions, recording 75 of 100 total receiving yards.“I think running the ball really helps our passing game,” Svehla said. “If we run the ball in our offense our chances of throwing the ball well go up. It’s not always easy to run the ball against teams that know we’re going to, so I was just pleased we were able to do that and throw it when we needed to.” In addition to moving the ball for Etowah, Devezin and Moore also scored all five touchdowns. Devezin scored on runs of 71, 2, 4 and 42 yards in the first half to put the Eagles ahead, and Moore broke off a 71-yard scoring run in the third quarter to put the game away.Creekview (5-3, 4-1 in Region 7 (A)) freshman Cade Radam set a career high with 153 yards on 21 carries in the Grizzlies’ dramatic 38-35 come-from-behind victory over Sequoyah. He was at his best during the comeback, recording 111 of those yards in the second half.Coach Terry Crowder said Radam’s performance did more than help the offense score. He said it also played a big role in the two late interceptions that gave the Grizzlies a chance to win.“The more you can keep your defense on the sideline, the better,” he said. “Sequoyah was really wearing us down for a while, but Cade kept some drives going and kept our offense out there. He really gave our defense a chance to catch their breaths and get their feet back under them. That’s how they made those big plays at the end.”Radam was unable to get into the end zone on the ground, but he was a receiving weapon out of the backfield all night, catching six passes for 64 yards, including a 22-yard touchdown for the Grizzlies’ first score of the night.“When Cade is playing like that, it’s really big for us” Crowder said. “We’re really fortunate to have a freshman like Cade who can step right in and run in this offense. You also have to have great hands to play in our offense, and he showed he has that Friday night. He’s become a real weapon for us.” Matching him for most of the night was Sequoyah’s (2-5, 2-2 in Region 7 (A)) Trey Mitchell who rushed for a season-high 126 yards on 23 carries. Most of Mitchell’s yards were hard-fought, with only one carry going for more than 15 yards, but he took advantage of good field position and ran for three short touchdowns.Even a team that like to throw as much as Woodstock (4-4, 2-4 in Region 5 ) found success running the ball last week. It just had to do it on less carries.Senior Jerrail McMickens needed just seven carries to best 100 yards, finishing with 107 on the ground. The majority of his yards came on a 72-yard touchdown in the second quarter of the Wolverines’ 49-21 loss to Walton, but he was the lone rushing threat on a team that ran for a loss of 14 yards outside his production. Creekview and Etowah will be off next week, but the other four county teams will be back in action. Cherokee and Woodstock will fight for their playoff lives when the Warriors play at Lassiter and the Wolverines host region leading Roswell. Sequoyah will also be looking to earn a playoff spot when the Chiefs host Rome, while River Ridge (0-7, 0-4) will continue its pursuit of its first win when it receives a visit from Cass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:13:45.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
