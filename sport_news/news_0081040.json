They are still led by the veteran triumvirate of Patrice Bergeron, Tuukka Rask and Zdeno Chara.\nBut other, younger players — those who don’t own a 2011 Stanley Cup ring — will be pushing to make their mark and take ownership of this team. If the B’s are to evolve and become the kind of cohesive unit the team once was, that must happen.\nStill, many of the most important players who raised the Cup half a decade ago remain integral pieces to this puzzle, however jumbled it’s become after an offseason of change.\nHere’s a ranking of the 10 most important Bruins as the 2015-16 kicks off:\n1. Goalie\nTUUKKA RASK\nThe goalie is the most important player on every team, but Rask’s top level performance has become imperative to the Bruins’ success this season with the personnel on defense in transition and tweaks being applied to the breakouts. Growing pains are inevitable, and Rask must mitigate them.\n2. Center\nPATRICE BERGERON\nHe is the Bruins’ Mr. Everything. He kills penalties, he works the power play, and he is the soul of the team. Whenever Bergeron is out of the lineup, it drastically affects the product. Since the 2010-11 Stanley Cup season, he has been the team’s most consistent player.\n3. Defense\nZDENO CHARA\nChara is just one injury-filled season away from being a Norris Trophy runner-up, so even at the age of 38, it’s not too much of a stretch to think he can be a premier defenseman in this league again if healthy. But the fact that he got injured on his third shift of the preseason, however minor it may have been, is concerning.\n4. C DAVID KREJCI\nKrejci played just 46 games last season and he looked like himself in just a handful of them. You saw the result. This team is built on strength down the middle and whenever you take either of the top two centermen out of the mix, it drastically weakens the team. If Krejci can stay healthy, that improves the Bruins’ chances of making the playoffs exponentially.\n5. LW BRAD MARCHAND\nHis well-deserved reputation as an agitator not only precedes him, it clouds the perception of just who he is. And he is a highly skilled player who performs well in all three zones and does not take shifts off. He and Bergeron are the only proven, reliable forward combo the B’s have to start the season.\n6. RW DAVID PASTRNAK\nPastrnak is a long way from reaching his potential, and he must put the work in to get there. He is the most dynamic offensive talent the B’s have, but he’s still just 19. He’s still learning what he can try in the NHL and what’s best left for junior hockey. Playing with his idol Krejci should bring out the best in him.\n7. D TOREY KRUG\nWhile he may be a third pair defenseman in most situations, his ability to impact a game, especially on the power play, makes him much more than that. With strong character traits and an “I’ll-prove-you-wrong” chip on his shoulder, Krug should be one of the future leaders of this team, if he isn’t already.\n8. C RYAN SPOONER\nAs with Krug, Spooner’s power-play ability on the half wall make him capable of being more than just your average third line center. A player that almost got away from the Bruins after a disappointing camp last year, Spooner seems ready to establish himself as a bona fide NHLer this year. He still needs to improve in the defensive zone to fully contribute, however.\n9. RW LOUI ERIKSSON\nEriksson was second on the team in points (47) and led the team in power-play goals (six) while also killing penalties. While not spectacular or flashy, he’s as well-rounded a player as you’ll find. He’s in the last year of his contract, but probably won’t be moved unless the B’s are sellers at the trade deadline.\n10. LW MATT BELESKEY\nHe will not replace Milan Lucic, nor has he been paid for that kind of task. But he is a top six forward playing on Krejci’s left wide. Production is both expected and needed from him if the B’s are to get through this transition and make the playoffs. He’ll need to bring a little physicality to the table, too.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:11:10.822+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
