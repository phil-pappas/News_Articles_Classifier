We respect people’s rights to make their voices heard, but not at the expense of others.”\nThe St. Paul chapter of Black Lives Matter has said it plans to shut down the event near the finish line at the State Capitol to raise awareness of recent incidents involving St. Paul police and people of color.\nColeman said that he had reached out to group leaders hoping to meet with them before Sunday. He said that he wanted to get a better sense of what the group is asking the city and police to do to address its concerns.\nCity officials are reviewing incidents cited by the group’s leaders, he said.\n“I … believe it is important for leaders of Black Lives Matter to understand the extraordinary efforts Chief Smith and the department have taken to address issues of racial equity,” Coleman said.\nThe mayor noted that while recent demonstrations have disrupted traffic and blocked access to the State Fair, they haven’t led to serious injuries or arrests. He said the police had done “an exceptional job” of balancing protest rights with public safety.\nRashad Turner, an organizer of Black Lives Matter St. Paul, said in a text message later Wednesday that a meeting with Coleman is scheduled for Thursday.\nJames Walsh contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:01:53.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
