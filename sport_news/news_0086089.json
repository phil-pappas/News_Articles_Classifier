This gives coaches something to ponder when they convene Tuesday to seed the Bergen County tournament: Rutherford or Glen Rock; which team should be seeded higher?\nThe 6-foot-1 Rogers was riding high Thursday. The multisport standout countered a double block by mixing more than a dozen well-placed tips into the center of the Panthers’ defense, and four of her kills came on those tips. Rutherford (10-3 overall, 8-1 Colonial) had eight kills via tips.\n\"Last time they double- and triple-blocked us, and when any team does that, you know there’s going to be floor space somewhere on the other side,\" Rutherford coach Helen Antzoulides said.\nWhen Rogers rotated to the back row, where she collected a team-high 13 kills, junior middle Kristen Wernicki contributed up front. Wernicki had seven kills, three on tips and two on dumps. The Bulldogs’ passing was solid, contributing to sophomore setter Anna DeCesare’s 21 assists.\n\"I thought we passed real well, and I thought we covered really well,\" Antzoulides said. \"You can’t win against the likes of a Glen Rock without a total team effort, and it can’t just be the Jessica Rogers show.\"\nAll those Rutherford tips led to countless diving digs that made it difficult for Glen Rock (13-3, 8-1) to generate an attack. Panthers senior setter Killeen McDonald’s footwork was stellar as she turned difficult passes into respectable sets, and she had 13 assists.\n\"Rutherford really stepped up and played, and unfortunately we didn’t play to the best of our ability, but you have to give them credit,\" Glen Rock coach Matt Kingsley said. \"They really put us in positions where they took advantage of a couple of issues, and Jess really stepped up.\"\nRutherford faces another key Colonial test today when it hosts third-place Garfield, which it swept last month. A Bulldogs lapse against the Boilermakers would drop them a game behind defending champion Glen Rock.\n\"We can’t rest on any laurels right now,\" Antzoulides said. \"We have Garfield [today]. The first time we played them, they had one of their starters out, so we have to play hard and we have to play smart.\"\nEmail: mattura@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:15:37.463+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
