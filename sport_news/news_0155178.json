For the second time Drew Brees had shown up to bring some measure of hope and good will to a person at their lowest point. I don't think he knows the magnitude of what he has done for me or for my best friend. I wouldn't expect him to, as he has affected so many thousands of people in the same way. His impact on the city of New Orleans has been discussed in many forums, but it cannot be exaggerated. He has embraced his role as a symbol of hope, and he carries that burden every day with the grace and selflessness that have made him my city's favorite son. \nIn an appearance on the Ellen show this week, Brees got a chance to say hello to the two fans and it was pretty much all of the feelings from there. \nIn the appearance, Brees invited the two friends down to a Saints game to catch a couple of passes, see the facility and maybe if Sean Payton can be talked into it, call a play. He also surprised McKenna with the money for a high-tech wheelchair. <!--iframe--> Read or Share this story: http://on.wwltv.com/1Rk4fzT TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:44:26.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
