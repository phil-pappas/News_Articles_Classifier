Olvera will remain at helm for now: T-birds’ assistant handed reins for rest of 2015 By DANIEL McKILLOP The Daily News MohaveDailyNews.com | 0 comments \nBULLHEAD CITY — Longtime T-birds assistant coach Rudy Olvera has been moved from acting head coach to head coach for the rest of the 2015 season. \nOlvera confirmed that he had been named the head coach of the T-birds on Monday after he had been acting head coach for the last two weeks. \n“The district has chosen to move in a new direction as far as the varsity coaching position,” said Mohave High School Principal Steve Lawrence on Wednesday afternoon. “And we have named Rudy Olvera as the head coach for the remainder of the 2015 football season. \n“Rudy is a very qualified coach and his dedication to the students is without question, and Coach Olvera lives, eats and breathes football.” \nOlvera said: “It feels pretty good; I’m pretty excited about the whole thing. \n“I’ve been working really hard and if I keep grinding really hard, things will happen.” \nOlvera, who had been the T-birds’ offensive/defensive line coach this season before taking the reins, has been Mohave’s “acting head coach” since Sept. 21, which was the week Mohave traveled to Wickenburg High School to win its first game of the season. \nOlvera, who was an offensive lineman for Mohave for three seasons from 1991-93, said he has served for 15 seasons off and on as a Thunderbirds assistant coach. \nMohave beat Parker High School during its Homecoming Game to win its second game in a row Friday. \nThe T-birds are 2-4 overall, as they prepare to face their cross-town rival Dust Devils at River Valley High School on Friday. \nT-birds senior quarterback Oliver Syme said he is comfortable with Olvera at the helm. \n“The past two weeks the team never skipped a stride, and we’ve continued to trust in our coaching staff as a whole,” said Syme by email. “A lot of the senior players are very familiar with Coach Olvera from four years ago when we were freshman and he was on the varsity staff. \n“He has always showed support for us, and he’s definitely one of the people you can truly tell will be a T-bird for life. He lives and breathes green and gold.” \nA half-decade after his playing career ended at Mohave, Olvera said, he was hired as a JV defensive coordinator and varsity assistant in 1999. \nOlvera said former Mohave head coach Terry King taught him a lot about football. \nKing taught his players to be “blue collar, hard workers, you got to grind,” Olvera said. “He was a hard-working, construction worker. He’d teach all day, work all night and still build a block wall.” \nOlvera said former Mohave head coach Mark Ruckle, who is the River Valley co-head football coach, gave him his first coaching opportunity. \n“Coach Ruckle is the kind of guy who does a lot of work, watches a lot of film,” Olvera said. “He dedicates himself to the weight room and he gives it every thing he’s got.” \nOlvera also worked under former Mohave head coaches Al Melo, Miguel Gutierrez and Dan Stickel during the last decade. \n“From Stickel I learned having a great relationship with the boys and being up front with them — and being open,” Olvera said. \nHaving been a part of the Mohave community for three decades should benefit the T-birds’ longtime assistant and former student-athlete. \n“I’ve always been the same coach no matter where I’ve been at,” Olvera said. “I’ve been honest and true to the guys and tell them what is: good, bad or different. \n“I try to be honest and trust them. \n“That’s a word I use a lot and the kids know it. \n“I trust them to go out and do what we expect of them. \n“Put that word ‘trust’ in a kid’s mind and it will do some amazing things for you.” \nFormer Mohave head football coach Rod Holmes, who had been at the helm for two-plus seasons, had not been on the sideline during the T-birds’ last two games. \n“Allegations of possible fraud were reported to the Bullhead City Police Department (on Sept. 21),” confirmed Emily Fromelt, spokeswoman for the Bullhead City police. “The case has been assigned to detectives for followup.” \nLawrence did not go into detail about Holmes’ situation shortly after the police report was released. \n“There has been an allegation that has been brought forward, and the investigation is ongoing,” said Lawrence on Sept. 24. “It’s a personnel matter and I can’t get into any other details. \n“Coach Holmes is still on campus.” \nThe investigation is still ongoing as of Wednesday. \n“Coach Holmes is still an employee of Mohave High School,” said Lawrence on Wednesday afternoon. “He continues his duties as a qualified teacher at our school.” \nWhen asked if Holmes would be considered for the head coaching spot after the investigation is complete, Lawrence said: “I cannot comment about personnel issues.” \nWhen asked to comment on the coaching change Wednesday evening, Holmes said: “I hope for nothing but the best for the team, coaches, and players as the season plays out. They deserve a successful outcome to the season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:24:48.266+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
