CNN has reached out several times to the hospital for comment and no one has returned any of the calls. \nLittle is known about what left Odom unresponsive at a brothel in Crystal, Nevada, where he was found Tuesday, three days after he checked in. \nNor is much know about what is going on inside his hospital room. \nThe husband of a woman who is on the same floor as Odom said security is extremely tight. \nGeorge Cooper said Odom has had many visitors. \"All throughout the night there is banging and clicking as his entourage, managers, basketball players and what not coming and going off the floor,\" he said, adding that his wife's room is right by the doors to the wing. \nOdom spent tens of thousands at brothel \nAs his private struggle turns into a public spectacle, a few details have emerged about Odom's time at the brothel. \nMost of the information is coming from Dennis Hof, the owner of the Love Ranch, where the former basketball player was found. \nIn three days, Odom spent $75,000 there, which guaranteed two women would \"take care of any of his needs,\" Hof told CNN's sister network HLN. \nHe used cocaine on his first day at the brothel Saturday, employees told 911 dispatchers. On a 911 call played at a news conference, a woman said she also saw him take 10 herbal supplement tablets over three days. \nThe brothel's employees also told 911 operators that when they found him Tuesday, Odom was lying in bed on his side with a pinkish fluid coming from his mouth and nose. \nOdom's children speak out \nHis father and two children have joined Kardashian family members at the hospital, but have revealed few specifics on his condition. \nIn a statement Thursday, his children Destiny Odom, Lamar Odom Jr. and their family asked for prayers. \n\"Thanks for your outpouring of prayers and support for our dad. We are here with our family and friends,\" the statement said. \"We appreciate everyone respecting our privacy at this time. We ask for your continued prayers.\" \nIn addition to appearing on \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\" Odom and Kardashian had their own reality show, \"Khloe & Lamar.\" It lasted for two seasons and 20 episodes. \nThe two signed divorce papers this year, but the divorce has not been finalized, a source told CNN. \nGrandmother: 'Spotlight could have gotten to him' \nHis grandmother, Florence Odom, said she was devastated she could not be at his bedside because of her disabilities. â€¹ Previous", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:00:44.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
