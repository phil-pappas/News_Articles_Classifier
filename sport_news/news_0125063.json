FLORHAM PARK —The fog was the worst of it.\nBuster Skrine felt like he was caught in one after the hit. His mind was \"real cloudy.\" And he could not keep track of the play calls coming in from the sideline.\nSkrine had collided with Pierre Garcon in last week's victory over Washington, and the Redskins receiver hit him in the head, snapping it violently to the left. Skrine knew immediately that he had suffered a concussion.\n\"Everything was just real cloudy,\" he said. \"The game was real cloudy.\"\nBut just five days later, he was on the practice field Friday — and without the red, no-contact jersey he wore a day earlier. \nHe is listed as probable for Sunday in exactly the game he was given a $25 million contract this off-season to play: to cover slot receivers Julian Edelman and Danny Amendola in a showdown for first place in the AFC East at archival New England.\nSkrine, 26, would not say whether he expects to often cover Edelman (40 receptions, 449 yards, four touchdowns), the Patriots' top receiver.\nBut the 5-foot-9, 185-pound cornerback was brought in to shut down players such as Edelman, Amendola and tight end Rob Gronkowski on short pass plays.\n\"This is a big game, a division game,\" Skrine said, \"so just being able to come back if I get to come back, I want to help the team any way I can.\"\nCoach Todd Bowles for one, is happy to see him return.\n\"It's big because he is one of our good players,\" he said.\nThe Jets (4-1) and their No. 1-ranked defense (269.2 yards allowed per game) face the Patriots (5-0) and their No. 2-ranked offense (422.4).\nSkrine held his own with Edelman and Amendola in 2013 when the Patriots beat the Browns, for whom he played from 2011 to 2014, 27-26.\n\"He's just a complete receiver,\" Skrine said of Edelman. \"That's why he's their No. 1 receiver.\"\nSkrine was not fully cleared to play as of early Friday afternoon. He still needed to pass two more neurological tests to finish the NFL concussion protocol. But he expects to be ready Sunday. Skrine initially was worried he would have to sit out the game.\n\"I was just hoping every time I woke up I felt better,\" he said.\nJETS \"SPECIAL\": Brandon Marshall thinks the Jets have something \"really special.\"\n\"It's a special group, man,\" the 10-year veteran said. \"Even watching film, even the attitude. I love seeing guys make a mistake and throw their helmet on the ground and get kind of [angry] and show that they care.\"\nMarshall admits he was a locker room issue earlier in his career.\n\"I think the first year in Miami, I didn't get it,\" said Marshall, 31. \"I didn't understand it. I mean, my heart was in the right place. … I was super-immature.\"\nIVORY IN BETTER PLACE: Chris Ivory admitted Friday that he was upset he did not receive more carries under former coach Rex Ryan in his first two Jets seasons.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:02:34.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
