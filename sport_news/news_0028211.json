(AP) - LSU has proposed extending the contract of Athletic Director Joe Alleva by one year to July 2020.\nThe LSU Board of Supervisors will vote on the proposal at its meeting next Friday.\nThe Advocate reports ( http://bit.ly/1LeK2cB ) Alleva's proposed extension doesn't include a raise. He currently makes $725,000 with incentives that could push his salary to $900,000.\nLSU gave Alleva a three-year extension last September, pushing his deal to July 2019.\nAlleva is in his eighth year, coming to Baton Rouge in 2008 after a stint as AD at Duke. He's overseen improvements to Tiger Stadium's exterior and the newly expanded south end zone structure.\nAmong Alleva's major coaching hires have been men's basketball coaches Trent Johnson and Johnny Jones, women's basketball coach Nikki Caldwell and softball coach Beth Torina.\nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
