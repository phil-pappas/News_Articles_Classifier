In doing so, it prevents bait from being stolen by birds. It also enhances bait storage and organization. The invention features a portable, waterproof design that is convenient and easy to use so it is ideal for fishing enthusiasts. Additionally, the BAIT BUDDY is producible in design variations and a prototype is available.\nThe inventor described the invention design. “My design offers a convenient and protective storage solution for live bait.”\nThe original design was submitted to the Charlotte office of InventHelp. It is currently available for licensing or sale to manufacturers or marketers.
