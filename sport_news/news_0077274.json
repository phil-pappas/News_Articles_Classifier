Rutgers upset bid falls just short on late Michigan State TD \n“The clock management is 100 percent on the guy in charge and I'm the guy in charge,” Wilson said. “So I mismanaged the situation. Chris Laviano did what he was told to do and I told him the wrong thing. So don't think that he screwed it up.” \nRutgers had no timeouts when it began a drive at its own 35-yard line with 43 seconds left. It advanced to Michigan State’s 40-yard line with 27 seconds left. \nThen this: A spike on first down, an incompletion on second down and a sack on third down. \n“I looked over to the sideline and the coaches told us to spike it,” Laviano said. “It was really fast after I got up. I looked over to the sideline and it was still third down on the sticks. \n“They told me to spike it and I spiked it. And then it wasn’t. For whatever reason, we all thought it was third down.” For Rutgers football, moral victories count \nWide receiver Leonte Carroo said he knew it was fourth down but understood the confusion. He looked at offensive coordinator Ben McDaniels. \n“It was kind of weird with the way the scoreboard was set up,” Carroo said. “It didn’t change as fast as Coach McDaniels thought it did. He looked up and saw third down and he made a decision. So we just have to live with the decision he made.” \nIn reality, the sack set off a frenzy. Laviano’s spike came with three seconds remaining. \n“At that point, we didn’t have any timeouts and you can’t really take a sack,” Laviano said. “But the play wasn’t developing as it should have. I was trying to keep it alive and extend the play. Obviously it was hectic after I got sacked.\" \nCould it have been different? BYU beat Nebraska on a last-play Hail Mary earlier this season. \n“If we ran it, it would have been a (50-yard) Hail Mary,” Laviano said. “It sucks that we didn’t give ourselves a chance but that wasn’t the reason we lost the game. There was a lot of opportunities we could’ve won the game but we didn’t.” Rutgers rewind: RU falls to No. 4 Michigan State \nWilson’s first breakdown came in the locker room, when he told the team the loss was his fault. \n“They put themselves in a position to have an opportunity to tie the game and win the game, and that was taken from them,” Wilson said. “And fair is a four-letter word like some of those other words you can't use on TV, but it ain't fair.” \nCarroo, who had seven catches for 134 yards and three touchdowns, said it was “very tough” to see the game end on a spike. \n“We just have to come in here Sunday and lock in and have more attention to detail,” Carroo said, “because at the end of the day that’s how you get beat in this league.” \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com Don't miss a thing \nDownload our apps and get alerts for local news, weather, traffic and more.
