Christy Cabrera Chirinos Contact Reporter Sun Sentinel Clemson-Miami matchup features two of the ACC's top young quarterbacks \nThey won't be on the field competing head-to-head and their styles of play are different, but there's no doubt quarterbacks Brad Kaaya and Deshaun Watson are two of the Atlantic Coast Conference's best. \nSo when Miami hosts sixth-ranked Clemson on Saturday, there is potential for more than a few explosive plays, big throws — and headaches for the defenses trying to contain the two talented signal callers. \nKaaya, who earned ACC Rookie of the Year honors as a freshman last year, has continued developing into the quarterback and leader the Hurricanes hoped he would become. \nThe sophomore threw for a career-high 405 yards against Florida State, the most by a Miami quarterback against the Seminoles since 1980. He has thrown for more than 200 yards in 14 of his 19 career games and has a passing touchdown in all but one of his games as the Hurricanes' starter. \nEntering the week, Kaaya leads the ACC in total offense (1,749 yards), passing yards (1,795), and passing yards per game (299.2). The quarterback not far behind him in those and several other statistical categories? Watson, the preseason ACC Player of the Year who has generated 1,644 yards of offense. \nBut it's not just their numbers that are similar. Both Miami coach Al Golden and Clemson coach Dabo Swinney each believe their quarterbacks have matured and found new levels of confidence that are translating both in how they play and run their respective offenses. \n\"He's just a confident player. He knows what we're doing. He's well coached, he's very smart and that's why he's a great player,\" Swinney said of Watson, who was named the ACC Offensive Back of the Week on Monday after throwing for 420 yards in the Tigers' win over Boston College. \"He studies and prepares during the week. The game is not fast for him. He doesn't get overwhelmed.\" \nSaid Golden of Kaaya after Miami's win over Virginia Tech: \"His courage, his mental toughness, his ability to make plays when we need him. He is swiping the field. … he's poised. He's made some big throws when we needed them. We have to protect him a little bit better, but you know what you're getting into when you play this outfit. Obviously, Brad is stepping up his game right now.\" \nKaaya, a student of the game, said Wednesday he hasn't watched much film on Watson this season, but he knows what his fellow sophomore can do. \nThe two met as high-profile recruits at the Elite 11 camp in Oregon during Kaaya's senior year of high school in 2013. It was there that Kaaya got a first-hand look at Watson's ability to both throw the ball downfield and elude defenders. The quarterback is Clemson's second-leading rusher with 234 yards and two touchdowns to go with his 1,410 passing yards. \n\"He seems like a really focused dude. He's locked in the whole time,\" Kaaya said. \"He's all about business, all about ball. … it seems like he can stretch the field vertically, has a good vertical passing game, can throw the seams well, wheel-routes well and make all the down-the-field throws.\" \nWith those numbers and that kind of skill level, Miami's defense expects handling Watson will be a challenge. But the Hurricanes come enter the game as the nation's leader in turnover margin, with the defense forcing opposing quarterbacks into 11 interceptions. \nWatson, for all of his success, has been picked off seven times this season, and the Hurricanes are eager to see if they can force him into mistakes Saturday as the Hurricanes bid for the upset. \nAnd if nothing else, Miami's secondary feels it is prepared to challenge Watson simply because of the quarterback they face every day in practice. \n\"We've got to play good in the secondary. We can't let stuff behind us, but we've got a good way to prepare because we see Brad every day,\" safety Deon Bush said. \"And Brad is the best quarterback in the country in my opinion. Playing against him is getting us ready for the challenge.\" \nccabrera@tribpub.com ; On Twitter @ChristyChirinos", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:25:41.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
