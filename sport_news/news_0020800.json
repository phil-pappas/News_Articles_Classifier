The shooters acknowledge India's growing influence in shooting world and are ready to look upto them.\n\"We hear about Abhinav Bindra and Gagan Narang, they are big names and we look up to them. India is much better than us,\" Tandin said.\nThough just 31 years of age, Choden, her wards say, has quit active shooting and taken to coaching.\nAs the 23-year-old Lenchu and 27-year-old Tandin Pema brace up to try their luck at the Asian Shooting Championship in November -- the last qualifying event for next year's Rio Olympic Games -- they are banking on the experience of their coach Choden, who will accompany the two to Kuwait.\n\"I have participated at the Asian Games in Korea, and I will try to shoot well in Kuwait and represent Bhutan in the Olympics,\" Lenchu said.\n\"We had one Olympian in Kunzang Choden who was there in London. We would love to emulate her,\" Lenchu added.\nLenchu and Tandin will compete in women's and men's 10m air rifle event, respectively, in Kuwait.\nAsked about shooting in their country, Tandin said they have only one small range in Thimpu, and make do with that.\n\"We go there for our training and that is the only range we have.\"\nThe modest shooters said the Bhutan Shooting Federation \"provides\" ammunitions to them.\nPrince His Royal Highness Jigyel Ugyen Wangchuck, who is also the President of Bhutan Shooting Federation and the Bhutan Olympic Committee (BOC), encourages the shooters as he is interested in the sport.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:52:18.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
