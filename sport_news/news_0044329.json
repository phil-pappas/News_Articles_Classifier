He claimed that all Cabinet ministers, including the Chief Minister’s office, was involved in mass-scale corruption. Nishank said at his native town in Pauri that it was quite unfortunate that millions of rupees were collected post 2013 flash floods in Uttarakhand, but the government had not only failed to properly utilise the money but mass irregularities in distribution of the fund had come to light. The Congress government, previously led by Vijay Bahuguna, had failed to gauge the impact of the flash floods, which led to delay in rescue and relief operations. Later, after his exit, Chief Minister Harish Rawat took on rehabilitation of the disaster affected regions as his top priority. But now, with the disaster fund distribution scam coming into light, people’s faith in the government had been shattered totally, he claimed. “The Congress government is harping on lucrative announcements and on development projects which are only on paper. In reality, all 13 districts of the state are lacking development and infrastructural amenities, in comparison to what they had during the previous BJP government. CM Harish Rawat is making whirlwind tours, trying to hide his ill governance, but this will only add to the state’s exchequer as voters have made their mind to teach a lesson to the Congress,” Nishank, a five time legislator from Garhwal, said. On the Garisain Assembly session scheduled in November first week, he termed it a ploy to divert the attention of the people and opposition parties from the numerous scams that had engulfed the ruling party. “Just spending a few days in Gairsain won’t do any good to the development of hills or solve the capital issue fully. The Congress government should clear its stand of making twin Assembly buildings at Gairsain and Raipur simultaneously,” Nishank added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:14:38.885+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
