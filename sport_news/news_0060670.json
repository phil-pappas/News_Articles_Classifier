The researchers were granted the Gewinner Medi Award for their research on \"Clinical Results Following Management for Grade III Acromioclavicular Joint Injuries: Does Eventual Surgery Affect Overall Outcomes?\" \n\n2. The biannual award is given to the top paper on the treatment of joint injuries and arthroscopic surgery. \n\n3. In the study, researchers found delaying surgery after acute grade III injuries to the shoulder AC joint did not affect the final outcome. Rather, a trial of non-operative treatment can provide successful outcomes even if patients eventually choose to undergo surgery. \n\n4. Researcher also found patients who visited their orthopedic physician for their initial evaluation 30 or more days after their injury were more prone to choose surgical treatment. \n\n5. Dr. Millet is the director of shoulder surgery at the Steadman Clinic and a scientific advisory board member at the Steadman Philippon Institute.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:11:42.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
