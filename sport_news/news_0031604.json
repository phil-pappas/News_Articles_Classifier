The Longwood resident may get additional time on his other charges of attempted kidnapping, attempted child rape and attempted murder. A Florida man got 885 years in prison for child porn on Monday, and he may be facing additional time behind bars, officials said.\nShawn Ryan Thomas, 31, got the steep sentence for having “massive amounts of child pornography,” officials in state Attorney General Pam Bondi’s office said. Yet he’s also slated to go to trial on separate charges of attempted kidnapping, attempted child rape and attempted murder.\nThomas is accused of trying to lure the family of a 9-year-old girl to his Orlando-area home to kill her parents, rape the girl on video and then kill her, the Orlando Sentinel reported .\nInvestigators with the Florida Department of Law Enforcement caught wind of the plot and arrested him in June 2014.\nThen they discovered 60 child porn files, including videos up to an hour long, on a computer in his Longwood home, according to court documents cited by the Sentinel. A lawyer for Thomas maintained the computer was his roommate’s.\nA jury nonetheless convicted Thomas for 60 counts of possession of child pornography in June. Seminole County judge Marlene Alva gave him 15 years for each of 59 counts and 15 years of sex offender probation for the last count.\nFollow on Twitter @tobysalkc\ntsalinger@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories Martin O'Malley cuts ties with aide busted for child porn Chef Matthew Tivy no stranger to underage boys: source ‘Mrs. Orange County’ accused of selling child porn to Marine Celeb chef Matthew Tivy charged with sex with a minor", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/tobysalkc", "http://www.myfloridalegal.com/newsrel.nsf/newsreleases/F07031B83FADC46885257EDC0056E153", "http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/breaking-news/os-shawn-thomas-child-porn-sentenced-20151012-story.html"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:06:45.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
