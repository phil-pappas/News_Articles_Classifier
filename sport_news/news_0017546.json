Not when he gets to watch shortstop Addison Russell do his thing.\n\"It's a pleasure to watch the guy I got traded for working behind me,\" he said.\nHammel also no longer faults manager Joe Maddon for a quick hook â€” removing him from an Aug. 6 game against the Giants in the fifth inning of an eventual 5-4 victory.\n\"Sometimes, yeah, you feel like you can go further, and Joe and I addressed that a long time ago,\" Hammel said. \"He's the manager for a reason. He's going to make a call on what he thinks is going to be the right move, and I commend him for that.\"\nMaddon's call for Game 4 on Tuesday is to put the ball in Hammel's 33-year-old right hand.\n\"He's a professional,\" Maddon said. \"I know he's ready for the moment. ... He's pitched well against these guys too.\"\nHammel has a 5.97 career ERA against the Cardinals in seven starts. But he recorded a quality start Sept. 8 in St. Louis, allowing three runs on four hits in six innings. He also closed the season strong with a five-inning blanking of the Reds on Oct. 1.\n\"It wasn't a lightbulb moment or anything like that,\" Hammel said of his late-season uptick, which left him 10-7 with a 3.74 ERA. \"I've been in the game long enough to know that if you beat yourself up, you're going to set yourself further back.\"\nAs for Russell's status for Game 4 after he left Game 3 in the fourth inning with a tight left hamstring, Maddon said the shortstop will undergo tests Tuesday morning.\n\"For now we are absolutely not certain what the severity is,\" Maddon said.\nWhile Maddon announced Hammel before the game, Cardinals manager Mike Matheny waited until after the Cubs' 8-6 win to name John Lackey his Game 4 starter.\nWith the Cardinals facing elimination, Matheny will turn to his ace. Lackey blanked the Cubs for 71/3 innings in Game 1, allowing two hits and a walk. Matheny's other main option was to start Lance Lynn, who went 12-11 with a 3.03 ERA this season but got shelled by the Cubs, going 0-3 with a 7.64 ERA.\n\"We've been very fortunate to see an amazing amount of selflessness to where guys are putting the club in front of their individual goals,\" Matheny said. \"A guy like Lance Lynn knows we're going to do what's best for our team.\"\ntgreenstein@tribpub.com\nTwitter @TeddyGreenstein\nPrivacy Policy Jason Hammel St. Louis Cardinals Joe Maddon Chicago Cubs Lance Lynn Addison Russell Cincinnati Reds", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c6e3f/turbine/ct-look-ahead-game-4-cubs-cardinals-spt-1013-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-13T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:41:17.775+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
