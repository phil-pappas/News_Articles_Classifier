And his No. 41 SHR Chevrolet will carry sponsorship from Monster Energy. \nBusch, the 2004 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series champion, has enjoyed considerable success at the four-car SHR outfit, where he is teamed with crew chief Tony Gibson and fellow drivers Kevin Harvick , Tony Stewart and Danica Patrick . \nHeading into Sunday's CampingWorld.com 500 at Talladega Superspeedway, Busch is ranked third in the Sprint Cup points standings. For the season, he has three poles, two victories, 10 top-five and 17 top-10 finishes. \nSunday's race at Talladega is the third and final event in the Contender Round of the Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup. Busch will advance to the Eliminator Round with a finish of eighth and no laps led at Talladega; ninth and at least one lap led; or 10 th and the most laps led. If other Chase drivers have problems at Talladega -- a distinct possibility -- that would make Busch's chances of advancement that much easier. \nDuring his career, Busch has 19 poles, 27 career Cup race victories, 116 top fives and 218 top 10s. He also was won five NASCAR XFINITY Series races and four more in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. \nTwo races stand out in Busch's career: At Homestead-Miami Speedway in the final race of 2004 and the first year of the Chase, Busch lost his right-front wheel heading into the pits, but miraculously managed to stay on the lead lap and narrowly edged Jimmie Johnson for the Sprint Cup title. \nBut Busch's most remarkable drive might have come last year. In his first and so far only start in the Verizon IndyCar Series, Busch finished sixth in the Indianapolis 500 and won Rookie of the Year honors for the race. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T18:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:19:23.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
