It's always frustrating for everybody when you are injured.\n\"You want to be out there. It's something that is nagging with a muscle strain. It's not fun for anybody. He's got a great attitude toward it and hopefully he can continue to heal up and get out there when he can.\"\nManning didn't see Cruz get hurt in the individual drills, but he noticed he did not take part in all of them.\nCruz was not in the locker room after practice and was unavailable for comment.\nThe 28-year-old Cruz has not played in a game since suffering a season-ending knee injury on Oct. 12 against the Philadelphia Eagles . He had surgery and rehabilitation and came to training camp hoping to play in the season opener. He pulled a calf muscle in mid-August and has not practiced.\nCruz had said on Monday that his calf felt fine and he was excited at the prospect of playing again and being one of the league's outstanding receivers.\n\"Victor came out and tried to do individuals,\" Coughlin said in a statement. \"He felt the calf again and that's all he did.\"\nBills: Coach Rex Ryan says there's a \"real possibility\" running back LeSean McCoy will not play against the Giants on Sunday because of a nagging injury to his left hamstring. However, he won't entirely rule out McCoy from playing. The injury has nagged and slowed McCoy since he was hurt during a joint practice with the Cleveland Browns on Aug. 18. McCoy sat out Buffalo's final preseason games before playing a limited role in a season-opening win over Indianapolis on Sept. 13.\nJets: Receiver Eric Decker remains sidelined by a sprained left knee that could cause him to miss a second straight game. Cornerback Darrelle Revis has a hamstring issue, but says he should be fine. Running back Chris Ivory is dealing with a strained quadriceps that kept him out against the Eagles.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:42:36.100+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
