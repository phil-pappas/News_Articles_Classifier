Wright tallied one interception during his first four seasons with the San Diego Chargers .\nWith veteran corners in high demand, it's likely that Wright will be able to catch on with another team this season.\nThe 49ers added guard Andrew Tiller from their practice squad in a corresponding move.\nCopyright © 2015 Score Media Ventures Inc.
