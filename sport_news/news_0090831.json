The fact that it is hosting a Breeders' Cup for the first time will make it more special.\nThe Saturday stakes at Keeneland will include the Woodford, Thoroughbred Club of America, First Lady, Claiborne Breeders' Futurity and Shadwell Turf Mile.\nAlso on Saturday, Belmont Park will host the Kelso, Flower Bowl, Frizette, Champagne, Hill Prince and Jockey Club Gold Cup.\nI'll focus on six Grade 1 stakes for analysis.\nThe First Lady appears to have a wide-open field of 11 grass routers. I would lean toward the three European invaders in Crowley's Law (5-1), Easter (4-1) and Outstanding (6-1). The Euro style of liking soft ground and quickening late should fit well over Keeneland turf.\nThe Breeders' Futurity came up strong, as five of the 12 2-year-olds entrants last ran at either Saratoga or Belmont Park.\nThe reason for running at Keeneland instead of the Champagne at Belmont Park is to get a race over the track where the Breeders' Cup will take place, plus it is a two-turn race instead of one turn.\nExaggerator (7-2) exits the best last race, as he won the Saratoga Special like a seasoned pro. He was stuck behind horses in the stretch until jockey Junior Alvarado decided to bull through a narrow opening.\nSeven of the 12 starters exit a maiden special weight race, so I would watch the tote board to see who is getting bet.\nIn the Shadwell Turf Mile, I like The Pizza Man (8-1) coming off his win in the Arlington Million. He was flattered when the runner-up horse, Big Blue Kitten, won the Turf Classic at Belmont last week.\nThree Euro invaders — War Envoy (8-1), Kelinni (15-1) and Dutch Connection (4-1) — look like potential spoilers.\nAt Belmont Park, rain this week should soften the grass course in favor of the Euro shippers.\nIn the Flower Bowl, I like Euros Mutatis Mutandis (12-1) and Curvy (2-1). Curvy has the stronger resume, but sometimes running for the first time on Lasix can be a great equalizer.\nThe Frizette drew a disappointing field of seven 2-year-old fillies, including four that just broke their maiden. They must catch the rail horse, She's All Ready (3-1), who has won both of her starts.\nIn the Champagne, Ralis (3-1) was an easy winner of the Hopeful at Saratoga for Southern California trainer Doug O'Neill. His challenge will come from six untested 2-year-olds that exit a maiden special weight race.\nFinally, the Jockey Club Gold Cup is headed by Tonalist (6-5) in what is a weak edition of this historic stakes. There is no early speed in the field other than Constitution (3-1). Remember that lone early speed is still the best bet in horse racing.\n• FALL CLASSIC AT THE ORLEANS — The Fall Classic at The Orleans will be Thursday through Oct. 10. The entry fee is $500. It's a key prelude to the 2016 Horseplayer World Series at The Orleans.\nRichard Eng's horse racing column is published Friday in the Las Vegas Review-Journal.
