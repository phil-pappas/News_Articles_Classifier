The Lady Wolves wasted little time getting going scoring four runs in the first inning and then put the game out of reach with a 14-run, 14-hit explosion in the second inning. \nSenior Drew Puckett had three hits, two RBI, and scored three runs to lead the offense. Junior Samantha Thomas, Biz Walters, and Gabby Benson each had two hits and two RBI for Buford and the trio combined to score eight runs. \nIn Game 2, Wolfe earned her 14th victory of the year while Thomas powered the offensive attack with her 14th and 15th home runs of the year. \nBuford again started quickly with a 10-run first inning. Thomas doubled, homered, and scored two runs in the inning. Thomas finished with three hits and four RBI and freshman Shea Bayreuther had two hits, one RBI, and scored twice for the Lady Wolves. \nSenior Breanna Gutierrez had two hits, one RBI, and scored twice, and s enior Baylee Sexton had a three-run triple in the first inning. \nBuford next will take on Thomas County Central in the second round on Wednesday at home.

North Oconee, the fourth seed from 8-AAAA, took down Region 5-AAAA champ Carrollton on Wednesday, 7-2 and 7-6 on the road.
