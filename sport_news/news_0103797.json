The Finance Ministry said in a statement the issue of extension of last date for e-filing returns of income and audit reports under Section 44AB of the Income Tax Act, 1961, due by September 30 has been the subject matter of litigation in various high courts across the country. While some courts had ruled in favour of extending the due date, others had ruled otherwise, it said. “In order to avoid discrimination between taxpayers residing in different jurisdictions and to be fair to all, and also in view of paucity of time to approach the Supreme Court by way of Special Leave Petition (SLP), the government has decided that across the country, all returns of income and audit reports under section 44AB which were due for e-filing by September 30 may now be filed by October 31,” the statement said. Section 44AB of the I-T Act talks about the provisions relating to those taxpayers who are required to get their accounts audited from a chartered accountant (CA). The audit under Section 44AB aims at ascertaining the compliance of various provisions of the law.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:19:40.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
