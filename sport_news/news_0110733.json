(BRUCE BUMSTEAD/BRANDON SUN) \nAviel Tsomik used to be one of the top boxers in Israel, but on Saturday night he took his first step towards being one of the best in Canada. \nThe 15-year-old was ranked the second-best under-13 fighter in his weight class in Israel before moving to Canada two years ago. He joined the Brandon Boxing Club earlier this year and had his first fight since the move at UCT Pavilion as part of the club’s Halloween Hustle card on Saturday night. \nNo winner was declared as it was an exhibition match with Justice Harborne of the Eastman club, although many agree Tsomik would have won had it been scored. That didn’t matter though. For Tsomik, it was important to get in the ring again and make the first of four weigh-ins to make him eligible to compete at nationals in April. \n\"I love it. I want to be on the Canada team,\" Tsomik said. \nBoxing is a true passion for Tsomik. His dad was a boxer and Tsomik wanted to follow in his footsteps, so he started training when he was four years old. He has never stopped. \nLiving in Birtle now does make it a challenge, though. Although Tsomik, who has 23 amateur fights under his belt, would love to be in the Wheat City every day to train under Brandon Boxing Club owner Noel Harding and fight team coach Mike Fredrickson, the commute is too much. \nHowever, he has a ring at his house and trains there every day. He tries to get to Brandon every couple of Saturdays and Harding and Fredrickson put him in the ring to spar. \n\"That’s the main thing we can do for him,\" Harding said. \"He can do all that other stuff on his own time. He knows what to do, he’s got the experience, he has 20-plus fights. Really, we just get him sparring. \n\"We give him technical stuff too, but when he’s only able to come once in a while we just have to give him rounds. If you want to get better at boxing, you have to get into the ring and get beat up. That’s how you get better and that’s helping.\" \nTsomik has set high expectations for himself. In addition to becoming a national champion, he wants to be a professional fighter one day. \nHarding and Fredrickson will do everything they can to help him achieve that dream, but they know a few tweaks need to be made to his approach. Tsomik’s style is more European and his Brandon club coaches are trying to make it a little more Canadian and to have him fight inside more. \nHis footwork, however, is outstanding and he gets low to work his way inside and avoid getting hit as well. \n\"I’m just moving, so he has no time to think what to do. I’m just moving a lot,\" Tsomik said. \nAlthough Tsomik still has a lot of work ahead to reach his goals, Fredrickson thinks they are attainable. \n\"He definitely has that base,\" Fredrickson said. \"At 15, to already have 23 fights that’s huge. Experience is everything and in amateur you want to have as many fights as you can to really set yourself up as a pro. I can definitely see it as long as he sticks with it and stays active.\" \nOverall, Harding was happy with the Halloween Hustle and the walkup crowd that helped fill out UCT Pavilion. \nHe and Fredrickson both thought all seven locals who fought had a good showing, although most of the bouts were exhibitions or challenges with no winners declared. In scored matches, Ryker Batson of the BBC defeated Pan Am’s Chris Sarifa, while Thomas McKay of Pan Am beat BBC’s Orpha Alclime Jr. \n\"It was good to have another show in Brandon,\" Fredrickson said. \"Unfortunately, our two top guys didn’t get to fight tonight. It was out of our control. \n\"It was a good show. Most of the guys got in there and they all had good performances. We’re definitely proud of them. They all fought hard.\" \nThe boxing club will hold another card on Dec. 19. \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T10:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:47:00.415+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
