The Badgers, despite their weak schedule, are not to be taken lightly. Although tonight's D-III, Section VIII clash at Walkup Skydome represents a potential trap game for Prescott, with rival Bradshaw Mountain lurking in Week 9, the ailing Eagles are no match for a bruising Badgers squad.  Coconino (3-5, 0-2) at Bradshaw Mountain (5-2, 1-1) 7 p.m. Friday at Bob Pavlich Field in Prescott Valley Bradshaw Mountain, after dropping eight spots in the D-III rankings last week, climbed from No. 17 to No. 14 Oct. 13, thanks to a blowout victory over Flagstaff Oct. 9 at home. Bears coach David Moran said his team's on a mission following its disappointing section-opening loss to Mingus Union Oct. 2 in Cottonwood. Two-time defending section champion Bradshaw, which like Prescott is in a possible trap-game situation tonight, should have little trouble beating Coconino. If Prescott and Bradshaw win tonight, it would set up a section showdown with state playoff implications at Bill Shepard Field Oct. 23. D-III No. 12 Mingus leads the section at 2-0, but the Marauders still must visit the Badgers in their regular season/section finale Oct. 30. Prescott, like Mingus, controls its postseason destiny, as section champs automatically qualify for state.  Chino Valley (2-5, 0-2) at North Pointe Prep (1-6, 0-2)7 p.m. Friday at Cortez H.S. football stadium in Phoenix Chino Valley doesn't have a shot at a winning season in 2015, but there's no doubt that the Division 5 No. 33-ranked Cougars have made strides. In this D-V, Section III contest tonight, Chino visits a North Pointe Prep team in Phoenix that's lost five in a row. The Cougars haven't won since Sept. 25 at Tuba City, but expect them to get off the schneid this evening.  Mogollon (6-1, 4-0) at Mayer (4-3, 2-2)7 p.m. Friday at Mathern Field in Spring Valley Division VI No. 16-ranked Mayer is on the outside looking in as far as the eight-man football state playoff picture's concerned. The only chance the Wildcats have to potentially qualify for the postseason is if they upset defending state champion and No. 7-ranked Mogollon tonight in their regular-season/section finale at home. Mayer has won its last two D-VI, Section I games by a combined 108-0, albeit against inferior foes Fredonia and El Capitan. Mogollon, on the cusp of a section title, has won five in a row in convincing fashion since a blowout loss at Gilbert Christian Sept. 4. A green Wildcats squad will probably have to be content with a .500 season this fall.  Valley Lutheran (3-4, 2-1) at Bagdad (7-1, 3-0)7 p.m. Friday at Bagdad H.S. football field in Bagdad With a win tonight in its regular-season finale, Division VI No. 4-ranked Bagdad will sew up the Section III crown and qualify for the state playoffs, which begin Saturday, Oct. 24. The Sultans likely need a victory over No. 15 Valley Lutheran to remain among the top four playoff seeds, each of which garner a first-round bye.If Bagdad receives the bye, the defending D-VI state runner-up would need three straight wins to capture its second state title in three years. - Doug Cook, Daily Courier", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:37:40.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
