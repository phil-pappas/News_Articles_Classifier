The ruling by Justice Rajesh Bindal came on a bunch of nearly 40 regular first appeals filed by Amrik Singh and other appellants against the Union Territory of Chandigarh. By filing the appeals, the landowners were seeking enhancement of compensation for the acquired land. The Bench was told that the process was initiated vide a notification dated November 21, 2005, issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act. It was followed by a notification under Section 6 of the Act on November 25, 2006. The Land Acquisition Collector, vide award dated November 24, 2008, assessed the market value at Rs 10,58,880 per acre for land in Palsora village, Rs 24,65,420 per acre for land in Badheri village and Rs 11,86,667 per acre for land in Kajheri village. Dissatisfied with the award, the landowners filed objections. On reference, the court below determined the market value of the acquired land in all villages at Rs 34,50,144 per acre. The award was again impugned in the present set of appeals. Counsel for the landowners submitted that the acquired land was forming part of Sector 55, and the area around it had already developed. On the one side of the acquired land were Sectors 39, 40 and 41, which were already developed as the acquisition for the development of the third phase was carried out long back. The court was also told that the land abutted the Punjab boundary. The area on the Punjab side, too, had already been developed as Phase VI. The counsel further submitted that the reference court for assessing the compensation for the acquired land placed reliance upon an earlier acquisition, for which a notification under Section 4 was issued in August 1999. Considering the time gap of 66 months, the reference court granted increase thereon. However, the amount was not reasonable as a “lot of development” took place in between. Taking up the matter, Justice Bindal added: “To place reliance upon the award pertaining to land for which acquisition was carried out five-and-a-half years earlier may not be appropriate, seeing the pace of development…. “This court in Dalwinder Singh’s case for the land in Dhanas village, where a notification under Section 4 of the Act was issued on January 30, 2006, had assessed compensation at Rs 91,80,000 per acre. Reliance therein was placed upon sale deeds, which were proximate in time and location to the acquisition. “Considering the aforesaid facts and also that the notification in the present case was issued two months prior in time, the landowners deserve to be granted compensation of Rs 90,00,000 per acre. They shall also be entitled to all statutory benefits available to them under the Act. Ordered accordingly”.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:12:05.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
