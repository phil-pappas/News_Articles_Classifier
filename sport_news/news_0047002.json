The Romanian show thus surpassed the well-known animation The Simpsons , which has held the world record until now.\nThe series has been broadcasted on Prima TV under three different names – Trasniti in NATO, Trasniti din NATO and Trasnitii – which had a total of more than 1,300 episodes. However, the sitcom produced by Romanian Grig Chiroiu, entered the Guinness World Records with the 689 episodes registered for Trasnitii. It was enough to beat the American animation The Simpsons , which has held the record with 573 episodes.\n“This title acknowledges the effort made in the past 12 years, it means the fulfillment of a dream that we all had in the last five years, it means that now all our fans can be proud of us,” said Grig Chiroiu, cited by Primatv.ro.\nThe Romanian production reached 25 seasons and keeps counting.\nBBC buys Romanian talent show format to broadcast it in the UK\nIrina Popescu, irina.popescu@romania-insider.com\n(photo source: primatv.ro)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:16:34.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
