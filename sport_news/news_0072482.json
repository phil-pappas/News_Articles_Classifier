Joel A. Bowman Sr., the group's founder.\nBy last month, AABA's core group representing about 20 churches and other organizations held an inaugural, day-long symposium titled \"Biblical Sexuality in the Black Church,\" billed as the first event of its kind in Louisville. About 30 more churches and other entities were represented at the event, Bowman said.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nPoll: Most in Ky say gay marriage ruling wrong\nThe symposium had three sessions related to homosexuality and the lesbian, gay, transgender, bisexual and queer (LGBTQ) community, and the message was that belief in the Scriptures and God's authority provided a route to overcoming same-sex attraction and assuming a new identity, along with help from the church and others.\nMembers of the Louisville-based Fairness Campaign and other activists plan to protest at another conference with a similar or related theme that is scheduled to start Monday, Oct. 5, at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary on Lexington Road. It's the annual conference of the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors and is expected to attract pastors, professors and others who identify themselves as Christians to what the Fairness Campaign calls an \"anti-LGBT conference promoting harmful 'conversion therapy.'\" The protests are planned at 10 a.m. and 5:30 p.m. Monday across the street from the seminary, 2825 Lexington.\nA promotional video on the Association of Certified Biblical Counselors' website said the conference will focus on homosexuality and aims to \"help the church know how to minister to people struggling with this sin.\" While calling conversion therapy an \"unbibilical approach to change\" in a blog at the association's website, executive director Heath Lambert also said there are \"positive elements\" to it.\nIn connection with the previous conference last month, Bowman said same-sex marriage \"absolutely would be prohibited by the authority of God.\" He also is a licensed clinical social worker with bachelor's and master's degrees from Wayne State University and pastor of Temple of Faith Baptist Church on Bicknell Avenue in South Louisville.\nBut even though AABA has theological concerns with the Supreme Court decision, it's not out to condemn or judge anyone, he said.\nIts goal is \"to articulate what we believe to be objective truth ... in a gracious and loving manner,\" he said.\nRegarding Davis' actions, Bowman said he believes in civil disobedience. But if he had to do something that violates his conscience as a Christian, \"I simply would probably resign from that position,\" he said.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nPope met with gay man, partner in Davis twist\nThe Sept. 19 symposium attracted about 400 people to Forest Baptist Church, 4500 Petersburg Road in the Newburg area, where the parking lot was overflowing on a Saturday morning.\n\"We wanted to organize this conference so we could speak to all of these relevant, contemporary issues in a manner that is in keeping with the Bible,\" Bowman said.\nOne session, titled \"A Biblical Response to Homosexuality and the LGBTQ Community,\" was led by Aqueena Smith, a licensed professional counselor and director of a Chicago support group \"for those struggling with same-sex attraction,\" as described in the program.\nShe read what she called an \"allegorical\" story about emerging from a dark room with help from a \"friend,\" to be interpreted as Christ. The goal is to move \"from homosexuality to holiness, not heterosexuality,\" she said in her talk.\nTwo other sessions were titled \"Coming Out of Homosexuality\" and \"An Interview With An Overcomer,\" led by Daniel Mingo, founder and director of \"Abba's Delight,\" a Louisville-based ministry to \"born-again believers\" whose lives are \"impacted by homosexuality,\" according to the program.\nChris Hartman, the Fairness Campaign's director, takes the opposite view from the AABA group, saying \"it remains frustrating that so many folks claiming religious authority seem so fixated\" on the LGBT community \"and the idea that one can potentially change their sexual orientation or gender identity.\"\n\"We know how dangerous it is to suggest that that could be true and to attempt that sort of change through reparative therapy, which has been banned in many places,\" he said. \"We know that it leads to increased numbers of teenage suicides\" continuing into adulthood.\nHartman also cited the \"sort of torment that folks suffer who really just need other folks in their lives to accept them for who they are.\"\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nKim Davis should do her job, most in poll say\nSuicide and depression are the two main outcomes, he said.\nThe AABA symposium was designed to bring issues out into the open that \"are not openly discussed in many black churches,\" perhaps owing to a legacy of secrecy and shame related to past mistreatment, Bowman said.\nAmong the other local churches represented in the AABA group are Centennial Olivet Baptist, Greater Salem Baptist, Bible Community Fellowship Baptist, Watson Memorial Baptist, Spirit Anew Ministries and Promised Land Community Church.\nLa'Shonda Fletcher, a marriage and family therapist, recently opened Revelation Counseling Center at New Revelations Ministries church, 1040 S. Preston St., where she is co-pastor with her husband, Carl. She said she had not heard of the AABA group and wouldn't want to judge its stance with regard to LGBT issues.\n\"We don't all believe the same way,\" she said.\nBut Fletcher, who has two master's degrees from the Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary and is author of a book called \"The Black Church and Mental Health,\" said she would take a neutral stance and consider each person's individual situation and desires.\n\"Everybody's not the same,\" she said. \"You have people that have different struggles. My struggle is not your struggle. You have a wide spectrum of different people with different beliefs and different opinions.\"\nWhile she believes God is the ultimate authority, the scriptures can be interpreted in different ways, she said. Her goal would be \"to show as much love as I possibly can across the board,\" she said.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nLocals condemn, praise Davis' visit with pope\nThe Rev. Kevin Cosby, pastor of St. Stephen Baptist Church on South 15th Street in west Louisville, did not respond to a message seeking comment for an earlier story about religious leaders' reactions to the Kim Davis situation. But he said later on Twitter that his \"silence\" was because \"I choose 2 focus on issues West of 9th.\"\nThe AABA symposium sessions at Forest Baptist on LGBTQ issues were among about a dozen in all, also dealing with such topics as sexual abstinence outside of marriage, cohabitation, pornography and sexual abuse and exploitation.\nThere's no more emphasis on any one \"sin\" than another, as if any one is greater than the other, Bowman said.\nThe Rev. Curtis A. Woods, associate executive director for convention relations for the Kentucky Baptist Convention, said in his talk on \"A Sexual Revolution in the Black Church\" that it originally was formed to offer protection during times of \"human bondage in America.\"\nHe urged audience members still to look to their bibles for guidance, saying, \"May it never be that we allow the culture to stand above Christ in this world.\"\nBowman said members of the AABA group are assessing the first symposium and praying for direction. In many ways, the outcome exceeded the group's expectations, he said.\n\"We would have been happy to have 100 or 200 people,\" he said.\nThe group also hopes to reach the hip-hop generation, many of whom lose interest in religion from age 18 through young adulthood, Bowman said. \"They no longer see the church as relevant.\"\nReporter Martha Elson can be reached at (502) 582-7061 and melson@courier-journal.com .
