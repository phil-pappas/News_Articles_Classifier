Bears won 22-20. By HUB ARKUSH – harkush@chicagofootball.com \nFrom @jermaine611: Are you a believer in [Marquess] Wilson yet? \nDepends on what you want me to believe? \nHe’s showing signs he can be an effective No. 4 or maybe No. 3, but he still has to get a lot more consistent catching the ball, run better routes and show he can separate from defenders. \nWilson has shown the ability to make the occasional big play, but he hasn’t really been a target of Cutler’s on third down, and without Alshon Jeffery and Eddie Royal in the lineup he has to be available to the quarterback most of the time in those situations if he’s going to be any more than a third receiver. \nAt the end of the day, he’s given the Bears decent production the past couple of games, but he still has to get open more consistently before you can be convinced he’s an answer. \nFrom @CanuckBoy670AM: Hub, what have you heard about the Von Miller contract situation? With cap $$ and John Fox, do you see the Bears in bidding? \nThe contract Miller will be looking at will be the one Justin Houston, a very comparable player just got, $52.2 million guaranteed, $101 million over six years. The Bears will have plenty of room to get involved there if they want to. \nThe question is, did the Broncos draft Shane Ray to groom as the heir apparent to DeMarcus Ware, who is under contract through 2017, or as insurance if they are unable to squeeze Miller under their cap. \nDenver has committed huge deals to Demaryius Thomas, Ryan Clady, Louis Vasquez, Ware, Aquib Talib, Chris Harris Jr., T.J. Ward, and, of course, Peyton Manning, should he decide to come back with about 20 percent of their roster really straining the cap. \nThe other question, of course, is if Manning is done, will Miller want to stay in Denver? \nI suspect Miller will hit the market and will command a lot of interest for a lot of money, and there’s no reason the Bears shouldn’t be in the mix. They certainly haven’t drafted anyone, nor do they have any young veterans who can give them what Miller could. \nThe one thing to remember about Miller is he’s had a couple of suspensions already for some pretty goofy behavior, and a team is going to have to tie up a big piece of its cap on him so you better be able to trust him. \nFrom @jtbaczak: Enjoying last 2 games as a fan but if Forte is not in plans for 2016 why are they using him so much instead of more Langford? \nFirst of all, no one has decided whether or not Forte is in the Bears' plans for 2016 or not. It makes no sense to give him a contract extension right now. The market’s not going to go any higher and it’s likely to shrink from here no matter what he does. \nBut should Forte finish another Pro Bowl-caliber season healthy and showing an interest in doing a short-term deal with the Bears, he could very well end up coming back on a two- or three-year front-loaded deal. \nIs that something the Bears will want to do? That, I can’t tell you right now. \nAs far as Langford goes, my sense is Fox would love to use him more and probably will now that Jacquizz Rodgers is done for the year. But it’s been Langford keeping Langford out of the lineup lately, not the coach. \nI suspect he needs to improve his blocking, pass protection and receiving skills to earn more regular and more consistent playing time. \nFrom @MDayne: With Grasu appearing to do well when are we going to see Tayo Fabuluje? \nWhoa, let’s slow down for just a second. Hroniss Grasu got off to a really slow start and then improved as the game went on in Kansas City. Whether or not he’s doing well is going to take at least a couple more weeks to figure out. \nAs far as Fabuluje goes, the first thing he has to do to get on the field is prove that he’s in NFL condition. \nNext, he has to show he’s picked up enough technique and experience to get on the field in a game that counts and not hurt his team. \nOnce you’re there, you have to tell me which two of these three you want to bench to get Fabuluje out there, Jermon Bushrod, Charles Leno Jr. or Kyle Long? \nYes that was a trick question. You’re obviously not putting Fabuluje in for Long \nThe point was if Fabuluje is going to play you have to bench Bushrod and Leno and I don’t think the team will be anywhere near that for a while. \nFrom @steveoatms: With [Jacquizz] Rodgers’ injury, is Langford now the #2 RB? Who will be his backup? \nYes, Langford is clearly Matt Forte’s primary backup now, and I think the Bears would like to know who No. 3 is, too. \nCommon sense suggests it would be Ka’Deem Carey who was No. 4 on the depth chart, but there are no signals that Fox wants Carey on the field. \nPart of Carey’s issues is the third running back usually has to be somewhat indispensable on special teams and Carey isn’t. In fact, it’s not clear you’d want him playing special teams at all. \nAntone Smith was No. 3 to Rodgers in Atlanta last year, the Bears signed him last week, and I imagine after the bye he’ll be No. 3. \nFrom @JohnyGrady: Will Kevin White return at any point this season, realistically? \nI have no inside knowledge of his surgery, rehabilitation, what exactly that rehab for a surgically repaired stress fracture is or whether he is behind, on or ahead of schedule right now. \nI do know the Bears probably don’t want to risk him at all unless he’s at least 90 or 95 percent, and it won’t be shocking if he’s not there by the end of the season. \nYou have to remember even though White was the seventh player taken overall in the draft, he still was a real prospect with a ton to learn about playing receiver at the NFL level. \nMy guess is they’d love to have him back at practice as soon as possible, but rushing him on to the field is another matter. \nI don’t expect to see White in a game until 2016, and certainly no sooner than Week 13 or 14 if they do try and see where he’s at this year. \n• Chicago Football editor Hub Arkush can be reached at harkush@chicagofootball.com or on Twitter @Hub_Arkush.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:32:44.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
