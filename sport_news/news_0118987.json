The Steelers? The person who has his finger on the button and is assigned to turn it on and off?\nMORE: Top photos from Week 5 | Top 10 Steelers of all time | NFL's most controversial calls\nNo one noticed the 18 seconds that disappeared just as the Steelers commenced their game-winning drive in a 24-20 road victory over the Chargers , which ended on Le’Veon Bell’s too-close-for-comfort 1-yard touchdown run as time expired.\nThe NFL declined to comment about that 18-second gap, according to Kevin Seifert of ESPN .\nSteelers coach Mike Tomlin’s reaction, when informed of the clock error: “I wasn’t aware of that, no … it didn’t change the outcome of the game.”\nRookie kicker Josh Lambo gave the Chargers a 20-17 lead with 2:59 left when he nailed a 54-yard field goal, his second of the game. He then kicked off, deep enough that it was not returned. When the touchback was signaled, 2:56 was on the clock.\nBut when Michael Vick lined up to take the first snap of Pittsburgh’s final drive, the clock read: 2:38. So after Vick completed passes to Darrius Heyward-Bey for 9 and 15 yards, and after Vick had scrambled — vintage Vick-style — up the middle for 24 yards, and after he’d found tight end Heath Miller just short of the goal line for 16 yards, and after a roughness penalty moved the ball within a half-yard of the goal line, only 5 seconds remained.\nPittsburgh ran Bell out of the Wildcat formation, and he chewed up all of the remaining 5 seconds in getting the ball just over the goal line before his knee hit the turf. It was an actual buzzer-beating touchdown, something we rarely see in the NFL. But it shouldn’t have happened here, either.\n© Jake Roth/USA TODAY Sports Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Mike Vick passes during the fourth quarter against the San Diego Chargers at Qualcomm Stadium.
