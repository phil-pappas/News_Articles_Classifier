But it was molded, nurtured. Familia’s physical and mental strength to record his first-ever six-out save that finished the Dodgers on Thursday in the Mets’ NLDS-clinching 3-2 victory didn’t just arrive in the eighth inning. Recall Opening Day in Washington.\nWith a laundry list of pitchers on the disabled list, the Mets called the bullpen for eventual Knucklehead of the Year Jenrry Mejia, in his pre-PED suspensions life, to prepare to close. His elbow tightened. Mets manager Terry Collins was adamant afterwards of his confidence Familia could close if Mejia were sidelined.\nFamilia after allowing heartbreaking home run to Padres’ Justin Upton.

Collins’ response?\n“He’s still going to be the closer,” Collins said. “We’ll hopefully get his confidence back.”\nOh, it came back. Guys lacking confidence don’t tie franchise records with 43 saves. They don’t record six-out saves in Division Series clinchers. So when the eighth inning arrived Thursday, the Mets couldn’t have held Familia back with chains and cinder blocks.\n“This was my first. I wanted to be out there,” Familia said of his two-inning save that ended with overpowering strikeouts of A.J. Ellis and Howie Kendrick. “When I got here, [the staff] told me if we had the lead, you’re going in, so I prepared for that. The ninth inning, I felt great.\n“They trust me. That’s why my confidence has grown. My coaches, teammates trust me.”\nWhat’s not to trust? Collins admitted there was pregame discussion over using Noah Syndergaard in relief and Familia for two innings.\n“He’s gotten four-out saves and five-out saves. Why not six?” GM Sandy Alderson said of the closer, who retired all 16 batters he faced in the NLDS.\nYour browser does not support iframes. “I told them, ‘If we’ve got the lead in the eighth inning, we’ve got to roll the dice,’” Collins said. “We’ve got … one of the best closers in all of baseball. You’ve got to go to him. You’d be kicking yourself if they scored a run off somebody else when that guy should be in a game that means everything. So we stayed with the plan, and it worked.”\nPerfectly. The Dodgers went meekly against Familia, who turned 26 on Saturday. One out was a grounder to the box. Another was a pinch-hit fly out by New York super villain Chase Utley, And there were two strikeouts.\nSyndergaard would have liked to continue after pitching the seventh, but…\n“I had the utmost confidence in the managerial decision to bring in Familia. He’s the best closer in the game, and he did exactly what we thought he was going to do, and that is shut the door,” Syndergaard said.\n“You bring in Familia for six outs, he’s a great closer, but six outs is tough to get,” Curtis Granderson said. “But he was able to do it and field his position, which … kept his pitch count down, which made him very effective. We all had confidence that he would.”\n  jeurys familia ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  terry collins", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:45:06.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
