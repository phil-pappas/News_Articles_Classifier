Ireland first play Italy on Sunday. \nIt was not always straightforward for Les Bleus. The Canucks' gutsy performance was rewarded with tries from DTH van der Merwe and Aaron Carpenter, but there was to be no repeat of their solitary win over France, 21 years ago, at the ninth attempt. \nCanada play Romania in Leicester next Tuesday, seeking to sign off from the tournament with a win. \nThe game was little more than three minutes old when Michalak darted down the blindside, evaded two would-be tacklers and then passed out of the back of his hand. Fofana was on his shoulder to score. \nThierry Dusautoir was all-action, as usual, and made a crucial tackle before contributing to a ruck which saw France turn over the ball five metres from their own line. \nCanada continued to apply pressure, but France survived a charged-down kick and Nathan Hirayama's drop-goal attempt fell short before another moment of inspiration from Michalak. \nThe fly-half scythed through the Canucks defence and floated a chip over. All Fofana had to do was claim the bouncing ball, but it bounced through his hands. \nA more agricultural route resulted in success after first Grosso and then Sebastien Tillous-Borde were held short. Next Guirado wriggled over from close range. \nCanada immediately responded as scrum-half Phil Mack sniped round a ruck to be held short, sucking in French defenders. \nThe ball was swiftly spread wide to the left and Van der Merwe completed the overlap. Hirayama converted. \nCanada continued to show ambition, running a kickable penalty and punching holes in the France defence. \nAnd they were rewarded when Carpenter barged over from close range after a ruck. \nFrance also spurned a shot at goal to kick for the corner and next drove forwards, with Slimani peeling round the maul to score. Michalak again converted. \nCanada lost captain Tyler Ardron and full-back Harry Jones to injury in the first half, but kept themselves in contention early in the second as Hirayama kicked two penalties, reducing the deficit to six points. But that was as good as it got. \nLes Bleus had already been looking for a fourth try and with it the bonus point, but Michalak opted to kick to restore the advantage to nine points. \nFrance, camped in Canadian territory, showed further brute force as Pape barged over and Michalak converted. \nCanada had Nanyak Dala sin-binned with eight minutes remaining and Grosso touched down in the corner on the overlap. \nMorgan Parra converted to complete a resounding win.
