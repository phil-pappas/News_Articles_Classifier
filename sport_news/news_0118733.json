He blamed the beating on the mound not being to his liking.\nCueto told fellow pitcher Edinson Volquez, who starts Game 5 for the Royals on Wednesday — on the same mound Cueto was knocked from — he thought the Blue Jays somehow were swiping signs.\nCueto isn’t the first person to believe the Blue Jays knew what was coming. When current Toronto catcher Russell Martin was with the Yankees, he accused the Blue Jays of stealing signs at home.\n“I think he said, [Monday night] they had a guy in center field,’’ Volquez said of Cueto, who threw a wad of bubble gum on the artificial turf as he was exiting the game. “He looks to center field and he sees somebody do this or that, it’s really hard to do that. I don’t know, but he said that.\n“When a guy gets on second base he said something about that, too, that they were giving signs to the hitter, but I don’t know.’’\nTalk of the Blue Jays stealing signs has been going on for years because even when they were horrid, they hit well at home — whether it was called SkyDome or Rogers Centre.\nVisiting players have accused the Blue Jays of having somebody hidden in the center-field fence or in the seats tipping off hitters with hand signals. Others, including Martin, have accused Blue Jays runners on second base using hand and foot movements to alert batters of pitch location.\n“That’s what I hear. We have a lot of friends on different teams, they always say that they give signs,’’ Volquez said. “But I don’t go crazy with it. You can tell if you are good or not when you are pitching, the way they take pitches and maybe the guy moving to second base or whatever it is but I don’t keep that in my mind.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:58:23.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
