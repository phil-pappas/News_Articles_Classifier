Somebody who should be in Columbus is going to be sitting at home,” DeLoach said. “The second-round bracket is tough this year.” \nDespite the lack of competition against the Lady Vikings, DeLoach used the opportunity to play his entire roster. \nAll three pitchers went to the circle with Rachel Vaughan throwing a perfect game in the opener. The sophomore southpaw, who plays first when not in the pitching circle, struck out six, walked one, and had just one pitch leave the infield. \nSenior Morgan Goree, who started game two, allowed her first batter to reach base, but was unhittable from there, striking out eight of the nine recorded outs through three innings. \nThe Lady Vikings scored their only run in the doubleheader in the top of the fourth, but relief pitcher Kelley Lynch struck out the side to end the contest by the mercy rule. \nEast Coweta outhit the Lakeside DeKalb 23-1 and the Lady Vikings committed 15 errors over the two games. \nEast Coweta took control of game one with two runs in the first, three in the third, two in the fourth and one in the fifth. \nThe Lady Indians picked plenty of support from the top of the order in the first game with seniors Mekhia Freeman and Madison Carter each driving in a run. Carter finished the contest with a 3-for-3 performance. \nIn addition to a strong pitching performance Vaughan also drove in a run. Ashlynn Gunter and Lindsey Warren also had an RBI in the first game, with Vaughan, Gunter and Warren each posting doubles. \nFreeman and A.J. Estrada each with triples. \nEast Coweta put the second game away early, scoring 10 run in the first two innings. \nIn addition to her pitching performance, Lynch led second contest by going 3-for-4 at the plate with three RBIs, two of which came on a two-run homer in the top of the fourth. \nFreeman added to her offensive totals in the second game with an RBI. \nVaughan, Sheynne Bell, Gunter, Warren, Jessica Barber and Jamie Vitale also drove in runs in game two. \n“The good thing about a game like this is we were able to get a lot of different players into the lineup,” Deloach said. “We wanted to use all three of our pitchers and we did.” More", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T09:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T23:47:01.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
