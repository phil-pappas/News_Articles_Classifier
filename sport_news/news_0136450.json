Records fall in Wahpeton’s 4th win Daily News file photo \nDylan Wiek hauled in an 11-yard touchdown reception in Wahpeton’s fourth-straight win. Some records last longer than others and two Wahpeton football records set last season were topped Friday night. The dominant duo of quarterback Carson Zarak and his deep threat Isaac Erickson tore it up in the Huskies’ 47-12 win over the Central Cass, North Dakota, Squirrels at home. Zarak broke his own passing yards in a game record of 316 with 343, while his receiver torched the Squirrel secondary for 173 receiving yards to beat out Blaze Irwin’s record set last season. Central Cass took the lead in the first quarter when Jack Morris hit Tate Camas for the 21-yard TD and the first score allowed by the Wahpeton defense in the last three games. Zarak, who rushed for nearly 200 yards and five TDs last week, answered with a 68-yard rushing score for Wahpeton’s lone touchdown of the first quarter. “We started off a little slow, but in the second quarter we really got into a groove and didn’t really look back,” Wahpeton coach Brian Dokken said. The Huskies dominated the second quarter outscoring the Squirrels 20-0. Dylan Wiek reeled in a TD reception from 11 yards out and Wahpeton punched in a pair of rushing scores with Tyler Wohlers scooting in for a 19-yard touchdown and Erickson marching in for a three-yard touchdown. The defense didn’t allow another score until early in the fourth quarter in another impressive showing. “I think our defense is getting so much better every week. Tackling is something we’ve stressed a lot since the first game,” Dokken said. “The kids are buying in to what we’re doing and the defense knows they’ll need to play well for us to make a title run. We need to make sure we keep it up.” Erickson went deep for the long ball and scored his second TD of the game from 85 yards out. Zarak found Beau Gilles for a 28-yard score to add to the lead. Erickson’s huge night came on only four catches and they were all sending No. 34 deep. “It was nice to finally connect on some of those, too. We’ve always had the threat of it and last night we actually connected on some of them,” Dokken said. “When (Erickson) catches the ball in stride there’s not very many people that can catch him. That’s something we really need to do to stretch the defense.” Zarak’s huge night wasn’t done yet. The big-play senior capped off the most productive passing performance of his career with a huge play on defense. Zarak scooped a fumble and took it 95 yards for the Huskies’ final TD of the night. “Carson played really well on defense, too. He had a very complete game,” Dokken said. “He’s becoming a pretty good threat for us on defense, too.” Wahpeton (4-2) moves on to play Fargo Shanley on the road. It’s the biggest game on the team’s schedule and not only likely determines the conference champions, but also plays a factor in home field advantage in the playoffs. “That’s a big one. We’re both undefeated in the conference and it’ll probably be for the conference championship. Home field advantage is at stake and I don’t think we’ve beaten these guys since 2009,” Dokken said. “We’re going to have our hands full and they’re going to be very physical. Hopefully we can play well and not make many mistakes.” Kickoff is set for 7 p.m. Friday night.
