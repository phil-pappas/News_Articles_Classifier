Right now, the coaches like AAC member Memphis (5-0), which is ranked 25th.\nWhat provides some extra boost to the Bandwagon as it chugs along to its final destination, - either the Peach Bowl in Atlanta or the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Ariz. - is the number of AAC schools recognized.\nWith teams having played four or five games, the American has established itself as the best among the \"Group of Five\" conferences, the tier just below the Power Five in college football.\nThe highest ranked champion from one of those conferences - which includes the Mid-American, Conference USA, Mountain West and Sun Belt - is guaranteed an at-large bid into a College Football Playoffs New Year's Six bowl game, either the Peach or Fiesta this season.\nThe AAC's status will be big going into Selection Sunday on Dec. 6, when the College Football Playoff semifinals and other NY6 bowl bids are announced.\nRealistically, if Temple runs the table in its conference schedule and wins the AAC Championship Game on Dec. 5, the Owls must be champions to be considered for the automatic bid.\nA loss on Halloween at Lincoln Financial Field to non-conference foe Notre Dame is the only one they could suffer that would not eliminate them from consideration over Boise State, which now has an established reputation.\nThe overall strength of the AAC, however, is a NY6 lifeline for Temple, as long as it handles its business.\nBoise State (4-1), of the Mountain West, is the highest-ranked team from the Group of Five. With wins over Pac-12 Washington, and at ACC Virginia, the Broncos are 24th in the coaches poll and 25th in the AP poll.\nBoise has only Mountain West opponents left on its schedule, so it is unlikely to lose again.\nStill the Mountain West lacks overall quality, so, while Boise, which lost to Brigham Young, will likely hold its Top 25 ranking, the opportunity to rise significantly will not be there.\nThat does not apply to the AAC's best teams: Temple, Houston, Memphis and Navy, all of which entered Week 6 undefeated. The AAC already has wins over Louisville, Kansas, Miami, Penn State and Virginia Tech, which is, among the Group of Five, the most wins over Power 5 schools.\nThose Power 5 schools will win games during conference play, thus enhancing the profiles of the AAC schools that beat them.\nFor Temple, that opening win over Penn State still has more to give.\nIt is not a stretch to think that if any of the undefeated AAC schools runs the table, it will likely become that highest ranked champion from the Group of Five.\nThe CFP Selection Committee has said strength of schedule plays a large role in its rankings for the semifinals and the other NY6 bowls.\nThe best way in for a Group of Five team is to play in the strongest conference and beat Power 5 opponents.\nNow let us wrap this back to why things look good for Temple. The Owls won at AAC preseason favorite Cincinnati, which has not lived up to hype, but did just handily beat Miami, of the ACC.\nTemple plays in the AAC East. Houston, Memphis and Navy play in the West, meaning only one even has a possibility of finishing the regular season undefeated.\nTemple does not have Houston or Navy in the regular season. The Owls play Memphis at home on Nov. 21, a week after the Tigers play at Houston and two weeks after they host Navy.\nAll things are in line for Temple to host the inaugural AAC Championship Game.\nIf the Owls are undefeated, including wins over Penn State and Notre Dame, an undefeated Toledo, not Boise State, would be the only Group of Five team that could be considered along with the Owls.\nThe Rockets (4-0) are 24th in the AP poll and have Power 5 wins at Arkansas and over Iowa State. Those wins would not equal Temple beating Penn State and Notre Dame - plus the AAC is 3-0 against the Mid-American Conference.\nIt is a 784 miles from Philadelphia to Atlanta, a sprint, compared with the 2,386-mile marathon to Glendale. The Temple Bandwagon is up for either.", "external_links": ["http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=collegegearArticle&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2Fpages%2FCOLLEGE"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:07:24.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
