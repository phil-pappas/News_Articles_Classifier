The U.S. Soccer Federation president hired Klinsmann in 2011 to overhaul the men’s national team program and, following Saturday night’s 3-2 overtime loss to Mexico, Gulati may remain one of the dwindling number of people who think the World Cup-winning striker can pull it off.\nGulati gave Klinsmann a sympathetic and reassuring pat on the back. His team had fought through the stifling Rose Bowl heat and two deficits to take Mexico to within a couple minutes of a shootout in Saturday’s gripping Confederations Cup playoff. The U.S. had displayed all the grit, hustle and resilience that have been its trademarks for so long. On many occasions, those qualities have made the difference against a Mexican team that can lack certain intangibles or somehow manages to field a squad that’s less than the sum of its parts. Klinsmann was 3-0-3 against El Tri as U.S. manager.\nBut on Saturday, those American attributes weren’t enough. Mexico was better. El Tri dictated the play, put the U.S. under pressure throughout the match and won deservedly thanks in part to two stunning goals that symbolized that difference in attacking quality between the two sides. • WATCH THE GOALS: Chicharito | Cameron | Peralta | Wood | Aguilar\n“We didn’t really have a hold of the game. We defended for long stretches,” forward Jozy Altidore said. “We just weren’t able to keep hold of the ball. They were able to dictate the game and just had us chasing, playing very deep … It’s difficult to play a team like that, playing that way for 120 minutes.”\nKlinsmann has said since he was appointed that he wants his team to be the one that puts an opponent on its heels. That hasn’t been happening. Sometimes, like at the 2014 World Cup, the U.S. can chase a game but still find a way to get a good result. That’s been the national team’s hallmark. But other times, like at this summer’s CONCACAF Gold Cup or on Saturday, the Americans fell short. Some may believe it’s because of Klinsmann. Others, like Gulati, will argue that an inability to routinely win the possession battle and create more chances against a quality opponent—or the lack of consistent, game-breaking technical skill—is a problem endemic to American soccer. It’s the very reason Klinsmann was hired.\nPlanet Futbol Video Mexico tops United States 3-2 in thrilling CONCACAF Cup by Brian Straus", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/BrianStraus"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:57:27.939+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
