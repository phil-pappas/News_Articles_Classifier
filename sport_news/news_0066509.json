Palumbo said he expects the school to hold a rally next week prior to Mathews’ final regular season game at Windham. At that time, the seniors will be recognized. \nThe blow of having the game canceled was softened by the fact that Mathews actually benefited from a computer rankings standpoint. \nNewbury is currently 0-7. A Mathews win over the Black Knights would have given the Mustangs very little computer points. With the game being canceled, Mathews’ divisor drops, and their overall points will be adjusted based on an eight-game schedule (Mathews earlier defeated a club team that isn’t recognized by the Ohio High School Athletic Association). \nA similar scenario played out in 2006 when Walsh Jesuit was scheduled to play a game in Buffalo, N.Y. The game was canceled because of a late-October snowstorm. As a result, Wash Jesuit’s divisor dropped and it finished fourth in its region. WJ hosted Niles in a first-round game. Had WJ played and won its game, it would have finished fifth while Niles would have moved to the fourth spot. \n“We’re actually going to get more points from an open date than if we would have played Newbury and won, which is kind of crazy,” Palumbo said. “But we obviously didn’t want our home schedule to end this way.” \nThere is also the hope that Mathews will in fact still get the opportunity to play in front of the home fans. The Mustangs are currently ranked sixth in Division VII, Region 23. \n“We’ve crunched the numbers, and if we win our final two games, we’re pretty confident we can slide into the fourth spot and host a first-round game,” Palumbo said. \nPLAYOFF PROJECTIONS \nWith just two weeks left in the regular season, Mathews is among 25 area teams which still have their eyes set on the post-season. \nThree of those teams — Poland, Crestview and Warren John F. Kennedy — have already mathematically secured a playoff berth. Three others — Austintown Fitch, Salem and Columbiana — are a near lock to advance, regardless of how the rest of the season plays out. \nFor the others in contention, it’s a matter of winning the right game (or in some cases winning both games) and watching the out-of-town scoreboard. \nThe playoffs begin tonight for Boardman, Warren Harding, Howland, Canfield, West Branch, Hubbard, LaBrae, South Range and East Palestine. For those nine schools, a pair of wins to end the season means a near 100-percent chance of moving on. A loss in either of the final two weeks would most likely mean elimination. \nIn some cases, head-to-head games will narrow the field. The loser of tonight’s Howland-Canfield game will almost certainly be on the outside looking in. Next week,, East Palestine visits South Range, Harding travels to Howland and Lakeview hosts Struthers in a trio of games which might decide the playoff fate of all teams involved. \nLakeview has a better than 90-percent chance if it wins its final two games, while Struthers would need to win out and get a decent amount of outside help. \nUrsuline and Mooney meet tonight at Stambaugh Stadium. The winner will earn a playoff spot. The loser will still advance with a win in Week 10. However, Ursuline closes at Akron St. Vincent-St. Mary (7-1) while Mooney hosts Fitch (6-2). \nDespite starting out 7-0, Lisbon still needs to win tonight at Leetonia and a slight bit of outside help to assure itself a top-eight finish. A home win next week over Crestview would guarantee the Blue Devils a spot. \nBrookfield, Western Reserve and Jaskson-Milton all need to win their final two games to solidify, but not guarantee, advancement. \nMcDonald currently owns the eighth spot in Division 6, Region 19. However, even should the Blue Devils win their final two games, they will more than likely drop in the rankings. \nWrite Vindicator correspondent Steve Ruman at sports@vindy.com and follow him on Twitter, @steveruman.
