It was one of the first words out of Bronco Mendenhall’s mouth after the victory.\nThe win lifted the Cougars to 5-2 on the season heading into what should be a walkover win against Wagner next week.\nNo, this game wasn’t the marquee matchup Utah State got with Boise State in a huge MWC showdown and Aggie victory and it didn’t carry the weight of Utah’s game with Arizona State in the Pac-12 on Saturday.\nBut in the realm BYU has chosen as an independent, this was a crucial momentum game for Mendenhall’s team, which analysts say played the nation’s toughest schedule in September. BYU is fighting for a return to the Top 25 rankings. Potentially if the Big 12 is looking to add a team or two, this was a night in which two candidates were on stage.\nA loss would have been a killer.\nBut Friday night the Cougars showed some of what Mendenhall demands: nasty grittiness. His team had to claw and scratch from behind and once it did, it outscored the Bearcats 35-7, 14-0 in the crucial fourth quarter.\nThe Bearcats, a team that was averaging almost 600 yards and 40 points a game, looking like a team that might do just that. Mendenhall took the blame and said once he saw what Cincy’s offense was doing, he adjusted with a simple plan to counter it.\nIt worked.\nIt came with a defense that had been gashed and thrown past by Cincy freshman QB sensation Hayden Moore. Mendenhall’s adjustment time was 15 minutes.\nThe comeback came from the arm of BYU freshman Tanner Mangum, who started slow then later killed the Bearcats with precision strikes.\n“He wasn’t able to practice much all week and it was a matter of him adjusting to game speed,” said Mendenhall of Mangum.\nBYU’s defense shook off Cincy's big plays in the first 20 minutes to eventually sack Moore eight times. Many of those were coverage sacks. Moore had no one open in crunch time. The significance of that became huge as the game wound down. Bronson Kaufusi had of the nine sacks. Cincy had allowed just five sacks all season and BYU had seven by halftime, five in the first quarter.\n“When teams get yards on us, it wakes us up,” said Kaufusi.\nMangum started the game overthrowing his targets. After intermission, he was slicing and dicing, as accurate as he’s been all season. He began the game 5 of 15. He ended the game completing a sizzling 14 of 17 in the second half. He finished 19 of 32 for 252 yards and two touchdown passes, both to Nick Kurtz.\nBYU began the game looking all but cooked. But in the end, the Cougars outgained the Bearcats 449 to 341. In the end, BYU's offense and defense looked clearly superior.\nThe Cougars overcame another sluggish start filled with a myriad of pretty dumb penalties in critical situations. The seasoned receivers had at least seven dropped passes and a lackluster Mangum, who was nursing his pulled hamstring muscle all week long, looked harried, and he struggled.\nResilient.\nThis game had all the markings of disaster when the Cougars fell behind 10-0 after witnessing the nation’s fifth-ranked passing offense shred their defense while amassing 205 yards to BYU's 19 in the first quarter. The Bearcats ran 51 plays to BYU’s 24 in the first half and took a 17-10 lead into intermission.\nResilient? Well, it’s a word the dictionary describes as to bounce back, recoil, spring back into shape after bending, stretching or being compressed. Even Mangum used it.\n“Keep playing, keep believing,” is how Mangum described BYU. He said big fourth quarters have become the Cougars' identity in 2015.\nIt was again Friday.\nA year ago, after losing Taysom Hill, this team was in a four-game losing streak, a spiral that was disappointing and tough to witness after a 4-0 start and national attention.\nTo be 5-2 at this stage without Hill and Jamaal Williams is resilient to the core.\nNow, lowly Wagner stands between BYU and bowl eligibility. The Cougars then get a bye week before traveling to San Jose State.\nAfter Friday night's fight to the finish, the Cougars are a team that could use a break about now.\nEMAIL: dharmon@deseretnews.com . \nTWITTER: Harmonwrites", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:33:14.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
