This season's state sectional field for the Mounties will include highly-competitive squads such as Morristown and Randolph, who could pose a threat. \nAs Mercuro ponders the possibilities moving forward as far as her team's prospects in the states, she knows what she has seen for sure from her fairly inexperienced group this season. \n\"Every day I see improvement,\" she said. \"We made it to the county finals again and now the work continues, but I know our girls will keep battling. \n\"Any time we step on the field I don't think any team is saying, 'Oh, easy win, Montclair.' \n\"We'll continue to fight and work as hard as we can to continue to get better.\" \nAlong with today's contest against Kent Place the Mountie stickers have two more regular season games (2 p.m. Saturday at Governor Livingston and 4 p.m. Monday at home vs. Wallkill Valley). \nMaggie Bigelow, a center back who has 2 goals and 2 assists to her credit, and Emily Asterita, a center forward who has 6 goals and 6 helps, continue to do a great job leading the team as the senior co-captains. \n\"Maggie helped lead the way against West Essex's corners, which they had a ton of (22) and she's been a sturdy performer for us back there all season long,\" continued Mercuro. \"Emily has been consistently strong as well.\" \nRounding out the starting lineup are senior central midfielder Taylor Dana (2 goals, 5 assists), junior right midfielder Eva Kaplan (11 and 13), junior right wing Natalie Rechan (8 and 6), Victoria McLoughlin, a senior sweeper who has made three goal-line saves, senior left wing Hannah Brautigan (9 and 1), her twin sister, right back Amelia (2 assists), junior left back Lila Taylor (3 and 3), senior left midfielder Isabelle Gauval (8 assists) and Cassandra Cardenas, a senior cage-controller who has made 82 saves and registered nine shutouts. \nAlso seeing substantial varsity playing time are junior left wing Marley Schwartz (9 goals), the soph midfielder Wrede (7 and 1), senior forward Melissa Rosenthal, the soph center forward Van Siclen, junior middie Cristina McManamey, senior midfielder Gabby Gammon, senior back Lea Shapiro and the 10th-grade midfielder Heath. The capable back-up net minder is Anjali Abram. \nAs far as the ECT final at Wessex proceeded, Julia Russo, one of a number of key sophomores developing quickly as top-notch high school players for West Essex, put her team up 1-0 with 24:51 remaining in the first half, coming just a couple of minutes after the Lady Knights prevented Montclair's best chance of the afternoon as Kaplan was able to create a 1-on-1 with West Essex senior goalie Paige Innarella, who managed to force the Mountie aggressor wide as the home team's defense was then able to quickly regroup. \nWest Essex junior midfielder Jordyn Thies (2 goals and 1 assist) made it 2-0 with 8:37 left in the first half with her first of two goals. \nOne of the Lady Knights key freshmen, left wing Julia Vardiamn, scored her first of two goals just 31 seconds into the second half off a nice cross from Ashley Iannuzzi. The team's leading scorer, junior forward Lia Sinisi (24 goals on the season) made it 4-0 with an assist from Vardiman with 21:16 remaining in the contest. \nThies, off a Russo feed, with 18:45 still showing, and Vardiman, again, with only 2:26 remaining, closed out the scoring in a very productive county final for the surging Lady Knights. \nCardenas finished with 17 saves for the Mounties, who were outshot 23-5.
