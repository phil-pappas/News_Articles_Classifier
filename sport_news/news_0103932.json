Scheduled as Greencastle-Antrim’s Homecoming opponent, Northern York hit early and often Friday night at Kaley Field, physically overpowering the Blue Devils en route to a 38-14 Mid-Penn Colonial Division victory. Uncharacteristic of this 2015 squad, G-A (6-2, 2-2 MPC-Colonial) was on its heels throughout, as the Polar Bears (7-1, 5-0 MPC-Colonial) gashed their way to 446 total yards while holding what has been a high-powered Blue Devil offense to season lows in yards (213) and points. Most impressive was Northern’s punishing ground attack, rushing 38 times for 289 yards, headlined by two 100-plus yard performances from Bobby Shelly (134) and Curtis Robison (121). “This is a tough one,” G-A head coach Chuck Tinninis said. “They took it to us on both sides of the ball and then the turnovers in the second half killed us. I didn’t think they’d be able to run on us like that, but give them credit, they just outplayed us.” Despite successfully moving the ball from the opening possession, two Northern fumbles — both recovered by Greencastle’s Jeremy Anderson — kept the Blue Devils within reach trailing just 14-7 at halftime. After Robison came down with a fantastic interception to end G-A’s promising first drive of the third quarter, the Polar Bears seized control, albeit backed up at their own 2. Facing third-and-11, Robison connected with Andrew Swaisgood along the left sideline, where Swaisgood broke a tackle and sprinted 98 yards to paydirt, silencing the capacity home crowd. Now trailing by 14, Kyrin Zimmerman gave G-A a momentary spark on the ensuing kickoff, finding space on his way to a 92-yard return for a touchdown, cutting the deficit to 21-14. Following a Northern punt, the Blue Devils went back to work from their own 25, down just one possession in the late stages of the third. From there, things quickly unraveled. The first of two lost G-A fumbles set the Polar Bears up at the 5, where Michael Kearney barreled in for a 28-14 advantage. Three plays later, Owen Blaschak recovered his second fumble in as many defensive series, again giving possession back to Northern deep in Greencastle territory. Maintaining the role of aggressor, Robison delivered a 30-yard scoring strike to Joey Razzano on the next snap, essentially serving as the knockout blow entering the fourth. A 35-yard field goal by Aidan Alves with 3:05 remaining produced the 38-14 final. “When we returned the kickoff, we were still right in it,” Tinninis said. “Then we had the two turnovers and they scored off both of them, which was pretty much the game.” G-A’s lone offensive touchdown was a 2-yard pass from Spencer Meyers to Brae Peck, which drew the Blue Devils even at 7 in the second quarter. The score was set up by a 50-yard bomb from Meyers to Tyler Jeffreys, moving the ball to the 2 after a penalty was assessed. Page 2 of 2 - Northern established a 7-0 lead on Robison’s first of four touchdown passes, finding Swaisgood for 21 yards to break a scoreless tie. With less than two minutes to play before the half, the Polar Bears marched 82 yards to answer G-A’s aforementioned score, highlighted by a 47-yard rush by Robison. The drive was capped by a 4-yard hookup between Robison and Jake Cromer, resulting in the 14-7 Northern advantage heading to the locker room. Meyers finished 12-of-19 through the air for 130 yards while Demetrius Burton paced G-A’s sputtering rushing attack with 41 yards on 10 carries. As a team, the Blue Devils averaged less than three yards per attempt, exemplifying the tenacity of Northern’s defense. “The sun is going to rise tomorrow and our guys better come ready to work on Monday,” Tinninis said. “We have two big ones left.” G-A will indeed need to shake this one off sooner rather than later as a marquee meeting with rival Waynesboro looms on the horizon next Friday.
