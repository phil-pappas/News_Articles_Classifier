He caught a 22-yard touchdown in the second quarter, ran in a 42-yard score in the fourth and returned an interception 46 yards for six insurance points in the game's final minutes. \nSaintmelus finished with 110 rushing yards on 19 carries and six catches for 89 yards. Quarterback Orcun Selmani completed 10 passes for 89 yards through the air. \nKelly Jordan made five tackles and a sack for the Tiger defense. \nNaples freshman quarterback Javonte West completed seven passes for 73 yards and rushed 12 times for another 51 yards. Teammate Karrington Evans caught four passes for 63 yards. \nThe 3-1 Tigers have been on a tear since their opening-weekend loss to Bitburg. They'll play for postseason positioning next weekend against Vicenza. \nThe winless Wildcats are out of playoff contention, though they might find themselves in a position to spoil things for rival Aviano next weekend.
