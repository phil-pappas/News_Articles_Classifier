El Tri officials fired manager Miguel Herrera days after the team won the CONCACAF Gold Cup this summer.\nPressure is building around U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann after the team failed to reach the final of that tournament and played terribly against Brazil in their last match, losing 4-1.\nU.S. soccer legend Landon Donovan recently suggested Klinsmann should be fired if the Yanks lose the high-profile match.\nThe two teams met in a friendly at the Alamodome in April, where the USNMT won 2-0 in front of more than 60,000 fans.\nkparker@mysa.com\nTwitter: @KoltenParker", "external_links":
