Bagley left Tempe Corona del Sol this fall to join his father, Marvin Jr., who took a position at the program as associate head coach. Bagley's brother Marcus, a 6-5 eighth grader, will also be playing for Hillcrest's national high school team in its first season.\nNick Weaver, director of basketball at Hillcrest, said that Ayton is visiting Hillcrest Sunday and Monday and will likely make his decision on Tuesday.\n\"He likes the idea of playing with Marvin,\" Weaver said.\nAZCENTRAL\nMarvin Bagley III leaving Corona del Sol to join Hillcrest Hoops\nBagley was azcentral sports' Player of the Year as a freshman after helping Corona del Sol capture a fourth consecutive Division I basketball title last season. He averaged 19.6 points, 10.3 rebounds, 2.4 blocks and 2.3 assists.\nAyton, a power forward from the Bahamas, withdrew last week from Balboa City School in San Diego. He is ranked by ESPN, Rivals.com, Scout.com and 247Sports as the No. 1 player in the nation in the 2017 class. His offers include Arizona, Kansas, Kentucky, Maryland and San Diego State.\nBalboa City is similar to Hillcrest, which is not part of the Arizona Interscholastic Association and plays a national schedule. Balboa City plays a national schedule and is not part of the California Interscholastic Federation's San Diego Section. He averaged 21 points, 16 rebounds and 3.8 blocks last season.\nAZCENTRAL\nHillcrest Hoops hopes to learn from Westwind Prep and build a Findlay Prep-like powerhouse\n\"If he joins us, there is no reason why we can't win a national championship,\" Weaver said.\nWeaver said Ayton and Bagley are different players and would complement each other. Weaver compares the style of play of Bagley to that of Lamar Odom, a player who could go inside and outside and handles the ball really well.\n\"Marvin is the best high school basketball player I've seen,\" Weaver said.\nHillcrest is scheduled to play national powerhouse Henderson (Nev.) Findlay Prep four times this season. Hillcrest's home basketball games will be played at Phoenix College.
