Jana Speiker played in goal for the Windjammers, while Kelsey St. Cyr made 13 saves for the Blue Devils. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Heal Point Standings for Class A North, Camden Hills (9-0-1, 86.4286 points) is first in the 14-team region. The top 10 teams qualify for the playoffs. \nMedomak Valley 2, Maranacook 0 \nAt Readfield Oct. 3, the Panthers' six-game losing streak came to a close as they bested the host Black Bears. \nTalia Willis and Abby Nelson creased the net for Medomak Valley, off assists by Maggie Cox and Aubrey Schaeffer. Chelsea Ripley earned the shutout in goal for the visitors. \nCoach Larry Jensen said his team has “been playing well just [getting] unlucky breaks” and “played 80 minutes of soccer” in Saturday's win. \nHe said Sophie Cohen, Hannah Watmough, Emily Wotton and Gabby DePatsy “played very well” defensively against Marancook. \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Heal Point Standings for Class B North, Medomak Valley (2-8, 7.7551 points) is 16th, while Oceanside of Rockland/Thomaston (8-0-1, 73.6735 points) is first in the 18-team region. The top 12 teams qualify for the playoffs. \nBoys soccer \nLewiston 3, Camden Hills 1 \nAt Lewiston Oct. 2, the Windjammers now are in the midst of a rare two-game losing streak as they fell to the unbeaten Blue Devils. Lewiston led 1-0 at halftime. \nNoralddin Othman scored two goals for Lewiston and Abdi Sharriff-Hassan one, while Kienan Brown scored a second-half goal for Camden Hills. \nThe Blue Devils held a 26-8 edge in shots and a 4-1 advantage in corner kicks. Lucas Boetsch made 18 saves in net for Camden Hills, while Austin Wing made two saves in goal for Lewiston. \nThe Windjammers' chances took a shot in the first half when Josh Pitcairn was sent to the hospital after having his head cut open by a Blue Devils player. Camden Hills coach Ryan Hurley said it was due to a Lewiston player participating in the game without a mouth guard and the player's teeth “took a chunk” out of Pitcairn's head. \nHurley said Pitcairn had four staples put in his head to close the cut (staples are used now instead of stitches) following the incident. \n“That was really unfortunate, but the rest of the boys rallied and the substitutes played great,” the coach said. “Lewiston's first goal was a great goal where they capitalized on some early game jitters on our part. Their second goal really should have been a foul and a free kick for us as Lucas came out and made a sliding save and one of the Lewiston forwards kicked him in the face as he was on the ground, [and] the ball popped over to another player who tucked it in. Kienan Brown scored a really nice goal and we had a few more good opportunities off set pieces at the end. It was a really fun game with a playoff-type atmosphere. Hopefully we'll get the opportunity to play them again.\" \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Heal Point Standings for Class A North, Camden Hills (6-2-2, 61.9388 points) is third, while Lewiston (10-0, 92.5510 points) is first in the 14-team region. The top 10 teams qualify for the playoffs. \nCourier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:33:47.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
