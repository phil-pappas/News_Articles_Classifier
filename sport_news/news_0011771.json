Green Bay is trying to improve after a rough offensive week, despite a 24-10 win over the Rams and a 5-0 start. Though the offense is always a threat with Aaron Rodgers at quarterback, Philip Rivers will face a tough Packers secondary that has been thriving this season. 0 TO 100 \nAntonio Gates returned from his four-game suspension Monday night and was able to reach a career milestone only eight other players have ever achieved. Gates became the ninth player in NFL history, and only the second tight end, to reach 100 career receiving touchdowns . Congrats, Antonio! History made. With this catch, @AntonioGates85 joins @TonyGonzalez88 as the only TEs with 100 TD grabs. #MNF http://t.co/sMz5r0d4u4 â€” NFL (@NFL) October 13, 2015 #BIRDGATE \nFor some odd reason, Twitter thought Philip Rivers sucker punched a bird in the middle of the Steelers-Chargers game on Monday night.

KEENAN ALLEN'S $10K SMILE \nKeenan Allen's having a good year, but his mouth is having a better one... GULLS, GULLS, GULLS! \nThe San Diego Gulls opened their inaugural season back in America's finest city, and #SDLive was there to catch opening night . Brie Thiele also was able to catch all of the prep that went into opening night for San Diego's newest team. BUT WHY? \nFor what appears to be no other reason than because he can, Chargers linebacker Brock Hekking ate over 21,000 calories of food from Phil's BBQ in 43-minutes. NOT JUST A MONTH, IT'S A LIFESTYLE \nSteelers running back DeAngelo Williams , who lost his mother, Sandra Hill, to breast cancer last year at age 53, will pay for 53 mammograms at hospitals in various cities to honor her. \nFor more national buzz from around the country, follow @TheBuzzer at FOXSports.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:23:23.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
