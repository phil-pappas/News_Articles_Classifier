It's a trend, Gouge says, across the state.\n\"We just haven't lost any days to weather,\" he said. \"Any day we can work is a good day.\"\nWarm, dry weather in Colorado since August has left the state with economic winners and losers in a year where winter appears reluctant to begin. From farmers to ski areas, everyone relying on Mother Nature is feeling the effects.\nColorado Weather Aurora Weather • Littleton • Englewood • Boulder • Arvada\n» 10-day forecast\n» Colorado Weather News\n\"We've been really dry,\" said Scott Entrekin, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Boulder. \"A lot of high pressure has been deflecting a lot of the storm tracks away from Colorado.\"\nSeptember was the warmest on record in Denver and the seventh-driest.\nWhile the Front Range and high country saw snow and heavy rain Wednesday and Thursday thanks to a weather system that passed through the state, there was another mild dry-out from Friday to Sunday.\nThe next storm system is not forecast until late Monday into Tuesday, but it's not slated to be \"very big,\" Entrekin said.\nFor Colorado farmers, the weather's impact differed depending on the crop. A very wet late spring delayed planting, and while the warm weather has been enthusiastically embraced, the lack of precipitation has posed challenges.\nJerry Johnson, a professor of soil and crop sciences at Colorado State University, said wheat, for example, had to be planted deeper to reach moisture. Other crops like corn and sunflowers, which are irrigated, are looking \"reasonably good,\" he said.\n\"Moisture and heat, that would be perfect,\" said Johnson. \"That's what we had last year and we had real high yield.\"\nBob Winter, who represents Adams, Boulder, Larimer and Weld counties for the Colorado Farm Bureau, said the sugar beet crop this year has been bountiful thanks to the late warmth. \"Now if only we can find a way to get the prices up,\" he said.\nEmily Wilfong, spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Transportation, said the weather has allowed construction crews to catch up.\n\"We had a rainy spring, and that made it difficult to get stuff done,\" Wilfong said. \"Having a nice, dry, late summer/fall has been really helpful in us getting milestones in our important projects complete.\"\nShe pointed to paving work on the Interstate 70 mountain corridor in Clear Creek County as proof. \"We were only able to get those done because we had (high) temperatures and dry conditions in our favor.\"\nSki resorts have been waiting for the cold and snow to arrive . Arapahoe Basin, typically one of the first resorts to open in North America, has not announced a start date and is approaching its latest opening — past Oct. 30 — in the snowmaking era.\nLast year, A-Basin opened on Oct. 17 . This year, ski areas in New England opened before any Colorado slopes.\nJohn Sellers of Loveland Ski Area said Loveland opened last year on Nov. 1 — the latest in 20 years — and despite winter's reluctant beginning, the resort expects \"a really good season.\"\n\"We might be opening a little bit later than we'd like, but we're still going to be offering a really long season, and we're optimistic we're going to get a ton of snow up here,\" he said.", "external_links": ["http://denverpostplus.com/app/weather/www/output/currentconditions-", "http://denverpostplus.com/app/weather/www/output/", "http://denverpost.accuweather.com/hostedpages/widget/v2/denverpostforecast/weather5/denver,co", "https://github.com/andrefarzat/slugify/blob/master/slugify.js", "http://twitter.github.io/typeahead.js/examples/"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T14:05:44.568+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
