By Mark Lelinwalla Posted: 10/05/2015 08:13 AM EDT Filed Under Ndamukong Suh , Buffalo Bills , New York Giants , Sports News , Sports , Odell Beckham Jr. , NFL , Miami Dolphins , Philadelphia Eagles , Washington Redskins , New York Jets \nThe catch part II? Well, sort of. \nOdell Beckham Jr. did the unthinkable again...or so it seemed. During the New York Giants ' 24-10 win over the Buffalo Bills on Sunday, the dynamic second-year wide receiver channeled his miraculous one-handed catch from last season by doing it again. \nHowever, this time, his falling-backward, one-handed grab was made on the sidelines and ruled incomplete. Still, it was probably the most thrilling play of Week 4. You be the judge. \nPretty amazing. Beckham's spectacular play headlined a Week 4 around the league that centered on mind-numbing plays. Here are a few other instances that help support that theme. Washington Pulls Off Miracle Do you believe in miracles? Washington and their fans do. Trailing the Philadelphia Eagles 20-16 late in the fourth quarter, Kirk Cousins — yes, you read right, Kirk Cousins — led the Redskins on a 15-play, 90-yard game-winning drive that ended with a four-yard touchdown completion to Pierre Garcon for Washington's 23-20 win. \n\"That final drive — I wasn't capable of doing that when I came in the league as a rookie. It takes time. It takes failure. It takes learning from experiences,\" Cousins told ESPN . \"A culmination of, I guess it would be, three-plus seasons' worth of work got me to a point where I was able to make the necessary plays on that drive.\" \nCousins still has more career interceptions than touchdowns, though. \nNdamukong Suh is Still a Bully We said that mind-numbing plays were the theme of Week 4...and this is literally a mind-numbing (non-football) play. During the Miami Dolphins - New York Jets game in London on Sunday morning, Dolphins defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh was seen kicking Jets QB Ryan Fitzpatrick in the head. Good lord. While there are debates whether it was intentional or not , Suh has a history of dirty plays throughout his career...especially against quarterbacks. This is the same Suh who stomped on a QB's groin and stepped on another's calf.
