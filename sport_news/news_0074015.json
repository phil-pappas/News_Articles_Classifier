Only through his talent, his hard work and his determination was this possible.\" \nRonaldo also surpassed the 500 mark for career goals for club and country in the game against Malmo. \n\"To me it's an honour to receive this award. I didn't expect it,\" Ronaldo said. \"When I wore Real Madrid's jersey for the first time I never imagined that one day I would become the club's greatest scorer, surpassing my friend Raul and the late [Alfredo] Di Stefano. I'm very happy.\" \nRonaldo needed 308 games to reach his mark, while Raul did it in 741 matches from 1994 to 2010. \nRonaldo is also the all-time scoring leader in the Champions League with 82 goals, five more than the injured Lionel Messi. \nSeveral of Ronaldo's teammates were present for the ceremony at the stadium, as well as Madrid coach Rafa Benitez and the player's mother and young son. The 30-year-old Ronaldo posed for photos with all of them after the ceremony. \n\"First of all, I need to thank my teammates,\" he said. \"Because without their support and their commitment, this achievement would never be possible.\" \nRonaldo caught the eye of talent scouts while playing for Sporting Lisbon in the early 2000s, earning a transfer to Manchester United as a teenager. The Portuguese forward moved to Real Madrid after nearly six seasons in the Premier League. \n\"His name already is a legend in Real Madrid,\" Perez said. \"I hope the legend will keep on going.\" \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
