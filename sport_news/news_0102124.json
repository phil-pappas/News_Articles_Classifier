That would tie Steffi Graf for most in the Open era. \n“This is a very difficult decision, but one ultimately made because of the love of the game,” Williams said. “I plan to return to practicing and participating in exhibition matches later this year. And when I do, l will focus and focus and focus so I can continue my journey in this beautiful game.” \nWilliams has already secured the year-end No. 1 ranking for the third straight year and fifth season overall. \nWilliams won the last three WTA Finals, which features the world’s top eight players. She has won the tournament a total of five times. \n“Serena’s health has to be her No. 1 priority,” WTA president Micky Lawler said in a statement Thursday. “The risk of injury is a reality in the world of elite athletic performance. We will miss seeing Serena on court in both Beijing and Singapore and wish her a speedy recovery.” \nEarlier this week, No. 3-ranked Maria Sharapova pulled out of the China Open because of a left forearm injury. She said she still hopes to play at the WTA Finals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:44:18.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
