Not surprisingly, the All-Pro tight end thinks its \"cool\" to find himself lined up in the left slot on one play or wide right on another and, yes, even in the traditional in-line spot befitting his position. \"I just enjoy playing the game of football,\" Gronkowski said Thursday. \"No matter where the coaches run me is fine and it's actually fun just going around learning new positions -- going out wide, lining up at the tight end position, lining up in the slot. Whatever the coaches ask I'm willing to do and I enjoy doing it all.\" Now in his sixth season, Gronkowski laughed and said one has to be \"super smart\" to have that kind of deployment versatility. He also admitted he wouldn't have been able to do it as a rookie due to his lack of experience and limited command of the playbook. Not every tight end has the speed, skill and smarts to be able to line up in the slot or wide, but Gronkowski does. And one of the advantages for him is that it makes it easier to get a free release. And we've all seen what happens when Gronkowski doesn't get chipped, bumped or blocked off the line. \"There's no D-end in front of you, no linebacker lined up in front of you when you're lined up out wide,\" Gronkowski said. \"You're definitely more likely to get chipped if you're lined up at the tight end position. If you're lined up out wide you might get jammed by the DB or whoever is covering you, but definitely [it's advantageous to be outside].\" Good luck to any defensive back who tries to jam the 6-foot-6, 265-pound Gronkowski, who has 16 receptions for 308 yards and four touchdowns through three games. Gronkowski ranks first among tight ends in yards and yards per catch (19.3), is tied for first in touchdowns and receptions of 20-plus yards (7), and is tied for eighth in receptions despite playing one fewer game than his contemporaries in the top 10.
