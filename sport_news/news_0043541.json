Besides the rest, it was a chance to reset goals and home in on areas for improvement. \n“Definitely,” wide receiver Kenny Britt said. “Everybody’s focusing and getting back to what we have to do, and to our details so we can go out there and start fast.” \nThere’s good reason for optimism, too. Though they’re 2-3, the Rams are very much alive in the muddled NFC West, with Arizona the lone team above .500, and both the Cardinals and Seattle coming off losses. \nThe latter made it an enjoyable weekend for coach Jeff Fisher, plus Seattle and San Francisco played on Thursday night. \n“We got some help,” Fisher said. \nThe schedule seems to provide a breather, too. After going 1-2 in three consecutive games against teams with winning records, the Rams have just three opponents currently with winning records the rest of the way. \nThey know they’ve got to make some of their own breaks, too, starting this week with Cleveland (2-4). \nSt. Louis has had a pair of impressive outings, beating the Seahawks in overtime in the opener and handing Arizona its first loss, doing it on the road. Following form in Fisher’s four seasons, the momentum didn’t last and St. Louis lost the following week both times. \nIn their fourth season under Fisher, the Rams have one three-game winning streak - back in 2012. \n“Our challenge is how do we take this thing one week at a time, how do we ignore all the outside stuff about schedules?” middle linebacker James Laurinaitis said. “As a team we can’t think, ‘Thank goodness we’re past the tough part of it.’” \nThe Browns have some catching up to do after facing just two teams with winning records in the first six. However, they had the unbeaten Broncos on the ropes last week before losing in overtime. \n“We’re 2-4 and we own that,” coach Mike Pettine said. “There is some confidence because we know that we’re close. That’s what makes it all the more frustrating.” \nThings to watch for in Browns-Rams: \nDEAD LAST: The Browns spent the offseason addressing the league’s worst rushing defense. It hasn’t improved. In fact, it’s gotten worse. They remain No. 32 against the run, giving up 149.8 yards per game - up from 141.6 last season. \nThe defense has been plagued by schematic breakdowns and poor tackling, allowing opponents to break off long runs and chunk yardage. Rookie Danny Shelton was brought in to help fix the problem, but the No. 12 overall pick hasn’t performed up to expectations. He said adjusting to the pro game has been a major challenge.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:58:51.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
