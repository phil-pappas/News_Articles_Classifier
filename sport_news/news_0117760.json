They are Ramapo’s Emma Johnson (38.4 season high), Amanda Katz (36.55) and Kara Giacose (36.075), Ridgewood’s Katherine Muccio (36.775) and Victoria Purritano (36.3) and Northern Highlands’ Leah Gneco (37.15). \nIn addition, Ramapo’s Samantha Marion and Ridgewood’s Mika Tamura both scored at least 36 at last year’s North 1 meet and have yet to do so this season, meaning the potential exists for Bergen County to send more than five all-around competitors to the state championships. \nThe last time more than five girls advanced out of North 1 was in 2011, when seven tallied the 36 minimum – six were from Bergen County and one was from Passaic County. \nTRACKING TEAM SCORES: Sectional competitions take the top six teams from each area, plus any other schools with three or more all-around qualifiers. \nAt the moment, the teams in the driver’s seat for the North 1 meet are Ramapo (111.125 season high), Ridgewood (109.85), Pascack Regional (106.7), Holy Angels (105.15), Randolph (102.4) and Wayne Valley (101.3). Montclair sits seventh at 99.6, and Wayne Hills is right behind at 98.65. With Alyssa Blake and Nicole Sanzari on the verge of qualifying as all-arounds, the Patriots would need one more gymnast to do so in order to gain entry as a team. The sectional cutoff for individuals and teams is Oct. 27, which leaves county and league tournaments in play for girls to obtain qualifying scores. \nPASSAIC PERFORMANCES: Next Tuesday’s Passaic County championships kick off the major-meet portion of the season. March-in is scheduled for 5 p.m. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:22:33.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
