But Brassard took just one shot on net and Zuccarello had no attempts, and he and Nash were on the ice as Artemi Panarin was left wide open to tie the game at 1 at 14:24 of the first period.\nZuccarello even admitted to the Norwegian media after the game that line had been the worst for the Rangers.\n\"My expectations for that line are so high,\" Vigneault said. \"I think I've got three elite players. But you've got to come to play hard every night. If you ask them, they might say they're slow starters. I say, try harder. If you compete harder, you'll be quick starters.\"\nObviously, much is expected of the line, kept together from last season, when Nash set a career high with 42 goals in the regular season. Even if retired future Hall of Famer Marty St. Louis struggled toward the end of the season and in the postseason, he did provide 21 goals and 31 assists.\n\"For sure, we've got to be better,\" Nash said. \"There was a lot of rust out there. We were pretty good in the preseason but [Wednesday] night wasn't good enough.\n\"I don't know exactly what it was,\" added Nash, who also had two shot attempts blocked and three more miss the net. \"It seemed like we couldn't make a lot of the plays around the blue line. Hopefully, the next game will be a little different.\"\nBRIEFS: Henrik Lundqvist will start tonight's game after making 32 saves against the Blackhawks. The plan is for him to also start Saturday, unlike last season when then-backup Cam Talbot started the second game at Columbus in an identical three-games-in-four-nights scenario with the first two on the road. \"It was such a long break between the last preseason game and [Wednesday] night, I want to get going,\" Lundqvist said. \"I want to get into a nice rhythm and then you can relax and get a good feeling.\" … Vigneault said he anticipated no lineup changes so forwards Emerson Etem and Tanner Glass and defenseman Dylan McIlrath will remain the healthy scratches.\nEmail: grossa@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:15:01.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
