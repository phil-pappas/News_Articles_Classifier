What they had in common was their dominance in the Central State Eight Conference boys and girls cross country meets Saturday at Lincoln Park. Freshman Katherine Petty led Rochester High School to the CS8 girls team title with her first-place finish, beating out Springfield High senior Aly Goff. In the boys race, SHS’ Heath Warren didn’t let up in the final conference race of his stellar career, winning his second straight CS8 title by nearly a minute over Glenwood’s Landon Skelly. Springfield High got its first five runners in the top 11 as the Senators won the boys team championship for a ninth-straight season. Room to spare When Petty came to the homestretch, it was clear there was no drama for the individual title. She won in 17 minutes 34 seconds, beating Goff by 39 seconds. “I felt like I would (have a good race) because there was a lot of good competition, so I knew no matter how I finished, I’d do well because they would be pushing me,” Petty said. Petty, who also plays volleyball for the freshman and sophomore teams at Rochester, doesn’t get much cross country practice time with her team. She does much of her work individually before school. Rochester’s second CS8 title was especially redeeming for Meagan McNicholas. “I came on (WFMB 1450 AM) earlier this season . . . and I was like, ‘Yeah, we should win the conference’ and then I (immediately regretted saying that),” McNicholas said. “I felt like an idiot all season. But I’m glad because we are where we wanted to be.” McNicholas placed eighth at 18:58, behind teammates Madeline Campbell (sixth) and Ellie Tjelmeland (seventh). Rochester beat Chatham Glenwood for the team title 34-50. Springfield High was third with 60 points. Goff, who finished in 18:13, beat her goal by two seconds. And that’s despite the beginnings of leg cramps over the final 800 meters. “I didn’t completely cramp up but I started to — so that slowed me down a little bit,” Goff said. Upbeat and downcast Only two schools have won the CS8 Boys Meet in the conference’s 23-year history: Glenwood (12 times) and Springfield (11), including SHS’ 29-54 win over Glenwood on Saturday. The Titans thought they could take back the title that has eluded them since 2006. “We are going to be displeased with this one,” Skelly said. “This was one we came in thinking we should’ve had — easy.” Page 2 of 2 - Warren, who ran a 15:22 on his 18th birthday, knew Glenwood had its eye on the conference banner. “We come here to run for place and our team just ran smart races today; we ran the smartest on the course,” Warren said. “It’s just happy to see us seniors not know what it’s like to lose a conference title and keep the streak continue for nine years.” Warren beat Skelly by 10 seconds and was quick to point to his teammates’ efforts in securing the win. “I just do what’s expected of me; it’s the rest of the team that steps up,” Warren said. SHS’ Logan Besalke took third, J.D Kropid came in sixth, Jackson Esela was eighth and Chris Moore captured 11th. — Contact Ryan Mahan: ryan.mahan @sj-r.com, 788-1546, twitter.com/RyanMahanSJR .
