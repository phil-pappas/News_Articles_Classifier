I’m going through a really exciting phase of my career, of my life. I can only be happy,” said the father of two sets of twins. \n\nJoining Federer in the field is double Grand Slam champion and fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka (seeded second) and third seed Rafael Nadal, whose run to the Beijing final and Shanghai semis has helped the 29-year-old start repairing a poor season in the closing stages. \n\nWawrinka, winner of the Tokyo title this month, opens against Croatian serving king Ivo Karlovic while Nadal kicks off the week’s evening sessions when he faces Lukas Rosol on Monday. \n\nRosol famously stunned Nadal in the Wimbledon second round in 2012. \n\nNadal lost in the Basel quarter-finals a year ago before revealing his need for an off-season appendectomy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T21:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:24:04.753+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
