The leadership is stronger. The practices have more energy. Communication is better. Players are tougher. \nIn short, the Raccoons grew up. \n\"We do have better leadership this year, but it also goes on us a little more....,\" said Wolf, a defensive lineman. \"It was that we didn't put in as much work as juniors and sophomores. The senior and junior class has done a lot of work to get better.\" \nThe results have been remarkable. Oconomowoc, 1-8 last season, enters the playoffs with a 9-0 record and a No. 1 seed in its portion of the Division 1 bracket. It is the biggest jump for an area team this season. \nAt 7 p.m. Friday the Raccoons play host to Madison East (4-5) in a first-round game. \n\"A complete night-and-day difference from last year to this year,\" McMillen said of the team's continuity. \"Nothing against our seniors (last year) , there just weren't that many of them. We had only eight total by the end of the year. Only a few of them were on the field consistently, so we were playing varsity football with a bunch of sophomore and juniors.\" \nThe past three seasons have been quite the roller-coaster ride for this program located in western Waukesha County. Two years ago Oconomowoc also finished the regular season undefeated and then won two playoff games. \nThat team had a dynamic quarterback running the show in Canton Larson, who is at UW-Whitewater. The 2015 squad has a pretty good signal caller, too. \nBen Nienhuis, a 6-foot, 175-pound junior, opened the season with 265 yards passing and five touchdowns in a 37-20 victory over Kettle Moraine and has been on top of his game all season. He has completed at least 60% of his passes in seven games and raised his season completion from 47.6% last season to 61.4% this year. \nHis 2,358 yards and 30 touchdown passes lead the area and rank third and second in the state, respectively. \n\"His accuracy and confidence (have improved),\" said Samson, the team's second-leading receiver (33 catches for 499 yards) behind junior Zach Clayton, who has 59 grabs for 900 yards and 14 touchdowns. \"He's not scared to let the ball fly any more. He put in so much work in the off-season.\" \nThe passing game accounts for 66% of the team's yards, but the running game is averaging 5.5 yards per carry and is coming off its best showing of the season. Challenged to run the ball by Watertown last week, Oconomowoc used junior Jake Rams 26 times and he responded with season highs of 205 yards and four touchdowns. \nThe unit averaged 2.8 yards per attempt last season. A large portion of the credit for the team's improvement in that facet of the game can attributed to the line of senior tackles Nick Jerred and DJ AhSam, senior center Derick Klinger and junior guards Peter Alexander and Jake Ploch. \n\"Our offensive line definitely got a lot better than last year,\" Samson said. \"I believe it's the same five guys and all of them improved three times from what they were last year. We're able to do what we want to now.\" \nDefensively Wolf and senior defensive lineman Max Roth rank 1-2 in tackles. Wolf has a team-high 16 tackles for a loss followed by senior linebacker Ashton McNamee, who has 10. \nTogether they've help produce an impressive turnaround although a closer look shows that Oconomowoc wasn't your typical 1-8 team last season. In addition to youth and injuries, the team had three tough losses to Kettle Moraine (14-7), West Bend East (15-14) and Watertown (17-14). Give or take a play, those losses could've ended up as victories. \nThis year Oconomowoc is getting the last laugh. The program made a major statement this season with its ability to bounce back from tough times and be a consistent winner. The Raccoons can boast of two league titles the past three seasons with essentially two different groups of kids. \nIt is the program's best run since winning Wisconsin Little Ten titles in 2001 and '02. \n\"Obviously it tells all the kids to follow the program like this class did and (the 2013 team) did and you're going to be just fine,\" said McMillen, who is in his seventh season. \"You've got to believe and commit to it.\" © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
