It will be the first ABC national television broadcast in Rutgers football history .\n\"Saturday night will be the best atmosphere in all of college football,\" Rutgers coach Kyle Flood said Tuesday on the weekly Big Ten teleconference.\n\"Anybody who has ever been to a primetime night game at High Point Solutions Stadium will tell you that. The country got a little glimpse of that a couple weeks ago when we played Michigan State, and I think it will be amped up even a little bit higher this week with the No. 1 team in the country coming to town.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:08:36.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
