If approved, the measure would also enact a 0.5 percent sales tax increase to pay back that debt as well as fund continued maintenance and recreation programming in town.\nAccording to officials, the measure is the simplest, quickest way for residents to support and hasten growth of parks and open space in Parker.\n\"Of the top amenities that businesses and residents list when asked why they live or operate in Parker, recreation is always one of the top three or four items listed,\" said Parker Mayor Mike Waid .\nHe said the Town Council regularly hears requests from residents for more recreational opportunities and amenities, and rather than act unilaterally to impose taxes to pay for those desires, the council is leaving that decision to voters.\nAdvertisement \"Rightfully, that is something that should fall into the hands of the citizens, not the council,\" he said. \"Whether you support recreation or not, your voice should be heard this November.\"\nParker already has a 0.5 percent sales tax dedicated to parks, recreation and open space. If passed, the ballot measure would increase the revenue dedicated to parks and open space from 0.5 cents on every dollar spent in Parker to a penny on every dollar.\nWaid said the effort to put the measure on the ballot got started last year when residents weighed in on a master planning process for expansion of the existing 160-acre Salisbury Equestrian Park and Sports Complex , located off of Motsenbocker Road north of Hess Road.\nThe town owns an adjacent 90-acre parcel, and an estimated 1,100 people weighed in on a master planning process for development of that land, known as Salisbury Park North , according to Jim Cleveland, the town's parks, recreation and open space director. Popular ideas included a network of soft-surface trails, children's adventure play area, tennis and pickleball courts and a man-made sledding hill, Cleveland said. He acknowledged a significant chunk of the money raised through the bond sale would go to that project but it also will be spent on other things like catching up with the demand for additional sports fields. He said the sales tax bump could sustain the local parks, recreation and open space system going forward.\n\"We really feel that that ($39.9 million) number and that sales tax increase amount would provide us with the necessary funding not only to build new projects but assure we can maintain the projects that we build,\" he said.\nOther targets the town has identified for funding include expansion of H2O'Brien Pool and acquisition and development of more open space.\nParker recently completed a $16 million expansion and update of the Parker Recreation Center , a project that was funded in part by issuing debt.\nPeople gathered at the Salisbury Parks sports fields recently were largely supportive of the measure.\n\"I have no problem with that. I think (parks and open space) are a great resource,\" said Mark Huckaby, who spends many evenings at local recreation facilities for his son and daughter's athletics activities. \"The more parks and open space we have, the higher our property values will be and the better our lives are going to be, honestly.\"\nAmy and Joe Roepke and their 6-year-old son Wyatt recently moved to Parker from California. The Roepkes both support the recreation tax.\n\"We just moved here three months ago, and we love that they have great parks and good trails and are putting money into the infrastructure,\" Amy Roepke said. \"I'd say the tax rate is low enough it can support a small increase.\"\nJoe Rubino: 303-954-2953 or jrubino@denverpost.com", "external_links": ["http://www.parkerrec.com/1815/Salisbury-Park-North-Expansion", "http://www.parkeronline.org/1787/Sales-and-Use-Tax-Rates", "http://www.parkeronline.org/directory.aspx?EID=10", "http://www.parkeronline.org/924/2015-Ballot-Question-Election", "http://www.parkeronline.org/", "http://www.parkerrec.com/256/Salisbury-Equestrian-Park-Sports-Complex", "http://parkerrec.com/234/H2OBrien-Pool"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:45:33.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
