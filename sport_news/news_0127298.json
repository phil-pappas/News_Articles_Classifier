Kevin Garnett , Robert Parish, Kevin Willis, and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar have all done it. Once the 2015-16 regular season begins and Kobe Bryant steps on the court, he'll be the fifth one to do it. Recently, Dwight Howard stated he wanted to play 10 or 11 more seasons, which would make him the longest tenured NBA player of all time . Everybody wants to play forever now.\nYou can add San Antonio Spurs ' point guard Tony Parker to the 20-season club hopefuls. He told Marc Spears of Yahoo Sports that he wants to make it to 20 seasons in the NBA with the Spurs and that after his current deal expires, he wants one more contract for three seasons. By then, he could certainly add Tim Duncan as a 20-season player, assuming this isn't the final season for Duncan.\n\nTony Parker has watched old rivals Allen Iverson, Steve Nash, Chauncey Billups and Jason Kidd end their playing careers in recent years. Parker, however, isn't eying his own retirement party anytime soon. If everything goes right for him, the longtime San Antonio Spurs point guard won't quit until after his 20th NBA season.\n\"The Spurs know I want to play until I'm 38,\" Parker told Yahoo Sports in a recent phone interview. \"That will be 20 seasons for me. That's my goal. This year is No. 15. And if I'm lucky enough and I'm healthy, hopefully I can play 20 seasons and then I'll be ready to retire.\"\nParker, 33, made $12.5 million in the final year of his last contract last season. This season will be the first year of the 14-year NBA veteran's new contract paying him a total of $43.3 million over the next three seasons. Parker said he has told Spurs coach Gregg Popovich and general manager R.C. Buford he wants a career-ending three-year contract in San Antonio after his new deal expires.\n\nThis could be a little rough for Parker. A decline seems to be expected for him, especially after he didn't look particularly great during the FIBA basketball games for France this summer. He averaged a career low in minutes (28.7), lowest points (14.4) since his rookie season (9.2), and lowest assists (4.9) since his rookie season (4.3). When the playoffs came around, he really struggled through being banged up and trying to go against Chris Paul . He shot just 36.3 percent from the field in their seven games against the Clippers.\nIt's easy to see why he'd want to keep playing too. Obviously, people love milestones and round numbers so playing 20 years in the NBA sounds like a big deal. Also, don't forget the new TV money coming in is going to make salaries jump starting next summer, so there's a nice financial plus for him sticking around another six years in the league. Parker is making roughly $43 million over the next three seasons. After that, Parker staying relatively healthy and effective could be lucrative for him. We may find him earning somewhere in the $6-8 million per season range, just because teams have to spend the money to get to the salary floor with a much higher cap.\nParker is second all-time in games played for the Spurs with 1,008. He trails Duncan by 323 games. He trails David Robinson for second in Spurs' minutes played by 1,633 minutes. He's currently fourth in San Antonio history in points scored -- 3,763 behind Robinson and 6,575 behind George Gervin. He could end up as the second most accomplished player in Spurs history behind Duncan. Tony Parker wants to make it 20 years with the Spurs.
