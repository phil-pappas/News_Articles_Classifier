(AP) - University of Central Arkansas trustees are set to consider adding women's beach volleyball as a sport. \nThe Log Cabin Democrat ( http://bit.ly/1VHKQi7 ) reports the board of trustees will vote on whether to offer the sport beginning with the 2016-17 school year at a Friday morning meeting. \nThe board's meeting agenda says the school's athletic department studied the feasibility of adding beach volleyball, and that it's among the fastest growing NCAA sports. \nTrustees would also consider a contract to build three beach volleyball courts for roughly $320,000. The courts would also be used for intramural sports. \n___ \nInformation from: Log Cabin Democrat, http://www.thecabin.net \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
