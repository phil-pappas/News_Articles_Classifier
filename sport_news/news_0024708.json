Haffey/Getty Images MLB: Utley breaks Tejada's leg \nChase Utley of the Los Angeles Dodgers hits a single in the seventh inning against the New York Mets at Dodger Stadium. Next MLB: Utley breaks Tejada's leg \nMajor League Baseball will review the slide by Los Angeles Dodgers second baseman Chase Utley on Saturday night during Game 2 of the National League Division Series that resulted in New York Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada suffering a broken right leg. Rafael Nadal avenges U.S. Open defeat \nMLB chief baseball officer Joe Torre will investigate the slide to determine whether disciplinary action will be taken against Utley, who slid into second base in an attempt to break up a double play in the seventh inning of the Dodgers' 5-2 victory. \n\"I'd hate to think that Utley tried to hurt somebody,\" Torre said. \"It certainly was late. That concerns me. The lateness of the slide ... I'm looking at it to see if anything should be done.\" \nTorre attended the game in Dodgers Stadium. \n\"I have to determine if I thought it was excessive,\" he said. \"Not that you shouldn't slide hard, but as I said, just the late slide is probably the only thing that is in question right now.\" \nSecond base umpire Chris Guccione ruled the slide to be legal. \n\"That's a judgment call,\" Torre said. \"I'm still watching replays of it. They get a chance, one shot to look at it. ... I can't fault the umpire for everything he had to look at.\" \nThe Mets were none too happy about the play and losing their starting shortstop. Manager Terry Collins said Wilmer Flores will replace Tejada for the remainder of the postseason. \n\"That's not a slide. That's a tackle,\" Mets left fielder Michael Cuddyer said. \nMets second baseman Kelly Johnson said, \"We're losing our starting shortstop now for the rest of the playoffs. He's got a broken fibula. It cost us potentially this game. And we don't have anything to show for it.\" \nUtley didn't classify the slide as malicious. \n\"The tying run's on third base, I'm going hard to try to break up the double play,\" Utley said. \"I feel terrible that he was injured. I had no intent of hurting him whatsoever.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T15:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:13:06.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
