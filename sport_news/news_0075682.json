Cole Schneider notched two goals and an assist along with Matt Puempel chipping in one goal and two helpers while Chris Driedger stopped 26 of 27 shots faced to lead the B-Sens to victory. \nPuempel opened the scoring 6:51 into the first period after Schneider picked up a loose puck at the red line following a sloppy defensive change by the Marlies. Skating into the Marlies zone 2-on-0, Schneider sent a cross-ice feed to Puempel who one-timed it into the back of the net. With less than two minutes to play in the first period, David Dziurzynski made it 2-0 Binghamton with his second strike of the season. Dziurzynski sent a wrist shot from the top of the right faceoff circle that surprised Toronto’s Garret Sparks and snuck between his legs. Binghamton took the 2-0 lead into the first intermission break with a 13-9 advantage in shots on goal. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nEric O’Dell continued his hot start to the season when he notched his team-leading fifth goal with a one-timer off a feed from Tobias Lindberg. \nToronto managed to cut the B-Sens lead to 3-1 just less than five minutes into the third when Josh Leivo’s slap shot from the blue line managed to sneak behind Driedger for his second goal of the season. Schneider returned the B-Sens three-goal advantage less than one minute later when he skated in on a breakaway before beating Sparks for his second goal of the year. Schneider’s second of the night came with less than five minutes to play in regulation off a great cross-ice feed from Puempel to move the final score to 5-1. \nSparks finished with 31 saves on 36 shots faced while Driedger earned his third win of the year in as many starts in net for Binghamton. \n(Courtesy: Binghamton Senators)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:01:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:04:09.899+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
