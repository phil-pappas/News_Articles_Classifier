The Blue Jays even said they were playing the game under protest. \nToronto rallied in the 53-minute seventh for a 6-3 victory to advance to the Championship Series, but not before having to recoup after crazy top half of the inning. \n\"It was just a shame that might have been the difference in a game of this magnitude,\" Blue Jays manager John Gibbons said. \"Thank God it didn't come down to that.\" \nWith Rougned Odor at third base and two outs in the top of the seventh, Martin's throw back to the mound appeared to hit the hand of batter Shin-Soo Choo, allowing Odor to sprint home as the ball rolled up the third base line for a 3-2 lead. \n\"I understand the fans are upset,\" Choo said. \"I understand their reaction.\" \nHome plate umpire Dale Scott initially ruled it a dead ball but, after Rangers manager Jeff Banister came out, the umpires huddled and Odor was sent home. \nScott acknowledged making a mistake with his initial ruling. \n\"I was mixing up two rules,\" Scott told a pool reporter. \"I called time but then it started clicking. I went, 'Wait a minute, wait a minute, there's no intent on the hitter.' If there's no intent, if he's not out of the box, that throw is live.\" \nScott said the play itself is not reviewable, explaining that the umpires were reviewing the rule, not the play, when they went to the video. \nAccording to rule Major League Baseball rule 6.03(a)(3), the batter is not to be charged with interfering with the catcher if the batter is still in the batter's box and doesn't make a movement to block or disrupt the throw. \nThis type of play is not subject to manager's review but Scott, the crew chief, after discussing the ruling with Gibbons, called an umpire's review. After a delay of 2 minutes, 32 seconds, the play stood and fans continued to throw objects on the field. \n\"I was walking off the field and a tall boy (beer) came right by me,\" Gibbons said. \"I didn't know if they were (upset) the at the situation or just me personally. Probably both.\" \nToronto Mayor John Tory tweeted, \"Don't hurt each other or our city over this. We can prove ourselves in more ways than one. #ComeTogether\" \nThings devolved further in the bottom half as the Rangers made three errors to load the bases with none out. \nTexas then requested a review on next play, when Ben Revere grounded into a force at home. Dalton Pompey slid hard into catch Chris Gimemez, who was standing on home plate. Umpires upheld the ruling. \nBut after Sam Dyson replaced Cole Hamels, Josh Donaldson drove in a run on a forceout and Jose Bautista hit a long homer to put Toronto up 6-3. \nWhen on-deck batter Edwin Encarcion turned to the crowd and gestured for them to stop throwing objects on field, Dyson misunderstood Encarnacion's actions and the players had words, causing the benches to clear. \nTwenty police officers lined the outfield and many more were stationed down the lines during the delay. \nBenches cleared a second time after Troy Tulowitzki popped out foul to end the inning. \nThe Toronto Police Service also posted a tweet during the melee. \"The actions you take will not affect the outcome of the game, only effect the perception of #Toronto,\" it read. \"Keep classy Toronto.\" \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:21:25.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
