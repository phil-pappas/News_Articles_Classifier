They beat Kean 29-15 a week ago in Frostburg, and will be looking to improve their road record to 3-0 this afternoon. \nWilliam Paterson fell to 1-3 overall and 0-3 in the conference with a 64-7 drubbing at the hands of Montclair State. \nFrostburg and Paterson have one common opponent thus far in Kean. While FSU beat Kean last week, Paterson lost at Kean two weeks ago 27-24. \n“We’ve had a great week of preparation,’’ said Fitzgerald. “Our players have been focused all week and we’ve run around and executed during practice. When that happens your expectation is that we’ll be focused, play hard, and execute on Saturday. \n“Saturday is William Paterson’s Homecoming, so the atmosphere should be great for both teams. It’s the next game on our schedule, so \nit’s the most important game on our schedule.” \nA week ago, Austin Bonsall returned his second punt for a touchdown covering 67 yards, to help FSU defeat previously unbeaten Kean. Percy Haskins returned a kickoff 74 yards to set up a touchdown run by Jordan Brown, Josh Washington’s blocked punt deep in Kean territory led to a touchdown run by Connor Cox, and Rowan Pinkett returned an interception 34 yards for a touchdown to cap the day. \nPinkett also had 13 tackles and a sack. William Sewell and Lyle Fugate had 12 tackles. \nThrough five games, senior Roland Kamara leads the conference and is second nationally among Division III players with three blocked kicks. Bonsall leads the conference and the country with two punt returns for touchdowns, and leads the conference and is second in the nation in punt returns, averaging 19.1 yards per return. \nFrostburg State leads the all-time series with Paterson, 2-1. The most recent game was a 46-16 FSU win in 1991. \nWith your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:05:54.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
