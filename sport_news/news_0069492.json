It may be best to watch that game on TV.\nSo, what follows is an attempt to pick out the best road trips for fans to follow during the Blazers' 2015-16 season . Basketball is a winter sports and no one at the office in Portland would begrudge you a quick outing to see some action in, say, Los Angeles, Phoenix or Miami, when it's raining buckets at home.\nHere are the top five road trips of the Trail Blazers' 2015-16 season for a die hard fan to join:\nNo. 1: At Golden State, either Friday, March 11, or Sunday, April 3. The Warriors are the defending champions and, other than Sacramento, their arena in Oakland, Calif., is the closest to Portland and thus the easiest to reach. Take in that April game and you can add on a Tuesday, April 5, game as Sacramento for a NoCal doubleheader.\nNo. 2: At Phoenix, Friday, Dec. 11. The Blazers also play in the Valley of the Sun on Oct. 31, but Oregonians are hardly sick of winter that soon. The December game against the Suns has its own option of a doubleheader, with the Arizona Cardinals hosting the Minnesota Vikings the night before in a National Football League game at Glendale. And, unlike so many other years before, these Cardinals are really good.\nNo. 3: At Miami, Sunday, Dec. 20. What a perfect way to get ready for Christmas: experience some Florida Heat and come home with a sun tan. Also, you can add a game at Orland against the Magic on Dec. 18 and, if your airplane flies home from Atlanta, take in a game there, too, on Dec. 21. The Hawks had the best regular season record in the Eastern Conference last year. The Blazers continue on the trip to play at New Orleans, Wednesday, Dec. 23, but you may want to save that city for a better day.\nNo. 4: At New Orleans, Friday, March 18. Get a jump on spring break by going on the road that entire week, first at the Oklahoma City Thunder on March 14, then at the San Antonio Spurs on March 17 and, after your Saturday night off in New Orleans, wrap it up on Sunday, March 20, with a game at the Dallas Mavericks. Somebody will be playing for San Antonio this season who you may remember.\nNo. 5: At Utah, Thursday, Dec. 31. This is a skier's special, a game at the Utah Jazz followed by another at the Denver Nuggets three days later, on Sunday, Jan. 3. With a little creativity, you could ski the days in between at, say, Park City, Utah, and Vail, Colo. If snow doesn't light you with excitement, opt for a quick trip to Los Angeles. The Blazers play at the Clippers on Monday, Nov. 30, and on Thursday, March 24. If your road trip plans must include a weekend in L.A., you'll need to watch the Blazers play at the Lakers on Sunday, Nov. 22.\nGet your tickets now while they are still available through NBA team websites, or buy them on a resale website such as stubhub.com .\nThe Trail Blazers are in a rebuilding mode this season, so their games on the road are not likely to be the hottest tickets in the opposing markets. If you want to get into the arena, tickets will be available, except maybe at Golden State where those fans will pay to watch their Warriors play tiddlywinks.\n-- Terry Richard\ntrichard@oregonian.com\n503-221-8222; @trichardpdx", "external_links": ["http://www.nba.com/blazers/schedule", "http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9116349.js"], "published": "2015-10-25T13:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:13:45.297+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
