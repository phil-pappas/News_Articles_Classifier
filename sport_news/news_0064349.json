On the spectrum of sports in this area, today's Celtic practice was a mere warmup act for tonight's Patriots-Colts matchup.\n Brad Stevens, a Colts fan from growing up in Indiana and working in the same city -- who has come to appreciate and pull for the Pats -- was asked about the lighter blue sneakers he was wearing and said they had no connection to football allegiances.\n \"I’ve said it before that I know people in both organizations,\" the Celtics' coach said. \"I don’t know as many in the Colts' as I used to, because after they made their change in general managers and coaches and everything else, in the 2011 or whatever it is season, and a lot of their players, those were a lot of the people that I knew pretty well. But I know a couple of their coaches still, and I know a couple of the Patriots coaches.\n \"And one of the things that I’ve kind of found since being in it and being in sports is you just tend to appreciate what good organizations do. They share a lot of similarities -- more so than probably people want to talk about. But I think that at the end of the day, there’s a lot of good people in those organizations and there’s a lot of hard workers in those organizations.\"\n It's interesting to note again that Stevens has a son named Brady who was born during his time at Butler.\n \"What a wild twist,\" said Stevens. \"When my Brady first went to daycare [in Indiana], there were Peytons in his class. And we had named him because we liked the name from a kid that I was actually recruiting. I didn’t even think about it. But now he fits right in. As I’ve said many times, we’ve got kids on our street, dogs on our streets -- we got a lot of Bradys.\" ...\n David Lee missed practice with the illness that's been going around the team, but Marcus Smart was back after being pulled off the trip to New York with strep throat.\n The latter will get some extra work this week as the Celts host the Nets tomorrow and Knicks Thursday in the Garden before finishing with a game against the 76ers in Manchester, NH, Friday.\n \"I’ve got a pretty good idea about what we need to do, where we need to go, what we need to see,\" Stevens said. \"I feel good about where a lot of our guys are at, as far as conditioning level and even experience level through the first four games. We'll still sit some guys this week. They’ll play enough. I think that it’s really important that guys like Terry [Rozier], who sat out all last week [with a sore knee], guys like Marcus, who sat out all last week, play a lot just to get themselves going again. And a lot's relative; I don’t see anybody going over 24-28 minutes.\"\n Said Rozier, \"I feel real good. It’s just great to be back out there. You want to pace yourself. I’m just now coming back, so I want to be cautious with stuff, but I feel good, so I’m just ready to get out there for a full practice with the older guys. I'm just ready to get back to it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:24:04.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
