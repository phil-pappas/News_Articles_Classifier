And also what comes along with chemotherapy is the weight gain. That was difficult for me,” Reed said.\nReed joined the Chiefs defensive backs, the University of Kansas Hospital and the American Cancer Society Tuesday for the third annual luncheon at Arrowhead Stadium to learn beauty techniques specifically designed for cancer patients.\nEven tough guys like Chiefs safety Eric Berry struggle with the physical side effects that come with treatment.  \n“The biggest thing that really changed my appearance was not having eyebrows...It was something simple, but you just look in mirror and try to figure out what's going on,” he said.\nAbout eight months after being diagnosed with lymphoma, Berry was cleared medically to practice with the Chiefs. He proves that perseverance with treatment can pay off.\n“At end of day, you have to understand that you are still the same person regardless of how you look or feel,” he said.\nReed had her last chemo treatment two days before her son’s second birthday.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
