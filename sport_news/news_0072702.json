Staff photo by Kelly J. Huff slideshow Reinhardt will play the biggest game of its football program’s young history when the No. 8 Eagles host top-ranked Lindsey Wilson on Saturday at Ken White Field.Not only is it Reinhardt’s first top-10 matchup and a game that features two of the four final undefeated teams left in the NAIA, but it is also homecoming for the Eagles (7-0, 2-0 in Mid-South West).“I think it’s great. We should have a great crowd, and it’s homecoming,” Reinhardt coach Drew Cronic said. “I know, a lot of the time, you schedule someone for homecoming that you have a good chance to beat, but I like this. I like the fact that we’re playing the best team in the country. There’s a lot happening, and it’s very exciting, so I don’t think we’ll have to motivate our guys a whole lot this week. They’ll be excited about playing.”While the atmosphere around the game will be bigger than usual, Cronic said it is important to treat it the same as any other. He wants his players to look at it as just another divisional game that the Eagles need to win to continue their pursuit of greater things.“With everything that’s going on, it’s a perfect storm, so there should be a lot of excitement,” he said. “There are two sides to that, though. You’re very excited because it’s a big game, but it’s still just another game, too. We have to keep working every day to get better. They’re a really good football team, and it’s going to be a great challenge for us.”This will be Reinhardt’s third meeting with Lindsey Wilson (6-0, 1-0), and if this Saturday is anything like the first two, it should be exciting. In 2013, the Eagles battled back from a 44-17 deficit before coming up just short in a 50-45 loss. Last season, they trailed 20-0 before rallying for a 52-48 win.Cronic said those games, along with Reinhardt’s propensity to come back, has given him the confidence to feel that his team is never out of any game.“We were down 20-0 to them last year, and we came back and won the game,” he said. “We need to start fast, but I still always think we can score in bunches, so we’re never out of it. If we get behind, we get behind. We have to keep playing.”If Reinhardt does fall behind again, it will need to keep the deficit small, because it will be facing one of the stingiest defenses in the nation. Lindsey Wilson is giving up only 15.2 points per game, and it has not allowed a team to score 20 points.Reinhardt is scoring at a 54.3-point-per-game clip.“We’re going to be who we are, but you always tweak a thing or two,” Cronic said. “They’re really good on defense. They’re very opportunistic and create a lot of turnovers. They’re really big up front, too, with a lot of size on their defensive line. They’re a veteran group, and they’re well-coached. It’s going to be a challenge. They only give up 15 points per game, and we certainly need to score more points than that.”Reinhardt may also be facing the best offense it’s seen all year. Though Lindsey Wilson does not score at the same rate as the Eagles do, it runs a balanced offense that gives defenses several looks to deal with.“I think they probably have the best offensive line we’ve seen all year,” Cronic said. “We have to challenge our guys to get after them. We have to put pressure on the quarterback, and we have to tackle well. They don’t have a lot of different schemes, but they run a lot of different formations. You have to understand where to fit with all the smoke-and-mirrors stuff that they’re doing. Defensively, it’s going to be a big challenge for us this week.”With both teams playing well, the margin of victory could be small. For that reason, Cronic said Saturday’s game will come down to which team makes fewer mistakes.“The bottom line is we can’t turn the ball over, and we have to create turnovers,” he said. “To me, those are the keys to the game. We have to protect the football and force them into some turnovers. That’s what it’ll come down to, and I think the team that wins the turnover battle will have the best chance of winning the game.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:06:07.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
