I'd heard of his high character and standing within the St. Aug community. What I did not know, though, was how driven he was to use his status to elevate those around him.\nShortly after arriving on St. Aug's campus I met with Fournette and members of the Purple Knights' coaching staff. After a brief discussion, Fournette asked if I could designate time for him to introduce some of his teammates to help them garner interest from college coaches. I obliged, and we strolled our way across campus, stopping for just about everyone we passed along the way that sought an opportunity to greet the phenom. Fournette's stardom was evident. He was a transcendent figure as perhaps the most promising athlete to ever grace the football fields in New Orleans.\nAfter a 10-minute walk, we finally made our way to the school's weight room, where 30 or so of Fournette's teammates awaited, drenched in sweat from working out. Shortly after walking in, Fournette turned to me and said, \"You have a pen and paper, right?\"\nOne by one, Fournette called his teammates over and introduced them as I took notes. Aside from my usual questions, Fournette often interjected to opine on a player's character, ability and potential. No fewer than 12 players went through his assembly line.\nFournette was a joy to cover in high school. He provided quality interviews that rivaled his abilities on the field, but it was his humility and willingness to help influence others around him that made him special. The national media is just getting a sense of his humility, particularly after he offered to donate proceeds from his auctioned jersey to help flood victims in South Carolina after LSU defeated the Gamecocks a few weeks ago.\nAfter a 45-minute session of me interviewing many of St. Aug's players, only then was Fournette prepared to talk about himself. He left quite an impression.\nDespite all of the success, fan admiration, and national recognition he has received from analyst, he is till the same young man I met with that day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:41:10.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
