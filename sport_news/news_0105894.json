The image shows him comforting an injured child after a car accident. Just take a moment to look at this photo, capturing a human connection that goes beyond words.\nA 10-year-old boy, frightened and banged-up after a car accident, and an officer following instinct that goes much deeper than his uniform.\nOfficer Lt. Joe Tucker calls it “the instinct of a father, the instinct of a man, and the instinct of a human being.”\nThursday morning, Alana Beard and her four children were on the road to school when they were involved in a crash with another car on Detroit’s west side.\n“That was my first time ever in an accident,” Alana Beard said.\nTucker was in his personal car, off duty, when he drove by the accident scene. The 22-year veteran of the Detroit Police Department saw Johntez Byrd alone on the ground, and this special moment was born.\n“Neighbors were tending to the other children, and the young man was still sort of alone,” Turner said of Johntez. “So he was crying and nervous, so I laid down next to him.”\nJohntez was grateful.\n“He said, ‘You OK?’ and, ‘Do you want to watch a motorcycle video?’ and I said yes,” Johntez said of Tucker.\nEMS took the family to the hospital.\nBut Johntez’s mother, Alana Beard, was so moved by what Lt. Tucker did, she later found him on Facebook.\n“Because I wanted to thank him, and I wanted to let him know that we really appreciated it,” she said.\nTucker was moved by the gesture.\n“I thought about it,” he said. “It’s touching.”\nIt was an accident that brought two strangers together for just a moment, but perhaps left a lifetime of impact.\nWhat would Johntez Byrd say to Lt. Tucker?\n“Thanks for helping me to the ground,” he said. “Thanks for letting me play on his iPhone.”\nCopyright 2015 WDIV via CNN.
