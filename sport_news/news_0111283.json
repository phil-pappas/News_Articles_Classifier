Two of the three teams stay undefeated while one lost their first game of the season. In Division 4, the Lakewood Vikings lost to Fowlerville on the road, 24-21. They tried for a late comeback, but fell short. Up until last week, the Vikings were on pace for their first undefeated season since 1974. Last week, they were tied for second with Grand Rapids Catholic Central. This week, they've dropped five spots to 7th place in the AP poll with 22 points. Lakewood will host Ionia this week. In Division 5, the Portland Raiders stayed undefeated with a 59-19 rout of Olivet on the road last week. The Raiders are looking for their first undefeated regular season since 1969. They still stayed at second place, behind first place Menominee, who had five first place votes and all 50 points. Portland has 44 points. They'll face Marshall at home this week. In Division 7, the Pewamo-Westphalia Pirates won the CMAC title with a 34-7 win over Fowler at home in the final regular season home game of the season. The Pirates stayed in fourth in the AP poll with 33 points. Traverse City St. Francis stayed in first place with all five first place votes and 50 points. The Pirates travel to Grandville Calvin Christian this week.
