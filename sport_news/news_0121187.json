With the score 28-21 in favor of the Wildcats, Calaveras wide receiver Trevor Ramirez caught a 61-yard pass from quarterback Dylan Byrd with just seconds left, making the score 28-27. Unfortunately for Calaveras, that was the final score as Sonora’s Kane Rogers intercepted Byrd's two-point conversion attempt. Calaveras (3-3, 1-1 MLL) led early 7-0 as Shane Torre caught a 1-yard pass from Byrd. But the Wildcats (5-1, 2-0) tied the game when Bradley Canepa scored from one yard out. Anthony Giangregorio gave Calaveras a 14-7 lead on his 6-yard run with 2:44 to go in the first half. The Wildcats went ahead 21-14 with two touchdowns in the third quarter — a 5-yard run by Wyatt Faughnan, and Sam Page’s pass to Ian Cicero. Torre and Byrd hooked up for their second TD pass of the night at the start of the fourth quarter for a 21-21 tie, but Page scored on a 7-yard run to give Sonora its final score of the game and the go-ahead TD. Amador 21, Linden 0 At Sutter Creek, Ben Griffin tossed a 54-yard touchdown pass to Arik Williams and also scored on a one-yard run as the Thundering Herd (3-2, 1-1 Mother Lode League) defeated the Lions (1-4, 0-1). Robby Hahn also scored on a two-yard run for Amador. Chavez 53, Vallejo 7 At Chavez, the Titans rolled as senior quarterback Keith Dosier went 12 of 15 passing with 256 yards and three touchdowns. Senior running back Terrance Ritzow posted 12 carries for 85 yards and three touchdowns. Senior Nick Rosiles had two catches for 62 yards, and returned a fumble 72 yards for a touchdown on defense. Chavez (2-3) plays at Bear Creek (0-5) to begin San Joaquin Athletic Association play at 7:15 p.m. next Friday at Podesto Field. St. Mary’s 38, Buhach Colony 3 At St. Mary’s, the Rams (3-2) responded from last week’s heartbreaking loss in Los Gatos with a pounding of the Thunder (2-3) to finish their nonleague slate at Sanguinetti Field. “The difference was the way we came out. We wanted to come out strong and start fast. We felt like teams had been getting the best of us to start games the past several weeks,” St. Mary’s coach Tony Franks said. “It kind of put us on our heels and put us in a hole.\" Franks, too, was pleased with the defensive improvements. “We played excellent defense. We forced some turnovers. We capitalized offensively,” he said. St. Mary’s hosts West (4-1) to open Tri-City Athletic League play at 7:15 p.m. next Friday.
