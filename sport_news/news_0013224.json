I look forward to working with my backroom staff and the players to improve on the previous campaign and look forward to the World Cup qualifiers with optimism.\" \nScotland are in a potentially fascinating qualifying group for Russia 2018 which includes their old rivals England, plus Slovakia, Slovenia, Lithuania and Malta. \nAnd Strachan will again be assisted by newly-appointed Motherwell boss Mark McGhee and former Rangers manager Stuart McCall. \nAn SFA statement read: \"The Scottish FA is delighted that Gordon has agreed to remain in charge after the unwavering support demonstrated by the Scotland fans throughout the European qualifying campaign.\" \nAnd SFA Chief Executive Stewart Regan said: \"The Board of the Scottish FA has been consistent in our belief that Gordon should continue the good work that has been apparent in many performances and results throughout the previous campaign. \n\"Similarly, the supporters and the players have been overwhelming in their view that Gordon is the national coach to lead us into the World Cup qualifying campaign. \n\"The mutual respect and stability that exists is essential to our future success and we all look forward to planning for Russia 2018.\" \nScotland will be looking to reach their first major tournament finals since they successfully qualified for the 1998 World Cup.
