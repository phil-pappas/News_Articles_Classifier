For us, it's about proving we can play with the best team in the country.\" \nLast season, the Colts faced the Hilltops in the PFC final and came out on the wrong end of a 27-7 score. \nThe ponies were, maybe, happy enough just be in the championship game, but that thought has turned on a dime. \n\"You're either there to compete or you're OK with taking second place,\" Blokker said. \"This year, we're not just happy being there.\" \nThe Colts are 1-1 against the Hilltops this season. \nThey lost the season-opener 31-10 at McMahon Stadium, but handed the Hilltops their only loss of the regular campaign in a 34-4 triumph to close out the regular season in Saskatoon. \nWhile the Hilltops did sit some important guys when the score got out of hand, Blokker wants people to know the game didn't begin that way. \n\"I know everyone is saying, 'the Hilltops rested their players,' \" Blokker said. \"They started all their best players and they played until the second quarter when we started beating on them a bit. Then they pulled them.\" \nThe Colts have also found a cache of gold after starting running back Xavier Ramsay went down with a neck injury in Week 6. Backup Dylan Minshull went in and has carried the mail like a true postal superstar the rest of the way. \nIn his last two games alone, Minshull has rushed for 223 yards and has found the endzone four times. In last week's 17-3 win over the Regina Thunder in the PFC semifinal, Minshull rumbled for 128 yards and scored a touchdown. \n\"Minshull runs downhill, he drags guys after tackles, he turns three-yard runs into five-yard runs and he turns seven-yard runs into first downs,\" Blokker said of Minshull's north-and-south style of punishment. \nFor the Colts, no fear is the name of the game, and it should be that way if they hope to gallop to the top of the hill Sunday afternoon. \n\"They're a great football team and we understand that,\" Blokker said. \"We're going to play physical and go at them. If you're afraid of them, you might as well put 14 points on the board before the game starts.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:49:13.331+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
