Marie in its first game of the season, the Cheboygan varsity boys soccer team earned a hard-fought 2-2 draw during a wet contest in Cheboygan on Thursday. The Chiefs (7-10-1) took a 1-0 lead before halftime on a made penalty kick from junior forward Derek Vieau. After the Blue Devils equalized in the second half, senior Tobias Akselsen delivered a nice 30-yard shot and score to help the Chiefs retake the lead. However, the Blue Devils would equalize again with 13 minutes left in the contest. In the end, it proved to be a 2-2 tie. “It was a very physical, contested game,” said Cheboygan soccer coach Gregg Spence, whose came into the contest following an impressive penalty shootout win over Northern Michigan Christian Academy on Tuesday. “The weather definitely interrupted the game flow, but our guys played strong and never gave up.” Cheboygan will play on the road on Tuesday against an opponent to be announced.
