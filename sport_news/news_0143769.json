Broyld led the Orange in receiving in 2013 before a lower-body injury kept him out of eight games last year. He was set to join Ervin Philips and Ben Lewis as the team's primary hybrids.\nBroyld came to Syracuse from Milford Academy as a quarterback. The Rochester native was named the 2010 New York State Class AA Player of the Year after leading Rush-Henrietta to the state championship and a 13-0 record.\nHe's caught three passes for 25 yards in four games played at West Georgia.\nWilliams, a senior, also split ways with the program this offseason.\nHe came to SU after two years at ASA College in Brooklyn and dealt with work ethic and weight issues during his brief stint with the Orange. Williams recorded nine tackles and a fumble recovery in five games played last season.\nHe has six tackles and a quarterback hit in two games played for West Georgia.\nContact Stephen Bailey anytime: Email | Twitter", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/stephen_bailey1"], "published": "2015-10-08T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:28:01.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
