(AP) - Sportscaster and TV host Erin Andrews is seeking a $75 million judgment against the Marriott hotel chain and a man who admitted making secret nude tapes of her in 2008. \nThe lawsuit filed in Nashville in 2010 was amended this week to include the dollar amount the former ESPN reporter is suing for on the basis of negligence and invasion of privacy. \nMichael David Barrett, of Westmont, Illinois, in 2009 pleaded guilty in federal court in Los Angeles to renting hotel rooms next to Andrews in three cities, altering the peepholes and shooting videos in two locations in Columbus, Ohio, and in Nashville. \nThe lawsuit alleges the Nashville hotel agreed to Barret’s request to book a room next to where Andrews was staying. \nMarriott did not return a message seeking comment. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:32:53.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
