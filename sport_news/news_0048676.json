Jimbo don’t lie. \n“I feel like everybody is grasping that concept of what he’s saying and just buying in.” FSU RB Dalvin Cook's hamstring getting 'stronger and stronger' \nThe No. 9 Seminoles are undefeated, ranked in the Top 10 and yet to commit an offensive turnover six games into the 2015 season. Fisher has amusingly made a point to knock on any kind of wooden fixture when the last fact is brought up by media during his press conferences. \nFor a team that lost four starting offensive linemen, two starting cornerbacks and defensive linemen, and its best receiver, tight end and quarterback in school history to the NFL after last season, many questioned how long it would take Fisher and his coaching staff to bring along his new crop of players. Florida State cornerback Marquez White speaks with media after practice on Monday, Oct. 19, 2015. Safid Deen/Democrat \nSecuring Top 5 recruiting classes year after year, and playing those young and talented players early surely helps. \nThe Seminoles (6-0, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) are right where they want to be this season, tied with No. 6 Clemson (6-0, 3-0) for the lead in the ACC’s Atlantic Division. Both teams will meet in Death Valley on Nov. 7. FSU's Kermit Whitfield transforming into reliable receiver for Seminoles \nBut first, FSU has its eyes on getting past a Georgia Tech (2-5, 0-4) team that has lost five consecutive games and underwhelmed after pushing the Seminoles during the ACC title game last season. \n“This will be a very challenging game, as it always is,” Fisher said. “And we have to get better this week and accept the challenge.” \nGeorgia Tech has lost its fair share of talent from last season’s team including three running backs who accounted for more than 2,200 yards and four starting offensive linemen last season. \nThe Yellow Jackets started 2015 with a 2-0 record, but have lost to Notre Dame, Duke, North Carolina, Clemson and Pittsburgh. Those teams combine to have a 27-4 record this season. FSU's Golson, Whitfield, Pugh earn weekly honors after Louisville game \n\"A lot of people have struggled with the teams we just played,” GT coach Paul Johnson said on Monday. “And the next one coming in is 6-0. … Are we playing as well as we'd like to? No. I'm not saying that's an excuse. We want to win the games. I'm just saying it is what it is.” \nJohnson said “a bounce here or there” could have resulted in more favorable outcomes for his team. \nThe same can be said for FSU, which has won 35 of 36 games — including 29 in a row. The first and last victories for the Seminoles during that stretch came against GT in the ACC Championship game in 2012 and 2014. \nThe Seminoles have initiated a number of players — like White, quarterback Everett Golson, receiver Kermit Whitfield, defensive tackle Nile Lawrence-Stample and linebacker Ro’Derrick Hoskins — into their first prominent roles on the team this season. FSU's Trey Marshall has torn biceps tendon \nFisher said simplifying “so many factors that go into success and failures” like how to practice and properly prepare has been a challenge, but the players are realizing the rewards. \nPutting away Georgia Tech would be another step in FSU’s forward progression. The Seminoles simply have to turn the corner themselves. \n“We’re talented everywhere at each position,” White said. “As a younger person, you don’t really believe everything that you hear from the coaches. \n“I guess we’re starting to see it,” he added. “I guess we’re starting to see it.” Florida State defensive tackle Nile Lawrence-Stample speaks with media after practice on Monday, Oct. 19, 2015.
