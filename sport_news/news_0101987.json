Holder Brad Kragthorpe took the snap and fired a long, overhand lateral to Domingue, who bobbled the ball before running it in.\nLeonard Fournette rushed for 180 yards on a career-high 31 carries and scored touchdowns on runs of 2 and 6 yards. Brandon Harris threw scoring passes of 9 and 50 yards to Malachi Dupre.\nLSU led by 14 points at halftime but Florida came back with two touchdowns as the LSU offense sputtered. A 30-yard pass from Treon Harris to Deondre Goolsby set up a 2-yard scoring run by Kelvin Taylor.\nAfter an exchange of punts, Antonio Calloway returned a Jamie Keehn punt 72 yards for a touchdown to tie the game with 1:04 left in the third quarter.\nLSU then responded with a 75-yard touchdown drive capped by Domingue's run on the fake field goal play.\nLSU overcame some boo-boos in the first half to take a 28-14 lead.\nThe Tigers had their best offensive first half of the season, exploding for 28 points and 304 yards as Brandon Harris completed 10 of 12 for 189 yards and two touchdowns and Leonard Fournette ran for 100 yards and two scores on 15 carries.\nMalachi Dupre had four catches for 115 yards and both scoring passes, 9 yards and 50 yards.\nThe game didn't start well for LSU. Tre'Davious White muffed a bouncing punt he shouldn't have tried to handle after an LSU defensive stop on Florida's first series. The Gators got the ball at LSU's 13-yard line and took a 7-0 lead four plays later when Treon Harris threw a 4-yard TD pass to Jake McGee. LSU had not allowed a first-quarter touchdown this season before that play.\nThe Tigers struck back with touchdowns on their next three possessions to go up 21-7. Leonard Fournette capped an 88-yard drive with a 2-yard run, taking a direct snap from center and skirting right end. Harris hit big completion to Travin Dural for 15 yards on third-and-9 to keep the drive alive.\nFournette helped set up the next LSU score with a 25-yard run. Harris again connected twice on third down, the capper a 9-yard fade pattern to Dupre in the right corner of the end zone.\nHarris and Dupre hooked up for a 52-yard play on which Harris handed to Fournette, who lateraled back to Harris for the pass. Fournette stormed through the middle on the next play from 6 yards out.\nFlorida answered that score when Treon Harris found Antonio Calloway for 48 yards to the LSU 19. On the next play, a busted coverage led to a 19-yard scoring pass from Treon Harris to McGee all alone down the left sideline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:18:20.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
