Dexter Fowler and Kyle Schwarber assist Jake Arrieta in leading the Cubs to a tense 4-0 win over the Pirates \nThey celebrated like wild fraternity brothers Wednesday night. \n\"We have a special group,\" rookie Kyle Schwarber said after supporting Jake Arrieta's latest mastery with a two-run homer and three RBIs. \"We have great personalities and great leadership top to bottom.\" \nFrom the strategy of manager Joe Maddon to Arrieta's 11-strikeout, four-hit shutout to offense Dexter Fowler and Schwarber provided, the Cubs celebrated in a raucous manner after quieting the Pirates 4-0 in the National League wild-card game. \n\"We're going to celebrate,\" President Theo Epstein responded after being asked about facing the rival Cardinals in the best-of-five division series starting Friday in St. Louis. \"We'll deal with the Cardinals on Thursday. It's a special rivalry. We've never played them in the postseason. It's going to be incredible.\" \nFor now, nothing tops the amazing ascent of the Cubs and Arrieta, a 22-game winner during the regular season who extended his scoreless streak to 31 innings. He hasn't allowed a run since the eighth inning of a Sept. 16 game against the Pirates.

(Armando Sanchez / Chicago Tribune) \n\"They're accountable to the moment,\" Maddon said of his rookies. \nBryant's play came after a series of tense moments. Arrieta hit Josh Harrison with a pitch in the sixth and Addison Russell committed an error to load the bases. But Arrieta induced Starling Marte to ground into the inning-ending double play. \nIn the seventh, reliever Tony Watson hit Arrieta with a pitch. Arrieta knew he was going to get hit after nailing two Pirates hitters, but he exchanged words before the benches and bullpens formed a scrum near home plate. \nSean Rodriguez, who was lifted for a pinch hitter in the third, was one of the first Pirates players to leave the dugout and was ejected. \n\"Sometimes those things happen,\" Arrieta said. \"I have a tremendous amount of respect for those guys.\" \nArrieta had a quick reply when a reporter suggested his stuff wasn't as crisp as in recent starts. \n\"I'm not sure what game you're watching.\" said Arrieta, who had every intention of throwing a complete game and finished with 113 pitches. \n\"I didn't want to see anyone in the bullpen. I wanted to finish what I started and be the guy to get the last out. That's the mindset.\" \nEpstein was thrilled. \n\"Unbelievable,\" he said. \"A 4-0 lead is misleading. There's a lot of drama in that game, a lot of tension, a lot of emotions. Jake had to find a second gear after all that drama.\" \nAnd fantasy has become a reality for rookies like Schwarber, who admitted he was nervous Tuesday while watching the American League wild-card game. \n\"Crazy to think,\" said Schwarber, 23, the Cubs' first pick in the 2014 draft. \"But it's crunch time, and we're ready for it.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:05:47.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
