Will both Baylor and TCU be ranked in the committee's all-important top four just like they are in the AP and coaches polls?\nAhh, these are glorious times for the Big 12 Conference with the Bears and Frogs steamrolling along until that inevitable showdown in Fort Worth. In Year Two, life is good. There can't possibly be a repeat of last when the Big 12 was the sole member of the Power Five conferences left to serve as spectators for the first college playoff at the FBS level.\nOr can there?\nThings look awfully good until you start digging down into the numbers and recognize that each conference has the potential to produce a worthy final four candidate. There were four undefeated teams in the AP Top 25 at this time last season.\nThere are 14 today.\nWhoever though Utah could pose a problem?\nCertainly the play of Baylor and TCU has been remarkable as their Nov. 27 date continues to grow in magnitude. No one has come within 20 points of the Bears yet this season. Maybe that will change when they face the two teams from Oklahoma leading up to the TCU game, but I'm not sure they will be that much more challenging for the Bears.\nTCU has played closer games, beating Kansas State by seven and needing a near miracle catch on fourth down to defeat Texas Tech. That's why we find Baylor ranked No. 2 in the AP poll and TCU No. 4.\nNo other conference has two teams in the top six. That's good news...for now.\nIf we assume the Frogs and Bears both beat OU and OSU in the next month, what happens to the only other ranked teams from the Big 12? What will serve as the impressive wins for these two teams?\nThat's going to be a problem.\nNow let's look at their competition.\nWe all know the Buckeyes haven't played at anything approaching last year's level, but they remain unbeaten and No. 1 in both polls. If Ohio State wins the Big Ten championship, the Buckeyes are getting an invite. Plain and simple, that's going to happen. Can Ohio State lose at home to Michigan State? It's possible. But I think Big 12 fans may have to become big Jim Harbaugh fans when Michigan hosts the Buckeyes at the end of the season.\nThe SEC isn't likely to provide an unbeaten candidate. The only way that happens is, if on his way to New York to collect the Heisman Trophy, LSU running back Leonard Fournette runs through Nick Saban's defense in Tuscaloosa for about 200 yards on Nov. 7. If that doesn't happen, then a one-loss Alabama team with a stockpile of wins over ranked teams is getting a bid. Count on it.\nI thought Jameis Winston's departure to the NFL would drop the ACC to second-tier status. That hasn't been the case, at least not totally. Unbeaten Florida State is ranked ninth. Unbeaten Clemson is ranked sixth. Expect the winner of their Nov. 7 battle to continue to climb if it stays undefeated. The Big 12 gets an important break in that the winner will play a less impressive team (probably Pitt or Duke) in the ACC championship.\nAnd out west, yes, the Utah Utes are doing all the damage. Who knew?\nOregon, which if you recall was actually favored to beat Ohio State here in the first championship game last January, has been kicked to the curb. The same goes for Southern Cal. You'd think that might knock the Pac-12 from consideration.\nInstead, undefeated Utah ranks No. 3 and wouldn't play a potential trouble spot -- one-loss Stanford ranked 10th -- until the conference championship game.\nAnd what if Stanford won that game? How would the committee look at a 12-1 Cardinal team that, after an opening loss at Northwestern, owned 12 straight wins over undefeated Utah, Oregon, Notre Dame, Cal, USC and UCLA?\nLet's say Baylor beats TCU and goes undefeated. Would that bring that soft Bears non-conference schedule back into play? I think the Bears get the benefit of the doubt because of the size of their victories. It won't help Stanford that it played a winless Central Florida team.\nBut undefeated Utah, undefeated Ohio State, undefeated Clemson (with a non-conference win over Notre Dame) and undefeated LSU....how would Baylor or TCU like to face that competition on judgment day?\nThis season looks good for the Big 12. But that party invitation is no done deal yet.\nTwitter: @TimCowlishaw.\nComplete Baylor coverage\nCLICK HERE TO VISIT THE BAYLOR BEARS PAGE\nFive thoughts from No. 2 Baylor's 62-38 win over West Virginia\nCarlton: With 16 TDs, Corey Coleman hopes to make Baylor record 'unbreakable'\nBaylor quotable: Bears wanted to prove to West Virginia they are a quality football program\nBaylor uses a rushing Seth Russell to take down Mountaineers\nBaylor loses defensive tackle Andrew Billings with left ankle injury\nTrevor Clemons-Valdez's move at Baylor pays off with TD against West Virginia\nPhotos: Bruiser goes crowd surfing, Baylor talks trash in win over West Virginia\nTalk Baylor football with Chuck Carlton in a live chat at 2 p.m. Thursday\nComplete TCU coverage\nCLICK HERE TO VISIT THE TCU HORNED FROGS PAGE\nFive thoughts: Guided by stellar Boykin, TCU avoids late-game drama at Iowa State\nTCU quotable: Team's first-quarter defense may be 'worst' in college football\nPhotos: Josh Doctson, Trevone Boykin steer TCU through Iowa State to stay unbeaten\nTalk TCU football with Chuck Carlton in a live chat at 2 p.m. Thursday\nOn Twitter:\n @TimCowlishaw", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/17/five-thoughts-2-baylors-62-38-win-west-virginia", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegephotos/2015/10/17/photos-josh-doctson-trevone-boykin-steer-tcu-iowa-state-stay-unbeaten", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/17/tcu-quotable-teams-first-quarter-defense-may-worst-college-football-turpin-expected-back", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/baylorbears/2015/10/17/photos-bruiser-goes-crowd-surfing-baylor-talks-trash-win-west-virginia", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/tcu-horned-frogs", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/17/baylor-uses-rushing-seth-russell-take-mountaineers", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/17/five-thoughts-guided-stellar-boykin-tcu-avoids-late-game-drama-iowa-state", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/baylor-bears", "https://twitter.com/TimCowlishaw", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/chats/2015/10/17/chuck-carlton-answers-big-12-questions-2-pm-thursday-oct-22-ask-now", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/17/baylor-quotable-bears-wanted-prove-west-virginia-quality-football-program", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/17/baylor-loses-defensive-tackle-andrew-billings-left-ankle-injury", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/17/carlton-corey-coleman-breaks-mentors-baylor-record-come", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/17/trevor-clemons-valdezs-move-baylor-pays-td-west-virginia"], "published": "2015-10-19T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:07:45.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
