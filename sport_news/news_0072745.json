Here's a nightmare for Jets fans: Tom Brady lacing up against them for another decade. That, apparently, is what Brady wants.\n\"I'd like to play a long time,\" Brady said Wednesday. \"Yeah, a long time. There's a lot that goes into playing well. I've played with a lot of great teammates. But I want to play for a long time. Maybe 10 more years.\"\nIt's a natural to wonder about Brady's longevity because while he may be 38, he's still playing at an elite level.\nSo was he serious about the 10 more years?\n\"Well, it's not always up to me,\" Brady said. \"That's what my goals are. That's...what I'm hoping. It will take a lot to achieve that, and obviously a team has to want you... I love playing this sport. I love making the commitment to my teammates and my coaches. And hopefully I can do it for a long time.\"\nThis isn't the first time Brady has mentioned that he intends on playing for a very long time. Brady told Kurt Warner in 2011 he wanted to play for 10 more years. He said he had another 7 or 8 years left in an email that became public thanks to the NFLPA's DeflateGate lawsuit. However, earlier this year he said playing 10 more years might be a \"bit of a reach.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:14:54.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
