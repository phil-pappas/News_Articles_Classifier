He gashed UMass for near 100 yards and two touchdowns last season. 0: Sacks allowed by the Toledo offensive line \nDespite losing all five of its 2014 starters to graduation, Toledo's offensive line has been one of the best in the MAC. Again. \n[ LISTEN: UMass Podcast: Toledo preview with the Toledo Blade's Nick Piotrowicz ] 32-13: Matt Campbell's coaching record at Toledo \nThe 35-year-old's name has been popping up left and right as the next MAC coach to strike it out in the Power Five. With a record like that, it's easy to understand why. 40: Red-zone conversion rate for Toledo opponents \nThe Rockets are first in the MAC when it comes to keep opposing offenses off the board after driving into the red zone. In 15 opportunities, they've allowed just two touchdowns and four field goals. 4: Touchdown passes for Phillip Ely last week \nThe senior and former Alabama quarterback hasn't been asked to carry the Rockets this season, but he's coming off his best performance of the year last week against Eastern Michigan: 18 of 27 for 327 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:58:41.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
