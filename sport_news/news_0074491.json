David Zalubowski/Associated Press Right wing Jarome Iginla, left, and the Colorado Avalanche were held scoreless by Carolina Hurricanes goalie Cam Ward in a 1-0 overtime loss Wednesday. D ENVER – Victor Rask scored 1:49 into overtime, and the struggling Carolina Hurricanes beat the Colorado Avalanche 1-0 on Wednesday night. Cam Ward stopped 26 shots in his first shutout of the season and 23rd of his career. Ryan Murphy had the lone assist for Carolina, which won for just the second time in six games. The Hurricanes ended a 10-game losing streak in Denver. It was the first 3-on-3 overtime game for both teams. Colorado’s second group in the extra period got caught on the ice, leading to the goal. Murphy fed Rask in the slot, and Rask took the puck to the front of the net and beat Semyon Varlamov with a backhander. It was Rask’s second of the season. Varlamov finished with 18 saves. Jarome Iginla almost ended it early in overtime when he went alone into the Carolina zone. Ward made a save on the breakaway.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:52:17.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
