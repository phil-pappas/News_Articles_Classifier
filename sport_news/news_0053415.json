The Nazis had accused Jews of carrying typhus.\nPoland had long been reluctant to take in migrants but finally agreed to accept about 5,000 of the 120,000 people to be shared out between the 28-member EU, up from an initial 2,000.\nMore than 630,000 people fleeing war and misery in the Middle East and Africa have landed on Europe's shores this year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:25:11.550+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
