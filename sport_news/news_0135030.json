In the days following the crash, authorities released a detailed description of the gold Honda that hit Harding.\nA police spokesman also could not provide further insight Sunday into why the charges filed against Temple included felony vehicular homicide — despite previous assertions that Harding was crossing the road illegally. Under Georgia law, a defendant is guilty of first-degree vehicular homicide when he or she “causes an accident” that kills someone and flees the scene.\n“Both share some responsibility in the outcome of this incident,” Gwinnett police spokeswoman Cpl. Michele Pihera said earlier in the week. “But the driver of the vehicle has an obligation to stay and render aid no matter the fault.”\nAccording to information released Wednesday, Harding was walking against a “don’t walk” sign Tuesday night while attempting to cross South Norcross Tucker Road near Graves Road. At the same time, the Honda now believed driven by Temple passed through a yellow light and struck her.\nHarding died, and the vehicle drove off.\nIn addition to vehicular homicide, Temple is charged with hit-and-run, also a felony.
