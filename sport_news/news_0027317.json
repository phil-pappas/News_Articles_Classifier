Hough defense is a strong one but will they have enough against quarterback James Smith and company. This was a close one last year, with the Mavericks getting the 37-30 win. Both teams remain undefeated in conference play. Freedom vs Watauga Game Preview: Freedom heads into their second road game in as many weeks. Behind running back BJ Emmons, the Patriots have been averaging nearly 50 points a game recently but now go up against a Watauga team that comes in with only one loss as well. Freedom got the home win last year; now Watauga hopes to seek revenge, as both teams were near the top of the Northwestern conference last year. Cape Fear vs Seventy-First Game Preview: This really should be a great game to watch. Seventy-First, who uses their run game to control the clock and game, will be led by running back Paul Underwood who is posting 190 ypg on the ground. But don't forget do it all Justice Galloway-Velazquez for Cape Fear, who can run and throw (averaging 245 ypg). Both of these teams were near the top in the 4A Mid-South Athletic conference, with Seventy -First getting the 21-11 win last season which helped them get their conference title. Southeast Guilford vs Page Game Preview: Southeast Guilford has been under the radar, as they haven't put up the most impressive numbers. But they can change that with a win against a very good and dangerous Page team that has a ton of elite prospects to watch out for. If Southeast wins, they will certainly make make a strong case for themselves. But they will have to have a strong defensive effort in this one.
