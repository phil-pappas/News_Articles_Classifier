Otherwise it is a cooler day than yesterday, with temperatures in the 50s to low 60s. Winds are less than 15 miles per hour in most locations. \nTonight skies will be clear again with light winds. We will chill out with lows in the upper 20s in the north to the low 30s (around freezing) in the rest of the area. \nTomorrow there will be a crisp morning for the incoming pheasant hunters, but the weather should be cooperative. With a sunny sky our temperatures will top out in the low 60s (near-normal). Winds should be manageable, from the southeast at 10-15 miles per hour – possibly a touch stronger in south central SD. \nSunday will be mostly sunny but breezy. Southerly winds will blow at 15-20 miles per hour, but that should warm us back into the mid 60s East River to the 70s in the west. \nMonday will be the warmest day of the week. With a partly cloudy sky, we’re going highs in the 70s – ten or more degrees above normal. \nWe’re putting showers in the forecast Tuesday and Wednesday next week, but at this point it looks like they will be very light because the air will still be dry. Highs should be slightly above-normal, in the 60s the rest of the week. © 2015 KELOLAND TV.
