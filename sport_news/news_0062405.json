Coach Gary Kubiak said Monday that Nelson is also dealing with an ankle injury. \nRookie left tackle Ty Sambrailo returned to practice after missing the last three games with a shoulder injury. \nSambrailo said Monday that he's still taking it \"day by day\" but hopes to return to game action Nov. 1. \nWATCH: Broncos defense can improve by limiting penalties Advertisement \n\"It's been frustrating, but also (I have) been very informed. I get to kind of watch the game from a different angle with a different appreciation for the speed of the game and kind of the intensity,\" he said. \"I can kind of step back and watch players play. I don't have to worry about necessarily being prepared to go out there and compete. I can kind of look at it from a different perspective.\" \nOne familiar face who was missing: Kapri Bibbs. The former Colorado State standout was activated for last Sunday's game but released Monday to clear a roster spot for tight end Richard Gordon. \nThe team hopes to re-sign Bibbs to its practice squad once he clears waivers Tuesday afternoon. \nKubiak gave the players the rest of the week off, to spend time away from the facility, but many said much of their time off will be consumed by film study and workouts as the Packers await. \n\"I've already watched three games,\" cornerback Chris Harris said. \"I'm going back to Texas, where my big home is and just relax. I'll always watch film, and I like watching myself, too, just to see where I can improve over the bye. We all know how big of a game this is, so if I even have to watch extra, I'll do that.\" \nNicki Jhabvala: njhabvala@denverpost.com or @NickiJhabvala Get sports news and updates right in your inbox \nSign up to receive news alerts and a daily roundup of all things Colorado sports delivered to your inbox.
