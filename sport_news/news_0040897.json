The peace of the offseason is resonating softly throughout the valley. This time of year, with lower water flows and cooler weather, anglers should take note of numerous factors to continue their inherent success on local waters. Float and wade fishing throughout the valley have remained quite consistent this past week. The factors anglers need to be considering as we move into shorter and cooler days will be to focus on the slower, deeper pools and get your flies down deep during non-hatch periods. Water temperatures have been dropping, and trout will begin to seek the warmth of slower, deeper pools and runs. This cooling-off also reduces the fish’s activity periods throughout the day. Thus, late mornings through early afternoons are generally the best times to target fish. This is not to say that you cannot have good fishing earlier or later, but banker’s hours will be most consistent day in and day out. Stay on the technical side of things with your flies, leader and tippets. Low, slow and clear water means tiny 18 to 22 midge and baetis patterns attached to 5X, 6X and, yes, 7X tippets. Plenty of weight to bounce your offerings along the bottom where fish will be stacked up. Overall, the key to finding fish throughout the fall is time, depth and technique. The only variable to this will be swinging or stripping large streamers to produce some more violent takes. Favorite technical patterns are Tungsten Hoovers, Bling Midge, Rojo Midges, gray RS2s, Biot Baetis and Baetis Soft Hackles. For the meaty streamer stuff, try Autumn Splendors, Baby Gongas, Clousers and Willy White Shoes. Stop in your favorite shop and get the inside scoop for the day, have them write you a sick note, and go enjoy some hot fall fishing!
