He was transported to Advocate Christ Hospital in Oak Lawn.\nThe scene of the shooting is a few blocks north of the intersection of Lincoln and Governors highways.\nJones, in a prepared statement, said witnesses told police the man was visiting his girlfriend when he stepped outside after receiving a telephone call. A black SUV reportedly left the scene going west immediately after the shooting.\nJones said a police officer in the vicinity heard 10-15 shots and immediately headed to the scene to find the victim \"stumbling towards the front\" of a home before collapsing.\nInvestigators recovered 10-15 spent shell casings \"strewn around the street.\"\nThe South Suburban Major Crimes Task Force is assisting with the investigation.\nAnyone with information is asked to call (708) 503-3130.\nDennis Sullivan is a freelance reporter.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Daily Southtown Shootings", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5621276b/turbine/ct-man-shot-in-matteson-1017"], "published": "2015-10-16T19:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:23:28.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
