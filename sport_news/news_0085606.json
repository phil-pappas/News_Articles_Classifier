He was 75.\nHe had no formal training and was the first American-born chef hired by elegant Commander's Palace. He stirred up a nationwide appetite for Cajun food by serving gumbo, jambalaya and other dishes once largely unknown outside Louisiana.\nHe left Commander's to open K-Paul's, a casual spot named for himself and his wife Kay Prudhomme, who died in 1993.\nHe is survived by wife Lori Bennett Prudhomme, brother Eli Prudhomme, and numerous nieces, nephews, grandnieces and grandnephews.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
