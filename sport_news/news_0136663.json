But good teams find ways to win even when they don't play well, and we did that.\" \nThe Bulldoggs did so thanks in large part to the play of running back Cece Green, as the senior standout scored three unanswered touchdowns in the fourth quarter to help Winder erase a 25-10 deficit. It was the second time this season Winder overturned a two-score deficit in the fourth quarter. \nThe Bulldoggs actually took a 10-6 lead, but turnovers stunted their budding momentum and forced Winder to chase the contest, as Cedar pulled in front. \nAfter Green scored twice to pull within 25-23 -- the Bulldoggs' two-point conversion attempt failed -- Winder moved in toward the winning touchdown, only to watch Cedar Shoals pick off a pass at the Jaguars 1-yard line with less than two minutes to play. The Bulldoggs refused to yield, however, forcing a fumbled snap that they recovered near the goal line to set up Green's go-ahead score in the dying seconds. \n\"We know we'll have more moments like this, and it's big to keep winning,\" Webb said. \"And credit to our offensive line; they took over late in the game.\" \nWinder will play host to Clarke Central next week.
