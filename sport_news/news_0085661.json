Keeâ€™s proposal would save the city approximately $2,000 per month in PERS contributions that it would not have to pay during the six-month period. The proposal would allow Kee to finish projects and give the City Council time to recruit his replacement. Councilors will consider Kee's proposal during their meeting Tuesday, which starts at 7 p.m. at City Hall, 1655 First St.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T09:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:11:46.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
