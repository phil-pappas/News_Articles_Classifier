The Raiders present too inviting a matchup to waste. Oakland has allowed the most points to tight ends, giving up at least a touchdown each week and two 100-yard games.\nWith Alshon Jeffery hobbled (he's a question mark to return as well), Bennett has been the main man, leading the Bears in catches (13) and yards (118). He's also the only Bear besides Josh Bellamy to catch a touchdown pass.\nIt's understandable if starting any Bear gives you pause, but Bennett is worth the risk in this case.\nSTART\nDavid Carr, QB, Raiders at Bears\nnoon Sunday, CBS-2, WBBM-AM 780 (all times Central)\nThe Bears defense probably isn't as bad as their reputation. After all, the Packers and Cardinals look like two of the most prolific offenses in the league this season. But their secondary has been in flux, with the Bears benching Kyle Fuller and releasing Brock Vereen. They also have four sacks and just one interception. If the Bears can't get to Carr, he and Amari Cooper should have a stellar connection.\nWeek 4 fantasy waiver wire: Rishard Matthews leads a who's who of ... who? Phil Thompson Carlos Hyde looks like a flash-in-the-pan. So does Percy Harvin. Terrance Williams may be lucky just to catch another pass as long as Brandon Weeden is under center.\nOn the other hand, Travis Benjamin and Kendall Wright may stick around awhile.\nBy the third week of the regular season, you begin...\nCarlos Hyde looks like a flash-in-the-pan. So does Percy Harvin. Terrance Williams may be lucky just to catch another pass as long as Brandon Weeden is under center.\nOn the other hand, Travis Benjamin and Kendall Wright may stick around awhile.\nBy the third week of the regular season, you begin...\n(Phil Thompson) Karlos Williams, RB, Bills vs. Giants\nHe's the only player to rush for a touchdown in each game. The Bills may LeSean McCoy (hamstring), which gives Williams a full workload. Williams is a more powerful back but he doesn't have McCoy's receiving skills, which would've been an advantage against a defense that has given up the second most receiving yards to running backs.\nMelvin Gordon, RB, Chargers vs. Browns\nIf you've noticed Gordon hasn't found the end zone yet, you're not alone. “Oh, yeah, I’m hungry to score,” he told the San Diego Union-Tribune Wednesday . “I feel like everyone has scored but me.” Gordon has had a couple of chances to score but have come up just short. The Browns have given up the third most points (25.7) to running backs as well as a league-worst 158.3 yards per game.\nBrandon Marshall, WR, Jets at Dolphins (London)\n8:30 a.m. Sunday, CBS-2\nForget the revenge factor, that element's often overblown (and it didn't help Marshall against Miami last season when he was a Bear). Don't concern yourself with Jet lag either. An ESPN reporter wrote last year about Wembley Stadium's effect on players' production and found it negligible. Marshall looks like Ryan Fitzpatrick's main go-to option with Eric Decker a possible scratch with a sprained knee. Marshall likely will draw Pro Bowl cornerback Brent Grimes at least part time, but as a whole the Dolphins secondary hasn't been as formidable as in the past.\nCardinals defense vs. Rams\nArizona has the second best fantasy defense so far, and they host a Rams team that has given opposing defenses 11.3 points per game, third most on ESPN.\nSIT\nMichael Vick, QB, Steelers vs. Ravens\nTake this projection with a caveat: Does your league penalizes quarterbacks for sacks and turnovers? Vick is high risk for both. The Ravens have had some success slowing down Le'Veon Bell -- or at least more than most teams -- so Vick may have to expose himself to negative plays more than he or the Steelers would like.\nTeddy Bridgewater, QB, Vikings at Broncos\nDenver has given up one score through the air and have held quarterbacks to an average of 4.8 fantasy points in nfl.com's system. It doesn't set up well for Bridgewater, who only has one passing touchdown through three games.\nC.J. Anderson, RB, Broncos vs. Vikings\nThe law of averages says Anderson has to produce eventually, but if we're talking math, there are too many other variables working against him to risk it. Anderson has the worst average (2.3 yards) among Denver's running backs, the team is averaging only 57 rushing yards per game, and in the last two games, the Vikings have held opposing rushers under 100 yards and out of the end zone.\nJustin Forsett, RB, Ravens at Steelers\nSay what you will about the \"weak\" Steelers defense, Dion Lewis' 69 was the most yards a running back has gained on them, and none have scored.\nForsett also doesn't have a great track record against Pittsburgh. He gained a total of 94 yards in two games last against them last year. To put it into context, he followed a scoreless, 38-yard performance at Heinz Field with three straight 100-yard games and four touchdowns.\nJosh Hill, TE, Saints vs. Cowboys\n7:30 p.m. Sunday, NBC-5\nIt's safe to say Hill is no Jimmy Graham. He has two catches -- two -- for the season, and the Cowboys have all but shut down tight ends. It doesn't help that Drew Brees is hurt and wasn't his usual self before the injury. Hill's not worth holding on to while New Orleans sorts out it offensive issues.\nSLEEPERS\nEli Manning, QB, Giants at Bills\nThe headline of this matchup blares \"stay away from Manning.\" Wideout Victor Cruz is out (again), the offensive line is an albatross and Manning gets no support from the running game. But as tough as the Bills defense is, they've had teams throw on them -- no fewer than 49 pass attempts and two touchdowns in any game this season. Having Odell Beckham Jr. to throw to doesn't hurt Manning's cause, either.\nAlfred Blue, RB, Texans vs. Browns\nArian Foster's a game-time decision, but if he does play it would be hard to see him getting anything much work coming off a groin injury. Why push him into action against what looks like a favorable opponent. The Eagles and Giants may have given false impressions about the stoutness of Atlanta's defense. Turns out they just have crummy running games.\nThe Cowboys exposed the Falcons' flaws, and if there's one thing the Blue do is run on a soft matchup. Blue ran for 139 yards against Tampa Bay in Week 3. Last season, he scored in both Jacksonville games and put up 156 rushing yards against the Browns.\nThomas Rawls, RB, Seahawks vs. Lions\n7:30 p.m. Monday, ESPN\nMarshawn Lynch is a gametime decision for Monday night after missing time during the Bears game, a significant sign given that Lynch has played in all 16 games the last three seasons. If he doesn't go, Rawls is a good play against a defense that clearly misses Ndamukong Suh.\nJames Starks, RB, Packers at 49ers\n3:25 p.m. Sunday, FOX-32\nTwo things work in Starks' favor: Eddie Lacy (ankle) is hurt, though he looks like a go, and the matchup has the makings of an early blowout by Green Bay. Starks may see additional touches to spare Lacy.\nMarvin Jones, WR, Bengals vs. Chiefs\nMohamed Sanu's fading out of view as Jones' targets have increased each week and he's found paydirt in each of the last two games. The Chiefs have forked over at least two scores to wide receivers every week, and each team's WR2 has posted at least 100 yards or a touchdown.\nQuincy Enunwa, WR, Jets at Dolphins\nIf Decker sits, Enunwa may see a lot of work particularly if he's matched up against Brice McCain. The cornerback has been targeted by opposing teams the past two games.\nGolden Tate, WR, Lions at Seahawks\nThe Seahawks gave up 215 yards to Packers receivers and 17 to Bears receivers. The truth is somewhere in between. Richard Sherman and company will have to contend with Calvin Johnson will get a chance to shine against his old team.\nplthompson@tribpub.com\nTwitter @ _phil_thompson\nPrivacy Policy Fantasy Sports Chicago Bears Jay Cutler Martellus Bennett Pittsburgh Steelers Seattle Seahawks Oakland Raiders", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dc1f1/turbine/ct-week4-fantasy-football-picks-20150930", "http://espn.go.com/fantasy/football/story/_/id/11593522/does-travel-wembley-stadium-london-affect-fantasy-stats", "http://twitter.com/_phil_thompson", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560be358/turbine/ct-week-4-fantasy-football-waiver-wire-rankings-20150929", "http://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/2015/oct/01/sd-sp-chargers-melvin-gordon-td/"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:00:21.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
