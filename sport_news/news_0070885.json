The captains are still finding schools of both yellowfin and longfin tuna between 30 and 100 pounds in good numbers in the Hudson Canyon, about a 90-mile ride from the inlets.\nAfter canceling Sunday night's trip due to ocean conditions, Capt. Howard Bogan of the 125-foot Jamaica was back out in the Hudson Canyon on a 31-hour trip Tuesday into Wednesday. When they were done they put 60 tuna in the boat and one high-speed wahoo.\nBogan left the dock early Tuesday morning and was set up on the anchor around 1:30 in the afternoon. However, an afternoon bite never materialized.\n\"We were only anchored for 15 minutes before we landed our first tuna. Another one was landed shortly after that. We started to read fish and it looked like it was going to be a good day.However, it was a very slow pick through the night,\" said Bogan.\nThe bite didn't start in earnest until after sun up Wednesday, around 7:30 a.m. when they ended up tripling their catch in a few hours after a slow pick the afternoon and night before.\nA couple of the anglers who had good catches were Mike Vastola from Lavallette with 1 yellowfin and 4 longfin and Mike Houdart from Marlton with 1 yellowfin, 2 longfin, and a 70-pound wahoo.\nCapt. Bob Bogan of the Gambler took 22 anglers out on a 36-hour trip that left the dock at 8 a.m. for the Hudson Canyon.\nAs he approached the canyon he made some drifts for mahi-mahi and said they were able to catch them for about three hours. The fish were right around the 10-pound range.\nAfter that, they settled on anchor.\nThe tuna started out slow but then got good in flurries and lulls. The yellowfin were in the 30 to 100 pound range. The longfin were on the smaller side, at 30 to 50 pounds. They ran into one bigeye tuna that was boated and weighed about 150 pounds.\nBy 6 a.m. the action slowed up so Bogan put his anglers over a deep water wreck about 10 miles to the west of the canyon tip where they caught some big pollock up to 22 pounds and a few jumbo white hake.\nThe Miss Barnegat Light made a couple runs early in the week coming back with over 50 tuna on one trip and 20 the next. The difference was the conditions. One the second trip, which began with freeze warnings on land, was hampered by wind and rain offshore.\nDan Radel: 732-643-4072; dradel@gannettnj.comn", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:28:29.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
