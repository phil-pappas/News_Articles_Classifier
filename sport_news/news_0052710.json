There’s practice and game prep, and interviews and meetings that take up most of the day.\nArizona will play 12 straight weekends this season with no rest. No matter what happens every Saturday, win or lose, preparations for the week ahead start promptly on Sunday.\nUA (3-2 overall, 0-2 Pac-12) returned from last week’s road trip at nearly 4 a.m. By then, preparation for Saturday’s 1 p.m. game at Arizona Stadium against Oregon State already began.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Wildcats vs. Oregon State Beavers: TV, radio, stadium information\nFor coaches, there are many sleepless nights. This was one of them.\nThe culprit — losing. Arizona lost its last two games to Stanford and UCLA by a combined 64 points. It felt like 100.\n“It’s been miserable, it’s been absolutely miserable.” Rodriguez said. “Outwardly, we try to be as positive as possible because it’s not like the guys aren’t trying. But we haven’t slept much. It’s not fun.”\nNow, Arizona is coming off its worst two-game stretch of losing since 2003, the season John Mackovic was fired.\n“They’re always long weeks anyway,” Rodriguez said, “but this has been the longest week.”\nRELATED: College football schedule | College football odds\nEvery game is a must-win. Any coach or player can, and will, say that.\nBut the Wildcats aren’t hiding from this one — Arizona needs to beat Oregon State on Saturday.\nArizona should be getting some reinforcements: quarterback Anu Solomon is expected to return after missing the last six quarters with a concussion. In his absence, the Wildcats have played Jerrard Randall at quarterback to mixed results. Tyrell Johnson, a speedy receiver who hasn’t played yet this season, is expected to play, too.\nStill, with or without Solomon, Arizona will look to avoid its first three-game losing skid since 2012, Rodriguez’s first year at UA, when the Wildcats lost to Oregon, Oregon State and Stanford back-to-back-to-back.\nAZCENTRAL\nRich Rodriguez 28th, Todd Graham 33rd on list of highest-paid college football head coaches\n“Coming off two big losses, you want to change things,” guard Jacob Alsadek said. “You want to make things better. You want things to work, because sometimes you feel like after two losses that some things aren’t working right.”\nOregon State (2-2, 0-1) is widely considered the Pac-12’s bottom dweller, the pick to finish in last place in the preseason, and seemingly a perfect antidote to Arizona’s recent struggles. The Beavers’ two wins have come against San Jose State and Weber State — not exactly Stanford and UCLA. They played Michigan close for one quarter, but the Wolverines eventually won 35-7. Two weeks ago — Oregon State had a bye last week — the Beavers allowed 42 points and 325 rushing yards in a loss to Stanford.\nArizona knows that feeling — it’s sickening.\nStanford running back Christian McCaffrey gashed Arizona’s bruised and battered defense to the tune of 156 yards a week ago. As a team, Stanford rushed for 314 and four touchdowns on the way to a 55-17 win.\nAll offseason, Arizona was still feeling the good vibes from an improbable 2014 that saw 10 wins, a Pac-12 South title and a berth in the Fiesta Bowl.\nRight now, that luster is lost.\n“That all got in our head, I personally believe,” receiver Samajie Grant said. “As a team, it’s embarrassing for us. It’s messed up because we came in as a top team, and now we’re not even ranked. It’s all motivation for us.”\nAZCENTRAL\nUA football looks to get back to winning ways\nOregon State coach Gary Andersen is in his first year in the Pac-12, and will face Arizona for the first time as a head coach on Saturday.\nHe knows what he’s walking into. A team reeling, looking to end a losing skid.\n“Those kids are going to come out and expect to win,” Andersen said. “Yeah, they’ve had a couple of tough losses, but it’s nothing they haven’t been through before.”\nIt’s Family Weekend at UA, complete with a rare afternoon start. Even if it’s not a sell-out, Arizona Stadium will be packed and loud, filled with students and their families.\nOn the field, the Wildcats are hoping they all have something to cheer for.\n“Every game is important, we hear that all the time,” receiver Nate Phillips said. “But coming off two losses, we really want to stop losing to be honest.”\nIf all goes well, maybe Arizona’s coaches can finally get some sleep.\nThe last two games have “definitely been a wake-up call,” Grant said. “Now, we just gotta play Arizona football.”", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d825dd0c9b924527b38fc8f808e87a0706bc8346/c=0-0-3803-3803/local/-/media/2015/10/06/Phoenix/Phoenix/635797678490481004-anu.jpg", "http://azcentral.sportsdirectinc.com/sports-scores/College-Football-Scores-Matchups.aspx", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3bbfbeaf9e1d17a70003703012eace67f4f159ee/c=484-0-3548-3064/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Phoenix/Phoenix/635799053622504206-ctg-richrod.jpg", "http://azcentral.sportsdirectinc.com/odds/ncaaf.aspx", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dd464e104edc78227cd8f7048fb5d519a97b067c/c=0-0-5177-2925&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/10/08/Phoenix/Phoenix/635799184459746506-ua-red.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-10T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:23:12.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
