It shows exactly what we're about. We're like brothers on the pitch.” \nBelgium inflicted Andorra's 49th defeat in Euro qualifying, making light of a rain-soaked, plastic pitch to record a 4-1 victory and a fifth European qualification. \nMarc Wilmots's side were a goal to the good after 19 minutes when Roma's Radja Nainggolan scored with a long-range effort which took a slight deflection off Andorra defender Marc Rebes. \nThree minutes before the break, Manchester City's Kevin De Bruyne unleashed a 25-yard freekick which soared into the top corner of the goal. \nIldefons Lima pulled a goal back for Andorra from the penalty spot in the 51st minute before Eden Hazard restored Belgium's two-goal advantage, also from the spot, five minutes later. \nLaurent Depoitre added a fourth for Belgium while Hazard missed a late penalty. \nKnife-edge \nIn Group A, 2014 World Cup semi-finalists the Netherlands remain on a knife-edge as far as their hopes are concerned. \nThey enjoyed a 2-1 win in Kazakhstan but Turkey, their rivals for a play-off spot, then stunned the Czech Republic 2-0 to preserve their two-point lead. \nIceland and the Czechs had already secured Group A qualification. \nGeorginio Wijnaldum put the Dutch ahead in the 33rd minute in Baku, while Wesley Sneijder added a second on 50 minutes to keep them on track despite Islambek Kuat grabbing a consolation goal deep into added time. \nFormer Arsenal and Manchester United striker Robin Van Persie came on as a late substitute to earn his 100th cap for the Netherlands, who were European champions in 1988. \nIn Prague, Selcuk İnan gave Turkey the lead with a 62nd-minute penalty with Hakan Calhanoglu adding a second with 10 minutes left. \nIn the last qualifiers on October 13, the Dutch host the Czechs and Turkey welcome Iceland. \nA point will be enough for Turkey following a draw and their home win in head-to-head encounters with the Netherlands. \nIceland, already qualified for their first ever major finals, drew 2-2 with Latvia. \nItaly qualified with a 3-1 win over Azerbaijan, while in the same group Norway's 2-0 win over Malta left them on the brink of also making the finals. \nItaly's hard-fought win in Group H was assured with goals from Eder, Stephan El Shaarawy and Matteo Darmian, but Antonio Conte's side had a nervy time in Baku. \nNorway are second in the group but Croatia kept up the pressure for an automatic qualifying spot with a 2-0 win over Bulgaria in Zagreb. \nCroatia were quickly in charge when Ivan Perisic netted his fifth goal in eight outings after just two minutes, beating Bozhidar Mitrev from close range after a fine through ball by Luka Modric. \nJust before the break, Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic added the second. \nCroatia conclude their campaign in Malta on Tuesday on the same night that Norway go to Italy. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:59:11.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
