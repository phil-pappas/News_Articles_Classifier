(Image Source: USA TODAY Sports Images) \nWeek 6 preview: \n-5 & 0h! Through five weeks, the Atlanta Falcons, Cincinnati Bengals, Denver Broncos and Green Bay Packers are all 5-0, with two more teams capable of getting there with a win on Sunday. The Carolina Panthers and New England Patriots are 4-0 entering Week 6. \nThe record for most teams to start a season 5-0 is five, set in 2009, which can be tied or broken with wins by Carolina and/or New England on Sunday. The Panthers play at the Seattle Seahawks and the Patriots visit the Indianapolis Colts in a rematch of the AFC Championship Game. \n-Three Under But Not Out: The Baltimore Ravens and Kansas City Chiefs were considered by many to be playoff/division contenders in the AFC, however they are off to 1-4 starts, which has caused many of those many to now write them off. However, history tells us, while a postseason run remains unlikely that may be premature. \nSince 1990, when the current 12-team playoff format was instituted, there have been 15 teams that found themselves three games under .500 at some point in the season and bounced back to play postseason football. The most recent being the 2014 Carolina Panthers, who were at least three games under .500 four times last season, 3-6-1, 3-7-1, 4-8-1 and 5-8-1. Of the 15 teams five started the season 1-4. \n-The 30,000-Yard Club: Green Bay Packers QB Aaron Rodgers has thrown for 29,814 yards in his career, leaving him 186 yards away from reaching the 30,000-yard plateau. So far, A-Rod has attempted 3,628 passes and unless it takes him 67 passes to throw for 186 yards he will get to 30,000 passing yards in the fewest attempts of any player in NFL history. \nSunday will be his 116 th game and he would get there in the fourth-fewest games if he does so against the San Diego Chargers. Among his 115 games, Rodgers came in relief of Brett Favre seven times while he served as his backup from 2005-07. It took Kurt Warner and Dan Marino 114 games to get there, and Peyton Manning 115 to reach 30,000. \n-Tom Terrific: If Aaron Rodgers isn’t your MVP five weeks in, then it probably is New England Patriots QB Tom Brady . He has thrown for 1,387 yards and 11 TDs with no INTs for a passer raring of 121.5, which leads the NFL. \nOnly three quarterbacks—Peyton Manning (20 in 2013), Nick Foles (19 in 2013) and Milt Plum (16 in 1960)—have ever started a season with at least 15 TD passes without throwing an interception. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
