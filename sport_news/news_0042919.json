Jordan Tomberlin and Nick Davidson, both 14, were awarded their Junior Black Belts and Jamieson Dettmer, 18, was awarded his adult black belt or Sho–Dan. \nThe following students were also promoted: Augie and Sammie McCrossen, Yellow Belts; Ryan Stack and Keith Callahan, Green Belts; Michael Scott McCrosson, Brown Tip; Zoey Beskow and Abigail Tomberlin, two brown tips; Brittany and Bill Stanley, Brown Belts; and Jeff Tomberlin, two black tips, Ik-Kyu. \n“All students showed tremendous discipline and dedication to their training and this was evident at the testing,” said school director Sensei Des Chaskelson. “These positive traits learned in karate training serve the students well in their school and later lives. We are very proud of them all.” \nThe board of judges included WMKA black belts: Sensei Des Chaskelson, 5th degree; Stu Warren, 2nd degree; and 1st- degree black belts Jean Chipman, Jason Christian and Charlie Williams. \nCocoa Beach Karate School, founded in 2002, offers classes to adults, teens and kids at two locations; Cocoa Beach Health & Fitness as well as the Cocoa Beach Recreation Center. \nThe school is a dojo member of the World Matsubayashi Karate Association (WMKA) based in Okinawa, Japan, with members throughout the world.
