Relatives drove to the airport, but did not find Lee Jan.\nShe was not heard from again by her family in Roanoke, although they hired a private investigator several times in an attempt to find her. Katherine filed an official missing person report with the Jeff Davis Sheriff's Office on Feb. 18, 2014.\nThe truth surfaced when a Tennessee woman began looking into her own mother's past. Elizabeth Neese, who lives in Memphis, was left with many questions about her mother's childhood when Lisa Neese died from cancer in 2008.\n\"There was something that was funny in her obituary,\" said Woods, \"that made her daughter look into it.\"\nElizabeth's search led her to the LSU site for missing and unidentified persons. There, she found a photo of Lee Jan Kratzer.\n\"Lady calls from Tennessee and says that may be her mother,\" said Woods.\n\"He laid out these pictures in front of me and I just burst into tears,\" said Katherine Kratzer, \"I knew it was her.\"\nIt was discovered Lee Jan Kratzer and Lisa Neese were the same person.\nDetectives used DNA from both daughters to determine that Lisa Neese was, in fact, Lee Jan Kratzer.\n\"It is unfortunate that Lee Jan Marie Kratzer was not discovered before her passing, but the connection of her two daughters will bring closure to the family and an opportunity to share memories,\" Woods said.\n\"I'm glad I didn't give up, because I have more now - might not be what I wanted - but I know more now than I did yesterday,\" said Kratzer.\nCopyright 2015 KPLC .
