Trailing, 13-10, with 1:45 left in the contest, Lions’ wide receiver Calvin Johnson caught a pass and was heading for the end zone when the ball was batted from his grasp by Seattle safety Kam Chancellor. The ball bounced in the end zone where Seattle linebacker K.J. Wright deliberately tapped the ball out of bounds calling a halt to the play. By league rule, a player cannot bat the ball in any direction while it’s in the end zone. By that same league rule, Wright should have been hit with a penalty and the Lions should have retained possession of the ball inside the one-yard line. Instead, the play was ruled a touchback and Seattle was given the ball at the 20-yard line. Why? Because the back judge official said that, in his judgment, he didn’t feel (the tapping of the football) “was an overt act.” To rub salt in the Lions’ wound, the play could not be reviewed because it was a judgment call and, by rule, judgment calls cannot be review. Say what? When a receiver makes a controversial catch along the sidelines and the pass is called incomplete how many times has the play been reviewed because of a coach’s challenge? Why was the pass called incomplete in the first place? Because, IN THE JUDGMENT of the on-scene official, the receiver had just one foot inbounds when the league rule states he must have two feet down. And, why does any official throw a flag? Because, IN HIS JUDGMENT, some kind of infraction occurred prior to, during or after a play. He wouldn’t throw a flag unless, IN HIS JUDGMENT, there was a need to throw one. If, by rule, judgment calls cannot be reviewed in the National Football League, there shouldn’t be any review of plays that are punctuated by the throwing of a flag. If Monday night’s controversial play had been reviewed, even Stevie Wonder would have seen that Wright had intentionally tapped the fumbled ball out of bounds and instead of Seattle getting the ball at the 20 and being allowed to possibly run out the final seconds, Detroit would have been given the ball at the spot of the fumble (inside the one) and would have set up for what could have been its first winning touchdown of the season. … If Dallas Keuchel and Jake Arrieta aren’t the Cy Young Award winners in the American and National Leagues, respectively, members of the Baseball Writers Association of America should be subject to mandatory competency testing. The two most popular bearded wonders since Rip Van Winkle have each put up Cy Young-like numbers with 20 and 22 wins, 200-plus strikeouts and sub- 2.50 ERAs, respectively. But, more importantly, they single-handedly pitched the Astros and Cubs into the playoffs when most preseason outlets predicted those teams to finish last in their respective divisions. Keuchel (20-8, 216 strikeouts and a 2.48 ERA) gets my phantom vote over David Price who helped lift Toronto to a division championship after a stint with the Tigers while Arrieta (22-6, 236 strikeouts and a 1.77 ERA) is my clear-cut favorite over Zack Greinke, who shared the pitching load with multi-Cy Young winner Clayton Kershaw on a strong Los Angeles Dodgers team that was expected to and did reach the playoffs. …. Normally, I look forward to the start of another Celtics season with about as much enthusiasm as anticipating the area’s first major snow storm. But this year is an exception. That’s because I anticipate having a new favorite player in David Lee, the former Knicks and Warriors veteran who came to the Celtics from Golden State via an offseason trade. Nothing special about this 31-year-old guy, but the fact he’s averaged just under 15 points a game for10 seasons and has taken just one 3-point shot in his career, means he’s getting all of his points from the wing, inside or free throw line and the 6-9, 250-or-so pound power forward/center has averaged over nine rebounds a game (6.7 on the defensive end) in his 10-year career which makes him exactly what the Celtics need. … Time to call it a day and head for the parking garage for the short ride home. If I’m lucky, maybe I’ll run into the nice couple I met on Monday on my walk to the car. They were out-of-staters on their way to the Whaling Museum and the lady asked me what the city of New Bedford is famous for. So I told her what I thought was the truth. “I would say the fishing industry, the Whaling Museum, and orange and white caution barrels,” I said. “What do you mean about the caution barrels,?” she asked. “You’ll see on your drive home,” I said, before wishing both of them a nice day.
