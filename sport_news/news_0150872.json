(WHAS11) – We normally see the Lady Cards sinking shots and racking up the scoreboard. \nTheir minds have been heavy lately with so much publicity on their campus with the recent release of Breaking Cardinal Rules and then a Sports Illustrated article released two weeks later saying the campus is dangerous for women implying \"the school's athletic department is teaching its male athletes that women can be used and discarded.\" \n\"Honestly when you read I said 'well that's not true – that's how you know how great you really are when people try to tear it down. They don't try to tear down the little things, people try to tear down empires that are strong and successful,\" red-shirt junior forward Courtnee Walton said. \nWalton says those words and many others are a terrible representation of her school. \n\"Going on four years here, I've never felt vulnerable or that I was a sitting duck or that I didn't have the support system that we have here,\" she said. \nAs the ladies gear up for an undoubtedly tough season against top opponents, the players say they'd never though they'd have new opponents in the media and a book that's launched intense investigations. \n\"I feel confident we'll prevail from it because I don't believe it's true,\" sophomore forward Myisha Hines-Allen said. \nThe Lady Cards say they're standing by their men's team and their school not because they have to but because they say it'll take more than allegations and one-sided views to tear apart phenomenal accomplishments. \n\"We'll just put aside all the negativity that's going on around us and be the university that's always been amazing,\" Hines-Allen said. \nBeyond the free throws and rebounds these are college age women who say they've never felt safer and more secure. \nThe Lady cards also say there's no special treatment for them all athletes work just as hard to get where they are and they too invite Sports Illustrated and any other naysayers to see the campus for how wonderful it truly is.
