With only 3 per cent of India’s population, the tiny state provides two-thirds of India’s palliative care services,” said the ‘Quality of Death: Ranking end-of-life care across the world’ report.\n“Moreover, the state has a formal palliative care policy in place (it is the only Indian state with such a policy) and its government provides funding for community-based care programmes,” it said.\nKerala’s unique system revolves around the Neighbourhood Network in Palliative Care (NNPC) project, co-founded by Suresh Kumar with the aim of improving both accessibility and quality of end-of-life care.\n“There are a lot of medical problems, but there are also a lot of social, spiritual and financial issues’ so anybody who has time to spare can, if properly trained, take care of these people,” he said.\nPalliative care advocates not only in developing countries but also across the world are studying Kerala’s potent combination of government support and civic involvement in end-of-life care, the report said.\nThe bottom ranks of the Quality of Death Index are dominated by developing and BRIC countries, such as India, China, Mexico, Brazil and Uganda, where progress on providing end-of-life care is slow.\nTaiwan has the highest rank in Asia, at sixth position. India and China ranked 67th and 71st respectively.\nThe upper rungs of the index are dominated by wealthy European, Asia-Pacific and North American countries.\nAustralia is second, New Zealand third and Ireland and Belgium complete the top five. The US is ninth in the index.\n“A very strong marker in our index is the availability of specialised palliative care workers and this is where the UK scores particularly well. The other super strong marker is the way that the countries do have a plan for palliative care. That means they are on the dynamic of measuring progress and improving,” said Annie Pannelay, EIU’s healthcare specialist.\nThe Quality of Death Index, commissioned by the Lien Foundation, a Singaporean philanthropic organisation, is based on qualitative and quantitative indicators and took interviews of over 120 palliative care experts from around the world.\nFirst Published on October 07, 2015 9:19 pm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:34:38.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
