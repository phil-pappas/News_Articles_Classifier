(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) \nThe Nationals are interviewing former longtime manager Dusty Baker on Wednesday, while another former longtime manager, Ron Gardenhire, is expected to be interviewed next week, according to people familiar with the situation. \nWhile the Nationals have cast a wide net for candidates to fill the week-old managerial vacancy, Baker and Gardenhire are clear signs the team is eyeing experience in their search. \nBaker was a three-time National League Manager of the Year — 1993, 1997 and 2000 with the San Francisco Giants — but hasn’t managed since being dismissed after the 2013 season with the Cincinnati Reds. Gardenhire was the American League Manager of the Year in 2010 and won six AL Central titles before being fired in 2014 after 13 years at the helm of the Minnesota Twins. \nThe San Francisco Chronicle first reported Baker’s Wednesday interview with the Nationals, while MLB.com’s Nationals site mentioned Gardenhire’s upcoming interview. Both candidates first stated their interest in the Nationals’ job to the Post last week . \n“It’s a good team,” said Baker, who reached out to the Nationals in 2013 but wasn’t interviewed. “I’d be interested in them.” \n“I would think Ron would definitely be interested in the Nats job,” said agent John Boggs, who represents Gardenhire. “It’s a very attractive job and city, and a good team. What’s not to like? For someone wanting to get back into managing, it’s a great opportunity.” \nBy interviewing Baker, who is African-American, the Nationals fulfill the obligation set forth by Major League Baseball to interview a minority candidate for a managerial opening. But the Nationals did not seek out Baker strictly for that reason. The Nationals have been targeting big-name veteran managers among their list of candidates after rookie manager Matt Williams was fired last week. Gardenhire already interviewed with the Padres, who are one of four teams, along with the Nationals, Marlins and Mariners, in search of a manager. \nThe Nationals began managerial interviews this week. The first publicly known interview was former major league infielder/current Diamondbacks Class AAA manager Phil Nevin, who met with the Nationals on Monday. The Nationals have been in contact with former Padres Manager Bud Black, who is seen across baseball as a strong candidate for the job, and the next step is an expected interview. \nThe list, so far, of publicly known and/or reported candidates: Baker, Gardenhire, Nevin, Black, Giants longtime bench coach Ron Wotus, and former Nationals infielder/current TV analyst Alex Cora. At last check, the Nationals hadn’t scheduled an interview with former bench coach Randy Knorr despite General Manager Mike Rizzo saying last week he hadn’t been ruled out as a candidate. As of late last week, Cal Ripken Jr., who has no minor or major league coaching or managing experience, had not been contacted. \nThere are two potential candidates that are still busy with the playoffs: Cubs bench coach Dave Martinez and Blue Jays bench coach DeMarlo Hale. Both were interviewed by the Nationals in 2013 and impressed teams officials.
