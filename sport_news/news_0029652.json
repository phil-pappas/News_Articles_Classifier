The Bulldogs scored 27 points in the first quarter on the way to a 60-0 shutout of the Pioneers. “It was a great night and we were happy for the kids,” said Baker coach Dave Johnson. “The kids did really well. We had a very special performance by our kickoff team, and pitching a shutout is always good. “We challenged our defense before the game, and they were swarming and smothering.” The win secured second place in the GOL for the Bulldogs (4-4 overall). Baker will host Cottage Grove (4-4), the third-place team from the Sky-Em League Friday or Saturday at Bulldog Memorial Stadium in a play-in game. Friday, Baker took the opening kickoff and marched 50 yards in two minutes for its first score. Brad Zemmer connected with Dominic Yervasi on a 15-yard touchdown pass. Trevor Jones added the conversion kick. Then, after stopping Mac-Hi on a three-and-out, Baker again took over at midfield. This time Zemmer converted the score on a 5-yard run. Baker needed just one play, a James Ah Hee interception, to take possession again at the Mac-Hi 47. Four plays later Jace Hays scored from 23 yards out. Jones’ kick gave Baker a 20-0 cushion. The Bulldogs took advantage of a Mac-Hi fumble to start their fourth drive. It culminated in a 25-yard touchdown pass from Zemmer to Teancum Taylor with 1:37 left in the first quarter. Ah Hee joined the scoring list early in the second period. After forcing a Pioneer punt, Ah Hee raced 36 yards to the Mac-Hi 11. Zemmer moved the ball to the 4 before Ah Hee scored to give Baker a 34-0 edge. Mac-Hi fumbled the ensuing kickoff and three plays later Marcus Plumley scored from the 1 to boost Baker up 41-0 at halftime. Baker needed just one possession to score in the third quarter. Zemmer connected with Darian Villalobos from 16 yards to give the Bulldogs a 47-0 lead with 9:37 left in the period. It also started a running clock due to the 45-point mercy rule. Johnson began getting his younger kids playing time. Eli Wright took advantage of action in the offensive backfield to score Baker’s final two touchdowns. “It was a nice finish to the regular part of the season,” Johnson said. “We got some significant minutes for the younger kids, some of who don’t get a lot of playing time.” Baker rolled up 501 total yards. Hays led Baker’s running game with 113 yards on 11 carries. Wright added 85 yards on seven carries. Seven Bulldogs carried the ball, five for 40 or more yards each. Zemmer finished 11-of-15 passing for 126 yards, including completing his final seven passes. Cody DeCarli was 3-for-3 for 28 yards. Eight Bulldogs caught passes, led by Grant Berry and Taylor with three each.
