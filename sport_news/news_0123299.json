While Rashad Jennings has been solid all season and ran well against Philadelphia on Monday night, Andre Williams appeared to bottom out against the Eagles.\n“There are sometimes where he may get a dirty look, there’s sometimes where he maybe could’ve read something a little bit better, there’s some times there are times when he doesn’t have a good play,’’ offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo said. “We’d like to see more production from Andre. We believe in Andre, and like to think he’d take advantage of his opportunities moving forward.”\nJennings carried 13 times for 63 yards and added three catches on three targets for 20 yards against the Eagles. With Williams carrying four times for just three yards — averaging under 0.8 for the game and 2.8 for the season — it begs the question whether the Giants need to dump this democracy for a meritocracy.\n“I do think that, quite frankly, Williams probably needs more carries,” coach Tom Coughlin said. “But under the present system it’s something we have to deal with.’’\nThe Giants are banged-up at middle linebacker, with starter Jon Beason and Uani ’Unga — who split time Monday night — both missing practice Thursday. Beason has a sore knee, ’Unga a neck injury. LBs Jonathan Casillas (neck) and Devon Kennard (hamstring) — who missed the past two games — were limited.\n“Status quo for the defense, right? Things as normal; hasn’t changed,” defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo said.\n’Unga, who has a team-high 42 tackles, said he’ll be able to go Sunday.\n“It seemed like everything is good,” ’Unga said. “[Kennard] is back, and seems like he’s been doing really well out there. It looks like we’ll be fine. Jon and I should be both back and ready to go by Sunday, anyway.’’\nJason Pierre-Paul could have his long-awaited meeting with the team next week.\nDE Damontre Moore was fined $20,000 for his late hit on Eagles QB Sam Bradford. He is a much-needed pass rusher, but reckless and undisciplined at times.\n“That’s a double-edged sword. … You love the high motor, you love the fact that he loves to play the game and he plays it hard,” Spagnuolo said. “The flip side is there are a number of plays that happened this year where his hustle and determination and going full speed all the time has helped. But having said that Damontre realizes that really hurt. That’s the kind of penalty you can’t afford.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T02:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:01:52.978+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
