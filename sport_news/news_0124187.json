Indiana won Game 1 of that series as well on their way to the franchise’s only championship.\n“We just believe in one another,” Fever Coach Stephanie White said. “We trust one another and we understand that no matter what happens through the course of a game, if we come together, we’re going to put ourselves in a position to win.”\nMaya Moore had 27 points and 12 rebounds, and Sylvia Fowles added 21 points and 11 rebounds for the Lynx. But Minnesota missed 8 of 23 free throws and turned the ball over 15 times to drop the opener.\n“How do we lose that game?” Lynx Coach Cheryl Reeve said after they held Indiana to 36 percent shooting. “We just didn’t do the little things at key times.”\nGame 2 in the best-of-five series is Tuesday night in Minneapolis.\nTamika Catchings had 12 points, 6 rebounds and 4 assists for the Fever, who were never rattled by Minnesota’s boisterous home crowd. They outscored Minnesota, 22-12, in second-chance points.\nThe Lynx were 19-2 at Target Center in their playoff history, the best winning percentage in the W.N.B.A. The last time they had lost at home in the playoffs was against the Fever in 2012.\nThis one followed a similar script, with the determined and gritty Fever absorbing several challenges from the Lynx and pushing back each time.\nJanuary — the tough-as-nails daughter of a karate instructor who has a black belt herself — led the way. She knocked down two tough jumpers late in the third quarter, when the Lynx had pulled to within 4 points, and was right there in the end to ice it.\nAfter the Lynx charged back to take a 62-61 lead with 4 minutes 28 seconds to play, Coleman hit a 3-pointer and scored on a backdoor cut off an inbounds pass. Then January crossed over Anna Cruz, Minnesota’s best perimeter defender, for a layup and a 68-63 lead.\nJanuary added another pull-up jumper before fouling out with 1:12 to play, and the Fever closed out another gutsy road victory.\n Related Coverage With Bold Coach, Lynx Find a Voice.
