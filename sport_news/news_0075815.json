When Howard returned last month, Klinsmann installed him as his No. 2 behind Brad Guzan. Howard sat on the bench for a pair of September exhibitions and for Saturday’s extra-time defeat at the Rose Bowl.\nBefore a crowd of just 9,214 in almost two-thirds empty Red Bull Arena, the Americans struggled defensively after second-half substitutions. \nJonathan Spector turned the ball over, leading to the goal. \nNine players returned to their professional teams following Saturday’s defeat, including six starters.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T12:15:54.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
