The New York Mets made sure to celebrate in a bigway when they finished off their sweep of the Chicago Cubs in the National League Championship Series on Wednesday night and advanced to their first World Series since 2000. Although popping the champagne in the clubhouse is nothing new during these celebrations, the Mets took things up a notch with a giant bottle. Epic. Taking a break from celebrating with his teammates, Mets pitcher Bartolo Colon had some fun getting a cameraman involved in the party. Once the Mets had done some partying in the clubhouse, they went out and celebrated on the field with the fans who had made the trip to Wrigley Field. The celebration wasn't just for the players and coaching staff, however. As good as this celebration was, this was nothing compared to what will go down should New York win the World Series. All that stands between the Mets and the celebration of a lifetime now is four wins.
