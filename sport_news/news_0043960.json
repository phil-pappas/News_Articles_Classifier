When you have a game of this magnitude, you really have to prioritize your reffing needs and place them where they are better suited,\" said Cape coach Patrick Kilby. \"The game against Tech is one of those games where a three-man crew would have definitely benefited the game in general.\" \nThe Ravens started off quickly with a goal by Marlon Trejo at the 32-minute mark. \n\"Marlon's shots from distance are always dangerous,\" said Kilby. \"We didn't implement our scouting report on them.\" \nCape's Drew Mulcahy tied the game with a header goal two minutes later. \nTech answered with goals by Michael Barr and Joshua Artiga to go into the halftime break up 3-1. \n\"We've been in this situation before and came back and won the game,\" said Kilby of being down 2-0 against Parkside in the season opener and winning the contest 3-2. \"We're definitely a team that has will and can fight back, but we can't afford to keep putting ourselves in that position.\" \nCape came out in the second half with goals by Drew Mulcahy, an own goal by the Ravens and a score by Steven Matalavage to put the Vikings in the lead 4-3. \nTech's Marlon Trejo scored his second goal of the game on a penalty kick with two minutes remaining in regulation to tie the game and send it to OT. \nA Vikings red card in the second overtime gave the Ravens an advantage in the sudden-death period. Tech's Michael Barr scored with two minutes left in the second overtime to give the Ravens the victory. \n\"We've talked about not hurting ourselves with unnecessary fouls, in regard to playing without patience, these are the things that hurt us,\" Kilby said. \nAbout receiving his team's second red card in as many games, Kilby said, \"Regardless of if they are being baited by the other players or being baited by the crowd, the bottom line is the team has to come first, and we can't afford a few teammates to act out and hurt the cause.\" \nOn Oct. 6, the Vikings got back on the winning track with a 4-0 shutout of the Lions of Red Lion Christian Academy. \n\"It's what we needed after the Tech game,\" said Kilby. \"To get back on the field quickly and have a short memory of the Tech game. Everyone got to play, and the starters got some rest time.\" \nDrew Mulcahy and Jack Ashby each had a pair of goals. The Vikings outshot the Lions 29-5. \nCape defender Tyler Malloy, right, controls the ball over the slide tackle attempt by a Tech's Oscar Angel-Velasquez.
