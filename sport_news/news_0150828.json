And he should, because he’s leading his team to victory while putting up ridiculous numbers. \nBut Alabama’s bruiser should be the Heisman favorite. \nAll Henry’s done is rush for about 100 yards a game and a touchdown, every game. He hasn’t put up any eye-popping numbers. He hasn’t had a run where he broke six tackles on the same play and was No. 1 on “SportsCenter.” He’s just always been solid. \nHenry finally had “that game” this week, with a 32-carry, 236-yard performance against Texas A&M. He set a career-high with 153 yards in the first quarter, including a 55-yard run where the 240-pound back juked a defensive back and made him fall over. And everyone in the country was watching. \nNow the hype will follow. He’s not that big of a long shot, currently No. 9 on ESPN Experts’ Poll. \nBut here’s the real reason he’s the favorite: His team. \nLooking at past Heisman winners, the team’s success is just important as the individual’s number of touchdowns. Alabama has a better team than the other Heisman candidates. \nNo matter what Fournette does the rest of the year, none of it will matter if LSU loses two games. And with the Tigers’ remaining schedule — including a game against Alabama — that’s more than possible. \nThe Heisman winner will come from one of the College Football playoff teams. And out of the candidates ahead of Henry right now, he’s got the best shot at the playoff. \nBaylor’s Seth Russell and TCU’s Trevone Boykin will cancel each other out, because a Big 12 team with one loss and no conference championship won’t make the playoff. \nOhio State’s Ezekiel Elliot has as good a chance as any, but the quarterback shuffle in Columbus has pushed him into the background. \nUtah’s Devontae Booker is in the running, but no offense, do we really think Utah is making the final four? \nFSU’s Dalvin Cook is putting up similar rushing numbers as Henry, with fewer touchdowns, in a weaker conference. \nTexas A&M’s Myles Garrett? Please. A defensive end will not win the Heisman. \nSo, the realistic Heisman list is as followed: Henry (if Alabama wins out), the quarterback of an undefeated TCU/Baylor and Elliot (if he has a Heisman moment day). \nI like Henry’s chances. \nEthan Bernal , who covers high school athletics for the Advertiser, can be reached by emailing him at ebernal@gannett.com for follow @EthanGBernal on Twitter. 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1LBrwwz TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:28:47.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
