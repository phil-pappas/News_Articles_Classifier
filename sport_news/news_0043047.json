It sends a strong message of the respect that the players have for Cheika for them to drop what they’re doing to get back to Aussie soil and to be part of it. \n“Also, what Cheik’s done as far as coming in and changing some of the rules – the eligibility rules and everything else – has shown his intent to get the best team possible to be playing in our jersey and that’s really critical too.” \nMortlock says it takes a special quality to pull off what Cheika has after being handed the coaching reigns in the bitter aftermath to Ewen McKenzie’s messy resignation. \n“Michael Cheika is a coach who has already proven he provides a fantastic culture, gets good people around him and all the players respond significantly to him and to the environment he creates,” he said. \n“From what I’ve seen and from what I hear, Cheika isn’t the sort of person that will say something to your face and do something else. \n“He absolutely stands on his integrity and on his word. He doesn’t surgarcoat things to his players either. \n“He tells them exactly what he wants from everyone and treats them with respect like adults. That’s how it should be. \n“The guys really respond to his sometimes abrasive or brutally honest approach.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:34:18.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
