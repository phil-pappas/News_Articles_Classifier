Her mother informed her that she should attend the South Carolina football game against LSU that had been moved to Baton Rouge because of flooding in Columbia, S.C. The math teacher at Holy Nativity Episcopal School in Panama City flew out Saturday morning. She was in the stands, along with her mother, as Steve Spurrier coached his final college football game. At least, that’s what Amy’s father said on Tuesday when he announced his resignation as the Gamecocks head coach. Amy flew with the football team back to Columbia last Saturday and her father told her in the car from the airport of his decision. It didn’t blindside her this time like it did when Steve Spurrier announced in early 2002 that he was leaving the University of Florida after 12 wildly successful years. She suspected it was coming. “In hindsight, I did,” Amy said. “But then I’m a middle child who never thinks anything is going to end. I never thought he’d leave Duke. “But I knew he was becoming more and more frustrated at not seeing the results of his labors.” It’s somewhat singular that when an iconic figure walks away from his identity it not only affects fandom, administration and boosters. It impacts the immediate family, and much more so than the extended one. Spurrier’s extended family dates to his playing days at Florida when he achieved the Heisman Trophy, as well as his NFL career, brief USFL coaching stint in Tampa Bay, and then collegiate posts as an assistant and head coach at Duke, his Florida reign, an NFL stop with the Washington Redskins and then his 11-year stretch in South Carolina. Through it all, Jerri Spurrier never missed one game that Steve Spurrier coached as an assistant or as the man in charge. When Steve Spurrier left the sideline, Jerri Spurrier left the stands. “I posted a Facebook picture of my mom at Death Valley, with a shadow over the field,” Amy said. “I know how much she loves being a coach’s wife. For her having to retire … I know it was not her plan at 70. They’ll be married 50 years (Sept. 14, 2016). They just like being together. My dad has always said that any success he’s had is because she handles so many details.” Amy Moody is balancing her sadness with the beginning of a joy that will blossom as time fully embraces a legacy that will be lasting. And her pride in her father’s achievements. “I’m still confused,” she said Thursday. “I don’t even know what day it is. Just that I’m proud of my dad and happy for the next chapter in his life with my mom.” Page 2 of 2 - Amy said her father might take some time and do nothing, but then she remembered the year “after the Redskins deal where he was unemployed. It didn’t go well.” Through it all, Jerri and Steve Spurrier never took their children aside and explained that their father being in the limelight could negatively impact their private lives. They did involve the kids in their father’s career, however. They let them fly with the team. Eat with the team. Attend practices. In many ways, the entire family shared in the success. Amy said she always enjoyed the ride because she instinctively knew that her father was the greatest coach ever. “Everything I ever needed to know about college football I learned when I was 11 years old,” she said. “It was 1981 and Duke at Virginia. The Blue Devils won 29-24 and my dad was an assistant coach. I learned that talented players make a difference. Being lucky is good. Winning always beats losing and my dad is the greatest coach ever. I’ve held on to that childish opinion. If kids picked on me it rolled off my back.” Steve Spurrier gave his daughter the game ball that year when Duke beat WakeForest. It was her birthday. When Amy went on to attend the University of Florida her father took charge of the Gators’ program and not only elevated it to a level never before experienced, his offensive acumen forever changed the way that football was played in the Southeastern Conference. When Steve Spurrier graced the Game*Day set on Saturday Amy Moody knew that her mother was close by. She could have been witnessing the start of her husband’s latest career, or perhaps Steve Spurrier will become a fixture on the SEC Network. In the near future, Jerri Spurrier is taking classes toward a degree in psychology at South Carolina and will graduate in December. She wants to counsel college students on how to deal with pressure. That could keep Amy’s father anchored in Columbia at least five or six more weeks. Or much longer. Before then, there’s no small matter of the Florida-South Carolina game on Nov. 14. The Moodys, in addition to Steve and Jerri Spurrier are all Florida graduates, but Amy’s brothers Scott and Steve Jr. remain on the Gamecocks’ coaching staff. “I’m thinking about running a half-marathon that day,” Amy said. “I don’t know if I can watch it. My oldest son is a freshman at Florida. Everybody in my family has a degree from Florida. We’re Gators. “I’ll have mixed feelings. Those are my dad’s players. My mom’s boys, and her coaches.” News Herald Executive Sports Editor Panama City News Herald News Herald Executive Sports Editor Posted Oct. 19, 2015 at 12:24 PM Updated at 12:26 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:47:28.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
