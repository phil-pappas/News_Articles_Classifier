So we have to be able to protect those markets. That's why as a last resort we went out and created the certain option we now have in Los Angeles,\" Fabiani said. \"And if everything is moving ahead, we're not going to be standing on the sidelines and watching everything go by. We've got to stay in the game to protect the future of the franchise.\"\nThere is a slim chance that the Bolts could stay in San Diego, however, it would involve the city's residents working out a deal to get a stadium built themselves.\n Pro Football Talk ]", "external_links": ["http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/10/24/chargers-counsel-confirms-theyll-apply-for-relocation-to-l-a/", "http://www.mighty1090.com/episode/mark-fabiani-if-theres-a-solution-here-in-san-diego-its-gonna-have-to-come-from-the-citizens-initiative-process/"], "published": "2015-10-24T17:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:24:33.882+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
