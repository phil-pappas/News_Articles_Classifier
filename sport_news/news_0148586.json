You have aches and pains, and you're snoring at 8.\" \nWhat exercise should hunters shoot for? Personal trainer Chad Gomarko recommends working out at least 30 minutes a day, with a mix of cardio, weight training and stability exercises. \n\"If you're not doing anything, I would start slow with ten minutes. Work up to 15. Gradually add in an incline and intervals,\" Gomarko said. \nIf you haven't had a chance to hit the gym, you can take steps the day of the hunt to help prevent injuries. \n\"With the walking necessary for hunting, make sure you understand how to monitor your heart rate,\" Gomarko said. \nChances are you don't carry a heart rate monitor with you, so pay attention to how you're talking to fellow hunters. \n\"When you get to the point of cardiovascular exercise that you can't talk, you're probably at the point that you're stressing your body. If you can carry on a normal conversation, you're probably not working out hard enough,\" Gomarko said. \nThanks to hours at the gym, Tuschen feels prepared to carry on his hunting tradition with his brothers. \n\"You're lugging a gun all day long. It's easier if you have a little strength,\" Tuschen said. \"Now I've got son-in-laws and grandkids, so I have four generations that I'm with. It's pretty fun,\" Tuschen said. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
