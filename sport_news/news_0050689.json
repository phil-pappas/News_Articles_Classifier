(AP Photo/AJ Mast) \nINDIANAPOLIS — Maya Moore and her Minnesota Lynx teammates started practice Saturday by watching video of her game-winning shot. \nNo, not the 3-pointer that won Game 3 of the WNBA Finals. It was the one she hit to win an AAU championship 10 years earlier when she was in high school. Lynx assistant coach Jim Petersen found the video on YouTube of Moore's Georgia Metros team. \nIn that play, Moore's teammates all fell down underneath the basket as a trick that confused their opponents. She then caught the inbounds pass around the foul line and hit the game-winner. \nHer Lynx teammates laughed and re-enacted the play. Moore described how her AAU team had been goofing around in practice the day before and one of her coaches had come up with the play. During the final timeout, her team decided to run it. \n\"We called it the falling down play,\" Moore said. \nPetersen said it most likely wouldn't be added to the Lynx's playbook. \nWhile there have been only about 4,500 views of that video on YouTube, her game-winner against Indiana on Friday night has already drawn five times as many in the first 12 hours. The shot also drew interest across the globe. \nLos Angeles Clippers guard Chris Paul, who was in China for an NBA preseason game, tweeted about it, posting video of the game-winner that already had been retweeted 2,400 times. Moore was trending on Twitter on Friday night. \n\"That's pretty cool,\" Moore said of Paul and other social media reactions. \nAs for Moore, she's taking it all in stride. \n\"Honestly, I haven't really watched it much, we have so much left to do to win this championship,\" she said. \nMoore's shot was only the second buzzer-beater in the history of the WNBA Finals. Teresa Weatherspoon's halfcourt shot for the New York Liberty that won Game 2 of the finals in 1999 was the other one. A shot that Moore remembered fondly. \n\"I was wrapped up in the moment when T-Spoon hit the halfcourt shot. I was a Comets fan early on and thinking what just happened that was amazing. Not thinking of me in the future. I absolutely remember it and get chills every time I see it,\" Moore said. \"It's an iconic moment.\" \nWatch Moore's AAU championship shot: http://bit.ly/1FY8Kiu \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:53:36.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
