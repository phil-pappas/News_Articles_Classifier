The second, a close-range shot following a tenacious Antoni Sarcevic move, was tipped on to the post.Both sides had chances to snatch it, Murphy testing Maxwell and then smashing the woodwork at one end, David Ball forcing another sharp save from Charles-Cook at the other.And it was the Sky Blues who came up trumps in the last minute of normal time.With Fleetwood flagging, George Thomas found space on the edge of the box. Maxwell saved his effort but the ball rebounded off one-time Coventry defender Wood and into the net.
