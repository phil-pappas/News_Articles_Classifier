Coach David Blatt said James might not play for the remainder of the preseason as the team tries to limit the four-time MVP's minutes going into the Oct. 27 opener at Chicago. \nPACERS: Ian Mahinmi had 16 points and seven rebounds. ... Monta Ellis , a key offseason pickup, added 14 points. ... Rookie Myles Turner scored 11 points off the bench. \nCAVALIERS: Timofey Mozgov led Cleveland with 16 points. ... J.R. Smith scored 10 points after missing three games with a strained hamstring. ... Matthew Dellavedova didn't play because of a sore ankle. \nSTAR WATCH: Kevin Love , who dislocated his left shoulder in the first round of last season's playoffs, could return Sunday in Toronto. \nKEEP ME IN, COACH: Pacers coach Frank Vogel said George has been full-go throughout training camp after missing most of last season with a broken leg. \"I've given him opportunities to take time off and his response is, `I kind of had the whole year off last year. I like being in there,'\" Vogel said. \nUP NEXT: Indiana visits Chicago on Tuesday. Cleveland plays at Toronto on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:51:39.868+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
