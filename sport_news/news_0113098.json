THE CANADIAN PRESS/John Woods THE CANADIAN PRESS RedBlacks WINNIPEG - \nHenry Burris wanted the ball in his own hands. After earlier being knocked out of the game on a late hit, the Ottawa RedBlacks quarterback barrelled into the end zone with 45 seconds left, sinking the Winnipeg Blue Bombers 27-20. \nIt was a huge win for the RedBlacks, who moved into a first-place tie with the Hamilton Tiger Cats. It came right down to the final play. With Winnipeg on the Ottawa 23-yard line, Jovon Johnson knocked down a pass in the end zone. \nAs big as the win was, the RedBlacks were still steamed at a low blow on Burris by defensive lineman Jamaal Westerman with nine seconds left in the first half - after Burris had already delivered a 51-yard touchdown pass to Chris Williams. \nThe RedBlacks felt it was a deliberate attempt to injure. Offensive co-ordinator Jason Maas was held back by offensive line coach Bryan Chiu as he jawed at the officials. After several minutes sitting on the turf, Burris walked off the field and returned to play in the second half. \nThe RedBlacks came out of the first half with a 16-10 lead on the Blue Bombers. At times, the RedBlacks offence was churning up yardage, at times they were sloppy. \nYou look at the stats and, in the first half alone, you see the RedBlacks with 372 yards of offence, Burris passing for 314 yards. Defensively, they had three sacks, two fumble recoveries, a couple of interceptions by Brandyn Thompson. Time of possession favoured Ottawa 20:39-9:21. It doesn't add up. \nOn the first offensive play for the RedBlacks, Burris went over the 60,000-passing-yard mark for his CFL career, finding Williams for 15 yards. But the drive stalled when Burris was picked off by Lin-J Shell. Winnipeg failed to score when Sergio Castillo's 33-yard field goal was wide left. \nRonnie Pfeffer gave Ottawa a 1-0 lead when his 60-yard punt sailed into the end zone. The first Thompson interception set up a 16-yard field goal by Chris Milo, making it 4-0. \nThe RedBlacks, after a 41-yard catch by Brad Sinopoli, coughed up the ball deep in Winnipeg territory when William Powell fumbled after a 12-yard run. Another Thompson interception gave Ottawa the ball back. But the RedBlacks' drive was stopped when Maurice Leggett picked off a Burris pass. The Bombers gave the ball back when Da'Rel Scott fumbled. Ottawa wound up with the ball on the Winnipeg 42. Powell pounded in from the two-yard line and Ottawa had a 10-0 lead after a missed Milo convert. \nThe Bombers got back into the game when Darvin Adams got behind Jerrell Gavins for a 36-yard touchdown. Gavins, who was limping, left the game. The Bombers missed the convert, but Castillo got a single on the kickoff. Winnipeg tied the game on a 42-yard Castillo field goal after Matt Nichols found Cameron Marshall for a 50-yard gain when there was confusion in the Ottawa secondary. Hightower had moved to Gavins' halfback spot and Brandon Sermons was in at safety. \nThe RedBlacks got a 51-yard touchdown catch by Williams with nine seconds left in the half. Burris had to leave the game after being drilled so backup QB Thomas DeMarco came in for the two-point convert attempt, but Powell couldn't hang onto the pass. \nOttawa made it 17-10 on the first drive of second half on a 50-yard punt single by Pfeffer, but Castillo cut it to 17-13 with a 46-yard field goal. The Bombers took a 20-17 lead with a bit more than five minutes left in the third quarter when Nick Moore hauled in a seven-yard touchdown pass. \nNichols left the game with 13:20 left after being hit by Shawn Lemon, but returned on Winnipeg's next series. Milo's 46-yard field goal tied the game 20-20 with 7:01 left.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:11:15.439+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
