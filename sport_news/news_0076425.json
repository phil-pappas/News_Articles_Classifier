Additional assistant referees were introduced to UEFA competitions in 2012 to rule on close goal-line calls and clamp down on penalty-area infringements.\nManagers have been known to question their purpose, but Collina says they play a vital role. \"Have you ever seen a duck on the water, relaxed but paddling like hell under the water?\" said the Italian. \"This is the additional assistant referee.\"\nEuropean governing body UEFA has backed the additional assistant referees as an alternative to goal-line technology, which is now in use in several major European leagues. While goal-line technology has put an end to controversies about whether the ball has crossed the line, Collina says additional assistant referees perform an important role policing penalty areas.\n\"I think there are many incidents occurring inside the penalty area where more control is needed,\" he told reporters. \"You remember what you went through in the Premier League last season in England with all those holdings and pullings at set-pieces on Saturday and Sunday? Never on Tuesday and Wednesday in the Champions League.\n\"If you drive your car and if you see police or a radar, you slow down.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:20:37.074+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
