The Eagles, with a Swiss cheese offensive line and quarterback nearing Cutler-esque levels of visible misery, might be changing the narrative on Chip Kelly’s genius. Then, there’s Colin Kaepernick, who clearly “ain’t Russell Wilson, bro” – and his 49ers certainly aren’t Wilson’s Seahawks.\nBy now, even unflinching optimists understand that these teams won’t be heading to Santa Clara in February.\nBut through four weeks, six teams remain undefeated, and for the most part, it’s pretty apparent why they’ve gotten this far. The Patriots and Packers are quarterbacked by two of the greatest the position has seen. The Broncos have a ruthless defense allowing just 275 yards per game. The Panthers and Falcons have beaten up on struggling divisions. And the Bengals have ... Andy Dalton.\nAnd no, that last one wasn’t a joke.\nThese six have been the class of the NFL so far, and none, at this point, should be discounted as contenders. In its season simulations, FiveThirtyEight.com predicts all six will finish over the 11-win mark and gives each at least an 80 percent chance of making the playoffs. The chance any remains undefeated a month from now, however, is obviously much smaller.\nBut that’s what we’re here to handicap today. Of these six teams, who will still look as untouchable a month from now? From least likely to most, here are my entirely unscientific predictions, now hereby christened as the Undefeated Index:\n6. CAROLINA PANTHERS\nOpening month wins: at Jaguars, vs. Texans, vs. Saints, at Buccaneers\nOn tap: at Seahawks, vs. Eagles, vs. Colts, vs. Packers\nThe Panthers have played a frighteningly easy schedule through one month, and with a murderer’s row on tap through October, it’s not entirely unlikely Carolina is sitting at .500 a month from now. Optimistically, with a middling offense, the Panthers’ chances of making it through unscathed are next to nil.\n5. DENVER BRONCOS\nOpening month wins: vs. Ravens, at Chiefs, at Lions, vs. Vikings\nOn tap: at Raiders, at Browns, vs. Packers, at Colts\nThere’s nothing illegitimate about the Broncos’ defensive dominance thus far. They boast the NFL’s best pass rush, with a league-leading 18 sacks in four games. The problem: The other side of the ball has been almost equally unimpressive , ranking 25th in total offense, despite being helmed by a future Hall of Famer. Peyton Manning has been pedestrian, and the run game has been non-existent. Denver could be a serious Super Bowl contender, but it’ll need to get Manning and the offense back on track first.\n4. GREEN BAY PACKERS\nOpening month wins: at Bears, vs. Seahawks, vs. Chiefs, at 49ers\n1 2 Next Page", "external_links": ["http://fivethirtyeight.com/"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:43:43.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
