Somerset's aptly-named Sally Dart scored 18.79 in a 3-0 whitewash of Wendy Waine. \nThe West Midlands started to take command in the men's 'B' affair, prevailing 8-4 and holding firm after building up a 6-2 lead. \nMatthew Tedstone's 27.83 was the pick of the victor's darts in a 3-0 landslide over Terry Hayes. Craig Paines notched 27.03 beating Jack Routledge (27.04) 3-1 in the last game. \nThe ladies 'A' side then helped them to extend their lead with a 4-2 win, where they took the lead and never looked back. \nLisa Astbury clocked up 21.47 in a 3-0 success over Marie Geaney, while Somerset's Kay Bisset got 20.63 in downing Katherine Jenkins (19.59) 3-1. \nThe West Midlands closed out their dominance in the men's 'A' match where they, again, never relinquished the lead after striking first blood. \nOpener and country stalwart Ian 'Whippet' Jones gleaned from a 4-1 victory over Matt Williams, but Micky Baker's 29.43 wasn't enough to prevent a 4-2 defeat to name-sake Dean Baker (28.95).
