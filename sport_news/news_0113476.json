Andhra's Ricky Bhui, who endured a poor Under-19 World Cup a couple of years ago in UAE (15 runs in four games), celebrated turning 19 a couple of days back with a fighting, unfinished 91 (183b, 12x4, 2x6) to mark his arrival on the First Class stage with his best score at this level.\nWalking in with Andhra in some trouble after losing their openers for merely 18, on a lively wicket, Bhui had to face not only a barrage of short stuff from seamer Shardul Thakur, but also some sledging from the Mumbai players. Guided constantly by his skipper Mohammad Kaif, who stood firm at the other end with a composed, unbeaten 66 (235b, 9x4, 1x6), the young turk, however, coped well with both, grinding it out against the pacers before rewarding himself for showing patience by smashing a couple of sixes off left-arm spinner Vishal Dabholkar, when the pitch had eased out. The duo have so far added 152 for the third wicket in a partnership which threatens to swell the score much beyond 170 for two -the hosts' score at stumps on Day 1.\nA sharp shower, which cut down the day's play by half-an-hour before close, would've given Mumbai's bowlers enough time to reflect on a forgettable day, where they failed to take a single wicket for 394 balls. Though both the Andhra batsmen did well to dig in, the visitors would blame themselves for not sticking to a line and length which would've served them well on this wicket. Mumbai bowled too short and away from the stumps to make the opposition's job easier.\nHis bowlers' lacklusture show didn't exactly please new Mumbai coach Chandrakant Pandit. \"We could've been much better. We could have probably bowled them out. There was something in the pitch initially, and we won the toss too. I'm not exactly disappointed, though. The positive way to look at is that they haven't scored too many runs, so we have enough time to come back,\" Pandit said.
