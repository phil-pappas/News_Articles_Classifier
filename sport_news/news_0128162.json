On Sunday night against the Cowboys , Brees tossed his 400th touchdown.\nAnd it came in spectacular fashion, as Brees connected with C.J. Spiller on the second play of overtime to win the game for the Saints just moments after they missed a field goal at the end of regulation.\nThis is what a 80-yard, overtime, walk-off TD for your 400th career TD pass looks like. Take a bow, Drew #DALvsNO http://t.co/ekVfR85IH3 \nâ€” NFL (@NFL) October 5, 2015 In the first quarter, Brees, dealing with a shoulder injury, found Josh Hill on a 3-yard pass to get touchdown No. 399. The touchdown also gave Brees the 5,000th completion of his career, good enough for the third most in the history of the league.\nIt took longer for Brees to nab touchdown No. 400. But in overtime, a 20-yard pass to Spiller turned into a game-winning, 80-yard touchdown.\n\nDrew Brees became the fifth quarterback to reach 400 touchdown passes. (USATSI) \nTopics: C.J.
