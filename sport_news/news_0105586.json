I just have to be cautious until I can get back to 100 percent.”\nBut after having multiple days of partial practice this week — including not even being listed on the injury report Tuesday — Bargnani seemed to have a setback Saturday, going from participating in some of Friday’s practice to none of Saturday’s, and now seems certain to miss the final two preseason games for the Nets — Sunday against the 76ers in Brooklyn and Monday against the Celtics in Boston.\nWith the regular season opener now less than two weeks away, it’s becoming a question of whether Bargnani will be available when the Nets open their season against the Bulls in Brooklyn on Oct. 28.\nIt’s becoming an almost identical script for the 7-foot Italian to what happened last season with the Knicks, when after injuring his right hamstring in the first preseason game he missed 49 of the first 51 regular-season games because of a combination of hamstring and calf injuries.\nBargnani is one of three injured bigs for the Nets. Willie Reed is out for the next 6-to-8 weeks because of surgery to repair the ulnar collateral ligament in his right thumb Friday, and Chris McCullough is indefinitely sidelined because of ongoing rehab from surgery to repair a torn ACL in his right knee back in February while still at Syracuse.\nThose injuries leave the Nets with three healthy bigs — Brook Lopez, Thaddeus Young and Thomas Robinson — among players projected to make the opening night roster.\nThough the news on Bargnani wasn’t good, the Nets got a better report on Donald Sloan, who went from partial participation Friday with a sore hamstring to full participation Saturday, putting him on course to potentially return to the court Sunday against Philadealphia.\nRookie Rondae Hollis-Jefferson also participated fully in Saturday’s practice, the second straight day he’d done so, and also has a good chance of being available Sunday.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under andrea bargnani ,  brooklyn nets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:52:29.755+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
