Running backs Julian Franklin and Taye Davis, prior to his own small leg ding, had the majority of the Governors’ carries. \n\"I think I responded good,\" said Franklin. \"My last few games I got no carries, so it was a challenge coming in ... I always stay focused, I always go hard in practice because I know I will get an opportunity, and I've got to take advantage of it.\" \nFranklin led the team with 102 rushing yards and a touchdown. \nJust under two minutes into the game, the Skyhawks scored on a Jarod Neal to Caylon Weathers 22-yard pass. Trent Garland found the end zone with 7:25 on the clock to put UTM at 14-0. \nNear the end of the first quarter, Austin Peay was right within scoring range. UT Martin’s defense held strong and forced the Govs to try a field goal. \nLogan Birchfield’s attempt was blocked and then returned for an 84-yard touchdown by Jordan Landry as time ran out. \nAPSU was able to final earn a touchdown in the second quarter when Franklin rushed for 37 yards to give the Governors their only score of the first half. What little gap that had been closed was flung wide open after Jackson Redditt nailed a 32-yard field goal and Garland ran in his second touchdown of the night for UTM’s 31-7 lead at halftime. \n\"I think sometimes when you make some mistakes there is an easing into a game,\" said third-year coach Kirby Cannon. \"Plus if they hit a play early then sometimes it makes everyone question what they are doing just for a moment or two.\" \nThis was the fourth-straight game that the Governors were down by more than 20 points at the half. Last week’s loss to Murray State had the highest point differential with 25 points. \nIn the third quarter, UT Martin’s machine of an offense slowed to a puttering rate with a failed PAT from Redditt and a called-back touchdown pass after a pass interference was called on the offense. Redditt followed the called-back touchdown with a field goal to give UTM the 34-7 lead. \nAPSU found the end zone again after a quarterback change brought in Timarious Mitchell, who connected with Jared Beard for the 20-yard score. UTM would extend its lead once again on another Redditt field goal followed by a Jaimiee Bowe 17-yard run touchdown to give the final of 44-14. \nSaturday's win secured the Sgt. York Trophy, which goes to the Tennessee college in the OVC with the best record against the other OVC teams in the state, for UT Martin. \nThe Governors' next game will be the Homecoming game against Jacksonville State on Oct. 24 at 4 p.m. \nReach Autumn Allison at aallison@theleafchronicle.com or (931) 245-0248.
