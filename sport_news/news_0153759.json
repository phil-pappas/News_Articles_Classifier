However, Kaepernick was quick to squash any rumblings about his position.\nAdChoices \"I don't play for job security,\" Kaepernick said, via ESPN.com . \"Whether football is here or not, I will be fine. I go out, I play to win. I'm not worried about job security when I step in this building.\"\nMORE: Jennifer's 8: Clay Matthews checks Kaep | Week 5 picks straight up\nFor Kaepernick to get back in the good graces of 49ers fans, that means he needs to step it up. In his last two games, he has only completed 22 of 44 passes, no touchdowns and has had five interceptions, two of which were returned for touchdowns.\nAccording to head coach Jim Tomsula, he had a sit down with Kaepernick and told him to stop second-guessing himself.\n\"If you are, stop,\" Tomsula said he told Kaepernick. \"Can't have it. Can't play that way. Don't play not to make a mistake; Just play. Play to make the play.\"\nNow the 49ers will face the Giants Sunday, and neither quarterback nor coach wants to be in the position they have been in the past three games.\n\"Just play to win,\" Kaepernick recalled of Tomsula's advice. \"If something happens, it happens. But we have to go out and make sure we're making plays.\n\"It's something that you're going to have that in the back of your mind. You're going to make sure that you protect the football. I put our team in a bad situation in the Arizona game. I wasn't going to allow that to happen again.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13831809/colin-kaepernick-san-francisco-49ers-play-job-security", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657457-nfl-week-5-picks-predictions-patriots-cowboys-seahawks-bengals-redskins-falcons", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657365-nfl-week-5-clay-matthews-kaepernick-49ers-woes-joe-philbin-chip-kelly-todd-gurley-rams"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T15:49:05.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
