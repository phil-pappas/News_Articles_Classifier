(AP) - In a game with no touchdowns, a telling statistic was the number of snaps logged by Missouri's defense.\nMissouri's defense, on the field for 77 plays, played tough before finally yielding the lead with less than 2 minutes remaining in a 9-6 loss to Georgia on Saturday night.\nGeorgia's Marshall Morgan, who missed from 26 yards about 4 minutes earlier, kicked a 34-yard field goal with 1:44 remaining to give the Bulldogs their first lead.\nGeorgia held the ball almost twice as long as Missouri â€” almost 39 minutes to 21 minutes. Georgia's defense had to log only 48 plays.\nAn 18-yard punt return by Terry Godwin to midfield set up the modest seven-play, 33-yard drive for Morgan's go-ahead field goal.\n\"We were tired,\" said Missouri coach Gary Pinkel. \"Most of our players on the punt team are defensive players. They're going out there and they're getting tired, and (Georgia) did a good job on returning, too.\"\nIt was Georgia's first win without scoring a touchdown since a 12-3 victory over Kentucky in 1995.\nGeorgia (5-2, 3-2 Southeastern Conference) snapped a two-game losing streak by holding Missouri (4-3, 1-3) to six first downs and 164 total yards. Missouri has lost two straight.\nFreshman Drew Lock completed only 11 of 26 passes for 143 yards with no interceptions in his third start for Missouri following the suspension of Maty Mauk.\nRussell Hansbrough had 11 carries for only 24 yards. The Tigers were held to 21 net yards rushing.\n\"It was a night of defenses,\" Pinkel said. \"... Those are difficult losses, as we continue to struggle on offense.\"\nLock said being unable to score a touchdown when taking possession at the Georgia 1 early in the game was difficult to put out of his mind.\n\"You want to say that it doesn't, but it's probably there half of the time in the back of your head before you go out for the next play,\" Lock said.\nThe Tigers showed why they lead the SEC in pass defense and scoring defense. They had allowed an average of only 13.5 points per game before frustrating quarterback Greyson Lambert and the Bulldogs.\nLambert completed 23 of 32 passes for 178 yards. He suffered a rough start when his first pass was deflected by linebacker Michael Scherer and intercepted by Ian Simon, whose 39-yard return to the Georgia 1 set up a 20-yard field goal by Andrew Baggett.\nGeorgia held the Tigers to a field goal, setting the trend for its strong red-zone defense in the game. Missouri was held to two field goals on three red-zone possessions.\n\"Our offense just has to get rolling,\" said Missouri center Even Boehm. \"We have to pick up our confidence and pick up somewhere and start rolling.\"\nThe win allowed Georgia to protect its hopes of catching SEC East leader Florida, which lost to LSU 35-28. Following an off week, Georgia plays Florida on Oct. 31 in Jacksonville, Florida.\nGeorgia's Sony Michel had 26 carries for 87 yards rushing while taking over as the starter following star tailback Nick Chubb's season-ending knee injury.\nChubb, accompanied by former star tailback Todd Gurley, now with the NFL St. Louis Rams, walked to the Georgia sideline on crutches and sat on a trainer's table during the game. The Rams have a bye week.\nGeorgia safety Dominick Sanders was ejected for targeting on his hit on Emanuel Hall in the third quarter. The call was confirmed following a quick review by the officials.\nAn apparent interception by Missouri safety Anthony Sherrils was overturned by a review as officials determined the ball hit the ground. The call set up a tying 24-yard field goal by Morgan late in the third quarter.\nMorgan was wide left on a 26-yard field goal with 5:40 remaining.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
