(CBS12) - Suncoast's Matt Dame threw a touchdown pass with four seconds left to lead the chargers to a four point win Friday night, clinching the school's first district title since 2002. It could've been the highlight of most young football player's lives, but the CBS12 Athlete of the Week, has his eyes set on success way beyond football.\"Everyone came up to us, and congratulate us, people I didn't even know,\" remarks Dame, a few days after the big win over Ft. Pierce Westwood. The year after going winless, Dame's Suncoast Chargers are undefeated in district and champs for the first time in 13 years. Dame threw for 389 yards and three TDs in the win.Dame admits coming into his senior season, players from other high school teams tried to convince him to transfer away from Suncoast. But Dame wasn't going anywhere. \"Suncoast is my home. I wasn't going to leave my teammates.\"The education was a big deal too, Suncoast is perennially ranked among the best public high schools in the country. And academics mean a lot to Dame - he's committed to play football at Columbia and will major in business. \"I had major BCS programs looking at me, but I knew I had to look at the 40 year decision and not the 4 year.\" And it was his time at Suncoast that helped him prove that was the right decision. \"I originally wanted to go to Florida and play in front of 90,000 people, but you've got to do what can sustain you for life, because football can end for all of us.\"But it won't end for Dame, and the Chargers in Week 11, as he hopes to have a long playoff run in his last year at Suncoast.
