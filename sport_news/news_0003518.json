Chris Godwin had four catches for 135 yards and DaeSean Hamilton totaled 96 yards on five receptions.\nPenn State (6-2, 3-1) improved to 36-2-1 against the Terps.\nLocksley was promoted from offensive coordinator after head coach Randy Edsall was fired on Oct. 11.\nMaryland (2-5, 0-3) played well but was undone by five turnovers, including three interceptions by Perry Hills.\nHills ran for 128 yards and completed 19 of 28 passes for 225 yards. His final interception came on a deflected pass with 1:15 remaining.\nPenn State went up 31-27 with 13:39 left when Hackenberg tossed a 27-yard touchdown pass to Geno Lewis.\nMaryland cut the gap with a field goal, then recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff. But Hills fumbled it back as he was hit while throwing.\nThe Terrapins got the ball after a missed field-goal attempt. Locksley opted to go for it on fourth-and-2 from the Maryland 36, and Hills was intercepted by Trevor Williams with 7:51 to go.\nWisconsin 24, Illinois 13: Bart Houston came off the bench to throw for 232 yards and two touchdowns as Wisconsin (6-2, 3-1) beat host Illinois (4-3, 1-2).\nWisconsin starting quarterback Joel Stave left the game late in the first quarter because of a head injury. But the Badgers didn’t miss a beat behind Houston.\nThe junior found Alex Erickson for a 9-yard touchdown with 9:42 left in the game to give Wisconsin a 24-13 lead and effectively put the game away.\nErickson led the Badgers in receiving with 10 catches for 96 yards and had four rushes for 81 yards.\nNorthwestern 30, Nebraska 28: Clayton Thorson’s 37-yard touchdown pass to Dan Vitale and Jack Mitchell’s third field goal gave Northwestern (6-2, 2-2) an eight-point lead in the fourth quarter, and the Wildcats hung on to beat host Nebraska (3-5, 1-3).\nMitchell’s 27-yard field goal put Northwestern up 30-22, but the Huskers drove 75 yards in eight plays to trail by two points. But Tommy Armstrong’s two-point pass to Stanley Morgan Jr. fell incomplete, and Northwestern’s offense was able to run out the final 4:18.\nThorson passed for 177 yards and ran for a career-high 126, with 117 coming on two carries.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:18:03.964+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
