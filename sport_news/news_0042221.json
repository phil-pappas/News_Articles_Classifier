Then they finally got to see the side with swagger and skill honed from two Texas high school state titles at Denton Guyer, the guy who gave life to an offense and may have solved a lingering quarterback problem.\nAll it took was the bright lights of Royal-Memorial Stadium and the first start of his career for the game-day Heard to appear. He finished with 216 yards total offense and two long touchdown passes in a 42-28 win over Rice.\n“It’s almost like, ‘OK, the lights are brighter, so I’m going to go shine. Everybody’s going to watch me shine,’” coach Charlie Strong said.\nUnlike predecessor Tyrone Swoopes, who always seemed a little uncomfortable in the spotlight, the redshirt freshman left no doubt that he would love to be Texas’ quarterback for this season and three more.\n“I definitely want it to be my job,” Heard said.\nTo keep it, he’ll have to be even better this Saturday against a solid Pac-12 team in Cal, one that will test the Texas offense. The Bears will study film of Heard and try to make a guy with an iffy arm throw more than seven times.\n“They definitely want to challenge me,” Heard said. “Just like Rice, they blitzed more than they did any other team.”\nHeard looks, sounds and acts like a quarterback — including the moment when he dropped after being stopped on a long run and did push-ups as penance for not beating the tackler. Because he looked so at home, some wondered why it took so long for him to start.\nSwoopes was always presumed to be the starter during what was billed as a competition, at least until the 38-3 loss to Notre Dame forced changes.\nJefferson suggested after the Rice game that Heard had been released from a personal prison.\nHeard didn’t miss a beat when asked about the Quote: .\n“Yes, aka redshirt year, I guess,” Heard said. “A lot of people say I was freed. It was just a process of making sure I was ready to be out on the field.”\nHeard said he got a fair shake, although he admits it was difficult watching from the sidelines last season. He is a different player in practice, he said.\n“I have my ears back,” Heard said. “I'm not saying I’m taking it slow, but I’m making sure I’m trying to perfect everything in practice. I want to do that in the game where I’m reacting and going fast.”\nEven before his college debut, Heard didn’t lack confidence. He bounced over to Strong and told him, “Watch me go out there and get these boys.”\nStrong’s response: “We’ll see.”\nThen he saw a different player than he had previously.\n“Charlie is right,” Heard said. “When the lights are on, definitely time for me to go.”\nHeard's highlights Breaking down Jerrod Heard's first college start against Rice:\nTwo touchdown passes, including one of 69 yards to John Burt. It was the fifth-longest TD pass by a Texas freshman.\nRushed for a team-high 96 yards on 10 carries, including 35 yards on Texas' first series.\nFour carries of at least 11 yards.\nFollow Chuck Carlton on Twitter at @ChuckCarltonDMN .\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN", "https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-09-15T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:24:15.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
