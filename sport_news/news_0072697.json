Second base ump Marvin Hudson called Odor safe, but the Jays thought otherwise. One replay angle appeared to show that Odor’s foot momentarily came off the bag with Tulowitzki applying the tag. \nThere was not enough video evidence for officials in New York, however, to reverse the call and the original safe call was upheld. \nShortly after, the Rangers scored two go-ahead runs and now the Jays season hangs by a thread. \nTulowitzki offered little in the way of insight. \n“Obviously, it was a big play,” he said. “Initially, I wasn’t quite sure and I didn’t get a chance to look at the replay. I’m sure you guys did. You guys know as good as me.” \nThat wasn’t the response everybody was looking for. \n“I think any time in today’s game with the replay, any time there’s a close play, you always try to keep the tag on,” Tulowitzki added. “That’s what I was doing there. Apparently, Gibby called and it was close enough to review and, unfortunately, it didn’t go our way.” \nNot on that play, not in the first two games. \nCola's defence stemmed the tide \nChris Colabello isn’t a fireman, but on Friday, he put out a raging inferno in the first inning with his heady play to help keep his team in the game. \nIn a game where the Jays would eventually lose 6-4 in 14 innings, Colabello put the brakes on the opening inning when it looked as if the Rangers were preparing to hang an ugly number around the Jays’ necks. \nWith two runs in, two out and runners on second and third, the Rangers were one hit away from busting the game wide open right out of the gate. \nJosh Hamilton hit a grounder that Colabello fielded at first and he alertly turned it into an unusual double play as he tagged Hamilton going down the line then sprinted across the field to tag Fielder, who was trapped on the third-base line. Double play, end of inning. \n“Obviously at any point in time, we’re trying to make a play,” Colabello said describing the play. “I knew (Prince) Fielder was at third. If the ball was hit average-to-above average, I was going to have a chance at home. As soon as I came up, I looked at him right away and was able to freeze him. I wanted to keep him in front of me, so the whole time I was moving forward to try and tag Hamilton, but I think at that point in time the priority was to keep the runner from scoring, so we were able to get two on it.” \nTurns out it wasn’t the first time he’s made that play. He said he pulled it off in spring training when he was with the Minnesota Twins in 2012. \nPrior to Colabello, the Jays didn’t make any of the defensive plays they needed in the inning, including a throwing error by Russell Martin on a rundown that allowed a run to score. \n“Just weird moments in the game,” Colabello said of the Jays’ twitchy play at times in the opening two games. “You get weird bounces in baseball sometimes. You hope to not have them happen in a game like this, but everybody’s high energy, emotional, you want to do something to help the team and it’s not for lack of effort, that’s for sure.” \nColabello, like his teammates, isn’t prepared to throw in the towel despite the hole the Jays find themselves in. \n“We’ve won three in a row a whole bunch of times this year,” he said. “At this point, you either win or you go home. I don’t think that any of us are ready to go home yet.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:01:00.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
