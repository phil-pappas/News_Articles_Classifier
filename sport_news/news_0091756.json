The demands of playing Thursday games rubs some players the wrong way, including Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman who told reporters this week that he feels the mid-week game endangers players.\"I mean, it's rough,\" Sherman said. \"It's rough on the body. Any time you play a football game and play another one a few days later, it's going to be tough on the body. But it's just another one of those things. Another one of those simple contradictions of the league, because they care about us.\"The quick turnaround may be physically demanding, but Seattle coach Pete Carroll said on Wednesday that getting back on the field quickly could actually be beneficial for his squad as they try and correct the mistakes that have led to the lackluster 2-4 start. Regardless, the way Seattle's players respond to playing on short rest is a key factor to keep an eye on come gametime.

Photo-8829453.119133   6 Breaking out the Beast Running back Marshawn Lynch has yet to put together a complete performance this season, missing two games with a hamstring injury and averaging just 3.3 yards per carry in the games he has played. In other words, he has yet to find the form that has made him such a game-altering force over the course of his Seahawks career.Look for Seattle to try and change that on Sunday. Lynch has gashed the 49ers for 882 yards and six touchdowns in 10 games since 2008 and averages a healthy 4.5 yards per carry against Seattle's West Coast rivals. The Seahawks need Lynch to get going to reestablish what has been an uneven offense so far in 2015 and help open up the passing game.If Beast Mode's history is any indication, the matchup with San Francisco should give him a chance to do exactly that.

Seattle's four losses all share one glaring similarity: They held leads in the fourth quarter of all of them before self-destructing late and giving away the victories. Neither side of the ball is exempt from responsibility for the problem. The offense has been listless late in games when they need to milk the clock and protect a lead, while the defense has been similarly ineffective when it needs late stops, allowing teams to march down the field virtually uninhibited with startling regularity.It's an unfamiliar trend that simply needs to change if Seattle wants to make the playoffs, let alone contend for a third consecutive Super Bowl appearance. If Seattle can see Thursday's game through and keep themselves from unraveling late, it could end up being a necessary psychological step for the team to get back to its old winning ways.Until they correct the struggles with putting opponents away, expect this to be one of the biggest storylines following the Seahawks on a weekly basis.

After establishing itself as a perennial contender under former head coach Jim Harbaugh, San Francisco was widely expected to take a major step back this season following an absolutely brutal offseason that saw them lose a plethora of key contributors, including All-Pro linebacker Patrick Willis, running back Frank Gore and linebacker Chris Borland, among others.This sounds like a recipe for a favorable matchup for the Seahawks. But it also could have the makings of a classic \"trap game\" if Seattle isn't careful. After a rough start to the season, San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick has been hot the last two weeks, throwing for over 600 yards, four touchdowns, no interceptions and a blistering passer rating of 116.5. The 49ers could very well be too depleted to factor into the playoff race this year, but Seattle can't afford to take them lightly, with a 2-5 start staring them squarely in the face heading into Thursday.

Photo-8829451.119133   6 Fast start could be imperative A quick start for Seattle could go a long way in setting them up for victory on Thursday.In San Francisco's four losses this season, they have struggled out of the gates and have been outscored by a whopping 80-19 margin in the first half, including a 32-3 mark in the first quarter. In their two wins, however, San Francisco is outscoring their opponents 23-6.If the Seahawks can jump out to the early lead and snuff San Francisco out early, it could open the floodgates for a smooth victory. But if Seattle get off to a sluggish start and let the 49ers hang around into the second half, things could suddenly become much more interesting.

Photo-8829452.119133   6 Recapturing old spark San Francisco and Seattle had emerged as one of the most intriguing rivalries in the NFL in the past few seasons, after many high-stakes inter-division matchups and a legendary 2013 NFC championship game that ended with Richard Sherman's now-iconic tip on Michael Crabtree that led to Malcolm Smith's game-clinching interception.But headed into Thursday, the matchup just doesn't carry the same luster that it used to. Harbaugh is gone. The 49ers don't have the same type of talent they once did. And the Seahawks haven't held up their end of the bargain either so far this year, as they have floundered in the early going. But now, with both squads' backs up against the wall by Week 7, each side suddenly has everything to play for.Don't expect Thursday's game to be the clash of NFL juggernauts that it once was. However, a rivalry game is still a rivalry game, and it will be interesting to see if the teams can recapture the spark that once made this one of the game's premier battles.
