The rally followed a batch of encouraging earnings from McDonald's, eBay and other companies. Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon also delivered better-than-expected results shortly after the close of regular trading. The Dow climbed 320.55 points to 17,489.16. The S&P 500 index rose 33.57 points to 2,052.51. The last time the Dow and S&P 500 delivered bigger single-day gains was Oct. 5. The Nasdaq added 79.93 points to 4,920.05. In energy futures trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 18 cents to $45.38 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, used to price international oils, added 23 cents to $48.08 a barrel in London. Benetton, the Italian maker of colorful knitwear, is relaunching its brand with a gentler ad campaign. The new approach ditches shock factor images such as the pope kissing an imam, which once angered the Vatican. Ten victims of disgraced Subway pitchman Jared Fogle have received $100,000 each in restitution. Four other victims are expected to get their checks in the next month. Fogle is expected to plead guilty to distribution and receipt of child pornography and traveling to engage in illicit sexual conduct with a minor. Â© 2015 Associated Press. All rights reserved.
