Fellow senior Brett Izzo (15:43.6) was sixth for East. \n\"We had four up there pretty much the whole way, for 2 1/2 miles, at least,\" Saints coach Chris Bosworth said. \"We've had a pretty good pack pretty much all year.\" \nThis particular triumph was all the sweeter given East's familiarity – or lack thereof – with the host venue. \n\"To be honest, the last time I was there was maybe my first year at St. Charles (2009),\" Bosworth said. \"It had been a long time. I know the course, but none of my kids, the seniors, had run on that course. This was their first time.\" \nGeneva junior Tyler Dau won the race in 15:26.5. \nShea Bastian (fifth, 15:33.3) paced Batavia to a third-place team finish.
