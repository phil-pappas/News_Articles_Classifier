Ravell Call, Enlarge photo» Summary \nUtah State men’s basketball has been selected third in the annual preseason Mountain West men’s basketball poll, as announced by the conference offices on Tuesday morning. \nLAS VEGAS — Utah State men’s basketball has been selected third in the annual preseason Mountain West men’s basketball poll, as announced by the conference offices on Tuesday morning. The prediction is the highest for the Aggies since joining the Mountain West and highest since USU was selected to win the Western Athletic Conference in its final season in the league during the 2012-13 season. \n“We’ve got five starters returning and experience means a lot and will always mean a lot in college basketball,” head coach Tim Duryea said of the Aggies ’ spot in the poll. “It is a great place to start.” \nDefending champion San Diego State was selected first in the poll, receiving 22 of 25 first-place votes and 272 points. Boise State followed in second place with a pair of first-place votes and 234 points. Utah State was third with 190, UNLV in fourth with 185 and Fresno State in fifth with 182 points and the final first-place vote. \n“The Mountain West has gone through San Diego State for quite a while and will continue to do so until someone proves otherwise,” Duryea said. “Boise had a great year last year and has three really good players returning. It is no surprise that people hold them in high regard.” \nNew Mexico (164) and Colorado State (144) were selected sixth and seventh, with Wyoming (101), Nevada (97), Air Force (51) and San José State (30) rounding out the poll in eighth through 11th. \nUtah State was without a player on the preseason all-Mountain West team, made up of Fresno State senior guard Marvelle Harris, Boise State redshirt senior guard Anthony Drmic, Boise State junior forward James Webb III, Wyoming senior guard Josh Adams and San Diego State senior forward Winston Shepard. Harris was also picked as the preseason Player of the Year. \nNew Mexico junior forward Tim Williams and UNLV freshman Stephen Zimmerman rounded out the preseason honors as Newcomer and Freshman of the Year, respectively. \nUtah State returns all five starters from a team that went 18-13 in 2014-15, including an 11-7 mark in the Mountain West. The 11 victories are the most by any second-year program in league history. Returners include all three of Utah State’s all-conference performers in junior wing Jalen Moore (second team), sophomore forward David Collette (third team) and senior guard Chris Smith (honorable mention). Senior guard Darius Perkins and sophomore guard Julion Pearre round out the returning starting five for Utah State. \n2015-16 Mountain West Preseason Poll \n1. San Diego State 272 (22) 2.
