I’m sure I’ll look back later and appreciate it even more.” \nEven with his play and stats speaking so loud, it’s his quiet demeanor that speaks louder and has had virtually every major college recruiter knocking on his door for the past two years. \nMost college coaches only stick around for a half during games. But several, including Auburn head coach Gus Malzahn, who was at City Park last week checking out Brown during the Longhorns’ 16-8 win over Gainesville, have hung around for the full four quarters just to see what Brown will come up with next \n“We’ve had several coaches come and talk to him for an hour and stay whole games. That’s unusual for head coaches to stay that long. But I think it speaks to what they see in Derrick and the kind of guy (Derrick) is,” Mobbs said. \nDespite his larger-than-life play, Brown -- considered the state of Georgia’s top recruit by several recruiting experts -- assumes a far more unassuming persona off the field. He attributes that to his parents, James and Martha Brown. \n“My parents have helped me a lot in this process, and really I have just tried to enjoy it and be respectful, which is something my parents taught me,” Brown said. “It’s nice to get the attention but I wouldn’t be here without the coaches and my teammates.” \nThe recruiting process can be physically and mentally exhausting for players and their families. And each year many high-profile recruits opt for an early collegiate decision -- to get things over with and focus on their final prep campaign. A few even wilt under the weight of the decision. \nBrown has taken a different approach. \n“I want to be a part of the recruiting process. It’s kind of fun,” he said. “I never planned on making a decision until probably the day before (National Signing Day). I’m going to take all my official visits but I’m not going to any of those until after the season is over.” \nBrown would not say what his top schools are but said he had narrowed it down to seven, all in the Southeastern Conference (listed in alphabetical order): Alabama, Auburn, Georgia, LSU, Mississippi, Mississippi State, and Tennessee. \n“I want to play in the SEC,” is all he would admit to. “I don’t know that I’m leaning in any direction right now. I’m going to wait until after I take my visits.” \nHow hard has it been for an 18-year-old to stay focused and grounded when the world seems to be at your feet? \n“Really it hasn’t been that difficult because my parents are helping me with things about recruiting and deciding what schools might be best and they also help keep me focused on what I need to do,” Brown said. “It might be a little harder if they weren’t involved but that’s not what I want.” \nMobbs said the maturation of Brown was seen by coaches early on when he entered the program. But Mobbs also said that Brown has never let early expectations stunt his desire to improve and help his team win -- or change that easy-going personality. \n“It’s hard to be humble in the sports world when everyone is telling you from the time you’re in the seventh or eighth grade how good you are,” Mobbs said. “But I think Derrick has handled things about as well as any 18-year-old can at that age. He is learning some great lessons along the way that I think will just make him an even better person.” \nOne key lesson that both Mobbs and Brown said has been invaluable has been the decision to say, \"no.\" \n“That’s a tough word for all of us sometimes. You don’t want to feel like you’re letting anyone down,” Mobbs said. “But in recruiting if you aren’t considering a program I feel you owe it to them to be honest because it’s their job and that way they can move on to other recruits. Derrick has learned to do that and be respectful at the same time.” \nBrown admitted that was tough at first but then realized that in the end, there can only be one. \n“I knew the kind of places where I wanted to go if I had the chance so my parents helped me at first,” he said. “They wanted to be a part of the process to help me and they have been a huge help. I know eventually I’ll have to make that final decision but right now I’m just trying to enjoy things. I still have time to make up my mind.” \nThrough it all, Brown said the one thing that has always been there to help keep him motivated has been his teammates. While not the most outspoken of leaders he has taken a more proactive and vocal role his final year, especially after his best friend and team captain, running back Ashton Barnes, went down with a season-ending knee injury. \n“That was tough because we have played together a long time and to see my best friend not be able to be on the field with us was tough,” Brown said. “But we decided to work harder and play for him, and I don’t want to let him or my team down.” \nAnd he has yet to disappoint. \n“I know sometimes they look at me to make something happen and I enjoy trying to make a play and do what I can to help us get a win,” he said. \nLike last week. The Longhorns were clinging to a slim lead when Brown, who had been close several times earlier in the game, bull-rushed a pair Gainesville blockers as the only rusher on a routine punt and managed to block the kick with one arm and then scoop the ball for a return deep in Gainesville territory, which helped set up the decisive score. \n“I had been close a couple of times so I just decided to try and go through the guys blocking me and I was able to get a hand on it,” he said. “It was a big play and we needed one to kind of get us going. I like being a spark for us if I can.” \nMobbs just smiled and slowly shook his head when reliving the play. \n“I don’t know how, but a guy that big is not supposed to be able to make a play like that,” Mobbs said. “That was one of those ‘Wow!’ plays for me. He seems to come up with one every game to help us get a win. \n“They say you can’t give a Player of the Year award to a defensive player but I think Derrick is a guy that should definitely be considered. He does so much and makes the other guys around him better. I just know that he is one of those guys you want to come and see play to see what he is going to do next.” \nWith the way he and his teammates have been playing, there are likely to be plenty more occasions for high school fans to do just that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:56:17.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
