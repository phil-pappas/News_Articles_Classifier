Eric Gordon added 22 points, including two late free throws. \nGerald Green scored 24 for the Heat, and Chris Bosh had 19. \nPelicans: New Orleans played without six injured players -- centers Omer Asik and Alexis Ajinca, guards Tyreke Evans and Norris Cole and forwards Quincy Pondexter and Luke Babbitt. \nHeat: Dwyane Wade had 11 points but hit only 3 of 13 shots, finishing the preseason shooting 35.8 percent. . Green, playing for his eighth NBA team, averaged a Heat-best 17.8 points in the preseason. \nFined: The NBA fined Green $25,000 for making finger guns and throat-slash gestures against the Washington Wizards Wednesday night. Said coach Erik Spoelstra: \"He accepts the responsibility of it and we'll have to move on. The league has a very clear stance on it.\" \nUp next: The Heat begin the regular season on Wednesday at home against Charlotte. The Pelicans start Tuesday at defending champion Golden State, which swept them in the first round of the Western Conference playoffs. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:24:31.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
