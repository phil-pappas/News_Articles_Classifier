Chris Hays, The Prospector: Dad is famous, but Rayshad Lewis wants to make name for himself \nMost people don’t realize that Bishop Moore cornerback Rayshad Lewis has a famous dad. \nThat’s the way he likes it. \nHe’s proud of his father, of course. He’d love to have the sort of career his father did. Who wouldn’t if his father was an imminent Pro Football Hall of Famer? \nLewis, however, wants to earn what he gets on his own. He doesn’t want to be handed anything just because his dad was a superstar. \nThat, probably more than anything, is what impresses most people who meet the middle son of Ray Lewis. Yes, that Ray Lewis. The former Miami Hurricanes All-American, Baltimore Ravens All-Pro and Super Bowl MVP. \nPhoto Gallery: Rayshad Lewis, Bishop Moore (Chris Hays) \nTheir personalities are quite different. Rayshad Lewis isn’t much like his father in many ways. \nRay Lewis played linebacker in the NFL at 6-foot-1, 240 pounds, retiring after 17 seasons and helping Baltimore hoist the 2012 season’s Lombardi Trophy after also winning the 2000 season’s Super Bowl. \nRayshad Lewis plays cornerback, and he is nowhere close to his father’s size at 5-foot-10, 165 pounds. \nRay Lewis can be scary. Ask any quarterback he played against. \nRayshad is not ferocious or intimidating. Actually, he’s quite the opposite. He’s Mr. Nice Guy, but don’t let that fool you on the football field or you will pay for the misconception. \nBraggadocio is part of the Ray Lewis mystique. \nRayshad Lewis is humble and selfless. \nBishop Moore head coach Matt Hedrick sees that every day. \n“He is unusual because he is exactly the opposite of what you might think you would get. He is completely not entitled,” Hedrick said. “He actually elevates everyone around him as far as his attitude and effort. \n“You would think with someone who has had the life that he’s had in terms of his background with his father’s success, you might think he’d have a sense of, ‘Look at me and this is what I should have,’ but he’s exactly the opposite.” \nThere is, however, one trait father and son share. \nDetermination. Rayshad Lewis is as determined as anyone, and he works hard to get where he wants to be, just like his father did since he was a young star at Lakeland Kathleen High. \nThey both have proven they are intense competitors and incredibly hard workers. \n“Rayshad learned at an early age how to really compete as an athlete, and he kind of has that motto, and I’ve heard him say it before, that he takes great pride in never being out-worked on the field,” Hedrick said. “He’s just really a hard worker who feels like his leg up — his edge — is to compete really hard and outwork people. \n“He’s one of those guys who finds a way to do that even in practice, which is really unusual for a high school kid … to really sell out in practice on a daily basis and not allow himself to coast or take a break.” \nThe younger Lewis has been on a meteoric rise in ability since he was a freshman at Lake Mary Prep, the school that disbanded its football program three years ago. The school has since resumed its football program, but Lewis has moved on. He transferred to Orlando First Academy for a season before rejoining former Lake Mary Prep secondary mates Ben DeLuca and Robert Cheathem at Bishop Moore last year. \nLewis started off with a bang at Bishop Moore, pulling down three interceptions in his first game. He had seven total last season and the trio combined for 14. \nIt’s not just Lewis’ abilities that impress Hedrick. He said his top corner also is a student of the game. \n“He really has an astute football mind and his skill level has gotten better and better every year. … Sure he’s gotten bigger and stronger, but his knowledge and understanding is at a very high level, too,” Hedrick said. \nHe’s been a breath of fresh air for Hedrick, who has a team full of unselfish team-first players. \n“He’s just a really good teammate, a really good kid,” said Hedrick of Lewis, who also plays part-time receiver and runs back punts and kickoffs. “He never complains. He never says, ‘Why I can’t play this position?’ or ‘I could have done this,’ or ‘Why couldn’t you have given me the ball?’ or ‘Why did you take me out of the game?’… He never sulks. He never mopes. It’s pretty impressive to see the way he carries himself.” \nI fell into the trap of how to judge Rayshad Lewis early. I was always concerned that I might consider him to be better than he is just because of his bloodlines. I’m not nearly as dumb anymore. He’s better than he used to be, and he’ll be even better tomorrow. \nHe’s risen into the top 20 of our 2016 Central Florida Super60 prospect rankings. College coaches will, hopefully, soon figure that out, as well. \n“I really believe that you can get better every day,” Lewis said. “Being around this great group and being around a bunch of talent … you really are challenged to get better every single day because you really can tell when you are stalemating or getting complacent, so I just try to stay hungry. Being able to come to a place where you can get better every day is truly a blessing.” \nIf he were only a few inches taller, he’d have a lot more FBS scholarship offers than the few he holds from FAU, Appalachian State, Ball State, Idaho, Old Dominion, Toledo, FIU, Fresno State and Utah State, the latter being the team coming at him the hardest. He says he’s not worried about that stuff. \n“It’s going great. Coaches keep in touch with me and call me once or twice a week,” he said. “I’m loving the process, but right now I’m focusing on the season.” \nLewis and the Hornets fell one game short of their goal at 13-1 last year, losing in the Class 5A state semifinals to eventual state champion Plantation American Heritage. This season, the Hornets are 6-0 with nine games remaining to reach their goal. \nNothing less than taking the championship medal stand in the Citrus Bowl at about 4 p.m. Dec. 11 will be acceptable. \nLife is Rayshad Lewis’ canvas and he’s continuing to paint. \nHis father still understands him better than anyone. \n“He makes every one of my games,” Rayshad said of his dad. \nThe pair reviews every game together. \n“He always definitely will start with the things I did wrong,” Rayshad smiled, “so he will keep it real with me and let me know what I did wrong, but then after that he’ll congratulate me and tell me what I did good.” \nWhen I asked the father following Bishop Moore’s win over South Sumter last Thursday if I could get a photo of the two together, Ray Lewis said, “You’ll have to ask him. This is his night.” \nIndeed, no one could have said it better. It’s Rayshad Lewis’ life. Just ask him. \n\"There is always going to be criticism with his fans or people who aren't his fans ... and they expect so much from me. I'd just like people to see me as me,\" Rayshad told me last summer. \"I'm Rayshad Lewis. I'm also his son, but I'm a player myself and my talent has nothing to do with my dad's success. I want people to understand that.\" \nLoud and clear. \nChris Hays is the Sentinel's recruiting coverage coordinator and can be reached at chays@tribune.com .
