(Jonathan Newton/The Washington Post) \nRedskins coach Jay Gruden didn’t assess any specific blame on the final play of the 25-19 overtime loss to the Atlanta Falcons, which resulted in a 59-yard interception return by Robert Alford for the game-losing touchdown. \nQuarterback Kirk Cousins was hit by linebacker Nate Stupar on a throw intended for Ryan Grant, who slipped on what Gruden said was an eight-to-nine yard stop route. The Redskins were in scat protection, leaving only five offensive linemen to block five rushers with the Falcons sending Stupar on the blitz. Gruden said Washington slid its protection to the right, leaving Stupar unaccounted for on the left side for a clean shot at Cousins. \n“Kirk had to get rid of the ball quickly,” Gruden said. “He threw the ball before Ryan Grant turned around and when Ryan Grant was about to turn around he stumbled. Whether it would have been complete, whether it still would have been intercepted, we don’t know. Ryan just got a turf monster and fell down. Kirk felt the need to get rid of it. He didn’t want to take a sack there in a big situation, so that’s what happened. It was just an unfortunate play.” \n[ D.C. Sports Bog: Assessing blame for the game-ending interception ] \nCousins finished 21 of 32 for 219 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. It was his third game with two interceptions and a quarterback rating under 70 (69.7). The Redskins have lost all three of those contests. Washington’s Pierre Garcon tips the ball up and watches Atlanta’s Robert Alford intercept it. (John McDonnell/The Washington Post) \nThe Redskins’ offense didn’t have a functional run game , rushing for just 51 yards on 24 carries against the Falcons. The play calling was fairly split between the run and pass but Washington had to rely on Cousins more with an ineffective ground attack. There were moments where Cousins excelled, leading the offense 46 yards down the field in 19 seconds for the game-tying 52-yard field goal at the end of regulation, and other moments when he was off, throwing behind wide receiver Pierre Garcon in the second quarter which led to Alford’s first interception in the game. \n“There are some plays that I think he wished he had back yesterday, but I think he is improving,” Gruden said. “He’s going to have his ups and downs, every quarterback does. Heck, Matt Ryan was 50-something percent with two picks yesterday, and he’s been a hell of a player for a long time. You’re going to have some plays in the game or games that you’re not perfect, but it’s a matter of keeping your team in the game, making good decisions and giving your team a chance to win at the end. And he did that again, we just had the slip and fall and pick six. \n“Overall I think he’s shown enough to where we can work with him, people around him getting better, the running game’s got to continue to get better. We can be a very good, solid offense with him at the helm.” \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:29:49.536+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
