The mother was admitted to Safdurjung Hospital in New Delhi, where her condition was reported to be critical. The police have arrested one person in this regard. According to sources, the incident occurred around 3 am when some unidentified persons poured some inflammable substance through a window of the room, where the family was asleep, and set it on fire. The fire soon engulfed the house, killing two children — two-and-a-half-year old Vaibhav and nine-month-old Divya — on the spot. Their mother, Rekha, 24, suffered 70 per cent burn injuries and her condition is reported to be critical. The father, Deepender, 27, was not present in the house when the incident occurred. After getting information, a police team reached the spot immediately and rushed the victims to Safdurjung Hospital. An old enmity between two families is suspected to be the reason behind the incident. Three members of an upper caste family had allegedly been murdered last year, in which the blame had been put on the victims’ family, revealed the sources in the village.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:06:36.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
