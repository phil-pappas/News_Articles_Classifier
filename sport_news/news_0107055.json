(AP Photo/Jeff Roberson) Sponsored Links The Associated Press ST. LOUIS â€” \nKyle Hendricks and Addison Russell had successful squeeze bunts and Jorge Soler capped a five-run second with a two-run homer, and the Chicago Cubs held off the St. Louis Cardinals 6-3 on Saturday night to even their NL Division series at a game apiece. \nManager Joe Maddon made all the right moves a night after the Cubs lost the opener 4-0. Now the series shifts to Wrigley Field for Game 3 Monday, where Chicago's 22-game winner Jake Arrieta faces St. Louis' Michael Wacha in the best-of-five series. \nThe usually steady NL Central champion Cardinals made two errors as the Cubs didn't hit the ball out of the infield in scoring their first three runs in the second. \nPlaying in his first postseason game, Soler connected off Jaime Garcia (0-1), who was lifted because of a stomach ailment after the second inning.
