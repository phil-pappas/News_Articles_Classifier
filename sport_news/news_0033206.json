That too, surpassed the 2012 record of $150,637,998.\nChris Kay , the board's CEO and president, noted that they recorded a 13.8 percent increase in revenue from dining, concessions and merchandising, which was in keeping with a strong attendance of 1,065,625.\n\"Over the past two years, our efforts to enhance the overall experience and improve the quality of racing are clearly resonating with our horseplayers, our fans and with their families,\" Kay said.\nThe oversight board, put in place three years ago by Gov. Andrew Cuomo , has been criticized by some local Saratoga boosters who say it's time to put NYRA back in private hands, as opposed to a state-controlled oversight board.\nThe good financial performance of this past meet in Saratoga could be viewed as a sign, though, that the oversight board is doing a good job.\nThere is no firm timetable for when the oversight board will end.\nInterest in Saratoga was heightened when American Pharoah became a Triple Crown winner at NYRA's Belmont stakes.\nAmerican Pharoah also raced in the Travers Stakes, where attendance was capped at 50,000. The Triple Crown winner ended up losing to Keen Ice. But American Pharoah's appearance sparked increased publicity and interest in the meet.\nNYRA also raised restaurant seating prices and initiated a program in which visitors could pay to reserve picnic tables near the paddock.\nKay told board members at Wednesday's meeting that the Saratoga course saw physical improvements such as those at the Saratoga Walk of Fame, an open-air pavilion honoring owners, trainers and jockeys who have influenced the sport.\nrkarlin@timesunion.com • 518-454-5758 • @RickKarlinTU", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T11:33:57.135+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
