The assets include the right to apply for a casino license. \nJoseph Procacci, a Philadelphia-based wholesaler known as the \"Tomato King,\" and Chicago-based Merit Management have applied to assume control of Lawrence Downs from Delaware County-based Endeka Entertainment in the latest twist of a development effort now in its second decade. \nJonathan Newman, the lone Harness Racing Commission member after two resigned, will likely vote today on transferring Lawrence Downs' interest from Endeka to the Procacci-Merit group, Lawrence County Commissioner Dan Vogler said at Tuesday's commissioners' meeting. \nVogler said he was \"hopeful\" the transfer would be approved. He has represented the county almost since the day he took office in 2004 in dealings with investors involved with Lawrence Downs and state agencies overseeing the licensing process. \nThe new entity will have to show it has at least $170 million in financial resources to put toward construction of Lawrence Downs. The group also faces a Nov. 20 deadline to present documents for the state Gaming Control Board, although Wednesday's action might render much of that requirement moot. \nJoseph Canfora, Merit's CEO, is a Lawrence County native. He and Procacci worked together in an unsuccessful application for a stand-alone harness-racing license in Philadelphia, so the Gaming Control Board has already vetted them to a certain degree. \nThe board's Nov. 20 deadline applies to Endeka personnel involved with Lawrence Downs, since it was issued before the Procacci-Merit group joined. \nHowever, with a new group spearheading casino efforts, Vogler said he expected that the Gaming Control Board would require another public hearing in Mahoning Township, following one in 2014 under the Endeka application and one in 2008 for an application by Centaur Gaming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:08:37.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
