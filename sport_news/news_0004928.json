Don't count Eagles head coach Chip Kelly in that camp, he pinned the sudden outbreak of dropped passes on something else entirely. \n\"I don't think it's talent,\" Kelly said Monday during his Monday press conference at the NovaCare Complex. \"I just think it's some kind of concentration issue with those guys. Sometimes they may actually be thinking too much, instead of just relaxing and going to play. Sometimes they need to just take a deep breath and go do what we know they can do. They've made some big-time catches for us and can continue to do that for us. Sometimes I think they're over-thinking a little bit.\" \nEntering Week 7, Eagles receivers had dropped a total of nine passes this season and might have surpassed that number on Sunday night in Carolina alone. \nWith so many missed opportunities, including Josh Huff and Jordan Matthews both dropping would-be touchdown receptions against Carolina, one has to wonder what, if anything, can be done to rectify this recurring issue that is costing the Eagles games. \n\"It's fundamental stuff,\" Kelly said when asked what can be done during the bye week to try and eliminate the team's costly drops. \"I think with some of those guys, I think that they're sometimes thinking too much. Jordan's a guy who, I don't know of a guy who catches more balls during the week, he's here at 7 a.m. working on the JUGS machine. I think that he needs to take a deep breath and go play. He has outstanding hands. He's been a very clutch-receiver for us.\" \nMatthews is the Eagles' leading receiver through seven games with 39 receptions for 398 yards and one touchdown. However, the second-year receiver's season has been defined by the passes he didn't catch, including two deflections that turned into Sam Bradford interceptions. \nOn Sunday, Matthews' struggles spread to the rest of the wide receiving corps and the missed opportunities -- especially in the red zone -- somehow, someway, need to be corrected and converted, or else it is going to be a long second half of the season for this team. \n\"We had eight ... Maybe 10,\" Kelly said of the drops Sunday night. \"Obviously, we're not going to win if we're doing that. We have to be able to sustain things. We have to be able to make catches out there.\" \nKelly says he believes that the bye week is coming at exactly the right time for this group. \n\"I think getting away for a week is a big part of it,\" Kelly said. \"I expect those guys to come back with a clear mind and ready to go.\" Matt Lombardo may be reached at MDLombardo@yahoo.com .
