(Daniel Lin /Daily News-Record via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT ORG XMIT: VAHAR105 (Daniel Lin / Associated Press) David Teel Contact Reporter David Teel #JMU hosting #ESPN's iconic pregame show \nJames Madison football, indeed the entire university and Harrisonburg communities, are reveling in this week’s arrival of ESPN’s College GameDay. No media outlet approaches the network’s reach, and the attending publicity and spectacle — surely Lee Corso will don the JMU mascot head for his endearingly childish picks segment — will be invaluable. \nThe event especially resonates for us codgers who attended Madison during the late 1970s and early ’80s, who watched the Dukes transition from NCAA Division III to Division I-AA, who sat on a hill behind the north end zone peering inside the — charitable description here — stadium, who never could have envisioned capacity crowds approaching 25,000 and state-of-the-art facilities. \nBut please understand that neither JMU’s first 7-0 start nor the self-proclaimed worldwide leader parachuting onto campus is a pinnacle. To wit: \nCharles Haley, a defensive force for the Dukes from 1982-85, is the only player in NFL history to win five Super Bowls. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2011 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame this year. \nGary Clark, whose two long punt returns for touchdowns ignited JMU’s 1982 upset of Virginia, was a Pro Bowl receiver for the Washington Redskins and the first player in NFL history to catch at least 50 passes in each of his first 10 seasons. He scored a touchdown in two Washington Super Bowl victories. \nLinebacker Arthur Moats of Portsmouth and offensive tackle Earl Watford have started this season for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Arizona Cardinals, respectively. \nNot bad for a program that started in 1972 as a non-scholarship squad recruited out of class registration lines. Not bad for a program that, without a stadium, played its first game, a 6-0 “home” loss to the Shepherd College junior varsity, on its practice field. \nMost notably, and far beyond the individual accolades, JMU won the 2004 I-AA (now Football Championship Subdivision) national title. Coached by Mickey Matthews and with a host of Hampton Roads starters — running backs Alvin Banks and Maurice Fenner, offensive tackle Corey Davis and defensive tackle Brandon Beach among them — the Dukes rebounded from a mid-November home loss to William and Mary to embark on an improbable playoff run. \nJMU survived Lehigh and Furman by identical 14-13 margins — the Dukes’ winning touchdown in the latter game came with 28 seconds remaining — to set up a semifinal rematch with William and Mary. \nOn a dank Friday night in Williamsburg, with portable lights trucked in for the occasion and ESPN televising, JMU prevailed 48-34. The Dukes led 21-0 and trailed 26-21 before scoring 27 consecutive points to become the first team to reach the championship game with three road conquests. \nA week later, with Fenner and Banks rushing for a combined 252 yards, JMU defeated Montana 31-21 for the national title in Chattanooga, Tennessee. \nCovering both JMU-William and Mary games that season, I felt oddly detached. More than 20 years removed from campus life, my sole rooting interest, especially in the prime-time semifinal, was for a quick, deadline-friendly affair. \nThe national championship game was different. On assignment at Virginia Tech, I found a good meal and bar stool and cheered like crazy, along with many other patrons. \nMontana avenged that defeat in 2008, winning a frigid playoff semifinal in Harrisonburg. The Dukes failed to make postseason two years later, but they did make headlines, shocking a Virginia Tech team that subsequently won its next 11 games and the ACC championship. \nMatthews and other JMU faithful consider the victory at Tech the largest in program history, but give me the national title any day. \nThe point is, the Dukes have considerable sports heritage, and not just in football. Lou Campanelli’s basketball team advanced in three consecutive NCAA tournaments, defeating Georgetown in 1981, Ohio State in ’82 and West Virginia in ’83. Also in ’83, Brad Babcock, the father of Virginia Tech athletic director Whit Babcock, coached JMU’s baseball team to the College World Series. \nHad those events transpired in today’s media world, JMU and Harrisonburg would enjoy far more acclaim. Suffice to say, they’ll receive plenty when the GameDay crew — Corso, Rece Davis, Kirk Herbstreit, Desmond Howard and Co. — goes on the air at 9 a.m. Saturday to preview the day’s games, including the Dukes against Colonial Athletic Association rival Richmond (5-1). \nLed by quarterback Vad Lee and running backs Khalid Abdullah and Cardon Johnson — the latter two hail from Newport News — JMU is averaging a silly 613 yards and 48.7 points per game. Last season in Richmond, Lee passed for 433 yards and two touchdowns as the Dukes cruised, 55-20. \nBut enough about football. GameDay’s broadcast is an infomercial for the university, one that has flourished academically and physically — the east side of campus was a virtual forest in my day. And one blessed with — please pardon the shoutout — a darn fine student newspaper: The Breeze. \nI trust JMU students will create a scene Saturday on the Quad, a favorite Frisbee venue and a long field goal from my Hoffman Hall dorm, for ESPN. Moreover, I’m confident that GameDay producer Lee Fitting, class of ’96, will introduce his co-workers to the ’Burg’s hotspots. \nMy preferred haunt, the Elbow Room, is long gone. But surely Fitting will take the crew to Jess’ for lunch. Chili dog, extra onions, chocolate shake. Can’t go wrong. \nOne final piece of advice: Make sure the Duke dog head fits Corso. \nDavid Teel can be reached at 757-247-4636 or by email at dteel@dailypress.com .
