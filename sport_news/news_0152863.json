(AP Photo/John Froschauer)\nRemember when the NFL took the extra point away?\nOk, they didn’t take it away. They changed it. And they did so with the idea they wanted to make the game’s “most boring play” more exciting. To some extent, the experiment has worked. We’ve seen some teams decide to go for two early in games or in certain strategic situations.\nWe’ve also seen a surprising number of missed extra points. To some extent, that may have been expected. What wasn’t expected is the havoc the change would play with the extra point’s big brother, the field goal.\nAfter counting seven missed field goals during the early games, I gave up counting on the day. And this was after a Thursday night game that featured two big missed kicks of its own.\nWhat in the name of Jan Stenerud is going on?\nWell, if you read what Jay Feely wrote on Twitter Sunday afternoon, you start to get a sense of how something as simple as changing the extra point can have unintended consequences.\nNow, some of these misses are just bad kickers making bad kicks. Whether it’s Josh Scobee or Kyle Brindza, there are guys who you expect to see miss.\nBut when you see a guy like Blair Walsh, who had been a pillar of consistency prior to 2015, suddenly struggle seemingly only after a change has been made to the NFL’s kicking game, you start to wonder what is going on.\nAnd as excruciating as it is for fans of certain kicker’s teams, it can be a horror show for fantasy players who find out that the kicker in their lineup missed a kick, or even worse, multiple kicks.\nHow do you avoid it? Especially when nearly every kicker seems to be suffering from the fallout of the rule change to one degree or another?\nFor one, now that the weather is changing, be sure to check your weather reports early and often. As fall gives way to winter we’re going to see even more missed kicks and we’re all going to be cursing and throwing things. Keep your stuff in-tact by making sure to avoid kickers playing in places like Buffalo or Green Bay later in the year.\nObviously it’s not always as simple as avoiding the weather. Sometimes it’s about going toward something rather than going away from it. While no kick seems to be easy this year, guys like Cairo Santos and Steven Hauschka are on teams that give them plenty of opportunities to kick in the red zone.\nIn the end, there’s no magical formula for picking your fantasy kicker, but you are best off taking guys who have a track record of consistency through the first month of the season. Couple that with your weather reports and swing away – just hope you don’t end up pulling it.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:01:49.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
