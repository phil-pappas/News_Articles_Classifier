Alabama's back! But did they ever really go away? Published 8:08 PM CDT Oct 05, 2015 \nHey, everybody...Alabama's back! \nBut did they ever really go away? \nWhen the Crimson Tide lost their SEC opener to Ole Miss, many were wondering if this team still had national championship potential. After destroying Georgia on Saturday, the Crimson Tide sent a message to the entire nation that they're not done. \nAlthough, Nick Saban thinks that some in the media thought the Tide was finished. \n\"Well, I say the same thing as when you all buried us last week and all that,\" Saban said. \"It really doesn't matter what you think. It really doesn't matter what you say. I'm hoping that nobody on our team is playing for you. I hope they're playing for each other.\" \n\"Because if it was up to you, we're six foot under already,\" Saban said. \"We're dead, buried, and gone. Gone.\" \nLet's talk about Alabama's next opponent: The Arkansas Razorbacks. They come into this weekend at 2-3. \nWait, I guess Nick Saban's not done yet. \n\"So if that was the case, we'd have to get some respirators out or something down there to put life back in people,\" Saban said. \nSome Bama players told us last year their victory over Arkansas was the turning point for the 2014 season. Center Ryan Kelly says Bama's victory over Georgia on Saturday might have the same effect. Tweet \nCopyright 2015 by WVTM13.com . All rights reserved.
