He was installed as a full-time driver for the 2014 championship and finished second in his debut at the Australian Grand Prix. He was dropped after one season following Fernando Alonso's arrival from Ferrari.\nMcLaren chairman Ron Dennis says \"there is no shame in being edged out by two world champions, Fernando (Alonso) and Jenson (Button). We wish Kevin well, and will do all we can to help him successfully embark on the next chapter of his racing career.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:34:10.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
