Malik Springfield led the Cavaliers with 131 yards rushing and three touchdowns. Coach Jauron Holman said it would “be nice” if he could repeat this performance next week. “It gets a lot tougher next week,” Holman said. “But I think we got the talent, and if we can stay mentally focused, we can battle.” All facets of the game were strong for Cummings on the night. The offense got 383 yards from the ground attack on 37 carries, while the defense held Carrboro to 48 total yards. Torey Cash started at quarterback for Cummings, scoring the first two touchdowns on 12- and 3-yard runs in the first quarter. Cash got hurt in the first half, though, and was taken out for the game. Springfield added an 11-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. Thanks to three field goals from Carlos Beltrane, the Cavaliers led 29-0 at halftime. With only 19 players dressed for the game, the coaches for Carrboro asked the referees to run the clock for the rest of the game around the six-minute mark of the third quarter. Cummings agreed, allowing the depleted Jaguars a chance to stay injury-free in the second half. Springfield added two touchdowns in the second half, running in from 32 yards out and 21 yards out. Freshman Jamarre Ivey took the last play of the night 34 yards for a score, with the point after try from Beltrane getting Cummings to the half-century mark. The Cavaliers, with a two-game winning streak, know what to expect from Reidsville in next week’s rivalry game. “Coach (Jimmy) Teague is a great coach — he’s been doing it since I played,” Holman said. “They are going to come in here and hit us in the mouth. How are we going to respond? That’s the biggest thing this week, to respond well.” By Alex Simon", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:55:21.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
