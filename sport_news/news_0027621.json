He went down on UW's final offensive play of the game, however, and the Badgers didn't need to reshuffle their line. \n\"We will find out more through practice and all that,\" head coach Paul Chryst said Monday when asked about Voltz's availability this week against visiting Purdue. \"But we were told today it was a sprain, which is good news. \n\"So it's a matter of just getting him back, and I think he will have a brace with it but just getting him comfortable with that.\" \nThis season UW hasn't started the same line for more than two consecutive games and has featured three right tackles in the last three games. \nRedshirt sophomore Hayden Biegel started the first four games but has missed the last two games because of injury. Redshirt freshman Jacob Maxwell started at right tackle against Iowa, but he did not make the trip to Nebraska and redshirt freshman Beau Benzschawel got the start. \nBenzschawel, who missed most of camp and the first five games of the season because of a knee injury, went the distance against the Cornhuskers. \n\"I thought Beau did a nice job,\" Chryst said, saluting the conditioning and weight work Benzschawel was able to do before returning to practice last week. \"What did we throw it, 50-some times? I thought our guys did a nice job of protecting, and I thought Joel (Stave) actually stood in there and took some hits on those.\" \nTailback Taiwan Deal wasn't able to go the distance against Nebraska. He suffered a left-ankle sprain on his fourth carry and his status for the Purdue game is unclear. \nWith Deal limited to four carries for 8 yards last week, Dare Ogunbowale carried 18 times for 117 yards and freshman Alec Ingold added 14 yards and a touchdown. \n\"We'll see during the week,\" Chryst said when asked about Deal. \"You know, I was disappointed for him because I know he was looking forward to playing and tried to give it a go.\" \nDon't expect a detailed update. \n\"I'll let you guys know, I'm sure,\" Chryst said, chuckling. \nRecruiting update: Eric Burrell , a 6-foot, 180-pound safety from Owings Mills, Md., on Monday gave UW an oral commitment for the 2016 class. \nBurrell's offer list included Iowa, Nebraska, Maryland, Pittsburgh, Virginia Tech, Boston College and Duke. \nBurrell is the 21st known commitment for the class. \nExtra points: A total of 15 players have caught at least one pass for UW this season. The breakdown by position is six wide receivers, six backs and three tight ends. Last season, a total of 14 players caught passes for UW. That included offensive lineman Kyle Costigan (minus-5 yards). However, only three running backs caught passes last season.... \nUW has outscored Purdue, 140-27, in the teams' last three meetings in Madison. UW is favored by 191/2 points over the Boilermakers. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved.
