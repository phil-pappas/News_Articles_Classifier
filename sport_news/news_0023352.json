Coach Red Wilson gave Spurrier total control of the Blue Devils offense, and for three years he moved the football as few coaches in the ACC in that era ever had. When Spurrier says that “whatever I learned as a football coach I learned at Duke,” I think he’s flashing back to the early 80’s, especially 1981 and 1982. \nDuke won six games in each of those two years and in most of those contests the Blue Devils probably had no business winning. Certainly they were outmanned at the line of scrimmage on both sides of the ball. But with Ben Bennett passing to Chris Castor, Carl Franks, and Mark Militello -- collectively they were known as Air Force Four -- the Blue Devils piled up 2,368 yards through the air in ‘81 and 3,349 yards in 1982. The ’82 Duke team became the first in ACC history to average more than 300 yards passing per game. \nThe 1982 season proved most memorable. Duke unleashed the fleet Castor, who had been injured most of 1981, and upset Tennessee in Knoxville. Playing before 95,000 fans, Bennett hit Castor with an 88-yard bomb, which at that time was the longest touchdown pass in Duke history. The Blue Devils won 25-24. Spurrier, who had grown up in Johnson City before leaving the state of Tennessee to play at Florida, actually began his domination of the Vols that night. Later of course, as coach of Florida, Spurrier went 7-3 against Tennessee during the 90’s. \nUnder Spurrier’s tutelage, Bennett in 1982 set a mark for pass efficiency at Duke that still stands today. Bennett became one of the ACC’s all-time leading passers and his 9,614 yards through the air still rank seventh in league annals, even against the onslaught of passing offenses over the last two decades. \nThe numbers for Spurrier’s receivers may be even more eye opening. Militello still ranks 15th all-time in career receptions at Duke even though he shared the ball with two other top pass catchers. Meanwhile Castor holds the Duke record for most receiving yards per catch over his career, nearly 19, and he holds the school record for most receiving yards in a game. In fact, the 283 yards Castor put up against Wake Forest in 1982 remains the gold standard for receivers all over the Atlantic Coast Conference. Castor in ’82, was actually runner up in balloting for ACC Player of the Year, quite rare for a receiver. \nTo fully appreciate Spurrier’s impact on Duke football, consider what happened between 1983 and 1986. Athletic Director Tom Butters replaced Wilson with Steve Sloan, while Spurrier became the head coach of the new Tampa Bay Bandits of the United States Football League. Sloan brought in a strong staff, recruited well, and worked with Butters to improve the school’s facilities. But over four years he won just 13 games and lost 31. Spurrier, meanwhile, in his first head coaching job, went 35-21 with the USFL’s Bandits. So when Sloan decided to take the position as AD at his alma mater Alabama, who do you think Duke called? Coming Back to Duke as Head Coach \nSpurrier actually spent some time out of coaching because the USFL folded in 1986. So obviously he would be a top candidate for the head coaching position at Duke. We at WRAL actually shot video of Spurrier when he arrived for his on campus interview. And we were on the scene at the Raleigh-Durham Airport the day Duke called a press conference to introduce the new coach. I remember talking to one of the Duke players at RDU that day. The players had not been told officially who was coming but one said to me, “it’s got to be Spurrier. It’s just got to be Spurrier.” \nOf course it was. Duke smartly, began the press conference at 6 p.m. We led the WRAL newscast that night with the new Duke coach being introduced -- in fact, we actually gave a cue to the Duke Media Relations staff as to when the proceedings should begin. Spurrier’s opening comment said it all: “It’s pretty apparent,” he said, “the people here are tired of mediocre football at Duke.” Steve Spurrier, even then, was never one to mince words. \nI remember doing several interviews after the press conference, including one with Jerri Spurrier. I asked the new coach’s wife what made her husband a successful coach. She said several things, but the quote that I remember is “he has a great football mind.” And that was something of an understatement. \nThe Duke Promotions staff, prior to the 1987 season, trumpeted the slogan “Air Ball,” and Spurrier did not disappoint. Steve Slayden, a quarterback Spurrier inherited from the Sloan era, set a new record for total offense. The Duke team set a new record for most yards passing in a season. Clarkston Hines set a record for most yards receiving in one season. And yet the head coach was not that happy. The Blue Devils had started 3-0, but then suffered a four game losing streak as the team began conference play. Spurrier was always frank in his assessment, as in this comment at our interview following the Clemson game: “We’re back to being “Old Duke University,” he told me. “We threw it and dropped it. Got penalties. Then they run it down our throat.” “Old Duke University” \nBut by 1988, “Old Duke University” had begun to fade. The Blue Devils jumped out to a 5-0 start. They even won at Tennessee again! Duke lost to Clemson and Maryland, but in fairness, Clemson won the league that season, and Maryland had only begun to fade after winning three straight ACC titles in 1983, 1984, and 1985. The two games that really hurt Duke were a loss to Bill Dooley’s Wake Forest team and a tie with NC State. \nThat 43-43 offensive free for all at Carter-Finley Stadium was one of the most amazing games I’ve ever seen. Neither team really deserved to lose. And yet, NC State at 7-3-1, earned an invitation to the Peach Bowl. Duke, also 7-3-1, stayed home for the post-season. Although Spurrier respected NC State coach Dick Sheridan, the Blue Devils fretted over State getting a bowl bid, while the Duke high powered offense had to be shut down for another year. \nAnd it was a record setting Duke offense, as ACC Player of the Year Anthony Dilweg set six different single season marks. In fact-and I find this amazing given the emphasis on passing in the last two decades-Anthony Dilweg still holds the ACC’s single season record for most yards per game in one season, 347. \nDilweg did not throw quite as much in 1989. Because the Blue Devils discovered big running back Randy Cuthbert. Cuthbert did not play a lot in the early part of the season. And the Blue Devils lost to Virginia, which we would note, was just one year from becoming the No. 1 team in the country for a time. But after a 1-3 start (the Devils even lost at Tennessee, Spurrier’s first ”L” in Knoxville as a coach) Duke absolutely stunned Clemson. The game was not televised, but I will always remember looking at our WRAL video of what transpired in the shadow of the Clemson goal. Cuthbert, an unknown freshman, took the ball at the five yard line, and literally willed his way to the end zone. Cuthbert ran over four different Tiger tacklers to score the winning touchdown. In my years of watching Duke football, I have never seen anything like that play. For me, in spite of all of the success Duke had throwing the football under Spurrier, the Randy Cuthbert touchdown against Clemson remains the seminal moment of the Spurrier era. The Arrival of Cuthbert, Everything before was B.C. \nIn fact, later in the year when Spurrier would be asked about the team’s early season loss to Virginia, the coach would get a twinkle in his eye and bounce up and down a bit as he was wont to do in interviews, and say “That was BC.” Spurrier was the son of a minister, but in this case he was talking about “before Cuthbert. “Duke gave the ball often to Cuthbert in 1989. He finished with more than 1,000 yards, becoming the school’s first 1,000-yard rusher since Steve Jones in 1972. \nMost know the rest of the story. Duke routed North Carolina 41-0, with Spurrier afterward gathering the team in front of the Kenan Stadium scoreboard for a picture. The ACC crowned Duke and Virginia co-champions for 1989 and this time the Blue Devils earned a bowl bid -- their first since 1962. They played in the All-American Bowl against Texas Tech, but with Spurrier already agreeing to take the head coaching job at his alma mater, Florida, the Blue Devils lost decisively. The Spurrier Era-Records from a Hands on Coach \nThe numbers posted in the Steve Spurrier era remain etched, some perhaps permanently, in the ACC and Duke record books. The 1989 Spurrier team set a record for total offense in the ACC averaging more than 500 yards, although that one has since been surpassed. Star receiver Clarkston Hines set records for receptions, yards, and touchdowns. The records for receptions and yards have changed hands, but Hines still holds the ACC’s career mark for career touchdown receptions with 38. His mark of 17 touchdown catches in one year stood until 2012 when Clemson’s DeAndre “Newk” Hopkins recorded 18. \nWe looked in on Duke practices with some frequency in the Spurrier era. It seems like every practice began the same way. Spurrier, wearing a visor, would throw passes to his receivers. He himself did this -- how many head coaches get so personally involved in the minutia of practice? Spurrier would throw high to make the receivers jump. He would throw low to make them dive. I can still see Clarkston Hines diving for the balls Steve Spurrier threw in practice. How many times did Hines hit the turf to bring in one of the 189 passes he caught during his time at Duke? More than a few. \nHaving coached quarterbacks and receivers to record setting levels at academic-minded Duke University, Spurrier took things up a notch in Gainesville. Florida had never, even during Spurrier’s Heisman Trophy days as a player, won the SEC championship. The “Head Ball Coach” as he would become known, would win six SEC titles as coach of the Gators in the 90’s. He also won a national championship. And beat Tennessee a bunch. \nAnd yet there was that lure to take on a new challenge. Spurrier became coach of the Washington Redskins. Had some success. Certainly he realized the “Fun N’ Gun” which had worked so well at Florida, would need a strong running component in the NFL. But after going 12-20 over two seasons, Spurrier found himself back on the sidelines after 2003, no doubt coming to the conclusion that he relished coaching in college more than the NFL. The North Carolina Job? We’ll Never Know \nThe Spurrier family had enjoyed living in North Carolina during the Duke days, and I am told the UNC program was one of those “the Head Ball Coach” monitored during his time away from coaching in 2004. Certainly he was aware of the large number of players the Tar Heels had sent to the NFL under Mack Brown, and to a lesser extent, Carl Torbush and John Bunting. \nThe 2004 season began poorly for UNC in Bunting’s fourth year as coach-at one point the Tar Heels were 3-4 and appeared headed for a third straight losing season. Key people in Chapel Hill began to put out feelers for a new coach. I am told Spurrier was interested. Would he have actually taken the job if offered, and competed against his beloved Duke Blue Devils? We’ll never know. The Tar Heels stunned Miami in an extraordinary upset, nearly won at Virginia Tech, and then defeated Wake Forest and pummeled Duke, earning the school a bowl bid and generating a contract extension for Bunting. A year later Spurrier accepted the Carolinas coaching job that was available-the one in Columbia. \nAt South Carolina, Spurrier achieved unprecedented success in a program which yearns for a winner, but has most often found itself stuck in the middle of the pack. Spurrier posted three 11 win seasons at USC. And twice while coaching the Gamecocks,he was voted SEC Coach of the Year. But after slumping to a .500 record in 2014, and a 2-4 mark in 2015, Spurrier stunned the sports world Monday by resigning in the middle of the season. \nIn hindsight, it is difficult to imagine Spurrier coaching at North Carolina, as much as he relished beating the Tar Heels. His Duke and South Carolina teams played the Tar Heels six times. They won all six, even beating UNC in the 2015 season opener, the season in which Spurrier’s last team at South Carolina, went south.
