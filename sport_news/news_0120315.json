Since late last season, he’s let it be known that he wants to prove himself as a top-four defenseman in this league.\nThough it looked like he’d start this season on his usual third defensive pairing with trusty mate Adam McQuaid, the two of them were elevated thanks to injuries. First they were moved up to the first pair when both Zdeno Chara and Dennis Seidenberg were sidelined. Now with Chara back, they’re essentially the second pair.\nAnd so far, Krug is playing well in the enhanced role. Through five games, he and McQuaid are two of the Bruins’ four plus players. Krug has also been instrumental in the B’s excellent first power-play unit. His six assists put him second behind David Krejci in team scoring.\nIn another contract year, Krug is proving once again that he is a money player.\n“It’s been good. Especially playing consistently with Quaider has really helped me out,” Krug said. “We have tougher assignments, tougher matchups and it’s a lot more fun for me, personally. You can see we’re going out there every game and not really thinking too much, just playing hockey, trying to keep the puck out of our net and I think we’ve been relatively successful in doing that.”\nThrough five games, Krug is second behind only Chara in average ice time (23:08) and leads in shifts per game (28.2). And, thanks in part to injuries and in part youth on the back end, he’s had to pick up a little slack in penalty killing.\nKrug said his added minutes are no problem, but his new matchups do present a real challenge.\n“If I’ve got to go into a game against Blake Wheeler as opposed to a smaller guy like Max Domi, there’s definitely different preparation,” he said. “You have to understand what type of players they are and what their tendencies are. It’s not so much how much you’re going to play, it’s just focusing on who you’re out there against.”\nWith his skill set, Krug will probably always be a more accomplished player at the offensive end of the rink than the defensive. His performance in the B’s 5-3 win over Arizona Saturday was a good example. He picked up a pair of assists but was also part of a losing battle for a loose puck in front of the net that led to the Arizona Coyotes’ third-period goal that made it 3-3.\nBut Krug is not satisfied with being a one-dimensional player. In the preseason, coach Claude Julien likened Krug’s situation to that of another undersized defenseman, Brian Rafalski, who was able to excel in his own end by figuring out ways to get the puck instead of delving into physical battles that wouldn’t end well for him. Krug is still trying to come up with his own tricks.\n“I’m always trying to do that, and that’s a constant dialogue that I’m having with the coaching staff, watching film,” he said. “This year, it’s a small sample, four games but I feel like I haven’t been as stubborn physically than I’ve normally been in the past, trying to go in the corners and prove that I can compete against bigger guys. I haven’t been doing that too much. Now it’s about playing smart hockey.”\nWhile Julien may not see Krug as a quintessential top-four defenseman, the coach believes the player is earning more time.\n“He’s held his own,” Julien said. “There are games when I don’t think we want to see him play 24 minutes and the circumstances have created that. But definitely he’s played well through this stretch. He’s been asked to do a little bit more and he’s handled it well. It’s a good sign for us.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:25:32.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
