But according to one political science professor, a divided Republican party could make that process a little more complicated. \nHouse Republicans arrived for a closed door meeting today to try to determine who the next Speaker of the House will be. \nMajority Leader Kevin McCarthy dropped out of the race after it became apparent he couldn't get the 218 votes needed to win. \nSo now the pressure is on Congressman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin to run, who has repeatedly said he's not interested. \n\"The Speaker of the House is actually an institutional leader; meaning he must be the leader of the entire chamber and not the leader of his party,\" Augustana University political science professor Emily Wanless said. \nWanless says a faction of divided Republicans are having a hard time finding that right person, but she believes Ryan may have a change of heart. \n\"It's kind of like a teenage girl that needed to be told she's pretty 20 times before she finally says 'ok I'm pretty enough,'\" Wanless said. \nBut the whole process of replacing Boehner right now is ugly... \n\"So Republicans, as a cohesive unit are falling apart and are unable to get 218,\" Wanless said. \n...and Wanless says it could get uglier for Republicans if Ryan doesn't run. \n\"It doesn't happen all too often, usually these go pretty routine,\" Wanless said. \nIn a statement, South Dakota representative Kristi Noem says she's looking for someone who can, \"Move forward a smart, conservative agenda.\" \nNoem has said that she'd support a candidate like Rep. Paul Ryan or Rep. Trey Gowdy. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
