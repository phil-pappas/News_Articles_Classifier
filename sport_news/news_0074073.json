City of Sunny Isles Beach Damage from an explosion Friday, Oct. 2, 2015 is visible on the rooftop level of the new Chateau Beach Residences luxury condo tower in Sunny Isles Beach. The explosion occurred when workers performed boiler-room maintenance on the rooftop of the 33-floor building at 17475 Collins Ave. MARSHA HALPER mhalper@miamiherald.com 1 of 2 Order Reprint of this Story \nTraffic is back to normal, all of the injured have been released from the hospital and the cleanup is underway. \nThat was the update from Sunny Isles Beach Mayor George “Bud” Scholl on Saturday — a day after a boiler-room explosion blew out big chunks of the 34th floor at Château Beach Residences, a just-completed waterfront luxury condo tower. \n“The two burn victims were released this morning,” Scholl said. “They had second-degree burns. It wasn’t as bad as we originally thought it was.” \nMiami-Dade Fire-Rescue has said a total of six people were injured in the blast, which is believed to have been caused by a gas explosion. They included construction workers, two county firefighters and, according to the mayor, a guest who was on the pool deck at the next-door Monaco Resort hotel. \n“The debris fell on the Monaco … he got hit by debris,” Scholl said. After being treated for minor injuries at the hospital, the man was released, city officials said. \nStill unclear: when the still-dangling slab of concrete hanging off of the Château tower will be removed. The slab has now been tied down with cables that are welded to the building, but it remains enough of a concern that the Monaco hotel remains evacuated for the foreseeable future. Initially, city officials and the construction firm, Coastal Construction, were discussing bringing in a temporary crane to removed the hanging slab, but that plan ran into a hiccup Saturday afternoon. \nAs Scholl was speaking with the Miami Herald, City Manager Christopher Russo walked over to inform him that engineers at Coastal’s office are now saying a 500-ton crane won’t be big enough. \n“They’re proposing an 800-ton crane,” Russo said. That would require bringing in the crane from out of state, and assembling it next to the condo tower, at a city park. \n“We’re talking for, like, three weeks, or more,” Russo said. \nRusso and the mayor were lukewarm to that idea. The solution to removing the hanging concrete, the city manager said, is “to be determined.” Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:29:54.498+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
