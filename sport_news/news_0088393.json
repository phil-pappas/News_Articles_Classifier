The Panthers and Ponies do not play each other during the regular season. The Ponies will advance to face No. 1 Ellsworth (11-2-1) in the quarterfinals. \nAdditional information and link to more photos from the Medomak Valley and Foxcroft Academy playoff game will appear later with this story. \nOn Saturday, under cloudy, dark, gloomy clouds and cold temperatures, the Ponies led 2-1 at halftime and added a second-half insurance goal. \nThe Panthers had plenty of scoring chances, but Pony goalie Logan Butera was up for the challenge on most occasions. And when he was out of the net area, a teammate or two would back him up and came up with a key field player-saves. \nTobias Hogfeldt tallied two goals for the visitors, one on a beautiful push up the field, move around a Panther defender and shot into the far corner of the net in the second half. Hogfeldt's first goal came with 36:32 left in the first half. \nDylan Harmon Weeks also scored for Foxcroft Acadeny with 3:40 remaining in the first half. \nCameron Leach tallied the lone Panther goal with 19:35 reamining in the first half. \nCameron Robinson played in goal in the first half and Zach Starr in net in the second half for the host Panthers. \nDuring the game, Nicholas DePatsy's throw-ins proved both dangerous around the goal and effective in jump starting the Panther offensive push up the field. Medomak Valley had many strong scoring bids in the first and second halves, none better than that by Alvaro Valls, who sent a low shot from about 30 yards out that seemed destined for the corner of the goal, but Butera scambled over, dove and tip the ball just outside the post during second-half action. \nThat looked like it might be the equalizer. \nLeach also had other scoring bids, as did several of his teammates, including DePatsy on a good look from a corner kick. \nAll of those potential game-tying goal attempts were for naught as Hogfeldt demonstrated his amazing quickness, speed and footwork again with 23:53 remaining in the second half as he pushed the ball ahead of himself, worked around a Panther defender to the corner to Starr's left and blasted a tough-angle shot into the far corner of the net to give the Ponies a 3-1 cushion. \nThat goal seemed to momentarily deflate the hard-working Panthers, but they summoned the strength and energy to make several more serious offensive pushes down the stretch. \nAs darkness descended the Panthers made one final push to score a second goal and make the game closer in the final minutes, but even though a scrum for the ball in front of the Pony net pulled Butera out of position, Foxcroft Academy's Nate Church made a nice field player-save at the goal line to provent the Panthers from finding the back of the net a second time during the 80-minute affair.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:25:57.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
