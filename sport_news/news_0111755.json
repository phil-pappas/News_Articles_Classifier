Thursday, in a sectional final, Wauseon found out for a second time just how hard it is. \nEmma Barney scored a pair of goals and Gillian Allen made three saves as the Rockets defeated Wauseon, 4-0. \n“I watched the video to see what did well or maybe didn’t do well,” said Oak Harbor coach Renee Williamson of her team’s 6-0 win earlier this season against the Indians. “We knew they had a couple of nice players that we wanted to shut down.” \nOak Harbor improved to 14-1-2 on the season and will face Bryan in the district semifinals at 5:30 p.m. Tuesday at Lake High School. Wauseon ends the season with a record of 5-9-2. \nBarney scored in the 6th and 58th minutes for Oak Harbor. \n“It’s nice to get an early goal,” Williamson said. “It gets the girls comfortable but we knew one goal is never enough.” \nIn between, Noelle Petersen scored in the 24th minute, giving the Rockets a 2-0 lead at halftime. \n“We knew they were a tough team,” Wauseon coach Jordanne Buehrer said. “The first goal they scored didn’t shake us like it did the first time we met.” \nThe Indians didn’t fade away but also couldn’t muster much offense. \n“We worked more on defense coming into this game,” Buehrer said. “We moved people around but couldn’t get any offense.” \nEmily Winters added a goal in the 63rd minute to give Oak Harbor a 4-0 lead. \n“Our defense doesn’t get enough credit,” said Williamson. “Their stats aren’t as amazing as others but they keep us in the game.” \nThe Rockets move on to play on a turf field at Lake, something Oak Harbor will key in on in practice over the next few days. \n“We have to adjust to playing on the faster field,” Williamson said. “The ball moves quicker and the passes will come quicker.” Read or Share this story: http://ohne.ws/1S0bL38 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T10:48:59.171+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
