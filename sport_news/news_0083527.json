Then in the fourth inning, he stole a run, taking an uncovered third base following a Lucas Duda walk, as the Dodgers’ infield—shifted toward right field with the lefty-swinging Duda at the plate—watched helplessly. He wound up scoring on a Travis d’Arnaud sacrifice fly.\nDeGrom, who dazzled over seven shutout innings in Game 1 of this series, lacked command of his pitches in Game 5, but made the three runs stand up.\nNoah Syndergaard pitched a scoreless seventh inning for the Mets. Closer Jeurys Familia closed out the game getting six outs for the save.\nThe Mets host the Chicago Cubs in Game 1 on the NLCS on Saturday night. The Cubs won all seven games that the two teams played this season.\n—Jared Diamond", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:01:20.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
