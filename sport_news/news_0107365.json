That’s why I’m hoping that we can participate there next year,’’ said Baldwin. “I don’t think you can get enough of really tough competition. You grow so much through adversity and the Olympic qualifier presents adversity.’’ \nSBP President Manny Pangilinan and SBP executive Ricky Vargas both said in recent interviews that they are still unsure if the country should participate in the qualifying tournament next year given that it would coincide with the Philippine Basketball Association season. They said it is more reasonable to prepare for the next FIBA Asia Championship in 2017 instead. \n“That’s just my hope and prayer that we can join. We’ll all gather to talk about that and the direction moving forward and make the best decisions,’’ Baldwin added. \nAmong those who will join the qualifying tournament next year are European powerhouses France, Canada and Serbia, among others. \nMeanwhile, Baldwin also confirmed that he’ll be in the country for the long haul and he is looking forward to a better future for the Philippine National Team with him at the helm.
