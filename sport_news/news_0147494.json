But he got in there, he mixed it up,\" Giants coach Tom Coughlin said on Monday. That Odighizuwa saw so many snaps is proof he should have a big role in the Giants' plans on the defensive line going forward.\nOdighizuwa had the third-most snaps on the line, trailing tackle/end Cullen Jenkins by just one. Starting defensive end Kerry Wynn had the most among the line (66).\nPLUS : Good, bad and ugly as Giants manhandle Bills in big win\nConsidering the other starting end, George Selvie, saw just 19 snaps, Odighizuwa should continue to have a heavy presence once end Robert Ayers Jr. returns from his hamstring injury. Odighizuwa also doubled up end Damontre Moore (23) on snaps.\n\"He made a really nice play on the quarterback where he kept the ball on the option,\" Coughlin said. \"He got himself in position a couple of times where he could have been able to apply some pressure, perhaps, with a little bit better movement to the quarterback and the passing game. He got in there, he got his feet wet.\"\nHere are some other observations from the participation report:\n• A lot more Craig Dahl : The veteran safety had just four snaps on defense in the first three games of the season, but he had a much bigger role Sunday against the physical, run-heavy Bills. Dahl registered 24 snaps at safety while starters Landon Collins and Brandon Meriweather, as per usual, hardly left the field, playing 99 percent of the defensive snaps.\n• Nikita Whitlock report : Whitlock played 23 snaps on special teams, 13 at fullback and eight at defensive tackle for a grand total of 44 snaps.\n• Readjustment at middle linebacker? : Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnuolo was asked before the game how he planned to utilize Jon Beason and Uani 'Unga going forward. He said both would play, but seemed to intimate 'Unga's role would be reduced with Beason now healthy.\nOn Sunday, Beason had 32 snaps while 'Unga had just 19. Linebacker Jonathan Casillas also had a big workload, taking 34 snaps when the Giants went with passing packages.\nOFFENSIVE SNAPS :\nT Marshall Newhouse 70\nQB Eli Manning 70\nG Justin Pugh 70\nC Weston Richburg 70\nG Geoff Schwartz 69\nWR Odell Beckham Jr. 69\nWE Rueben Randle 66\nTE Larry Donnell 65\nT Ereck Flowers 60\nWR Dwayne Harris 51\nRB Rashad Jennings 29\nRB Shane Vereen 22\nRB Andre Williams 18\nFB Nikita Whitlock 13\nTE Will Tye 12\nG John Jerry 11\nRB Orleans Darkwa 2\nT Bobby Hart 2\nWR Geremy Davis 1\nDEFENSIVE SNAPS :\nCB Prince Amukamara 75\nS Landon Collins 75\nS Brandon Meriweather 75\nDE Kerry Wynn 66\nCB Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie 65\nDT Johnathan Hankins 50\nLB Devon Kennard 49\nDE Cullen Jenkins 48\nDE Owa Odighizuwa 47\nLB Jonathan Casillas 34\nLB Jon Beason 32\nLB J.T.
