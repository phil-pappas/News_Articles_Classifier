Saxton will be paid $120,000 a year for the rest of his life in pension benefits for his 31 years working in public education, ending with his three years in the $200,000-a-year state schools chief job.\nOfficials at the Public Employee Retirement System released the pension figure at the request of The Oregonian/OregonLive.\n-- Betsy Hammond\nbetsyhammond@oregonian.com\n @chalkup", "external_links": ["http://www.nwresd.k12.or.us/", "http://www.oregon.gov/pers/Pages/index.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-21T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:39:46.122+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
