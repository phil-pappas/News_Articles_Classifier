He has been out since straining the medial collateral ligament in his left knee Sept. 27 in a win at St. Louis. \nBackup quarterback Mike Vick was ruled out. He strained his right hamstring last Sunday in a victory over Arizona and did not practice all week. \nThird-string quarterback Landry Jones replaced Vick in the third quarter and rallied the Steelers to the win and is the presumptive starter this week. \nSafety Will Allen (ankle) and defensive end Stephon Tuitt (knee) will also sit out Sunday. \n© Copyright 2015 Associated Press.
