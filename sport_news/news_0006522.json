Mandatory Credit: Phil Sears-USA TODAY Sports Jason Pierre-Paul wants to return to action as soon as he can with the New York Giants, and he will reportedly meet with the franchise early this week to sign his tender.\nAdChoices Jason Cole of Bleacher Report broke this news Sunday night, and he notes the entire thing hinges on Pierre-Paul passing his physical.\nThe Giants are in fine shape in the NFC East with a conference-leading record of 4-3 without Pierre-Paul in the lineup. Injuries to the Dallas Cowboys has really opened up the division. Philadelpha and Washington have both been quite dual-natured this year, showing up on fire one weekend and then cold as ice the next.\nIf Pierre-Paul is able to come back and make a meaningful contribution as the Giants head down the home stretch, then New York will have an excellent chance to finish with the conference crown. He wants to play “ASAP,” per Cole, though that doesn’t mean he’ll be back immediately if he does sign the tender.\nThis report is similar to the ones we heard last weekend, however, when Pierre-Paul was supposedly going to meet with the team and get his hand checked out by team doctors. The meeting never materialized, and at this point it seems foolish to put too much stock into rumors until we actually see the man making progress.\nRecent reports peg Pierre-Paul’s potential return to action around the beginning of December. We’ll continue keeping an eye on this developing story to see if anything happens.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://sportsnaut.com/2015/10/report-jason-pierre-paul-to-visit-giants-on-tuesday-still-hopes-to-play/", "https://twitter.com/JasonColeBR/status/658474001719623680", "http://www.newsday.com/sports/football/giants/giants-hopeful-jason-pierre-paul-can-return-for-final-four-games-source-says-1.10926701", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:59:58.010+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
