NEWARK – The Devils need a little practice playing with the lead.\nThey finally had a lead Tuesday night – twice – and let both advantages slip away.\nFortunately, they still had overtime to redeem themselves and pulled out a 3-2 victory over the Arizona Coyotes on Adam Larsson’s goal 43 seconds into the sudden-death session.\nLarsson finished off a 3-on-1 rush by potting a feed from Travis Zajac for his first goal of the season. Zajac had a goal and two assists on the night.\nThe Devils have won their last two games in the 3-on-3 overtime and are 2-0-1 in their last three since starting the season 0-3-0.\nMikkel Boedker forced overtime for Arizona with his tying goal with just 50.9 seconds left in regulation. With goalie Mike Smith on the bench for a sixth attacker, Boedker fired a shot from the left circle that deflected in off Devils defenseman David Schlemko in front.\nMike Cammalleri had given the Devils a 2-1 lead 7:09 into the third period. Zajac set it up, carrying into the Arizona zone before leaving a drop pass in the high slot that Cammalleri ripped into the net over Smith’s blocker for his second goal of the season.\nZajac also scored the Devils’ first goal, a shorthanded tally with 27 seconds left in the second period. Arizona’s Anthony Duclair erased the 1-0 Devils’ lead, however, with his power-play goal 47 seconds into the third.\nThe Devils talked for two days about getting off to a better start Tuesday after being plagued by poor first periods in four of their first five games, including Sunday’s 2-1 overtime victory over the Rangers. Not only had they allowed the first goal in each of their first five games, but they had yet to play with a lead.\nThe Devils didn’t quite dictate play in what was a mostly action-less first period, but their play was improved as they outshot the Coyotes 5-2 and emerged from it tied 0-0.\nThere weren’t many good scoring chances for either team in the first. Devils right wing Kyle Palmieri had a breakaway after blocking a Max Domi shot in the defensive zone, but fired wide right at 12:06. Zajac hit the crossbar with a slap shot from the high slot.\nThe Coyotes’ only credited shots on goal in the first period were both harmless ones from the left point area. They didn’t register their first of the game until there was 1:54 left in the opening period.\nThe second period had more action two it as the Devils outshot the Coyotes 12-10. Cammalleri had five shots on goal in the second period alone, but Smith stopped them all.\nDevils goalie Cory Schneider wasn’t very busy early in the second, but got a piece of Martin Hanzal’s left circle shot with his catching glove at 4:52 on what was the Coyotes’ most threatening of the game to that point.\nThe Coyotes received their second power play of the night when Eric Gelinas was sent off for high sticking Duclair at 11:17. The Coyotes had only four shots on goal in the game before that, but got three during the man advantage.\nThe Coyotes received another power play chance when Kyle Palmieri was called for interference with 1:09 left in the second. The Devils were the team to score, though, with Zajac scoring on a shorthanded 2-on-1 with Jacob Josefson.\nZajac passed to Josefson on his left and drove to the net for the return pass, which he pulled to his backhand and lifted over Smith for his first goal of the season. That lead lasted only 74 seconds, though.\nDuclair, the former Rangers’ prospect, answered for the Coyotes, however, driving to the net to take a left circle feed from Max Domi and slide it in around Schneider.\nEmail: gulitti@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:03:41.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
