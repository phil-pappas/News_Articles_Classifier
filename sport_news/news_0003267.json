(District 25-5A was known as District 25-4A before the 2014 season.) A 25-5A team was absent only from the final three polls of the 2014 season. \nSix schools — Cedar Park, Georgetown, Lake Travis, Leander, Vandegrift and Vista Ridge — have represented 25-5A in at least one of the aforementioned polls. Cedar Park has made 33 appearances from 2011 until now, but the Timberwolves were notably missing from the regular season-ending polls in 2012 and 2014. The history books will show that Cedar Park reached a state championship game in each of those seasons, winning the Class 4A, Division II title in 2012. Jessica Dukes Bastrop senior Halley McKnight slams a kill during a 2015 volleyball match. The Bears, who are coached by McKnight’s mother, Nicole Creek, top the District 26-5A standings. \nDigging up facts: Here are some notable developments from the 2015 volleyball season. Cedar Creek junior Avery Tuggle entered this week averaging 4.3 digs per set. Her twin brother, Peyton, also has excelled on defense as he leads Cedar Creek’s football team with his three interceptions. Since a 2-1 loss to Plano West on Aug. 15, Dripping Springs (36-2) has dropped a total of three sets. Up next: a District 25-5A clash against Georgetown (23-13) on Friday. For the sixth time in eight years, San Marcos has reached 20 wins in a season. Longtime San Marcos coach Michelle Moreno is a 1991 graduate of the school, and she was once a captain for the Rattlers’ volleyball, basketball and softball teams. La Grange senior setter Riley Fisbeck is a University of Texas pledge who had 11 kills and 24 assists in the 2012 Class 3A championship match that La Grange lost to Abilene Wylie. As a first baseman, she registered a hit in the 2013 Class 3A title game that La Grange’s softball team won. \nDeborah Cannon Vandegrift’s Sean Dehne, center, and teammate Culver Sumner celebrate a touchdown during a 45-13 victory over East View on Sept. 18. The fourth-ranked Vipers were one of three District 25-5A teams listed in the Associated Press Class 5A state poll this week. \nUnder the radar: Each week, we’ll introduce you to a player who is making big plays despite not having a big name. This week, we’re taking a look at Bastrop senior volleyball player Halley McKnight. \nMcKnight plays multiple positions, and she entered this week having recorded 354 kills in 33 matches while also ranking second on Bastrop’s roster in digs (346), assists (223) and aces (50). The daughter of Bastrop head coach Nicole Creek, McKnight has spent four seasons on the varsity teams at Bastrop or Canyon Lake. \nLast season, McKnight was an all-district honoree who led Bastrop to its first postseason appearance. One year later, Bastrop is 23-11 with a 10-0 mark against 26-5A teams. Lourdes M Shoaf Cedar Creek junior Avery Tuggle hits a shot during a 2015 match against Pflugerville. Tuggle, who has averaged 4.3 digs per set this season, has a twin brother, Peyton, who has intercepted three passes for Cedar Creek’s football team. \nWhere are they now? Every week, we will spotlight the collegiate accomplishments of a few of our area alums. If you know of someone who should be featured in this segment, drop me an email at danieldavis@statesman.com . Kansas sophomores Kelsie Payne (Connally, 2014) and Madison Rigdon (Pflugerville, 2014) are averaging 4.0 and 3.2 kills per set for an undefeated team. In the Big 12, Payne ranks behind only Texas senior Amy Neal (Lake Travis, 2012) in kills. Washington senior setter Katy Beals (Lake Travis, 2012) ranks eighth in her school’s record books for career assists (2,259). UTSA sophomore middle hitter Megan Slan (Leander, 2014) has 43 blocks this year, a total exceeded by only one teammate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:28:35.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
