The Rams defeated the Seahawks 34-31 in overtime. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Curry-USA TODAY Sports ESPN insider Adam Schefter is one of the most informed NFL reporters in this day and age.\nAdChoices Schefter maintains relationship with numerous players, agents and coaches to allow him to get scoops before other reporters, which is a big reason he’s so great at what he does.\nBut that doesn’t necessarily mean every NFL player is in his corner.\nSchefter recently revealed that Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman blocked him on Twitter. He released this tidbit during a media roundtable with Sports Illustrated , and had the following to say about it:\n“But the current NFL player that immediately comes to mind regarding someone who would be very successful as a sports media member would be Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman,” he said. “He’s smart, sharp, opinionated, always has strong takes on a number of intriguing subjects. Every time I’ve heard him I’ve been impressed by him. Would love to follow him on Twitter, too—if only he didn’t have me blocked.”\nThis an interesting development as Schefter is one of the most highly respected reporters among his peers and players, as he tends to just stick to breaking news and avoids putting NFL’ers on blast or delivering hot takes that could sabotage relationships. But he must’ve said something that didn’t sit well with Sherman somewhere along the line.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.si.com/more-sports/2015/10/04/roger-goodell-nfl-media-roundtable", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T11:42:06.382+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
