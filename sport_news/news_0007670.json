They have to be there virtually every day. He knows if he's a senator, he can't fight.\" \nArum's list of potential opponents for Pacquiao's swansong includes Amir Khan, Juan Manuel Marquez, Timothy Bradley, Terence Crawford and Viktor Postol. \nKhan recently claimed he had pulled out of negotiations with Pacquiao because his former gym-mate was stalling over signing a contract. \nArum, however, dismissed the Briton's claims and said the two camps are still in talks. \n\"Nobody can figure out why Khan is saying that,\" Arum added. \"I've spoken to his attorney, Robert Davis, and we're going back and forward on the numbers. \n\"The kid talks too much. It's probably why he lost the Mayweather fight. If there's no contract to sign, who's stalling who?\" Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:18:28.821+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
