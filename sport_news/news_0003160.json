All around him, people are happy it's hockey season.\nTwo nights before his debut as coach of the Detroit Red Wings, Blashill was at a rink watching his 9-year-old son play squirt hockey. People Blashill knew and people he didn't approached him, sharing the optimism he has as the Wings begin the 2015-16 campaign tonight by hosting the Toronto Maple Leafs.\n\"I think fans,\" Blashill said Thursday, \"have a good sense of what we feel internally â€” that if we do the right things, we could be a very good team.\"\nThe opener couldn't offer more in the way of motivation: Sure, the Leafs already are in the loss column and aren't considered contenders. But they are Original Six rivals, and their new coach is Mike Babcock, who spent the past decade in Detroit.\nThe Wings as an organization plan to do something to acknowledge Babcock's long tenure in Detroit, while hoping players show their happiness in having a new coach by taking it out on the Leafs.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nAlbom: How Shanahan got Babcock as new Leaf off Wings' tree\nAfter a month of preparation, from informal skates through camp through going 6-0-2 in exhibition, players burst with readiness.\n\"It is nice to be back with the guys for camp,\" center Riley Sheahan said, \"but once the season starts, it is a relief and we can focus on what we need to do, and have fun with that.\"\nForward Tomas Tatar beamed as he said: \"I've been excited all summer to get this started. I am happy the time is here.\"\nTatar gets the thrill of starting out next to newcomer Brad Richards while teenager Dylan Larkin gets the thrill of playing next to Henrik Zetterberg, who gets to celebrate his 35th birthday.\nAnother newcomer, defenseman Mike Green, keeps describing himself as \"over the moon\" with his new surroundings. \"It has been a great last two weeks,\" Green said. \"I feel like we have really narrowed down our system. I am just going to try to fit in with my game as best as possible.\"\nThe enthusiasm of which Blashill spoke is tempered by the parity that surrounds the Wings, which is why there is such an emphasis on doing things right from the first game.\n\"We focus on and Blash harps on the process of staying even-keeled and going into every game knowing what to do that day,\" Sheahan said. \"We know we can't look too far forward.\"\nBlashill divides the 82-game season into five-game segments, evaluating within each of them whether or not the Wings were a playoff team. The idea is to leave little room for error and magnify the importance of each game.\n\"We have got to get off to a good start, because we don't want to have to feel that pressure,\" forward Johan Franzen said. \"We played really good in the preseason, but that is no guarantee that it is going to be the same in the regular season, so we have to be sharp. We have to be sharp, and focused, and have fun.\"\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nDetroit Red Wings 2015-16 season preview\nBlashill has stressed structure and process, has emphasized getting into good habits.\n\"For us to be a really good hockey team,\" he said, \"you want to get the puck out of your end, and Toronto is going to make it real hard on us. So we have to do a real good job of managing the puck and getting it out of our end. Ultimately you want to spend as much time in the other team's end as possible, so we are going to have to do a good job on our forecheck and creating turnovers, and then spending o-zone time.\"\nThe Wings leave right after the Toronto game for Carolina, where they play Saturday. Every weekend in October, in fact, features a back-to-back, and there also is a trip to Western Canada.\nThree weeks after the season opener, Blashill will have two segments to evaluate, shedding a first light on this early enthusiasm.\nContact Helene St. James: hstjames@freepress.com.
