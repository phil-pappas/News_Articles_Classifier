By offering Torres an in-person hearing, the NHL has the option of suspending the 33-year old for more than five games. \nTorres was given a 10-minute misconduct and a match penalty for his hit on Silfverberg with 7:15 to go in the first period of Saturday's game against the Ducks. Replays showed that Torres' left shoulder made direct contact with Silfverberg's face after Silfverberg released the puck. \nTorres was ejected from the game for the hit. Silfverberg left the ice and did not return. Anaheim coach Bruce Boudreau said Silfverberg could have returned if needed but was held out for precautionary reasons. \nTorres was not made available to the media after the game. Sharks coach Pete DeBoer called the play \"unfortunate.\" \n\"Hopefully Silfverberg's all right,\" DeBoer said. \"It's in the hands of the league.\" \nAccording to NHL rules, any player who receives a match penalty \"shall be automatically suspended from further competition until the Commissioner has ruled on the issue.\" Advertisement \nTorres has been suspended four times in his NHL career, the latest coming in Game 1 of the second round of the 2013 playoffs. Torres hit Jarret Stoll of the Los Angeles Kings, making contact with the head, and was suspended for the remainder of the series. Stoll missed the next six games as well with head and shoulder injuries. \n\"Same player every year,\" Ducks center Ryan Kesler told reporters after the game. \"He needs to learn how to hit. That has no part in our game anymore.\" \nTorres played in two preseason games before Saturday as he returned from nearly an 18-month layoff after two surgeries on his right knee. \nTorres is technically not considered a repeat offender since he has not had any suspensions in the last 18 months. But NHL rules state that \"even if a player is not defined as a repeat offender, his past history may come into consideration when determining future supplemental discipline.\" For more on the Sharks, see the Working the Corners blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/sharks .
