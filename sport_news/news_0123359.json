The 23rd annual event -- free and open to the public -- is hosted by the Oregon chapter of the American Meteorological Society and this year features the forecasts of two meteorologists along with additional speakers.\nThe lack of snow last winter wasn't caused by a scarcity of precipitation in the Cascades (many locations saw average amounts), but by unusually warm temperatures. Most precipitation fell as rain, depriving the region of the frozen reservoir of snow that gradually melts during the warmer months, recharging reservoirs and underground aquifers.\nAccording to the Climate Prediction Center , seven states -- Washington, Oregon, California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming -- experienced their warmest average January-through-March temperatures since record-keeping began in 1895. A little more than half of Oregon remains in extreme drought according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, with the other half listed as being in severe drought.\nEl Niño conditions start with warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the eastern and central Pacific Ocean near the equator.\nThere is data to show that El Niño conditions lead to milder and warmer winters in the Northwest, with below-average rainfall. Its opposite -- La Niña -- brings colder, wetter winters and springs to the Northwest.\nBut these aren't hard and fast rules.\nDuring the 1997-98 El Niño, powerful storms that battered California leaked north into Oregon, leading to coastal erosion and, in 60 locations, record spring rains.\nNOAA scientists in their Oct. 19 update on El Niño say there is about a 95 percent chance that El Niño will continue through the winter, gradually dissipating in the spring of 2016.\nOver at NASA, scientists say there are able to study El Niño's progress and impact using technology that didn't exist in the late 1990s. They are now able to combine satellite data and observations with supercomputers and forecasting models.\nThey are also finding that El Niño can affect wildfire seasons year-to-year in the Western U.S., and that El Nino can worsen some ground-level pollution and ozone. The new data, NASA scientists say, will also allow them to be \"keenly focused\" on the persistent California drought.\nDry or wet, snowy or not, powerful storms can still develop during El Niño winters, with lashing winds and flooding rains.\n23rd annual Winter Weather Forecast Conference When: 10 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 24, 2015. Where: Oregon Museum of Science and Industry, main auditorium, 1945 S.E. Water Ave. Meeting and parking cost: This meeting is free and open to all ages. Free parking in all OMSI parking lots. Agenda: Meteorologists from across the Northwest will offer forecasts for the upcoming winter. Raffle: One person will win a $300 Davis home weather station. \"El Niño was the primary driver of last winter's weather and that is likely to be the case again this year,\" said Steve Pierce, a KOIN meteorologist and president of Oregon chapter of the American Meteorological Society. \"But not all El Niño's are the same. The most recent strong El Niño occurred in 1997-98. During that winter, we received snowfall all the way down to the [Willamette] Valley floor.\"\nRecords show that 5.6 inches fell at Portland International Airport in January 1998.\nWill Western Oregon see a repeat of that El Niño winter, with above-average rainfall and Willamette Valley snow, or will the pattern of drought, warmer-than-average temperatures and low snowpacks continue?\n\"Never count Mother Nature out,\" Piece said. \"She can be quite fickle when it comes to winter weather across the Pacific Northwest.\"\nForecasters pretty much nailed it with their predictions for last winter, predicting below-average precipitation and snowpack in the Cascades and warmer-than-average temperatures. The winter wound up as one of the least snowy seasons ever in the Cascades, with many areas snow-free by early spring.\nPrognosticators attending Saturday's forecasting conference looked at years with similar conditions before winter arrived to develop their long-range forecasts. By finding so-called analog years, they look for patterns and trends to make their predictions.\nThe 2015-16 winter predictions:\nAmanda Bowen AMANDA BOWEN, meteorologist, National Weather Service Portland.\nTemperatures: Normal to above-average.\nPrecipitation: Equal chance of 4 inches below- or above-average precipitation for the season.\nWillamette Valley snow: 8-inch snowfall event possible.\nQuote: : \"Even though El Niño conditions typically result in warmer- and drier-than-average conditions in the Pacific Northwest, very strong storms can still impact our area. We all need to be prepared for that possibility.\"\nKyle Dittmer KYLE DITTMER, hydrologist-meteorologist, Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission\nTemperatures: Near to above-normal.\nPrecipitation: Near to below-normal.\nValley snow: A 65- to 70-percent chance.\nQuote: : \"The Godzilla El Niño does not mean that we are going to get stomped on!\"\nOther presenters:\nWolf Read WOLF READ, aka the Storm King, will give a presentation on the Aug. 29 windstorm that raked the Pacific Northwest.\nRead's detailed accounts of major windstorms along the Northwest coast from British Columbia to Oregon are featured on the Washington state climatologist's website.\nAlthough Read's doctoral dissertation -- \" The Climatology and Meteorology of Windstorms That Affect Southwest British Columbia, Canada, and Associated Tree-Related Damage to the (BC Hydro) Power Grid \" -- concentrated on windstorms in Canada, his insights into Oregon and Washington damaging windstorms are riveting.\nDave Tragethon\n DAVE TRAGETHON, marketing manager for Mt. Hood Meadows ski resort , will take a stroll down snowy memory lane, examining the past 30 years of snowfall at the ski area.\nTragethon found that during the strong El Niño of 1997-98, the ski resort accumulated 385 inches of snow, about 89 percent of the average annual snowfall of 430 inches.\nDuring the previous strong El Niño winter of 1982-83, the ski resort piled-up a whopping 620 inches of snow, 144 percent of average.\n-- Stuart Tomlinson\nstomlinson@oregonian.com\n503-221-8313\n@ORweather", "external_links": ["http://hdl.handle.net/2429/54280", "http://www.climate.washington.edu/stormking/mainindex.html", "https://oregonams.wordpress.com/", "https://www.skihood.com/", "http://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/", "https://twitter.com/ORweather"], "published": "2015-10-23T13:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:11:55.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
