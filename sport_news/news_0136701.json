Shortstop Troy Tulowitzki isn't 100 per cent but he's playing.\nThat's the skinny on the Blue Jays' lineup for the opener of their best-of-five series against the Texas Rangers.\nBen Revere leads off, followed by Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista, Edwin Encarnacion, Tulowitzki, Justin Smoak, Russell Martin, Ryan Goins and Kevin Pillar.\nEncarnacion is designated hitter while Smoak holds down first base.\nGibbons, who said his lineup is as expected, spoke to his troops prior to the game but declined to share his message.\n\"'Good luck boys, let's eat,\" he joked. \"It was almost as simple as that.\"\nDespite hacking due to a chest cold that is making the rounds in the city, Gibbons said he was excited and the team was ready.\nTulowitzki is back from a cracked shoulder and will be back in the fifth batting spot. He hit seventh when he returned for two games late in the season.\n\"He's not 100 per cent but he's sure good enough,\" said Gibbons.\nToronto ace David Price starts against Rangers right-hander Yovani Gallardo.\nThe roof will be closed for the game at the Rogers Centre.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T15:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:10:49.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
