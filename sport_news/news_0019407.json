(AP Photo/Mark Zaleski) \nORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) — Though Buffalo Bills starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor has a sprained left knee, coach Rex Ryan won’t entirely rule him out from playing against Cincinnati on Sunday. \nRyan provided the update before the team’s practice on Wednesday. Ryan said Taylor would practice on a limited basis, with backup EJ Manuel taking a majority of the snaps. \nRyan disputed reports that Taylor could miss as many as three weeks because of the injury. \n“That’s news to me. That may or may not be the case,” Ryan said. “It’s certainly not official. So we’ll see how it goes.” \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:09:33.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
