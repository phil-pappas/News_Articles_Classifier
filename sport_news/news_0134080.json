We'll see. I'll just let the game come to me and hope something happens.\"\nShepard again is the Sooners' top receiver, but OU and quarterback Baker Mayfield have been able to spread the ball around more in the first season of the Air Raid offense.\nShepard has 20 catches for 321 yards and three touchdowns, an average of 80.1 yards a game.\nDede Westbrook has 17 catches for 282 yards, and Durron Neal 14 for 260 yards. Running back Joe Mixon and tight end Mark Andrews have also been used as receiving targets.\nLast season, Shepard had 51 catches for 970 yards, and more than 450 yards than Neal, who had the second-best receiving total.\n\"I wouldn't say I felt pressure [in 2014],\" Shepard said. \"I'm used to that, and I love getting the ball. I didn't feel pressure, but it's great to have other weapons with you.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @kHairopoulos", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/kHairopoulos"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:09:51.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
