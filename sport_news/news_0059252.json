Virginia By Tim Everson October 10, 2015 \nAfter dropping two straight road matches, the Kansas State volleyball team got back on track Saturday with a straight-set (25-20, 25-20, 25-23) sweep of West Virginia at Bramlage Coliseum. \nIt was the Wildcats’ second straight home sweep and seventh straight-set victory of the season for K-State, which improved to 10-7 overall and 2-3 in the Big 12. K-State also extended its home winning streak to five matches, while improving to 11-0 in Bramlage. \n“One of our priorities was to be better in transition,” K-State head coach Suzie Fritz said. “So, we were pleased with that. I think we got a lot out of our serving. Defensively, just overall, we did some nice things. Our blocking was a little bit more disciplined. I thought we were a little bit better on that side of the ball then we were offensively.” \nLeading the way offensively for K-State was freshman outside hitter Alyssa Schultejans, who was the only Wildcat to record double-digit kills and points in the match. \n“(Schultejans) was so good,” KSU senior setter Katie Brand said. “The thing is, we had been working on all week on building (Schultejans’) confidence and seeing what else we could get out her, and then she comes out and has a performance like that.” \nFollowing close behind Schultejans was fellow freshman outside hitter Macy Flowers who, in addition to Schultejans, led the team in hitting percentage at .636 with eight kills. \n“That’s a key right now for us,” Brand said. “If we can build some of the younger girls’ confidence so when they get into those bigger games, they know they can do it.” \nK-State junior outside hitter Katie Reininger teamed with Brand to record a combined 16 kills. \nThe first set was primarily dominated by the Wildcats, who led almost the entire way. K-State out-hit the Mountaineers .294 to .222. \nWest Virginia got within one late on a kill by Caleah Wells, but K-State took care of business, spearheaded by two kills from Brooke Sassin to close out the set with a 4-0 run and get the set win. \nThe second set was much more contested, as it featured six lead changes. WVU regained a 17-16 lead off a Kersten Kober attack error, but the Wildcats found a way to turn it on again, led by unanswered points inside a 9-3 overall run. \nSassin recorded two aces on that run, which allowed the Wildcats to close out the Mountaineers and get the 25-20 win. \nThe final and decisive game was pretty much the same story, as West Virginia tied everything up at 18 after K-State had controlled most of the way. But, another 5-0 run pushed the Wildcats to a big enough lead that even a late 5-2 surge by the Mountaineers to close out the match wouldn’t be enough. \nWith that late push, it marked the third time in a match that the Wildcats would go on at least a 4-0 run late to close a match. \n“What we talk about a lot is inner confidence,” Brand said. “So, as long as we just stay calm, there’s kind of a Zen out on the court, instead of everyone getting anxious and a little bit tight.” \nThe Wildcats head back on the road again this Friday for a matchup at Oklahoma, beginning at 6 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:36:57.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
