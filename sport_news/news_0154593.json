So, for now, veteran fourth-liner Tanner Glass ($1.45 million salary-cap figure) and underperforming import Emerson Etem ($850,000) remain among the 14 on the roster rather than being exposed to waivers in order to be reassigned to Hartford (AHL).\nDefenseman Raphael Diaz ($700,000) – clearly outplayed by McIlrath in training camp – and forward Jayson Megna ($600,000) were placed on waivers on Friday and, if they clear by today at noon, will be reassigned to Hartford.\nGorton estimated it was \"50-50\" the Rangers will be able to retain Diaz, 29, who played 56 games for the Flames last season after ending the 2013-14 with the Rangers.\n\"I think he's an NHL player,\" Gorton said. \"I hope that he's here for us.\"\nBut McIlrath's superior training camp performance and the risk of losing him and his $600,000 contract could not be overlooked.\nThe 6-foot-5, 236-pounder has played just three NHL regular-season games, including one last season, and while the 23-year-old's physical presence has never been in question, his skating and mobility have after dislocating his kneecap in 2012.\n\"There's been an evolution in his game, he's come a long way,\" Gorton said. \"It's important everyone on the team know we have players coming and pushing all the time. From a business aspect, younger players make less money and that helps.\"\nEven though he'll start the season as the extra defenseman not expected to play on a regular basis, McIlrath took satisfaction in cracking the varsity roster.\n\"It's been a pretty long road to get to this point,\" McIlrath said. \"I worked really hard and that makes it more gratifying. I couldn't be happier. [The coaching staff] said I made the team based on playing a simple, competitive game. The way I'll stay up here is if I continue doing that.\"\n\"He really progressed from what we remembered last year,\" Vigneault said. \"You need young players to force your hands sometimes.\"\nThat's clearly what the Rangers had hoped Etem would do.\nAcquired from the Ducks in the off-season for speedy left wing Carl Hagelin, traded because of salary-cap concerns, Etem, 23, has seemed sluggish in his skating and work in both zones.\n\"His camp has been pretty average, I think he knows that,\" Gorton said. \"We've scouted him as a player and liked what we've seen. I have faith in time he's going to show that to us.\"\nBRIEF: Glass was on the ice for the start of practice on Friday but limped off, still bothered after blocking a shot with his foot in Wednesday night's preseason finale against the Bruins.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:42:37.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
