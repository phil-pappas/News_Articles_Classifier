He ran 14 yards for another touchdown with 33 seconds left in the first quarter. \n\"He's a dude,\" Warriors offensive line coach Buck James said. \"He's a dude.\" \nCrockett's game-winning touchdown capped a 22-point rally by Little Rock Christian (7-0, 4-0 5A-West), which trailed 42-21 after senior quarterback Harold Ross threw a 15-yard touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Alex Massey with 5:49 left in the third quarter. \nThe Panthers (4-3, 3-1) couldn't finish off the upset as the Warriors scored touchdowns on their final three possessions on drives of 55, 91 and 89 yards. \n\"It was a good high school football game, if you weren't on that sideline,\" Greenbrier Coach Randy Tribble said about his team. \"It was a great game most of the time. Our kids played their hearts out.\" \nRoss, battling a bruised foot, completed 20 of 28 passes for 293 yards and 3 touchdowns (54, 28 and 15 yards). He also ran 1 yard for a touchdown. Sophomore tailback Spencer Sutterfield ran for touchdowns of 1 and 28 yards in the first half. \nThe Panthers, who led 35-21 at halftime, finished with 402 yards on 53 plays. \nThe Warriors finished with 639 total yards and 33 first downs on 96 plays. They rushed 74 times for 414 yards. \nSenior tailback Carlos Stewart ran 14 times for 66 yards and 3 touchdowns (8, 18 and 5 yards). \nStewart's 5-yard touchdown run drew the Warriors within 42-28 with 55 seconds left in the third quarter. \nSenior quarterback Kyron Sanders completed 18 of 22 passes for 225 yards, including a 31-yard touchdown to junior wide receiver Austin Guymon to make it 42-35 with 5:43 left in the game. \nSanders was intercepted twice, the second at the goal line on Little Rock Christian's first possession of the second half. \nRoss threw his 15-yard touchdown pass four plays later to stretch Greenbrier's lead to 42-21 midway through the third quarter. \n\"We had a staff meeting right after that,\" Warriors Coach Jeff Weaver said of the interception. \"We said, 'Look, this is what we're doing; this is what they can't stop.' And we kept doing it -- that was run the football.\" \nEspecially in the closing seconds. \n\"We were going for two,\" Weaver said. \"We were gassed.\" \nLittle Rock Christian, which breezed the first six weeks this fall, is off to its best start since 2007, when the Warriors finished 13-1, losing to 5A-West rival Greenwood in the state championship game. \nLittle Rock Christian began playing varsity football in 2002. \n5A-SOUTH \nHOT SPRINGS LAKESIDE 28, HOPE 26 \nHOT SPRINGS — Caleb Dean hauled in a 40-yard touchdown pass with 44 seconds left and Colt Housley tacked on the tie-breaking two-point conversion as Hot Springs Lakeside (6-1, 4-0) moved atop the 5A-South standings with a victory over Hope (5-2, 3-1). \nThe Rams appeared out of luck after losing the ball after an 18-play drive that reached the 3-yard line. But they got back into it on Housley’s 1-yard touchdown with 5:03 left that made it 26-20. Lakeside held Hope on a three-andout series to set up the winning drive, with Alexander throwing the tying touchdown pass on fourth and 11. Caden Vaughan sealed the victory with his second interception of the quarter. \nHope’s McTelvin Agim returned a kickoff 49 yards for a touchdown \nSports on 10/17/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:06:41.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
