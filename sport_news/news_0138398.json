However, not a day goes by without the Indian cinema icon Amitabh Bachchan remembering his friend. Despite having a 22-year age gap, the duo had a very strong friendship. Sources say that when Big B learnt about Aadesh's terminal illness, not only was he heartbroken but he also took it upon himself to learn everything that he could about the late composer's medical condition. A source close to both the actor and the composer, says that it was the Bollywood icon who came forward and bore all the expenses of Aadesh's treatment in India and overseas.\nBut that is still not what their friendship was all about. It was the fact that though he was devastated with the news of Aadesh's illness, Big B took it upon himself to keep the music composer's spirits high. Late into the night, the megastar would go to Aadesh's music studio and the two of them would create tunes and sing. Never once did the veteran let it be known to Aadesh that he had any count to worry. What is most touching now is the fact that Bachchan has roped in Aadesh's son, Anivesh, to compose music for one of his upcoming television shows , which is about to go on air shortly.\nFor latest Bollywood updates follow us on Twitter >>> @TOIEntertain\nFor the latest in Bollywood news, like us on Facebook >>> TOIEntertain\nWATCH: Aishwarya Rai Bachchan: Amitabh Bachchan will forever be iconic - TOI\nPiku Amazon.in : INR 327.00 Buy now Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["http://gaana.com/artist/amitabh-bachchan", "https://www.facebook.com/TOIEntertain", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities", "https://twitter.com/TOIEntertain", "http://www.amazon.in/Piku-Amitabh-Bachchan/dp/B010SDQ98K%3FSubscriptionId%3DAKIAJP4GPDYQHXPFUOWQ%26tag%3Dtimofind-21%26linkCode%3Dxm2%26camp%3D2025%26creative%3D165953%26creativeASIN%3DB010SDQ98K", "http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51Cx6gmVjuL._SL160_.jpg", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/64FggggSlSk"], "published": "2015-10-10T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:33:32.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
