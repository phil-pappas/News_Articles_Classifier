Bouchard, who was a runner-up at Wimbledon last year, has suffered severe pain and economic loss after the Sept. 4 incident, she said in the federal lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn that seeks unspecified monetary damages. The 21-year-old Bouchard had just won a match against Dominika Cibulkova when she returned to the locker room at the Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Queens shortly after 10 p.m. Minutes later, she slipped and fell on the tile floor of a physiotherapy room that is inside the locker room, slamming her head against the ground.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:02:41.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
