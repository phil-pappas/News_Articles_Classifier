The Crimsons (5-3) will try to end one of the longest streaks in the Central State Eight Conference when they host 5-3 Chatham Glenwood in a 7 p.m. game at Kraushaar-Rosenberger Field. Since a 1994 Jacksonville win, Glenwood has had the Crimsons’ number in a 21-game win streak, which includes a 48-47 win at Jacksonville in the second round of the 2010 Class 5A playoffs. Jacksonville has more wins in the last 23 years (three, including playoffs) over SHG than it does against Glenwood. But Jacksonville can’t seem to shake the Titans. “For me, I know we’ve had some tremendous games against them and we haven’t come out on top,” Jacksonville coach Mark Grounds said. “As a head coach, is it something that I’m reminded about every year until we beat them? Yeah, it is.” The silver lining for Grounds is that the streak is discussed. “You hear about the Jacksonville-Glenwood (streak) because we’ve been fortunate enough to turn Jacksonville into a successful program,” Grounds said. “If we were 2-7 every year, no one would be talking about the fact that Jacksonville hasn’t beaten Glenwood.” GOOD SIGNS: Last week, the Titans sat at 4-3 with road games against two teams with winning records. Not only was Glenwood trying to get a fifth win to become playoff eligible, but the team was hoping to find consistency and signs that the Titans could maybe make an extended postseason run. “I’d like to be a playoff team, but I’d like to go into the playoffs playing well,” Glenwood coach Dan Rourke said last week. “I don’t want to go to the playoffs and just be in there on five wins. I feel like this team has so much potential. I would like for these guys to see and do what I think they can do and to realize that.” And leaving Decatur Friday with a 56-31 win over Eisenhower, Glenwood had shown — at least for one game — the promise that Rourke knew was there but few had actually seen. NO SURPRISE: First-year Lincoln coach Seth Bass said that he hasn’t been caught off-guard on anything this season, except how difficult scoring would be. “We’ve struggled to score on offense a little more than I expected, but everything else with the inexperience and attitude-type things have been right as I expected,” Bass said. Page 2 of 2 - The Railers are 0-8 and play at Lanphier (3-5) Thursday. “I think all our kids see the big picture and see what we can be,” Bass said. “They see that most of the mistakes that we made this year have been as a result of inexperience. They see that’s something that can be fixed in the coming years.” RARE THURSDAY: Thanks to a shared facility and limits by the IHSA on Saturday games in Week 9, Lincoln and Lanphier are playing Thursday at Memorial Stadium. Springfield High (2-6) hosts Eisenhower (5-3) on Friday at Memorial. The last CS8 game played on a Thursday came in Week 9 of the 2011 season, when Lincoln traveled to Memorial Stadium and lost 49-6 to Sacred Heart-Griffin. SOLID UP FRONT: Before Friday’s loss to Glenwood, Eisenhower coach Drew Wagers said the Panthers’ offensive line had done a great job through the first seven weeks. “Up front, I couldn’t ask for better protection,” Wagers said. “We may not be as big as we’ve been in years past (on the offensive line), but they’re smart and that’s what I like.” SHG-ROCHESTER VIDEO: “Friday Night Rivals” on WBUI (CW23) won’t have the biggest game in the area when 8-0 SHG travels to 8-0 Rochester in Leonard Bowl VI. Instead, Sinclair Broadcasting Group will feature Athens at Pleasant Plains. But SHG and Rochester fans unable to go will still be able to watch the game online at rochesterrocketstv.com . The game starts at 7 p.m. at Rocket Booster Stadium. — Contact Ryan Mahan: ryan.mahan @sj-r.com, 788-1546, twitter.com/RyanMahanSJR .
