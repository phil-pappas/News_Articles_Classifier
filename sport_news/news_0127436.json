But the three-time Olympic medalist later announced she would come out of retirement if she had a chance at winning gold in Rio. \nIsinbayeva said her preparations for Rio were “going well” but declined to elaborate on her participation in competition leading up to the Games. \nIsinbayeva, who won gold at the 2004 Summer Games in Athens and again at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, took a sabbatical in 2010 after finishing off the podium at the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Athletics Championships in Doha. \nShe returned to competition in February 2011, promptly winning a fourth world indoor title in Istanbul before taking bronze at the 2012 London Olympics. \nIsinbayeva is the first woman to clear the 5-meter bar, setting her existing record of 5.06m in Zurich in 2009.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:21:53.214+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
