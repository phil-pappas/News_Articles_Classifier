By MICHAEL MAROTAP Sports Writer \nBLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) - Ezekiel Elliott scored on touchdown runs of 55, 65 and 75 yards in the second half, and No. 1 Ohio State came up with a final goal line stand to escape with a 34-27 win over Indiana on Saturday. \nElliott had a career best 274 yards on 23 carries. \nThe Buckeyes (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten) extended the FBS' longest winning streak to 18 in a row. \nIndiana (4-1, 0-1) lost the nation's leading rusher, Jordan Howard, in the first half and its starting quarterback, Nate Sudfeld, in the third quarter. But the Hoosiers made things difficult for the defending national champions. \nElliott wiped out a 10-6 deficit with the 55-yard run, a 17-13 deficit with the 65-yard run and appeared to have sealed it when his 75-yarder made it 34-20. \nBut the Buckeyes still needed to break up a pass in the end zone on the final play. \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:17:31.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
