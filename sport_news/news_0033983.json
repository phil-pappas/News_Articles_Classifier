It always does -- or always has since Mike Garrett made Pete Carroll about his fifth choice to replace Paul Hackett 15 years ago. \nThe brand itself is enough to get the Trojans past the loss of Steve Sarkisian. The school announced on Monday the firing of the second-year coach, one day after he was suspended indefinitely. This comes less than two months after Sarkisian's ugly â€˜Salute to Troy' episode. \nIn some ways, Monday's announcement sort of clears the deck. Chip Kelly's name has been batted around like badminton shuttlecock. Until Monday, USC had a sitting coach. Not now. \nKelly now makes so much sense for the Trojans it hurts. His NCAA show cause order expired on Dec. 26, 2014. If he or the Eagles were of a mind to separate, Kelly would be available to reinvent himself on the West Coast. \nDespite this ugly episode, USC will still be able to recruit. The talent will sustain the program because, again, it always has. Matt Barkley honored his commitment and stayed even after the crippling Reggie Bush penalties were announced. \nUSC is probably better than anyone at selling a vision, a future, the weather, The Coliseum. If you want to dream, the place is Disneyland in shoulder pads. None of that changes as of now. But if USC gets the right guy, all of it will be weaponized again. \nWould anyone be surprised if -- with Kelly or another big name in place -- the Trojans win the Pac-12 next season? Change seems inevitable now. Even if Sark had addressed whatever issue caused him to take Sunday's leave, USC would have been left with his admission he mixed alcohol and medication at the preseason event. \nLike that was no big deal. \nFootball will recover. I'm not sure about athletic director Pat Haden's reputation. The 62-year-old former Trojan quarterback is totally devoted to his school. He is a Rhodes Scholar who played and lived with class. \nBut Haden had a chance to end this. He had a chance to tell Sarkisian to take a leave of absence back in August, perhaps even fire him. But he didn't. \nNow he's left with uncertainty about his coach, his program and perhaps his own future. Following the August episode, Sark kind of hinted at getting help by didn't say anything definite. \nHe was allowed to address things on his terms. Look where that decision got Haden and USC. The Trojan seniors will be looking at their fifth coach. Offensive coordinator Clay Helton is in his second go-around as an interim coach. No one at USC signed up for this mess. \nSooner or later, president Max Nikias will come to the realization that a lot of this didn't have to be. What was the huge attraction with Sarkisian coming from Washington where he was five games over .500 in five years? \nWhy didn't Haden take stronger action back in August? If his superiors have not asked him that question by the time you read this, Haden will continue to lead from behind. \nFootball? This is USC. It always seems to survive. Sarkisian has taken a leave of absence from USC. (USATSI)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:14:27.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
