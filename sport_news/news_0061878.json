Comment Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 10:31 AM Updated at 10:35 AM Posted Oct. 15, 2015 at 10:31 AM Updated at 10:35 AM CLEVELAND Officials say Cuyahoga County is preparing to foot the bill for just over $60 million worth of repairs and upgrades to the homes of both the Cleveland Indians and Cavaliers. Northeast Ohio Media Group reports the northeast Ohio county is required to cover the cost of renovations per its leases with Cleveland’s professional baseball and basketball franchises. Among the repairs are a new scoreboard for the Indians at Progressive Field and a new roof for the Cavaliers’ Quicken Loans Arena. County Executive Armond Budish has sponsored legislation introduced Tuesday that would cover expenses through the sale of $65 million in bonds to be repaid by Cuyahoga County’s 20-year tax on alcohol and cigarettes. Distribution of the so-called “sin tax” is expected to raise $260 million for Cleveland’s sports arenas.
