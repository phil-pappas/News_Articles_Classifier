And following the Chicago Cubs' loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in the National League Championship Series this week, the hard-luck Cubs will have to wait at least one more year. \nSome Cubs fans have waited for that title almost as long as the Cubs themselves have. Harry Hickman, a Hattiesburg native and former scout for the Cubs organization for more than a decade in the 1950s and '60s, is one such fan. \nHickman, 87, played American Legion baseball in Hattiesburg when there was no high school team there for which to play. After joining the Navy straight out of high school in 1945, then attending Southern Miss following his service, Hickman eventually found himself in the Cubs organization's employ as a scout in 1952. He scouted for talent in the Chicago area as well as the rest of Illinois, Indiana and parts of Wisconsin, attending Chicago's home games and doing his scouting when the Cubs were away. \n\"When the team was on the road, that's when I'd scout my territory,\" Hickman said. \nHickman later relocated to Hattiesburg to scout for Chicago in Louisiana, Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee for three years. \nThe former scout has seen a lot change in the 63 years since Cubs manager Wid Matthews first hired him. \n\"We had about 12 or 15 people in the (scouting) office up there (at Wrigley Field),\" he said. \"They must have 50 this year. Amazing how they've grown and changed – for the better, though.\" \nDuring his time scouting for Chicago, Hickman was involved in recruiting then-household names – most notably, perhaps, being a player who was with Chicago for only a short time before being traded: Lou Brock. The Hall of Famer and six-time All-Star is likely best known for breaking Ty Cobb's all-time stolen base record during his time playing left field for the St. Louis Cardinals, who acquired him in a trade with the Cubs. \nHickman was quick to point out that he was not the one to discover Brock as a talent. \n\"I just took him up to the office and signed him,\" he said. \nCloser to home, Hickman also brought the talent of former Southern Miss shortstop and 2014 M-Club Hall of Fame inductee Ken Fischer to then-athletic director Reed Green's attention. \n\"I didn't think he (Fischer) was a Major League prospect at the time,\" Hickman said. \"But Reed Green was athletic directer (at Southern Miss) at the time, and he and I had become real close friends. He called me and said they were looking for an infielder for the baseball team at Southern. (Fischer) did real well for four years out here at shortstop.\" \nHickman remains an avid fan not just of the Cubs, but of the game of baseball. Until a stroke 12 years ago limited his mobility, he and his wife, Carol, regularly attended spring training games in addition to regular season Cubs games, but the last time Hickman made a trip to Wrigley Field was four years ago. He also gave up his season tickets for Southern Miss baseball games at Pete Taylor Park only recently, within the last two years. \nLike many Cubs fans, Hickman watched this year's Cub squad with hope and anticipation, but 80 years of Chicago fandom has taught him to temper his expectations. \n\"For 80 years, I've been saying 'Wait 'til next year, wait 'til next year,' Well next year was really this year. \n\"I'm surprised they got as far as they did this year,\" he added. \"But I think they've got a great manager (in Jed Hoyer). He did a heck of a job handling all those rookies.\" 1 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://hatne.ws/1RZXVh9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:48:47.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
