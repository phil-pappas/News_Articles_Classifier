Barrett ran for three in red-zone situations and wide receiver and former quarterback Braxton Miller caught a touchdown pass. \nMaryland quarterback Perry Hills, in his first start in four games, ran for touchdowns late in the first half and to open the third quarter to rally Maryland into a 21-21 tie. \nNo. 3 Baylor 66, Kansas 7 \nLAWRENCE, Kan. -- Seth Russell passed for 246 yards and three touchdowns and Shock Linwood added 135 yards rushing as Baylor stomped Kansas. \nRussell and Linwood played only in the first half.

Scott scored on a 3-yard off-tackle run with 43 seconds to play, giving the Spartans their school-record 11th straight conference road win. \nRutgers bid for a tying score ended at midfield when quarterback Chris Laviano inexplicably spiked the ball on fourth down with three seconds to play. \nNo. 5 Utah 30, No. 23 Cal 24 \nSALT LAKE CITY -- Utah hung on to defeat California when a pass by Jared Goff was broken up on fourth-and-5 in the final seconds. \nDevontae Booker was the star on homecoming night for the Utes with 267 all-purpose yards, including a season-high 222 rushing yards, two touchdowns and a fumble. \nGoff threw a career-high five interceptions but completed 25 of 47 passes for 340 yards and two touchdowns. In all, Utah's defense had six takeaways. \nCal cut the deficit to 27-24 with 2:03 remaining in the third quarter after Booker's third-quarter fumble led to a 4-yard touchdown run by running back Tre Watson. \nNo. 6 Clemson 43, Georgia Tech 24 \nCLEMSON, S.C. -- Deshaun Watson threw for 265 yards and two touchdowns and the Tigers' defense throttled the Yellow Jacket's potent option rushing attack. \nClemson, which has led the Football Bowl Subdivision in tackles for loss each of the last two seasons, had 10 tackles for loss and held the Yellow Jackets to 57 yards rushing. \nGeorgia Tech entered the game ranked sixth nationally with an average of 311 yards per game. \nNo. 7 LSU 45, South Carolina 24 \nBATON ROUGE, La. - Heisman Trophy candidate Leonard Fournette raced 87 yards for a touchdown on the second play of the second half, shredding the Gamecocks' defense for 158 yards on 20 carries in three quarters, to lift the Tigers to victory. \nThe game, which was originally scheduled as a South Carolina home game but shifted to Baton Rouge on Wednesday because of record flooding in the South Carolina midlands, showcased LSU's relentless running attack. \nLSU amassed 396 rushing yards on 54 carries, including 209 on 17 carries in the third quarter in which the Tigers scored touchdowns on drives of 90, 80 and 75 yards. \nNo. 8 Alabama 27, Arkansas 14 \nTUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- The Hogs did their best to spoil Homecoming Weekend for the Crimson Tide, but in the end the Tide wore down Arkansas and pulled away. \nWith Arkansas leading late in the third quarter, Jake Coker hit freshman Calvin Ridley in stride for an 81-yard touchdown and Alabama had a lead it would not relinquish. \nFollowing a failed fake punt by Arkansas, Coker led another scoring drive that resulted in another Tide touchdown. Derrick Henry added a 1-yard touchdown late in the fourth quarter to put the game out of reach. \nTexas 24, No. 10 Oklahoma \nDALLAS -- Unranked, the Longhorns used a potent rushing attack to rack up 313 yards and a stifling defense to stun the Sooners in the Red River Rivalry game at the Cotton Bowl. \nThe Longhorns salvaged what seemed to be a lost season by dominating in the trenches against the previously unbeaten Sooners. \nTexas got 117 yards on the ground by running back D'Onta Foreman on just nine carries and 115 more from quarterback Jerrod Heard. \nNo. 11 Florida 21, Missouri 3 \nCOLUMBIA, Mo. -- The Gators scored touchdowns on two of its first three drives and that all they would need against the Tigers. \nFor good measure, Florida's defense added the final points of the night on a 40-yard touchdown return by Jalen Tabor after an interception of Missouri quarterback Drew Lock. \nFlorida's defense stymied Missouri's offense all night, forcing the Tigers to go 1-14 on third downs and 0-1 on fourth. \nNo. 12 Florida State 29, Miami 24 \nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. - Dalvin Cook rushed for 222 yards and two touchdowns and also had a receiving score to lead the Seminoles. \nThe running back's huge performance helped the Seminoles beat the Hurricanes for the sixth straight year. \nMiami quarterback Brad Kaaya threw for 405 yards and three touchdowns. \nNo. 18 Michigan 38, No. 13 Northwestern 0 \nANN ARBOR, Mich. - The Wolverines hit the accelerator on the opening drive and the Wildcats left with tire marks on their backs by the time the final seconds ticked off the clock at Michigan Stadium on Saturday afternoon. \nMichigan's fifth consecutive victory set the stage for a showdown with rival Michigan State next week and might have opened some eyes to the Wolverines as a legitimate contender. \nThe Wolverines have not allowed a point in the last 12 quarters, outscoring the opposition 97-0. The Wildcats mustered 38 yards on 25 running plays (1.5 yards per rush), had 168 total yards and converted just two of 13 third downs. \nNo. 14 Ole Miss 52, New Mexico State 3 \nOXFORD, Miss. -- Mississippi entered its annual homecoming game as a 45-point favorite over winless New Mexico State and the Rebels left Vaught-Hemingway Stadium with an easy win. \nIt was a better result than last week when the Rebels suffered their first loss of the season at the hands of the Florida Gators in The Swamp. \nThe Aggies are one of the lowest-rated teams in the FBS ranks, allowing 182 points to their opponents in the first four weeks. \nNo. 15 Notre Dame 41, Navy 24 \nSOUTH BEND, Ind. -- C.J. Prosise rushed for 129 yards and three touchdowns as the Irish ran past the Midshipmen. \nDeShone Kizer passed for 281 yards and one touchdown and ran for one more.

He completed only 2-of-4 passes for 16 yards. \nTennessee 38, No. 19 Georgia 31 \nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. -- The Volunteers' second-half struggles have been well-chronicled so far this fall, but against the Bulldogs, that trend was reversed. \nIn two of their previous three losses, the Vols had blown double-digit leads. Not this time. \nTrailing 24-3 late in the second quarter, Tennessee roared back, scoring four straight touchdowns. The final came on a 2-yard touchdown pass from Dobbs to running back Alvin Kamara, putting the Vols up 31-24. \nNo. 21 Oklahoma State 33, West Virginia 26, OT \nMORGANTOWN, W.Va. - Backup quarterback J.W. Walsh scored on a fourth-down keeper in overtime and the Cowboys beat the Mountaineers. \nOklahoma State was in danger of losing to West Virginia for the third straight season after blowing a 15-point halftime lead. But the Cowboys found a way, just as they did against Texas and Kansas State the past two weeks. \nWest Virginia's Skyler Howard ran 3 yards for a touchdown with 2:44 left in regulation to tie the score at 26, but his fourth-and-11 pass in overtime fell incomplete in the end zone. \nNo. 22 Iowa 29, Illinois 20 \nIOWA CITY, Iowa -- Iowa moved to 2-0 in the Big Ten and 6-0 overall for the first time since 2009. \nThis marks only the third time the Hawkeyes have started 6-0 since 1985 and only the eighth time in school history they have opened a season by winning their first six games. \nJordan Canzeri ran for 256 yards on a school-record 43 carries. Wes Lunt passed for 317 yards and a touchdown for Illinois (4-2). \nNo. 24 Toledo 38, Kent State 7 \nTOLEDO, Ohio -- Playing as a ranked team for the first time in three years, the Rockets recovered from an early mistake and rolled over Kent State. \nThe Rockets fell behind 7-0 in the first quarter before taking command and winning their eighth straight game. \nRunning back Terry Swanson rushed 14 times for 161 yards and a touchdown. Teammate Kareem Hunt, playing in just his second game this season after being slowed by a hamstring injury, scored two touchdowns and finished with 85 yards on 16 carries. \nNo. 25 Boise State 41, Colorado State 10 \nFORT COLLINS, Colo. -- The Broncos used a big-play offense and opportunistic defense to blow out the Rams. \nThe Broncos scored first-half touchdowns on plays of 53, 56 and 85 yards and used a 40-yard pass to set up their only touchdown of the third quarter. \nTrue freshman quarterback Brett Rypien topped 300 passing yards for the second time in three starts and sophomore tailback Jeremy McNichols, who led the nation with 11 rushing touchdowns heading into Saturday, added two more scores on the ground.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T14:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:29:25.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
