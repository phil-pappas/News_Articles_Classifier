A former NFL defensive back and 13-year head coach at Bethune-Cookman, Wyatt has the vitality of a man 20 years younger. That’s a good thing because building the EWC football program back up to where school president Nat Glover, a former Tigers linebacker and Jacksonville sheriff, wants it is going to take a lot of energy. “We’re going to be all right, we’re going to turn this program around,” Wyatt said following Saturday’s 49-28 loss to Jacksonville University at Milne Field in the Jacksonville Classic. “It’s just going to take some time.” A lot of coaches and administrators have been trying to do that since EWC reinstated football in 2001, after a 34-year absence, with mediocre results. Between the school’s lack of financial resources and negative attention on past accreditation problems, it’s been a constant uphill fight. Wyatt inherited a mess late in the 2013 season, taking over a 0-7 team from Brad Bernard. The Tigers won two of their last four games, then had a respectable 5-6 record last year. But more adversity hit this season when starting quarterback Tyler Mahla was sidelined by an ankle/knee injury in Week 3. The Tigers absorbed the loss against JU, which got six TD passes from Kade Bell, but EWC refused to go away quietly. Had it not been for Tiger receiver Chris Anthony’s fumble that JU recovered in the end zone with 9:16 remaining, keeping the score 42-28, EWC might have had a chance to spring a huge upset for its economically challenged program. “We played the best game we could have played under the circumstances,” Wyatt said. “Take away the turnovers [EWC had four] and mental mistakes on defense, we’re right there.” Unfortunately, it’s going to take a lot more than a spirited effort against a local rival to elevate EWC football. The underfunded Tigers have no football facility (home games are played at Stanton High), a small weight room on their Kings Road campus, and only about 13 scholarships out of a maximum 24 for the NAIA Division I level. Nobody is more emotionally invested in rectifying that dilemma than Glover. After spending a good portion of his adult life trying to combat crime, the 72-year-old ex-sheriff is committed to campaigning for the resources EWC needs to improve football and the entire campus life. “Shame on me if I come to Edward Waters and not leave the school and athletic program better than I found it,” said Glover. “I really have a passion to do that. “I’d like to get to the point where we could give out full scholarships and have football facilities. It’s going to take a collective effort from us and civic leaders. We have to make sure we have a credible product to sell. I’m not satisfied with where we are, but I’m satisfied with where we are going.” Wyatt, a Jacksonville native, knows all about forging a football turnaround. He did it at Bethune-Cookman, compiling a 90-54 record from 1997-2009, while recruiting future Jaguars players like Rashean Mathis and Ryan Davis. When he took over at B-CC, the Wildcats were facing NCAA sanctions that included the loss of 32 scholarships over a four-year period. The problem is, EWC’s hurdles in the Sun Conference — where the Lakeland-based Southeastern program and others have a huge financial advantage — are more significant compared to what Bethune faced two decades ago in the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference. But Wyatt remains undeterred, imploring his players after Saturday’s game to not let a sixth consecutive loss bring them down. “Come on, guys!” Wyatt said in a midfield huddle. “Don’t preoccupy your mind with failure. Don’t you hold your head down. We believe now. We saw something in you today.” EWC fifth-year senior running back Ray Dukes, who finished with 121 rushing yards, believes. He thinks the Tigers, over time, have a chance to be relevant under Wyatt. “You can see he’s fighting for everything we don’t have,” said Dukes. “We have better practice uniforms and good charter buses. His spirit is always positive. He’s instilled in us to play like champions. He’s making a difference. He believes in us. He always gives us a speech that amps us up.” But on any level of college football, it’s not enough to have just belief, heart and passion. A consistently good football program takes money and facilities. As he walked toward the team bus, Wyatt glanced back out at Milne Field, saying: “Look at this field. Take it over to Kings Road [on the EWC campus] and we’ll be glad to have it. That’d be like Christmas to us.” There are signs of life in EWC football. Just not enough dollar signs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:14:45.960+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
