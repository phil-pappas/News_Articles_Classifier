The news was first reported over the weekend by the Boston Globe. It's a curious move, to be sure, as there isn't much precedent for an individual with Amaro's considerable front-office experience moving back to the field as a coach. Boston manager John Farrell had been on a front-office track before being named the team's pitching coach back in 2007, but he had more extensive coaching experience from earlier in his career than Amaro. \"I guess it's unusual but for me, I've always had an itch to be back on the field,\" Amaro said Monday. \"It's always been something I've thought about quite a bit, and I was afforded a wonderful opportunity…. Had it not been the Red Sox, frankly I probably would not be doing this.\" \"That fire never really goes out. That’s one of the things we talked about,\" Farrell said. \"You feel the pull of the dugout. That’s the former player in you. There's some similarities to [my experience], and I could identify with it.\" Amaro was a member of Philadelphia's front office for 17 years, starting under former GM Ed Wade as an assistant in 1998. He was part of a front office under Pat Gillick that built the core of the championship 2008 Phillies. Amaro took over for Gillick following that season and continued a run of five consecutive division titles from 2007 to 2011 for Philadelphia. However, Amaro also presided over the Phillies' fall from consistent contention to the basement of the National League East, and he was often criticized for sticking with an aging core well beyond its prime and being slow to adapt to a more modern, analytical approach to the game. After a long period of speculation surrounding his job, he was fired by Philadelphia in September. Amaro played eight seasons in the majors, between the Angels, Phillies and Indians — mostly as a reserve outfielder after initially coming up as an infielder. That experience will serve him in his new role, as one of the primary responsibilities of the first-base coach is to double as the team's outfield instructor. Amaro will also be in charge of the running game for the Red Sox. \"In my mind, I think it’s invaluable to have lived it and played it and had to learn,\" Amaro said. \"I've had a great opportunity to work with some fine instructors and to formulate really my own ideas on drills and things that are important, understanding situations in the outfield, understanding the hitters, staying alert.\" Amaro said he was \"ecstatic\" to be working with young outfielders such as Mookie Betts, Rusney Castillo and Jackie Bradley Jr., adding, \"I just hope I don’t screw it up.\" Page 2 of 2 - Amaro also revealed that he's ambidextrous and is working on throwing batting practice with both arms; teams often struggle to find left-handed batting-practice pitchers. Amaro added that he's already lost 10 pounds training. Amaro and Farrell briefly played together with the Indians in 1995. \"You quickly came to understand how smart he was,\" said Farrell. \"He's connected with people because of his personality. He's a very outgoing person. You want that eagerness, you want that type of personality as part of your staff.\" President of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski, in letting go of former first-base coach Arnie Beyeler, said the team was mainly looking to change \"the mixture\" of the coaching staff.
