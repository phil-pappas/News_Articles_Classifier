It’s an issue that has enormous implications for people’s security, jobs and the economy. Yet we do not hear many politicians, including the current presidential candidates, talking about it.\nWhat’s this issue? Coastal flooding and sea-level rise.\nMore than 45 percent of America’s GDP is tied to our coasts. More than 66 million jobs are at stake, totaling $3.4 trillion in wages. States from Maine to Texas and Alaska to California have property along coastal areas. And it’s a major issue for people in our cities of Hoboken, N.J., and Coral Gables.\nRecent historic flooding in South Carolina underscores just how dangerous and costly flooding can be. In many places, it’s not just the big storms and near-misses, like Hurricane Joaquin, that leave people worried. It’s also “sunny day flooding” that’s happening more regularly as high tides push water past the beaches and onto local streets as sea levels rise.\nMany cities and towns are suffering from increased flooding, including so-called nuisance flooding that affects roads, drainage systems and other infrastructure. According to NOAA, nuisance flooding increased between 300 percent and 900 percent along all three U.S. coasts since the 1960s.\nThe stakes are huge. In Florida, tourism is the biggest industry, bringing in nearly $72 billion in 2012. If beach towns become inundated, money for repairing and moving vital infrastructure will instead become a drain on city budgets, state finances and federal agencies. The same is true in urban metro areas up and down our coasts.\nThat’s why a diverse and bipartisan group of more than 35 mayors and local elected officials are gathering this week in Hampton, N.H., for a summit to discuss local and national responses to coastal flooding. We’ll speak with fellow mayors, state officials and representatives from federal agencies who are responsible for studying, insuring and protecting our coastlines. We’ll also hear from security experts in the U.S. Navy, who will explain how sea-level rise driven by climate change poses a long-term threat to military facilities and our fleets around the world.\nThis is a truly bipartisan event, with more Republicans than Democrats in attendance. The ocean doesn’t care if we are conservative or liberal; either way it’s moving closer to our homes and businesses.\nThe monumental scale of this problem demands the attention of our national leaders. It’s an issue that should be of concern for any elected official who wants to strengthen the U.S. economy and protect our communities. With so much at stake, there’s no time for partisan bickering or attempts to skirt the issue. The 123 million Americans who live in coastal counties need action.\nThat’s why we’re calling on all presidential candidates, regardless of their party, to take a stand and tell us what they’ll do to address coastal flooding and sea-level rise. What measures will they take to support local communities facing rising tides? What action will they take to prevent more damage over the long term?\nAmerica’s leaders can’t afford to stick their heads in the sand, because if they do, in just a few years, that sand may just be gone.\nJim Cason, a Republican, is mayor of Coral Gables, Fla. Dawn Zimmer, a Democrat, is mayor of Hoboken, N.J.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-23T18:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:21:30.091+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
