MAIZE â€” Railroader soccer pulled off an upset Oct. 20, getting a road win over one of the top teams in class 5A. Using a pair of second half goals to come from behind Newton etched a 2-1 win over Maize. Trailing 1-0 after the first half, Jose Rojas collected a pass from Juan Castillo and deposited it in the back of the net with 29 minutes remaining to tie the game. Castillo would become a hero minutes later when he found Felipe Lene in right spot, getting his second assist of the game. Newton improved to 8-7 on the season with the win.
