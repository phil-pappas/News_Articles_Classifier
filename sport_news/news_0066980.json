Mehigan said of Wolf's touchdown. \nIt was fitting that a defensive athlete made the play of the game. \nCherokee, the No. 5 team in The Inquirer Top 10, got strong work from its defense in the hard-hitting game and improved its record to 4-1. \nNo. 6 Lenape also played sturdy defense, especially in the second half. The Indians dropped to 4-1. \n\"We didn't play well, but good teams make you not play well,\" Lenape coach Tim McAneney said. \"We'll lick our wounds and get back to work on getting better, starting Monday.\" \nCherokee controlled the action in the first half and built a 14-0 lead. \nThe Chiefs got a one-yard touchdown run from junior Jon Lovett at the end of a 56-yard drive that featured 31 yards on four carries by junior quarterback Jake Bodine. \nCherokee added another score just before half as Ryan Rickards' 27-yard punt return set up a 31-yard drive that ended with senior quarterback Evan Powell's 11-yard touchdown pass to Nick Elskamp with 23 seconds on the clock. \n\"That score before the end of the half killed us,\" McAneney said. \nLenape cut the margin to 14-7 in the third quarter on Joseph Kellum's three-yard touchdown run after quarterback Bryce Long completed a 33-yard pass to Tim Montgomery on a fourth-and-16. \n\"One-score game in the fourth quarter, that's where we wanted to be,\" McAneney said. \nCherokee's defensive line generated seven sacks, with junior Mike Pawlowski and sophomore Andrew Cardinali getting two-and-a-half each. \nBut none was bigger than the one that led to Wolf's touchdown. \nWith Lenape facing a third-and-25 from the 16, Pawlowski and Cardinali combined to collapse the pocket and the football popped into Wolf's hands. \n\"It never hit the ground,\" Wolf said. \"I was kind of shocked. I just took off. \n\"I felt like I was running fast, but then I was thinking I was going too slow.\" \nWolf raced untouched into the end zone to give Cherokee a 20-7 lead with 4 minutes, 21 second remaining in the game. Ethan McCarren's third extra point finished the scoring. \n\"It's awesome,\" Wolf said of the victory. \"This was a huge game, school rival, lots of talk all week.\" \nLenape 0 0 7 0 - 7 \nCherokee 7 7 0 7 - 21 \nC: Jon Lovett 1 run (Ethan McCarren kick) \nC: Nick Elskamp 11 pass from Evan Powell (McCarren kick) \nL: Joseph Kellum 3 run (Ben Harris kick) \nC: R.J Wolf 11 fumble return (McCarren kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:16:05.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
