He was getting some opportunities and, man, he made the most of it.” \nDesperate for a victory, the Saints (2-4) enjoyed big plays in all phases, a common occurrence when New Orleans hosts night games. Including the playoffs, the Saints have now won 19 of 21 games in the Superdome in prime time. \nMichael Mauti, who grew up near New Orleans after his father, Rich, played for the Saints, blocked a punt and recovered it for a touchdown, delighting the Superdome crowd with a play reminiscent of Steve Gleason’s famous block against Atlanta in 2006. \nGleason, now paralyzed by ALS, was at the game, watching from his motorized wheel chair. \n“The cool thing was that Steve was here to see that,” Brees said. “It brought back some good memories. Obviously we got to add to that tonight as well.” \nMark Ingram ran for two short touchdowns, and New Orleans’ defense recovered three fumbles — two inside its own 20. \nDevonta Freeman rushed for 100 yards, including a 25-yard TD, for Atlanta (5-1). Matt Ryan passed for 295 yards and two TDs. \nFreeman also turned a short pass into a 13-yard touchdown, but by then it was too late for the Falcons. \n“We made mistakes early on and it cost us,” Freeman said. “I feel like we beat ourselves, but they’re a talented team and they did a lot of great things tonight.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T17:27:44.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
