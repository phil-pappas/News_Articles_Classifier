After Jagr was traded from the Devils with 21 Panthers games remaining, the trio compiled 54 points.\n\"He's always talking and telling us what to do on the ice after every practice,\" said Barkov, 20, who had seven goals and eight assists (15 points) in the final 21 games, compared with nine and 12 in his other 50.\n\"We try to practice something new, shooting, passing, skating, so we get to know each other more and that's why we play so good.\"\nBecause of Huberdeau's protracted contract negotiation this offseason, the trio only practiced once in training camp before playing together in the third preseason game. They still contributed two goals and three assists in that game, including a Jagr helper on Nick Bjugstad's game-winning power-play goal, to down Dallas, 3-2.\nThe latest Florida Panthers roster as the team prepares for its season opener on Oct. 10 in Philadelphia.\n(Harvey Fialkov) \"We played really good that first game because we get motivation from him,\" said Barkov, born a month before Jagr's sixth season began in Pittsburgh, a season in which he notched a career-high 149 points, including 67 goals. \"That's why we're giving 100 percent every night and try to not let him down.\"\nHuberdeau, 22, used to try to weave past three defenders like he did when he was dominating the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League with 177 points in 104 games. But playing with Jagr last season taught Huberdeau patience with the puck, as he let the game come to him.\nNew 3-on-3 OT format brings excitement to NHL Harvey Fialkov After scoring the NHL's first-ever game-deciding goal in the newly instituted 3-on-3 overtime format in a preseason victory over the Predators, Panthers rookie defenseman Mike Matheson called it \"organized pond hockey.\"\n\"It's incredible,\" Matheson said. \"There's chance after chance.

If you fall...\n(Harvey Fialkov) \"When we're in the zone we know we have to support each other,\" said Huberdeau, who scored 21 points in his final 20 games (15 assists) en route to a team-leading 54-point season. \"A guy will never be by himself. If he loses the puck, we'll be on it right away, so puck possession is our main goal. We've got to go to the net, and that's how you score.\n\"Jagr just sticks his butt out and nobody can take the puck from him. It's about clicking with each other.\"\nOnce Jagr — who at 43 is older than his two line mates' combined age — joined the Panthers in late February, he was rejuvenated by his precocious teammates. He scored 18 points in 20 games while leading the Panthers to a 12-7-1 closing kick that fell short of a playoff berth.\n\"They always get told they could score goals; they're quick and strong,'' said Jagr, the active leader in goals, assists and points. \"They're good one-on-one, but I can help them with the experience.\n\"Tell them how to take advantage of that, how to play. If you don't tell them, they're going to find out, but maybe five or six years later. You can make the progress a little quicker. You tell them, you show them, and they see it works. You can make them great players a little bit quicker than [if] they have to find out on their own.''\nAt times last season it seemed as if the Jagr line was playing keep away from children as it held onto the puck in the offensive zone for entire shifts. Hockey's analytics confirm that.\nThe line's Corsi percentage (all shots taken) was 55.7 percent, more than their opponents' 44.3 percent, and was 0.3 percentage points more than the NHL's Corsi-leading Los Angeles Kings were all season.\nEven the Lightning's potent \"Triplets\" line of Ondrej Palat, Tyler Johnson and Nikita Kucherov were only a tad better at 57 percent. Superstars Sidney Crosby and Patrick Kane came in at 56 percent and 53 percent, respectively.\nThe Jagr line outscored opponents by 13-8 for a stellar 61.9 goals-for percentage. That's a pace of 3.17 goals per 60 minutes of ice time, while allowing just 1.95.\n\"Their puck possession was unbelievable,'' said Panthers coach Gerard Gallant, who played against Jagr for five seasons. \"It wasn't their speed was outstanding or anything different, but the biggest thing for me was when they had the puck in the offensive zone they didn't give it away. They made it tough on other teams.\n\"Jagr showed those kids how to keep the puck instead of throwing it away. It makes playing defense real easy.\"\nPanthers scout Pete Mahovlich, who scored 276 goals and was part of four Stanley Cup championship teams in Montreal, said the 6-foot-3, 230-pound chiseled Czech controls the puck as if his stick were magnetized.\n\"He's been one of the best players to be able to protect the puck,\" Mahovlich said. \"It's not a matter of size, it's positioning your body, knowing where the defenders are coming from, how to get away from them and how to find open ice.\n\"If you beat one guy then all of a sudden someone has to come in and support, and things start to break down and he makes his plays. That trait is hard to learn, but Barkov is one of those guys that is growing into that.\n\"He's got the size and hands,\" Mahovlich said of the 6-3 Barkov, \"and he's so good defensively that he's starting to understand the game.\n\"Huby has learned how to protect the puck and utilize what the other team gives you. There's no time frame when you have the puck in the offensive zone. The time frame ends at the end of the period.\n\"So you have three talented players with offensive skill. … They're going to get better, stronger and quicker.\"\n Ice Hockey Jaromir Jagr Florida Panthers Jonathan Huberdeau NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs Tampa Bay Lightning", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ca84e/turbine/sfl-2015-16-florida-panthers-pg-20150930-002", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560cbf34/turbine/sfl-2015-16-florida-panthers-pg-20150930", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56108323/turbine/fl-new-nhl-rules-overtime-1004-20151003", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ca851/turbine/sfl-2015-16-florida-panthers-pg-20150930-001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5610828c/turbine/fl-panthers-top-line-1004-20151003-30"], "published": "2015-10-04T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:26:33.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
