The Rancho High School varsity football team will not be playing. Rancho had to forfeit Friday’s varsity game after a brawl last week on the field against Las Vegas High. Rancho's junior varsity game will act at the homecoming contest. Students are disappointed about the decision and are trying to make the most out of this situation. School spirit was high. This was a big game for the coveted bone. Rancho High School and Las Vegas High School have been battling over this for decades. But during the second half, things got out of hand as a brawl broke out on the field. \"I thought it was crazy,\" says student Kevin Romero. \"We were just talking and all of a sudden like a big crowd of people in the middle of the football field.\" The Nevada Interscholastic Activities Association conducted an investigation. Assistant Director Jay Beesemyer said they reviewed reports and watched videos extensively before reaching conclusions. \"It was a very difficult decision for everybody involved. We're not in the business of suspending kids we want kids out there playing, we want coaches out their coaching, but when we have to deal with a situation that is directly in violation of one of our rules we've got really no options,\" Beesemyer said. The decision: Rancho was part of a bench clearing which means three or more players leave the bench to take part in an altercation on the field. The consequences: forfeiting the next game, which in this case was homecoming. Four Rancho players were suspended, as was one Las Vegas High player. Rancho High School teacher and North Las Vegas Councilman Isaac Barron says Las Vegas High should shoulder more responsibility. \"If there is going to be a penalty against our school, why isn't there a similar penalty with the other school that was involved?\" Barron says. Rancho students are upset. \"They still fought, but it was like Vegas was provoking us and the referees weren't making fair calls, either,\" says student Isaac Rangel. Regardless of blame, Clark County School District Trustee Kevin Child says this should never have happened. \"Be respectful. Play with passion, and fighting is not the answer. Put it on the board as I always say, put it on the board,\" Child says. Schools can appeal decisions to the NIAA, but it would have to be done through the principal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:56:35.386+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
