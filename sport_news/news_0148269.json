ORCHARD PARK — I never thought I’d say this, but I wish Rex Ryan were more like Doug Marrone. In their two losses this season, the Buffalo Bills have racked up 31 penalties for a total of 275 yards. Sunday against the Giants, the penalties not only cost the Bills yards, it cost them points as well. Doug Marrone may not have been Buffalo’s longterm coaching solution, but no Marrone-led squad would ever be allowed to commit so many mental errors. Penalties provided an 18-point swing to Sunday’s game, taking 14 points off the board for the Bills, and adding four points onto the Giants total. In a 24-10 loss, those plays make up the difference between a win and a loss. In the second quarter, the Giants, facing a fourth and two, chose to kick a 44-yard field goal. Josh Brown nailed the kick, but the Bills were flagged for an illegal formation by lining up over the center during a field goal attempt. This gave the Giants a first down, and eventually Eli Manning would find Rueben Randle for 11 yards and a touchdown. Four points for the Giants. Then in the third quarter, trailing 16-3, Tyrod Taylor made an incredible scramble, dodged a few Giant defenders and plunged his way across the goal line for a 31-yard touchdown run. But Kraig Urbik was called for holding, and the points came off the board. Finally, in the fourth quarter, Tyrod Taylor tossed a dime over the middle to a wide open Charles Clay for a 32-yard strike. If completed, it would have cut New York’s lead in half to 24-17 with just under a minute left. But instead, the Bills turned the ball over on downs and the Giants took a knee to win the game. 18 points. A professional football team can never give away 18 points and expect to come out on the other side. So naturally Rex Ryan was furious with his team’s lack of discipline, right? Well, not really. “We’ve got to play within the rules. We all know that. Did it happen today? Apparently not. We had 17 penalites, two touchdowns called back, a fumble, all that kind of stuff. I get it, no question about it. But I mean… you know we can focus on the negatives and all that, and I get it, that’s your guys jobs, but you might not understand the game the way I understand because I’ve been on the other side. I’ve been a part of 20-some penalty performances by the Ravens, and we went on and fixed it. We’ll fix it here,” said Ryan. Page 2 of 3 - “I don’t know. I guess you guys write the stories so you’ll write it the way you want to write it. I know, the one thing I know for a fact is we got heart. The discipline things, you know, I get it. You get 17 penalties, that’s obviously a sign of a lack of discipline. I think though, that’s not the real deal. But you know, hey, it’s a free country. Write what you believe.” “I’m proud of this team and we’ll keep fighting, and eventually we’ll find a way to win. Eventually to eliminate the penalties.” So is racking up 17 penalties a problem? Yes. Is it something that Rex Ryan seems concerned about? No. And it seemed as though this entire team was echoing his sentiments. While everybody feels the penalties are an issue, many Bills players seemed to express the idea that it’s the cost of doing business with a Rex Ryan-led team. “I don’t think it is an undisciplined team, I think we are just playing our game, playing free but we got to play in control. And just be aware of the situations and play within the whistles,” said Bills WR Robert Woods. “We’ll look at the film and see where those penalties were. You can’t really comment on the penalties until we see the film and see what they look like and send it in to the NFL,” said Jerry Hughes, who was guilty of committing two personal foul penalties on the day. “I mean, it’s tough on us. As a player, as a defense, we’re going to get penalties every game. That’s the way it looks, and we can’t control that, so we just got to be able to play out the plays and just take it how it comes,” said Nigel Bradham. “I mean, let’s not sit here and act like (reputation) doesn’t factor in. I mean if it’s close, they’re going to throw the flag on us,” said Corey Graham. “But we have to know that. As players you have to know that you can’t be border line. If you’re border line, then you’re going to get the penalty, and as players we have to be smarter.” Some players even went as far as insinuating that they were not to blame for some of those penalites. “There are a lot of things going on out there today, from a lot of different perspectives, you know you get in trouble for talking about. So we will just leave it at that. Obviously we have to be better, but a lot of people have to be better,” said Kyle Williams. “We have to play smarter and be better to take ourselves out of situations that we got into today. You know, like I said, there were some things that were provoked today that weren’t provoked against New England.”“It’s an offensive game so we got to understand that calls aren’t going to go in our favor so we just got to rally together and just play with one another,” said Hughes. “At the end of the day, we got to, whatever they call, roll with it and just go play football.” Page 3 of 3 - Regardless of the referee’s influence over who get’s penalized, the Bills have undoubtedly earned their reputation. Rex Ryan has exactly the team he wanted at the beginning of this season. Rex Ryan has a bunch of bullies. Only maybe somebody should have told Rex Ryan that bullies aren’t tough. Bullies are cowards. Bullies cheat and refuse to play by the rules, and then make excuses when things don’t go their way. Perhaps Rex Ryan should stop building bullies, and start building champions.
