Jeb Bush and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who have each raised more than $10 million.\nThe numbers are especially troubling for Jindal, who began the month with just $261,000 left in the bank. That will make it hard for him to sustain his campaign operation.\nChristie and Kasich are also at the lower end of the fundraising spectrum.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
