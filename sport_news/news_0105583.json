The 23-year-old allegedly began texting one of the camp's 13-year-old attendees in a conversation that turned \"provocative,\" Sheriff Adam Bieber said in a statement .\nThe boy's mother reportedly alerted authorities to the text messages on Thursday, and the sheriff's department took over the conversation—which allegedly became \"sexually explicit\"—to arrange a meeting, and arrest, on Friday night.\n\"In this case, a vigilant mother identified that a provocative conversation was being held with her son and took the actions necessary to prevent both immediate and perhaps future victimization,\" Bieber said.\nA mug shot has not yet been released.\nThe Shawano Sheriff's Department has been in the midst of an effort to stop digital child predators, arresting six suspects in total in the last three weeks.\n-- David Greenwald\ndgreenwald@oregonian.com\n503-294-7625; @davidegreenwald\nFollow @davidegreenwald", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/123887617627883/photos/a.1023645287652107.1073741830.123887617627883/1209291822420785/?type=3&theater", "https://twitter.com/davidegreenwald"], "published": "2015-10-17T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:51:32.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
