Trey Bonifacio scored the game-winner 6:31 into overtime to lead the No. 2 Cardinals (18-2) to a 2-1 win over No. 6 Stroudsburg in the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference boys soccer semifinal on Tuesday at Pleasant Valley High School. In the girls soccer EPC semifinal game, No. 7 Pleasant Valley upset No. 3 Whitehall, 1-0. Junior Jamie Masullo assisted senior Erin Sharpe on the game's lone goal with 30:29 left in the game. For the Lady Bears, that goal was all they needed in a half that was Pleasant Valley's all the way through. For Pocono East's boys, Bonifacio was impressive from start to finish, in large part controlling the game's pace, especially in the first half. But it was his last kick of the game that sealed Pocono East's place in the EPC championship game. \"It's what he can do with the ball,\" PM East head coach Bob Black said. \"He can go forward, he can go side-to-side. He wins balls even though he's one of the smaller players on the field. He wins it and can keep it, and he's definitely one of the keys as far as the attacking and defending. \"He sits in front of the back line with Jon Marin and they keep the back line safe. He's so creative. He sees the field so well - everything you want from a center-midfielder.\" The Cardinals dominated the first half after Doug Goitia scored the game's opening goal just 10 minutes into the game, helping PM East control the pace and overpower the Mounties. \"Great individual effort on Trey's part of course there at the end,\" PM East head coach Bob Black said. \"I thought the team stuck through it. Stroudsburg (is) a great team. They show a lot of heart, they make it really difficult to score on them and fight through them. We're just happy to move on.\" The game had every bit the intensity one would expect from a rivalry - even more so in the postseason. And while PM East controlled the first half, the Mounties claimed possession for the majority of the second. The problem for Stroudsburg was that it left the half with nothing to show for it. \"Tonight's a tough one. There's no other way to look at it,\" Stroudsburg coach Michael Kane said. \"Your typical rivalry game. I thought it was a pretty even game. ... I thought overtime was even till Trey scored the goal. It just takes one play. It shows in a game like that, so even, so back and forth. So much emotion. It's just one play that makes the difference, and the kid put it in.\" For Bonifacio, it was the kind of moment athletes live for. \"I got the ball across the middle and I wouldn't have been able to run if it wasn't for my striker, Douglas (Goitia),\" Bonifacio said. \"He dragged all the defenders out and left the space open in the middle.\" Goitia has required some extra attention this season. With 29 goals on the year, including Tuesday's, Stroudsburg's defense did its job to stop him from scoring in overtime. But they didn't stop Bonifacio. The Cardinals face fifth-seeded Parkland on Thursday at a location yet to be determined. The Pleasant Valley Bears will face No. 1 Parkland in the EPC championship game on Thursday also at a location to be determined.
