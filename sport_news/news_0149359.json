Jay Tate of Rivals reports that WR Duke Williams was dismissed from the team today after an “off-the-field incident at a local nightclub” over the weekend. \nMany thought the JUCO transfer would leave for the NFL after a stellar junior season, but “off-the-field incidents” started becoming a problem before last season ended, serving a suspension during the Outback Bowl. \nThe size of Auburn’s star receiver would have been a very difficult matchup for Kentucky. Now it seems as though the stars are aligning for a second-consecutive 5-1 start.
