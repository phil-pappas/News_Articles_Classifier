James didn't speak to the media following the Cavs' workout at Cleveland Clinic Courts.\nBlatt says James is \"fine\" heading into the season opener on Tuesday in Chicago. The four-time MVP only played in two of Cleveland's seven exhibition games, missing the last three after receiving a shot.\nBlatt says James will be out there \"very soon.\"\nPower forward Tristan Thompson hasn't yet rejoined the team after agreeing to a five-year, $82 million contract on Wednesday. The team hopes to have Thompson on the floor on Friday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
