Posted: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 10:50 am Roanoke team to join SPHL for 2016-17 season By Thomas Pope - Sports editor \nThe Mississippi Surge, which suspended operations following the 2013-14 Southern Professional Hockey League season, will resurface for the 2016-17 season in Roanoke, Virginia, the league announced Tuesday. \nThe team will be operated by Breakaway Sports and Entertainment, whose majority owners are Bob McGinn and sons Jamie, Tye and Brock. McGinn’s sons are all under NHL contracts with Buffalo, Tampa Bay and Carolina. \n\"There is a strong fan base for hockey here in Roanoke, and the SPHL is the best-kept secret in hockey,\" McGinn said at a press conference. \"We have a city and a league that wants us, and we definitely want to be in Roanoke. Our five local owners were a must-have to complete our business plan and my family and I can't wait to drop the puck.\" \nRoanoke has had five minor-league hockey franchises in its history, most recently fielding a team in the 2003-04 season as the Roanoke Express in what is now the ECHL. \nThe new team will, like its predecessors, play in the Berglund Center, which has 8,372 permanent seats. The arena is in the midst of a $6.2 million renovation that is expected to be completed next year. \nRoanoke, at three hours, 40 minutes from Fayetteville, will become the Antz’s closest opponent. Currently, the nearest opponents are in Macon, Georgia, and Knoxville, Tennessee, at more than six hours. \n“Before, we had several teams that close, so it saves on travel for us,” said FireAntz president Kevin MacNaught, citing franchises in Florence, Winston-Salem and Richmond that have folded, “but it also will create a rivalry with them. \n“I think it just shows the strength of the league and the business plan the SPHL has in that we’re actually growing where other leagues are shrinking.” \nThe SPHL will have nine teams, including the Fayetteville FireAntz, in action when its 12th season begins Friday. Fayetteville’s season gets underway Saturday at 7:05 p.m. with a home game at Crown Coliseum against Huntsville. \nSports editor Thomas Pope can be reached at popet@fayobserver.com or 486-3520.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:18:37.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
