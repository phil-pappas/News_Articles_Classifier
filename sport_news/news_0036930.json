Kurt Benkert, the projected starter, suffered a season-ending knee injury in August. Then Benkert’s backup left the program.\nThat left junior Blake Kemp and junior college transfer James Summers.\nAs it turns out, both Kemp and Summers have played well in ECU’s two-quarterback system.\nBoth Kemp, a pocket passer, and Summers, a dual-threat QB, are expected to play Saturday against BYU.\n“Who starts will be judged on who gives us the best advantage,” said ECU coach Ruffin McNeill. “They make each other better. As soon as a series is over, you see those two get together. You see them exchange mental notes.”\nWhat’s the challenge of facing two different quarterbacks?\n“It’s really just a sense of awareness. When a different quarterback comes in, you have to be aware,” said defensive lineman Bronson Kaufusi. “If one likes to run the ball a lot, you have to stay in your rushing lanes. You can’t get too risky. If one’s a passer, you have to get after him and let him know that we’re there.”\nPLAYING AT HOME : BYU defensive line coach Steve Kaufusi played for the Cougars in the mid-1980s. So he frequently talks to his players about the opportunity to play at LaVell Edwards Stadium.\nSaturday is homecoming at BYU.\n“Hopefully it means a lot to them. When you step on the field, there’s a lot of football that’s been played there. Fans, former players come to watch,” Kaufusi said. “They’re representing all of those people, besides themselves and their families. Hopefully, they can be at their best each time they play there.\n\"I can remember where certain plays happened when I played there. It’s really good. We try to stress that to the kids: ‘It’s not about you, it’s about everybody else that’s been before you and how we got to this point where we have a facility like this to play on a field like this.' I always remind them to be appreciative of what they’ve got.”\nBYU’S RUN GAME : Due to a rash of injuries, the Cougars have used a variety of running backs this season.\nAlgernon Brown (95 yards) and Francis Bernard (69 yards) both played well in last week’s win over Connecticut. Riley Burt had one carry for 5 yards, his first career attempt. Adam Hine is expected to be out for four weeks with an ankle injury.\n“As an offensive line, we know if we open up the hole, somebody is back there that’s going to get the job done,” said offensive lineman Tejan Koroma . “Francis played great. Riley (Burt) had that one carry, a little glimpse of talent. We’re excited about whoever is back there.”\nEMAIL: jeffc@deseretnews.com", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:22:41.288+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
