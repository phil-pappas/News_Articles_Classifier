More >> \n(RNN) – The week where everything gets turned on its head is here - and we’re still early enough in the season that there could be another one. \nThe first team to upset a team in playoff position became the second team in playoff position to lose, the bottom part of the top 10 got dismantled and Florida is the season’s biggest surprise. \nThe SEC was all up in the middle of the carnage with No. 3 Ole Miss and No. 8 Georgia suffering twin 38-10 massacres. But outside the SEC, the devastation was just as prevalent. \nNo. 6 Notre Dame and No. 7 UCLA both lost as well to send the top 10 into a tailspin. No. 12 Clemson pulled off the upset over the Irish 24-22 when a Notre Dame 2-point conversion with six seconds left came up short. \nArizona State, which was reeling and largely written off after a blowout loss to Southern Cal, delivered a convincing 38-23 win over the Bruins. The Pac 12 is in as much a state of flux as the SEC. There’s no clear frontrunner and at least six teams could legitimately make a run at the championship. \nThings weren’t quite as bad as they could have been, however, with No. 1 Ohio State and No. 2 Michigan State fighting off Indiana and Purdue, respectively in one-score games that came down to the wire. \nThe only other ranked team to lose to a team not ranked higher was No. 19 Wisconsin, which fell to Iowa 10-6. \nThe top four is going to look weird when it comes out with two Big 10 teams and two Big 12 holding those spots. \nHere's a look at what we learned from watching SEC games in Week 5. \n1. Live by turnovers, die by turnovers. Let’s revisit Ole Miss’ win over Alabama for a minute. Five turnovers allowed the Rebels to take that win. Now two weeks later, it was four turnovers by the Rebels that doomed them against Florida. \nFlorida’s pass rush was too much for quarterback Chad Kelly, who channeled the ghost of Bad Bo Wallace. Kelly was erratic at times and responsible for three of the Rebels’ four turnovers. He was 26-of-40 for 259 yards and spread the ball to 10 receivers, but wasn’t able to attack the defense vertically due to not having time to throw and had to settle for short passes that proved ineffective. \nKelly also led the Rebels (4-1, 2-1) on the ground with 40 yards. Top running back Jaylen Walton had just nine carries for 23 yards. Until the “Black Bears” learn that running the ball is legal, they aren’t a complete team and will have difficulty overcoming mistakes. 1 \n2. Alabama remembered who it is. Derrick Henry got a career-high 26 carries and 148 yards in the win over Georgia. That 26 carries represents a career-high for him is all the evidence you need that he’s underused. (By comparison, LSU’s Leonard Fournette and Arkansas’ Alex Collins have had at least that many carries in three games this year.) \nJacob Coker was 11-of-16 for 190 yards, Alabama gained 379 yards on the ground, Georgia threw three interceptions and the Tide scored two defensive touchdowns. That’s Alabama football at its finest. \nThere were still hiccups, however. No. 13 Alabama (4-1, 1-1) had two turnovers of its own and converted only one of 12 third down attempts. But Georgia (4-1, 2-1) was equally bad converting just three of its 17 attempts. \nThe biggest takeaway was Coker’s consistency and ability to attack the defense vertically. He had been simply awful at both before Saturday. But Calvin Ridley came up big for a much-maligned Crimson Tide wide receiver corps, catching five balls for 120 yards, including a 45-yard touchdown. \nIt was enough to get some people to put Alabama back in their playoff predictions . That’s an overreaction, just like the predictions that the Saban dynasty was over after the Ole Miss loss were an overreaction. \n3. Georgia did what Georgia does. A big game. At home. A chance to make a statement. A massive loss. That’s Georgia for you. \nMark Richt has been hearing calls for his job for about six years. Well before getting choke-slammed by Alabama, fans as young as 13 years old were already asking for him to be fired this season. If a toddler doesn’t call Paul Finebaum before Tuesday, it will be a major disappointment. 2 \nAlabama was characteristically good at shutting down the run until Nick Chubb broke off an 83-yarder in garbage time. With that scamper, he passed Herschel Walker for consecutive 100-yard games and more than doubled his yardage for the game to that point. \nThe Bulldogs’ usually excellent passing game was no help, either. Against a secondary that has been as solid as a sinkhole in recent years, Greyson Lambert was 10-of-24 for 86 yards with an interception and Brice Ramsey was 1-of-6 for 20 yards with two interceptions. \nYou can chalk it up to one bad game if you like, but Georgia has had a pattern of “one bad game” for two games a year each of the last five years. Under Mark Richt, the Bulldogs are now 38-34 against ranked teams and 11-18 in the last six years. \nAs noted above, it isn’t going unnoticed . 3 \n4. Florida is the frontrunner in the SEC East. The Gators’ defense has been a huge improvement over last year. It’s a strange turnaround since Will Muschamp, whose specialty is defense, was replaced by Jim McElwain, whose specialty is offense. \nBut if anything has marked Florida’s resurgence, it’s the play of quarterback Will Grier. Grier is third in the SEC with 10 touchdowns and in a virtual tie with Georgia’s Greyson Lambert for the top spot in completion percentage. \nHis 24-of-29 day for 271 yards and four touchdowns against the stalwart Rebel defense was the difference in the Gators (5-0, 3-0) turning those turnovers in a blowout rather than letting the Rebels back into the game the way they had done against Alabama two weeks ago. \nEven though there’s been some inconsistency and close calls in recent weeks, Florida has the makings of a team that can compete for a championship. Their next three games against Missouri, LSU and Georgia are all must-watch. \n5. Missouri is still Missouri. It’s going to be another year of weirdness in the SEC East, and Missouri will be partly to blame. The Tigers can beat anyone and lose to anyone. You simply don’t know what you’re going to get from one week to the next. \nGood Mizzou showed up this week with a 24-10 win over South Carolina. If it can show up against Florida next week, things will really start to get interesting. \nMissouri (4-1, 1-1) had one more total yard and one more first down than the Gamecocks, but three interceptions made the difference in a game that was otherwise dead even. Lorenzo Nunez tossed those three picks – one in the red zone and two on bad overthrows. \nWith Maty Mauk suspended for who knows what, Mauktober 3.0 got off to a good start without him. Freshman Drew Lock was 21-of-28 for 136 yards and two touchdowns. \nJust to recap, Missouri now has a seven-point win over Arkansas State, a three-point win over Connecticut, an eight-point loss to Kentucky and a 14-point win over South Carolina. Your guess is as good as anybody’s. \n6. Kentucky is still Kentucky. Last week the Wildcats beat Missouri. This week they almost lost to Eastern Kentucky. That was supposed to be the kind of automatic win you mark down without a second thought and count it toward what you need toward bowl eligibility. But this being Kentucky, it had to be pulled out with two touchdowns in the last five minutes and another in overtime to come away with a 34-27 win. \nThe Wildcats (4-1, 3-1) were all over the place. Patrick Towles threw for 329 yards and three touchdowns, but he also had two interceptions. Kentucky couldn’t run the ball at all, which is something it had done surprisingly well to this point. Boom Williams not playing for unexplained reasons probably had a lot to do with that. \nWhatever is keeping him sidelined, it’s hurting the Wildcats. They need his 87 yards per game to stay competitive and get a bowl bid. \n7. Miles Garrett is a name you need to know. Garrett is a dominating force up front for No. 14 Texas A&M (5-0, 2-0), leading the SEC in sacks with 7.5 and ranking third nationally. This is important because the Aggies have been defensively inept since joining the SEC. \nIn a 30-17 win over Mississippi State, Garrett had a sack and forced a fumble and kept the Bulldogs from mounting a comeback. That pass rush is going to be of major importance in the Aggies’ next two games against Alabama and Ole Miss – two teams that have shown shaky quarterback play when pressured. \nCoupling that with Texas A&M’s reliably potent offense gives them more than an outside shot in the SEC West. \n8. Leonard Fournette may win the Heisman before Halloween. With the kind of start Fournette is off to, Barry Sanders’ single-season records aren’t so much goals as they are plans. He’s having the kind of year where record pace will define everything he does. \nFournette turned in his third 200-yard game for LSU (4-0, 2-0) with 233 yards and three touchdowns in a 44-22 win over Eastern Michigan and averaged 9 yards per carry doing it. He leads the nation in rushing yards and touchdowns and has had one fewer game to do it that everyone else at the top of those lists. \nHe’s averaging 216 yards per game, which is 56 yards per game more than the No. 2 rusher - San Jose State’s Tyler Ervin. Fournette has 67 more yards per game than Chubb, who is third nationally with 149. \nFournette is slightly behind Sanders’ 1988 touchdown pace of 37 and his 2,628-yard pace, but both are only because the Tigers’ first game of the season was canceled. \n9. Mississippi State is back to its old self. Before last year’s rise to being ranked No. 1, the Bulldogs beat everybody they were supposed to beat and lost to everyone they were supposed to lose to. Well, they’re doing it again. \nThat has a lot to do with being reliant on one guy. Dak Prescott has been having to do everything himself and Saturday was no different. He threw for 210 yards and rushed for 96. But two fumbles – both by other players and one inside the 10 – rendered it for naught. \nWithout some help, that’s going to be the same story for every game the Bulldogs (3-2, 1-2) play. \n10. Arkansas and Tennessee might be spoilers. Neither team is likely to be at the top of the standings when the season ends, but they are both good enough to inflict damage to someone else’s bid for the SEC championship. \nTake Arkansas, for instance. Their game against Alabama next week could be very interesting. Alabama’s defense refuses to let the running game work, yet Arkansas (2-3, 1-1) has the largest offensive line in football (college or pro) and running the ball is the only thing the Hogs do well. \nThat’s not enough to predict an upset, but it is enough to at least create of sliver of doubt. \nAs for the Vols (2-3, 0-2), they can get a lead on anybody. They just can’t hold it. At some point, they will luck into a win simply by having been in the lead for long enough to not lose. There’s something to be said for that, I guess. \nIt almost happened against both Oklahoma and Florida. It’s not inconceivable that it would happen next week against Georgia or later in the year against Alabama or Missouri – perhaps even with a different outcome. \nBoth teams’ strengths and weaknesses were on full display in Arkansas’ 24-20 win. Neither can be slept on. \nExtra points: 1 As we saw earlier this week, just because you tell a black bear what to do, does not mean it will listen: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nU5cMZymSr0 \n2 Potential call: “Hey Pawwwl, Mock Wicht just can’t ween in the big games. Wut’s his prollem? Jawja wheel never ween as long as Wicht is the couch.” That’s not necessarily meant to be a toddler, by the way. At least a third of all Finebaum calls by adults sound exactly like that. \n3 Overlooked in the whole debacle is the outstanding treatment Georgia has given a player from Southern University. Devon Gales was paralyzed after suffering a fractured vertebra in his neck against Georgia last week. Georgia flew his family to see him at the hospital, honored his parents during the game Saturday, put a decal of his jersey number on their helmets, printed a T-shirt with the Georgia logo as part of his name and Richt encouraged Georgia fans to donate to the fund set up to cover his medical costs. If you’re going to criticize the Bulldogs for losing, you have to also praise them for this. \n\"What We Learned\" is a weekly column examining SEC football from an off-kilter perspective.
