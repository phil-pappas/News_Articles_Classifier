Now, as teams have even more time to prepare and a strong baseline of data, we anticipate the racing to be even better.” \nAfter two seasons of racing where the lack of passing and 400-lap single-car freight trains drew criticism from drivers and fans alike, NASCAR began looking at improving the current rules package to promote more passing and better racing on the track. \nAt the beginning of this season, NASCAR started to lay the groundwork for the new rules package. Ideas ranged from low-downforce aero packages that made the cars harder to control and therefore more of a challenge for drivers, and a high-downforce package that offered more drag in an effort to slow the cars down to make passing easier. \nWhile NASCAR solicited opinions from the manufacturers and the teams, a small cadre of driver formed a “driver’s council” to meet with NASCR back in June to voice their concerns about several issues including the current rules package. \nAlthough NASCAR had planned to test the new aero package ideas as early as the 2015 All Star race at Charlotte last May – a non-points event – NASCAR instead opted to roll out both packages in a real-world, points-paying events. \nTo get the necessary data they needed, NASCAR rolled out the high-downforce package at Michigan and Indianapolis and the low-downforce rules at Kentucky and Darlington. \nThe high-downforce option got mixed reviews, while the low-downforce package seemed to get the results NASCAR was looking for. \n“(We) certainly had to learn some things along the way of how certain things react, which we did this year, and it led us to what we believe is going to be a really strong package heading into ’16,” said O’Donnell. “As you saw, we ran a number of variations this year. There was low, there was high drag, so, you know, I think the ability for us to go out and run all those packages and see what the results were helped land us on 2016. \n“Ultimately what do we think is going to put on the best race, and what we kept coming back to was looking at the low downforce package.” \nAlthough the base package will be used on all tracks except the superspeedway tracks like Daytona and Talladega, O’Donnell reiterated that each track will still feature a tire combination and gear ratio setups that will be unique to each track. He also emphasized there are no plans to implement any changes to the current rules package before the end of the season. \nNASCAR’s announcement was welcomed by drivers, including former series champ Brad Keselowski, who tweeted earlier “Good news – 2016 rules package is a huge upgrade.” \nKeselowski followed that up by tweeting “Less downforce – harder to drive – racing more in (the) driver hands”. \nSprint Cup Series driver Aric Almirola says the new rules “really puts the drivers more in control during the race.” \n“In the past, we’ve just flat-footed at the mile-and-a-half tracks, but now, you’re working the gas and using the brake more, which allows for more passing. It’s going to be more exciting for us, the fans and the sport overall,” said Almirola. “I really give credit to NASCAR for listening to the drivers and all the stakeholders in the sport. I think it’s a big plus for our sport.” \nAmong the other changes announced for 2016 – all teams will now be require to use new digital dashboards which were previously optional. NASCAR also added new rules concerning the placement of fire suppression systems in the cockpit and the addition of a right side NACA duct to cool the driver at tracks where the right-side window is used.
