I believe that I have a very good record for 20 years on the tour. The main thing is to get fit and to reach my 40s with good health to be as successful as Vijay, who won most of his tournaments at that age. \n\"It's something that I hope I will be able to do,\" he said. \"I want to play at an elite level with the new kids for a long, long time.\" \nWhat might help this time around is that Woods said he won't be changing his swing. After returning too early in 2014 from back surgery, he took off the final three months to get stronger and left his swing coach, hiring Chris Como as a consultant. \nWoods doesn't think he's that far off from 2013, when he won five times and was PGA Tour player of the year. \n\"But to achieve it, I need to be healthy again,\" he said. \"This year I tried to play after the back surgery and it wasn't fun because all of the pain. Also after my last surgery, I was changing my swing and to be able to do that successfully you have to practice a lot, and I could not practice because I was doing the rehab. \n\"It was a very complicated situation because of that.\" \nThere was no timetable on when he would start rehabilitation or when he would return. Woods typically doesn't start a new year until the Farmers Insurance Open, which starts the last week of January. That appeared doubtful. \nThe Masters, which he missed in 2014 for the first time, is April 7-10. \n\"I need to return with my explosiveness, and to do that, I need to practice for longer periods of time,\" he said. \"It's going to take several months of hard work\". 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:28:43.475+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
