(AP) - It's a syllabus you can head bang to.\nStudents at the Woodstock Music Lab will bend notes alongside guitar heroes, and jamming in class will be encouraged.\nSo it will go at the rock school for college-age students planned for the famous artists' colony in the coming years. Think Juilliard with power chords. Partners behind the venture include Michael Lang, the promoter of the original 1969 Woodstock festival.\nTheir group is trying to raise millions quickly enough to open the school as early as next year, though Lang said that timetable is optimistic.
