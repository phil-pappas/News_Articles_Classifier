In a single play with one well-placed punch he saved victory from the clutches of defeat and proved how pivotal his presence on the Seattle Seahawks defense is. At the end of Monday Night Football in the tumultuous and tense seconds that seem to slow before a touchdown, Chancellor flew into the camera frame for those watching at home leading with his right fist, knocking the ball loose from Calvin Johnson's grasp. The play maintained their 13-to-10 lead over the Detroit Lions.
