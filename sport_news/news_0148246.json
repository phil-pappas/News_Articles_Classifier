The roster is now deep enough. The Panthers slip into the playoffs, which considering recent history is the bar for a successful season. \n\nPanthers Writer Prediction: 45-27-10 Comment: After a league-best 25-point improvement last season, the Panthers are expecting to challenge for a Stanley Cup. Coach Gerard Gallant will roll out three balanced lines filled with a half-dozen players who should score 20 or more goals. However, it’s imperative that ageless wonder Jaromir Jagr, who instantly boosts the power play, and 36-year-old goalie Roberto Luongo remain healthy. \n\nSports Writer Prediction: 43-24-15 Comment: This season, Panthers make the leap into the playoffs, as long as veteran star Jaromir Jagr continues to inspire the talented young forwards to blossom as consistent scorers. \n\nSports Editor Prediction: 42-29-11 Comment: The Panthers should be in the hunt when the trade deadline comes around. They’ll have to decide whether it’s worth mortgaging the future a bit for a shot at making the playoffs. \n\nOnline Sports Editor Prediction: 43-28-11 Comment: Could this be the year? No, not the year a Stanley Cup comes to South Florida, but the year the Panthers return to the playoffs, and perhaps establish themselves as a team to be reckoned with in the Eastern Conference. They’ve got the goaltending, a solid defense, a group of promising young forwards, and even at 43, Jaromir Jagr scored at a nearly point-per-game pace last season. \n\nHow do you think the Panthers will fare this year?
