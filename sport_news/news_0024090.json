The terms, when approved by the Regents at their Maui meeting, are expected to provide Arnold with a high six-figure settlement, the largest ever granted a former UH athletic department employee.\nIt is UH policy that all settlements in excess of $500,000 must be approved by the Regents.\nAttorneys for UH, Arnold and the Hawaii Government Employees Association, which represents the ex-coach in a grievance with the school, met in chambers with Judge Karl Sakamoto for nine minutes to advise him of the tentative settlement.\nUH fired Arnold Oct. 28, 2014 without cause amid an NCAA inquiry into the men's basketball program.\nUnder provisions of the \"without cause\" clause of his contract, Arnold filed a grievance in February claiming UH owed him $1.4 million.\nIn June, UH filed a suit in Circuit Court claiming he failed to repay approximately $2,000 from a travel advance. Arnold's attorneys subsequently sought to have the suit dismissed.\nUH and Arnold are scheduled to appear before the NCAA Committee on Infractions Thursday in Dallas to answer seven allegations of violations of NCAA rules by the men's basketball program.\nThe largest settlement granted to a former UH athletic department employee was $600,000 to ex-football coach Greg McMackin in 2011.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:33:45.676+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
