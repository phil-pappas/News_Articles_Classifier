The 46-year-old German coach had previously managed Wigan and Brentford. \nA force in domestic and European football from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, Leeds has struggled over the past decade and the team has yet to win at Elland Road this season. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:22:18.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
