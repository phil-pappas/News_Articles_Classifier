Ryan Mallett has started since then, but he has struggled and Hoyer took over in both of the last two games as the Texans fell to 1-4. \nHoyer replaced Mallett in the second quarter on Thursday night and threw for 312 yards and two touchdowns. He was intercepted by Mike Adams with less than 2 minutes left to help seal the Colts’ 27-20 victory. \nThe Texans have 10 days before they’ll try to get back on track when they travel to Jacksonville on Oct. 18. \nShort URL : http://wtaw.com/?p=99621 Weather info for College Station STAY UPDATED", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:51:01.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
