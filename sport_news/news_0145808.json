October 4th 2015 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/NRL/ \nJOHNATHAN Thurston, you are a bloody genius. \nThe greatest player in the code’s history last night produced the greatest play in the greatest grand final to break Brisbane’s hearts and deliver the Cowboys’ maiden premiership. \nIn a decider that defied belief, 82,758 spellbound fans watched Thurston bend and shape history with an extra-time field goal to snatch an epic 17-16 victory in the all-Queensland affair at ANZ Stadium. \nThe 82nd minute one-pointer smashed North Queensland’s 20-year title drought, ruined retiring Justin Hodges’ finale and was the final coronation of Thurston as the finest player the code has witnessed. \nThis was not a grand final. This was in an unrivalled stratosphere. Truly magical. The Cowboys looked gone, trailing 16-12 before Thurston helped set up winger Kyle Feldt, who touched down after the full-time siren to level scores. \nIncredibly, Thurston’s conversion hit the right upright, but the setback was only a dramatic preamble to the extra-time heroics that franked his and North Queensland’s fairytale.
