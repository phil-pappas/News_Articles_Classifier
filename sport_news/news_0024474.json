Ndamukong Suh is sackless in Miami. Jimmy Graham doesn't have a 100-yard game with Seattle. \nSometimes it takes time to get used to a new team, new coaching staff and new system. \nMurray has only 130 yards rushing in four games with the Eagles and he's averaging just 2.7 yards per carry. The defending NFL rushing champion began last season with eight straight 100-yard games, breaking Hall of Famer Jim Brown's record. \nSuh got the richest contract for a defensive player from Miami. But the three-time All-Pro tackle hasn't played the way he did in Detroit. He has only one quarterback hurry in four games, and his unit ranks last in the NFL in both sacks and run defense. \nGraham didn't choose the Seahawks, but they traded to get him from the Saints. The three-time Pro Bowl tight end is on pace for 67 catches, 653 yards receiving and six TDs. Each would be his fewest since his rookie season in 2010. \nHere's a look at how other high-profile players have fared so far with their new teams: \nSAM BRADFORD: The Eagles traded Nick Foles and a second-round pick to get him from St. Louis. Bradford started the season like a guy still recovering from two ACL operations. He struggled through the first four games and threw two red-zone interceptions in the first half last week before rebounding with his best performance in a win over the Saints. \nFRANK GORE: He made a smart move leaving the 49ers, spurning the Eagles and signing with Indianapolis. The 32-year-old running back is on pace for another 1,000-yard season and the Colts (3-2) lead the NFC South . \nJEREMY MACLIN: After a Pro Bowl season in Philadelphia, Maclin reunited with his former coach Andy Reid in Kansas City. He's putting up big numbers and became the first Chiefs wide receiver to catch a TD in more than a year. \nLESEAN MCCOY: The two-time Pro Bowl running back didn't want to go to Buffalo but had no choice because the Eagles traded him for linebacker Kiko Alonso. Both players are having injury-plagued seasons. McCoy has missed two games and has 146 yards rushing, which is still more than Murray. \nJULIUS THOMAS: After missing the first four games with a finger injury, Thomas had two catches in Jacksonville's loss to Tampa Bay. Meanwhile, his old Broncos teammates are off to a 5-0 start. \nANDRE JOHNSON: Johnson had just seven catches through his first four games in Indianapolis until returning to face his old team. He had six receptions for 77 yards and two TDs in a win at Houston. \nBRANDON MARSHALL: The Bears certainly miss him, and Marshall is having an excellent season with the Jets (3-1). He has three consecutive 100-yard receiving games and 30 catches. \nRODNEY HUDSON: After anchoring Kansas City's offensive line for two seasons, Hudson joined the division-rival Raiders (2-3) and has bolstered the unit. The offensive line has been Oakland's strengths thanks to Hudson, one of the league's top centers. \nMIKE IUPATI: The three-time Pro Bowl guard left San Francisco for division-rival Arizona. He returned after missing the first three games because of injuries and is enjoying first place and blocking for Carson Palmer. \nORLANDO FRANKLIN: He got more money from San Diego to block for Philip Rivers, but left behind the undefeated Broncos. Franklin has missed the past two games and the Chargers are 2-3. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP_RobMaaddi \nAll content copyright ©2015 Daily Reporter, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:05:24.318+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
