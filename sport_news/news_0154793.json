Join us in the live chat for the latest news form the game.\nThe Indianapolis Colts managed to defeat Jacksonville without star quarterback Andrew Luck in Week 4, but it's not a situation they would prefer to continue. They may not have a choice, because Luck isn't expect to be in the lineup when they play at Houston on Thursday Night Football (5:30 p.m. PT/8:30 p.m. ET, KOIN-6 (CBS), NFL Network) .\nLuck is nursing an injured shoulder and isn't likely to play. If he can't play, the Colts will again turn to 40-year-old backup Matt Hasselbeck.\nHouston coach Bill O'Brien says Ryan Mallett will start at quarterback against the Colts. Mallett completed 12 of 27 passes for 150 yards with a passer rating of 46.8 before being benched in the loss against Atlanta. Mallett is on a very short leash and O'Brien will use the hook much faster is Mallett gets off to another poor start.\nIf you're looking to watch the Colts face the Texans, here's what you need to know.\nWhat : Indianapolis Colts at Houston Texans\nWhere : NRG Stadium, Houston Texas\nWhen : Thursday, Oct. 8, 5:30 p.m PT/8:30 p.m. ET\nTV : KOIN-6 (CBS), NFL Network\nWatch online : You can watch a live stream online on DirecTV's live stream package.\n-- Geoffrey C.
