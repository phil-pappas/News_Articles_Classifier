Christy Cabrera Chirinos Contact Reporter UM official: Golden will be evaluated after season is over \nBefore the Hurricanes played their first game, Miami Athletic Director Blake James was firm — any decision about the future of beleaguered football coach Al Golden would come at season's end. \nAnd Saturday night, minutes before the Hurricanes took the field at Doak Campbell Stadium for their annual matchup with in-state rival Florida State, James reiterated that point yet again. \n\"As I've said from the very start, we'll look at everything at the end of the year and do an evaluation,\" James said. \"Again, the thing you have to look at is if you lose [Saturday night], how many games are left? And you win all the rest of your games? That's why I think you always have to evaluate at the end of the year.\" \nNow in his fifth year with the Hurricanes, Golden finds himself on one of the hottest seats in college football despite Miami's 3-1 start. The Hurricanes went 6-7 a year ago — just their third losing season since 1980 — and lost four in a row to close out the season. It was a swoon reminiscent of Miami's 2013 finish, a year in which the Hurricanes started 7-0 then lost four of their last six to close the year. \nIn Golden's time at Miami, the Hurricanes have won just four games against ranked opponents, the most recent coming last season against Duke, a 22-10 win over the Blue Devils in late September. There have been four consecutive losses to FSU in Golden's tenure and bowl losses to Louisville and South Carolina since the end of the NCAA's investigation into the actions of a former booster.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:45:01.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
