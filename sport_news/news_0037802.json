The Cougars have needed late fourth-quarter surges the past two weeks to knock off East Carolina and Cincinnati, but don't expect the same against the winless Seahawks (0-6).\nHere are six numbers to keep an eye on for the Cougars-Seahawks matchup.\n13\nIt has been 13 years since BYU faced an opponent from the state of New York, dating back to 2002. The Gary Crowton-coached Cougars faced Syracuse at LaVell Edwards Stadium, winning 42-21.\n4\nBYU will likely be without four of its offensive starters on Saturday. Linemen Ului Lapuaho, Kyle Johnson and Ryker Mathews, along with running back Adam Hine, were not listed on Monday’s depth chart and will probably get two weeks of rest before the trip to San Jose State in November.\n85\nEven though many BYU fans are displeased with the Cougars' scheduling of FCS opponents, it isn't uncommon. Around 85 percent of FBS teams played or will play one (or more) FCS teams this season, and less than 20 play a strictly-FBS slate.\n5\nBYU will be the fifth FBS opponent Wagner faces over the past four seasons. Other teams include Rice, Florida International, Syracuse and Florida Atlantic, all of whom the Seahawks faced on the road.\n16,500\nAfter Wagner travels 4,392 miles to face the Cougars, BYU's October opponents will have accumulated over 16,000 miles of round-trip travel. BYU's opponents have experienced fourth-quarter lapses that come with the elevation and travel fatigue.\n3\nIt has been three seasons since BYU's game versus an FCS opponent was not on senior night. The last time was against Weber State in 2012. BYU won, 45-13.\nEmail: bensonsamb@gmail.com ; Twitter: @sambbenson.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T01:53:07.848+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
