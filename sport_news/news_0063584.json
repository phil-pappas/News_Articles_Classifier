Bailey said. “We gave up a total of minus three yards of total offense against Pilot Rock. This was a total team effort on defense with 16 kids recording either a tackle or an assist. “We were able to play our younger players in the second half and they rose to the challenge and helped secure the shutout,” he said. “In last week’s games we had a few injuries to some starters, so this was a game for the next guy up to contribute and they did a tremendous job.” Ethan Reger racked up 102 yards on the ground for W-M, as the TigerScots had 272 rushing yards on 28 carries in the game. Brett Speed was 4-of-8 passing for the TigerScots, throwing for three touchdowns. Pilot Rock was limited to minus-28 yards rushing on 19 carries. “Credit goes out to Pilot Rock, they fought hard the entire game and played with class despite the score,” Bailey said. “There are some good athletes on Pilot Rock’s team, we were just able to control the line of scrimmage and play sound, fundamental defense the entire game.” Kirk Scott was good on 4-of-7 extra point kicks, and also made a 30-yard field goal in the victory. “We were able to answer some questions in this game in our kicking game,” Bailey said. “This will help us as we continue to fight for a playoff spot in our tremendously difficult league.” The TigerScots host Irrigon on Friday.
