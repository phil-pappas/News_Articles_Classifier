So we’re going to work our way through this.”\nAfter beating the New York Islanders, 5-3, on Friday, Gustavsson has a 2.50 goals-against average and .896 save percentage to go with his 2-0-0 record. Rask, the 2014 Vezina Trophy winner, has a 4.40 GAA, .854 save percentage and 1-3-0 record.\nThe B’s have helped out their backup by playing two of their better 60-minute games in front of Gustavsson. Considering he joined the team as a free agent on a tryout, missed some of training camp because of the birth of his daughter and only played a couple preseason games, Gustavsson has managed to forge some quick chemistry.\n“When you’re on a team as a goalie, usually it takes maybe a couple games before the team gets to know you on the ice and vice versa,” Gustavsson said. “But I feel like we’re starting to get good reads off each other, around the net, behind the net, all that.\n“So we still have some things we can work on. But I feel like so far, the progress has been good, and we’re going in the right direction.”\nAlthough Julien’s doing his best to avoid a goaltender controversy, the numbers are going to have to improve to silence the Rask doubters. Having Gustavsson play well, though, is a luxury the Bruins like considering the struggles they went through with Niklas Svedberg ’s inconsistent play last season. The B’s have always been their best when someone like Anton Khudobin or Chad Johnson has been able to fill in seamlessly.\n“It’s nice to see him come in and win some big games for us,” Julien said of Gustavsson.\nNo bed of roses\nJulien said Thursday that Matt Beleskey ’s upper-body injury stemmed from “getting up on the wrong side of the bed,” and the forward didn’t deny that yesterday.\n“It was nothing I can really remember. But it’s getting better every day, and I felt pretty good out there today,” said Beleskey, who’s missed two games and remains day-to-day. . . .\nForward Brad Marchand took a maintenance day and center Patrice Bergeron was given the day off to be with his wife and newborn son, according to Julien.\nNews duds unveiled\nThe Bruins unveiled the special uniform they will wear in the 2016 Bridgestone NHL Winter Classic against the Montreal Canadiens at Gillette Stadium on Jan. 1.\nThe jersey is a tribute to the Bruins’ original season of 1924 with the exception of the black and gold coloring. The black jersey features gold stripes on the arms, large white numbering, a crewneck neck line and a crest similar to the 1924 crest.\nLeader of the pack\nBruins center David Krejci woke up yesterday atop the NHL scoring charts with 12 points. Per Elias, Krejci is the first B’s player to record at least one point in each of the team’s first seven games of a season since 1992-93, when Joe Juneau (seven goals, 15 assists) and Dmitri Kvartalnov (12 goals, 10 assists) did so through the first 14 games.\nKrejci’s not impressed.\n“It’s just a number, you know. It’s just stats,” he said. “There’s so many people that just look at stats. But at the end of the day, if you win the game, if you win the (Stanley) Cup, who cares?”", "external_links": ["http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url=", "https://twitter.com/share?text=Bruins+notebook%3A+Backup+goalie+has+been+solid%2C+while+Tuukka+has+been+shaky"], "published": "2015-10-25T13:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:25:44.735+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
