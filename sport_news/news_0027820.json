Jones, USA TODAY Sports © Aaron Doster, USA TODAY Sports Aaron Doster, USA TODAY Sports RENTON, Wash. – Look around the Seattle Seahawks locker room, and so many names and faces are the synonymous with a burgeoning NFC dynasty. Russell Wilson. Richard Sherman. Marshawn Lynch.\nAdChoices And yet, watch the Seahawks on the field through the first five weeks of the season, and too often, it looked like a completely different group, especially while relinquishing a 24-7 fourth-quarter lead last week in Cincinnati. Where was that defense that used to put a stranglehold on teams in the fourth quarter? Where was the late-game magic from Wilson?\nNow that the Seahawks are 2-3, heading into Sunday’s game against the 4-0 Carolina Panthers, it might finally time to truly be concerned about the state of Seahawks.\n“I would say we're not going to panic. But we know there is some urgency to get our stuff together,” wide receiver Doug Baldwin told USA TODAY Sports. “We've been in every game we've played, we've played hard, we've just had some minor mistakes. Easily correctable mistakes.”\nIt isn’t an entirely unfamiliar situation for Seattle, who was 3-3 after six games last year, including consecutive losses in Weeks 5 and 6 to the Dallas Cowboys (at home) and St. Louis Rams. The Seahawks rebounded from that to reel off nine wins in their final 10 games.\n“It shows you can do it,” Wilson said. “But the challenge is still there.”\nBut there are several significant problems the Seahawks must fix, and fix quickly, to make a similar midseason run this year.\nOffensive line struggles\nWilson has been sacked 22 times in five games, tied for the most in the league with the Kansas City Chiefs' Alex Smith.\n“It is unacceptable,” left tackle Russell Okung told USA TODAY Sports. “We can’t get the quarterback hit that much. I definitely take a lot of blame for it. That’s because I’m the left tackle, and it’s because I’m part of this offensive line.”\nOkung, the longest tenured member of the line, is responsible for two of the sacks, and two additional hits, according to stats from Pro Football Focus, so the issues are clearly bigger than just blindside protection. The Seahawks have a line that includes two starters who played defensive line in college (center Drew Nowak and right guard J.R. Sweezy), a left guard who played right tackle last year (Justin Britt) and a former college tight end (Garry Gilliam) at right tackle, and the group wasn’t finalized until late in the preseason.\nSeattle Seahawks Passing Performance Per Game in 2015 | PointAfter\nOffensive coordinator Darrell Bevell said this week he thinks that group played its “best game to date” against the Bengals. But when they still surrendered four sacks in that game, it shows plenty of room for improvement. Wilson said Thursday he feels some of that burden himself, to deliver the ball more quickly and to make smart decisions when scrambling and not take unnecessary hits. Even though Wilson has proven to be exceptionally durable, that sort of beating eventually could catch up to him.\n“You’ve got to continually trust those guys. You can’t really say, OK I got hit on this last time, I’m going to get hit again. You just have to say, I trust them,” Bevell said. “You have to continually remind yourself that that’s not happening every play, and it’s just communicating and talking about it.”\nLegion of Boom lapses\nSeattle’s secondary doesn’t seem to be terrifying opposing offenses – at least not the good ones – like it once did. That was evident last week in Cincinnati, when the Bengals found two weak spots in pass coverage to exploit repeatedly: strong safety Kam Chancellor in coverage against the tight end, and cornerback Cary Williams. Williams proved to be such a liability against A.J. Green early in the game that the Seahawks had to switch their coverage scheme mid-game and assign Sherman, who rarely ever leaves his post at left corner, to shadow Green from left to right and in the slot.\nThere have been technique issues – defensive coordinator Kris Richard said Williams in particular had some breakdowns last week against the Bengals – and communication problems on the back end between safeties and corners that Richard described as “critical errors.”\n“We weren’t really relentless like we’ve been in the past. We weren’t fighting for everything. We weren’t really just giving it everything we had, it my eye,” free safety Earl Thomas said.\nThe Seahawks still have the NFL’s No. 7 pass defense, but some of the aura is missing, especially after the loss to Cincinnati. If Andy Dalton isn’t afraid to fire passes down the seam against Chancellor or target Green even when he’s covered by Sherman, what’s going to scare off future opponents like the Pittsburgh Steelers and Arizona Cardinals later in the year?\nThe defensive issues have been especially glaring in the fourth quarter, an issue that dates back to February, when the Seahawks couldn’t close out the New England Patriots in the Super Bowl. They also relinquished late leads this year to the St. Louis Rams and Green Bay Packers before last week’s collapse in Cincinnati.\n“Concerned? It’s disappointing more than concerned,” Richard said.\nAn ineffective Jimmy Graham\nThe biggest knock on the Seahawks offense last year was the lack of a big-time, red zone target for Russell Wilson. It seemed like the Seahawks fixed it with the mega-trade for all pro tight end Jimmy Graham in March. And yet five weeks into the season, he has just 21 catches and two touchdowns. His catch total ranks him eighth among NFL tight ends, but he’s only second on his team in catches (behind slot receiver Doug Baldwin) and third in yards (behind receivers Jermaine Kearse and Baldwin) – hardly the transformative effect anyone envisioned for a player with 26 touchdowns in the previous two seasons.\nThe Seahawks offense is never going to resemble New Orleans’ spread passing game that Drew Brees used to run so well and that gave Graham so many passing opportunities, but the onus is on offensive coordinator Darrell Bevel to figure out new ways to get Graham involved, rather than just hoping he can fit into the Seahawks run-first scheme.\nJimmy Graham Career Receptions and Average Reception Distance | PointAfter\n“We need to find ways to get him more involved, but not force it,” Wilson said. “He’s a special player. He’s one of a kind, so we’ve got to find that.”\nThe Seahawks in 2013 orchestrated a major trade for another unique offensive player, receiver Percy Harvin. For many on- and off-field reasons that trade didn’t work out, but the Seahawks cannot afford for this Graham move to be a bust too.\nFollow Lindsay H.
