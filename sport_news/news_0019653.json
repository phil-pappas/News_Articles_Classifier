Wagner's worst start in football history was 0-7 in 1955 when the team played only seven games. The 1954 team lost its first six before finishing 2-7. \nWagner College is a private, liberal arts college founded in 1883 with an enrollment of approximately 2,500 total students. \nBYU wide receiver coach Guy Holliday is preparing his players like it is any other game. He knows upsets are always a possibility in college football, no matter the situation. \n\"It's no different than any other game. You got to come and play every week. Those kids are on scholarship too. We have to show up and play and be consistent and be who we are,\" Holliday said. \"It's not about who you are playing. I say it every week, but I think the game is about us and not about or opponent.\" \nWhen asked about Wagner not being much of a challenge, he responded obliviously to the stats, records and history of Wagner's football program. \n\"I don't know what team you are looking at. I think every body gives you a challenge. If I approach my guys that way, who am I? I am not leading them,\" Holliday said. \"I have to lead them to an understanding that everybody is capable of playing well that day. It's not the best team that wins games, it's about who plays the best on that Friday or Saturday or whenever you play that wins.\" BYU wide receiver Mitch Mathews (10) catches a pass as Cincinnati safety Mike Tyson (5) tries to tackle him during a football game at the LaVell Edwards Stadium in Provo Friday, Oct. 16, 2015. (Kristin Murphy, Deseret News) \nBYU head coach Bronco Mendenhall mentioned earlier in the week that BYU will play its best players for the appropriate amount of time to secure a win, meaning that Tanner Mangum will be the starting quarterback for the 1 p.m. MT kickoff at LaVell Edwards Stadium. \nFor wide receiver Mitch Mathews, his mindset doesn't change because he is playing a less-talented team compared to the tough opponents he faced at the beginning of the year. \n\"It doesn't. I am a big believer that. With all the accolades in the world you can slide backwards at any time. Especially this week and the bye week a lot of people say it is two bye weeks in a row. But really this week in practice has not been any easier,\" Mathews said. \"I almost forget who we are playing this week because we practice the same as if we are playing Michigan or UCLA.\" \nWagner is aiming to get its first win of the season and playing potentially the best opponent on its schedule this season against BYU. This does not mean that it won't be a competitive game Saturday. \n\"The bottom line is that they have everything to gain and we have everything to lose. We have to come out here and freakin' play like we play every week in a frenzy,\" Holliday said. \"And hopefully we won't wait until the fourth quarter to play really well.\" \nListen to audio from Wednesday's postpractice media availability from Holliday, Mathews and lineman Austin Hoyt in the \"Cougar Cuts\" section below. Tanner is a student at Brigham Young University studying Business Management. He is from the great northwest of Portland, Oregon. He hopes to find a profession that combines his passion of sports broadcasting and marketing.
