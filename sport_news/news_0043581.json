See more photos at arkansasonline.com/galleries \nLooking nothing like a one-victory team entering Thursday's 6A-South Conference game, Texarkana rode the arm of Keandre Banks and a stiff defense to a 35-14 victory over Little Rock Parkview. \nBanks completed 14 of 22 passes for 214 yards and senior running back Kushaiah Jones scored three touchdowns as the Razorbacks (2-6, 2-3) rolled to a victory on a dusty War Eagles Stadium field. \nParkview (5-3, 2-3) managed 278 total yards, but the bulk of that came on four pass plays. \nBanks, who also rushed for 77 yards, tossed two touchdowns -- a 54-yarder to Dre Taylor and a 9-yarder to Jones, both coming in the second quarter. \nJones, who finished with 58 yards rushing on 8 carries and caught 4 passes for 41 yards, scored his final two touchdowns in the fourth quarter on runs of 4 and 2 yards. \nSylvester Henderson led Texarkana in receiving with six catches for 74 yards. \nTexarkana finished with 401 yards of total offense. \nParkview quarterback Kollan Jackson completed 10 of 23 passes for 199 yards and 1 touchdown. He also ran for 67 yards on 21 carries. Senior Kolby McNeal caught five passes for 129 yards. \nTexarkana scored on three of its first four possessions and led 21-0 with 4:51 left before halftime. \nThe Razorbacks threatened to add to their lead late in the first half, but Texarkana ran out of downs at the Parkview 24 with 58 seconds remaining. \nParkview used just three plays to cut Texarkana's lead to 21-7. Despite being in triple coverage, McNeal hauled in a 44-yard pass on the first play of the drive to move the Patriots to the Texarkana 31. Two plays later, Jackson beat a hard-charging pass rush and hit Aman James down the right sideline for a 30-yard touchdown with 19 seconds left in the half. \nTexarkana dominated the first two quarters, finishing the first half with a 296-197 advantage in total yards. \nJones returned the opening kickoff 53 yards to set up the Razorbacks on the Parkview 43. Texarkana used five plays to take a 7-0 lead. Kaviron Oliver scored from the 1 with 10:16 left, and Tyler Braswell added the extra point. \nBanks, who completed his first 6 passes and finished the first half 7 of 11 for 164 yards, connected with Taylor for a 54-yard touchdown on a fourth-and-3 play on the third play of the second quarter. After Braswell's extra point, Texarkana led 14-0. \nTexarkana drove 80 yards on 11 plays to score its final touchdown of the first half. A 38-yard pass from Banks to Tim Stuckey set up the Razorbacks on the Parkview 9. Three plays later, Jones caught a 9-yard scoring pass with 4:51 left before halftime. \nSports on 10/23/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:40:41.638+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
