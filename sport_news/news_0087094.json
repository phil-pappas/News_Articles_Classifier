Green is who Calvin Johnson used to be The Sports Quotient 16 hrs ago Alison Fu Â© Joe Robbins/Getty Images Bengals wide receiver A.J. Green is stepping up his game after a difficult 2014. A little over a week ago, Calvin \"Megatron\" Johnson turned 30, an age that sees many players begin their decline. In response, the star wide receiver for the Detroit Lions brushed off having reached the milestone:\nAdChoices \"[I'm] still young at heart,\" Johnson said. \"Maybe a few more aches and pains in the body, just more maintenance you have to do.\" Despite that assertion, Johnson has been showing his age, as well as his lingering issues with injury. Johnson broke Jerry Rice's record for yards in a single season with 1,964 in 2012, but he had just 1,077 in 2014. He also dropped to under 100 yards per game for the first time since 2011.\nJohnson's decrease in numbers is, in part, due to his history of ankle and knee problems. In 2013, he played throughout the season with a partially torn PCL, or posterior cruciate ligament, after injuring his knee in Week 5. This led to him sitting out Weeks 5 and 17, but he still ended the season with 1,492 yards and 12 touchdowns.\nIn 2014, however, Johnson again dealt with knee issues, which were exacerbated when he sustained high ankle sprain in Week 3. This noticeably affected Johnson's play on the field and also limited him to just 13 games and 71 receptions, which was his lowest since 2009 when he suffered an ACL injury and fractured three fingers.\nJohnson's injuries, and his resulting less-than-dominant play, led the Lions to sign Golden Tate from the Seattle Seahawks in 2014 in the hopes of strengthening the WR position. Tate had a fine season, ending with 99 receptions for 1,331 yards and making his first Pro Bowl. This also shows that the Megatron Era is pretty much over.\nWhile Johnson is experiencing the inevitable regression that comes with extended time in the league, Cincinnati Bengals WR A.J. Green is in the prime of his career. The 27-year-old was drafted fourth overall in the 2011 NFL Draft and has made the Pro Bowl every year he has been in the NFL. This season, however, Green's first two games were nothing spectacular. This, combined with an underwhelming 2014 season, immediately stirred up talk about his potential decline.\nThere is no need to worry about Green becoming less productive. His decreased 2014 numbers were due to a toe injury he suffered in Week 2, which caused him to sit out three games as well as extended chunks of two others. Despite his decreased playing time, Green still ended the season with 1,041 yards and 6 touchdowns.\nIn the first two games this season, Green only recorded 63 and 45 yards, respectively. In Week 3 at the Baltimore Ravens, though, he had a breakout game, catching 10 balls for 227 yards as well as two fourth-quarter touchdowns.\nThere is no way for a player to maintain the way he played at his prime throughout his entire career. Johnson is still on pace to have a 1,000+-yard season but is unlikely to get close to his record-breaking stats from 2012 again. Despite that, he still holds significant value as a wide receiver and is a key player on the Lions roster.\nOn the other hand, Green is in his prime, and despite falling off a bit last season, there is no reason to believe that he will not bounce back and re-establish himself as one of the best wide receivers in the NFL.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://thesportsquotient.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:44:33.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
