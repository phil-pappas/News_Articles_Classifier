(AP Photo/Matt Slocum) more > By   \nNEW YORK (AP) - New York Mets reliever Hansel Robles has been suspended for three games for throwing near the head of a batter after both teams had been warned. \nMajor League Baseball announced the suspension and an unspecified fine Thursday, a day after Robles and manager Terry Collins were ejected in the sixth inning of a 7-5 loss to the Philadelphia Phillies. \nIn the third, Mets slugger Yoenis Cespedes left the game with bruises on two fingers of his left hand after he was hit by a pitch. \nCespedes’ replacement, Kirk Nieuwenhuis, later was hit. After that, Odubel Herrera of the Phillies was plunked in the back. Then both teams were warned. \nRobles called his pitch to Cameron Rupp “a fastball that got away.” Collins said that “you can’t miss that bad up around the head.” \nUnless it is appealed, Robles’ suspension will start Friday at home against the Washington Nationals. The right-hander is 4-3 with a 3.57 ERA in 56 appearances this season. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:18:12.421+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
