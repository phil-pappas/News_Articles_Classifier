(AP) - Three New Hampshire health systems are partnering with an insurer to create a new company that will analyze clinical, financial and operational data to improve the quality and efficiency of patient care.\nBenevera Health brings together Dartmouth-Hitchcock, Elliot Health System, Frisbie Memorial Hospital and Harvard Pilgrim Health Care. The project builds on the ElevateHealth network they created in 2013, and will involve all of Harvard Pilgrim's 160,000 New Hampshire customers.\nOfficials say that by sharing data about what's working, providers will be able to provide better care earlier. New health advocates also will reach out to patients to coordinate care.\nThe partners together are investing tens of millions in the venture. Harvard Pilgrim says it expects 2016 premiums will be about 4 percent lower than they would be without the partnership.\nThis story has been corrected to show that Harvard Pilgrim has 160,000 customers, not 80,000.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
