Everyone wants to know if they can do anything for me. I didn't realize how many friends I had until a couple nights ago when I started to let people know what was going on and then my phone started blowing up with all the text messages,\" Huffman said. \"I've also heard from a lot of the fans, which is really nice. I am trying to get back to them as much as possible, because that's a priority for me. If it wasn't for the fans, I would be nothing. I want to acknowledge them.\" \nNate Huffman, with his wife Michelle and his son Christian. (Photo: For the Enquirer) \nHuffman, 40, was a standout basketball player in college at Lansing Community College and all-league player later at Central Michigan University from 1995-97. Initially, Huffman played professionally in the Continental Basketball League for the Idaho Stampede before going to Europe to play in Spain and then later for Maccabi Tel Aviv, where he was coached by current Cleveland Cavaliers coach David Blatt. He later signed an NBA contract with the Raptors, but injuries cut his NBA career short. \nHuffman's Facebook page has been awash with comments from fans from the Tel Aviv area, as he is remembered from his days when he was 'Nate the Great' for Maccabi Tel Aviv and was MVP of the FIBA SuproLeague, as well as being voted the best American Player in Europe. The Maccabi team wrote via Twitter, \"Sending our deepest well wishes to Nate Huffman, one of our best players ever, in battling his illness. Hang in there big guy.\" \n\"There have been stories upon stories about how much of an impact he had on people's lives in Israel and that has truly been amazing,\" his wife Michelle Huffman said. \"I didn't know him then. I heard about those playing days. But I didn't know how much he was loved over there. But now reading all the stories people are posting and the outreach and all the prayers being sent out, it has been been awesome.\" \nWhile putting on a brave face, Huffman, however, does grasp the reality he is living with. He just chooses to be strong for everyone around him, even while he finds it hard to stand up with searing back pain, brought on by the cancer. \nNate Huffman (Photo: The Enquirer) \n\"I have a 6-year-old son, a wife, great friends. There's no reason why I am ready to go to the next place. But I just figured I can't pout about it because that will just wear me down. I'm just trying to stay positive, realizing this is some bad news I have to deal with,\" Huffman said. \"I am a Christian, I believe God has a plan for me. So, in my own way, I have been praying 'if you want me now, take me, if you want me to live, then so be it.' It's in his hands and I'm O.K. with what happens.\" \nWhile he has learned to adapt, with a few weeks to deal with it, the initial news was shocking. \nHuffman said he had felt a lump near his groin for months, but it wasn't painful, so it wasn't anything he was worried about. Eventually, he saw a doctor and the initial diagnosis was a hernia, for which he was going to have surgery. \nBefore the surgery could be scheduled, severe back pain gave Huffman the idea that things could be worse than he thought. After tests and an MRI two weeks ago, he was diagnosed with the cancer and everything in his world changed. \n\"That was very tough. It is obviously something you never expect to hear or have to go through,\" Michelle Huffman said. \"We were both in shock. Really, we are still in shock. It is still very surreal. We are just kind of pondering what life looks like from here on out, figuring out how to react. \n\"Our son will be 6 in October. We are just making sure Nate has as much time to spend with us and with the time he has left, create some happy memories that we can all share going forward.\" \nNate admits that thoughts of his family being without him is the biggest challenge facing him. \n\"Last night, we told my son Christian what was going on. He was asking questions like, if Daddy goes to heaven, can he come back? I think he understood I may be gone some day, but I'm not sure how much he really understands,\" Nate said. \"Telling him is really one of the hardest things I've had to deal with in all of this.\" \nIf you would like to help the family, a gofundme.com page has been created - titled Help Nate Huffman battle cancer. 94 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://bcene.ws/1RnvXvI TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T00:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:57:50.500+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
