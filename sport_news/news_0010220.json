Since then, the Co-Op operated in a temporary space and raised half a million dollars for a new store. \nA new sign and new lease on business for Co-Op Natural Foods, which has just finished renovating this former movie rental store into its now-permanent location. \n\"I was afraid after the fire they might not--but I'm sure glad they did,\" Co-Op Natural Foods Member Linda Florey said. \nThe burglary and arson in January of 2014 remains unsolved to this day. But its 3,000 members raised half a million dollars for the store to rebuild. The Co-Op remained open during that process, which is finally complete. \n\"They have really kind of modernized it. It makes it easier to find things,\" shopper Lana Smith said. \nThe organic produce section is now three times its original size and the refrigerated and frozen section is also larger. \nA big chunk of the money was spent on the Co-Op's new refrigeration system, which includes a walk-in cooler. Before the Co-Op couldn't keep local product in supply as long as it needed to, but this space allows that to happen. \n\"It's beautiful--all the new coolers--I just commented to my daughter-in-law that there are so many more choices in fruit and vegetables now,\" Florey said. \nThere's also a new kitchen, which allows the Co-Op to offer prepared foods. \nCo-Op Natural Foods General Manger Molly Langley: That is new. Angela Kennecke: And that is what the consumer wants, isn't it? Langley: That's exactly what the consumer wants. They want more organic produce choices, they want more local and they want dinner--some version of dinner ready. \nThe Co-Op now has 60 local suppliers and more than 10 percent of every sale is from locally produced products. The Co-Op credits its members for this success story, nearly two years in the making. \n\"In the end, I keep thinking of things like up from the ashes. Just with Phoenix, we rose out of the ashes and now we are better and closer to what they wanted and in a location that seems pleasing to people,\" Langley said. \nSo much so, business is up 40 percent over last year at this same time. \nThe Co-Op says some of the money it has left over from its membership drive will be used to hire and train more workers. And while it is membership driven, anyone can shop there.
