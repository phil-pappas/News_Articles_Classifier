And in the process, he also took out shortstop Ruben Tejada, who suffered a fractured right leg.\nIn the game’s most pivotal moment, Utley, with an apparent late slide, upended Tejada as the Mets attempted a double play that would have paroled them from the seventh inning with a 2-1 lead. The double play looked almost impossible to turn, but that was not the Mets’ biggest problem.\nInstead of being tied, they were down moments later.\nInstead, the Dodgers went on to manufacture a four-run rally that was the difference in the 5-2 Mets defeat Saturday that evened the NLDS at 1-1.\nWith one out and runner on first and third — Utley was on first via a pinch-hit single that ended Noah Syndergaard’s night and brought on Bartolo Colon — Howie Kendrick sent a smash toward the middle.\nSecond baseman Daniel Murphy gloved the ball and sent an off-balanced — and high — flip to Tejada who caught the ball and spun. Utley came in late to the right of the base and took out Tejada. Utley hit the back of Tejada’s right leg, but also took a shot to the head from Tejada’s left knee. Tejada was carted off the field with his right leg in an inflatable cast for his fractured right fibula.\nUtley-Tejada collision.

But replays showed Tejada did not touch the base, so Dodger manager Don Mattingly challenged. The Dodgers won the challenge after a review of 4:52.\nMaking the play all the more bizarre was that Utley, by replays, never appeared to touch the base before leaving the field. But the review was upheld on the basis of a force play, officials ruled.\nI'm very angry about that brutal dirty slide and confused as to how someone can be ruled safe without touching a base????\n— Anthony Recker (@Anthony_Recker) October 11, 2015 \n\n“Prior to accepting the challenge, the umpires on the field determined the play to be reviewable as a force play and not the neighborhood play,” a spokesman for MLB said. “After viewing all relevant angles, the Replay Official definitively determined that the fielder’s foot was not in contact with second base at any time when he had possession of the ball. The call is OVERTURNED, the runner is safe.”\nAnd the night got worse for the Mets as Los Angeles, having tied the game 2-2 on the play, added a two-run double by Adrian Gonzalez and an RBI double by former Met Justin Turner.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chase utley ,  new york mets ,  ruben tejada", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T15:10:42.551+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
