Real Salt Lake (11-13-8) is tied for eighth, six points back of the Timbers. \nJamison Olave was given a straight red card in the 52nd minute for taking down Lucas Melano in a goal-scoring position. Nick Rimando picked the wrong direction on Adi's penalty kick. \nAdi had a close-range shot saved in the 21st, and Rimando came out of his box to block Adi's fast-break attempt in the 44th. \nAdam Kwarasey preserved his MLS-leading 13th shutout with a reaction save of Javier Morales deflected shot in the 91st. \nCopyright © The Associated Press.
