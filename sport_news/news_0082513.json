He unleashed rounds full of powerful swings in batting practice, driving the ball as if it threatened him. To the casual onlooker, Gomes looks like the most prepared, powerful hitter on this potent Royals roster.\nExcept he’s not on it. He has no chance of playing in tonight’s game, with the Royals leading the Toronto Blue Jays, 2-0, in the ALCS, or in the series at all. And if they oust Toronto and reach the World Series for the second straight year, the man whose grand slam brought the Red Sox to a Game 4 victory two years ago will likely still be on the bench, with six other outfielders in front of him.\n“I’m 100 percent ready if my number ever gets called,” Gomes said.\nGomes was traded to the Royals by Atlanta in late August. He’s had just 30 at-bats in more than a month, and the Royals opted for 29-year-old rookie Paulo Orlando — 53 strikeouts and five walks to go with a pedestrian .713 OPS in the regular season — and Terrance Gore — more career stolen bases (eight) than at-bats (four) — on their postseason rosters.\n“I say, if you have a really nice car, you need really nice insurance,” Gomes, in his fourth straight postseason and sixth in the last eight seasons (for five different teams), said. “So, I’m playing an insurance role over here.”\nGomes still takes batting practice and shags fly balls. He still studies video and attends meetings, preparing as if he’s playing every night, just like he did in Boston, ultimately cracking manager John Farrell’s lineups.\nThe Royals are happy to have him around.\n“I’ll tell you what, for that guy not to be on our playoff roster, it’s good to have him traveling with us wherever we go,” outfielder Jarrod Dyson said. “Because behind the scenes, he does the most. As far as watching videos, trying to pick up things on pitchers, whatever they’re trying to do, Jonny is our go-to guy.\n“He’s like the father of the bunch.”\nBut to be the father of a team that has the second-oldest roster in the majors with an average age of 29, one must be on the back end of his career.\nFrom when the Red Sox signed him in 2013 until they traded him in July 2014, Gomes took 612 plate appearances, hitting .242 with 19 homers and 84 RBI. He hasn’t played much since.\nIn about the same length of time since that July, he’s taken just 337 plate appearances with three different teams (Oakland A’s, Braves and Royals), hitting .218 with seven homers and 31 RBI.\nGomes has a $3 million team option for 2016 but has no idea if the Royals will pick it up. As he’s done five times already in his career, he’s preparing as if he’ll be a free agent.\n“I have bat and glove, will travel,” he said. “I just want to win.”\nGomes said he’s fully healthy, but appeared in just 95 games. Time might be running out on his blue-collar career, one he built on sweat and heart, but to him there’s no end in sight.\n“There will have to be a lot of people involved in ripping the jersey off me,” he said.\nTonight, Jonny Gomes is determined to help the Royals get to the World Series. Even if he doesn’t take a single at-bat.\n“I’m so glad he’s here,” Dyson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:06:48.443+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
