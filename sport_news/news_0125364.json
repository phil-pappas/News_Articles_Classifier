For years, he’s been known as a prominent offensive post player but he had his best year defensively in his first season in Chicago.\nAs dominant as he is on the court, Pau is still able to enjoy cultural activities like Operas.\nIt’s kind of hard to miss him at an Opera because of his height. I’m not sure if there are a lot of 7-footers that frequent the events, but it must be hard being the person that has to sit behind Gasol.", "external_links": ["https://instagram.com/p/8cREqfn2DV/"], "published": "2015-10-05T17:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:06:16.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
