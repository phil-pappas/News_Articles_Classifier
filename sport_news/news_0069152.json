Lafayette.\nAnd, Frank Tavani said Sunday, \"That's fine.\"\n\"Take your shot when people are down,\" the veteran Lafayette coach said. \"And make it your best shot. We will get this turned around. I can't tell you when, but we'll try to do what we can in these last four league games in five weeks.\"\nThe Leopards fell to 1-6 for the season when they were routed by Harvard 42-0 on Saturday. Maybe this time they hit bottom because, after scoring at least one touchdown in other defeats, they were shut out by the Crimson. In fact, Lafayette had scored points in 162 consecutive games since being whitewashed by Penn 37-0 in 2001.\nTavani said a couple of people on the Lafayette sideline on Saturday heard some disparaging remarks from people in the stands and told him about them.\nWhen it was suggested that some people out there might actually enjoy watching him squirm, he said, \"That's OK if they're getting their enjoyment out of that and all the things that go with it. We have not accepted it; we're handling it. I don't hear those things, and they don't matter. I have only one concern. My young men. Period.\"\nA season that started out with a good deal of potential has turned into a nightmare fit for the Halloween holiday. You can't have a conversation with Tavani without touching on the Lafayette injury merry-go-round. It seems to go on and on and the Leopards continue going in circles rather than getting ahead.\nAt last count, 11 players, including five starters and one who was on verge of becoming a starter, have suffered season-ending injuries.\nAs Lafayette gets ready to face Holy Cross on Saturday in Worcester, Mass., Tavani has another list of 11 players who are either out or doubtful. \"And doubtful means they won't be cleared until maybe Friday, so they miss practice all week,\" he added.\nTanner Kern, who Tavani said \"has been awesome for a freshman center,\" is on the doubtful and \"is a big concern\" with an ankle injury. Cornerback Matt Smalley, who sat out Saturday with a hamstring injury, is likely to be out again, even though he may think he's ready to return.\nThe Lafayette secondary has taken its haymaker hits in recent weeks, and now it faces the punch of Holy Cross junior Peter Pujals, who was 35-for-50 for 508 yards and four touchdowns as the Crusaders took unbeaten Fordham to overtime before losing on Saturday.\nAlthough Harvard finished with 500 yards of offense on Saturday night in Fisher Stadium, Tavani on Sunday said that the Leopards' defense \"came up with some nice stops.\" And although Harvard was held to 3-and-out just twice, Lafayette linebacker and captain Mark Dodd did stop the Crimson on fourth-and-1 at the Leopards' 14 in the second quarter when the score was just 14-0. But the offense could do nothing on the next three downs; Harvard blocked Ryan Forrester's punt to set up a short field, and the Crimson scored with 22 seconds left in the half to make it 21-0.\nTavani called it \"a complete implosion of the offense\" and added, \"with the lack of a running game, it's hard. I've never won many games like that, if any. Some guys are playing pretty beat up besides, being young, and when you struggle, lots of things get magnified.\"\nThe average yards per game for the running attack dropped to 44.7 after Saturday's loss, and Tavani said, \"Who would that irritate more than me?\" And a 2-for-15 third-down statistic didn't sit well, either.\nHoly Cross, he said, \"will be all pumped up after watching everyone else roll the Leopards, but we'll go in there and fight for four quarters. We don't expect sympathy.\"\nRetired sports columnist Paul Reinhard is a freelance writer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:52:51.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
