This team has struggled with the pressure, and we were able to keep our nerves down and overcome.\" \nA West Albany team that placed third in the Class 6A state tournament last season and won the conference title a year ago couldn't keep up with the offense that West Salem produced. \nJunior outside hitter Paige Whipple had 19 kills by hitting .548 and junior middle blocker Delaney Smith had 12 kills by hitting .647. \nThe setting of Kelly, who had 39 assists, was key, but Kelly also had three blocks and disrupted West Albany's offense from the front row. \n\"She's definitely very smart with her placement,\" said Whipple, who also had 10 digs and two aces. \"The setters have setters practice every day before practice. All they do is reps, reps, so that they're setting the same ball, consistent spot every time, and it's just clicked with Mattie and she's starting to get really consistent. \n\"I've never seen her block like that. It was amazing. And she's really been working. She's been going to training and stuff, working on her vertical and she's gotten so much better.\" \nBoth teams started the match hitting high percentages in the first set. West Albany led at 19-18 until Delaney Smith's kill started a 7-0 West Salem run to clinch the first set. \nWest Salem led almost the entirety of the second set and Kelly worked different hitters into the offense and into different positions. \nWest Albany led the early stages of the third set until Whipple broke a 13-13 tie with a kill, a block and a kill for three straight points to launch the Titans to a 10-1 run, capped off by two consecutive aces by Whipple for a 21-14 lead. \nThe development of the Titans from even a few weeks ago is remarkable. The team is playing error-free and asserted itself as a team to contend with on the state level. \n\"We've been escalating ever since our first game,\" Kelly said. \"We haven't hit our rough patch yet so it's nice that we're continually improving every match, every game, every practice.\" \nbpoehler@StatesmanJournal.com, (503) 399-6701 or twitter.com/bpoehler \nWest Salem d.
