That’s a scary thing for us. Our focus has to be on where we’re supposed to be. We have to make them drive the ball. \n“We need to limit big plays,” Martin added. “That goes to the back end of the defense. Our back end guys have got to be more aggressive and get off blocks.” \n“That’s where we’re at as a program. We have to challenge individuals to see where they can improve on a weekly basis.” \nIf anything, the problems posed by WMU (3-3, 2-0) might be even more daunting than NIU’s. The Huskies had only four players score at least one touchdown in their 45-12 win last Saturday. Six different Broncos reached the end zone against the Bobcats. \n“It does put a lot of stress on you, because there’s no much more you have to prepare for during the week and there’s so much more going through your head when you’re out there,” senior linebacker Kent Kern said after the NIU game. “You’re playing more reactionary than you would be against a normal team where you know what they’re doing.” \nConfounding Miami’s approach are injury problems, especially in the secondary. Junior cornerback Heath Harding and fourth-year junior cornerback Marshall Taylor both now are most likely out for the season – Harding with back problems, Taylor with a foot injury. True freshman Allan Koikoi takes over for Taylor, while redshirt sophomore Bert Birdsall is expected to make just his sixth start at Harding’s spot. Three linebackers also done for the year, Martin said. \n“We’re very thin at linebacker,” he said. “We’re very thin in the secondary. It’s tough against anyone with good skill players.” \nOne way to stymie WMU’s big-play offense would seem to be possessing the ball, but that only works if possessions pay off in points. Miami held the ball against NIU for 39:45 – 15 seconds short of two-thirds of the clock – but the RedHawks managed to get just one touchdown and one field goal out of all that work. One possible scoring threat was wasted when true freshman quarterback Billy Bahl was picked off in the Huskies’ end zone. \nThat was Bahl’s only turnover of the game, a vast improvement over his four-interception effort in his first career start the previous week at Ohio. \n“Billy did a nice job managing the game,” Martin said. “He played much better. The offensive line blocked better. The tight ends blocked better. The backs ran better.” More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:56:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:10:04.524+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
