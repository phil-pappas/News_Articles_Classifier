(Marla Brose/Albuquerque Journal)\nCopyright © 2015 Albuquerque Journal\nThere were no little green men, tinfoil hats or stories of abductions and probes – which is what organizers wanted.\nThe Mutual UFO Network New Mexico hosted a conference on UFOs at Cleveland High School in Rio Rancho on Saturday, where guest speakers tried to tackle the question: “What does the government really know?” about unidentified flying objects.\nLearn more\nVisit newmexicoufos.com (Mutual UFO Network New Mexico) or mufon.com (Mutual UFO Network) for more about the groups. Paul Garver, the assistant state director of MUFON New Mexico, said the goal was to have serious, intelligent conversations about the phenomenon of spotting objects in the sky that can’t be explained.\nHe said UFO believers understand that much of the general public doesn’t understand why people research such things.\n“People associate all kinds of stereotypes on the subject,” Garver said. “We’re trying to consistently stay on message: This is a documented, real phenomenon, and it deserves investigation and research.”\nThat means, no, UFO researchers at the conference didn’t agree that aliens travel from other galaxies to visit earthlings and do experiments on people. But they do say there have been too many objects seen in the sky that can’t be explained.\nThis was the second year the conference was held in Rio Rancho and copies of Mayor Gregg Hull’s proclamation declaring Saturday “UFO Research Day” were being passed out.\nIt was officially “UFO Research Day” in Rio Rancho on Saturday. Mayor Gregg Hull signed the proclamation because of the conference, but wouldn’t say if he believes in aliens. (Marla Brose/Albuquerque Journal)\nWhile Hull did issue the proclamation at the group’s request, he declined to do an interview on the topic and said through a spokeswoman that he wouldn’t be attending the conference.\nAsked if he believes in aliens, Hull issued a prepared statement that said he liked “Star Trek” and “Star Wars,” but didn’t answer the question.\nThat’s not a surprise to those who have spent years researching UFOs.\n“The reputational damage. The giggle factor, whatever you want to call it, and it’s the same for politicians … (believing in UFOs) is the absolute kiss of death,” said Nick Pope, one of the speakers at the one-day event. “Very few scientists want to approach this.”\nPope said he spent years researching UFOs in Great Britain for the Ministry of Defense, and now writes and speaks on the topic. Pope, like many at the conference, said it’s a shame such stigma surrounds UFO research because it has the possibility to answer one of the most fascinating questions that humans can’t answer: Are we alone?\n“Is life out there? Definitely. Life visiting us? Maybe. But it’s such an important question because of its societal impact and it’s such an interesting question,” Pope said. “And this is a question we might well get an answer to. And soon.”\nTy Simpson, second from right, a paranormal researcher, listens to a man who said that he has seen a UFO during the Mutual UFO Network (MUFON) New Mexico Conference at Cleveland High School, Saturday in Rio Rancho. (Marla Brose/Albuquerque Journal)\nAbout 100 people attended the conference. In an exhibit space outside a lecture hall, some people propped up articles from newspapers throughout the state that date back to the 1950s and describe UFOs sightings in New Mexico.\n“Some people fill in the blanks with their own beliefs, wishes, desires and we want to fill it in with scientifically sound data,” Garver said. “People who say ‘UFOs aren’t real,’ they don’t know what they are talking about.”\nJohn Alexander, a UFO researcher and one of the conference’s speakers, said about 95 percent of objects that start as UFOs are eventually explained. But that leaves many questions unanswered.\n“You end up with a small percentage that defy logic and many defy physics. And people who see them are not crazy,” Alexander said. “Our agenda is: We need to make it permissible for senior scientists to study this without risking their reputation or livelihood.”", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/b01_jd_18oct_ufo3-400x263.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/b01_jd_18oct_ufo2-400x254.jpg", "http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/b01_jd_18oct_ufo1-640x430.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:32:34.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
