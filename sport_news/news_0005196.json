Trailing 12-10 heading into the fourth quarter Friday , the Panthers erupted for 23 points to turn a nail biter into a 33-12 win over host Monroe City. Palmyra (7-2) heads into next week's District 6 Tournament with some positive momentum following two defeats in which it totaled seven points. Running back Clayton Hudson led the way for the Panthers in both teams' regular-season finale totaling 155 yards on 30 carries with two touchdowns. Both of Hudson's scores came in the decisive fourth quarter, where he used a 1-run touchdown burst to give the Panthers the lead for good at 16-12 before capping the scoring with an 8-yard run. Noah Mencer added a 30-yard field goal and Philip Bland chipped in an 8-yard touchdown run in between. Bland contributed 109 yards on 15 touches. Monroe City led 12-3 at the half on a pair of touchdown runs. Mencer's 28-yard field goal accounted for Palmyra's only points of the first half. PHS senior quarterback Ben Cheffey was the first to cross the goal line for the Panthers when he broke away for a 20-yard score at the 9:08 mark of the third quarter. On offense, Palmyra out-gained Monroe City 321-223. Rushing game powers finish to Mark Twain's 9-0 regular season: The Mark Twain High School football team churned out 512 rushing yards, and Montgomery County had no answer as the visiting Tigers routed the Wildcats 72-12 on Friday to complete a 9-0 regular season. The win also pushed Mark Twain to a 7-0 mark in the Eastern Missouri Conference. Senior running back Tyler Elledge had a team-leading 178 yards on just seven carries with a touchdown, and junior Terry Monroe added 108 yards on 11 carries with three scores. Junior Caleb Hirner picked up 72 yards on four carries with a pair of touchdowns, and Loren Carlisle, Walker Sharp, AJ Wood and Conner Grossman all found the end zone in the blowout. Mark Twain led 52-0 in the first half before Montgomery County (2-7) found pay dirt on a 22-yard pass.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:46:58.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
