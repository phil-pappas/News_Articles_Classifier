FREEPORT — The Pretzels stopped Guilford’s running game cold. Then Jefferson’s. Then East’s. Three straight dominant defensive performances against the run, three straight wins. Now comes a new test against the NIC-10’s top passing team when Boylan (0-5) plays Freeport (3-2) Friday at the Pretzel Bowl. The Pretzels say bring it. “The last three weeks, Jefferson, East and Guilford were all going to run a lot more than they passed,” Freeport coach Aaron Wichman said. “So was Hononegah in Week 1. Harlem threw more, so we do have experience against one team like that, but most of our experience has been against running teams. “Our front six — even our front eight — have done a great job the last few weeks stopping the run. To be an elite unit, it has to be all 11 guys. If we get tested more by the pass, different guys will have to do different things, depending on what kind of offenses we see. “This is a good opportunity for us to see how our secondary fares against a team that throws the ball and does a good job with it. You always want to be a complete unit. You have to do well against teams that throw it, just as we have done against teams that run the ball.” While Harlem, the No. 2 passing team in the conference, tested Freeport’s secondary, Boylan will do so even more. The Titans have thrown 50 percent more than any other team in the league with 126 passes opposed to Harlem’s 85. Zach Couper is 60 of 126 for 714 yards, 183 more than No. 2 passer Austin Revolinski of Belvidere. And while this isn’t the same Boylan team that has beaten Freeport by an average of 40 points for 10 years in a row, the Titans are like no other 0-5 team in NIC-10 history. They have lost five consecutive close games to winning teams, including by four points to unbeaten Harlem, by one to once-beaten Hononegah and by one to Belvidere (3-2). The Titans have been particularly good on defense, holding their last three foes to 15, 19 and 14 points. “They’ll be real good on both sides of the ball, doing things they have done to us the last few years,” Wichman said. “You can throw their record out; they’ve got good high school football players, like they always do.” Freeport has good players too. The Pretzels are two wins away from making the playoffs for the first time in seven years. “These seniors, that’s been their goal since the beginning of the year,” Wichman said. “They’ve done a lot of things to put themselves in this position. If we get one more win, that gets us one step closer. They are determined.” Page 2 of 2 - Matt Trowbridge: 815-987-1383; mtrowbridge@rrstar.com ; @matttrowbridge GAME CAPSULE", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T17:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:33:44.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
