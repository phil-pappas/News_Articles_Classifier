The Chargers answered in the second quarterback Shawn O’Connor found Marlon Hart for a 30 yard touchdown pass in the second quarter.\nThe game entered halftime tied at 7, but momentum continued to swing from one team to the other. Keyport’s Desmond Underwood punched in a one yard TD run at the start of the fourth quarter to give the Red Raiders a 21-14 lead.\nSpotswood head coach Andy Cammarano and crew answered on just two rushing plays to tie the game at 21. A counter play from running back Jack Keenan tied the game in the fourth quarter.\n“Sometimes you have to get punched in the face a little to start punching back,” Cammarano said. “They are a big and physical team, they hit us and we started to hit back.”\nAlthough Spotswood had trouble running the ball in the first half, it opened things up for O’Connor through the air.\n“I just told the kids you threw the ball to get the game even, and you ran it to put the game away,” Cammarano said. “At some point you have to grind it out, because you can’t throw bombs to try and put the clock away.”\nRunning backs Joe Hayford and Jack Keenan were able to do just that for the Chargers. Spotswood was able to pin the Raiders deep on their own side of the field late in the fourth quarter, and sealed the game with one final interception.\n“We throw so many passes at our kids on defense, not only being in position, but catching it and running after,” Cammarano said. “We checked to a different defense on that last drive, we doubled the inside route, they were killing us on them all day, but we got it done on that last play.”\nCammarano hopes the win against a tough Keyport team helps his team moving forward.\n\"It's huge,\" Cammarano said. \"We beat a team with wins, it's not a fluke, I always tell the kids you can't relate one week to the next you have to just come out and play.\"\nKeyport's QB Chris Hogrefe finished with 123 yards and a TD through the air, along with a rushing touchdown.\nKey play: Spotswood’s Marlon Hart returned an interception for a touchdown in the fourth quarter to put the Chargers up 28-21.\nOffensive game ball: Spotswood QB Shawn O’Connor managed the game well under center for the Chargers, picking up big plays through the air when needed.\nDefensive game ball: As a unit Spotswood stepped up in the fourth quarter, but the final interception by Nick Mohr secured the victory.\nUp Next: Spotswood will host Middlesex on Saturday 10/31 and Keyport", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:05:23.473+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
