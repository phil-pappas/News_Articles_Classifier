The meeting will focus on the latest state regulations for marijuana production, from pesticides and lab testing to water rights to land use.\nOfficials from state agencies that deal with regulated marijuana and representatives of the Oregon Water Resources Congress, the farm bureau and the nursery association will address the group.\nThe armory is located at 2310 17th Street in Salem. The suggested donation to help cover the cost of the event is $10.\nTwo sessions will be offered, one from 9 a.m. to noon and the other from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. Interested in attending?
