He will be inducted Jan. 15 during a ceremony at the Waco Convention Center. The 2016 class also includes Steve Castillo, who won more than 700 games at a pair of Corpus Christi schools — Moody and John Paul II; Jim Long, who led Brenham to the UIL Class 4A championships in 2010; and Julian Pressley, who led Odessa to three state-tournament berths in the 1950s and ’60s.\nBeginning in 1972, Alvarez coached for 26 years at Travis before leading Bowie’s teams for 16 seasons. His Travis teams reached the playoffs 19 times, and his teams at Bowie participated in the postseason 14 times.\nRicardo B. Brazziell Former Bowie baseball coach Rudy Alvarez, right, will join former Westwood coach Bart Bratcher, left, in the Texas High School Baseball Coaches Association’s Hall of Fame. In 2002, Bowie reached the Class 5A state-title game, losing to Fort Bend Elkins 11-4.\nA graduate of Travis, Alvarez was a shortstop who played alongside Rebels second baseman Ken Boswell, who went on to play for the 1969 New York Mets team that won the World Series.\nBowie’s teams posted a combined 100-10 record from 1999 to 2002 under Alvarez, who retired from coaching last year.\nAmong the coaches Alvarez will join in the THSBCA Hall of Fame are former Westwood coach Bart Bratcher, a 1995 inductee, and former Round Rock coach John Langerhans, a 2007 inductee.\nDonation aids paralyzed player: The Lake Travis football team and booster club has given a gift of $1,000 to the family of Jasiel Favors, the Stony Point sophomore who broke his neck and suffered paralysis during a junior varsity football game played Sept. 2 in Round Rock.\nOn Tuesday, the 16-year-old Favors was transferred from Seton Medical Center Williamson to Dell Children’s Medical Center to begin rehabilitation, his mother said. Debra Favors said her son is expected to remain at Dell Children’s Hospital for about eight weeks before he is able to return to home.\n“With that contribution, we expressed that the entire Lake Travis football community was praying for Jasiel and his family,” said Bob Brewer, president of the Lake Travis Booster Club.\nDebra Favor has said her son is paralyzed from the waist down.\nA little more than two weeks ago, Debra and Jasiel received a visit from Eddie Canales and his son Chris, who helped organize the Gridiron Heroes Spinal Cord Injury Foundation in 2003. The nonprofit organization provides immediate and long-term support to high school football players who sustain catastrophic spinal cord injuries playing the sport.\nFourteen years ago, Chris Canales suffered a spinal cord injury while playing football as a senior defensive back for San Marcos Baptist Academy. His injury occurred in the fourth quarter of his final regular-season game, and it left him paralyzed from the shoulders down.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/01/7d/f4/RBB-prep-base-1.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:59:40.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
