Ever since then he's wanted to return to the mound.\nOn Sunday, the final day of his 15th Major League season, Ichiro got his wish. With his Miami Marlins trailing the Philadelphia Phillies, 6-2, going into the bottom of the eighth, the 41-year-old got to pitch an inning of relief.\nMarlins Manager Dan Jennings had been talking to Ichiro about the possibility for about a month.\n\"The situation had to be right,” Jennings said. “And so his last at-bat, he's on deck and looks down at me and says, 'You thinking about it?' I said, 'Oh yeah, it's done, you're in, you got it.’ And you know what, he's earned that because of who he is and the player and the career that he's had.”\nTurns out the 10-time Gold Glove-winning outfielder and two-time American League batting champ isn't a bad pitcher either. He gave up one run on two hits with a ground out and two fly outs.\n“I thought my fastball was going to be my best pitch, but it was my slider,” Ichiro said through an interpreter. “I was shocked that my fastball wasn't my best pitch.”\nHe added with a laugh: “I can't say it was fun, but I'll never talk bad about a pitcher again.”\n Major League Baseball Ichiro Suzuki Dan Jennings Miami Marlins Philadelphia Phillies Gold Glove Awards", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612a264/turbine/la-sp-sn-ichiro-suzuki-pitches-20151005"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:46:23.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
