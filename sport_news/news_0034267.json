It's proof that high-level success at a second-division level still has its rewards. The Dukes seem to be pining for the FBS, but some in the ODU camp would caution: Be careful what you wish for. Bottom line: There's a decent chance this offseason that some team will pay upcoming free agent Daniel Murphy like a Mr. October who has home runs in six consecutive playoff games - not like an average 30-year-old second baseman who finished with 14 homers in 130 regular-season games. It may not be the Mets, though. Other than likely making him a one-year, $15.8 million qualifying offer, the Mets reportedly aren't eager to bring back Murphy. We'll see whether management's attitude shifts if he's at the head of a ticker-tape parade.\nArrival: The trip to the World Series is even sweeter for Mets third baseman David Wright after he missed more than three months of the season rehabbing his back in Florida. \"It's been a long road for me personally,\" he said after the Amazins closed out the Cubs. \"Every day in rehab, I dreamt about this moment.\"\nFuturewatch: Traumatized Cubs fans can take comfort in believing that with so much young talent on the roster, their team's championship prospects should be even better next season. Of course, that's what everybody said about the Washington Nationals two years ago.\nLocal ties: For Norfolk State fans who may have lost track of him, Kyle O'Quinn will be coming off the bench for the New York Knicks this season after signing a four-year, $16 million contract over the summer. He spent his first three seasons with the Orlando Magic. Knicks coach Derek Fisher said part of what attracted him to O'Quinn is his affability. \"He does have a presence,\" Fisher said. \"He has some leadership qualities that are good for us.\"\nRumor mill: Who to believe? When Percy Harvin failed to accompany the Buffalo Bills to London this week, it sparked reports that he has told friends he's considering retirement because of a persistent hip injury. His agent immediately (and naturally) denied that. In any case, Harvin is sidelined indefinitely, which is nothing new for the 27-year-old receiver, who hasn't played a full 16-game schedule since he was in Minnesota in 2011.\nSales job: Next to \"Modern Family,\" my favorite thing on TV is the commercial featuring a droll Troy Aikman buying beer at a convenience store. Don't most of us live in the past?\nIdle thought: I admire the Kansas City Royals for their toughness and resiliency, but just can't warm up to them. Neither can most of America, I suspect.\nHair today: What's the best guess concerning the stuff on Pete Rose's head. Rug? Or spray paint?\nHo-hum: What I found mildly educational about the run-of-the-mill roadside incident involving Johnny Manziel, his girlfriend and the police was how relatively little overreaction and fake outrage the story generated among media and social media - an indication that as a football player and party boy, Manziel just doesn't matter much anymore. A good thing, most likely.\nCatch-22: Rick Pitino is trying to survive what would be a lose-lose proposition for most any other coach. Even if you take him at his word that he wasn't aware of the Louisville recruiting parties that reportedly featured strippers and prostitutes, is there any plausible excuse for why the head coach shouldn't have known? I wouldn't bet against Slick Rick hanging onto his job, though. This is college basketball in Kentucky, after all.\nNumbers game: A really devoted Tiger Woods fan can keep as accurate a count of his surgeries as his major titles.\nRumblings: After Mack Brown went on a Baltimore talk show this week and spoke glowingly of the potential of Maryland's moribund football program, rumors sprang up that the former North Carolina and Texas coach was lobbying for the coaching job left vacant with the firing of Randy Edsall. An out-of-work coach with an itch to get back in the game isn't the rarest of species, but Brown's age (64) likely trumps his resume.\nIn passing: Why do I think that, when the dust settles, Alabama will be the winner of the college football playoffs? Probably because Nick Saban is still the coach.\nHoops du jour: In exhibition games, Oklahoma City star Kevin Durant is moving well, apparently free of lingering effects from last season's foot injury. Still, it's a long season, and if history is our guide, big men with foot troubles are never completely out of the woods.\nThird and long: The critics who leveled both barrels at Kirk Cousins after the loss to the Jets chose to overlook a few things, such as the Jets gaining 7.1 yards per play on Washington's defense and the half-dozen injured Redskins starters. Oh, and DeSean Jackson, the team's only long-ball threat, was out again. Cousins clearly is not the answer, but a lazy way of analyzing a team is to target the quarterback when the operation as a whole stinks from the head down. That said, if Jay Gruden loses at home to Tampa Bay on Sunday, all hell breaks loose.\nBob Molinaro is a former Virginian-Pilot sports columnist. His Weekly Briefing will run Fridays in The Pilot.
