That's the central issue in a case before the South Dakota Supreme Court. \nDavid Zerfas lost control of his car on Interstate 29 in December, 2011. Zerfas swerved to avoid a deer carcass in his lane, lost control, was hit by oncoming traffic and later died. His wife is asking for insurance benefits from AMCO because she says an unidentified and therefore uninsured motorist hit the deer and left it on the road. \n\"What do you do when your tire goes flat and you don't know how to change it? You still have a duty as a motorist to act reasonably and safely. If your tire blew apart, you have a duty to make sure that piece of rubber that's now in the roadway isn't going to cause a collision,\" Zerfas' attorney Seamus Culhane said. \nLawyers for AMCO insurance say there's no requirement in South Dakota or any other state that a driver has to remove road kill. \n\"Neither South Dakota statute or any common law we've been able to locate creates a duty on behalf of a driver who strikes and either injures or kills wild animals to stop, search and drag the animal from the roadway,\" AMCO attorney Kent Cutler said. \nCutler told the court that if they decide in favor of Zerfas, drivers would be forced to deal with road kill both large and small. \n\"Does it not create significantly more danger for the motoring public to require them to stop, locate and wrestle with dead and injured wildlife?\" Cutler asked. \"The alternative is to say you don't ever have to do anything. You hit a deer; you don't have to do anything.\" \nThe Supreme Court is back in session Tuesday morning at 9 a.m. at the USD law school in Vermillion. The public is welcome to listen in on any of the cases. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
