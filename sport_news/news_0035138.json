I know it's difficult, but we have to try. \n\"We said at the end there, we've got a play-off and if you looked at the group overall back at the start of the campaign, would you have accepted third spot at the time? \n\"People would probably have said 'yeah'. \n\"When you're in with a chance and you think you can take second spot, then of course it's a disappointment. \n\"But I think that we have to try to move on as quickly as possible and try to make sure that the lads going back to their clubs, they'll be fully focused on that, but that they have it in the backs of their minds that we have big games in a month's time and we still have the chance to go to the European Championship in France. \n\"There's still something in it.\" \nThe defeat in Poland was just Ireland's second of the campaign, and the goals they conceded only the sixth and seventh in 10 games. \nThey will, however, go into the play-off first leg without central defender John O'Shea, who was sent off for a second bookable offence for a stoppage-time foul on Lewandowski, and striker Jonathan Walters, who collected his third caution of the group phase for a late challenge on the same man. \nWalters had earlier given the visitors hope of a positive result - a 2-2 draw at the Narodowy Stadium would have put them through - by converting a 16th-minute penalty after Grzegorz Krychowiak had opened the scoring, but Lewandowski won it with a powerful header three minutes before the break. \nThe Republic are likely to face Ukraine, Croatia, Bosnia, Sweden or Denmark over two legs next month, but having improved their play-off record with a 5-1 aggregate victory over Estonia four years ago, they will hope to repeat the feat this time around. \nKeane, 35, said: \"Look, we've been successful in the play-offs. \n\"Having that hunger and desire, knowing that there's a massive prize at the end of it, playing at the European Championships - some players never get get the opportunity to play in these competitions. \n\"We've been lucky enough that we have quite a few who know what it's like, the atmosphere that gets created around it for everybody. \n\"To have a European Championship on your CV, that's an opportunity the lads certainly have to be mindful of. \n\"We all have to go on thinking we have a great chance regardless of who we get because we're a good team.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:00:58.789+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
