His influence will also be pivotal against a strong New Zealand line-out.\" \nScrumhalf Fourie du Preez will carry on as captain, with young flyhalf Handre Pollard and inexperienced centres Damian de Allende and Jesse Kriel outside him. \nBryan Habana and JP Pietersen continue on the wings, while fullback Willie le Roux, who had a poor game in the 23-19 quarter-final victory over Wales, retains his place. \nSouth Africa needed a late try from Du Preez to beat Wales in the quarters and now face an All Blacks side who have beaten the Boks in 10 of their last 12 meetings. \nSince winning the 2011 World Cup New Zealand have lost only three of their 52 games - including one against the Springboks at Ellis Park in 2014. \nTeam: \n1: Tendai Mtawarira, 2: Bismarck du Plessis, 3: Frans Malherbe, 4: Eben Etzebeth, 5: Lood de Jager, 6: Francois Louw, 7: Schalk Burger, 8: Duane Vermeulen, 9: Fourie du Preez (captain), 10: Handre Pollard, 11: Bryan Habana, 12: Damian de Allende, 13: Jesse Kriel, 14: JP Pietersen, 15: Willie le Roux \nReplacements: 16: Adriaan Strauss, 17: Trevor Nyakane, 18: Jannie du Plessis, 19: Vicor Matfield, 20: Willem Alberts, 21: Ruan Pienaar, 22: Pat Lambie, 23: Jan Serfontein Promoted Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T19:27:35.632+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
