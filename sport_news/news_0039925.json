(AP) - Chris Harris Jr. returned a fourth-quarter interception 74 yards for a touchdown and the Denver Broncos overcame a shaky day from Peyton Manning to beat the Oakland Raiders 16-10 on Sunday.\nManning was intercepted twice by 1998 draft classmate Charles Woodson and failed to lead the Broncos (5-0) to an offensive touchdown for the second time in five games this season. But Denver's defense made sure it didn't matter, getting a third defensive touchdown of the season to remain undefeated.\nDerek Carr threw for 249 yards and one touchdown for the Raiders (2-3) but was done in by the interception midway through the fourth quarter with Oakland in position for a possible go-ahead field goal.\n___\nOnline:\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
