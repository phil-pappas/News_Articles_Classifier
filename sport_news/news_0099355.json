That’s thanks to a growth spurt into his junior year that has him 4 inches taller and 25 pounds heavier.\n“I hit the weight room. But also my dad is 6-1 and my grandpa is 6-4,’’ said the 6-foot-2 Pickett after throwing three touchdown passes in the Spartans’ 40-14 victory over Long Branch Friday night in a Shore Conference Class B North game.\nPickett completed 10 of 12 passes for 205 yards. When Long Branch tied the game 14-14 in the second quarter, Pickett answered by connecting with tailback Tyler Thompson on a 54-yard screen pass for a touchdown on the very next play from scrimmage, one of three times Thompson made it to the end zone. The Spartans dominated from that point.\n“I think they got used to us running on first down and the screen pass caught them in a blitz,’’ Pickett said. “They were all coming up on me and I just dumped the ball to Tyler.’’\nThompson rushed for a game-high 137 yards. The only blemish this season for Ocean (5-1, 3-1) is a loss to another division rival, undefeated Red Bank.\n“B North in my opinion is the best division in the Shore Conference,’’ Ocean coach Don Klein said. “Every week you know you’re going to be in for a battle. There is a lot of balance, a lot of great coaches, and a lot of great football players.’’\nThat batch of top players, Klein said, includes Pickett, who was listed at 5-foot-10 and 163 pounds as a sophomore.\n“Kenny had a terrific off season. He’s matured a bunch physically. There isn’t another quarterback in the Shore Conference that I’d rather have. He’s cerebral. He’s got tremendous talent and can hurt you a lot of ways including with his feet,’’ Klein said.\nOcean had to play catch up after Long Branch (2-4, 1-3) scored on its first possession of the game, with Keith Cooper scoring on a 48-yard run, the first of his two long touchdown runs.\nCooper also scored on a 40-yard run with 8:29 left in the second quarter, capping an evenly played stretch of the game and putting the score at 14-14. Cooper rushed for 124 yards.\nThen it was all Ocean. The Pickett-Thompson screen pass broke the tie and was the first of four consecutive touchdowns against the Green Wave.\nBy halftime, Ocean was in the clear with a 27-14 lead but offense remained robust in the third quarter and created two more touchdowns. First it was Pickett’s well-placed 25-yard pass to an in-stride Ruquan Dean in the end zone to make the score 33-14, and before the quarter ended Thompson made it to the end for his third score on a 40-yard run.\nOcean’s earlier touchdowns came on a 16-yard Pickett pass to Joey Aldarelli tying the score at 7-7 with three minutes left in the first quarter and on a 50-yard Pick 6 touchdown by Tyler Rossback , who intercepted a deflected pass.\nGreyson Stoothoff led Ocean’s receivers with 4 catches for 67 yards.\nKey play: Kenny Pickett’s screen pass to Tyler Thompson in the second quarter went for a 53-yard touchdown. It broke a 14-14 tie and Ocean never looked back.\nOffensive game ball : Pickett rushed for 31 yards to go with his 205 passing yards, completing 10 of 12 throws.\nDefensive game bal l: Tyler Rossback turned a pass batted high in the air into a 50-yard Pick 6.\nUp next: Long Branch hosts Matawan next Friday. Ocean has a bye week then visits Red Bank Catholic Oct. 30.", "external_links": ["http://www.hudl.com/athlete/4263266/keith-cooper", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/5141785/tyler-rossback", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/4675205/kenny-pickett", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/2002665/tyler-thompson", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/6275122/ruquan-dean", "http://www.hudl.com/athlete/5095894/greyson-stoothoff"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:07:47.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
