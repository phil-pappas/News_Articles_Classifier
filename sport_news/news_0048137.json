(AFP) \nSania Mirza and Martina Hingis continued their incredible unbeaten run to claim their eighth trophy of the season and fourth in a row with a nail-biting win over the Chan sisters at the WTA China Open in Beijing on Saturday. The top seeds overcame stiff resistance from sixth seed Taipei girls Hao-Ching Chan and Yung-Jan Chan before winning 6-7 (9), 6-1, 10-8 in the final which lasted one hour and 40 minutes. It was fourth title in a row for the Indo-Swiss pair.\"I think the first set, we were probably a bit unlucky not to win,\" Mirza said after the match. \"We got a pretty terrible call at that break point to go up 3-2, then after that we probably should have won that tie-break because we were up the whole time. All credit to them, though, they came up and made us hit one extra ball. They probably played us the best out of the last five or six times we've played them.\"It was a tough tie-break to lose. We could have easily mentally lost it. But we just tried to get ourselves together again. We wanted to keep it together, and really use our experience to get it back.\"\"We stayed aggressive and tried to keep pushing and creating more opportunities, and all of a sudden things started happening,\" Hingis said. \"It took so much energy to be down all the time and have to come back, because we had so many break chances, chances to win the set, but we just tried to keep our level and stay on top of them. Once we were in the super tie-break, we were always winning.\" In a remarkable run, they have dropped only two sets in their last 17 matches in four tournaments. They're the first team to win eight WTA doubles titles together in a year since Sara Errani and Roberta Vinci won eight in 2012. The last team to win more was Cara Black and Liezel Huber's 10 in 2008.
