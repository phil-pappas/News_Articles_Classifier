Roy Hibbert was at center.\n“I think the more those guys can play together, the better,” Scott said. “I’m going to try that out this first week, see how it goes and then I’ll start mixing and matching a little bit more. It looked good.”\nThat it was the first unit Scott wanted to see could be telling. Among the questions expected to be answered in the weeks before the Oct. 28 season opener are whether Randle and Russell will be eased into big roles, or start right away.\nBryant at small forward was not so much a surprise as it was strange to see. Scott has frequently discussed giving Bryant time on the wing, which in theory could reduce the amount of strain required for him to get open shots.\n“I don’t have to handle the ball really at all,” Bryant said. “Gives me more time to catch and shoot.”\nHe said having Russell and Clarkson on the court makes his job simpler.\n“These guys can handle the ball and make incredible decisions and make plays,” he said. “Makes it a lot easier.”\nCould Bryant really ease into a role of floating around the perimeter, waiting for the action to come to him? In the twilight of his career, it might make sense.\nThe Lakers scrimmaged for about 25 minutes Tuesday, the last 10 of which were open to the media. In that time, Bryant didn’t touch the ball on offense.\nThat could have as much to do with the fact that Tuesday marked Bryant’s first five-on-five game since he underwent surgery for a torn rotator cuff as it does with his position on the floor.\n“You just play the flow of the game and just see what comes,” he said.\nScott said he likes that the lineup gives the Lakers four ball-handlers in Russell, Clarkson, Bryant and Randle – who is known to get the rebound and go.\n“Out of those four guys we want to see if we can get easy baskets as much as possible,” Scott said.\n1 2 3 Next Page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:06:05.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
