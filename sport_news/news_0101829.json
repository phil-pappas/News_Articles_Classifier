BILL ALKOFER, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » For the second time in three seasons, USC has fired its football coach after just five games.\nAthletic Director Pat Haden terminated Steve Sarkisian on Monday, one day after putting him on an indefinite leave of absence following a second incident possibly related to an alcohol problem.\nâAfter careful consideration of what is in the best interest of the university and our student-athletes, I have made the decision to terminate Steve Sarkisian, effective immediately,â Haden said in a statement.\nâThrough all of this, we remain concerned for Steve and hope that it will give him the opportunity to focus on his personal well being.â\nThe firing elicited reactions from Trojans past and present about the well being of Sarkisian and of a football program that canât seem to escape undesired drama.\nFormer USC quarterback Todd Marinovich, who has battled substance abuse, told HuffPost Live that he was in attendance at the Aug. 22 âSalute to Troyâ rally that proved to be the beginning of the end of Sarkisianâs tenure.\nâI spoke with Coach Sarkisian prior to him going on stage,â Marinovich said. âWith my history of abuse with substances, I knew he was intoxicated, and I wanted to protect him. I went to the people in charge and said, âWeâve got to stop this.â And as you know, I didnât have any success in doing so.\nâThis just screams to me that heâs in pain and needs help. Prior to his firing, I felt it was the universityâs position, or really their responsibility, to help the man. Now, him no longer being part of the university, itâs really his friends and family that need to rally around him.\nâHindsightâs 20/20. Maybe they should have stepped in after that August incident and addressed it then before anything else could occur. â¦ Addiction and alcoholism is a progressive illness. It doesnât get any better. It just steadily gets worse. I think weâre witnessing that.â\nSarkisian has entered a treatment facility, according to a source close to the ex-coach. After the Salute to Troy incident, Sarkisian said he would be seeking unspecified treatment to find out whether he had a drinking problem. He also vowed not to drink again during the season.\nHowever, Sarkisian appeared to be off during a team meeting Sunday morning, the squadâs first time back together since losing to Washington on Thursday. Sarkisian did not attend practice that afternoon as school officials, including Haden, scrambled to figure out what was happening and how to handle it.\nHaden said it was âvery clearâ after talking with Sarkisian on the phone that he was ânot healthy.â After Haden announced later Sunday that Sarkisian would go on leave, reports surfaced detailing heavy alcohol use during his time as the coach at UW. Sarkisian, who has three children, also is going through a divorce.\nSarkisianâs first stint at USC began as an assistant under Pete Carroll in 2001. Sarkisian was part of Carrollâs staff for most of the Trojansâ highly successful run from 2001-08. On Monday, Carroll expressed concern for his former aide.\nâI think this is an opportunity for Sark to get right and to get well,â the Seattle Seahawks coach told local reporters. âAnd Iâm pulling for him. Heâs up against some big challenges, and heâs got to go ahead and take care of it.\nâThis isnât about coaching now. This is about his personal life and getting things in order, and I know heâs committed to taking the right steps to do that.â\n1 2 Next Page Related: Miller: Steve Sarkisan saga raises questions about Pat Haden's competency", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw577p-b88538268z.120151012215716000gf1ci1n4.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw577p-b88538268z.120151012215716000g7tci2hq.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw577p-b88538268z.120151012215716000gf1ci1n4.10.jpg", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/haden-687290-sarkisian-usc.html", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw577p-b88538268z.120151012215716000g7tci2hq.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:11:53.896+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
