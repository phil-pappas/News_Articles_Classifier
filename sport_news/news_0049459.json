By JOSH HOFFNER Associated Press   2:52   2:52   \nPeople: \nArizona (629) \nPHOENIX â€” There comes a time in the fantasy football season where you just have to let go. \nNot let go in the sense of abandoning hope of winning a championship (that never ends), but moving on from mid-round (and sometimes high) draft picks that just aren't panning out. It's especially crucial as bye weeks deplete your lineup and you need to create room on your roster. \nSo in the spirit of moving on, this week's installment of fantasy plays is going to take a different tack from columns that offer a spate of roster add recommendations. We are going to offer up five players you should drop. \nLAMAR MILLER \nHe was a third-round pick in many leagues and a solid top-40 overall player in most preseason rankings. It was supposed to be a glorious year for Miller and the Dolphins after the team spent heavily in free agency in the offseason. The result through four games? The coach is gone and Miller has 131 yards and no touchdowns. It is possible that he gets on track as the season goes on, but it's looking like a long year and you would need to have serious problems with your lineup to justify a start for Miller. \nGOLDEN TATE \nTate had a career year in 2014 by eclipsing 1,300 yards. But that is looking like an aberration, and his stats this season are tracking more closely to his numbers in the rest of his career. He is on pace for a finish of about 800 yards. He also hasn't scored a touchdown yet and remember, he only scored four times last season during his breakout year. Definitely a candidate to drop. \nCHARLES JOHNSON \nThe Minnesota wideout came into the season with lofty expectations after a solid 2014 and earning rave reviews from offensive coordinator Norv Turner in the offseason. He has been nonexistent through four games, mostly the result of injury. He is expected to return after Minnesota's bye. \nJORDAN CAMERON \nWe've already established that the Dolphins are a mess, and Cameron is one of those players who haven't held up his end of the bargain for Miami. He has 170 yards and no touchdowns. Tight ends are a nice commodity during bye weeks and his numbers aren't horrible compared to his counterparts at the position. But it's going to be tough to give him a start. \n30-SOMETHING VETS \nRoddy White has not enjoyed in Atlanta's resurgence, with only 92 yards on the year. He is also apparently unhappy about his limited role. This is an explosive team, so there are opportunities for him to rebound. I had intended to include Andre Johnson after his poor start for Indy, but he turned around and delivered a great Thursday night performance for the Colts. The lesson: These moves can backfire but sometimes you have to make them. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:06:56.687+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
