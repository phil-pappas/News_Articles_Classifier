I can't be more proud of these guys behind me. I'm excited for this city, this organization, this fan base. We've all waited a long time for this and for it to finally come to fruition -- pretty special feeling.\" \nPLUS : World Series-bound Mets return to cheers at Citi Field \nHaving eliminated the Cubs with an 8-3 win on Wednesday night at Wrigley Field, the Mets will now get to rest for five days before meeting the winner of the Toronto Blue Jays-Kansas City Royals ALCS .

(Video by John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) \nWhile the Mets had to weather a tumultuous regular season to get to this point, they're now peaking at the right time. Behind their tremendous pitching depth and a breakout offensive performance from Daniel Murphy, the Mets dispatched the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games in the first round and then made quick work of the talented Cubs in the NLCS. \nWright said he thinks the Mets have the pieces to carry that momentum into the World Series. \n\"I think it starts with our starting pitching,\" Wright said. \"Our offense has been good, but when our starting pitching goes out there and sets the tone, it makes it easier for us offensively. We've proven this year that we can beat you a number of different ways with our starting pitching, our bullpen, our offense, so when we're clicking on all cylinders, we're going to be tough.\" \nMaria Guardado may be reached at mguardado@njadvancemedia.com .
