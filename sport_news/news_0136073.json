The atmosphere is electric. \nWith a buzz surrounding the community over Friday’s contest between undefeated Paint Valley and undefeated Zane Trace, both the Bearcats and Pioneers go into their Week 6 match-up with high hopes. \nHowever, after 48 minutes of play on Friday night, one team’s road to a Scioto Valley Conference title will take a significant detour. \nHere’s how we see each individual position group between the two and who has the edge in each category: \nQUARTERBACKS \nThere’s no question that both Paint Valley’s Anthony McFadden and Zane Trace’s Joel Dunkle have tremendous talents. However, McFadden had the game of his life last season against the Pioneers. In a 41-14 win, McFadden was perfect, completing 16-of-16 passes for 242 yards and three touchdowns. Coming into Friday’s contest, the senior quarterback has thrown for 575 yards — second in the area — and nine touchdowns while rushing for 399, including six scores. Dunkle is a tremendous signal caller. However, McFadden has the experience and the edge in this one. \nADVANTAGE: Paint Valley Buy Photo \nZane Trace’s Trey Rittenhouse runs the ball against Unioto, earlier this season.

(Photo: Gazette file photo) \nRUNNING BACKS \nIt’s extremely hard to give an edge to a team trying to contain Paint Valley’s Teagan McFadden and Caleb Johnson. But, the fact remains that Zane Trace’s success this season has a lot to do with the play of senior running backs Truman Love and Trey Rittenhouse. Love has carried the ball 48 times for 350 yards and six scores while Rittenhouse has gained 233 yards on 33 carries — a 7.1 yards per touch average. To go along with those numbers, the two have completely different running styles with Love packing a punch and Rittenhouse using his speed to elude defenders. Yes, Teagan McFadden is absolutely magnificent out of the backfield but the Pioneers have not one, but two great ball carriers. \nADVANTAGE: Zane Trace \nRECEIVERS \nWith one superstar at the wide receiver position on each team — Paint Valley’s Tony Hatfield and Zane Trace’s Pierce Mowery — role players and second options in the passing game will have a huge impact on this contest. That means that Austen Blevins and Caleb Johnson will play pivotal roles in this contest. When you combine those two with Hatfield and McFadden’s pinpoint accuracy, you get success. Look for Paint Valley to excel through the air, even when the spotlight isn’t on Hatfield. \nADVANTAGE: Paint Valley \nOFFENSIVE LINE \nZane Trace is known as a big, physical team and rightfully so. It will be very interesting to find out how Paint Valley handles themselves in that type of environment. However, the Bearcats have been in this position before when facing teams such as Shadyside (2014 playoff contest), Minford and Williamsburg. Nevertheless, at least on paper, one has to think the Pioneers will handle business up front. \nADVANTAGE: Zane Trace \nDEFENSIVE LINE \nHere are two names to watch on both sides in the trenches: Paint Valley’s Dalton Waugh and Zane Trace’s Matt Carroll. Both are constantly wreaking havoc in the opponent’s backfield and both should be a focal point in each team’s game plans. Much like on the offensive side, the Pioneers do have the edge when it comes to size. But defense breeds a different type of weapon; speed, and the Bearcats have that. With Waugh, tackles Drake Stanforth and Josh Krech, Paint Valley will used finesse against power in, probably, the most important match-up of the entire ordeal. \nADVANTAGE: Paint Valley \nLINEBACKERS \nAlong with Love, seniors Trey Davis and Korey Ramsey make up what’s probably the best linebacking core in the entire league. There’s no doubt that the Pioneers will use those three athletes to try and slow down McFadden and Johnson in the backfield. They’ve had success all year in stopping the run and will look to continue that trend, Friday night. On the flip side of things, the Bearcats’ linebackers aren’t so bad themselves. With Buster Trent, Tyger Tesi and Skyler Knisley, they also will try and corral two great running backs. \nADVANTAGE: Zane Trace \nSECONDARY \nHatfield and Blevins have both been mentioned but they’re also a huge part of the Paint Valley’ secondary as well as Anthony McFadden. All three of those names are players who have guarded big time receivers in the past and they’ll get a chance to do so against Zane Trace’s Mowery, Erick Wrestler and tight end Timothy Gibson this week. With McFadden in center field and Hatfield and Blevins on the edges, it’s hard to beat that lineup, although Zane Trace’s Alex Wolff should also be thrown into this conversation as well. \nADVANTAGE: Paint Valley \nSo there you have it. On paper, it’s a very even match-up and as long as both teams play their own style of football, it should stay that way. If you’re planning to attend the game, kickoff is set for 7:30 p.m. at Zane Trace High School, this Friday night. Get there early. There won’t be many open seats. \ndwebb@chillicothegazette.com BY THE NUMBERS: Paint Valley at Zane Trace Paint Valley (5-0, 2-0) \n•2015 Opponents’ Combined Records: 11-14 \n•AP Rank: #5, Division IV \n•OHSAA Computer Rank: #2, Region 21 \n•Scioto Valley Conference titles: 11 \n•Golden Footballs: 8", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T15:22:18.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
