That’s what the Patriots did to him. There is no other explanation given what he tried to pull last night in the name of beating his AFC rivals.\nDown by only six points in the third quarter, Pagano went into theater-of-the-absurd mode. Thinking his Colts had to score almost every possession to keep up, to have a chance to slay the dragon, he pulled one of the dumbest stunts you’ll ever see.\nThe Colts were faced with fourth-and-3 from their own 37. Everyone in America would have punted. Not Pagano. He tried a crazy formation with a fake punt attached.\nHe lined almost everyone up on the right side, two players separated in the middle of the field: Wide receiver Griff Whalen lined up as a center, and safety Colt Anderson as the quarterback under center.\nReally?\nObviously it didn’t work, but there were so many things wrong. It was an illegal formation for starters. Second, if he was trying to draw the Patriots offside with this wacky surprise, why snap the ball when it didn’t work? Why didn’t he just call a timeout when it all looked like a train wreck?\nThere was no surprise. The Pats had at least five players swarmed over the center, and Brandon Bolden dumped Anderson on his keister for a 1-yard loss after Whalen snapped the ball.\nPagano ultimately took the blame for the fake punt, saying it was a “communication breakdown.”\n“That’s all on me. I take full responsibility. I didn’t do a good enough job coaching it during the week,” said Pagano, who claimed the play was practiced but not executed particularly well. “Obviously, it played a huge factor in the loss, giving them field position at that point in the game and the touchdown that resulted from it.”\nSome people will point to Bill Belichick going for it on fourth-and-2 against the Colts from his own 28 with a six-point lead. Not even close on the stupidity scale. Belichick’s defense couldn’t make a stop that night, and getting the first down would have sealed the win.\nPagano’s excuse?\nThere is no logical explanation except the Patriots are in his head. After getting blown out in his only other six tries as the head coach of the Colts, Pagano wanted to beat them so badly he made a colossal mistake.\nIt was brave and bold to attempt an onside kick in the first half. The Colts should have recovered, only the referees couldn’t overturn their initial call. That was a smart and aggressive play.\nGoing for it on fourth-and-1 from the Patriots 5-yard-line on their opening drive in the first quarter? Also bold and aggressive, and another good move in an attempt to beat the Patriots.\nThe fake punt? Sheer lunacy.\nThe Pats took possession on the 35, and LeGarrette Blount converted that into a touchdown in six plays. It proved the winning score in a 34-27 game.\n“We were going to be aggressive. We were going to attack this football team,” said Pagano, who didn’t appear postgame until at least 15 minutes after Andrew Luck. “Credit them. They played well. They out-executed us.”\nLogan Ryan was in the posse that was on top of Whalen and Anderson on the botched fake punt. He wasn’t duped, but a bit dumbfounded at what the Colts were attempting.\n“In all my years, I’ve never seen that play before,” Ryan said. “I think there was a lot of confusion out there, honestly. I don’t know what the goal of that play was, but I’m happy that we were able to defend it.”\nYes, the Colts tried to be creative. Yes, you have to go the extra mile to try to beat the Patriots.\nThis was not the way.\n“They out-executed us,” Luck said. “We missed some opportunities. They force you to miss opportunities.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T11:27:48.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
