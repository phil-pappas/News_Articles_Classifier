(lehighvalleylive.com file photo) By Greg Joyce | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 19, 2015 6:45 PM \nThe 1-6 record and six straight losing seasons at Lafayette College doesn't scare away Julian Spigner . \nIn his freshman year at Bethlehem Catholic in 2012, the team went 1-9. \nSince then, in part thanks to Spigner taking over as the starting quarterback in his sophomore year, the Golden Hawks have gone 26-8 with two straight district championships. \nThat’s why when Spigner gave a verbal commitment to Lafayette Sunday , he did so with a determination to help the Leopards get back to winning ways in his time on College Hill. \n“Here at Beca, my freshman year we were 1-9 so it’s kind of the same scenario,” Spigner said Monday. “I’m definitely excited to get down there and try to turn things around.” \nRELATED : Who is the best quarterback in the Lehigh Valley? (VOTE) \nSpigner made the final decision Sunday before his Golden Hawks (6-1) began preparing for Friday’s game against Stroudsburg, which should decide the EPC North champion. \n“It’s definitely a good feeling,” he said. “I feel as if a lot of weight’s lifted off my shoulders. I don’t have to worry about anything anymore, I can just play.” \nThrough seven games, Spigner is 75 on 122 passing for 1,012 yards, eight touchdowns and no interceptions while adding 62 carries for 356 yards and seven touchdowns. \n“I know it was a stressful situation for a long time with Julian and I’m sure he’s relieved and I’m thankful for that and of course very proud of him,” Becahi coach Joe Henrich said. “Julian has been a three-year starter for us and he’s a great kid and he works hard. You’re always happy for your kids to be able to get the opportunity to move on and continue to try to improve their craft.” \nThe Leopards recruited the 6-foot-3, 195-pound Spigner as an athlete, meaning he’ll get a shot to play quarterback when he gets there and if it doesn’t work out, he could move to wide receiver. \n“I’m fine with either, as long as I can make plays and benefit the team,” said Spigner, who hasn’t played wide receiver since Pee Wee football. \nAnother local quarterback, and fellow Easton native, Tre Jordan joins Spigner in Lafayette’s recruiting class . Jordan will also enter as an athlete, though the two could eventually be battling it out for the quarterback spot. \n“It’s definitely going to be cool to know another local guy from Easton,” Spigner said. \nAs for the timing of the decision, Spigner said he wanted to finalize the recruiting process and turn his full attention to the rest of the high school football season. \n“Honestly, I just wanted to be focused on now and already have a decision for next year,” he said. “That’s the best place for me as far as academics and athletics go.” \nSpigner is looking to study business at the school where both of his parents played basketball. \n“It’s kind of within the family tradition,” he said. \nSpigner earned all-state honors as a junior and for his career is 323-for-560 passing for 4,838 yards and 54 touchdowns in addition to 314 rushes for 1,548 yards and 14 touchdowns. \nBut he brings an equally important impact on the mental side of the game. \n“Julian’s a pretty even-keeled kid,” Henrich said. “He never gets too high, never gets too low, and I think that’s really important from a quarterback position to reflect on his teammates.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:55:59.925+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
