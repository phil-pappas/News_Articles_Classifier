Exhorting farm scientists to conduct intense research to promote traditional farming, he urged them to come out with new techniques and information to update farmers for improving their skills and methods. He said there was need to develop indigenous seeds which were disease-resistant and urged the agriculture, horticulture and animal husbandry departments to take the knowledge to the fields and farmers and concentrate more on monitoring the field activities. He said the use of natural pesticides should be encouraged and the farmers should be made aware regarding their usage as pesticides being used were not only harmful for consumers but was also destroying the fertility of soil. He said farmers should adopt cycle of crops which was part of traditional farming.
