Germany, FIFA's bid inspectors concluded, \"demonstrated a true spirit of fair play.\" By contrast, rival bidder England's \"behavior was not always in compliance with the FIFA recommendations.\" \nFifteen years after American official Alan Rothenberg delivered his report, FIFA has promised a fresh investigation by lawyers into \"very serious allegations\" that Germany secured hosting rights to the soccer showpiece by bribing voters. \nThe central claim made by German news magazine Der Spiegel is that a slush fund of 10.3 million Swiss francs (then about US$6 million) was used to secure four votes from FIFA's 24-member executive committee in 2000. \nGerman foreign minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Saturday called on the country's soccer federation \"to initiate investigations and clarify the outstanding issues now as soon as possible.\" \n\"It's in the interest of sport and football but it's also in all our interest that nothing is left unclear,\" Steinmeier said. \nA fresh denial came from German federation (DFB) president Wolfgang Niersbach in an interview conducted by their own website. \n\"The World Cup was not bought,\" Niersbach said of Germany's 12-11 win over South Africa in the 2000 vote. \nThe DFB said it would not make Niersbach available to interviews. \nNiersbach and Franz Beckenbauer, the former Germany great who headed the bidding committee, as well as other high-ranking football officials were accused in the report of being aware of the slush fund by 2005 at the latest. That is when former Adidas chief Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who reportedly provided the funding, asked for the money back before the World Cup began. Louis-Dreyfus died in 2009. \nAlthough the allegations are fresh it is not the first time the finger of suspicion has been pointed at Germany, whose bid has never been found guilty of corruption. \nSepp Blatter, who is currently suspended from the FIFA presidency, hinted that there could have been wrongdoing in an interview in 2012. \n\"World Cups being purchased,\" Blatter pondered when asked by Swiss paper Blick about allegations surrounding the 2018 and 2022 World Cup votes. \"I am reminded of the World Cup vote for 2006 when someone left the room at the last moment ... maybe I was too well-meaning and naive.\" \nWhen asked if he suspected the World Cup was bought by Germany, Blatter stressed: \"I guess not.\" \nCharlie Dempsey, then the Oceania president, abstained from voting despite being mandated to support the Nelson Mandela-backed South Africa bid in the final round. Dempsey said he received telephone threats from \"influential European interests\" the night before voting. He resigned from FIFA one week later and died in 2008. \nQuestions about Germany's bid had surfaced soon after the winning vote and were highlighted within British parliamentary committee report into England's bid failure.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:41:36.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
