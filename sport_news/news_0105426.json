(KOIN-6 (CBS), 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET).\nBoth teams look to snap three-game losing streaks, but the Titans (1-3) have given themselves opportunities to win late in their three losses. They blew fourth-quarter leads in losses to Indianapolis in Week 3 and to Buffalo last week. Mariota continues to play well, but he has thrown critical interceptions late in the fourth quarter to prevent an attempt to win the game.\nThe Titans' defense is ranked third in the NFL in total defense, but the unit has allowed too many big plays, particularly late in games that resulted in losses for Tennessee.\nSuh has been the focus of intense criticism as the Dolphins (1-3) have gotten off to a highly disappointing start. The defensive tackle and star of the unit, Suh is the leader of a defense that has been nothing short of awful. The problems resulted in the firing of head coach Joe Philbin and defensive coordinator Kevin Coyle. The defensive players weren't happy with Coyle's schemes and they're hoping interim coach Dan Campbell will turn the unit into a more aggressive group.\nIf you want to watch Mariota and the Titans take on Suh and the Dolphins, here's what you need to know:\nWhat : Miami Dolphins at Tennessee Titans\nWhere : Nissan Stadium, Nashville, TN\nWhen : Sunday, Oct. 18, 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET\nTV : KOIN-6 (CBS)\nWatch online : You can watch a live stream on DirecTV's live stream package.\n-- Geoffrey C.
