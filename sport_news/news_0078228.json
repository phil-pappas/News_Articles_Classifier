Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 9:42 pm Tigers wrap up CIC title, top Eagles By Rick Teverbaugh | The Herald Bulletin Herald Bulletin Posted on Oct 13, 2015 by Rick Teverbaugh \nALEXANDRIA — There were two purposes in Alexandria's volleyball match against Frankton on Tuesday night. \nThe first was to wrap up sole possession of the Central Indiana Conference title by ending the league campaign unbeaten. The second was to honor the two seniors on the varsity roster. \nThe Tigers accomplished both with a 25-10, 25-16, 25-13 win over the Eagles. \n\"We had Mississinewa, who was ranked No. 9 (No. 11 now in 3A) and Madison-Grant was No. 2 (now No. 8 in 2A), so this is a tough conference,\" said Alexandria coach Jeff Harmon. \"This is a big win for us.\" \nThe Tigers got rolling early in the first set, and before it was finished, the seniors — Makaylea Alberts and Stacie Farmer — had played a role. \nThe home team pulled out to a 12-4 lead. Farmer had a pair of kills in that run, but again it was sophomore Megan Miller doing most of the damage. She had had four kills and two ace serves. \nFarmer served an ace to cap another spurt to 16-6. From 19-10, Alberts took over the serve and ended the set. Miller had three kills, and Alberts had a kill and applied the closer with an ace. \nFrankton put up a bigger fight in the second set and actually led 9-8 off the serve of Johnna Billman. Billman, Kamryn Newby and Emily Benefiel each had a kill in that eruption. The Eagles remained close at 19-16 on an ace by Ryann Shively. \nThen Miller took the serve, and the set was over. Blaine Kelly had two kills, and Madalyn Weaver had kills down the stretch. \nAlex sprinted to an 11-2 advantage in the third set and never looked back. The lead went from 5-2 to 11-2 on the serve of Alberts, who had an ace. Miller had two kills and a block to provide three straight points. \nAs a perfect ending to the senior activities, the final point of the match came off Alberts' serve with a kill from Farmer. \n\"I am proud of our seniors, but I don't like senior night,\" said Harmon. \"There is so much emotion. I always like it better when it is the other team's senior night.\" \nBut the seniors are worthy of praise. \n\"Stacie has really stepped up her game from a year ago,\" said Harmon. \"She's one of the only girls who have done that at the net to support Megan (Miller). Makaylea has also played really well for us.\" \nAlberts had 31 assists and 10 digs in Tuesday's match. \nMiller, who was honored between the first and second sets for recently passing the 1,000-kill mark as a sophomore, added 20 kills Tuesday to run her career total 1,128. \nThe Tigers will be at Cowan on Thursday and then end the regular season on Saturday with a tournament at Union County. Frankton finishes at Taylor on Thursday.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:32:44.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
