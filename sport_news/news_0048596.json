No. 5 came with 7:24 left when he underthrew Kenny Lawler and was picked off by Dominique Hatfield at the Utah 18-yard line. \nThe Bears could not overcome six turnovers in the showdown of the Pac-12's two remaining unbeaten teams in front of a capacity crowd of 47,798 at Rice-Eccles Stadium. \nCal got the ball one last time at its own 5-yard line with 4:52 left, and Goff made the Utes sweat. He converted three third-down plays to extend the drive, using his arm and his legs to move to the Utah 21. \nBut on fourth-and-5 with 26 seconds left, Utah's Boobie Hobbs stepped in front of Darius Powe to knock down Goff's final pass of the night. \nCal (5-1, 2-1 Pac-12) was trying to reach 6-0 for the first time since 1950. \nThe Utes (5-0, 2-0) scored 17 points off Cal turnovers. \nA 4-yard touchdown run by Tre Watson with 2:03 left in the third quarter got the Bears within 27-24. \nThe game's star most of the night was Utah running back Devontae Booker, who rushed for 187 yards and two touchdowns through three quarters. Advertisement \nBut Booker fumbled with 2:45 left in the third quarter after a hit by Devante Downs, and Caleb Coleman recovered at the Utah 27. Three plays later, Watson went around left end for the touchdown that got the Bears within three points. \nThe Bears have next week off, then play at No. 20 UCLA on Thursday, Oct. 22. They return home to play USC on Halloween before visiting Oregon the following week. \nSomehow, the Bears trailed just 24-17 after a nightmarish first half by Goff and the offense. \nThe Bears, who had turned the ball over just 10 times in five previous games, gave it away five times in the half. Four of those were interceptions by Goff, who hadn't thrown more than two in a game since his debut as a freshman against Northwestern in the 2013 opener. \nESPN reported that no other FBS quarterback in the nation had thrown four in a game this season. \nThe first of Goff's picks went through the hands of target Kenny Lawler, but the others were on him: one thrown into tight coverage, another on an underthrown deep pass to Bryce Treggs and the last one on a tipped screen pass. \nCal survived its first three turnovers, allowing the Utes to cash them in for just three points. But Goff's last two picks of the half set up two touchdowns in a span of 1 minute, 39 seconds. \nUtah's Travis Wilson threw a 54-yard TD strike to wide-open cornerback-turned-receiver Cory Butler-Bird with 3:26 left before Booker scored on a 4-yard run for a 24-10 lead with 1:47 remaining. \nGoff rallied the Bears, completing five straight passes -- including a 50-yarder to Stephen Anderson -- to cut the deficit in half on a 1-yard TD toss to Darius Powe with 26 seconds left. \nCal was trying to end a 24-game road losing streak to teams ranked in the top five of The Associated Press Top 25. The Bears' most recent road victory over a top-five foe was a 20-7 win at No. 3 Stanford in 1951. \nRunning back Daniel Lasco, who had played just one half over the previous three games because of a hip injury, fumbled on his first carry and did not play again through the end of the third quarter. \nCal freshman nickel back Trey Turner had his first career interception in the first half. Downs also had a first-half pick for the Bears. \nCal starting safety Damariay Drew was injured in the first half but returned in the third quarter. \nPac-12 commissioner Larry Scott, on hand for the game, conceded the league's strength and balance could cost it a spot in the four-team College Football Playoff. \n\"If you've got a super-strong conference like we do and there's a multiple-loss champion, there's a risk they may not get in,\" he said. \"But more often than not, the champion emerging from the really strong conferences is going to get a spot in the playoff. \n\"There's no other champion from any other conference that's going to have a tougher road than our champion.\" For more on Cal sports, see the Bear Talk blog at ibabuzz.com/beartalk .
