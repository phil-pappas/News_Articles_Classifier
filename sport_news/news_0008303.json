Mark Gonzales Contact Reporter Chicago Tribune \nThe Cubs announced Thursday that Addison Russell will miss all of the National League Championship Series. \nRussell injured his hamstring stretching a double into a triple in the bottom of the fourth inning Monday night in Game 3 of the NLDS. \nCubs manager Joe Maddon said they haven't decided whether to add a pitcher or player to the roster to take Russell's spot. \n\"We'll continue to work on him,\" Maddon said. Hopefully if everything plays properly, we have another opportunity for him to play in another round. \n“He knows what’s happening next. He’s not going to necessarily push it right now. Let’s go on more of a normal pace with the training staff and not test it to the point where he could reinjure it again too soon by trying to be too aggressive.\" \nJavier Baez, who filled in for Russell after his injury, will start at shortstop, Maddon said. Baez hit a three-run home run in Game 4 of the NL Division Series against John Lackey of St. Louis on Tuesday. \n\"The thing about Addison is he’s played enough here this year to know he belongs here and he can do this,\" Maddon said. \"I want to believe Javy is arriving at that same point. To hit a three-run home run in that playoff game against one of the best pitchers in the National League should boost your confidence. \n\"The big thing is the consistency on defense.\" \nThe team also said that that Jon Lester will start Game 1 Saturday night and Jake Arrieta will start Sunday's Game 2. \nThe Cubs will either play the Mets or the Dodgers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:35:13.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
