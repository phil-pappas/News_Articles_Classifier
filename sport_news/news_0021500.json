Even in wealthy England the remark is often made that higher education is beyond the attainment of the average student belonging to the middle and poorer classes. A recent article in the Educational Supplement of the Times says: \"University training has been very expensive in the past and it is not cheap to day.\" There is no comparison between Indians and Englishmen as regards their respective economic abilities. What appears as fairly cheap to English students may be prohibitively costly to Indians. Nevertheless it must be noted that the expensiveness of the British ideal of education has been complained of even by our wealthier fellow subjects.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:05:17.933+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
