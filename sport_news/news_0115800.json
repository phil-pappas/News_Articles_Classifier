Jackson was found guilty of murder, felony murder, aggravated assault and weapons charges.\nHe will be sentenced at a later date, but faces a mandatory minimum sentence of life in prison with the possibility of parole, officials said.\nOn the night of Jan. 16, 2012, Jackson and Williams were reportedly escorted out of Old National Highway’s Club Rockafellas after having a fist fight.\n“Defendant Jackson went to his truck and retrieved a shotgun,” the district attorney’s office said in a news release. “He then confronted the victim in the parking lot and fired two shots, striking him in his back and stomach. After the victim fell to the ground, Defendant Jackson stood over him and fired several more shots at close range — this time fatally striking the victim in his head.”\nJackson fled the scene, but turned himself in a week later and claimed the shooting was in self-defense.\nHe has been held at the Fulton County jail since his arrest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T20:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:40:38.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
