October 2nd 2015 2 hours   \nWEST Coast Eagles captain Shannon Hurn says goalscoring has been a priority attention this week ahead of the Grand Final showdown with Hawthorn. \nGoal finishing from star sharpshooters Josh Kennedy, Jack Darling and Mark LeCras in the wide open spaces of the MCG could prove the difference in Hurn’s Eagles pulling off a miraculous premiership and dropping the chance as the powerhouse Hawks seek a place in history with a third straight title. \nHurn is convinced that an imposing combination of attacking and defensive football which has been a significant feature in the Eagles run to the title decider can be transferred to the MCG. \nWest Coast has been the best outfit this season at forcing turnovers inside their forward 50m zone and scoring, but stumbled with an alarmingly wayward 10.20 to beat North Melbourne at home in last Saturday’s preliminary final. \nThe first-year Eagles skipper said at a packed media conference in Melbourne straight after Friday’s traditional pre-match parade through Melbourne streets that improved goal-finishing is crucial in any plans to topple the Hawks. \n“You understand you always want to kick as straight as you can, but blokes have prepared as they normally would,” Hurn said.
