Filed: Saturday, October 10, 2015 at 16:54 UK Last Updated: Saturday, October 10, 2015 at 16:55 UK \nQueen of the South won a hard-fought encounter against Greenock Morton to remain in fifth position in the Scottish Championship. \nQueens took the lead after 15 minutes through top scorer Derek Lyle . \nLyle rose highest to power Alex Harris 's cross past Morton keeper Derek Gaston , for his fourth of the league season. \nGaston kept Queens' advantage to just one goal with a flying save from Harris' long-range effort. \nThe Ton started the second half in attacking fashion but Bobby Barr failed to bring his side back on level terms from close range. \nOn-loan Swansea City forward Alex Samuel then missed a chance from eight yards out as Greenock continued to attack. \nHowever, the Ton were unable to make their second-half pressure count as Queens edged a tight encounter. \nGreenock remain in sixth in the table following the loss.
