But for the team at NASA, the real pay off is the science data that's just started coming in. (Video via NASA )\nRecent geological activity (at least on a cosmic timescale): confirmed\nSurface scans suggest Pluto's been active in the last few hundred million years. (Video via NASA )\nThis July 14, 2015, photo provided by NASA shows a synthetic perspective view of Pluto, based on the latest high-resolution images to be downlinked from NASA�s New Horizons spacecraft. The new close-up images of Pluto reveal an even more diverse landscape than scientists imagined before New Horizons swept past Pluto in July. (NASA/Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory/Southwest Research Institute via AP) The behavior of ice on the surface implies tidal forces are at play, but we still aren't sure where Pluto might be getting that kind of energy.\nAtmosphere: confirmed (barely)\nNew Horizons has sent radio scans that establish a pressure baseline of ~10 μbar at the surface. (Video via NASA )\nThat's about 100 times more tenuous than the atmosphere of Earth at sea level.\n>> Read more trending stories\nShiny, minor moons: confirmed, but we don't know why\nNix and Hydra are highly reflective to New Horizon's cameras — probably thanks to water ice.\nBut we expect radiation and meteorites would wear those shiny surfaces down. It's not happening, and scientists don't yet have the data to explain why.\nHopefully, New Horizons will be able to fill in some gaps. It will be sending data well into next year.
