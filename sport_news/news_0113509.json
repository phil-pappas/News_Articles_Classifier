All three stats are career highs. \n\"I've been waiting the past two years and just accepting my role,\" Maulhardt said. \"This year, my number's been called a few times and I've gotten opportunities and I've been able to capitalize a little bit on them. It's real exciting.\" \nMaulhardt, like fellow junior receiver Tanner Gentry, took a backseat to guys like Robert Herron, Dominic Rufran and Jalen Claiborne over the past two seasons. \nLast season, Maulhardt caught 21 passes for 274 yards and one touchdown. And as a freshman in 2013, he hauled in nine catches for 76 yards and a score. \nBut now, Maulhardt has proven to be a capable starter, shining atop the depth chart. \n\"Jake has shown to be a guy that we can go to,\" UW coach Craig Bohl said. \"While he does not possess great speed, certainly with his physical stature — he's (6-foot-5) — he's a competitive guy who utilizes his body position on some throws.\" \nThat appeared evident last week at Air Force, when Maulhardt had a career-high two touchdown receptions — both in the fourth quarter — among his five catches for 65 yards. \n\"It felt good we were able to throw the ball,\" Maulhardt said. \"... It would've felt a lot better with a win, obviously.\" \nHe also turned in a dominant performance in the Cowboys' loss at Washington State in Week 3, when he registered career highs of 10 receptions and 113 receiving yards. \nHis big frame is coveted by quarterbacks and despised by defensive backs. \n\"He's just a big, physical guy,\" UW senior quarterback Cameron Coffman said. \"As a quarterback, you always like big targets because you can miss a little bit and he's still going to come down with it just with his wingspan, his long arms and things like that. He's really a mismatch for smaller defense backs who cover him.\" \nAdded UW interim wide receivers coach Gordie Haug: \"When defenses want to play man-to-man coverage on him, it becomes a big issue for those guys because usually those guys are around 5-10, 5-11 and they're trying to cover a big 6-5 kid at receiver.\" \nMaulhardt's receiving counterpart, Gentry, ranks 12th nationally with 592 receiving yards and three touchdowns on 33 catches this season. \nGentry's high production rate helps open opportunities for Maulhardt, and vice versa. \n\"I think when a defense looks, they've got to see there's a balanced outfit as far as how they deal with those two guys in particular,\" UW offensive coordinator Brent Vigen said. \"I think that's pretty critical. If you have one guy and you're moving him all over the place, but he's the one guy you're going to, I think it's pretty easy to tilt your defense to that guy. ... You better pay attention to both of them.\" \nSave for Maulhardt and Gentry, only junior tight end Jacob Hollister (15) owns more than 10 receptions this season. \nThe Cowboys hope to find more production from a bevy of freshman receivers getting playing time — Joseph Parker ranks first with four receptions, while James Price has three and Tayton Montgomery has two. \nJust as Maulhardt's impact helps create opportunities for Gentry, Haug believes it will pay dividends for the UW freshmen. \n\"So for Jake to continue to grab a bunch of catches and do the things that he's doing will continue to open up plays for those other receivers as well,\" Haug said. \nInformation from: Casper (Wyo.)
