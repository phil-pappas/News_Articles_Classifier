Kane was not on the roster for Thursday’s 5-2 exhibition loss to the Blues.\nKane has maintained his innocence and has continued to skate as the district attorney in charge of the case, Frank Sedita III, ponders whether to present the matter to a grand jury.\nSecond-to-last dance, last chance: The Hawks still have one more exhibition upcoming Saturday night against the Stars, but Thursday’s likely marked the final chance for some fringe players and prospects to impress the coaching staff and front office ahead of Wednesday’s season-opener against the Rangers.\nIn the lineup were wingers Viktor Tikhonov, Ryan Hartman and Kyle Baun, center Vincent Hinostroza and defensemen Viktor Svedberg and Erik Gustafsson.\nSvedberg and Gustafsson are fighting for one of the final spots on the roster, along with David Rundblad and Trevor van Riemsdyk.\n“I like knowing shift in, shift out you know what they’re going to do for you,” coach Joel Quenneville said. “Safe and consistent. Gustafsson offensively has some nice movement with the puck, gets involved in the attack. Svedberg, this year, has grown with the puck. Defensively, you have to like his assets with size and reaching ability.”\nThe Hawks also recalled winger Brandon Mashinter and defenseman Ville Pokka from Rockford for another game. Mashinter made the most of what is likely his final game with the Hawks for a while in scoring a goal in the first period.\nQuenneville said the roster for Saturday’s exhibition against the Stars is likely to be close to what the Hawks will start the season with Wednesday.\n“We’ll shorten up over the next couple of days and get down to basically our roster,” Quenneville said. “We have a couple of days of practice going into Wednesday. We don’t have a lot of time left. Guys have been here for a while. We had a really good week of practice and guys showed a lot as far as their pace and showed they can play when called upon.”\nOne player Quenneville said could expect to see some time this season, even if it isn’t to start the season, is Hartman, the Hawks’ 2013 first-round pick.\n“He’s one of those players we feel can play here,” Quenneville said. “He’s one of those guys who will get a chance either initially or over the course of the season. There’s potential, and the opportunity to get better is what we want. We want him playing.”\nPanarin almost back: Quenneville said winger Artemi Panarin, who has been out since training camp at Notre Dame as he recovers from an upper-body injury, practiced in Chicago on Thursday.\nQuenneville said Panarin could practice Friday and has a chance to play Saturday.\n“Originally we didn’t think about (Panarin playing) the weekend but it’ll give us something to think about,” Quenneville said.\nPrivacy Policy Joel Quenneville Patrick Kane Chicago Blackhawks David Rundblad", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560d9e89/turbine/ct-blackhawks-kane-bobblehead-spt-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:00:05.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
