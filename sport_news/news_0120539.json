On Wednesday, with our Cubs down three games against the New York Mets and facing elimination tonight in the National League Championship Series, I talked to her again.\nThis time about magical thinking.\nHow many of us fans are hoping, wishing, praying for a win tonight? How many of us know full well that what a fan does — such as touching a team's lineup card, which is what Cubs manager Joe Maddon reportedly asked actor and superfan Bill Murray to do Sunday — won't influence the game's outcome one iota?\nSo why do any of it? Why forgo a shower, shave or a haircut?\nWhitbourne, a University of Massachusetts Amherst professor who has written about sports psychology for her Psychology Today blog, said it's a common coping mechanism that simply makes us feel empowered. It makes us feel invested — true, blue.\n\"We like to feel we have control over outcomes we don't have control over,\" said Whitbourne. \"It's called illusory control. In an ever changing world, with so much uncertainty, it simply makes us feel better.\"\nBut, as we all know, baseball players are very superstitious too. Their beliefs, of course, do affect the game. Whitbourne said it's not uncommon for a team to choke during an important playoff game.\nCubs reach brink of elimination: 'Win on Wednesday - that's it,' says Maddon David Haugh Rain began to fall harder Tuesday night at Wrigley Field immediately after the final out of the Cubs' 5-2 loss to the Mets, and the only thing it signified was a sloppy drive home.\nMetaphorically, it meant nothing. There have been no cosmic signs or bad omens to speak of in this National League...\nRain began to fall harder Tuesday night at Wrigley Field immediately after the final out of the Cubs' 5-2 loss to the Mets, and the only thing it signified was a sloppy drive home.\nMetaphorically, it meant nothing. There have been no cosmic signs or bad omens to speak of in this National League...\n(David Haugh) \"The reason isn't just that they're bad players,\" she said. \"It's that it's natural to be very self-conscious, and not thinking in the flow of the moment. Sometimes they let the grand implications or the meaning of a big game affect them.\"\nOr get into their head.\n\"Everybody does that,\" she said. \"Your self-consciousness increases when you know something important will occur based on your behavior.\"\nBut what about that home-field advantage and the support of cheering fans, sending their positive vibes? Whitbourne said the home-field advantage can be a disadvantage if players are worried about disappointing their fans.\n\"Let's say you're a player who's self-focused and you're not playing as a team in the same way you originally played to get to the playoffs,\" she said. \"Maybe you didn't expect to get there and now you're staring down these raised expectations, it can be overwhelming.\"\nThat seems especially true when you're playing against a team like the Mets, who are also crusaders for their city and reputation. And the Mets, let's face it, they've got skills and most certainly their own brand of mojo.\nCubs really up against wall after losing third straight to Mets in NLCS Paul Sullivan Welcome back, pit in your stomach.\nIt has been a while.\nThat old nauseous feeling that greeted Cubs fans during must-see games had been mostly absent this postseason, thanks to an early lead over the Pirates in the wild-card game and three straight victories over the Cardinals after an opening...\nWelcome back, pit in your stomach.\nIt has been a while.\nThat old nauseous feeling that greeted Cubs fans during must-see games had been mostly absent this postseason, thanks to an early lead over the Pirates in the wild-card game and three straight victories over the Cardinals after an opening...\n(Paul Sullivan) Whitbourne said that teams often are better off when they adopt a \"whatever\" attitude so that they can take the game in stride and not put too much pressure on themselves.\nMaybe that applies to fans too.\nStill, that doesn't stop many of us from hoping and praying that our team does what the 2004 Red Sox did, which was come back from a 3-0 deficit to win a league championship series. It was the only team to ever do so.\nHere's to hoping that the Cubs can breathe such rarefied air. And let's keep our fingers crossed — just in case.\ndmturner@tribpub.com\n Chicago Cubs New York Mets Commentary Opinion National League Championship Series", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5627dedb/turbine/ct-cubs-magical-thinking-dawn-turner-20151021", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56278624/turbine/ct-sullivan-cubs-spt-1021-20151020", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56278b9d/turbine/ct-cubs-mets-nlcs-haugh-spt-1021-20151020"], "published": "2015-10-21T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T02:24:45.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
