You won’t cover a great deal of ground, of course, at the placid pace of a mile or two per hour. But this strikes me as a clear case in which quality, in terms of what you’ll see, hear and smell, trumps quantity as expressed in miles traveled. Because from a car, or even from a bicycle, you’ll inevitably miss some of the details that reveal themselves to a pedestrian. I was reminded of the simple pleasure of strolling unfamiliar streets and sidewalks this summer when I spent a couple of days in King City. It’s a southwest Portland suburb that boasts the curious distinction of being among both the newer, and the older, of Oregon cities. King City barely ranks as an adolescent as a legal entity, having been incorporated in 1966, almost a century after Baker City’s incorporation. But King City also is one of Oregon’s more venerable cities in a demographic sense. This is not a coincidence. King City was started as a planned community, restricted to people 50 and older. The age limit was later raised to 55, but King City’s boundaries also were expanded to include areas that have no age limit. Nonetheless, the average age of King City’s 3,111 residents, as of the 2010 U.S. Census, was 63.9 — a quarter century older than Oregon’s median age of 38.4. (But King City isn’t quite the eldest among Oregon towns. Richland’s average age at the time of the Census was 64.4. And 83.9 percent of Richland’s 156 residents were 50 or older, compared with 65.9 percent of King City’s populace.) I was curious, given the rather structured and artificial nature of King City’s history, whether the results would seem to me obvious as I plodded along. It was, and within a few blocks. King City’s unusual demographic status was blatant both by what I saw — every pedestrian I passed was clearly older than 50 — and by what I didn’t see — not a single plastic toy, basketball hoop, trampoline or any of the other inevitable outdoor accoutrements of the family with young kids living at home. In most other respects, though, King City didn’t distinguish itself, in my eyes at least, from several other suburban districts I’ve walked through. There were fewer cars parked in driveways and beside the curb than is common, it seemed to me — again, not an unexpected situation given the absence of teenagers. And perhaps there exists a greater degree of conformity among the homes, both architecturally and in their landscaping, than is typical. But this was no Levittown, with its somehow eerie homogeneity that always makes me think that behind the identical facades there lurk not humans but alien bodysnatchers. In King City there are brown lawns and lush green lawns and some lots with no lawn at all, the turf, if indeed it ever grew, replaced by decorative white stone or red cinders or, in a couple of memorable cases, by discarded filbert hulls. (Which are easy on water but rather more harsh, I would think, on bare feet.) Flowers grew profusely in places, including one hibiscus bloom so gigantic that it prompted Lisa to ask the woman who was tending the plot to confirm the species, so as to avoid telling a taxonomically inaccurate tale. Anyway I enjoyed my two hours or so of ambling King City’s streets, which meander in the potentially confounding but agreeably unpredictable way common to the whims of subdivision developers, most of whom apparently disdain the old-fashioned grid pattern that prevails in most of Baker City. And yet as I walked away from the last suburban street and stepped onto the shoulder of Highway 99, a banal commercial strip with nothing to distinguish it from any of hundreds of others across the nation, I felt the slightest twinge of disappointment. I often endure a minor and brief bout of melancholy when I’ve finished such a walking tour. It has to do with the people I’ve seen. I thought of the woman wearing the lemon-yellow sun visor who greeted me with a hearty “good morning” and who put her little schnauzer at heel when we passed at the entrance to a cul de sac, even though the diminutive dog seemed unlikely to do so much as nuzzle my ankle. And the man in the natty golfing togs who tipped me a friendly nod as he headed across the street toward a tee box (King City, as befits its retired residents, is bisected by a golf course). If you spend more than a few minutes walking in a residential area, at least when the weather is fine, you’re apt to come across at least a couple of fellow pedestrians. These chance encounters with people I’ve never before seen and almost surely will never see again seem to me sad, although I am not normally prone to maudlin thoughts. There is I suppose a sense of chances lost in these briefest of meetings, the prospect of potential conversations that didn’t happen, of possible friendships unfulfilled. It is of course impossible to know any such thing. Which is reason enough, when you come to a new street, to set off on a sedate journey along its cement paths. The world is far too sprawling for even the most inveterate traveler to see, at the walker’s pace, even a minuscule part of it. But I try to think of each street, each salutation from a stranger, as a tiny jewel to add to the collection called life.
