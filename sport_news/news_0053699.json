Evans and Morrison (ankle) are still being assessed at this stage. We will see how they are but both are doubts,\" said boss Tony Pulis. \n\"Many of the players won't be back in till later this week. Salomon (Rondon), Sess (Stephane Sessegnon) and Cristian (Gamboa) for instance don't come back until late Thursday or early Friday. It's ridiculous really but there's nothing we can do about it.\" \nWest Brom are 17th in the Barclays Premier League after successive defeats to Everton and Crystal Palace and Pulis hopes the home nations' qualification, with Chris Brunt and Gareth McAuley helping Northern Ireland reach France next year and Chester aiding Wales, will boost their season. \n\"It's pleasing to see them both qualify when you think of the nations who usually qualify - it's good to see other nations get their success. To have so many home nations at the Euros next summer will be good for everyone,\" he told the club's official site. \n\"I hope we will see a reaction from those players - if we do, brilliant.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T12:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T20:06:29.434+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
