Image 11 of 11 Mets stop skid in finale 1 / 11 Back to Gallery New York\nPrep week is over for the New York Mets . Now, it's on to the playoffs.\nJacob deGrom looked especially sharp in his abbreviated tuneup, and the NL East champions finally scored on Curtis Granderson 's eighth-inning homer to beat the Washington Nationals 1-0 in their regular-season finale Sunday.\n\"I just think it's a great way to finish,\" manager Terry Collins said. \"I think we're ready.\"\nOne day after Washington ace Max Scherzer pitched a no-hitter with 17 strikeouts to complete a doubleheader sweep, the Mets (90-72) made a run at a combined no-hitter of their own.\nThey reached 90 wins for the first time in nine years and stopped a five-game losing streak that cost them home-field advantage in the Division Series against the Dodgers.\nNext up, deGrom will start Game 1 in the best-of-five matchup Friday at Los Angeles.\n\"This is what we play for,\" deGrom said. \"I'm really looking forward to this.\"\nSeven pitchers combined to hold Washington to two hits — the first was Clint Robinson 's two-out single in the seventh inning off reliever Jonathon Niese .\nBryce Harper hustled for a two-out double in the ninth to finish 1-for-4, but that wasn't enough to beat out Miami speedster Dee Gordon for the National League batting crown.\nGordon went 3-for-4 in Philadelphia and finished with a .333 average to Harper's .330. The front-runner for NL MVP, Harper began the day ahead by the slimmest of margins — .330754 to .330606.\nThe slugger ended his sensational season with 42 homers and 99 RBIs.\nJeurys Familia retired Jayson Werth on a fly to center for his 43rd save, equaling the franchise record set by Armando Benitez in 2001.\nWith the Mets gearing up for their first postseason appearance since 2006, deGrom was pulled after throwing 72 pitches in four innings. He struck out four of his first five batters and finished with seven strikeouts.\nBartolo Colon and Logan Verrett each tossed a hitless inning of relief before Niese entered in the seventh.\nWith two outs, Robinson sent a sharp two-hopper up the middle that went between Niese's legs and caromed off the shin of shortstop Ruben Tejada as he tried to make a sliding stop.\nThe ball ricocheted into right field, and official scorer Jordan Sprechman ruled it a hit almost immediately.\nTyler Clippard (4-1) struck out two in a perfect eighth. Moments later, Granderson launched a drive to center off Blake Treinen (2-5) for his 26th homer of the season and third hit of the game.\nIt snapped New York's scoreless stretch of 18 innings and marked the team's second run in a span of 43 innings.\nA crowd of 41,631 pushed New York's total attendance to 2,569,753 — highest since the club drew more than 3 million during Citi Field's inaugural season in 2009.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/47/8739265/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739261/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/47/8739267/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739260/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/47/8739264/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/47/8739267/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739263/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739257/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739260/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/47/8739266/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739262/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/47/8739266/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739263/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/47/8739265/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/47/8739264/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739259/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739259/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739262/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739257/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/25/46/8739261/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:56:23.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
