Photograph by: Michael B. Thomas , Getty Images \nST. LOUIS — Todd Gurley got his first NFL touchdown out of the way, and then he got another one. \nIt looks as if this could be a regular occurrence for the rookie and the Rams. \nGurley rushed for 128 yards and two TDs, helping St. Louis put away the Cleveland Browns 24-6 on Sunday. \nSt. Louis (3-3) had four sacks and recovered four fumbles. The Rams scored 10 points off miscues on Cleveland’s first two series, a 17-yard fumble recovery by Rodney McLeod and a field goal after the first of William Hayes’ two sacks and strips of Josh McCown on the day. \nJohnny Manziel got mop-up duty for the Browns (2-5) after McCown left for the locker room favouring his right arm with about four minutes left. \nMcCown has lost to the Rams for three straight seasons with three different teams. He was with Chicago in 2013 and Tampa Bay last year. \nGurley scored on runs of 1 and 16 yards. He fell short of joining Hall of Famers Eric Dickerson and Marshall Faulk as the lone Rams players to gain 140 or more yards for three straight games. \nGurley had a big grin on his face as teammate Kenny Britt followed him back to the bench and waved his arms at the crowd in celebration after the running back scored his second TD in the fourth quarter. \nCoach Jeff Fisher was on the field frantically waving for a timeout just before the snap on Gurley’s first career touchdown that made it 17-6 late in the third. Gurley ambled in untouched from a yard out and Fisher spun the headset wire around his legs as he retreated to sideline. \nBrowns cornerback Pierre Desir, starting in place of injured Joe Haden, struggled on that drive. He interfered with Britt for a 26-yard penalty, and then was beaten on the next play by Britt on a 41-yarder to the Cleveland 1. \nGurley reversed field on a 48-yard jaunt to the Cleveland 22 on the Rams’ first possession of the second half, but St. Louis got nothing out of it. The offence stalled and Greg Zuerlein hooked a 35-yard field goal attempt just wide right. \nThe Rams led 10-0 after the first quarter despite mustering just 3 yards offence and getting dominated in time of possession, with the Browns holding the ball for 11 minutes and 34 seconds.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T01:26:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:37:47.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
