Discontent is brewing among a section of the BJP MLAs after three resolutions moved by the party legislators were disallowed by the Assembly Secretariat. The resolution submitted by the BJP’s Ravinder Raina, titled “Implement the ban on cow/beef as per the direction of High Court of Jammu and Kashmir”, is among the five resolutions disallowed. The resolution submitted by Raina, a legislator from Nowshera, had further stated that the ban should be implemented strictly and the guilty awarded capital punishment. A similar resolution on the implementation of the court’s order submitted by the BJP’s Rajiv Jasrotia has also been disallowed. The Legislative Assembly secretariat had received 50 resolutions out of which five have been disallowed and the rest put through a ballot test. Six resolutions have passed the ballot, which was held on Thursday, according to documents released on the Assembly’s website. The resolution titled “Article 35-A of the constitution be defended and protected”, which was submitted by Awami Ittehad Party’s Engineer Abdul Rashid, has also been disallowed. The Article, which bars non-residents of Jammu and Kashmir from buying land or property in the state, has been described as a clarificatory provision to clear the issue of the constitutional position in the rest of country in contrast to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. Official sources said the resolution linked to Article 35-A was disallowed because the matter is sub judice. A similar resolution moved by National Conference MLA Devender Singh Rana has also been disallowed. The second resolution submitted by Raina, titled “Human rights violations by Pakistan in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan, and to take necessary steps to vacate Pak-occupied Jammu and Kashmir and Gilgit-Baltistan from illegal occupation of Pakistan” has also been disallowed. The decision of disallowing resolutions on enforcing beef ban and discussions on human right violations in PoK has enraged a group of BJP MLAs. Although most of the MLAs are not openly expressing their resentment, Raina did not mince his words to say: “It is very unfortunate that my resolution to enforce the High Court’s ruling has been disallowed with the plea that the matter in sub judice but the Assembly Secretariat has allowed the NC’s Bill on the same issue.” However, highly places sources said Speaker Kavinder Gupta has decided to again seek opinion of legal experts after the Supreme Court gave its consent to listen to the plea of the state government on the beef controversy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:03:47.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
