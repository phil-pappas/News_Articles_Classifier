Clayton Geathers gets injured in the second quarter,” McAfee said. “Insert Griff Whalen who had never done it before. So Griff Whalen is now the new center in a play he’s never practiced before.”\nMcAfee explained that the Colts were trying to fool the Patriots into thinking they were running their offense back onto the field for the critical fourth down, in hopes of drawing a penalty.\n“The point of the play is a deception play. So, you’re trying to manipulate the (receiving team) into thinking they have to sub their defense back on,” said McAfee. “We are sprinting to the sideline in hopes to make the other team think we are subbing our offense back onto the field. So, when they think the offense is coming back on the field, your hope is that they think their defense has to come back on the field.\n“As soon as their defense comes back on the field, we snap it, steal five yards (because the defense would have too many men on the field), and we get a first down,” he said. “So there’s the intention of it. That’s the thought.”\nBill Belichick's team was well-coached and didn't take the bait. Instead, they played the shift perfectly with their punt return unit, and kept 11 men in the formation.\nSo now what?\nThe Colts had added a wrinkle during the week in which their goal becomes trying to draw the return team offsides, and if they don't jump, Indy takes a benign delay of game penalty.\nSimple enough, but Whalen wasn't with that practice grouping when that wrinkle was added.\n“Last week (in practice), Griff is at the other end catching my punts. We added something to try and draw them offsides if they don’t do their substitution,” McAfee said. “Griff never got the heads up this was happening, because it’s not in the playbook. Stanford guy, reads the playbook, knows everything he has to do, but if he’s not there for an audible that’s added, he can’t know.”\nOn the original trick play, Whalen was supposed to snap the ball if Anderson goes under center.\nWhen Anderson came to the line to try and draw the defense offsides, Whalen snapped the ball like he was supposed to in the original play, and Anderson was pummelled by five Patriots.\nMcAfee chalks it up to miscommunication, but it can just as easily be seen as a mismanagement on the part of Pagano's coaching staff.\nIt's hard to excuse a coach for running a play in which one of the focal points has no idea what is going on.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:29:01.479+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
