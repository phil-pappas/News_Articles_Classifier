Swarupam Purkayastha was the lone Assam batsman to fall, bowled by Karnataka skipper R Vinay Kumar.\nEarlier, Karnataka's decision to bat first after winning the toss backfired as Assam picked up wickets at regular intervals with Syed Mohammad turning out to be the wrecker-in-chief.\nSyed Mohammad accounted for the wickets of in-form Mayank Agarwal (36), Robin Uthappa (11), CM Gautam, Karun Nair (14), Shreyas Gopal (9), Vinay Kumar and Abhimanyu Mithun during his magical day.\nShishir Bhavane (65) was the only Karnataka batsman to put up a fight against the Assam tweakers. He scored his runs off 143 balls with the help of six boundaries.\nLeg-break bowler Amit Verma (2/16) also chipped in with two wickets against his former Ranji teammates, while pacer Krishna Das (1/22) accounted for the other.\nBrief Scores:\nKarnataka 1st innings: 187 all out in 75.2 (Shishir Bhavane 65; Jamaluddin Syed Mohammad 7/44).
