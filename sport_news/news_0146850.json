We've done all the work in preparation for this series, and I think we're in a good place.\" \nRoot acknowledges a tough mission, to succeed where all others have so far failed, but a challenge too he insists is within England's capabilities. \n\"We're very realistic,\" he said. \n\"We know it's going to be really tough ... and we're going to have to play extremely well to beat them. \n\"But we're definitely capable of doing that if we play at our best.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:59:36.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
