Additional images below. Facebook Over recent years, there have been a distressing number of hit-and-run accidents involving cyclists in the area, with far too many of them having fatal consequences .\nFortunately, the worst didn't happen to 54-year-old Mark Mihelic.\nHe's expected to survive, even though his injuries are frightful.\n9News reports that Mihelic suffered a severe concussion, internal bleeding and spinal-cord damage that had to be addressed by many hours of surgery.\nAnd the driver? In the beginning, he may have been unclear on the damage he caused. But when a witness told him what happened, he allegedly took off — and he remains on the loose at this writing.\nNear where the accident took place. 9News According to the Colorado State Patrol, the incident took place at around 12:15 p.m. on Friday, October 16, on the 6800 block of Olde Stage Road near the Valley Lane intersection outside Boulder.\nResponding deputies found a man subsequently identified as Mihelic.\nRelated Stories Theresa O'Connor, guilty in hit-and-run that killed cyclist, may not get jail time A photo of Mihelic's bike taken by Frank Sledge, his riding partner that day, offers an indication of the impact.\nHere's the shot.\nPhoto by Frank Sledge via 9News Sledge tells 9News that the driver didn't stop after striking Mihelic — and that was shocking to a witness behind the wheel of another vehicle.\nShe's said to have followed after the original driver and was able to pull up alongside him and tell him about the damage he'd done.\nWe don't know the specifics of that conversation. But in the end, the hit-and-run suspect put the pedal to the metal and motored away.\nIn response, the witness dialed 911, then returned to the scene.\nAnother Facebook photo of Mark Mihelic. Facebook The CSP describes the suspect's vehicle as being a reddish mid-90s Chevy or GMC pickup truck.\nIn addition, the right front headlamp may be damaged.\nAs for the description of the driver, it's unfortunately quite vague.\nHe's characterized as a white male in his mid-twenties to thirties.\nAnother look at Mihelic's damaged bicycle. Photo by Frank Sledge via 9News If you have any information about this incident or know the identity of the driver, you're encouraged to contact the Colorado State Patrol dispatch center at 303-239-4501.\nReference case number 1D154908.\nIn the meantime, we send our best wishes for a speedy recovery to Mark Mihelic.\nAs for drivers, please keep your eye out for cyclists — and if an accident takes place, see what you can do to help instead of leaving a victim in agony and speeding away.\nContact: Michael Roberts Follow: Michael Roberts Westword Westword", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/pages/Michael-RobertsWestword/111180895657427", "http://www.9news.com/story/news/local/2015/10/16/boulder-hit-and-run-olde-stage-road/74077620/", "http://www.twitter.com/denverwestword", "https://www.facebook.com/DenverWestword"], "published": "2015-10-19T15:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:08:33.387+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
