Also, the pope may have been involved in saving a Christian school from a major upset. More >> \n(RNN) - Wacky things happen in Florida. It’s kind of the state’s identity. \nAnd it has remained true in college football, too. The Florida Gators are sitting undefeated right now after a mediocre 7-5 record last season and a head coaching change. Many had already tagged this season as a rebuilding year for the Gators. \nWhile the toughest part of the schedule hasn’t reared its ugly head yet, they look like a potential contender in the SEC East. \nThis weekend, the Gators will line up against Ole Miss, an undefeated SEC West squad who beat juggernaut Alabama earlier this season in Tuscaloosa. \nMeanwhile, the team most would consider a front-runner for the SEC East crown, Georgia, has its chance against the Crimson Tide this weekend. \nWhen the Bulldogs play host to Alabama on Saturday in Athens, it will be the first time Alabama has been considered an underdog in 72 consecutive games. \nBoth Florida and Georgia are both looking to maintain undefeated records this week, and both SEC East rivals face the toughest opposition yet. \nOle Miss vs Florida \nPlayer to look out for: Florida QB Will Grier \nThe Gators have been fortunate to go undefeated this season considering their instability at the signal caller position. \nDuring the first three games of the season, Florida was able to nab victories through its stalwart defense without being hindered by its nebulous quarterback situation, which included benching starter Treon Harris. \nLast week, however, was a different story. The Gators walked away with an impressive victory over SEC East rival Tennessee, and their quarterback had a lot to do with it. \nWill Grier, Harris’ replacement, came up big during the latter part of the game, throwing for 283 yards and two scores. His 63-yard pass to Antonio Callaway was the game-winning touchdown. \nLast week’s Grier is who Florida needs to show up this week, too. Actually, the Gators may need more than that. \nOle Miss is a scary team on both sides of the ball. What’s more important to note is that the Rebels are a team with playoff aspirations after upsetting Alabama and ascending to rank 3 in the Associated Press poll. \nIf the Gators have the same aspirations, this is a necessary win. The team sneaked to rank 25 in the AP poll this week, and a victory against Ole Miss would give pollsters and analysts, who likely categorized Florida’s season as a rebuilding year, a new team to potentially get excited about. \nWhile Florida’s defense is incredible, Ole Miss is scoring 54.8 points per game. Against Alabama, a comparable defense to the Gators’, Ole Miss was able to put 43 points on the board. Twenty-four of those points came from the Crimson Tide’s five turnovers, many of which were caused by inexperience at the quarterback position. \nFlorida, like Alabama, also has an inexperienced quarterback and a frustrated offense. \nSo if that game is indicative of this weekend’s showdown in Gainesville, Florida is going to need more than just defense to win the game. The Gators are going to need to score points and protect the ball from an opportunistic defense to find victory. \nGrier is going to have to show up in a big way to win in front of a home crowd on Saturday. \nAlabama vs Georgia \nPlayer to watch out for: Alabama QB Jake Coker \nIt’s not particularly unique to have two quarterbacks as the game changers this week, but this pick seems like a no-brainer. \nThe Crimson Tide are an incredibly talented team. Besides a sometimes susceptible secondary, Alabama’s only glaring weakness is at the quarterback position, and, boy, it is a huge weakness \nAlabama's loss to Ole Miss in Bryant-Denny Stadium (the team’s first since 2012) was proof of that. The Tide walked away only losing by six despite turning the ball over five times. \nIt’s not to say that Alabama’s quarterback play is uninspired. Jake Coker, who was not the starter against the Rebel, came into the Ole Miss game and definitely provided energy. Unfortunately for the Crimson Tide, he also provided two interceptions. \nAlabama cannot expect to revive its playoff hopes if the team turns the ball over five times on the road against undefeated Georgia. \nCoker, the presumed starter, is going to have to bring the same energy from the Ole Miss game, but leave the interceptions at home, if the Tide hope to renter the national conversation. \nLuckily for Alabama fans, Nick Saban hasn’t lost back-to-back games since 2013 when the Crimson Tide lost the Iron Bowl and the subsequent bowl game against Oklahoma. \nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
