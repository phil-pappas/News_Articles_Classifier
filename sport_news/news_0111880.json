The ambiance and facilities were word class and there was less traffic chaos en route the new civil terminal that became operational today with the landing of a JetKonnect flight from Delhi at 8.05 am. A total of 21 domestic flights operated from the new facility. Amid an air of newness, the passengers on board the first flight from Delhi were in for a pleasant moment when they stepped into the arrival lounge that has international-level facilities. Equally excited were those who were arriving at the departure lounge to board flights. Passengers, who rated the new terminal world class, were keen on knowing the status of international flights from here. “The operations on the opening day were normal and passengers enjoyed the facilities at the new terminal,” said Sunil Dutt, CEO of the airport. “The new terminal is good and passenger-friendly. We are looking forward to the start of international flights from here in the coming time,” said Pritam Kapoor, who returned to the city from Delhi. Passengers who came from nearby cities of Punjab also liked the new terminal and found it more convenient than the old terminal. “The road to the new terminal is better. After raising world-class infrastructure, the authorities should now think of introducing international flights at the earliest and also new flights to domestic tourist spots,” said Alpinder Singh Kang, a resident of Patiala. The first day also witnessed some minor troubles with taxi operators demanding counters and security personnel finding ways to barricade the arrival lounge. “The taxi operators should be provided more counters here. Earlier, the terminal was located in Chandigarh and it was easy to spot a radio taxi. However, this terminal is located far from the city and taxi operators need a permanent place to station themselves here,” said a group of taxi operators. A passenger said, “The authorities concerned should install a big screen for displaying information about arrivals and departures rather than installing small LED screens on both gates,” said Manmeet Kaur, a local resident. Security personnel raised the issue of installing pillars near the arrival gates to restrict people’s movement in front of the arrival gate.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:06:23.040+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
