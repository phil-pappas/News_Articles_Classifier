Patriots troll Jets on Twitter, again Patriots by 8 1/2; O/U: 47 1/2\nJets-Pats may not have all the hype of recent seasons -- you can thank the mild-mannered Todd Bowles for that -- but it's one of the week's best matchups. First place on the line. Pats' NFL-best offense (36.6 points per game) vs. Jets' league-best defense (15 ppg). Tom Brady vs. Darrelle Revis. Brady is 20-6 straight up against Jets. Ryan Fitzpatrick gets his first taste of rivalry, but the QB has struggled in his career vs. Pats: 1-6 record with 17 INTs. If he continues to have success throwing to Brandon Marshall (four straight games with at least seven catches and 100 yards), this will be a close game. Chris Ivory will be able to run against Pats' 'D' allowing 114.6 rushing yards per game. Pats win, but Jets keep it inside number.\nThe pick: Jets\nCOWBOYS (2-3) AT GIANTS (3-3), 4:25 p.m.\nTV: Ch. 5; Radio: WFAN (660, 101.9)\nGiants by 4; O/U: 45\nThe NFC East is a game of Hot Potato: \"You take it . . . No, you take it!\" The Giants had a chance to grab control with a win in Philly but fell apart. Is there any team that needs a win more than the Cowboys? They're 0-3 without Tony Romo, and now turn to Matt Cassel after ending the Brandon Weeden Experiment. Cassel hasn't started since Week 3 of last season. But he's had success (34 career wins), and Dallas smartly chose to watch a new episode of Cassel than another Weeden rerun. Everyone will say this is a revenge game, a chance at redemption for Giants after their Week 1 meltdown. True, but it's also a rivalry game. Dallas has won nine of its last 10 on road, and I see this being a slugfest won by a field goal.\nThe pick: Cowboys\nBILLS (3-3) VS. JAGUARS (1-5) At London, 9:30 a.m.\nBills by 4; O/U: 41\nIf you thought this matchup was unwatchable, wait until next week when the Lions and Chiefs (combined 2-10) play in London. Jags have not fared well in London (outscored 73-27 in two games). A London mauling is just what Rex Ryan and struggling Buffalo needs.\nThe pick: Bills\n1 P.M. GAMES\nTEXANS (2-4) AT DOLPHINS (2-3)\nDolphins by 5; O/U: 44 1/2\nMiami responded to interim coach Dan Campbell, scoring nearly as many points last week (38) as it did during three-game losing streak (48). The defense got six sacks after having one in first four games. Miami hasn't played in home stadium since Week 3, a 41-14 loss to the Bills. Don't think that isn't a motivating factor.\nThe pick: Dolphins\nLOCK OF THE WEEK\nBROWNS (2-4) AT RAMS (2-3)\nRams by 6; O/U: 41 1/2\nThe Browns have led the league in dramatic finishes. After losing on a last-second field goal in Week 4, they followed that up with back-to-back overtime games. Rams, off a bye, will have the fresher legs. Speaking of fresh legs, have you seen Todd Gurley run? The rookie missed the first two games, hardly played in Week 3 and then racked up 305 yards on 49 carries the next two games. Guess which team is the worst at stopping the run in the NFL? Yep, the Browns, who have allowed a whopping 149.8 yards per game.\nThe pick: Rams\nSTEELERS (4-2) AT CHIEFS (1-5)\nLine OFF (Steelers QB)\nLandry Jones faces a tough environment in his first NFL start, but the former Oklahoma quarterback is used to intense Midwest crowds. Sooner or later, Chiefs have to stop losing streak, but that secondary won't be able to stop Antonio Brown and Martavis Bryant.\nThe pick: Steelers\nSAINTS (2-4) AT COLTS (3-3)\nTV: Ch. 5\nColts by 4; O/U: 52\nAs long as the Colts don't try any fake punts, they'll be fine. Indy is 1-2 at home, 0-2 with Andrew Luck. That changes against a Saints defense that is allowing an NFL-worst 409.7 yards per game.\nThe pick: Colts\nFALCONS (5-1) AT TITANS (1-4)\nFalcons by 5; O/U: 47\nAtlanta bounces back from its first loss against a Titans team that likely won't have Marcus Mariota and is 1-10 in last 11 home games.\nThe pick: Falcons\nVIKINGS (3-2) AT LIONS (1-5)\nVikings by 2 1/2; O/U: 44\nDetroit's second win will have to wait, as Adrian Peterson (192 total yards in Week 2 win over Lions) and Vikings defense (allowing second-fewest points per game at 16.6) have big days.\nThe pick: Vikings\nBUCS (2-3) AT REDSKINS (2-4)\nRedskins by 3; O/U: 42 1/2\nRedskins have played well at home and Bucs have played well on road, so take the team getting points and coming off a bye.\nThe pick: Bucs\n4 P.M. GAME\nRAIDERS (2-3) AT CHARGERS (2-4)\nChargers by 4; O/U: 47\nFinally, I didn't incorrectly pick a Raiders game . . . because they were on a bye last week. The six teams that have had their bye this season are 5-1 overall and 6-0 ATS the next week. San Diego continues to find new ways to lose close games, and I think this is a toss-up field-goal game. Give me the points as I look to snap personal 0-5 ATS Oakland streak. The pick: Raiders\nSUNDAY NIGHT\nEAGLES (3-3) AT PANTHERS (5-0), 8:20 p.m.\nTV: Ch. 4\nRadio: WFAN (660, 101.9)\nPanthers by 3; O/U: 46\nThe Eagles have won two straight and three of four, but Sam Bradford continues to throw interceptions. Three more last week gave him nine on the season. Carolina's defense is tied for third with eight INTs and should feast on Bradford. Panthers could experience letdown after thrilling comeback win in Seattle, but playing in prime time prevents that.\nThe pick: Panthers\nMONDAY NIGHT\nRAVENS (1-5) AT CARDINALS (4-2), 8:30 p.m.\nTV: ESPN\nRadio: WFAN (660, 101.9)\nCardinals by 9; O/U: 48\nSo if the 49ers beat the Ravens by five, and the Cardinals beat the 49ers by 40, Arizona should beat Baltimore by 45, right? If only picking NFL games were that easy. Here's simpler math: Cards' 203 points are an NFL-best while Ravens' 162 allowed are fifth-most. Add that to Carson Palmer's 12-3 straight-up home record with Arizona and it equals a cover.\nThe pick: Cardinals\nSTAFF PICKS\nBEST BETS IN ALL CAPS\nJOE MANNIELLO 44-44-3, 3-2-1 best bets\nLast week: 7-6-1\nJets Cowboys Bills Dolphins\nRAMS Steelers Colts\nFalcons Vikings Bucs\nRaiders Panthers Cardinals\nBOB GLAUBER 47-41-3, 3-3\nLast week: 7-6-1\nJets Giants Bills Dolphins\nRams Chiefs Colts\nFalcons Vikings Redskins\nChargers PANTHERS Cardinals\nTOM ROCK 42-46-3, 5-0-1\nLast week: 6-7-1\nJets Giants Jaguars Dolphins\nRams Steelers Saints\nFALCONS Lions Bucs\nChargers Panthers Ravens\nKIMBERLEY A.
