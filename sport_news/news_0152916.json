Valant finished the game with four receptions for 105 yards. \nDaughery connected with Peter Kilburg on a 21-yard scoring play in the second quarter to extend the lead. North Cedar pulled within 16-13 late in the half, but Bellevue put the game out of reach with three third-quarter scores. \nDaugherty completed 6 of 9 passes for 133 yards, and Lucas Anderson carried the ball 26 times for 110 yards for the Comets. \nMason Lyons led the Bellevue defense with six solo tackles and two assists. He had one sack and 2.5 tackles for lost yardage. Jacob Holst and Cody Fields each was in on eight tackles for the Knights. \nBELLEVUE 37, NORTH CEDAR 20 \nBellevue 10 6 21 0 — 37 \nNorth Cedar 7 6 0 7 — 20 \nNC — Ian Malaby 95 run (Malaby kick), 11:44 \nB — FG Jacob Rentz 31. 3:51 \nB — Neal Valant 39 pass from Cade Daugherty (Rentz kick), :23 \nB — Peter Kilburg 21 pass from Daugherty (kick blocked), 7:49 \nNC — Jacob Holst 8 run (kick blocked), :59 \nB — Daugherty 1 run (Rentz kick), 7:45 \nB — Lucas Anderson 5 run (Rentz kick), 3:50 \nB — Tanner Michels recovered blocked punt in end zone (Rentz kick), 1:53 \nNC — Malaby 25 run (kick good), 3:14 \nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS \nRUSHING – North Cedar, Ian Malaby 3-50, Jacob Holst 8-28, Kaleb Galloway 3-0, Carter Johnson 3-minus-8, Shane Weber 10-minus-8; Bellevue, Lucas Anderson 26-110, Peter Kilburg 17-45, Cade Daugherty 15-19. \nPASSING — North Cedar, Holst 7-17-0-81, Johnson 2-6-0-9; Bellevue, Daugherty 6-9-0-133. \nRECEIVING — North Cedar, Brendan Sander 2-31, Bryce Bemer 2-30, Jacob Jensen 1-12, Malaby 3-10, Weber 1-7; Bellevue, Neal Valant 4-105, Kilburg 1-21, Jacob Rentz 1-7.
