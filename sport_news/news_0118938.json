But instead of retreating to her four-story Los Angeles condo in retirement, the busty 5-foot-2 beauty sashayed into another game: fantasy sports.\nAs the host of “Lisa Ann Does Fantasy” on Sirius XM radio twice a week, Ann is a natural behind the mic. And while she credits the Dallas Cowboys and her dad for schooling her in Football 101, bedding hundreds of athletes over a 15-year span definitely boosted her sports IQ.\n“She’s different,” a pro athlete spilled to Fox Sports’ Flinder Boyd . “She’s the type of person who takes command. If I need advice, I’ll call her, and I listen to what she tells me.”\nAnother great show tonight on Lisa Ann Does Fantasy on Sirius Fantasy Sports Network 🏈Big Week in Fantasy Football. Time to work the waiver wires! 🏈 \nA photo posted by Lisa Ann (@thereallisaann) on Sep 29, 2014 at 10:10pm PDT \nAnn’s charm isn’t limited to football flings. Franchise brass are known to perk up as well.\n“I’ll sit in the family room or green room beforehand and start talking to play-by-play guys or coaches or agents that walk by,” Ann said in the excellent profile piece . “Most of them think they’re going to f–k me the whole time. And 99 percent of them never will, but I’m willing to fight that battle to get to know stuff about these teams.”\nAs for the pros who turn her down (yes, they do exist), the brunette bombshell confesses she isn’t afraid to bring in reinforcements for some extra convincing.\n“I couldn’t get this player’s attention. I tried everything. So I decided to go to [an NBA] game with two Playboy bunnies at my side,” Ann says. “I looked like this tiny little girl next to them. But at halftime, the team assistant came up to me and said, ‘[He] wants to meet you after the game.’ I got my guy.”\nWhile it’s unclear if she and the baller ever tangoed off the court, Ann shares that she is still on the hunt for her very own MVP.\n“The thing is, everyone wants to be with me,” she said. “But no one wants to be with me.”\nCare to get in line, guys?\nMy Baseball Story.. ⚾️ So you know this was my first season learning, reading, following & studying Baseball. Tho I had been to games, I never really understood the sport & with my new knowledge I have found my love & respect for the game. TONIGHT I wore my first piece of @mets Gear \"Murphy\" jersey. I have attended 4 Mets Games this year & they have won all 4. I decided today, I would wear my gear & if they won, I would make the Mets My Team. ⚾️ it's hard to be a fan and not pick sides. I have enjoyed a long season of just watching so many teams, but I think it started that day when I met Mr Met! ⚾️ That's my baseball story. ⚾️ \nA photo posted by Lisa Ann (@thereallisaann) on Aug 12, 2015 at 8:37pm PDT \n  fantasy baseball ,  fantasy football ,  porn stars ,  sirius xm", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:44:25.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
