Hurricanes insist FSU loss won't derail season \nEven before the game was played, the Hurricanes faced the question. \nIf they came up short in their annual rivalry game with Florida State, could they bounce back? \nMiami's players and coaches didn't care to address that topic before Saturday night's heartbreaking 29-24 loss to the 11th-ranked Seminoles, but now the Hurricanes have to deal with the harsh reality that after their previous two losses to FSU, they combined to go and post a 2-6 record. \nIn 2013, that meant losing three of their last five. Last season, that meant dropping their last three. \nAnd in the emotionally-charged minutes after Saturday night's loss — Miami's sixth straight to the Seminoles and its fifth straight under coach Al Golden — a frustrated Brad Kaaya angrily vowed that this time, his team would bounce back. \nPerhaps no yearly matchup in college football has spawned a greater collection of NFL-caliber talent--certainly over the past three decades--than the annual Miami Hurricanes-Florida State Seminoles game. Here are a collection of the series' standout performances----throughout a game, or even in a crucial moment of a win. (Steve Svekis) \n\"We have to bounce back from it. We can't let what happened last year happen again. We can't let this linger,\" said Kaaya, who had a career-high 405 yards with three touchdowns against FSU. \"We have to get right back to it starting tomorrow. We have the Coastal [Division] now and that's been our goal since day one, to win the Coastal and it starts with Virginia Tech this next week. That's a good team.\" \nAdded Stacy Coley, who along with Rashawn Scott was one of two Miami receivers to put together a 100-yard performance against FSU, \"We just have to continue to lead. It was a tough loss for us, but [Sunday], we'll go in and see what our mistakes were and try to build from that, continue to lead and continue to stay positive.\" \nHighlights of the the Miami Hurricanes at Florida State Seminoles at Bobby Bowden Field at Doak Campbell Stadium in Tallahassee, Fla., Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015, from Sentinel staff photographers Stephen M. Dowell and Joe Burbank. \nWhile in each of the past two seasons, the game against Florida State has come in the latter part of the year, that's not the case this time around. Miami (3-2, 0-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) has no time to dwell on what happened Saturday if it intends to salvage the season and ease some of the mounting pressure on Golden. The coach has faced increased criticism since the Hurricanes lost four of their last six games in 2013 and had just their third losing season since 1980 when they went 6-7 last year. \nNot long before the Hurricanes took the field Saturday night at Doak Campbell Stadium, Miami athletic director Blake James said his evaluation of Golden's performance will come at season's end. And what is left of that season is a gauntlet of seven straight ACC games, including six against Coastal Division rivals. \nThat stretch begins Saturday with the Hokies (3-3, 1-1), who had lost two straight and faced plenty of questions themselves before putting together a solid performance — especially on defense — in a 28-13 win over N.C. State on Friday night. \nAfter that comes a game against Atlantic Division powerhouse and fifth-ranked Clemson before the Hurricanes close their tough October with a road game against another Coastal Division foe, Duke. \nWinning the Coastal and earning a berth in the ACC Championship Game for the first time in program history have been among the Hurricanes' biggest goals all season. It's likely now those things will need to happen for Golden to keep his job. \nAn additional motivation for the Hurricanes as they prepare for the most critical portion of their schedule? The possibility of playing Florida State again, this time in Charlotte in early December for the conference title. \nSeveral players — including Kaaya and receiver Rashawn Scott — said the Hurricanes' effort Saturday night was proof they could keep pace with the vaunted Seminoles. \nNow is the time for them to prove it. \n\"We can definitely beat them. We definitely can. I told [FSU defensive coordinator Charles Kelly], 'I'm going to see you again.' I plan on seeing him again,\" Kaaya said. \"We have to take handle business first in the Coastal, we've got to handle it one week at a time, but I plan on seeing those guys again. That's my plan. That's our team's plan. We just have to go out there and execute it.\" \nSaid Golden, \"There's going to be no less fight in this team. This team is going to come out ready to go when we get back on the [practice] field Tuesday. ... everybody here has already moved on and I like the pulse of the team.\" \nccabrera@tribpub.com ; On Twitter @ChristyChirinos.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:33:59.049+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
