This time, the Wildcats needed all 60 minutes of regulation, and then a ruling by the two officials, to officially learn their postseason fate in Saturday’s 2-1 win over fourth-seeded Kennebunk in the Class B South semifinals. The top-seeded Wildcats earned their eighth penalty corner of the second half, and 11th for the game, with 27.4 seconds left in regulation and the game tied 1-1, a score that had remained tied for close to 45 minutes. York head coach Barb Marois, with time winding down, brought all of her players up sans her goalie in attempt to keep the ball in. Lily Posternak fired two shots on Kennebunk goalie Liv Kudas, Alie Jones had one and junior Izzy Bretz managed to get a stick off a rebound from Posternak’s second shot and slipped it past goalie Bella Kudas for the apparent game-winning goal, sending the York players into jubilation in front of the Kennebunk goal. The game officials quickly brought Marois and Kennebunk coach Kayla Billings to midfield and said that although time had expired on the clock, the game, per rule, continued until the end of the corner. Billings argued that since the penalty corner started with time still on the clock, the play should have been called dead once time expired. “It clearly states in the rulebook that the penalty corner needs to clear the dotted circle when it is the end of the game, and there was actually time still left on the clock when they hit the ball out, so that wouldn’t be considered the end of the game,” Billings said. “I don’t know what else to say. We don’t want to finish that way and no other team would. It’s unfortunate, and there’s nothing we can do about it now. You learn from it and move on.” Marois accepted the ruling from the official, but could “absolutely” understand the disappointment from Kennebunk. “(The ruling) is up to the official, that’s their call,” Marois said. “I don’t know what they are thinking in their heads in terms of the corner. I don’t know what else I am supposed to say. I have to accept the ruling of the officials. I can understand both sides.” York (16-0) will face No. 6 Leavitt in the Class B South championship game on Tuesday at Fitzpatrick Stadium in Portland. Leavitt, which beat York in the 2012 regional title game, advanced with a 1-0 win over No. 7 Spruce Mountain in the day’s other semifinal. The two teams did not meet in the regular season. It was the third time York defeated Kennebunk (10-5-1) this season, all by 2-1 scores. Once that last corner was whistled for, Marois quickly motioned for all of her players to move up to guard the edge of the scoring circle. “We know when time is up, the corner is officially over once it goes past the dotted line,” Marois said. “So we bring everybody up to prevent the corner from actually ending. The corner is over once it clears the dotted line, so we bring up as many girls as we can to protect that line.” The Wildcats then peppered Kudas with a flurry of shots amongst heavy traffic in front of the goal. “Izzy (Bretz) got in there and deflected it in,” Posternak said. “She always works so hard to get in the right spot. She deserved to get that goal. That won us the game and now we’re moving on. She should feel really good about that goal. She deserves it.” Bretz called the moment “pretty awesome.” “It just went off my stick and went in,” she said. “The ball went to Lily, she shot it, Alie (Jones) got off another shot, Lily got it again and then it went off my stick. We knew it was now or never and that was our time. It was an amazing finish.” Marois was watching the play develop to her right and thought Posternak’s initial shot had a chance to get in. “(Kudas) made a nice save as she did quite a few times today,\" Marois said. \"We got a stick on a rebound, we got the rebound, pulled it back out and then tried another shot and we put it in.” Jones gave York a 1-0 lead just 7 minutes into the game. She gained possession of the ball at the top of the scoring circle, stickhandled the ball through the middle and beat Kudas to the far left corner. “It was a very intense game, definitely the most intense game we’ve played this season,” Jones said. “It could’ve gone either way. It was a team effort. It was amazing to end it like that.” Kennebunk’s Britney Gregoire tied the game at 1-1 with 15:45 left in the first half, poking home a rebound off a scrum in front of the York cage and beating goalie Julianna Kiklis.
