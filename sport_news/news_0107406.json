Soriano lasts just one inning but wins game with a hit in the bottom of the eighth. Jose Soriano’s plans to prepare for South Bronx’s PSAL B semifinal game took a turn for the worst on Friday when he was jumped en route to his regular pitching session.\nPurple fist-sized bruises on his back and a sore throwing shoulder, which popped out of the socket during the attack, prevented Soriano from pitching past the first inning on Sunday after head coach Frank Colon received permission from Soriano’s mother to send him to the mound at 11 p.m. Saturday night.\nBut Soriano, understanding his leadership role on top-seeded South Bronx, never came out of the extra-inning game after being pulled from the mound. He eventually fought through the pain to connect on a soft blooper to left field that drove in the game-winning run in the bottom of the eighth inning of the Phoenix’s 9-8 victory over Washington Irving.\nUndefeated South Bronx will in Friday’s PSAL B title game at MCU Park in Coney Island against Queens Vocational, which beat East NY Transit Tech, 4-2, in Sunday’s other semifinal.\n“I just have to give it up to my teammates who went out on the mound and did they’re job,” said Soriano, who struck out twice, grounded out and walked before his game-winning hit. “I felt horrible, but with this ‘W’ I feel like God.\"\nThe team’s motivation to finish the season 21-0 extends past their on-field accomplishments. Seniors Danauris Baez and Kevin Victoriano — who each scored on Sunday — continue to carry a chip on their shoulder after South Bronx was demoted to the PSAL’s ‘B’ division after losing a significant amount of talent when Mott Haven Village Prep and South Bronx split before the season.\n“Our aim is to go all the way,” Colon said. “For (Baez and Victoriano), there would be nothing more satisfying then going all the way.”\nWashington Irving jumped out to a 5-3 lead, due in part to a four-run second inning, before South Bronx tied the score in the bottom of the second.\nDown one run entering the top of the sixth, Washington Irving kept hope alive, tying the score, 8-8, on Ruben Lopez’s two-out single down the third base line.\nAfter a scoreless seventh, Matt Guzman got on base in the bottom of the eighth on an error on the shortstop and advanced to third base on two wild pitches.\nThen Soriano stepped to the plate and relieved his pain with one swing.\n“It’s amazing because I was hitless throughout the entire day,” Soriano said. “I just wanted to put the ball in the air and luckily I got a hit.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:50:44.528+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
