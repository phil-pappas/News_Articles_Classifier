The improved service will roll out in parts of Toronto and in surrounding cities in the next three months.\nRogers did not provide a dollar figure for its investments, but telecom rival BCE Inc said in June it was spending more than C$1 billion ($763 million) on its own gigabit plan.\nRogers said it would show all 81 Blue Jays games next season in 4K, as well as 20 marquee ice hockey games starting with a January matchup between rival Montreal and Toronto teams, a smattering of movies and TV shows, and a growing catalog of Netflix original content in the new format.\nRogers and BCE share ownership of the company behind the Toronto Maple Leafs, while Rogers is entering the second year of a 12-year multibillion-dollar deal to broadcast NHL games.\nRogers said it will charge $149.99 a month for a package of its 4K TV, 4K set top box and unlimited gigabit Internet.\n4K TVs account for nearly 40 percent of sets with screens larger than 50 inches (127 cm), and offer four times the resolution of standard high-definition TVs.\n($1 = 1.3103 Canadian dollars)\n(Reporting by Alastair Sharp ; Editing by Matthew Lewis )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T02:53:58.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
