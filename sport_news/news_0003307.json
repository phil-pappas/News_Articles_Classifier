(AP ... more Spurs sign former Conference USA Defensive Player of the Year 1 / 4 Back to Gallery After a wave of cuts Wednesday which included fan-favorite Jimmer Fredette, the Spurs added a new name to the roster: former UTEP forward Julian Washburn.\nA four-year starter for the Miners, the 6-foot-8 forward out of Duncanville is UTEP's all-time leader in minutes and was named Conference USA's Defensive Player of the Year for his play during the 2014-2015 season.\nHe was also named to the C-USA All-Defensive team three of his four years at UTEP.\nThis brings the current Spurs roster to 17, two above the regular season max, but don't expect Washburn to stick around San Antonio for long, if at all.\nThe Spurs can retain the D-League rights to four of their training camp cuts.\nBy signing Washburn now, the Spurs can send him directly to Austin as long as he agrees to a D-League contract, which seems to be the case here.\nWashburn is expected to be waived tomorrow and handed a ticket to Austin.\nThe 23-year-old will still be a Spur, he'll just be an Austin Spur.\nJeff McDonald contributed to this report.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRMoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/76/8834966/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/76/8834968/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/76/8834967/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/76/8834969/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/76/8834968/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/76/8834969/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/76/8834967/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/54/76/8834966/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:25:52.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
