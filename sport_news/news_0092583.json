The 6-2, 185-pound junior plays safety on defense, wide receiver on offense and contributes on special teams. There's little more special than a blocked punt and Clay has smothered two of them this season. The first came Sept. 12 in the first quarter against Marion and after Clay's block, Jason Kelly's return put the Streaks ahead 6-0 in a game they eventually lost 26-24. The second came last Friday in the second quarter of the Streaks 21-0 victory and gave GHS the ball deep in Alleman territory but they failed to capitalize on the big play. Clay's says there's nothing special about his knack for blocking punts. \"Coach Wash (assistant Mich Washabaugh) sets it up. We practice it and it's easy to do,\" said Clay. \"He always tells us, when you get past the line, put your arms out and lean in. It always works. \"You've just got to do what coaches teach you to do.\" Obviously, it doesn't work every time but Clay's abilities also have something to do with his success. 'He's got real good explosiveness,\" said GHS coach Tim Dougherty. As a receiver he's grabbed 11 passes for 115 yards. At safety, he has 29 tackles - 15 of them solos - and a fumble recovery. \"He's only going to get better offensively,\" said Dougherty. \"Defensively, he's been a big part of our success. \"We lost somebody like Ben (Holloway) to graduation, and Caleb steps right in.\" Clay doesn't care where he plays. \"I just like to be out on the field,\" he says. And that's where he'll stay - somewhere. \"Before we had only one or two guys we could move around,\" said Dougherty. \"Now we feel we've got four or five guys.\" He added, \"The key is guys like Caleb are so versatile. It allows us to do more things with more players.\" Hopefully, that will make things difficult for the Rock Island Rocks on Friday. \"I look for them to give us a good game,\" said Clay. \"They're going to be ready, but we're not ready to give it up.\" Notes N Galesburg's DeAndre Moren ranks as the No. 2 rusher in the WB6 with 776 yards. United Township's Dakari Mars has rushed for 1,119. N Moren leads the Streaks in tackles with 46, 22 of them solos. Mike Velazquez has 37 tackles (19 solos) and Nick Miyler 37 (25 solos). Miyler also had three interceptions for the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:15:50.847+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
