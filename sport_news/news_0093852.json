Phillip, AP LEADING OFF: Blue Jays try to bounce back in ALCS, NLCS idle 1  /  4 Back to Gallery A look at what's happening around the major leagues today:\n___\nCANADIAN CLUBBING\nToronto tries to draw closer in the AL Championship Series , facing an 0-2 deficit vs. the visiting Royals. Johnny Cueto starts for Kansas City against Marcus Stroman at 8:07 p.m. EDT in a matchup of pitchers who last threw in Game 5 of the Division Series. The Blue Jays were the top-slugging team in the majors this season, but didn't hit a single home run in their two losses at KC. They're hoping that the ball will fly with the roof closed at Rogers Centre .\nTAKE IT EASY\nThe Mets and Cubs get a day off before playing Game 3 of the NL Championship Series at Wrigley Field. Chicago trails 0-2 and starts Kyle Hendricks â€” he made his postseason debut in the division round vs. St. Louis and gave up three solo home runs in 4 2-3 innings. Jacob deGrom starts for the Mets after going 2-0 with a 1.38 ERA against the Dodgers in the NLDS, striking out 20 in 13 innings.\nHEAR THIS\nAlex Rodriguez is going to the World Series. Naw, not with the Yankees , they're out. A-Rod has been hired by Fox as a guest analyst for the remainder of the ALCS and the World Series. He'll join pregame and postgame shows that include Pete Rose , Frank Thomas and Raul Ibanez .\nA ROYAL ROLL\nKansas City will go for its 10th straight win in the ALCS, a streak that dates to its 1985 matchup against Toronto. The reigning AL champion Royals can match the record for consecutive ALCS victories set by Baltimore in the 1960s and '70s.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:44:42.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
