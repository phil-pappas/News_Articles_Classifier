Addressing a large gathering at Samukhiamore ground of Banka district, he called the event a “railla” (a symbol of victory). The PM urged Naxals and Maoists to contribute to the development of the state by joining the mainstream. He urged them to choose ballet over bullet. “Violence is no solution to any problem. So, choose ballet over bullet,” he said. Katoria and Belhar blocks of Banka district are widely affected by Naxals and Maoists. Modi elaborated on various Centre-sponsored schemes, including housing for the poor, PM Mudra scheme, 24-hour power supply through the year etc. He also dwelled on the Rs 1.65 lakh crore package announced for the state recently. Targeting the Bihar Chief Minister, he said: “Nitish Kumar is arrogant and he may return the Central package, saying the state doesn’t need it. He had done it in the past by returning a Rs 5-crore cheque sent by the Gujarat Government to Bihar after the Kosi disaster. The Centre has opened its coffers for the development of the state as it is committed to it, but it will be given after the formation of a stable government in the state. Without the development of Bihar, India cannot develop.” “In Banka, caste politics dominates; Naxalism needs to be tackled with an iron hand; and sand lifting from rivers must be checked to improve irrigation, if the state government wants to ensure development here. Its economy is based on agriculture, but a lot needs to be done to improve irrigation facilities here. The migration rate is high as the youth leave their homes in search of jobs and livelihood elsewhere,” he said. Modi urged people to vote for development saying they had already voted for “arrogance, separatism, capitalism and feudalism”. Now the turn of “viksaswad” has come, so vote for development after comparing with adjoining Jharkhand that has been developing fast as per a survey report of the World Bank. In a survey for business and industry destinations, the World Bank once ranked Bihar 29th and Jharkhand 27th. Now, the BJP-ruled Jharkhand was ranked number 3, while there was no improvement in Bihar’s ranking, he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:11:56.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
