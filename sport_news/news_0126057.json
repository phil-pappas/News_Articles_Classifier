He earned every yard against a tenacious Knights' defense spearheaded by linebacker Jack McGowan. \n\"It was a funky day and a very quiet funky atmosphere here. We did some good things offensively, but we also shot ourselves in the foot. We knew they'd be tough because last week they gave Xaverian a hard time and (Xaverian) could only score one touchdown on offense.\" \nCatholic Memorial returned the opening kickoff the the Prep's 41-yard line and drove to the 26 before sophomore quarterback Brant Keough's fourth down pass was batted away by Jacob Yish near the goal line. \nAll game the Eagles' defense bent but didn't break. After Alex Cormier recovered a fumble at his own 38-yard line, it took only three plays for the Eagles to get on the scoreboard. Preston got loose on a 55-yard run up the right sideline in the opening seconds of the second quarter. Pat McTiernan's extra point kick was blocked and picked up by Khalil Walker-Eldridge of the Knights, who went all the way for two points. \n\"Two years in a row now the only point after we missed has been blocked by CM,\" said St. Pierre. \"They've got speed off the edge and we were back at the line of scrimmage, so we had no chance to catch him.\" \nUp by four points, the Eagles added another touchdown late in the second quarter. Their eight-play, 69-yard drive was capped by senior Jack Lambert, who bulled his way into the end zone from four yards out. The key play to that drive was a 27-yard QB keeper by Ollie Eberth. \nThe SJP defense dug in to stop CM (2-3) on its next possession but the ensuing punt took a good bounce for the Knights, rolling to the Prep-3 yard line. The Eagles were unable to move the ball and had to punt from their own end zone, setting up the Knights at the Prep 16 with time running out in the half. Five plays later Catholic Memorial captain Peter Scibilia crashed into the end zone from a yard out, but the two-point conversion failed and it was 13-8 Prep. \nPreston scored from a yard out on the first drive of the third quarter; the play was set up by an Eberth-to-Rockett 32-yard pass play. \nThe St. John's defense kept CM off the board the rest of the way as Nathaniel Vance and sophomore Mike Yarin had interceptions while Lambert and Cormier did a great job on the pass rush, resulting in quarterback sacks for big losses. \n\"It's good to get a couple of interceptions (Yish had another that was called back because of a penalty),\" said St. Pierre. \"We covered well, our linebackers did a good job, and our D-line was the key. Our defense shows up every week, and if we can get our offense going we'll be in business. \n\"The challenges only get greater, with B.C. High up next. That's a big, physical, well-coached team. Catholic Conference games are very physical; you line up and bang. We can spread out or get physical, but the one thing we need to do is get back the consistency we showed earlier (in the season). That's been missing the last couple of weeks.\" Sign Up / Sign In  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:18:57.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
