Now that the series opener is tucked away all cozy and stuff, let's have a look at the key takeaways ... \n1. Daniel Murphy hit another unlikely postseason homer. \nFor his career Daniel Murphy has hit just 12 of his 62 homers against left-handers. During the 2015 regular season, he hit only one homer against a lefty -- a solo shot off Jake McGee back in early August. In the NLDS, he homered twice off Clayton Kershaw , and in Game 1 of the NLCS on Saturday night he went deep against Jon Lester . There's homering off lefties, and then there's homering off Kershaw and Lester. On that front, Lester during the regular season allowed just four home runs to lefties in 189 batters faced.\n2. David Wright stole his first base since April. \nRegarding Wright's swipe of second base in the fourth inning of Game 1, there's this … \nBefore that one, David Wright's last stolen base was on April 14—the play when he hurt his hamstring and later was diagnosed with back woes.\n— Joe Lemire (@LemireJoe) October 18, 2015 Those back woes -- spinal stenosis, to be specific -- sidelined Wright until Aug. 24. Wright's been fairly productive since returning from injury, but the steal maybe suggests a physical confidence that hasn't been with him for some time. That's a good thing. Of course, that's also what happens when Lester is tasked with holding you on at first.\n3. Kyle Schwarber made a bit of Cubs history. \nIn the eighth inning, the Cubs' rookie left fielder connected for a home run that StatCast estimated to travel a whopping 459 feet ... \nYour browser does not support iframes. \nThat's the third straight playoff game in which Schwarber has homered, and that brings us to this ... \nSchwarber has homered in 3 straight post season games. Ties Cubs record with Alex Gonzalez Oct 5-8 in 2003. @Cubs \n— Mark Grote (@markgrotesports) October 18, 2015 There's also this ... \nSchwarber is now tied for 1st with Aramis and Alex Gonzalez http://t.co/QpnHzEk4eK #Cubs http://t.co/8vJrK0D7nS \n— Baseball Reference (@baseball_ref) October 18, 2015 More to come from the 22-year-old Schwarber, who's now batting .471/.526/1.000 this postseason.\n4. Besides pitching well, Matt Harvey also had good velocity. \nHarvey was indeed on point against the Cubs in Game 2 ... \nOf his 97 pitches, 64 went for strikes, and Harvey also notched six ground-outs against just two fly-outs. The Cubs hit it on the screws a few times but right at fielders. For the most part, though, Harvey was in control. \nAs for his stamina and health in this, his first post-Tommy John season, the velo readings from Game 1 were just fine. Harvey's four-seamer on Saturday night registered at 95.6 mph versus a career average of 95.2 The two-seamer was also clocked at 95.6, and that's compared to a career aveage of 95.8. His 13 sliders against the Cubs averaged a hefty 90.1 mph against a career mark of 89.4. \nYes, Harvey looked good on a number of fronts. \n5. The Game 1 winner has a good chance of moving on. \nThe Mets' win in Game 1, as you would expect, gives them a big edge moving forward in this series. Historically, the team that wins Game 1 in a best-of-7 series in MLB has gone on to win that series 63.4 percent of the time. The team that wins Game 1 at home, which is what the Mets did on Saturday, has gone on to win the series 66.3 percent of the time. \n6. For what it's worth, history suggests that the Mets have a good chance of winning Game 2. \nLaying aside match-ups, the team that wins Game 1 at home in a best-of-seven has gone on to win Game 2 54.3 percent of the time. The match-up for Sunday's Game 2 at Citi Field? Jake Arrieta vs. Noah Syndergaard .\n\nMatt Harvey was in vintage form in Game 1 of the NLCS.
