The Cubs' previous record for most homers in a playoff game was five in the opener of the 1984 NL Championship Series against San Diego.\nA third straight win for Chicago on Tuesday afternoon, and the once woebegone franchise will advance to the NLCS for the first time in 12 years. The Cardinals, who led the majors with 100 wins this season, have won at least one playoff series in each of the last four years.\nJason Heyward and Stephen Piscotty homered for St. Louis, and Jhonny Peralta had a run-scoring double.\nALDS-ROYALS-ASTROS \nRoyals rally on Correa's error, beat Astros 9-6 to even ALDS\nHOUSTON (AP) - Astros shortstop Carlos Correa couldn't handle a deflected grounder that might have been a double-play ball, helping the Kansas City Royals rally for five runs in the eighth inning to beat Houston 9-6 Monday and force their playoff series to a decisive Game 5.\nCorrea homered twice, doubled, singled and drove in four runs in Game 4 of the AL Division Series. Houston took a 6-2 lead into the eighth, but a tough error charged to the 21-year-old rookie keyed the Royals' comeback to even the matchup at two games apiece.\nGame 5 will be back in Kansas City on Wednesday night.\nLate in the game, a tweet from the account of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott congratulated the Astros on advancing to the AL Championship Series.\nBut the defending AL champion Royals had other ideas.\nCHIEFS-CHARLES \nChiefs RB Charles done for season with knee injury\nKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) - Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles will miss the remainder of the season with a torn ACL in his right knee.\nThe star running back hurt his knee in the third quarter of Sunday's loss to Chicago. An MRI on Monday confirmed the tear.\nEarlier Monday, coach Andy Reid said \"the worst case is the ACL is torn. That's probably the direction it's heading.\"\nCharles was making a cut deep in Bears territory on Sunday when his right knee buckled at a gruesome angle. The four-time Pro Bowl selection needed help from a trainer and linebacker Justin Houston to get off the field, never once putting any weight on the leg.\nCharles tore the ACL in his other knee four years ago, missing most of the season.\nRAMS INJURIES \nLong week to week with knee injury; Rams unsure on Saffold\nST. LOUIS (AP) - St. Louis Rams defensive end Chris Long is week to week with a right knee injury and the team anticipates guard Rodger Saffold will miss some time with a shoulder injury.\nCoach Jeff Fisher said Monday that Long's injury is a result of hyperextension, but that ligament damage has been ruled out, so Fisher considered it good news.\nSaffold injured his right shoulder and was undergoing testing for potential labrum issues. He underwent surgery on the left shoulder in the offseason.\nThe Rams released running back Trey Watts, who returned last week after a four-week suspension. Fisher said the team intends to sign Watts to the practice squad if he clears waivers.\nVIKINGS-KENDRICKS \nVikings rookie LB Kendricks handed starting job over bye\nEDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. (AP) - While most of his Minnesota Vikings teammates got a nice long break during their bye week, rookie linebacker Eric Kendricks got a promotion.\nThe Vikings decided to trade starting middle linebacker Gerald Hodges to San Francisco last week for a backup offensive lineman and a late-round draft pick. The move opened a spot for Kendricks, a second-round draft pick out of UCLA.\nCoach Mike Zimmer says Kendricks has been playing like a starter for several weeks.\nKendricks says he doesn't see the move as a vote of confidence. He spent extra time over the bye week making sure he was prepared for the increased responsibility.\nThe Vikings host the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday.\nT25-OKLAHOMA RECOVERY \nOklahoma's road back after Texas loss starts at Kansas State\nNORMAN, Okla. (AP) - Despite Oklahoma fans' shock and disappointment following last Saturday's 24-17 loss to rival Texas, their Sooners are in virtually the same position they were in before the game.\nOklahoma (4-1, 1-1 Big 12) still has No. 2 Baylor, No. 3 TCU and unbeaten No. 16 Oklahoma State on the schedule - excellent chances to leap right back into the playoff picture. The Sooners still have big-time goals, and they are using Ohio State's example from last season as a rallying cry. The Buckeyes lost at home to Virginia Tech early and rallied to win the national title.\nTraditionally, Oklahoma bounces back well. The 19th-ranked Sooners haven't lost back-to-back regular-season games since 1999, a span of 34 games. They'll face a Kansas State squad that lost 52-45 to TCU last Saturday.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
