Williams (concussion) and receiver Will Carter (disciplinary action), but still managed to take a 7-0 lead on a 44-yard TD pass from R.J. Nitti to Alan Butler on the team's second possession. \nThat score came with 4:59 left in the first quarter and would be the last time Bucknell visited the end zone all day. \n\"A lot of people didn't think we had that type of team in us,\" Lehigh coach Andy Coen said. \"We were physical on both sides of the ball. The defensive guys stepped up and were tremendous today. They made some huge red zone stops, forcing them to a field goal one time and they missed a field goal the other time.\" TIM GEER / LEHIGH SPORTS INFORMATION Lehigh's Nick Shafnisky makes a 39-yard TD run by in the first quarter in their game against Bucknell Saturday afternoon. Lehigh's Nick Shafnisky makes a 39-yard TD run by in the first quarter in their game against Bucknell Saturday afternoon. (TIM GEER / LEHIGH SPORTS INFORMATION) \nThe 10 points allowed was the fewest points surrendered by the Mountain Hawks since a 24-10 win over Columbia in 2013. \nThe Mountain Hawks registered four sacks and had seven total stops for losses. Pierce Ripanti had eight tackles, Central Catholic grad Noah Robb had seven takedowns and two other Lehigh Valley products — senior Matt Laub (Parkland) and freshman Jake Buskirk (Whitehall) — had three stops apiece, including one each for losses. \nThe defense had to deliver to bail out an offense that was productive a good portion of the day, but destructive at other points. \nJunior quarterback Nick Shafnisky was at his best in leading Lehigh on consecutive scoring drives in the first half, both of which ended with him running for touchdowns. The first one was a 39-yard dandy that marked the longest run of the Whitehall graduate's career. \nBut there was also an interception in the second quarter that not only killed a Lehigh scoring threat but also set up a Bucknell opportunity when it was returned 51 yards by Colin Jonov to the Lehigh 35. \nThe Mountain Hawks gave up one first down before stifling the Bucknell drive and John Burdick was wide right with a 30-yard field goal attempt. \n\"The guys kept picking each other up which was really great to see,\" Coen said. \nThe defense came through again after Bucknell had a second-and-goal at the Lehigh 1 in the third quarter. The Mountain Hawks came up with two straight stops and even though Burdick made a 20-yard field goal, Lehigh still led 14-10. \nShafnisky was 6-for-9 passing for 56 yards on what would prove to be the game-clinching drive, a 14-play, 71-yard beauty that ended with him hitting Drew Paulsen for a 16-yard score. \nPaulsen entered the game with just two catches. \n\"If you look at our offense, we're not one-dimensional at all,\" said Shafnisky, who ran for 68 yards and passed for 203. \"With us, you have to worry about five or six different receivers, you have to worry about [Dom] Bragalone, you have to worry about Nana [Amankwah-Ayeh], you have to worry about Micco [Brisker] when he comes back. We're just a tough offense to stop once we get rolling.\" \nLehigh stopped itself when Bragalone, the former South Williamsport High star playing in his old backyard, fumbled after an 18-yard run early in the fourth quarter. \nBucknell took over at the Lehigh 46, but again the defense rose up and made sure the turnover didn't hurt. \nBragalone, came back strong with several tough runs on a 17-play drive that didn't result in points, but chewed up more than half of the final quarter — eight minutes and 35 seconds. \n\"I had most of my high school football team here and so many of my friends,\" said Bragalone, a freshman who finished with a game-high 107 yards rushing on 18 carries. \"It was a great feeling. We knew we were going against a great defense today, one of the best in the nation. We just worked hard. Everybody did their job, we executed and came away with a great win.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:23:46.186+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
