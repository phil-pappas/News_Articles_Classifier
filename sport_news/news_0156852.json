He’s someone who was with us last season as well and we were looking forward to having him as an integral part of the team. We wish him all the very best and hope he recovers soon,” Mumbai City FC CEO Indranil Das Blah said in a release. Saran, who joined Salgaocar FC last year, will look to make a mark at Mumbai City FC from the word go. He has also scored the winner for Salgaocar FC in 2014 Durand Cup final. Before Salgaocar FC, he achieved a lot of success playing for Churchill Brothers, winning the I-League — twice, IFA Shield — once, Durand Cup — twice and Federation Cup — once. The 2nd edition of the ISL begins on Saturday in Chennai. Mumbai will play their first match against FC Pune City at the Shree Shiv Chhatrapati Sports Complex Stadium, Pune on Monday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:21:18.095+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
