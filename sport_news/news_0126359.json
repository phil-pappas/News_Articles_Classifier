Staff photo by Kathryn Ingall slideshow When Sequoyah lost to Creekview last week in the Region 7 softball tournament, the Lady Chiefs’ season ended, and with it, the 38-year coaching career of Todd Morrissey.Morrissey still has a passion for the game, but somewhere along the line this season, he realized it was time for him to call it quits.“I still enjoy coaching, but you shouldn’t have to take two Goody’s headache powders and drink a Mountain Dew just to go out there and hit ground balls,” the 61-year-old said. “I’m just going to do what anybody would do in retirement — sit back, take it one day at a time, and see what comes.”Morrissey will certainly be missed on the field, where he went 206-91 after arriving at Sequoyah in 1993. He sent 27 players on to play in college and won a state championship in 2006.“Coach Morrissey will be difficult to replace,” Sequoyah athletic director Mark Merges said. “He is large in stature and heart. His stats speak to the caliber of coach that he is. He builds positive relationships with all stakeholders and will be missed on and off the field.”While Morrissey’s on-field success will certainly be difficult to replace, those close to the program say his demeanor and approach to building relationships with his players are what will be missed the most.“Coach Morrissey is so much more than softball at Sequoyah,” said Jamie Gianfala, a parent who has been involved with the Lady Chiefs’ program for more than 10 years. “It’s different with coach Morrissey, because he really gets in these kids’ lives. It’s more than softball with him. It’s more than a teacher relationship. He becomes like a father figure to these kids.”One of those players that formed a special bond with Morrissey was Gianfala’s daughter, Madison, who recently began her freshman year at Georgia State.“He came out to Georgia State to watch me play in my first game,” she said. “He told me he was coming, and I believed him at the time, but when I looked up and actually saw him there in the stands, I just felt so much better.”Sequoyah was not the first place where Morrissey found success. He coached at California’s Clovis High School for 16 years, winning a championship in 1994, but his best memories came from his time at Sequoyah.“My favorite memory has to be from the state championship in 2006,” said Morrissey, who also assisted with the Chiefs’ baseball team in his time at Sequoyah. “We lost the first game of the double-elimination tournament, had to win five games to get to the finals and had to beat the team that beat us twice to win the championship. My daughter, Nicole, scored the winning run of the first game of the finals. It makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up just talking about it, like it happened yesterday.”While Morrissey’s presence will be missed, his influence will remain. Etowah coach Victoria Brown played for Morrissey from 2003-07 and coached under him for two years before taking the job with the Lady Eagles.“He’s this big muscular guy who is one of the softest, gentlest men you’ll ever meet,” Brown said. “At the banquet after we won the state championship, we made a life-size box of tissues to give to him, because we knew he was going to cry. “Being able to interact in such a positive manner is something the girls cherish, and I know I cherish and try to duplicate with my team.”Morrissey will also be remembered fondly by Creekview’s Chance Cain. He knew Morrissey as more than a rival, having coached with him from 2002-08 before moving to Creekview in 2009, where he was an assistant for two years before becoming the head coach. “He’s done a great job during his time in Cherokee County,” Cain said of Morrissey. “He was a great guy and a good motivator. We’re going to miss competing against him. He was a great coach, and he’s definitely going to be missed.”As for the future of the Sequoyah softball program, Morrissey does not know what will happen next, but he hopes he set a good example for the next coach to follow.“It’s more than just softball,” Morrissey said. “Very few get to play or coach the game professionally, so you have to take something else with you. It’s about the friendships and relationships you build. I’m sure the next head coach will be someone who understands that and has the same dedication I had.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:23:04.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
