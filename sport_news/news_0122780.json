You move on. One game doesn’t define you, and you keep fighting. I mean, last year we were 3-3 or something at this point in the season and things turned around. I think we can do it again.”\nSherman also said that he thinks the way the team played for three quarters shows that the Seahawks are close to being the defense they were last season.\nMost Read Stories Outraged Seattle Public Schools parents, pace yourselves Seattle Seahawks release WR B.J.

That game we didn’t get the bounces, the Rams game we didn’t get the bounces. The years before we got the bounces, we didn’t get them this year. We’ve got to see how the season goes from here on, maybe things will change.”\nHere are a few more comments from Sherman today:\n(On if it is more fun to follow a receiver around the field as he did with A.J. Green Sunday than to play on only one side of the field:) “Not really. I mean it’s the same pretty much. I don’t find too much like it’s more fun. It didn’t change much of the game for me. I guess you do a lot more running to jog to the other side of the field and jog back to the other side of the field. But other than that it’s not much different for me.”\n(On how much he has practiced playing not at left corner:) “I haven’t practiced it. I haven’t practiced at right [corner] very much in four years. But when they ask me to do it I just go out there and do it to the best of my ability. I think it’s just something that you have to be mentally prepared for more than anything. It’s kind of like a left tackle playing left tackle his whole career and then moving to right tackle mid-game. It’s just different footwork, different mental gymnastics, but at the end of the day you do your job effectively and it will all turn out well.”\n(On if he can put his finger on any reasons the team has given up fourth quarter leads:) “No, not really. They just made great plays. They made great plays when they needed to make them. It’s nothing that you can put your finger on. At the end of the day, it was just one of those games. Sometimes you get the bounces, and sometimes you don’t, and we didn’t get the bounces at the end.”\n(On saying it was unacceptable to lose the lead last week in his own blog post:) “I mean you should win a game you’re up 17 [points]. Unfortunately, we did not. Anytime that happens, you’ve got to blame yourself. You can’t point at anybody but yourself at the end of the day, and that’s what I was doing.”\n \nBob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bobcondotta .
