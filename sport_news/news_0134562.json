Three decades before he was hired to raise the dead in Toronto, at a salary of $120,192 a week, Mike Babcock worked summers on the killing floor of Intercontinental Packers in Saskatoon for 12 bucks an hour. He was never an actual cow knocker; the worker beside him killed the animals. Babcock was the noses-hooves-horns man. Seven weeks ago, in a 46th-floor hotel lounge a few blocks west of the Air Canada Centre, he jumped to his feet to pantomime the process. “The nail goes into the brain— boom! —the guy shackles it, hangs it up,” Babcock said. “Bull gets whacked, then it comes to you, and you’re skinning the nose, hooves and horn before it goes to the next guy. Blood’s squirting all over.” He reclaimed his chair. “Also worked on the pig pack. They’re already slaughtered and cooled off, and they come to you, almost frozen, and you trim the excess. Jowl mountain.” There is Summer Mike and Winter Mike, his wife, Rene, likes to say, but his passion does not change like the seasons. Words tumble out, elbows up, jostling. One Babcock staple is “fantastic,” and here he taps the brakes, drawing out the first syllable with a flat a . Another is “hard,” and he hits the r like a cartoon pirate. During an expansive answer he might refer to himself in the third person, the way Elmo does on Sesame Street , but there is no scrollwork in his man’s-man speech. Babcock went shirtless under his slaughterhouse slicker. In that Toronto hotel, gazing out on tacking sailboats on Lake Ontario, he wore a blue-and-white Maple Leafs golf shirt. From abattoir to the Leafs ... the jokes just write themselves. In the carnivorous NHL, the Maple Leafs have been offal. Toronto has made the playoffs just once since the 2004–05 lockout—in ’13 it blew a 4–1 third-period lead and lost Game 7 to Boston in overtime—and is a 100‑to‑1 shot to win the 2016 Stanley Cup, according to the Westgate Superbook. After Randy Carlyle was fired last January, the team took a knee under interim coach Peter Horachek, finishing 9-28-5. Sixty-eight points was the franchise’s lowest total in a non-lockout season in almost two decades. But the shabby performance of the thick-wallet organization, the only hockey team listed among Forbes ’s 50 most valuable sports franchises, is better filtered through the membrane of history. Toronto has won 13 Cups, second only to Montreal’s 24, but none since 1967, nine months after color television was introduced in Canada. Since the ’67 expansion, Toronto players have won a major regular season award—Hart, Art Ross, Norris, Vezina, Rocket Richard, Selke, Calder—just once. Despite employing men of hockey pedigree—president Ken Dryden (six Stanley Cups), general manager Brian Burke (2007 Cup), and coaches Pat Quinn (’02 Olympic gold medal), Ron Wilson (’96 World Cup) and Carlyle (’07 Cup)—no one has found a cure for what Burke calls blue-and-white disease, the complacency that infects some players in the nexus of the sport. Toronto is home to NHL hockey operations, television networks that are financial struts for the league (Sportsnet is entering the second year of its 12-year, CA$5.2 billion contract) and 566 youth teams in the Greater Toronto Hockey League, but the heritage franchise has been a punching bag when it hasn’t been a punch line.

I think Mike is built for Toronto. You need to have that skin, you need to have that chin.”\nTheoretically, this is the perfect marriage. After last season Babcock was a free agent with a gilt-edged résumé—10 straight playoff appearances with Detroit, a Stanley Cup (in 2008 with the Red Wings ), two losses in seven-game finals (’03 with Anaheim, ’09 with Detroit) and Olympic gold with Team Canada in ’10 and ’14. Toronto was seeking a credible coach. After turning down a five-year, $20 million extension from Detroit and an offer by potential-rich Buffalo that essentially mirrored the one from Toronto, he cashed the golden ticket—$50 million over eight years. Six-point-two-five average. First-line money, and more than double the salary of Joel Quenneville, whose Blackhawks have won three Cups in six years. Says Red Wings GM Ken Holland, “Babs won the lottery.”\nWhy Toronto? Consider a theory. You know how the NHL suspends a player for one game in the playoffs for an offense that would have cost him two during the year because of the postseason’s relative importance? Well, there’s also Stanley Cup math. One Cup in Toronto would be exponentially greater than two or three elsewhere (e.g., 1994 New York Rangers 54-year drought). So an ambitious coach in Toronto gets a two-for-one deal: Win a Cup, get a statue. “I couldn’t see leaving Detroit for someplace other than an Original Six team, but I wanted to try something new,” Babcock says. “The hockey market, let’s be honest, it’s been a coach’s graveyard. Why would I be naive enough to think I could be different? I guess I just am. [We have to] be patient. Get good things going. Not deviate from the plan. Set ourselves up for a 10-year run. It’s probably going to take us three years to get that run set up.” When Babcock was introduced on May 20 in a press conference televised across Canada, he memorably cautioned, “If you think there’s no pain coming ... there’s pain coming.”\nNow there’s a slogan. If coaching doesn’t work out, Babcock could try the marketing department—although presumably Toronto is as stacked there as it is everywhere else off the ice. The Maple Leafs list 48 hockey operations people on their organizational chart, 32 more than Florida. They employ a skating development consultant and a director of sports science and performance. Toronto has four algorithm all-stars dedicated to analytics. (The Leafs circa 1950, per owner Conn Smythe: “If you can’t beat ’em in the alley, you can’t beat ’em on the ice.” The Leafs circa 2015, per statistically inclined assistant GM Kyle Dubas: We’ll decimal point you to death.)\nNHL Phil Kessel gets the fresh start of a lifetime with Sidney Crosby, Penguins by Jeremy Fuchs", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/MichaelFarber3"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:20:58.839+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
