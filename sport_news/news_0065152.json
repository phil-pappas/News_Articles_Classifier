Mauney wrapped up his second Professional Bull Riders World Finals championship in two years and also won his second finals round Saturday night. \nMauney, from Mooresville, North Carolina, headed into the fourth round in good position to take the season title. Brazilians Joao Ricardo Vieira and Kaique Pacheco had to be within 1,400 points of Mauney and still be in contention for the finals event average title heading into the finale Sunday. \nMauney won the round shortly after claiming the title, finising with a 92.75-point ride on Bruiser. \nPacheco, the leader in the PBR rookie standings, moved into second place by scoring an 88 on Cowboy Phil during his re-ride after scoring 78.75 on Stuntin Like My Daddy. \nPacheco needed to score at least 88.5 in order to stay in contention for the world crown, so Mauney actually claimed his crown two rides before he won on Bruiser.
