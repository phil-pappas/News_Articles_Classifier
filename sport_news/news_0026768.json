And I must say, it was worth the wait. For those unaware, Pro-Am was completely broken when 2K16 launched on September 25. Players were unable to join a game and try out the mode. In addition, players on the east and west coast could not join each other's games. Operation Sports knocked the game's final review score down a notch due to the issue. Pro-Am is the true 5-on-5 basketball simulation experience. It's not just NBA 2K , it's a virtual game of legitimate hoops. Defense is key as a simple breakdown will lead to an easy score for the opposing team. Mistakes quickly add up if you're not paying attention, so keep your eyes on the details. Your primary focus needs to be on your assignment, only paying total attention to the ball when it's right next to you. Wandering eyes lead to quick cuts towards the hoop. Offense is going to be a work in progress for each team as running sets and motion will come with practice and time. It'd be nice if you could call/run a 2K play where the directions would appear for each player, but in Pro-Am, that's not the case. Communication becomes key, and reputations will help teach you each player's tendencies (assuming you stick with the same core team). Team building should be well thought out. Running on a team with a 6-foot-7 forward at the five spot is problematic for obvious reasons. My team (which featured Steve, Chase, ExtremeGamer and Millennium -- all-stars I say!) ended up swapping out one of our highest-rated players to bring in his 57 overall power forward. He ended up \"towering\" over the rest of us at 6-foot-11. A few other items to points out, When our team needed a fifth, we were given 70-rated point each time. The CPU player was not awful, but it's a definite advantage for the opposing squad. Also, if a player fouls out he will be replaced by a CPU player. After playing four games, I'm itching to get back to more. It's truly practice makes perfect. If the Pro-Am mode was hypothetically in its second year and had failed to work at launch like it did this year, the uproar from the community would have been unbelievable -- it has that much potential. If you thought juggling the depth and modes in NBA 2K16 was already a challenge, well sorry but things just got even tougher to manage.

Every time. Sent from my iPhone using Tapatalk # 2 barond57 @ 10/14/15 09:13 AM The cpu we had were rated in the 50s and wouldn't guard his guy even after hitting 4 straight 3 pointers. I'm on Xbox one so hopefully the patch will fix this # 3 jgarrett @ 10/14/15 09:17 AM I tried for over 2 hours to join a game last night and couldn't get past 8 players in the waiting room. Very frustrating! # 4 iam31yearsold @ 10/14/15 09:17 AM Yea, I'm on East Coast and around 9pm it was no problem getting into a WalkOn game. Making an 'Interior Defender' PF finally has meaning. Even if people don't pass to me, I live on the boards. Setting off ball picks so good random dudes are messaging me on how sick a PICK was. Just properly spacing the floor for a 98ovr guy in an ISO gives me joy. A+ teammate grade all day. Love it. Make me have a reason to play MyPlayer. Still skipping all cut scenes though.

I play Center, we were down 1 with 23secs to go. Told the squad GIVE ME THE BALL at 10 secs and let me work! Got the ball, ready to hit my fader and it got blocked (shoulda passed out the double team)!! i was sick! then the other team tried throwing a full court pass and it went out of bounds (shoulda called timeout!). we call 2 timeouts back to back to get our inbound play together. i set a mean pick for our PG he came around the screen for the open mid range and hit the game winning shot! i havent felt that much excitment in a sports videogame ever. you couldnt tell us we didnt just win game 7 LMAO! Thanks 2k for getting it fixed, absolutely LOVE this mode. MY ONLY knock is we cant pick a team we'd like to play. say if if theres another team of we cant just set it up and play. Man, this mode is ridiculously fun. I love that there's legitimate defense in the mode...it forces guys to give up the ball... Got into 4 walk on games with my longest wait being 3 minutes. Now all I need is a squad! # 7 downsouth @ 10/14/15 09:45 AM Still wish it gave rep. I dont understand why not.

What position you play? Looking for a PF or another Center to run with 4 others I have. # 9 ItsJustaGame @ 10/14/15 10:03 AM Pro-Am finally works.. and it's pretty awesome.. It would a million times better though if there were team rosters. But still.. I don't know if it's too soon to nitpick, but the leaderboards are still screwed up, the 5 players's names and stats in the matchmaking queue do not show up, nor do the team records, ranks, and win percentages. The patch was huge though.. It definitely saved this game mode, and for me, this game. I hope 2K keeps improving and expanding the mode because it has the potential to be the best thing frickin thing 2k has ever done (in my book) # 10 sschevyridah @ 10/14/15 10:06 AM Quote: Originally Posted by jgarrett I tried for over 2 hours to join a game last night and couldn't get past 8 players in the waiting room. Very frustrating! Are you looking for a squad? Really looking for a PF that plays smart on PS4. We have 4 players. 2 of the 4 are on almost every night the other 2 are on maybe every other night depending on their schedules. # 11 bo.jangles344 @ 10/14/15 10:11 AM Quote: Originally Posted by The 24th Letter Man, this mode is ridiculously fun.

Got plenty of people i run with i can plug you with. Psn: finnydot2012 # 12 FantasyGuy10 @ 10/14/15 10:13 AM I was literally so hyped for this mode. But with the exclusion of gaining any sort of rep, it's like what's the point? Who over at 2K thought this was a good decision? # 13 Shaqn0sis @ 10/14/15 10:26 AM Quote: Originally Posted by FantasyGuy10 I was literally so hyped for this mode. But with the exclusion of gaining any sort of rep, it's like what's the point? Who over at 2K thought this was a good decision? ^^^ I agree with you. They should of done it like the Rec from last years game. Gain rep for playing those longer games and getting real stats. Hopefully they consider it. I've been playing 4v4 on Sunset to make up for it. # 14 GradyMac @ 10/14/15 10:28 AM Quote: Originally Posted by FantasyGuy10 I was literally so hyped for this mode.

Strolls, clothes, some play boosts; NONE of which have anything to do with ProAm. if you want rep, play MyPark. Those rewards do nothing in ProAm; so I don't know why you want rep in ProAm. # 15 FantasyGuy10 @ 10/14/15 10:35 AM Quote: Originally Posted by GradyMac But rep is for MyPark rewards.

Because right now there is not an equivalent 5 vs. 5 court that you can play with your MyPlayer and friends for rep (i.e. Rec from last year). That is why I, and many other people want rep for Pro-Am. If they can't add rep then at least add a 5 vs. 5 Rec in MyPark. This game was so much about adding new features and new modes... but they took out one of the biggest (and most addictive) reasons that make people continue to play this game throughout it's life cycle. # 16 JayBillups36 @ 10/14/15 10:37 AM Quote: Originally Posted by GradyMac But rep is for MyPark rewards.

Exactly, it has nothing to do with Pro Am. There isn't boost cards and all that BS with pro am. That's a good thing, if you want rep , play park # 17 OG_Almighty @ 10/14/15 10:40 AM Quote: Originally Posted by FantasyGuy10 Because right now there is not an equivalent 5 vs. 5 court that you can play with your MyPlayer and friends for rep (i.e. Rec from last year).

I agree and disagree. Having rep for this mode would be convenient but it has nothing to do with the park and the accolades you get. Rep is just for bragging rights. I made Legend last year. Aside from one or two gameplay boost, you spend hours grinding just to brag, take your shirt off and activate goofy dances. The reward does not match the effort required to reach it. However, for those of us who want a more sim experience, Pro-Am is the way to go. I don't care about \"rep\" because my version of it is the leaderboard. # 18 FantasyGuy10 @ 10/14/15 10:43 AM Quote: Originally Posted by JayBillups36 Exactly, it has nothing to do with Pro Am.

They could easily have implemented it in Pro-Am. If your squad is all from the same affiliation, then you gain some sort of Rep for repping that affiliation in a Pro-Am game. It's really that simple. A simple search shows that this is a wanted thing. # 19 OG_Almighty @ 10/14/15 10:44 AM I was able to play Pro-Am last night after being locked out for 2 weeks like everyone else. For the most part, I'm extremely happy. I'm playing as a walk-on right now since my crew is more concerned with My Park right now. I was able to get into games super smooth and quick. My walk on crew went on a quick 3 game win streak to my amazement. When the game was over, some of our teammates logged out and were promptly replaced with new users quite swiftly as we waiting on the court for them. As soon as I create a crew, I can't wait to try out the custom stadiums. Pro-Am is here! P.S. Does anybody know what the game speed and difficulty for Pro-Am is set at? I play on 50 speed in My Career but Pro-Am seems significantly slower. Is this lag or nah? # 20 darius0921 @ 10/14/15 10:58 AM I need a squad on ps4.
