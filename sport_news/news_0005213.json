Poulter was counting on that event to reach the minimum 13 tournaments required to keep his European Tour membership. \nOnly tour members can play for Europe in the Ryder Cup. \nIt was too late to enter the Hong Kong Open, and all the invitations were taken. Beem offered to give his exemption to Poulter, who left Tuesday morning for Hong Kong. \nCopyright Â© 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:34:22.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
