I was very confident of winning the points I had to win.\" \nPulaski Academy swept the singles and doubles titles and rolled to the team title, earning 19 points. Hot Springs Lakeside was a distant second with six points. \nFreshman Wesley Barnett and sophomore Jake Bridges had an easy time winning the doubles title. The Bruins team won all four of their tournament matches 6-0, 6-0, including Tuesday's championship match against junior teammates Robert Cain and Jack Meghreblian. \nPulaski Academy's girls team shared the state title with Hot Springs Lakeside -- with each team scoring 13 points. The team of Abby Minton and Katie Swanson outlasted the sisters Bailey and Morgan McAlexander of Valley View in the doubles championship match, 6-4, 7-6. \nAnother pair of sisters -- Tatum and Thea Rice of Lakeside -- played for the singles title. Tatum won 6-1, 6-4, in a match that was more of a practice session than a serious contest. \n\"Next week if we play for the Overall title, then we'll both take it a little more seriously,\" Tatum Rice said. \"We'll be playing hard against each other.\" \nThe boys' singles finalists, meanwhile, provided a wholehearted effort that meant a series of long rallies and hotly contested points. \nRiser, a senior, won the first two games of Tuesday's match, but Harrison said he felt the momentum swing when he broke Riser's serve to tie the match at 2-2. \n\"I was really tight and a little nervous even though I've been there before, but I started playing a lot better,\" Harrison said. \"I started ripping my forehands and my backhands and things just started going my way.\" \nHarrison won nine consecutive games before Riser held serve midway through the second set. Harrison's long winning streak included a between-the-legs return shot that sailed cross court for a game-winner. \n\"Let's just say that was the best shot of my life,\" Harrison said. \"I'm not lying. ... It was a winner, and if you saw me I was laughing about it because I knew it was the best shot of my life.\" \nRiser managed to hold serve three times in second set and saved four match points before Harrison earned the victory. \nAll of Tuesday's finalists have qualified for next week's Overall tournament, which will be played at Burns Park Tennis Complex in North Little Rock. \nSports on 10/21/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T12:19:04.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
