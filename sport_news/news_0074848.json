The state Department of Justice instituted the line after the 1998 school shooting at Springfield's Thurston High School , but it was later eliminated in budget cuts.\nEvans cited an email forwarded to state police last month that identified an online threat made by a man who wrote that he intended to kill people at two Portland-area Christian schools.\n\"That came through on an email system that morning. By the afternoon, we identified that felon,'' Evans told lawmakers. \"The only way we got that is through an email system.''\nThe tip line is especially important, Evans said. He estimated that 81 percent of the time, someone else knew of a school shooting threat and 93 percent of the time that someone was a peer.\nCandlelight vigil held for victims of UCC shooting A candlelight vigil was held Thursday night at Stewart Park in Roseburg for the victims of the Umpqua Community College shooting earlier in the day.\nState police are seeking requests for proposals to set up the tip line, he told lawmakers from the state House and Senate Judiciary Committees.\n\"If our kids aren't safe in school, we fail,'' Evans said. \"It's our number one recommendation to the committee for school safety.''\nAt the same time, the group is looking at using a database similar to the West Virginia Safe Schools Homeland Security Network, he said. It could be downloaded for free. Officials from West Virginia are scheduled to come to Oregon this month to share information on it.\nHe also said school districts should adopt threat assessment plans similar to that used by Marion County officials.\n\"Marion County is the national model,'' Evans said, noting that it has had success defusing bullying, destructive behavior and other threats. \"There's other counties across Oregon where there's absolutely nothing,'' he said.\nOn Wednesday afternoon, Evans concluded his address to the legislative committees, \"We have to keep our kids safe. The Reynolds shooting is a stark reminder how quickly these things can unfold.\"\nHours later, 50 members of the state police force rushed to help the Douglas County Sheriff's Office and other agencies respond to a mass killing on Roseburg's Umpqua Community College campus, where a gunman killed nine and wounded seven others before dying in a shootout with police.\n--Maxine Bernstein\nmbernstein@oregonian.com\n503-221-8212; @maxoregonian", "external_links": ["https://blog.advance.net/cgi-bin/mte/%22mailto:mberstein@oregonian.com", "https://blog.advance.net/cgi-bin/mte/%22https://twitter.com/maxoregonian"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:15:10.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
