The Indians lost 41-25 after what coaches and players called a bad week of practice. ( Trevor L. Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nFORT COLLINS — Call it coach's intuition or whatever you want, but Wayne McGinn had a hunch. \nLoveland's football coach hoped his gut was wrong. That's really all he could do at that point. It was too late for anything else. \nThe Indians were on a shorter week than usual with a Thursday night game in Fort Collins and practices leading up weren't sharp. \n\"I kind of knew with that short week, I was worried about that. We just didn't have a good week of practice,\" he said. \"You kind of have that feeling, and you hope it's the wrong feeling, but it ended up being the right feeling. \n\"We didn't do a good enough job of preparing; that's coaches and players. We just didn't prepare well.\" \nLoveland's lack of focus throughout the week culminated in a rough outing in the final non-conference game of the season, traveling to Fort Collins and losing 41-25 at French Field on Thursday. \nAs you might expect with a team coming into a game less than prepared, the Indians (2-3) failed to excel in any area of the field or any phase of the game. \nSpecial teams surrendered a punt return for a touchdown, the defense was gashed for big plays through the air and on the ground and the offense was forced into third-and-long situations all night with little success. \nPractice makes perfect is a cliché embraced across sports because it's true. Loveland continues to learn that lesson the hard way. \n\"Our practices whenever we lose are really horrible, so I guess it's just the mindset in the practices that we do,\" senior running back Charles Dunkelman said. \"Our practice reflects on the field. Whenever we lose, the intensity is really low and it's like we think we have it, but when we actually do our practices almost like a game, we come out and do really well like (last week).\" Loveland running back Charles Dunkelman (5) cuts as Fort Collins defensive back Kielar Harpham breaks down for the tackle Thursday at French Field in Fort Collins. Dunkelman scored a rushing touchdown and a 45-yard interception return. ( Trevor L. Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nFort Collins (2-3) pounced on the Indians' mistakes early, housing Loveland's first punt of the game 70 yards for a touchdown from senior Kielar Harpham. A blocked punt by LHS resulted in a 6-yard TD run from Dunkelman, however, a missed extra point kept Collins in front 7-6. \nIt's the closest Loveland would get. \nFCHS scored on its following three possessions to supply the Lambkins a commanding 28-6 advantage with 7:27 remaining in the first half. Loveland seized its first game-breaking play on a 37-yard run from Dunkelman, capped off with a 2-yard scoring run from senior quarterback Ayden Eberhardt to cut the deficit at half, 28-12. \nThen it appeared the Indians used the break to their full advantage, coming out starting the second half with a bang. Dunkelman returned an interception 45 yards for a touchdown, followed by a FCHS three-and-out and 30-yard Eberhardt touchdown run to pull Loveland with three, 28-25. \nYet just as it seemed Loveland was on the comeback trail, Collins crushed the Indians' newfound spirit with a 60-yard run on third-and-14 from its own 25-yard line to put itself back in scoring position. A 16-yard touchdown pass from senior quarterback Jacob Moyer to Harpham (on third down again) bolstered the lead back up to double digits, 35-25, and the Indians faded. \n\"Yeah, it seemed like once they got that third-and-long, everything was kind of lost,\" Eberhardt said. \"But I kind of feel it was throughout the (game). I know I'm harping on practice, but that's where it goes back to; our focus. We get really up, but you can't get too up. As a team, you can't be too up or too down. You have to be in the middle because things can change just like that.\" \nOffensively, Loveland spent most of the contest in long third downs, and unsurprisingly, failed to convert many of them. Eberhardt ran 19 times for 90 yards and a touchdown, while Dunkelman had 10 totes for 60 yards and a score to go with his TD on defense. \nHowever, the Indians mustered just 235 yards of offense (164 via the run) and turned the ball over once on an interception by Harpham, which was returned to the LHS 9 and resulted in another FCHS touchdown. \nNow the Indians will enter conference play licking their wounds with the clear understanding that bad weeks of practice have to be a thing of the past. Otherwise, they could be in for a long conference slate. \n\"We can't go into practice, not necessarily messing around, but unfocused and not doing what needs to be done in the time frame we have,\" Eberhardt said. \"We can't expect to win if we do that during the week.\" \nCris Tiller: 970-669-5050 ext. 511, tillerc@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/cristiller", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:11:42.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
