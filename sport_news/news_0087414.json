Senior Corbin Rapier started.\nDavidson drove 67 yards on 16 plays on the first possession of the game for a touchdown. Ryan Royer ran for a 2-yard touchdown.\nThe drive was typical Wildcats in that they converted four third downs and kept the ball on the ground every play.\nIt was more of the same on Davidson’s second possession, a 94-yard, 15-play drive in which it converted two third downs and a fourth down.\nThe gamble on fourth-and-one at the Wildcats’ 15-yard line was what fans have come to expect from Brian White. Royer took a pitch and ran 3 yards around left end for the first down.\nLiberty turned the ball over on downs twice in the first half, the first time when it drove to Davidson’s 15-yard line. A pass from Rapier was incomplete in the end zone.\nThe Patriots had another promising drive end on downs when Rapier was tackled for a 7-yard loss by lineman Dylan Day to the 32.\nThe turnover that sealed the outcome came with 1:52 left in the third quarter when defensive back Tyler Lomphoy made a diving interception at the Liberty 12-yard line.\nThree plays later, Royer ran around right end for a 7-yard touchdown that made it 19-0.\nDay recovered a fumbled snap in the end zone with 4:17 left to play for a touchdown. \nResults Hamilton Township 34, Bloom-Carroll 0:   Patrick Robinson completed 18 of 30 passes for 398 yards and four first-half touchdowns as Hamilton Township (6-2, 4-1) rolled past host Bloom-Carroll (5-3, 3-2) in the Mid-State League Buckeye.
