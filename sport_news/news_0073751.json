He didnt say anything and he came back and practiced and tried to tough it out.”\nQuin Snyder\nSALT LAKE CITY — JP Gibson, the adorable young leukemia-crushing boy who won over hearts at last year’s Utah Jazz open scrimmage, was a well-received guest of honor.\nThe Jazz’s mascot, Bear, entertained a couple thousand fans in his wacky way.\nAnd Jazz players went through an open practice and scrimmage, giving spectators a peek into what happens behind closed doors at the Zions Bank Basketball Center.\nThere were a couple of noticeable things missing from this annual Jazz tradition — Gordon Hayward (on the court, at least) and woeful and/or humorous dancing by rookies.\nTo their relief, no doubt, rookies Trey Lyles, Raul Neto, Tibor Pleiss and Treveon Graham weren’t required to endure the traditional Rookie Dance-Off. Perhaps the team’s veterans, most of whom have participated in the awkward wigglefest, granted them leniency because the newcomers were forced to do a hula dance on stage at the team’s luau in Hawaii two weeks ago.\nMore importantly, Hayward sat on the bench during the practice session and scrimmage. The small forward was sidelined with a low back contusion, which he suffered during Monday night’s game after being fouled hard from behind by Portland guard C.J. McCollum.\n“He’s fine,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said, “ but he is sore.”\nHayward’s injury wasn’t announced earlier this week because the small forward tried to practice through the pain. The team is listing him as day-to-day.\n“He’s been the best practice player we’ve had, and he wasn’t as engaged as he’s been,” Snyder said with a tone of appreciation. “Some of that’s because he was sore. He got tackled. He didn’t say anything and he came back and practiced and tried to tough it out.”\nSnyder credited Hayward — and other Jazz players — for being gutsy in trying to practice despite having some bumps and bruises.\n“We have guys that are trying to go in practice because they know it’s important. They’re fresh and they’re not all healthy,” Snyder said. “Whether it’s next week or when we start the season, I want our team to be not just healthy but to have good legs and be fresh, and I don’t think we’re that right now.”\nPower forward Derrick Favors was also limited in his participation Friday night because of a sore back.\nAs such, Snyder decided to give his players Saturday off before the team’s fifth preseason game Sunday night at Portland. Utah has had a bit of an odd practice schedule this fall because of the exhausting Hawaii trip.\n“It’s my job to see their body language and you try to hold them out,” the coach added. “There’s just a lot for us to learn. We’re going through plays and script. We just haven’t had that much time.”\nJazz fans seemed to enjoy the rare glimpse of practice they got to see Friday. Here are some tidbits:\n— Point guard Trey Burke had a nice steal during one of the five-on-five drills the Jazz ran. Snyder appreciated the way Burke responded with the stunt and shift.\n“That was a good play by Trey Burke right there,” Snyder said into the mic. “Good job, Trey.”\n— Another point of emphasis, Snyder added, is that the point guards will pick up the ball full court more than they have in the past. The coach called this tactic “disciplined disruption.” Neto was especially effective with that pressure play in Hawaii against the Lakers in the exhibition opener when he notched four steals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:08:30.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
