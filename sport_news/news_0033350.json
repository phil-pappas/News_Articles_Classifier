The team's policy — which differs from other Rutgers athletics teams — dictates a series of disciplinary measures before a fourth offense results in dismissal. \nPLUS: For Rutgers athletes, when it comes to drugs: 3 strikes and you're not out \nFlood, in his first press conference since returning Sunday from a three-game suspension for violating an academic compliance policy, was pressed on the reports about Terry's alleged statement. \n\"Those are all personal issues with particular players and medical issues, and issues that I can't discuss publicly,'' Flood said, when asked whether Terry was suspended last season. WATCH: Rutgers coach Kyle Flood returns from suspension with an apology Rutgers football coach Kyle Flood returned from his three-game suspension on Monday with an apology. The apology came during his first press conference with the media since his suspension in September. The suspension came after he violated a university compliance policy. (Video by Adya Beasley | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) \nOfficially termed the Drug and Alcohol Education and Testing Program, the Rutgers football policy dictates that the first violation may result in a two-week suspension from competition; a second violation will result in a minimum one-game suspension; a third violation will result in a minimum three-game suspension and a fourth violation will result in dismissal from the program. \n\"We have a best-in-class care system here at Rutgers, one that any of our athletes who test positive immediately go into,'' Flood said. \"We're very proud of it, that we do everything we can to help our student-athletes with what is a very, very serious issue today with young people.'' \nALSO: What did Rutgers' Kyle Flood say of rule breaking in 1st address since suspension? \nWhile Flood dismissed a specific question when asked if players who fail a second drug test receive a one-game suspension — which is dictated in the Rutgers football drug policy — the Scarlet Knights fourth-year head coach did address whether his program complies in general with the penalties and procedures of the policy. \n\"Our program enforces the university drug policy,'' Flood said. \"That's not an issue. But I think what people need to understand is that that policy has different phases to it. That policy is about testing. That policy is about care.'' \nMORE : Rutgers coach Kyle Flood on recruiting ambassadors: 'We've got a good program' \nFlood was then asked whether he has any concern that there is a drug problem inside his program. \n\"I take the issue of marijuana, drugs, alcohol addiction very seriously,'' Flood said. \"I think those are big issues on every college campus in the country. Do I feel that we have an issue above and beyond what our campus is or what another team has? I do not. That has not been my experience.'' \nKeith Sargeant may be reached at ksargeant@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @KSargeantNJ .
