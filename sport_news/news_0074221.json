The teams tried waiting it out in the locker rooms, but just as it seemed the game might get under way, a second band of storms made its way toward the RRHS field, forcing the contest to be postponed to Saturday at 10 a.m. \nThe game kicked off under good conditions, but was delayed toward the end of the third quarter as a storm out of the southwest rolled in. Both teams took shelter in the locker rooms for an hour before they were allowed back on the field. The Hawks quickly found their footing and took the game 33-18. \n“So, a 10-hour game. No big deal. Whatever it takes,” head coach David Rastovski said. \nJust prior to the delay Saturday, the Hawks had been building momentum in a tight game thanks to their third interception, and Noe Arellano’s second of the game, with 3:33 left in the third quarter. \nBut at the 2:40 mark, the officials called the teams off the field for a lightning delay. \n“It stopped us on a little bit of momentum,” Hawk senior Chris Lipscomb said. “From being stuck in a room for an hour it just slowed it down a little bit, but I say we did good.” \nA little more than a minute after the game resumed, Sean Fanning ran in a one-yard touchdown. The extra point was no good, and the Hawks led 26-12. \nBoth teams crossed the goal line again in the fourth, although Amphi’s point-after attempt was no good, to reach the final score of 33-18. \nRRHS quarterback Fanning went 7-for-10, throwing for 120 yards. Lipscomb rushed for 143 yards on 14 carries. \nThe Hawks (4-4) travel to Cholla Magnet Friday and come home for the last game of the season Oct. 30 against Pusch Ridge. \n“Our season’s not over yet; we have more work to do. We’re taking that one day at a time,” Lipscomb said. “I’m looking for a big run. I’m looking for 200 yards. I’m looking for a great season of my senior year.” Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T02:01:48.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
