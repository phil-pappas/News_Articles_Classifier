Coac Mike O'Shea referred to the decision to sit Anderson simply as a \"roster switch.\"\n\"It was always the plan from the start to give Zach a rest periodically,\" said O'Shea. \"I'm not saying he needs it, it was always part of the plan. (Mackey) can double up two positions, outside and inside, so this helps us cover off two positions.\"\nLeft tackle Stanley Bryant, who has been away all week tending to a personal matter, is expected to be back and in the lineup vs. Ottawa.\n\nVEGAS SAYS\n\nWinnipeg is favoured by one point.\n\nSTREAKS\n\nOttawa: one win; Winnipeg: one loss.\n\nFYI\n\nWinnipeg quarterback Matt Nichols is the first passer in CFL history to record at least 1,400 yards for two teams in the same year. Only one other QB reached 1,200 with two teams in the same year -- Dieter Brock had 1,892 yards passing for Winnipeg and 1,241 for Hamilton in 1983. Brock was dealt by Winnipeg for Tom Clements that season and the two would lead their teams into the 1984 Grey Cup, won by the Bombers.\n\nCLOSE BUT...\n\nThe Bombers' last four games have been decided by a total of nine points and they have a 1-3 record over that span. The only other time in CFL history any team had four consecutive games decided by three points or less was Saskatchewan at the start the 1987 season (they went 2-2 to start that year).\nSo far this year the Bombers have had seven contests decided by four points or less and have racked up a record of 3-4. By comparison, from 2012-14 the Bombers had only six games decided by four or less.\n\nNUMBERS\n\nGAME\n\nThe Blue Bombers have allowed 12 sacks in their last three games against the Redblacks, but limited them to just one in last week's loss... An Ottawa win would give them their first 10-win season since 1978 (11-5).\n\n-- Ed Tait", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T13:59:07.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
