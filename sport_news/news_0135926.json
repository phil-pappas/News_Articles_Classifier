Well, aside from the best place to stay dry while covering a football game during a hurricane is in the press box. Every year, teams are different. New players, progressive concepts and sometimes even coaching changes create unique circumstances. Ahead of kickoff in early September, I sensed that Chuck Tinninis liked his 2015 squad. Yes, most head coaches are predominantly positive during the summer months. But, getting to know Tinninis and becoming familiar with his personality, I can usually tell if he’s bluffing. The talent and experience was there. No one was denying that. Having previously covered several of Greencastle-Antrim’s starters, whether on the gridiron or otherwise, I knew they had the athletes to make some noise. What sets teams apart, however, is a collective desire to win. The Blue Devils conveyed that in the opener against Chambersburg, staying the course to eventually emerge victorious in overtime. From there, the next three weeks didn’t fully command that characteristic. Sure, they had to hold on at Big Spring, but even then, the game never truly felt in jeopardy. Superior talent separated G-A in blowouts of Littlestown and West Perry. Entering Week 5 unbeaten, we all knew the Blue Devils were going to face their first real test vs. East Pennsboro. Although the scoreboard read 20-16 Panthers, to me, Greencastle passed. When it comes to the hard-nosed game of football, people are rarely interested in moral victories. It’s a brutally physical sport, certainly not for the weak. Forget any type of silver lining. Honestly, I bet the Blue Devils feel the same way. Bottom line is, in the end, they lost. Heading to Hershey this weekend, there’s also a little déjà vu from a season ago, when things started going south near the midway point after such a promising start. While having no idea what Saturday night’s outcome will be — yes, it’s a Saturday game this week — I do know that there’s no reason to push the panic button. Instead, the optimism should remain. Especially considering the heart displayed by G-A last Friday, even in defeat. What we saw against East Pennsboro was a team refusing to concede. Backed up deep in their own end with less than two minutes to play, the Blue Devils found a way. Ultimately, the potential game-winning drive ended a yard short of the end zone. Even so, the confidence built in such a situation can set the tone for the second half of the year. With that said, things aren’t going to get any easier. The division is better, Hershey handed G-A its worst loss of 2014 and the weather will undoubtedly turn colder. Still, it’s unlikely they’ll see poorer conditions than what they just endured. Who knows? Page 2 of 2 - Regardless, it’s hard not to forecast the Blue Devils being in the mix. No, I can’t predict the future. But, as evident a few nights ago, they’re not going to go away. Admittedly, some things need cleaned up if G-A is going to make its first District 3 playoff appearance since 2011. Most notably — penalties and turnovers. Those are things that can be coached. What’s inside each of those young men cannot. This is a team that expects to win every time it takes the field. Against East Penn, they didn’t just talk about it. They showed it. That was my only question a month ago. Does this team have the desire? Last Friday, I got my answer.
