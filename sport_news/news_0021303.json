I’ll have something planned to do. \n“I don’t know what, yet, though.” \nWith that Spurrier ended a Hall of Fame coaching career that some believe puts him on the Mount Rushmore of Southeastern Conference Coaches. \nFollowing three consecutive 11-2 finishes, with the last leading to a ranking of fourth nationally, Spurrier was deeply disappointed with the Gamecocks 7-6 mark last season. \nHe was so disappointed that he contemplated walking away and did just that briefly. \nTanner was able to talk Spurrier into returning, however. \nDespite appearing re-energized, he could not shake questions about his retirement. \nThat, along with the team’s poor start, proved more than Spurrier could bear. \nThat led to a call to Tanner on Sunday and an announcement to upperclassmen on his team that it was time to walk away. \n“There comes a time when you’ve just got to ask what direction is our football is going,” said Spurrier. “It wasn’t going the way we hoped so I need to step aside.” \nWhile it is believed USC, led by Tanner will conduct a national search for its next coach, Elliott is not giving up the belief he can help the Gamecocks turn their season around and put himself in the mix. \nA Camden native, Elliott grew up a South Carolina fan and attended many games in Williams-Brice Stadium. \nWhen Spurrier was looking for an offensive line coach, Elliott actively recruited The Head Ball Coach, promising if he hired him, he wouldn’t regret it. \nAfter interviewing several USC assistant coaches Monday night, Tanner talked to team captains Pharoh Cooper, Mike Matulis, Isaiah Johnson and Skai Moore. \nSpurrier opted not to indorse any of his assistants, leaving that decision to Tanner. \nHe then called Elliott and offered him the interim head coach position. \n“I want to thank coach Spurrier,” said Elliott. “Six years ago he took a chance on me and brought me here to Carolina.” \nElliott hopes to hit the ground running as he says job one is preparing for Vanderbilt on Saturday. \nElliott is credited with introducing the “Zone Read” concept to the Gamecocks offensive attack. \nIt was particularly successful during Connor Shaw’s tenure as quarterback and appears suited to freshman Lorenzo Nunez’s talents. \nElliott could also bring an energy that has been lacking in the program. \nHe will probably fine-tune the offensive attack to even more suit his way of thinking. \nElliott has promoted quarterbacks coach G.A. Mangus to offensive coordinator, while Fountain Inn native and former Hillcrest and USC standout Travelle Wharton has been promoted to offensive line coach. \nHe had an 11-year career in the National Football League with all but one spent with the Carolina Panthers. \nOther than finding a way to defeat Vanderbilt, job one for Elliott is finding a way to boost recruiting which has fallen on hard times in recent years. \nSince the exit of homegrown Palmetto State players Marcus Lattimore, Jadeveon Clowney, Stephon Gilmore, D.J. Swearinger and DeVonte Holloman, there hasn’t been the same level of talent in South Carolina. \nThe Gamecocks coaching staff have not been able to compensate by getting highly regarded talent from out of state. \nWhile there are exceptions, the majority of players USC has lured out of the talent rich state of Georgia have been those left over after the Bulldogs, Alabama, Auburn and others have taken what they wanted. \nConsidered one of USC’s best recruiters, Elliott will work hard to start that process. \n\"When I walked in this morning, I said to our staff our goal is to win this week,” said Elliott. “Win today. Win tomorrow, Win the next day and beat Vanderbilt. \n“Our team is not in shambles as some might say. We’ve got a great group of energetic young men who are ready to go out there and lay it on the line.” \nWith the Gamecocks owning a 2-4 overall and 0-4 SEC mark, Elliott has a job on his hands. \nIf he finds a way to turn things around, he will become a serious candidate to keep the position. \nIf not, Tanner is prepared to search nationwide for what he believes is the right person to return the program to where Spurrier had it at its height and then go beyond.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T09:03:04.832+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
