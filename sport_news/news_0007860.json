They were left battling a country they had beaten once in seven outings since the London Olympics three years ago. \nThe outcome meant Ireland, ranked 14th (seven spots lower than New Zealand), qualify for their first Olympic tournament since 1908. \nAustralian captain Mark Knowles paid tribute to New Zealand after his team had effectively rubbished the whispers, largely from Europe, that they would go soft on their rivals. \n\"These are guys we've grown up playing against, and this isn't the way you'd like it to go,\" a magnanimous Knowles said. \nAustralia struck two hammer blows inside the first six minutes, capitalising on a flying start with goals from Glenn Turner and Jamie Dwyer. \nThe impressive James Coughlan pulled one back, but when Trent Mitton scored from a sharp angle after New Zealand were denied a penalty corner, it looked a lost cause. \nHowever the Black Sticks poured forward and had a string of penalty corners in the dying minutes, with Kane Russell scoring from one. \nCoughlan, veteran Ryan Archibald, in probably the final international of an 18-year career, defender Bradley Shaw and Nick Wilson all had their moments. \n\"I am gutted,\" captain Simon Child said. \"We were a little slow out of the blocks and Australia's tempo blew us off the park.\" \nIt was double success for Australia yesterday, their world No 2-ranked women beating fourth-ranked New Zealand 2-1 in a penalty shootout after the scores were locked 1-1. \nPetrea Webster put New Zealand ahead early with a brave, diving goal. Seven minutes before halftime Laura Barden equalised. \nNew Zealand created several chances, notably to Webster, Stacey Michelsen and Pippa Hayward, while captain Anita Punt was outstanding. \nThe penalty shootout went the Aussies' way with Jodie Kenny and Mariah Williams scoring, while Charlotte Harrison was the only successful New Zealander. \n- By David Leggat of the New Zealand Herald", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:54:42.538+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
