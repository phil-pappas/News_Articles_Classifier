The graduates can see the goal in sight, so it's hard not to play around, just ease up and coast until getting handed the diploma. It's difficult to concentrate, because they can see what's ahead for them and they're ready to move on. The attention wanders and attention to detail is often thrown out the window. It's why Saturday is a good time for the Tigers' veteran leadership to step up. LSU messed around too long with massive underdog Eastern Michigan three weeks ago, but that can't happen against 6-1 Western Kentucky. The Hilltoppers are legit. The pick: LSU 48, Western Kentucky 20\nTennessee at No. 8 Alabama: The Crimson Tide, two weeks away from their Tuscaloosa showdown with LSU, must somewhat feel the same as the Tigers do. Except Alabama has a traditional SEC rival coming to Bryant-Denny and the Vols have enough offensive talent to make the game interesting for a quarter or two, because of QB Joshua Dobbs and RBs Jalen Hurd and Alabama transfer Alvin Kamara. But the Vols haven't showed the defensive chops – they are 13 th in the SEC in total defense (419 yards per gane allowed), 11 th in rushing defense (170.5 ypg) and tied for 12 th in scoring defense (25.7 ppg) – to stop a physical offense like Alabama possesses. Expect RB Derrick Henry to run big. The pick: Alabama 35, Tennessee 17\nNo. 15 John Chavis Mimes Institute at No. 23 Ole Miss: Many SEC teams don't like playing in Oxford, but it's College Station East for the JCMI Aggies. By quirk of the SEC revamped schedule when A&M and Missouri joined the league in 2012, the Aggies played at Ole Miss in 2012 and 2013 and won both times because it always packed a quarterback named Johnny Manziel. A&M, an 18-point loser last Saturday to Alabama, plays the team that beat the Tide in September. Ole Miss hasn't been as sharp since then and A&M actually has played rather steady except for last week. This game will be decided by which QB can handle the pass rush. The pick: JCMI Aggies 35, Ole Miss 34\nAuburn at Arkansas: Before the season, it seemed as if this game might have Western Division title implications. Auburn was the preseason pick to win the West, Arkansas, because it won three of its last four games last season including consecutive shutouts of LSU and Ole Miss, was just about everybody's choice as the West darkhorse. Then, Auburn with its QB problems, and Arkansas, with a new offensive coordinator who tried too hard to balance the offense by passing more, suffered through 2-2 and 1-3 Septembers respectively. Arkansas should be thoroughly prepared for the Tigers because the Razorbacks are coming off an open date. The Hogs don't need to get too cute offensively. Run THE ball. Pass only when absolutely necessary. The pick: Arkansas 35, Auburn 30\nKentucky at Mississippi State: I'm not quite sure how the SEC office decided that Kentucky from the East and Mississippi State from West would be each other's permanent non-division opponent. It's sort like the Vanderbilt and Ole Miss pairing. All four schools were kind of the last slips of paper in the hat. Kentucky and Mississippi State games are generally decided by a touchdown or two, like State's 45-31 shootout at UK last season. That game featured a combined 1,046 yards total offense, with State QB Dak Prescott accounting for three TDs and Kentucky QB Patrick Towles throwing for 390 yards and two TDs. Both QBs are back and ready to fire away again. This might be Saturday's most entertaining game. The pick: Mississippi State 42, Kentucky 31\nMissouri at Vanderbilt: Missouri is 14 th in the 14-team SEC in total offense, 14 th in rushing offense, 14 th in scoring offense and 11 th in passing offense. Vanderbilt is 9 th in total offense, 10 th in running offense, 13 th in scoring offense and 7 th in passing offense. The Tigers and Commodores have scored just 12 TDs each, meaning collectively with 24 TDs they have fewer TDs than each of the league's top eight scoring offenses. I can't believe gate admission is going to be charged for this game. The SEC Network crew of Dave Neal, Matt Stinchcomb and Kayce Smith will have to be over-the-top non-stop gabby to keep this game from being D.O.A. The pick: Missouri 17 (five field goals and a safety), Vanderbilt 15 (five field goals).\nOpen date: Florida, Georgia, South Carolina", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:30:04.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
