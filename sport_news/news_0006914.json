(AP) - A plan to regulate mixed martial arts bouts between amateur fighters neared Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder’s desk after lawmakers voted to rein in what one called an unsafe “Wild West” culture. \nThe main bill, which won approval in the House 97-9 late Wednesday, would regulate amateur MMA contests like professional MMA fights and boxing. Licensing fees would be assessed on contestants, promoters, judges, referees and others. \nAthletes would compete in weight classes, fight lengths would be limited, drug testing would be required, a doctor and ambulance would be onsite, and promoters would have to submit a bond to the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs before the agency could approve an event. \n“This is the Wild, Wild West of MMA. We’re one of I think a handful of states that just doesn’t have any regulations on amateur mixed martial arts,” said Rep. Harvey Santana, a Detroit Democrat. His bill, which was passed 95-11 by the House and 38-0 by the Senate, would make it a maximum three-year felony to knowingly allow a professional to compete in an MMA fight with an amateur. \nAmateur events, he said, are prevalent every weekend across the state and some promoters are “unscrupulous.” \n“They don’t care about the fighter. They just care that the fighter wants to jump in the cage,” Santana said. “They don’t care about the fighter’s record, how long they’ve been training, what their skill set is. They’ll put them in there with a very inexperienced fighter, and that can lead to a very big problem.” \nThe legislation would prohibit a promoter from hosting a professional boxing match or any MMA bout without at least one inspector present. \nThe primary bill still needs final Senate approval, which could come Thursday, before it goes to Snyder for his expected signature. Similar legislation was introduced in the last three two-year legislative sessions but failed to win passage. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:31:51.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
