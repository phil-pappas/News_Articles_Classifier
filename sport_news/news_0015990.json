Elverado was celebrating Senior Night, but it was Chester that celebrated a victory after Thursday's match in Elkville, taking home a 25-20, 25-15 victory. \"It was a great night for the seniors,\" said EHS head volleyball coach Donette Wheatley. \"This is a great group of kids to work with. I'm really going to miss these five seniors. I wish we could've gone home with a win. (Chester was) a little better and it wasn't from a lack of effort. They put us on the defensive all night and when we had great digs, we couldn't turn it into offense.\" Not only were seniors Baylie McClanahan, Ellie Winthrop, Gabby Eisenhauer, Maycee Bowlin and Haily Falter recognized prior to the game, but they presented their head coach with a EHS volleyball-themed blanket as a gift. \"I want to thank them for the gift,\" Wheatley said. \"This was their special night and they made mine special too.\" Falter had a team-high 5 kills for the Lady Falcons and added 3 digs. McClanahan led digs with 4. Wintrhop had a pair of blocks. Chester also won the junior varsity match, 25-15, 25-22. Tori Ehlers led the J-V Lady Falcons offensively with 6 kills. Elverado (10-9, 7-1) has a pair of road games next week at Zeigler-Royalton on Monday and at Trico on Thursday before Regionals begin the following week.
