Derek Jeter’s replacement is one of the most irreplaceable Yankees right now.\nLosing Gregorius would be a gigantic blow to whatever hopes the Yanks hold in the postseason. Gregorius, acquired last winter for the thankless job of playing shortstop after a beloved icon, has bloomed nicely, evolving into an offensive contributor who provides elite defense, too.\n“I look at Didi, where he started – I mean we knew Didi was talented and we knew there were a lot of things in there that would eventually play out,” Joe Girardi said. “But we worried about coming to New York, Derek Jeter, the first time you’ve ever been given a job every day, and it just took him some time to go through some growing pains.\n“And each month he seemed to get better and better and better, to where, I mean, he’s playing great. He’s played as well as any player that we have. You look at the second half and what he’s done offensively and defensively, he’s been as good as any player that we have.”\nIn some cases, better.\nGregorius is second in RBI among Yankees since the All-Star break. Brian McCann has 38, three more than Gregorius. Overall, Gregorius was hitting .265 with nine homers and 54 RBI going into Tuesday, but he was at .306 with five homers and 35 RBI since July 23.\nA few weeks ago, he had 10 RBI on a six-game road trip. He’s fourth among AL shortstops in WAR and his arm strength and range has impressed teammates all season.\n“He’s been tremendous, especially the way everything started,” said Chase Headley, the man who shares the left side of the infield with Gregorius. “There was a lot to deal with for him, early in the year, obviously. You try not to worry about the ‘Jeet’ thing, but it’s real. He had to step into that and weather that storm. He didn’t get off to a tremendous start.\n“The improvement I’ve seen in him has been dramatic. We knew there was a lot more in there. I think he’s surpassed all expectations. He’s been as good a shortstop as I’ve seen pretty much all year.”\nAnd, Girardi said, Gregorius has more to give.\n“I still think there’s room for more growth,” Girardi said. “I think he’s going to get better as he understands the game more and understands his swing more and what he’s capable of doing.”\nGregorius smiled when told that Girardi had said he’s played as well as any Yankee.\n“I appreciate that, because he puts me in the lineup,” Gregorius said. “It all starts with him.”\nBut he deflected much of the talk about his breakout season, saying he’s never satisfied, that he wants to keep improving. He comes early to the ballpark, asks questions and does a lot of cage work.\nEven with a slow start and some early mental mistakes, “Nobody just gave up on me,” he said.\nYou only have to watch a little to know that Gregorius is a clear upgrade on defense from the Captain’s final seasons and that’s a good thing for the Yankees.\nGregorius has even progressed enough against lefthanded pitching to change that part of the conversation about his game. When the Yanks dealt Shane Greene as part of a three-way trade to land their shortstop, they knew Gregorius came with a rep that he couldn’t hit lefties. The Yanks talked about giving Brendan Ryan starts at short against lefthanders, but Girardi wanted Gregorius to get comfortable against them, too, so he did not sit Gregorius against every southpaw.\nHe’s no lefty-killer now, but Gregorius says he’s “feeling fine” against them. He was hitting .257 against lefties with a .318 on-base and .329 slugging going into Tuesday’s game, better across the board than his lifetime numbers — .218-.285-.277.\nThe Jeter stuff comes up every now and then, Gregorius said, though he acknowledged not as much as it did earlier.\n“It’s nothing I can control, what comes out of people’s mouths,” Gregorius said. “If they want to ask me those questions, I have no problem answering them. That’s the only way you can go about it. I’m never trying to avoid any questions or anything.”\nThe way he’s playing these days, there are hardly any questions about his game.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.nydailynews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T11:27:27.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
