(AP) — A Kansas State football player has been arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. \nThe Topeka Capital-Journal reports (http://bit.ly/1Z44UKK ) 20-year-old Cre Moore was arrested early Sunday after the pickup he was driving hit a light pole in Manhattan. Moore was uninjured. \nThe Riley County Police Department says Moore, a sophomore back-up defensive back for the Wildcats, was charged with DUI and was found to be in possession of “several pills which were identified as depressants.” \nMoore, from Broken Arrow, Okla., was given a bond of $3,500 for the offenses of DUI and possession of a depressant. It was not immediately known if he has an attorney. \nKansas State coach Bill Snyder acknowledged the arrest on Monday and said he would handle the matter, but didn’t elaborate. \n___ \nInformation from: The Topeka (Kan.)
