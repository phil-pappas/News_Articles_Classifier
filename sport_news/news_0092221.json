I hit it. I promise,” Earnhardt said. “I’ll argue with (NASCAR) all day long because I know I’m right. \n“I hit the wall, then the two (Brad Keselowski) hit the wall, then we ran another lap, I pitted and a bunch of other guys hit the wall. \n“There was oil down there. It wasn’t Speedy Dry. I’ve raced this s--t for 20 years, I know what oil and Speedy Dry is. \n“We hit fluid, flew in the wall freaking hard, that’s not Speedy Dry. There was oil up there.” \nEarnhardt wasn’t the only driver to have some choice words for NASCAR officials on both the Gen Six car and the oil fiasco. \nKyle Busch hit the wall as well in the No. 18 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota and he was screaming mad. \n“You can’t pass anybody — it’s a single-lane race track and then (Allgaier) put oil on the top lane (where we) try to make anything happen and then you put yourself in the fence — so thanks to NASCAR for cleaning that up,” Busch yelled on his in car radio.” \nNASCAR doesn’t appear to be planning any penalties to either Earnhardt or Busch as a result of their rants and that is a good thing. \nSteve O’Donnell, NASCAR’s chief racing development officer, told Sirius Radio on Monday that the sanctioning body won’t debate what the drivers thought had happened but he did defend the job the clean up crew did. \n“In this case, we did not see oil,’’ O’Donnell said. “I can’t debate Kyle and (Earnhardt), they’re in the race cars. \n“If they say they hit it, it’s not something that we saw out there. We’ll continue to talk to them and see what maybe we can improve on in the future. \nO’Donnell said that NASCAR officials were more than diligent in their efforts to make sure the track was in perfect racing condition. \n“Under any caution and condition, we obviously send out all the safety equipment to look and see if there is any oil from their perspective on the track,’’ O’Donnell said. \n“We did that in this case. We had (pace car driver) Brett Bodine run through it multiple times and confirm back up to race control that the track was in good shape to go ahead and restart. \n“That’s where we were and felt like we did everything we could to ensure that the race track was in a safe condition.’’ \nFINISH LINES \nThe next generation of NASCAR drivers is getting younger all the time. Cayden Lapcevich, the 15-year-old son of NASCAR Canadian Tire Series race winner Jeff Lapcevich, will run NCATS full time next season. And Harrison Burton, the 15-year-old son of former NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver Jeff Burton, will make his debut this weekend in the NASCAR K&N Pro Series West. \nHAMILTON-VETTEL RIVALRY HAS MERCEDES EXCITED \nIt’s nice to see that Mercedes Formula 1 racing boss Toto Wolff has finally acknowledged the greatness of Lewis Hamilton — his soon-to-be three-time world champion driver. \nIt wasn’t that long ago the team’s fair haired boy was Nico Rosberg and Hamilton was never really given his due. \nSo good on Wolff for embracing Hamilton’s superior driving for the team this season. \nIn doing so, however, Wolff might have over stepped on his enthusiastic praise by proclaiming that a looming rivalry between Hamilton and Ferrari ace Sebastian Vettel is not only on the horizon, but that it would be better than the one between Nigel Mansell and Ayrton Senna in the early 1990s — universally believed to be the greatest rivalry in F-1 history. \nAfter Hamilton won the Russian Grand Prix in dominating fashion, with Vettel finishing second, Wolff said that F-1 as a whole and Hamilton would be better served with a fight to the finish between the two superstars. \n“They are both in very performing cars and it could be one of the great rivalries in the sport — in different teams,” Wolff told Motorsport.com about a Hamilton/Vettel rivalry. \nWolff’s remarks are sure to sting Rosberg, who has been Hamilton’s chief foe for the past two seasons until Vettel moved to Ferrari this season. \n“We expect (Ferrari) to be very strong next year,” Wolff said. “They showed great performance earlier than expected and again, towards the end of the (Sochi) race, you can see Sebastian had good pace in his car and his tires. \n“This is a good group of people with a very good car, and we are looking forward to a great fight next year.” \nRANT \nI am sure that when Joey Logano won the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte Motor Speedway on Sunday afternoon he didn’t much care how many people were watching. \nIt turns out there were the 50,000 or so at CMS and about 2.2 million watching on NBCSN/TSN. \nWhile both numbers would be considered out-of-this-world goals for the Verizon IndyCar Series and Formula 1 in North America, they are down dramatically from last season when the same NASCAR race drew about 4 million. \nThe difference was not necessarily the racing - although Sunday’s rain delayed event wasn’t exactly a gem. \nLast season the race aired on the full ABC network and this year’s race was pushed to the NBCSN cable network. \nWhen NASCAR signed its multi-billion-dollar deal to move from ABC/ESPN to NBC/NBCSN it had to know there would be a corresponding drop in rating points. \nJust ask the NHL how that worked out for them. \nNASCAR needs to convince NBC to put more of its Sprint Cup and Xfinity Series races on the main network. \nThat, however, will be hard to do in that NBC is committed to growing its cable sports brand through properties like NASCAR. \nRED BULL THREATS SOUND LIKE SOUR GRAPES \nThreats by Red Bull owner Dietrich Mateschitz to pull out of Formula 1 if he can’t get a new engine supplier were met by panic at first with some fearing it would mortally wound the world’s top open wheel racing series. \nComments this week by Adrian Newey, the team’s chief designer however, sound a whole lot like sour grapes. \n“We’re possibly going to be forced out of Formula 1 — Mercedes and Ferrari have refused to supply us out of fear,” Newey told Reuters. “Red Bull should not be put in a position where they’re only there to make up the numbers.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:26:50.192+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
