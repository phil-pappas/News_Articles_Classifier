The goal of the race is to garner support for people in recovery and to educate the community at large about behavioral health issues. The Heroes movement, ignited by Foundations Recovery Network (FRN), has been carried on the shoulders of supporters, advocates, friends, family members and all those touched by the disease of addiction and mental health issues. The Heroes in Recovery 6K Trail Run/Hike will be held on October 18 at 8:00 am at the Paramount Ranch Recreational Area near Agoura Hills. The race takes participants on a scenic 6K (3.728 mile) course through the renowned park.\nThe race includes cash prizes totaling $1,500.00 to be presented to the top four males and females in the Overall and Masters age division. The fourth place finishers will be recognized with the unique distinction of ‘Almost Podium’. All Registered participants will each receive a short-sleeve technical t-shirt and finisher’s medal. This is a family-friendly event and will include post-race nutrition and entertainment for race participants and spectators.\nThe charity beneficiary for this race is New Directions for Youth , which provides direct services and programs for at-risk youth and families throughout the San Fernando Valley and in the greater Los Angeles area. For more than 40 years, NDY has provided services such as counseling, homework assistance, gang reduction and prevention, literacy, parenting classes, community beautification, summer camp and much more – free of charge – to more than 3000 individuals each year.\nAfter the successful launch of this event in 2011, This Heroes in Recovery event is the 24th in a series of 6k races that are held across the country to raise awareness and break the stigma associated with addiction treatment mental health needs and recovery. Previous events have taken place in Nashville, TN New York, NY, Palm Springs, CA, Louisville, CO, Coconut Creek, FL, Roswell, GA and Memphis, TN.\nEarly registration for all races is $25, regular registration is $30 increasing to $35, and day-of-race fees are $40.\nFor more information and to register go to http://www.heroes6k.com\nAbout Heroes in Recovery:\nAccording to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), 20 million people needed substance abuse treatment last year and did not receive it. Ten million Americans did not receive needed mental health care. The stigma associated with substance abuse and mental health disorders creates a significant barrier to individuals and families seeking help.\nHeroes in Recovery is a grassroots movement intended to remove the social stigma associated with people who are in recovery, to recognize the heroic effort it takes to overcome the obstacles in seeking help, and to celebrate the act of preventing the past from kidnapping the future. While the movement initially focuses on persons recovering from addictive behavior, it is meant also to recognize heroes recovering from many other types of disorders and trauma that can feed or manifest from an addiction.\nThe Heroes in Recovery 6K races serve as an educational tool for the community as well as a reminder to individuals that while they are on a personal journey of recovery, many others are on that road with them.
