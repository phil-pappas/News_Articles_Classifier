Introductions were awesome, Matthew Mitchell was Matthew Mitchell and it was great. But halfway through watching him whip I realized something was missing. Makayla Epps. So obviously I took to Twitter and I knew I wasn’t the only one who was a little confused. \nIn the off-season, Epps was involved in an alcohol-related incident that led to suspension. A suspension which, according to the Herald-Leader’s Jen Smith , went through last night and will carry through the Cats first exhibition game against Union on Nov. 8. She will also miss the first actual game of the season against Rice on Nov. 13. \nHowever, Mitchell had nothing but praise for his star player, who averaged 14.9 points and 4.6 rebounds last season, while he was interviewed by the SEC Network crew last night. Saying that he was incredibly proud of how she had handled the adversity, praising her diligence in workouts during the post-season and assuring that she will more than likely be the best player in Women’s college hoops next season when she returns against Arizona State on Nov. 15. \nArticle written by Haley Simpson I'm basically a giant ball of sarcasm, awkwardness and random sports facts in human form.
