ROCKFORD – Ted Dent figured on Tuesday that as the week wore on, his Rockford IceHogs “will get jacked up” for this weekend’s first home game and a two-game series against the Texas Stars. No doubt the team is glad to be at the BMO Harris Bank Center for six of its next seven American Hockey League games after going 1-1 on the season-opening road trip to California. Rockford takes on Texas at 7 tonight, then again at 4 p.m. Sunday on Eddy Olyczyk Night. “It’s going to be awesome,” said center Dennis Rasmussen. “It’s always fun to play here in the BMO. I hope there’s going to be a lot of people here.” “After that first loss (7-0 at Stockton last Saturday), it’s nice to come home and have these fans because they’re some of the best in the league,” said forward Brandon Mashinter. “It’s a loud building.” The IceHogs hope to make noise of their own to cause more commotion from their fan base. That means playing significantly better than in their last outing. To Dent, he hopes a full week of concentrated practices will lead to noticeable improvement. “We have to limit our turnovers. We have to take care of the puck better,” he said. “Our defense really struggled with the puck (last) Saturday and it wasn’t just one guy – it was all six. “We have to move the puck, we have to get it in our forwards’ hands and let them do their thing. On the penalty kill, we have to get better. We’ve got to win faceoffs, and know what we are doing in the zone when the other team does get set up. We have to create some offense as well.” Getting blanked already this season surprises the players. “We have one of the best forward groups I’ve ever seen in the AHL,” Mashinter said. “We have a young defensive corps, but it is very skilled. And once they learn the game they’re going to get it. We’ve got great goaltending. “Overall, I think we have a great team. It’s just a matter of finding that chemistry and rolling with it.” Reed Schreck: reedschreck1@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:23:57.619+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
