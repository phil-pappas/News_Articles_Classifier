St. Mary sophomore Shawan Gresham (5) stretches to grab Wallington's Pawel Koc (34) returning the kick-off. \nThe Bulldogs, Wildcats and Bears seemed to like the weather. \nDespite moving their game to Thursday, Becton (3-1) and Queen of Peace (0-4) still had to fight through the raindrops as the Cats defeated the Golden Griffins, 26-0, in East Rutherford.

But the rain did not do North Arlington (2-2) well as the Vikings fell 55-0 in the rain at home. \nSt. Mary (4-0) moved its game with Wallington to Sunday and stayed undefeated in the NJIC Liberty Division with a 22-7 victory at Tamblyn Field. \nThursday, Oct. 1 \nBecton 26, Queen of Peace 0 \nBecton took a 13-0 lead with rushing touchdowns from running back Gianni Failla and quarterback Michael Bolwell en route to win the NJIC crossover contest between the South Bergenite rivals. The stormy conditions limited the passing game of Queen of Peace quarterback Derick Suazo who completed six of 24 pass attempts for 59 yards. The Becton running game took control as Failla ran a career high 23 times for 133 yards and three touchdowns. Alex Montalvo led the Becton defense with 12 tackles, two sacks and one fumble recovery. In addition Gianni's sophomore brother, Nico, had an impact on defense at linebacker with six tackles and a key second-half interception. \nFriday, Oct. 2 \nHasbrouck Heights 55, North Arlington 0 \nThe rain and North Arlington don't seem to go together. The Vikings were looking to rebound after a disastrous 55-20 loss the previous week at Cresskill. Hasbrouck Heights came to play and rolled out to a 36-0 lead by halftime. The Vikings had some chances to break up the shutout, but never really got into the game in the second half. The Aviators defense contained North Arlington's top offensive weapon Michael Manzo-Lewis. \nRutherford 50, Palisades Park 20 \nThe night was for running and Rutherford back Kevin Kosakowski. The junior Bulldog got the ball 18 times and ran for 226 yards and six touchdowns. Palisades Park stayed with Rutherford in the first quarter, but Kosakowski took over in the second and third quarters. He sprinted for six of his seven touchdowns. Kosakowski also caught a 62-yard touchdown pass from Rutherford quarterback Nick Birchby. After three quarters the Bulldogs had the game under control with a 50-12 lead. \nLyndhurst 41, Harrison 19 \nThe rain did not stop another big day from Lyndhurst senior Peter Guerriero. The signal caller ran 15 times for 230 yards and four touchdowns. The Golden Bears took a 41-0 lead at halftime and held on in the fourth quarter as the Blue Tide scored 19 points behind quarterback Mike O'Donnell. Chris Feurtado and Kevin Santos added a rushing touchdown each for the Golden Bears. \nSunday, Oct. 3 \nSt. Mary 22, Wallington 7 \nSt. Mary had a tougher time than expected, but it faced an improved Wallington squad. The Gaels defense led by the likes of Logan Gardner, Julian Mumford and Alex Domac kept the Wallington offense of Tyshaun Horton at bay for most of the game. The Gaels struggled at times on the ground so they went to sophomore quarterback Richard Marques. Marques hit junior wide receiver Patrick Taylor and senior running back Derius Stone on passing touchdowns in the first half to give the Gaels a 15-7 halftime lead. And Stone added a rushing touchdown in the second half to keep the Panthers at bay for the NJIC Patriot Division victory. \nFootball Preview Week 5", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:17:41.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
