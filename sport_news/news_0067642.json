DANNY MOLOSHOK, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS By BILL PLUNKETT / STAFF WRITER SEND PDF Broadcaster Vin Scully underwent a medical procedure Thursday and will miss the Dodgers' postseason. DANNY MOLOSHOK, THE ASSOCIATED PRESS \nLOS ANGELES – The Dodgers announced that Hall of Fame broadcaster Vin Scully underwent “a recommended medical procedure” Thursday morning and will not work the post-season. \nNo further details were given regarding the procedure. Scully missed the final series of the regular season last weekend as well due to an illness that was described at the time as a cold. Scully missed another game earlier in the season as well. \nDodgers officials spoke to Scully this week and said he was in good spirits. He is said to be resting comfortably. \nScully recently announced that he would return for the 2016 season (with a travel schedule yet to be determined) but he expected that to be his final season. That would be an unprecedented 67 th season as a member of the Dodgers’ broadcast crew. \nScully will turn 88 in late November.
