Morseman, 30, who grew up in Addison and now lives in Bath, ran his first-ever marathon at the 2008 Wineglass. Sunday’s 34th edition of the Wineglass Marathon marked Morseman’s 50th marathon and when he crossed the finish line on Market Street with a winning time of 2 hours, 24 minutes and 22.36 seconds, it was his 30th career marathon victory. Just like last year and in many of his marathon wins, Morseman was never challenged. With the 26.2-mile race starting just north of Bath, Morseman bolted out to a commanding lead and finished more than 11 minutes ahead of Rochester native Chad Byler’s second-place time of 2:35:35.62. Chris Raulli of Syracuse finished third in 2:41:38.40. Although his time was 90 seconds behind Andrew Herr’s record pace of 2:22:52 set in 1997, Morseman felt pretty good about the numerous personal milestones, which included his third overall triumph at the Wineglass Marathon, with the first coming in 2011. “Actually, today was very nice,” Morseman said. “I wanted the course record, I came up just shy again, but doing all the work myself and still running that time, that’s very impressive. I did a marathon eight days ago out in Indiana and I won that won in 2:26, so obviously I wasn’t as rested, but it doesn’t mean I wasn’t shooting for the course record here. “It means a lot to me to hit those milestones, so yes, I’m happy,” he added. “I wanted to mark my 50th marathon here and my 30th win here, so I was just glad I could do it front of everyone.” Molly Nunn of Winston Salem, NC doesn’t have near as extensive a marathon resume as Morseman, but she too, has quite an impressive winning percentage at the Wineglass Marathon. After capturing the women’s title at the Wineglass in 2011, Nunn had battled injuries in recent years, which included undergoing knee surgery last year. Nunn made her marathon return Sunday and placed first in the women’s field in 2 hours, 55 minutes and 2.91 seconds, which was good enough for 15th overall. “This is a big, big happy surprise for me,” said Nunn, who noted she started training again after the surgery in January. “I was actually in tears coming around the corner (onto Bridge Street) because when you hit the bridge, you know the end is near and so it was such a reward to know that I can run again without pain. I’m just so happy to be here.” Page 2 of 2 - Nunn said she has only run five marathons, but now has two wins, both at the Wineglass. When asked what brought her back, Nunn said, “the race directors and how wonderfully well run this event is and the course and then just how beautiful Corning is and the running down here, it’s just a perfect course, it’s wonderful. It’s just flat and fast and the scenery is really great, I love it.” Matthew Wilber of Corning won the Wineglass Half Marathon in 1 hour, 12 minutes and 50.65 seconds. Marina Orrson, the women’s half marathon champ, finished second overall and set a Wineglass Half Marathon women’s record with her time of 1 hour, 19 minutes and 52.91 seconds. A record field of runners were greeted with near-perfect distance running weather conditions, with temperatures hovering in the 50s and low 60s. A total of 1,927 runners completed the marathon, while 2,391 runners finished the half marathon. The predominantly downhill marathon course starts north of Bath and finishes on Market Street in Corning. While Morseman has run competitively for most of his life, he’s gotten extra motivation in recent years by running for his two sons, particularly his 18-month-old youngest son Leeim, who has spina bifida, a congenital defect of the spine. “It means more to lace up the shoes everyday to go out there, you never know, it could happen to anybody,” said Morseman, who is employed at World Kitchen in Corning. “I just hope I can inspire other people and other families to do the same thing, even if they’ve got a kid with special needs or might not be able to walk, to keep going. All of the support we’ve gotten has touched my family.” By BOB BENZ rbenz@the-leader.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:30:31.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
