After starting with Del Zotto, Medvedev has now played with both of his neighbors in the dressing room. \nMedvedev played left defense through four games, as Del Zotto’s partner for three. Each ended the preseason tied with Jake Voracek for the team lead in points with five. \nThe pairing may have been a bit too risky, though. Medvedev, a 33-year-old Russian who was signed to a $3 million contract, the second-richest deal the Flyers have ever given a first-year NHLer, plays a lot like Del Zotto. \n“Sometimes it’s chemistry with pairings,” Hakstol said. “That pairing, no question you’ve got two offensive-minded guys there. That’s not to say that pair won’t be back together at some point in time, but we wanted to look at the balance of putting a stay-at-home guy with a more offensively minded guy.” \nFriday night, Medvedev was paired with Gudas, another newcomer to the Flyers. Gudas hasn’t played a regular-season game since last December. Knee surgery in January claimed the rest of his season, but he was still included in a trade at last season’s deadline that sent Braydon Coburn to Tampa. The Flyers say his camp has been “rusty,” but he’s knocked a lot of it off. \n“We like Radko. He’s a good player,” GM Ron Hextall said. “He plays hard. He plays really hard and I thought he played his best game (Friday).” \nAfter playing most of training camp with Andrew MacDonald, Gudas’ standing on a pair with Medvedev suggests the Flyers see him as a top-six defenseman, although there’s always the chance the pairs change again before Thursday’s season opener. The only one that seems etched in stone is the top pair of Nick Schultz and Mark Streit. \n“I feel good. I feel comfortable,” Gudas said. “Obviously (Medvedev is) a little bit of a different style than I was used to until now with A Mac, but it’s gonna take a couple days, a couple games and it will get better and better as we get to know each other a little more. It’s important for the D pairs to switch at this time just to get a little taste of what you’re gonna get from everyone.” \nThe Flyers also had Brandon Manning on the left side of the ice with Luke Schenn on the right until Friday night’s preseason finale when he was on the right and Del Zotto was on the left. \nConsidering how the Flyers move their players around, versatility is a must. Hakstol, a defenseman in his playing days, knows it’s difficult for some to make the move from one side of the ice to the other, but also knew Manning would be up for it. \n“Some guys can do it and make the transition pretty smoothly. Other guys simply are just better on one side or the other. It really depends on the player,” the coach said. “I thought Brandon did a good job making that transition (Friday) and we had a bit of that knowledge going in.” \nHakstol insinuated that the Flyers’ forward lines are likely to stick from Saturday’s practice to Thursday’s opener, but that the defense pairings could still change. \nAs the depth chart stands now MacDonald and Schenn are extras. Extras with a combined salary-cap hit of $8.6 million. \nSunday, the Flyers did not place anyone on waivers to help get their roster down to 23. With one more cut left to make, if they intend on sending an established NHLer to the minors, he’d have to be put on waivers Monday so that he clears Tuesday before the 5 p.m. roster deadline. \nWould the Flyers do that to a guy like Schenn, a former No. 5 overall pick in 2008 who was traded in 2012 for 30-goal scorer James van Riemsdyk? Would Hextall take history into account on a move like that? \n“It doesn’t matter,” he said. “We’re going to put the best team possible on the ice on Thursday night. Whatever move we make, it’s gonna be what we feel is best for the team and the franchise right now.” \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com . 1 CONNECT 18 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.cpsj.com/1LbVEyg TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T04:28:17.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
