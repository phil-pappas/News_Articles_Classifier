I didn’t really get any backlash from the league.”\n• Cam Heyward talks to NFL, agrees not to wear eye black honoring father\nStill, who played 12 games for the Bengals in 2014 but was released before the 2015 season began, said he was surprised to hear that Heyward was fined.\nHeyward announced Tuesday that he will no longer wear the customized eye black after coming to an agreement with the NFL. He appealed the first fine, but faces a potential second fine of $11,576 for wearing the eye black two weeks in a row.\nThe NFL has designated October, which is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, as the month to honor the fight against cancer, allowing teams to wear pink on their uniforms. However, the league denied Steelers running back DeAngelo Williams ’s request to wear pink apparel all season in memory of his mother, who died of breast cancer last year.\n- Erin Flynn\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/13932051/devon-surprised-league-disciplining-cameron-heyward-pittsburgh-steelers-eye-black-messages", "http://www.si.com/nfl/player/deangelo-williams", "http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/10/21/cam-heyward-pittsburgh-steelers-eye-black-fine", "http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/10/12/deangelo-williams-wear-pink-honor-mother-breast-cancer-nfl-request-denied", "http://www.si.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.si.com/nfl/2015/10/14/cam-heyward-fined-nfl-eye-black-honoring-father-cancer-fight"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:55:26.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
