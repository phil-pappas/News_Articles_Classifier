Staffer and I had a minor fender bender. pic.twitter.com/Zx9fDB2OMp\n— David Vitter (@DavidVitter) October 23, 2015 Neither Vitter nor Gaustella were injured. A spokesman for Vitter's campaign said Vitter was headed to a lunch meeting. Vitter's driver was cited for improper lane usage.\nIn response to media inquiries, the Sheriff's Office released a statement about Vitter's actions after the accident. It reads, in part:\n\"David Vitter did not remain on the scene after the accident he was involved in occurred. He did provide his information to the driver of his vehicle, who in turn, gave that information to the investigating officer. Mr. Vitter’s actions were not a violation of state law. As in any other accident investigation, we would ask that Mr. Vitter avail himself to the investigating officer in order for us to obtain a statement from him regarding this incident.\"\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
