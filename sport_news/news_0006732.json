In a conference matchup Tuesday night on the road against the Marshall Owls, the Lady Pirates made it quick by beating the Owls in the first set by a score of 25-7. Meanwhile, in the second set, Marshall put up a little better fight but still fell against Boonville by a score of 25-23. Boonville Lady Pirates volleyball coach Morgan Sprigg said the girls came out ready to play. “With a mistake by myself, the girls played in some different spots on the court,”Sprigg said. “They managed to do very well with it. I was very impressed with them, especially Abbie Lemmons. She stepped up and played some middle and some middle back for me. She was very strong at the net, getting a good amount of kills. She also did well in the back row with the other two playing defense. It was a change, but they did not let it stop them from playing down. During the second set, Marshall came back ready to play. They have improved from the last time that we have played them. This set we started in our normal positions, and seemed to play a little down compared to the first set. We didn’t play as strong as we did the first set and played to their level. I was glad that we got another conference win and a win against a district component. I told the girls that we cannot play down to team’s levels come next week against Hannibal and when districts rolls around. We need to step it up and play to our level. We have some things to work on for this week and next against conferences teams.” Senior Abbie Lemmons led the Lady Pirates, who improved to 18-7-3 overall and 6-1 in the NCMC, with 14 kills on 26 attack attempts along with 13 digs and 11 service points with five aces. Emma Goff, meanwhile, finished the match with 23 assists, nine digs, eight service points with one ace and five attack attempts. Jessica Luscombe added seven kills on 19 attack attempts along with two digs, two service points and one block, Sydnee Poindexter with nine digs, seven service points with one ace, four kills on eight attack attempts and one assist, Kelsi Dillender with 12 digs, three service points, one assist and one kill on six attack attempts, Sophie Taube with seven digs, three service points and one kill on six attack attempts and Brynn Edwards with three attack attempts and one dig. The Boonville Lady Pirates JV volleyball team also won in two straight against Marshall 25-7, 25-23. Boonville JV coach Alex Wendell said the nine missed serves almost cost the girls in the first set. Page 2 of 2 - “The second set we looked much better and seemed to be ready to play,” Wendell said. “Dana Lester hit strongly and placed the ball where the open spots were. I thought that Rachel Lutz was a strong blocker and intimidating at the net.” Shayann Potter led the JV team with nine assists along with seven digs, seven service points with one ace and five kills on 11 attack attempts. Dana Lester had seven kills on 11 attack attempts along with five service points with three aces and one dig while Sara Clinton added seven digs, seven service points with four aces and one kill on five attack attempts, Kileigh Skoufos with nine service points with two aces, six digs and two kills on four attack attempts, Lindsey Harris with three service points with one ace, three kills on nine attack attempts, two digs and one assist, Lawren Luscombe with three digs, two service points with one ace, two kills on nine attack attempts and one block, Rachel Lutz with two kills on six attack attempts, Hannah Gross with two kills on six attack attempts, Kelsey Bishop with seven digs and Brianna Walker with one dig and one attack attempt. In the C-team match, Boonville defeated Marshall 25-18 and 25-13. Wendell said the freshmen girls looked more disorganized than usual in the first game. “The second game went much smoother,”Wendell said. “Kelsey Bishop has really stepped up as a passer and leader in the back row.” Deanna Koa led the C-team with nine service points with seven aces along with one kill on two attack attempts. MJ Goff finished the match with 10 assists along with four service points with three aces, two digs and one attack attempt while Kileigh Skoufos added four service points with three aces and three kills with five attack attempts, Lawren Luscombe with four kills on eight attack attempts and two service points with one ace, Rachel Lutz with two service points with one ace, two kills on four attack attempts, one block and one dig, Kelsey Bishop with three service points with two aces, one kill on two attack attempts and one dig, Grace Bronakowski with two service points with one ace, one assist and one attack attempt and Mackenzie Lutz with one kill on two attack attempts and one service point.
