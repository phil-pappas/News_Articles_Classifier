A final vote total could be announced later Wednesday after balloting ends at a factory in Belvidere, Illinois.\nPlant-level union leaders were summoned to Detroit for a meeting Thursday to decide the next move.\nAbout 40,000 union Fiat Chrysler employees have been working under a contract extension since Sept. 14. The new deal had pay raises but didn't end a lower wage rate for those hired after 2007. Workers also are concerned about shifting car production to Mexico and replacing it with trucks and SUVs.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
