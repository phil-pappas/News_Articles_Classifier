This looked like a win. Sounded like one, too. The scoreboard showed the Indianapolis Colts with 16 points, and the Jacksonville Jaguars with 13. Math can be hard, but not that hard. \nThe Colts won. \nWe could end the story right there, because that’s the most important takeaway from Sunday at Lucas Oil Stadium – the Colts won – but let’s keep going to examine just how silly this notion is: That the occasionally hapless, definitely Andrew Luck-less Colts should be blistered for the way they played against the Jaguars. \nAnd that notion is out there. Check your favorite form of social media – perhaps your own account. It’s a snark-nado of negativity around the Colts, who were outgained by more than 100 yards and lost more turnovers and surrendered more sacks and were able to win this game on Adam Vinatieri’s 27-yard field goal in overtime only because Jaguars kicker Jason Myers, bless his little heart, missed a 53-yarder at the end of regulation and a 48-yarder earlier in overtime. \nIt’s like people expect the Colts to apologize for winning. \n“I’ll never apologize for winning,” says Colts coach Chuck Pagano. \nThere are several layers of truth about this game, one being, yes, the Colts played poorly against a poor team. Another truth: The Colts were lucky they didn’t lose. \nAnother truth: The Colts won with their backup quarterback. \nIn today’s NFL, where there are maybe 25 quality quarterbacks, total, for 32 franchises, it’s a major victory to win a game with the backup. \nMatt Hasselbeck is no ordinary backup, given that he has thrown for more than 35,000 yards and 200 touchdowns and won more than 80 games in his 17-year NFL career. But he is a backup. If he were good enough to start somewhere, he’d be starting in Cleveland or Houston or Philadelphia or Washington or some other team that could use a legitimate NFL quarterback. \nBut one thing we learned Sunday is that Hasselbeck is a workable Plan B for the Colts. Some people thought otherwise during the preseason. After the Colts lost 23-11 to the Bears in August, the following sentence was written by, um, me: \nMatt Hasselbeck is not a workable Plan B. \nOops?
