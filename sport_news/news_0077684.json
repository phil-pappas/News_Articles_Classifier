Ranked No. 25, they were not intimidated by the No. 7 Wolverines. With Fitzgerald’s linebacking leading to a dominant defensive performance and big help from a big trick play — wide receiver D’Wayne Bates throwing to tight end Darren Drexler — they were able to put away the Wolverines, 19-13, for the program’s first win in Ann Arbor in 50 years.\nWEEK 6 PICKS: Michigan or Northwestern?\nBack in Evanston in ‘96, the No. 22 Wildcats made it two in a row in improbable fashion rallying from 16-0 down to shock the No. 6 Wolverines with 17 unanswered fourth-quarter points. Fitzgerald and quarterback Steve Schnur were the catalysts again, culminating in a last-second game-winning field goal by Brian Gowins.\n1997-1999: Where’s the offense?\nFacing a No. 6 Michigan team again in October ’97, the re-rebuilding Wildcats were overmatched, 23-6 against the eventual national champions under Lloyd Carr. In ’98, back in rainy, sloppy then Dyche Stadium, it was Tom Brady and the Wolverines bringing home a 12-6 slugfest. In ’99, after Barnett left to take over at Colorado, the Wildcats were ripped again in Ann Arbor, 37-3. It left everyone wondering if Northwestern was back to being Northwestern.\nMORE: SN Week 6 overall Power Rankings\n2000: Classic Cardiac ‘Cats\nThis was the most thrilling game of the coaching tenure of the late Randy Walker, and that was an era full of wild Wildcat comebacks — see “Victory Right” at Minensota a week earlier — to earn them the appropriate nickname. In a back-and-forth shootout between Northwestern’s Zak Kustok and Damien Anderson and Michigan’s Drew Henson and Anthony Thomas, it took a near-miracle for them to come back from 51-46 deficit in the final minute.\nThen Thomas fumbled with 46 seconds left, and Kustok marched them down a short field quickly to deliver the go-ahead TD to go-to receiver Sam Simmons. The ensuing two-point conversion held up for a 54-51 win after Michigan couldn’t hit a desperation field goal. The result made sure the Wildcats would tie for first in the Big Ten with the Wolverines and Purdue, with a date with future conference opponent Nebraska in the Alamo Bowl.\n2003-2007: Rolled by Carr again\nAfter a two-year layoff from the series, Michigan remembered to resume its domination with wins over a more consistently good Northwestern program in the final few seasons with Carr. The games weren’t close with scores of 41-10, 42-20, 31-17, 17-3 and 28-16 in the Wolverines favor, with the final two marking Fitzgerald’s initial forays as a head coach against them.\nThere were three bowl trips in the first three of those seasons with Walker, but each time, Michigan hit Northwestern with difficult losses late in the conference schedule, hurting what could have been even better years.\n2008: Now who’s the doormat?\nNorthwestern had starting to find its groove again with Fitzgerald, while post-Carr Michigan already was regretting the decision to hire Rich Rodriguez. It wasn’t a coincidence that a strong 21-14 win in Ann Arbor in the penultimate game pushed the Wildcats to another good spot in the Alamo Bowl, seven seasons after their last win in the series, 54-51.\nWhile the Wildcats were on their way back, the Wolverines hit rock bottom with an eight-loss season, five coming at the Big House. In the game, it was quarterback C.J. Bacher and a senior-laden Northwestern team surviving to end the skid at five games.\n2011: Denard digs out of a hole\nNow with the best of the Brady Hoke era in full swing, then No. 12 Michigan slumped to a 24-14 halftime deficit as bad Denard Robinson was a turnover machine (three interceptions). Then good Denard Robinson (responsible for 450 yards and four TDs) went wild as a passer and runner in the second half, while the Wildcats didn’t score again in what turned into a 42-24 Michigan blowout.\nIt was a microcosm of Northwestern’s troubles that season, inconsistency and the incapacity to hold big leads. It was a reminder that Fitzgerald needed to do more to fix the defense more in his image.\n2012-2014: Once, twice, three times a heartbreak\nWith either Kain Colter or Trevor Siemian at quarterback, or both, the Wildcats have fallen just short in the past three meetings.\nIn 2012, the Wildcats were burned by a 53-yard Hail Mary pass from Devin Gardner that set up a game-tying field goal with 2 seconds left, and then lost in overtime, 38-31, at Michigan.\nIn ’13, it was another late-tying boot by Brendan Gibbons and Gardner doing it again, this time in triple overtime, for a 27-19 victory in Evanston. It's just part of Northwestern’s mental and emotional and freefall from the early tough home loss to Ohio State, ensuring the bowl-eligible streak with Fitzgerald would end.\nIn ’14, with the writing on the wall for Hoke in November, the team played an ugly offensive game for three quarters, and down 10-9 after a Siemian to Tony Jones TD pass with 3 seconds left, Northwestern decided to go for the game-winning two-point conversion to eschew another OT disappointment. It didn’t work, either. That one point was the difference between returning to bowl eligibility, considering a big win over Notre Dame followed.\n2015: Fitz and Harbs throw it back\nIt comes full circle to 1995 here. While Fitzgerald was starring on the college field then, Harbaugh was a gritty Pro Bowler with the Colts who had that team on the brink of the Super Bowl.\nNow all these years later, these hard-nosed beloved alums can boast similar physically and mentally strong teams. Northwestern and Michigan, each coming off shutouts, are 1-2 in the nation in scoring defense, and Nos. 5 and 2 in total defense. They are both among the most prolific rushing teams.\nThe difference in the game for Fitzgerald in the game might be — go figure — another superstar linebacker. That’s Anthony Walker for the Wildcats, while the Wolverines have lost their huge playmaker at the position, Mario Ojemudia for the season . Would a big win at the Big House be as critical as it was two decades ago?\nYes. For the Wolverines, it might give them the hype to possibly shocking and knocking off either or both of their rivals, Ohio State and Michigan State. For the Wildcats, it’s a chance to prove skeptics wrong again and a confidence springboard for taking home the West.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657255-college-football-rankings-power-poll-week-6-baylor-ohio-state-tcu-lsu-michigan-state?iadid=HOME%20PAGEFront_List_3", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657541-week-6-college-football-picks-line-michigan-northwestern-cal-utah-alabama-florida", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657326-big-ten-worst-losses-ohio-state-michigan-penn-state-appalachian-state", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657334-big-ten-conference-power-rankings-week-6-northwestern-vs-michigan-ohio-state-michigan-state", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/story/2015-10-06/michigan-lb-mario-ojemudia-torn-achilles-out-for-season", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:52:55.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
