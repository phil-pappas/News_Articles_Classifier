Wellington finished third overall as a team. Lexi Saffell got an unfortunate draw in singles and landed the top-seeded Ramsey, of Collegiate. Saffell lost 6-0, 6-1, but played fairly well against the powerful Ramsey. \"Lexi had several points go to deuce and even got a game off of her,” said head coach Brian Aufdengarten. Abby Lowe received the seventh seed and was able to beat Acosta from Ulysses 6-4, 6-4. In her next match, she played the number two seed, Lair, of Collegiate. Lowe dropped that match 6-0, 6-0 to Lair, who would be the eventual champion on day two. The first win gave Lowe the opportunity to play on day two for a chance at state. Dietra Sober and Madi Lewellen received the number five seed on the doubles side. The pair won its opening match over Allison/Wattemath of Circle 6-4, 6-1. They then faced the fourth-seeded Nussbaum and Cody of Collegiate. Wellington started off well and led 5-3. The match then got loud with several cheers from the crowd. Collegiate tied it up 5-5, then it went to a tiebreak at 6-6, but Collegiate won 7-2. In the second set, Wellington jumped ahead 2-0, but then six straight games. \"Nerves got us in this match; the crowd was loud on many shots and we just lost focus on the match itself,” Aufdengarten said. Sober and Lewellen were still alive on day two, along with Lowe. Mekenna Adams and Madison Adams received the number three seed and had little trouble qualifying for state on day one. The pair beat Keene/Stevens of Wichita Trinity 6-0, 6-0, then before beating sixth seed Norris/Uhlenhop of Andover Central 6-1, 6-1. \"These two just took care of business today, I don't believe we coached them one time, they were on today,” Aufdengarten said. After the Lady Crusaders finished up on the courts, they raced back for the homecoming coronation, making it back in plenty of time. Day two started with all players on the courts at the same time. Lowe had to play the third-seeded Gahagan, who was upset on day one. Gahagan showed her power game and never let Lowe in many points. Lowe dropped the match 6-0, 6-0. \"Abby played so well for us all season, especially playing number one singles as a sophomore,\" Aufdengarten said. Lowe finishes her season 15-15. In another qualifying match, Sober and Lewellen played Keene/Pennington of Wichita Trinity. The Wellington pair came out ready and won the first set 6-0. Suddenly, nerves set in again and the girls found themselves down 4-1. Page 2 of 2 - \"We lost three deuce games in a row and just fell behind,\" Aufdengarten said. Sober and Lewellen fought back to take a 6-5 lead, before going to a tiebreak, losing another one, this time 7-4. After a break between sets, Sober and Lewellen knew they wanted it badly enough and jumped up 5-1. They lost the next game, but held serve to win 6-2 and advance to state. \"We were so proud of them making it; these two we put together about midseason or later and we just had to get them to believe in the doubles,” Aufdengarten said. Sober and Lewellen took care of Morgan/Wicks of Circle 6-0, 6-2 to take fifth at regionals. \"Once they qualified they just had fun and played and did extremely well,\" Aufdengarten said. The Adams sisters started out against second-seeded Little and Maddex of Andover Central, leading most of the first set before giving up three straight games and losing 7-5 in the first set. The second set saw Wellington get out to a 3-1 lead, but Andover Central came back to win 6-4. \"We were a little tight in that match, but Andover Central is a pretty decent team,\" Aufdengarten said. The sisters then defeated Nussbaum/Cody of Collegiate 6-0, 6-1 to finish in third place. \"Wow, what an ending for them. They just played so steady in that last match; it was great just watching a team that needs no coaching and that can take control of a match like that last one,\" Aufdengarten said. The Adams sisters head back to state for the second year, but playing together, while Sober and Lewellen will make their first state appearance.
