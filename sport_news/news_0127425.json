The two countries signed a deal to face each other in the United Arab Republic in December, but you can tear up that sheet of signed paper and dump it into the trash can as it’s obvious India is hesitant to revive the series in the wake of the 2008 attacks in Mumbai that India blamed on militants based across the border. \nIn the past two years Pakistan board chairman Shahryar Khan has worked overtime to keep the series alive but on Wednesday he finally threw in the towel after witnessing first-hand the protest in Mumbai. He said his days of chasing India for the series are over. \nMeanwhile, the Indian government isn’t taking this threat by Shiv Sena lightly. Former Pakistani pace bowlers Shoaib Akhtar and Wasim Akram, who are in India as television commentators for the ODIs between India and South Africa, have been asked to leave the country owing to a looming security threat. \nThe International Cricket Council, the sport’s governing body, is also not taking any chances as it pulled Pakistani umpire Aleem Dar from the ODIs and asked him to return home. \nSEAWAG RETIRES \nVirender Sehwag was one of the world’s most destructive batsmen. Fans jammed stadiums to watch this Indian ace the same way they did when West Indian Viv Richards was at the crease. \nLike Richards, the stocky Indian opening batsman threw caution to the wind from the very first ball and destroyed the reputation of many a bowler with his relentless pounding of the ball. Nicknamed the Sultan of Multan after he carved out a triple century in Pakistan, the 37-year-old announced his retirement from the international scene on Tuesday. \nSehwag had a remarkable career with 17,283 runs and will be remembered for also scoring a triple century in two Tests. Sehwag won the World Cup with India in 2011 and the T20 World Cup in 2007. One of the best tributes came from Indian icon Sachin Tendulkar who said he “had the best seat during most of his superlative performances on the field.’’… Sehwag’s international teammate Zaheer Khan, also 37, called it a day on Monday saying he was “not fit enough to deal with the demands of the modern game.’’ \nIPL TAKES A HIT \nSoft drink giant Pepsi Cola has hit the Indian Premier League for a towering six. The brand that “has been bringing fun and refreshments to consumers for more than 100 years” has withdrawn as the title sponsor of the world’s largest and most lucrative cricket tournament. \nIt was a stunning move since the league has no equal and during its eight years in existence it has grown in stature with massive television viewership. The matches are played to packed stadiums and Pepsi more than doubled the $71 million it invested over the past three years. The brand value of the tournament was $3.2 billion last year, according to American Appraisal India. \nBut in the end all that exposure did not matter as Pepsi turned off its faucets to protect its image rather than see it corroded by its support for a league that been plagued by corruption that’s included match-fixing and under-the-table payments. \nThis move by Pepsi may warn other big sponsors about the snake pit that’s the IPL, but will it affect viewership? The answer is an emphatic ‘no.’ And will another major sponsor jump on board? Chinese mobile telephone giant Vivo stepped in almost immediately as it looks to establish its presence in India. No word on how much Vivo paid to get on board. \nPROTEAS CHASE HISTORY \nEngland takes on Pakistan in the second Test in Dubai on Thursday while Sri Lanka faces the West Indies in Colombo after thrashing the visitors by an innings and six runs in the first encounter. Pakistan escaped with a draw in the first Test thanks to bad light with England only 25 runs away from a win with four wickets in hand … But all eyes on Thursday will be on Chennai where AB de Villiers’ Proteas are a win away from becoming the first South African team to win an ODI series in India’s backyard. South Africa leads the series 2-1 and even if India does draw level the squads move to Mumbai for the finale.
