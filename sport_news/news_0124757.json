Knox (back), probable; WR Domonique Young (concussion), LB Jimmy Herman (hamstring), doubtful.\nMSU: DT Joel Heath (undisclosed), probable; TE Josiah Price (ankle), S RJ Williamson (leg), questionable; OT Kodi Kieler (knee), OT Jack Conklin (knee), LB Drake Martinez (lower body), doubtful; LB Ed Davis (knee), CB Vayante Copeland (fractured vertebra), out.\nHey Joe blog: Checking in on the B1G Contentment Curve Five story lines\nFree Press sports writer Joe Rexrode breaks down five things to watch in Saturday’s game\n1. The race begins: The Spartans are looking for their ninth Big Ten championship and third under Mark Dantonio, and they’ll be looking to improve to 35-24-4 all-time in league openers. This is the third time in Dantonio’s nine seasons at MSU that his team is 4-0 after nonleague play.\n2. Cooking the books: MSU senior quarterback Connor Cook will become the program’s all-time winningest starting quarterback if he can engineer a victory against the Boilermakers. Cook and Kirk Cousins are tied with 27 wins apiece. And Cook has lost just three games, two last season and one in 2013.\n3. Braces and slings: An incredible collection of MSU injuries so far brings added interest to pregame warmups. Left tackle Jack Conklin (knee) has been all but officially ruled out, but two key players who were hurt last week – tight end Josiah Price and safety RJ Williamson – are question marks. MSU figures to rest iffy players until Oct. 17 at Michigan.\n4.Thirty for thirteen: The MSU offense hasn’t hit full speed yet this season, but it’s on a streak of 12 straight games with 30 points or more. That’s a school record and the longest active streak in the nation – Baylor is second with nine straight 30-point games. It’d be a surprise if the Spartans don’t make it 13.\n5. Big doings: This is MSU’s 100th homecoming game – the Spartans are 65-31-3 all-time, including 7-1 under Dantonio – and it’s also the 100th anniversary of the MSU fight song, which was renamed “Victory for MSU” this week. The school will honor its 1965 national championship team on the field during the first time-out.\nPurdue Boilermakers quarterback David Blough (11) hands the ball off to running back D.J.

Close quarters: There’s no comparison between the Purdue and MSU programs since Mark Dantonio arrived in East Lansing. He is 6-0 against the Boilermakers. But Purdue has established itself as the Big Ten Team Most Likely to Give MSU a Surprisingly Close Game. The Spartans had to roar back at home in 2010 for a 35-31 win that allowed them to win their first Big Ten title in 20 years. And Purdue has been right in there the past two seasons as heavy underdogs, losing both games by 14 points but having a shot in the fourth quarter. MSU leads the series 34-28-3 overall. Purdue’s last game against a team ranked No. 1 or No. 2 was a 1999 loss to Penn State – a week after crushing No. 5 MSU, 52-28.\n2. Still searching: It’s still early on the program-building clock for Purdue third-year coach Darrell Hazell, but the nonleague season was a major disappointment for a team hoping to break through and make a bowl game. The Boilermakers had a shot to win at Marshall in the opener, but quarterback Austin Appleby ended that with a late pick for a touchdown. Virginia Tech came to Purdue and rolled in the second half, thanks in large part to special teams mistakes. And then redshirt freshman David Blough gave the Boilers a spark as the new quarterback last week, but Bowling Green was able to drive down the field late for the winning touchdown. Hazell is now 5-23 in his third season. And with a road schedule that includes MSU, Wisconsin, Northwestern and Iowa, the only bowling will be at an alley.\n3. Familiar faces: Dantonio spent the 1981 season at Purdue as a graduate assistant under Jim Young, and MSU receivers coach, Terry Samuel, lettered in 1991-94 as a receiver at Purdue under Jim Colletto. MSU co-offensive coordinator Jim Bollman worked for seven seasons at Ohio State with Hazell under Jim Tressel, and five at OSU with Purdue defensive backs coach Taver Johnson. Bollman was set to join Hazell’s staff before Dantonio hired him to join the Spartans in 2013. And Purdue grad assistant Mark Sheridan is the son of Bill Sheridan, an MSU assistant with Dantonio from 1998 to 2000 and the Detroit Lions’ current linebackers coach.\nJoin our MSU-Purdue live blog Saturday! Joe Rexrode’s scouting report\nWhen MSU has the ball: It’ll be interesting to see how the Spartans do without both starting tackles, as expected Saturday with Jack Conklin and Kodi Kieler both nursing knee injuries. That’s opportunity for Dennis Finley on the left side, but also for a Purdue team with some front-seven talent. Linebacker Ja’Whaun Bentley (40 tackles) is a team captain as a sophomore and a playmaker. The Boilermakers have been up and down, and ultimately not good enough, on defense. This matchup doesn’t look good for them. MSU’s running back rotation is worth watching and needs to be reduced soon.\nWhen Purdue has the ball: Redshirt freshman David Blough took over at quarterback last week and showed plenty of ability. But that was at home against Bowling Green. Can he deal with an MSU defense that has heard all week how it isn’t up to snuff? He’s going to need some help from a rushing attack that ranks 11th in the Big Ten with 164 yards per game. The Spartans are still trying to figure out their best four in the secondary, and coaches are trying to push safety Montae Nicholson to establish himself as one of them.\nPrediction: MSU 44, Purdue 10. The Spartans finally will put things together and obliterate an opponent, with the 1965 MSU national champions on hand to watch a team that has yet to give sustained evidence that it can win it all. Look for Connor Cook to put up big numbers as he becomes MSU's winningest quarterback, and for MSU's defense to swarm Purdue redshirt freshman quarterback David Blough in his first road test.\nCheck out more staff predictions here .\nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com. @joerexrode .
