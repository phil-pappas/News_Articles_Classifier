Casolaro capped off the 5-play drive with a 37-yard touchdown pass to 6-foot-3 wideout Tomasz Radomski to give the Hornets an early 7-0 lead. \nOn the ensuing drive, Hackettstown turned the ball over on the first play from scrimmage, when Michal Radomski intercepted a tipped pass and took it down to the Tigers’ 5-yard line. Two plays later, Hanover Park running back Junaid Olanipekun took a carry into the end zone to extend the lead to 14-0. \n\"We just came out fired up,\" Casolaro said. \"We knew this was a huge game. Last week wouldn't mean anything if we didn't win this week, and we knew that and we came out strong.\" \nHackettstown’s only score of the first half came after a Hanover Park three-and-out. The Tigers drove down the field in seven plays, and scored on the eighth when quarterback Ryan Gallagher completed a 22-yard pass to Joe Renne. \nThe 14-7 deficit was the closest the Tigers got all game. \nAt the start of the second quarter, Casolaro threw his second touchdown pass to Radomski, a 35-yard laser which he tipped to himself and caught over a Tigers cornerback to give the Hornets a 21-7 lead. \nCasolaro ran in the next score, and he threw his third touchdown pass of the night to wide receiver Eric Magnifico. After a successful two-point conversion, the Hornets led 36-7 with three minutes remaining in the half. Casolaro finished with 210 passing yards and four touchdowns. \n\"The linemen kept creating great holes for me to run through,\" Olanipekun said. \"We've been talking about going undefeated since we were sophomores. Overall, everything is just clicking right now.\" \nHackettstown answered first in the second half on a 6-yard touchdown pass by Gallagher to Brendan Finn after a drive that began at its own 20-yard line, but the Hornets responded like they did all game. \nAfter running out the end of the third quarter, Olanipekun began the fourth scoring his second touchdown of the game from eight yards out. Olanipekun finished with over 100 yards rushing and two scores. \n\"Butler is our biggest game of the season,\" Casolaro said. \"Our next game is our biggest game.\" \nStaff Writer Dan Canova: (862) 240-2878; dcanova@gannettnj.com \nHP - Casolaro 37 pass to Radomski (LaShell kick) \nHP - Olanipekun 2 run (LaShell kick) \nHack - Gallagher 22 pass to Renne (Mahal kick) \nHP - Casolaro 35 pass to Radomski (LaShell kick) \nHP - Casolaro 2 run (LaShell kick) \nHP - Casolaro 9 pass to Magnifico (Fortier two-point conversion) \nHack - Gallagher 6 pass to Finn (Mahal kick) \nHP - Olanipekun 8 run (LaShell kick) \nHack - Burke 62 run (Mahal kick) 1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dailyre.co/1RNwWpd TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:28:20.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
