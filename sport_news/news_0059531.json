He is a very important player and he demonstrates it every game,\" added Pellegrini.\nWhile forward Sergio Aguero is set for another month on the sidelines due to a hamstring injury, Pellegrini said he would not use absences as an excuse for not winning.\n\"Obviously Aguero is very important to us but I have a policy of not making excuses for who is missing,\" said the Chilean, adding that Wilfired Bony should be able to slot in instead of him, or beside him when the Argentine returns.\n\"Bony can play with or without Aguero. He can line up alongside him if both are fit, it does not have to be that Aguero has to be missing for Bony to play,\" said Pellegrini.\n\"For various reasons I have not been able to line them up together in the past, but we brought Bony here because he is an important player in his own right.\n\"He is the only forward we have at present so this is his moment, his chance to show what he has got.\"\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:53:53.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
