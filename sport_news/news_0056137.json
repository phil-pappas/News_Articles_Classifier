If he has something bad to tell you he tells you to your face. But he will also give you a kiss and a hug if you have done something right. I like him as a coach but it is important to me that my coaches are good people too and he is. What you see is what you get with him.’ \nMata hinted that United players were now used to their new manager and, with the chaotic nature of the Premier League this season, the club can get their hands on silverware. He said: ‘It’s the second season with Van Gaal and we now know more about him and how he is likely to react to situations. Bit by bit we are gaining an identity as a team again. \n‘All the teams are slipping up here or there. When we faced Arsenal at the weekend we were leaders for the first time in a long time. It would be great to win something; it is what the fans are used to. The principal object is to get into the top four again but it would be fantastic to lift a trophy this season.’ \nMata has been outstanding for United and his club form has made him key to Vicente del Bosque’s plans ahead of Spain’s last two qualifiers against Luxemburg on Friday and Ukraine next week, where one point will see them safely in next year’s finals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:05:06.483+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
