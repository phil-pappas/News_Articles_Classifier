Peshek will lead the AHS football team for the remainder of the season. « » Related Media Chris Peshek will lead the Aspen High School football team for the remainder of the season. Aspen School District officials announced this week that former Aspen head coach Ryan Triece, who had been suspended last week because of his expulsion from a football game, has resigned. School officials met with parents of the Aspen High School football players Monday night, informing them that Triece had stepped down from his position. Triece was suspended for last week’s game by CHSAA rule after he was ejected from the Aspen game against Roaring Fork. He received consecutive unsportsmanlike conduct penalties and then was ejected. Peshek, who took over the AHS football team last week, was named interim head coach for the remainder of the season. Peshek led the Skiers last weekend in a 32-26 thriller of a homecoming loss to visiting Coal Ridge. The Titans eventually won the game when Cameron Chacon ran 90 yards for the go-ahead touchdown late in the game. Teammate Raul Ramirez intercepted an Aspen pass after the Skiers had driven to the Coal Ridge 24-yard line in the closing seconds of the Friday night game. The lead changed hands six times in the Western Slope League nail-biter. The AHS football team (2-4 overall, 0-2 in league play) will travel to Edwards this week for a Friday night game against Battle Mountain (2-3 overall, 1-1 in league). Battle Mountain defeated Roaring Fork 24-14 in Carbondale last weekend. The week before, Battle Mountain lost 24-7 to Moffat County. Aspen will play at Moffat County (4-2 overall, 2-0 in league) on Oct. 23. The Skiers will close the regular season at home against rival Basalt on Oct. 30. Basalt (1-1 in league, 2-4 overall) is coming off a 38-7 loss at Moffat County last weekend. The Longhorns beat Coal Ridge 7-3 in their other conference game. Basalt will host Roaring Fork (3-3, 1-1) on Friday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:08:06.613+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
