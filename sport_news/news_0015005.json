It's the world championship, so the best of the best are there, and the conditions were tougher with the wind, humidity, and heat.\"\nBeecher finished 175th in the 40- to 44-age division, and was satisfied with it.\n\"I was somewhere in the middle of the pack (in the division),\" he said.\nBeecher, who grew up in Canada and Michigan and swam for Bowling Green University, moved to Knoxville in 2004 and began doing triathlons.\nLast year, Beecher qualified for the Kona Ironman with a time of 9:39 in the Ironman Chattanooga.\nWhile he's done dozens of triathlons, Kona was just his fifth Ironman, and it proved to be the most difficult.\nWith his wife, Hester, cheering him on, Beecher began the Kona Ironman among a crowd of about 1,000 competitors in the men's division. They started after the pro men and pro women and before the women's division.\nHis swim was different than other Ironmans and triathlons.\n\"At this race, everyone's pretty darn quick,\" Beecher said. \"My best (stage) is the swim, and there were a lot more people swimming with me. I couldn't break away and get in open water. It was a huge congestion during the swim.\"\nThen Beecher had to deal with wind, heat and humidity.\nTemperatures reached as high as 89 degrees, but the humidity and heat off the road made it feel much hotter during the bike ride and run.\n\"I'm not sure if it's accurate, but I heard it was 124 degrees coming off the asphalt,\" Beecher said.\n\"As the day went on, I could feel the heat off the asphalt on my bike, especially when I was climbing.\"\nIt was just as tough during the run.\nBeecher said he walked through the aid stations, dousing himself with ice water, and at one point told his wife: \"I'm just going to have fun with this race.\"\nSo that's what he did.\n\"In a field like that, I knew I wasn't going to be super competitive,\" Beecher said. \"I figured there's no point in killing myself when I don't have a chance to win my age group. I decided to have fun, enjoy it, and soak in the experience.\"\nDave Link is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:39:54.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
