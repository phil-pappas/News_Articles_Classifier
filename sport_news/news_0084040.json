Class, Status: 1A, Lincoln Trail Conference Representative Playoff Points: 36 Week 9: vs. Princeville (5-3) Minimum Playoff Points: 39 Maximum Playoff Points: 42 Outlook: Stark County is gunning for the top overall seed in Class 1A as the Rebels sit behind only Tuscola (37 playoff points). Orion (7-1) Class, Status: 1A, Clinched Playoff Spot Playoff Points: 25 Week 9: at Riverdale (0-8) Minimum Playoff Points: 27 Maximum Playoff Points: 32 Outlook: Orion's loss to Morrison was a severe blow to its playoff seed because of a low playoff point total. The Chargers are still on track to open with a home game. Princeville (5-3) Class, Status: 1A, Playoff Eligible Playoff Points: 38 Week 9: at Stark County (8-0) Minimum Playoff Points: 41 Maximum Playoff Points: 44 Outlook: The Princes are in good shape to make the playoffs even with a loss to Stark County. The issue is a return trip to Wyoming may be in store in the playoff opener. Knoxville (5-3) Class, Status: 1A, Playoff Eligible Playoff Points: 36 Week 9: at Abingdon-Avon (3-5) Minimum Playoff Points: 38 Maximum Playoff Points: 42 Outlook: Knoxville slipped down to 1A this week but could easily end up slotted in 2A. The worst cases scenario does leave the Blue Bullets out of the playoffs but the overall odds are in their favor. South Fulton (4-4) Class, Status: 1A, Outside Looking In Playoff Points: 35 Week 9: vs. Elmwood/Brimfield (7-1) Minimum Playoff Points: 39 Maximum Playoff Points: 40 Outlook: South Fulton's playoff chances are pretty solid with a victory but the banged up Rebels have to play Elmwood/Brimfield to close the season. It will take a significant upset to get to the postseason. Bureau Valley (4-4) Class, Status: 1A, Outside Looking In Playoff Points: 28 Week 9: at Morrison (3-5) Minimum Playoff Points: 30 Maximum Playoff Points: 34 Outlook: Bureau Valley will need pretty much every 4-4 team in the state to lose on Friday in order to make the cut for the postseason. Losing to Fulton in Week 7 is what put the Storm in this position. Annawan/Wethersfield (7-1) Class, Status: 2A, Clinched Playoff Spot Playoff Points: 41 Week 9: at Mid-County (5-3) Minimum Playoff Points: 44 Maximum Playoff Points: 48 Outlook: The Titans might be bumped down to 1A but right now are looking to get a top seed for the north half of the 2A bracket. United (6-2) Class, Status: 2A, Clinched Playoff Spot Playoff Points: 33 Week 9: at Mercer County (4-4) Minimum Playoff Points: 36 Maximum Playoff Points: 40 Outlook: United is right on the bubble when it comes to getting a home game and with the same enrollment figure as Annawan/Wethersfield might also end up bumped down to 1A. Rushville-Industry (6-2) Class, Status: 2A, Prairieland Black Representative Playoff Points: 31 Minimum Playoff Points: 35 Maximum Playoff Points: 37 Outlook: The Rockets might squeeze into a home opener in the playoffs with a win over Farmington but are guaranteed a difficult road trip with a loss. Farmington (5-3) Class, Status: 2A, Playoff Eligible Playoff Points: 35 Minimum Playoff Points: 36 Maximum Playoff Points: 43 Outlook: A loss to Rushville-Industry and the Farmers put their playoff hopes into the hands of the teams on their schedule. They'll be pulling for teams like Knoxville, Mercer County and Annawan/Wethersfield on Friday. Rockridge (5-3) Class, Status: 2A, Playoff Eligible Playoff Points: 35 Week 9: vs. Kewanee (3-5) Minimum Playoff Points: 38 Maximum Playoff Points: 41 Outlook: Winning at home against Kewanee is the simple route to the postseason. Losing and relying on the records of Sterling Newman Catholic and Hall to beef up the playoff point total is the complicated option. Mercer County (4-4) Class, Status: 2A, Outside Looking In Playoff Points: 44 Week 9: vs. United (6-2) Minimum Playoff Points: 47 Maximum Playoff Points: 49 Outlook: With a playoff point total projected to get close to 50 it's pretty straightforward for the Golden Eagles. Win and you're in, lose and you're out. Elmwood/Brimfield (7-1) Class, Status: 3A, Prairieland Blue Representative Playoff Points: 31 Week 9: at South Fulton (4-4) Minimum Playoff Points: 32 Maximum Playoff Points: 38 Outlook: The Trojans should get a home game to start the playoff if they finish at 8-1. Mid-County (5-3) Class, Status: 3A, Playoff Eligible Playoff Points: 33 Week 9: vs. Annawan/Wethersfield (7-1) Minimum Playoff Points: 36 Maximum Playoff Points: 37 Outlook: Despite it not being a must win situation it's as close as possible to one when Mid-County takes on Annawan/Wethersfield. A lot of things would need to go the Cougars' way if they can't come up with a win at home. Monmouth-Roseville (4-4) Class, Status: 3A, Outside Looking In Playoff Points: 38 Week 9: vs. Monticello (7-1) Minimum Playoff Points: 39 Maximum Playoff Points: 44 Outlook: Fellow West Central member Macomb was competitive in a trip to Monticello earlier in the year which is a good sign for the Titans. The pressure will be on as a loss ends the season. Galesburg (4-4) Class, Status: 6A, Outside Looking In Playoff Points: 37 Week 9: vs. Canton, MI Minimum Playoff Points: 37 Maximum Playoff Points: 45 Outlook: It's hard to believe a team 14 points away from being unbeaten is facing a must win situation in Week 9 just to make the playoffs but that's the case for Galesburg. The Streaks need a win and a little help from the likes of Dunlap, LaSalle-Peru, Marion and the rest of the Western Big 6.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:20:28.273+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
