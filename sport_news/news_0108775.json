By PTI | Posted 1 hour \nManchester: Lot of surprise, some skepticism and a few brickbats followed his decision to quit amateur boxing and star Indian pugilist Vijender Singh will look to live upto the unprecedented hype when he makes his eagerly-awaited professional debut against Britain’s Sonny Whiting here today. \nAlso read: With an Indian mindset, Brit accent, Vijender Singh's ready for pro debut \nIndia’s Vijender Singh faces off with Sonny Whiting during weigh-in ceremony on the eve of his first professional fight in Manchester yesterday \nThe 29-year-old, who scripted history as an amateur by becoming India’s first Olympic and World Championships medallist, is all set to begin a new chapter in his illustrious boxing career. In his debut middleweight pro bout, the strapping six-footer faces a cocky opponent in Whiting, who has promised to put him ‘through hell’. The 26-year-old from Rochester is three-bouts old in the circuit and has a 2-1 win-loss record. \nDespite the verbal provocations, Vijender has remained his usual composed self and has promised to answer every threat with his punches in the ring. \n“I am totally focussed and waiting for the right moment to reply in the ring. I am not at all bothered by his comments. I will reply with my punches,” Vijender said on the eve of the bout. Vijender, who signed up with Queensberry Promotions in July, is not the first Indian to enter the professional arena with the likes of Gurcharan Singh and Pradeep Sihag having been a regular in the circuit earlier. However, never before has an Indian boxer’s professional debut generated this kind of hype. This can largely be attributed to his equally unprecedented success as an amateur boxer, a highlight of which was becoming the world number one in middleweight at one stage. \nSonny Whiting \nThe Haryana-lad would be walking in to a couple of thumping Punjabi songs —‘Singh is King’ and ‘Singh is Bling’— and would look to make sure that the music keep playing at the end of the four round that he will fight today. \n“I am looking forward to a winning start. I am not under any pressure, I am taking this as a responsibility. My performance in professional boxing will open new hopes for young Indian boxers. My strategy is to go in and hit very hard,” he said. Vijender is training under renowned trainer Lee Beard, who is mighty impressed with the Indian’s technical knowledge and power.
