And with each lap, the girls worked toward achieving a personal goal. \nThe team is training for a 5K, but as members of South Side’s Girls on the Run team, they strive for more than just a record time. \n“(Girls on the Run) is not just a running program; it’s a healthy lifestyle program,” Martin said. “The girls can hop, skip or jump as long as they’re moving forward.” \nGirls on the Run is a national nonprofit offering curriculum designed to teach third-, fourth- and fifth-grade girls about mental, physical, emotional and spiritual wellness through running. Teams meet twice a week for 12 weeks, learning about team work and self-esteem and practicing for a 5-kilometer race at the end of the semester. \nThe physical activity component is meant to be fun -- encouraging movement with games relating to that day’s discussion topic, Martin said. \nThis fall, South Side and Hopewell elementary schools and Baden Academy are hosting Girls on the Run teams. \n“The mission is to inspire girls to be joyful, healthy and confident using a curriculum that integrates running,” said Meredith Colaizzi, program and council director for the southwest Pennsylvania chapter. \nDiscussion topics center around self-confidence and building healthy relationships. \nTeams also participate in a community service project of the girls' choosing, Colaizzi said. \nThe organization has about 240 chapters across the United States and Canada, serving more than 1 million girls, Colaizzi said. The southwest Pennsylvania Girls on the Run chapter is based out of Magee-Womens Hospital of UPMC in Pittsburgh. \nOn Dec. 6, girls from all over western Pennsylvania will come together for a 5K at North Park. The race is open to the community, and parents and teachers usually participate, Colaizzi said. \nCoaches -- usually teacher volunteers –- receive training through Magee to teach Girls on the Run curriculum and “helping girls develop their own strengths and mentoring them,” Colazzi said. \nHopewell Middle School and Baden Academy are also offering Heart and Sole, a curriculum for middle school girls, for the first time this fall. \nBoth programs’ emphasis on camaraderie and teamwork is evident after just a few lessons, said Suzie Kuzma, a sixth-grade teacher who coaches Hopewell’s Heart and Sole team. \n“Running is a big part of it, but it’s the smallest part of it,” Kuzma said. “It’s more about relationships and self-awareness and becoming a better girl though all the things we do together as a group.” \nBaden offered the program for the first time last spring and brought it back this fall after enthusiastic response from parents, teachers and students, said Hannah Kimmick, Baden’s head coach. \n“It gives the girls a chance to be themselves without any judgments,” helping them navigate challenges with confidence, she said. \nFor girls such as South Side third-grader Kaylyn Buchanan, the program shows them they can tackle challenges one step at a time. \nBuchanan says she’s excited to run her first 5K, but for today, “I’m trying to get two more hand stamps than last time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T13:27:50.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
