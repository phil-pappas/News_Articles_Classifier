The ballpark became a bit of a target field - photos of Utley superimposed over a bullseye were distributed.\nFans booed fiercely when Utley was introduced. Tejada, using a blue cane with an orange Mets logo, was cheered boisterously.\nNew York City Mayor Bill de Blasio gave his view earlier Monday, pronouncing Utley \"guilty as sin.\"\nUnder the sport's collective bargaining agreement, Utley's hearing is to start within 14 days of Major League Baseball receiving the appeal, and penalties are held in abeyance pending a decision.\n\"I feel like MLB got, you know, maybe a little bit bullied into suspending him. Never happened before. I've seen slides a lot worse,\" Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw said. \"There's a lot of people that have a lot of different opinions about it that probably shouldn't because they're not middle infielders and they have no idea what they're talking about.\"\nJohn McHale Jr., the baseball executive who will hear the appeal, listened to the positions of management and the players' union on timing and is expected to set a date Tuesday.\nInstead of Utley, Los Angeles manager Don Mattingly started Howie Kendrick at second.\n\"Howie's been swinging the bat good, and we feel like he gives us the best chance to win today,\" Mattingly said.\nKendrick was 3 for 8 in the first two games of the series, while Utley went 1 for 2 in a pair of appearances as a pinch hitter. Batting leadoff, Kendrick went 2 for 5 with a three-run, ninth-inning homer.\nMets manager Terry Collins did not expect any attempts by his players to retaliate, and his players complied.\n\"This is too big a game,\" Collins said. \"We can play angry, but we've got to play under control.\"\nRose became a Mets enemy in Game 3 of the 1973 NL Championship Series at Shea Stadium, when he took out shortstop Bud Harrelson trying to break up a double play, leading to a brawl. Fans later threw beer cans, cups and a whiskey bottle toward Rose's left field position, and Cincinnati manager Sparky Anderson pulled the Reds off the field for almost 20 minutes.\nRocker drew ire after he was quoted in a December 1999 Sports Illustrated story he would rather retire than play in New York. He said \"Imagine taking the 7 train ... next to some kid with purple hair, next to some queer with AIDS, right next to some dude who got out of jail for the fourth time.\" That drew him a 14-day suspension, and when he returned to Shea with Atlanta, the Mets limited beers sales to two per person at a time instead of four.\nUtley was penalized Sunday by Joe Torre, MLB's chief baseball officer, who said Utley's takeout was an \"illegal slide.\"\nThe tying run scored on the play, the first of four runs in the inning, and the Dodgers went on to win 5-2 and tie the series at one game apiece. If umpires had ruled the slide illegal, they could have called an inning-ending double play, which would have left the Mets ahead 2-1.\n\"I feel terrible about Ruben's injury,\" Utley said in a statement Monday. \"Now my teammates and I are focused on Game 3 and doing everything we can to win this series.\"\nMcHale had been MLB's executive vice president of administration from 2002 until April, when he received his new title. He has continued his role of hearing appeals of on-field discipline.\nBefore joining the commissioner's office, McHale had been Colorado's executive vice president of baseball operations, Detroit's chief executive officer and Tampa Bay's chief operating officer.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
