It was wide open, and I had great blocking.\"\nActually, Warren's kick return team executed well all night, as Powe seemed close to a big return on earlier kickoffs, only to be denied by Stevenson.\nBut when the Blue Devils (4-2, 4-0) needed it, Powe & Co. came through. And then it was up to the Warren defense to protect the slim lead.\nStevenson quarterback Jack Sorenson, a starting wideout on the 2014 championship team, moved the Patriots to the Warren 43-yard line. Then, quicker than the time it took Powe to return the kickoff to the end zone, Stevenson's threat ended as Armour got his hands on a pass near the Warren 20.\nStevenson (3-3, 1-2) used its timeouts to get one final shot at the win, and Stocker ended that with his pick on the final play.\n\"These kids have come ready to play. They rally and overcome,\" Warren coach Bryan McNulty said. \"We told them there would be adversity in this game. We knew this game would be a see-saw, but we emphasized, 'Stay in the fight.' and we did.\"\nStevenson led 7-0 after a quarter on Sorenson's 1-yard run. Warren went up 10-7 on a 33-yard touchdown pass from Kyle Debevec to Nicholas Marcinkus, and a 21-yard field goal by Brandon Hergenreder.\nStevenson then went up 14-10 at the half on Henry Marchese's 4-yard TD pass from Sorenson with 35 seconds on the clock.\nA TD run by Darrius Crump (26 carries, 155 yards) gave Warren a 17-14 lead, but Tyler Vincent (13 carries, 171 yards) raced 80 yards from scrimmage to flip the game back in Stevenson's favor at 21-17.\nCrump's second TD run made it 23-21 with 6:09 left in the game, and Vincent's 5-yard TD run put Stevenson up 27-23 and set the stage for Powe.\nDebevec finished 12-for-20 passing for 160 yards. Sorenson was 15-for-26 for 180 yards, with Marchese catching 10 of the throws.\nNext Friday night, Warren plays at Libertyville (6-0, 4-0), the NSC Lake title will be on the line.\nWarren may win, or it may not. But Libertyville definitely cannot count on the Blue Devils panicking because the big-game lights are too bright.\n\"We talked about working hard, focusing and doing our assignments all week,\" Crump said. \"In the second half, it showed we wanted it more. They gave us a fight, but we pulled it out.\n\"We play with heart, and we'll show Libertyville that next week.\"\nDavid Perry is a freelance writer for the News-Sun.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Lake County News-Sun High School Football Sports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T09:21:21.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
