Game 1 starter. For decades, baseball strategy has dictated that Game 1 pitchers in a seven-game series are also in line to start Game 5 — and in rare cases, Game 4, although it is all but assured the Mets would not start Harvey three times in a series this year. “Going into a seven-game series and having the opportunity to line up for two games, I couldn’t be happier and more ready for it,” Harvey said. Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson was a little more cautious, saying Friday that how much Harvey pitches would depend on how he feels after Saturday. Collins, however, was unambiguous. When asked if he planned on pitching Harvey beyond Game 1, Collins replied, “Absolutely.” Photo Collins credited Maddon for introducing him to using computers for strategizing.

In a telephone interview, he said he expected Harvey to take his normal turns through the rotation as long as the Mets are alive in the postseason, a significant reversal from his stance last month, perhaps in deference to Harvey’s wishes. “I expect Matt to pitch as the Mets determine if and when he should pitch,” Boras said. Meanwhile, as Cubs hitters took their swings on Friday, Ramirez, his facial hair now peppered with gray specks, kept an eye on the proceedings from left field while dressed in a hoodie sweatshirt. Last February, the Cubs hired Ramirez as a hitting consultant. At the time, Epstein said Ramirez would consult the Cubs at least once a month, but his presence has been far more frequent lately. Young hitters like Kyle Schwarber and Jorge Soler have praised Ramirez for his guidance. Ramirez did not appear to be talking on Friday, but both managers, who are effusive by baseball standards, certainly were. The two men go back some. Their first in-depth conversation came at a hotel in Phoenix, when Collins decided to bring on Maddon as his bench coach when he managed the Anaheim Angels in the late 1990s. When Collins resigned in 1999, Maddon replaced him as interim manager. “We had a really good relationship on the bench, really good,” Maddon said. Collins also credited Maddon for introducing him to using computers for strategizing. Maddon, however, said he would use the “eyeball test” for scouting Harvey in Game 1, perhaps to put to use in a return matchup. As for how Harvey might do in Game 1, Collins vouched that “he’s ready for it.” He added, “I think he’ll pitch well.” A version of this article appears in print on October 17, 2015, on page D2 of the New York edition with the headline: History and Intrigue Imbue the Mets-Cubs Series With Extra Flavor.
