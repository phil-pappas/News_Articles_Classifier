Lee on Friday and must win to even get into the 7A playoffs. \nState powerhouse Hoover also reached unusual depths after a loss to Vestavia Hills, its second in three weeks. \nThe Bucs (6-2) spiraled to seventh, their worst showing since 2011. Hoover has spent just three weeks at seventh -- or worse -- since the beginning of the 2001 season. \nThree of the new teams to this week's poll haven't been ranked in some time. \nClass 7A Hewitt-Trussville was last ranked in 2005, Class 3A Winfield hasn't been included since 2008 and Class 1A Decatur Heritage is ranked for the first time in school history. \nThe Eagles first fielded a varsity team in 2010. This year, Decatur Heritage (7-1) has won seven games in a row and can win the 1A, Region 8 championship with a win Friday over Phillips-Bear Creek. \nSTATE RANKINGS \nThis week's Alabama Sports Writers Association rankings with first-place votes in parentheses, win-loss record, poll points and position in last week's poll : \nCLASS 7A \nTeam (first place), W-L, Pts., Pvs. \n1.
