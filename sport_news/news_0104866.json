Kenseth hit the outside wall and damaged the suspension in his No. 20 Toyota. Ultimately, he would slam the outside wall and drop out of the race. \nThe resulting 42nd-place finish left Kenseth at the bottom of the Chase standings, 32 points behind eighth-place Brad Keselowski with only two opportunities — at Kansas and Talladega — either to advance to the Eliminator 8 Round by winning or to make up that enormous points deficit. \nBut for Kenseth, it’s business as usual. \n“For me, it’s really no different,” Kenseth asserted before Friday’s opening Sprint Cup practice at Kansas Speedway. “We show up and try to do the best we can every week. Same this week. \n“Obviously, a win moves you on, but I don’t feel like it’s a must-win. It would make it easier if we could win. (But we’ll) just try to do the best we can to qualify as good as we can and hopefully start up front and get working on the race (in Saturday’s practice) and hopefully be up front Sunday.” \nThere’s one statistic that could mitigate in Kenseth’s favor in the Hollywood Casino 400. He’s the only driver to have won twice at Kansas since the track was repaved in 2012. \nCarefree Logano Has A Two-Week Reprieve From Stress \nUnlike the 11 other drivers he’s battling for the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship, Joey Logano can relax and enjoy the next two races on the schedule. \nLogano won last Sunday at Charlotte, ensuring he’ll be one of the eight drivers in the Chase’s Eliminator 8 Round, which starts Nov. 1 at Martinsville Speedway. \n“I was sitting at the house on Monday night, and I was watching ‘Race Hub’ (on Fox Sports 1), and I was like ‘Man, this feels great. Everyone else is stressed out in this garage, except us right now.’ \n“That’s something to be proud of and something we need to take advantage of. That stress will wear a lot of teams out, as we’ve seen, so right now it’s an important time for us to take these next two weeks, enjoy them, but still go out there and try to win the race.” \nIn fact, that’s the best strategy for keeping the pressure on his adversaries. Logano is the defending winner of the Hollywood Casino 400 at Kansas, and if he repeats on Sunday, he’ll keep the blood pressure of all his competitors pegged as the series moves to Talladega on Oct. 25. \nWDUN will have live MRN Radio coverage of Sunday's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series Hollywood Casino 400 from Kansas Speedway beginning at 1 pm on 102.9 FM and 550 AM.
