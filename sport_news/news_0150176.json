Ridge also placed first in the Girls Varsity B race with 61 points and an average of 19:56. \nSenior Robert Whitney and sophomore Chris Romero finished in first and second in the Varsity C race, respectively, with times of 16:13 and 16:18. Senior Brendan McGill (fourth place, 16:44), junior Evan Minor (seventh place, 16:55) and senior Matt Vira (eighth place, 17:07) also paced the Vikings. \nSenior Sophie Spring (third place, 19:32), junior Catherine Giuseffi (ninth place, 19:50), junior Claire Jones (10th place, 19:51), sophomore Caitlin Haggard (19th place, 20:11) and junior Shayna Bains (22nd place, 20:19) fueled the Red Devils. \nFor the Vikings, it was an absolutely dominating performance despite the cold and rainy weather. \n“With the weather the way it was, I didn’t expect much time wise,” Whitney said. “It was a nice surprise the way we ran.” \nThere was a significant drizzle throughout the day and wind at times was difficult to manage, but the Vikings adapted and came out on top. \n“The course wasn’t too bad, but in the beginning with the sloping uphill, I could feel my feet slipping a bit,” Whitney said. “Still, we had the fastest team average which is a really good indicator for the rest of the season.” \nOne of the first big meets of the year, the Coaches Invitational is a good place to shine and set up for the rest of the season. The Vikings did just that. \n“I have a lot of expectations for this team,” Whitney said. “As long as we stay healthy and keep pushing, we’ll do well.” \nThe Red Devils were unable to get an individual winner, but their team result was just the same as the Vikings which is all that matters to the runners \n“We wanted to work on staying in a pack, and our goal was to win,” Spring said. “We approached it like any other race.” \nLike the Vikings, the Red Devils also have set lofty expectations for themselves. They feel like Saturday’s meet was a good jumping-off point. \n“This is the first meet that we really think is important, so we had a couple good weeks of training,” Spring said. “With county and conference coming up, we have the same goal as this meet, and that’s to win.” \nOther local winners: \nHillsborough won the Varsity A girls race with 115 points and a 20:25 average. Senior Paige Novak (eighth place, 19:40), senior Stephanie Mauer (17th, 20:14) and sophomore Chloe Wong (22nd, 20:28) paced the Raiders. \nIndividually, Delaware Valley senior Hannah Bonaguidi struck gold in the A race with a time of 18:40, easily outrunning runner-up Christina Rancan of West Windsor-Plainsboro South (19:03). \nHunterdon Central won the Varsity A-2 boys race with 96 points and a 17:00 average. Sophomore Justin Cornetta (third place, 16:15), senior Andrew Dyer (seventh, 16:53) and junior Ryan Eville (eighth, 16:55) paced the Red Devils. \nIn Varsity E girls, New Providence won with 69 points and a 21:06 average. Senior Jillian Turned led the Pioneers with a fourth-place finish in 20:06. Union Catholic took second with 73 points as senior Amari Onque Shabazz crossed the line third in 20:02. \nIn Varsity F girls, Pingry sophomore Anna Wood finished first in 20:32, 13 seconds ahead of runner-up Mary Lynch of Villa Walsh. Pingry was second overall with 55 points, behind Villa Walsh’s 33. \nStaff writer Daniel LoGiudice: dlogiudice@gannettnj.com 2 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1LaRTsR TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T04:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T06:11:13.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
