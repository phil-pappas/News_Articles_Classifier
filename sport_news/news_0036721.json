He will be my captain tomorrow evening,\" Hodgson said on Sunday. \nIt will be the first time the Everton centre-back has captained his country. \nJagielka, 33, will earn his 37th cap against the Baltic nation. \nHaving already secured top spot in Group E, Hodgson decided to release Rooney, Cahill, Michael Carrick, James Milner and Joe Hart to their clubs after the win over Estonia at Wembley. \nIf England win, they will qualify for next summer's finals in France with a 100 per cent record.
