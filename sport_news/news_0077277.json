Jones got his first victory against them on Dec. 3, 2013 when he foiled all nine shootout tries in a 3-2 victory.\nWith Quick entrenched in Los Angeles for the foreseeable future, the Kings traded Jones to Boston and the Sharks promptly got him from the Bruins as the successor to Antti Niemi. Jones has started to win over the fans at SAP Center.\nIn the first period, Jones made a point-blank save on Jiri Sekac from the high slot after Rickard Rakell set up his winger with a perfect pass to the middle. In the second period, it was a high-grade rebound attempt by Perry that was denied and a backhand try by Sekac that was foiled.\nThe Sharks are trying to rebound from missing the playoffs last season. In addition to bringing in Jones, they made their biggest change in breaking ties with longtime coach Todd McLellan and hiring veteran Peter DeBoer.\nDeBoer has the Sharks going early. San Jose started off with a dominating 5-1 win over the Kings on Wednesday night and it gradually took control of Saturdayâs game after a slow start.\nAnd if Jones gives them the kind of goaltending that heâs shown so far, the Sharks could find themselves back in the postseason mix. Right now, the Ducks have to find a way to get the edge on their northern rival after losing four of five matchups last season.\nâOf course, in the long run the divisional games will take on more meaning because youâll be able to see lights at the end of the tunnel and the point differentials here,â Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau said. âBut I think for us, itâs getting off on the right foot.\nâI think weâve worked hard as a group in training camp. And weâre playing a team that we thought was very impressive against Los Angeles the other night. Itâs going to be a tough battle.â\nBoudreau stuck to his plan of having offensive stars Perry and Ryan Getzlaf play on different lines. Perry was effective in the third forward grouping with Sekac and Rickard Rakell, while Getzlaf and linemates Carl Hagelin and Chris Stewart generated little.\nThe experiment that took place all throughout the preseason ended midway through the third when Boudreau put Getzlaf and Perry back together.\nContact the writer: estephens@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:27:48.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
