They combined for 71 points. Thompson and Green each finished with 14. \nTRAIL BLAZERS: Forward Al-Farouq Aminu and his wife Helina, welcomed their first child, Emanah, who was born Monday night. Aminu started against the Warriors, finishing with 11 points in his debut as a Blazer. \nCJ AT POINT: Blazers Coach Terry Stotts said it was important to get a look at CJ McCollum at point guard, spelling starter Damian Lillard.
