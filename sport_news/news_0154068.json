It was a fantastic goal.' \nThe Swansea City manager whose side lost on the road to Southampton last weekend was pleased with the overall performance of his team against visitors Tottenham Hotspur. \nHe said of the game:'I'm pleased with the performance. We have had a couple of performances below our standard, but we were much more like ourselves today. \n'We wanted to get back on track, and the players were excellent today - you could see their passion and desire to win that game. \n'Every single one of them performed well, including the substitutes that came on. \n'Part of me is disappointed that we didn't take three points. Had we not have conceded those free-kicks, we'd have probably won the game. \n'We had chances to win it at the end, but if you're honest I think it could have gone either way. \n'Tottenham have great quality, are in good form and are a tough side to play against, but it was pleasing to see that we matched them. \n'We just need to find that consistent level of performance, which was our biggest strength last season.'
