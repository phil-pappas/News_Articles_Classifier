And the way junior forward Aerial Powers (21.9 points per game last season) and junior guard Tori Jankoska (17.5) dragged the Spartans to a 16-15 finish last season resulted in some Thursday respect: MSU was picked third in the preseason Big Ten coaches poll, behind league favorite Maryland and Ohio State.\nThat's not what the Spartans are thinking.\n\"That's OK, we've just got to prove people wrong,\" said Powers, who earned All-America honors as a sophomore and should be ready for the season despite recent foot soreness. \"I think we're gonna be way better than people think.\"\nThe Spartans are deep now, after getting down to seven players overall and five scholarship players last season. Senior center Jasmine Hines leads the talented supporting class for preseason All-Big Ten honorees Powers and Jankoska, and newcomers include 5-foot-8 point guard Morgan Green of San Jose, Calif.\nMerchant called Green \"super athletic\" and \"amazing\" with the ball.\n\"She's really good,\" Powers said. \"She's quick, she's quick defensively, too. And she can see the floor really, really well. So any mismatches, she'll already know and be able to break the defense down. She loves to pass.\"\nMerchant said she's running three teams in practice for the first time in a long time and that, if the Spartans stay healthy, \"we have a chance to do some things.\"\n\"We're gonna be able to run teams down,\" Powers said, \"like they were doing us last year.\"\nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com.
