(AP) — The Houston Astros beat the Kansas City Royals at their own game Thursday night, relying on sharp pitching from Collin McHugh and stingy defense behind him for a 5-2 victory in the opener of their AL Division Series. \nMcHugh (1-0) allowed four hits, including a pair of solo homers by Kendrys Morales, while pitching around a 49-minute rain delay. The right-hander lasted six innings before turning the game over to his bullpen, which scattered just three runners over the final three frames. kAm%@?J $:AA[ (:== w2CC:D 2?5 ~=:G6C !6C6K 8@E E96 82>6 E@ {F<6 vC686CD@?[ A2CE @7 ~2<=2?5VD H:=5\\42C5 4@==2AD6 :? z2?D2D r:EJ =2DE J62C] w6 92?5=65 E96 ?:?E9 E@ 62C?
