These five sectors accounted for around 65% of the country's total merchandise exports in 2014-15. In August last year, exports of these sectors stood at $17.79 billion. While engineering, petroleum and textiles recorded negative growth, gems and jewellery and pharmaceuticals registered a marginal growth of 2.66% and 6%, respectively, during the month under review, according to the provisional data of the Commerce Ministry. In 2014-15, exports of these segments stood at $202.15 billion. The country's total exports were aggregated at $310.5 billion in the last financial year. Federation of Indian Export Organisations (FIEO) said these are labour-intensive sectors and government should announce steps to contain the dip in outbound shipments. Decline in exports has been instrumental in dragging down India's overall merchandise exports.
