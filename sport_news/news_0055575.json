Interestingly ex-Seahawks Golden Tate and Bryan Walters round out the tenth and honorable mention spots.\n— Current Top 10 safeties in the league—Earl Thomas with a 90.2 overall rating good for third.\n— Grade recaps from the Week 6 Seahawks and 49ers games.\nSignature Stats:\n— Russell Wilson continues to excel while passing under pressure—he currently ranks fourth with a 77.8% accuracy rate under duress. Colin Kaepernick is on the opposite end of the spectrum, ranking second-to-last with only at 48.9%. The 49er defense allows the opposing QB 2.86 seconds to throw this year, slightly up from 2.81 last year. Their 2.86 seconds is third-most so Wilson, along with his scrambling ability, should theoretically have more time to throw.\n— That being said, pressure from the Niners front has been nonexistent this year. Starting DEs Glenn Dorsey and Quinton Dial are 43rd and 44th in 3-4 DE pass rush productivity…there are only 49 eligible DEs. Starting DT Ian Williams only has a 2.6 PRP which is 53rd of 63.\n— Kaepernick uses play action on 28.7% of his dropbacks, third-most for QBs. His -6.1% completion differential with and without play action is way below average but his YPA for both are about league average.\n— Wilson’s 119.0 QB rating when his time in the pocket exceeds 2.6 seconds is the third-highest among QBs, behind only Tom Brady and Ben Roethlisberger.\n— Doubt he plays but newly resigned C Lemuel Jeanpierre last year had a pass block efficiency of 97.9 on 105 snaps. This year, Drew Nowak is at 96.4 while Patrick Lewis is at 95.6, both of whom are in the bottom-third among Cs.\n— Erik Pears is one of the worst RTs currently grading at -11.2. The Avril/Bennett combination should have a field day against him and at the very least, make the Niners cheat to their right side, opening up space for other guys on the weak side. Grade-wise they’re a combined +12.5 with 35 pressures*.\n— Richard Sherman has been targeted 35 times by SF QBs and while he has allowed 13 receptions, he also has four INTs, resulting in a miniscule 18.6 QB rating in the Russell Wilson era.\n— The current weather report shows no high winds and a comfortable 75F at kickoff. Niners kickoff man Bradley Pinion has an average kickoff distance of 73.3, second-best in the league. He’s had 22 of 27 KOs go for touchbacks and thus could neutralize Tyler Lockett and his 26.5 KO return average.\n \nBob Condotta : 206-515-5699 or bcondotta@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @bcondotta .
