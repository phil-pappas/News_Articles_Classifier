Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 10:03 pm | Updated: 10:09 pm, Tue Oct 13, 2015. Pell City's Ross is The Daily Home's Player of the Week By LAVONTE YOUNG, Home sports editor Annistonstar.com PELL CITY -- Jermaine Ross earned The Daily Home Player of the Week award for his performance in Pell City’s heartbreaking, 28-21 loss to Oxford in high school football Friday. “I am surprised; I didn’t know,” Ross said. “I would like to thank my linemen because I wouldn’t have been able to have a big game without them and the coaches. I give them all of the credit. We have a big game on Friday against Chelsea, so we have to step up. I have to be a leader for this team, and we have to try to get this win.” Behind the stellar play of the Panthers’ offensive line, Ross was able to exploit Oxford’s defense for 216 yards and three touchdowns on 17 carries while splitting times at quarterback. The sophomore had touchdown runs of 81, 55 and 4 yards. “We knew going into the game that we had to establish the run,” Pell City head coach Brooks Dampeer said. “We were going to try to find out what they were doing and take what they were giving us. “Quarterback isolation has been a good play for us. Jermaine had a big, long run for 81 -yards. Later in the game, we ran the same play, and they slanted that way, and he hit it out to the back door. “The thing is we have to get better on ball security. The defense did a good job of not giving points on (our four) turnovers, but we lost four opportunities to score some points. It was good to see Jermaine have a good game, it takes the pressure of the running backs.” Pell City (3-4, 1-3) has been in position to win a pair of close games this season, but missed field goals or late lapses on both sides of the ball have proved to be costly. Ross said the Panthers will have to do a better job of executing against Chelsea and Valley if they are going to make the postseason. “We have to finish strong,” Ross said. “We all have to work on our ball security in the backfield. I made a mistake and fumbled. That could have been a touchdown right there and that could change the outcome in the game. I have to work on that for the rest of the season. “ Ross, who has been playing football since he has 10, said making the transition from defensive back to quarterback was not difficult. The Panthers’ playmaker said if he is fortunate to play college football in a few years, he would choose to play on the defensive side of the ball “I played quarterback in junior high, so it really wasn’t that big of transition,” Ross said. “When I go to college, I want to play DB (defensive back). Ross said he looks up to three-time Super Bowl MVP quarterback Tom Brady of the New England Patriots. “I really like Tom Brady,” Ross said. “He is a leader on the field and he is a game-changer.” \nRoss will lead the Panthers into battle against Chelsea on Friday at 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:07:39.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
