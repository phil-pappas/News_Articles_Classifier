His last such gig, leading the Anaheim Angels, had ended miserably, Collins resigning with 29 games left and his team, overrun by injuries and a volatile clubhouse, 28 games out of first place.\nThen-Angels general manager Bill Bavasi tabbed Collins' bench coach of three years as the team's interim manager. That bench coach was Joe Maddon, the eccentric Chicago Cubs skipper whose team will face Collins' in the National League Championship Series that begins Saturday night at Citi Field.\n\"T.C. and I go way back,\" Maddon said before his team worked out Friday afternoon at Citi Field.\nCollins' and Maddon's relationship actually dates longer than the 1997 to 1999 seasons they spent together in Anaheim. Each worked his way through the managerial ranks starting in the minor leagues in the early '80s. \"Guys like Joe and I [who] spend as long as we did in the minor leagues, you get to know those guys,\" Collins said.\nMore coverage VOTE: Was Chase Utleyâ€™s takeout slide dirty?

Buy Phillies jerseys and other gear WATCH: Daily fantasy baseball updates When Bavasi gave Collins carte blanche to hire his coaching staff with the Angels, Collins first interviewed those already within the organization. Maddon had been on the team's major-league staff the season before, and after interviewing him Collins came away \"extremely impressed with his organization, his preparation, his thoughts,\" he said.\n\"[I] had a great time with him,\" Maddon said. \"We had a really good relationship on the bench, really good.\"\nTheir time together in Anaheim coincided with the beginning of \"the computer age in baseball,\" Collins said, and \"Joe was into the computers.\" Maddon recalls a time, before defensive shifts were commonplace, when he approached Collins with charts displaying the results of Ken Griffey Jr's at-bats and asked if they could implement a shift against the Seattle Mariners star in that night's game.\n\"He always gave me a lot of latitude, permitted me to work,\" Maddon said of Collins. \"The thing about being a bench coach for him that I was always impressed with was, if I had a bunch of information, I would just stand there and I would read it to him, I'd talk to him about it before the game, and he would never forget anything.\n\"He's got a really great mind. So we laughed together, we worked together. I'm really happy for his success.\"\nMaddon stayed with the Angels - he was Mike Scioscia's bench coach from 2000 to 2005 - until the Tampa Bay Rays hired him as manager before the 2006 season. The Hazleton, Pa., native spent nine seasons with the Rays, leading them to the 2008 World Series and three other postseason appearances, before taking the Cubs job last October.\nAfter resigning in Anaheim, Collins, who had previously managed the Houston Astros from 1994 to 1996, waited much longer for his third opportunity as a big-league skipper. He was the director of player development for the Los Angeles Dodgers, the team his Mets just dispatched in the National League division series, in 2005 and 2006, and managed the Orix Buffaloes in Japan in 2007 and 2008. He joined the Mets in 2010 first as a minor-league field coordinator.\nNow, Collins, 66, and Maddon, 61, meet again, each at the helms of teams that were not expected to contend this season. Two of the major league's three oldest managers - the Phillies' Pete Mackanin, 64, is second to Collins - Collins and Maddon are each contenders for NL manager of the year honors. Maddon, who has the Cubs four wins from their first World Series appearance since 1945, is probably the favorite to take home the award.\n\"He always had an idea, always had a thought,\" Collins said of Maddon. \"Nobody was more thrilled than I was when he finally got his chance in Tampa Bay because we became very good friends, and I relied on him a lot. Obviously he's become extremely successful, and I'm real, real happy for him and real proud of him.\"\nkaplan@phillynews.com\n@jakemkaplan", "external_links": ["http://philly.stats.com/mlb/teamstats.asp?team=22&type=stats", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=article&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FMLB_Philadelphia_Phillies"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:17:07.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
