Their lawyers have reached agreements with prosecutors to modify the conditions of their pre-trial release.\nAfter initially locking up more than 170 people in connection with the 17 May incident outside Twin Peaks restaurant, McLennan prosecutors have not charged anyone with the shooting deaths of nine people. At least 20 others were hurt.\nThose arrested were charged with engaging in organised criminal activity.\nMcLennan prosecutors did not return messages from the newspaper seeking comment. But defense attorneys suggested the district attorney’s office eventually plans to dismiss charges against at least some defendants.\n“We are starting the letting-go process, although they are not admitting they did something wrong,” said one attorney, Adam Reposa of Austin.\nThe shootout in the parking lot of the restaurant erupted during an apparent confrontation between rival biker gangs.\nInvestigators have not yet offered details about who shot whom or whether police officers fatally shot anyone, though reports reviewed by the Associated Press indicate police bullets did hit at least one biker.", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1FNIbMY"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T23:05:47.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
