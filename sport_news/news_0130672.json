Here are rookies doing good work outside the spotlight:\n1. Defenseman Ben Hutton (Vancouver Canucks): A former fifth-round pick who played college hockey at Maine, Hutton, 22, is playing almost 19 minutes per game for the better-than-expected Canucks, who are 3-1-1. Only two other rookies are playing more minutes than Hutton. He has three assists, and is plus-2 in five games.\n2. Center Mattias Janmark (Dallas Stars): He came over from the Detroit Red Wings in the Eric Cole trade last season. He has four points in five games, and has provided depth for the vastly-improved Stars.\n3. Defenseman Colton Parayko (St. Louis Blues): He’s 6-5, 225 pounds and likes to hammer the puck. Parayko wasn’t projected to make the Blues roster this season, but he forced his way onto to the team with his strong play in the preseason. He has eight shots on goal, and is averaging 17:47 minutes per game.\n4. Left wing Anthony Duclair (Arizona Coyotes): His skating and scoring touch were sorely needed on a team that ranked second-to-last last season in scoring. He has four goals and six points in five games this season. He gives the team hope for the season and future.\n5. Center Oscar Lindberg (New York Rangers): At 23, Lindberg was essentially at a crossroads with the Rangers coming into the season. He was either going to make the team or end up on a different team through waivers. He made the Rangers, and has delivered four goals in five games. He’s a plus-5. His improved scoring touch was evident in the American Hockey League last season, when he scored 28 goals.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:20:40.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
