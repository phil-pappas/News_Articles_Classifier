Additionally, WSO2 will provide Accelalpha with technical, sales and marketing support to promote adoption and help customers achieve the high availability, high performance, and flexibility they require for IT and business agility.\n“From our experience in implementing business applications, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), master data management (MDM), and customer relationship management (CRM), we know that these applications do not communicate with one another out-of-the-box or share master data, business rules, and transactions. Trying to solve this with point-to-point or database-level integrations often results in incomplete or non-scalable solutions. This in turn leads to inefficiencies, including identical data stored in multiple locations, lack of process automation, and unnecessary manual efforts,” said Accelalpha Vice President of Consulting Erik Assink. “We passionately believe that WSO2 open source middleware allows for system integrations within or across organizations, and will simplify and automate business processes to the greatest extent possible.”\n“Accelalpha brings strong expertise in implementing enterprise application and integration solutions for some of North America’s leading enterprises,” said WSO2 Senior Director of Partnerships Nirosh Perera. “Through our partnership, we are combining Accelalpha’s proven best practices with the flexibility of our comprehensive, modular WSO2 platform to deliver solutions that empower these organizations to maximize their business and IT agility.”\nAbout Accelalpha\nAccelalpha provides business and IT consulting services in North America and has an excellent delivery track record with Fortune 100 companies spanning diverse industries.
