McCoy returned to practice last week, and will start after being nagged by a pulled left hamstring he initially injured during training camp. \nBuffalo is still without backup running back Karlos Williams, who will miss his second straight game with a concussion. \nStarting receiver Sammy Watkins is active after missing two weeks with a right calf injury. However, receiver Percy Harvin has been ruled out because of a hip injury. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:27:37.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
