It also gives me a chance to pair him with Palmer. Evans is simply due to produce and is facing a weak Jacksonville secondary. Benjamin was taken with hopes of Cleveland being forced to play catch up and because of how poor the Baltimore secondary has been at times this season. Maclin is starting to become a real weapon for Kansas City. \nDaniels is facing an Oakland defense that has struggled against tight ends. \nThe Chiefs are an average defense, but love the matchup against a horrid Chicago offense. \nBENGALS FANTASY VALUE \nEach week I rate the Bengals fantasy players value on the following system: touchdown means must play; field goal means it's a good play; first down means play only if you have to play him; punt means don't play at all: \nTouchdown (must play): The Bengals have been fantastic offensively this season, but they are facing a defense that hasn't allowed a touchdown in the last two games. \nField Goal (good play): WR A.J. Green (he is a must-play virtually every week, but this isn't one of them; iwould be hard to believe you have two receivers better than Green on your roster and if you do and that's all you need to start then maybe it's time to sit Green, otherwise you should probably play him). QB Andy Dalton (he's off to a great start and despite the defense he is facing he's probably a better play than any other quarterback you might have); RB Jeremy Hill (had three touchdowns against Kansas City and is top candidate around the goal line, but wouldn't expect a lot from him this week); TE Tyler Eifert (he is arguably a top five fantasy tight end so would be hard to believe you have someone better on your roster, but after big opener has just seven receptions for 118 yards in last three games combined); Defense/Special Teams (if your league counts sacks then this would be a very good play, because Seattle allowed 18 sacks in the first four games, plus the Seahawks aren't exactly an offensive juggernaut). \nFirst Down (play only if you have to play him): RB Giovani Bernard (has been outstanding in his role the first four games and had a TD last week, but not a lot of fantasy value); K Mike Nugent (he's a candidate to be a solid producer each week because of the Bengals offense); WR Marvin Jones (he was a major disappointment in the Kansas City game dropping a 54-yard TD pass and is facing one of NFL's best secondaries);. \nPunt (don't play at all): WR Mohamed Sanu (he just doesn't get enough targets to justify it). \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
