(AP Photo/Ann Heisenfelt) \nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Tommy Armstrong Jr. bounced back from a pair of bad performances to start Big Ten play, passing for 261 yards and three touchdowns to start the salvaging of Nebraska’s season and preserve a 48-25 victory over Minnesota on Saturday. \nTerrell Newby rushed for 116 yards and two first-half scores on just 13 carries for the Cornhuskers (3-4, 1-2), who were reeling from four losses this fall on the opponent’s final offensive play. \nThis one was a lot less stressful, though Mitch Leidner did his best to keep the Gophers (4-3, 1-2) competitive against Nebraska’s FBS-worst pass defense with career bests in completions (26) and yards (301). Leidner threw two late interceptions, one that was returned by Joshua Kalu for a 41-yard touchdown, but he threw for one score and ran for another. \nAlonzo Moore, Cethan Carter and De’Mornay Pierson-El were the touchdown targets by Armstrong, who completed only 36 percent of his passes for a total of 234 yards in losses to Illinois and Wisconsin the last two weeks. \nPierson-El, who fumbled near the goal line in the closing minutes of Minnesota’s 28-24 win at Nebraska last year, missed the first four games with a foot injury. He had a 42-yard punt return and the catch of the game in the corner of the end zone early in the fourth quarter when he tipped the ball to himself between two defensive backs. \nCarter reached to push the ball over the pylon in the third quarter for a 10-yard score, deftly using his other arm for balance while Antonio Johnson was trying to tackle him. That marked the end of a 99-yard march in 10 plays by the Huskers, the defining stretch against an injury-affected Gophers defense that had been so good this season and the last two. \nNebraska predictably had plenty of fans on hand, with the two campuses a six-hour drive apart. Red hats, jackets and jerseys were packing the corners of the upper deck, interspersed throughout the lower bowl and spotted at all kinds of attractions around the Twin Cities this weekend. \nThey had most of the stadium to themselves to chant “Go Big Red!” to their heart’s content by the end, with the frustrated home crowd largely emptied out. \nThe troubling part of the first half for the Gophers was that Leidner was as sharp as he’s ever been, completing 16 of 17 passes for 156 yards before the break, but they still took a 10-point deficit into the locker room. \nRight after Minnesota’s first touchdown in the first quarter this season, a 75-yard opening drive capped by a 24-yard catch on third-and-1 by Eric Carter, Nebraska answered in three plays. Newby galloped through a gaping hole in the middle and bounced outside to reach the end zone untouched for 69 yards. \nAfter grinding up Purdue on the ground last week for a 41-13 victory, the Gophers rushed for only 65 yards on 26 attempts with Huskers defensive tackles Maliek Collins and Vincent Valentine doing plenty of damage inside.
