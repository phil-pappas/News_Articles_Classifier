Scoring the first two goals of the game in a span of five second-half minutes, Wayne Hills powered past Wayne Valley in the Passaic County semifinals, 3-0. \nEvery play was certainly befitting of a county semifinal, as the Indians looked like a perfect match for the Patriots. While Wayne Hills looked a little better in the flow of its game, Wayne Valley matched the Patriots’ attacking and defending. The underdogs looked fearless from the start. \n\"Wayne Valley was really strong coming out,\" said Wayne Hills coach Tina Londino. \"We needed the first half to sort of settle down a little bit.\" \nThe Indians made Wayne Hills’ goalkeeper Rachel Vellis work in the first half, with Vellis needing two major saves to keep Wayne Valley off the board early. Sandwiched between those Vellis saves was Wayne Valley’s Nicole Mottole’s breakaway denial of Amanda LaGuardia. \nWith six minutes gone by in the second half, the home team finally struck when Maddie Acampora put home a shot from close range. Five minutes later, Amy Prol scored. After that, it felt like game over for the upset-minded Indians, and Liz Byrne sealed the win by adding the Patriots’ third score with 11:19 left. \n\"In the second half we were better in particular in block tackling and in our cross-balls from the right,\" Londino said. \"We got them to the front of the goal more instead of hitting them into the side of the net.\" \nAnother critical element of the victory was how Wayne Hills absorbed LaGuardia’s injury during the contest. A knock to the knee took LaGuardia out of the game. She could have re-entered, but with the outcome no longer in doubt, Londino saw no reason to risk her star scorer, who has scored 20 goals in her first season as a forward. \n\"The team does not feel like a one-man show,\" Londino explained. \"So many players do a great job for this team, like Liz [Byrne] and Amy [Prol]. They’re two of the most skilled players on our team but they don’t show up in the stats as much.\" \nLondino also mentioned left midfielder Alison Badami as one of the unsung heroes of the game in LaGuardia’s absence. \nWayne Hills will face Pompton Lakes in the Passaic County tournament finals at West Milford at 6:45 p.m. on Oct. 16. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:19:39.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
