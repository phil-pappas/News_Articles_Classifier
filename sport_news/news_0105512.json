Only Barcelona’s Neymar with eight has more, with Nolito’s six matching Real stars Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema. \nCelta’s win left Real as leader on goal difference after its 3-0 victory over Levante on Saturday. Celta is second, followed by Barcelona in third after its 5-2 rout of Rayo Vallecano also on Saturday. \nVillarreal, which entered the round in first place, slipped to fourth at two points back.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:09:28.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
