The Stampede was owned by New Orleans Saints wide receiver Marques Colston of Susquehanna Township. \nIn a statement released by the league, Dauphin County commissioner Jeff Haste applauds the move. \n\"Indoor football was a fan favorite sport that we have missed in the past year,\" Haste said. “John Morris and the AIF have been great past partners to the Capital region. I am pleased to see the Capitals call the Farm Show home.” Haste goes on to state, “I look forward to the family friendly entertainment, as well as the economic impact that they will bring to our region.” \nThe Capitals (10-0) played their games last year at the York City Ice Arena. \n“I would like to thank Jeff Haste and the County Commissioners for the support to make this possible,\" added AIF head Morris in the same news release. \"We look forward to providing the area with quality indoor football and build upon the great success that Dauphin County and indoor football had over a five year period.” \nThe AIF season begins in February.
