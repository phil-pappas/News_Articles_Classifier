A fan at the coach's show asked Mendenhall how he moves past a disappointing loss. \n\"There's a lot of cool research. Before you can get over a setback, you have to have closure,\" Mendenhall explained on his weekly radio show \"BYU Football with Bronco Mendenhall\" Tuesday night at LaVell Edwards Stadium. \n\"From the time the game is over till Monday morning, I go through routines and by the time the last thing is done, it's dead and buried and I've moved forward,\" he added. \nMendenhall spoke about how outside interference is always a struggle with the team. For the past few weeks, that interference or outside noise was national and really positive. \nTalking about the outside praise, he said, \"It feels good, it's really easy for a slight edge to be lost in preparation.\" \nMendenhall also talked about how after two losses he realizes that outside noise could likely begin to be negative. \"We can't control (outside criticism) but what we can control is what our intent is.\" \nWhen the grieving was done and it was time to work on Monday, Mendenhall was grateful to have Micah Hannemann, who joined the coach as the player guest on the show. \nThe coach had high praise for the work ethic and natural ability of the sophomore from Highland, Utah. \n\"He's (Hannemann) one of the best players on our team, and very versatile. He tackles ferociously, practices hard. Just at the front end of his career. (He's got a) super, super bright future,\" Mendenhall said. \nHannemann talked about his roles on defense, returning punts and being on the punt team. \n\"I want to have an impact on the game,\" the Lone Peak alum said. \nMendenhall talked about Hannemann's versatility and how his skills transferred easily to all defensive back positions. \nThose skills were on display against Nebraska when Hannemann made an impressive interception that required a great toe-touch in-bounds. \nThe play was recognized on ESPN's SportsCenter as the No. 6 play of the day. \nAnother reason Mendenhall gets along with Hannemann is their shared passion for surfing. The coach jokingly said that if a starting position came between Hannemann and a non-surfer, Hannemann would get the job. \nMendenhall admitted that Hannemann is far and away the superior surfer, but both enjoy catching waves when they can. \nBesides talking about the swell, Mendenhall awarded the Firehouse Sub Firestarter of the Game award to linebacker Sione Takitaki. \n\"He loves to play the game, explosive, exciting, and violent on the field,\" Mendenhall said of Takitaki. \"It wasn't possible for Michigan to run the ball when he was on the field.\" \nThe Cougars will need Takitaki and Hannemann to show up against UConn's offense, especially the dual-threat quarterback Bryant Shirreffs. \nMendenhall mentioned Shirreffs' playmaking abilities but is confident that the improvement of his defense will make it possible for the Cougars to win a defensive battle come Friday.
