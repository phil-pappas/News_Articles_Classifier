Ashley Morgan finished with two RBIs and struck out 17 batters in the series. Vincent led all hitters with three RBIs.“Ashley is our horse,” Harper said. “We were going to go with her until she said that she was fatigued. When she is on the mound, I’m probably a little stronger defensively. That is where we have played majority of the year and it just keeps the stability throughout our defensive lineup.”On Wednesday, Chapel Hill will host a doubleheader against Harris County, which eliminated Ola last week in three games.In the opener, it was a pitching duel between Morgan and her counterpart Cathleen Nugue. Neither team scored a run until the fourth inning when Jakayla Sullivan homered to right. But in the bottom of the frame, Morgan redeemed herself with a solo shot to center to even the score at 1-1.“Even though it was 1-0 then 1-1 you never saw a drop or dip in our demeanor,” Harper said. “We still had confidence that we were going to win and that is what you look for in a mature team. We never saw panic anywhere in the lineup.”After Morgan struck out the side in the seventh, the freshmen at the bottom of the lineup came through for the Lady Panthers. First, Kira Morgan led off with the single and then Ivory Jones moved her over with a bunt. Finally, Vincent sent a pitch up the middle to score Morgan for a 2-1 final and place Chapel Hill one win away from advancing.“I’m just really proud of how clutch they were in the first game,” Harper said.In the second game, the Lady Panthers scored a run in each of the first three innings before putting the contest out of reach in the top of the fifth. After Shelby Robinson, who will attend Tennessee next year, tripled to right, Savannah Sikes brought her home with a double for a 4-0 lead. Three batters later, Sikes scored on a balk by Rose Johnson and Rashana Burley extended the score to 6-0 on a bunt by Kira Morgan. Two batters later, Vincent drove in two more runs with a single to center and Isis Taylor touched home on an error at third to cap the scoring.“I’m proud to reach 400 wins but right now we are in a fight for a state championship,” Harper said. “We will continue to think about those things a little bit more when the season is over.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:21:39.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
