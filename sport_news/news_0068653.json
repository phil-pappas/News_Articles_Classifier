He has five touchdowns against five interceptions and has been helped by experienced receivers Jaydon Mickens and Dwayne Washington. True freshman running back Myles Gaskin rushed for 134 yards on 22 carries, with a touchdown, against USC. Another true freshman earning significant time is left tackle Trey Adams. But the UW offense has sputtered to 26.8 points per game, and is one of the worst at creating first downs at 17.4 per game. The defense has bought time for UW's offense to score, allowing 15.0 points behind 8.0 tackles per loss per game (the 15th-best mark nationally) despite the losses of NFL draft picks on the defensive line and in the secondary. The Huskies are one of the least-penalized teams in FBS and allow few first downs. The defense will play without leading tackler Azeem Victor in the first half, however, after he was ejected against USC for targeting. On special teams, Dante Pettis returned a 76-yard punt return for a touchdown in the season-opener at Boise State.\n Mark Helfrich's Sunday review of double-overtime loss to Washington State Helfrich talked on Sunday about the Ducks' 45-38 home loss to Washington State. Star power: Defensive back Budda Baker. The one-time Ducks commit played the most defensive snaps of any Husky as a true freshman last season and despite an ankle injury that held him out of a loss to Cal, has helped keep the defense together after losing three NFL draft picks. Baker has 14 tackles and four passes broken-up and defended so far. His role takes on increased importance due to Victor's suspension.\nDid you know: Browning is the first Washington true freshman ever to start a season at quarterback, while Adams is the first true freshman to start at left tackle since 1976 .\nThreat level (1-5 scale): 5. Normally Washington's struggles generating points against FBS opponents would be a red flag. But Oregon's own offense, which has become one-dimensional since Vernon Adams Jr. broke the index finger on his throwing hand in Week One, has sputtered itself and will be playing, on the road at night, against a stingy defense motivated to end the program's 11-game losing streak to UO.\nEarly prediction: Washington 27, Oregon 24\n-- Andrew Greif\nagreif@oregonian.com\n@andrewgreif", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/andrewgreif", "http://www.seattletimes.com/sports/uw-husky-football/uw-left-tackle-trey-adams-settles-in-quickly-thanks-to-his-nasty-streak/"], "published": "2015-10-12T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:17:59.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
