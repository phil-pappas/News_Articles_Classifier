Blatter, due to step down in February, was suspended for 90 days by FIFA's ethics committee on Thursday along with UEFA president Michel Platini as part of a corruption investigation shaking world football's governing body. Platini had been the frontrunner to win the election to replace Blatter and his shrinking hopes now depend on whether he can overturn the ban through an appeal process. Both men deny suggestions of an improper payment by the FIFA head to Platini in 2011. Meanwhile, Sepp Blatter has filed an official appeal against his suspension from football by FIFA's ethics committee, the New York Times reported. The New York Times said it had obtained a copy of Blatter's appeal against the suspension. In it, the paper reported that Blatter objected to brusque and unfair treatment.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:51:14.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
