He’s gone in and played the big shots. Whenever you go in you actually have more time than what you think. I’s important for him to play a few deliveries,” said Dhoni. “It’s not easy to straightaway play the big shots. He needs to give himself a bit more time as it becomes difficult to find people who can clear the big outfield. My personal feeling is he needs to give himself a bit more time and everything will be fine,” he said. The left-hander was dismissed for ducks in the last two games after scoring 3 in the series opener at Kanpur. He did not have a great time in the preceding T20I series as well against the visitors. Talking about yesterday’s game that India lost by 18 runs after failing to chase South Africa’s 270 on a slow pitch, Dhoni said the wicket became slower as the game progressed. “In the first half, the wicket played differently and as the game progressed, it became more and more difficult. If the wicket had not changed, 270 was a very good effort by our bowlers. But it became slower and we were not able to play the big shots. “I thought it was a very good effort by the bowlers. I thought it was a good wicket to bat on, the spinners did not get much assistance but they bowled well. As I said, it got slower and slower there was a bit of reverse swing,” he said. — PTI Duminy out of ODIs after sustaining hand injury South Africa suffered a blow today after their senior batsman JP Duminy was ruled out of the remaining two ODI matches against India. According to a tweet from the official handle of Cricket South Africa (CSA) said: “Duminy sustained a laceration to his right hand during the third ODI. Will need 2-3 weeks to recover. #IndvSA” Dean Elgar has been called up to replace Duminy in the ODI squad. Meanwhile, Morne Morkel expressed doubts about his availability for the fourth ODI on October 22. Morkel had carried on with a sore leg to bowl South Africa to victory in the third ODI. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:14:54.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
