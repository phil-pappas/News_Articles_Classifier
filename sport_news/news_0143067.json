The Blue Jays recorded their first win of the American League Championship Series on Monday, 11-8 win over the Royals in Game 3.\nAdChoices Troy Tulowitzki and Josh Donaldson homered in a six-run third inning that chased KC starter Johnny Cueto and put Toronto up by six runs.\nMORE: Top ALCS photos | Spector's key moments of Game 3 | Tulo tossed in eighth\nThe Royals made the game close with four runs in the ninth, but they were unable to climb out of the hole Cueto dug.\nHere are our five takeaways from Game 3:\n1. \"Bad Johnny\" was back on full display. Cueto's first postseason road start in 2015 finished much like his postseason road start in 2013 — few outs and a lot of runs. Cueto, who gave up four runs on eight hits in the 2013 wild-card game while pitching for the Reds in Pittsburgh, was charged with eight runs (all earned) on six hits Monday.\nIn setting a Royals record for runs allowed in a postseason game, Cueto was putrid on the mound. He walked four, throwing balls on nearly 58 percent of his pitches, and hit Russell Martin on the elbow with a pitch. He is the first pitcher in postseason history to allow at least eight earned runs and 11 baserunners in two or fewer innings pitched.\nNot counting his two-hit gem in Game 5 of the ALDS, Cueto has a 9.18 ERA in 16 2/3 postseason innings.\nMORE: Former teammates to duel in Game 4\n2. Tulo is back. The Blue Jays shortstop has heated up in his last two playoff games. He was 2 for 25 in his first six, but after Monday's performance (in which he went 2 for 4 with a home run and three RBIs before getting ejected in the eighth inning), Tulo is starting to look like the prized trade-deadline acquisition that he was. He now has eight RBIs in the playoffs.\n3. Lorenzo Cain is among MLB postseason's best. With his single in the third, the Royals' All-Star center fielder extended his postseason hitting streak to a franchise-record 12 games. He joins Bernie Williams, Mike Matheny, Darin Erstad, Derek Jeter, Roberto Alomar, Alvin Dark and Pete Fox as the only players in MLB postseason history to hit in 12 straight.\n4. The Blue Jays produce from top to bottom. Each of the Toronto starters reached safely in Game 3, but most of the damage came from batters 6-9 — Tulowitzki, Martin, Kevin Pillar and Ryan Goins, who combined to go 5 for 14 with seven RBIs. Even though the Jays were outhit by the Royals 15-11, Toronto's three homers did in Kansas City. Tulowitzki and Goins each hit one.\n5. Pillar may actually be Superman. The Blue Jays center fielder jokingly acknowledged being the Man of Steel earlier this week, and after his leaping catch in the first inning Monday, it may be true. Pillar added to his highlight reel by robbing Cain of a extra-base hit as he collided with the center-field wall for the second out in the inning.\nWhat's next: Game 4 at Toronto on Tuesday at 4 p.m. ET. R.A. Dickey (11-11, 3.91 ERA in regular season) will toe the rubber for the Jays as Toronto looks to even the series. Chris Young (11-6, 3.06 ERA in regular season) will take the hill for the Royals.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Sportsnet/status/656264068060286976", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb-news/4658719-alcs-2015-troy-tulowitzki-ejected-blue-jays-royals-john-hirschbeck-umpire", "http://www.sportingnews.com/photos/4658461-mlb-playoffs-2015-american-league-championship-series-photos-pictures-royals-blue-jays-alcs/slide/366680", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4658720-alcs-2015-blue-jays-royals-troy-tulowitzki-josh-donaldson-ryan-goins-home-runs-ejection", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb-news/4658690-alcs-2015-blue-jays-royals-ra-dickey-chris-young-mets-rangers-cy-young-daniel-murphy-mlb-playoffs-2015"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T12:38:08.966+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
