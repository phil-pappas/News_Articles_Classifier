(Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT Sponsored Links The Associated Press TORONTO â€” \nThe Toronto Blue Jays have clinched their first trip to the American League Championship Series since 1993, overcoming one of the most bizarre plays in playoff history by taking advantage of three Texas Rangers errors for a 6-3 victory Wednesday in the deciding Game 5 of the Division Series. \nThe Blue Jays play the winner of Wednesday night's Game 5 between Houston and Kansas City. Game 1 of the ALCS is Friday night. \nJose Bautista hit a three-run homer to cap an event-filled, 53-minute seventh inning that took a turn when catcher Russell Martin's throw back to the pitcher deflected off batter Shin-Soo Choo and allowed the tiebreaking run to score. \nThe Blue Jays filed a protest after an umpire review ruled Rougned Odor was allowed to cross home plate. Toronto fans pelted the field with debris during the 18-minute delay. \nThe Rangers started the bottom half by making three straight errors and Toronto rallied.
