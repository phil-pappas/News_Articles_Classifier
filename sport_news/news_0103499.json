Williams moved past Brian Mann into second on the school's all-time passing list with 6,080 yards, trailing only Fiedler (6,684). \nRyan McManus, who sat out the last two games with an ankle sprain, and Jon Marc Carrier had six receptions apiece. McManus finished with 116 yards receiving and Carrier added 103. Cameron Skaff had two touchdown catches for the Big Green (4-0, 2-0 Ivy League). \nDartmouth took 21-0 lead when Williams hit Kyle Bramble for a 17-yard touchdown with 6:28 left in the first half. \nYale (3-1, 1-1), which came into the game averaging more than 457 yards and nearly 30 points per game, was limited to a season-low 276 total yards. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:27:00.298+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
