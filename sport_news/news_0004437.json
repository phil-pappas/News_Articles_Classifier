Training camp begins Tuesday, the preseason soon after, the season in less than a month. Professional basketball has returned. \nThe league looks strong again this year. The East is a two-tier race: the Cavs and everyone else, but there's still a lot of talent and dangerous teams that will make for a fun playoff race. In the West, you can reasonably make the argument that the Warriors, Spurs, Thunder, Rockets, Clippers and Grizzlies all have a legitimate shot at the title. (Many will argue that at least two of those teams have no shot, but they each have proven they have what it takes in terms of talent. They just happen to play in the West.) \nThe Warriors are being overlooked. The Spurs have better odds at the title, along with the Cavs. What's changed? Where did the Warriors get worse? Was their play last year unsustainable? No, they've proven they can shoot like that time and time again. And besides, their defense was what actually won them the title; it was the bedrock of everything they accomplished all year long, really. They retained every significant member of the title team, and the core members are all well under the age of 30. They played into June, yes, but they also managed their minutes throughout the season and only lost five games total in the playoffs, never having to go to a seven-game series. Their coach is set, their rotation is set, their players have either gotten paid or understand where they're at, as in the case of Harrison Barnes. \nThere's no better word for it. Overlooking the Warriors is downright stupid. \nIt should be an intense season, with drama surrounding Kevin Durant's upcoming free agency, the Cavaliers having to manage injuries and egos, the Rockets dealing with life as a contender, and teams like Milwaukee, Utah and Phoenix trying to make the leap. Even the Knicks might not be awful! No matter how it all turns out, it'll be fascinating to watch the season play out and we'll be along for the ride with you every step. \nLet's tip it off. Welcome to the NBA preseason. \nThe acquisition of Ty Lawson bumps the Rockets into the Top 5.
