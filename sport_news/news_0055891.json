Christian Heyward forced and recovered a Quinton Pedroza fumble on Hawaii’s third play and Pumphrey was back in the end zone four plays later to make it 14-0. \nThe Aztecs (3-3, 2-0 Mountain West) made it 21-7 when Maxwell Smith found Eric Judge with a 58-yard touchdown pass with 1:40 left in the first half. \nJemond Hazely fumbled at the San Diego State 22 and Hawa Marrell Jackson recovered to set up a Hawaii touchdown that cut the lead to 21-14 midway through the third quarter, but the Warriors (2-4, 0-2) could get no closer and Pumphrey added an insurance touchdown to start the fourth quarter.
