(AP) — Brad Lardon shot a 6-under 66 on the Bayonet Course on Saturday to take the third-round lead in the Senior PGA Professional National Championship. \nThe 50-year-old Lardon is the PGA general manager at Texas A&M Golf Course in College Station. He had a 9-under 207 total. \n“I thought I had a good round in me,” Lardon said. “I didn’t’ play well back in 2012 when I came here (for the PGA Professional Championship). Today, I played well for the first 12 today, and made some nice saves coming in. The course fits my eye.” \nJim Carter of Scottsdale, Arizona; James Mason of Dillard, Georgia; and John Dal Corobbo of Speedway, Indiana, were a stroke back. Carter and Dal Corobbo shot 69, and Mason had a 71. \nThe top 35 finishers Sunday will earn spots in the Senior PGA Championship in May at Harbor Shores in Benton Harbor, Michigan.
