Show Caption Previous Next \nNAPLES, Fla. - Terry Dean was shocked when he heard about Steve Spurrier immediate retirement as South Carolina’s head football coach late Monday. \nDean, a Naples native and Barron Collier graduate, played for the “Ol’ Ball Coach” at Florida and knew Spurrier to be a fiery competitor. Spurrier’s tenacity led to a much-publicized feud between the coach and Dean when he was the starting quarterback for the No. 1 ranked Gators in 1994. \nIt’s also why Dean was surprised his former coach resigned from South Carolina midseason on Monday. \n“I thought he was probably likely done at the end of the year, but I was really surprised it was immediate,” Dean said. “That’s not like what I remember of Steve. At first thought, I thought something had to happen health-wise or otherwise.” \nDean, 43, first met Spurrier at a summer camp at Duke in 1989. Dean was a four-year starter at quarterback for Barron Collier and was recruited by Spurrier. When the coach left Duke for Florida in 1990, Dean was his first recruit. \nAs a redshirt junior at Florida in 1993, Dean led the Gators to a Southeastern Conference championship and a win in the Sugar Bowl. But he split time with freshman Danny Wuerffel. As a senior in 1994, Spurrier was quick to pull Dean and replace him with Wuerffel after mistakes, a tactic that frustrated Dean. \nBefore the sixth game of 1994, Dean and Spurrier got into a shouting match in practice. Dean threw four interceptions in the first half against Auburn that week and saw little action the rest of the year. \n“I think most player did (find Spurrier hard to play for), but no other position had more interaction with him than the QB does,” Dean said. “When I played for him, he was my quarterback coach, my offensive coordinator and my head coach. I literally was with him for what amounted to 24/7 during the season. The more in touch with him you were, the harder he was to play for.” \nThough he said he had no relationship with Spurrier at the end of his college career, Dean has talked to his old coach a few times since graduating. A couple of years ago Spurrier was in Naples recruiting and called Dean, and the two talked for a while. \nJerri Spurrier, the coach’s wife, still is one of Dean’s favorite people. When Dean got his tonsils out in college, Jerri Spurrier brought ice cream to his place in Gainesville and took care of him. \nDean is a financial advisor in Naples. He’s also the quarterbacks coach at First Baptist Academy, where his son Tyler is a senior starting quarterback. \nThough he had a hard time playing for Spurrier, Dean admits he’s a great coach. And Dean had success under Spurrier, himself a Heisman Trophy-winning college quarterback. In his final two seasons at Florida, Dean threw for 3,143 yards and 37 touchdowns. \n“There’s no question,” Dean said. “I think he’ll go down as one of the greatest coaches ever in college football. His record speaks for itself. \n“He changed the game. Unfortunately for him, the game caught up to him, a game he made – the faster pace, going no huddle, the passing, going for it on fourth down regardless of the situation. He was kind of the original riverboat gambler when it comes to play-calling.” Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
