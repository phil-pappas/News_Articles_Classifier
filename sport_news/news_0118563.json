In addition to the rainout, both the New York Yankees and Kansas City Royals lost. \n“We brought up an extra player, move guys around if we need an extra body. If we clinch, guys need a break and we’re covered at every spot. After we clinch, the guys are going to need a day, they’ve earned that.” \nDiaz had been working out in Dunedin at the Jays instructional camp just in case. \n“He was coming anyway,” Gibbons said of Diaz, who was drafted by the Blue Jays in 2006. “He’s the perfect guy, last couple of years he’s been up and down, let him come in and enjoy it too.” \nDiaz is thrilled to be part of it. \n“I guess I came at the right moment for the celebration so I’m just happy to be here,” Diaz said before the game. “I was ecstatic (to get the call). I’ve been in this organization for nine out of 10 years and there’s a lot going on right now and it’s exciting and I’m just happy to be here and do whatever it takes to help these guys out.” \nA DIFFERENT LOOK \nIn the nightcap, with the division clinched, Gibbons kept to his word and didn’t use any of his regulars. \nThe batting order was the following: \n1.
