Closer Roberto Osuna was perfect in the ninth. \nToronto’s sharp pitching held Cain hitless, snapping his team record 13-game hitting streak in the postseason. \nYordano Ventura will start for the defending AL champions on Friday in Game 6 against Toronto left-hander David Price, the Game 2 loser. \n“We’re excited to go home,” Royals pitcher Danny Duffy said. “We wish we could have got it done today but we didn’t.” \nHosmer echoed Duffy’s upbeat vibes. \n“Nothing but positivity,” Hosmer said. “We’ve got a 3-2 lead and we’re heading back to Kansas City. That’s where we play our best baseball so everyone is still feeling pretty good.” \nToronto is trying to become just the 13th team of 80 who trailed 3-1 in best-of-seven postseason series to rally and win. It has happened four of 17 times in the LCS, including when the Royals bounced back against the Blue Jays in 1985 en route to Kansas City’s only World Series title. \nIn this year’s best-of-five Division Series, Toronto lost the first two games before winning three straight against Texas. \n“They didn’t let anything slide by today,” Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas said. “They earned that W.” \nTroy Tulowitzki broke the game open with a three-run double off Kelvin Herrera in the sixth, giving him seven RBIs in the series. Edwin Encarnacion had walked with the bases loaded against Edinson Volquez, who seemed flustered by close calls that didn’t go his way. \nEstrada, a 32-year-old right-hander, enabled his bullpen to rest, a day after Kansas City romped 14-2 in a game that saw infielder Cliff Pennington pitch in the the ninth. \nRoyals shortstop Alcides Escobar said Estrada did “a tremendous job” against the Royals \n“He was really good,” Escobar said. “He threw the ball down, down and away, down and in. He didn’t miss many pitches.” \nBefore 49,325 roaring fans at Rogers Centre, Chris Colabello’s solo homer into the left-field seats in the second gave Estrada a lead. \nEstrada didn’t make a miscue until Salvador Perez homered with two outs in the eighth. Estrada retired his first nine batters, ending at four Escobar’s record streak of leading off playoff games with hits. \nVolquez, who won Game 1, allowed just two singles after Colabello connected but lost the strike zone in the sixth.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T12:39:40.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
