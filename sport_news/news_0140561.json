A judge on Wednesday set Pesa’s bond at $150,000. \nThe York County Coroner’s Office ruled the “most likely” cause of death for 6-month-old Jacob Pesa-Mendoza was asphyxia due to being placed face down on adult bedding. Coroner Sabrina Gast listed the baby’s manner of death as “unable to determine.” \nThe coroner’s office in March did not rule on the “manner of death” but, after reviewing medical records, autopsy/toxicology results, and interviewing caregivers and experts, Gast said the infant was prevented from being able to breathe. \nA police spokesman said the case was turned over to the State Law Enforcement Division’s child fatality task force. An arrest warrant provided by SLED alleges Pesa shook the child, “causing his head to move uncontrollably.” \nPesa’s arrest warrant accuses him of putting the infant face down on a bed without seeking medical attention until “hours later.” \nRock Hill officers went to an apartment on India Hook Road where the infant was found unresponsive by EMS workers on March 16, the police report states. \nParamedics said the infant was having difficulty breathing and he was taken to the hospital. A news release from the coroner’s office states the infant was treated at the Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte. He died March 21.
