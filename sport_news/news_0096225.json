He's witty, he's quick, so the jokes are like, 'Bang-bang.'\" \nPlumlee's progression as a player though is no laughing matter. \n\"Marshall's a beast,\" Jefferson said. \"And he's finally going to get to show that.\" \nThe youngest of Duke's decorated Plumlee brothers is finally starting to come into his own. \nA breakout performance in the ACC Tournament caught plenty of eyes, but it's the big man's mouth -- his vocal leadership -- that has Mike Krzyzewski's attention. \n\"They trust that voice,\" Krzyzewski said. \"Whenever we've had teams that have had good, vocal big men on the defensive end, we've usually been a much better defensive team.\" \n\"Whatever the team needs,\" Plumlee said, of what role he'll play serve this season. \"If we buy into that, we'll be able to do some great things.\" \nThe big man's hustle and loyalty has earned his team's respect...but biceps? He submits that battle to his W-W-E Idol. \n\"I don't know if I got the guns like he does,\" Plumlee said. \"But, that was fun for me\" Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:18:06.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
