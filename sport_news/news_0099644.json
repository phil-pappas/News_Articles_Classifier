Falk's five touchdown passes tied for fourth most in a game this season, and he also ran for a score.\nThe 6-foot-4, 205-pound Falk is in his first full season as the Cougars' starter. He walked on out of Logan, Utah, in 2013 and was put on scholarship at the start of last season.\nFalk's 50 completions bettered the 47 he had against Rutgers, the 37 he had against Wyoming and the 35 he had against California. All rank among the top nine single-game completion totals nationally.\nThe Cougars' total of 75 attempts against the Ducks was the fourth-most in Leach's four seasons at Washington State. Their single-game high is 89 against Oregon in 2013.\n———\nSome other notable statistics:\nHIGH-SCORING BAYLOR: Baylor is on its way to leading the nation in scoring for the third straight year. The Bears' 66-7 win at Kansas bumped their average to 64.2 points a game. That's 11.5 more than the next-closest team, Texas Tech. Baylor has scored no fewer than 56 points in any game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:56:55.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
