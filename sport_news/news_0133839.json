Haffey/Getty Images (NEW YORK) -- A controversial play during Saturday night's playoff game between the New York Mets and the Los Angeles Dodgers left Chase Utley facing a suspension for two games. \nHe will appeal the decision, according to ESPN. \nUtley, second baseman for the Dodgers, collided into Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada during the seventh inning of the game, leaving Tejada with a broken left leg. Major League Baseball is now calling the slide illegal. \nMLB Chief Baseball Officer Joe Torre said in a statement, \"After thoroughly reviewing the play from all conceivable angles, I have concluded that Mr. Utley's action warrants discipline.\" \nIf Utley appeals the decision, he will be able to play Game 3 of the National League Division Series, though that could change. The Dodgers may hear a decision on the matter well before the game Monday night, according to ESPN. \n\"The New York Mets completely support the decision made by Major League Baseball to suspend Chase Utley for two games and feel this was the appropriate course of action,\" said a statement from the Mets. \"With this decision behind us, the team and our fans can now focus on playing winning baseball.\" \nCopyright Â© 2015, ABC Radio.
