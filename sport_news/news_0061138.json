His handlers said he was later cleared after a checkup at the hospital.\nIt was just four years ago that Bracero (24-2, 5 KOs) handed O’Connor his first professional defeat. Last night, the Brooklyn native refused to give O’Connor a chance to redeem himself in front of his home state fans.\n“That was the plan,” Bracero said of attacking the left-handed O’Connor with a right punch early. “In my last fight, I fought a southpaw and I made a few mistakes and didn’t prepare properly. I’ve been in camp specifically working on these punches and since he is a southpaw, I had to step out to the left and I just came with the right hand.”\n“(The punch) landed and it worked. All I’ve been doing is training and working day-in and day-out and I am just so humble and grateful for how it happened.”\nBilled as a redemption fight for O’Connor, Bracero wasted little time in winning the non-title welterweight bout. And as stunned as the capacity crowd was at the sudden and momentarily scary outcome, the affable Bracero was not.\n“I knew coming in here that all the pressure was on him,” he said. “My pressure was to just come in here and make noise and being that it was a home crowd, all that was going to do was bring the beast out in me.\n“I had my last fight in front of a home crowd and lost. After I took that loss I went into a depression and, so in my mind, I knew I was coming in here to win. I didn’t know I was going to beat him like this, but I knew I was going to win.”\nO’Connor fell to 26-3 as a professional with the loss.\nIn the co-feature, super bantamweight Jonathan Guzman floored Danny Aquino twice in the second round before finishing him off in the ninth. The win improved the Dominican’s record to 20-0 with 20 KOs.\nOn the undercard, Quincy’s Ryan “The Polish Prince” Kielczewski, defeated Brooklyn native Rafael Vazquez by unanimous decision in a 10-round featherweight bout.\n“The gameplan was to outsmart him and outwork him and use my speed,” said Kielczewski. “I’ve been doing this my whole life and I won’t be happy until I am a world champion, so I am just working every day for that.”\nKielczewski prevailed on the judges’ scorecards 96-94, 97-93 and 97-93 as he ran his record to 24-1 with seven KOs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:18:06.890+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
