(AP) — The Jacksonville Jaguars will be without running back T.J. Yeldon against Houston on Sunday. \nThe team ruled out Yeldon a few hours before kickoff, saying the rookie will miss the game because of a groin injury. Yeldon missed practice all week and had been listed as questionable. \nYeldon has 291 yards rushing, 73 yards receiving and a touchdown this season. \nWithout him, the Jaguars (1-4) are expected to use Denard Robinson and Toby Gerhart in the backfield. Robinson is returning after missing three games with a sprained left knee. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T18:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:53:03.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
