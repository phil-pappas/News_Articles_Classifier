Sat, 10/03/2015 - 8:48am Tweet \nYou have to nitpick to find something Patrice Bergeron hasn’t accomplished in the NHL , but here’s one: He’s never made someone into a 30-goal-scorer. \nWell, to be fair, that’s not entirely accurate. He has made one player on his line a 30-goal-scorer -- twice -- but it was himself both times (2005-06 and 2013-14). Bergeron is optimistic that will change this season, however, and he has reason to be. \nThat Brad Marchand has not yet scored 30 goals in the NHL opens the question of what he is and how the Bruins use him. Perhaps it doesn’t surprise those who still view him as Merlot Line OG, but there’s plenty to suggest he’s due for a 30-goal campaign. \nMarchand has scored at least 24 goals in the NHL ’s last three 82-game seasons. In the lockout-shortened 2013 season wedged into that stretch, his 18 goals over 45 games put him on pace for 31 goals over 77 games. He’s led the Bruins in goals in two of the last three seasons, including a 2014-15 campaign in which he was hampered by an elbow injury. \nMost fascinating of all: He’s done this without getting significant time on the power play. \nNow he’s all healed up, still playing with one of the best centers on the planet and in line for at least a part-time job on Boston’s second power-play unit. Five years after accurately declaring he’d score 20 goals as a rookie, Marchand should be aiming for 30. \n“I think I can get there at some point,” Marchand said. “A lot of things have to go right and you’ve got to stay hot at the right times. I think the biggest thing is if you can stay consistent the whole season and you stay healthy, then maybe it’s in the cards. We’ll see.” \nMarchand has obviously come a long way for the Bruins. After a 20-game sample with the B’s in the 2009-10 season in which he scored no goals and had just one assist, Marchand, a third-round pick in the 2006 draft, wondered what kind of NHL player he would be. \n“I thought I might have to be a third or fourth-liner and kind of grind it out,” he said. \nHis usage as a fourth-liner to begin his first full season changed that. Half a season playing (and producing) with Gregory Campbell and Shawn Thornton led to a promotion to Bergeron’s line, where he would finish the season with 21 goals. Bergeron and Marchand have pretty much been inseparable since. \n“He brings so much energy every time he steps on [the ice],” Bergeron said. “He’s so slippery, too, avoiding checks and coverage and whatnot. I’m impressed by the way he’s improved, but I’m not necessarily surprised. I saw that in him even from the first day. I knew he was going to be an impact player for us.” \nNow the question is how Marchand can bridge the gap from 25 goals to 30. The easiest solution is on the power play. \nSince he became a full-time NHL player in the 2010-11 season, he has never finished higher than 10th among Bruins players in power play time on ice per game. That’s very unusual for a team’s leading scorer. \nGiven Marchand's size and skill set, Claude Julien ’s options are limited as to where he can play Marchand on the man advantage. It’s pretty much either on the half wall or in the slot, with both Julien and Marchand agreeing he’s better suited for the slot given that he’s a better shooter than passer. Over the years, however, J ulien has felt that he’s had better options to play in the slot, whether because he’s preferred a righty (Marchand’s a lefty) or because he liked other players’ shots better. \nZdeno Chara ’s eventual presence will alter the look of Boston’s power play units, but for now, Boston’s top unit consists of Torey Krug and David Krejci at the points with Patrice Bergeron , Ryan Spooner and Loui Eriksson up front. While Jimmy Hayes is the net-front guy and Matt Irwin and Colin Miller have manned the points on the second unit, Julien has given looks to both Marchand with David Pastrnak and Matt Beleskey with Brett Connolly. \n\"We're kind of experimenting with that a little bit,\" Julien said. \nMarchand tied for the team lead in power play goals with four in the lockout-shortened 2013 season, one of just two seasons in which he’s averaged at least one minute on the man advantage per night. A season earlier, he scored five power play goals while averaging a career-high 2:09 of power play time on ice. It’s no coincidence that the aforementioned season yielded what remains a career-best 28 goals. \nEntering his sixth season, Marchand wants to be used more regularly on the man advantage, but he isn’t banging down the door. \n“Obviously I’d like to be out there,” Marchand said. “At the end of the day, whatever’s best for the team is what I want. Whatever helps us win.” \nJulien pointed to Marchand taking too long with the puck as a reason as to why Marchand has been held back on the power play at times. \n“We’ve encouraged him in all aspects of the game releasing that puck a little bit quicker, which he’s been working on since he’s gotten here,” Julien said. “So there’s some things that he can continue to work on to make him a better power play guy, but he’s got the shot and he’s got the skill. As long as he doesn’t over-handle the puck, which we’ve seen him do at times, and then lose it at a point in the game when you’re on the power play and they ice the puck and you’ve got to go all the way back.” \nIf Marchand can get and hold a job on one of Boston’s power play units, it could be a deciding factor in whether he can get to 30, a feat that’s been accomplished only three times by a Bruin since the 2009-10 season. \nWith Boston’s revamped group of wingers, the team hopes that its offense will produce more than it did in last season’s snakebitten and injury-riddled campaign. While Pastrnak playing with David Krejci could yield big things, Marchand might be the best bet to lead the team in scoring again. It’s just a matter of how many he scores. \n“He’s been the goal-scoring leader and I see him taking the next step again,” Bergeron said. “You can tell even off the ice, he wants to become a better leader and fill a bigger role. It’s going to [manifest] itself on the ice.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:01:17.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
