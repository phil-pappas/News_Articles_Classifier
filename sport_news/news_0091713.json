(Photo: Jim Brown/USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nTUSCALOOSA — While it wasn’t technically his team yet, Alabama coach Nick Saban remembers Tennessee quarterback Josh Dobbs stepping in during last year’s game and playing well against the Crimson Tide. \nDobbs replaced the injured Nathan Peterman under center for the Volunteers to start the second series, and finished out the contest. When he entered the game, Tennessee was already down 13-0. Dobbs couldn’t complete the comeback (Alabama won 34-20), but he did catch Saban’s eye. \n“We had to play against him all day. He’s gotten better (since then),” Saban said. “You can tell he’s got a great understanding of what the expectation is for him and what he needs to do on offense. I think he’s, it looks like he’s a good leader. I’ve seen the players responding positively to him. I don’t think there’s any question about the fact that the guy is really playing well. I think he’s had a great year so far.” \nDobbs finished last year’s contest 19-of-32 for 192 yards, two touchdowns and an interception. He also added 75 yards on the ground. \n“He’s a great player,” Tide linebacker Reggie Ragland said. “He came in when the guy (Peterman) got hurt or whatever and he did his job. He came in and he gave us fits and trouble, so we’ll do our job to keep him contained.” \nAlabama (6-1, 3-1 SEC) gets another shot at stopping Dobbs and Tennessee (3-3, 1-2 SEC) on Saturday in Bryant-Denny Stadium. Kickoff is schedule for 2:30 p.m. on CBS. Alabama has won eight straight in the rivalry. \nOn the year, Dobbs has thrown for 1,101 yards and eight touchdowns to two interceptions. He’s also ran for 368 yards and another five scores. \nPrior to the Vols’ bye week, Dobbs had a career day against Georgia two weeks ago. He threw for 312 yards and three touchdowns while running for 118 yards and two scores. \n“You can tell he’s more confident,” Saban said. “You can tell he’s probably improved as a passer a little bit, better pass efficiency. Really understands the offense that they run and does a really good job of executing it. He’s just developed into a really fine quarterback.” \nBehind Dobbs are two talented running backs in Jalen Hurd and Alvin Kamara. As a team, Tennessee is No. 2 in the SEC averaging 222 rushing yards per game. \nHurd, who Saban described as “tenacious in the way he carries the ball,” leads the way with 95.33 yards per game. While Kamara’s yards per game isn’t very high, he averages nearly six yards per rush. \nSaban said the duo have both “done a great job for them.” \n“It’s certainly going to be a challenge for our defense to tackle well in this game, especially the way (Hurd) runs, the way Alvin (Kamara) runs, the way the quarterback (Dobbs) runs,” Saban said. “All those guys, when you watch the film, there’s a lot of people missing a lot of tackles and they’re creating that. So it’s going to be a real challenge for us to tackle well in this game against some very good players.” \n(8) ALABAMA VS.
