The Knights are now riding a 12-game unbeaten streak dating back to their 3-0 loss to the Golden Warriors. \n“We were a much better team coming in, and the mindset was revenge, obviously,” said senior Brendan Parisotto, who had two goals on the day. “We needed to just come back and beat them.” \nParisotto got the Knights off to a fast start, breaking free from his defender down the right side of the field before going straight to the net to make it 1-0 in the fourth minute. North Andover controlled the pace from there, but it remained a one-goal game going into halftime. \nEarly in the second half, Andover got a couple of its best chances, after senior Steven Schuhwerk fired an impressive scissor kick towards the net after a corner. But Knights goalie Paul DeMaio was there for the stop. \nShortly after, North Andover extended its lead when junior Stephen Stabile beat Andover’s goalie to a contested ball, and set up Ryan Bessette for a goal to make it 2-0. \nIn the final 10 minutes, North Andover finished the job with two more goals in quick succession, the first coming off a header by Parisotto, and the next off a rocket by Cam Twomey from just outside the box. \nAndover was playing without two of its top defensive players, center midfielder Raini Huynh and outside midfielder Mouhammed Thiam. They were both hurt in Saturday’s game against Lowell. \n“We have to to put the ball in the net, play tighter on defense, don’t give them open shots in the back and then just score,” said Andover coach Jim Saalfrank. \nAndover will face Lawrence on the road at 11 a.m., and North Andover will look to continue its streak when it hosts Lowell next Tuesday at 4 p.m. Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:00:40.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
