Arrieta was lifted after allowing four runs on four hits and two strikeouts in five innings. Arrieta struck out eight. AP \nNEW YORK — Jake Arrieta was pounced on for three quick runs, rookie right-hander Noah Syndergaard gave his team its second strong start in as many nights and the New York Mets cruised to a 4-1 victory over the Cubs Sunday to take a 2-0 lead in the National League Championship Series. \nThe best-of-seven series shifts to Chicago Tuesday after an off day Monday. Kyle Hendricks will start for the Cubs against Mets ace Jacob deGrom. \nArrieta had a rare bad first inning, allowing a single, double and home run to the first three batters he faced. Red-hot Met Daniel Murphy hit the homer after Curtis Granderson singled and David Wright scored him with a double over center fielder Dexter Fowler’s head to get things rolling for the Mets, who looked to take a 2-0 lead in the best of seven series. \nNew York added a fourth run in the third on an infield RBI single by Yoenis Cespedes scoring Granderson — who stole second and third base. \nThe Cubs, who were held to five hits, scored their run against Syndergaard on Kris Bryant’s double off the left field wall with two outs in the sixth, scoring Fowler (single) from second. Syndergaard struck out nine Cubs over 5 2/3 innings, allowing one run on three hits and a walk. Four relievers, including former White Sox closer Addison Reed and Mets closer Jeurys Familia (second save of the series), held the Cubs scoreless over the final 3 2/3 innings. \nArrieta, who retired the last eight batters he faced, settled in and pitched well after the first three hitters but the damage was done, and he was lifted for pinch hitter Tommy LaStella in the sixth inning trailing 4-0. Arrieta’s pitching line: 5 innings, 4 hits, 4 runs (earned), two walks, eight strikeouts. \nMurphy, who launched a foul ball into the top deck in right field before connecting on a low pitch for the homer, also went deep in Game 1, a 4-2 Mets victory. He has five postseason homers and has homered in four straight playoff games. \nAfter Murphy connected, Arrieta retired the next six batters, including four on strikeouts, before Granderson led off the third with a walk. Arrieta pitched a perfect fourth and perfect fifth. Arrieta threw 94 pitches, 52 for strikes. \nSyndergaard was lifted after Bryant’s RBI double in favor of lefty Jonathon Niese, who struck out Anthony Rizzo for the third out with Bryant on second. \nMets rookie right-hander Noah Syndergaard struck out nine Cubs over 5 2/3 innings. AP \nIt was a stunningly bad start for Arrieta, who went into the playoffs with a 16-1 record and 0.86 ERA over his last 20 regular-season starts. He had pitched a complete-game shutout with 11 strikeouts against the Pirates in a 4-0 Cubs victory in the Wild Card game Oct. 7 but showed signs of being vulnerable during a sub-par start in Game 3 of the NLDS versus the Cardinals last Monday when he allowed four runs over 5 2/3 innings in a Cubs victory. \nMurphy, who has five homers in seven postseason games, including homers against Zack Greinke, Clayton Kershaw and now Arrieta, is on the tear of his career. He never had five homers in any calendar month during his career. The last time Arrieta gave up three runs in the first inning was 123 starts ago, in July, 2010. \nChris Coghlan, who hit a home run against Syndergaard in the right-hander’s major league debut at Wrigley Field on May 12, started in right field for the Cubs and was robbed of a possible home run by Granderson, the right fielder, who leaped above the top of the wall for a catch and the second out of the Cubs’ scoreless second inning. \nChris Coghlan and Daniel Murphy react to Curtis Granderson’s leaping catch above the wall in the second inning. AP \nTravis Wood pitched two perfect innings of relief for the Cubs, but the Mets bullpen, like Syndergaard, kept Cubs bats silent. \nIn Game 1, Matt Harvey dominated the Cubs early with four perfect innings out of the gate. In Game 2, Syndergaard was almost as overpowering. \nJake Arrieta watches from the dugout during the sixth inning. -AP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:25:48.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
