The next game, which was the first one played that season, was moved from Tiger Stadium to Arizona State because Baton Rouge was overwhelmed by storm evacuees from the New Orleans area and the campus was helping with relief efforts.\nMore Information\nKey capsules\nMaryland (2-3, 0-1 Big Ten) at Ohio State (5-0, 1-0) Noon (BTN)\nLine: Ohio State by 32&frac12;\nSeries: Ohio State leads 1-0.\nWhat's at stake: Respect. As wins accumulate for Ohio State, their bandwagon gets smaller. The Buckeyes were the first unanimous No. 1 pick in the history of the Associated Press preseason poll with 61 votes. But after narrowly escaping Indiana 34-27 on Oct. 3, the Buckeyes were first on 38 ballots, seven fewer than the previous week.\nNo. 2 TCU (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) at Kansas State (3-1, 0-1), 7:30 p.m. (Fox-23)\nLine: TCU by 10\nSeries: Tied 4-4\nWhat's at stake: The Horned Frogs are trying to stay in the College Football Playoff hunt in their third road trip of the season, while Kansas State is trying to bounce back from a last-minute loss at Oklahoma State last weekend.\nSouth Carolina (2-3, 0-3) at No. 7 LSU (4-0, 2-0 SEC), 3:30 p.m. (ESPN)\nLine: LSU by 13.\nSeries: LSU leads 17-2-1\nWhat's at stake: LSU is looking to go 5-0 for the fifth time in coach Les Miles' 11 seasons and the first time since 2012. South Carolina is hoping to avoid the first 0-4 start in SEC play in coach Steve Spurrier's career. The Gamecocks opened 0-3 in Spurrier's debut season in 2005, then won their final five league games.\nNavy (4-0) at No. 15 Notre Dame (4-1), 3:30 p.m. (NBC-13)\nLine: Notre Dame by 14&frac12;.\nSeries: 75-12-1.\nWhat's at stake: The Fighting Irish already need help to keep their College Football Playoff hopes alive and can't afford another defeat. The Midshipmen are seeking to be ranked during the regular season for the first time since being No. 17 at 6-0 in 1979.\nMiles' next game was delayed two days and played on a Monday night in Death Valley because of Hurricane Rita.\nIn 2008, the approach of Hurricane Gustav caused kickoff against Appalachian State to be moved from 4 p.m. to 10 a.m. Gustav then ripped through Baton Rouge, damaging Tiger Stadium and postponing the following game against Troy until later that season.\nThis season, the home opener against McNeese State was called off just minutes after it began because of persistent lightning.\nNow LSU is getting a home game back, in a sense.\nTechnically, the Gamecocks will be the home team in Death Valley â€” a bit of irony for a team whose chief in-state rival, Clemson, plays in a stadium with the same nickname.\nEfforts are being made at LSU to show solidarity with, and support for, recovering South Carolina. Just don't expect LSU's charity to extend to the playing field; the Tigers (4-0, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) want to remain atop the SEC's Western Division.\nIt's hardly ideal for the struggling Gamecocks (2-3, 0-3) to have a home game against the already favored Tigers moved to LSU. But coach Steve Spurrier emphasized that the competitive concerns of his program were \"on the back burner of what's best for our community.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:19:10.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
