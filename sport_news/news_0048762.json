Yes, he lost to champion Daniel Cormier, but it was a loss in a fight that will go down as one of the two best in light-heavyweight title-fight history. \nThe other? That would be Gustafsson’s legendary bout with Jon Jones in Toronto at UFC 165, when the Swede very nearly shocked the world by walking away with the longtime champ’s belt. \nSo the UFC’s a little stuck. They’ve got a guy capable of pushing their champions further than anybody, but also one who just can’t crest the mountain and actually, you know, beat the guys with the belt. \n“Listen man, Alexander Gustafsson … I know I talk about him being a model, I know I talk about him being overrated and all this stuff,” a bruised and battered Cormier said at Saturday night’s post-fight press conference. “(But) Alexander Gustafsson is an absolute stud. \n“He is one of the best fighters in the world and before I said he can go back to Sweden and model -- he’s a megastar there -- (but) I don’t want him to go anywhere. \n“This sport needs guys like Alexander Gustafsson who can go out there and lay it all on the line against the best fighters in the world.” \nThe problem going forward will be finding the right opponent for Gustafsson. He’s already lost to Jones, Cormier and Anthony Johnson -- the third member of the light-heavyweight super-elite triangle -- so he may need to serve as a gatekeeper to the top of the division for a while. \nHe’s proven he can beat the guys who populate the semi-elite tier, though, so it’s unlikely that the UFC can leave him in that role for too long, lest he ruin the aspirations of too many would-be contenders. \nHE’S COMING \nIt didn’t take long for Jones to make his impact felt on Saturday night. \nEarlier this week, the former champion was sentenced to 18 months of probation for leaving the scene of an April car crash. He hasn’t been cleared by the UFC to return yet, but he took to Instagram after Cormier’s win, breaking a lengthy social media silence. \n“I think I miss it, I don’t know,” Jones said in the video, which was quickly deleted. \nCormier knew of the video by the time he emerged for the late-night press conference and said he was looking forward to a rematch after Jones beat him at UFC 182 in January. \nHis one stipulation? The fight can’t happen in Jones’ home state of New York, where the UFC has its first show scheduled for April. \n“When Jones gets reinstated, New York is probably the only place that he’ll be welcomed without venomous anger,” Cormier said. “Why should I allow this guy to go and fight where he’s comfortable? No, he needs to go somewhere where he has to look people in the eye and hear the anger that they have towards him for the actions that he did.” \nA RESPONSE AT LAST \nThe UFC has been quiet in the weeks since a Deadspin report showed that a drug test revealed Vitor Belfort had high testosterone levels in the lead-up to his fight with Jones at UFC 152 and that the UFC allowed the fight to go on. \nOn Saturday, MMAJunkie’s John Morgan asked about the report and the world was finally given its first response from a UFC official. \nBelfort’s high testosterone levels came at a time when the controversial testosterone replacement therapy was still legal in the MMA world, and UFC vice president of public relations Dave Sholler was quick to point out times have changed. \n“I think one of the things to keep in mind with this particular topic is any suggestion or inference that there was a cover-up is just categorically false,” Sholler said. “That period of time with TRT was one that was very tricky for everyone, for the UFC, for athletic commissions and for athletes alike, I think when everybody came to the conclusion that it didn’t have a place in the sport and it was outlawed in 2014 we were quick to make sure that we too followed suit.” \nAROUND THE OCTAGON \nRyan Bader seems pretty at peace with the fact that, if Jones returns, the former champion will be getting an immediate shot at the light-heavyweight belt. Bader is on a five-fight win streak and after beating Rashad Evans has probably earned the chance to fight for the title, but he said he was willing to take another fight before getting a title shot. His preferred opponent? Glover Teixeira … Joseph Benavidez admitted the gash that opened up above his left eye during Saturday’s fight with Ali Bagautinov wasn’t going to look great in his wedding pictures next weekend … Julianna Pena isn’t back down from calling out Ronda Rousey. She might be crazy, but it’s the fight she wants. \ndaniel.austin@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:11:30.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
