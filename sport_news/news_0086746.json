But it's so much more than a simple game of connect the dots. Each level comes with objectives of how many dots of a certain color you should collect and other goals you must complete in a set number of moves. Some levels have obstacles or other twists. So while the basic mechanic is simple, it does require strategy. Two Dots gives players a finite number of lives, which regenerate over time. But you lose lives only if you fail a level, so with a good run, you can keep going for a long time. And of course, if you want a little help or some extra lives, you can buy those. Free, for iOS and Android devices. related Paper This note-taking and organization app for the iPhone is the smaller sibling of the very popular iPad app of the same name, developed by app studio FiftyThree. (Neither should be confused with Facebook's news app, also called Paper.) On the iPad, Paper has developed a reputation as one of the most elegant and clean sketching apps. Scaled down for the iPhone, the company has widened its purview a bit, making the app a bit more hospitable to to-do lists and other organizing features. Fans of Paper on the iPad may take some time to adjust to changes made for the more petite screen. Instead of organizing sketches into notebooks, for example, this app lays them out more like sticky notes on a wall. Overall, however, the new Paper app retains the clean feel of the original.
