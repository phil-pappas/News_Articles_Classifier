By the time he hit the Michigan sideline and turned it upfield, he was gone.\nAn easy 96 yards later, he was in the end zone and Michigan had a 7-0 lead, tying Northwestern’s per game average points allowed.\nThe return was Michigan’s first kickoff brought back since Darryl Stonum’s 94-yarder against Notre Dame in 2010.\nAt 96 yards, it was historic, the fourth-longest kickoff return in Michigan history.\nThe only ones longer: 100 yards by Seth Smith against Wisconsin in 1994, 99 yards Dennis Fitzgerald against Michigan State in 1960 and current U-M assistant coach Tyrone Wheatley, against Houston in 1992.\nIt was a spark the set the tone for the first quarter, where the Wolverines built a 21-0 lead.\nOn the first offensive drive, a 32-yard Jake Butt catch and one-yard Drake Johnson gave the Wolverines their first offensive score, pushing the margin to 14-0.\nAfter a Northwestern missed field goal, Michigan spent just over three minutes, highlighted by two big plays – a 34 yard Joe Kerridge run and a 27 yard Chesson reception – to get in scoring position again.\nQuarterback Jake Rudock ran it in for a two-yard touchdown and the Wolverines led 21-0.\nThe third touchdown of the first quarter matched the total Northwestern had allowed all season through the first five games.\nWolverines linebacker James Ross was ejected from the game for targeting on a third-quarter hit. According to Michigan, there will be no review or appeal on the ejection. The play was reviewed and, because it occurred in the second half, Ross is automatically ejected for the first half of the next game. The Wolverines host Michigan State on Oct. 17.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nU-M's De'Veon Smith, Channing Stribling dress\nContact Mark Snyder at msnyder@freepress.com.
