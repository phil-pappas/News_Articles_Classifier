Fortified by a 25-18, 25-18 win Thursday over visiting Dunlap in Dawson Hawkins Gymnasium in a Mid-Illini Conference match, the Lady Dragons (12-6, 5-3) bring high expectations to the eight-team tournament. Pekin has never won the tournament, which has been around for at least 20 years, in large part because there’s always a tough field. The Lady Dragons are among the contenders this year. “We have a good team,” said Pekin coach Yvonne Thompson. The Lady Dragons will face Peoria Notre Dame at 8 a.m., defending tournament and reigning Class 2A state champion Deer Creek-Mackinaw at 9 a.m. and Chillicothe IVC at 10 a.m. in Red Pool matches. The White Pool has Eureka, Olympia, Springfield Sacred Heart-Griffin and Urbana. Olympia, a tournament newcomer, is replacing 2014 Class 1A runner-up Hartsburg Emden. The top two teams in each pool will play semifinal matches at 1 p.m. and third-place and championship matches at 2 p.m. in Hawkins Gym. Third-place and fourth-place pool teams will play at the same times in Custer-Stoudt Gymnasium. “We’re back in sync and just in time for our tournament,” Thompson said about her team’s win over Dunlap (5-10, 2-6). Hannah Thompson (11 kills, 10 digs), Maddy Cash (nine digs) and Hailey Peterson (15 assists) were Pekin’s statistical leaders. No weekday blues Chalk up another sign of the Pekin girls swimming and diving team’s improvement. The Lady Dragons beat host Normal West 109-71 Thursday. It was Pekin’s first win over the Wildcats in four years. Normal West beat Pekin 86-68 last year. Claire Whiting was the Lady Dragons’ star in the win. The freshman roared from behind to tie Normal West’s Haley Dees for first place in the 200 freestyle (2:15.64) and she easily won the 100 backstroke (1:11.00). She also was on winning 200 freestyle relay (1:57.84) and 400 freestyle relay (4:14.62) teams. “Claire was behind pretty much the whole way in the 200 freestyle. It was a great race to watch,” said Pekin coach Mitch Richards. Richards said his team has struggled to swim to its potential in weekday dual meets. The Lady Dragons didn’t struggle against Normal West. “We’ve been working on changing our mindset leading up to weekday duals and it was evident Thursday,” he said. “I could tell during warm-ups the girls were more fired up than at any other dual this season.” Pekin’s Kelen McDaniels won the 100 butterfly (1:01.94) and 100 breaststroke (1:14.33), Baylee Smith won the 50 freestyle (:26.58) and 100 freestyle (:58.50), Shae Campbell won the 500 freestyle (5:58.29) and Kayla Nichols won diving (159.15 points). Page 2 of 2 - McDaniels and Campbell also were on winning 200 medley relay (2:03.83) and 400 freestyle relay teams and Smith was on winning 200 medley relay and 200 freestyle relay teams. Netters eye winning record The Pekin girls tennis team is at .500 for the season in dual matches following its 9-0 win Thursday over visiting non-conference rival Kewanee at the John Moss Courts. “We’re at 5-5 with two duals remaining. We have an opportunity to end the year with a winning record,” said Pekin coach Gary Garver. The Lady Dragons’ final two duals are on the road Tuesday against Peoria and home Thursday against Normal West. Each is a non-conference match. Pekin finished 2-4 in the Mid-Illini Conference. The conference tournament is Oct. 10 at Morton’s new Joal Stanfield Tennis Complex. Booters blanked Visiting Peoria Christian blanked Pekin 4-0 Thursday in a non-conference boys soccer game at Coal Miners Park. Josiah Wieland scored twice for the Chargers and Jon Wuebben and Noah Rodman had the other goals. Pekin goalie Braden Smith made five saves. Peoria Christian goalie T.J. Henderson made one save.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T15:09:11.253+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
