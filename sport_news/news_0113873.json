This self-balancing scooter will be communicated as the AngelBoard. It will resemble the Hoverboard from 'Back to the Future' when it comes to fun and technology.\nIt's no coincidence that Marty McFly arrives in the future on October 21, 2015 . Today we launch AngelBoard, the hoverboard that will have you gliding through the streets. The company AngelBoard operates as an exclusive global co-brand of CHIC Intelligent Technology.\nIn recent months many boards have surfaced creating controversy around who is the original patent holder of the self-balancing hoverboard technology. CHIC are the original inventors, with 22 patents and are responsible for the hardware found in the IO HAWK and other brands.\nOther self-balancing devices such as Hovertrax, promoted via the Kickstarter Campaign 2013, are based on a different technology.\nThe Original\nCHIC Intelligent Technology Co. builds the AngelBoard. The company was founded by Pan Yunhe, the former president of the Zhejiang University of Science and Technology. CHIC has been developing this technology for almost ten years.\nWhat exactly is AngelBoard?\nThe AngelBoard is something entirely new. It's not a skateboard. It's not a Segway. It's a revolution in personal transportation that is taking the world by storm. Similar to the fictional Hoverboard on \"Back to the Future\", a slight weight shift is enough to set the the AngelBoard in motion. The board can transport people up to 120 kg with a speed of 12 km/h distances of up to 20km on a single charge. Social media shows: even stars like Justin Bieber and Jamie Foxx are fascinated by this technology.\n\"We are looking forward to starting a new movement with the AngelBoard.\" Batista Gérard Ruben, AngelBoard .\nSOCIAL MEDIA\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ri9ItzBcqKM\nhttp://www.facebook.com/angelboard.io\nhttp://www.instagram.com/angelboard.io\nhttp://www.twitter.com/angelboard_io\nAll pictures: http://www.angelboard.io\nHead of press and communication\nEva Sommer\ne.sommer@angelboard.io\n+436644655690\n©2015 PR Newswire.
