He looks at me, and says, 'you thinking about it?' I was, 'oh yeah, it's done. You've got it.' He's earned that.\"\nThe 10-time All Star managed to produce a fast ball, slider and change-up against the five Phillies batters he faced and surrendered two doubles. He did not record a strikeout or walk.\n\"I think a lot of position players, sometimes say stuff about pitchers, 'why or you doing this or that?'\" Ichiro said.\n\"I can't say it was fun but I'll never talk bad about a pitcher again.\n\"I'll never ask to do that again.\"\n(Writing by Jahmal Corner in Los Angeles; Editing by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T05:30:54.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
