Effingham dropped to 4-3 and 2-3. \nA decent crowd turned out on Glynn Academy’s homecoming, but coach Rocky Hidalgo said more should show up for the final regular season game in two weeks to watch Dallas in action. \n“He’s a special kid,” Hidalgo said. “We’ve got him for the rest of this season and next year and people need to come out to watch him play.” \nSenior Garrison Hurd returned from an injury to rush for 73 yards and Morris Demery gained 50 as the Terrors amassed 347 yards on the ground. \nDallas completed 6 of 9 passes for 76 yards and a touchdown. \nThe Terrors shut down Effingham’s running game, allowing only 37 yards, but Rebel quarterback Phillip Brown proved effective through the air, completing 10 of 17 passes for 207 yards and a pair of touchdowns. \n“We were kind of flaky on defense tonight,” Hidalgo said. \n“They have a really good team and he does a good job with his players,” Hidalgo said. \nGlynn Academy took the opening kickoff and drove 80 yards to take a 7-0 lead. Dallas ran for 48 yards on the first play from scrimmage and Morris Demery carried the ball the final two yards. Scout Churchwell, one of the Terrors’ two alternating kickers, booted the PAT. \nAfter forcing Effingham to punt on its ensuing possession, the Terrors drove 59 yards on 10 plays to go up 14-0. Dallas hit receiver Ryan Johnston for a 17-yard gain to the 39, then ran for 17 to the 22. Dallas then connected with Morris Demery for a 22-yard touchdown pass and Banks Entwistle kicked the PAT. \nWith Glynn Academy threatening a blowout, the Rebels came alive. Effingham began its next drive on the 13-yard line following a short kickoff return and promptly lost three yards back to the 10. From there, Brown lofted a long pass down the left sideline that fell into the arms of receiver Demario Gant, who outraced a Red Terror defender into the end zone. McKenzie Stewart, Effingham County’s female kicker, booted the PAT to make it 14-7. \nGlynn Academy went back up by 14 on its first possession of the second half on a three-yard run by Jeremiah Anderson, but the Rebels struck back quickly. Brown capped a 73-yard drive with his second touchdown pass of the night to Gant, this time from 30 yards out. The PAT attempt failed, but Effingham wasn’t finished. \nA bad punt snap by the Red Terrors set the Rebels up at the Glynn 24-yard line and they scored on first down on an end-around pass from Dameon Roper to Jake Dangerfield. The two-point conversion failed but the Rebels had pulled to within two at 21-19. \nGlynn Academy put the game away on its next possession, driving 69 yards on six plays. Dallas had a 49-yard run that moved the ball to the Effingham 12. After a four-yard run by Anderson, Dallas carried it the rest of the way for the score. \nEach team was coming off of impressive wins over region perennial powerhouse Ware County. Glynn Academy beat Ware 14-7 two weeks ago and was off last week. Effingham downed Ware 24-21 last week. \nThe Rebels have one regular season game remaining, against Statesboro on Nov. 6. Glynn Academy takes on Statesboro next week in Statesboro before returning home on Nov. 6 to face South Effingham. \nGlynn Academy 28, Effingham County 19 \nEC — 7 0 6 6 — 19 \nGA — 14 0 7 7 — 28 \nGA — Kendall Cross 5 run (Scout Churchwell kick) \nGA — Morris Demery 22 run (Banks Entwistle kick) \nEC — Demario Gant 90 pass from Phillip Brown (McKenzie Stewart kick) \nGA — Jeremiah Anderson 3 run (Churchwell kick) \nEC — Gant 30 pass from Brown (kick failed) \nEC — Jake Dangerfield 24 pass from Dameon Roper (pass failed) \nGA — Deejay Dallas 8 run (Entwistle kick)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T18:38:42.674+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
