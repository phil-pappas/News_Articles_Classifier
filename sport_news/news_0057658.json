Reinhardt scored 58 unanswered points over the final three quarters, setting a new team record for points in a game.Bluefield Daily Telegraph - Eric DiNovo slideshow No comeback was needed this time as No. 14 Reinhardt broke its month-old scoring record with an 80-14 romp at Bluefield College on Saturday in a Mid-South Conference crossover game.As lopsided as the final score was, the game looked like it would be a tight one in the first quarter, as Bluefield (0-5) answered Reinhardt (5-0) with two long scores of its own to tie the score at 14-all.“We got out there at 14-14, and we were worried about whether anybody was going to stop anybody, but our kids settled down and played really well,” coach Drew Cronic said in a telephone interview, on his way back tom the Bluefield campus along the Virginia-West Virginia state line. “We were able to get a read on what they were trying to do, made some plays and ran away with it.”Once the Reinhardt defense settled down, the whole team seemed to play better, outscoring Bluefield 37-0 in the second quarter to take a 59-14 lead into halftime.The defense, which shut Bluefield out for the final three quarters was led by Casimir Isles, who recorded a team-high seven tackles to go with an interception. Tyler Pineda and Javier Dyer also produced for the Eagles, combing for 10 tackles, two sacks and six tackles for loss.The Reinhardt defense also had the final word on scoring, as Jalen Holloman returned an interception 70 yards for a touchdown in the game’s final minute.As dominant as the defense looked, the Eagles’ offense played even better. Reinhardt recorded 558 yards offense on only six pass attempts by riding a strong and diverse running game. Twelve different players carried the ball for a total of 528 rushing yards on 8.3 yards per carry.Niagel Curtis was the team’s leading rusher with 116 yards and three touchdowns on nine carries. After Curtis, the Eagles received rushing contributions from Isaiah Blake, Jay Ashley, L.J. Stegall and Sam Jones, who each rushed for more than 50 yards.Cronic said he had no intention to run up the score.“In the second quarter, we outscored them 37-0 and it was 59-14 at the half, and we tried to slow down everything,” he said. “We took the starters out and put the backups in. The offense scored a couple more touchdowns, and we had a pick-six right at the end. It snowballed, a little bit like the Point game did as far as points. I tried to slow it down. The kids just played really well (Saturday).”Reinhardt will be back in action next Saturday for a far tougher game, when it hosts No. 3 Faulkner in a Mid-South West Division game.Even though Faulkner lost 59-50 to Campbellsville on Saturday, Cronic said the loss takes nothing away from the significance of the Eagles’ next game and the importance of the win at Bluefield.“The kids did what we asked them to do,” he said. “We asked them to execute on the road, and they did that. They went out and played well. It was good to get some momentum going into this gauntlet we’re about to run. I know Faulkner lost (Saturday), but that doesn’t make the game any easier. It’s good to have this momentum.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T08:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:26:06.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
