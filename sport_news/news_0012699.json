They must beat Hall next Friday and then hope they have enough playoff points (opponents' wins) to qualify for the postseason. Hall, ranked third in Class 2A, lost 22-21 to Sterling Newman on Friday. \nDylan Binion ran the ball 22 times for 153 yards in the loss. He had 17 carries for 135 yards in the first half. \nThe Tigers opened the scoring with a 23-yard pass from Jake Reinhardt to Levi Bates with 7 minutes, 21 seconds left in the first quarter and never looked back. \nA 14-yard run by Binion and a two-point conversion run by quarterback Phillip Coers brought the Panthers within 13-8 with 2:02 left in the first half, but Princeton scored twice in the third period to re-establish control. \nJett Wedekind scored on a 31-yard pass from Reinhardt with 9:01 left, then Smith ran it in from 2 yards out to make it 25-8 with 4:28 left in the third period. \nErie/Prophetstown pulled within 25-14 on a 31-yard run by Seth Cameron with 59 seconds left in the quarter, but Princeton put the game away in the fourth quarter. \nFirst, Wedekind scored on a 33-yard run, then, after Cameron scored from 22 yards out for E/P, Smith put the final touches on the win with a 15-yard TD run with 3:06 remaining.
