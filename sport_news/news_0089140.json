(AP Photo/Jim Mone) \nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) — Ben Zobrist put a major dent in Minnesota's postseason bid with an RBI double in the eighth inning against struggling All-Star Glen Perkins, and the Kansas City Royals topped the Twins 3-1 on Friday night. \nPerkins, hampered by neck and back trouble that led to him losing the closer role, spoiled a stellar start by Ervin Santana (7-5) with a first-pitch fastball that Zobrist drove off the wall in right-center field. Zobrist then scored when right fielder Torii Hunter fumbled a single by Mike Moustakas. \nThe Twins entered the night trailing Houston by one game and tied with Los Angeles in the AL wild-card race. The Angels beat Texas, and the Astros played later at Arizona. \nChris Young gave the defending AL champion Royals another reason to consider him for the postseason rotation, giving up four hits in 6 1-3 innings. \nLouis Coleman (1-0), Ryan Madson and Wade Davis wrapped up the win, with Davis notching his 16th save in 17 attempts. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
