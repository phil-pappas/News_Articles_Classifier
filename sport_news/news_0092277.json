He was stabilized and transported to Desert View Hospital, arriving at about 4:16 p.m. Authorities conducted an investigation of the scene. \nArrangements were made for Odom to be airlifted to a Las Vegas hospital for further treatment. However, because of his stature (Odom is 6 feet 10 inches tall), he was unable to be airlifted, and was transported by the Pahrump Valley Fire and Rescue Ambulance to Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas. \nBrothel staff immediately called 911 after finding him unconscious, according to E!

It is said that he had taken herbal Viagra, and ordered a bottle of cognac for the room, a third of which was still left by Tuesday, according to the LA Times. \nOdom has reportedly not yet regained consciousness. Dennis Hof, the owner of the brothel, told KNX that they're \"very concerned\" about him. \nOdom, the ex-husband of Khloe Kardashian, previously went missing two years ago after a drug-fueled bender at a Los Angeles hotel. He also appeared in \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" during the on-screen romance with the reality personality.
