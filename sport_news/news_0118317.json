Greg Jones had 189 yards against the 'Canes in 2002. \nFSU (5-0, 3-0) blew leads of 17-3 and 20-10 and stumbled frequently in the red zone as Miami quarterback Brad Kaaya threw two touchdowns passes in the second half to give the Hurricanes (3-2, 0-1) a 24-23 lead early in the final period. \nBut Cook, who had two of his touchdowns on a pair of spectacular plays in the first quarter, put the team on his back in the fourth period he scored on a 23-yard run with 6:44 left -- his second 23-yard gain in a row -- to put FSU head for good for its sixth victory in a row over UM. \nCook scored the winning touchdown in the fourth quarter last season at Miami in a 30-26 FSU victory. \n\"That guy is something different ... there's something different about him,\" FSU coach Jimbo Fisher said. \nFisher said Cook \"is one of the best pure players in college football ... 222 yards and he wasn't even supposed to play.\" \nQuarterback Everett Golson finished 25-of-33 for 291 yards. Kaaya, picking apart a depleted FSU secondary, was 29-of-48 for 405 yards and threw a 29-yard TD pass to Stacey Coley to give Miami a 24-23 lead with 10:12 left in the game. \nFSU won its 27th ACC game in a row and its 18th home game in a row. Fisher, who has never lost to the ‘Canes, is now 10-1 against in-state rivals UM and Florida. \n\"We had a lot of adversity ... we left a lot of plays and points on the field,\" said wide receiver Jesus Wilson. \"We just have to finish in the red zone ... score points and finish. That's the main thing.\" \nThe Seminoles' defense, riddled the entire game to that point by Kaaya, showed some resolve on the final two possessions after Cook's go-ahead score. Kaaya completed only 4-of-10 passes for 37 yards on Miami's final 11 plays, with defensive end Demarcus Walker of Jacksonville getting a sack, forcing a fumble and batting down a pass during that span. \n\"That's what you live for, moments like that,\" said safety Tyler Hunter. \"You just have to go out there and make a play.\" \nMiami coach Al Golden, sitting on a white-hot seat after two losses in a row, is 0-5 against the Seminoles. \n\"I thought they believed,\" he said about his players. \"I love the way they compete and I love how resilient they are and how they stayed together. I wanted it so badly for them to win this game. They are disappointed but the will come back tomorrow.\" \nIt looked easy at the beginning for FSU. It turned out to be anything but. \nThe Seminoles suffered a damaging blow early in the game with the loss of nickel back Trey Marshall of Lake City in the first period on a targeting ejection, and were forced to play a gimpy Nate Andrews, who was questionable all week and not even listed on the pregame depth chart. \nThe Hurricanes cut FSU’s 10-point halftime lead to 20-17 after a lengthy 80-yard march in the third period that took 17 plays and 6:23 off the clock. Miami recovered from a first-and-25 after a penalty early in the drive and Kaaya kept chipping away, finding Coley (7 catches for 139 yards) and Rashawn Scott (6 for 108) running free in the ‘Noles secondary. \nKaaya finished the drive with a 1-yard TD pass to Joe Yearby with 5:36 left in the period. \nFlorida State bogged down on another promising drive early in the fourth period. After Cook gained 23 yards and Golson completed two passes for 33 yards, a Miami pass interference call set the ‘Noles up first-and-goal at the UM 7. Cook went up the middle for 3 yards but Golson took an ill-time sack for a loss of 11 and Roberto Aguayo kicked a 25-yard field goal, his third of the game, with 11:58 left for a 23-17 FSU lead. \nThe ‘Canes shook that off and Kaaya connected with Coley to take the lead, stunning the Seminoles with a drive that covered 83 yards and took less than two minutes. All but 4 of the yards were on Kaaya passes. \nBut Golson and Cook marched right back. Golson completed 3-of-4 passes for 30 yards, including a 20-yard pass to Wilson on third-and-eight from the FSU 18, and then picked up another third-down conversion with a 7-yard run to the Miami 46. \nIt took two carries, both of 23 yards, for Cook to deliver. \n\"It is a great feeling,\" Cook said. \"Something you cannot describe, going out there and scoring the winning touchdown, and watching the defense stop them.\" \nThe first quarter certainly held the promise of a Seminole blow out as Cook continued his trend of hot starts when he staked FSU out to a 14-3 lead with TD’s rushing and receiving in the first quarter. \nCook first answered the question of whether he’d even play when he got the start (he pulled a hamstring after getting only two carries last week against Wake Forest) and for four plays, served as a decoy. \nThe fifth play was a beauty. \nGolson went around the left side on an option, and flipped the ball to Cook, who got a good block from wide receiver Travis Rudolph and danced down the sideline for a 72-yard score. \nCook nearly stepped out of bounds and had to take one step on the tip of his toes to avoid the chalk. \nThe Seminoles got a severe setback on Miami’s ensuing possession. Marshall, the ACC’s co-defensive player of the week against Wake Forest, was penalized and ejected for targeting Kaaya, planting his helmet on Kaaya’s chest. The penalty extended a Hurricanes’ drive to the FSU 2 but Kaaya personally wasted the opportunity, fumbling on first down (he recovered, but lost 6 yards), throwing incomplete on second down, and getting sacked by Demarcus Walker of Jacksonville on third down. \nUM had to settle for Michael Badgley’s 30-yard field goal. \nCook stuck again after that, and made a bit of personal history in the process. He took a pass from Golson in the right flat, sped by UM’s Raphael Kirby and eluded Jermaine Grace and Deon Bush near the goal line to complete a 36-yard scoring play. It was Cook’s first TD reception of his college career. \nCook has rushed for 347 yards in the first quarter of FSU’s five games this season -- which would be eighth in the ACC. He led the nation in the most yards in first quarters entering the game. \nCook has five rushing touchdowns and one receiving TD in first quarters. \nBut the Seminoles began to waste decent chances after that, and managed only two Aguayo field goals in the second quarter after possessions that resulted in first downs to the UM 4-, 19- and 11-yard lines. \nFSU failed to convert a fourth-and-1 from the ‘Canes 10 when Jonathan Vickers was stopped for no gain by Bush and Anthony Moten and on the final play of the first half, a 49-yard field goal attempt by Aguayo caromed off the right upright. \nGarry Smits: (904) 359-4362", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:45:54.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
