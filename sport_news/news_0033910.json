Its evident UVa struggles to start halves. The 'Hoos know that in order to turn things around at the mid point of the season, they'll need to play a complete football game. \nHead coach Mike London says, \"The question was asked, 'how to do we make sure that we start fast or we stay on target or focus.' We stay on focus as far as who are responsibilities are.\" \nDespite a 1-4 record, nobody in UVA's locker room is hitting the panic button. The players and coaches believe they are just one or two plays away from having one or two more wins this season. \nTrent Corney says, \"If we all make one or two, or even one more play, then we would of won the game. I'm not the only guy that believes we need to make more plays.\" \nJackson Matteo says, \"Notre Dame was a tough game. Pittsburgh was a tough game. We're in those games.

He's a good man and I know that he'll have the team ready to play.\" \nMatteo says, \"They run a 4-3, similar to Pitt. I've been watching film. I know the offensive line has been too. We're ready to go as far as our jobs are concerned.\" \nVirginia and Syracuse kick off Saturday at 3:30 p.m. from Scott Stadium.
