The Indian tried to keep her nose ahead but the Thai girl once again wrested control at 20-18. \n\nHowever, a gritty Saina didn't give up and eventually turned the tables and pocketed the first game after grabbing three straight points from 20-21. \n\nIn the second game, Busanan upped the tempo and once again surged ahead at 7-4. Saina tried to catch up but the world No. 17 Thai broke off at 9-9 and never looked back to roar back into contest. \n\nIn the decider, Saina held on to a 6-2 lead early on but Busanan caught up at 6-6 and then moved neck and neck with the Indian till 11-11. After the break, Saina changed gears and zoomed ahead with a five point burst at 13-12 to move to 18-12 lead. \n\nThe Thai girl narrowed the gap but could never bridge it as Saina marched on to the second round.
