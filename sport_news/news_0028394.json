Judo, another martial art founded in Japan, first joined in 1964, when Tokyo last hosted the Summer Games, and has been included on every programme since 1972.\nOrganisers recommended a total of eight medal events, two in kata and six in kumite. They also proposed two medals each for shortboard surfing and climbing, combining bouldering, lead and speed.\n\"Each of the eight short-listed international federations amply demonstrated their potential to add to the value of the Games and I would like to take this opportunity to extend my sincere thanks to each of them for their outstanding efforts,\" Fujio Mitarai, Chair of the Additional Event Programme Panel, said in a statement.\n\"We firmly believe that by connecting with youth, bringing to life Olympic Agenda 2020 and the Tokyo 2020 vision, our proposal constitutes the best possible package that will add the most value to the Games.\"\n ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-09-28T23:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:54:40.751+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
