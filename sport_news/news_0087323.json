Now the issue that Chile will be taking on Nigeria, who happens to be the defending champions, they will be much more serious against Nigeria, because they are going to come all out to try to get the three points,\" Ugbade, the captain of the Nigeria team that won the inaugural competition in 1985, told Completesportsnigeria.com. \n\"My expectation will be that we play with care, we defend very well, ensure that the midfield remains very compact. And at the end of the day, if we manage to score one, they will want to come out, from there we will capitalize and score one or two more goals. \n\"But if we are not able to make the midfield and defence very compact, and with the pressure coming from the fans they manage to score first against us, then it might be very difficult for us.\" \nHe however expressed confidence that the Eaglets will not lose the match. \n\"But I still believe Nigeria will squeeze out something. I don't want to lose any hope and I don't want to lose any sleep concerning this because I know we are capable,\" he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T16:52:24.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
