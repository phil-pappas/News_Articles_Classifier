(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) more > By PAT GRAHAM -   \nDENVER (AP) - The Denver Nuggets have a completely new look on the floor this season - pick axes across both lanes and a mountain peak logo near half-court. \nA court redesign to match their revamped roster. \nAfter missing the postseason for a second straight year, the Nuggets brought in no-nonsense coach Michael Malone and drafted point guard Emmanuel Mudiay. They traded Ty Lawson to Houston, kept around some savvy veterans and told Kenneth Faried to transform into the “Manimal” again, using his high-energy motor to rev up the crowd and his teammates. \nOh yeah, the Nuggets also decided to return to their running ways since they have elevation working in their favor. \n“I believe we have a chance to make the playoffs this year,” Faried said. “I 100 percent believe that - 110 percent. I don’t care what anybody has to stay about it.” \nThe players are certainly seeing a much clearer picture with Malone taking over for Brian Shaw. Danilo Gallinari and Wilson Chandler signed extensions to stick around, while Darrell Arthur could’ve possibly joined the Los Angeles Clippers, but elected to stay in the Mile High City. \n“We know what this team is capable of and we’ve got the right players on paper,” Arthur said. “Just a matter of putting everything together.” \nThat’s the job of Malone and his young point guard Mudiay, who was the seventh overall pick in June. It’s his team to run, even if he is 19 years old. \n“I love challenges,” said Mudiay, who bypassed college to spend last year playing pro ball in China. “My team gives me a lot of confidence and has a lot of trust in me.” \nAfter only a few practices, Gallinari reached this realization: Mudiay is good enough to be the rookie of the year. \n“He has very good point guard instincts,” Gallinari said. “The more games he plays, the more he can help the team.” \nSteady progress. That’s all Malone is hoping for out of Mudiay and his team. \n“Whether we play in Denver or in Fiji, just want to get out there and try to get better,” Malone said. “We have to build up our fan base and get them back to being excited about the Nuggets. \n“Hopefully we can show them it’s worth coming out to watch the Nuggets.” \nHere are things to know as the Nuggets try to rebound this season:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:33:10.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
