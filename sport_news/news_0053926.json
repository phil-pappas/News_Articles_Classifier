That color, of course, is the team color of rival Texas Christian University. \nThe statue stands outside McLane Stadium. It's unclear why the statue was targeted at this time. \nWacoTrib.com reports that according to Baylor’s executive associate athletics director for external affairs the university's department of public safety was contacted about the vandalism. He said that video surveillance from that area will be reviewed soon.
