Sometimes it’s easier to believe the gods are against you than to own up to actual shortcoming. The Mets haven’t gone 29 years without a title because of some mystical force compelling them to fail (any more than you can blame the ball going through Buckner’s legs on any supernatural rooting interest).\nThe Mets mostly have been lousy since 1986 because they’ve had a lot of bad baseball players, because they’ve had some truly bad managers, because they haven’t been good enough, because they haven’t spent their money wisely, because sometimes they haven’t spent their money at all.\nThere has never been a curse attached to any of this, or a jinx, or a hex, or a pox. The way these Mets played during the season’s final two months — and all across their National League Division Series with the Dodgers — ought to emphasize the point. They were resilient. They got great pitching. They had just enough clutch hitting, most of it from Daniel Murphy. Much as their lost seasons were no accident, nether has this season been a random series of happy accidents.\nThey deserve to be here.\nWhat will be interesting, as the National League Championship Series begins Saturday night at Citi Field, is to see if the Cubs — and their fans — come to these games with an equal amount of logical fervor, understanding they will win or lose this series based upon the most fundamental question the sport allows: Can Chicago’s gifted young hitters get the better of the Mets’ talented young pitchers, or will it be the other way around?\nYour browser does not support iframes. This will not be about Billy Sianis’ goat, or the summer of ’69, or October of ’84, or poor Steve Bartman. It never has been anyway, but these Cubs are too young and too good to be burdened by history, by 107 years of championship-free baseball, by anything other than this compelling and overriding fact:\nThis ought to be a hell of a series.\nThis ought to be a hell of a show.\n“I don’t even want to think about what it’s going to take to contain ’em, but I’ll start doing that on the plane home because we’ve got to get right back to work,” Mets manager Terry Collins said Thursday night, dripping champagne, maybe half an hour after the Mets had secured their spot in the NLCS draw. “They’re a team that believes in themselves. We’re a team that believes in ourself. This ought to be some kind of challenge, for both of us.”\nNo fan base exemplifies the potential damage of negativity more than the Cubs’. That fact hit me square in the face in October 2008. Those Cubs, like these Cubs, had won 97 games, plenty to win the NL Central in a walk. Those Cubs, like these Cubs, were managed by a supremely confident force of nature — Lou Piniella then, Joe Maddon now.\nAnd there was enough talent in the room, then as now, it wasn’t just easy to dismiss the shackles of history, you could understand why it all seemed so silly. I walked into Wrigley Field on Oct. 1, and there was nothing but positive energy. When the Cubs took a quick 2-0 lead on the Dodgers, Wrigley actually felt like Yankee Stadium used to — full of swagger, full of bring-it-on.\nThen, in the fourth inning, two outs, nobody on, Ryan Dempster walked three batters and James Loney hit a grand slam.\nYour browser does not support iframes. And that was that. That was it . The Cubs lost that game. They lost Game 2. They lost Game 3. But everything vaporized the moment Loney’s ball cleared the fence. It happened that quickly. You could feel it. You could feel it.\nThese Cubs deserve to be exempt from all that’s come before, and so do these Mets. Slaying the Cardinals, dispatching the Dodgers, the Cubs and the Mets proved they are the two best teams in the league, and may well battle for supremacy for years to come. They deserve to be here. It will be a hell of a series. It will be a hell of a show. And not because of a goat, a black cat or anything resembling a celestial side show.\nBecause on one hand you have gifted young hitters. And on the other, talented young pitchers. Have at it, gentlemen. Have at it, fans. Spend your time enjoying the fight. Don’t go looking for hidden meanings and hidden messages. They don’t exist. Honestly, they don’t.\n  chicago cubs ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:46:49.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
