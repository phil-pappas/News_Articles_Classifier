Comment Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 7:00 AM By Mike MendezSports Editor Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 7:00 AM On the last week of the regular season, McPherson head soccer coach Chris Adrian was looking for his team to put together a complete game against Circle. And with a 6-1 win for the Bullpups in a ball control masterpiece, that is exactly what he got. “That was our goal,” Adrian said. “I wanted to see us put two halves together, without a dip, without any letdowns, or mental mistakes.” While the Bullpups have been inconsistent over the last few games, there has been one thing McPherson can count on, the solid play of Jose Arriola. The unheralded hustle plays from Arriola, fighting to win balls are contagious for the Bullpups. And against Circle, the Bullpup senior got to show off a little flash too. In the first half, Arriola took a punt out of the air with a behind the back flick to send Andric McGill down the field with speed for a goal. “It’s something we do for fun before the game, those little flicks and stuff,” Arriola said. “You would be surprised when they come in handy.” In the second half, McGill returned the favor chipping a perfect ball to the head of Arriola for a finish with both McPherson players in on the open goal undefended. “That is just him being unselfish,” Arriola said. “All of us are. I don’t consider any of my teammates selfish. He could have finished it himself, but he gave it to me. I’m thankful for that, but it’s just us being teammates really.” The two plays Arriola was involved with were far from the only stunning plays for McPherson. The Bullpups started the scoring quickly with Kaden Warren sending a free kick to Patrick Munsey who finished with his head to give McPherson a 1-0 lead less than four minutes into the game. The Arriola assist to McGill made it 2-0, and the Bullpups were looking for more just two minutes later. McGill was taken down in the box, and without hesitation, McPherson knew Price Kramer was going to be the one to take the penalty kick. “The players wanted that for him,” Adrian said. “That wasn’t me saying, ‘Hey Price go take it.’ You saw 10 guys on the field give the ball to Price. And to step up and just pass it into the net, a great moment for him.” After Kramer made it 3-0, McGill scored his second goal of the game on a feed from Kento Aizawa to make it 4-0. Circle got on the board with a fantastic shot from Anthony Cutsinger to make it 4-1 McPherson at the half. Page 2 of 2 - In the second half, McPherson stayed on the attack, passing the ball around, making the Bullpups’ head coach very pleased with the postseason around the corner. “When we play really simple, and not force that first pass, not only does it help our offense, it helps our defense because they are not dealing with transitions all game long. So that was a lot of fun just seeing our guys play the simple ball.” After the Arriola header pushed the lead to 5-1, sophomore Connor Williams got into the act scoring a goal with 30 seconds left to make it a 6-1 win for McPherson. “I was telling the guys that we need to build a lot of momentum going into the postseason because it is not going to be easy,” Arriola said. “It is not going to be easy, but we are going to make a statement this year, and to do that we have got to go to the postseason and go in hard.” Contact Mike Mendez at mmendez@mcphersonsentinel.com and follow him on Twitter @MendezSentinel.
