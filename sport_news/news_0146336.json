No way. Why? Because Chelsea cannot have a better manager than me. \n\"I want the best for my club and the best for my club is for me to stay.\" \nMourinho is in his second spell as Chelsea boss, his first from June 2004 was filled with success before unravelling in September 2007. \nThe 52-year-old, who was reappointed in June 2013 and signed a new four-year contract in August, insisted no alternative offer could persuade him to leave Stamford Bridge. \nHe insists Chelsea have learned from the managerial hirings and firings of Roman Abramovich's 12-year ownership and does not believe the Russian should speak out in support for the first time. \n\"The owner's profile all over these years of not speaking is fabulous. I would love to do the same,\" added Mourinho, who declined to say when he would next see Abramovich, who was at the match. \n\"The owner has that privilege. I don't think the owner needs a word, not even the club, the board, nobody. Not at all. \n\"When I was contacted to be back, I was told we had so many managers, we know you are the best. \n\"So I think it's time for the club to act in a different way, to mark a position, a position of stability, a position of trust. \n\"Three months ago we were all together in the bus with the cups. I think it's time for all of us to be together now in the bottom of the league.\" \nThe contrast between last term - when the Blues won the Capital One Cup and the Premier League title - and this is stark, but Mourinho maintains belief a top-four finish is probable. \nHe has almost conceded defeat in the title race, though, with Manchester City 10 points ahead. \n\"To be champions will be very difficult. Ten points (to) Man City, maybe tomorrow 11 points (to) Man United,\" Mourinho added. \n\"In football it's not impossible, but I think very difficult. Top four is completely - I don't say easy - but doable.\" \nOn the dissent from the supporters, Mourinho said: \"If they have some negative reaction, I would do the same, because the results are not the results that we want.\" \nBut he maintains he has the support of his players. \n\"Do the players trust me and feel that I am the man for the job? This week we spoke about it and the answer was undoubted,\" he added. \nMourinho refused to analyse individual performances, but denied humiliating Nemanja Matic, a half-time substitute who was hauled off 28 minutes later. \n\"I don't do that to anyone in football and in life,\" Mourinho said. \nMourinho suggested he would promote younger players, like Ruben Loftus-Cheek, after his senior players' struggles. \n\"Clearly it is easy to see that some players are in difficulties,\" he said. \n\"As a manager you have that situation of I like them, I trust them, I keep them, or I drop, I change. \n\"Maybe the situation is so negative that a young player feels less pressure than when the team is top of the league.\" \nChelsea in crisis overshadowed what was an impressive performance from Southampton. \n\"The whole team performance was perfect,\" Saints boss Ronald Koeman said. \n\"After 1-0 down we looked comfortable and of course to win against teams like Chelsea you need your best players on that high level. \n\"Sadio was dangerous in his movements. It was impossible to have good defending against him.\" \nMourinho complained about Radamel Falcao being denied a penalty, even though Mane had a stronger claim. \nIt made little difference to Koeman. \n\"Maybe then it was 2-5 the final result, even with that,\" the Dutchman said.
