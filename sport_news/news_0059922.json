But as a town we just pull together for every single thing.”\nThe ballcap that shielded Malfavon’s eyes from the sun read: U.S. Marine Corps the few, the proud. Malfavon said her husband, Jerry, served in the Marines, as did other relatives from both sides of their family.\n“I’m proud to wear this hat today,” she said.\nNearer to the mortuary, Lorraine Quiñones held a two-sided sign bearing Bible passages and a boot-camp picture of Ruiz. She said she is his cousin and was at the house of Ruiz’s mother, who also lives in Menifee, earlier in the morning.\nQuiñones said literally hundreds of people were at the house last weekend.\n“We have a big extended family,” said Quiñones, who came from Los Angeles with her three children. “But it’s like we’re one nuclear, immediate family. It’s really hit us hard.”\nAs the caravan accompanying the hearse, which included a handful of motorcycles from the Patriot Guard Riders, traveled south along the 215, small details of first reponders paid their respects.\nThree firefighters stood on top of a fire engine on the Highway 74 west overpass of the I-215 in Perris with a 3-by-5-foot American flag -- the sound of the steady stream of traffic below punctuated by honking horns.\n“We’re seeing lots of thumbs up and peace signs,” said Michael Kittell, a Cal Fire/Riverside County Fire Department paramedic.\nA couple of Riverside County Sheriff's Department units were parked behind the fire engine. There was a similar fire and police department presence at the Nuevo Road overpass and a handful of police officers, their cars parked off to the side, stood at the Ethanac Road overpass, where the procession of vehicles and motorcycles escorting the hearse exited the freeway.\nThe hearse pulled up to Evans-Brown Mortuary a little before 10:15 a.m. A helicopter buzzed overhead.\nMembers of the Patriot Guard Riders carried the wooden box containing Ruiz’s remains inside. Those assembled along the walkway grew quiet.\nSomeone called out: “We love you, Christopher.”\nTraci Welsh, 52, spoke for many of the local residents who took time out of their weekends to come down.\n“I think Menifee coming together as a community, it’s the least we can do,” she said. “He and his family sacrificed for our freedom. What's an hour of our time.”\nContact the writer: 951-368-9682 or tsheridan@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:09:42.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
