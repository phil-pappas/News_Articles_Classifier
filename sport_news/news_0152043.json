We hardly had any money then. I know the support of sponsors is so necessary,\" Ganguly said as Bengal unveiled their yellow-white jersey with captains Manoj Tiwary (senior), Sandipan Das (U-23) and Agniv Pan (U-19).\n\"I feel first class cricketers are a neglected group of people but that's where we produce the cricketers. Hope it's the beginning of something's good,\" Ganguly said.\nGanguly also turned emotional when clipping of his first century at the Eden in the fag end of his career was shown in an AV.\nHaving scored a century in his debut Test at the Lord's in 1996, it took Ganguly 11 years to score a ton at home -- in December 2007 against the Test versus Pakistan.\n\"It was a special moment... my dad who was ill gave me the biggest hug of his life and told me 'it's the biggest moment of his life'.\"\n\"It took me so long as I was too caught up with everyone's expectations of playing at home... I was so worked up. It would have been a gap had I not scored the century,\" an emotional Ganguly said.
