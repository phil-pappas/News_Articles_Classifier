Village officials estimate the hospital should pay them about $550,000 a year.\n\"Like many communities, we have our struggles,\" said Village Board President Erik Spande. \"There needs to be a better understanding that CDH should step up, or in other words, pull their weight. They must understand their burden on this small community.\"\nBut Brian Lemon, the hospital's president, takes issue with how the city has determined the $550,000 figure.\n\"It is absolutely fair that the village has costs that it's incurring because of the scale of our operations,\" he said. \"The struggle we've been having, though, is that there needs to be a fact-based conversation about what those costs are.\"\nThe \"good news,\" Lemon said, is that after meeting with Spande this week, both parties hope to reach a resolution beneficial to both the village and the hospital. The village has been the hospital's home for 50 years.\n\"We've begun some very collegial, earnest conversations about the situation, and how we can go forward with a real, sincere intent to come to a negotiated solution to the problem,\" Lemon said.\nVillage officials claim the full-service hospital, which has 380 beds and more than 1,200 physicians , is the largest user of the village's roads, generating more than 10,000 round trips daily. Officials also say the hospital is the largest user of Winfield's sewer system and law enforcement.\nMore than 10 percent of the village's operational budget goes to free services for the hospital, Spande said.\nBesides creating the special committee to assess the degree of what Spande calls a \"financial burden,\" the village released a newsletter to residents publicizing the hospital's profits.\n\"IRS filings show that CDH is by far the most profitable hospital in the state,\" reads a bullet point on the newsletter. Another one states the hospital \"enjoyed an average profit of $160 million per year over the last five years.\"\nThe village hoped the newsletter would rally homeowners toward its mission -- something Lemon felt was unfair at the time of the newsletter's distribution.\n\"Unfortunately, we're disappointed that the village engaged in some of the tactics they have in recent weeks,\" he said. \"We've said, consistently, 'OK, let's get the data on the table.' We clearly don't want to be a burden to the taxpayers of Winfield.\"\nLemon is also unsure of some of the newsletter's calculations, including one listing the equalized assessed value of the hospital's campus as $430 million, compared to $300 million for the rest of Winfield. The newsletter states these numbers were estimated by village financial officials, who used the county assessment rate.\n\"We think it's a very, very high number,\" Lemon said.\nThe hospital covers almost 60 percent of the property zoned for business in downtown Winfield, which equates to an estimated $1.7 million loss in potential property taxes, according to village documents.\nThe nonprofit hospital maintains tax-exempt status by reporting charity care costs that should eclipse the value of their tax exemption. In 2013, the hospital provided $55 million in charitable activities and unreimbursed Medicaid to the cities and towns it services, according to data provided by the hospital. The number is almost seven times the amount required by state law to qualify for tax exemption, Lemon said.\nBut Winfield officials argue that the financial burden of the hospital on the city, which they estimate at $42 million annually, outweighs the benefit of charity care for Winfield residents, which they estimate is about $5 million annually.\nFurthermore, Winfield taxpayers shoulder the entire burden of the tax exemption, while cities like Wheaton, West Chicago, Warrenville, Carol Stream, Glen Ellyn and Glendale Heights enjoy the benefits of free charity care, village officials argue.\nSpande said he would be \"thrilled beyond words to be CDH's biggest cheerleader,\" and hopes the two parties reach an amicable solution. He acknowledged the hospital's more than $500,000 donation annually to local Winfield organizations.\nIn the past five years, Lemon said the hospital has voluntarily donated about $2.4 million to Winfield as a whole, with about $1 million going directly to village projects and $1.4 million going to various organizations based in Winfield.\nThis year, the hospital donated $100,000 to the village's general revenue fund and $310,000 to the renovation of the village water tower, a shared project between the two parties. The water tower sits on the hospital campus's border, according to data provided by hospital officials.\nLemon said he still doesn't quite understand how the situation unraveled the way it did, but continues to look forward to preserving the hospital and the village's 50-year relationship.\n\"It's hard for me to say exactly how things deteriorated to the point that they did,\" he said. \"It's not good for the village and for the hospital to have anything other than a cordial, cooperative relationship that is based on a mutual understanding.\"\nmeltagouri@tribune.com\nTwitter: @marwaeltagouri\nCopyright Â© 2015, Naperville Sun Hospitals and Clinics Winfield Internal Revenue Service", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562ac237/turbine/ct-wht-winfield-central-dupage-hospital-dispute-tl-1029-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-24T06:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:35:13.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
