That would be all the scoring the Indians (6-2-3) would need in a 5-0 win over league rival North Quincy. “The Patriot League is tough,” Hanover coach Steve Rodday said. “Every game is a battle. Today, North Quincy, for the beginning of the game, they took it to us, but we were able to fight through it.” The game was a stalemate until sophomore Zachary Chase found the back of the net in the 22nd minute out of a scrum in the box off a corner. Shortly after, senior Matt McGillivray tallied another goal to give Hanover a 2-0 lead into the half. “We’ve been working on details in practice sessions,” Rodday said. “We translated it today into putting the ball in the back of the net.” The second half was all Hanover as the Indians received goals from senior David Burton, sophomore William Cleaves, and McGillivray. McGillivray, a first-year player with the program as a senior, has eight goals on the season to lead the Indians. “He’s a basketball player,” Rodday said of McGillivray. “In his first year out, he’s just relentless. A hard-working kid who gives you everything he’s got when he’s out there. He’s done fantastic for us, couldn’t have asked for anything better.” Defensively, Hanover was able to keep the ball out of its own end, leaving senior goalkeeper Jonny Ferrarini (three saves) relatively unchallenged. Sophomore Joe Doyle (four saves) combined with Ferrarini to record the shutout, taking over in the 67th minute. “Defense is definitely the strength,” Rodday said. “Focused and working together. It starts in the back – take care of the defense and the offense will come.” North Quincy stayed in the game early thanks to solid play from senior goalkeeper Joey England (15 saves). Among England’s stops was a sprawling, one-handed save off a wide-open shot in the box. “All five of their goals, none of them were great opportunities,” North Quincy coach Rich Hanlon said. “Just bad bounces and we tend to make some mistakes on defense and teams capitalize.” North Quincy matches up with Scituate on Friday, while Hanover moves on to face Pembroke on Thursday in a game that will pit the top two teams in the Fisher Division of the Patriot League. “Every time you play Pembroke it’s a big game,” Rodday said. “They’re a good, quality team. They give you a game every time. I expect nothing less. They’ll be ready to go and we’ll be ready to go.” David Konowitch The Patriot Ledger, Quincy, MA David Konowitch Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 11:15 PM Updated at 11:24 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:51:01.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
