Peter Ellwood, WFAA Sports 11:55 a.m. CDT October 2, 2015 Rangers turnaround in 2015 mirrors ability to transform the bullpen Texas Rangers relief pitcher Shawn Tolleson (37) is doused with water and Powerade by Texas Rangers shortstop Elvis Andrus (1) and second baseman Rougned Odor (12) (Photo: Jerome Miron, Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThere are many reasons the 2015 Texas Rangers have done a 180-degree turn from their 7-14 start in April, or from being eight games out of the division lead on July 28th, to now being on the precipice of clinching the sixth AL West division title in franchise history. At the top of the list has to be the transformation of the bullpen from one of the worst in baseball to one of the very best. \nSince the beginning of September, the Texas bullpen has pitched 86 innings with a 1.99 ERA, allowing a .194 opponents' batting average. The last time the Rangers' bullpen gave up a lead in the 7th, 8th, or 9th innings was before September. The back of the bullpen (Shawn Tolleson, Sam Dyson, Keone Kela, and Jake Diekman) have combined to allow five earned runs in their last 39 2/3 innings pitched, good for a 1.13 ERA. \nIn Yovani Gallardo's 11 starts since the trade deadline, he has not recorded an out in the seventh inning, or exceeded 101 pitches. And yet the Rangers are 8-3 in those 11 starts. Since the start of September, he hasn't even finished the sixth inning, or exceeded 93 pitches. The strength of the bullpen has allowed Jeff Banister to pull Gallardo before he loses all effectiveness, or ever gets close to turning the batting order over a fourth time. \nThis is the same team whose closer to begin the season was designated for assignment, whose eighth inning man was optioned, and was forced into a \"no roles\" all-hands-on-deck approach to hold on to whatever lead it possibly could, oftentimes unsuccessfully. The Rangers' bullpen ERA MLB ranks by month of the season are: 16th, 27th, 28th, 27th, 13th, and 1st. \nOne of the big reasons for the turnaround in the bullpen has been the addition of pitchers with swing-and-miss stuff. The bullpen's K/9 rate has jumped from 7.5 K/9 in the first half of the year (27th in MLB) to 9.1 in the second half (7th in MLB). The bullpen transitioned from giving a big chunk of innings to Ross Detwiler, Anthony Bass, Tanner Scheppers, and Neftali Feliz into where it is today, with the core four at the back of the pen but also Sam Freeman, Andrew Faulkner, and Luke Jackson showing the ability to come in and miss bats too. \nShawn Tolleson has been a steady anchor at the back of the pen all season long, and his efforts cannot be discounted. But the two biggest lynchpins in the bullpen facelift have to be Sam Dyson and Keone Kela. \nThe Rangers acquired Dyson from the Marlins for two minor leaguers, and instantly looked like they robbed Miami in broad daylight, especially considering Dyson is under team control for the next five years. While with Miami in 2015, Dyson had a 3.68 ERA and a 1.32 WHIP. He threw his sinker 44% of the time for Miami. Since coming to Texas, he has thrown his sinker 73% of the time, and is allowing a .189 batting average on his sinker. His stats with Texas are a 1.23 ERA and a 0.92 WHIP. In his last 12 appearances, he has averaged 12.75 pitches per inning, or 3.5 per batter faced, while still striking out a batter per inning. He is so effective, efficient, and effortless on the mound I have legitimately wondered if he could pitch one inning every single day. The Rangers' acquired him for cheap, and converted him into essentially a one-pitch pitcher, content to let batters pound his power sinker into the ground or fan on it completely. \nOn April 21st, Rangers' minor league aficionado Michael Tepid tweeted , \"FWIW, Keone really turned it on in the second half of '14. Arm got loose and velo ticked up. Could very well happen again this season.\" Well, Kela went from being a solid addition as a rookie in the bullpen in the first half of the year to being unhittable in the second half. Before the All-Star Break, opponents hit .270 off Kela with a .703 OPS, and he allowed a 1.38 WHIP with 8.8 K/9. Since the All-Star Break, opponents have hit .149 with a .429 OPS, and Kela's WHIP is 0.76 with a 12.5 K/9 rate. The Rangers' are managing his workload, and not using him on back-to-back days, but when he has been in the game he has been absolutely dominant. \nTexas opened the season without a left-handed option in their bullpen, and for months the search went far and wide to discover some southpaw capable of getting outs in relief. Now, the Rangers have Diekman (who came in the Cole Hamels trade), Freeman, and Faulkner as options to come out of the bullpen, and the rookie Faulkner has been the best of the bunch against left-handed hitters. \nWere Jeff Banister able to be completely candid publicly in May, June, and July, we may have heard the desperation in his voice as he searched for any warm body he could depend on consistently in relief. Now, he has a plethora of weapons at his disposal in the bullpen. It's not only a big reason why the Rangers are a win from locking up the AL West this weekend, it's also a big reason why they could be a scary team for opponents to face in the postseason. Recent history has shown us that having the best starting rotation in the postseason is not as much of an edge as having the best bullpen in the postseason. And right now, there is no team in baseball with a better bullpen than the Texas Rangers. \nBe sure to follow Peter on Twitter @futuregm for much more on the Texas Rangers.
