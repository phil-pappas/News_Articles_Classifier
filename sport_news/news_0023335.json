Pocock clearly knees Baldwin in the back but gets off with a slap on the wrist, and Ireland’s Sean O’Brien gets a week ban after a premeditated punch on Pascal Pape in full sight of the referee,\" Logan told London's Daily Telegraph. \n\"Two Scottish players with a perfect disciplinary record get a three-week ban for clearing out a player with no malicious intent at a ruck just because he fell awkwardly. There is no level playing field. This is a shameful decision.\" \nIn fear of serious head and neck injuries, World Rugby insists on heavy punishments for tackles where a player is lifted above the horizontal but not helped safely back to ground. \nScotland, who have 48 hours to appeal the decision, face Australia in the last of the four quarter-finals at Twickenham on Sunday. \n\"World Rugby has totally devalued a World Cup quarter-final,\" added Logan, who played 70 times for his country around the turn of the century. \n(Reporting by Nick Mulvenney , editing by Amlan Chakraborty) \nOur top photos from the last 24 hours.
