The Chargers played mostly subvarsity opponents and went 9-0 during their first season, which included a pair of varsity wins against Santa Maria and Marine Military Academy of Harlingen. From the very beginning, a favorable Brownsville ISD zoning designation provided the school with ample student numbers for its extracurricular programs. \nDuring the course of its brief history, Brownsville Veterans has continued to enjoy success and make Brownsville proud, particularly in 2012 when the Chargers went 9-3 and advanced two rounds in the Class 5A Division II playoffs. That took place during the Chargers’ first year as members of District 32-5A. \nThe current Chargers find themselves 6-0 with a 3-0 mark in District 32-6A as they prepare for an important district showdown at 7:30 p.m. Friday against San Benito (4-2, 2-1) at the Greyhounds’ Bobby Morrow Stadium. \nThis week’s action for Metro-area teams gets under way at 7 p.m. Thursday when Harlingen South (1-4, 1-2) comes to Brownsville to play Rivera (0-6, 0-3) in a 32-6A game at Sams Memorial Stadium. \nBesides the Brownsville Veterans at San Benito game, competition continues in 32-6A at 7:30 p.m. Friday as Los Fresnos (6-0, 3-0) plays at Harlingen High (4-2, 2-1) in The Brownsville Herald’s Game of the Week. \nIn other games at 7:30 p.m. Friday involving Metro-area teams, it’s Porter (4-2, 2-1) vs. Pace (1-4, 1-2) at Sams for a District 32-5A contest and Port Isabel (4-1, 1-0) at Rio Hondo (4-1, 1-0) in District 16-4A Division II action. \nThree Metro-area teams play Saturday as Lopez (1-4, 1-2) and Hanna (2-4, 0-3) square off in a 32-6A game at 7 p.m. at Sams and St. Joseph Academy (5-1, 1-0) travels to San Antonio St. Anthony’s (3-3, 0-1) for a 2 p.m. TAPPS district contest. \nBrownsville Veterans has followed a successful path that was initiated by Mark Guess, the Chargers’ first football coach/athletic coordinator. \nGuess coached the Chargers two seasons as they went 9-0 in 2010 and 8-1 in 2011, playing with no seniors and losing only to Port Isabel 31-15 in a varsity game. In 2012, Guess became the Brownsville ISD athletic director and was succeeded at Brownsville Veterans by current coach David Cantu, who had been the coach at Rivera. \nGuess welcomed the opportunity of starting the Chargers’ athletic program from scratch when he was hired in 2010. \n“There are two things I believe were important,” said Guess, who came to Brownsville Veterans after coaching at West Oso. “The first thing was hiring the right coaches that would benefit the program. (Secondly,) studying the culture of athletics here, it was decided we were going to set some high standards that we were going to follow. Our focus was on winning rather than making excuses as to why we couldn’t win. \n“An important part of that is having discipline in the program,” Guess added. “They’re first of all students and then student-athletes. They had to understand that passing their classes was what was going to allow them to participate (in sports). \n“I take a lot of pride in the success the Chargers are enjoying. (As athletic director,) I want to see all of our schools be successful. (In reality,) they can’t all be successful every year because that’s just the nature of high school athletics. I’ll continue to support all of them.” \nFor more on this story, visit RGVSports.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:12:48.213+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
