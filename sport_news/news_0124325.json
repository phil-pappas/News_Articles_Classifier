Notre Dame has only been forced to punt once in the last two years. Based off performance through four games, this is the best Navy defense in a long time. The Midshipmen rank highly in all the national categories, allowing just 333 total yards and 15 points per game. This will be the stiffest test by far and the Navy defense needs to show up. Nose guard Bernie Sarra and his defensive line mates must find a way to hold the point of attack against a massive offensive line led by left tackle Ronnie Stanley (6-5, 315) and center Nick Martin (6-4, 301). It is imperative the line keeps blockers off inside linebackers Daniel Gonzales and Micah Thomas, who are asked to make the majority of tackles against the run. It would be huge if the Navy defense could force a few turnovers in order to give the offense a few extra turns. Notre Dame head coach Brian Kelly said Navy has \"played the kind of defense that I think a Top 25 team plays.\" The Midshipmen allowed six explosive plays (passes of 20 yards or more, runs of 10 yards or more) by the Fighting Irish last season and interim defensive coordinator Dale Pehrson said that cannot happen again. \nNOTRE DAME KEY: Fast, decisive on defense \nMuch has been made of the fact Notre Dame shut down Georgia Tech and its triple-option earlier this season. While the media has focused on defensive coordinator Brian Van Gorder's strategy of constantly changing fronts to confuse the Yellow Jackets, the real reason behind the impressive defensive performance was the Fighting Irish were dialed in and not at all hesitant. Coaches always talk about how you cannot replicate the speed of the option in practice, but the defensive effort against Georgia Tech indicates that Notre Dame did a pretty good job. Irish defenders such as outside linebacker Joe Schmidt, inside linebacker Jaylon Smith and safety Max Redfield were flying to the ball and simply beat blocks the Yellow Jackets were trying to execute. Navy offensive coordinator Ivin Jasper will probably use a variety of formations to confuse the Notre Dame defenders and slow them down a bit. \"They aren't going to sit in one defense so we have to keep mixing things up to keep them off-balance. It's just a matter of finding that honey hole. We have to keep trying different things in order to move the ball. It all comes down to blocking and getting them on the ground then making sure the ball is dealt where it's supposed to go,\" Jasper said. \nINJURY REPORT: Navy – Starting left guard E.K. Binns (elbow) and backup outside linebacker Myer Krah (leg) are probable; Starting safety Kwazel Bertrand (broken ankle) is out for the season. Notre Dame – Quenton Nelson (ankle) and Tyler Luatua (concussion) are questionable.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:29:31.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
