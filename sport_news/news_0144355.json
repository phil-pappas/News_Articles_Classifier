Most of the events that were planned for Friday have now been moved to Saturday with the first practice sessions set to go at 8 a.m. and the first green flag for the modified heat races waving at 9:10 a.m.\nThe day was lost but it was not for lack of trying. When the rain stopped just past 1 p.m. the track crew got to work and were well on their way to getting the track ready. Just past 3 p.m. the surface was working in well but a few brief showers undid a lot of the work that the packers did and within the hour the news came that the day would be a wash out.\n\"We did everything we could to try to get some of the racing in today but ultimately Mother Nature would not cooperate,\" DIRTcar's Chris Dolack said. \"We're looking forward to a really busy Saturday with an earlier start. It will be the last weekend at the Fairgrounds and it will be the biggest ever.\"\nNow fans and teams will basically do two days of racing in a 10-hour period. It's the tightest schedule DIRTcar has ever attempted at the mile and with 17 events on the schedule it is the busiest as well.\nWhen the track looked to be coming around the reaction from the racers was mixed with some wanting to run whatever the case was just to boost their chances at a good starting spot while others were content to call it a day.\n2013 Syracuse 200 winner Billy Dunn is the only driver who is locked into both the 358 and big-block modified features so you'd think he would be happy to sit back and relax but he was ready to get on the track if he could.\n\"I mean that's part trying to get your work done on pole day to get locked into both and we did that,\" Dunn said. \"Of course we want to race, we enjoy racing here. We're starting up front in both and I think we've got good cars so we want to race if we can but conditions don't seem to be the best right now.\"\nGary Tomkins only found a ride the day before time trials and the only laps he has in the Mike Payne owned 7z was the two laps he did in qualifying. You'd think he would want to better his starting spot after qualifying 60th out of 75 cars but he was also going to be very content if he had to use his guaranteed starter status and start at the rear.\n\"Right now I don't want to race today,\" Tomkins said. \"They're not going to race at night. I'd just assume to say that's it, let's call it a day and we'll do something tomorrow. It supposed to be nice tomorrow. They'll have more chances to get the track worked in correctly. Everything won't be rushed and then we can go race.\"\nRevised Schedule 6:30 a.m. Pit Gates Open 6:30 – 7:30 a.m.DIRTcar Pro Stock Inspection Opens 7:30 a.m. DIRTcar Pro Stock Series Draw for qualifying position opens-location at Series Command Center 7:30 a.m. DIRTcar 358 Modified Series Championship Drivers and Crew Chief Meeting (Infield Media/Pit building) 8 a.m. DIRTcar Pro Stock Series First Practice 8:25 a.m. DIRTcar Sportsman Modified Series Practice 8:50 a.m. USAC Silver Crown Practice 9:10 a.m. DIRTcar 358-Modified Twin 20s 10:15 a.m. Big-Block Modified Triple 20s 11:30 a.m. DIRTcar Pro Stock Series Time Trials 11:50 a.m. DIRTcar Sportsman Modified Time Trials 12:20 p.m. DIRTcar 358-Modified Series Last Chance Qualifying Race(s) 12:50 p.m. Super DIRTcar Series Big-Block Modified Series Last Chance Qualifier 1:30 p.m. USAC Silver Crown Pre Race 1:45 p.m. USAC Silver Crown Race (Salt City 78) 3:15 p.m. DIRTcar 358 Modified Series Salute the Troops 150 Pre-Race ceremonies 3:30 p.m. DIRTcar 358 Modified Series Salute the Troops 150 (150 laps) 5:15 p.m. DIRTcar Pro Stock Last Chance Qualifier 5:45 p.m. DIRTcar Sportsman Modified Last Chance Qualifying Race(s) 6:45 p.m. DIRTcar Pro Stock Futures Race 7 p.m. DIRTcar Sportsman Modified Futures Races 7:30 p.m. Twin 25's – World of Outlaws Sprint Cars plus \"Win and You're In\" Modified at Rolling Wheels Raceway (Mod Winner Earns 45th starting spot in Syracuse 200) 'Nothing super about a half mile track' Most drivers and fans are not happy that the mile track at the fairgrounds is going away after this weekend and evidence of that was on display Friday. Several signs at campsites and around the track echo the frustration many are feeling.\nThe Turn 3 gang who have been watching the races from temporary scaffolding for many years now had two sings on display. \"Cuomo and Mahoney murdered the moody mile,\" and \"There is nothing super about a half mile track,\" while another group in Turn 4 said, \"No mile, no Super DIRT Week, no votes.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:52:46.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
