Prosecutors accused him of conspiring with radical Muslim cleric Abu Hamza al-Masri to establish the camp 15 years ago.\nAswat apologized to the court and to his family before hearing the sentence. Defense attorneys said afterward he will get credit for about 10 years behind bars while fighting extradition in the United Kingdom.\nThe lawyers also said that Aswat will seek to serve the remainder of his time in Britain.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:00:16.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
