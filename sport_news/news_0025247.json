Opening statement … “Excited about this week. Obviously, it is going to come very quickly so we have to get ready for a Wednesday-like practice today. We have another great opportunity, playing Auburn at home on national TV on Thursday night. We are excited and our team has prepared well during the off week and we are anxious to get going.” On the difference playing on Thursday night … “It is different because you don’t have quite as much time. It was nice, we got basically one whole extra day off on the front end. So I gave them Sunday and Monday off (after EKU game) where you are normally off on Sunday, they also had Monday off. We came back and practiced Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, coaches recruited on Friday and then it was a quick turnaround because Saturday morning was basically Monday for us. We got a day on the front end and then we will get a day or two on the back end as well. So, a little different. That is how it is different when you follow it up with a Thursday game.” On the bye week … “It definitely gave us some time healing up for the most part. We are at midseason and banged up a little bit, but we will have to deal with that, most teams are.” On Jordan Swindle’s status … “Jordan will be back. Yes, he will. The guys that are question marks would be Jordan Jones and possibly Cory Johnson as well, he got rolled up in practice a little bit.” On the team’s redzone offense … “First thought is that we have been efficient and made the most of our opportunities. As you know, we have had some ups and downs on all sides of the ball – offense, defense and special teams. But we have been efficient in the redzone and that is some of the reason we are 4-1 and some of the reason we have won some close games. In some games, we got it in the endzone that was the difference, in other games getting a three here and there helps as well. For the most part, we have been good with the ball not putting the ball on the ground a bunch with fumbles and things. That is an important statistic and again it has probably helped us to get to this point.” On Auburn searching for their identity on offense and if that makes it challenging to prepare … “No, if you look at what Auburn has done over the years their offense is very hard to defend. By no means is it very much fun for us defensive guys to prepare for that offense. They put a lot of stress on you. You have heard me say it time and time again, anybody that uses the quarterback in the run game puts stress on you. And then add numbers and taking shots downfield and so on. Just like most people would sit here and tell you, they wish they could have a few throws over and a few things over. They are plenty capable and very well coached and put a lot of stress on you.” On Auburn struggling with a I-AA school similar to UK vs. EKU … “Again, like a lot of teams in the country, you all cover us every day and you see that and see our ups and downs. But if you look at college football, which I am sure you do, most teams are going to have some struggles. You are guaranteed 12 games and very rarely are you going to see a team play 12 clean games. The key is to win the game when you are not playing your best. They did that and we were fortunate enough to do that.” On Boom Williams’s status … “He is back in good standing and he was back for the Eastern game for a few days and ever since he has been back 100 percent and good to go.” On if he appreciates the game more since he couldn’t be on the field vs. EKU … “I hope so. I believe so. That is part of us building our program and growing and bringing along some young guys still. Just because we have talked about him for a year and a half doesn’t mean they are grown yet. We have a lot of kids in that situation that we are still trying to bring along. You know how we feel about playing in this league and competing at a high level. You better have some grown men. I know that term is used a lot, but you have to be grown and mature and you have to have some depth. We are working in those areas.” On how much it helped to have that open weekend … “I think it can help, it certainly could have really hurt us as well by the way we played. No disrespect to Eastern, but just how we played. There are no days off in this game. There just isn’t. You have heard me say it and I said it after the game, we respect all of our opponents and it’s about preparation and what you do and how you play. Again, it is hard to do but what we are all striving to do is play at that high level all the time.” On if the team learned vs. EKU not to underestimate anyway and play with a chip on their shoulder at all times … “I hope so. I hope so. You will have to ask them. We have had good practices and I have seen good energy. I have asked them to invest off the field and really do some things to take care of their bodies and try to heal up and get some rest to go through a tough stretch we all know is coming.” On some areas he wants the team to improve … “There are plenty of areas we need to get better at. Defensively, it is position on the football and making good tackles and finishing plays. Offensively, same thing, Coach (Shannon) Dawson is here and he will visit with you guys in a minute. Both sides of the ball and on special teams, it can’t be 10 guys, just one person here and one person there completely derails you. Certainly offensively, because you can have one guy on one play in a series and it ruins your whole series. I think just getting consistency across the board and getting everybody on the same page and again, I want to see that great energy, focus and passion on every play.” On if the team is practicing like he wants them to … “Much better. You can tell as a coach when guys are out there going through the motions, we have been beyond that. But you need to see again that consistency. You can’t be up one day and down another and good in one session of practice and down in another. I have seen the focus, what I am talking about there is not just physical but the mental focus that goes into it. You have to be sharp. Yes, I think we are much better in that area. No coach is going to be completely contempt with where you are at in that area or any area, but we are getting better. I really liked it over the last week and a half.” On Dorian Baker’s game vs. EKU … “Well, that is what I did appreciate was the word I was talking about there is consistency. He was much better in that game for the whole game. Not perfect, but he had a focus about him from the beginning of the game that he worked on not to get so amped up or hyped up where he can’t focus or concentrate or execute. If he wants to be a great player and we want him to be a great player, you have to make plays when the game is on the line. That is a start. Let’s not anoint him yet, or talk nice about him too much yet. Let’s make him prove it. That is a good start and I love his attitude and toughness. He brings an energy you like as a coach.” On extra motivation for the team to play on a Thursday night … “I think there is a focus and an energy. We need to be consistent in that approach. I haven’t seen anything above and beyond and quite honestly I don’t want it to be that way. I want to see a good workman’s like approach all the time with that energy and enthusiasm and I have seen that. I think a day off or two helps. The mental pressure to have a few days off so you don’t have to be locked in quite as much. You know, that Sunday/Monday extra day to just decompress in the season is quite valuable. I think that has helped.” On Patrick Towles vs. EKU … “I think what was tough about him is he obviously had some tough series, tough throws, some plays he would like to do over, but he hung in there and made plays when the game was on the line. We talk about that all the time. That is part of growing and being a good football team. You may not play your best, but you have to play your best in certain situations to win games. Conversely, you could play a great game and not play a two-minute drill well or an overtime well and get a loss. Situations are big and I thought he managed it very well down the stretch and made some big plays when the game was on the line.” On Auburn’s Peyton Barber and what he has done to their offense … “I think they are very talented across the board at running back. I feel like him and the freshman as well are tough runners. We were just talking about that in our defensive meeting, they are going to be physical. This offense every year it starts with them having a mentality they are going to be physical and their backs are good runners and very physical. Their tackles are extremely good football players and their offensive line is good. They put a lot of pressure on you and it starts with a physicality about them and their backs are good players.” On difference preparing with questions for Auburn at quarterback … “No, you have to be prepared for all their stuff all the time. I think there are some differences in their strengths and weaknesses but it doesn’t change our approach at all.” On if the read-option is the most unique offense UK will face all year … “I am not for sure if you could put that on it. I will be sitting right here next week talking about our next opponent putting a lot of stress on us as well. Not that I look ahead, we never do that. Don’t get me in a gotcha. (laughter)” On doing somethings in practice to adjust to their tempo … “Yeah, we do and our offense can give us that look as well. We always try to prepare for the tempo. As you know, it is very difficult to simulate that offense with tempo. We can simulate the tempo with our offense, but it’s not the same offense. That urgency, that getting lined up, that communication is something we constantly try to stress but it doesn’t make it any easier. It is very difficult.” On Thaddeus Snodgrass … “We will see. There are other guys playing and he has been having some struggles. We will see where that goes.” On if there are any scout team guys that have jumped out to him this season … “I think as you can imagine, just like our program, we feel very good about some of those players that are over there for sure. You look at some of the linebackers and defensive guys that are on the scout team and there are some really good players over there. Same thing offensively, Tavin Richardson and Jabari Greenwood, we have been running them back and forth working with some scout team and with the offense. They are two quality wide outs. If it would have been our first two years here those guys would have played a bunch of snaps, but I think we are deeper and developing guys and bringing them along at the correct pace if you will. But across the board I think we are better on the scout team for sure.” On how that makes him feel … “They would have started and played every game no question. That is nice. I am sure they don’t like it, but they have a good attitude and working hard.” On Austin MacGinnis … “He has kicked lightly. We will see where it goes. That is day-to-day as well.” On Jordan Jones and if he doesn’t play how that changes the depth chart … “We will have Khalid (Henderson) to be able to back up either spot as well.” On getting to look at some guys that don’t get to play that much during the bye week … “That was good. We got some good work from those guys. We did take some extra reps and pushed the younger guys and just get a look at them. It is always helpful. I constantly talk about developing our team and making our players better and that is a big part of it getting those young guys reps and getting them work.” On Cory Johnson being questionable and how that effects the team at the tackle position … “We will be in better shape because Regie (Meant) will be back full speed. They both have some strengths and they are different type players. Regie gives us a little bit more stout inside and Cory is more active against spread teams. Having Regie back will help if Cory is out.” On if there is a place for both if they are both fully healthy … “Yes, definitely. You know that, you can’t get enough d-lineman. You can’t get enough anything.” On a Will Muschamp defense … “I have always had a lot of respect for Will. I think he works extremely hard and his players are always really fundamentally sound and they aren’t going to give you anything easy. They play really hard and it will be a great challenge. I have a lot of respect for Will, but like you said, we have faced it before.” On if Austin MacGinnis cannot go how does that change his thinking on field goals … “Yeah, I think a little bit. I think you have to look at that and maybe your range changes a little bit. But (Miles Butler) has been consistent and done a nice job.”Video and information courtesy UK Athletics Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T19:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:09:53.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
