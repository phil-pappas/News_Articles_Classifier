Gitschen in central Switzerland at noon Thursday. \nGusti Planzer told The Associated Press on Friday that the reason for the crash wasn't yet known, but that there were strong winds on the mountain at the time. \nStrange, from Malibu, California, became the youngest person to scale the tallest peaks on each of the world's seven continents in 2009, when he was 17. \nPlanzer said the 2,513-meter (8245-feet) high Gitschen has become popular with extreme sports enthusiasts in recent years. Another American wingsuit flyer died on the mountain July 10. \nAP-WF-10-02-15 1433GMT", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:30:23.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
