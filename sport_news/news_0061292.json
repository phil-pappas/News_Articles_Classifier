Everywhere you look, each room is filled with an impressive collection of musical instruments. \n\"We're on vacation and came to do the Badlands and the Black Hills. We like music things and we came to see the expedition and it's great,\" Peggy Overcash of Hagerstown, Maryland, said. \nThe Overcashes decided to make a pit stop in Vermillion when they saw this museum in a travel brochure. \n\"I took the Clarinet up again and I am playing with a band up in Hagerstown, Maryland. So we thought it would be fun to come and check it out,\" Peggy Overcash said. \n\"We are a very, very popular tourist destination during the summer, whether people are driving cross country and heading east or heading west. Many of them make the National Music Museum a stop along the way. It is, for many people across the country, a bucket list destination,\" National Music Museum Director Cleveland Johnson said. \nIt's also a destination that's received a lot of national attention highlighting some of its best features. In fact, a recent article in the New York Times calls it, \"One of the world's largest and most important collections of historical instruments in the world.\" \n\"Having the New York Times feature you is a pretty big deal and I think it wakes people up. People at home to look at us down the road and say, 'Holy cow, we have to check that out',\" Johnson said. \n\"The National Music Museum has some of the most extraordinary instruments in history. For instance, we have some of the world's oldest cellos by one of the most famous makers of string instruments, the Andrea Amati, which was at the MET this summer,\" Patricia Bornhofen, Manager of Communication at National Music Museum, said. \nThe museum contains a multi-million dollar collection, though staffers here say it's impossible to put a total dollar value on this priceless collection. \n\"We have the world's oldest playable harpsichord, which was made during 40 years of Columbus' era,\" Bornhofen said. \nAnother popular draw is the 16th-century Amati \"King\" cello. Andrea Amati is considered to be the inventor of the cello. This one was made for King Charles the 9th of France. \n\"It's passed hundreds of years of history, including the French Revolution, and remains in amazing condition with a beautiful painting on the back of it. And it's really one of the world's great musical instrument treasures. It's really sort of the Mona Lisa of string instruments,\" Bornhofen said. \nThe museum also displays an impressive grouping of Antonio Stradivari instruments. \n\"This is an Antonio Stradivari mandolin and it's one of two Antonio Stradivari in the world. And then we have the Antonio Stradivari guitar, which is one of four in the world,\" Bornhofen said. \nThe museum's second floor holds an equally impressive collection. \n\"What a lot of people don't realize is that there is a cross section of musical culture here. There is, literally, something for everybody,\" Johnson said. \nWalking through the museum can take a few hours with 1,200 instruments to view. Another 13,800 are also being held in storage. Plans for an expansion project will quadruple the museum's space. That project is expected to cost around $17 million and the museum is halfway to that fundraising goal. \n\"We have really crucial work that is in very cramped space, so we look forward to having the facilities that are up to the same levels as our phenomenal collection,\" Johnson said. \nA collection that's worth seeing with your own eyes. \n\"If you walk in our doors regardless of what your background is, whether you have any musical skills or any musical background, you will find in the first minute of walking through our doors something that just blows you away,\" Johnson said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:59:56.597+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
