The sexual assault investigation of Florida State quarterback Jameis Winston last fall was hampered by university administrators and Tallahassee police, according to a Fox Sports report.\nTallahassee police decided not to pursue charges in December 2013, but Fox Sports began investigating documents and discovered that Tallahassee police were returning reports in the case over to Florida State administrators when a reporter started looking into the alleged rape against the Heisman Trophy winner.\nTallahassee police also forwarded reports to the Florida State police chief, who got them into the hands of a high-ranking administrator in the university's athletics departments. Those reports then reached Winston's attorney, Tim Jansen, who managed to question two key witnesses in the case before the state attorney even learned of the allegations and launched his own investigation against Winston, according to Fox Sports.\nThe Fox Sports report also claims there is evidence of campus police officials interfering with reporters, even attempting to suggest there was no investigation of Winston.\nA New York Times report on Friday night said that \"the treatment of the Winston complaint was in keeping with the way the police on numerous occasions have soft-pedaled allegations of wrongdoing by Seminoles football players.\"\nFlorida State is currently in the midst of an ongoing federal investigation into its handling of the Winston allegations under Title IX, but the university defended its handling of the event in a statement earlier on Friday . It didn’t name Winston in the release, but referred to allegations against “a prominent athlete.”\n“The University has remained silent for one reason: To protect our students, who are after all our highest priority,” the statement read. “But as we expect other stories to appear, it is abundantly clear that the continual drumbeat of misinformation about the University’s actions causes harm to our students, faculty, alumni, supporters and the FSU community as a whole. Because of this, and within the constraints of state and federal privacy laws, we want to share with you more detail to set the record straight.\"\n- With AP\nRelated Stories Florida State defends how it handled Jameis Winston case FSU under investigation by feds for handling of Winston case Prosecutor: Sex investigation of FSU QB over Tags: jameis winston", "external_links": ["http://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/12/us/florida-state-football-casts-shadow-over-tallahassee-justice.html?smid=tw-share&_r=0", "http://www.foxsports.com/college-football/story/jameis-winston-florida-state-tallahassee-police-hindered-investigation-documents-101014"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:18:26.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
