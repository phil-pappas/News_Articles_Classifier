To them, it’s like chess on a chalkboard, or on a napkin. Whatever, whenever.\nOf course, then they’ll turn around and tell you those time-honored symbols for offensive players (O) and defensive players (X) don’t really matter that much — that the game is all about (cliché alert) players making plays.\nBut, Tuesday, at his weekly news conference, UNM coach Bob Davie was more than willing to admit X’s and O’s are of vital importance as the Lobos (3-3 overall, 1-1 in Mountain West Conference play) head into the second half of their 2015 season.\nHis players, Davie said, are who they are — not that they can’t play better than they did last week in a 35-17 loss to Nevada, and not that they don’t need to.\nThe Lobos’ offensive schemes, he believes, are well-tailored to the team’s talents and vice versa.\nWithin those schemes, he said, the Lobos must play better in the second half of the season than they did in the first. The loss at Nevada in the final game of the first half constituted a major step in the wrong direction.\nThat, Davie said, is where the X’s and O’s come in.\nOpposing defenses have found a way to effectively shut down all three components of UNM’s base triple-option offense, provided that defense’s interior linemen are stout enough to hold their ground against the Lobos’ offensive line.\n“What we’re getting is a little bit of an outside-in way of defending us. … It’s a challenge.”\nNevada, meanwhile, challenged the UNM defense with two talented running backs running behind a two-tight end formation.\nThe Wolf Pack’s success against the Lobos in the running game (351 yards), Davie said, might necessitate keeping a few more of those X’s on UNM’s side of the line of scrimmage with a bit less blitzing. It might even trigger some changes in UNM’s offensive approach, starting with Saturday’s homecoming game against Hawaii (2-4, 0-2).\nHe and his offensive staff, he said, are looking for more and more creative ways to get the ball in the hands of senior running back Jhurell Pressley.\nLast season, Pressley averaged 9.5 yards per carry — many of those yards coming on the option pitch. This year, with the pitch largely shut down by opposing defenses, Pressley is averaging 4.6 yards per carry.\n“That’s a big issue for us right now,” Davie said. “If they’re not gonna let you pitch it, how do we get Jhurell the ball more?”\nDavie said his team’s attitude, its desire, its discipline, are all fine.\n“I go more to the X-and-O thing,” he said. “… We have to get better.”\nTHE QBs: Lamar Jordan remains the Lobos’ starting quarterback, Davie said, but added there’s a good chance Austin Apodaca will see some action against Hawaii.\nApodaca entered the Nevada game in the fourth quarter. Running UNM’s run-pass option package, he completed 10 of 12 passes.\nDavie believes Jordan is equally capable of executing in the “RPO” phase of the offense.\n“I still have tremendous confidence in Lamar,” he said. ”\nBut, he added, “I think there’s a chance that Austin will get to play.”\nTHE LBs: Junior Dakota Cox and sophomore Kimmie Carson, UNM’s starting inside linebackers, were in on a combined seven tackles at Nevada — far below their usual production.\n“Me and Kimmie like to (create) havoc up in there, so maybe (Nevada) looked at that a little bit,” Cox said. “Obviously if they’re looking at us, it’s gonna free up other guys to make plays, which happened. I think that’s just the way it turned out.”\nDavie said he pays little attention to the number of tackles any of his defensive players gets. But, he added, neither Cox nor Carson had particularly good games at Nevada. That was a problem, given their importance to the defense.\n“Those two guys did not play as well as they’re capable of playing,” he said, “and that causes us to hesitate just a little bit to make sure we’re not trying to do too much as we keep building this blitz package.”", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/b01_jd_03aug_lobofb1-640x436.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T04:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:38:44.340+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
