For most, it involves figuring out the houses that go for “full-size” versus “fun-size” candy bars. But there can be a lot more factors to consider. While suburbs can be well lit street upon well lit street of houses, things can be a little more complicated for city-dwelling kids.\nTo help out, Zillow put together its list of the 20 best cities for trick or treating. It has also revealed the top five neighborhoods within the top 10 cities where candy-loving goblins and ghouls (or princesses and pirates) should head on Halloween.\nHere are the top 10 cities, in order:\n1. San Francisco\n2. San Jose\n3. Los Angeles\n4. Milwaukee\n5. Phoenix\n6. Chicago\n7. Boston\n8. San Diego\n9. Denver\n10. Sacramento\nRelated: The best Halloween costumes and accessories you can 3D print at home\nPortland, Seattle, Charlotte, and Columbus also made the top 20. To arrive at its Trick-or-Treat index, the real estate site looks at its Zillow Home Value Index . It factors in local crime data, distance between houses, and residents’ ages. The best neighborhoods are the safest and have large numbers of kids under 15 (apparently that’s the cut off age for trick or treating?), but they also allow kids to get a bunch of candy without having to travel too far.\nRitzy neighborhoods like Pacific Palisades in Los Angeles and Beacon Hill in Boston top the desirable trick-or-treating hot spots within the top 10 cities. In Chicago, Ravenswood Manor (former home of former governor Rod Blagojevich) tops the list. Basically, if you live in one of these ‘hoods, you better pick up an extra couple bags of Snickers, Twix, and Kit-Kats. Of course, if you prefer to get your neighborhood kicked off the list, just start handing out Bit-O-Honey, butterscotch, pennies, sugarless gum, and raisins. Warning: This may result in tricks.\nThis article was originally posted on Digital Trends\nContent provided by", "external_links": ["http://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/3d-printed-halloween-costumes/", "http://www.digitaltrends.com/", "http://images.worldnow.com/digitaltrends/images/562919_G.jpg", "http://www.zillow.com/home-values/", "http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/zillow-says-these-are-the-20-best-cities-for-trick-or-treating/", "http://www.digitaltrends.com/home/", "http://www.digitaltrends.com/users/jmcgrath/", "http://images.worldnow.com/digitaltrends/images/204415_G.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:48:04.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
