The 3.1-mile event, which hosted 1,500 runners, saw the Burros boys varsity team place fifth with 171 points, just nine points out of fourth. “The boys focused on keeping their places tight,”said BHS cross country coach Elaina McMahon. “They stuck to their plan of not losing sight of the teammate in front of them.” For the girls, Tawny Matlock medaled with a 15th place finish at 25:31. “The girls all used the climb to the dam to their advantage by passing many competitiors prior to the downhill back to the park,”McMahon said. “Julia Ernst and Janai Evans ran well in the varsity race.” Up next for the Burros is a trip to Oak Hills to participate in a league invite on Oct. 14. “The mental and physical toughness of this team is outstanding,” McMahon said. “[The runners] are dedicated to their sport.” By Christopher Livingston", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T07:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:07:08.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
