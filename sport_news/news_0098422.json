Kent State is 2-4, 1-1. \nThe Rockets’ Diontae Johnson took the opening kickoff 89 yards for an apparent score, but the play was nullified by a penalty. After a three-and-out, Toledo’s fourth-down snap sailed through the end zone and Kent State recovered for its only points of the day. \nToledo took over from there, and led 24-7 at the half, with Swanson and Hunt leading the charge. Swanson carried 16 times, while Hunt had 16 carries for 85 yards. Rockets quarterback Phillip Ely was 19 for 32 for 205 yards and two touchdowns. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:06:26.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
