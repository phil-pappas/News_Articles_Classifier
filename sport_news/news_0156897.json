You would think ESPN's College Game Day was showing up for this one with all the signs and banners the two schools come up with for this annual rivalry. When it comes to flags and banners for the Baylor-McCallie game, Blue Tornado coach Ralph Potter pleads the fifth. Reporter-\"What's one of the coolest signs you've seen around town over the years that you thought was pretty original?\" Chuckled Potter-\"I can't share that with you actually. That would not go well.\" Said Baylor coach Phil Massey-\"Kids are pretty clever on both sides. There are some banners I've seen on the McCallie side that make you laugh.\" Talk about clever, how bout this one. I set my DVR to record the Biggest Loser, and it kept recording McCallie Football. Nice. Sometimes the banners incorporate the players. Said Massey,-\"We had a kid that played here I guess it has been about four years ago. His last name was McColley. It was something like we have the 'Real McColley'. Baylor quarterback Wil Austin says you can't escape the school flags flying all over the Scenic City. \"There are flags everywhere. All around town on trucks and vehicles and stuff. Ryan Parker our middle linebacker, he has a nice flag hanging from his jeep.\" Correction, Ryan Parker used to have a nice flag on his jeep. Said Parker-\"I was at McAlister's right down the street from Baylor, and I come out, and there are these McCallie guys jumping all over my jeep. See my flag getting ripped off and run away with.\" But some flags or signs are kind of hard to tear down. Said McCallie offensive lineman Jay Roberts-\"Number one has to be the one on the cell tower last year. I remember coming to school on Friday morning, and I was headed to my history class. I looked out over. Is that a flag on the cell tower? Everybody was like yep, that's what that is. I was like, wow.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:07:20.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
