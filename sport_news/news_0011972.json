Both the Congress and the AIUDF have bastions among Muslims in Assam and both parties notwithstanding their differences don’t want the BJP to come to power in the state. Ajmal has all along been maintaining that the AIUDF — the largest opposition group in the state Assembly — wouldn’t go for any understanding with neither the Congress nor the BJP. But the growing popularity of the BJP, especially among non-Muslims and tribals in the state, might have forced the AIUDF to rethink its strategy. Muslims can decide the fate of at least 45 of the 126 constituencies in Assam and to prevent division of their votes, the Congress and the AIUDF must have pre-poll understanding. That is why Gogoi, who reportedly used to “maintain distance” from Ajmal, has announced that the Congress was open to tying up with all non-BJP parties, including the AIUDF. Though other non-BJP political parties such as Asom Gana Parishad (AGP), Bodoland People’s Front (BPF) and Left parties have rejected Gogoi’s offer of forging a grand alliance against the BJP, the AIUDF might have thought otherwise and prompted Ajmal to meet Gogoi at the latter’s official residence. The AIUDF won 18 Assembly seats in the last Assembly polls and hopes to increase its tally to over 25 in the next election and play the king maker after the polls.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:05:44.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
