This time, they aren't buying the supporters' argument that the new program is worth pursuing because it would boost the local economy.\nIn private conversations that sometimes have spilled into public venues, a growing chorus — beyond City Councilwoman Mary Beth Susman, long a vocal opponent — suggests the city has more pressing priorities than getting involved in higher education funding, traditionally a state domain. The proposed sales tax would amount to 8 cents on a $100 purchase.\n\"My goodness, we're straying awfully far from our responsibilities,\" said Cathy Reynolds, who served on the City Council from 1975 to 2003.\nShe has four grandchildren who haven't yet reached college age, \"so obviously I'm concerned about college costs. But I don't think Denver city government ought to be paying for it.\"\nAs ballots go out this week before the Nov. 3 election, signs pointing to a tough challenge are more than anecdotal.\nLate last month, the Democratic Party of Denver's Central Committee voted 94-69 against supporting the new tax , despite the high-profile support of Mayor Michael Hancock, a fellow Democrat.\nAdvertisement The campaign for Measure 2A — dubbed \"College Matters\" — also gains support from Gov. John Hickenlooper, a former Denver mayor.\nSupporters say Denver has a chance to be an innovator among U.S. cities .\nBut the campaign has had trouble raising money, which likely will keep it off TV and radio, except for Spanish-language stations that might help reach Latino voters, who are seen as likely allies.\nIt lagged in September fundraising behind the other two city ballot initiatives with active campaigns. It has drawn a total amount, $180,790, that's one-sixth the $1.2 million donated so far in support of tourist tax extensions for the National Western Center project.\nSurprise possible\nDenver voters may be known for approving tax measures , but political analyst Eric Sondermann said the cranky mood that voters showed in the spring municipal elections — and continue to exhibit nationally — makes a surprise possible.\n\"There's not an organized, funded campaign against it, which usually is what's needed to defeat something,\" Sondermann said. \"(But) the proponents of that measure face two risks: One is the question of whether Denver voters are approaching a (tax) saturation point, and secondly, whether there's enough public discussion on that issue that voters are starting to harbor some questions.\"\nTyler Chafee, a consultant to the campaign, says its modest budget will allow for plenty of mailers and grassroots efforts, such as sending voters postcards that are handwritten by volunteers.\n\"We will have the resources we need to win the campaign,\" he said.\nIf voters approve Measure 2A, the new College Affordability Fund will collect an estimated $10.6 million a year to support groups that provide scholarships to Denver-resident students, such as the Denver Scholarship Foundation. It also would make grants to students who don't get scholarships but need help paying off loans.\nThe need-based aid would be capped at $4,000 a year per student, and students would have to demonstrate regular progress toward a degree or certificate at a Colorado college or a post-secondary program. Backers estimate that roughly 4,500 students would be eligible.\nThe idea is modeled in part on the sales tax that funds the Denver Preschool Program.\nEconomic benefit\nHancock and Kelly Brough, the Metro Denver Chamber of Commerce's president and CEO, said at the new campaign's kickoff that ensuring more lower-income students could pay for college — or graduate with less debt — would benefit the local economy when they enter the workforce, often back where they grew up.\nBeyond economic arguments, the mayor talked about the college search now under way for his youngest daughter, Janae, a senior at East High School.\n\"If we are struggling to find how we create that economic path to college,\" Hancock said, \"I can imagine what families who are not doing quite as well as we are (go through) to make it happen — to make sure that their kids have the dream.\"\nHe sees the chance to help smart students from lower-income families as worth the 0.08-point increase in Denver's 7.65 percent sales tax. That's just over half the size of the preschool program's 0.15 tax rate.\nThe proposal originated from university, business and community leaders. Hancock backed it in July after his administration had weighed in, including by insisting on expanded eligibility requirements to enable some middle-income families to benefit, the mayor says.\nEvan Romero, 23, is among supporters who say the college tax gives the city a chance to take an important stand.\nHe graduated from the University of Denver with bachelor's and master's degrees. He's now an accountant for Ernst & Young. That wouldn't have happened, he said, if the Denver Scholarship Foundation hadn't given him $4,000 to $5,000 a year in scholarship money to close the gap with DU scholarships and loans.\nRomero hopes voters will take a long view.\n\"If you take the time and put in some money on the front end and invest in education and invest in that future as a city,\" he said, \"then those things are going to fall into place down the road. There's going to be more jobs, more skilled workers earning higher incomes, and that's going to be going back into the economy through higher incomes.\"\nCost of college\nBut the proposal has spurred pointed debate.\nThe City Council approved the measure for the ballot 8-4 after several said deteriorating streets and police staffing should be the city's focus, not education. Councilman Kevin Flynn called the college tax a good idea that \"pulls up to the wrong fuel pump.\"\nThen came the Sept. 26 vote by the Democrats' Central Committee, a large group that's hardly averse to city taxes — unlike the Denver Republican Party and the libertarian-leaning Independence Institute, which also oppose the college tax.\nThe Democrats voted after hearing former Mayor Wellington Webb talk in support of Measure 2A and Susman speak against it. Flynn also chimed in.\nOne Democrat who cast a \"no\" vote said he was motivated primarily by the big picture of higher ed.\n\"All this is doing is feeding into the escalation of college costs without doing anything about it,\" said Jim Corlett, a retired state worker. \"It helps a few people make it through, but it does absolutely nothing about the core problem of the massive increases in higher education (costs).\"\nWebb, who said he didn't anticipate a vote that day, later chalked up the outcome in part to the proposal getting caught up in Democratic infighting over Denver Public Schools' reform efforts.\nAs nontraditional uses of local tax money go, he said, college scholarships should be just as worthy as Denver's baseball and football stadiums.\n\"I always thought that this would be the most difficult out of the three (ballot measures), with 2C having the most money,\" Webb said, referring to the National Western tax question. \"The money that goes to the kids, it's always last. And so I think it's going to be a close election, but it's (going to rest on) all the people who care about us having an educated workforce for the future and having an opportunity to provide for kids to get them in college.\"\nHe added: \"I still think we're going to win.\"\nJon Murray: 303-954-1405, jmurray@denverpost.com or @JonMurray", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:16:02.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
