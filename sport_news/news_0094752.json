We had to defend a lot. That took a fair bit out of the tank,\" said Australia captain Stephen Moore. \nCoach Michael Cheika added: \"What we did was let the game open up which suited them. We had to work hard to stop them from scoring a try. We can improve again and that's really important now.\" \nSaturday's match will be the first time the southern hemisphere powers, both world champions on two occasions, have met in a World Cup final having clashed in three semis. \nThe only final not to feature either New Zealand or Australia since the tournament's inception in 1987 was eight years ago when South Africa beat England. \nAustralia, who scraped into the semi-finals with a controversial last-gasp penalty against Scotland, flew out of the blocks with 14 points on the board in the opening nine minutes. \nSixty-seven seconds had elapsed when Australia lock Rob Simmons intercepted a risky Nicolas Sanchez offload to sprint under the posts from 30 metres out and set the tone for an open and exhilarating contest. \nThe Pumas, with confidence high after their mauling of Ireland, lacked nothing in ambition but the ploy backfired again when they knocked-on from a quick tap-penalty deep in their own half. \nSuperb back play by the Wallabies from the ensuing scrum ended with a fine floated pass from Bernard Foley that gave Ashley-Cooper a clear run to the line. \nThe Pumas, who lost winger Juan Imhoff to a head knock after 20 minutes, were weakened further when lock Tomas Lavanini was sent to the sin-bin for a no-arms tackle on Israel Folau. \nWorse was to follow when captain Agustin Creevy, a fitness doubt all week, trudged off after half an hour. \nThe Wallabies quickly rubbed salt in the wounds, Ashley-Cooper this time taking a long pass from Will Genia to score in the left corner. \nSanchez's boot gave the Pumas hope as they trailed 19-9 at the break and two more penalties from the tournament's top points scorer got his side to within seven with plenty of time left. \nThe Pumas came at the Wallabies hard and it needed plenty of scrambling defence to keep them at bay. \nHaving held firm, Australia got back into Pumas territory and wrapped up the game when winger Drew Mitchell zipped through a flurry of tired tacklers and Ashley-Cooper walked the ball over the line.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:22:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:43:48.896+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
