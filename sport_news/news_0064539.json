Dance artists, ignoring comedy at their own peril, need to lighten up sometimes. Yet comic dance is rare.\nAdmittedly, it's hard to pull off. At the same time, physical comedy seems a natural for the dance world, whose performers often goof off in the studio with spontaneous parodies, funny faces, flippant gestures. Experts at physical timing, dancers can play with the musicality of any motion, giving it a comic fillip.\nIt's not as if Kelly Anderson, who appreciates and exploits humor, has no concert-dance compatriots here: Consider Hubbard Street's sold-out Second City collaboration, preceded by the excellent work of Lucky Plush and the Seldoms. But Anderson is a new voice, a recent Chicago import who established her comic cred only last November with the sometimes hilarious dating show, \"Message Me If …\"\nIn that piece, the performers talked. They don't in Kelly Anderson Dance Theatre's new \"VAUDEVILLE!\" — through Sunday at Links Hall. That's something of a loss, especially as the humor here can be silly, and the choreography and dancing less than inspired. Still, these drawbacks seemed a small price to pay for the rare treat of a fun night out at the dance.\n\"VAUDEVILLE!\" starts a little slowly and, unfortunately, doesn't include the backstage dramas reported to be part of it. It is definitely a variety show, packed with comically cheap, disposable novelties. In an hour, 12 dancers (nine of them women) bounce in and out of 14 acts, among them a magic show filled with dopey tricks, a Betty Boop-style ballet parody, an alternately Svengali-ish and foolish dancing ringmaster, an \"exotic\" acrobatic trio, a torch singer in drag, fake conjoined twins.\nOh, and a brief \"impromptu\" burlesque-style striptease, performed by the show's lighting designer, who first climbs, then descends a ladder, discarding jeans and flannel shirt to reveal nothing more than undies and a talent for the come-on look.\nThat kind of throwaway humor is one of the chief delights of \"VAUDEVILLE!\" Momentary looks and brief physical exaggerations of character create a sense of comic collusion that grows throughout the show, cementing the bond between audience and performers.\nThe music, which ranges from authentic vaudeville recordings to contemporary compositions from the likes of Evelyn Evelyn and the Dresden Dolls, inspires and enhances the comedy. Perhaps the evening's funniest bit — \"Growing Fins,\" a piece about global warming — riffs on its theme with bathing-suit costumes, complete with swim caps and goggles, and the performers' takes on the song's witty, faux-naif lyrics. At the end, they're swept offstage, detritus destined for the garbage dump.\nEspecially in the strong second half, Anderson's love of the vaudeville era becomes clear. Excavating the archaeological layers of entertainment history since the turn of the 20th century, she creates a nostalgic longing for the days when acrobatics didn't have to be Olympian and anger and aggression could be funny, not the occasion for psychotherapy.\nLoaded with references to sisters, the second half also reveals Anderson's nuanced comic vision of contemporary womanhood, evident too in \"Message Me.\" These women are funny, fond of each other, competitive, confident, insecure, even tragic in the closing number: the late Ed Burgess' \"The I Don't Care Girl,\" danced by Anderson.\nLaura Molzahn is a freelance critic.\n2.5 stars\nWhen: 7 p.m. Saturday-Sunday\nWhere: Links Hall, 3111 N.
