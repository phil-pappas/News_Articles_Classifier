Although a certain association is observable, brain volume appears to be of only little practical relevance,\" said review author Jakob Pietschnig, of the Institute of Applied Psychology at the University of Vienna in Austria.\n\"Rather, brain structure and integrity appear to be more important as a biological foundation of IQ,\" he explained in a university news release.\nThe researchers noted that men tend to have larger brains than women, but there are no differences in overall IQ levels between the genders.\nTheir research was published online Oct. 9 in the journal Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews .\nMore information\nThe U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more about the brain ", "external_links": ["http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/brain_basics/know_your_brain.htm", "http://images.worldnow.com/Revenue/images/275529_G.jpg", "http://www.healthday.com/"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:34:54.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
