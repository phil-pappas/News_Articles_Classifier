High School) took top honors in the field of 207 runners. Affolder's time was 12:14.3. \nJeremy Brown, a senior at Needham B. Broughton High School in Raleigh, N.C., edged Grossman for runner-up honors. Brown's time was 12:21.8. \nHis time set a new school record for races at Van Cortlandt Park, eclipsing the mark of 12:28.02 set by Tyler Udland in the 2008 Manhattan Invitational Varsity E race. Grossman's time, the fastest posted by a New Jersey runner at this year's meet, is the 11th-best time ever clocked by a Garden State harrier in Van Cortlandt Park history. \n\"The Eastern States Champonship was a big race for me,\" Grossman said. \"Finishing third really means a lot. Running the 11th fastest New Jersey time in meet's history feels really special because it's such a historic meet and so many great runners have raced there. \n\"I also found it fascinating to see how much I've improved since freshman year when I finished 76th (in the 2013 Eastern States race),\" His time was 13.38.4. \nGrossman placed sixth a year ago in the Manhattan Invitational's Varsity A race in 13:04.9. \n\"Matt's running really well now right now,\" Millburn High School boys cross country coach Jeff Kaye said. \n\"His training is going as planned, perhaps better than expected), and we're still focused on counties (Oct. 30) and the state meets in November. There's a lot of tough competition out there and hopefully Matt can keep improving.\" \nMILLER NOTES \nSenior Will Meyer placed 88th in 13:29.0, the ninth fastest time in school history at Van Cortlandt Park. \nGrossman, Meyer, senior Chris Stone (107th, 13:39.4), freshman Ramsey Little (119th, 13:47.1) and senior Ethan Thomas (134th, 13:55.5) posted a five-man score of 451 points, good for 17th place in the 28-runner field. \nJunior Noah Yadgaroff (156th, 14:06.0) and senior John Lacy (194th, 14:47.2) comprised the remainder of the Millers' seven-runner squad. \nVisit www.cfpitiming.com to view complete Manhattan Invitational results. \nEmail: connellyj@northjersey.com Â© 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T02:20:02.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
