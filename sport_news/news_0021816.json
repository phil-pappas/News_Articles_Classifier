The Mets scored 10 times in the first four innings against those two on their way to a 13-7 rout of the Dodgers in Game 3 of their National League Division Series Monday night.\nThe 13 runs are the most allowed in a postseason game by the Dodgers.\nAnd now, for the second consecutive postseason, the Dodgers find themselves down two games to one in a best-of-five NLDS. And for the second consecutive October, they will turn to Kershaw … on the road … on three days’ rest … to pitch the series back to Los Angeles.\nA year ago, the Dodgers were eliminated by the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 4 when Kershaw’s night and the Dodgers’ season were ended on a three-run home run by Matt Adams.\nIf Kershaw gets another chance to change his postseason narrative in Game 4, Anderson and Wood were not ready for their moment in Game 3. Instead, they helped make history, each doing his part on a day that saw 20 home runs hit in playoff games – the most on a single day in postseason history.\nMets right-hander Matt Harvey was not particularly sharp either and the Dodgers grabbed an early 3-0 lead with four consecutive hits to start the second inning. Three scored on Yasmani Grandal’s two-run single and a throwing error. Whatever chance the Dodgers had of taking a raucous Citi Field crowd out of the game with that disappeared along with their lead in the bottom of the inning.\nYoenis Cespedes started the inning by bouncing a ground ball to Jimmy Rollins, making his first start in the series at shortstop with rookie Corey Seager on the bench. Cespedes beat Rollins’ late throw to first base for the first of four consecutive Mets hits that drove in one run and loaded the bases. After Harvey struck out for the second out of the inning, they were still loaded for Curtis Granderson.\nGranderson ripped a double off the center field wall to drive in three runs. The Dodgers’ lead was gone and it quickly faded from memory as the Mets piled up more offense.\nTravis d’Arnaud took Anderson deep for a two-run home run in the third inning, Anderson’s last of the night. The left-hander allowed six runs on seven hits while lasting just three innings. It was Anderson’s shortest start since he left a July start in the third inning with an injured ankle.\nLeading into the NLDS, there was some debate over who should be the Dodgers’ third starter in the post-season, Anderson or Wood. There was probably little more than courtesy debate over whether a well-rested Wood or a short-rested Kershaw should start Game 4.\nEither way, Wood’s history against the Mets (0-3 with a 4.35 ERA in seven starts against them for the Atlanta Braves) and at Citi Field (0-2, 4.56) didn’t make a strong argument. Neither did Wood on Monday. He allowed four runs in the fourth inning, all after there were two outs – and all after the Dodgers opted to intentionally walk David Wright. Daniel Murphy followed with an RBI single and Cespedes with a three-run blast into the upper deck – his 19 th home run in 60 games since he was acquired by the Mets from the Detroit Tigers.\nGranderson made it a five-RBI night when his two-run double carried over an awkwardly-retreating Carl Crawford in the seventh inning.\nThat made it 13-4. Only a three-run home run by Howie Kendrick in the ninth inning cut into the party mood at Citi Field.\nContact the writer: bplunkett@ocregister.com\nRelated: Chase Utley's takeout slide still a hot topic before Game 3 Mattingly says Kershaw on three days rest is best option for Game 4 NLDS Game 4: Dodgers at Mets, Tuesday, 5 p.m. Dodgers-Mets box score", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/articles/utley-687278-game-mets.html", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/kershaw-687279-game-guy.html", "http://sports.ocregister.com/mlb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=351012121", "http://www.ocregister.com/articles/mets-687280-game-field.html"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:15:46.177+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
