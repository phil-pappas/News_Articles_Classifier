The money will be used for goals which “aren’t directly related to the tournament, but we want to make the city beautiful, good and comfortable, and we’re asking for extra funds for that,” Ivanov was quoted as saying. \nNizhny Novgorod’s expenses for the World Cup have previously been estimated at 77.6 billion rubles ($1.25 billion) by local authorities, putting it above the average for the 11 host cities. \nThe city’s request for extra funds comes at a time when Russian officials are keen to cut costs for the tournament, which has a budget of 631.3 billion rubles ($10.7 billion). \nThat is almost five percent below the figure at the start of the year, although the Sports Ministry is now considering a possible 12.5 billion rubles ($200 million) increase connected to training bases for teams and separate from the Nizhny Novgorod request announced Thursday.
