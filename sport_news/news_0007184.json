After the game, he called Blue Jays star Josh Donaldson \"a little baby\" for complaining about his pitching.\nThe Royals will start Yordano Ventura in Game 2 on Saturday, while Johnny Cueto will pitch the third game in Toronto. The Blue Jays will put David Price on the mound in Game 2, followed by Marcus Stroman and knuckleballer R.A.
