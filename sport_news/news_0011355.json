I told him several times to adjust the lineup but he hasn't. I will appoint an assistant coach with full responsibilities and if he doesn't like it he can leave,\" he added.\n\"I won't pay any pay-out clauses; if he wants to leave, he can go,\" Mansour said.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:55:06.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
