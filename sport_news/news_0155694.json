Delta Air Lines has also extended its partnership with the New York Mets, which puts Delta in a position to state that it remains the official airline of all New York baseball.Officially, [tweet_Quote: display=\"Delta Air Lines will remain &quot;Official Airline&quot; & &quot;Official Private Jet Carrier&quot; of Yankees & Mets\"]Delta Air Lines will receive the \"Official Airline\" and \"Official Private Jet Carrier\" designations for both the Yankees and the Mets[/tweet_Quote: ] .[caption id=\"attachment_476460102\" align=\"\" width=\"640\"] New York Yankees Legend Mariano Rivera Surprises Fans In Flatiron Plaza As Part Of Delta Air Lines' Season-Long Delta Dugout Initiative on June 9, 2015 in New York City.

It will maintain Delta's rights to its signature entitlement -- club-level spaces in Yankee Stadium and Citi Field, branded \"Delta Sky360.\" Delta has used such spaces to reach fans in their element, providing them an opportunities to sample Delta's brand and customer experience while enjoying live baseball games in their favorite venues.Additionally, Delta will receive permanent left field signage and promotional and hospitality programs with both stadiums and teams. The Mets will provide fans with a road trip promotional experience and brand integration within Citi Field's mobile application to give fans unique access and benefits while at the stadium. The Yankees promise Delta home plate LED signage, a daily in-game scoreboard feature, brand presence in Yankees print publications and hosted events with current players and Yankees alumni at NYY Steak.Delta has put a priority on owning the New York sports market. It also serves as the Official Airline of the New York Knicks, New York Rangers, Syracuse athletics and Madison Square Garden as well as all of its entities. Delta's other Major League Baseball sponsorship includes the Atlanta Braves, Minnesota Twins and Detroit Tigers.As the official airline of both the Yankees and Mets since the 2009 MLB season and now continuing those contractual relationships, the teams and Delta have found these deals mutually beneficial – the teams depend upon Delta to ensure their rigorous travel needs are met and delivered. Renewing for another eight years is a testament to Delta’s commitment to the New York market and its travelers.Since 2008, when Delta first announced partnership deals with the Yankees and Mets, the airline has flown the two teams 539,340 miles, collectively, to and from away games over eight seasons. That is roughly equivalent to 29,000 round-trips between Citi Field and Yankee Stadium.Now the Yankees and Mets both enter the postseason and hope to have to rely on Delta a bit more in their quest to extend staying alive and need to travel to new destinations to eventually make it to the World Series. Perhaps they will make it easy on their Official Airline and play each other to determine the world champion. No New Yorker, nor Delta would mind that at all.
