(AP Photo/Jay LaPrete) more > By David Ginsburg - Associated Press   \nCOLLEGE PARK — Randy Edsall was fired by Maryland on Sunday, less than 24 hours after the team’s third consecutive lopsided defeat. \nThe dismissal comes in the middle of Edsall ’s fifth season with the Terrapins. He is 22-34 since taking over in 2011. \nMaryland (2-4, 0-2 Big Ten) has been outscored 122-34 during its three-game losing streak. Including an earlier defeat against Bowling Green, Maryland’s four losses have come by an average of four touchdowns. \n“We appreciate Randy ’s tireless commitment to the University of Maryland,” athletic director Kevin Anderson said in a statement. “This was a difficult decision, but ultimately this is the best course of action for our football program moving forward.” \nOffensive coordinator Mike Locksley will take over on an interim basis. Maryland has a bye this week before facing Penn State in Baltimore on Oct. 24. \nLocksley played college football at Towson from 1988 through 1991 and later coached at Towson. He was a running backs coach at Maryland and also served as a recruiting coordinator. \nHe was head coach at New Mexico from 2009 through 2011, going 2-26 before returning to Maryland in 2012. \n“Having spent more than a decade with the Maryland football program over the course of his career, I feel Mike is best suited to effectively guide our program through the remainder of the 2015 season,” Anderson said. “Mike has previous head coaching experience and is well-respected both locally and nationally.” \nEdsall , 57, replaced Ralph Friedgen at Maryland after going 74-70 in 12 years at Connecticut. \nReports of Edsall ’s impending dismissal began last week, shortly before Maryland lost 49-28 to No. 1 Ohio State on Saturday. The defeat followed a 45-6 loss at West Virginia and a 28-0 embarrassment at home against Michigan. \nMaryland played in two consecutive bowl games after going 2-10 and 4-8 in Edsall ’s first two seasons. The Terrapins finished 7-6 in 2014, including 4-4 in their first season in the Big Ten. \nLast June, Edsall received a contract extension that was to begin in January 2017 and was worth up to $7.5 million — though only $500,000 was guaranteed. \nMaryland regressed this year, in part because of an unsettled quarterback situation. Edsall has used three players at the position, none of whom have performed effectively. \nThe Terrapins opened the season with a win over Richmond before falling to Bowling Green 48-27 at home. After beating USF, they offered little resistance at West Virginia before getting off to an 0-2 start in the Big Ten. \nMaryland’s lackluster performance under Edsall created rumblings among many of the alumni and boosters who are being counted on to help fund a new indoor football facility that will cost a projected $155 million to build.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:25:58.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
