(Photo: Special to the Press-Citizen) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBy next year, the University of Iowa's football team won't be the only program in the area with an indoor practice facility. \nThe Mid-Prairie Community School District hopes to break ground this fall on a new $520,000 multi-use practice facility in Wellman believed to be the first of its kind for an Iowa high school. \nPlans call for a 162-foot by 96-foot, steel-frame building that would be heated and lined with indoor turf, giving student-athletes, marching band members and physical-education classes a space to play year round. The school district plans to build the facility off the parking lot behind its high school and near its baseball and football fields. \nIn addition to 11,500 square feet of artificial turf, the facility will also feature batting and pitching cages, a rubberized running track, golfing nets, a football skills area, storage space and restrooms. \nMid-Prairie Athletics Director Steve Hollan said that while other schools have indoor areas for winter workouts, this is likely the first of its kind in the state in terms of the number of functions it will house. \n\"It can be used for athletics and P.E., but also for the marching band go out there for practice if it's a rainy day or a cold, wet dewy morning on the football field. It's a multi-purpose facility,\" Hollan said. \"I really look at this as a one-of-a-kind facility in the state of Iowa, and my guess is, as we get it built and other high schools see what's going on, we'll have some visitors to see what we're doing.\" \nJeff Swartzentruber, the school district's business manager, said the project will be paid for with a $200,000 Washington County Riverboat Foundation grant, along with contributions from local youth baseball and softball programs, and the school booster club. The school district, which will own and maintain the building, has also committed $75,000 to the project. \n\"There's been a group of folks spiritedly involved in this, so it's exciting to see that passion and people working on something positive,\" Swartzentruber said. \"I think the need is great enough, and the size of the building is such that instead of just having one group practicing at time, you could get two or three groups in there.\" \nBud Legg, information director of the boys' Iowa High School Athletic Association, said he's unaware of any similar indoor practice facilities of that scale at a high school in Iowa. He said while some schools rent out facilities such as indoor tennis courts or indoor soccer fields, or share a performing arts venue with a community organization, Mid-Prairie's new building is likely unique. \n\"Obviously with the way the weather gets here, and the number of activities you have â€” necessity is the mother of invention,\" Legg said. \nThe school district hopes to break ground as soon as late October or early November, and the hope is to have the building complete by late spring. Hollan said organizers are still seeking about $40,000 in additional donations to reach their fundraising goal. \nReach Josh O'Leary at joleary@press-citizen.com or 887-5415, and follow him on Twitter at @JD_OLeary .
