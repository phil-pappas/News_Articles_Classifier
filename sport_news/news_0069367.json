This is the target, rather than making the calculation to arrive behind.\"\nRossi returns to Phillip Island to defend what seemed the most unlikely of race titles.\nA distant second to Honda's runaway leader Marc Marquez last year, Rossi had all but resigned himself to another podium spot behind the Spaniard but his rival spun out of the race 10 laps from the end.\nThat gave Rossi his sixth premier class win in Australia and first at Phillip Island in 10 years.\nThe Italian has barely looked back on his rejuvenated Yamaha, claiming four race wins this year to draw close to another championship, five years after his last was sealed at Phillip island in 2009.\nDouble world champion Lorenzo has had his troubles Down Under, slicing off part of a finger during a crash one year, but he also has some fine memories.\nHe claimed the second of his championships at Phillip Island in 2012 with a safe podium spot behind retiring local hero Casey Stoner.\nLorenzo is confident he can push Rossi to the wire in the remaining races of the championship and believes he can take a crucial step at Phillip Island.\n\"I am fortunate to have competed in an era with some of the most talented riders in the history of the sport and for sure some of the best of the last 30 years,\" he said this week.\n\"This year if I win will be a more special feeling for me and Yamaha, especially to beat Honda after Marquez has won the past two years.\"\n(Editing by Peter Rutherford )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T11:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:54:44.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
