The Steelheads opened the scoring with a beautiful goal from Alex Nylander, who looked to pass after going around the net but instead lifted a no-look backhand over 67's goalie Leo Lazarev, who finished with 22 saves. Sean Day also scored in the opening frame for the visiting Steelheads. \nThe wheels fell off for Ottawa in the third as they get up goals to Damian Bourne and Michael McLeod before Nylander put the game out of reach with his second of the night with four minutes to play. \nWith Ottawa still carrying four overage players, Sam Studnicka took his turn sitting out against Mississauga. It's a system that drives 67's head coach Jeff Brown crazy, especially when sitting one of his best forwards, but the other three include Evan de Haan, Nevin Guy and Nathan Todd, three other top players. At least one will have to be moved sooner than later. \nThe 67's return to action Friday night when they host Oshawa. \nKONECNY, SALITURO GET RUSSIAN SERIES NOD \nBefore Wednesday's game, it was announced that 67's captain Travis Konecny and forward Dante Salituro will represent the OHL in the 2015 CHL Canada Russia Series. The pair will play for the OHL side against the Russians on November 12 in Owen Sound. \nKonecny leads the league in assists with 14, while Salituro had six goals and 11 points this season.
