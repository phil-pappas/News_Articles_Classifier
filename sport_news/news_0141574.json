Iowa won 10-6. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Jeff Hanisch-USA TODAY Sports) \nIOWA 10, WISCONSIN 6 \nMADISON, Wis. — Jordan Canzeri ran for 125 yards and Iowa took advantage of four turnovers by Wisconsin quarterback Joel Stave to upset the 19th-ranked Badgers 10-6 on Saturday. \nTight end George Kittle caught a 1-yard touchdown pass from C.J. Beathard in the second quarter for the only touchdown in the game and Iowa (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten) beat a ranked opponent for the first time in its last 10 attempts. \nStave was intercepted twice by Iowa cornerback Desmond King and lost two fumbles, including midway through the fourth quarter on Iowa’s 1-yard line. The Wisconsin quarterback tripped and lost the ball while attempting to hand off to freshman Taiwan Deal. Iowa’s Faith Ekakitie recovered. \nWisconsin (3-2, 0-1) had its 10-game winning streak at Camp Randall Stadium snapped, and lost for only the eighth time in its last 79 home games dating to 2004. \nThe Badgers started their final drive on their 47 and drove to the Iowa 16, but Stave’s fourth-down pass to Troy Fumagalli fell incomplete with 36 seconds to go. \nWisconsin typically has a stronger running game than Iowa, but the Hawkeyes out-rushed the Badgers, who played without injured starter Corey Clement. \nCanzeri’s strong play made up for a mediocre performance by Beathard, who was 9 of 21 for 77 yards with one interception and one fumble lost. \nDeal had 15 attempts for 59 yards and starting halfback Dare Ogunbowale had 11 carries for only 28 yards as Wisconsin managed 86 rushing yards and was 4 of 13 on third-down conversions. The Badgers averaged 188 yards rushing in its first four games. \nDespite the turnovers, Wisconsin only trailed 10-6 midway through the fourth quarter when Wisconsin’s Joe Schobert stripped Beathard and recovered the fumble at the Iowa 27. The Badgers drove to the Iowa 1 and tried to run Deal, at 6-foot-1, 220 pounds, up the middle. \nBut Stave tripped and dropped the ball while falling. Deal tried to dive onto the ball, but Iowa recovered to end Wisconsin’s best chance to score in the fourth quarter. \nIowa played without its leading receiver, Tevaun Smith, and left tackle, Boone Myers, out with injuries. Wisconsin’s leading receiver, Alex Erickson, was injured in the third quarter and did not return. \nThe Hawkeyes scored all of their points in the second quarter after a pair of Stave turnovers. \nBefore allowing Iowa’s TD, the Badgers had played 115 minutes, 2 seconds without allowing a touchdown dating to the season-opening loss to Alabama. Wisconsin scored its only points on a pair of 46-yard field goals by Rafael Gaglianone in the first and third quarters \nKing has five interceptions this season. \nBOX SCORES : Breakdowns of all the Big Ten action \nNO. 16 NORTHWESTERN 27, MINNESOTA 0 \nEVANSTON, Ill. — Clayton Thorson scored two touchdowns, Justin Jackson ran for 120 yards and the Northwestern defense turned in another dominant performance as the No. 16 Wildcats shut out Minnesota 27-0 on Saturday. \nThorson, a freshman quarterback, scored on runs of 5 and 1 yards to spark the offense for Northwestern (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten). The Wildcats defense, which has allowed only three touchdowns in five games, did the rest. \nNorthwestern defensive tackle Tyler Lancaster forced a fumble by Minnesota quarterback Mitch Leidner that linebacker Anthony Walker returned 13 yards for a touchdown that gave the Wildcats a 27-0 lead early in the fourth quarter. \nMinnesota (3-2, 0-1) turned the ball over twice and finished with only 173 yards. The Golden Gophers also failed to convert on all three of its fourth down conversion attempts. \nNO. 22 MICHIGAN 28, MARYLAND 0 \nCOLLEGE PARK, Md. — Desmond Morgan had nine tackles and an interception, part of a dominating defensive performance by No. 22 Michigan in a 28-0 rout of Maryland on Saturday. \nIn winning its first Big Ten opener under Jim Harbaugh, Michigan (4-1, 1-0) picked off three passes and limited Maryland to 105 yards. It was the second straight shutout for the Wolverines, who have allowed a total of 14 points in their last four games. \nMorgan, a senior inside linebacker, picked off a pass in the first quarter and was a major reason why the Terrapins (2-3, 0-1) finished with 29 yards rushing after averaging 196 over their first four games. \nMichigan led by only 6-0 at halftime before pulling away with two third-quarter touchdowns. After Jake Rudock connected with Drake Johnson for a 31-yard score, wide receiver Jehu Chesson took an inside handoff and sprinted down the left sideline for a 66-yard TD. \nThat made it 21-0, a deficit way too formidable for Maryland to overcome. \nPENN STATE 20, ARMY 14 \nSTATE COLLEGE, Pa. — Christian Hackenberg passed for 156 yards and a touchdown and Penn State beat Army 20-14 at Beaver Stadium. \nNick Scott ran for a touchdown, Mike Gesicki caught one and Joey Julius kicked two field goals for the Nittany Lions (4-1). Army backup quarterback A.J. Schurr ran for 74 yards and two touchdowns for the Black Knights (1-4), but three fumbles kept Army’s triple-option offense grounded. \nScott’s scored on an 11-yard run in the first quarter and Julius kicked a 37-yard field goal to give Penn State a 10-0 lead at \nhalftime. Julius was good again from 27-yards to begin the third quarter before Schurr finished an 8-play drive with a 3-yard touchdown plunge. \nHackenberg found Gesicki down the sideline for a 33-yard score at the end of the third. Schurr scored on a 56-yard run up the middle before he was sacked on fourth-and-5 by Penn State linebacker Jason Cabinda that sealed the win for Penn State. \nILLINOIS 14, NEBRASKA 13 \nCHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) — Wes Lunt hit Geronimo Allison with a 1-yard touchdown pass with 10 seconds left in the game to lead Illinois past Nebraska on Saturday, 14-13. \nIllinois (4-1, 1-0 Big Ten) trailed by 10 at the half and never led until placekicker Taylor Zalewski, who missed two first-half field goals, converted the extra point. \nLunt finished the day 23-45 for 251 yards and two touchdowns, the first a 22-yarder to Marchie Murdock early in the final quarter. \nAllison caught eight passes for 91 yards and the winning touchdown. \nNebraska (2-3, 0-1 Big Ten) led 10-0 at the half. \nBackup Nebraska running back Devine Ozigbo led the Cornhuskers with 70 yards on seven carries and a touchdown. \nThe win was Illinois’ first against Nebraska since 1924. \nIllinois’ defense kept the Illini the game. \nNebraska managed just 292 total yards. Quarterback Tommy Armstrong Jr. finished the day 10-31 for 105 yards and an interception. \nAnd the Illinois defense stopped the Cornhuskers on a fourth-and-7 at the Illini 27 yard-line with 51 seconds to play, giving Lunt one last shot. \nThe junior led Illinois up the field and to the Nebraska 7. On three straight plays, Lunt went to Allison on the right side of the Nebraska end zone. Twice Allison caught the ball out of bounds. \nBut twice Nebraska defensive backs also interfered with Allison, moving the ball to the 1. \nThen Lunt finally found his target, hitting the senior receiver low and just inside the end zone. \nAllison, on his knees, raised his arms and looked to the sky. On the sideline, Lunt ran straight into a hug from interim coach Bill Cubit. \nThe celebration appeared to be as much relief as anything. \nFor much of the first half, the upper hand was there for Illinois to take. \nThe Cornhuskers stumbled to three three-and-outs to and a fumbled punt on their first four possessions. \nThe Illini could move the ball, but only until they neared the end zone. \nThree trips into the Nebraska red zone produced the two missed field goals, from 51 and 41 yards, and a failed fourth-down attempt at the Cornhusker 13. And the half’s final play ended with Ke’Shawn Vaughn’s 48-yard run to the Nebraska 12, putting a fourth empty trip inside the Husker 20 yard-line on the stat sheet. \nIn the meantime, Nebraska found a way to scratch out 10 first-half points. \nOzigbo rumbled 19 yards around the right side of Illinois’ defense with 12:35 left in the second quarter for a 7-0 lead. \nThen, late in the quarter, Armstrong hit Cethan Carter for a 55-yard pass down the right sideline that set up a 39-yard Drew Brown field goal. With 11 seconds to play, Nebraska was up 10-0. 17 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
