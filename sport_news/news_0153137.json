(AP) - Lieutenant Gov. Phil Scott's decision to run for governor has sparked interest from numerous candidates who are interested in the seat.\nThe only two who have formally announced a run are former state auditor Randy Brock, a Republican, and small business entrepreneur Brandon Riker of Marlboro, a Democrat.\nAmong the other Democrats considering a run are Sen. Dick McCormack; Sen. Phillip Baruth; Sen. David Zuckerman, a Progressive/Democrat; and Rep. Kesha Ram and Sen. Christopher Bray. Senate President Pro Tem John Campbell had been considering a run but said Friday that that's off the table for now.\nRepublicans include Mark Snelling; Sens. Joe Benning and Kevin Mullin; and 2014 gubernatorial candidate Scott Milne.\nProgressive Dean Corren, an unsuccessful candidate for lieutenant governor in 2014, is also considering another run.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
