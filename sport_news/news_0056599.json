In recent months, Toyota has recalled nearly 10 million vehicles outfitted with defective air bags that have been linked to several deaths globally. A driver’s side power window master switch could short circuit and cause parts to overheat and melt, Toyota said in an email. “A melting switch may produce smoking and, potentially, lead to a fire,” it added. The recalled models include the Yaris, Corolla, Camry and RAV4 SUV produced between 2005 and 2010, it said. About 2.7 million affected vehicles were sold in North America and 1.2 million in Europe, Toyota added. Honda to put self-drive car on road by 2020 Honda said on Wednesday it would put a commercialised self-driving car on the road by 2020, challenging rivals Toyota and Nissan which are also betting on the future of autonomous vehicles. The announcement, ahead of the Tokyo Motor Show next week, comes as Japan’s auto giants step on the accelerator in a bid to race past overseas competitors on the next-generation technology. Google has been testing self-driving cars in Silicon Valley, as have US-based Tesla and General Motors, while Nissan has vowed to put an automated car on Japan’s highways as soon as 2016. Earlier this month, Toyota unveiled a vehicle that can drive itself along a highway, with plans for a 2020 rollout. The car, a modified Lexus GS, uses sophisticated sensors to navigate roads, merge lanes and overtake other vehicles. In its current incarnation, the car only switches to fully automated mode once it reaches the less frenetic confines of a highway and passes a sensor. Last week, high-end electric vehicle maker Tesla said it was taking a major step toward self-driving cars by installing new autopilot software in vehicles so they can automatically change lanes, manage speed and even hit the brakes. The car can also scan for available parking spaces, alert drivers when one is spotted and then parallel park on command. GM India launches SUV Trailblazer at Rs26.40 lakh New Delhi: General Motors India on Wednesday launched premium SUV Chevrolet Trailblazer at Rs 26.40 lakh (ex-showroom Delhi), the first of 10 new models to be introduced here over five years as the US-based firm looks to revive its fortunes in the country. “This is a very important model for us as it kick-starts the first of the ten new products that we plan to bring to India in the next five years,” General Motors India president and MD Arvind Saxena said. It is powered by a 2.8-litre diesel engine and the company is looking to tap the fast-growing SUV market in India. — AFP/PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:19:33.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
