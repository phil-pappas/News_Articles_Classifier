Everyone was comfortable and confident we would win. Guys stepped up and made big plays.”\nUtah QB Travis Wilson\nSALT LAKE CITY — Utah’s operative word became a reality in Saturday’s 34-18 win over Arizona State. After losing close contests to the Sun Devils in 2013 and 2014, the Utes were determined to “finish” this time around.\nMission accomplished.\nUtah outscored ASU 20-0 over the final 15 minutes to snap an 11-game skid in the matchup with the Sun Devils. In doing so, the Utes became bowl eligible — improving to 6-0 overall and 3-0 in Pac-12 play. They now hold a two-game advantage or greater in the loss column against every team in the South Division.\n“We couldn’t ask for a better spot moving into week seven,” said Utah coach Kyle Whittingham. “We’ll celebrate for a day and then get working Monday on our next opponent.”\nThe Utes, who moved up to No. 3 in this week’s Associated Press poll and remained No. 7 in the coaches rankings, face USC (3-3, 1-2) Saturday in Los Angeles. They do so on the heels of a strong finish against the Sun Devils.\nBesides the shutout by the defense, Devontae Booker had touchdown runs of 25 and 62 yards in the fourth quarter. Kicker Andy Phillips made field goals from 43 and 35 yards.\n“We kept going. Everyone was comfortable and confident we would win,” said quarterback Travis Wilson. “Guys stepped up and made big plays. I’m really happy with how we finished.”\nWilson wound up completing 26 of 36 passes for 297 yards. He connected on touchdown tosses to Harrison Handley (2 yards) and Kenneth Scott (11 yards).\nBooker’s late surge put him at 118 yards rushing by game’s end.\nUtah’s defense, though, stole the show. Whittingham said they were collectively the players of the game on a night when the Utes weren’t so special on kick return coverage — surrendering a 100-yard score on a kickoff, as well as a 48-yard punt return and a safety off an illegal forward pass on a kick return.\n“That’s not like us,” Whittingham said. “We have to get that fixed.”\nAdjustments, however, won’t be needed on defense. Utah held ASU to just 15 yards rushing on 28 carries. The Utes recorded 11 tackles-for-loss, five sacks and two takeaways — a fumble recovery by Tevin Carter and an interception from Cory Butler-Byrd.\n“We knew that we had to come in and stop the run,” said linebacker Gionni Paul, who led the Utes with 11 tackles. “We did a great job with that.”\nThe outcome leaves Utah with some breathing room in the quest for a berth in the Pac-12 Championship Game entering the final six games of the season.\n“We knew going in what would happen if we won. That was something big as far as we were concerned,” Wilson said. “We wanted to get a comfortable lead in the standings. We wanted to take care of business against the Sun Devils and fortunately we did.”\nEXTRA POINTS: Utah improved to 16-2 when ranked in the Associated Press top 10 . . . Injury updates on tight end Siale Fakailoatonga and linebacker Jared Nor ris are expected Monday . . . Scott and Britain Covey led nine Utah receivers with five catches apiece.
