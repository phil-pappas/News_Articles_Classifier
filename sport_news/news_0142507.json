(AP) - A food truck at the University of Connecticut is serving up roasted crickets.\nThe Daily Campus reports ( http://bit.ly/1KQXRh2 ) the university's dining services are advertising the insects as organic, not genetically modified and earth friendly.\nThe crickets are high in protein and low in fat. They're a source of B vitamins, iron and zinc.\nUConn says the farm that supplies the crickets uses carbon dioxide to kill them and then roasts them.\nThe crickets are sold for 99 cents and come whole in small plastic containers. They're sold as a snack or a taco topping.\nDining services area assistant manager John Smith says they sell two or three containers of crickets per day at the truck.\n___\nInformation from: The Daily Campus, http://www.dailycampus.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
