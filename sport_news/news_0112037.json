The team will take part in a Blue-White scrimmage. Former North Carolina player Kenny Smith will be the host. Admission is free. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. Organizers said player introductions will take place at the start of the event, unlike some past years when other activities came first. The women’s basketball team also will make an appearance. Because of the preseason basketball event, the North Carolina men’s soccer game against Louisville has been moved up two hours to 5 p.m. Friday to avoid a conflict. It’s the final Atlantic Conference home game for the Tar Heels.
