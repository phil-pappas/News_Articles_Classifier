(AP Photo/Matt Slocum) Coach John Hynes also announced that Patrik Elias, Travis Zajac, Mike Cammalleri and Adam Henrique will rotate as the alternate captains.\nThe captain and the alternates were selected by the coaching staff and management in combination with a player vote. Hynes said Greene was the “clear-cut” choice as captain from both the coaches' and players' perspective.\nHynes said Greene, who will turn 33 on Oct. 30, is the right man for the job “for multiple reasons.”\n“Coming in as coaches and management we wanted an opportunity to meet with the players throughout the summer and get to know them and we had a feel coming into the year,” Hynes said. “Then, going into the preseason, seeing different games, practices, we had a lot of different situations. We had some wins and losses, a couple team trips, and we just felt as a group, management and coaches, that Andy was our guy and we also had a team vote and he was the guy.\n“So, we're looking forward to having him represent us and we feel as though (he's the right guy for) three areas: One, who he is as a person off the ice is something that we want to represent our team and organization. We feel his consistency of being and every-day pro over the course of his career has been impressive and something we would like some of our younger guys to model. And the third part is his play. He can play the way that we want to play and he's a leader on the ice. So, those components we feel are the dynamic that made up what we would want our captain to be, and Andy fits the bill.”\nA ways to go \nDevils co-owner John Harris said before Friday’s season opener the team is “fifth in the NHL in terms of new tickets sold” for 2015-16. Harris would not put a specific number on sales, though.\nAs far as season-ticket sales lost from last season, Devils CEO Scott O’Neil said, “We renewed at about 90 percent for the second year in a row and last year we were seventh in renewals.\n“So, you have a progression of things getting better. But, we have a ways to go to be selling this place out every night and that’s what we’re working toward.”\n“We’re sort of building off a low base and the reality is, two years ago when we got here, the roof was leaking and the banks were on the doorstep of the company,” Harris said. “We started very low. I think there’s a lot of potential to move up, but we’re making significant strides off a relatively low base.”\nO’Neill waits \nAs expected, defenseman Eric Gelinas and forwards Stefan Matteau and Brian O’Neill were the Devils’ healthy scratches. O’Neill, 27, has had only one full practice with the team after being acquired in Tuesday’s trade with the Kings.\nIt’s likely he sits out tonight’s game in Washington as well, though Devils coach John Hynes said he was “not ruled out, yet,” for tonight’s lineup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:49:19.065+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
