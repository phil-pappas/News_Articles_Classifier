Back | Next THE CANADIAN PRESS Kansas City Royals third baseman Mike Moustakas celebrates after hitting an RBI single against the Toronto Blue Jays during the eighth inning in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series on Saturday in Kansas City, Mo. The Royals won 6-3 to take a 2-0 series lead. By Jeff Deters jeff.deters@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The 2015 Kansas City Royals have flipped the script on the 1985 team, but they hope the end results are still the same. \nThirty years ago, the Royals and Toronto Blue Jays played in the American League Championship Series, and the Royals lost the first two games before rallying to win the series in seven. The Royals then went on to capture their first World Series title. Now the Royals are seemingly in much better position to make the Fall Classic, entering Monday’s Game 3 with a 2-0 lead. \nRoyals right-hander Johnny Cueto (1-0, 3.86 ERA) will square off against Toronto right-hander Marcus Stroman (0-0, 3.46 ERA) at 7:07 p.m. at Rogers Centre. Cueto is coming off his best start as a Royal, throwing eight solid innings against Houston in Game 5 of the AL Division Series. \n“Game No. 5 was a decisive game,” Cueto said. “You win, you keep going. You lose, you go home. And my mentality was I’m going to give everything I’ve got as long as I can. And this game is very similar. My approach is going to be the same and I’ll give it all I’ve got as long as I can.” \nCueto, who struck out eight and didn’t walk a batter in that elimination game, will be making his third start of the postseason for the Royals. He also started Game 2 of the ALDS, throwing six innings and giving up four runs. Cueto, who was brought in to be Kansas City’s ace in the postseason, struggled after the trade from the Reds. At one point, he lost five straight starts before he started to turn things around, culminating in his performance in Game 5. \n“Thank God the staff gave me the opportunity to pitch that game,” said Cueto, who has fanned 13 and walked just three in the playoffs. “As far as the confidence, I’ve never lost confidence. That was a game I was scheduled to pitch and that was a game we needed to win as an organization and as a team. Thank God it worked out.” \nCueto made his debut as a Royal in Toronto, giving up three runs in six innings. He settled for a no-decision as the Blue Jays rallied to win in extra innings. The Royals rallied in Game 2 against Toronto ace David Price, scoring five runs in the seventh on the way to a 6-3 win. \nThe Blue Jays, though, remain confident despite the 0-2 deficit. They rallied from an 0-2 hole in the ALDS against the Texas Rangers. \n“I guess you could say we have somewhat of a little bit of experience being down 0-2,” Blue Jays right fielder Jose Bautista said. “It’s not the most comfortable place to be, but we’re still confident and we’re a great team.” \nSo far in the series, the Blue Jays have scored just three runs and are hitting a cool .197 with a .284 on-base percentage. A big part of that has been the due to the strength of the Royals bullpen, which hasn’t yielded a run in 62/3 innings. \n“We’ve got a lot of confidence in those guys down there,” Royals first baseman Eric Hosmer said. “It’s a little bit nerve-racking knowing what kind of a lineup they’ve got over there, but they get the job done.” \nTo do so, the bullpen utilizes a bulldog-type approach against hitters and they also bring plenty of heat to go with it. Cueto used that same approach in Game 5. \n“I’m going to toe the rubber and give everything I’ve got,” Cueto said. “And I’m going to take the same approach as I did the previous game and just be ready to go, ready to pitch.” \nThe Royals won just one of four games at Toronto during the regular season, but that doesn’t really matter in October. And if Cueto delivers again, his previous struggles may be soon forgotten, and a reward in the form of his first trip to the Fall Classic would be within reach. \n“We’re feeling good,” Hosmer said. “This is the best we can feel heading into Toronto up 2-0 with Johnny Cueto on the mound. We know it’s going to be an exciting three games over there or whatever it is, and we got to take care of business.” \nYOUNG TO START GAME 4 — Royals manager Ned Yost on Sunday gave a first name to his starting pitcher for Game 4. Chris Young will get the nod over Kris Medlen. \n“He’s got really good numbers against these guys,” Yost said. “They’re both great choices, but, you know, Chris Young, his last two starts of the year were really, really good for us. We feel like he gives us a good chance to win.” \nJeff Deters can be reached at jeff.deters@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:51:22.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
