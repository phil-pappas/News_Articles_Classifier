But their biggest test? Hardly.“Every week is a big test,” Smith said. “Subiaco was a test because we were missing three starters. In this conference, you have to pass this test every Friday. It’s not a pushover conference. Every Friday you bring your A-game, or you get left behind.”The Senators (4-0, 1-0 4A-4 Conference) have outscored their opponents 207-93, including a 43-22 win over the Class 7A Rogers Heritage War Eagles.“They are a senior laden team,” Smith said. “They are ranked, I think, third in the 4A right now. They are kind of set. They have a good system, and their system matches their athletes.”Pulaski Robinson running back and wide receiver T.J. Hammonds committed to the University of Arkansas on April 11.“They’re loaded,” Smith said. “But preparing for them is going to be the same as every game plan we execute. We make the decisions based on the kids we have on our campus. The opponent that we play doesn’t alter what we do. It’s going to be the same as any other week.”The Pirates (4-0, 1-0) are not to be taken lightly. Dover has held opposing offenses to just 27 points so far this year, while averaging around 50 points per game. Defeating the Senators would be a statement heard across the state, Smith said.“If we knock off that No. 3 team, I think you deserve to jump into that top 10,” he said. “But honestly, I think the kids are just looking at this as another challenge. I don’t think they get caught up in rankings. They just want to be in the playoffs at the end of the year. They understand the level we will have to play at to get there. Each week it gets more intense.”Smith said the Pirates’ strength comes from an offseason of progress in the weight room. Dover won the Class 4A State Weight Meet, and Smith said it is key to controlling the line of scrimmage.“Strength training is the foundation of our conditioning,” he said. “The kids are dedicated to the weight room. If you want to do a good job tackling or blocking, you have to have the fundamental strength to do it.”Kickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. today at Charlie George Stadium.
