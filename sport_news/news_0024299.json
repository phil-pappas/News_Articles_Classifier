Today was about placing and winning.” \nIt certainly wound up that way for Voorhees on a gorgeous, perfect day for the sport at the Phillipsburg Athletic Complex. \nThe Vikings put all seven of their runners in the top 20 spots and used their depth to hold off Hunterdon Central 36-53 to win their third straight H/W/S title. Score it as a dual meet – the Vikings against the other 19 teams – and the field scraped by to a 28-32 triumph, which shows Voorhees’ depth off nicely. \nSophomore Chris Romero led the way for the Vikings as he came in third overall in 16 minutes, 5 seconds. He trailed only champion Joe Dragon, a High Point senior,, whose blazing time of 15:44 broke the course record of 15:59 set at the 2014 H/W/S meet by Wallkill Valley’s Craig Conti, and Hunterdon Central sophomore Justin Cornetta in 16:03. \n“We wanted to stay with Cornetta,” Romero said. “But we knew this was a slow course. We knew Dragon would be out where he was.” \nWhitney followed in 16:21, followed by senior Matt Vira (sixth, 16:44), junior Evan Minor (ninth, 16:50); sophomore Joey Capone (14th, 17:07); senior Brendan McGill (16th, 17:10); and junior Jacob Dispenza (18th, 17:13). \n“I was happy with my time,” Vira said. “We were only here to win, though. That was the important thing.” \nVoorhees coach Jeff Capone liked what he saw with athletes filling in where there may have otherwise been gaps. \n“You know it may not be everybody’s best day, sometimes some guys are a little off, which is natural,” Capone said. “But when that happens we have somebody to step in. Today wasn’t Rob’s best day but Chris stepped in. Brendan wasn’t feeling that well but Joey stepped in and Matt Vira stepped up huge. And Jacob just got his spot in the last two races. We have a constant battle between 1 through 12 for varsity spots.” \nThe battle will intensify now that the cross country season has hit its stride. From Thursday until the Meet of Champions Nov. 21 at Holmdel Park, the races matter in a way that the earlier dual meets and invitationals do not. \n“All the hard work we’ve put in, all summer and throughout the season, comes down to these five weeks,” Vira said. “These are all big races.” \nAs impressive as Voorhees was Thursday – their 1-through-5 spread was a solid 62 seconds, and they handled the demanding PAC course that one participant called “harder than Holmdel (Park)” with complete competence and even some flair – they know they can get better. \n“I am glad we won and my time was OK for a slow course but I had a guy (Cornetta) kick by me at the end,” Romero said. “That’s a matter of toughness, and I have to get better at it.” \nThe Vikings will enter next week’s Skyland Conference championships, run at a very different course at Natirar Park in Peapack/Gladstone, as the favorite and defending champions. \n“That is the last fast course we run,” Whitney said. “We all want to set individual personal-bests in that race.” \nAnd the Vikings would take some winning on the side, too. \nBrad Wilson may be reached at bwilson@lehighvalleylive.com .
