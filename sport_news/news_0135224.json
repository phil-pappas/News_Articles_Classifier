Kankakee’s depth was key in recording points in the first two places 14 times in 14 events. This included going 1-2 twice. On the other hand, the Indians won five events and placed second four times. Kankakee tallied 143 points, Pontiac had 121 and PBL finished with 27. Haley Rice was part of three wins and a runnerup finish for the Indians. Rice won the 200-meter individual medley in 2 minutes, 43.48 seconds and the butterfly in 1:15.27. Rice teamed with Alli Trainor, Katie Stock and Andrea Mehrkens to claim the 200 freestyle relay in 2:05.07. Trainor and Mehrkens were also multiple winners. Trainor captured the 50 free in 31.36 seconds. Mehrkens took the 100 free in 1:08.49. Samantha Mehrkens joined Andrea Mehrkens, Trainor and Rice in placing second in the 400 freestyle relay with a mark of 4:49.56. Keely Pickett was runnerup in the individual 400 free with a time of 5:50.17. Megan Lauritsen had a time of 1:33.75 for second in the breaststroke. Mackenzi Mies was second in diving with 108.65 points. Scoring third-place points for the Indians were Andrea Mehrkens in the 200 freestyle (2:39.95), Samantha Mehrkens in the backstroke (1:30.68), Lauritsen in the 200 IM (3:14.55), Maddie Doran in the 400 free (7:01.61) and the 200 freestyle relay quartet of Mies, Kathryn Berta, Gretchen Hilt and Pickett (2:37.29).
