As per the notification issued by the Registrar General on Saturday, the full bench comprising three high court judges, Justice Muzaffar Hussain Attar, Justice Ali Muhammad Magrey and Justice Tashi Rabstan, has been constituted to hear two “conflicting” orders of the high court on September 16. While keeping the September 9 high court order for enforcement of the beef ban in abeyance for two months, the Supreme Court had on October 5 asked the Chief Justice of J&K High Court to constitute a three-judge Bench to resolve the beef ban issue. In its orders, the J&K HC’s Bench at Jammu had on September 9 asked the state police chief on to “strictly enforce” the existing laws (sections 298 A to D of the J&K Ranbir Penal Code) regulating ban on bovine slaughter and beef sale in the state. However, on September 16, while admitting a writ petition challenging the constitutional validity of the penal sections regulating ban on bovine slaughter and beef sale, a Division Bench of the high court had issued notices to the J&K government headed by Mufti Sayeed and asked it to file its response within one week. The Bench, in its orders, had made it clear that the state government or the Assembly was free to scrap the controversial provisions under challenge , irrespective of the pendency of the petition before the court. However, without taking any public stand over the beef ban controversy before the high court, the PDP-BJP coalition government approached the Supreme Court against what it termed two “conflicting” orders of the J&K High Court.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:02:14.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
