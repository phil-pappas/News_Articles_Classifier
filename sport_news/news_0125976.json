He noted 96 percent of them had tickets for the minor offenses of speeding or disregarding stop signs or traffic lights.\nBut Delahanty forced O’Connell to address a litany of questions about the ethics, finances and legality of the program, which O’Connell insisted already had been addressed.\nNoting that prospective participants are promised their cases will be dismissed if they complete the program, Delahanty said, “You are holding yourself out as if there is no need for a judge in the process.”\n“That is false and you know it’s false,” O’Connell shot back.\nHe said some motorists have lost job opportunities because their cases have been pending so long, while others don’t know their charges haven’t been dismissed.\nDelahanty said he would view the Drive Safe Louisville video before deciding whether to dismiss the pending cases, which he said have come from several courts where judges also have concerns about the program.\nHe said none of the defendants “should lose any sleep” over their pending citations. “I am not going to punish them,” he said.\nReporter Andrew Wolfson can be reached at (502) 582-7189 or at awolfson@courier-journal.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:49:17.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
