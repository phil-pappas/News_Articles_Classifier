Moravian Academy dropped its first game of the season with a 3-2 loss to a very good Whitehall team on the Zephyrs' turf field. Moravian led 2-0 at halftime before the Zephyrs ran off three unanswered goals in the final 30 minutes. \nWarren Hills and Voorhees played an exciting Hunterdon/Warren/Sussex semifinal game on Saturday morning. Warren Hills prevailed 2-1, eventually winning on penalty strokes after two scoreless overtime periods. The Blue Streaks play Hunterdon Central for the H/W/S title on Saturday at Hackettstown . \nSouthern Lehigh played Moravian Academy for the Colonial League title on Wednesday night. Emmaus and Stroudsburg meet for the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference championship at 6:30 tonight at Whitehall. \nCheck out the full rankings by scrolling through the gallery atop this post.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:09:34.983+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
