But days after that emotional reunion, she was kicked out of her halfway house for allegedly smoking marijuana.\nShe denies violating house rules and is now in another house for recovering addicts.\nMoriarty says she's still committed to getting herself clean, making amends with the people she hurt and reconnecting with the young son she lost custody of because of her addiction.\nMoriarty is among more than 200 addicts taking advantage of a unique program offered by police in Gloucester, Massachusetts, in which heroin addicts are fast-tracked into treatment rather than arrested.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
