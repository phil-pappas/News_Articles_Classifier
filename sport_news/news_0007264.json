Eli Manning has done some incredible things throughout his career, and this one ranks right up there with the best of them. Manning threw the game-winning touchdown pass with 21 seconds remaining to tight end Larry Donnell in a 30-27 victory over the San Francisco 49ers.\n\"He's our guy,\" coach Tom Coughlin said. \"He knows it.\"\nManning had a monster effort working with a decimated receiving corps. He put the team on his shoulders.\nJust how big an effort was it? Here's a look at what Manning accomplished during the contest:\n• 27th game-winning drive (regular season) ‐ It was Manning's first game-winning drive since Dec. 22, 2013.\nRELATED : What this win says about the Giants\n• 41 completions ‐ Easily a career high. His previous best was 34 against the Tennessee Titans in 2010. They were also a new Giants record. Phil Simms completed 40 passes against the Bengals in 1985.\n• 54 attempts ‐ Also a new career high. He had thrown 53 passes in a game three times, including the season finale last year against the Eagles.\n• 441 yards passing ‐ The third-best total of his career. He threw for 510 against the Bucs in 2012 and 450 yards against the Cowboys in 2013.\n• 110.2 QB Rating ‐ It was the second time this season Manning had a QB rating over 110.\n• 15 consecutive passes completed ‐ He didn't throw an incompletion for the final 13:08 of the third quarter and the first 9:06 of the fourth quarter.\n• 41,172 passing yards (career) ‐ After throwing for 441 yards he passes Kerry Collin (40,922) for 12th all-time. Next up: Dan Fouts (43,040).\n• 172nd consecutive start ‐ It's easily the longest active streak in the NFL.\n• 102nd career victory (regular season and playoffs) ‐ He passed Simms, who had 101 victories as the Giants starting quarterback.\nJordan Raanan may be reached at jraanan@njadvancemedia.com .
