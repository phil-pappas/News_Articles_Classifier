If he were to hit the free agent market, he longtime Royal could make more than $100 million - a number the Royals aren't expected to match.\n\"We've come too far as a team, and we realize we're one loss away from our season being over. But, we can't think like that. We gotta go out here tomorrow and just play the game and do what we can\" first baseman Eric Hosmer said.\nOn Sunday, Astros pitcher Dallas Keuchel's 124th and final pitch was a fastball that struck out Lorenzo Cain to end the 7th inning.\n \"We gotta stay confident. We'll see what happens tomorrow. We're gonna come ready to go and give it our all and see what happens,\" Cain said.\nKeuchel's first 123 pitches were pretty good too. In the end, Keuchel was better than the Royals pitchers, and the Astros beat the Royals for a 2-1 lead in the American League Divisional Series.\n\"You know, if there's a group that can come back, has their back against the wall, and a group that can back out of it, it's this group. We gotta have the same mentality as we did when we dropped the first one back home. We need to try and even this one out and get back to The K and see what happens after that,\" Hosmer said.\nPitcher Danny Duffy said none of his teammates are ready to go home.\n\"So we'll go back out there and play to our strengths, pitch to our strengths and go get it because nobody is gonna give it to us,\" he said.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
