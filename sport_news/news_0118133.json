Courtesy photo. A luncheon hosted by the Sonora chapter of the Omega Nu sorority on Oct. 24 at Black Oak Casino Hotel will raise money to provide Christmas gifts for disadvantaged children. Tickets for Omega Nu Alpha Iota’s third annual fall event are $40 each and include entry into a drawing for a one-night stay at Black Oak Casino Hotel and dinner for two at Seven Sisters restaurant. Doors will open at 10 a.m., and lunch will be served at noon. “We raise money in our community for women and children in need,” said Omega Nu chapter president Karen Spitze. “All of the proceeds from the fall event go to our Christmas charity for children within the county.” A table-setting contest will be held at the event in which 15 contestants will vie for first, second and third place, as well as a People’s choice award based off votes from those in attendance. Spitze said the contest has evolved over the years with different themes. Contestants this year will come up with their own theme for their table setting. “They decorate tables with dishes, floral arrangements, tablecloths, silverware, plates …“ she said. “They get really elaborate.” Omega Nu has 12 chapters in Northern California. The Sonora chapter was established in 1938 by Maryann Gray and Bess Ferguson. One of the first fundraisers the group put together was a children’s fashion show at Sonora High School in 1940, Spitze said. They also started a fund that same year to provide disadvantaged children with graham crackers and milk at recess, she added. The group has since raised thousands of dollars for charitable causes through a variety of fundraisers each year, including rummage and wreath sales. Now 34 members strong in Tuolumne County, the Alpha Iota chapter provides a total $8,000 a year for scholarships distributed among all high schools and Columbia College. The group’s Christmas charity provides dozens of children with $100 worth of gifts each year, including warm jackets, shoes and clothing. “We go to the different schools in the county and request some names of children who don’t have the benefit of a normal family or whose family is in a hard-luck situation,” Spitze said. The gifts are wrapped, labeled and delivered to the children’s schools at Christmas time. “They’re very grateful,” Spitze said of the families helped. “Some might be homeless or living in a shelter. It’s really rewarding for us to be able to contribute and make their Christmas almost normal.” A committee headed by chairwoman Jeanne Shephard and co-chairwoman Elizabeth Kopf organized this year’s fall event. In addition to the lunch and table-setting contest, there will be a raffle, silent auction and vendors offering holiday gift items. Seating is limited to 190, and Spitze said the event has sold out each year. Tickets can be purchased at Joan’s Boutique, 52 S. Washington St., Sonora, as well as directly from any Omega Nu members.
