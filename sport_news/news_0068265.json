(AP) The UConn women's basketball team will be trying out some new rules when the Huskies play an exhibition game next month. \nThe Huskies game against Vanguard University on Nov. 8 will feature the larger basketball used in men's games as well as a 24-second shot clock. \nThe 3-point line also will be moved back from the current 20 feet, 9 inches to the international distance of 22 feet, 1 inch. \nAnd the teams will play with a 16-foot lane, which is 4 feet wider than the one used in NCAA play. \nTeams won't be able to call timeout after a made basket, and will have just 8 seconds to get the ball into the frontcourt after inbounding the ball. \nUConn coach Geno Auriemma has advocated for the larger ball and other rule changes, which he has said are needed to create an international standard and enhance the flow of the game. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T17:39:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:12:03.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
