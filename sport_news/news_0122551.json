(Rick Bowmer / Associated Press) Associated Press \nTravis Wilson threw for 297 yards and two touchdown and No. 4 Utah held off Arizona State, 34-18, on Saturday night to remain the lone undefeated team in the Pac-12. \nSpecial teams nearly buried the Utes. \nTim White had a 100-yard kickoff return for a touchdown to put Arizona State on the board in the first quarter. De'Chavon Hayes' 48-yard punt return set up a field goal that gave the Sun Devils a 10-7 lead. \nUtah (6-0, 3-0) gave up a safety on a failed trick kickoff return and Arizona State (4-3, 2-2) added three more points on the ensuing possession to take an 18-14 lead. \nDevontae Booker's 25-yard touchdown run in the fourth quarter gave Utah a 21-18 lead it never relinquished. He finished with 118 yards rushing and two touchdowns. \nArizona State's Mike Bercovici threw for 242 yards and one interception. \nat Washington State 52, Oregon State 31: Luke Falk tied a team record with six touchdown passes, all in the first half, and the Cougars coasted to their first Pac-12 home-field victory in two years. \nWashington State (4-2, 2-1), coming off an upset victory at Oregon, hadn't beaten a conference opponent in Pullman, Wash., since November 2013. \nThe Cougars have already eclipsed the three wins they had all of last season, and this was the 100th win of Coach Mike Leach's career. Washington State scored on all seven of its first-half possessions and piled up 520 yards of offense. \nQuarterback Seth Collins threw for 176 yards and ran for 124 yards for Oregon State (2-4, 0-3), which gave up more than 40 points for the third consecutive week. \nArizona 38, at Colorado 31: Jared Baker ran for a career-high 207 yards and scored three touchdowns, powering the Wildcats (5-2, 2-2) past the Buffaloes. \nBaker scored untouched on runs of 79 and 45 yards and then was uncovered when he hauled in a 25-yard pass from Anu Solomon to break a 24-24 tie in the fourth quarter. \nThat play capped a 94-yard drive and followed a 97-yard drive sparked by backup quarterback Jerrard Randall, who came in and reeled off three long runs before handing off to Baker, who tied the score at 24-24 with his 45-yard run up the middle. \nAfter Randall was shaken up on a keeper, Solomon, who was ineffective over the second and third quarters, reentered the game and found Baker wide open with 9:17 remaining for his third touchdown. \nRandall ran 11 times for 81 yards and scored from a yard out with 4:40 left to make it 38-24, which proved to be the difference when Colorado's Sefo Liufau found Shay Fields over the middle for a 30-yard touchdown with 2:19 remaining. \nOregon 26, at Washington 20: Vernon Adams Jr. passed for 272 yards and two touchdowns, Royce Freeman ran for 138 yards, and the Ducks bounced back from a loss to Washington State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:02:00.155+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
