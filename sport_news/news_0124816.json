The Penguins dont appear to have a set-in-stone No. 1 power-play unit. Evgeni Malkin may hold auditions Monday for someone to play on his left wing. And the team that acquired the best offensive player on the market this summer has scored one goal in two games. At least the weather was nice in Texas and Arizona during a frustrating, season-opening road trip that culminated with a 2-1 loss to the Coyotes on Saturday at Gila River Arena. Phil Kessel may have scored his first goal as a Penguin, but there wasnt much else to talk about on the flight home. Or was there? “Its not working,” Malkin said. “We've played two games and have scored just one goal. We need a little bit of change. Just try. Sometimes it's better.” Coach Mike Johnston did change in the second period, although the result didn't change. On Michael Stones high-sticking minor, Johnston abandoned the idea of keeping Crosby and Malkin separate with the man-advantage. They hopped over the boards first with Patric Hornqvist, Kessel and Kris Letang. “It gives you more confidence,” Malkin said of starting a power play and being on the perceived No. 1 unit. “Sid and Phil are good partners. I like to play with both.” Still, the Penguins failed to score on four opportunities and are 0 for 7 through two games. “It was trying to get a different look on there 't think we generated as much off the first power play that we had when they were split. Again, right now it's a matter of loose-puck battles and work ethic.” 's wing may have triggered some discussion for that aforementioned flight. 's deferring too much to Kessel. If anything, Crosby said, he's not working hard enough to get an opportunity to shoot. 's always easy to say that after the pass gets blocked or what have you. 't had a ton of opportunities to shoot it. I think that you really have to work hard to get in those positions. I have to do a better job of getting there and getting pucks to the net.” k recorded his first NHL goal when he backhanded a loose puck past Fleury at 7:29. As a result, the Penguins are 0-2 for the first time since 2010-11. “Maybe we need more time,” Malkin said. “It's two games. We'll come back home with a little bit more practice. Maybe change lines. We need to work harder right now.” Jason Mackey is a staff writer for Trib Total Media.
