Sometimes travel gets in the way. But I won't leave you waiting any longer following Oregon State's 52-31 loss at Washington State to fall to 2-4 and 0-3 in Pac-12 play.\nIn case you missed it...\nGame story on how, yes, it could get worse for OSU's defense in the first half in Pullman.\nKen Goe column on how Saturday was a total \"system failure.\"\nDanny's sidebar on the Beavers taking pride in their finish, but again getting bitten by a slow start .\nTen observations (and a bonus)\n1. As noted in my story about the defense, the Beavers continue to constantly sub in waves. But it was most fascinating to watch the secondary.\nAs expected, Dwayne Williams started at cornerback while Devin Chappell moved to safety and Cyril Noland-Lewis to nickelback. Then, Noland-Lewis and Williams both got pulled after the first drive and replaced with Adam Soesman and Treston Decoud, respectively. But then when Decoud got burned on a couple pass plays, Williams was put back in. By the second half—thanks largely to the injuries to Larry Scott and Soesman—Noland-Lewis, Williams and Decoud were often on the field together.\nBrandon Arnold also continues to get good playing time and recorded his first-career interception in the fourth quarter.\n2. The Cougars rolled up 520 yards, but their longest play was a 28-yard pass from Luke Falk to Dom Williams. That's how a team ends an afternoon with 32 first downs, including 23 in the first half. Huge plays weren't the problem for the Beavers like against Stanford and Arizona. Chunk plays sure were.\n3. I thought OSU's best drive was not the one that ended with Collins' 12-yard touchdown run, but the one that ended with Garrett Owens' 50-yard field goal (a career long for him).\nThe Beavers established a great rhythm — 15 plays, 51 yards — and got a lot of guys involved besides usual suspects Jodan Villamin, Victor Bolden and Storm Barrs-Woods. Rahmel Dockery secured a key 11-yard catch over the middle on third-and-8. Paul Lucas got a carry. Datrin Guyton made a 7-yard grab. But penalties can kill drives, and that offensive facemask on Fred Lauina was big.\n4. Speaking of penalties, the Beavers finished with 11 for 86 yards\n5. A moment that epitomizes Collins' struggles to consistently throw the ball accurately? On the Beavers' first drive, he completely air-mailed one over Storm Barrs-Woods' head and into the sideline on third down. The official had to clarify to the crowd that it wasn't intentional grounding because a receiver was indeed in the area. It was just a really poor throw.\n6. Speaking of Collins, multiple people have asked A) if he's still the best option as the starter and B) why he's running so much over Barrs-Woods, who's averaging 5.4 yards per carry and is about to move into the top 5 on the program's career rushing list.\nRight now, I would be shocked if coaches even considered making a quarterback change. Collins is a true freshman who came in as a super athlete and raw thrower and...that's exactly what we're seeing. Baldwin certainly wishes Collins could throw the ball better, but he and quarterbacks coach Kevin McGiven are not overly alarmed by his progression rate so far in the offense.\nAs far as how much Collins is running, Andersen said it's \"risky business\" and that the Beavers are almost an option team right now. And we're seeing it with the way Collins has been dinged up in each of the past two games. Quarterbacks coach Kevin McGiven noted to me last week how there are practically no straight handoffs to the running back in this zone-read offense, which can make things tough on a young quarterback because they have to make some kind of decision on nearly every play. But Saturday, there sure seemed to be a bunch of designed quarterback keepers.\n7. Defensive lineman Sumner Houston, tight end Brent VanderVeen and Williams all made their first-career start Saturday. Defensive end Titus Failagua and linebacker Jonathan Willis made their first career sacks, while Willis forced his first-career fumble.\n8. Another defensive note: There were a couple interesting packages where Failauga lined up in a two-point stance (without his hand on the ground) inside. Don't remember seeing that before Saturday.\n9. Those who have been clamoring for running back Damien Haskins to see some carries got their wish, as he totaled two carries for 25 yards when the score was out of hand in the second half. It will be interesting to see if he gets opportunities moving forward.\n10. I was on the field for the last five minutes or so, most notably for the pick-six, blocked punt and final OSU touchdown. After that score, Andersen immediately screamed \"Two! Go!\" I also witnessed a pretty emotional moment when Barrs-Woods went over to close friend Scott, who was on crutches, and put his arm around him for several minutes.\n11. This was my first time in Pullman. I'm sure it's always in the 70s and sunny in October, right? (That's my poor attempt at humor). But I enjoyed driving through campus to get to Martin Stadium thought the environment was solid, especially once the late-arriving crowd, well, arrived.\nThree plays you might have forgotten\n1. How about the opening kickoff? Tavares Martin, Jr. fielded the ball and darted 51 yards and into OSU territory, which immediately put the defense on its heels. If we use the entire first half as a guide, the Cougars would have scored anyway on that drive. But, still, not a good start. Again, special teams were quite strange in this game, with that play and the fake punt disaster, but then Bolden's kickoff return and Chris Brown's blocked punt.\n2. Decoud got beat by Williams on a three-yard touchdown pass in the corner of the end zone. But on the second play of that drive, Falk lofted a 26-yarder that Williams corralled over Decoud. After that score, Williams went back in at corner until Decoud came back following Scott's injury. Now, both Williams and Decoud will play for as long as Scott is out.\n3. Just before the last play of the first quarter, Wazzu had committed a false start to put itself in a third-and-15 hole. But an offsides penalty by Lavonte Barnett immediately gave the Cougars those yards back, before Martin took a Falk pass and cut all the way across the field to eventually gain 18 yards. That drive ended with Gabe Marks' 23-yard touchdown catch to make the score 21-3 and pretty much squashed any momentum OSU had created off its field-goal drive.\nQuotable\n\"I was just telling guys just we gotta focus on us and try to make the game fun. Once we start making it fun and just do what we do, we start moving the ball. We play next week. And then we're gonna play the week after that...from here on out, we just gotta have fun with the game. We just gotta execute. We gotta be coachable.\" -- Collins on what was said in the locker room at halftime\nTweets of the game\n@ginamizell In other words, defense continues to be a problem for our defense.\n— Andy Diacetis (@andydiacetis) October 17, 2015\nWas about to type something nice about Washington State, so that Victor Bolden 100 yard kick return is on me, Cougs.
