Even as strong-legged placekickers sail balls out of the end zone for touchbacks and punters increase their hang time, versatile special teams players remain as fixtures because coaches value the often overlooked third phase of the game. \n\"Coach always says you're a football player before your position,\" said Steelers veteran Ross Ventrone, who has made a living off and on in the NFL the past five seasons as a special-teamer. \"Special teams sometimes are lost on the viewers at home on TV. You don't realize how much hidden yardage there is, how important field position is. How covering a kick and making a play inside the 20 is valuable to the defense, or making a huge block on a punt return and springing a returner to set up the offense. There is so much hidden yardage. \n\"If you can do that well, you definitely add value and you can secure a spot for yourself just in that phase.\" \nVentrone is one of six Steelers, not counting the kicker or punter, whose presence on the roster is because of special teams. Robert Golden, Terence Garvin, Dri Archer, Greg Warren and rookie Roosevelt Nix are the others. \nAll of them except Archer have something in common. They are former undrafted free agents who came out of nowhere to make the team and battle every year - and, in some cases, every week - to retain their roster spots. \nVentrone has been cut so many times he has lost track, but he has been a valuable member of the special teams units since he was added from the practice squad to the active roster in the middle of last season. \nGolden has been so valuable in his role as a special teams ace that the Steelers picked up his restricted free-agent tender and are paying him $1.54 million for this season to cover kicks. He almost never plays on defense, but his teammates thought so much of him that they named him a captain before the season. \nStill, because of his roots as an undrafted free agent, he never feels comfortable with his roster spot. \n\"Being a free agent, you always have to have the battle-type spirit within you and know you have to fight for your spot,\" Golden said. \"Every day, you have to have a chip on your shoulder. You just never know.\" \nThis week is one of those \"you never know\" weeks. The Steelers have a roster exemption until 4 p.m. Monday. At that time, or before, they must add Martavis Bryant to the 53-man roster and release another player. \nNix, who is in his first NFL season, is trying to follow in the footsteps of Golden and Ventrone and make a living by excelling on special teams. He is at risk this weekend along with a handful of others. \nNix is listed as a fullback and has played some in the goal-line offense, but made the team because he demonstrated his abilities as a special-teamer in preseason. His blocked punt in the preseason finale against Carolina earned him a roster spot. You might call it a $435,000 block. That's the minimum NFL salary for a first-year player. \nFor players such as Nix, though, it's prudent to calculate his earnings from week to week. Rookie free-agent contracts are not guaranteed, and he must continue to show the coaches he is worthy of a roster spot. \n\"I take special teams serious,\" Nix said. \"Coach (Mike Tomlin) always tells me that's how I'm going to play. You always hear how special teams are important and you have to do special things to be in the league, and that's true. Some guys are here because of special teams. For some vets, that's how they feed their families. It's a very important thing whether you're a rookie or a five-year player or a 10-year player.\" \nWhen it was time for the Steelers to make a cut after two games to make room on the 53-man roster for Le'Veon Bell, they released receiver Tyler Murphy and kept Nix because of his potential on special teams and as a fullback. He has to survive another cut this weekend to keep earning his NFL paycheck. \n\"I like him a lot,\" special teams coach Danny Smith said of Nix. \"There are some technique issues. He is a young player without experience, and we just need to perfect some things before we put him out there. But he works his butt off. I love the guy. I expect a lot from him. He has a lot of skills. It's just refining things the way we do it, which he hasn't been used to. He just needs experience. He will be one of those guys.\" \nIn today's NFL, it is considered a luxury to keep two fullbacks on the roster. Some don't keep any. But Nix has made such an impression on his coaches and teammates that he has been hard to cut. \n\"Rosie has proven to be a guy who is going to make plays whether it's on special teams or at fullback, when he blows someone up,\" Ventrone said. \"He's been blocking his butt off all preseason and the regular season. The special teams are where he can really make his case to stick around. He's done that. He's made himself valuable.\" Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T16:12:58.658+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
