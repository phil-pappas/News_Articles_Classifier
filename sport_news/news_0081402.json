There are a couple similarities with the volleyball and football team this week. The No. 20 Volleyball Cats also took the weekend off for the same reason the football team did. To prepare for Auburn. \nWith eight wins in a row, I am convinced the Cats are unstoppable. *knock on wood* \nThe Cats are coming off of a big 3-0 win over the no. 2 conference team and then-no. 22 Arkansas and now sit on top as the lone undefeated team in the SEC. This week’s no. 20 ranking marked the 40 th -consecutive week the Cats have been ranked, the longest in program history. \nWeekly Awards \nThis week senior setter Morgan Bergren and freshman right side hitter Brooke Morgan were named as SEC Players of the Week. For the first time this season, Bergren was named the league’s top performing player and setter, while Morgan was named Freshman of the Week , her second accolade. \nIn the Cats lone competition last week, Bergren finished with 32 assists on 42 of the team’s kills. With an additional 11 digs, she registered her second double-double of the season. Morgan had nine kills and four blocks, averaging 3 kills per frame. \nWhat’s up next \nThe Volleyball Cats will face Auburn (11-16, 3-2) Friday in Alabama at 8 p.m. More importantly the Cats will return to Lexington to face the Florida Sunday at 1 p.m. \nThe Cats (12-5) and Florida (17 th ) sit as the lone SEC teams currently ranked by AVCA, a rarity for a usually stronger league. Florida sits 3 spots higher than the Cats, but is currently 8 th in the SEC with three of its four losses coming from in conference. The Cats already beat the Gators on their own turf once . Another win over Florida is what the Cats need to determine the rest of the season. \nI beg you, get out to the match and support the Cats. \nThe Cats haven’t won an SEC Championship since ’88 , but with the hardest part of the schedule behind them, I am going to go ahead and predict something big for the girls this season. \n@Hessler_KSR Article written by Courtney Hessler Ashley Judd is my spirit animal.
