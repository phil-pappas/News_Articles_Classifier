It will stir many emotions within the Trojan Family.\nThe film, directed by Aaron Rahsaan Thomas, depicts the rise and “fall” of the USC football program under Pete Carroll in the 2000s. About two-thirds of it focuses on the good times – Carson Palmer winning the Heisman Trophy, USC winning back-to-back national championships, Reggie Bush making the magic happen against Fresno State. The film praises Carroll for recognizing the connection between USC and Hollywood and wisely using that to his advantage.\nThe film posits the 2006 Rose Bowl national championship loss to Texas as a pivot point. Narrator Michael B. Jordan describes it as “the beginning of the end of one of college football’s greatest empires.” The footage shown of that game, as well as the others, will give you goose bumps.\nWhether it actually was the beginning of the end is a matter of debate. “Trojan War” neglects to mention that USC went 34-5 over the next three seasons, winning three consecutive Rose Bowls. Even in the dark days of the Lane Kiffin-Steve Sarkisian era, the Trojans twice won 10 games and never won fewer than seven.\nObviously, the football program hasn’t reached its previous heights, which have been described as unprecedented for a reason. Attempts to recapture that time have proved futile, and it’s among many reasons USC likely will venture away from the Carroll coaching tree to replace the fired Sarkisian.\n“Trojan War” focuses on three main figures besides Carroll: quarterback Matt Leinart, running back LenDale White and Bush – the latter for obvious reasons. The film explains what went down with Bush and how it led to USC receiving NCAA sanctions that were practically unprecedented. It won’t satisfy Trojans fans who are still bitter about how unfair those sanctions were.\nAfter a recent screening at an L.A. theater, producer Mario Diaz said the film at one time included a six- to seven-minute segment on the corruption of the NCAA – but that it had to be cut for editing reasons. (The filmmakers had several hundred hours of footage that had to be condensed into 77 minutes). The segment is expected to be included among the DVD extras. Frankly, it’s a big enough topic for its own “30 for 30” film. “Trojan War II,” perhaps?\nCarroll, Leinart and White are among many people with direct and indirect USC ties who sat down to be interviewed. They include Snoop Dogg (who’s spectacularly funny), Texas grad Lance Armstrong (who’s referred to as “former cyclist” and aptly says “I know what it’s like” in reference to Bush being banished from USC) and agent-turned-author Josh Luchs (who wasn’t part of the USC scene and doesn’t belong in the film).\nBush declined to participate. Keyshawn Johnson, one of the film’s executive producers, said he contacted Bush about 40 times over the past 21/2 years, “but at the end of the day, it just wasn’t something he was comfortable doing.”\nThere are moments in “Trojan War” that might make you squirm. The ones that make you want to jump out of your seat far outnumber them.\nTHE SPORTS GUY’S GUYS \nIt appears Bill Simmons is getting the band back together.\nFour members of the editorial staff at ESPN’s Grantland.com announced Monday that they would be leaving the website to join Simmons to work on an unnamed project.\nWe know Simmons will have a show on HBO starting next year. He also has resumed podcasting. (In just two weeks time, “The Bill Simmons Podcast” has cracked iTunes’ top 10 .) Could a new, Grantland-esque website be next?\n“I still have to figure out where I’m going to write and how much I’m going to write,” Simmons said at the recent Vanity Fair New Establishment Summit .\nThe future of Grantland, which Simmons founded, is also uncertain. Another prominent editor, Dan Fierman, has left to oversee MTV News.\nSince resurfacing, Simmons has complained about a lack of corporate support for Grantland and his popular “BS Report” podcast. He already has secured several sponsors for his new podcast.\nREMOTE PATROL \nThe changes continue at Fox Sports 1, which canceled “America’s Pregame” earlier this month, causing many people to lose their jobs.
