TCU stormed back with two touchdowns in the final six minutes to hand K-State a 52-45 loss. By Ken Corbitt ken.corbitt@cjonline.com \nMANHATTAN — Kansas State was a good enough football team to build a 15-point first-half lead on the road against the No. 20-ranked team in the nation, and good enough to hold an 18-point halftime lead at home against the No. 2-ranked team. \nThe Wildcats just weren’t good enough to protect those leads and finish the games to secure victories. \nOklahoma State rallied for a two-point win with a last-minute field goal, and Saturday it was TCU that stormed back with two touchdowns in the final six minutes to hand K-State a 52-45 loss. \n“It’s frustrating because it’s been two weeks now that we needed to make a stop on defense and we didn’t make it happen,” said Wildcat defensive end Jordan Willis. \nTrevone Boykin had fourth-quarter touchdown runs of 14 and 69 yards to give TCU a 45-42 lead with 6:07 remaining. After K-State pulled even on Jack Cantele’s 37-yard field goal with 1:47 left, the Horned Frogs needed only two plays to regain the lead when Boykin hit Josh Doctson for a 55-yard touchdown pass with 1:10 left. \n“They make the big play to Doctson and (Boykin) had the zone-read,” Willis said of Boykin’s 69-yarder. “It’s heartbreaking because you need to make them earn touchdowns and we kind of gave it to them, and that hurts.” \nIt capped a night of big plays for the Horned Frogs (6-0, 3-0 Big 12), who got an 86-yard touchdown run from Aaron Green on the first play of the game and a 60-yard interception return from safety Derrick Kindred. \n“It’s something that makes you mad because you know what you’re capable of,” said Wildcat linebacker Elijah Lee, who had two interceptions, the first of his career. “Everybody is doubting us but we know what we’re capable of. It’s college football and anything can happen, but it’s just that time at the end of the game when we don’t execute that’s really frustrating.” \nFor the second game in a row the Wildcats (3-2, 0-2 Big 12) were sharp offensively in the first half but failed to score in the third quarter. \n“I don’t know what it is,” quarterback Joe Hubener said. “It’s something we have to figure out.” \nThe Wildcats went away from a balanced first-half offense that featured 165 rushing yards and 101 passing from Hubener to a pass-first gameplan the third quarter that saw Hubener go 1-for-9 for 17 yards with the pick-six interception return. \n“Last week we the first three possessions (of the third quarter) were three-and-out and I don’t think we were that bad (Saturday),” coach Bill Snyder said. “We still couldn’t get the ball downfield to the end zone, and in many cases we left the defense with not the best field position. The similarities are we didn’t play well enough.” \nThe task doesn’t get any easier for the Wildcats, who face their third straight ranked opponent when No. 19 Oklahoma — coming off a loss to Texas — comes to Snyder Family Stadium for a 2:30 p.m. game on Saturday. \n“It’s a tough situation we were put in,” said offensive tackle Cody Whitehair. “Games were in our hands that we could have won but we just have to execute better when it comes down to it.” \nSnyder said he saw something positive from the Wildcats against TCU, but they have to maintain that edge for four quarters. \n“I was proud of the youngsters because they did not give in,” Snyder said. “We did not play well enough to win, but I liked the way they came back from last week’s ballgame and the passion that they exhibited. I thought they went into the game with a passion that I have not seen out of this group, yet, and I felt positive about that.” \nQUICK KICKS \n■ With cornerback Morgan Burns sidelined, true freshman Duke Shelley pulled his redshirt and started the game in his collegiate debut. \n“Duke played well,” Snyder said. “He gave up some plays but, by and large for a freshman, he did a nice job.” \n■ Cornerback Danzel McDaniel left the game twice with an apparent knee injury. \n■ Kody Cook saw limited action and only at wide receiver after being injured at Oklahoma State in emergency quarterback duty when Hubener was forced out of that game. \n■ Back-up linebacker Trent Tanking is out with an injury to his right foot. The sophomore from Holton was on crutches along the sideline. \nKen Corbitt can be reached at (785) 295-1123 or ken.corbitt@cjonline.com .Follow Ken on Twitter @KenCorbitt .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:39:40.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
