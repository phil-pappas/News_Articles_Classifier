I’ve been lucky finding good horses to ride in stake races. Sometimes this business has its ups and downs but for some reason, I’ve always come up with a stake horse that turns a so-so meeting into a good one.” \nHis arrival at Hastings came through local horse owner Glen Todd, who frequently travels south in search of a jockey with plenty of riding talent and good character to ride for his successful racing stable. \nAmong jockeys Todd had contracted to ride for him in recent years were Mario Gutierrez, who went on to win the 2012 Kentucky Derby, and the following year Aaron Gryder, one of the most respected jockeys in the business who had ridden with success at race tracks all over the world. \n“I was lucky one of Mr. Todd’s contacts in the U.S. mentioned me to him,” said Lopez. “I’m pretty sure he could have picked anyone. But for him to choose me to come to Vancouver makes me feel very fortunate.” \nHaving ridden at several racetracks, he says there were few concerns about working out of a new jocks' room with riders he had never met before. \n“It’s always a little different with you being the new guy in town,” Lopez said. “But from the beginning I felt like one of the family because everyone was cool with me. You know, sometimes after a race tempers flair and problems can arise. But not here, this is a special jocks' room. I know when this meeting is over I will have made many new friends.” \nAmong the concerns of all new jockeys is how they adjust to the smaller Hastings racetrack. \n“For sure,” said Lopez. “It took me a few weeks to learn about handling it. Like, at the quarter pole is the first turn where on other racetracks that would be the three-eighths pole. Sure, at the beginning, I lost a few races by waiting to make my move a little longer than I should have. But I learned quickly.” \nAs for living here, he has nothing but nice things to say about Vancouver. \n“My wife Caroline and daughters Alondra (7) and Cassandra (3) visited for the summer and loved it,” said Lopez. “There were so many family places to visit. When you can go to work and your kids are nearby, it doesn’t get better than that.” \nLONG-TIME BOND: The friendship between Mike Chabara and Dave Elder began 59 years ago when both were in grade school. Through the years, Chabara became a top jockey at Exhibition Park riding some of the best horses of the era, including Coral Isle and Nine O’ Clock Gun. \nAs time went on, Chabara retired and became a trainer. Elder, as a horse owner and paraplegic, is now a successful businessman having started Advanced Mobility Products, which designs wheelchairs. \nSaturday, when Elder’s four-year old gelding Overtime — trained by Chabara — won the fifth race, you can just imagine what the celebration meant to each of them. \nNOTES ON A PROGRAM: Look for the matchup between Champion mare Beholder and American Pharoah in the $5-million Breeders Cup Classic in Kentucky Oct. 31, to be the race of the decade. Racing returns to Hastings Saturday and Sunday at 1:50 p.m. \n\ntwolski@shaw.ca \nyoutube.com/SportofKingsTV \n\nThis story was produced by Postmedia Works on behalf of the B.C.
