Brainard Ave. in La Grange.\n\"We have a population imbalance at our two schools,\" said board member Jennifer Planson, who proposed the idea..\nAbout 2,850 students attend Hinsdale Central High School this fall, compared with about 1,620 at Hinsdale South.\nHinsdale Central also is more crowded than South, a fact that has led a Steering Committee to recommend 20 more teaching spaces, such as classrooms, labs and study halls, be added at Central.\nBefore the district starts expanding and remodeling schools, the district should consider whether students could be reassigned to balance the student population, Planson said. Hinsdale South would have to expand if it were to hold roughly half the total district enrollment, officials said.\nHinsdale District 86 Board member files complaint against resident Kimberly Fornek Joan Brandeis, the mother of two Hinsdale South High School graduates, has spoken at many Hinsdale High School District 86 Board meetings in the past few years.\nSo she was surprised to learn a school board member had filed a complaint against her for remarks she made this summer.\nBoard member Edward...\nJoan Brandeis, the mother of two Hinsdale South High School graduates, has spoken at many Hinsdale High School District 86 Board meetings in the past few years.\nSo she was surprised to learn a school board member had filed a complaint against her for remarks she made this summer.\nBoard member Edward...\n(Kimberly Fornek) Although she suggested the idea of a freshman/sophomore campus and a junior/senior campus, Planson said she does not know whether that would be the best course.\n\"I'm neither for it, nor against it,\" Planson said Friday. \"Now is the time to have the conversation. We are in the early stages of our master facilities plan.\"\nJessica Hurt, the chairman of Hinsdale Central's social studies department, says she is familiar with the structure of dividing schools by grade level because her husband teaches at LTHS.\nShe believes one drawback is, \"school spirit gets lost. School spirit is driven by the upper class men; they are the leaders of the clubs and the sports teams.\"\nShe also wonders whether it would limit the choice of classes for students.\nCurrently, District 86 allows any level student to take any class for which he qualifies. In some classes, like American politics, freshmen, sophomores, juniors and seniors all may be in the same class.\nHinsdale District 86 approves $101 million budget Kimberly Fornek The Hinsdale High School District 86 Board approved Monday a $101 million budget for the current school year, which began July 1.\nA small surplus of $20,822 is forecast.\nThe budget is much higher than the tentative budget discussed in June, in part, because the school board decided to buy its own...\nThe Hinsdale High School District 86 Board approved Monday a $101 million budget for the current school year, which began July 1.\nA small surplus of $20,822 is forecast.\nThe budget is much higher than the tentative budget discussed in June, in part, because the school board decided to buy its own...\n(Kimberly Fornek) Dividing the grades between two schools would affect the sequencing of classes students take, if some classes are not going to be available to them in the upper grades, Hurt said.\nOn the other hand, if reorganizing the two schools reduces class size, Hurt said she is in favor of it.\n\"We have very large classes (at Central). I have 29 students in a world cultures class,\" Hurt said. \"If it helped with space and class size, that would be great.\"\nVolunteers on more than a dozen functional teams during the spring and summer identified areas they think need to be improved at all the district's facilities and grounds. The estimated cost of many of the items is in the tens of millions, leading people to consider the possibility that a referendum for a tax increase may be in the district's future.\nBecause Hinsdale Central is the older school and the one with more students, more improvements were recommended for Central than for South.\nBut the families who live in South's attendance boundaries make up a significant number of voters, school board member Claudia Manley said. Voters are not likely to agree to pay more money if the school their children or grandchildren attend would not benefit, Manley said.\nDividing students up according to grade, instead of geographic boundaries, would mean each student would attend both schools if they stayed in District 86 for four years.\nBoard President Kay Gallo and members Kathleen Hirsman and Edward Corcoran also were in favor of putting an advisory referendum on the March ballot.\nCorcoran also suggested Westmont High School should consider merging with District 86, because the school is small. Enrollment was about 450 students this fall. Westmont High School is part of Community Unit School District 201, which includes two elementary schools and a junior high school, in addition to the high school.\nCorcoran said he is against any boundary changes within District 86, but believes a merger with Westmont High School would provide more opportunities for the Westmont students and be a more efficient use of resources.\nThe District 86 Superintendent Bruce Law was asked to check with the district's lawyers and District 201 officials to see if a merger is possible.\nHirsman said assigning students to Central or South by grade level might be a less drastic change than revising the geographic boundaries for the school or the district.\nkfornek@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter: @kfdoings\n High Schools Hinsdale", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561426cd/turbine/ct-dhd-d86-corcoran-grievance-tl-1008-20151006", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5602cc1e/turbine/ct-dhd-d86-budget-approved-tl-1001-20150922", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bcf8a/turbine/ct-dhd-d86-referendum-campuses-tl-1015-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-12T18:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:31:37.588+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
