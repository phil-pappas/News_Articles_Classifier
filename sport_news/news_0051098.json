She did not say where he was taken in Los Angeles.\nThe statement from the Mercer and Odom families thanked the hospital and Odom's fans and said his estranged wife, Khloe Kardashian, his father and his two children from a previous relationship are with him.\n\"He continues to make miraculous progress, taking a few steps in Los Angeles,\" the statement said.\nKardashian posted a separate statement to her website saying Odom made \"incredible strides\" at the Las Vegas hospital and thanking the doctors and nurses \"for their kindness and diligent work.\" The family has received strength from the outpouring of support from Odom's fans, she said.\nNews of his release comes a day after a family statement said Odom's condition was improving. It said he was overcoming \"insurmountable obstacles\" and defying the odds.\nThe hospital and Odom's relatives have not revealed his prognosis, but the family has hinted at a long road ahead, saying they realize his \"continued improvement\" won't be easy.\nOdom was found in extremely critical condition Oct. 13 at the Love Ranch brothel in the rural community of Crystal, Nevada. He regained consciousness and communicated for the first time Friday.\nThe brothel said workers saw him drink alcohol and take supplements sold as \"herbal Viagra.\" The Food and Drug Administration issued a warning in 2013 against one brand he took, Reload, after it was found to contain sildenafil, the active ingredient in prescription Viagra.\nHe also told at least one of the women that he had done cocaine, but the brothel says it did not see him take any drugs or find any there.\nLove Ranch owner Dennis Hof has said that Odom arrived Oct. 10 for a four-day stay and spent $75,000 on two women who accompanied him in a VIP suite.\nThe Nye County Sheriff's Office is investigating. Test results from blood samples obtained through a warrant still are pending, and authorities have not ruled out the possibility of taking action against the brothel or Odom.\n___\nHo reported from Las Vegas.\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/AP/RWS/jsonline.com/MAI/334621381/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-20T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T03:46:37.957+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
