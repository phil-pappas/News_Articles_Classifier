(Photo: Steve Perez, Detroit News) \nLincoln Park has knocked off one Downriver League power already this season with its 18-15 win over Wyandotte on Sept. 18.\nNow, Lincoln Park plays host to another perennial power in Allen Park (6-1, 6-1) which sits atop the league standings with Trenton (6-1, 6-1).\nAllen Park has dominated the series of late, winning the previous six years by an average of 43-8, including 48-0 in 2013 and 44-7 last season.\nLincoln Park (5-2, 5-2), which lost 69 straight games from 2006-13, guaranteed its first winning season since 2002 with a 42-6 rout of Taylor Kennedy last Friday. A win over Allen Park or in its season finale against Gibraltar Carlson (5-2, 5-2) on Oct. 23 would earn the Railsplitters their first state playoff appearance since 2002.\n“To come out on top we have to eliminate the mental mistakes, don’t turn the ball over and don’t give up the big play for easy scores,” Lincoln Park coach Jamie Grignon said.\nSteve Glenn, a 6-foot-3, 250-pound quarterback, has enjoyed a strong senior season for Lincoln Park, but can the Railsplitters’ defense slow down dual-threat quarterback Antonio Mangiapane?\nPick: Allen Park by 8.\nSterling Heights Stevenson (6-1, 3-1) at Macomb Dakota (5-2, 3-1): This is a showdown for the Macomb Area Conference Red Division championship.\nStevenson was among four teams sharing the division lead a week ago, then dominated Warren Mott 38-7 to narrow the field, along with Chippewa Valley’s upset loss at the hands of Utica Eisenhower.\nThree-time MAC Red champ Dakota will have the luxury of playing Stevenson on its home field. Stevenson’s defense is outstanding, but Dakota running back Kaiser Carleton will make enough big plays to push the streak alive to four straight division titles.\nPick: Dakota by 2.\nNorthville (7-0) at Plymouth (6-1): Plymouth defeated rival Canton 31-20 last week to earn a spot in the KLAA Kensington Conference championship game against unbeaten Northville.\nPlymouth running back Cam Stella has rushed for 484 yards the last two weeks behind a strong line led by Ohio State-bound tackle Michael Jordan.\nLook for Stella to run for another 200-yard game in this one.\nPick: Plymouth by 6\nDearborn Fordson (4-3) at Dearborn (4-3): Both teams need a victory badly in this rivalry to keep their hopes alive for a state playoff spot.\nFordson has been in the playoffs the last nine years and is making a big push, winning three of its last four games, including an impressive 30-14 win over Robichaud last week.\nLook for Fordson to keep its firm grip in the rivalry after winning the last four games in the series, including 34-7 in 2013 and 35-0 last year.\nPick: Fordson by 10\ndavid.goricki@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/DavidGoricki", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T00:23:17.364+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
