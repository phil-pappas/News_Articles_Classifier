Godwin caught four passes for 135 yards, making three exceptional grabs with corners draped over him. Godwin called his one-handed, 37-yard touchdown grab the \"coolest.\" \n2. Better days for Barkley. Freshman Saquon Barkley made his first start but ran into a Maryland front that was looking for him. He gained 65 yards on 20 carries and fumbled twice, losing one (though that was an exchange issue with Hackenberg). \nAfter the fumble, Barkley promised his teammates he would make up for it. \n\"He showed a lot of maturity for a young guy,\" offensive lineman Angelo Mangiro said. \n3. About that tackling. Penn State's defensive players said Hills gave them headaches, particularly on the run-pass option plays. But they also admitted needing to tackle better, especially in the open field. \nHills converted several third downs on second-half touchdown drives that kept Maryland moving. But in the fourth quarter, Penn State's line limited those lanes, forcing Hills to throw the ball away on two key downs.

(Patrick Semansky / AP) \n4. Four stops. With a one-point lead in the fourth quarter, Penn State's defense forced consecutive stops with two interceptions, a fumble recovery and a possession change on downs. Linebacker Jason Cabinda called that as tense a quarter as he's played, since every play meant something. \n\"That was such a hard-fought game,\" Cabinda said. \"Every possession, every single play, mattered. To pull through, that was definitely one of the best wins I've been a part of.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:28:48.977+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
