Stephen Russell, the director of the Bahamas National Emergency Management Agency.\nPrime Minister Perry Christie said he was amending laws to mandate evacuations because some people were refusing to move into shelters.\n\"We do not know the impact of 130 miles an hour on those areas,\" he said, referring to the hurricane's winds. \"We know it's a horrific kind of experience.\"\nThe storm is expected to move near or over portions of the central Bahamas overnight.\nOn Eleuthera, Christian minister Dawn Taylor said she believed Eleuthera would withstand the hurricane because Bahamians learned how to cope with storms after devastating Hurricane Floyd in 1999, which had winds of 155 mph (249 kph) and generated up to 50-foot (15-meter) waves.\nTaylor said people on Eleuthera also are deeply religious and that their faith would carry them through.\n\"We depend on our God, and as long as he is with us, we will be fine and we will ride out the storm,\" she said.\nThe storm approached Eleuthera after it generated severe flooding on Acklins, where power went off overnight and phones were down. Russell said some of the roughly 565 people who live there were trapped in their homes.\nBahamas resident Shandira Forbes said she had spoken to her mother on Acklins by phone Thursday.\n\"She was calling for help because the sea was coming into her house,\" Forbes said. \"People's roofs were lifting up. No one knew (about the storm), so there was no preparedness, there was no meeting, there was nothing.\"\nIslands such as San Salvador, Cat Island and Rum Cay were expected to be hit hardest before the storm begins an expected shift toward the north, forecasters said.\nJoaquin had maximum sustained winds of 130 mph (215 kph), the U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said, calling it an \"extremely dangerous\" hurricane. As of 11 p.m. EDT, the storm was located about 20 miles (35 kilometers) east-southeast of Long Island after passing over Samana Cays, Bahamas. It was moving west at 3 mph (6 kph).\nWhile Samana Cays is usually uninhabited, eight to 10 people were working there, staying in temporary housing, when the storm hit, said Parliament member Alfred Gray.\n\"If the buildings look like they won't withstand, there are some caves on the side of the rock that they can go into because it's not prone to flooding,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, authorities in the nearby Turks & Caicos Islands closed all airports, schools and government offices.\nThe Cuban government issued a tropical storm warning for the provinces of Camaguey, Los Tunas, Holguin, and Guantanamo.\nJoaquin was predicted to turn to the north and northwest toward the United States on Friday, but forecasters were trying to determine how it might affect the U.S. East Coast, which was already suffering flooding and heavy rains from separate storms.\n\"There's still a distinct possibility that his could make landfall somewhere in the U.S.,\" said Dennis Feltgen, a meteorologist and hurricane center spokesman.\nThe Hurricane Center said parts of the Bahamas could see storm surge raising sea levels 5 to 10 feet (as much as 3 meters) above normal, with 10 to 15 inches (250 to 380 millimeters) of rain falling on the central Bahamas.\nThe Hurricane Center's long-term forecast showed the storm could near the U.S. East Coast along North Carolina and Virginia on Sunday or Monday.\n\"Residents of the Carolinas north should be paying attention and monitoring the storm. There's no question,\" said Eric Blake, a hurricane specialist with the center. \"If your hurricane plans got a little dusty because of the light hurricane season, now is a good time to update them.\"\nAssociated Press writers Ava Turnquest in Nassau and Tony Winton in Miami contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
