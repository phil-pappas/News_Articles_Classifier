By ROB OESTERLE - roesterle@shawmedia.com \nMORRIS – It was almost a perfect senior night for the Morris girls volleyball team Thursday. Related Links Morris serves up an easy win over Ottawa \nThe evening started with the three seniors – Kaylin Korte, Addison Polite and Maren Bashor – being honored for their contributions to the program. \nThen, a poster commemorating Korte’s accomplishment of 1,000 career kills was unveiled before Bashor and Polite sang the national anthem. \nWhen the match started, Morris raced out to an early lead and led the first game 19-11. Kaneland, however, refused to follow the script and came back to win the first game, 26-24. In the second game, the Knights continued their momentum, jumping out to an 8-0 lead. \nThis time, it was Morris’ turn to tip the table back in its favor, as the Redskins stormed back to grab a 25-23 win and send the match to a decisive third game. \nThe third was a back-and-forth affair, with neither team leading by more than four points. Morris took an early 6-2 advantage, but midway through the match, there were ties at 10, 11, 12 and 15 before Kaneland surged a bit to a 19-16 lead. Morris, however, came back to tie it at 20. There were also ties at 21, 22 and 23 before Kaneland scored the final two points of the match. \nThe match featured strong play on both sides, with both teams earning the majority of their points rather than getting points from other team’s mistakes. Korte added to her career total with 27 kills and also had three blocks to grab the school career block record, formerly held by Laney Torkelson. She also had 14 digs and two assists in her final match on her home floor. \n“Kaylin was all over the floor tonight,” Morris coach Taylor Lafond said. “She broke the block record and had 27 kills. I mentioned to her before the match that her dig total wasn’t nearly as high as it was last year, and she came out with 14 of them tonight. She’s just a competitor. \n“This was a tough loss. It seems like we have had a lot of these close matches, especially at home. One of these days, we are going to take that next step and win the close one.” \nThe Redskins (12-16-1, 2-4) saw plenty of players fill the stat sheet in the Northern Illinois Big 12 East loss. Janelle Brehm had seven kills, 10 digs, one assist and an ace, while Veronica Johnson had four blocks, a kill and an assist. Poliet had 22 assists, five digs and a kill, while Ashley Hood had 13 assists and six digs. Ryan Friend chipped in with three blocks, three digs and a kill. \n“Everyone was contributing,” Lafond said. “After that first game, having a big lead and losing 26-24, then falling behind big early, it would have been easy for the girls to hang their heads and go through the motions. But, they kept working hard, came back and won the second game and were right there in the third. I would rather have a tough loss like this than just rolling over. \n“The seniors were great tonight. Addison Polite was getting to balls she doesn’t normally get to and she left it all on the floor like you want a senior to do. We were working well as a team, but we just had a couple spots where things fell apart a little.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:38:18.809+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
