It cost Dolan $11.6 million following a judgment in favor of former Garden employee Anucha Browne Sanders.\n“I don’t know if I can explain it other than that there’s something inside both of us that’s really quite similar; the tenacity, the stubbornness,” Dolan tells Gumbel. “Isiah is a guy who doesn’t believe in his limitations. I’m a guy who doesn’t believe in his limitations.\nAsked if Thomas always has had his trust, Dolan adds, “Yeah, I think I’ve always understood him.”\nIt is that connection — the segment ends with Dolan gushing, “I think we’re going to be friends for a long time” — that brings Dolan out of his self-imposed silence. Dolan, even nearly a decade after losing in court over the accusations against Thomas, remains adamant in his support for him, still insisting that he believes he and Thomas were in the right.\nThomas said the contention that he called Browne Sanders derogatory terms “never happened. The players that were under me, I take full responsibility for their actions, on and off the floor. But me personally doing something to Anucha Browne, that never happened.”\nDolan backed him up when asked if she made it up, answering, “I think a bunch of it she did, yes. I was running a business and she didn’t do very well in it. She was unhappy in that and she decided to go get a lawyer.”\nDolan was offered a chance to settle out of court at the time for a small fraction of what he paid out in the suit, and turned it down. “True. My fault.” Asked why, he said, “Because I actually believed in the truth. The fighter in me came out. I’m like, you know what, I’m not going to settle because that’s an admission of guilt and we’re not guilty.”\nHe added of the criticism over the recent hiring of Thomas, including it being called the worst decision of his career, “I understood that there would be some people would be unhappy. … What do you want me to say about this? Yeah, it’s worse than I imagined.”\nEmail: popper@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T01:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:22:33.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
