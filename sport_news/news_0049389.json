The Saints looked nearly perfect in impressive victories against the Green Bay Packers and, just a few days later, the Carolina Panthers.\nIt's a reminder of how a 16-game season can ebb and flow.\nThe Saints were promptly swept in a three-game homestand after that two-game winning streak last year.\nWith that in mind, let's turn to the first question in this week's Twitter mailbag...\n@TheSaintsBeat Do you get the feel from the coaches and team that this is a must win game for us? Or are they going about business as usual?\n— Ryan K (@ryan_la_sports7) October 23, 2015 I haven't noticed anything out of the ordinary about this week. I don't know that there is -- or should be -- any more or less urgency than there was a week ago.\nWhile the Saints' hopes of winning the NFC South are slim, the wild card still offers a way in. In the last six seasons, NFC wild-card teams have been either 10-6 or 11-5. This year, there's at least a chance that one of the NFC wild cards could be 9-7.\nIn that scenario, the Saints would have to finish the season 7-3 -- difficult but not impossible. It also means there are at least two or three weeks before any game should be declared \"must win\" -- at least in the literal sense.\n@TheSaintsBeat #Saint Any idea about Spiller? Needs more snaps imho...if only as decoy. Health? Playbook? Might be too late too soon WK7 2-4\n— The River (@TheRiver2010) October 23, 2015 Larry Holder wrote a column on C.J. Spiller , and I'm not sure there's much more I can add. Spiller's limited role in the offense has been perplexing.\nPerhaps the external expectations were too high. After all, it's hard to keep three backs well-fed all the time. Perhaps Saints coach Sean Payton is being cautious given Spiller's preseason knee injury.\nTake away Spiller's 80-yard touchdown catch in overtime three weeks ago, and he's averaging only 22 yards per game (that's rushing and receiving). There's nowhere to go but up.\n@TheSaintsBeat Where is Brandon Coleman? Have the decreased his snap counts? Fewer targets? If so, why?\n— Eric Savage (@Savage_WhoDat) October 23, 2015 One theory is that the emphasis on short, quick passes (especially as injuries hit the offensive line) has decreased the opportunities for receivers, while increasing the targets for running backs and tight ends.\nAmong the receivers, Willie Snead and Brandin Cooks are guys who can get the ball in space and make plays. Brandon Coleman doesn't fit that mold.\nAll that said, even in situations that seem to call for a Coleman-like receiver (say, throws in the corner of the end zone), we haven't seen much of him.\nAnd when Marques Colston went down with a shoulder injury, one would have thought that Coleman would get tons of extra reps. That didn't happen either.\n@TheSaintsBeat what is the best option at left guard for Saints? Am I wrong that Lelito isn't working out?\n— Andrew Juge (@AndrewJuge) October 23, 2015 I hesitate to judge offensive line play; I'm not sure I have the qualifications. But I don't sense there are any internal plans to unseat Lelito.\nIn the short term, Senio Kelemete is next man up for all the interior line positions. But now that Lelito and Jahri Evans are healthy, Kelemete will return to the bench. Regardless of their internal evaluations of Lelito, guard could be a position that's high on the draft list in 2016 because of Evans' age.\n@TheSaintsBeat How's the relationship with Ryan and Allen working out? We see Ryan taking the blame but what's Allen's role?\n— Kendall (Kirbyo) (@ksortego) October 23, 2015 Ryan's taking the blame largely because he's the only one talking to the media. (During the season, NFL teams are required to provide access to the coordinators once a week. The Saints do that, via conference call, every Friday afternoon. Teams are allowed but not required to make other coaches available; the Saints choose not to.)\nFor his part, Ryan went out of his way to praise Allen on Friday. But Ryan's good at that. I don't think there's another person in the building that he hasn't given credit to at some point this season.\n@TheSaintsBeat I know the overall defensive numbers aren't good.. but who have been some of the best standouts on defense ?\n— Blake Lyons (@LyonsDesoto199) October 23, 2015 I agreed with Rob Ryan when he said a week ago that defensive end Cam Jordan was playing better than the numbers indicate. It's not like he magically turned on a switch against the Falcons. But Atlanta was much more vulnerable when playing from behind and having to be more aggressive.\nDelvin Breaux's performance has been well documents. Can you imagine this season without him? Another rookie corner, Damian Swann, is not as polished, but has shown good things.\nIf Dannell Ellerbe can even come close to matching his production in the Atlanta game, he'll be a nice asset in the middle of the defense.\n@thesaintsbeat Is it too early to hype Anthony + Kikaha + Breaux (Swann, Davison?) as core of emerging defense to be actually excited about?\n— Spencer LeBlanc (@spencerleblanc) October 23, 2015 Probably, but I think the defensive future definitely appears brighter than it did a year ago -- even if the defensive present is still pretty much the same.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AndrewJuge/status/657580149861437440", "https://twitter.com/Savage_WhoDat/status/657583105969000449", "https://twitter.com/LyonsDesoto199/status/657578327260049409", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Saint?src=hash", "https://twitter.com/spencerleblanc/status/657576055386062848", "https://twitter.com/TheSaintsBeat", "https://twitter.com/ryan_la_sports7/status/657577542807752704", "https://twitter.com/TheRiver2010/status/657590376702869504", "https://twitter.com/ksortego/status/657578421677985792"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:39:20.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
