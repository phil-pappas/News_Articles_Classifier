Will Burns (4th), the Emanuel ally who chairs the City Council’s Education Committee, was released just minutes before Barbara Byrd- Bennett pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud, admitting her role in a scheme to get a 10-percent kickback — at least $2.3 million — on all CPS contracts she could steer to her former employer.\n“While the U.S. Attorney made abundantly clear that the former CEO and her co-defendants ‘worked to hide and conceal their graft’ and ‘misled’ officials of the Board of Education, we see it is our duty to do everything we can to assure the public and the hundreds of thousands of students, teachers, principals and parents who depend on CPS that we will do everything in our power to ensure that this will not happen again,” Claypool wrote to Burns, in a letter hand-delivered to City Hall reporters.\n“Our objective is simple: to ensure that every possible dollar reaches our classrooms and to assure taxpayers that their resources are being used wisely.”\nClaypool proceeded to tick off the safeguards CPS either has already implemented or will continue to put in place in response to a “third-party review” of its sole-source contracting process conducted by Accenture, an independent consulting firm hired in June.\nThose measures include: establishing a policy that “distinguishes sole and single-source procurements” and publishing both online in advance of Board of Education meetings to create “transparency” and “alert other possible vendors” before those contracts are awarded.\nAt Accenture’s behest, CPS has also “redefined” source-source vendors as those contractors who “have a unique product or service that no other organization can offer” to the school system.\nThat was clearly not the case with the no-bid, $20.5 million principal training contract with SUPES Academy at the heart of the Byrd-Bennett scandal.\nThe SUPES contract raised eyebrows from the outset because the company once employed Byrd-Bennett, because of the poor quality of training and because similar training could easily have been done at far less cost by Chicago-area universities that specialize in it.\nThe largest no-bid contract in CPS history was also awarded shortly after the furor over a record 50 school closings.\nTo restore public confidence severely shaken by the scandal, Claypool wrote that he is prepared to take additional steps in the coming months in response to Accenture’s recommendations.\nThey include requiring “single or sole-source” requestors that would have included Byrd-Bennett to “disclose any past or present business or personal relationships with the vendor” and “formalizing” the Non-Competitive Procurement Review Committee’s charter.\nAt Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s request, Claypool said the city’s Inspector General Joe Ferguson and Chief Procurement Officer Jamie Rhee are working together to “study how successful reforms implemented over the last four years” at Hall “can be expanded to sister agencies, including CPS.”\nClaypool closed his letter by noting that CPS has undertaken a “top-to-bottom audit” in recent months that “may result in further policy changes if deemed necessary for transparency and to ensure that all the right checks-and-balances are in place.”\nHe pointed to his own recent appointment of Andrell Holloway as the new CPS auditor. Holloway is among a cadre of trusted advisers Claypool brought over from the CTA. Holloway has 20 years of auditing expertise, including a stint at KPMG LLP.\n“The District has and will examine nearly every aspect of its operations, including the organization itself, its contracts, employees, travel, capital projects, facilities, enrollment and individual school operations. Additional areas will also be audited in the coming year,” Claypool wrote.\n“As we continue to focus on supporting the work of our principals, teachers, students and parents, we look forward to working hard to make sure that they have full confidence that their interests are Chicago Public Schools’ highest priority.”\nBurns called Claypool’s letter an “important first step” toward “restoring public confidence” in CPS severely shaken by the Byrd-Bennett scandal.\n“It’s especially important, given that CPS wants the Legislature to come up with $500 million. We need to be able to show the Legislature and the public that safeguards are in place to protect public money,” Burns, one of Emanuel’s staunchest African-American supporters, said Tuesday.\n“Most of it are things CPS can do on their own internally. It’s about doing it. Having Accenture come in, look at how they’ve done sole-source contracts in the past, looking at the review committee and making sure that safeguards are in place to make sure this doesn’t happen again.”\nByrd-Bennett — Emanuel’s second permanent choice to run a Chicago Public School system drowning in red ink — was accused of engineering a scheme to get a ten percent kickback on all CPS contracts she could steer to her former employer.\nThe plotting was outlined in emails remarkable for their detailed audacity.\nAt one point, Byrd-Bennett wrote that she had “tuition to pay and casinos to visit.” That was a reference to the bank accounts she allegedly arranged for Solomon to set up to pay the college tuition of her twin grandsons.\nThe scheming began even before Byrd-Bennett replaced her predecessor, Jean Claude-Brizard, at the bargaining table and helped negotiate an end to the 2012 teachers strike that was Chicago’s first in 25 years.\nThe embarrassing and ill-timed scandal could give state lawmakers an excuse not to give CPS the $480 million in pension help needed to avoid devastating mid-year budget cuts that could force thousands of teacher layoffs and send class sizes through the roof.\nEmanuel’s campaign to convince the City Council to impose a $45 million property tax levy for school construction—even after raising property taxes by $543 million for police and fire pensions—may also be in jeopardy.\nClaypool’s letter was an obvious attempt to minimize the political fall-out and to reassure outraged parents whose children have been hit hard by budget cuts that may not have been necessary if the tainted SUPES contract had been stopped in its tracks.\nEarlier this week, Emanuel also tried to turn the page.\nRather than focus on the old school board that signed off on the SUPES contract, the mayor chose to highlight the steps he has taken ever since the scandal broke and the first federal subpoenas arrived at CPS.\n“The point is, what has happened since? We have basically a new board. We have a new CEO. We have a new chief education officer,” Emanuel said.\n“There’s been a process put in place. Joe Ferguson and Jamie [Rhee] are setting out a series of criteria as it relates to procurement and reforms in that place. And Forrest has put in place a series of not only checks and balances, but also some auditing that has to be done going forward. So steps going forward is exactly what you want to see by a new leadership team.”\nAfter Byrd-Bennett pleaded guilty, Kelley Quinn, Emanuel’s spokeswoman, issued a statement:\n“Today, Barbara Byrd-Bennett took responsibility for putting her own financial gain ahead of what was in the best interest of the children she pledged to serve. This continues to be a matter for the courts. The Mayor and Chicago Public Schools’ leadership will continue to focus on our students, teachers and principals so that we can continue the progress that is being made in classrooms across the City, and enact further safeguards to help prevent this type of abuse from happening again.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:09:48.218+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
