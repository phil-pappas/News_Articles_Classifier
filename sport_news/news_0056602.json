As Commissioner Manfred noted, economic parity is fueling owners and general managers to dip into their pocketbooks to increase their odds of making the postseason.“We have been greatly assisted in the fact that we have had excellent competitive balance,” Manfred said to USA Today . “I think the teams that are set to go into the postseason show that. You have storied, large market brands like the Dodgers, Mets, the Yankees, plus smaller markets such as Kansas City and Pittsburgh, and we’re going to get the Toronto Blue Jays back in after over 20 years.”Regardless of spending, it’s really how wisely you do so. After all, the Philadelphia Phillies had the 10th-highest player payroll in all of MLB, and the second-highest in the NL East ($137,810,172) behind only the Washington Nationals and ended with the worst record in all of baseball at (UPDATE THIS) 62-99. Translate that into dollars and the Phillies spent $2,222,745 per win. As you’ll see, that’s a lot for so little. High Payrolls Help While said at the outset that spending money doesn’t get you wins, it doesn’t hurt. A few years ago I had a conversation with President and CEO of the Los Angeles Dodgers, Stan Kastan that highlights the real formula for constructing winning rosters.“It never hurts to be rich,” Kastan said of having resources to spend on player talent. “But you have to be smart, first.”That should make sense. If you spend on free agents, or have offered extensions to retain key talent you have developed, you’d expect the best players to garner higher salaries.So, it should come as no surprise that the vast majority of the teams in the postseason have high payrolls. Four of the rosters (are in the top 10 in all of baseball. They are:\nLos Angeles Dodgers - $310,871,568 (Tops in all of baseball) t New York Yankees - $218,865,148 (Ranked #2 behind the Dodgers) t Texas Rangers - $151,611,041 (Ranks #7 in MLB) t Toronto Blue Jays - $138,023,568 (Ranks #9 in MLB) Four more are in the top 20. The Cubs, who barely missed the top 10 at #11 ($131,417,485), followed by Cardinals at #12 ($129,884,787), Royals at #13 ($124,578,473), and Mets at #17 ($114,639,437). It’s not until you get to the Pirates (#24) and Astros (#25) that you get any teams at the low-end of the player payroll spectrum where they see player payrolls below $100 million (Pirates at $98,927,120, and Astros at $80,548,328).While that’s ranking by all 30 clubs, the key is spending within your own Division. After all, those are the teams you’re competing with most often. The average salary ranking by Division for all of the payrolls averages them at #2. Four of the 10 teams rank #1 in player payroll for their Divisions (Dodgers, Yankees, Rangers, and Cubs). Three rank as the second-highest (Blue Jays, Cardinals, Royals) while the rest sees the Mets rank third in the NL East and the Pirates ranking last in the NL Central, the Astros ranking fourth in the AL West. Who Gets The Biggest Bang For Their Buck? The big question is, which of these teams is getting the most for their payroll dollar? For some, this is critical in how they are able to balance resources to get to the postseason. For some clubs like the Dodgers and Yankees, while being effective is important in getting to the postseason, based on the lavish sums being spent, by setting payrolls so high at the beginning of the season, not making the postseason is seen as unacceptable. The Dodgers will be the first club to eclipse the $300 million barrier, and with it, smash through MLB’s Luxury Tax threshold. Currently the Dodgers are a whopping $121,871,568 over. Read that again. The Dodgers payroll over the Luxury Tax ceiling is larger than the Astros, Pirates, and Mets are spending on player payroll for their playoff teams. The Yankees will only be $29,865,148 over baseball’s soft cap.By taking the number of wins for each team and dividing it by the number of wins, we get the cost per win. BELOW SHOWS COST PER WIN FOR ALL THE POSTSEASON TEAMS The 10 teams in the postseason averaged $1,628,657 per win. Based upon the massive payroll [tweet_Quote: display=\"The Dodgers spent a whopping $3,379,039 for each of their 92 wins\"]the Dodgers have had, they are the least efficient in spending with a whopping $3,379,039 for each of their 92 wins[/tweet_Quote: ] . The Yankees were the team that spent the second-most per win at $2,515,691 or $863,347 less than the Dodgers per win.As to who got the biggest bang for their buck, [tweet_Quote: display=\"The Houston Astros got the biggest bang for the buck for the 2015 postseason teams spending $936,608 per win\"]that belongs to the Houston Astros[/tweet_Quote: ] . With a total player payroll of $80,548,328 each of their 86 wins cost just $936,608 per win. They are the only playoff team to have spent less than $1 million per game.The Astros will face the Yankees in the AL Wild Card game on Tuesday (8pm ET on ESPN). As the teams enter, they could not be more divergent. The Yankees spent $1,579,083 more per win based upon the veteran lineup compared to the Astros which is largely built off talent developed in-house.The question is, how will these teams fair now that it is baseball’s second season? As we’ve seen prior, teams that dominate in the regular season are not always the odds-on favorite to win the World Series. Pitching becomes all the more critical. As we saw last year, just Madison Bumgarner was pretty much the difference maker in the San Francisco Giants beating the Kansas City Royals. So, all that efficiency and effectivity becomes a thing of the past, now that they teams are in the postseason. That’s why teams spend the way they mostly do. Once you’re in the postseason, it’s a whole new ballgame. It all starts on Tuesday at Yankee Stadium.
