Lapel loses heartbreaker to Scecina in final seconds By Bill Cross | For The Herald Bulletin Herald Bulletin \nLAPEL -- It was a heartbreaking finish to a solid season for Lapel on Friday night as the Bulldogs dropped their Sectional 37 game 14-13 to Indianapolis Scecina on a last-second touchdown. \nThe Crusaders forced a Bulldogs punt with 4:11 to go. The punt took a Scecina roll, giving them possession at the Lapel 25. Scecina then took advantage of injuries to the Bulldogs’ run defense -- defensive tackle Maison Davis and linebacker Andrew Butcher were both injured in the third quarter. \n“The defense got worn down and a couple of guys got injured,” coach Tim Miller said. “It changes things. They could get up to our linebackers, which is when they could run on us.” \nScecina milked the clock down to 22 seconds when running back Darrell Johnson went in from the two on fourth and goal. The extra point was good, giving Scecina their first and only lead of the night. \nLapel had a chance to run an offensive play but quarterback Levi Frazier was sacked as time ran out. \n“It’s a disappointing loss,” Miller said. “We had them on the ropes, our defense played absolutely phenomenal. I couldn’t ask for anything more out of them. Just came up a play or two short.” \nThe Bulldogs led from the opening kickoff when Preston Scott went 90 yards for a touchdown. Lapel scored again in the second quarter on a Will Jones 5-yard run. \nLapel took a 13-0 lead into halftime, outplaying the visiting Crusaders the entire way. Jones had 123 yards at the half. The Bulldogs’ defense held Scecina to just 95 yards of offense and forced two turnovers, one on a great diving catch by Dalton Mills of a tipped pass and the other a recovered fumble by Chris Lee. \nThe second half was all Scecina as the Crusaders made their comeback with the running game. The Crusaders’ defense limited Lapel to just six offensive plays and six yards in the half. \nScecina took the second-half kickoff and went 55 yards in 11 plays, chewing up nearly six minutes of the clock before Johnson went in from the five. Scecina forced a three-and-out by Lapel and went on another long drive. The Crusaders went 70 yards, rushing 16 times to only one pass attempt. The Bulldogs’ defense stood tall, however, turning back the Crusaders at the Bulldogs 10 yard line midway through the fourth quarter. \nScecina outgained Lapel 244-132 for the game and ran 36 offensive plays in the second half to Lapel’s six. \nLapel finishes 4-6 on the season and will graduate seniors Tanner Winningham, Dalton Mills, Andrew Butcher, Pierce Pickett, Ryan Cleckley, Connor Hickey, Maison Davis, Ben Welling, Clayton Young and Nathan Sexton. \n“Hats off to these seniors, they started the same time I started here,” said Miller, who completed his fourth year at the helm. “They were out there when we had 28 kids. They were able to win a sectional in their career and see things going in the right direction.” \nMiller also noted that the Bulldogs will be tough to deal with in 2016 with at least 17 starters slated to return. \n“I told them that the future is bright but nobody’s going to give it you,” Miller said of his postgame speech to the team. “We have to get better in the offseason. We hung with a lot of teams. We return 10 starters on offense and defensively we will return at least seven. The nucleus is there but it’s a long time away. We’ll see what happens.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:52:45.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
