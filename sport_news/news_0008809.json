Nicole Orford of Burnaby, B.C. and Asher Hill of Pickering, Ont., earned top spot on the podium with a 146.65-point performance. Andréanne Poulin of Ile-Bizard, Que., and Marc-André Servant of Vaudreuil, Que., moved up from fourth after the short dance to capture silver. \n''Our programs are coming together really well,'' said Orford. \n''So well, that sometimes we forget we are a new team. We are both perfectionists because our previous partnerships were so successful, so we need to remind ourselves we've only skated for three months.'' \nMeanwhile Olympic champion Yuzuru Hanyu of Japan won the gold medal in men's singles with 277.19 points. He was followed by Canadian champion Nam Nguyen of Toronto, who came away with silver. Sean Rabbitt of the U.S. finished third. \nElizabet Tursynbayeva of Kazakhstan won the gold in the women's competition.
