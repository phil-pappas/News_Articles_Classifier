Comment Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 8:25 PM Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 8:25 PM UTICA While Comets fans say last season will be hard to live up to, they still thronged Utica Memorial Auditorium Wednesday for the sold-out home opener. The season began on the road earlier this month with losses against Rochester Amerks and the Hartford Wolfpack. The Comets played the Amerks again Wednesday night. Awaiting fans at the Aud were several major renovations — both inside and out. “A pulled chicken sandwich, mac and cheese, sweet potato fries,” said Megan Wyett of New York Mills, listing her meal at Kookie’s Q, a new barbecue joint in the concourse. “It’s nice because it’s different from the normal foods you get at an arena.” Joining it is the new One 9 Five 9, a full service bar by Turning Stone Resort Casino, named in honor of the year construction of The Aud was complete. Mike and Cheryl Lavelle of Frankfort wore black hats strung with LED lights — a metaphor for this season, they say. “Last year, we were the good guys,” Mike Lavelle said. “This year,” he and his wife said in unison, “we’re taking no prisoners.” Ashley and Christine Luce, sisters and Comets fans that became popular last season by their extravagant outfits, said regardless of the team’s lineup, they’ll always support them. “I think we have the ability to make it to the second round of playoffs this year,” Christine Luce said. “I have faith in the team, solely because we still have the entirely same coaching staff. But do I think we’re going to do as well this season? No.” Benjamin Nelson, 8, was excited to see his favorite player, Joe Cannata, the team’s goalie. His favorite part? “I can’t wait to go through the tunnel and see all the players.” “He’s part of the Utica Comets Kids Club, so he gets to give high-fives to the players after they come in from practice,” said Rory Nelson, his father. Walt Raymond of Whitesboro teased his friend Rick Davis, who he calls Mr. Comet. “Twelve months a year, every day, all day, he’s talking about the Comets,” Raymond said. “We get text updates all day long. We’re sitting around the pool with a beer over the summer, he’s talking about the Comets.” Davis couldn’t deny his love for the team. “Calder Cup again, baby,” Davis of Whitesboro said. “We got this.” The Comets will face off against the Hershey Bears Friday and the Bridgeport Sound Tigers Saturday, both at 7 p.m. at the Aud.
