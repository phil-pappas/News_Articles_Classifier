Common Core explained By Eric Poole epoole@ellwoodcityledger.com   \nMathematics scores on 2015 Pennsylvania System of School Assessment testing are down across the state, and educators from state Department of Education Secretary Pedro Rivera to administrators for Ellwood City Area and Riverside school districts agree on the cause. \nThe 2015 PSSA was the first in which the test content conformed to Pennsylvania’s Common Core mathematics standards. \nJoe Mancini, Ellwood City Area School District superintendent, said the standards, established in 2014, introduce concepts years earlier than they previously had been taught. \nThat applies in the English language arts and mathematics portions of the PSSA, but the impact has been seen particularly in the math scores. On the 2014 test, 72 percent of the state’s students earned “proficient” or “advanced” scores, effectively passing grades, on the math test. \nThis year, no single grade level in the state had more than half of the students score in the passing range. The highest statewide average math score was the third-grade group, which had 48.5 percent of students at “proficient” or “advanced” level. The statewide third-grade average for 2014 was 75 percent. \nMancini and Riverside Superintendent David Anney said they had some eighth-graders who completed Algebra I and were eligible to take the Keystone Exam, a requirement for graduation starting with the class of 2017 for that subject. \nAt Lincoln Junior-Senior High School and Riverside High School, a handful of students managed to meet the graduation requirement for math but didn’t get a passing score on the eighth-grade PSSA math test. \nMancini said the state had considered phasing in alignment between Common Core principles and the PSSA test content over several years, with third-graders -- who are most familiar with the concepts -- getting the updated test this year. \nNext year, third- and fourth-graders would have received the Common Core-based test, with another grade level added each year until the students in third grade this year were in 11th grade and the entire testing regimen was core-based. \nBut the state dropped that plan because it would take too long to fully implement core standards in the tests, Mancini said. In the state math averages, third-graders had the highest scores and the marks fell steadily by grade up to the eighth grade, where only 29.8 percent of students scored \"proficient\" or \"advanced.\" \nCommon Core is, according to the state Department of Education, a set of instructional concepts that students are expected to know at each grade level. The Common Core standards are based on lessons taught at top schools in the United States and the world. \nFor example, here is an excerpt from the state’s math standards for the third grade: “Use multiplication (up to and including 10 × 10) and/or division (limit dividends through 50, and limit divisors and quotients through 10) to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, arrays, and/or measurement quantities.” \nAlthough the goals are standard for every school in the state – every third-grader in Pennsylvania will be expected to know the multiplication tables up through 10 -- the Department of Education’s website reports that individual school districts, schools and even teachers are given flexibility in establishing curriculum for reaching those goals. \nOne frequently used Common Core concept is word problems, which adds a step to the mathematics process by forcing students to figure out what mathematical equation will solve the problem before they can solve the problem. \nMancini said the new mathematics standards reflect an effort to help students learn to solve real-world problems. \n\"You want students to solve problems and think critically, not just for school, but for life,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:26:48.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
