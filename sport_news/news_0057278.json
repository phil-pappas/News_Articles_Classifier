After a 31-19 defeat to Georgia State at Scheumann Stadium, the Cardinals became the fourth team to lose to the Panthers in the last four seasons. \nBall State allowed 24 points in the final 15:15 of the first half in losing its fourth straight game. \n“This group is struggling to put 60 minutes together to stay focused and execute well enough for 60 minutes,” Lembo said after the game. “I have to find some more creative ways to get through to them. It’s disappointing, and at the end of the day, I take responsibility.” \n“I think we’ve got a lot of good guys in that locker room,” he added later. “But we need to dig deeper, and we need to realize we’re going to be in a lot of tight games like this, and we’re not playing well enough to win right now. I have to find a way to get more out of them.” \nThe Cardinals (2-5) have lost to some good teams this season — No. 16 Texas A&M, No. 17 Northwestern and now No. 22 Toledo — but the Panthers aren’t in the same ballpark as any of those teams. Heck, not even the same ZIP code. Georgia State, which started its program in 2008, had only beaten one FBS program before Ball State and was 3-37 in its last four seasons entering Saturday. \nThere have been worse losses — like last year against Indiana State — but this was especially disappointing given the potential the Cardinals had shown earlier this season against a strong schedule. \n“We just weren’t quite clicking on all cylinders, I thought,” said freshman quarterback Riley Neal, who completed 28 of 48 passes for 218 yards and two touchdowns. “One play I’d mess something up … Just miscues here and there. Not from one set group, we just struggled a little bit all being on the same page.” \nIt was the second quarter that did them in. After Ball State took a 10-7 lead on Neal’s touchdown toss to tight end Dylan Curry, the Panthers (2-4) scored 17 straight to close the quarter, capped by Wil Lutz’s 50-yard field goal on the final play of the first half. \nBall State allowed Will Arbuckle, the Sun Belt’s leading passer, to throw for 412 yards. The Cardinals did play better in the second half, not allowing any points until the final 2:13, but that wasn’t the point. \n“We can’t wait until we’re in trouble to start playing well,” linebacker Ben Ingle said. “We have to maintain that focus from the start to the finish. We’re having a hard time doing that right now.” \nFor the second time in three weeks, Ball State had a touchdown called back because of offensive pass interference. Two weeks ago, it wiped out Jordan Williams’ fourth-quarter touchdown against Toledo, and Saturday’s was just as costly as a 49-yard score from Neal to Chris Shillings on fourth-and-2 in the third quarter was wiped out. After the game, Lembo reiterated that his coaching staff doesn’t teach anything illegal. \nNeal connected with Jordan Williams, who now has a reception in 31 straight games, for a 19-yard touchdown with 10:41 left, but the Cardinals didn’t mount another serious threat. \n“We have some good players in there that need to be more reliable right now,” Lembo said. “... It’s frustrating because I like them, I believe in them, they’re good guys and I know they care. But for whatever reason ... we’re struggling to get some of them over the hump. It’s frustrating, but we’ll keep plugging along and stay the course.” Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1LBsicQ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:04:56.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
