And despite leading the rally, Luck largely blamed himself for the miscues that brought out the boo-birds at halftime. \n\"Sure, you hear them, I guess,\" Luck said. \"Fans are fans, and I still think we have the best fans in the world.\" \nThe Saints' oft-criticized defense pressured Luck into mistakes all day, hitting him 10 times, sacking him four times and intercepting him twice. Brady does it all Tom Brady completed 14 of 17 passes with two touchdowns in the fourth quarter as New England overcame a four-point deficit to beat the New York Jets 30-23 and remain unbeaten (6-0). \nPretty typical Brady. What was less typical was that Brady also scored on a keeper from the 1, had an 11-yard scramble on a third-and-10, and with 15 rushing yards he was the Patriots' leading runner for the first time in his career. Advertisement \n\"I should enjoy this, because it will probably never happen again,\" said Brady, who threw the ball on all but nine plays -- tying the NFL record for the fewest rushes in a win. \nBrady was 34 of 54 for 355 yards overall -- numbers that would have been even better if not for the 11 drops by his receivers, six by newly activated Brandon LaFell. \n\"We made the plays when we needed to make them,\" Brady added. \"I think that was the important thing.\" Tannehill's perfection Miami Dolphins quarterback Ryan Tannehill had a perfect passer rating and was an NFL record-setter in a 44-26 victory over the Houston Texans. \nTannehill, who had pinpoint accuracy with mostly short and intermediate passes, finished with a perfect 158.3 passer rating. That capped a day in which he was 18-for-19 passing for 282 yards, four touchdowns and no interceptions. \nTannehill at one point completed 18 consecutive passes, a streak that ended in the fourth quarter on an incomplete pass to tight end Dion Sims. But Tannehill established an NFL record for most consecutive passes completed -- 25 including his final seven passes from last week's 38-10 victory at Tennessee. Cousins leads comeback There were plenty of reasons for Kirk Cousins and Washington to believe this game was not going to go their way. \nThe team trailed by 24 points in the second quarter. It had been outscored by 43 points in third quarters so far. Cousins hadn't thrown more than one touchdown pass in any game this season. \nAt halftime, coach Jay Gruden lit into his players. \nSomething finally clicked. Cousins completed three second-half TDs, including the go-ahead score to Jordan Reed with 24 seconds left, and Washington came back to stun the Bucs 31-30 for the largest comeback in franchise history. \n\"Everybody was pretty upset. Jay was livid,\" left tackle Trent Williams said about a loud halftime locker room. \"You rarely every see him in that state. But he was on the gas.\" \nCousins finished 33 for 40 for 317 yards, the three scores and zero interceptions. He also ran for an 8-yard touchdown. \n\"It was a good lesson: Just keep playing, and you never know what can happen,\" Cousins said. Stafford hurting Detroit Lions quarterback Matthew Stafford ended his second game against the Minnesota Vikings in the same place he ended the first -- the X-ray room. \nStafford hurt his left hand in the second half of the 28-19 loss to the Vikings but finished the game and said he doesn't expect the injury to be an issue going forward. \"I think it's OK,\" Stafford said. \"We'll see.\" \nStafford, who needed X-rays on his ribs and chest after the Vikings beat the Lions 26-16 last month, took another pounding from Minnesota's aggressive defensive front Sunday. The Vikings sacked Stafford seven times. More injuries Running back Arian Foster injured his right Achilles tendon late in the fourth quarter of Houston's loss at Miami. Texans coach Bill O'Brien said he didn't know the severity of the injury but added, \"It obviously didn't look good.\" If Foster tore his Achilles, his season is over. \nEagles left tackle Jason Peters, a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, left the game against the Panthers with lower back spasms. \nCowboys running back Joseph Randle left with a back strain in the first quarter. \nChargers left guard Orlando Franklin injured his knee. \nJets center Nick Mangold left in the fourth quarter after hurting his neck when he collided with a defensive lineman. \nBills linebacker A.J. Tarpley (Stanford) left with a possible concussion.
