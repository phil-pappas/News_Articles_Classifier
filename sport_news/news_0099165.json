In his first broadcast as the full-time play-by-play caller for the team, Hideo Nomo no-hit the Orioles.\nThe call: \"Lifted in the air to left, O'Leary coming on and Hideo Nomo has no-hit the Baltimore Orioles!\"\nClay Buchholz no-hitter (2007)\nIn the second start of Clay Buchholz's career, the righty hurled a no-hitter of his own against the Orioles.\nThe call: \"Clay Buchholz has thrown a no-hitter in Boston tonight, and it sends Fenway into a frenzy!\"\nJon Lester no-hitter (2008)\nOrsillo was on the call when longtime ace Jon Lester tossed a no-hitter just over a year after finishing chemotherapy treatments.\nThe call: \"Callaspo strikes out! Jon Lester has thrown a no-hitter at Fenway.\"\nMother's Day miracle (2007)\nIn one of the greatest comebacks in Red Sox history, they rallied from a 5-0 deficit in the bottom of the 9th to walk-off against the Orioles on Mother's Day.\nThe call: \"Boston comes all the way back! A six-run ninth!\"\nCoco Crisp charges the mound (2008)\nIn a heated previous meeting, outfielder Coco Crisp had taken out Rays second baseman Akinori Iwamura with a hard slide. The next time he came to the plate against Tampa Bay, James Shields drilled him.\nThe call: \"Shields hits Crisp annnnd... Coco is going to head out. Here we go!\"\nDavid Ortiz fights Kevin Gregg (2011)\nAfter three straight brushback pitches, David Ortiz and Kevin Gregg finally came to blows after Ortiz popped out.\nThe call: \"David Ortiz is going out and it's time to fight!\"\nDavid Ortiz ejection (2013)\nEjections happen all the time in baseball, but this one was special. Ortiz was tossed for arguing balls and strikes, and then teed off on the phone in the visitor's dugout at Camden Yards.\nThe call: \"...I don't think that phone is going to work anymore.\"\nDavid Ortiz walk-off (2013)\nThe Red Sox had 11 walk-off wins during their 2013 campaign that culminated in a World Series, and Orsillo was the voice of most of them.\nThe call: \"A three-run homer for Big Papi, the Red Sox win in spectacular fashion!\"\nBrock Holt hits for the cycle (2015)\nBrock Holt became the first Red Sox in almost two decades to hit for the cycle earlier this season.\nThe call: \"The Brock star hits for the cycle.\"\nDavid Ortiz hits No. 500 (2015)\nOrtiz launched his 500th home run earlier this month, and Orsillo was at his best.\nThe call: \"Big Papi, the greatest clutch hitter in Red Sox history, adds to his resume with number 500!\"", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/GX4usRXEuZI", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/bTpAD2oIli0", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/fuMjvPTOCmE", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/i0n4ihd492Y", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/IO5BRrL9qpk", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/FGfKfMmR-xU", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/93t3cFLCw7Q", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/OZIMU0pm67s", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/iYA5GQr2jUc", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/VL6U91lwQcA"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:44:12.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
