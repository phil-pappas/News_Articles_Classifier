Jeff Gordon led a Hendrick Motorsports rout in qualifying Saturday to win the pole for his final race at Talladega Superspeedway.\nGordon led teammates Kasey Kahne and Jimmie Johnson in a sweep of the top three starting spots for today's race. Dale Earnhardt Jr. qualified fifth to put the four Hendrick drivers in the first three rows at the 2.66-mile supserpseedway.\nGordon and Earnnhardt are the only Hendrick drivers still in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship field. Both need strong runs - Earnhardt may actually need a victory - to advance into the third round of the playoffs.\nFour drivers will be cut from the Chase field following the race. Gordon is seventh in the standings, while Earnhardt is 11th in the 12-driver field. Both are six-time winners at Talladega, and Earnhardt won the spring race here.\n\"It is good enough,\" Earnhardt said about his starting position. \"Some of the guys had a little more speed, but we feel like our car is going to race really well and just ready to go.\"\nMatt Kenseth, who is last in the Chase field, qualified fourth.\nNASCAR threw out Chase driver Martin Truex Jr.'s time as penalty for driving below the yellow line on the race track during his qualifying lap.\nHe'll start last in the 43-car field, but wasn't worried.\n\"We started in the back last time, too. We'll be fine,\" Truex said of the spring race in which he started 36th but finished fifth.\nThere was a bizarre mishap on pit road when NASCAR gave Clint Bowyer the signal to begin his lap. He revved his engine and unbeknownst to him, his car was in reverse and backed hard into Justin Allgaier's car.\nAllgaier's car suffered enough damage that his crew had to make quick repairs to get him on track for his qualifying attempt, but will need to work on the Chevrolet some more to get it fixed to race Sunday.\nBowyer said it was the \"strangest\" thing he'd ever been part of in racing, and felt terrible for Allgaier and HScott Motorsports, the team Bowyer will drive for next season.\n\"Obviously it was in reverse,\" Bowyer said. \"As soon as I let the clutch out, it was going the wrong way. I feel really, really bad. This is supposed to be an uneventful day, I just made it eventful.\"\nGordon, meanwhile, continued his domination in qualifying at restrictor-plate races this season. He won the pole at three of the four plate races this year. The one miss? At Daytona in July, when qualifying was rained out.\n\"Everybody is contributing to make this happen, that is why we are 1-2-3 and 5,\" he said.\n\"It's a great day for Hendrick Motorsports.\"\nAlthough he's been very good over the course of his career at Daytona and Talladega, he doesn't enjoy the white-knuckle racing that often leads to multi-car accidents.\nNASCAR this week said it will make only one attempt at a green-white-checkered flag finish in an effort to maintain safety standards during the frantic push to the checkered flag.\n[X] Click a thumbnail to view the full-size image.
