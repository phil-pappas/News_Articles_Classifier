By Jack WalkerVan Alstyne Leader \nHOWE — The Howe Bulldogs all but clinched a playoff berth with a 28-0 win over S&S in a weather-shortened District 5-3A (II) contest at Bulldog Stadium on Friday night. \nHowe (7-1, 3-0) scored in each period while the defense put together its fourth shutout of the season. S&S (3-5, 2-1) was held to just 56 yards as the two teams battled between the 20-yard lines for much of the game and combined for just one passing yard. \nThe Bulldogs can officially clinch their playoff berth with a victory against Whitewright this week. \nHowe scored a pair of touchdowns in a three-minute stretch at the end of the third quarter and early in the fourth before lightning caused the first 30-minute weather delay with just over seven minutes left in the game. Officials called off the remaining time after a second strike would have extended the delay. \nThe two teams traded possessions in the first minutes of the game as neither could find traction on the slow track. \nLate in the first quarter Howe took over at its own 24-yard line after a missed field goal attempt by the Rams. Six plays into the drive, quarterback Brandon Wall found a seam up the middle and raced 55 yards for the Bulldogs first score. Wall finished with 115 yards on eight carries. \nPenalties, punts and fumbles ate up most of the early minutes of the second quarter with the Rams offense stalled by a pair of defensive plays by Ty Portman. \nTaking over at their own 48-yard line, the Bulldogs had Tyler Grisham busted loose on a 43-yard scamper before he was chased down at the Rams nine. Grisham scored from three yards out and the Bulldogs led, 14-0, at the half. \nHowe held the Rams to just three first downs, the final coming on a drive that reached the Howe 38-yard line before running out of steam. Cameron Prewitt led S&S with 48 yards on 10 carries. \nIt took Howe just four plays to cover the 62 yards to the end zone, the final 34 coming on a run by Brent Masters. \nHowe recovered an S&S fumble on the ensuing kickoff and Grisham capped a 45-yard drive with a six-yard touchdown run with 10:36 left in the contest. \nThree minutes later, just after Wall had gained 18 yards to put the ball at the S&S 37-yard line, officials stopped the game. \nFans were moved out of the stands and about 40 minutes later, further play was canceled.
