It came after an initial ruling to release the athlete in August was canceled at the last minute after intervention by the justice minister. \nThis time, the board \"approved the placement of offender Oscar Pistorius under correctional supervision as from 20 October 2015,\" the corrections department said in a statement following the meeting of the parole board earlier Thursday. \nPistorius was acquitted of murder last year for the shooting death of Reeva Steenkamp, but prosecutors have appealed that trial verdict and will seek a murder conviction again at South Africa's Supreme Court on Nov. 3. \nThe appeal will come just two weeks after Pistorius is freed next Tuesday. If Pistorius is convicted of murder by a panel of five judges at the appeal, he faces going back to prison for 15 years, the minimum sentence for murder in South Africa, which no longer has the death penalty. \nThe Steenkamp family lawyer didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. Steenkamp's father, Barry Steenkamp, told The Associated Press last week that he wanted the delays and uncertainty around Pistorius' release to end. \n\"I'm sure a lot of people have had enough of the whole scenario. That's all I can say. Let justice take its course,\" he said. \nThe spokeswoman for Pistorius' family, Anneliese Burgess, said in a text message to the AP that they had been informed of the decision to release Pistorius but would not be commenting further. \nPistorius was sentenced to five years after being convicted of culpable homicide, a charge comparable to manslaughter, for shooting Steenkamp, a model and reality TV star. Under South African law, an offender sentenced to five years or less in jail can be released after serving one-sixth - in Pistorius' case 10 months. \nHe has maintained he thought Steenkamp was an intruder in his Pretoria home and killed her by mistake. Prosecutors said he shot her intentionally during an argument after she had fled to a bathroom stall. \nPistorius will now be moved to correctional supervision, a form of house arrest, where he will have to live under certain conditions for the next four years. His sentence ends on Oct. 20, 2019. \nPistorius has been informed of those conditions, the corrections department said, although it did not detail them all. It did say that Pistorius would have to continue receiving psychotherapy while under house arrest and would not be allowed to handle any firearms. \nCorrectional services department spokesman Manelisi Wolela did not rule out ultimately allowing Pistorius to return to training. He also said Pistorius would not be required to wear an electronic tagging device. \nPistorius, known as \"Blade Runner\" for his carbon-fiber running blades, gained worldwide fame when he ran against able-bodied athletes at the 2012 London Olympics, the first amputee runner to compete at the games. \nIn June, the same parole board cleared Pistorius to be released from Kgosi Mampuru II Prison in Pretoria on Aug. 21 only for that decision to be suspended by the minister of justice, who ordered a review. \nThe 28-year-old Pistorius is expected to serve his house arrest at his uncle's mansion in an upmarket suburb of Pretoria.
