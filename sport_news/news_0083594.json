The Lady Miners ended the NAL season a perfect 12-0 and earned the league title and a berth in the Northern Section D2 team playoffs for the 2nd straight year. Last season, Yreka made it to the section finals and were 10-2 in NAL play. Yreka head coach Steve Pyles said that it is a”fantastic feeling” to see his squad have a perfect record in NAL play. “I have kids playing out here with passion,” he said. “They work hard and have the right attitude.” The Lady Miners will next compete at the NAL singles and doubles championships on Friday and Saturday in the Redding, Calif., area. Pyles said he believes that the LadyMiners will receive the top seed in doubles and should have three players, Melanie Gould, Mary Longworth, and Megan Almanza seeded in the top seven in the NAL singles championships. Pyles said that the team should be the No. 1 or No. 2 seed in the Northern Section D2 playoffs. Playoff matches begin nextTuesday, although Pyles said Yreka would have a bye if they earn one of the top two seeds. The semifinal matches will be held on Oct. 28, and the title game is set for Nov. 5. On Tuesday, No. 5 singles seed Tara Lipke and No. 6 singles seed Kassy Fitzpatrick both won for Yreka, as they both ended the NAL regular season with perfect records. Pyles said he expects at least a few Yreka players will earn berths in the Northern Section singles and doubles finals onOct. 31 and Nov. 1st at Foothill High School inPalo Cedro,Calif. Pyles said if the team make it to the Northern Section D2 title game, the section finals would be a perfect event to get those that participate ready for the tough competition they will face in a section title game.
