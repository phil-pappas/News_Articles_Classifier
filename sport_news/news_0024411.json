He makes some plays in practice that grab your attention and I think we’re coming along at the wide receiver position.”\nWalker has amassed 155 yards on five returns for a 31-yard average, which is third in the ACC behind Louisville’s Traveon Samuel and Kermit Whitfield of Florida State. Willis is expected to resume his duties as a rotating tailback against Clemson but won’t be involved in the return game.\n“The big question is whether we want to expose Willis back to those high velocity explosive hits right away,” said Addazio. “But I love Myles and Walker as a return duo.”\nWalker returned kicks, punts and played in the secondary at Naples High School in Naples, Fla., in addition to running the Golden Eagles veer offense. The veer triple option scheme exposed Walker to the kind of violent hits he takes on the suicide squad.\nWillis was a quarterback at Marist High School in Atlanta., but didn’t partake in specials teams until he came to The Heights.\n“I worked on it a bit in training camp and when Myles got hurt I found my niche,” Walker said. “The coaches tell me just try and get vertical and as long as you get vertical you’ll find a hole if you run 100 miles an hour. But my success is totally about other players doing their jobs.”\nWalker speaks with an easy south Florida accent but his athletic roots are in Connecticut. Walker’s uncle, Pete Walker, played baseball at UConn before spending eight seasons in the major leagues. He is currently the Toronto Blue Jays’ pitching coach.\nWalker’s father, Mike, played football at UConn from 1979-82 while another uncle, Andrew Walker, played baseball for the Huskies.\n“I grew up an athletic family with my dad and all of his brothers playing Division 1 sports,” he said.\nWalker believes his time spent playing quarterback and defensive back in high school has provided a unique perspective for running pass routes in college.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:27:41.502+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
