We got the reports (from drivers), and we looked everywhere, including putting people on the ground and walking. There was no oil.”\nSeveral cars hit the wall after Allgaier’s incident. Kyle Busch also complained after the race about the track’s condition.\nEarnhardt wasn’t angry after the race, but he was animated and outspoken in discussing the incident with reporters.\n“We all hit the wall,” he said. “I hit the wall. The 2 (Brad Keselowski) hit the wall. Then we ran another lap. I pitted. Then a bunch of other guys hit the wall.\n“There was oil down there. It wasn’t speedy-dry (absorbent material placed on the track to speed drying of fluids). I mean, I’ve raced this (expletive) for 20 years. I know what oil and speedy-dry are. We hit fluid and flew into the freaking wall hard.\n\"That’s not speedy-dry. There was oil up there. There were shadows cast by the billboards across the track. That may have made it difficult for them to see some oil.”\nAsked what NASCAR could have done differently, Earnhardt said, “You’ve got to get out there maybe and feel around and get your hands on the track. Man, guys hit the fence. What do you want me to do? I hit the (expletive) wall. I know I hit oil. I hit it, I promise. I’ll argue with them all day long because I know I’m right.”\nBuck said track crews handled the situation as they do every week.\n“We do everything we can to bring the surface back to raceable condition, and I think we’ve got an excellent record of that,” he said. “We feel absolutely confident there was no oil up in that very top groove or down below or anywhere else.”\nEarnhardt's finish leaves him with a high wall to climb to advance to the Chase’s third round. Races remain at Kansas Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway in round two. Earnhardt won at Talladega in May, his sixth victory at NASCAR’s biggest track.\n“I don’t have to be worried like a lot of guys,” Earnhardt said. “A lot of guys are going to go in there in pretty good position or just ahead of the bubble (the cutoff point). They’ll be nervous. We don’t have to be nervous. We’re on the outside looking in. We can be more aggressive. I’m looking forward to Talladega even more now.\n“Now I don’t have to worry about skinning the side off the car and knocking us out of the Chase. We’re out of it. Now it’s our turn to claw back in, and we’ll try.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:58:18.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
