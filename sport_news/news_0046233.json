On a fourth-and-8 from its own 27-yard line, coach Kyle Flood got gutsy and called for a fake punt. Up-back Sam Bergen took the snap and rumbled around the edge for a 15-yard gain. It was the first career carry for the sixth-year senior blocking fullback. One play later, quarterback Chris Laviano threw a screen pass to wide receiver Leonte Carroo, who raced 58 yards for a momentum-shifting touchdown. \nWORST PLAY \nRutgers had just scored 25 unanswered points to tie the score at 52-52 with 6 minutes, 29 seconds remaining and only needed to convert the point-after try to take the lead. But Kyle Federico's point-after try was blocked. For the second time in the game. The rush came right up the middle so maybe it was the protection's fault. Or maybe the inconsistent Federico needed to kick the ball higher. In total, Rutgers left four points on the field, as it came up short on two two-point conversion attempts. Rutgers is supposed to excel on special teams, and did with a fake punt and a special teams touchdown. But this one hurt. \nTURNING POINT \nAny of the four consecutive defensive stops that Rutgers made after surrendering 52 points through the first 2 1/2 quarters. Rutgers forced two punts -- only one got off as the other was a bad snap that led to a touchdown -- and got two interceptions from Isaiah Wharton and Anthony Cioffi. It set the table for 28 unanswered points in 18 minutes and the most improbable win in school history. \nTHUMBS UP \nMartin broke out some of his best moves – a shimmy, a cutback, a stiff-arm – and rushed his way to ??? yards and ?? touchdowns. He had three scores against Indiana last year. … Quanzell Lambert and Anthony Cioffi made fourth-down tackles. Lambert came around the edge on a fourth-and-1 run and Cioffi got a sack on a blitz. … Carroo made three catches on the opening drive, giving him 100 for his career. It was his 10th career multi-touchdown game and fifth career three-touchdown game. … Linebacker Steve Longa had ?? tackles, including 10 in the first half despite playing hobbled. … Defensive end Kemoko Turay scored his first career touchdown, scooping up loose ball after a bad snap on a punt and racing 26 yards for a touchdown. ... Cornerback Isaiah Wharton made his first career interception. \nTHUMBS DOWN \nThe usual suspects whenever Rutgers faces a spread offense: Poor open-field tackling, a lack of a pass rush and cornerbacks running a step behind receivers. … Rutgers was in control of momentum when Laviano short-armed a fourth-down pass that fell at the feet of Justin Goodwin beyond the chains. … Turay, a pass-rush specialist, failed to wrap up Sudfeld for a sack and the quarterback hit a 33-yard pass to a wide open receiver. One play later, Indiana scored a 2-yard touchdown to pull ahead 10-7. …Rutgers went 0-for-2 on two-point conversion attempts, with Josh HIcks getting stuffed from the 1-yard line and Laviano taking a sack on the other. ... Laviano threw a back-foot interception on a poor decision seen plenty this season. \nNEXT UP \nRutgers hosts defending national champion and top-ranked Ohio State at 8 p.m. Saturday at High Point Solutions Stadium. 1 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LB8eY5 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:52:02.370+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
