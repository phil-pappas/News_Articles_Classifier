Arlington and Platteview clash again in NCC semis Tyler Dahlgren Buy Now Tyler Dahlgren \nArlington sophomore Madison Baumert had 19 kills in the Eagles' 3-2 loss to Class B No. 10 Platteview in the NCC semifinals at AHS on Thursday night. \nArlington had Platteview on the ropes again in front of a spirited Thursday night home crowd in the semifinals of the Nebraska Capitol Conference tournament. \nAnd again, like they had done two out of the three previous meetings this season, the Class B No. 10 Trojans backed their way out of that corner, rallying off three straight wins to take the match and advance to the conference championship game. \nIn what is shaping up to be quite an exciting rivalry, the Eagles and Trojans traded blows on Thursday night in the form of powerful kills, smooth passing and nifty finesse shots. Arlington, one of only three teams to defeat Platteview this fall, stormed to a 2-0 win after two dominant sets (25-12 and 25-19) to open the match. \nIn the second set, the Eagles trailed by four points before sophomore Madison Baumert, who had a big night all around, ripped off three straight kills to turn the tide in the home team's favor. Arlington didn't look back, coasting to the six-point win. \nThe third set was another back-and-forth affair, with Platteview making a late run to stave off elimination 25-21. The Eagles seemed to run out of steam from there, as the Trojans powered their way to their 21 st win of the season. \n“ We played two sets of great volleyball,” head coach Brandon Mues said. “We lost a close third set and couldn't find the momentum to close them out.” \nThe Eagles' effort wasn't questioned by their coach, or the huge crowd, which was treated to an hour and a half of exciting action. \n“ The girls played hard and with solidarity,” Mues said. “We need to develop more depth and find a couple of players to come off the bench and step up for us down the stretch.” \nFinding extra depth might be the final piece to the puzzle for the Eagles, winners of nine straight matches before Thursday night. In those nine wins, which bolstered the Eagles' season record to 15-6, opponents took just three sets from Arlington. \nPlatteview took the fourth set 25-22 and cruised to a 15-7 victory in the decisive fifth set. \nBaumert finished with a stat-stuffing performance that included 19 kills, three assists and 13 digs. Sophomore Shelby Kaup had 12 kills and four blocks, and senior Mariah Kaup added 10. Sophomore Grace Volk finished with four. \nArlington, entering the home stretch of the season, will host Syracuse on Tuesday night. \nClass B No. 10 Platteview 3 Arlington 2 \nPlatteview (21-3) 12 19 25 25 15 3 \nArlington (15-7) 25 25 21 22 7 ×", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T19:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:47:08.548+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
