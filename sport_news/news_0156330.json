It was really nice to get in there.”\nWolf, 39, might have thrown the final pitch of a 16-year career in the scoreless sixth inning, and if he did, the left-hander threw it in relief of a youngster, Daniel Norris, he has mentored this season with the Blue Jays and Tigers.\n“Daniel’s my guy, obviously,” Wolf said. “I’ve been a bad influence on him for about a year now, and it was nice to go out there and for Brad to get me in.”\nWolf and Norris, 22, became close while pitching with Triple-A Buffalo this season.\nWolf signed with the Blue Jays on March 18 but was in the minor leagues all season until he was traded to the Tigers for cash Aug. 18.\nHe posted a 6.23 ERA in eight appearances — seven starts — this season.\nWolf is 133-125 with a 4.24 ERA with the Phillies, Dodgers, Padres, Astros, Brewers, Orioles, Marlins and Tigers.\n“Maybe he’ll play again,” Ausmus said. “But if not, at least he had a good inning his last inning.”\nContact Anthony Fenech: afenech@freepress.com.
