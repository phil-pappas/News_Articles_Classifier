It also might be the kind of game that makes or breaks RCC’s season, depending on how the team responds next week.\n“A complete breakdown in every area,” Tigers’ coach Tom Craft said. “I’m really disappointed in our team, our composure, coaching staff and everything. We need to get a lot of things fixed right now.”\nThe Tigers’ running game, which was dominant in last week’s win over El Camino, was slowed by the loss of leading rusher Chris Anderson, who is day-to-day with a knee injury, Craft said. The Hornets unleashed their own running game and eventually beat RCC at its own game, with 303 yards rushing and three touchdowns.\nPenalties (18 for 184 yards) continued to hurt RCC, and the Hornets controlled the clock and dominated possession. The Tigers couldn’t mount drives and the defense looked tired as Fullerton jumped out to a 38-14 lead at the half.\n“Everything went wrong for us,” linebacker AJ Hotchkins said. “It started in practice. … We have to turn our season around right now and have some leaders step up.”\nThe Tigers hadn’t given up more than 29 points in a game this season, and were among SoCal leaders at 20.5 points per game. They also surrendered just 88.8 rushing yards per game, but the script was flipped on Saturday, especially in the first half.\nFullerton beat the Tigers twice in 2013, including in the SoCal title game. The Hornets won the National Southern League last season, but were just 2-3 this season and had lost two straight.\nThe bad news for RCC is that the 52 points was the most given up since a 51-50 win over Citrus in 2013. The Tigers lost to Cerritos 58-17 in 2009.\nThe good news for RCC is that as bad as the team played, there is precedent for a comeback. Last season an undefeated Tiger squad was beaten by an undermanned Grossmont team 38-28. The score didn’t tell the whole story as the Tigers fell behind 35-7 and struggled in all facets of the game.\nCraft described it the worst game in his tenure at RCC, but the team was resilient enough to win the next eight games and advance to the Southern California championship game.\nSeth Acda ran for 127 yards, including a 65-yard touchdown, and Dontel James added 107 yards. Kevin Olsen passed for 102 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions.\nPhillip Butler topped Fullerton with 218 yards and two touchdowns.\nRCC is back home next Saturday when it hosts LA Harbor.\nContact the writer: asteele@pe.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:34:15.995+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
