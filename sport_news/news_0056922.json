Ohio State won, 38-10.(Adam Cairns/TNS) By RYAN LEWISAkron Beacon Journal, (TNS) \nCOLUMBUS, Ohio — Ohio State coach Urban Meyer on Tuesday announced that J.T. Barrett would be supplanting Cardale Jones as the Buckeyes’ starting quarterback in the Buckeyes’ upcoming game against Rutgers. \nBarrett took over the starting job last year after Braxton Miller needed shoulder surgery and responded well, throwing for 2,834 yards and 34 touchdowns to go with 938 yards and 11 touchdowns on the ground. His season was cut short, though, due to a broken ankle against he sustained against Michigan. \nJones, a preseason third-string quarterback, then took over and had one of the better three-game stretches in recent memory, leading the Buckeyes to a national championship. Jones hasn’t been as sharp in 2015, throwing for 1,242 yards, seven touchdowns and five interceptions in seven games. \nBarrett has now overtaken Jones to reclaim the job. His re-emergence as the starting quarterback started two weeks ago against Maryland, when Meyer’s plan to have Barrett take control of the offense was unveiled. Last week against Penn State, Barrett got his foot in the door to a greater extent and led the offense full-time starting late in the third quarter. \nWith Barrett under center, Ohio State has turned its red-zone offense from a weakness into a strength. The Buckeyes started the season 6-of-16 converting red zone trips into touchdowns but with Barrett the past two weeks, they are 11-of-12 and have scored on every trip. Barrett is 27-of-44 passing for 249 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions and has 228 yards and five touchdowns rushing. \nMeyer said Monday that he had an idea of who would be the starting quarterback this Saturday against Rutgers, but that he hadn’t met with each candidate yet. He also mentioned that Barrett might have had a chance to overtake Jones for the job several weeks ago but failed to do so. \n“[Barrett] certainly had an opportunity earlier in the year and did not do it,” Meyer said. “Same thing with training camp.” \nBarrett’s Ohio State career, from setting Big Ten records in 2014 to a broken ankle to watching the national title run on the sideline, has now begun another chapter. \nWhile Barrett and Jones have sparred for the starting quarterback job, Miller has continued his transition to wide receiver/offensive weapon and is now starting to gain some consistent traction in the offensive game plan. \nAgainst Penn State, Miller was the leading receiver with four catches, 33 yards and a touchdown. He also gained 30 yards on the ground on four carries. Against Maryland a week earlier, Miller had his best game since the season opener against Virginia Tech with five catches, 79 yards and a touchdown. \nMiller is one of the more dangerous playmakers in the country but had a quiet season until recently adjusting to his new position. But it isn’t always easy to manufacture his number of touches in the offense. Sometimes, Meyer doesn’t want to simply follow the scheme. The ball needs to be in Miller’s hands. \n“We have a big belief that scheme isn’t what wins games,” Meyer said. “That’s very important. That’s not what wins. What wins are the dynamic players that touch the ball. … Braxton Miller had two plays [Saturday] that weren’t exactly to the script, but he’s a monster. So we have to make sure monsters, freaks touch the ball.” \nGoing forward, it appears as though Barrett has the chance to start the rest of the season and Miller has a chance to continue to make more of an offensive impact.
