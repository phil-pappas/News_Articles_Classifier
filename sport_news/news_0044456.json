The Patriots have a Thursday night game against Jesuit followed by recent giant-beaters St. Augustine. 4 2 Brother Martin After garnering first place votes for their three-point win over Curtis, the Crusaders were on the wrong end of a three-point deficit as St. Aug. QB Justice McCoy tallied six touchdowns and nearly 600 yards of offense. They'll travel to Sulphur to try to get back in the win column. 5 6 McDonogh 35 The Roneagles survived their toughest challenge yet against previously-undefeated Carver, winning 27-20, thanks to 14 unanswered points. Thursday nights with Mac 35 continue as Belle Chasse visits Pan-Am Stadium. 6 NR Mandeville The Skippers are back in the rankings after a dramatic win over previously fifth-ranked Ponchatoula. Mandeville's Orgeron twins connected on a botched field goal attempt to end the Green Wave's 15-game regular season winning streak. 7 7 De La Salle Cavalier country is getting excited as DLS' undefeated run continues after a 48-0 dismantling of McMain. Up next, KIPP Renaissance on Friday. 8 NR Holy Cross Our first debutant in a couple weeks, Holy Cross' double overtime win over Jesuit was heavy on drama and defense with the Tigers ultimately stopping the powerful Jays running attack on the goal line. We'll find out even more about Holy Cross when they face #1 Rummel Friday.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
