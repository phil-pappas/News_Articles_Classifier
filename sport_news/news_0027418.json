Or maybe they are just too good to care.\nJake Arrieta allowed four hits in nine dominant innings and the Cubs rolled to a 4-0 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the National League baseball wild-card game Wednesday night.\nArrieta struck out 11 without a walk and the Cubs advanced to a best-of-five NL Division Series against the Cardinals that starts Friday in St. Louis. The Cardinals had an 11-8 advantage in their season series.\n“I’m exhausted. I haven’t felt this way all year,” said Arrieta, who led the major leagues with 22 victories this year. “This atmosphere, the energy was unbelievable. Tried to use it to the best of my ability. They were loud, they were really loud.”\nMost Read Stories National media reacts to controversial call on Kam Chancellor Kam Chancellor’s forced fumble and K.J.

Dexter Fowler homered and scored three times for the Cubs. Kyle Schwarber added a towering two-run shot off Pittsburgh starter Gerrit Cole as Chicago raced to an early lead and let Arrieta do the rest.\nThe PNC Park-record crowd of 40,889 failed to rattle Arrieta or one of baseball’s youngest teams. \nJoe Maddon, a former Tampa Bay manager in his first season with the Cubs, guided a team that looked right at home while snapping a nine-game playoff losing streak that dated to the 2003 NL Championship Series.\n“It’s tremendous for the city. It’s been awhile,” Arrieta said. “Chicago’s been waiting for this, but it’s only step one.”\nPittsburgh was knocked out after finishing second in the majors with 98 victories this year. Last season, the Pirates also were shut out on four hits at home in the wild-card game, losing to San Francisco and pitcher Madison Bumgarner.\n“Well, sports is hard. Life’s not fair. You go out and play. You get beat, you move on,” Pirates manager Clint Hurdle said.\nThe bearded, 29-year-old Arrieta, unbeaten since July 25, stretched his remarkable second half — in which he posted an 0.75 ERA — into the opening round of the postseason. He laughed off a sequence in the seventh when Tony Watson’s fastball hit him in his left side. The benches and bullpens cleared when Watson was issued a warning, leading to a few heated exchanges along the first-base line.\nSeattle Times staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:20:21.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
