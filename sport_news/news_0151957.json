Woods took the ball and ran 70 yards down the LHS sideline for a touchdown, starting a huge day for Woods in a 42-6 blowout victory at LHS in the school’s homecoming game. \nWoods, the electric 5-foot-7, 180-pounder, finished with 257 yards and four touchdowns on 12 carries, averaging 21.4 yards every time he touched the ball. It’s the second time this season he’s run for a long touchdown on the game’s first play. \n“JD is one of a kind,” senior lineman Trey Georgie said. “He is so fast and explosive. When we saw him running down the sideline, we knew he was going to score.” \nOn Lawrence’s second possession, Woods finished a seven-play, 50-yard drive with a seven-yard touchdown run. He added a 37-yard touchdown run in the second quarter and ran for a 91-yard touchdown in the third quarter, sprung by a big kick-out block from senior Peter Afful.

I credit them and our coaches for getting that play set up like that.” \nWoods ran a 100-meter dash in 10.73 seconds during track last spring, the third-fastest time in the state. Once he breaks into open field, he speeds past the defense and celebrates with a salute once he’s in the end zone. \n“The thing about 10.7 — that’s track speed, but he’s fast football speed,” Wedd said. “Some track guys when they put the pads on, they slow down. He frickin’ speeds up. He’s a true burner.” \nWith Woods providing the highlights on offense, the LHS defense dominated with its linemen and linebackers. The Lions, who had a big size advantage on both sides of the line, allowed only 18 total yards in the first half with plenty of tackles in the backfield. \nIn the first half, seniors Price Morgan, Nate Koehn, Amani Bledsoe and junior Jake Unruh all recorded sacks. Senior linebackers Konner Kelley and Tanner Green, Bledsoe, Georgie and junior safety Santino Gee added tackles in the backfield on run plays. \n“Just played football,” Kelley summed up. “Just have to be mean. Everyone did their job and we succeeded obviously.” \nIn the third quarter, the Raiders (0-5) had two drives near midfield, but both stalled when Lawrence’s linebackers and defensive backs made tackles in the backfield. Senior cornerback J’Mony Bryant had two stops when SM South tried to run option plays. \n“The coaches are setting us up to succeed,” Kelley said. “Just the backers — we call ourselves “The Reapers” — we have to buy in and it’ll pay off.” \nThe Lions (5-0) — off to their best start to a season since 2005 — put all of their backups on the field for the fourth quarter. Junior running back James Reeder ran for a five-yard touchdown in the middle of the quarter and SM South senior running back Kyhiem Matthews sprinted for a 58-yard touchdown on the game’s final play. \nThe final play took away a shutout from the Lions, but couldn’t touch their confidence. \n“Once (we get) that first score of the game, we find our rhythm,” Kelley said. “We just keep kicking. We’re like a train that don’t stop.” \nLHS SMS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:58:34.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
