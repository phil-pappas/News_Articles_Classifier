Our defense played well.” \nHe wrenched the ball from Athens Academy on the opening kickoff to set up Jared Pringle’s 23-yard field goal. He intercepted a pass from Drew Richardson in the second quarter that led to a 75-yard scoring burst from Kevon Hudson. \nAnd he didn’t slow down in the second half. A 43-yard punt return resulted in a 6-yard scoring push from Jordan Ginnel. A 25-yard run on 3rd-and-5 nearly four minutes later led to Andrew Hayes’ short scoring burst. \nHe got a score of his own in the fourth quarter. Less than 20 seconds after Hudson punched in a 13-yard touchdown, Hightower picked off a pass from Richardson and returned it 40 yards for the score. \n“I just saw the guy come out, jumped the route and took it to the house,” Hightower said. \nHudson went on to add a 35-yard touchdown and finished with three scores. \nPrince Avenue had a 10-0 lead at halftime. Richardson completed a 66-yard pass to Ed Ferguson to give Athens Academy its first score of the night in the third quarter. He connected with Jacob Hudson on a 13-yard scoring pass in the fourth quarter. \n“The biggest part of it was Athens Academy was ready to play,” Herron said. “They’re extremely well-coached and they came out here and gave us all we wanted in the first half. But that was good for us. We needed that challenge and halftime we talked about just go be us and see what happens and they responded well.” \nPrince Avenue will host Towns County at 7:30 p.m. Friday. Athens Academy will host Lakeview Academy. \nOnlineAthens.com aims to foster constructive, respectful civic conversation.
