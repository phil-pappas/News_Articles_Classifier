That streak was all but officially over after two quarters. \nUtah State upset their Mountain West Conference rival 52-26 thanks to seven first-half turnovers, including a 90-yard interception return by Marwin Evans as time expired in the half. The Aggies scored 21 points in the final 85 seconds of the first half thanks to two fumbles and the interception. \nThe 52 points are the most Boise State has ever allowed as a ranked team. \nUtah State (4-2, 3-0) holds onto a share of first place in the Mountain Division with the win. Boise State (5-2, 2-1) falls out of first with its first conference loss of the season. Air Force (3-2, 2-0) is at Colorado State (2-4, 0-2) on Saturday. \nThe Broncos served up four fumbles and three interceptions in the first half, including Evans' score at the end of the half. \nThe Aggies defense ruled the day with a historic effort. The seven turnovers were the most since forcing that many against Arkansas State in 2003 — and that was just the first half. \nBoise State receiver Thomas Sperbeck fumbled the ball away on the second snap of the second half. \nBoise State coach Bryan Harsin called Utah State's Kyler Fackrell one of the best in the country this week and the senior linebacker didn't disappoint. He finished with 11 tackles, 2.5 for loss. He also forced a fumble and recovered two. Fellow linebacker Nick Vigil had a game-high 14 tackles, nine in the first half, two sacks, a forced fumble and a fumble recovery. \nJalen Davis, Torrey Green and Evans all picked off Boise State quarterback Brett Rypien in the first half. \nThe Broncos had 10 first downs and the seven turnovers in the first half and allowed 35 points off those turnovers. The Boise State offensive line was simply overwhelmed in the first 30 minutes and Rypien was under regularly pressure. \nUtah State's Kent Meyers threw for 157 yards and a career-high three touchdowns and added 63 yards rushing and a touchdown. Hunter Sharp caught two touchdown passes. \nRypien threw for 299 yards with three interceptions. He entered the game with one interception in four games. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:40:19.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
