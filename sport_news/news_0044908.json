Comment By Lenny Megliola/Special to the News Milford Daily News By Lenny Megliola/Special to the News Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 9:00 PM By Lenny Megliola/Special to the News Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 9:00 PM Stanley Alves’ parents and older brother were born in Brazil, where the passion for soccer knows no limits. Stanley was born stateside, outside Boston. “My mother told me soccer was a Brazilian heritage,” said Alves. He picked up on that early, when his brother Stefano took up the sport. “Once I saw him play, I fell in love with soccer. He inspired me to play.” When the family lived in Newton before moving to Framingham a few years ago, Alves didn’t have to look long or hard for a soccer scrum. He had a friend — Mike Soboss — who lived in Framingham. Soboss, who played at Brandeis, showed Alves where to find the action, at the fields off Route 9 where peladas — games played on smaller fields — took place. “The peladas were really competitive,” said Alves. “Sometimes we’d dominate games and the other team would start kicking up. They were only pick-up games, but they were hard-hitting.” Alves moved from Newton to downtown Framingham with his parents. “It was cheaper,” he said. He commutes to Dean College in Franklin where he’s building a solid soccer reputation, one that may land him a Division I scholarship. He’s scored 15 goals in 10 games, all wins. The rush of success has elevated the Bulldogs to a No. 18 ranking (Div. I, Region 21, National Junior College Athletic Association). “He’s one of our hardest-working guys,” said Dean head coach Ruben Resendes. The coach and the player share a history. Both are new arrivals to the Dean campus. Resendes was an assistant coach at Southern New Hampshire but left to take the head coaching position at Dean. “I got the job in January,” he said. “The team only returned six players. We needed to get some players.” Alves had been at Southern New Hampshire with Resendes. “I knew he wasn’t happy there,” said Resendes. “I was doing really good in preseason and was hoping to play,” said Alves. But there was a problem with one of the courses he took at Newton North High that was taking time to resolve. “It was frustrating and annoying,” he said. Meanwhile, the season was flying by and Alves hadn’t seen any action. It ended up that Alves took a redshirt year. He ultimately transferred to Dean, after discussing it with Resendes. “He wanted to play Division I, but there was no film on him,” said Resendes. “So he came here.” There’s film galore on Alves now. Page 2 of 2 - Resendes recalled Alves as “a quiet, modest kid.” He wanted Alves, arguably his best player, to be more of a leader. They discussed it. “Now he’s talking a lot on the field,” said Resendes. “Before, he expressed himself with his skill. He has good technique, he’s good with his feet. The sky’s the limit for him.” Alves began playing soccer as a fifth-grader. “I watched my brother play with a club team. I watched him scoring goals. It was pretty awesome. I asked my mother (Rosilene) if I could play. She said OK.” Brazilian tradition, you know. “The goal is just to play this year at Dean and hopefully go to Division I,” said Alves. He’d had UMass-Amherst and Rhode Island in sight. “But it was too expensive,” he said. Recently, UMass-Lowell and Providence have shown interest in the 19-year-old. Alves is a non-denominational Christian who attends campus ministry services three times a week in downtown Framingham, next to the town hall. There, he bonded with older students from Framingham State University, Wellesley College, and Bentley. “It’s the biggest part of my life. Everything (I do) is based on Christianity.” And for kicks, well, he scores goals. Lenny Megliola can be reached at lennymegs@aol.com. Follow him on Twitter @lennymegs.
