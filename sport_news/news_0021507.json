He was in line to claim around $7,000 in prize money before being caught out and disqualified.\nOfficials said they became suspicious because Njogu showed no signs of fatigue and was not sweating when he had supposedly just run 42 kilometers (26 miles). They discovered that he'd run barely one kilometer after emerging from a bunch of onlookers and joining the leading group of runners just outside the stadium.\nThrough the final few meters, Njogu jogged easily past a weary-looking Shadrack Kiptoo to cross second. Joshua Kipkorir won the men's race in two hours, 13 minutes and 25 seconds. Elizabeth Rumokoi won the women's title in 2:29.32.\nTelevision images showed Njogu arguing with race officials, and even removing his running shoes in an apparent attempt to show organizers blisters on his feet to prove he'd run the entire course.\n\"I followed the leading team from start to finish and I didn't see him,\" said race director Ibrahim Hussein, a former Boston and New York Marathon champion. \"He will not be recognized and I'm so disappointed that one can cheat in this modern age. He didn't finish second.\"\nIn 2013, two athletes were disqualified at the Nairobi marathon after also attempting to cheat their way to podium finishes in the women's race.", "external_links": ["http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url=", "https://twitter.com/share?text=Man+arrested+after+cheating+his+way+to+2nd+in+Kenya+marathon"], "published": "2015-10-26T16:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:45:57.633+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
