Penn State to study improvement plans \nSTATE COLLEGE — How much are history and tradition worth? It's a question Penn State Athletic Director Sandy Barbour will soon answer about the school's football stadium. \nUniversity officials are seeking options to renovate or replace Beaver Stadium in the next 10 years. Penn State has hired an architecture firm to recommend improvements and funding plans for its 18 athletic facilities, including the world's third-largest stadium. \n\"Nobody's trying to either renovate Beaver or build a new stadium just to be doing it,\" Barbour said. \"There's a recognized need. I've not run into anybody that doesn't recognize that need.\" \nThe 106,572-seat complex has undergone seven expansions since moving from the other side of campus in 1960. But it remains antiquated, despite additions of luxury boxes and high-definition scoreboards. \nOutdated plumbing requires complete winterization each November. Elevators are small and sluggish while concourses are narrow. The stadium lacks in concession options and still uses bleachers. The limitations prevent wider use of the venue. \nBarbour said she'd like to see concerts and other sports like hockey in the facility. \n\"Seven days a year is not probably the best use of the full utilization of that investment,\" Barbour said. \nEven if Penn State decides to renovate Beaver Stadium, the project will be expensive. Texas A&M recently reopened its Kyle Field after a $485 million renovation. \nAnd last year, Notre Dame announced a $400 million expansion of Notre Dame Stadium that will be the largest building project in school history. Notre Dame plans to add three separate buildings, totaling 750,000 square feet of space, to the stadium to expand its use. \nBeaver Stadium still has its charm, a reputation built on a game-day atmosphere touted by alumni, players and even opposing fans and recruits. Players often share vivid memories of entering the stadium and running out of the tunnel for the first time before more than 100,000 fans. \n\"That atmosphere is unreal,\" sophomore linebacker Jason Cabinda said. \"There's nothing that really compares to it in my opinion.\" \nThat's why Barbour is hoping Penn State will be able to work with what it currently has rather than build a new stadium. \n\"That would absolutely be my preference, no doubt about it, for a variety of reasons,\" Barbour said. \"Not the least of which is history and tradition.\" \nThe athletic department has begun a $12 million renovation to the Lasch Football Building, which Barbour said would be privately funded. To help with that, fans can inscribe their names on players' lockers for a $15,000 donation. \n\"When the Lasch Building was built, it was top-notch,\" Barbour said this summer. \"It was the very best in college football. But nothing was done in the intervening 15-16 years, so of course it's fallen behind. For me, it's always about conditions for success for our student-athletes.\" \nTo pay for such projects, Barbour said Penn State would have to get creative with fundraising and revenue-generation. That likely won't include ticket-price increases or alcohol sales at sporting events — at least for now. \nBarbour is asking Kansas City, Mo., architecture firm Populous to survey athletes, coaches, alumni and fans and present its findings in July. Penn State will then aggressively implement suggested upgrades, said Phil Esten, deputy athletic director. \nPenn State's athletic department reported a slight profit in the fiscal year ending June 30, 2014, up from a $6 million loss in 2013, according to a financial report submitted to the NCAA. It had $117.6 million in operating revenue in fiscal 2014. \n\"Not only do we want to know what facilities would be best for our student athletes, these need to be economically viable,\" Esten said. \"Don't show us a Cadillac if we can only afford a Chevy.\" \nBoth Esten and Barbour have led major builds and renovations on other campuses. Barbour oversaw a $321 million renovation of California's Memorial Stadium when she was athletic director there, while Esten was in charge of fundraising at Minnesota during the planning and construction of the $303 million TCF Bank Stadium. \nMorning Call sports writer Mark Wogenrich contributed to this story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:46:42.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
