(AP Photo/Rick Bowmer) Share This Article ARTICLE PHOTO GALLERY (8) Provo • Freshman quarterback Tanner Mangum directed touchdown drives on BYU's first six possessions and the Cougars routed overmatched Wagner College 70-6 on Saturday at LaVell Edwards Stadium. BYU improved to 6-2 with the win and became bowl eligible for the 11th-straight season under coach Bronco Mendenhall. As expected, the matchup was lopsided from the opening kickoff, as BYU took a 28-0 lead in the first quarter and a 49-0 advantage at halftime. Mangum completed 12 of 13 passes for 237 yards and three touchdowns and staked BYU to a 42-0 lead before being replaced by fellow freshman Beau Hoge with eight minutes remaining in the first half.
