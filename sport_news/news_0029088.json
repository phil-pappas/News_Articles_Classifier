The festival will also feature representatives from the Gifford Cat Shelter and Boston’s Forgotten Felines .\nWill Braden, creator of the popular online series Henri le Chat Noir and the festival’s first-ever winner of the Golden Kitty (People’s Choice) Award, will curate a selection of the videos for the festival. Henri le Chat Noir was so popular that it even gained the attention of renowned film critic Roger Ebert, who called Henri 2: Paw De Deux “the best Internet cat video ever made.”\nAttendees are not permitted to bring their own felines to the festival but are encouraged to dress in their favorite family-friendly cat outfits and enter the “catstume” contest. Tickets for the Internet Cat Video festival can be purchased on the Berklee Performance Center website .\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement Entertainment There’s still a chance for ‘Roadrunner’ to become our ‘State Rock Song’ 10.16.15 | 3:52 PM Entertainment The Internet Cat Video Festival returns to Boston next week 10.16.15 | 2:08 PM Music What it’s like to sell cassettes in 2015 10.16.15 | 12:24 PM Events Say goodbye to the Echelman sculpture at this closing event (for real this time) 10.15.15 | 1:28 PM Events Break out your cardigans, the Head of the Charles is here 10.15.15 | 11:32 AM Celebrity news Tom Brady is just so grateful to have his ‘Boston crew, man’ 10.15.15 | 9:02 AM Entertainment Donald Trump fires back at Steven Tyler 10.14.15 | 9:47 PM Celebrity news Steve Carell is the everyman, tells Ellen he owns a general store in Marshfield 10.14.15 | 9:56 AM News MBTA auctioning-off murals from Government Center stop 10.13.15 | 8:05 PM Celebrity news Matt Damon cannot, will not live without Ben and is also selling his L.A. home 10.13.15 | 4:23 PM Celebrity news Here’s Donnie Wahlberg living his best life on the New Kids on the Block Cruise 10.13.15 | 1:21 PM Visual arts Watch breathtaking drone footage of the Rose Kennedy Greenway sculpture like you’ve never seen it before 10.13.15 | 11:00 AM Community It appears we have a “Keytar Cub” on our hands… 10.12.15 | 2:42 PM Entertainment Watch Fenway light up like you’ve never seen it before 10.11.15 | 12:10 PM Celebrity news Defamation suit by Cosby accusers will go forward 10.09.15 | 2:52 PM Events Honor a delicious piece of our state heritage at the Cranberry Harvest Celebration 10.09.15 | 1:24 PM Entertainment Mayor Walsh honors the Godmother of Punk, declares October 10 ‘Patti Smith Day’ 10.09.15 | 12:25 PM Celebrity news See Tom and Gisele’s Brookline house just as they do from the heavens 10.09.15 | 10:26 AM Events This will be your one chance to light up the Echelman sculpture 10.09.15 | 10:01 AM Celebrity news Jason Segel tells the tale of his real-life Sarah Marshall at his Harvard Book Store event 10.08.15 | 1:37 PM Entertainment This legendary Boston band may finally earn a place in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 10.08.15 | 11:10 AM Events Here are five not-boring ways to spend Columbus Day weekend 10.08.15 | 9:46 AM Celebrity news Here’s your completely essential map of Matt Damon’s Boston 10.08.15 | 9:39 AM Performing arts Twelve Boston Ballet dancers created a stunning human sculpture 10.07.15 | 10:00 PM Celebrity news Ben and Jen’s L.A. mansion will cost you a pretty penny 10.07.15 | 1:04 PM Visual arts Why sheep are floating in the Boston Harbor 10.07.15 | 8:59 AM Celebrity news Tom and Gisele: The best/worst people to have at your wedding 10.06.15 | 4:41 PM Entertainment Go Back to the Future (II) and watch this mock trailer for Jaws 19 10.06.15 | 11:49 AM Music Kiss108’s Jingle Ball 2015 lineup: The Weeknd and a Jonas Brother are just the beginning 10.05.15 | 3:57 PM Entertainment Watch this man re-enact all of Breaking Bad as a one-hour show tomorrow in Somerville 10.05.15 | 2:25 PM", "external_links": ["https://www.berklee.edu/BPC", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/Q34z5dCmC4M", "http://www.giffordcatshelter.org/", "http://p.o0bc.com/rf/image_700w/Boston/2011-2020/2015/10/16/Boston.com/BCOM/Images/news29f1-365855-DEOQ.jpg", "http://www.youtube.com/embed/5cJqg--HcRE", "https://www.facebook.com/BostonsForgottenFelines"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:07:42.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
