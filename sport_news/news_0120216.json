As the rest of the Vikings managed just 53 rushing yards on 24 attempts, Kuresa was effective on both planned runs and scrambles. His 40-yard touchdown dash midway through the third quarter — combined with a two-point conversion on a trick play — tied the game at 21-21.\nFirst-year coach Bruce Barnum 's Vikings (6-1, 3-1 Big Sky) would not trail again.\nThree minutes later, Kuresa took off on a 15-yard run and flipped over a Mustangs defender and into the end zone to put PSU up 28-21.\nThe Mustangs answered with a 57-yard touchdown pass on a trick play from reserve quarterback Kory Fox to Kyle Lewis. Then the Vikings regained the lead early in the fourth on a 13-yard touchdown pass from Kuresa to Trent Riley, who finished with five catches for 88 yards and the score.\nCal Poly tied the game at 35-35 on Lewis' 29-yard run with 2:34 to play. But then Kuresa directed a 10-play, 52-yard drive that ended with Gonzales' field goal.\nThe Vikings' win came against former PSU coach Tim Walsh, whose Mustangs fell to 2-5 (1-3 Big Sky). Portland State won despite being outgained 536-386, with Cal Poly's triple-option attack racking up 420 yards rushing.\nMaking his first start in place of injured senior Chris Brown, Jenkins made some big plays for Cal Poly, including a 50-yard touchdown run, but he also lost two fumbles.\nThe Mustangs lost two more fumbles on their first two plays of the game, which led to two Gonzales field goals for an early 6-0 Vikings lead.\nAfter a long bus trip back to Portland, the Vikings will take on No. 19 Montana next Saturday. The Grizzlies beat North Dakota 42-16 on Saturday in Missoula.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:14:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:15:29.527+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
