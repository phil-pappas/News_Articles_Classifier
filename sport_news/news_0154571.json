Less than four minutes later, Maddox answered with a 2-yard scoring run to tie the game. \nThe Greyhounds seemed to get a charge from their next two points, scored when All-Metro defensive tackle Ellison Jordan sacked Costabile in the end zone for a 9-7 lead with 7:39 left in the second quarter. Just before the safety, a Gaels player had downed a Gilman punt at the 1-yard line, apparently thinking he was in the end zone. \nThe safety \"was a real big boost,\" said Jordan, who also saw time at fullback and was the lead blocker on Maddox's touchdown. \"I know I started getting a little upset because I knew we play better than this and we had to get the juice flowing, but when I got that safety, I was pumped, ready to go.\" \nNo. 3 Mount Saint Joseph football travels to face No. 1 Gilman School in Roland Park, Baltimore on Friday, Oct. 2, 2015.

The junior quarterback added an 8-yard scoring run in the third quarter, and after safety Drew Ehrlich's interception, Maddox added a 10-yard touchdown with 2:32 to go. \nThe Gaels, who haven't beaten Gilman since 2008, could not contain the run, especially Hill, Maddox and Antonio Dupree, because the Greyhounds line opened hole after hole for the backs to pop through. Gilman had about a foot advantage on every Gaels defensive lineman. \n\"Being big helps,\" said the 6-foot-7, 290-pound Hamilton of a line that includes Stephen Spanellis, Wes Mehl, Stewart Keehner and Ja'mion Franklin, the smallest of whom is 6-3, 280 pounds. \nI think we have great camaraderie, so off the field, in school we hang out, we joke around. At practice when it's time be serious, we get to work. … So I think being big, being veterans, being friends when we come together, it's something special.\" \nBoth teams were affected by the wind and rain, but it probably hurt the Gaels more, because while they can run the ball, they rely more heavily than Gilman on a passing game that wasn't as fluent as usual. \n\"I'm especially proud of the defense,\" first-year Mount Saint Joseph coach Rich Holzer said. \"They got put in a lot of bad situations today because of turnovers and things like that and they held them. They did a good job. One or two [fewer] dropped passes … and this is a different game. I'm proud of the kids, the way they fought.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:39:05.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
