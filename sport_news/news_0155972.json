But again, Canada has trouble with the little things needed to get the upper hand. \nWhile strong defensively, a lapse led to the first try of the match when France took it down from mid-field ending with a try by Wesley Fofana just four minutes in, the fastest try in the tournament so far. \nWhile Canada was able to create some attack, it had trouble finding its legs early in the scrums. A penalty kick by Frederic Michalak increased the French lead to 10-0. \nCanada was dealt another blow when captain Tyler Ardron suffered an injury midway through the first half. Ardron had just returned to the side for the Italy match after being out two months with a knee injury. In the 28th minute, Guilhem Guirado finished a maul close to the Canadian line with another try to give France a 17-0 lead. \nOn the ensuing restart, a great take on the kick by Nathan Hirayama set Canada deep in France's end, a sequence which ended with D T H van der Merwe scoring his third try of the tournament to cut the deficit to 17-7. \nIt didn't stop there. A second great restart led to a try by Aaron Carpenter and though the conversion was missed, Canada suddenly was within five points of the 2011 World Cup finalists and the Canadian fans who dotted Stadium MK were excited. \nBut the good feelings would end towards halftime when another maul near the Canadian line resulted in a try from Rabah Slimani, sending France to the break leading 24-12. \nCanada did start the second half well. The scrum was holding up well. The ball handling was good. And there was even a clever between-the-legs pass from Jamie Cudmore. Hirayama kicked a couple of penalties to cut the French margin to 24-18. \nBut after Michalak answered with a penalty of his own, the French, who themselves missed several opportunities, began to show their dominance over a fatigued Canadian side. \nIn the 66th minute, French pressure led to a try from Pascal Pape, who was held by the Canadian defence but found just enough space to touch the ball down over the try line. \nThe final blow came when Nanyak Dala was issued a yellow card for a deliberate offside near his own line. To Canada's credit, it held France on that possession but could not hold off Remy Grosso a few minutes later. That try in the 74th minute capped the scoring. \nThe result wasn't what Canada wanted, but manager Gareth Rees was very pleased with the effort. \n\"Along with last week's performance, Canada is back,\" he said. \"Canada can play in stadiums of this size.\" \n\"Canada plays a fantastic brand of rugby. And we would like to have more fixtures like this, playing against the top nations, showing that Canada can play rugby.\" \nHead coach Kieran Crowley also praised his guys. \n\"They gave it everything,\" he said. \"We couldn't ask for any more.\" \n\"We got to within six but then we made a couple of basic mistakes and gave a couple of penalties. We competed for long periods of the game and we just didn't get the result.\" \n\"We play a pretty exciting brand of rugby,\" Ardron said. \"We got the ball in behind them and made them chase us for bit and it allowed us to play our own game the whole time.\" \nCanada finishes its run at the Rugby World Cup with its final group-play match Tuesday against Romania.
