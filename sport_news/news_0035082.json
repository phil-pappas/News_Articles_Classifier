Comment   Dave Horvath Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 11:53 PM Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 11:53 PM The city of Neosho again will provide $10,000 from the hotel/motel tax to augment the upcoming Neosho Holiday Classic High School Basketball Tournament. Prior to approval Tuesday by Neosho City Council, City Manager Troy Royer noted the 2014 tournament resulted in 485 players and coaches being booked into 297 motel rooms for the duration of the tourney, held between Christmas and New Years in the Neosho high school and middle school gyms. Using the “local multiplier effect” based on financial expense figures, he said the event stimulated the local economy by more than $156,000. Justin Branham with Branco Enterprises, the promoter and sponsor of the tournament, said 16 boys teams will compete, including from Tennessee, Arkansas and Texas. Like most years, several of the players are ranked in the ESPN Top 100 list. “There will be some NBA-caliber talent,” Branham said. The girls tournament has been reduced to eight teams, he said. The reason is it’s been difficult to gain commitments from 16 girls teams in the past because there are numerous girls tournaments at the same time. Having 12 or 14 teams created the need for cross-bracketing and non-traditional seeding, of which neither coaches nor kids were happy about. The boys will play a four-day tourney, while the girls finish up in three days, Branham said. Other new business A special-use permit was granted by council for property at 1411 Ozark Drive to allow the residents to operate a beauty shop from the garage. Dana Daniel, the city’s development services director, said the property has plenty of parking in the driveway so customers will not restrict the street. Council OK’d the acquisition of a dispense pump for fuel at Hugh Robinson Memorial Airport. Broyles Petroleum and Equipment of Springfield will supply the new pump at a cost of $5,566.93, according to Daniel, who said the current pump is worn out and the new one is in the budget. Bids The purchase of three patrol cars for the police department was approved. Republic Ford will supply the Dodge Chargers for $25,327 each through a state bid. With a $5,000 trade-in allowance for three very high-mileage vehicles being taken out of service, Chief David Kennedy said, the total bill is $70,981. Four bids were approved to supplement the public works department. Council accepted the low bid of MFA Oil to supply bulk fuel and diesel. Neosho Concrete secured the annual concrete bid. Kunshek Chat & Coal of Pittsburg, Kan., will provide rock salt, as needed, for $80 a ton. The bulk rock bid was awarded to Kemp Stone of Neosho. Council tabled a decision on bids for insurance and liability after the recommendation from Human Resources Director Georgia Holtz to accept the bid of MIRMA over the bid from MOPERM, which has provided coverage for several years. City attorney Steve Hays advised that MOPERM is assisting the city in several lawsuits, so he wants to be sure MIRMA will continue that assistance. Page 2 of 3 - MOPERM requires a $10,000 deductible, but the deductible with MIRMA is $1,000. Holtz highlighted four recent incidents in which the city paid more than $30,000 total because of the higher deductible, but would have paid $4,000 under MIRMA coverage. Hays reported to council that a lawsuit filed by attorney Bruce Copeland against the city and City Clerk Nora Houdyshell has been dismissed, but he indicated that a couple of lawsuits against the city remain active. Council also approved Holtz as the city’s delegate to the annual LAGERS convention. More business Approved by council was an amendment to the Empire District Electric agreement to add a streetlight at 1203 Johnson Drive and an agreement with Comprehensive Facility Services, for whom a bid previously was accepted to refurbish The Civic with LED lighting. Two items for the police department were approved. The renewal of a $6,322 agreement with Advance Public Safety allows the Quick-Ticket system in patrol cars. Chief Kennedy said a Carfax agreement provides an additional tool for tracking vehicles. Council approved the first reading of a bill to rezone property at 2030 La Questa Drive from R-1, first dwelling house district, to C-2, retail district, as petitioned by Neosho Investments LLC. That will be corrected to C-1 retail district for the second and third readings of the bill, according to Daniel. Reports Royer advised council that the Neosho Transportation Development District (TDD) is getting ready to complete improvements to the Hale McGinty-Waldo Hatler intersection. A drop-inlet has been inserted to alleviate flooding at that location. Upon completion, he said, the TDD expects a payment of $100,000 for the city’s TIF (tax increment financing) fund as stated in the cooperative agreement with the TDD. Wes Franklin, the city’s public relations/event coordinator, reported that last weekend’s Neosho Fall Festival drew the biggest crowd for that event that he has seen. With no scientific way to measure, Franklin estimated that 4,000 people attended the downtown event Saturday and another 1,500 Sunday. Extended discussion ensued when Councilman Tom Workman brought up the issue of the problem of unauthorized usage of the RV park adjacent to the Hickory Creek bridge at Morse Park North and said it is “becoming a tent city.” Council charged Hays with drafting a resolution to provide more “teeth” to the law. Parks Director Amy Moritz noted that signs detailing rules and regulations are being constructed. Citizen requests In visitors’ business, resident J.C. Herrell requested that restrictions be enacted on vendors during city-sponsored events such as Celebrate Neosho and the fall festival. Herrell helped in the Neosho Kiwanis Club booth that sold kettle corn and noted the organization that provides scholarships, shoes and clothing for area children had been the only ones that sold kettle corn at events previously. Several other booths also were selling the product at the fall festival. Page 3 of 3 - “When you are a non-profit organization and you are competing against four or five, these non-profits don’t make as much money,” Herrell contended. “Newton County and Neosho are losing funds that were going back into this community to support these scholarships and these shoes and buying coats, while the other people are pocketing their money.” Neosho needs to be more pro-community on these events, he suggested. Royer answered that the city hates to limit vendors who want to contribute to events, but organizers will look at the issue prior to Celebrate Neosho next summer. “I do understand Mr. Herrell’s point on trying to watch out for our civic clubs that are trying to help and raise monies for local charities,” he said. Manueal Cornelio advised council of a septic problem at the Iglesia De Dios (Israelita) Church at 1545 Business 49 and an inability to obtain permission to dig on neighboring properties to make necessary improvements needed to hook into the city sewer system. The city’s line only runs on the south side of the highway. Public works officials will analyze the situation, but Royer noted it probably would take building a lift station in that area or boring under the highway to connect to the sewer line on the other side, both costly propositions. To go to such an expense, he believes there must be a bigger buy-in of property owners to hook onto the city’s sewer, such as added development in the area. Property on that side of the highway is not within city limits and would have to be annexed, he said.
