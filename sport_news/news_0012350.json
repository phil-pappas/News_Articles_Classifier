In six games in Dallas, the Whitecaps have never even managed a draw. The two teams played to a scoreless draw at BC Place last week, and defender Jordan Harvey says the Caps would love to return the favour with a least a tie tonight.\n“Dallas is a tough place to play. We have had some trouble there. With this team and the talent we have it is definitely possible. I think we will go there, compete and get a different result.”\nThe MLS playoffs are only a couple of weeks away and Vancouver can jump in to first in the Western Conference with a victory. Head Coach Carl Robinson says the Caps need to find a way to win\n“Games at this stage of the season are very tight no matter who they are between. There are ten good teams in our conference and we are in at the moment. With two games to go, we are in so just need to regroup, refocus and see where we go from here.”\nA major concern for Vancouver is the lack of healthy bodies. Midfielders Nicolas Mezquida and Pedro Morales are both out with hamstring injuries. Striker Darren Mattocks is still with the Jamaican National Team and Kendall Waston played for Costa Rica last night.\nIf last week’s draw was any indication, these Western Conference rivals have figured out each other’s game plans, and goalie David Ousted says Vancouver has to find a way to change things up.\n“I think Wednesday showed how similar these two teams are in almost cancelling each other out. We are very similar in the way we want to play. It was just two teams that couldn’t really find a way through two strong defences.”\nKick off is at 6 p.m.\nCarl Robinson. Texas.
