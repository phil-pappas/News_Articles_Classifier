Stanley recorded a school-record five interceptions to help the Indians avoid what could have been one of the most stunning upsets in Foothill League history.Instead, Hart prevailed with a 24-21 victory in double overtime. \nStanley had four first half interceptions, but his final pick came on the biggest play of the game — in the second overtime. \nAs Grizzles quarterback Victor Corona rolled out and tried to find a receiver in the back of the end zone, Stanley was able to make a jumping grab to seal the game, and give Stanley his third interception in the Indians’ own end zone. \n“I was just trying to do my job,” Stanley said. \nGolden Valley (5-3 overall, 1-2 Foothill League), which was coming off its first-ever Foothill League victory, nearly made it back-to-back league victories. \nBut this one would have been much bigger considering it was against a Hart team ranked sixth in this week's CIF-Southern Section West Valley Division poll.\"No one expected us to do what we did tonight but us. My players played their hearts out,\" said Golden Valley head coach Dan Kelley. \"I couldn't be more proud of a group of players than I was tonight.\"The Grizzlies took an early lead when Corona found Julian Torres for the game’s first score on a 28-yard touchdown pass. \nAfter trading turnovers and offensive miscues, the Indians (7-1, 3-0) and Grizzles found themselves tied 7-7 at the half. \nThe opening kickoff of the second half was fumbled by Hart, and Golden Valley recovered. Six plays later, Corona and Torres connected again for their second touchdown when Torres made a great adjustment on a Corona 14-yard throw.Golden Valley led 14-7 entering the fourth quarter, but Hart tied it up on a 25-yard Nick Moore run with 7:53 to play. \nLater in the fourth, Moore was injured on a scramble and had to be helped off the field. \nMoore would return to the game on the next series but left after he went down again as he was dropping back and tried to plant his foot. \nJunior Justice Provost filled in for Moore for the remainder of the game, and it was his big fourth-down pass to Brock Williams that helped set up Hart's tying touchdown the first overtime on a 3-yard C.J. Sioussat run.Earlier in the first overtime, Golden Valley went ahead 21-14 on a 10-yard score taken in by Jesse Camacho. \nIn the second overtime, senior kicker Andrew Nielsen kicked a 32-yard field goal to put the Indians ahead for good.The Grizzlies took the ball down to the Hart 6-yard line on the ensuing possession before Corona threw his game-ending interception on first-and-goal. \nHart head coach Mike Herrington said after the game he is unsure if Moore will be ready for next week’s game against Saugus.
