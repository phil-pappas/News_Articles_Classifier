(AP) - Two people with knowledge of the situation say Seattle Seahawks running back Fred Jackson was uninjured when his car crashed outside the team’s facility. \nThe crash happened on Tuesday afternoon, about 48 hours before the Seahawks face San Francisco. The people spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the accident. Jackson was taken back to the team’s facility and reported no injuries. \nPhotos of Jackson’s black Chevrolet Corvette with New York license plates were seen on social media. A stop sign and street signs were knocked over in the wreck. The accident happened at the end of a long straight road that leads from the Seahawks facility to Lake Washington Blvd and in front of a Seahawks sign. \nMessages left for the Renton Police Department were not immediately returned. \n___ \nAP Sports Writer John Wawrow and freelance writer Curtis Crabtree contributed to this report. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:19:40.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
