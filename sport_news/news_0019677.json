(AP Photo/Chris Tilley) \nIn Anthony Davis, the New Orleans Pelicans have the good fortune of having arguably the best young player in the NBA, but the team has struggled to put — and keep — a strong supporting cast around him. Those efforts took another hit Tuesday, when it was revealed that Tyreke Evans would be out indefinitely after undergoing knee surgery. \nIt’s the second time since May that Evans has had an arthroscopic procedure on his right knee, and it continues the Pelicans’ bad luck with injuries, with just a week to go before the regular season kicks off. The loss of Evans is a particularly tough one to take, as the 26-year-old swingman is relied upon for both his offensive and defensive contributions. . @TyrekeEvans : 17th in #NBA in offensive real plus/minus last season – @PelicansNBA : 4.6% more efficient offensively with him on the court \n— Pete Newmann (@petenewmann) October 20, 2015 . @TyrekeEvans : most efficient isolation defender in the #NBA (min. 40 isolations defended). Opponents shot 22.7% against him in isolation. \n— Pete Newmann (@petenewmann) October 21, 2015 The problem with Tyreke Evans isn't just the latest surgery it's the fact that it is his third such procedure since the summer of 2014. \n— Jeff Stotts (@RotowireATC) October 20, 2015 \nThe New Orleans Times-Picayune offered more details on the wave of injuries hitting the Pelicans: \nBackup point guard Norris Cole is expected to miss up to six weeks with a high ankle sprain. \nStarting center Omer Asik remains out with a strained right calf, and top backup center Alexis Ajinca is out four to six weeks with a strained hamstring. However, Pelicans Coach Alvin Gentry said before Monday’s preseason game against the Houston Rockets that Asik and Ajinca were making progress. \nForward Luke Babbitt remains out indefinitely with a left hamstring strain, and forward Quincy Pondexter is not expected to return until sometime in November because of a slow recovery from arthroscopic knee surgery in May. \nAlso, starting point guard Jrue Holiday remains on a minute restriction that will extend to 15 minutes per game until January to avoid recurring problems with his surgically repaired lower right leg. \nApart from that, the team is in terrific shape. At least Davis, who led the NBA with a 30.8 PER last season, is healthy, although he may want to tread very carefully around the team’s practice facility. Des writes for the Early Lead and the D.C.
