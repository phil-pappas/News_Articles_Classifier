But the win against Oregon in double overtime might have cured WSU of its hot/cold malady. Or so the Cougars hope. “I think we’re over that,” quarterback Luke Falk said Monday. “I think coach Leach did a nice job of addressing that and saying we need to respect everyone.” So even though this week’s opponent is an Oregon State team that’s 0-2 in the Pac-12 and ranked dead last in the league in several statistical categories including scoring, pass efficiency, total offense and rushing defense, the Cougars say there’s no danger that they’ll overlook their opponent. “We’re not in the position to be taking anyone lightly given the type of season we’ve been having,” wide receiver Gabe Marks said. “Every week it comes down to the wire. I think we understand what it takes to win now, and we know everyone in the conference can beat anyone.” “I think we’re doing some good things,” WSU coach Mike Leach said. In the early days of this season, when WSU was struggling to find itself after the surprising opening day defeat to Portland State, Leach said he and his staff were very blunt with the players in addressing what needed to be fixed. But unlike his players, the coach isn’t quite ready to proclaim that the Cougars’ inconsistency is a thing of the past. “I don’t know,” Leach said when asked whether his team has stopped its maddening tendency of playing to the level of its opponent. “I think we’ve got to constantly check that. I’ll have a better idea of it when we practice this week. “The only level you should play at is the best you can possibly play. If we do well in practice, then maybe we took a step (forward) for the time being.” More like this story", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:13:48.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
