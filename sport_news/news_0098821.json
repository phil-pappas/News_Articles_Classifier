(AP) â€” Kentucky senior nose guard Melvin Lewis is out for the remainder of the regular season with a broken leg sustained in Thursday's loss to Auburn.\nCoach Mark Stoops said Monday the junior will have surgery Tuesday for a fractured fibula. The coach says recovery normally takes six weeks and that he hoped Lewis could heal in time to play in a bowl game if the Wildcats (4-2, 2-2 Southeastern Conference) qualify for postseason.\nStoops says, \"We need to try to win a few more games down the stretch here and give him an opportunity to try to come back and play one last time.\"\nLewis had 20 tackles and a sack while starting four of six games. Sophomore Matt Elam will replace him in Saturday night's game at Mississippi State.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
