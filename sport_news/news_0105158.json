She finished with 206.01 points. \nGold doubled an intended triple Salchow late, but that was the only blemish in an otherwise brilliant performance by the 20-year-old. She won the free skate and finished with 202.80 points. \n\"On the last jumping pass, the takeoff was just a little slippy on the toepick, and I just didn't commit enough to really get in and try to save it,\" Gold said. \nWorld silver medalist Satoko Miyahara of Japan was third with 188.07 points. Fremont 16-year-old Karen Chen, also in her Grand Prix debut, finished sixth with 110.26 points. Motor sports Jeff Gordon led a Hendrick Motorsports rout in qualifying to win the pole for his final race at Talladega (Alabama) Superspeedway. \nGordon led teammates Kasey Kahne and Jimmie Johnson in a sweep of the top three starting spots for the race Sunday. Dale Earnhardt Jr. qualified fifth to put the four Hendrick drivers in the first three rows at the 2.66-mile superspeedway. Advertisement \nIt was the best outcome for Gordon and Earnhardt, the only two Hendrick drivers still in the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship field. Both need strong runs -- Earnhardt may actually need a victory -- to advance into the third round of the playoffs. Four drivers will be cut from the Chase field after the race. \nTimothy Peters won the Truck Series race at Talladega Superspeedway for the second consecutive year. The victory was Peters' first of the season and the ninth of his career. Brandon Jones finished second and was followed by Mason Mingus, Erik Jones and Tyler Reddick. \nLewis Hamilton posted the fastest time in the final practice session for the United States Grand Prix at the Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas, as another day of harsh weather pounded the track with torrential rain. Then he and other drivers waited through a three-hour delay before race officials postponed qualifying until a rare Sunday morning session before the scheduled afternoon race. College basketball Arizona freshman Ray Smith, a key part of coach Sean Miller's latest recruiting class, will not play this season after tearing his right ACL in practice. \nA 6-foot-8 small forward from Las Vegas, Smith was expected to play a significant role with the Wildcats, along with fellow freshman Allonzo Trier. Smith was rated as one of the nation's top small forwards out of high school despite missing his senior season with a torn left ACL. Winter sports Federica Brignone earned her maiden World Cup win, ending a nearly eight-year wait by the Italian women's team for a giant slalom triumph. \nIn the season-opening race on a sun-soaked Rettenbach glacier in Soelden, Austria, Brignone held on to a commanding first-run lead to beat last year's winner, Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States, by 0.85 seconds. \n\"I can't really believe what's happening,\" said the Italian, who finished in an aggregate time of 2 minutes, 24.27 seconds for her first victory in 99 World Cup starts. The last Italian winner of a women's giant slalom had been Denise Karbon in January 2008. Tennis American Jack Sock reached his second ATP Tour final of the season by beating second-seeded Richard Gasquet of France 6-4, 6-2 at the Stockholm Open. He will play defending champion Tomas Berdych in Sunday's final.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T07:02:05.529+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
