It is a great negative experience.\" \nMourinho said there were no unrest within the Chelsea squad and his players were behaving in a \"great\" manner, despite the side being eight points behind Premier League leaders Manchester United. \n\"The players, when they make a mistake, they know and they feel,\" he said. \n\"We speak openly, no prima donnas. When you make a mistake you have to speak about it. I call it 'coaching'.\" \nMourinho kept his own counsel when asked about the controversy over former Chelsea doctor Eva Carneiro. \nCarneiro and head physio Jon Fearn were criticised by the Portuguese for treating Eden Hazard with the side already down to 10 men against Swansea earlier on this season. \nThe club doctor, 42, had her role downgraded before she decided to leave the club. \nThe Football Association cleared Mourinho of making discriminatory comments to Carneiro - a decision criticised by Women in Football as well as FA board member Heather Rabbatts. \n\"For the last two months I did not open my mouth and I will keep like this,\" said Mourinho. \n\"One day I will speak, and I will choose that day.\" \nAsked about FA chief Greg Dyke's comments that he should apologise, Mourinho replied: \"That's the same answer. I am quiet about it for a long time. \n\"I read, and listen, and watch, and I am quiet.\" \nResponding to a suggestion that commenting might help the issue go away, he said: \"I can be here all day. My chance to speak will come.\" \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
