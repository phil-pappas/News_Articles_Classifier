Astros top Royals in opener 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nKansas City, Mo. \nCollin McHugh and the Houston Astros beat the Kansas City Royals at their own game Thursday night, relying on sharp pitching and stingy defense for a 5-2 victory in the opener of their AL Division Series. \nMcHugh (1-0) allowed four hits, including a pair of solo homers by Kendrys Morales , while pitching around a 49-minute rain delay. The right-hander lasted six innings before turning the game over to his bullpen, which scattered three runners over the final three innings. \nTony Sipp , Will Harris and Oliver Perez got the game to Luke Gregerson , part of Oakland's wild-card collapse in Kansas City last year. He handled the ninth to earn the save. \nGeorge Springer and Colby Rasmus went deep for the homer-happy Astros, but they also scored via the same sort of small ball the Royals used in reaching the World Series last season. \nYordano Ventura (0-1) yielded three runs on four hits and a walk in two innings for Kansas City, but did not come back following the delay. \nThe Astros, who struggled so mightily on the road this season, have apparently solved their woes just in time. They beat the Yankees 3-0 in New York in Tuesday night's wild-card game, then took care of a Royals club built specifically for spacious Kauffman Stadium. \nHouston also made it the first time since 1970 that visiting teams won baseball's first four postseason games, STATS said. The other two times it happened were 1906 and 1923. \nRangers 5, Blue Jays 3: Robinson Chirinos hit a two-run homer against David Price , Rougned Odor had a solo shot and Texas beat Toronto on Thursday in an AL Division Series opener as postseason baseball returned to Toronto for the first time in 22 years. Both starting third basemen left with injuries: Texas' Adrian Beltre in the third with a sore lower back and Toronto's Josh Donaldson in the fifth after he was kneed in the head while sliding in an attempt to break up a double play. Yovani Gallardo (1-0) allowed two runs and four hits in five innings, improving to 4-0 with a 1.78 ERA in four career starts against Toronto.
