Hopefully we continue to talk and get better.”\nAfter joining the Kings this off-season on a $10 million deal , Rondo said he thought he and Karl were “a great fit.”\nRondo, a four-time All Star, has a history of butting heads with his coaches. After Dallas Mavericks coach Rick Carlisle benched Rondo in a playoff loss to the Houston Rockets in April, Rondo stayed away from the team for the remainder of the series. He was also suspended for one game in February for arguing with Carlisle after being benched.\nRondo averaged 8.9 points and 7.9 assists in 68 games last season.\nThe Kings will play their final preseason game on Saturday against the New Orleans Pelicans before opening the regular season on Oct. 28 against the Los Angeles Clippers.\n• Video: Lakers’ Kobe Bryant exits preseason game with left leg injury\n- Erin Flynn\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.si.com/nba/2015/02/25/rajon-rondo-rick-carlisle-fight-suspension-dallas-mavericks", "http://cowbellkingdom.com/multimedia-kings-down-the-lakers-in-las-vegas/", "http://www.si.com/", "http://www.si.com/nba/2015/07/03/rajon-rondo-sacramento-kings-contract-nba-free-agency-2015", "http://www.si.com/nba/2015/04/22/rajon-rondo-benched-mavericks-rockets", "http://www.si.com/nba/2015/10/14/kobe-bryant-exits-preseason-game-left-leg-injury", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:38:21.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
