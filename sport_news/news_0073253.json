They also will name Tim Bogar bench coach.\nTake Our Poll Servais and Bogar, both 48, are close with new Mariners general manager Jerry Dipoto, serving as his assistants with the Los Angeles Angels this season. Dipoto and Servais played together with the Colorado Rockies in 2000.\nThat prior relationship should be important for Dipoto, who at times clashed with manager Mike Scioscia during his time in Anaheim. Disagreements over the use of advanced analytics led to a power struggle between the two men, and owner Arte Moreno ultimately took Scioscia’s side. Dipoto resigned in July.\nRelated Stories Don Mattingly out as Dodgers manager Report: Scott Servais emerging as the favorite for the Seattle Mariners' managerial opening More pitchers involved in gambling scandal in Japan baseball Mets wrap up NLCS sweep of Cubs Blue Jays fend off elimination with Marco Estrada’s big start Ron Santo would love these Chicago Cubs, despite NLCS struggles against New York Mets After being hired by the Mariners on Sept. 28, Dipoto was asked about whether he would retain manager Lloyd McClendon. His response was an apparent reference to his situation with Scioscia: “The best marriages are those in which you fall in love and then get married, rather than someone arranging it from 1,000 miles away.”\nWhen Dipoto decided not to retain McClendon, he downplayed that experience as the reason. He cited philosophical differences about baseball as a reason for a change.\nServais will be the Mariners’ seventh full-time manager since their most recent playoff appearance in 2001. He inherits a veteran team that fell short of lofty expectations this season, finishing 76-86 this past season. The Mariners return a solid nucleus of players, including pitcher Felix Hernandez, second baseman Robinson Cano, outfielder Nelson Cruz and third baseman Kyle Seager.\nServais has no managerial experience. He interviewed for the vacant San Diego Padres managerial job a month ago. He’s worked in major-league front offices the past seven years. This past season, he worked closely with Dipoto in Anaheim, overseeing scouting and player development while trying to shape the philosophy of the organization.\nBefore that, Servais worked for six seasons (2006-11) as senior director of player development for the Texas Rangers. He was responsible for the on-field development in the minor-league system and worked with the team’s major-league catchers.\nAfter deciding not to bring back McClendon, who was under contract for this season, Dipoto said that finding someone with managerial experience wasn’t a priority in his search.\n“Baseball experience counts for a lot no matter where they came through,” he said. “I think having a major-league background somewhat, whether it be through coaching, managing, playing, etc., is important. I think that lends to credibility in a clubhouse, but other than that it’s going to be about leadership, about team building, about the ability to inspire an environment.”\nThe move follows a recent major-league trend in which teams have hired managers with no managing experience. That includes the St. Louis Cardinals’ Mike Matheny, the Chicago White Sox’s Robin Ventura and the Colorado Rockies’ Walt Weiss.\nBogar had been rumored to be the leading candidate for the manager’s job before Dipoto had even decided not to bring back McClendon.\nBogar was hired as a special assistant to Dipoto by the Angels this season. Before that, Bogar served as bench coach for the Rangers for the 2014 season. He was promoted to interim manager on Sept. 5, 2014 when Rangers manager Ron Washington resigned.\nThe Rangers went 14-8 with Bogar as manager. Bogar spent four years managing in the minors before gaining big-league coaching experience with the Rays in 2008 under Joe Maddon and then three seasons with the Red Sox staff. He served as manager of the Angels’ affiliate in Class AA in 2013, leading the Arkansas Travelers to 73-66 record. In his five years of managing in the minors, he compiled a 362-266 record.  \nRyan Divish : 206-464-2373 or rdivish@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @RyanDivish .
