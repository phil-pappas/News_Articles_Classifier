It is not broken, Roberts says. \n12:35 p.m. \nIreland's players are receiving a huge cheer at Millennium Stadium as they jog around the field before the Rugby World Cup quarterfinal against Argentina. \nThe green shirts of the Irish fans heavily outnumber the sky blue-and-white shirts of their Argentine counterparts. \nBut while Ireland has never reached the semifinals, losing five quarterfinals, the Pumas are looking to book a place in the last four again, after upsetting the odds in 2007. \nThe winner of this match plays either Australia or Scotland, who were playing their quarterfinal at Twickenham later Sunday. \n12 p.m. \nIt's time for the northern hemisphere teams to front up in the Rugby World Cup quarterfinals. \nNew Zealand thrashed France 62-13 and South Africa squeezed past Wales 23-19 as the Rugby Championship heavyweights got a jump-start in the battle of the hemispheres. \nEurope's best chance for representation in the semifinals lies with Six Nations champion Ireland, which takes on Argentina in Sunday's first game at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff. Then it's Australia vs. Scotland to round off the quarterfinal stage. \nBy the end of Sunday, all roads lead to Twickenham, which will host the two semifinals next weekend and the final on Oct. 31. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T14:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:05:11.723+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
