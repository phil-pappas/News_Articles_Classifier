How much pressure did you feel stepping into an expanded role as a setter for the team? \nWe really do play for each other, so that’s really helpful. All the girls are really awesome. It’s different coming from last year where I barely played at all to this year being the 5-1 setter. It’s really an adaptation, and they’ve helped me a lot with that. \nYou host Appleton West in a WIAA Division 1 regional semifinal. What’s going to be the biggest key for your team to advance? \nIf everyone just focuses on playing for each other, which we do, I think it will be hard to take us down. \nHow did the Do Something Special Club begin at De Pere? \nIt was my sophomore year when we started it. It was group of 15 or 20 of us that really started it and got it going. Last year we added a few more, and this year we opened it up to everyone, whoever wanted to join. The numbers have definitely jumped. It’s really exciting. \nWhat does the Do Something Special Club do? \nWe’ve done a cancer walkathon. Every year we go to Angel’s Touch (Assisted Living) and decorate cookies and sing Christmas carols with the people there. That’s always really fun. The thing I guess we’re known for is after every home football game we clean up the bleachers so that our janitors don’t have to stay up super late. \nAre there any new activities your club has on the horizon? \nWe haven’t really decided what our next step is going to be as a club. But if anybody has any ideas on service projects that we could help with in the community that would be great. \nWhat are your plans and career goals following high school? \nI’m hoping to attend Carroll University and be admitted into their direct admission program for physical therapy. \nHow did you become interested in that field? \nWhen my older brother played (football) in college, he went through a few different surgeries. He tore his Achilles tendon, so he was home for a while. I got to help him with his stretches. That was back when I was in intermediate school and I thought it was the coolest thing ever. That kind of stuck with me I guess. I also have a few aunts that are (physical therapists). \nWhat is your most memorable sports moment? \nA few years ago when my club volleyball team went to nationals, we had this really, really long rally. The middle on my team kicked the ball up because she wasn’t able to get there with her hands. We ended up winning the point. It was just exciting to see something like that. \nWhat is your most embarrassing moment playing sports? \nIt’s happened a few times. When I’m setting in volleyball and the ball falls between my hands and hits me in the face. That’s pretty embarrassing. It’s more embarrassing that it has happened more than once. Buy Photo \nDe Pere senior Caroline Zehren (Photo: Andrew Pekarek/Press-Gazette Media) \nWhich of your teammates has the most extreme celebration following a point? \nI would say either Lexi Cerrato or Kasheah Jennings. When they get riled up, it’s awesome to watch them. \nWho is the best-dressed person on the team? \nI think Hannah Goetz always dresses really nice. She has really good style. She always has these really cool outfits that I wish I had in my closet. \nWhich teammate should have their own reality TV show? \nI would say Andraya Green. She does (funny) stuff and doesn’t always realize that people are looking at her. \nWho is the most trusting person on the team? \nLindsey Mirkes by far. She’s so easygoing, and I feel like she’s always there and helpful. \nWhich teammate would you classify as being the messiest? \nProbably Lexi. She hasn’t washed her knee pads since last year and they smell so bad. She says she doesn’t want to lose them, but I don’t see how they would get lost in the wash. \nWho on the team could survive on a deserted island? \nProbably Sydney Otto. She would figure out a way to survive. \nSydney is one of the most versatile track and field athletes I’ve seen. What’s the most athletic thing you’ve seen her do? \nI will never forget freshman year during volleyball season, we used to practice on that court, and she would run up the wall and flip off of it. \nSpeaking of flips, your coach wanted me to ask about your hair flip. What’s the story behind it? \nIt’s just something that I do. It’s just like a habit I guess. (Assistant) coach (Stephen) Gladwell said it seems like whenever he asks me a question I flip my hair. He always laughs at me and points it out. \nI saw on your Twitter account somebody parked in your spot on the first day of school. Did you ever find the culprit? \nI did. … There was a really long line (in the office) because it was the first day of school. I was nervous I was going to be late. But the kid in front of me said somebody had parked in his spot. The lady behind the front desk asked him, \"Well, where did you park then?\" He said, \"I parked in the spot next to it.\" That’s when I asked, \"Are you in (my spot)?\" \nIs it an advantage or disadvantage to have a last name that begins with a ‘Z’? \nIt was always nice when I was really young because we would always line up alphabetically and I’d always know where to go. But in middle school the first few weeks they put you in alphabetical order and in my science class I got the broken desk and didn’t get a book (the first day) because I was the last one. I’m used to being there. \nFavorites \nSubject: Human anatomy and physiology. \nFood: Mom’s homemade macaroni and cheese. \nTV show: “Grey’s Anatomy.” \nMovie: “Step Brothers.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:06:14.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
