Barrett will start over Cardale Jones during Saturday night’s game at Rutgers. \nMeyer made the announcement Tuesday afternoon during the Big Ten teleconference. \nThe decision comes in the wake of Saturday night’s game against Penn State, where Barrett threw for two scores and ran for over 100 yards with two touchdowns on the ground. \nJones was only 9-15 for 84 yards. \nWhen asked last week if the offense was running better with Barrett currently, Meyer replied that it was doing better against Penn State. \nMeyer added that anytime there’s a change at a position it’s a delicate decision especially with the quarterback spot. \n“Someone made the comment ‘Do you really care who plays at quarterback’ the other day and absolutely we care,” he said. “It’s not number 16 and 12, those are people that we care about deeply and we’re not ashamed to say that.” \nThe Buckeyes are back on the road this weekend as they will travel to Piscataway, N.J. to face Rutgers Saturday at 8 p.m. ©2015 by 10TV.com.
