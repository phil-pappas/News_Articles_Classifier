A silent auction was held before the meal that raised $1,140 which will go towards any maintenance and improvements needed at the cemetery. The silent auction was able to raise so much due to the impressive offerings, including an antique collection of thimbles, jewelry, a quilt square with the family coat of arms, homemade cinnamon rolls and handmade wooden items.\nRockne News reporter Lea Ann Lee was the lucky winner of this basket made by Theresa Gullikson, right, at the VFW Post 2527 Annual Celebration.
