The swimming pool franchise corporate office and independent franchise owners will be trading in their clean white look to sport branded pink polos, and service fleet vehicles will also feature breast cancer reminders. The goal is to motivate ongoing early detection efforts, as well as encourage ongoing support of breast cancer research.\n“Breast cancer has become a disease that dominates too many lives, and has caused too many painful memories for many of our staff, franchisees, clients and vendor partners,” explains Jef Flournoy, ASP Vice President of Franchise Development. “I lost my own step-mom to the ill-fated disease almost 15 years ago, and vividly remember those painful final days. Our team made a collective decision to choose breast cancer awareness as a cause close to our hearts.”\nThe American Cancer Society reports that one of every eight women in the United States born today will develop breast cancer in their lives. Early detection efforts, along with continued research on prevention and treatment, are more critical than ever. The ASP team wishes to honor the courageous people who have battled with breast cancer while using their mobile team of 325 swimming pool franchise operators and employees across 20 states to help raise visibility in the cities they serve.\n“It is with a great pride that our team and all of our owners strive to bring more awareness to this ill-fated disease during the month of October,” says Tom Swift, President and C.O.O. of ASP. “We hope that seeing all of our teams and trucks in pink will remind residents across the country to focus on early detection, support ongoing research, and honor the brave individuals who must fight this disease.”\nAs researchers continue their work on breast cancer prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cures, individuals can also make a difference. Family members can remind each other about the importance of early detection, many can participate in awareness walks, and those with the means can financially support ongoing research. Everyone can provide support and encourage those who are suffering with the disease, and their families.\n“We think about the great Jim Valvano and his inspiring words,” explains Stewart Vernon, Founder and C.E.O. of ASP, “‘Cancer can take away all of my physical abilities. It cannot touch my mind, it cannot touch my heart, and it cannot touch my soul.’ This is the message ASP wants to share with the cities we serve.”\nAbout ASP\nASP – America’s Swimming Pool Company is the nation’s largest swimming pool service, maintenance, and repair company, leading the industry with a highly trained team of pool service professionals across 20 states.
