Gavazzi has written an article on football coach Urban Meyer that has been published in the International Sport Coaching Journal. (Photo: Submitted) 48 CONNECT 11 TWEET 12 LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMANSFIELD — The last place Stephen Gavazzi expected to see his name was in a coaching journal. \nHe played high school football in Hershey, Pennsylvania, where he was an outside linebacker in a very successful program, but followed more academic pursuits that led to a background in family therapy and his current position as dean and director at Ohio State-Mansfield. \nA huge Buckeyes fan, he read something about new OSU football coach Urban Meyer soon after he was hired that immediately clicked. Meyer's incentive-based system bore an uncanny resemblance to studies Gavazzi has been doing for years on adolescents and their development and well-being. \nThat led to a sit-down with Meyer in April, 2013. \nTheir conversation went on Gavazzi's backburner until the Buckeyes won the 2014 national championship. \n\"When a lot of my friends and colleagues were saying to me from across the country, how in the world did your football team win with a third string quarterback, it wasn't a mystery to me,\" Gavazzi said. \nA professor of Human Development and Family Science, Gavazzi decided to put the long answer to that question on paper. \nHis article, \"Turning Boys Into Men: The Incentive-Based System in Urban Meyer's Plan to Win\" was published last week by the International Sport Coaching Journal. Editors of the journal felt Gavazzi's work was so important to the coaching community that they are giving readers free access to the piece on what is normally a pay site. \nGavazzi met again with Meyer this past summer to begin formulating the article. He also had access to members of Meyer's staff, including Director of Football Operations Brian Voltolini, and did extensive research on other successful coaches and their methods. \nGavazzi's piece centers on how Meyer's three-level (Blue, Red, Gold) system mirrors the three phases of a \"rite of passage\" — separation, transformation and reincorporation — that shapes one's transition from childhood to adulthood. \nAs Gavazzi explains it, the separation phase marks the beginning movement out of childhood status. The transformation phase involves a period of uncertainty characterized by vacillating between less mature and more mature behavior. Finally, the reincorporation phase represents the individual's integration of all new attitudes, values and behaviors required of successful adulthood status. \nIn Meyer's BRG system, players climb what Gavazzi describes as \"a ladder of privileges\" as they display more mature behavior on and off the field. \nBlue stands for ill-equipped. Every player starts with that designation in Meyer's system, and it's probably no coincidence he chose that particular color for that level. It's one of archrival Michigan's colors and can't be worn by anyone in Meyer's presence. \nFrom the Blue, or separation level, players graduate to Red, or the transformation level, where they are rewarded for progress while still working toward being a responsible adult, and finally to Gold, or the reincorporation level, which is the pinnacle in Meyer's system. \nSome of the perks from achieving Gold status? Academic tutoring sessions are strictly on a volunteer basis and players are allowed three unexcused absences from class before disciplinary action is taken. \nTransitions in status (up or down) are handled by the entire coaching staff. When a player is promoted, an announcement in made to the entire team in the form of a \"graduation ceremony.\" \nOther programs are in place to support the BRG system, including the Champions Club, which consists of quarterly award ceremonies throughout the year, where players are recognized for such things as 100 percent promptness at mandatory workouts and zero discipline and academic issues. It can make the difference between eating steak or hot dogs and wearing better team gear. \nThe \"Black Stripe\" ceremony, which has gotten great publicity since Meyer came on board, is part of a Big Brothers program where upperclassmen are assigned to freshmen at the first team meeting in August. Black stripes, signifying neophyte status, are put on the helmets of the freshmen by the Big Brothers, who are expected to serve as mentors. Upon the recommendation of each freshman's position coach, his black stripe is removed as a \"battlefield promotion.\" \nThose four players who were suspended for the season opener for undisclosed team violations? If academic in nature, they might have faced Super Tuesdays, which means reporting to study table at 6 a.m., or Night Shift, a series of Friday night study periods. If they were poor behavioral choices, the punitive action taken might have been Dawn Patrol — 6 a.m. sessions to perform menial tasks. \n\"Even though (Meyer) didn't use the (rite of passage) label, his way of thinking about it was absolutely on target,\" Gavazzi said. \"The idea of creating ceremonies and rituals for student-athletes as they progressed toward more mature behavior, both on and off the field, was something he was routinely doing.\" \nGavazzi notes that Meyer's BRG system is a key component of his Plan to Win, a competitiveness doctrine that was originally written during his first head coaching post at Bowling Green and modified through stints at Utah and Florida, where he won his first two national championships. \nThe challenges Meyer faced with a number of Florida players ending up on police blotters are well-documented. \n\"The difference is how much (the BRG system) permeates all aspects of his program now,\" Gavazzi said. \"It went from a simple system to now a very complex system in which you find blue-red-gold in everything. \n\"It's in his recruiting, in his career development, his weight room — it's everywhere.\" \nGavazzi has already approached Meyer about co-authoring a follow-up article. \n\"I think the beauty of this system is, that while it can work with any athlete, when you're getting elite athletes who also have the ability to perform at high academic levels, I think you get an increased synergy,\" Gavazzi said. \"It's like a multiplier effect. You get a great system with great athletes who also have academic prowess and I think even better things happen as a result.\" \njspencer@nncogannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:18:35.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
