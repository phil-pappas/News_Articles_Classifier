The stereotypical engineer is male.\nThat’s likely because most engineers are male. More than half of the 27,353 students attending the University of New Mexico are female, but only 20 percent of UNM’s 3,108 engineering students are women, about the same rate as those of New Mexico State University and the nation as a whole. At New Mexico Tech, 31 percent of the student body are women; 29 percent of engineering students are women.\nOnce women get into the workplace, they tend to leave the profession at higher rates than men do. Only 11 percent of practicing engineers are women.\nEngineering night\nThe Society of Women Engineers invites high school students considering an engineering career to meet engineers and students from 5 to 8 p.m. Nov. 12 at the University of New Mexico Centennial Engineering Center. “We’re missing out on a lot of talent,” said UNM engineering dean Joseph L. Cecchi.\nAcademic research shows that one reason women leave engineering or avoid it altogether is that a meaningful number of engineering workplaces resemble your geeky brother’s basement lair, where science fiction and comic book posters cover the walls, pizza boxes litter the furniture and video games eat up the bandwidth.\nThe studies don’t say that, of course. A University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee survey of 5,500 female engineering graduates found that 20 percent of those who left the profession did so because they didn’t like their boss or the climate or culture of their workplace. A third never entered the profession because they perceived the workplace as inflexible or as nonsupportive of women.\nBrooke Ayala, a University of New Mexico computer science major and a member of the Society of Women Engineers, also plans to start competing in beauty pageants. (Marla Brose/Albuquerque Journal)\nEileen Pollack, writing in The New York Times, said University of Washington psychologists found that women interested in computer science are deterred by the stereotype that a successful engineer is a socially awkward man, wearing a superhero T-shirt, whose genetic code demands that he write computer code.\n“The myth is only brainiacs become engineers, especially male brainiacs,” said Karen Houliston, a St. Pius X High School graduate who is in her first year of engineering at Texas Tech, where 10 percent of her classmates are women.\nHouliston has found there is some truth to the stereotypes. Some of her high school math and science teachers were science fiction fans who decorated their offices with action figures.\nMale engineering students seem to want to take care of women rather than watch them succeed. “It’s hard for women like me, who are colorful and expressive,” she said. “I can’t sit still at a football game. I can’t talk comics.”\n“I do get a couple of ‘why-are-you-heres’ sometimes,” said third-year UNM computer science student Brooke Ayala, a La Cueva High School graduate. Ayala shares a fondness for science fiction and some other interests with male students. “I am also interested in fashion,” she said. “I love reading about subjects they are not necessarily interested in.” And she plans to enter some beauty pageants.\nYoung girls, and boys, for that matter, don’t go into engineering because they don’t know any engineers, said Rochelle Larson, who grew up in a small town on the Navajo Nation and got her master’s degree in environmental engineering from UNM. She has worked for seven years at an international consulting engineering firm. Last week, she went to two schools as part of her volunteer work with the Society of Women Engineers to encourage kids to choose engineering.\nHouliston, Ayala and Larson all had engineers in the family, all had strong female role models, and all of them loved mathematics in high school. None had any hesitation about studying engineering.\nKaren Houliston, a St. Pius X High School graduate and a freshman studying engineering at Texas Tech, said, “It’s hard for women like me, who are colorful and expressive.” (Courtesy of Nann Winter)\nWomen approach engineering problems differently, Larson said. They take more time to weigh more options. They look at problems more holistically than men do.\n“Men are more straightforward, more literal,” Ayala said. “They go to the most efficient approach.” Women look for ways their solutions will relate to other fields. Ayala always wants to know how someone from a different discipline will use a program she writes.\nChecci thinks engineering programs need to stop emphasizing the opportunity for math and science whizzes to use their skills and start nurturing a love of problem-solving.\n“It pains me deeply, but women say they want to be in a field where they can help people,” Checci said. “We are not conveying that the point of engineering is to make the world a better place.”\nHouliston, Ayala and Larson expect to make the world a better place. Larson improves community water supplies and sanitation while protecting the environment.\n“I was attracted by how computer science applies to online banking, cybersecurity, really any business,” Ayala said. “You don’t know where computer science will be five years from now, 10 years from now. Everything is changing. It’s globally relevant.”\nHouliston wants to find ways to bring cheap, appropriate, efficient, environmentally responsible energy to developing countries.\n“Engineering comes with a lot of power,” she said. “My mom always said I’d change the world somehow.”\nUpFront is a daily front-page news and opinion column.
