Former NBA star Lamar Odom, passed out on a brothel bed at the Love Ranch in Crystal, Nevada.\"It was one of those things. I know CPR. My first thought was, 'do I need to do it'. I called 911,\" said Hunter.Hunter is the media assistant at Love Ranch. He says as Pahrump emergency responders rushed to the scene, he was talking to 911 dispatch. \"They told me to keep him on his side, so myself and the other people in the room we kept on his side. He's a very big guy,\" said Hunter. \"Whatever got him into that condition it's a complete surprise to anybody that walks in here.\"Hunter says the former Laker star was in the company of two women for a four-day party at the Love Ranch. On Tuesday, one of the women discovered Odom unconscious. Dennis Hof owns the brothel and tells News 3 that Odom was enjoying himself and that nobody in the brothel ever saw Odom doing drugs. He was just out there partying with all the girls coming into the bar. He wanted to sleep. Come have some drinks,\" said Hof.Hunter says the brothel does supply herbal Viagra upon request. Odom was found with the substance and a bottle of cognac at his bedside. \"It's a legal OTC supplement. My understanding was this is coming from the girls who were with him. They thought he took ten of them over a three-day period,\" said Hunter. \"Our concern is the amount of time that he had alone with anything he might have had.\"Hunter says he has no idea how long Odom was by himself in his VIP suite before he was found by the staff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T01:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:11:14.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
