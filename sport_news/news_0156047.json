Capt. Jacques labreouer, Robbie Campo and I headed south of Shell Beach to fish the marshes around Lake Robin.\nWhat we found was nearly a different fish every cast. Great variety and fun, not to mention the tasty choices we took home. What do you need? A rod, a reel, a few live shrimp and a popping cork.\nSigns of fall fishing in Shell Beach getting better and better if you come out here, and the speckled trout will turn on any day now. Fantastic fishing!\nCopyright 2015 WVUE. ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:42:10.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
