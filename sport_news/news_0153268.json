A new emblem will be chosen in open competition. \nThe decision came less than a month after Tokyo scrapped its plans for the new National Stadium, set to be the centrepiece of the Games, as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sought to soothe public anger over costs that had more than doubled from original estimates. \nThe decision prompted concern from the IOC, which said it would oversee the new tender, but Coates said he had been assured it would be completed by January 2020, as the IOC had requested, leaving time for tests and other preparations. \nA second competition for the stadium design is set to be held later this year, with construction to start early next year and completion slated for early in 2020, a year later than originally planned. Zaha Hadid Architects, which came up with the first design, has opted not to take part again. \nTokyo has also reneged on a pledge to keep most venues within eight kilometres of the Olympic Village in order to cut costs. Some are so far away athletes will have to stay in separate quarters. \nBut the city got some encouragement from London mayor Boris Johnson, whose city hosted the 2012 Games and who said at a news conference that London had confidence that Tokyo will be able to pull it off. \n\"Large parts of the media, large parts of the media will remain resolutely sceptical, if not hostile...\" he said in a later speech. \n\"Suddenly, as the event itself draws near, their mood will change and it will be as if the sun has come out.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T13:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:34:25.774+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
