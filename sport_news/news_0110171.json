And the wins keep coming. \nPlaying in a neighborhood battle for the Fireman's Bell, the Thoroughbreds put a running clock on host Newport then ran the Wildcats off the field with a 48-8 Class 2A district win at Newport Stadium. \nJacob Smith keyed the Thoroughbreds' attack while zooming up the school's career rushing yardage list. The running back rambled for 260 yards on 15 rushes. He averaged 17.3 yards per carry while pushing his season total to 1,084, his third straight 1,000-yard season. \nRelated: NewCath schedule, stats \nSmith scored a pair of touchdowns, one on a 61-yard first-quarter scamper that put NewCath on the board, the other on a three-yard run for a 28-0 Thoroughbreds lead with 5:30 to go before halftime. He entered play fifth on NewCath's all-time rushing list and finished the contest third all-time, with 3,886 yards. \nThe senior standout needs 347 yards to move into second place on the school's all-time list. He ran for 124 yards, 89 on one carry, during a single drive Friday, the result of NewCath negative penalty yardage on the possession. The Thoroughbreds scored four plays after the big run, on John Harris' second rushing touchdown of the game. That helped give them a 42-0 lead and the advantage of a running clock with 4:06 left in the third quarter.
