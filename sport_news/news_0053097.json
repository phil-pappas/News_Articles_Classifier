That was reasoning behind Dipoto's decision to fire manager Lloyd McClendon on Friday after two seasons. Instead of moving forward with someone who had differing baseball views, Dipoto will start his tenure in Seattle with someone he chooses. \"Everything we do is as a group,\" Dipoto said. \"This isn't an indictment of Lloyd. This is a representation of what we would like to build going forward. That is what we'll do.\" McClendon's firing was far from a surprise and came less than a week after the Mariners concluded a disappointing 76-86 season. Seattle started the year with expectations of contending in the AL West and reaching the postseason, but instead finished in fourth place in the division. Dipoto was hired during the final week of the regular season to replace Jack Zduriencik and said he would take his time evaluating whether McClendon would return. McClendon was under contract for the 2016 season. Dipoto said he has great respect for McClendon but realized in meetings this week and last that their baseball philosophies would not be the best match going forward. \"This was an opportunity to come into an organization and create a vision and I feel like this is the best way to do that,\" Dipoto said. Seattle was McClendon's second chance as a manager and he raised hopes of a turnaround after the Mariners went 87-75 in his first season and missed the playoffs by one game. But Seattle could not sustain the success from the first season. McClendon was 163-161 in his two seasons with the Mariners and was the only black manager in baseball. Dipoto's decision means Seattle will have its 10th manager — full time and interim — since the club's last playoff appearance in 2001.
