The top five runners who are not a part of one of the top three teams earn a bid to the state meet. \n“I was really happy for her,” LHS coach Brian Anderson said. “She’s worked hard for it. She tried to step it up at the end of the race.” \nJones admitted to being nervous going into her first regional cross country meet, but she was able to remain calm as she carried out her simple race plan. \n“I was trying to keep up with the people in front of me, and catch up to them and stay with them,” Jones said. \nFreshman Anna DeWitt joined Jones in the top 35, placing 31st with a time of 21:21.7 to help pace the Lawrence High girls to a seventh-place finish. \nJones will be joined at the state meet by the varsity squads of regional champion Shawnee Mission North, SM Northwest and SM West. SMNW’s Molly Born won the individual title with a time of 18:40.0. \nThe 6A girls race will be at 11:45 a.m. Saturday at Rim Rock Farm. Class 3A, 5A and 6A will all be competing at Rim Rock, with the 5A boys kicking off the meet at 10 a.m. \nPederson pushes boys \nThe Lawrence High boys also tallied a seventh-place finish, with senior Nathan Pederson leading the way. \nPederson clocked in with a time of 17:34.4, good for 31st place. “We pushed ourselves pretty hard, and we did pretty well,” Pederson said.

We improved quite a bit.” \nThe LHS senior missed out on qualifying for the state meet for the third consecutive year, but Anderson applauded Pederson for the leadership he has displayed over the past four years. \n“He’s had a good run,” Anderson said. “He’s had a lot of good races, and qualified for state a couple of times.” \nSophomore Carson Jumping Eagle and junior Garrett Prescott also broke the 18-minute barrier with respective times of 17:48.7 (33rd place) and 17:59.7 (36th place). \nSM North’s boys squad followed the lead of the girls team, and edged Shawnee Mission East by one point for first place. SMN’s boys and girls team also swept the Sunflower League Championships Oct. 17 at Rim Rock. SM North brothers Belesti and Alex Akalu took the top two spots at Saturday’s regional with respective times of 15:19.0 and 16:13.0. \nCLASS 6A REGIONAL \nSaturday at Haskell Indian Nations University \nTop three teams qualify for state \nTop five individuals not on top three team qualify for state \nBOYS \nTeam scores: Shawnee Mission North 41, Shawnee Mission East 43, Shawnee Mission Northwest 68, Shawnee Mission South 101, Shawnee Mission West 124, Olathe Northwest 154, Lawrence High 180. \nLawrence High results: 14.
