And, with that, the Class 2A No. 4 Trojans took their only lead of the night in a 24-22 victory against the ninth-ranked Raiders. \n“We took the tackle out to get another DB in,” Shenandoah coach Scott Widner said. “We didn’t have anybody over center, and he just ran it.” \nIt was a brutal end for the Raiders (7-3), who advanced to the sectional championship game in each of the past five seasons and appeared to be well on their way to an upset victory on this night. \nUncharacteristic penalties cost Shenandoah dearly in the second half. The Raiders were flagged eight times for 80 yards, with none bigger than the horse-collar tackle called in front of the Trojans’ sideline just before Leininger’s game-winning run. \nA holding penalty backed Tri-Central up to Shenandoah’s 41-yard line with just over 30 seconds remaining. Leininger was flushed from the pocket and scrambled toward his own sideline just inside the 40-yard line. A Raider defender made contact with his upper shoulder pad as the pair were heading out of bounds and pulled him down as the play completed. \nThe resulting flag moved the ball to the 24-yard line and no longer made it a neccessity for the Trojans to throw the ball. On the next play, Leininger crossed the goal line untouched with 20 seconds left. \nShenandoah made a last-ditch effort, with Brennan Dowden completing a pass to Dylan Cronk at the Tri-Central 41 with 8.7 seconds to play. But a deep incompletion and an intentional grounding penalty ended the game. \n“They made more plays tonight,” Widner said. “They made one more play than we did.” \nThe Raiders led 14-0 at the half after forcing three turnovers and getting a 15-yard touchdown run by Dalton Hatcher and a 19-yard scoring pass from Dowden to Patrick Resler, who made a beautiful one-handed catch in the end zone. \nTri-Central got on the board with a 10-play, 87-yard drive after Shenandoah went three-and-out to start the third quarter. The march was capped by a 16-yard pass from Leininger to Brendon Groves on one of just three completions for the quarterback. \nA 2-point conversion made it 14-8, but Hatcher responded with a 70-yard touchdown run on the ensuing drive and added the 2-point conversion for a 22-8 lead. \nHatcher finished with 120 rushing yards on 12 carries and had three catches for 48 yards. \nCody Colbert, one of three Trojans over the century mark with 104 yards rushing, scored on a 13-yard run with 1:40 left in the third quarter, and Dillon Smith added the 2-point run to cut the deficit to 22-16. \nThe only other points before the game’s final minute came on a bad snap during a Shenandoah punt attempt that resulted in a safety. \n“I thought we played hard,” Widner said. “I thought we played well enough to win. Sometimes, that’s just how it goes.” \nSmith finished with 111 yards on 19 carries for Tri-Central, and Leininger added 104 yards on 13 attempts. \nThe Raiders made some big plays in the passing game, with Dowden finishing 7-of-14 for 140 yards and one score. He had a long completion of 48 yards to Hatcher and added a 37-yarder to Joe Huff and a 24-yarder to Wayde Stiers. \nLinebacker Cody Rudy, playing in his final game for Shenandoah, intercepted a pass at the Raiders’ 15-yard line on the final play of the first half and broke up a third-down pass to help stall at Tri-Central drive at the 26-yard line with 5:22 remaining in the game. \nShenandoah picked up a first down on the ensuing drive but punted the ball away with 2:27 to play. Tri-Central began the game-winning drive at its own 14 with two timeouts and 2:17 left. \nAfter the game, the Raiders seniors lined up in the end zone to form a handshake line from their teammates. It’s a tradition under Widner and one Dowden used as an opportunity to address his fellow underclassmen. \n“They started something here,” Dowden said, motioning to the nine seniors — Bobby Pierce, Cody Beck, Cory Day, Cameron Conner, Rudy, Kyle Baker, Jordan Koontz, Gage New and Cronk — standing behind him. “Now, it’s time to build on it. It starts tomorrow.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T07:05:27.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
