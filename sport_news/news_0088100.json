They notched their most lopsided win since blowing out the Jayhawks 34-0 in 2013. \nIowa State stretched its lead to 24-0 early in the second half on Warren's 62-yard TD run, the longest of his career. Warren's 7-yard score with 11:34 left made it 38-13. \nMontell Cozart was 15-of-21 passing for 150 yards before leaving with a sprained left shoulder. \nMarcquis Roberts had an 83-yard interception return for a score for Kansas (0-4, 0-1). \nThere was plenty of talk this week that this game might be the worst Power Five matchup of the year. \nFor much of the first half, it didn't disappoint. \nIowa State's offense couldn't get out of its own way in the early going, scoring just three points in the opening 24 minutes. But Richardson broke the drought on a 4-yard TD run through a hole that, thanks to a little misdirection and an over-aggressive Kansas defense, was at least 15 yards wide. \nThe Jayhawks then jumped offside on a crucial third-and-3 on their own 14, giving the Cyclones a fresh set of downs. They only needed one, as Richardson found Allen Lazard for a 9-yard touchdown and a 17-0 lead. \nWarren followed with his long touchdown run — a play on which he was never touched until his teammates met him the end zone — to make it 24-0. \nWarren needed just 18 carries to match the best day by an Iowa State back since Ryan Koch had 175 yards against Missouri in 2006. \nKansas finally got on the board when Cozart found Tre Parmelee for a 47-yard TD pass. \nBut the point-after try bounced off the upright. The subsequent kickoff bounced out of bounds — and Parmalee muffed a punt that Iowa State recovered midway through the fourth quarter. \nKansas also ran for just 38 yards. \nFollow Luke Meredith on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/LukeMeredithAP and on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/LukeMeredithAP \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T22:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T23:06:30.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
