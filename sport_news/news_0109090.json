That loophole led to some skewed salaries.\nAdChoices The new CBA put a limit on that loophole, but we still have a number of players who have contracts that pay a lot more money up front, meaning the players who make the most are typically the players who are still in the first years of their deals.\nThis year's list of the NHL's highest-paid players includes eight wingers, seven centers, three defensemen, and two goaltenders.\nHere are the 20 players who will make at least $7.9 million this season, with data provided by Spotrac.\n#1 Shea Weber — $14 million\n© Provided by Business Insider\nTeam : Nashville Predators\nPosition: Defenseman\n2015-16 earnings breakdown: $1 million salary, $13 million signing bonus\nOne thing to know: Weber was one of the last NHL players to exploit a loophole in the old collective bargaining agreement, signing a $110 million contract. The catch is that the deal is 14 years long and heavily front-loaded, not expiring until he is 40 years. The benefit to the team was to spread the salary cap hit out over many years. This practice was nixed in the newest CBA, with contracts now limited to eight years.\n#2t Jonathan Toews — $13.8 million\n© Provided by Business Insider Team : Chicago Blackhawks\nPosition: Center\n2015-16 earnings breakdown: $6.8 million salary, $7.0 million signing bonus\nOne thing to know: Toews and teammate Patrick Kane signed identical 8-year, $84 million contracts prior to the 2014-15 season. Their $10.5 million cap hits are the largest in the NHL.\n#2t Patrick Kane — $13.8 million\n© Provided by Business Insider\nTeam : Chicago Blackhawks\nPosition : Right Wing\n2015-16 earnings breakdown: $6.8 million salary, $7.0 million signing bonus\nOne thing to know: The $84 million contracts for Kane and teammate Jonathan Toews are also the largest in the NHL since the new CBA was ratified in early 2013.\n#4 Sidney Crosby — $12 million\n© Provided by Business Insider\nTeam : Pittsburgh Penguins\nPosition: Center\n2015-16 earnings breakdown: $12 million salary\nOne thing to know: Like Shea Weber, Crosby signed his extension just before the new CBA, and his deal is also heavily front-loaded. This is the final of three seasons with $12 million salaries. Starting next season, Crosby's salary starts to shrink, eventually reaching just $3 million in 2022-23, when he will be 35.\n#5t Henrik Lundqvist — $10 million\n© Provided by Business Insider Team: New York Rangers\nPosition: Goaltender\n2015-16 earnings breakdown: $10 million salary\nOne thing to know: Even with the new limitations on contracts, Lundqvist's new 7-year, $59.5 million contract is proof that teams still like to front-load these deals.
