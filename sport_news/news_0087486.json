The Mets and Cubs, on the eve of this NLCS, find themselves in that middle ground. They've made it to baseball's Final Four, further than all but a handful of dreamers predicted, but remain eight wins away from a World Series ring. \nImpressive? Sure. Both teams showed what elite young talent is capable of doing by taking the training wheels off early. Latest columns Lennon: Kershaw makes Game 4 a grinder \nThe Mets rely on a rotation of kids, starting with Noah Syndergaard at 22 up to Jacob deGrom, the elder statesman, at 27. The Cubs have used a twenty-something wrecking crew of Kyle Schwarber (22), Kris Bryant (23) and Anthony Rizzo (26). Vote Mets vs. Cubs: Who has the edge? \nWith so much youth and so much talent, the temptation is to imagine budding National League dynasties, with affordable players under team control for the next few years, at least. But if the Mets and Cubs know anything, it's not to take such things for granted. \nThere hasn't been a trophy in Flushing since Jesse Orosco flung his glove skyward to finish the 1986 title on the Shea Stadium mound. \nAs for the Cubs, well, there's no need to go into much detail there. Suffice to say, they haven't been to a World Series since losing to the Tigers in 1945. Otherwise, for Citi Field fans looking for a derisive number to taunt their Second City visitors with, it's 1908. \n  \nThese two franchises, more than most, have to respect the process. There is the 162-game thinning of the herd -- in the Cubs' case, a winner-take-all wild-card game, too -- followed by the ultra-pressurized best-of-five Division Series. The mistake, however, would be to assume this is only a step in the maturation of these still-developing teams. \nRight now, it no longer matters how the Mets and Cubs got to the NLCS, or what that means for potentially brighter days at Citi or Wrigley. The window always closes sooner than anyone thinks, leaving the loser to wonder what might have been. Mets Mets ready for Cubs in the NLCS \n\"We like how we're set up for the future,\" Sandy Alderson said Friday. \"But there's no guarantee going forward.\" \nJust look at the casualty rate for young pitching staffs. Three of the Mets' four playoff starters already have had Tommy John surgery, and another one being counted on for 2016 -- Zack Wheeler -- currently is rehabbing from it. Teams remain at the mercy of the sport's unforgiving demands on promising pitchers. \nThe Mets also appear willing to let NLDS hero Daniel Murphy walk when this season eventually ends. No big shock there, but after Murphy almost single-handedly sunk the Dodgers -- homering twice off Clayton Kershaw and ripping Zack Greinke for the Game 5 winner -- who's to say how much his absence could affect the Mets next year? \nNot to mention the strong likelihood that Yoenis Cespedes will secure his big payday elsewhere after being the Mets' second-half MVP. \nFactor these things in, along with the Mets' insistence on keeping the payroll in the middle of the MLB pack, and there's no telling if this NLCS trip will prove to be the start of a mid-October ritual or an infrequent, comet-like occurrence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:43:23.371+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
