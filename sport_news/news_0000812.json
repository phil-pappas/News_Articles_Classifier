A focus on 10 specific observations from the weekend’s action that will help you build your fantasy team in the short and long term. \nAll set? Here goes for Week 7: 1) Arian Foster goes down \nArian Foster was having a solid day in garbage time, along with teammates Brian Hoyer and Nate Washington , and then in an instant his season was over in a meaningless name. Such is the nature of garbage time in Texas. As for the future of the RB position in Houston, Alfred Blue led the team in carries in two of the three games before Foster made it into the lineup this year and is the best bet to pick up the bulk of the work moving forward. \nIn reality though, the only thing that is of fantasy interest the rest of the way is the garbage time passing game. DeAndre Hopkins owners will no doubt be disappointed with his six reception, 50 yard outing but it should be noted that he still saw double digit targets this week (12) and should be even moreso a part of the offense without Foster to take 20+ touches a week. This week was Nate Washington ‘s time to shine, and indeed opponents will shift coverage to Hopkins leaving opportunities for Washington and company the rest of the way, but, for Hopkins owners the Foster injury is straight positive news. In short, things are going to keep getting worse in Houston (they won’t all be lopsided 40 burger losses, mind you) which will leave the team consistently looking to their best playmaker in the second half. 2) Vintage Darren McFadden /Dallas O-line \nDallas’ offensive line turned back the clock to 2014, while DMC turned a few more cranks on the Marty-McFly-ometer to deliver a gutty rushing performance against the Giants. The G-men don’t have the strongest front seven in the league, but, with Joseph Randle down McFadden put the Cowboys offense on his back and kept them in the game against New York. \nAll told, he finished with 29 carries for 152 yards, adding two receptions. His biggest point of intrigue coming into the week revolved around the passing game, but, with big holes opening up and McFadden hitting them hard with his upright running style, he put a big number on the board. \nA poor pass interference penalty took back a receiving TD, and, Matt Cassel ‘s three interceptions capped the productiveness of the Dallas offense but McFadden looked sharp enough to expect him to stay engaged in the offense next week and beyond. The RB position in Dallas should be particularly lucrative when Tony Romo returns. 3) Todd Gurley a top-5 ROS RB? \nYes, he is. Gurley joined Devonta Freeman as guys who cost you nothing at the draft table and are now weekly must starts. You don’t need me recounting the pre-season expectations around him being eased into the offense as that thought is long gone. Gurley showcased his A+ athleticism this week, bursting a long (48 yard) gain in the second half, and leaping over a tackler for a 12 yard gain early. He scored twice in the red zone as well, once from the goal line, affirming that he’s the every situation back in St. Louis. Set it and forget it with Gurley. Benny Cunningham had just four carries behind him, while Gurley finished with 23 total touches. \nThe league’s twitter account accurately sums up his multiple dimensions: His name’s @TG3II . He’ll juke you. Or he’ll truck you. Or sometimes he’ll hurdle you. At full speed. #CLEvsSTL https://t.co/jGsY45EprV 4) Rishard Matthews stays hot \nJarvis Landry scored twice, including a winding run through the entire Houston defense and Lamar Miller was the true story of the day – posting a huge stat line for the second consecutive game (coinciding with the start of the Dan Campbell era) – but Matthews shouldn’t be overlooked. He scored a first quarter TD on a short slant route that he took 53 yards to the house between two defenders (while outrunning three). All told, Matthews finished with just three targets (catching all of them) but the game just didn’t necessitate his involvement. He’s cemented as the number two receiver on a Dolphins offense that could be quite potent if they’ve indeed turned their season around. Last week, Kenny Stills was tabbed the starter and had just two targets. This week, he didn’t catch a ball. Matthewis, it is. 5) Lombardi, the view from above \nWhile Minnesota’s defense eventually shut down the Lions’ offense, Detroit got rolling early and their play makers had a good day. Specifically, Calvin Johnson and Eric Ebron each scored in the opening frame, setting up their own scores with long catches in the middle of the field. That Johnson has scored twice in the last two weeks with Joe Lombardi calling plays from the booth as opposed to the sidelines should be viewed as a positive. As was made clear today, it won’t help the Lions’ overall fortunes this year, but, it looks like it should lead to a more productive offense from a fantasy perspective. 6) Stefon Diggs cemented as starter \nThere was much speculation as to whether Diggs could keep his hot play going, and, whether Charles Johnson would cut into his workload upon his return. Well, speculate no more. For the third straight week, Diggs was the most effective Vikings receiver – moreso than fellow starter Mike Wallace , let alone Johnson. \nDiggs finished with 108 yards on six receptions, and scored a 36 yard TD. He made a great diving catch on the score, but needed to do so only because of the throw from Teddy Bridgewater , Diggs was running wide open over the top after beating his man off the line with a double move. You’ll love his matchup in Week 8 (the Bears) and you’ll want to have added him last week as Diggs is looking like a solid rest of season contributor on an under appreciated Minnesota offense. 7) Danny Amendola still involved \nI noted last week that Amendola’s usage appeared to be a function of Julian Edelman ‘s injury more than anything else. This week, it may have been a result of the fact that New England had abandoned the run as a function of game plan well before the first snap, but, here we are with another big outing from Amendola. \nAgain, it seems unlikely to continue given the many mouths to feed ( Dion Lewis as a receiver; Gronk; Edelman; and Brandon LaFell , despite a six drop debut on eight targets) but as it stands right now Amendola should have your attention. \nHe made a number of exceptional catches, including a leaping grab on a high ball that I wouldn’t have expected a 6’1″ receiver to bring in, let alone Amendola and is becoming a trustworthy target for Brady. He caught seven balls on nine targets a week ago, and went 8/9 this week for 80 yards with a score. \nHe’d be a dice roll in Week 7, but, those starting early contests could find savings if they trusted the target load to stay up. 8) Charcandrick West leaves no doubt \nWith Jeremy Maclin out of the lineup, West put the Kansas City offense on his back and paced the Chiefs with 22 carries for 110 yards and a score. Knile Davis had one carry. I was somewhat worried that his fumble last week would leave the door open to a hot hand situation in Week 7, but, West left little doubt this week. West looked his best when running on the outside, with sharp cuts and burst in and out of his breaks but also had some tough runs up the middle and made a number of plays in short yardage, including leaping into the endzone for his score. \nWest is no Charles, but, he’s doing his part and should remain the focal point of the offense in the weeks ahead. 9) Andrew Luck is bad right now \nWhether he’s playing hurt (more likely) or regressing, Luck has not been an effective passer this season. He was able to salvage his fantasy day in a game that Indianapolis trailed from jump, but, couldn’t get anything going in the second half and missed a number of open throws. Again, his final fantasy scoring helps mask this – as does the production of TY Hilton – but Luck targeted his top receiver fifteen times on the day and the pair were able to connect just four times. Two of them were for long TDs, but, that hardly paints an accurate picture. With tough matchups against Carolina and Denver looming, there are better options out there for luck owners in Weeks 8 and 9. 10) The end of Alf Morris \nShort of calling for his release from your fantasy roster, I’m emphatically stating that you can’t start Alfred Morris in any circumstance right now. Mired in a three headed monster RB attack, he has just 103 yards on 32 carries since the start of October. \nThis week, with one of those heads ( Chris Thompson ) held out against Tampa Bay, all of the pregame hype was on backfield mate Matt Jones . As it turned out, Jones’ three reception, nine carry outing was nothing to write home about but it effectively spelled the end of Morris’ influence in Washington. Alf had three carries for -3 yards early, and wound up with just six for five on the day. \nWith a bye ahead, and a matchup against New England coming in Week 9 (and thus, a likelihood of trailing and turning to the passing down backs) the time is right for Morris owners to find other options at RB.
