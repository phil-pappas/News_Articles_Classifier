There was another bag of drugs on the ground that apparently had been thrown down, police said, but officers couldnâ€™t determine who it belonged to. \nHunt, 28, was arrested and charged with possession of cocaine. He has since been released on bond. \nThe Tampa Bay Rowdies signed Willie Hunt on Wednesday, Oct. 7. He played for the Rowdies in 2014, making 12 appearances, including 11 starts.
