(AP) — Samaje Perine ran for 201 yards and four touchdowns and helped quarterback Baker Mayfield top his old team as No. 17 Oklahoma defeated Texas Tech 63-27 on Saturday. \nMayfield transferred from Tech after his freshman season in 2013 and had to sit out last year because the school blocked his ability to play right away. \nMayfield completed 15 of 22 passes for 212 yards and two touchdowns. Joe Mixon ran for 154 yards and two scores, and the Sooners (6-1, 3-1 Big 12) ran for 405 yards. \nTexas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes passed for 233 yards and ran for 58, but threw four interceptions. DeAndre Washington ran for 94 yards and a touchdown for the Red Raiders (5-3, 2-3). \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball@ap.org \n___ \nFollow Cliff Brunt on Twitter: www.twitter.com/CliffBruntAP Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:39:10.614+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
