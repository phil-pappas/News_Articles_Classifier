Buy this photo photo courtesy of rick gray The celebration is on for the Millburn High School varsity girls tennis team after the first doubles team of Isabella Waung and Sydney Zirlin provided the clinching point in the sectional final against West Windsor-Plainsboro South High School. \nMillburn's first doubles team of Sydney Zirlin and Isabella Waung recorded a victory in three sets, clinching the victory at 3-1. \n\"Wow,\" exclaimed Miller head coach Bill Wickenheisser the morning after the match. \n\"This was one of the best matches I have ever been involved in and it was a doozy of a sectional final.\" \nMillburn's first points were provided by Stephanie Schrage at first singles and the second doubles team of Elizabeth Gray and Anna Mandel. \nSchrage cruised to a 6-1, 6-0 defeat of Claudia Siniakowicz. \nGray and Mandel's 6-0, 6-4 defeat of Michelle Wong and Manogna Konduri left Millburn needing to win one of the final three matches to gain a berth in the Group 3 semifinals. \nWest Windsor-Plainboro South's Caroline Zhou shaved Millburn's advantage to 2-1 with a 6-4, 5-7 defeat of Joanna Atwater at third singles. \nClose to an hour following the conclusion of the third singles match, Zirlin and Waung ended the suspense with a 6-4, 4-6, 6-3 defeat of Kimberly Wong and Stephanie Ji. \n\"I am so proud of the girls,\" Wickenheisser said. \"With only two returning starters (Schrage and Zirlin) this was a huge accomplishment for us. This will give us a lot of confidence.\" \nThe second singles match, with the team outcome decided, went to a super tiebreaker in the third set. \nWest Windsor-Plainsboro South's Angela Weng outlasted Alex Pritsker 6-7 (6-8), 7-6 (8-6), 10-4. \n\"We were able to take care of business and now we get ready for the next step,\" Wickenheisser said. \nThe next step is a meeting with North Jersey, Section 1 winner Northern Highlands Regional High School today, Oct. 15, in the Group 3 semifinals at 9 a.m. at Mercer County Park. \nCentral Jersey champion Moorestown High School opposes South Jersey champion Mainland Regional High School in the other 9 a.m. semifinal. \nThe semifinal winners return at 1 p.m. to vie for a berth in next week's NJSIAA Tournament of Champions. \nEmail: connellyj@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:28:52.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
