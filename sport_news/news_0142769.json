He probably won't get another opportunity with the Pittsburgh Steelers .\nThe placekicker missed two important field goals in the fourth quarter of the Steelers 23-20 loss in overtime to the Baltimore Ravens Thursday night.\nPittsburgh coach Mike Tomlin, with no confidence in Scobee during the overtime period, opted to try and convert a fourth-and-one situation from the Baltimore 39 instead of attempting a field goal. The Steelers failed on the attempt and the Ravens regained possession and eventually kicked the game-winning field goal.\n\"I wanted to redeem myself, but I didn't get it,\"Scobee told reporters after the game. \"I feel like I let the team down. It's a bad feeling.\"\nScobee did convert on two field goals earlier in the game, but the misses in the fourth quarter prevented the Steelers from adding to their lead.\nTomlin said the coaching staff will \"have to turn the stones over\" in an effort to win games.\nThat's not a good sign for Scobee, who was acquired in a trade with Jacksonville after longtime kicker Shaun Suisham suffered a season-ending knee injury during the Hall of Fame game in August.\nThere are plenty of unemployed placekickers available in the NFL. It's likely the Steelers will start holding auditions in the coming days.\n\"I can't think about that stuff,\" Scobee said. \"I just have to let it play out.\"\n-- Geoffrey C.
