Ortega Gaines ogaines@charlotteobserver.com i Order Reprint of this Story \nGo ahead and put North Mecklenburg’s Brad Baker on the N.C. coach of the year watch lists. \nAfter a 3-8 season in 2014, this season’s Vikings are two wins away from winning the MECKA conference, the toughestin North Carolina. \nFriday’s 20-14 upset of No. 7 Vance registers as one of the biggest wins ever for a school that has exactly one N.C. Western Regional championship appearance – under legendary coach Will Campagna in 1992 – and just four seasons with 10 or more wins in 55 years. \nOn Friday, North Meck quarterback Kendall Coles sparked the upset, connecting on 7 of 11 passes for 82 yards and a touchdown pass. He rushed 11 times for 49 yards and the winning touchdown. \nBaker’s boys have won seven of their past eight games to secure the school’s first winning season since 2006 and the most wins since 2006. And if North Meck can upset conference unbeaten Hough at home next Friday, it could be facing conference heavyweight Mallard Creek in two weeks for the league title. \nTrust me, no one saw these Vikings coming.
