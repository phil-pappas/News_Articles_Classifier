Twelve were at least 80. People are taking up running at later ages and continuing to run well into their senior years.\nSo why are people exercising more in their later years? Rather than posing the risk of injuries to joints and tendons, studies have shown exercise does the exact opposite. Regular exercise also helps to maintain aerobic capacity, muscle strength and bone density while also helps to lower the risks of arthritis, depression and cognitive impairment.\nThe abundance of 55-and-older communities has also helped to keep senior citizens fit. At any age, doing an activity is much more fun when you have company, and I love seeing the small groups of walkers and bikers cruise around the community across the street from me.\nAt any age, jumping into a new exercise program can cause problems. Before starting, see your doctor. Make sure you are honest about what you are planning to do, whether it be running, biking, swimming, etc., and get any tests done to make sure you are cleared to proceed. Also, your doctor may need to give you parameters for you to stay within when you exercise. The goal is to improve your health, not to make yourself sick.\nIf exercise is a new thing in your life, start very slowly. Walking is a great way to stay fit. You can add short spurts of jogging and gradually lengthen the time jogging while decreasing the walking time. Eventually, you may be able to jog the entire time, but if that never happens and all you do is walk, that’s fantastic, too.\nMany runners who compete in 5Ks and marathons actually “run-walk” them. For seniors, this is a great way to complete the distance, as it is easier on joints and muscles.\nWater aerobics, rowing machine, biking and swimming also are great options. Lifting weights is essential in maintaining muscle mass, as well as increasing metabolism, which helps to maintain a healthy weight and to keep blood sugar in check. Some basic, low-impact weight exercises include squats, arm curls, wall or aided push-ups, side and front arm raises, toe raises and leg lifts while holding onto a chair.\nDoing some light to moderate weight exercises one to two times a week can be optimal.\nStudies show that older people are not more at risk for heart attacks from exercise than younger people, so know the risks and symptoms.\nRunning local 5Ks and training for marathons are amazing accomplishments for anyone, and especially for someone over the age of 50.\nHowever, training and racing are not the only reasons to exercise. Your overall quality of life comes first.\nFormer Olympic runner Vicki Huber Rudawsky’s column appears biweekly in The News Journal.
