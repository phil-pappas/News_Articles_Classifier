The match, that concluded here on Thursday, ended the Danish campaign on a low note as the Portuguese No.8 flashed in the winner in the 66th minute. Denmark are now one point ahead of Albania in the group. Albania play against hosts Armenia on Sunday knowing only a victory will deny the Danes the second automatic qualifying place. There was little difference between the teams throughout the match . The hosts though slowly gained the upper hand and midfielder Nani almost broke the deadlock moments before the interval when his looping header struck the crossbar. Denmark took the contest to the home side after the restart as striker Nicklas Bendtner crashed a shot against the post after controlling smartly on his chest. Portugal fought back and forced a good save from goalkeeper Kasper Schmeichel. But he could do nothing when Moutinho collected a clearance on the edge of the box, cut inside a defender and rifled the ball into the corner with his right foot.
