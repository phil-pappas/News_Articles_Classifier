The Hornets scored the first points of the game on a 16-yard fumble return for a touchdown on the first play from scrimmage, scored on a blocked punt and added four offensive touchdowns.“I think that first play was detrimental to what little fight and confidence we might have had,” Wheeler coach Mike Collins said. “I was interested to see how we would respond because that really deflated us. We went one, two, three, punt and then they went up 14-0, and the rest was pretty much history.”Roswell scored on all but one of its first-half possessions, held a 42-0 lead at halftime and did not face a fourth down until late in the third quarter. However, Collins said he was proud of how his team never gave in to the onslaught.“I thought they fought hard in the second half. They had an opportunity to come out and just go through the motions, but they came out and I think every player tried to get a little better in the second half,” Collins said. “I was proud they came back and showed some fight. I just told them that we can’t let this deflate us to where it dictates the rest of our season.”The Hornets (6-0, 4-0) racked up 400 yards of offense and held Wheeler (3-4, 2-3) to 118 yards. The Wildcats gained 65 of those yards on their last drive of the game when they scored their only points of the game. In the other non-offensive touchdown, Roswell’s Tre’ Lamar blocked a Ryles Kirkland punt and fell on the ball in the end zone in the second quarter.Collins said no matter what his team tried to do, Roswell had an answer on defense.“We tried to run the ball because that is key for us, but we couldn’t get out and run it. Then we tried to take a few shots to see if we could loosen them up and they got a pick. When you can shut down the run like that and play man coverage on the back end of it that is a tough defense.“They have good players everywhere and they have a good club, so it is going to take a heck-of-a football team to beat them.”Roswell coach John Ford said his team is executing at a high level at this point in the season.“The effort was good. The coaches put in a good game plan and the kids came out and executed it very well,” Ford said.Tailback Sheldon Evans rushed 18 times for 147 yards and a touchdown to lead a Hornets rushing attack that compiled 233 yards and Quintarius Neely completed 9-of-18 passes for 167 yards with three touchdowns and one interception.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:07:22.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
