The more plays an offense runs, the better the opportunity it is for it to make a mistake.But when the offense uses 10, 15 or 20 plays and puts points on the board, it may put the defense in a position from which it can’t recover.“It’s really good if you are on offense,” Kennesaw State coach Brain Bohannon said. “(On defense) it can put your lights out if (the offense) gets six.”The Owls are finding ways to keep defenses on their heels. While they may not always score touchdowns, the long drives that are being put together are having an effect.So far, Kennesaw State (5-1, 1-0 Big South) has had 13 drives of 10 plays or longer. In 11 of those drives, the Owls have put points on the scoreboard. The most recent display was a 20-play, 83-yard march against Gardner-Webb last week. The drive ate up nearly 11 minutes of clock and resulted in a field goal that made it a two-score game in the fourth quarter.“Those drives are good,” Bohannon said. “They help the whole team. Now, (the defense) is playing 50 snaps instead of 70 snaps. If that’s the way it unfolds, it helps our football team. It keeps everybody fresher and gives us a better chance to be successful.”Kennesaw State has had at least one drive of 10 or more plays in each game this season, and it will try to continue that trend tonight when it faces Liberty (3-4, 0-2) in Lynchburg, Virginia. Those drives are a big reason why Kennesaw State is third in the Football Championship Subdivision in third-down conversions (53 percent) and is winning time of possession against their opponents 33:28-27:12.Bohannon, who was an assistant coach for 17 years before launching the Owls’ program, is no stranger to both sides of the equation. “In Dayton, the same thing happened,” Bohannon said, referring to the team’s 31-27 loss last month. “Their offensive line and running back, they took it over. I knew. We were doing everything we can and we can’t stop ’em.”Dayton had a 17-play, 65-yard drive that took 6:58 off the clock. While Kennesaw State responded with a goal-line stand and forced a turnover on downs, it set the tempo for the entire second half.Bohannon has also experienced what a lengthy drive can do for an offense. When he was a wide receivers coach under Paul Johnson at the Naval Academy, he was involved in what remains the longest drive in NCAA history in the number of plays. During the 2004 Emerald Bowl in San Francisco, Navy went on a 26-play, 94-yard drive that lasted 14:26 against New Mexico. Like Kennesaw State’s 20-play drive last Saturday, it ended with a field goal.“We ate up a quarter,” Bohannon said of the Navy drive. “It was one of those marathons.”Kennesaw State will likely need to execute one or two of the long drives to put itself in position to win at Liberty. The three-time defending Big South champion plays a 4-3 defense and is second in the conference, allowing 124.1 rushing yards per game.While the Owls’ rushing offense led by quarterback Trey White will test the Flames’ defense, Liberty quarterback Josh Woodrum has thrown for 1,890 yards and six touchdowns. He leads the conference in total offense at 271.6 yards a game and will likely be the Kennesaw State secondary’s biggest test to date.“It’s another opportunity,” Bohannon said. “It’s a measuring stick for where we are, and they are really good at home. The kids are going to feed off this environment. It’s Liberty. It’s about respect. That in and of itself should be enough.”The game will be the highlight of homecoming weekend at Liberty, with Bohannon anticipating a crowd of 20,000 or more.“I don’t feel like there’s any pressure,” he said. “Let’s go do what we do, cut it loose and have some fun.”ON THE AIR: The 7 p.m. game can be seen on CW69 and heard on KSUOwls.com.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:12:17.667+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
