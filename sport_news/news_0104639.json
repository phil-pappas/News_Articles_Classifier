He had another goal midway through the first period off a centering pass from Larkin. \nLarkin scored 20 seconds into the second to chase Toronto goalie Jonathan Bernier, and Abdelkader completed the hat trick at 3:54 of the period. \nBLACKHAWKS 3, ISLANDERS 2, OT \nNEW YORK (AP) - Patrick Kane scored on a power play at 1:49 of overtime to lift Chicago past New York, spoiling the Islanders’ Brooklyn debut. \nWith the Blackhawks awarded an extra skater after a slashing penalty on the Islanders’ Nick Leddy during the 3-on-3 overtime, Kane sent the puck toward the middle of the net from the right side. \nKane is the subject of a sexual assault investigation in western New York. He hasn’t been charged, and has said he expects to be exonerated. \nKane also scored in the second period, Artem Anisimov added a goal and Corey Crawford stopped 34 shots. John Tavares and Marek Zidlicky scored for the Islanders. \nRANGERS 4, BLUE JACKETS 2 \nCOLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) - Mats Zuccarello had two goals and the New York Rangers scored three times in a 1:17 span in the third period to rally past Columbus. \nBrandon Saad, the Blue Jackets’ blockbuster acquisition in the offseason, scored on a power play at 16:10 of the third to give the Blue Jackets a 2-1 lead in their season opener. \nBut after a Columbus turnover, Oscar Lindberg netted a low shot for his second goal in two games to tie it at 2. Just 17 seconds later, Kevin Hayes made it 3-2 with a shot from the right corner along the end line that found its way past Sergei Bobrovsky. Zuccarello capped the scoring a minute later. \nHenrik Lundqvist finished with 21 saves for New York.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:49:37.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
