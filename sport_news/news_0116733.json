Eagles coach Ken Sparks, who notched his 200th career SAC win, isn't thinking that far ahead.\n\"This was a great win, but I'm not concerned with anything right now but us getting better as a football team,\" Sparks said. \"I think we're doing that.\"\nCarson-Newman came out and moved the ball down the field on its opening possession, but stalled inside the Wingate 5-yard line and turned the ball over on downs. The Bulldogs (6-2, 3-2) took the momentum and turned it into a 16-play, 94-yard drive that ended with a 2-yard run from running back Lawrence Pittman.\nSuch a turn should have put Wingate firmly in control, but TraShaun Ward and the Carson-Newman kick return unit had other ideas. Ward took the ensuing kick and returned it 85 yards for his first career return touchdown, tying the game 7-7.\n\"My part was easy,\" Ward said. \"When I got the ball, there was a big hole and all I had to do was run. The other 10 guys did a great job at blocking and opening it up. I finally got one.\"\nCarson-Newman's defense responded with a three-and-out, helped by an 11-yard sack by Phalen Booker. Booker, along with defensive tackles Jordan Pryce and Brian Bembry, were in Wingate quarterback Kyle Johnson's face on passing downs all game. Booker finished with two sacks and six tackles.\n\"We finally slowed down the rushing game at the end,\" Sparks said. \"They had to throw it and they don't want to throw it and we were able to get some pressure on him.\"\nThe Eagles took a 14-7 lead on a 20-yard run from Jamal Jones to open the second quarter and managed a goal-line stand against the Bulldogs to maintain their seven-point lead at halftime.\n\"This game was fun,\" said Carson-Newman linebacker Sha'Heem Stupart, who finished with 11 tackles. \"We knew we had to make the stops and the offense kept pushing. It was a great team win. We knew we had to get it. We're desperate.\"\nThat desperation helped Carson-Newman respond to every Bulldogs' comeback in the second half, including a disastrous 48-yard fumble return by linebacker Eric Mapoles that set up the go-ahead touchdown pass from Johnson to Grayson Cobb, giving Wingate a 35-28 lead.\nThe Eagles came right back and tied the game 35-35, then after a defensive stop, took the lead on Carson Wise's 33-yard field goal.\nWith 21 seconds to go in regulation, Wingate's Caleb Baird made a 46-yard field goal to send the game into overtime, but couldn't make his field goal attempt in the extra period.\nWise connected from 18 yards out to give C-N the victory.\nAdam Greene is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:54:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:26:48.610+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
