An agreement between the organization and the district was filed with the Tuolumne County Superior Court Tuesday, Superintendent Pat Chabot said. The settlement terms include the organization waiving the right to further appeals and the district agreeing not to file claims to recover legal costs. The lawsuit, filed in October 2014, had just reached its end in the county court when Judge James Boscoe in September denied any further appeals. The group could have taken the case to the 5th District Court of Appeal in Fresno. “Basically we saw a very long road ahead,” said Larry Coombes of CASBA. “This could have held up construction for eight years and we didn’t feel that was the way we should proceed.” The lawsuit — which was revised in May to target only the pool project — had loomed over the entirety of a $23 million Measure J bond initiative passed in 2012 to complete five major renovations, including new classrooms, sports facilities, dining areas and a kitchen. The pending outcome forced the district to work around construction of the pool, an obstacle that architects this summer said stood to pose costly delays to other projects. “We were always in favor of school remodeling,” Coombes said. “Our concern was always the deception the board and bond consultant used in the bond language.” CASBA argued the pool was not specified to voters, and thus in violation of a state law. Despite the settlement, Coombes worries the last year has created a distrust among voters. “They can build their pool, go ahead, but I really fear for further upgrades,” he said. “The real crime is they’re going to be hard pressed to pass another bond.” Chabot announced the settlement Tuesday night at a Sonora Union High School Board of Trustees meeting. Prior to the meeting, Chabot said he would advise the board to move forward as soon as possible. “For the safety of our community we need the pool as soon as possible, our old one is falling apart,” Chabot said. Construction could start as soon as March or April and take 12 to 15 months to complete, Chabot said. The second phase of construction for Measure J has just begun. A second bond was issued at just under $10 million in August and the district is recruiting contractors for work on the track, field and cafeteria. The board will discuss the sale of the third and final installment in the bond to start the pool at the next meeting Tuesday, Nov. 3.
