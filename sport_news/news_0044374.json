Since its inception last fall, the Savannah-Chatham police department’s Violent Crimes Task Force has made 149 felony arrests, 160 misdemeanor arrests and has seized 71 firearms.\nMetro partnered with Georgia State Patrol, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the FBI Task Force, the Chatham County District Attorney’s Office and the U.S Attorney’s Office during the 10-day operation.\nResources also were provided by metro’s Savannah Impact Program, its Undercover Narcotics Investigation Team, the Savannah Area Regional Intelligence Center, precinct investigators, Aviation, K-9, Traffic, patrol officers and the Chatham-Savannah Counter Narcotics Team.\nThe task force has been used seven times in the past year, and the results seem to be getting better, which is encouraging. During the six previous operations, there was an average of 18 felony arrests compared to 41 during the most recent operation, which took place Oct. 1 through Oct. 10. Just as importantly, while the six previous task force campaigns netted an average of seven gun seizures, this month’s operation alone netted 25 firearms seizures.\nThe success of the task force shows collaboration among law enforcement agencies can have an impact on reducing crime. What’s not clear is how the felons nabbed in this most recent crackdown will fare in the court system. As police often note, the same bad actors are often involved in most of the violent crimes that take place in Savannah. It’s time this “catch and release system” ended.\n“Experience tells us that people involved in violent crimes usually participate in a myriad of offenses and will continue their acts of violence until arrested,” Police Chief Joseph Lumpkin said last fall. “We can best protect our community by getting criminals off the streets, hopefully before their second, third and fourth crimes are committed.”\nKudos to the Metro Police who participate in the taskforce. There’s no overtime, just experienced officers who know where to patrol for violent criminals.\n“The officers volunteer to work on this task force,” said Lt. Ashley Brown, Violent Crimes Task Force Commander. “Its success validates the high level of drive and determination by our officers to make this community safer for us all. This should also send a message that all local, state, and federal agencies are working together towards the same goal...to rid our community of violent offenders.”\nThe task force success bodes well for the police department’s long game plan — “End Gun Violence: Step Forward,” formerly known as Operation Ceasefire.\nThe End Gun Violence campaign was an outgrowth of this summer of the city’s $240,000 contract with the National Network for Safe Communities. This plan involves a group audit that reviews all homicides for the past five years and all shootings for the past two years. The second part involves intelligence gathering to determine which of those incidents were gang-related and who the members of those gangs are.\nThe next step will be to call in identified gang members to let them know they need to curb their violence or face the consequences of a crackdown by law enforcement and legal system.\nBased on the task force’s success, law enforcement knows which rocks to look under to find chronic violent offenders.\nNow it’s up to members of the community to do their part.
