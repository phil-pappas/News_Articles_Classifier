Brandon Coleman was all the rage after he scored in his first career game. But it's been Snead, another undrafted rookie, who has emerged as the de facto No. 2 receiver in the Saints' passing game.\nGary Barnidge, TE, Browns. After his second 100-yard outing, and his third consecutive game with a TD, it's time to take the veteran tight end seriously. Though he barely registered a blip on the fantasy radar over his first six NFL seasons, Barnidge has become a trusted target of the suddenly prolific Josh McCown. Just don't plan to start him right away (see below). Don't be fooled \nJosh McCown, QB, Browns. Don't look now, but McCown has put up 1,154 passing yards and seven total touchdowns over his last three games. That's mighty impressive, especially given the state of Cleveland's receiving corps. So why the negativity? McCown's next three opponents are the Broncos, Rams and Cardinals. It doesn't get much tougher than that. \nAndre Johnson, WR, Colts.
