The ACC's schedule-makers did the Hurricanes no favors, with Al Golden's team facing crossover games against both of the Atlantic Division's top-10 powerhouses. The Tigers' offense is on a roll, gaining more than 500 yards in two straight games — including against Boston College's top-ranked defense. Only Florida State has cracked the 500-yard mark against Miami. Hurricanes coach Al Golden calls the Tigers \"ultra-talented\" and says they're \"worthy of where they are, certainly, from a ranking standpoint.\"\nBEST MATCHUP: No. 9 Florida State's run defense vs. Georgia Tech's triple option offense. The Yellow Jackets still rank eighth in the nation, averaging nearly 287 yards on the ground, despite a five-game losing streak that dropped them from the national rankings and taken some luster off this rematch of last year's ACC title game. The Seminoles have held their last two opponents to fewer than 100 yards rushing, and haven't allowed an opposing team to reach the 150-yard mark.\nINSIDE THE NUMBERS: Some ACC kickers are having pretty good years. Miami's Michael Badgley leads the nation, averaging 2.67 field goals per game. Duke's Ross Martin has made 15 in a row since a fourth-quarter miss against Virginia Tech — also this week's opponent — last year. And Pittsburgh's Chris Blewitt hit a 56-yarder to beat Georgia Tech — the longest game-winning field goal in ACC history.\nLONG SHOT: Wake Forest — a 10-point underdog — has history on its side when North Carolina State visits. The Wolfpack haven't beaten Wake Forest in Winston-Salem since 2001, and no visiting team has won in the series since the Demon Deacons did it in 2006. N.C. State coach Dave Doeren says the Wolfpack \"have to be focused and locked in on this weekend because of the history.\"\nPLAYER TO WATCH: Virginia receiver T.J. Thorpe ought to know this week's opponent — North Carolina — pretty well. Thorpe spent the past four injury-riddled seasons with the Tar Heels, catching 42 passes for 574 yards, before coming to the Cavaliers as a graduate transfer. He started the last three games and caught a 75-yard touchdown pass against Boise State. Coach Mike London says he wants Thorpe not to worry about trash-talking with his former teammates but instead \"just let your play do your talking.\"\n___\nCompiled by AP Sports Writer Joedy McCreary in Raleigh, North Carolina.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
