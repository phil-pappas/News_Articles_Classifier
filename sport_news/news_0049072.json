Relegated to third string since Jay Gruden made a U-turn and anointed Kirk Cousins the starter late in the preseason, Griffin hasn't dressed for Washington's three regular-season games. However, he has continued to prepare as if he was going to play, carrying out his usual pregame warm-up rituals. He remains on the field long after practice, throwing to a lingering wide receiver or tight end or, if nothing else, an equipment manager. It's a daily routine Griffin started after getting bumped to third string.\nAlthough the team hasn't allowed him to speak to reporters since his preseason concussion, Griffin's presence continues to loom over the franchise.\nThe Redskins could have released him during final roster cuts following the \"it's Kirk's team\" announcement or they could have traded him. But team officials said they believed keeping Griffin on the roster was the best move.\nAlthough coach Jay Gruden doesn't see him as the best option as a starter, or even as the No. 2 quarterback, Griffin still has support within the organization, including from owner Daniel Snyder. General manager Scot McCloughan didn't try to trade Griffin, and a person with knowledge of the situation said that no teams have called.\nThat hardly comes as a surprise, considering Washington has little leverage and Griffin has done little to showcase any value he may have. At least for now, McCloughan has shrugged off the notion that keeping Griffin on the roster subjects the team to the risk of having to pay him $16.1 million next year if he gets injured and is unable to pass a physical in March. McCloughan also has not been concerned that Griffin would serve as a divisive force within the locker room. And for the record, Griffin has not sewn any seeds of dissension.\nHowever, the quarterback's lingering presence has prompted league insiders to speculate that at some point, if Cousins falls flat, team brass could eventually force Gruden to go back to Griffin. They believed that it was only a matter of time before Griffin bumped his way up the depth chart to the No. 2 position, where he then would be poised to overtake a struggling Cousins.\nThursday's loss to the Giants, in which Cousins threw two interceptions and Washington lost in feeble fashion, did nothing to ease pressure on either Gruden or his hand-picked starter.\nGruden on Thursday and again on Friday reiterated his support for Cousins. But on Monday, Colt McCoy came down with a mysterious foot injury, apparently suffered over the weekend. He walked about slowly on the field, wearing his jersey but only a ball cap instead of a helmet, and in sneakers instead of cleats. He didn't take part in stretching or drills. Gruden declined to give details when asked about McCoy's status. Later Monday evening, a person with knowledge of the situation said that McCoy had sustained a cut on one of his feet, and that was the reason he didn't practice Monday.\nA conspiracy theorist might wonder about the legitimacy of McCoy's injury, thinking it's just an excuse to get Griffin back up the depth chart.\nBut the Redskins don't need McCoy to fake an injury to rearrange their quarterback depth chart. McCoy has too much self pride to fake an injury.\nEither way, this opens the door for Griffin to move into the No. 2 role. He took second-team reps Monday, and we will see what happens today when the team returns to the practice field.\nIf McCoy can't practice, it's safe to assume Griffin will dress for Sunday's game against the Eagles. This puts more pressure on Cousins. Because it's unlikely that another losing outing with multiple turnovers could take place without a call coming from above, pressuring Gruden to make a change.\nYes, Snyder, Bruce Allen and McCloughan let Gruden have his way to start the season. However, the coach has done little to earn the confidence of the owner and team president. An edict to return to Griffin after another poor Cousins performance or two would surprise no one.\nAlso, in his short time with the team, Gruden has proven that he quickly loses patience with quarterbacks, particularly those who fail to take care of the football. How frustrated would he have to be to go back to Griffin, who has struggled to both move the offense and protect himself from injury?\nAs the preseason drew to a close and concussion-related mystery swirled around the Griffin, some wondered whether the former golden boy of the franchise had seen his last days as a Redskins quarterback. But he survived roster cuts, which left the door to a return as starter at least slightly open.\nOne more Sunday that features a large number of opposing fans in the stands at FedEx Field, and another disconcerting defeat could position Griffin for yet another go around on this team's never-ending quarterback carousel.\nNotes: The Redskins placed starting left guard Shawn Lauvao and backup cornerback Justin Rogers on injured reserve, meaning both are out for the rest of the season.... The team signed free-agent linebacker Mason Foster, signed cornerback Quinton Dunbar from the practice squad to the active roster, and added center Austin Reiter to the practice squad.\nBlog: Eat Sleep Redskins Redskins news, analysis and opinion\nFollow @EatSleepRedskin\n<img style = \" position: relative; float:left; margin-right:25px;border:1px solid silver;\" src=\"http://hamptonroads.com/files/imagecache/story_photo_main/files/images/1169571.jpg\" width=\"100\" height=\"75\" border=0\"></a> <h4>More Redskins</h4> <ul class=\"disc\"> <li><a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/category/pilotonline.com/sports/redskins\">Team news</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://hamptonroads.com/blogs/joe-kacik\">Fantasy sports blog</a></li> </ul> </div> </div></div> <div id=\"extras\"> <div class=\"extras_box\"> <h4>the pressure on Kirk Cousins</h4><P/>\n<strong>It's unlikely that another losing outing with multiple turnovers could take place without a call coming from above, pressuring coach Jay Gruden to replace his hand-picked QB with the brasses' man, RGIII.</strong>\n<h4>the dilemma of Robert Griffin III</h4><P/>\n<strong>Griffin on the roster subjects the team to the risk of having to pay him $16.1 million next year if he gets injured and is unable to pass a physical in March.
