Beaty says junior quarterback has ability to play anywhere on field Posted: October 20, 2015 - 5:42pm By Ben Felderstein The Capital-Journal \nLAWRENCE — With Kansas junior quarterback Montell Cozart getting healthier by the week, it is fair to wonder where he will fit in if freshman Ryan Willis continues his strong play. \nWillis helped lead a second-half comeback last Saturday in the Jayhawks’ 30-20 home loss to Texas Tech, prompting many to question what the future will hold for Cozart, KU’s starting quarterback to begin the season. \nKU coach David Beaty said there haven’t been formal conversations regarding a position change for Cozart, but he indicated Cozart has the athleticism to do so. \n“(Montell’s) way too good of an athlete to be standing over there by me,” Beaty said. “We’re going to find a way to get our best players on the field, whether he’s at quarterback, receiver, defensive back — wherever we gotta be.” \nBeaty has said time and again that teams need to have a “next man up” mentality. Sophomore receiver Derrick Neal is a perfect example. Neal was moved to cornerback for the second time while at KU — a move Beaty and the coaching staff made because the team was a bit shallow at the position with the injury to junior Brandon Stewart. \nWillis certainly made the most of his “next man up” situation, throwing for 350 yards on 35-of-50 accuracy against Tech. \n“While (Cozart) is on the shelf … the train keeps moving,” Beaty said. “Guys step up. \n“One of the things that I think Ryan’s done a nice job of is taking advantage of this opportunity.” \nCozart, who knows KU’s offensive scheme as well as anyone on the roster, has helped advise Willis since he has been sidelined. \n“Montell is always constantly giving tips and reminders to (Willis),” offensive coordinator Rob Likens said. “He takes a lot of pride in helping the other players develop.” \nStill, Cozart may be most valuable to the Jayhawks on the field. Sophomore wide receiver Darious Crawley says Cozart has the athleticism to play anywhere. \n“He’s a great player,” Crawley said. “(Ohio State’s) Braxton Miller was once a quarterback and he moved to the receiver position. Montell is a natural athlete like that.” \nCrawley said Cozart sometimes fools around catching passes at practice, but hasn’t taken any actual reps at the position. However, Beaty said Cozart did take reps at the receiver position last spring, and thinks he could also play defense if needed. \nCozart has rushed for 390 yards and two scores in his career at KU, showing he has the ability to scramble and become an open-field runner. He averaged 21.7 rushing yards and also caught a pass for five yards last season. \nKU is deep at the wide receiver position, but as Beaty said, Cozart has the ability to help the team on multiple fronts. If Cozart returns and sees reps on offense, a Willis-to-Cozart connection could be something in KU’s future. \n“Guys step up and they get their opportunities,” Beaty said. “And it’s no different at quarterback than it is at defensive end or running back and all those type of deals.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T01:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T06:23:12.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
