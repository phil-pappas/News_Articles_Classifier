With 17:52 gone from the second half, Taylor Lincoln scored from a Katie Locandro assist to raise the 9-1 Clippers’ lead to 3-1. St. Thomas (4-5-2) had already scored in quick response during the first half and needed to again before the game got out of reach. With the 20-minute mark approaching, the Saints were awarded their fifth penalty corner of the match. Nicole Arsenault pushed out to Reagan Williams at the top of the circle. Her pass to the back post found Emma Connor and the shot snuck in behind the keeper to bring the Saints back within one at 3-2, though a third goal proved too tall an order. “They have good team defense and are good at stopping the ball, so passing is really important,” said Williams. “Though we didn’t do enough of it today, now we know for next time.” Most of the first half was a scoreless affair, but in the final ten minutes the two sides combined for three goals. Locandro scored two for the Clippers, the first with 8:45 remaining and the second with just under two minutes remaining to give Portsmouth a 2-0 lead. If St. Thomas were going to stay in the game they needed an immediate answer, and Sarah Wade delivered. Williams made a driving pass to catch Wade in stride and with seconds to spare she scored to close the first half at 2-1. “It stemmed from a couple of players on our team who are crazy competitive,” said Saints coach Michaela Franey. “They went up the field together and scored, just like that.” The Clippers looked to the outside channels to move the ball up the pitch, taking advantage of the space behind St. Thomas’s attack to move the ball quickly after free hits and get into an unprotected Saints’ defense. Haily Blodgett and Lincoln always looked threatening on the edges, forcing defenders to close them down before crossing into the circle. “We worked on our transfers really well,” said Locandro. “We had a lot of communication on the field which really helped us push forward and get the ball where it needed to go.” After a lengthy spell of possession, the Clippers’ first goal developed from a Lincoln move down the left. The defense came to block her run, releasing Locandro at the near post. Lincoln passed it in and Locandro put it past the keeper to open the scoring. Seven minutes later it was Erica Hesser making a run down the right and finding the free Locandro, her second goal of the day was good for a 2-0 lead. STA were awarded four first half-penalty corners while conceding none to Portsmouth. Williams was involved in most of the Saints build up play. Her aerials from midfield were only missing attacking options rushing up the pitch. Though winning the penalty corner battle, their presence in the circle didn’t produce many threatening chances. In the second half it was Portsmouth who won the majority of penalty corners, five in all. But like in the first half, the Clippers preferred to score from open play. It was Lincoln and Locandro again, this time Locandro passing in Lincoln for her first goal of the game and a 3-1 lead. Despite St. Thomas’s second quick response of the day, scoring from their only penalty corner of the half, three goals were enough for the Clippers fifth win in a row. “It’s a rivalry game for us, so we knew it wasn’t going to be easy,” said Portsmouth coach Sara Carpenter. “But they’re getting more comfortable playing with each other. They’re beginning to believe in themselves.” By Matt Wimett", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T11:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T17:05:04.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
