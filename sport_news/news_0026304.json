In a Constitutional democracy, the Constitution was supreme and Parliament had no unlimited amending power, he said in the four-one majority verdict. Though judiciary was not an elected body, it discharged the constitutional functions as per the will of the people reflected in the Constitution as the task of determining the powers of various constitutional organs was entrusted with it, he explained. All the five judges delivered separate judgments on October 16 in the case arising from a batch of PILs against the validity of NJAC, with Justice J Chelameswar giving a dissenting verdict upholding NJAC. Justice Madan B Lokur said it was not a question of people’s will. “The debate cannot be reduced to the acceptance of an unconstitutional but popular decision versus a constitutional but unpopular decision. All of us are bound by the Constitution and judges have to abide by the oath of office to uphold the Constitution and the laws, even if the decision is unpopular and unacceptable to Parliament. “This is the essence of judicial review, otherwise no law passed by Parliament (obviously having a popular mandate) could be struck down as unconstitutional,” he said. Expressing similar sentiments, Justice Khehar said the validity of any amendment or law was decided on the touchstone of the “basic structure” of the Constitution that could not be altered, not going by the fact that it had been passed unanimously by Parliament and ratified by 28 state assemblies. Justice Kurian Joseph said Constitution contained 17 provisions referring to the “Legislature” of a state, many of which could not possibly be read to mean “the people.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:04:57.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
