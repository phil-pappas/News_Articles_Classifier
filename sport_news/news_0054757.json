They are Todd Bowles’ first set of triplets, a blend of handsome, somewhat handsome and sort of rough. Upon first glance, Eric Decker, Brandon Marshall and Chris Ivory might not appear to be related, but a closer examination reveals a striking resemblance.\nThey are the soundtrack to the Jets’ white-hot start to the season, the centerpiece of a plan that might just get Bowles into the postseason as a rookie head coach.\nThe Triplets were the difference makers yet again to help the Jets improve to 4-1 in the run-up to next weekend’s showdown with the Patriots.\nDecker, Marshall and Ivory each scored to help the Jets overcome a mistake-prone first half and cruise to a 34-20 win over Washington on Sunday. The offensive philosophy hasn’t been overly complicated: Surround Ryan Fitzpatrick with enough dependable veteran skill position players so that he doesn’t feel like he needs to change in a phone booth each week to save the day.\n“That’s what our job is,” said Decker (four catches for 59 yards, TD), who has scored in each of his four games this season. “That’s why we’re here.”\nThe picture coming into focus looks eerily similar to the one 17 years ago when journeyman quarterback Vinny Testaverde leaned on a pair of 1,000-yard receivers (Keyshawn Johnson and Wayne Chrebet) and a 1,000-yard running back (Curtis Martin) to take the Jets to the doorstep of the Super Bowl under Bill Parcells.\nTestaverde entered the league with a better pedigree than Fitzpatrick, but the foundation of his magical 1998 season was his skill-position supporting cast. The 35-year-old Testaverde, playing for his fourth team in 12 seasons, had only one prior winning season as a starter. He had had thrown for more than 20 touchdowns in a season only once before his 29-TD campaign in 13 starts in ’98.\nThe 32-year-old Fitzpatrick, making his sixth stop in 11 seasons, has thrown for more than 20 touchdowns only once in his career. He’s on pace for a career-high 29 after throwing a pair to Marshall and Decker to spark a 24-point second-half eruption against Washington.\nRobert Sabo/New York Daily News Enlarge Robert Sabo/New York Daily News Enlarge Brandon Marshall (l.) and Eric Decker are playmaking receivers that can take the pressure of a solid but journeyman quarterback in Ryan Fitzpatrick.\n“You’ve got to trust your guys... trust your guys are going to be in the right spot,” said Fitzpatrick, who went 19 for 26 for 253 yards, 2 TDs, 1 INT and a 113 passer rating. “Rarely in the NFL are you throwing it to wide-open guys. I think a lot of it, too, is confidence... having confidence in yourself, having confidence in the guys you’re throwing to.”\nThe good vibes originate from Ivory, whose bruising tone-setting style creates opportunities for Marshall and Decker. Two weeks after Ivory’s career-high 166 rushing yards in London, he set a career-high with 195 total yards to highlight the Jets’ 474-yard offensive output. Ivory ran for 146 of the team’s 221 yards and scored his fourth touchdown in as many games.\nIvory flashed power and speed against an opponent that made it clear early that their prime directive was to stop the run. Obviously, it didn’t work.\n“He comes through every time,” Bowles said.\nDecker and Marshall atoned for coughing up the ball in the first half to help put the Jets in a 13-10 halftime hole. Marshall (7 catches, 111 yards, TD) made a highlight reel one-handed grab before an oh-not-he-didn’t shoestring catch and run for a 35-yard touchdown to give the Jets a 27-13 lead with 5:53 left in the third quarter.\n“He made some absolutely ridiculous plays out there,” Fitzpatrick said. “He wants to rise to the moment.”\nDecker has thrived shifting back to his familiar role as the No. 2 receiver. “If they’re going to (try to) take away Ivory (or) if they’re going to take away other people,” Marshall said, “Then Deck’s going to eat them up.”\nKen Goldfield/Ken Goldfield Rookie head coach Todd Bowles can smile easy after his team dumps Washington to start 4-1. Decker’s two-yard touchdown grab early in the fourth quarter put the finishing touches on the Jets’ most productive offensive game of the season.\n“He’s a nice security blanket for me,” Fitzpatrick said. “He’s a guy that I know is going to be in the right spot and be able to make plays.”\nAlthough Bowles made it clear that his workhorse running back and top two receivers will need help from others “if we want to be any good in this league,” the Jets’ offensive blueprint can work for a team that converted 50 percent of their third downs (7-for-14) and averaged 7.1 yards per play.\nMarshall, Decker and Ivory are good enough to buoy Fitzpatrick, who has made smart timely plays (see: 18-yard mad dash for a touchdown to take the lead for good early in the second half).\n“They’re great players,” Fitzpatrick said. “You’ve got guys who have been successful… You’ve got guys who have shown it and shown that it is sustainable.”\nBill Belichick is a master of erasing an opponents’ top offensive threat.\nWe’ll know in six days whether he’ll be able to stop three of them.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:28:20.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
