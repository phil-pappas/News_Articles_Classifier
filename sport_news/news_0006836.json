(Photo: Dale G. Young / Detroit News) \nThings have come full circle in the last year for the Big Ten.\nEarly in 2014, it was the Big Ten that was the national whipping boy, thought to be the bottom-feeder among the Power Five conferences.\nOhio State, however, won the national championship, and Michigan State finished No. 5 in the nation.\nNow, as the conference is set for 12 of the 14 teams — Penn State and Rutgers met in Week 2 — to start battling each other, Ohio State and Michigan State are Nos. 1 and 2, respectively, with three others in the Top 25.\nAt least one is in a familiar spot — Wisconsin at No. 19 — while Northwestern (No. 16) and Michigan (No. 22) are a surprise.\nNone of it, however, means the Big Ten has become a powerhouse. The teams near the bottom are bad — really bad in some instances — while the middle of the pack has a way to go.\nEveryone expects Ohio State and Michigan State to battle for supremacy, but there are plenty of spoilers. Michigan has had an impressive 3-1 start while Penn State has a loss to Temple, but has started to shore up some of its issues.\nEight weeks from now, we’ll know which teams will meet in the championship game Dec. 5.\nBiggest surprises \nMichigan \nFew people doubted Jim Harbaugh would get the Wolverines back on track and playing like a traditional power, but few believed it would come quickly. There is a long way to go, but through four games, it appears Harbaugh has the maize and blue on the fast track.\nIts only loss was the opener at Utah, the same team that has shot up the rankings after a 62-20 whitewashing of Oregon.\nBut that’s not what has people feeling optimistic. After two pedestrian wins over Oregon State and UNLV, Michigan opened plenty of eyes with a 31-0 victory over then-No.22 BYU. The running game was impressive, while graduate transfer QB Jake Rudock looked as comfortable as he has since he came to Michigan. Add in a defense that held BYU more than 300 yards below its average, and Michigan enters the Big Ten feeling like it might be able to put a scare in its biggest rivals in the East.\nNorthwestern \nAfter two straight 5-7 seasons and plenty of off-field distractions, few believed Northwestern would be a team entering Big Ten play unbeaten. But that’s exactly where it is as it prepares to host Minnesota.\nNorthwestern possesses what is likely the signature victory for the conference, beating then-No. 21 Stanford, the pick for some to win the Pac 12 and earn a spot in the College Football Playoff.\nBut the Wildcats have proven they are the real deal, allowing 8.8 points a game. The offense will need to come around, and there have been signs it is beginning to, but Northwestern has positioned itself as a team to be reckoned with in the West.\nIowa \nThe Hawkeyes haven’t truly contended in the Big Ten since going 11-2 in 2009 and playing in the Orange Bowl. Since then, things have generally been disappointing as Iowa missed a bowl in 2012 and was a game above .500 last year.\nEntering this season, there were plenty of questions, especially at quarterback after Jake Rudock transferred to Michigan. But the move to go with junior C.J. Beathard has proven to be a wise one as Iowa is second in the Big Ten in scoring at 37.8 points. Beathard also leads the conference in passing efficiency (157.8) and is third in passing yards (240.5).\nThe road in the West won’t be simple, but with a victory over rival Iowa State and a last-second thriller over Pittsburgh, Iowa is riding the wave of emotion and plenty of momentum heading into conference play.\nBiggest disappointments \nNebraska \nIt might seem hard to call the Cornhuskers a disappointment considering the way they have lost two games, but this is a team on the verge of the rankings that has an experienced playmaker at quarterback and still might turn it around.\nIt hasn’t been easy for first-year coach Mike Riley as Nebraska lost to BYU on a Hail Mary then rallied against Miami (Fla.) only to lose in overtime. Tommy Armstrong has proven he can make things happen at quarterback, but turnovers have plagued him. He was magnificent rallying Nebraska at Miami (Fla.), but his interception in overtime was a critical error.\nTerrell Newby is an effective runner, but the defense needs to get tougher and they need to hang on to the ball.\nRutgers \nSometimes a long list of problems off the field can start to catch up with a team on it, and that is what is happening at Rutgers. Contending in the East was probably a long shot, but the way things have crumbled around the program is disappointing, if not embarrassing.\nThe number of players dismissed is long, and coach Kyle Flood is serving a three-game suspension after an outside investigation determined he violated an athletic compliance policy by initiating impermissible contact with a faculty member about a player’s grade after being told that player would be ruled academically ineligible.\nFlood’s long-term status remains up in the air, and along with it so does the stability of the program. Some boosters have voiced support for Flood, but if recruits start defecting, it could be the beginning of a difficult period.\nMinnesota \nThe Golden Gophers entered the season as a trendy pick to win the West, but it seems those predictions have changed. The biggest reason is it appears scoring will be a much bigger issue than anticipated.\nMinnesota is last in the Big Ten, averaging 19.2 points a game. And after hanging tough with then-No. 2 TCU before losing by six, Minnesota has struggled in three consecutive three-point wins over Colorado State, Kent State and Ohio.\nThe defense has been solid, though not spectacular. It’s good enough, however, for Minnesota to make some noise in the West. But it will all come down to an offense short on playmakers.\n\nBiggest surprises \nMichigan \nFew people doubted Jim Harbaugh would get the Wolverines back on track and playing like a traditional power, but few believed it would come quickly.
