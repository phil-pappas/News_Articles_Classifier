After spending most of the first half defending, North Plainfield (1-9) managed to clear the ball across the midfield line to open up a scoring opportunity which Guerra capitalized on. \nRose Bielat of Somerville (4-6) managed to tie it before halftime off an assist from Megan Flynn. \n“We were kind of playing to their game, we were staying too compressed in the center of the field, we needed to spread out more and really use each other as a team rather than trying to do each thing individually,” McCabe said. “Just utilizing the things we do in practice, that’s what I kind of try to hammer home during halftime.” \nHer halftime spiel worked. Ten minutes into the second half Levonaitus was in the right spot at the right time to give the Pioneers a lead that they would not relinquish. \n“Flynn drove it on a corner and I tapped it in for a deflection,” Levonaitus, a senior captain, said about her game-changing goal. \nAt 18:03 North Plainfield was charged with a penalty in the circle. Flynn stepped up to face off with Canuck goalkeeper Tori Fellin. A small fake and a strong hit gave Flynn the advantage as she caged the third Somerville goal of the evening. \nWith 14 minutes left in the match Levonaitus passed to Bryn Rolon, who increased the score differential to 4-1. The last goal came two minutes later as Maddie Spolarich swung hard, rebounding the ball off of a North Plainfield defender and into the cage. \n“Resilience,” McCabe said about what gave her team the advantage. “They didn’t hang their head, which was nice to see because unfortunately we do have a tendency to hang our heads when we get scored on first, so it’s nice to see that we can push back and make things happen for ourselves even when things aren’t necessarily going our way.” \nStaff Writer Alyssa Davis: adavis3@gannettnj.com 2 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1LgMD74 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:35:05.333+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
