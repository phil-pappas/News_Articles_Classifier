He paid a $175 bond and we released. \nStokes, 20, is a freshman from Baltimore and is currently the Wildcats’ only healthy true point guard. \nK-State is hoping to minimize off-the-court issues this year, after last season was marred by incidents that led to the dismissal of three players and the transfer of two others at the end of the season. \nLeading scorer Marcus Foster and role player Malek Harris were both suspended for violating a team rule, and served three-game suspensions. \nAfter the Wildcats were eliminated from the Big 12 tournament, spring break pictures of Foster and Tre Harris led to their dismissals, and Malek Harris was dismissed a month later. \nJevon Thomas transferred in March and Nigel Johnson followed suit later on, leaving the Wildcats without a point guard. \nK-State coach Bruce Weber brought in Stokes and junior college transfer Carlbe Ervin to fill the void. Ervin is currently recovering from a small procedure on his knee.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:35:19.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
