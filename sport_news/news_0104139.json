On November 21, Emory Maughan's shoe and clothing collection become available to the general public .\nHere's more about Emory's story and some of her interests that were incorporated in the design of the shoe, courtesy of the OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital .\nSasquatch riding a unicorn? Well, that's just not possible. Until now, thanks to the whimsical mind of Miss Emory Maughan. There's more than silliness to this unlikely pairing, as Emory explains: \"A long time ago when people had kidney disease, they said that survival wasn't possible. Now it is. Before I came along, Sasquatch riding a unicorn didn't exist. Now it does. Anything is possible if you just believe hard enough.\" To underscore that point on her Air Max 90 Premium, Emory took the word IMPOSSIBLE and added a strategically placed apostrophe to create I'M POSSIBLE. On the sockliner, you'll find the stuff she loves best: the names of her family members, tropical palm trees and her favorite literary character, Peter Pan. As for the reflective shoelaces, they were added especially for her father, who has also dealt with kidney issues. \"My dad helped me so much, so I wanted to do something just for him,\" she explained. \"He loves reflective things, so that's my little thank you note to him.\" When Emory isn't designing cool shoes, you'll usually find her with her nose in a book. She loves to read so much that she's decided to be a librarian when she grows up and says she often turns to her favorite authors for inspiration. \"On rough days, I think of this Quote: from [J.R.R.] Tolkien: If more of us valued cheer and song, it would be a merrier world.\" We think Tolkien would agree: Emory's cheerful shoe makes the world a merrier place indeed. -- Tim Brown | @ timfsbrown", "external_links": ["http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/dchf/fundraising/nike-freestyle/john.cfm", "https://twitter.com/timfsbrown"], "published": "2015-10-24T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:51:51.757+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
