Kevin McCarthy shocks Washington by announcing he will not run for House Speaker. youtube.com In a shocking turn of events, the leading candidate to become the new Speaker of the House has dropped out. With Republicans in disarray, Rep. Kevin McCarthy has elaborated for why he made his sudden decision.\nPhoto by Alex Wong/Getty Images After current House Speaker Rep. John Boehner announced he was resigning from his position, the general consensus was that McCarthy of California would succeed him. After making multiple gaffes, including admitting that the House Benghazi Select Committee was, in part, set up to bring Hillary Clinton's poll numbers down , McCarthy was hit with criticism from both Republicans and Democrats. Speaking to reporters on Oct. 8 following his announcement, McCarthy gave his reason for withdrawing from the race, as reported by C-SPAN .\n“I think I shocked some of you, huh?” McCarthy told reporters. “We’re servants, we should put this Conference first,\" McCarthy said, noting that, \"We need a new face.\" Smiling throughout the press conference, McCarthy spoke about uniting the party, which he believes is \"only going to be stronger.\" Despite no longer running for House Speaker, McCarthy said that he will stay on as House Majority Leader. While McCarthy explained his exit being for the good of the party, CNN reported that he had enough support to win the conference vote, but was expected to fall short of the 218 votes needed on the House floor to win the speakership.\nAfter his comments about the Benghazi committee, McCarthy found himself in an uncomfortable position during a recent foreign policy speech . The California Republican fumbled over his words, looking lost for most of his speech. Congress, in particular House Republicans, were stunned by McCarthy's announcement, as Rep. Paul Ryan said he was the \"best person to lead the House,\" and was \"disappointed\" in his decision.", "external_links": ["http://www.c-span.org/video/?118099-1/representative-kevin-mccarthy-house-leadership-elections", "http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/kevin-mccarthy-credits-benghazi-committee-clinton-damage", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/08/politics/house-speaker-republican-vote-mccarthy-webster-chaffetz/", "http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rachel-maddow-kevin-mccarthy-speech-english-language_560d5a35e4b0af3706dfc389"], "published": "2015-10-08T21:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:18:22.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
