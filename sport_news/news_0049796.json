But this week, as he dealt with the disappointment of missing a hometown international after being left of the final roster, Gonzalez was even sounding non-committal about his future with LA Galaxy, where he is a designated player, but perhaps acutely aware of narrowing opportunities for his career if he continues there.\nGonzalez went into the World Cup having started regularly alongside Matt Besler, the Sporting KC defender who did well in the tournament, but looked exhausted in the aftermath of it. If this game had come earlier in the year, Besler might have been a more likely candidate to miss it, as he too had slipped from favor, but has played his way back into the side recently – in fact the recent 2-1 win over Peru was probably the moment Besler played his way back in and Gonzalez played his way out.\nIt’ll be fascinating to see how Jermaine Jones is deployed, and if Kyle Beckerman is used to anchor the midfield. The knock on effect of those decisions will inform just how high up the field Michael Bradley starts, and in turn the freedom afforded to Clint Dempsey.\nBradley and Dempsey, along with DaMarcus Beasley and Tim Howard, all have over 100 caps – based on recent history with Landon Donovan there is definitely a version of the future where none of that quartet plays in the 2018 World Cup, but their experience is being treated as a valuable commodity for Saturday’s clash. Gyassi Zardes and DeAndre Yedlin are in the 23, but there’s no doubting that this is a selection tilted towards experience over youth, despite Klinsmann’s tendency to flirt with novelty.\nRelated: Mexico’s complex rivalry with USA divides Mexican American soccer fans\nMexico meanwhile have made a habit of flirting with disaster – usually close on the heels of triumph. The 2012 Olympic model looked to inaugurate an era of regional dominance, but a hapless World Cup qualifying campaign, then the dramatic unraveling of the Miguel Herrera reign at Philadelphia airport the day after the Gold Cup win this summer, represented another low.\nGiovanni dos Santos, now freshly installed in Los Angeles with the Galaxy, tweeted his support for Herrera, and whether through coincidence or not found himself omitted from the roster for last month friendlies, along with his brother Jonathan who was similarly vocal. Dos Santos has been a polarizing figure for Mexico as fans and pundits alike weigh on whether the team functions better collectively without him, even if he’s capable of moments of game-changing individual skill.\nAs it turns out, Dos Santos will be free to watch the game with his Galaxy team mate Omar Gonzalez after a late injury keeps him out of the line up. So where is inspiration going to come from? Well there’s his brother, of course, though Jonathan dos Santos was solid rather than sparkling in the Gold Cup. But probably a lot of expectation will be heaped on Carlos Vela, who ended his self-imposed three year international exile under Herrera, and who may be asked to unlock the midfield screen in front of the US backline. Or maybe not – the mercurial Vela was apparently reinstated on the 23 man roster only at the insistence of the Mexican Federation, after initially being omitted by Ferretti.\nOf rather steadier players, Andres Guardado’s coolly taken penalties helped Mexico progress, and his veteran presence may be vital for Mexico — if he plays. Like fellow veteran Marquez, the captain was initially a doubt for the roster with injury, and while both are on the final 23 it’s by no means clear whether they’ll start.\nBut just as the US team is relying on their veterans to see them over the line, Mexico too are looking to tried and trusted players. And don’t let Ferretti’s interim status fool you – he’s as close to a safe pari of hands as there is in Mexican soccer. Indeed he has seen six Mexican national team coaches come and go during his reign at Tigres since 2010 – in the wild managerial carousel of Liga MX that longevity is practically a dynasty.\nThat said, Ferretti will be gone by Monday whatever happens on Saturday night. It’s not likely that Klinsmann will, though as no less a figure than Donovan pointed out this week, were the coach to be held to the same level of accountability as he demands of his players, there’s every chance that a defeat in this playoff would spell the end of his reign in any other country in the world. It’s a testimony to the entrenched position Klinsmann enjoys with US Soccer that that’s not likely to be the case, but if ever there was a time for him to build on his unbeaten six game record against Mexico, it’s now.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:58:45.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
