Member Center: Size doesn't matter: Troy's small player with big heart Posted: Follow @ChuckWSFA TROY, AL (WSFA) - \nTeddy Ruben may be the smallest player on the field for Troy, but he's been the biggest contributor to the stat sheet. \nAt five foot seven inches, Ruben typically doesn't have the edge in size and strength, but he does have the speed and competitive edge. \n\"Teddy's a winner,\" Coach Neal Brown said of his wide receiver. \"He doesn't just show up on gameday. He competes during the week, and not all our guys do that.\" \nBrown pointed towards leadership being an area of concern, following the Trojans 19-16 loss at the hands of Idaho. Ruben is accepting the role. \n\"I feel like there are some things that I can be doing better as a leader,\" Ruben said following the loss. \"I can help this team move in the right path.\" \nRuben has had a breakout season. While it may have surprised some, his numbers down the stretch last year backed up that Teddy would be ready. \nAt this point last season he had just two receptions for 32 yards. Down the stretch last season he started to emerge, finishing with 15 receptions for over 200 yards. \nRuben introduced himself in his final game of the 2014 season, hauling in his first career touchdown catch. If they didn't know him after last season, they know him now. \nRuben has almost tripled the receptions of the closest receiver to him. Ruben also does work in the return game. He tallied a touchdown against Charleston Southern, \nHe looks to continue his consistent play, on the road Saturday at New Mexico State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:31:52.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
