The Inglemoor High School graduate ranks second in NCAA Division III in passing yards per game (382.5). Lui Kit Wong Staff photographer i Order Reprint of this Story \nWell past midnight, after the University of Puget Sound football team finally arrived back on campus after its season-opening game in California, and quarterback Hans Fortune couldn’t get his mind off the mistakes made in the game. \nAs soon as he stepped through the front door at his fraternity, he headed directly to his room, turned on his laptop and began reviewing game footage from the overtime win over Claremont-Mudd-Scripps. \nTwenty minutes elapsed, and Fortune remain deep in study. Four interceptions will sometimes do that to a player, even in a game the Loggers wound up winning. \nAnd by the time a group of his teammates — who happen to also to be fraternity brothers — arrived to rescue him, they noticed he was in an almost trance-like state of focus. \n“Classic move by Hans,” said Max McGuinn, the Loggers’ starting tailback. “It is definitely sometimes hard to get him out.” \nFinally, almost reluctantly, Fortune agreed to join his buddies on the town. \n“I had to go back for myself to watch and know what I did, because I replayed (the game) in my head the whole flight home,” Fortune said. “But my friends came in and said, ‘You are not watching this anymore.’ \n“It was my 21st birthday four days before that.” \nOne thing is for sure — Fortune, the big-armed junior from Kenmore, can throw a football. When he gets in a groove, he puts up big numbers in a hurry in the Loggers’ offense. \nThrowing for an average of 382.5 yards per game, Fortune – the Northwest Conference passing leader — ranks No. 2 in the country in NCAA Division III behind Joe Callahan (384.0 ypg) of Delaware’s Wesley College. \nFortune’s first career start last season came after incumbent Braden Foley was injured in the season opener. Fortune threw for 533 yards and five touchdowns in a 34-32 loss at Occidental in the second game of the season. \nThis season, he opened with 334 yards at Claremont and 431 yards against Occidental on Sept. 12 in Tacoma. \nFortunate may have a hard time surpassing Foley’s school-record career yardage total of 6,656 the next two seasons, but he will have a great chance of having a better per-start career average (Foley was at 221.9 ypg; Fortune is at 209.3). \n“Really, the only thing they have in common is they are both great passers,” UPS coach Jeff Thomas said. “Braden would walk into a room and know everybody’s name. Hans is universally respected for putting in all the work to be prepared for game day.” \nIn other words, whereas Foley could take command of a huddle with his personality, Fortune is more of a lead-by-example signal caller. \n“I am a little bit less big-picture outgoing as Braden was,” Fortune said. “In individual groups, I will talk. I don’t lead chants before the game. I have more of a schizo work attitude. If guys are having trouble, I will work with them after practice. \n“I don’t care about being the face of stuff.” \nFortune very much lives how he studies. \nAn International Baccalaureate student from Inglemoor High School, he holds a 3.8 grade-point average taking advanced honors classes while pursuing a double major in economics and business and a minor in mathematics. \nAfter their loss to Occidental, the Loggers have been on a 2 1/2-week break heading into their conference opener Saturday at Willamette. \nThe down time allowed Fortune to keep up with his massive academic workload. \n“I am pretty busy between football and school,” Fortune said. \nHe also knows he greatly benefited from sitting behind Foley for two seasons. \n“He made his mistakes in front of everybody on game days, but they were in front of me, too,” Fortune said. “I saw them, and learned some of the smaller points it takes to run this offense.” \nFortune is also part of something Foley never had to be — a quarterback rotation. He is the undisputed starter, but Thomas is committed to playing Tanner Diebold and Nick Nestingen as change-up playmakers, mostly as runners. \n“Half my job is to get him to smile, and be more of an assertive leader,” Thomas said. “The guy puts in a tremendous amount of work on film. \n“He is getting much better with his progressions. If he continues to make that kind of progress, the possibilities with him are endless.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T05:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:07:33.601+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
