The tourney, a fundraiser to make course updates, collected $4,200. \nThe foursome of Doug Merrifield, Gary Snowden, John Cushman and Keith Todd won the tourney. \nDave Thompson of Waldo was closest to the pin for the men and Theresa Hainer of Bangor closest for the women, while Dan Keene of Belfast won the men's longest drive and Donna Bean of Holden the longest drive among women. \nThe tourney ended with the golfers partaking in chili, corn bread and carrot cake, while prizes and trophies were awarded to the winners. \nRepresentatives of the course thanked their donors, including Country View Golf Course, sculptor Forest Hart, Gibbs Family Hardware, J.P. Wentworth, Marsh River Co-op, Morrill General Store, Norma's Country Style, Ralph's Cafe, Swan Lake Grocery, Tom Gordon and Quimby's Kitchen. \nThey also thanked club founders, members, players and fans for a fantastic season and look forward to more exciting and larger events in 2016. \nCourier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:29:20.804+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
