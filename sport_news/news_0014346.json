The reserve batsman should be KL Rahul, who scored a century along with string of low scores in the Sri Lanka series.\nBengal's Wriddhiman Saha, who missed the final Lanka Test due to a hamstring injury, is expected to be back with the big gloves although Naman Ojha is close on his heels.\nThe three pacers set to be selected are Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh Yadav, Varun Aaron. With no quality all-rounders in sight, Stuart Binny may just retain his place after a decent outing in the final Test against Sri Lanka.\nThe pace battery though will be sans Ishant, who not only serves his one-match ban in Mohali, but will also race against time to get fit from his hamstring injury he picked up during his Ranji game in Delhi.\nThe selectors may just keep him in the squad expecting that he gets fit. Even the spin force is awaiting the news on Ashwin's fitness after the in-form bowler suffered a side strain post bowling just 4.4 overs at Green Park in the first ODI.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:13:22.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
