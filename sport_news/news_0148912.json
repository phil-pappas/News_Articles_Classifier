Ludwig/USA Today Sports Rueben Randle finds the end zone and gives a nod to his teammate Victor Cruz with some salsa. ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. —Victor Cruz didn’t make the trip to Orchard Park. But his celebratory salsa dance did.\nReceiver Rueben Randle made sure of that after he scored the second touchdown of the Giants’ 24-10 win over the Buffalo Bills at Ralph Wilson Stadium on Sunday afternoon. With 10:42 to play in the second quarter, on second-and-6 from the Bills 11, Randle caught an 11-yard slant pass from Eli Manning, and instead of spiking the ball, he broke into Cruz’s salsa.\n“It’s a tough week for him,” said Randle of Cruz. “I knew if I got in the end zone, (I’d) make sure that we were still thinking about him. That was definitely for him.”\nCruz was hoping to make his season debut against the Bills, after missing the first three weeks — and most of the preseason — with a left calf strain, but on Wednesday, he reinjured that calf. He hasn’t played since last October, when he suffered a torn right patellar knee tendon against the Eagles.\nThe Giants receivers did their best to compensate for Cruz’s absence Sunday. Special teams ace Dwayne Harris, taking Cruz’s place in the slot, led the team with five catches for 51 yards and he scored the game’s opening TD midway through the first quarter. Randle added three catches on a day when Odell Beckham Jr. was limited to 38 yards.\nRandle said his salsa celebration was a “surprise” for Cruz but he’s not sure he will do it again.\n“I got to do a little practicing before I keep on doing it,” he said. “But we’ll see. Hopefully he’ll get back soon enough where he can do it for himself.”\nODELL’S OK\nBeckham had a quiet afternoon, making just five catches, and he gave the Giants a scare on Rashad Jennings’ fourth-quarter touchdown catch-and-run. Beckham, blocking on the play, was knocked down, got up and seemed shaken up for a moment. But he was in on the next play.\n“I’m great,” he said. “Nothing happened.”\nELI THROWS A PICK\nEli Manning threw his first interception of the season, but Tom Coughlin is taking the blame for daring to be aggressive with his fourth-quarter offense instead of playing things safe, just the latest time the Giants have made a questionable fourth-quarter call.\nWith 3:51 to play and the Giants comfortably ahead by two TDs, Manning dropped back on third-and-goal from the 8, passing on a second straight down, and jammed a slant pass to Randle. It was picked by corner Stephon Gilmore.\nWhy didn’t the Giants simply run the ball, milking the clock and kicking a field goal?\n“Let’s drive the ball down and score; I wanted to score,” Coughlin said. “It’s third and whatever from the goal line and we threw it away. They had been driving hard on the slants; we knew it and Eli knew it as well. It’s unfortunate that it happened, but again, that’s my responsibility.”\nRelated Stories Raissman's Upon Further Review: Rex Ryan gets another pass Myers: Jets, Giants both relevant at quarter mark Giants beat Bills to even record, Eli Manning throws 3 TDs", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T06:19:12.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
