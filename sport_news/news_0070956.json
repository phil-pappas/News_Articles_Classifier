The Gamecocks return much of last year's team, including Mitchell, their leading scorer the past two seasons. \nFollowing the Gamecocks were Tennessee, Mississippi State, Texas A&M and Kentucky. \nMitchell's teammates Alaina Coates and A'ja Wilson were voted on the all-SEC team. Makayla Epps of Kentucky, Victoria Vivians of Mississippi State and Diamond DeShields of Tennessee were also picked. DeShields is a North Carolina transfer who sat out last season.
