The franchise saw its regular season attendance climb 17.65 per cent from last year to a total of nearly 2.8 million, according to figures from ESPN.com.

(The Jays’ remaining games are all on the road.) As recently as 2010, the Jays averaged a paltry 20,068 fans per home game, placing them 26th in the league.\nFollow us on Twitter: @GlobeBusiness\nMore Related to this Story After wild celebration, Blue Jays resting ace David Price until postseason\n'AL East clinched, killin' it!': Blue Jays fans celebrate division title win\nKelly: Don’t confuse a great regular season run with having won anything\nTopics: Toronto Blue Jays Report on Data Major League Baseball Comments Print /\nLicense A A", "external_links": ["http://license.icopyright.net/3.8425?icx_id=26615386", "https://twitter.com/@GlobeBusiness", "http://license.icopyright.net/g2/3.8425?icx_id=26615386"], "published": "2015-10-01T22:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T03:20:19.909+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
