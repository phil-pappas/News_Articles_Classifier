Joe Girardi thinks so Yankees host Houston in AL Wild Card Game Joe Girardi talks with home plate umpire Eric Cooper between innings as the New York Yankees host the Houston Astros in the American League at Yankee Stadium. 10/6/15 Bronx, NY (John Munson | NJ Advance Media for NJ.com) (John Munson) Comments \nNEW YORK — The hitting faded. Every starting pitcher was on the disabled list at least once. The bullpen's middle relief turned into a train wreck. \nBut despite all of that, the Yankees still won 87 games along with the American League Wild Card. (They were bounced by the Houston Astros in the one playoff game.) \nYankees ' manager Joe Girardi, talking Friday at his final press conference of 2015, said he thinks next season the team will be even better. \n\"I think a lot of those questions that we had going into spring training have been answered,\" Girardi said. \"We saw improvement out of players during the course of the season. Didi [Gregorius]. Arguably you'll have [Luis] Severino for a whole year. Michael [Pineda] has proved that he can stay healthy. \n\"You'll have more pitchers that we expect to be back and not so many question marks. I think there's more depth in our organization as these kids get closer, as we have to go to people because of injuries. So I expect us to be better.\" \nPineda, of course, missed a month with a forearm strain, and CC Sabathia's knee—and overall health—and Masahiro Tanaka's elbow are anything but guarantees. \nBut Girardi reiterated that he thinks the team is in better position now that it was a year ago, and said his \"wish list\" is simple: to win the World Series. \n\"So whatever that takes,\" Girardi said. PLUS : Girardi doesn't exactly give ringing endorsement of Rob Refsnyder \nThe are a few reasons for optimism: Everyone is healthy (Girardi said no surgeries for any players are planned); there are young players on the rise , and indeed the bullpen, at least the back end, is squared away and among the league's best. \n\"We weren't sure when we came into spring training who was going to be the closer,\" Girardi said. \"(Closer) Andrew Miller did a tremendous job. We weren't exactly sure who was going to be our seventh-inning guy. (Reliever) Justin Wilson did a tremendous job...We had a lot of young guys that came up and contributed.\" \nWill that happen again? \nRyan Hatch may be reached at rhatch@njadvancemedia.com .
