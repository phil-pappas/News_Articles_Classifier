Here is a sampling:\nThe Washington Post describes Harper-Mercer as a \" quiet, withdrawn young man who struggled to connect with other people, instead seeking attention online.\" Post reporter Jim Tankersley, an Oregon native, opens his take on the tragedy with this: \"There are constants in the small towns of Western Oregon, some waning, some enduring. In Douglas County — the home of Umpqua Community College, the site of a mass killing on Thursday — two of those constants are trees and the right to bear arms .\"\nIn the New York Times , Harper-Mercer's rampage is summed up in one chilling sentence. \"Clad in a dark shirt and jeans, driven by a motive that is still unknown, he methodically spewed bullets into classrooms full of students, who hid behind desks and desperately tried to block doors that didn't lock .\"\nMany news reports focused on Harper-Mercer, attempting to piece together the motives behind his actions through interviews with family and acquaintances.\nCBS Los Angeles interviewed the gunman's father, who lives in the L.A. area. \"I'm just as shocked as anybody at what happened today,\" Ian Mercer told the T.V. station. Harper-Mercer's stepsister, Carmen Nesnick, described him as caring and supportive, the type of peson who \"would always try to cheer up everybody.\" Nesnick said hr stepbrother was neither religious nor anti-religious.\nInitial reports from the crime scene indicate religion may have played a role.\nRather than focusing on Harper-Mercer, The Daily Beast's Michael Daly urged readers to \"Forget the 26-year-old zero who murdered 10 innocents at Umpqua Community College on Thursday morning.\" Shooting victim Chris Mintz, he said, is \"the one to remember.\" Mintz, a 30-year-old Army veteran, charged at Harper Mercer in hopes of ending the carnage. As he lay bleeding, Mintz repeated, \"It's my son's birthday.\" Mintz is alive, his family says.\nThe motives behind Harper-Mercer's actions remain unclear, but it appears the gunman may have hinted about his plans in an anonymous online forum hours before the attack.\nThe Blaze has published sceenshots of the posts, made shortly before the shooting on the website 4chan. \"Some of you guys are alright. Don't go to school tomorrow if you are in the northwest,\" the message read.\n-- Kelly House\nkhouse@oregonian.com\n503-221-8178\n@Kelly_M_House", "external_links": ["http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2015/10/01/man-suspected-in-school-shooting-massacre-in-oregon-had-ties-to-torrance-relatives-in-tarzana/", "http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/10/02/forget-oregon-s-gunman-remember-the-hero-who-charged-straight-at-him.html?via=twitter_page", "http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2015/10/01/these-are-the-online-messages-posted-day-before-oregon-shooting-that-seemingly-warn-of-future-massacre/", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonkblog/wp/2015/10/02/shooting-in-oregon-where-unemployment-is-high-and-gun-rights-are-precious/", "https://twitter.com/Kelly_M_House", "http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/10/02/oregon-shooter-said-to-have-singled-out-christians-for-killing-in-horrific-act-of-cowardice/"], "published": "2015-10-02T16:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:08:19.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
