I am realistic enough to know that I'm a football manager who needs to win football matches and we haven't done that. So if you don't win games as a manager, you get sacked, that's what happens. \n\"I haven't put a number on it. All I know is I'm a football manager and I take full responsibility for results. I'm not hiding in the background. I'm standing up there in that rectangle at the front of the pitch, taking the brunt of it, that's what I get paid for. \n\"We lost two managers last week and before that it was their names. Mine is at the front of the queue at the moment and hopefully over the next couple of weeks it will be someone else's. \n\"The objective of this season was to stay in the Premier League - 100 per cent we'll stay in the Premier League this season, I've got full belief in that and then we would have reached our objective.\" \nSherwood confirmed he chose to stay in the UK to work with the players while a planned meeting by Villa's top brass was held in the United States during the international break. \nThe 46-year-old conceded he had been given no reassurances by chief executive Tom Fox or chairman Randy Lerner, although does not expect any. \nHe said: \"No, no, no, no. It's fine, it's business as usual. They never said anything to me last season either when it was going well, so it's fine, no concern for me. \n\"I don't want them singing from the rooftops when we're in the (FA) Cup final and I don't want them screaming at me when we're having a difficult time.\" \nSherwood, though, insisted he takes heart from Alan Pardew, who has flourished at Crystal Palace after being criticised during his spell at Newcastle. \nHe said: \"I take a lot of inspiration from managers I've seen who've worked through difficult periods, none more so than Alan Pardew. Nine months ago they were screaming him out of town at Newcastle, and if you asked anyone now who's the favourite to be the next England manager when Roy (Hodgson) has had enough it would be Alan Pardew.\" \nVilla will be without Gabby Agbonlahor (calf), Ciaran Clark (thigh) and Jores Okore (knee) for the trip to Stamford Bridge.
