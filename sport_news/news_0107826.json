(AP) - Susan Strickler, the director and CEO of the Currier Museum since 1996, is retiring next June.\nUnder her guidance, the museum gained more than 33,000 square feet of space and added two large communal areas.\nThe museum has expanded its holdings of photography, prints and decorative arts, initiated a collection of craft and added major paintings and sculpture.\nThe Currier's two most popular exhibitions during Strickler's tenure were Maxfield Parrish 1870-1966 (1999) and M.C. Escher: Reality and Illusion (2014-15) each of which attracted more than 30,000 people to the museum.\nIt's anticipated that a new director and CEO will be named in late spring 2016.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
