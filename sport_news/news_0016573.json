Clarkson struck for the go-ahead goal when Niagara’s Lawrence Smith went off for a hooking penalty. The Knights capitalized when Sam Vigneault connected on the power play at 13:34.\nKevin Tansey and Brett Gervais added goals for Clarkson (2-0) before the second period ended.\nGuillaume Therrien, a freshman from Mirabel, Que., was busy in his collegiate debut for Niagara, facing 45 shots. Niagara put 17 shots on Clarkson’s Steve Perry. Therrien made 21 saves in the first period while Perry was called on for only four. Play was more even after that with Clarkson outshooting the Eagles, 22-12, the last two frames.\nNiagara was 0 for 3 on the power play while Clarkson was 1 for 4.\nCoach Dave Burkholder’s Niagara team opened the season with a 5-2 loss to St. Lawrence in Canton while Clarkson defeated RIT, 6-0, as Perry made 21 stops.\nNiagara (0-2) will be off until a weekend home series against Robert Morris on Oct. 23 and 24.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T06:12:38.289+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
