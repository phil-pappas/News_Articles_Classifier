He returned just in time to give Washington (3-3, 1-2 Pac-12) even more nightmares. \nAdams threw touchdown passes of 36 and 9 yards to Darren Carrington, returning after missing the first six games of the season. \nWashington's Myles Gaskin rushed for 155 yards including a 72-yard touchdown and Jake Browning threw a 3-yard TD to Jaydon Mickens with 3:35 left, but there was no miracle finish for the Huskies.
