Wayne Valley's defense did the rest, squeezing DePaul, which clawed to grab an equalizer. \nSenior Brianna DeLuccia (four saves) was brilliant in goal, silencing the Spartans, who pushed for a two-goal edge. \nDePaul's Nine Lombardo and Gianna Rizzo helped the Spartans (4-5-1 overall) carry a 2-1 lead into the intermission. Victoria Carnevale and Alyssa Oviedo had assists. \nRandi Smith deposited her 16th goal of the campaign to halve the deficit at 2-1 before Thompson took over in the second half.

Earlier in the first half, Oviedo assisted on Carnevale's strike, which gave Big Green a 1-0 lead. \nCristina Pellegrino evened the match at 1 midway through the opening half. \nHennion (three saves) and Keenan (two) teamed for five saves while West Milford's Olivia DelColliano made 10 saves. \nThe Spartans play host to Immaculate Heart Academy on Friday at 7 p.m. at Alumni Field.
