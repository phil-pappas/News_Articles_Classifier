St. Thomas Aquinas High School senior setter Brenna Chrisom, the third Chrisom sister to play for St. Thomas, reached 500 career digs and 1,000 career assists in Saturday's 3-0 win over Portsmouth during STA's homecoming weekend. \"It's amazing that at homecoming that she got both her milestones,\" said STA co-coach Riona Corr. Well, a successful setter must, of course, have a good sense of timing. Chrisom entered Saturday's match needing one dig and five assists to reach her milestones. She ended up with 18 assists and seven digs. On Monday, she added to her totals with 27 assists and 12 digs during a 3-1 upset of previously unbeaten Somersworth — the third straight win for the 7-6 Saints. She is the first STA player to reach 1,000 assists, and currently has 1,040 to go with her 518 digs. \"For the past thee years I have been on varsity we've had such strong teams and our defense has been so great,\" Chrisom said. \"That has allowed me to put up the balls. Our hitters have been so strong. I am thankful to have great players around me.\" Her teammates certainly appreciate her presence. \"Brenna basically holds the team together,\" said STA senior middle hitter Ashley Coneys. \"It's very hard to adjust to other hitters because she puts the ball in a perfect spot every time.\" Her versatility and easy-to-coach attitude make her a perfect fit to run the team's offense and lead on the floor. \"She knows her hitters and she knows where the other hitters are on the other side of the court,\" Corr said. \"She's the one who can run the quick game. She knows what quick she wants to run and at the perfect time. She even knows how to flick it over the net at a great time. She has great court sense.\" Of course, it doesn't hurt having two sisters who played at St. Thomas and were all-state players. CC, now a junior at Saint Anselm College, was a former Division II player of the year, who has 758 career kills and 794 digs for the Saints. Maria, now a sophomore at Assumption (Mass.), for a short time held the state record for career digs (1,438). Both older sisters play significant roles for their college volleyball teams. \"They taught me just to never give up,\" Brenna Chrisom said of her sisters' influences. \"Only you can control what is going on. How you pass the ball. How you set the ball. They have always been a great support system for me. I just picked up confidence from them.\" Brenna has not zeroed in on a college choice, but Emmanuel, Saint Anselm, Merrimack, Assumption and St. Michael's are on her radar. \"Her hands, I think, are the best in the state,\" Corr said. \"She has minimal errors. She's a great girl.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T04:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:04:03.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
