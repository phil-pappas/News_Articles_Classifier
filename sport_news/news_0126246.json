Currently Northgate and Starr's Mill share the subregion lead while both at 7-0 and 4-0. \n'This is by far our biggest game and toughest opponent so far this season, Walburn said. 'I really think we need a game like this.' \nA win tonight would also guarantee the Vikings a berth in one of those crucial play-n games, with a showdown looming against Starr's Mill next week for what could be the subregion title and an automatic berth in the Class state playoffs. \nThe Vikings wing-t offense is averaging 409 points per game, including 315 yards on the ground. \nJunior running back Ton Evans is closing in on his second straight 1,000-yard season. Evans has rushed for 926 yards on 98 carries, finding the end zone 13 times. Teammate Kyle Cater has rushed for 503 yards and 10 touchdowns. \nOne of the keys for Vikings this season has been the ability to hold on to the ball Through seven games, the Vikings have just seven turnovers. \nSophomore quarterback Kyle McLaren is 26 of 40 passing for 643 yards with nine touchdowns and just two interceptions. \nTight end Chris Age has turned into his favorite target with seven catches. Kamari Ray has four catches, including two for touchdowns. \nDefensively the numbers have been just as eye-popping. Last week in the team's 68-0 victory over Forest Park, the Vikings had a season's worth of sacks, finishing with 21. \nLinebackers Carson Storey and Drew Latham each had 4 1/2 and James Skalski had 3 sacks. The three defenders also combined for 26 1/2 tackles last week in two quarters of play. \nDespite a coordinator change from retired assistant Bubba Geter to Davis Russell, the Vikings haven't skipped a beat. \n'He has come in a done a great job taking over the defense,' Walburn said. 'We have tweaked a few things, but the kids have really responded.' \nTonight, the Vikings face what could be their biggest challenge when they travel to Drew High School in Riverdale. \nThe Titans (5-2, 3-1) are in the hunt for one of the two playoffs spots in the subregion along with Northgate and Starr's Mill (7-0, 4-0), the Vikings opponent next week. \nDrew has won its last two contests, beating Morrow 54-0 and holding off Mundy's Mill 36-26 last week. \nThe Titans have outscored opponents 309-148. Northgate beat Drew 48-20 in last year meeting and will face some of the same personnel this season. \nSenior quarterback Joseph Newman has completed 71 passes for 902 yards and 12 touchdowns, while senior running back Quarderman Sloan leads the team with 1,215 yards with five 100-plus yard efforts. \nCedric Davenport is the team's leading receiver with 22 catches. \n'They have some really good athletes,' Walburn said. 'Their coaching staff has done a really good job.' \nDorwyn Lyles, who has gone 12-6 over two seasons, was promoted last season when Jarrett Laws was named head coach at Griffin.
