By DOUG FERGUSONAP Golf Writer \nINCHEON, South Korea (AP) - Branden Grace delivered two big shots in gathering darkness Saturday that kept the International team within one point of the Americans going into a final day at the Presidents Cup that finally has some drama. \nTeam USA leads 9.5-8.5 with 12 singles matches remaining. \nGrace and Oosthuizen became the first International tandem to win all four team matches in this event, and every point mattered at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea. \nJordan Spieth and Phil Mickelson won their fourballs matches. Bae Sang-moon and Hideki Matsuyama had the best rout of the week. \nThe Americans and Internationals split both sessions of matches on a long day. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
