They can be purchased online and by phone and you can buy up to four at a time.\nBut you’ll need to have a little luck to get your hands on one of these golden tickets: ALCS seats were sold out in about an hour earlier this month, and tickets for the ALDS were gone in a little under two hours .\nThe Jays are riding high off their 7-1 win over the Royals on Wednesday night as they head back to Kansas City for Game 6 on Friday trailing 3-2 in the series.\nThey need two more wins on the road to move on to the World Series for the first time in 22 years. “It’s possible. And that’s how we’re looking at it. Win the next game. Get to Game 7 and anything can happen,” Troy Tulowitzki said after Game 5 .\nThe Jays would play the New York Mets for the pennant, after New York pulled the plug on the Chicago Cubs’ playoff hopes on Wednesday with an 8-3 win at Wrigley Field.\nIf the Jays don’t make it, ticketholders will get a full refund.\nMore on thestar.com\nNew York Mets going to World Series\nMurphy homers in sixth straight game as Mets clinch World Series berth", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "https://twitter.com/BlueJays/status/656991510697676801"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T15:01:14.345+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
