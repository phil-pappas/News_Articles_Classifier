It was pretty evident in a lot of ways when everything was done,” said Fort head coach Jerry Shoup. \nHost Milton won the regional with a 343 while Janesville Parker, Janesville Craig and Badger all qualified as a team. \nMilton’s Mia Seeman won the event, shooting an 80. \nDespite Aalto and Schneider qualifiying for Fort, senior Nikki Bertrucci came up just short. Bertucci shot a 104, just one stroke short of tying Schneider. \nShoup said a couple three and four putts, along with some tough chips hurt Bertucci throughout the day. \nSenior Mikayla Sullivan and freshman Miranda Aalto finished out the scoring group for Fort, shooting a 127 and a 131 respectively. \nBeloit Memorial’s Chloe Day shot a 96 and Elkhorn Area’s Jessica Barrett shot a 101 to claim the other two individual qualifiers spots in the regional. \nMaile Aalto and Schneider will take part in the Mukwonago Sectional, at 8:40 a.m. on Tuesday at the Edgewood Golf Club.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:45:14.398+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
