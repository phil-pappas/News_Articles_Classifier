Yet in the fourth, Chaminade found life on its final drive.\nTrailing 30-14 in the fourth quarter, Dymond Lee drove the Eagles 69 yards and connected with Michael Wilson on an 8-yard touchdown with 2:43 remaining. Isaiah Thomas’ 2-point conversion gave the Eagles (5-3, 2-2) life following a turnover by Bishop Amat (7-2, 4-1).\nThe final drive was kept alive by several catches by T.J. Pledger that led to first downs, showing the grit the Eagles gained from close wins over Alemany and Notre Dame .\n“Coming into the game, we were the only people that expected us to win tonight and so we tried to battle and make that dream come true,” Lee said.\nTyler Vaughns shines for Bishop Amat\nAlthough Bishop Amat senior wide receiver Trevon Sidney, a USC commit, did not play due to a toe injury, fellow USC commit Tyler Vaughns had a virtuoso performance as he caught 11 passes for 198 yards, had an interception and added a 69-yard punt return.\nAll but one of Vaughns’ catches were for 10 or more yards as the senior dazzled the crowd with spectacular grabs, including a one-handed catch in the fourth.\n“He plays like that every night. He just does it sometimes in different ways but he always plays big,” Bishop Amat head coach Steve Hagerty said.\nThe 1-2 punch of Sweet and Vaughns started early as Sweet scored on Bishop Amat’s opening drive with a 3-yard run. Chaminade came back as Pledger scored from a yard out but Bishop Amat then scored on its next two drives on another 3-yard run by Sweet and a 21-yard catch by Vaughns.\nAdvertisement\nJordan Chin then caught a 41-yard touchdown catch from Lee to cut the deficit to 21-14 in the second quarter. After Erik Reyes converted a 34-yard field goal for Bishop Amat, Chaminade drove down the field before Vaughns ended its drive with his interception just before halftime.\nPledger finished with 133 total yards of offense. Lee threw for 178 yards and two touchdowns on 19-for-31 passing.\n“We came as close as we could and I’m proud of them for fighting all the way through,” Lee said.\n SnapChat and sign\nAbout the Author Evan Barnes has covered high school sports in Los Angeles since 2006 for various outlets, including the Daily Breeze and Long Beach Press Telegram.
