They made the call there,” Cheika said on Sunday. \nCheika will have several options to call on should Hooper become unavailable – with tyro Sean McMahon and Ben McCalman both in fine form. \nMcCalman won a spot on Cheika’s bench in the thrashing of England ahead of McMahon, who was named man of the match in Australia’s rout of Uruguay earlier in the tournament. \nMcMahon is considered one of the rising stars of the Australian game and his aggressive running was a feature of the Wallabies’ Uruguay thrashing. \nIt is known Cheika is a massive fan of the 21-year-old Rebels star, but as an openside flanker stuck behind Pocock and Hooper there have been few opportunities to force his way into the starting lineup. \n“We’ve got some pretty influential players in those (backrow) positions, but as long as he’s there rattling their cage that will keep them honest and that will keep him honest as well going forward,” Cheika said after McMahon’s two-try performance against Uruguay. \n“I was very pleased and proud of his performance because he knows those guys are there and he’s just got to keep taking it to them.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T13:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:32:19.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
