Not so much. \nOne of the reasons behind such a perception may be that although Rivera opened its doors in 1988 and Lopez was the next city high school to follow suit in 1993, according to records, the two schools didn’t start playing each other in football until 2006 when both were members of District 32-5A, even though they’re located just a few miles from each other. \nBefore 2006, the Lobos were in District 32-4A and the Raiders were in 32-5A, and the two did not met in non-district varsity action. \nSince they first collided in 2006, Rivera holds a 6-3 edge in the relatively brief series. They both now play in District 32-6A. \nThe Lobos (0-4, 0-2 district) and Raiders (0-5. 0-2) renew acquaintances at 7 p.m. Thursday at Sams Memorial Stadium, and somebody’s going to break into the win column. \n“We’re excited about this game,” Lopez coach Jason Starkey said. “We’re excited to take the field against Rivera. I want us to go out and get this monkey off our backs.” \nAlso at 7 p.m. Thursday in other action involving a Metro-area team, Porter (3-2, 1-1) is at PSJA Southwest (2-3, 1-1) for a 32-5A matchup. \nOn Friday at 7:30 p.m. for Metro-area teams, it’s Harlingen South (1-3, 1-1) at Los Fresnos (5-0, 2-0) in 32-6A and PSJA High (0-5, 0-2) vs. Pace (0-4, 0-2) at Sams in 32-5A. Also Friday in games involving local teams, it’s St. Joseph Academy (4-1) at San Antonio Christian (1-4) for a TAPPS district opener at 7 p.m. and Progreso (1-3) at Port Isabel (3-1) for a District 16-4A Division II opener at 7:30 p.m. \nFor Metro-area teams, the weekend’s action will be completed at 7 p.m. Saturday at Sams when the Brownsville Veterans Memorial Chargers (5-0, 2-0) go against the Hanna Golden Eagles (2-3, 0-2) in a 32-6A matchup that is The Brownsville Herald’s Game of the Week. \nRoy Hess covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
