USC visits No. 14 Notre Dame (5-1) on Saturday. \nHaden wasn’t specific about the reasons for Sarkisian’s absence, only saying that \"it was very clear to me\" that the second-year USC coach was not well. Haden asked Sarkisian to take a leave during a phone conversation. \nSarkisian publicly apologized before the season after he appeared to be intoxicated while making an unsteady public statement at a pep rally. He announced he would be getting unspecified treatment, but didn’t believe he had a drinking problem, blaming his appearance on combining alcohol and medication. \nSarkisian is 12-6 during his short tenure leading the talented Trojans, who were dropped from the AP Top 25 after losing, 17-12, to unranked Washington on Thursday. Sarkisian had been on the road recruiting during the long weekend, but apparently wasn’t in condition to lead practice Sunday, according to Haden. \nHaden informed the players of the change in a team meeting. \nIn other USC news, all-conference center Max Tuerk will miss the rest of the season with a torn knee ligament. \nMaryland axes coach \nRandy Edsall was fired as Maryland’s football coach Sunday, less than 24 hours after the team’s third straight lopsided defeat. \nThe dismissal comes in the middle of Edsall’s fifth season with the Terrapins. He was 22-34 since taking over in 2011. \nMaryland (2-4, 0-2 Big Ten) has been outscored, 122-34, during its three-game losing streak. \nOffensive coordinator Mike Locksley will take over on an interim basis. Maryland is off this week before facing Penn State in Baltimore on Oct. 24. \nEdsall replaced the popular Ralph Friedgen after taking Connecticut to the Fiesta Bowl in 2011 and going 74-70 in 12 years with the Huskies. \nGeorgia star on shelf \nGeorgia running back Nick Chubb is expected to miss the rest of the season after injuring his left knee Saturday in the Bulldogs’ loss at Tennessee. \nChubb came into the game with 13 consecutive 100-yard rushing games. \nThe star back was injured on the first play from scrimmage. \nBaylor moves up \nBaylor is No. 2 and Utah is up to fourth behind No. 1 Ohio State in The Associated Press college football poll. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:27:13.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
