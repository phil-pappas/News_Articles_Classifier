The senior has completed 197 of 266 passes for 2,709 yards and 24 touchdowns with four interceptions and is third in the country in passing yards a game with 387. \n“All you’ve got to do is watch it come out of his hand,” Miles said on the Southeastern Conference teleconference on Wednesday. “He’s extremely accurate. He throws it 38 times a game.” \nNo. 5 LSU (6-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) hosts Western Kentucky (6-1, 4-0 Conference USA) at 6 p.m. Saturday on ESPNU. \nDoughty has five receivers who have caught 24 or more passes. \n“So we recognize that he’s a very talented quarterback, and I don’t think there’s going to be any issues with educating our guys,” Miles said. “All they have to do is look at the film.” \nMiles said Wednesday night after practice that the Tigers’ defense will have to be ready for a quick release from Doughty. \n“It’s five steps, plant and throw,” he said. “That’s one of the reasons it has been difficult to get to him. They have a nice protection scheme. Their front five is talented athletically, and he gets rid of the ball.” \nDoughty has been sacked seven times, but five of those have been in two games. LSU is sixth in the SEC with 17 sacks on the season. The Tigers are 10th in the SEC in pass efficiency defense with 11 touchdowns allowed against six interceptions and 205 yards allowed a game. \nTHOUGHTFUL MILES: SEC media relations director Chuck Dunlap just turned 40, and Miles opened his appearance on the weekly SEC teleconference Wednesday morning with a birthday wish that surprised Dunlap, who moderates the teleconference. \nMiles said, “Chuck, do you have a birthday today?” \nAfter a pause, an obviously taken aback Dunlap said, “Possibly.” And Miles said, “Well, you sound much more mature and wise and capable. Sounds like you’re 40 years old. So, happy birthday.” \nQUOTE OF THE DAY: “It’s always the time that you need to kick the three that is the best time for the fake.” \n---LSU coach and Master of the Fake Les Miles on his radio show Wednesday night.
