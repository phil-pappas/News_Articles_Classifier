On the women's side, Kim McCracken of Durham won her first 13.1-mile race, while Dover's Megan Wilson finished second in her first road race of any distance. \"A total shock to win,\" said McCracken, 44, who finished Saturday's race in 1 hour, 38 minutes, 24 seconds. \"I usually do well but I don't usually win. Since I decided to run this on Wednesday, it's a pretty big shock.\" McCracken was fourth at the Wallis Sands Half Marathon last May. Wilson, 18, is no stranger to running, having played field hockey and lacrosse and run track at Dover High School, from where she graduated last June. But now that her team-sport days are mostly behind her, she said she'd like to pursue running as her No. 1 sporting endeavor. She got her running career off to a great start on Saturday, crossing the finish line in 1:44:09. \"I've never even done a 5K, so I'm pretty pumped,\" said the University of New Hampshire freshman. \"I've always loved running. It's been my strong suit in all my sports. I really picked it up this summer, since I don't play sports at UNH. It's Dover, it's my home town.\" Alex Leuchanka of Newmarket finished first in a cool 1:10:41, adding another chapter to his storybook running season of 2015. \"So far it's been a pretty good season,\" Leuchanka said. \"Since I graduated (from graduate school at UNH in May) I started working. Having a steady work schedule allows me to train before and after work. I just have to get up and do the work. Grad school, it was difficult.\" Leuchanka was the first New Hampshire finisher (and 50th overall) at the 119th Boston Marathon in April, and also has won numerous races in the region, including the Bobcat Bolt 5K in June, the Rye Harbor 10K in August and the Stratham Fair 5.7-miler in July. \"He's having the best year of any New Hampshire runner,\" said race announcer and local running expert Andy Schachat. \"He's a great guy and a great addition to the New Hampshire road-race scene. He's a great ambassador for the New Hampshire running community.\" Matt Garfield, 27, of Wells, Maine, finished second in 1:17:30. \"About 10 feet,\" Garfield said with a laugh, when asked how long he was able to stay with Leuchanka at the start of the race. \"It went really well. I was just kind of hoping to use this as a training run and it felt good, so I just went with it.\" Local age group winners were Hannah Dean, 35 (1:50:07), Peter Gregorakos, 60 (1:52:16) and Thomas Dunnington, 73 (3:04:56). All three hail from Dover. nnn In Rochester, Jesse Young, 25, of Rochester took the top spot at the inaugural Foley Foundation 5K. Young finished in 15:52. The top female was Lauren Waterman, 37, of Keene, who finished in 20:59.
