But for the purposes of this discussion there’s something else the Bruins don’t have that’s almost as glaring: They don’t have Deflategate.\nFor while most rational people see this issue as football’s answer to “Trump for President” — contrived, hollow, stupid — it has united Patriots fans to such a degree that there may be pro sports team owners out there secretly wishing they had a Deflategate of their own.\nBruins fans have no such cause around which to unite. They cannot warm themselves around the afterglow of a Stanley Cup championship. There’s not even a playoff run of recent vintage to dissect and analyze.\nThere’s only blind faith and a grudging acceptance that there are going to be . . . wait for it, wait for it . . . “growing pains.”\nWhich brings us to last night’s 2015-16 season opener at the Garden. And based on the way things turned out, the Bruins need to work up to their “growing pains.” For now, there’s a 6-2 loss to the Winnipeg Jets in the books.\nBut whatever the level of grumbling as Bruins fans stepped out to Causeway Street, it is a fact that, earlier in the evening, they brought lots of passion and noise into the joint. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that’s the way Opening Night is supposed to be, but the place was rocking from the moment ageless Rene Rancourt stepped out from behind the curtain to belt out the Canadian and American national anthems.\nAnd, geez, look what happened at 5:36 of the first period: 19-year-old NHL sophomore David Pastrnak liberated the puck from the Jets’ Ben Chiarot and went behind the net. While his attempt to put the puck in front of the net went off Chiarot, it deflected to David Krejci, who deftly moved the puck to his backhand and put a shot past Winnipeg goalie Ondrej Pavelec.\nThe Bruins kept the heat on. They outshot the Jets 14-6 in the first period. That there were five newly minted Bruins on the ice didn’t seem to matter: There was a sense of chemistry, of communication — in the first period, anyway.\nBut the B’s were outscored 6-1 from the second period on, mostly because of, well, a lack of chemistry and communication. That Chara was out of the lineup showed, as defensive breakdowns killed the Bruins.\n“Not the start we wanted, obviously,” lamented Bergeron. “Definitely would have been nice to come out of that (first) period with more than one goal. That’s definitely what hurt us. In the second, we had a few breakdowns . . . that was the story of the game right there.”\nKrejci, trying to aim some sunshine at this black cloud of an opener, said, “We can take one positive thing out of this game which is that we had lots of chances. We easily could have put the game away in the first period.”\nWhat a shame for the Bruins that the NHL has decided to go with that new three-periods rule.\nFor the Jets tied it at 5:26 of the second period when a bad pass in the defensive zone by Joe Morrow led to a goal by Mark Scheifele, and at 9:17 they took the lead — for good — on a play that began with Andrew Ladd easily stripping the puck from Matt Irwin behind the net. Ladd got it out front to Blake Wheeler, who did what players will do when they’re wide open in front of the net.\n“I had the puck behind the net and I went to one side and didn’t use the net to my advantage,” Irwin said. “He got a stick in there, obviously stripped me of the puck, and we all know what happened after that. I take full blame for that one.”\nBut guess what? With 3:15 left in the period, a very real, very loud, “Let’s Go Bruins!” chant filled the Garden.\nBut guess what? With 2:21 remaining in the period, the Jets went ahead 3-1 on a goal by Drew Stafford.\nThe Bruins got back on the board early in the third when Pastrnak went short side on Pavelec, and, yep: “Let’s Go Bruins!”\nInstead, this crowd saw the Jets increase their lead to 5-2 on goals by Chris Thorburn and Nicolas Petan. An empty netter with 3:38 remaining emptied the building.\nGrowing pains? We’ll get back to you on that. For openers, the Bruins just got smoked.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:49:17.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
