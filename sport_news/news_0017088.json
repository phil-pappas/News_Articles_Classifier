Center, after the football team's noon game at Florida State. The second scrimmage, unlike the first, when the lineups changed at halftime, is expected to be played as if it's an entire game, with players sticking to the same team. \n\"These games help understand what it's like to play in front of a big crowd in a big arena, get the jitters out,\" coach Rick Pitino said after the first exhibition. Coat drive part of U of L Red-White scrimmage \nIn that game, Pitino said he was most impressed by his team's shot-blocking. The Cards racked up 16 swats, including five from freshman Ray Spalding and four from sophomore Anas Mahmoud. \nThose numbers could go up with redshirt junior Mangok Mathiang, a 6-foot-10 big man who will play both power forward and center this season, back in the lineup after missing the last scrimmage because of an eye injury. \nIf the season began today, the safest bet for Louisville's starting lineup would have Mathiang and sophomore Chinanu Onuaku playing together as the team's big men, with Damion Lee sharing the backcourt with Quentin Snider and Trey Lewis. \nBut two issues in that potential starting group popped up two weeks ago and will be key things to follow in Saturday's scrimmage. \nOnuaku's fouls: Onuaku, a 6-10 center who is projected to be a first-round NBA draft pick next summer by multiple analysts, battled foul trouble. He tallied eight -- yes, eight -- fouls in the first half of the scrimmage. Part of that, Pitino said, was due to Onuaku's work-in-progress conditioning and part of it was due to poor defensive movement by the big man.

If he struggles with foul issues during the season, Louisville's frontcourt depth will be tested, but the emergence of the 6-10 Spalding as an impact newcomer, paired with Mahmoud and Jaylen Johnson's development, alleviates some concern about Onuaku's fouls. \n\"(Onuaku) is getting better and better, but he's going to learn to be a factor,\" Pitino said after the last scrimmage. \"He had eight fouls in the first half. He would be on the bench and wouldn't play that much. They're going to call more fouls this year, much more than they ever have, and they're going to stay with it until there's freedom of movement. He's got to learn to move his feet and not foul as much.\" \nThe lead guards: Another issue that came up two weeks ago was something that emerged during the team's exhibition series in Puerto Rico this summer. Lewis and Snider are still learning how to play with each other, and they are learning unfamiliar roles in Louisville's two-lead-guard system. \nLewis played off-guard at Cleveland State, where he was asked to score, but he is now trying his hand at point guard. Snider, who started 10 games at point guard last season, joked in Puerto Rico that he has never not played the point in his entire basketball life. Now he must learn how to operate without the ball.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:39:13.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
