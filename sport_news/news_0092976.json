And that means Thompson's stalemate will continue to hover over the organization like a black cloud, a cloud LeBron James considers \"a distraction.\"\nIt may be time to signal to the dugout for Cavs owner Dan Gilbert.\nThompson's presence on and off the court is sorely being missed. Internally, members of the Cavaliers have expressed to each other how it would be such an unnecessary hurdle to try to contend for a title without their best offensive rebounder and most versatile big defender.\nJames has been in constant contact with Thompson throughout the negotiations. He has made it clear the importance of ending the impasse as soon as possible.\nA championship run is at stake.\n\"I try not to get involved in that, as far as what the team is speaking on or talking about,\" James said about the stalled negotiations. \"It's basically more on a personal level, asking him how he's doing and if his mind is right and things of that nature. There's a lot of things that's much bigger than basketball, even though I know he would love to be here right now and we would love to have him here, but I kind of stray away from that.\"\nThere are two options for the power forward, and he's actually executing the first one by holding out until Paul feels the contract numbers are up to par with his age and skillset.\nThe second option is sitting out the entire season, and that option could prove to be more financially beneficial.\nAt 24, Thompson would remain a restricted free agent in the summer of 2016, but this time around 20-plus clubs will have sizable cap space with the salary-cap spike. It is estimated that on an average for next season, teams will have $33 million in cap space available.\nThat's a lot of money, and there won't be enough talent to fill those roster spots.\nI'm told all options are being considered.\nCleveland's offer is still in the ballpark of five years for $80 million, give or take. The Cavs did not withdraw the offer once the qualifying-offer deadline passed. Paul is adamant his client is worth a max contract, rather it be over five or three years.\nThe salary of last season's top four offensive rebounders (Thompson is No. 5) goes like this: It is believed Andre Drummond will get an extension in the neighborhood of $23 million; DeAndre Jordan earns $22 million; Tyson Chandler at 33, is on a four-year, $52 million contract; and Enes Kanter is now making $17.5 million.\nThe debates, the arguments on what Thompson is truly worth have been dissected at nauseam and will continue to be as long as this persists. That's why Gilbert's involvement is needed to help resolve this matter. He could take on the moniker of the NBA's \"Mr. October.\"\nAfter all, Thompson was Gilbert's guy. Drafting Thompson was at Gilbert's recommendation. He fell in love with the kid's potential and personality as soon as he met him at a predraft workout.\nWhen you pay for a meal and it's not cooked to your liking, you don't ask to speak to the chef. You request the owner, because he has the power to do something about it. Healthy roster or not, the Cavaliers need Thompson in the fold.\nBut sadly, from what I'm hearing, there will be more of these two-week milestones on the horizon, and the only individuals happy about that are the Cavaliers' upcoming opponents.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:27:44.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
