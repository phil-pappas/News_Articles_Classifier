Lions on Saturday night was huge, of that there is no doubt. \nA loss would have all but knocked the Blue and Gold out of playoff contention for a fourth consecutive season, leaving them to play out the string as questions swirled. The win means they can keep those conversations at bay for at least another week. \nThe only problem for the Bombers is this: They have shown an uncanny ability over the last several years to never win two games in a row. Since the middle of the 2011 campaign, the Bombers have been able to muster only two winning streaks. They won three in a row and then back-to-back games during last year's 5-1 start. Other than that, they have followed up their other 17 single game victories with losses over the last four years and two months. \nThe Bombers not only have the inability to handle adversity most of the time; they also have a boatload of trouble when it comes to dealing with prosperity, too. \nSo even though it's been said so many times before, it must be said again: Saturday's win was nice and all, but it will mean jack and squat unless the Bombers follow it up with another win on Friday against the Ottawa RedBlacks. Winnipeg's fans have been teased with a “big victory” 17 times before, so forgive them if they're a little gun shy to proclaim Saturday's second half as the turning point of all turning points. \n“(The players) proved something to themselves, and now we gotta move forward and capitalize on it,” head coach Mike O'Shea said. “We gave ourselves a chance now, and we gotta keep on rolling. \nAsked how they do that, O'Shea said, “We need to win the next playoff game, because they're all important games. This just bought us a ticket, that little inch that we needed. We've got tough games coming up, and we need a win.” \nSPECIAL EFFECTS \nThe Bombers blocked a punt for a touchdown for the second time this season, and they also converted two fake punts for first downs, including one on third-and-10 at the three minute warning that led to the tying touchdown. \nLeft up-back Jesse Briggs rumbled 11 yards for the first down on a call the players made. \n“If it's a bench call (O'Shea) gives us the green light to call it if we get the look we like,” said Briggs, whose grandparents were in the BC Place crowd watching him play live for the first time in years. “We got the look we like and ended up calling it on the field. It worked out.” \nBriggs wasn't nervous just before the snap or as he was running; it was when Lions head coach Jeff Tedford challenged the spot where Briggs was tackled. \n“That's when my heart was pounding, during that challenge,” Briggs said. “I thought I had it, and then they threw the challenge flag and it was a long time that they were looking at it.” \nDEFENSIVE TURNAROUND \nThe Bomber defence is getting much better at second half adjustments, which has been required on occasion this season due to terrible opening halves. \nLions quarterback Jonathon Jennings, making just his third career start, manhandled the Bomber defence for the entire opening 30 minutes, completing 16 passes in a row, and throwing for three touchdowns and 307 yards. \nTo the credit of Richie Hall's crew, it limited the Lions to 58 yards of net offence in the second half. \n“We got more pressure on him, and that's twelve man football,” O'Shea said. “Obviously the coverage is better, so the pressure can get there, too. They refused to give an inch, really. \n“I asked them to shut them out in the second half, and those three points are on me. The safety and the (punt) single is a coaching decision.” \nPLAYING IT SAFE \n\nWinnipeg's offence will need to be better against Ottawa than it was on Saturday night. Matt Nichols and Co. mustered only 118 yards of offence in the first half and just 130 in the second. \nWhat it did well, though, is hold on to the ball, save for a failed third-and-one plunge in the fourth quarter. It also produced 55 of its second half yards in the final four minutes, when the Bombers tied the game and then won it on Sergio Castillo's 41-yard field goal as time expired. \nNichols, who improved to 2-3 as Winnipeg's starter, completed 19 of 34 attempts for 179 yards and a touchdown. \n“We just stayed patient and made sure we didn't turn the ball over,” Nichols said. “That's three games in a row now where offence hasn't turned the ball over, and that's why we've been in these games.” \nWinnipeg's running backs, Cameron Marshall and Da'Rel Scott, combined for 14 carries and 62 rushing yards. Marshall had an 11-yard dash on second-and-seven with 37 seconds left that ultimately set up Castillo's winning kick. \n“We got three games left, and we gotta win probably two of the three, but we're treating this like the playoffs right now where we need to win every game that we're playing in,” Nichols said. “So we're going to flush this one extremely quick and get on to Ottawa. We know that they're a very good football team. \n“I've played them twice and beaten them twice this year (with Edmonton), so that gives me obviously confidence moving forward. It's going to be a tough battle.” \nLATE HITS \nThe Bombers registered a whopping seven sacks on Saturday night for the first time since the 2013 Banjo Bowl win over Saskatchewan. Jamaal Westerman extended his league leading total to 14 with a pair, and linebacker Moe Leggett had two as well ... Receiver Rory Kohlert (head) and centre Dominic Picard (unknown) left Saturday's game in the second quarter with injuries and will be evaluated over the next couple of days, O'Shea said ... Clarence Denmark's 16-yard touchdown catch that tied the game late in the fourth quarter was just his second of the season. The other one came on July 18 in Calgary. \nkirk.penton@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:28:08.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
