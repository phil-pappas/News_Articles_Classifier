Sunday, high pressure will dominate our weather and a great day for tailgating! This sunny and cool weather will continue into the middle of the week.\nHurricane Joaquin is a dangerous Category 4 hurricane, but no threat to us and is now moving away from the U.S. East Coast. However, it will bring very high coastal tides and enhancing an easterly wind flow on shore with abundant tropical moisture. The Carolinas are experiencing record setting rainfall. By Tuesday, Joaquin is projected to move into the North Atlantic Ocean and weaken.\nFollow me on Twitter: @ReneBrunetFOX8\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
