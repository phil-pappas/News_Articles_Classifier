Mandatory Credit: Nick Turchiaro-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Rogers Centre has claimed two third baseman in one day.\nAdChoices In Game 1 between the Texas Rangers and Toronto Blue Jays, Adrian Beltre was forced out of the game early with a back injury.\nA few innings later, Blue Jays third baseman/AL MVP candidate Josh Donaldson took a knee to the head from Rangers second baseman Rougned Odor. He remained in the game, but was removed in the fifth inning for 'precautionary reasons' when Ezekial Carrera pinch-hit for him.\nNeedless to say, this is not a good development for either club considering how important each player is to his respective team.\nThis will be something to watch as the series progresses, for sure.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:13:45.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
