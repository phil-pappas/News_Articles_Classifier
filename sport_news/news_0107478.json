Cristiano Ronaldo has mastered a lot of things. He’s one of the two best footballers in the world. He is one of the most successful underpants models on the planet. He's nice to children .\nAdChoices There isn’t much Ronaldo hasn’t done in his rich, full life, but the one thing the international icon wants to do most, it seems, is act.\nSure, Ronaldo has a movie coming out soon about his life, but in that he plays himself. He’s not technically acting.\nAppearing in a Martin Scorsese film, however, well that would be acting. Alas, according to Gazzetta World , Ronaldo will not be a part of Scorsese’s film “The Manipulator,” despite reportedly being promised a role.\nThe film is based on the life and times of Alessandro Proto, the Italian millionaire who supposedly inspired the character of Christian Grey in the “Fifty Shades of Grey” novels.\nApparently Ronaldo’s luxurious new Manhattan loft, in the lavish Trump Tower building in New York, has been chosen as a location by the producers, and a small role was promised to the Los Blancos ace as a sweetener.\nThe report states that Ronaldo was pulled from consideration because it was feared he would take up too much of the spotlight, and would become a distraction in the film. Thus, Channing Tatum is rumored to be pegged as a replacement.\nIt’s a shame for Ronaldo fans that he won’t make his acting debut in such a prestigious project. Though it’s perhaps not surprising the diminutive Scorsese snubbed Ronaldo. As directors go, he seems like more of a Messi guy, doesn’t he?\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JrZFUPGZZ6c", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://gazzettaworld.gazzetta.it/off-the-ball/ronaldo-movie-scorsese/?refresh_ce-cp"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:51:27.269+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
