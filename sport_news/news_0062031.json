Schools, shops and other business establishments remained closed as Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers' Association and Kashmir Economic Alliance called for a strike. While public transport was off the roads, private vehicles, including taxis, were plying on the roads normally. The attendance in government offices was thin due to the non-availability of public transport facilities. The trade bodies had called for strike to protest against the alleged petrol-bomb attack on a Kashmir-based truck in Jammu on Friday night in which three persons, including a policeman, were injured. The two Kashmiris injured in the attack have since been shifted to a hospital in Delhi for treatment as they had suffered severe burn injuries in the attack. Police have so far arrested six persons involved in the attack. The separatist groups of Kashmir, including both factions of Hurriyat Conference and JKLF, supported the strike call.â€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T14:05:54.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
