Basically, I’ll solicit questions on Twitter (@jeffphowe), and answer six on the blog every Friday. If you’re so inclined, use the #Friday6Pack hashtag and submit a question earlier in the week.\nHere we go.\nDo you think the Pats can win the Super Bowl with their current secondary?\n--@djkearney01\nI absolutely do. Obviously, their secondary isn’t as good as last year’s group, but their pass rush is a lot better and Tom Brady’s offense might even be better, too. So it’s a collaborative effort.\nRight now, it looks like their greatest hurdles will be the Broncos, Bengals and Packers. Until the Bengals prove they can win a meaningful game in primetime, or the playoffs for that matter, let’s keep them out of it. Brady tore up the Broncos defense last season, but we’ll find out in Week 12 if the Broncos are in any way a serious threat in 2015.\nAnd this leads me to the Packers. The greatest concern here, as far as the secondary goes, is how great Aaron Rodgers can be when attacking specific matchups. Last season, Rodgers largely ignored Darrelle Revis and Brandon Browner, completing 3 of 9 passes for 58 yards and one touchdown against the pair, and instead targeted Logan Ryan (4 of 8, 97 yards), Kyle Arrington (5 of 6, 45 yards), Patrick Chung (4 of 4, 55 yards, one touchdown) and Alfonzo Dennard (2 of 2, 29 yards). What’s more, Rodgers was 10 of 13 for 184 yards and one touchdown on third down, and he only threw at the Revis-Browner combination once on third down, so Rodgers knew what he was doing.\nThe Packers are undermanned without Jordy Nelson, and Randall Cobb’s shoulder looks like it’ll be an issue from here on out. Davante Adams has been banged up, too. Can the Patriots’ secondary do enough to give Brady a chance there? Of course.\nHow do you think they'll shape the offensive line now with Nate Solder gone?\n--@TrollRelentless\nMy belief is this will be a one-for-one swap with Marcus Cannon taking over at left tackle. The interior linemen will continue to rotate, and Sebastian Vollmer will stay at right tackle.\nIf it were my call, I’d try Vollmer at left tackle and Cannon at right tackle, but I have absolutely no idea if that’s even possible. Vollmer hasn’t played left tackle in a game since 2009, and I’m not sure when he last practiced at that position. And maybe there’s a reason for that, which would make this entire point moot.\nAlso, if Vollmer were a serious candidate to play left tackle, why wouldn’t he have been used in the rotations in the first four games? Part of the reason for the rotations has been to give players additional experience, so that would have helped Vollmer. So again, that’s why I don’t think he is an option at the moment.\nBut if it were up to me, I’d say Vollmer is their best lineman, and left tackle is the most important position up front, so I’d see if it works.\nIs it just me, or has it seemed like Dominique Easley has been surprisingly better against the run than the pass this year?\n--@PatsPropaganda\nEasley has been good against the run. I think there might be a stigma against Easley for his run defense because he was viewed as such a gifted pass rusher coming out of Florida, but he can definitely destroy a line in the run game, too.\nGranted, Easley missed one game and all but eight plays of the opener, so the sample size is small, but I haven’t noticed Easley as the culprit for a compromised gap in any long runs this season. He had one run stuff and blew up a screen for a 3-yard loss against the Jaguars and was sound against the run Sunday against the Cowboys, when he also notched his first quarterback pressure of the regular season.\nEasley was dominant in the preseason, but I don’t think we’ve seen him hit that level yet in the regular season. When he gets rolling, watch out.\nIt seems there has been a drop-off in Rob Gronkowski’s production over the past two games. Have teams found a way to neutralize him a bit, and how can the Pats get him back in the flow?\n--@BostonWest80111\nGronkowski opened the season with 12 catches for 207 yards and four touchdowns in the first two games, but he has been held to eight receptions for 168 yards and no scores in the last two games. I understand the concern, and it’s not the first time I’ve heard the question this week, either, but this is a first-world problem. After all, the Patriots have scored 81 points in the last two games.\nWhy has Gronk slowed down from his Gronkulean start? Two totally unrelated factors. First, the Patriots pulled him late in the third quarter against the Jaguars because the game was out of hand and the Pats don’t want him in harm’s way. He went in for a few random plays in short-yardage and goal-line situations, but other than that, they wanted to make sure Gronkowski wouldn’t find himself vulnerable to a low hit on one of his seam routes in the open field.\nThen against the Cowboys, credit the pass rush more than anything. Brady was sacked five times in the first half and harassed more than that. There were plays when Gronk got open for a potentially long gain, but Brady was already hit or scrambling for his life. Cornerback Byron Jones played well against Gronkowski, but he had a ton of help, too. When Gronk lined up tight or in the slot, the Cowboys had a linebacker shading him to the inside, so it was tough to get open. The Cowboys played smart defense, and that’s something many teams don’t do with Gronk, but the pass rush was the primary factor. That’s why everything got straightened out in the second half.\nTom Brady wants to keep playing. Do the Pats trade Jimmy Garoppolo for draft picks?\n--@ZachJohnston76\nThis is another good problem to have. Because Brady is continuing to treat Father Time like Dick LeBeau, the Patriots will have a decision to make, perhaps as early as the conclusion of the 2016 season. Both Brady and Garoppolo are signed through 2017, the Patriots can’t realistically expect to keep both for another contract. Let’s say Brady is playing at 90 percent of his current level in two years and wants to play through the 2020-22 range. It’d be foolish to let him go, right? And because Brady has a proven track record over a decade and a half of signing a contract worth less than his market value, the Patriots can keep him at an affordable cost, adding to the no-brainer decision of keeping him.\nAs for Garoppolo, who has probably generated more buzz for his on-field performance than any current backup quarterback in the league, there’s simply no way the Patriots would be able to re-sign him when other teams offer him starting money. And there’s no way Garoppolo should ever agree to be a backup for the first eight years of his career when other teams will give him a shot.\nThis argument completely discounts any unforeseen circumstances, such as a devastating injury, or a change of heart from Brady (say, for instance, the Pats win two more Super Bowls and he retires) because we’d be here for hours sorting through that stuff. So basically, the Patriots will find themselves in a Groundhog Day situation in the 2017 draft. They can trade Garoppolo, likely for some very valuable assets, and draft Brady’s potential replacement yet again.\nHow has Patrick Chung evolved into such a valuable piece of the secondary?\n--@John_Carpenter1\nGood question. He’s been an underrated contributor this season. Quarterbacks are 3 of 10 for 21 yards and one touchdown when targeting Chung, who also has a pass breakup and has been flagged for pass interference and defensive holding. Chung has been responsible for opposing tight ends to a large degree, and he has done a vast majority of his work near the line of scrimmage. The Patriots are utilizing him well, and he has flourished, particularly against the run but also clearly in coverage.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:17:01.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
