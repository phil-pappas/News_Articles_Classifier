But necessary hotel bookings at Taiwan had to be confirmed to the Organisers by September 10,\" All India Sports Council of Deaf's Technical Advisor Somesh Sharma told PTI. \n\"Though we had requested for extension of date for confirmation of the team and even informed the organisers of the reduced team size on September 23. \n\"Now on arrival of the team, we are being directed to pay full hotel cost for 41ი persons i.e. USD 7200 extra in total from the actual rooms occupied. Passports of our 27 participants and one foreign currency in Card have been confiscated by the Organisers and full payment is being demanded,\" he added. \nSharma said the Sports Ministry has now stepped in to deal with the situation. \n\"Today we got letter from Mr Injeti Srinivas, DG SAI stating that he has instructed the Executive Director (Teams) to take immediate action to transfer necessary funds to salvage the situation,\" he said. \nEarlier, these athletes were forced to sleep on pavements in their wait for visa here ahead of the competition. \nThey spent a night outside a Gurudwara as authorities failed to provide accommodation to them. Sports Minister Sarbananda Sonowal had ordered an enquiry into the matter. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:20:08.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
