Krzyzewski has led the Americans since 2005. \nThe Duke coach has guided the Americans to consecutive Olympic gold medals, two world titles and a 75-1 record. He will stay on as a special adviser to Colangelo. \n\"What the program has accomplished over the last decade under the leadership of Jerry Colangelo and Mike Krzyzewski is truly impressive,\" Popovich said in a statement. \"I will do my utmost to maintain the high standards of success, class and character established by Jerry, Coach K and the many players who have sacrificed their time on behalf of USA Basketball.\" \nPopovich was a U.S. assistant in the 2002 world championships and 2004 Olympics, the low point of U.S. basketball. Colangelo was hired to assemble the national team program following the bronze medal in Athens. He selected Krzyzewski as his coach after also considering Popovich. \nKrzyzewski had decided that next summer will be his last as U.S. coach, and Colangelo decided not to wait to name a successor for the next Olympic cycle. He called Popovich \"one of the NBA's best and most successful coaches.\" \n\"By making this decision now, it will allow us to have a clean, efficient and immediate transition following the 2016 Olympic Games,\" he said. \nPopovich has a 1,022-470 record as an NBA coach, all with the Spurs, and will take over a U.S. program that has been nearly unbeatable under Krzyzewski. \nThe Americans finished third in the 2006 worlds, their first tournament under Krzyzewski, and have won 63 straight games. They will be heavily favored to win next summer in Rio de Janeiro with what Colangelo has already said could be the best U.S. team ever. \nThings could get a little trickier after that. FIBA, basketball's governing body, has already chosen a new qualification system for future worlds and Olympics that will include some games during the NBA season. \nPopovich had long been considered the best coach to take over once Krzyzewski decided not to return. He led the Spurs to championships in 1999, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2014, and like Coach K has military ties as a 1970 graduate of the U.S. Air Force Academy. \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press.
