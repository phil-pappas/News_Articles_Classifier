State TV says another flight is due later in the day.\nSaudi authorities say 769 pilgrims died in the stampede near Mecca in the worst disaster to strike the annual pilgrimage in a quarter-century. Iran appears to have lost the largest number of pilgrims, with 464 dead.\nIran has blamed Saudi \"mismanagement\" for the stampede, which took place after two waves of pilgrims converged on a narrow street, causing hundreds to suffocate or be trampled.\nAdvertisement", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:06:13.977+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
