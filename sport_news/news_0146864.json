He entered a not guilty plea in April. Police say the 6-foot-5, 335-pound Taylor choked and struck his then girlfriend several times on July 22, 2014 with a closed fist at UGA’s McWhorter Hall. \nTaylor was dismissed from Georgia after the incident and enrolled last January at Alabama after playing a season at Copiah-Lincoln Community College in Mississippi. \nTaylor was arrested again on March 28 in Tuscaloosa after another girlfriend accused him of assaulting her and Alabama also dismissed him. She recanted her story and was arrested for filing a false police report, but that was dismissed on July 7, the same day that Taylor pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor count of criminal mischief, according ESPN’s Outside the Lines. \nTaylor is enrolled at Southeastern Louisiana, but not playing this season. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:15:05.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
