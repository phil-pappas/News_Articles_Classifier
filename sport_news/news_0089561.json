They get their second bye on the final week of the schedule.\nIf the Eskimos finish first, they’ll have a bye that week, followed by a bye the following week while either Montreal, B.C. or Winnipeg play the Stampeders in the Western Final in Calgary.\nThat’s three weeks between games!\nIt’s the old ‘Rest vs Rust’ thing, times two.\nThe 12-4 Eskimos play the 2-13 Saskatchewan Roughriders Saturday. Win it and Edmonton’s magic number will be one. The Eskimos finish up against the 5-10 Montreal Alouettes at home next weekend.\nCalgary is enjoying their bye week this week, host Saskatchewan next week and finish up against the Lions in the final week of the schedule.\nDoes bye + bye = bye-bye?\nIt’s been an interesting year to throw challenges at CFL statistical magician Steve Daniel. But to this point he has no answer. To find out, he needs to go through each season in which the league has had nine teams, and thus bye weeks, dating back to the start of single-game playoffs.\nThe suspicion is that it may have never have happened before.\nIf the Eskimos make it happen, they’ll have finished the season with eight straight wins for the first time since 1982 and will have won 14 games in a season for the first time since 1989 when Edmonton had a 16-2 regular season and (wait for it) … lost the Western Final.\nWhen the league went away from best-of-three finals, the Eskimos finished first and went to the Grey Cup nine times from 1973 to 1982 but have only played host to the Western Final after a first-place finish and made it to the Grey Cup once since, that being in 2003, the last time the final was in Edmonton.\nFor the record, they followed through and won seven of those Grey Cups.\nThe Eskimos finished first, had the bye and lost the final five times — in 1988, 1989, 1991, 1997 and 2001.\nOn the flip side of that the Eskimos have won the semifinal and gone on the road to score the upset in the final in 1987, 1990, 1993, 1996 and 2005.\n- Related : Eskimos not taking the brutal Saskatchewan Roughriders for granted\n- Related: Eskimos head coach Chris Jones unhappy with team's practice Wednesday\nDating back to the Western final since 2005, there have been 10 Grey Cup berth showdowns and the home team with the bye and home-field advantage. There’s been no advantage.\n“Exactly half have won — two in the last five years, B.C. in 2011 and Calgary in 2014. Of the last 20 finals, East and West, division-winning teams produced an 11-9 (.550) record in the final at home when their cumulative regular season record is 239-119-2 (.667). Nine in 20 losing is a pattern.\n“And worse, in the three years from 2012 to 2014, only two of the six ‘favoured’ home teams coming off a bye well rested and all of that, were able to win.\n“Calgary in 2013 is a great case in point. The Stampeders clinched first on Oct. 18th and then didn’t play a meaningful game until Nov. 17th. That was 30 days, an extreme example of the trend. Calgary lost that final.”\nAfter 17 consecutive weeks without a bye and 12 years since the last time the Eskimos played host to a Western Final, who isn’t going to want to seize the opportunity of finishing first?\nWho isn’t going to want to be one win from the first Grey Cup since 2005?\nAfter having to play an injured Mike Reilly at quarterback in the Western Final last year in Calgary, the Eskimos know the flip side of it. It’s double the opportunity to heal bumps and bruises while the opposition is collecting more of them during those two weeks.\nBut as the Eskimos head to Regina for their second-last game of the season with their fate in their own hands, if they should proceed to put away first place, beware of three weeks of debate ahead.\nDoes bye + bye = bye-bye?\nFollow me on Twitter.com/sunterryjones\nterry.jones@sunmedia.ca\nPoll Would you prefer the Eskimos get a double-bye?
