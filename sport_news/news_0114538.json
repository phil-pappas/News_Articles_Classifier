Erick Fernandez Editorial Fellow, HuffPost Sports Posted: 10/19/2015 11:43 AM EDT \nThe New York Mets have a number of superstar comedians who are huge fans of the team, including Chris Rock and Jon Stewart. But in Game 2 of the NLCS, the cameras were set on Jerry Seinfeld. \nSeinfeld was having a great time as the Mets beat the Cubs 4-1 and took a 2-0 lead in the NLCS. In the third inning of Sunday's game, he was really, really getting into it. Not even Newman could spoil @JerrySeinfeld ’s mood during Game 2. http://t.co/KHGg5ByPFU #NLCS pic.twitter.com/T4ruKpzvO2 — MLB GIFS (@MLBGIFs) October 19, 2015 \nThat slow clap is mesmerizing. You can't help but keep watching. Seinfeld will surely be cheering on Tuesday as the Mets play Game 3 in Chicago.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T18:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T19:16:47.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
