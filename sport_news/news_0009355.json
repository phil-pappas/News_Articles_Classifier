He said he went to the NFL earlier this season and asked if there was a way that he could wear pink throughout the season, not just in the month of October,\" Salters reported. \"He wasn't able to do that, but what he did do is, he decided to streak his hair pink. He said breast cancer awareness is not just about October for me, it's not just a month, it's a lifestyle. It's about getting women to recognize to get tested.\" \nThe league, however, is insistent on keeping uniform policies consistent. Williams' argument is that the color isn't about uniform swag, standing out or selling the merchandise year round, it's about calling attention to the cause of breast cancer awareness. \n\"The same way it made you feel after you heard it -- like, man,\" Williams said after the game Monday. \"He told me no. I'm assuming they are telling everybody else no as well. ... It wasn't about selling it. You know and I know and everybody else knows before I made the phone call.\" Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T23:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:33:56.488+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
