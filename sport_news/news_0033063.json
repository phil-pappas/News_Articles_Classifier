Cross Country: Vermillion Will Bring Full Squad To Class A Meet BY JAMES D. CIMBUREK james.cimburek@yankton.net yankton.net | 0 comments \nA young squad that turned a corner has the Vermillion Tanagers’ appearance in today’s (Saturday) South Dakota State Cross Country Meet into a full team event instead of a one-girl show. \nVermillion qualified its girls’ team with a third place showing in the Region 3A meet, led by meet medalist and 2013 state champion Maddie Lavin. \n“They all started to figure things out,” said Vermillion head coach Kelly Fischbach. “Rachel (Brady) is healthy and a solid third runner. We also got Katie Kost and Madisen Martinez when the soccer season was over.” \nBesides Kost, a senior, Lavin and Martinez, both sophomores, and Brady, a freshman, the Tanagers’ state meet roster boasts sophomore Melissa Mikkelson and seventh grader Taryn Whisler. Lavin, who battled injuries last season, was 21st at state. \nThe Tanagers qualified out of a tough region, and that experience has Fischbach hopeful the Tanagers can finish well. \n“Going in, our goal is to finish in the top half,” Fischbach said. “If we can put three in the top part of the field, we can realistically finish in the top half as a team.” \nThe Tanagers also send one boy to state, freshman Justin Sorensen. Sorensen was a state meet qualifier a season ago. \n“Justin has consistently run in the low 18-minute range. He is a very smart runner, very focused,” Fischbach said. “He’s only going to get better and he knows what to expect. \n“He is very mature for being a freshman.” \nThe state meet is today at Yankton Trails Park in Sioux Falls. The Class A girls’ race is set for 1:30 p.m. The Class A boys’ race will begin at approximately 3 p.m. \nHere is a look at other area Class A teams in the field. Teams with scoring squads (four or more runners in boys or girls) are listed first. \nBeresford \nThe Beresford girls, ninth in Class A a season ago, will look to build on that finish with a young but talented squad. \n“Last year we weren’t too happy with ninth,” said Beresford head coach Matthew Coy. “It was a good experience for them. They have used it as motivation.” \nBeresford won the Region 3A title on its home course, led by returning state placewinner Ashlynn Atwood (17th). She is one of three juniors on the squad, joined by Kendra Schaap and Caitlin Worth. Sophomore Cait Savey, freshman Grace Quartier and eighth grader Sabrina Swee have also run well for the Watchdogs. \nThe Watchdogs have not been beaten in 2015, meaning they are aiming high at state. \n“The girls have their sights set on the awards stand,” Coy said. “They’re not trying to find teams to pass, just going out and running their race.” \nThe Beresford boys just missed a state berth, and will send two boys, junior Jake Limmer and freshman Alec Atwood. Atwood was 22nd in the state as an eighth grader. \n“Jake’s making his third state meet trip, Alec his second,” Coy said. “Alec has a chance to be in the top 15. Jake can get in the top 40. They’re pumped for state.” \nEthan-Parkston \nA young Ethan-Parkston team will look to leave its mark on Yankton Trails Park today. \n“I think we’ve been running well,” said head coach Jared Digmann. “The main thing will be showing up and doing what we can do.” \nA.J. Zolnowsky is the lone senior for Ethan-Parkston, which placed 11th in the state meet a year ago. The squad also boasts junior Jonah Murtha, sophomores Erik Fuerniss, Tanner Hohn and Tucker Murtha, and eighth grader Cordell Murtha. \n“We knew there were four good teams in the boys’ race (at regions),” Digmann said. “We’d been dealing with illness, but the guys were able to put it together.” \nWhile defending champion West Central and Region 3A champ Sioux Falls Christian have been dominant in many races this season, the rest of the field is a toss-up, according to Digmann. \n“There are two solid teams. Everyone else is fighting for the rest,” he said. “Third through 11th, 12th, will come down to whoever has the best day.” \nEthan-Parkston will also send two girls to state, freshman Patience Nesheim and eighth grader Sydney Wickersham. Wickersham was 25th at state a year ago. \n“Both have a shot at a state place,” Digmann said. “It depends on who has a good race that day.” \nDakota Valley \nDakota Valley will take three boys and a girl to state, with junior Marisa Schulz returning to the meet after placing 11th a year ago. \nOn the boys’ side, the Panthers will run senior Charlie Long, junior Jon Green and eighth grader Joe Graves. \nElk Point-Jefferson \nThe Huskies send two runners to state, senior Josie Heeren and eighth grader Robin Stark. Heeren, a state meet veteran, was second in the 800 and fourth in the 1600 at the state track meet this past spring. \nWagner \nThe Red Raiders send two runners to state, senior Sadie Eitemiller and sophomore Taylor Eitemiller. \nFollow @JCimburek on Twitter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:28:55.963+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
