Their last win in Ruston was the Cajuns’ last win in the series, back in 1996 when Jake Delhomme was quarterback. \nSince then, it’s been all Tech. And only one of those games have been close. \nIt’s not a surprise the Cajuns are 18 point underdogs for this game. Tech has played well and is just a couple of plays from being 4-0 and perhaps nationally ranked. \nCan the Cajuns win? Sure. When you take the field there’s always a chance. But the margin for error is very, very small. If Louisiana is to have a chance, here’s what needs to happen. \n1.. DON’T LET DIXON YAC –Of course, this is easier said than done. Dixon might be the best RB Tech has ever had…and they’ve had some good ones. His ability to spin out of tackles and get extra yardage is part of what makes him great. The Cajuns’ defense MUST do a good job of tackling against DIxon and not let him turn a three yard gain into an eight yard (or more) gain. \n2. MAKE THE BULLDOGS DRIVE — The Cajuns’ best chance in this game is to shorten the number of possessions. Tech is going to score. If the Cajuns make the Bulldogs use lots of plays and clock when they do score, there will be fewer opportunities for them to put up points (which they can do in a hurry.) The Cajuns can’t let Dixon get loose and can’t let Jeff Driskel make the big play. If the Cajuns can stay within shouting distance going into the fourth quarter, anything can happen. \n3. MAKE TECH BRING PEOPLE – Louisiana Tech’s front four is superior to Kentucky and superior to Akron. The Cajuns’ offensive line must do a good enough job against that front to make Tech use their linebackers to help out. That gives either Haack or Nixon some chances in the passing game, which is the underbelly of the Bulldogs’ defense. \n4. GET ELI IN SPACE – Whether it be by splitting him out, putting him in the slot or just getting him outside in the running game, the Cajuns won’t get it done offensively just running McGuire between the tackles, especially against this front four. Find a way to give him a chance to make a big play. \n5. GOTTA TURN EM OVER – Turnover margin is important every week. The Cajuns have forced exactly two turnovers in the first two games. If that doesn’t change this week, the Cajuns cannot win. And, plus one probably won’t be good enough. The offense must help by playing turnover free football. But the defense has to step up in this category this week if the Cajuns are going to have a chance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:33:08.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
