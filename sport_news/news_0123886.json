That's down from the 9.7 percent annual gain recorded in August and the slowest annual increase since June 2014.\nThat increase still ranks as the sixth fastest among the major metros that Axiometrics tracks. But the average apartment rent in Denver actually fell $5 between August and September to $1,359 a month, according to Axiometrics.\n\"If job growth continues to decline, the demand for apartments won't be as heavy. In turn, landlords will not be able to raise rents as much,\" Axiometrics vice president of research Stephanie McCleskey said in her report.\nSeveral markets — especially on the north side — are still seeing double-digit annual increases. Westminster led the metro area for the second month with a 13.8 percent gain in average rents. Northeast Denver was second at 12.6 percent, while the Northglenn-Thornton area had a 12.5 percent gain.\nDifferent parts of Aurora are still seeing double-digit increases, as did southeast Denver and the Arvada-Broomfield market.\nDowntown represented the weakest market in the survey for both rent increases, 2 percent, and for occupancy, at 94.3 percent.", "external_links": ["http://www.axiometrics.com/"], "published": "2015-10-23T18:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:05:35.024+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
