Sometimes, people, sometimes old-school people will say old-school things that they used to say back in the '50s. But it’s not allowed anymore - in 2015 - to talk like that. \n“The old school bar is now closed. You need to respect and work with everybody.” \nAubut, 67, resigned on Saturday after a week in which three women came forward with allegations of sexual harassment. \n“I would like to take this opportunity to apologize to those who may have been offended by my behaviour,” the former chief executive officer of the Quebec Nordiques said in a statement. “I realize that my attitude could at times be perceived as questionable by some women and could have caused them to feel uncomfortable.” \nAccording to a statement released Saturday by the COC, the original complainant, a female colleague, has asked for her complaint to be withdrawn. As a result, an investigation headed by Francois Rolland, the former chief justice of the Quebec Supreme Court, has been suspended. \nA third-party investigation into the other complaints will move forward. \n“It has been a horrible time for us the last few days,” Brassard said. “At first, it started with a complaint within the COC and rapidly it became a Pandora’s box, where every day was something new happening. \n“The first and foremost thing is to make sure the team is OK, the group is good and the employees are comfortable. We don’t want anybody to hide anything and maybe regret a few years from now that they didn’t say anything.” \nAs the week went on, Brassard found himself fielding questions about why he never said anything about Aubut’s alleged conduct with women. \n“Marcel, the former president, was a guy who everybody knew sometimes was a little awkward,” said Brassard, who has attended numerous public functions over the years with Aubut. “Sometimes, he was awkward in the way he walked, in the way he dressed, and the way he spoke to the public. \n\"But the problem is, I never noticed anything (in terms of harassment). I heard some stories, but no facts. No nothing.” \nUnder Aubut, the COC made huge gains in sponsorship. Just last week, the professional services company Deloitte announced a 16-year partnership extension. \nThe question remains whether the Aubut scandal will affect the bottom line. \n“If we lose a sponsor, we’ll be the ones responsible for it,” Brassard said. ‘We’ll have to face it. We’ll have to deal with it. \n“But also in the end, it’s also a great opportunity to show our sponsors we can make a difference and lead the discussion on this topic.” \nOn Saturday, the COC publicly thanked the original complainant for her “incredible courage” in coming forward. \nBrassard hopes other women (and men) hear about her experience and speak out about their own experiences in the workplace – no matter how frightening that may seem. \n“Very few women talk about these things,” Brassard said. “It really matters that we show the example to the whole country that it’s not taboo anymore to do that. \n“We know that it’s tough as a woman, because sometimes, when you decide to speak about things like that, it can mean you lose maybe 25 to 30 years of a career. And you’re scared to lose all of that work, and then maybe just being left over when the story is over. \n“The COC needs to be an example, and that’s the most important thing at this time.” \nThe COC is expected to name a new president within days. \nvhall@postmedia.com \nAthletes shouldn't be affected by Aubut scandal \nIn Dominick Gauthier’s mind, the Marcel Aubut scandal will have zero effect on Canada’s athletes heading into the 2016 Summer Games. \nThe countdown to Rio sits at 306 days, and Aubut stepped down Saturday, amid allegations of sexual harassment, as president of the Canadian Olympic Committee – leaving the organization temporarily rudderless. \n“I don’t think there’s one athlete this week who has been disturbed in the sense that this could hurt his or her focus on the Olympics,” Gauthier, who co-founded the B2ten group of silent benefactors who have provided money and resources to Canadian Olympic athletes to get them on the podium. “As an athlete myself or for the people I’ve coached, we couldn’t care less who is up there. We just hope we’re well prepared, and the COC has done a good job at preparing the athletes and will continue to do so. \n“For an athlete, it’s just like nothing happened.” \nMost athletes, Gauthier contends, have little to no contact with the COC president. \n“They’re super removed,” said Gauthier, who coached mogul skiers Jenn Heil and Alex Bilodeau to Olympic gold. “You see the guy pop in during the Olympics at the Canadian Olympic House for medal celebrations. Seriously, you would hear him do a speech and move on to celebrate with your close ones. At that’s only if you win a medal. If you don’t win a medal, you won’t even see him. \n“So it doesn’t matter. People just aren’t aware of what happens at the COC office.” \nCanada’s summer Olympians are expected to gather in Toronto in December for a week of Rio preparations. Chef de mission Jean-Luc Brassard expects the athletes will receive a briefing on the Aubut situation and what’s being done to ensure the COC is a safe working environment for all concerned. \n“From the athletes’ point of view towards Rio, as the chef de mission, it would have been impossible to keep going without the resignation of the president at this time,” Brassard said. “The relationship with athletes is based on confidence. And if that’s not there, there’s no point to work with the athletes. They won’t believe you. The trust won't be there and the results will not be there. \n“We’ll explain to the athletes what happened. We’re clean and transparent and we want to work with them on a new basis with a new president. \n“I don’t see this as a problem for Rio. It’s short notice, but it’s not a last-minute notice.” Sponsored Links Jean-Luc Brassard says Aubut allegations a 'Pandora's box' for COC COC says original complainant has withdrawn her complaint By VICKI HALL , Postmedia Network First posted: Saturday, October 03, 2015 08:59 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 03, 2015 09:41 PM EDT \nAs chef de mission, Jean-Luc Brassard is the official cheerleader for Canada’s Olympians at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio. \nCalgary - As chef de mission, Jean-Luc Brassard is the official cheerleader for Canada’s Olympians at the 2016 Summer Games in Rio. \nBut the 1994 Olympic gold medallist in freestyle skiing jumped into a new role Saturday in the aftermath of Marcel Aubut resigning as president of the Canadian Olympic Committee amid allegations of sexual harassment. \nIn the midst of an organizational crisis, Brassard, 43, sees himself as a leader in a nationwide conversation about what is and isn’t acceptable in today’s workplace.
