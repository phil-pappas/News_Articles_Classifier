There is no better feeling than to cross the finish line and pump your fist,’’ Belcher told the Daily Telegraph after he and Ryan held off their nearest rivals, Croatians Sime Fantela and Igor Marenic for a narrow five-point win.\nTACTICAL BATTLEFIELD: Aussies slip down\n“This is a really big confidence booster for us ahead of Rio. It was very important.’’\n“It’s a special feeling to defend your championship title.’’\nMat Belcher and Will Ryan won the Rio test event in the lead-up to the world 470 championships. Source: Supplied\nBelcher, who is set to become a father for teh second time in december, and Ryan lead the 470 world championship regatta early before falling to third overall after one particularly bad day on the water. But the duo, favourite for gold in Rio, worked their way back up into the lead the day just a day before yesterday’s final, double points Medal race.\n“I never thought I would be able to achieve six world titles in a row, but everything for us is about next year,’’ said Belcher who could became the first Australian skipper to defend an Olympic title if he and Ryan win in Rio next year.\n“Obviously Will and I are really happy. We are really proud to be able to perform under this pressure and it will help us come next year.’’\nTo come away with a win here is pretty special. It was close and a nice battle.”\nBelcher and Ryan are coached by Victor Kovalenko who has now mentoree crews to 18 world championship crowns during his extraordinary career.\nBelcher and Ryan formed their partnership and Belcher and his old crewmate Mal Page won gold at the London Olympics. The pair also won three world titles together before Ryan stepped into the boat for the retired Page.\n Belcher, Ryan on top of the world", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7b8f4c0e26bc89de811c9a8ca640fae4", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9d92df3f5d260ab673e6be99c69eb3bc", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/rio-olympic-favourite-mat-belcher-sails-into-history-as-he-and-crew-will-ryan-win-world-470-championship/story-fni2flhh-1227573268301", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/rio-olympic-favourites-mat-belcher-will-ryan-lose-world-470-sailing-lead-in-light-winds/story-fni2flhh-1227569937994", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/sport/olympic-champion-mat-belcher-and-crew-will-ryan-record-perfect-day-in-defence-of-world-sailing-crown/story-fni2flhh-1227567261626", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/"], "published": "2015-10-18T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:27:36.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
