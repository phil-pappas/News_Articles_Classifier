Laquon Treadwell caught five passes for 102 yards and a touchdown and Jaylen Walton ran for 97 yards. \nTexas A&M (5-2, 2-2) has lost two straight. Sophomore Kyle Allen completed just 12 of 34 passes for 88 yards before being replaced by Jake Hubenak early in the fourth quarter. \nOle Miss jumped out to a 16-3 lead by halftime and put the game out of reach with a 58-yard touchdown pass from Kelly to Treadwell with 9:16 left in the third quarter. \nOle Miss then relied on its defense to coast to a surprisingly one-sided win. \nThe victory was vital for Ole Miss as it continues to control its own fate in the Western Division thanks to a win over Alabama in September. The Rebels are still a game behind first-place LSU, but host the Tigers on Nov. 21 in Oxford. \nOle Miss wasn't at its best offensively — Kelly threw three interceptions — but still pushed out to a 13-0 lead midway through the second quarter following a 7-yard touchdown pass from Kelly to Evan Engram and two field goals. \nThe final few minutes of the second half were eventful with three turnovers on three consecutive plays — two by Texas A&M and one by Ole Miss. The Rebels were able to convert the Aggies' second miscue into a field goal for a 16-3 halftime lead. \nOle Miss left tackle Laremy Tunsil started his first game of the season after serving a seven-game NCAA suspension for receiving illegal benefits. It appeared the All-SEC junior had an immediate impact — the Rebels ran for 141 yards in the first half after having just 40 yards on the ground total in last week's loss to Memphis. \nIt was the first true road game for Texas A&M this season and its offense looked disjointed for most of the night. It was a tough night for Allen, who was 0 of 13 passing in the third quarter, missing badly on several throws. \nIt wasn't immediately clear why the Aggies turned to Hubenak late in the game instead of listed backup Kyler Murray. \nOle Miss played without star defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche, who suffered a concussion last week against Memphis. \nThe Rebels didn't seem to miss him. Texas A&M managed just 192 total yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:19:46.458+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
