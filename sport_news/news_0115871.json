We have known each other since we were very young and if Cesc doesn't win he might not talk to you for the whole day or won't answer your calls.” \nFabregas made his Spain debut in a friendly against Ivory Coast in Valladolid in March 2006 and played a key role in the back-to-back European titles in 2008 and 2012 and the debut World Cup triumph in 2010. \nHis penalty to win the quarter-final shootout against Italy at Euro 2008 is widely seen as a turning point in Spain's fortunes and they ended decades of underachievement by going on to beat Germany 1-0 in the final in Vienna. \n“I would be thrilled to reach this milestone (100 caps), hopefully it will happen,” Fabregas told Marca Radio. \n“When I went to London it was a big change but I was clear that my goal was to be a footballer,” he added. “I will always have a special affection for Arsenal.” \nSpain can make sure of their place at Euro 2016 with a win against group minnows Luxembourg in Logrono. \nVicente del Bosque's side have 21 points from their eight Group C matches, two ahead of Slovakia, who host Belarus tomorrow. Ukraine are third on 16 points ahead of their match away to bottom side Macedonia. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:04:28.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
