It was a disappointing way to draw. \n\"We didn't have too many chances after they scored and that was another disappointment. \n\"We didn't react and mentally we didn't have that reaction to go again after they scored.\" \nSubstitute Christian Benteke looked like he had settled a turgid encounter with a thumping 77th-minute header, but Sadio Mane forced home an 86th-minute equaliser from close range - only to spoil his afternoon by getting sent off for a second yellow card in stoppage time. \nKlopp was disappointed with the concession of the goal, which came from a free-kick at which they were not strong enough defensively in the air. \nThe German recognises this is a problem which stems back to long before he took over, but has urged the players to stop allowing themselves to be worried by what has dogged them in the past when it comes to set-pieces. \n\"You hope nothing happens when a ball goes in the air - I have seen things like this not only with my team but other teams. It is a self-fulfilling prophecy,\" Klopp said. \n\"You see the ball in the air and you think, 'Oh my God'. That is what you have to change. \n\"I hope I am not the only person in the stadium who felt it was not the end of the world. \n\"We can work with this result. We can work with this performance of the team. \n\"If I had the feeling these guys were not ready for fighting then it would be really bad news, but everyone saw how ready they are and that is the most important thing.\" \nKlopp has stressed since replacing Brendan Rodgers at the helm just over a fortnight ago that there will be no quick turnaround in fortunes. \nHe knows it will take time to implement his methods, but Milner believes they are edging closer to where he wants them to be. \n\"We're not that far away,\" the England midfielder added. \"We've only lost two games this year. We have drawn eight of the last nine or something ridiculous like that. \n\"We're not a million miles away. We know we need to improve and know we can improve. \n\"We feel we can perform a lot better but we're not losing the games, looking on the positive side.\" \nBenteke's third goal of the season was a powerful header from Milner's cross, and his team-mate knows getting the Belgium international back from a hamstring injury which sidelined him for a month will boost Liverpool's chances going forward. \nAnd that does not even take into account the missing Henderson, Daniel Sturridge and Danny Ings. \n\"It wasn't bad, was it?\" Milner said of Benteke's goal. \n\"We don't want to talk too much about injuries. It's an easy excuse and we don't want to go down that route - we're better than that. \n\"We have quality players regardless of our injury list, but to get Christian back is great. \n\"The strikers we have at the club offer different things. They're a good mix, and there will be a lot of changes to the way we play.\" \nSouthampton manager Ronald Koeman also took the positives from a point at Anfield - a result which maintained Saints' unbeaten away form in the league this term. \n\"It is very positive,\" said the Dutchman, whose side won at Chelsea and have drawn their other four matches on the road. \"It is one point, one point, one point, one point, but out of the five, Chelsea and Liverpool are difficult away games that tells how we grow as a team. \n\"We are a bit unhappy with the way we played, and that is a good mentality.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T12:31:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:24:15.402+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
