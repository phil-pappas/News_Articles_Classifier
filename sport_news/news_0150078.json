Five different Green Wave receivers caught touchdown passes. \nTulane (2-2, 1-0) took advantage of three interceptions and two fumbles, scoring 28 points off turnovers, and held the Knights (0-5, 0-1) to minus-35 yards rushing. \nA 49-yard pass from Lee to Teddy Veal one play after a fumble and a 4-yard run by Sherman Badie soon after an interception on consecutive possessions led to a 24-10 halftime lead. \nTwo-time defending conference champion UCF has been hit hard by injuries this season, particularly on offense. Freshman Bo Schneider threw for 236 yards and a score but had three picks. Another freshman, Tyler Harris, came in and threw three fourth-quarter touchdowns, all to freshman D'erren Wilson.
