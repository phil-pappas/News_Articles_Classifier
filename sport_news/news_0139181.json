(Photo: Submitted Photo) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nEntering the Sunday, the final day of regionals for Michigan's high school equestrian teams, Hartland believed it to be all but over. For the second straight year, it was sure it would fall short of the state finals once again. \nEagles coach Marcia Deyoung gathered her team that afternoon at lunch and told them what it was going to take in order to make that leap from fifth place in second, the qualifying spot to reach states. \n\"We thought it was a longshot,\" Deyoung said. \"I pretty much said, basically, 'Yeah, you need to place very well (in Sunday's competitions) to make it. And oh yeah, it was a surprise thing at the end.\" \nIt took a nearly-perfect day to make that climb, for the Eagles to avoid the same fate as 2014 — when they fell 16 points short of being named the Division A Reserve Champions, what equestrian teams refer to as second place — and, somehow, they got it. \nWith a total of 326 points, Hartland made the cut, coming in behind the Divison A Grand Champions, Goodrich, which scored 437 points. Howell also made the cut in Division B, the Highlanders winning their region with 481 points. \nBoth schools will partake in the state finals from Oct. 14-18 in Midland. \nBrighton, which competed in Howell's group, missed the cut with a sixth-place finish. \n\"Oh, the kids were really happy,\" Deyoung said. \"We were all really happy.\" \nHartland's Rylee Burke (55) and Dawson Deyoung (55) led the Eagles in scoring. \nFor the Eagles, it marks their first trip to the state finals since 2011. Only one rider on the team was part of the 2011 group; however, the coach said she felt her team had the experience to make it a successful trip. \nWhether or not it can win is yet to be seen. That could also be viewed as a longshot considering Goodrich's impressive score of 437. The 111-point margin of victory isn't something Hartland's accustomed to seeing. \n\"We hate it when someone is 100 points ahead of us, because we know we struggled to get caught up and beat them,\" Marcia Deyoung said. \"I would say they were really good with good riders and good horses, but we did have some issues. \n\"Cold, nasty, windy weather, which was also an issue because the horses don't perform as well cause we're outside. That's the same for everybody, I know. But I would say we definitely had some mistakes we need to work on.\" \nAsked what it will take to correct those mistakes and Marcia Deyoung said: \"A lot of hard work.\" \n\"It's all patterns, so it's very hard,\" the Hartland coach said, \"and basically at this point, you have all the top riders and teams there in the whole state.\" \nAnd while they might not might not win, the Eagles know they're one of them.
