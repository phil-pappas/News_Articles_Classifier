Would you wander under leafy canopies to play Poohsticks on a wood bridle bridge? Would you be willing to learn about gorse flowers, bluebells and Scots pines from a landscape designer sourcing a silly old bear?\nTurns out, you can tread that thin line between fantasy and real life with a copy of Kathryn Aalto 's book, \"The Natural World of Winnie-the-Pooh: A Walk Through the Forest that Inspired the Hundred Acre Wood\" ($24.99, Timber Press ).\nIn the 308-page hardback book, Aalto explains why readers have been captivated by Winnie-the-Pooh characters since A.A. Milne, a respected English playwright and humorous, introduced them almost 90 years ago.\nMilne based his creations Pooh Bear, Piglet, Eeyore, Kanga, Roo and Tigger on his young son's stuffed animal menagerie and their woodland world on real Ashdown Forest, a wildlife haven in East Sussex, 30 miles south of London, England.\nAalto takes us on a delightful, fact-filled tour of Milne's wanderings through the gardens of his rural Cotchford Farm home, into the unspoiled countryside and down footpaths deep into the forest.\nShe reports on the importance Milne placed on nature and describes his adventures with his wife, aptly nicknamed after the Daphne flower, and their only child, Christopher Robin Milne. They would hike in search of wildlife and maybe a hidden heffalump.\nMilne referred to Ashdown Forest this way: \"In that enchanted place on the top of the forest a little boy and his bear will always be playing.\"\nWith Aalto's help, you can reenter a world where sad donkeys are cheered up by less-than-perfect birthday presents and a confused but endearing bear lets his heart – and love of \"huuny\" – lead the way.\nAalto's journey to connect Milne's characters with his environment was prompted by her move from the Pacific Northwest to Exeter, England. As she and her family explored Ashdown Forest, she could relate the beloved children's stories to the sounds, scents and sights in the lowland heath, tamed woodland and valley bog.\nTwitchers, warblers and turtle doves as well as flowers and trees are identified in Aalto's color photographs. Could that ancient black walnut tree, with the inviting opening, be Pooh's home?\nHistory fans will appreciate learning about the people who have foraged and feasted in this forest, from 11th century deer hunters to the 16th century when Henry VIII courted Anne Boleyn at her nearby Hever Castle.\nOther famous residents in the woodland region were Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, author of the Sherlock Holmes stories, British prime minister Harold Macmillan, who hosted John F. Kennedy at his manor on the edge of the forest, and Rolling Stone guitarist Brian Jones.\nA passage on page 126 of the book shows Aalto's deep research of Milne's life and the real Five Hundred Acre Wood in Ashdown Forest that inspired stories about a happy-go-lucky bear and his companions.\n\"Leaving Cotchford Farm with their backs to Jib Jacks Hill, father and son walked down the dirt lane which today is still as cratered as the moon as it was during Milne's day. They would wander down the dirt path under the canopy of trees to Posingford Wood, which is about half a mile wide and extends from the river at the bottom of the hill to the top of Ashdown Forest. Christopher Robin remembers it as \"a gay and friendly wood, the sort of wood you could happily walk through at night, feeling yourself a skillful rather than a brave explorer.\" It was filled with hazels, willows, sweet chestnuts, and occasional oaks and pines. Medieval farms line the land, which comes to a serene intersection ancient beyond memory or record. Here a narrower track branches off and begins a gentle descent along the woodland that is filled year-round with liquid warbles and hard cackles of song thrushes, magpies, blue tits, robins, and many more birds of the area.\"\nYou can easily see the landscape from Aalto's descriptions but the way she bundles fact with well-loved fiction makes you want to dust off your tattered copies of the pre-Disney \"Winnie-the-Pooh\" and \"The House at Pooh Corner\" and plan a picnic in Ashdown Forest (or at least send a donation to the Friends of Ashdown Forest to help protect the more than 6,000 acres for generations to come).\nYou can meet Aalto at the Northwest Flower & Garden Show in Seattle Feb. 17-21.\nUntil then, take this book outdoors, settle into a cushy spot and listen to birds and the breeze as you follow in Winnie's footprints and see the places that are the foundations to E.H. Shepard's illustrations, which are as iconic as Milne's words.\nOr act like the heart-led inhabitants of the Hundred Acre Wood, use this book as a travel guide – there are plenty of directions and details – and experience Ashdown Forest for yourself.\n-- Janet Eastman\njeastman@oregonian.com\n503-799-8739\n@janeteastman", "external_links": ["http://www.gardenshow.com/", "http://www.timberpress.com/books/natural_world_winnie_pooh/aalto/9781604695991", "http://www.timberpress.com/", "https://twitter.com/janeteastman", "http://www.friendsofashdownforest.co.uk/"], "published": "2015-10-03T16:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:38:46.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
