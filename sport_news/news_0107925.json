A home run. Vance Law.” \nBy the time the announcer said “it could be,” the ball was already in the stands. But he finished his thought anyhow. \nBy now, you probably figured out that announcer was Harry Caray. \nI recently tried to pin down the exact date of when that game was. I remember it happened at Wrigley Field, and it was a Law three-run homer. In looking at game logs from Law’s 1988 season, I narrowed it down to three games: May 8 against the San Francisco Giants; Sept. 21 against the Montreal Expos; or Oct. 1 against the Pittsburgh Pirates. \nI was able to figure out which of those three games it was, but I’ll save that for later in the story. \nI was 11 years old when I watched my first Cubs game, and I knew this would be the team I’d root for. \nMy dad was a big baseball fan, but he didn’t really have an allegiance to a team. He grew up in New York hating the Yankees and loving Duke Snider. \nHowever, the Dodgers moved to L.A. when he was a boy, and he never really latched on to another team. \nSo the timing of me becoming a Cubs fan couldn’t have been any better. It was something my dad and I could take an interest in together. \nWe both became huge Cubs fans that season, and we watched games together for years after that (much to my mom’s chagrin.) \nI quickly gravitated to Ryne Sandberg as my favorite player. He was amazing to watch. He made fielding look so effortless, and he hit the ball with equal ease. \nI can still remember watching the first night game at Wrigley Field, on Aug. 8, 1988, and Sandberg hit the first home run under the lights. \nUnfortunately, the game was called because of rain, and the first official night game happened the next night. \nWhich brings me back to my first Cubs game experience. The three games I referenced happened on May 8, Sept. 21 and Oct. 1. Since I remember watching that first game under the lights on Aug. 8, that means the first Cubs game I ever watched was the May 8 game against San Francisco because the other two games happened after the lights went on. \nGlad I figured that one out. \nThe next year, in 1989, the Cubs made a run into the playoffs, only to lose to San Francisco in five games. I was in seventh grade. \nI wouldn’t see the Cubs make the playoffs again until 1998, my third year of college. They didn’t make it out of the divisional round. \nOf course, there was the 2003 fiasco when Steve Bartman became an unfortunate household name. The Cubs fell in the NLCS to the Marlins after making it out of the divisional round. \nThe Cubs made quick exits from the divisional rounds in 2007 and 2008, and I haven’t had hope since. \nUntil now. \nThis team has a feel like the 1989 playoff team. That team was loaded with talent. It had veteran players like Sandberg, Andre Dawson, Shawon Dunston and Rick Sutcliffe. Then there was the young talent in Greg Maddux, Mark Grace, Damon Berryhill, Joe Girardi, Dwight Smith, Jerome Walton and Mitch “Wild Thing” Williams. \nThis current roster has veterans like Anthony Rizzo, Starlin Castro, Jake Arrieta and Jon Lester. Then there’s the young talent: Kris Bryant, Kyle Schwarber, Addison Russell and Jorge Soler. \nBeing a Cubs fan isn’t easy. Most years, I’m looking forward to football season by June. But not this year. The Cubs have been in it the whole way. \nMaybe this won’t be the year the Cubs win it all. Maybe it will be. \nEither way, I hope I’m around to see it happen. The average male in the U.S. lives to be 76, which, at 38, means my life could be half over. \nBut I’ve still got another half in which I might see something most living people have never seen – the Cubs hoisting the World Series trophy. \nWalters can be reached at (321) 242-3681 or twalters@floridatoday.com 25 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1LGtdbY TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:18:04.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
