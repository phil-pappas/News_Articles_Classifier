Centennial rolled to a 40-8 victory at Hawks Stadium in a Region 7-5A football game. \nCentennial had a 33-0 lead by halftime as Rossview was able to get on the scoreboard with eight points in the second half. But by that point, it was too late as Rossview fell to 6-3 on the season and 3-3 in region play. \nThe tone for Friday's matchup was established by Centennial on the opening play of the game as the Texas A&M-bound Tyrel Dodson took the kickoff 87 yards for a touchdown. The Cougars followed with a two-point conversion and were up 8-0 with 11:40 remaining in the first quarter. \nDevious Christman had 15 catches from quarterback Tristan Pisacane for a total of 118 yards and a touchdown. Mondu Sawyers caught nine passes from Pisacane for 142 yards and two scores. A field goal and two successful two-point conversions gave the Cougars 33 points at the break. \nRossview did have some flashes on defense. Fred Orr and Isaiah Philips each intercepted balls in the end zone, which ended Centennial drives, but the Hawks' offense was unable to achieve much success against Centennial's quick defensive unit. \nWith 6:34 remaining in the third quarter, Sawyers scored a 25-yard touchdown to extend Centennial's lead to 40-0. \nOn Rossview's next possession, Ethan Clayton broke to the outside and scored on an 85-yard run with 7:00 left in the game. \n“Centennial outplayed us tonight, it's as simple as that,\" Rossview coach Ron Lambert said. \"Other than that, I've got nothing else to say about it.\" \n“We've got one game left and we need one win to get in, so we'll see Northeast next week.” \nRossview faces the Eagles next week to determine its playoff fate. Centennial moves to 8-1 (6-0 in region) and faces Henry County next week.
