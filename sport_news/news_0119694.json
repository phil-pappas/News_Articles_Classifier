I think for me, I have to play my same game. I know what I can bring. I'm confident I can help the team in whatever role I'm thrown into. I'm excited about the challenge [Saturday].\" \nThe Flyers (3-2-1), though upset Couturier was sidelined, didn't seem to have a lot of anger over the fact Rinaldo wasn't suspended. \n\"We've got bigger fish to fry here,\" Simmonds said. \"We've got a game against the New York Rangers and we're not dwelling about what happened in Boston the other night. We won the game; we got the two points. We're just looking ahead.\" \nThe Rangers (5-2-1), who entered Friday tied for second in the NHL in goals allowed (two per game), have won four of their last five meetings against the Flyers. \n\"Well, we hadn't won in Boston since 2011, so I guess we're changing how we play,\" Giroux said. \"Hopefully, we can keep changing things because we haven't been successful against the Rangers.\" \nBreakaways. If backup goalie Michal Neuvirth (upper-body injury) can't dress Saturday, the Flyers would have to call up Jason LaBarbera from the Phantoms. . . . Defenseman Luke Schenn, who played well Wednesday after sitting out the previous three games as a healthy scratch, will remain in the lineup. . . . Diminutive Mats Zuccarello and Oscar Lindberg have four goals each to lead the Rangers. . . . Brayden Schenn will return to the lineup Saturday after missing one game with an apparent shoulder injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:30:45.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
