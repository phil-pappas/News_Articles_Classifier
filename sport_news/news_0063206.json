They run in there and nobody tackles them, and they fall down. Their guys must have broken eight tackles on their big runs. Our guys go in there and just fall on the ground. Nobody tackles them. That’s just the way we are I guess. We are a struggling bunch.” \nThis was not the first time that a loss to LSU gave a coach a sense of finality. \n“This was the worst beating we’ve taken since the 1960s,” Alabama coach Bear Bryant said after No. 11 LSU defeated the No. 8 Tide, 20-10, on Nov. 6, 1982, in Legion Field in Birmingham, Alabama. It was Bryant’s first loss to LSU since 1970, and he soon began considering retirement. He lost his next two, including his first loss to Auburn since 1972. He announced his resignation that December and died the following January. \nMILES ON CHUBB: Without being asked, LSU coach Les Miles expressed his sorrow for injured Georgia tailback Nick Chubb at his press luncheon on Monday. \nChubb, a sophomore from Cedartown, Georgia, who was the SEC freshman of the year last season and a freshman All-American, tore ligaments in his knee on Saturday in a loss to Tennessee and is out for the season. \n“I am kind of taken back a little by Nick Chubb,” Miles said. “I’m just sad to have injury there. You see guys fight like heck to have excellence and to play at a very high level. Injury is the one thing about this sport that you’d like to get fixed. It’s the same thing that makes it great, because you have to overcome it. But guys that are deserving, you’d like for them not ever to be injured. So I wish Nick Chubb the very best.” \nQUOTE OF THE DAY: “Well, we almost won one or two of them. We didn’t almost win this one.” \n---South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier on the first – and last – 0-4 start in the SEC of his coaching career Saturday after the LSU game.
