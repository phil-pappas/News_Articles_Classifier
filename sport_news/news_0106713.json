The runner from Punjab survived an early fall to win the full marathon in two hours 24 minutes and 22 seconds, a new course record. Rashpal overhauled the previous best of two hours, 25 minutes and 51 seconds by Tirath Kumar Pun last year.Satyabhan won the silver as he crossed the finish line in two hours 25 minutes and four seconds while GB Patel took the third place in two hours 28 minutes and nine seconds.Leading the race that had about 2000 starters, the Army athletes set the tone for the day as they broke away from the pack after the initial two kilometers to surge ahead. Rashpal toppled over a speed breaker outside the Sree Kanteerava Stadium at the start due to bad light, causing bruises on his knee and hands but that didn’t deter the 29-year-old’s charge as he maintained a steady pace.“It was an easy race for us. Except for the two of us, I didn’t have much competition,” said Rashpal who pocketed the winner’s purse of Rs 1.5 lakh.Rashpal, who switched to marathon over a year ago, was challenged by Satyabhan and the duo exchanged the lead frequently before they entered the final phase. Rashpal then stamped his authority taking the decisive lead with just over five kilometers left. The determined Army man then raced ahead to cross the finish line amidst cheer from the crowd.In the women’s section, Jyothi Gawate won the full marathon in two hours 56 minutes and 36 seconds. Jyothi Singh finished second in three hours, 14 minutes and 52 seconds, while the winner of the inaugural edition, Shyamli Singh, completed the podium in three hours, 16 minutes and 51 seconds.Gawate was the fancied runner here, having finished fourth at the Mumbai marathon in January besides winning the Surat night marathon in April and the Hyderabad marathon in August.“Last year too I was leading the race but there was that issue with the pilot vehicle and that cost me the gold. This time, I was confident of doing well and I am happy with my performance,”she concluded.Meanwhile Soji Mathew of Railways won the half-marathon, which had 7000 entries. Mathew clocked one hour, six minutes and 56 seconds, another course record. The previous best was set by Dasari Vasu at one hour, 11 minutes and 57 minutes last year.
