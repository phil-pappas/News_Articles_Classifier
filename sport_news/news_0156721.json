Travis Lulay seized control of the offence. Andrew Harris emerged as a difference-maker in the backfield. The defence, with the addition of the very interesting Khalif Mitchell, turned into a wrecking machine. \nThe Lions would win 10 of their last 11, then romp to the Grey Cup. By the end of that season, they were the best team in franchise history. \nNow, we’re not saying the 2015 Lions will duplicate 2011. We are saying, however, there are some distinct parallels between the two teams. Jonathon Jennings, of course, has been a revelation as the starting quarterback and any chance of redemption starts with him. But Jennings hasn’t been the Lions’ only positive development over the last couple of weeks. \nOn Saturday. Tommy Draheim returned to the offensive line, Harris ran for 100 yards and Jennings was sacked just once. \nOn the defensive side of the ball, the Lions’ front four finally seems settled and, as long as Mic’hael Brooks — sorry, still have to check to see where the apostrophe goes in his name — stays healthy, they are an imposing group. \nOn some level, Saturday’s performance simply represents a big win over a bad Saskatchewan team. But, before that, the Lions weren’t as bad as their 4-8 record suggested, and now they have some momentum. \nYou’ll want to stick around to see where it carries them. \n— Scary quote from Andrew Harris after Saturday’s game: “(Jennings) reminds me of a young Casey Printers.” \nOK, he’s an athletic quarterback with an attacking mentality, but that’s where the similarities between Jennings and Printers begin and end. \nJennings is grounded, mature and his teammates like him. \nPrinters? Like we said, he was an athletic quarterback. \n— Fearless predictions for the 2015-16 NHL season: \nStanley Cup: Tampa over Chicago. Realize that’s not going to break new ground for originality, but the Bolts are clearly the most talented team in the East and will have an easier route out of their conference. This time they’ll get the final act right. Until Duncan Keith shows signs of slowing down, the Blackhawks are still the most complete team in the West. \nHart Trophy: John Tavares. Jonathan Toews, sadly, will never score enough to win the NHL’s most significant individual award. Tavares will, but those Cup rings aren’t a bad consolation for Toews. \nNorris: Victor Hedman. He served notice in last season’s playoffs and he’s surrounded by a great team. It will be hard to ignore Erik Karlsson’s numbers, but Hedman will be the league’s most dominant defenceman. \nVezina: Carey Price. Price has simply separated himself from the NHL’s other goalies. He’ll be in the Hart conversation as well. \nBreakout team, Eastern Conference: Columbus. Last season they were decimated by injuries. This year all the young pieces are still in place, and they’ve added Brandon Saad. \nBreakout team, Western Conference: Winnipeg. They’ve put together a lineup that can hold its own in the backstreet-tough West. Connor McDavid will win the Calder this season, but don’t be surprised if Nik Ehlers makes the race interesting. \nBreakout player, Eastern Conference: Jonathan Drouin. It remains to be seen if he’ll play a top-six role with the Lightning but, in that lineup, the third overall pick in the 2013 could put up some big numbers. \nBreakout player, Western Conference: Bo Horvat. Really, this category was just an excuse to get Horvat’s name out front. This year, the rest of the league is going to find out what fans in Vancouver already know about Horvat. \nStory to watch: Mike Babcock in Toronto. He’s a good coach, not a miracle worker. Babcock might coax five more wins out of the Leafs this season, but they’re still going to be awful. He’ll earn his salary explaining why to the Toronto media. \n— You have to be careful with a story like this and it could be there’s a reasonable explanation for Zack Kassian’s involvement in a vehicle crash early Sunday morning in Montreal. \nBut if you were familiar with Kassian’s reputation around Vancouver, let’s just say this doesn’t register as a surprise. The crash occurred at 6 a.m. Kassian was a passenger in a truck driven by a 20-year-old woman who drove the vehicle into a tree. Police say the woman may have been drinking. An 18-year-old woman was also in the truck. \nKassian is a 24-year-old power forward who has elite skills. He’s also been traded twice in his young career. \nTeams don’t give up on a talent like that unless they have a reason, and the Canucks felt they had a reason. \n— An interesting story moved last week concerning the number of penalties called in the NFL in the first three weeks of the season. An average of 18.3 flags were thrown each game — up from 14.8 over the first three games of the 2013 season — and some anxiety was expressed over the increase and its impact on the league’s entertainment value. \nCFL apologists also had a field day with this story, saying, essentially, “See, our league isn’t that bad.” \nTwo things there. One, the NFL still has a ways to go. Last year, the CFL averaged 21.4 flags per game for the entire season. And, two, it took all of three weeks for someone to notice the problem in the NFL. CFL fans have endured this nylon nightmare as long as anyone can remember. \nJust so you know, there were 22 flags in the Lions-Roughriders tilt on Saturday. \n— And finally, don’t mean to be Debbie Downer but several key members of the Blue Jays have some questions to answer this post-season. David Price has yet to record a win in five career starts in the postseason. Josh Donaldson has just one extra-base hit in 46 career post-season at bats. \nThis will also be the first playoff appearance for Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion. Maybe it’s relevant. Maybe it isn’t. But it’s important the Jays squelch this storyline by getting off to a good start when they open the division series at home on Thursday with Price on the hill. \nThey’ve accomplished a number of great things this season, but they just seemed to celebrate making the playoffs a little too enthusiastically. It should mark the beginning of their journey, not the end of it. \newilles@theprovince.com \ntwitter.com/willesonsports «", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:57:00.200+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
