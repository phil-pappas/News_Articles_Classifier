GameDay airs on Saturday morning from 9 until noon on ESPN.\nMike Missanelli, the afternoon drive host for 97.5 The Fanatic, reported that GameDay would be coming to Philadelphia next week and broadcast its show from Independence Mall.\nWhen asked about the report, a Temple spokesperson referred all inquiries to ESPN.\nMore coverage Latest college football rankings Latest college sports videos SHOP: Collegiate Sportswear & Merchandise In response to Missanelli's report, ESPN spokeswoman Rachel Siegal told The Inquirer, \"We cannot confirm GameDay coming to Philadelphia next weekend. We will wait for the games to play out on Saturday and the decision comes late that night or Sunday.\"\nWhat is known, according to a person familiar with the situation, is that ESPN has been in Philadelphia specking potential venues for broadcast, just in case it does come to town.\nTwo places ESPN has checked out as potential locations are Independence Mall and Temple's campus. Other places, according to the source, were also checked out.\nTemple is 7-0 for the first time in school history. On Sunday, the Owls earned a spot in the Top 25, placing No. 22 in the Associated Press poll and No. 24 in the USA Today Coaches poll. It is the first time the Owls have been ranked since the end of the 1979 season.\nSince Temple has already played this week, beating East Carolina, by 24-14 on Thursday, the game with Notre Dame will ensure that both teams are in the Top 25 next week. Notre Dame (6-1) is ranked No. 11 in the Associated Press and No. 10 in the USA Today Coaches Poll and has a bye this week.\nmnarducci@phillynews.com\n@sjnard", "external_links": ["http://philly.stats.com/cfb/polls.asp", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=collegegearArticle&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2Fpages%2FCOLLEGE"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:22:59.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
