Ira Winderman Contact Reporter South Florida Sun Sentinel Lamar Odom in the thoughts of the Heat \nTo appreciate the impact Lamar Odom had on the Miami Heat in his single season with the team was to appreciate both the anguish and appreciation offered Thursday from those closest to him in the organization. \nWith Odom fighting for his life at a Las Vegas hospital, guard Dwyane Wade and coach Erik Spoelstra welled up while discussing Odom's impact on their lives. \n\"Lamar's a beautiful person,\" Spoelstra said. \"It seems strange, it feels like he played for us for an entire career and it was only for a year. \n\"He's one of the most giving and sharing human beings that I've ever been around in my life. Any time any of us had ever been around him -- I'm sure so many people have the same type of stories -- you always feel better when you leave a conversation or an interaction with Lamar.\" \nOdom spent the 2003-04 season with the Heat, after being signed away from the Los Angeles Clippers as a free agent. He then was dealt the following offseason to the Los Angeles Lakers as part of a trade package for Shaquille O'Neal. His arrival to South Florida was part of the franchise's rebirth, with the Heat going from 25 victories the season before his addition to the second round of playoffs in 2004, with a team that featured Odom, Wade, Udonis Haslem, Caron Butler, Eddie Jones and Brian Grant.

When he was young, you heard about him in college, etcetera. And then he's cool. \n\"And then he has an effect on you by his knowledge. And everyone knows that L.O. has so much knowledge about life and the game. And he put that on us, as young guys, and it stuck. And it stuck. And it will always be a part of me.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T21:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:06:47.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
