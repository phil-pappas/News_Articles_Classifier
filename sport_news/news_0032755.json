Juliet Spies-Gans Editorial Fellow, HuffPost Sports Posted: 10/12/2015 10:32 AM EDT Rob Carr via Getty Images Cleveland Browns tight end Gary Barnidge nabs the touchdown in Sunday's game against the Baltimore Ravens. \nNFL pundits may not have pegged the Cleveland Browns-Baltimore Ravens matchup as the game to watch over the weekend, but Browns tight end Gary Barnidge's instantly classic “butt catch” shot the contest to the top of the highlight reel. \nThat's impressive, considering Sunday was filled with an unusually high number of ridiculous plays on the football field. Let us count the amazing plays. \n\n1. Gary Barnidge pulls off the \"butt catch\" \nCalling up memories of the 2012 Mark Sanchez “butt fumble,” Barnidge used just about every limb of his body to corral a soaring pass from quarterback Josh McCown for the touchdown. \nRight hand, left ankle, right thigh, squeezed between his legs and into his hands, this catch had -- and touched -- it all, leading the Twitterverse to debate whether it outranks even New York Giant Odell Beckham Jr.’s one-handed miracle grab from last season as the greatest catch in recent memory. Sorry, Odell Beckham Jr...Gary Barnidge might get catch of the year this season! — Erin Coscarelli (@erincoscarelli) October 11, 2015 \n\n2. Larry Donnell grabs the lob, grabs the win \nAbout 190 miles to the northeast of Barnidge’s butt catch, a game-winning toss from Giants quarterback Eli Manning to tight end Larry Donnell sent already emotional New York fans into a frenzy. Larry Donnell holds on for a fantastic TD pass. pic.twitter.com/mg16PTLUR4 — HuffPost Sports (@HuffPostSports) October 12, 2015 \nManning stepped back, looked up and lobbed a pass over the heads of two San Francisco 49er defenders deep into the end zone, into the outstretched arms of a leaping Donnell. \n\n3. Dion Lewis leaves no Cowboy ankle unbroken ... \nElsewhere in the red zone, New England Patriots running back Dion Lewis put on a clinic on stutter steps, jabbing and juking, as he tricked out a handful of Dallas Cowboy defenders before barreling headfirst in for the touchdown. And the blowout is on courtesy of Dion Lewis with the play of the day. Can't tackle what you can't touch. pic.twitter.com/v4QJooLkxE — David Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) October 11, 2015 \n\n4. ... Neither does Julian Edelman \nMaybe Lewis learned some of those moves from teammate wide receiver Julian Edelman, who had yet another Cowboy defender falling head over heels with his fancy footwork around the 50-yard line. \n\n5. James Jones keeps running and the Packers keep rolling \nAnd it wouldn’t be an NFL Sunday without a highlight from Wisconsin favorite Aaron Rodgers, as the Green Bay signal caller found wide receiver James Jones, who skipped his way down the field for the 65-yard score. Rodgers pass to James Jones goes 65 yards for the #Packers #touchdown ! #STLvsGB pic.twitter.com/el3YheKlZJ — Def Pen Sports (@DefPenSports) October 11, 2015 \nHave a day, receivers and running backs, have a day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:01:20.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
