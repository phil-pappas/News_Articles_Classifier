After holding Trinity on downs, Loganville’s special teams capitalized again on a booming punt from the junior that was mishandled for a fumbled return. \nThe turnover became the first of 14 points by Loganville off Trinity miscues, adding a short interception return for a score with 6:25 to play to cap off 24 unanswered points and 17 in the second half. \n“Turning points go in both directions,” said Trinity head coach Dan Matthews, whose team fell to 6-3 overall and 4-1 following its first region loss. “Loganville is a really good team. They’re well-coached and their kids played hard. You can’t take anything away from what they did.” \nThe victory clinched this year’s 1-AAA championship for Loganville while keeping the team undefeated at 8-0 overall and 5-0 in region play. The loss left Trinity know- ing it needs a win next week at rival Heritage School in what will be a battle for second place and home field advantage in the first round of the GISA state playoffs – on top of annual bragging rights. \nA tale of two halves for Trinity included the Lions bottling up Loganville’s top offensive stars – quarterback Donovan Taitt and run- ning back John Heart, neither of whom had a chance to dominate as they have against the majority of 1-AAA opponents this year. \nTrinity stopped Loganville on back-to-back drives to open the game, the first on downs when Heart failed to convert a fourth down. Trinity then used a new wrinkle in the offense – a halfback option from left-handed Austin Haney to Sam Cotton for a 44-yard catch and run that caught the defense off guard to set up 1st-and-Goal from the Loganville 2-yard line. \nOne play and a penalty later, fullback Preston McDuffie barrelled in from the 6-yard- line for a score that gave Trinity a 7-0 lead after one quarter. \nHeart, who left the game to an injury late in third quarter, was held to his lowest rushing total of the season, managing just 44 yards on nine carries. \nHaitt, meanwhile, managed a scoring throw to teammate Collin Hall in the corner of the end zone early in the second quarter that tied the score at 7-7. \nBut most of the Loganville senior quarterback’s completions came toward the sidelines for short yardage while finishing 10-for-26 passing for 95 yards. \nPenalties hampered both teams, including a dozen combined in the second quarter. \nTrinity’s offense couldn’t find its rhythm despite driving to the opposing 38-yard line before turning the ball over on downs. The hosts managed just four first downs split on opposite sides of halftime. \nBut the defense continued to stand its ground, however, before Allen – whose go-ahead 48-yard field-goal in the third quarter had distance to spare – boomed a high arcing punt that was bobbled and recovered by Loganville at the Trinity 20-yard line as a 10-7 game reached the fourth quarter. \nThree plays later, Heart’s injury replacement, junior Trevor Callaway, found the end zone for a 17-7 Loganville lead. \nDown to the final 9-plus minutes of play, Trinity went to its passing game but came up empty on a pair of interceptions. Despite holding Loganville on the first, another Allen punt rolled dead at the home 5-yard line. \nTrinity’s next pass attempt on first down was also intercepted and returned to close out the scoring with 6:25 to play.
