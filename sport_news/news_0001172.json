The Buckeyes’ star leads the Big Ten and is fifth in the NCAA with 141.1 yards rushing per game. He’s had 12 consecutive 100-yard games. Elliott’s father, Stacy, played high school football at Hackensack.\nRutgers offense vs. Ohio State defense: If Leonte Carroo (ankle), who Ohio State coach Urban Meyer says will be playing in the NFL next year, isn’t at full speed, the Scarlet Knights are at a disadvantage against a Buckeyes defense that looks to be approaching full stride after some early-season problems. Quarterback Chris Laviano has played well the past two games, but the key to RU staying in the game will be its ability or inability to run the ball, keeping Ohio State’s high-powered offense off the field. The Scarlet Knights better know where Joey Bosa is at all times. Projected as a possible No. 1 overall pick in the NFL Draft, Bosa has 23 1/2 sacks in 35 career games.\nOhio State offense vs. Rutgers defense: Newly reinstalled as the Buckeyes’ starting quarterback, J.T. Barrett is an athletic runner who’ll put pressure on the Scarlet Knights’ defense. Barrett threw for 261 yards and three touchdowns and ran for 107 yards and two scores in last season’s domination of Rutgers. Michael Thomas is Ohio State’s leading receiver with 30 catches for 433 yards and a Big Ten-best five touchdowns and converted quarterback Braxton Miller has three TD grabs. Linebacker Steve Longa of Saddle Brook had 16 tackles against Indiana, but needs help from his Rutgers teammates. In the past two games (Michigan State, Indiana), RU has allowed 1,116 yards, 831 through the air.\nDid you know? Ohio State has been ranked No. 1 in The Associated Press poll 103 times, the most of any school.\nPrediction: Ohio State 41, Rutgers 17\n— John Rowe", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:02:34.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
