In the first meeting, the Lady War Eagles had to rally from a 2-0 deficit to win, but they were the team in control through two sets Tuesday, before Springdale won game three and nearly forced a game five. \n\"My girls were pretty upset about (game three) and said, coach it's not going to go five,\" Heritage coach Sarah Miser said. \"They made the decision to finish this game.\" \nSpringdale (7-14-1, 0-9) was a point away from forcing a winner-take-all fifth game, but Heritage scored three straight points, including back-to-back blocks by Hope Von Gremp and then Von Gremp and Lindsay Glenn to clinch the match. \n\"That's something we've been working on, because blocking has not been our strength,\" Miser said. \"We're the shortest team in the conference. We're small, so we've been working on at least getting our hands up over the net.\" \nSenior outside hitter Elleson Dunagin led the way for Heritage, recording 29 kills and 20 digs. Senior setter Lindsay Glynn had 38 assists and 21 digs, while Alye Darter had 24 digs and CJ Landrum added seven kills. \nSpringdale battled in splitting the third and fourth games, but couldn't overcome the sluggish start the first two sets. \n\"I think we had a slow start in game one and two, but we're still pushing for that conference win, we really are,\" Springdale coach Kylie Moad said. \"We have intense practices. They are hungry for it.\" \nSpringdale senior outside hitter Desiree Mack finished with 26 kills and senior setter Maddie Mueller had 39 assists. Sophomore libero Elaina Pack had 26 digs, while sophomore Kaleigh Breathitt added 13 and went on an 11-point service run in the game-two win. \nHeritage can all but clinch a state tournament berth with a win Tuesday against Fort Smith Northside. Springdale will host Fort Smith Southside. \nSports on 10/02/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:38:02.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
