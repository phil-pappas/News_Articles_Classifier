Still, Collins managed to keep the Mets level-headed over the course of their roller coaster season and is now guiding them through a lengthy postseason run. He's also in the discussion for NL Manager of the Year . \nAs Heyman notes, Collins is \"looking forward\" to leading the Mets next season, where they'll once again be stacked with dynamic young pitching, which could make them a force for years to come. \nCollins made $1.1 million as manager of the Mets this season. \nMaria Guardado may be reached at mguardado@njadvancemedia.com .
