Recent offerings by the HSV Players did include music, but it was of the recorded music score or computer-generated type. To make “Young Frankenstein: The Musical” into a special event, the show managers decided to go with live music in an orchestra pit. \nThis idea is not without its risks. Although the Players have performed many amazing musicals in the past, this one has a very complex instrumental and vocal score, using intricate modulations and rhythms. The use of a pit is also risky. The equipment at the Woodlands Auditorium is now 26 years old and, in order to fit the orchestra in place, it will be necessary to remove the first row of seats in the theater. The POA staff is primed and ready to make the orchestra pit a reality. \nMusic director Dr. Sarah Dailey is preparing her 10-piece group for the first meeting with the cast of the show on Oct.26. The orchestra members are Kathy Ogilvie on violin, Sotonya Gordey as reed 1, Rafael Powell as reed 2, Dale Grimm as reed 3, Chris Holt on trumpet, Jacob Dowdy on horn, Alan Burns on trombone, Matthew Mentgen on piano, Norm Morton on bass keyboard and Lee Beach on drums and percussion. Other special plans are in the works. The Players will hold a “ritzy” costume contest in the lobby before the show. Those attending the performance are invited to dress up as their favorite monster or superhero (or whatever) and come prepared to get their photo snapped. The costumes will be “judged” by a special guest, and a nice prize will be awarded to the winner. \nWe invite you to get your tickets while seats are still available at HSVTicketSales.com, or you can call the Woodlands office at 922-4231.
