But on Saturday at Wyoming, the Wolf Pack took a few steps backs. \nFacing one of the five winless teams in the FBS, the Wolf Pack became Wyoming’s first victim in 2015. \nNevada didn’t tackle well, got pushed around in the trenches, couldn’t run the ball with consistency, missed open receivers for could-be touchdowns and still had a chance to win the game in the end. \nBut that chance, much like in its loss to rival UNLV two weeks ago, went unfulfilled when Wolf Pack quarterback Tyler Stewart was sacked on a Wyoming blitz on fourth-and-5 with 96 seconds remaining. That was Nevada’s final offensive play in a 28-21 loss in front of 17,026 fans at War Memorial Stadium. \n“The inconsistency of our football team, mentally and physically, how we’re so up and down, is maddening right now,” said coach Brian Polian, adding that Wyoming was tougher and played a more physical game than his team. “I have to do everything I can to figure out how to get this thing fixed.” Polian: Pack loses battle of toughness vs. Wyoming \nNevada (3-4, 1-2) fell into a deep hole thanks to a bad close to the first half and poor start to the second. \nWyoming (1-6, 1-2) went ahead 14-7 on a 27-yard touchdown pass from Cameron Coffman to Tanner Gentry with 1:30 left in the half. After a quick three-and-out by Nevada, the Cowboys struck again – a 12-yard pass to Jake Maulhardt – with 27 seconds in the half. Wyoming got the ball to open the second half and after a 47-yard pass to Gentry went up 28-7 when Kellen Overstreet bullied into the end zone. Nevada lost to previously winless Wyoming, 28-21, on Saturday in Laramie. Chris Murray/RGJ \nPolian said “the sequence of plays right before the end of the half was awful” and he was “incredibly upset by the way we came out in the second half.” He also wasn’t pleased with his team’s fundamental play, with both sides of the ball making correctable mistakes, or the team’s reaction to falling behind. \n“This was not a failure of Xs and Os,” he said. “This was a failure of fundamental football. I’m not saying that to blame the players. The coaches are responsible for making sure we play fundamental football. This was not a failure of Xs and Os. This was a failure of getting off blocks and doing the little things. \n“I did not like our body language at points in the game. The coaches were up and down the sideline (trying to get the players fired up). Ultimately, players have to play. They have to decide. If we have to beg them to compete then we have to identify the guys who are going to fight and fight and fight.” \nThe Wolf Pack was beat up in the trenches, allowing 272 rushing yards while gaining just 118 on the ground. Coffman went 18-of-20 for 213 yards and three touchdowns and was barely touched by Nevada’s pass rush, which didn’t record a sack, for the second straight game, or tackle for loss. \nNevada pulled back into the game as Wyoming went conservative on offense – 20 of Wyoming’s final 23 plays were runs – and Stewart made some big plays in the pass game. The junior quarterback finished 25-of-41 for a career-high 287 yards with two touchdowns. But he had some misses, too, misfiring on a wheel route to James Butler that was wide open and a deep pass to an unguarded Jerico Richardson. \n“I can’t miss those throws, that’s the bottom line,” said Stewart, who also had a couple of passes dropped. “They’re both wide open and both would have been touchdowns. I can’t do that to us.” Wolf Pack notes: Two receivers go over 100 catches \nStewart and the Wolf Pack took control of the ball down 28-21 with 3:19 remaining on its own 14. But much like in the loss to UNLV, the Wolf Pack moved into the opponents’ territory before stalling. \nOn fourth-and-5 from the Wyoming 36, Wyoming blitzed from Stewart’s right when the pass protection was to the left and a trio of Cowboys players converged on Stewart, first causing a fumble, which Stewart recovered, before being taken him down for an 18-yard sack to seal the Wolf Pack’s defeat. \nNevada was coming off its best game of the season, a 35-17 win over New Mexico but was unable to build any momentum against a Wyoming team that had lost nine straight dating to last season. Nevada hasn’t won back-to-back game since winning three in a row last October. And with only five games remaining, the Wolf Pack seniors, like defensive end Lenny Jones, knows there’s not much time left. \n“We’re in the second half of the season,” Jones said. “We should already be in our groove. We have to find our groove and find it fast and be consistent the last five games. If we want to go out how we say we want to go out and achieve the goals we said we want to achieve, we have to get our stuff together.” \nWith the MW’s West Division struggling this year – four of the six teams in the division are 1-2 or worse in league play – the Wolf Pack’s aspirations of winning the division title aren’t dashed just yet. But if Nevada wants to make a move, it has to do so in short order and find some long-missing consistency. \n“It sucks,” senior running back Don Jacksons said. “It doesn’t feel good that we can’t get anything rolling. But I have faith. I always have faith. We just go back to work tomorrow and figure things out and start going. We don’t have a lot of time. I think pressure makes diamonds. We’ll see how we react.” Wolf Pack grades: Lots of Cs lead to an L \nOn Saturday, the story was the same as it’s been often in recent years: too little, too late. Nevada fell to 3-9 in Polian’s three seasons in games decided by a touchdown or less. Given the Wolf Pack was playing a winless opponent, this one has to sting more than most, especially after the comeback bid fell just short. \n“I’m proud that we fought back and had a chance to win it there at the end, but there are no medals for trying,” Polian said. “We have to find a way to get it done and right now we’re not getting it done.” \nWYOMING 28, NEVADA 21 \nKey stat: 154 – Wyoming outgained Nevada by 154 yards on the ground. The Cowboys rushed for 272 yards and the Wolf Pack had just 118 rushing yards, more than 100 shy of its season average. \nKey play: Wyoming QB Cameron Coffman hit Jake Maulhardt on a 12-yard touchdown pass with 27 seconds remaining in half – the second Wyoming score in 63 seconds – to give the Cowboys a 21-7 lead. \nKey to the game: Nevada struggled defensively, allowing nearly 500 yards of offense, and didn’t do much on offense in the first half to dig too deep a hole (28-7 in the early third quarter) to recover from. 11 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN 12 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.rgj.com/1RP1g2I TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:36:13.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
