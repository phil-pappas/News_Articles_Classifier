But that's exactly what happened to an Emery couple. \nPhil and Amanda Johnson were making the 30-minute drive to the Parkston hospital early Tuesday morning, when Eli decided he couldn't wait any longer. \nPhil stopped at a stop sign in Ethan, just in time to reach over and grab little Eli's head, and Amanda caught the baby's body. \nWhen he didn't make any noise, they realized the cord was wrapped around Eli's neck. Amanda untangled it and he started to cry. Fortunately, Amanda is a nurse in Parkston, so she called the hospital in advance to make sure everything was ready when they arrived. \nDespite the dramatic delivery, Phil said the newborn is perfect. Eli is 7 pounds, one ounce and looks just like his brother, Emett. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
