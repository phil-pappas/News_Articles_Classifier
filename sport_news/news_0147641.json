Officials at the Japanese Embassy in Dhaka could not immediately be reached for comment.\nSaturday's killing took place five days after an Italian aid worker was killed by motorbike-riding assailants in Dhaka, Bangladesh's capital.\nThe Islamic State group claimed responsibility for that attack. The government, however, dismissed the claim, saying there was no evidence. It described the killing as an \"isolated incident.\"\nThe Italian aid worker, Cesare Tavella, had been working in Dhaka for a Netherlands-based church cooperative, serving as program manager for a project focusing on food security and economic development for people living in rural areas in Bangladesh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:04:48.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
