Here's some reaction from around the nation.\nRobby Kalland, CBS Sports: The Aggies now join LSU at the top of the SEC West standings as the only two teams still undefeated in the conference. It's good that Texas A&M is in good form and good spirits because the next two weeks after the bye will be their biggest test of the season with Alabama coming to College Station on October 17 followed by a trip to Ole Miss the week after.\nWill Heath, Saturday Down South: For as many times as it appeared A&M was ready to run State out of Kyle Field Saturday night, the Bulldogs kept the game closer than it had any right to be. State's offense actually outperformed the Aggies' in the second half. They were ultimately undone by two untimely turnovers in the third quarter.\nKyle Ringo, Yahoo! Sports: A week after his defense allowed more than 200 rushing yards to Arkansas, defensive coordinator John Chavis had his unit pressuring Prescott throughout the first half and well into the second until Prescott chose to become more of a running threat. Mississippi State didn't help itself with a pair of fumbles when the offense was moving the chains.\nSam Khan Jr., ESPN: Last season, the wheels came off [after reaching 5-0] when Texas A&M endured three consecutive losses. Will this year be different? It's starting to look like it, thanks in large part to an improved defense and the maturity of Allen, who made just his 10th start on Saturday.\nBrent Zwerneman, Houston Chronicle: The real fun for the Aggies starts now, however, after A&M hiked past No. 21 Mississippi State 30-17 on Saturday night before 104,455 fans in Kyle Field.\nJosh Criswell, FanSided: Allen proved why he is considered among the top signal-callers in the SEC, passing for 322 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. Wide receivers Josh Reynolds and Christian Kirk continued to impress as well, combining for 218 yards from scrimmage on the night.\nRobert Cessna, The Eagle: Texas A&M's offense struck early in the first half, and the Aggie defense made sure Mississippi State didn't do the same in the second half.\nMyles Garrett has: 2 sacks vs. ASU 3.5 vs. Nevada Game saving forced fumble vs. Hogs Game turning forced fumble vs. MSU What a player...\n— Carter Karels (@CarterKarels) October 4, 2015\nCelebrate if you're 5-0 #GoAggies pic.twitter.com/RIOywewaGJ\n— Texas A&M Football (@AggiesFootbaIl) October 4, 2015\nMyles Garrett: Option Killer. pic.twitter.com/a7ygwZmfye\n— TexAgs (@TexAgs) October 4, 2015 On Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/CarterKarels/status/650546945555984384", "http://t.co/RIOywewaGJ", "http://t.co/a7ygwZmfye", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland", "http://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/sec-football/rapid-reaction-tamu-dispenses-of-mississippi-state/", "http://www.chron.com/sports/college/article/Texas-A-M-heads-into-bye-week-undefeated-after-6548874.php", "https://twitter.com/AggiesFootbaIl/status/650519692793249792", "http://www.myaggienation.com/aggie_sports/football/no-aggies-beat-no-bulldogs-to-reach/article_5d0baf87-52c6-5c31-8ac9-aa34d9ee03c3.html", "http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/eye-on-college-football/25326815/no-14-texas-am-cruises-beats-no-21-mississippi-state-30-17", "http://espn.go.com/blog/sec/post/_/id/107783/balanced-texas-am-wins-top-25-showdown-with-mississippi-state-30-17", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/GoAggies?src=hash", "http://fansided.com/2015/10/03/mississippi-state-texas-am-final-score-recap-results-highlights/", "https://twitter.com/TexAgs/status/650489541355134976"], "published": "2015-10-04T19:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T14:26:34.694+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
