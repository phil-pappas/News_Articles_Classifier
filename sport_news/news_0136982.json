And the 6-foot-8, 325-pound left tackle would happy if his football career continues in his home state with the Giants after this season.\nLumpkin elected not to leave for the NFL after his junior season. The anchor of Rutgers' offensive line, Lumpkin has started 29 straight games at left tackle\nI caught up with Lumpkin this week to discuss his support for the home team, why Jersey recruits are attracted to the University of South Carolina and his goal to be a fireman.\nQ: What was your favorite team growing up?\nA: The New York Giants. I grew into it. My dad was a Giants fan. My whole household is Giants fans. It's just something I grew into.\nQ: That's interesting because it seems like most of the Jersey guys don't root for the home teams.\nA: I've always been a diehard Giants fan and a hometown guy. It's always been one of my dreams to get a chance to play for them one day.\nQ: What do you think when you see some of your teammates from Jersey rooting for the Cowboys and other teams?\nA: I really don't agree with it. I'm like, \"Why root for another team when you've got a team in your own backyard to root for?\" I can understand South Jersey guys rooting for Philly because it's closer to them. But I never thought it made sense for people to root for San Fran and they're from New Jersey.\nQ: Who was your favorite player growing up?\nA: Definitely Lawrence Taylor. Like I said, I was a Giants guy. My dad's favorite player was Lawrence Taylor. He always made me watch \"NFL Crunch Course\" and Lawrence Taylor was always on it. A lot of his highlights were on there. I always used to just watch it. Even when I was younger, I wore No. 56. It was just somebody to look up to. I really didn't know anything about football when I was younger. My dad put that on and tried to introduce me to football and the best players. (Taylor) was one of them at the time so he became my favorite player.\nQ: Why do you wear No. 74?\nA: Honestly, they just gave it to me. I was No. 72 all my life, except for my early years of playing. But I wore no. 72 and Kaleb Johnson came here in May and I came in June, so he got here first. He wore No. 72 as well, so he got the 72. I talked to my parents about it and I said I'll try something new. It's a new dream for me so I'm going to get a different number.\nQ: Did you ever try to wrangle No. 72 from Kaleb?\nA: When we first got here, I tried to tell him to switch, like, \"I had that jersey for almost 10 years.\" But honestly, after a long talk with my parents, they were just figuring I should try something new.\nQ: What's your favorite Rutgers uniform?\nA: I like the black ones. The blackout game — I like the jersey, I like the environment it brings, everybody is there rowdy in black, the stadium is all blacked out. I think it's a cool look for us.\nQ: What did you think of the throwback uniforms you wore against Kansas ?\nA: I liked them. I wasn't too fond of it though because those jerseys are extra tight. I thought it was nice to actually wear them and it was homecoming, getting back to our roots and everything, but I like the new ones better.\nRELATED: Keith Lumpkin says he's returning for his senior season\nQ: What was your second college choice and why did you choose Rutgers?\nA: South Carolina was my first choice and then it was Rutgers because I went (to South Carolina) first. I fell in love with it. The city of Columbia was great. In recruiting you here about the family atmosphere and you hear about everybody sticking together, and when I came here I really felt that, especially with those older guys. They really made me feel welcome here. Ever since then, I've loved it. Now I'm the older guy and I'm trying to do the same thing that those guys gave to me when I was a freshman or being recruited.\nQ: It seems like South Carolina is a popular school for Jersey recruits. Why is that?\nA: A lot of guys go there out of Jersey. It's just different than New Jersey. It's the southern atmosphere and you're in the city. It's a lot different from being up here. And it's warm — it's hot or it's always warm so you don't really have to worry about the cold. It's an SEC school so everybody considers them as one of the power conferences. People feel like it's a winning situation for them. Honestly, there's nothing wrong with staying home.\nQ: When did you start playing football?\nA: When I was 8. It's been about 15 years now since I started playing. I honestly didn't want to play football and my dad was just like, \"Keep sticking around.\" He saw that I was good, but I couldn't see it. I was like, \"I don't want to play this.\" They had me at nose guard and I didn't want to play. I was playing up, too. I was playing with 10-11 year olds and I was only 8 years old. My dad just told me to keep sticking with it. My first year I wasn't on his team, but then for four or five years I was on him and my grandfather's team so it became fun. Obviously they were tough on me. My dad was tougher on me than my grandfather was, but after that I started to enjoy it a little bit. And I also enjoyed basketball. Those were my two sports that I could play so that's what I did.\nQ: What made you start liking football?\nA: Once I actually understood it. Your first couple of years out there, you're just like, \"Get the ball.\" So that's what I did. I didn't like blocking. I just wanted to play defense. Once I actually understood what was going on, then it became enjoyable going against my friends. At first I didn't have any friends because all the guys were older than me. Then I made friends with them and even playing in the neighborhood everybody lived in the town so we all played together afterward so I made friends like that. They didn't know that I was three years younger than them. Once they found that out, it was just like, \"We've got to keep him around and keep him playing.\" It was just a great time growing up for me playing with those guys. That's when I started to love the game.\nOUT OF BOUNDS\nQ: What's your major?\nA: Labor studies.\nQ: Are you in grad school?\nA: No, I chose not to do grad school. I'm taking two classes so I can be eligible to play.\nQ: But you graduated in May ?\nA: Yeah, but I postponed two classes so I can play. I could have graduated, but I delayed two classes because you need two to play in a bowl game.\nQ: Why'd you choose to go that route instead of starting grad school?\nA: Honestly, I just wanted to focus on this season. I wanted to be the best leader and the best player I could be. School is a full-time commitment as well, obviously. I just wanted to commit this year to me going out the best way I could. So that was my main focus for this year.\nQ: What are your post-grad plans?\nA: Hopefully to play in the NFL one day. If not, try to connect and find a way for me to get into the NFLPA somehow. If not, my all-time goal when I was a kid was to be a fireman. I have the fire manual and I read it every day. I'm probably going to apply for the test. So I've got a few backup options.\nI'll do a Q&A with a player each Friday. Who do you want to hear from next week? Let me know in the comments section, and feel free to pass along any questions you have for players.\nYou can find previous Q&A's with Anthony Cioffi , Andre Patton and Carlton Agudosi .\nDan Duggan may be reached at dduggan@njadvancemedia.com .
