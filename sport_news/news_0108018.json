Snyder, meanwhile, knocked out Hempfield freshman Amanda Hagino 6-4, 7-5 to make the semis. \nAlso in Class AAA, Manheim Township’s Kate Moore made it to the quarterfinals on a 6-3, 6-3 win over McCaskey’s Sophie Rathmell, but ultimately fell to No. 3 seed Yvonne Peters-Washington of Central York, 6-3, 4-6, 6-1. Peters-Washington knocked out Township’s Julia Darkey 6-4, 6-4 in Saturday’s opening round. \nIn Class AA play, Riehl’s Saturday included a 6-2, 6-0 win over Lancaster Country Day’s Amy Shields in the first round, and a 6-2, 6-0 quarterfinal ousting of Shields’ Cougars teammate — and No. 3 seed — Grace Zechman. \nZechman had made the quarters on a 6-1, 6-4 win over Rachel Martin of James Buchanan. \nMeanwhile, Andersson opened on a 6-3, 6-1 win over Melanie Haas of Hamburg before dropping Elco’s Sydney Nye 6-1, 6-1 in the quarters.
