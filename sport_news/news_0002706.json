Just being able to grow up on my own and make my own decisions and pay for my own mistakes is a big reason (for decommitting).”\nFormer Cougar commit Wayne Kirby\nWith all the national attention being paid to the fourth-ranked University of Utah football team, head coach Kyle Whittingham and company certainly have seen worse times on the recruiting front.\nSo naturally, they’d go out and offer a scholarship to a prospect with major ties to BYU .\nThat’s what happened last weekend. Former Cougar commit Wayne Kirby, a three-star defensive lineman from Highland High School (Pocatello, Idaho) got an offer after attending the Utes ’ game against Cal.\nIt’s been a wild time for Kirby, who decommitted from BYU last week in part because Utah has been showing increased interest. Still, that the No. 4 team in the nation is in pursuit of him is not the primary reason the 6-foot-3, 300-pound lineman decided to open his recruitment back up.\nHis main concern about joining the Cougars? The honor code at the Provo school.\n“My beliefs are that if I do something in my personal life that’s my business, and my team isn’t going to punish me for it unless it’s against team rules,” he said. “Just being able to grow up on my own and make my own decisions and pay for my own mistakes is a big reason (for decommitting).”\nKirby’s path to committing to BYU in the first place is one he said he learned from. His father James passed away May 28 after a prolonged illness, and he committed to the Cougars less than a month later, telling the Idaho State Journal it’s where he felt his father would have wanted him to go.\nIn the months since, however, Kirby said he’s been able to take a closer look at the schools and feels as if Utah would be a better fit for him, although he’s clear that he’s neither committed to the Utes nor completely ruled out BYU.\n“I was kind of basing my decision more on my emotions than what I thought was best for me,” he said of his original commitment. “BYU’s not a bad place at all. I’m not trying to down on them. I just feel like Utah as a program and as a school is a little better of a fit for me as a football player and also as a student.\n\"I’ve stayed in contact with (BYU coaches) throughout the whole thing, and that’s one of the things that makes it the hardest is that I’ve built relationships with these people, and I have a bond with them. They actually mean something to me. It’s kind of hard to do that to them, but I’ve got to keep myself and my future in mind.”\nKirby said he’s interested in studying medicine.\nBecause of his sense of loyalty, Kirby said that not only was it hard telling Cougar coaches he had decommitted, but it was also “kind of weird” to get offered by the Utes just a few days later.\n“I wouldn’t really say they hate each other, but I know how much they compete against each other,” he said. “It’s a little hard because of my relationships with (BYU) coaches. Kind of going to their big rival makes me hurt a little because I don’t want to lose my friendship with those coaches over this.”\nStill, he does think the idea that the fourth-ranked team in the country would consider him a priority is special, calling the offer from Utah “big.”\n“I’m not one to look at myself and say, ‘Oh, you’re great,’” he said. “I don’t really have a whole lot of confidence, and so it kind of gave me a little confidence thinking about that. It’s kind of nice I guess.”\nMoving forward, Kirby isn’t in a huge rush to make a decision on his future. Although he considers the Utes frontrunners at this point, he’s keeping his options open. He’s been talking to Oregon and has an offer from Washington State.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html", "http://www.idahostatejournal.com/sports/local/highland-senior-wayne-kirby-verbally-commits-to-play-for-byu/article_25e62b64-1ce3-11e5-930a-a747956f4191.html"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:16:45.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
