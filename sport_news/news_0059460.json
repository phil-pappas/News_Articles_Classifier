The senior has 397 yards and three touchdowns on 71 carries for the Illini (4-1, 1-0 Big Ten). \nFreshman Ke'Shawn Vaughn took over for Ferguson on Saturday and was the only other Illini back to carry the ball. Vaughn had 98 yards on 24 carries. \nCubit has said Illinois will need junior Henry Enyenihi to help pick up the rushing load at Iowa (5-0, 1-0). \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:19:05.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
