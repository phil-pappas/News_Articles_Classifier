Boehner said he made the decision to retire from Congress after a meeting with the pope. (Source: AP/Susan Walsh) \n(RNN) - Kevin McCarthy unexpectedly dropped out of the race to replace Speaker of the House John Boehner, who unexpectedly announced he'd step down last month. \nMcCarthy was the right-hand man for Boehner as the House majority leader, and he had experienced a rapid rise in Republican leadership during his brief four terms in Congress. \nHe spent his career building relationships with other members of the House, but suffered major damage from a botched quote on Fox News that suggested the House Benghazi Committee's investigation was politically motivated, The statement, which he unsuccessfully walked back, caused a furor in and out of the party, and gave Democratic presidential challenger Hillary Clinton a political advantage. \nThe news he had withdrawn came as a complete surprise and emphasized the divide between the Republican establishment and the small but powerful band of radical conservatives. \nMcCarthy was elected to Congress in 2006 from the staunchly conservative 23rd District in California, replacing his powerful mentor Bill Thomas, the former chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. \nIn 2002, McCarthy won a seat in the California State Assembly, where he became the Republican leader in his first term. His tenure was otherwise unremarkable, but when he won election to the House, he entered an environment where his experience paid off. \nMcCarthy became the House Republican chief deputy whip early in his second term and served from 2009-2011. His party colleagues elected him majority whip on a secret ballot after the mid-term GOP landslide of 2010, in which he played a key part. After majority leader Eric Cantor’s shocking defeat in 2014 to a tea party candidate, McCarthy was promoted to Cantor's old job by another secret ballot of his colleagues. \nMcCarthy grew up in Bakersfield, CA , about 100 miles north of Los Angeles. When he was a teenager, he won $5,000 in a lottery and used the money to start a deli. His father, a firefighter, helped him build the counter. He later sold the restaurant to pay for college. He has said his early experience as a small business owner shaped his Republican philosophy. \nHe was among the most conservative members of Congress before he joined the leadership. Since then, his voting record moved toward the center, closer to the party line. \nHe is strongly against abortion rights and voted to cut a half-million dollars from Planned Parenthood, joining the tea party caucus and others after an anti-abortion group posted an online video suggesting the organization negotiated the sale of fetal tissue. \nHe signed a pledge not to vote for tax increases to battle climate change and opposes EPA regulation and affirmative action. He is in favor of unrestricted gun ownership, vouchers for school choice, and privatizing Social Security. \nOne position that did not sit well the hard-liners is his support for a pathway to legal status for immigrants that would “allow [them] to work and pay taxes.\" His district is 35 percent Latino. He never expressed support of a path to citizenship for undocumented workers. \nAs he shifted his positions to a more middle-of-the road bent, he lost favor with tea party and ultra-conservative representatives - the same group that helped force Boehner out. \nHe is often described as congenial, a people person and a nice guy. He sleeps on a sofa in his office and showers in the House gym because he doesn’t want to forget that Washington, DC, is not his home. Not coincidentally, it helped establish his persona as a regular guy, and a pal to younger Congressmen who stay in their offices because they are workaholics and in some cases, can't afford to pay big-city rent. \nMcCarthy helped Netflix develop its hit series House of Cards by allowing star Kevin Spacey to shadow him – though he says he’s not as ruthless, manipulative and murderous as Spacey’s character. \nHe was known as a cagey politician driven to power. A story in National Review once described him as a \"Republican Machiavelli.\" Apparently, those gifts failed him in his bid to become third in line for the presidency. \nHe was a principal engineer of the Republican landslide in 2010, recruiting candidates and helping them get elected by assisting with fundraising and stumping in their districts. Once the freshmen, whom he dubbed \"The Young Lions\" were sworn in, like his old boss Thomas, he served as a mentor, helped them navigate the political labyrinth, and introduced them to the right people. Many of those tea party members he helped get elected were among those who helped force Boehner out because they felt he compromised with Democrats and the White House. \nAs majority leader, McCarthy was a loyal lieutenant to Boehner, who in his resignation speech said that McCarthy would make a good speaker. \nMcCarthy is handsome and looks good on TV. He has a folksy manner of simplifying and explaining issues, reminiscent of Ronald Reagan. But he also gets tongue-tied and confused, reminiscent of George W. Bush, and the Benghazi Committee statement definitely hurt him. \nMcCarthy is a big film buff and often hosts movie night mixers where tea party and establishment representatives enjoy his hospitality and Chick-Fil-A. \nBut his relationship building was to no avail as he declared himself the wrong person to heal the rift in the Republican Party. \nCopyright 2015 Raycom News Network.
