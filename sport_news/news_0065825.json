Funny things happen the year after World Cups and we'd love to be back up there. \n\"We're not getting ahead of ourselves, we know we have to take each game as it comes. \n\"But we got a great start for the boys against Wasps and it's a great place to go this weekend against Leicester, we love going to Welford Road. \n\"We want to be up there and pushing for silverware as much as possible.\" \nQuins have enjoyed an excellent recent record against Leicester in recent years, with Tigers winning only two of the sides' last nine meetings in all competitions. \nLeicester eased past London Irish last weekend and Quins forward Horwill believes his side will have to improve if they want to come away from Welford Road with a win. \n\"I certainly think there's a lot we can improve on from last week but it's a good place to start,\" Horwill said. \n\"The set-piece is always a big challenge. Our line-out wasn't as good as it can be and the scrum was a bit scratchy early on. \n\"If we can set the platform we've got some great finishers and some real gas in the back line. \n\"If we can give those guys the ball on the front foot they know what to do with it.\" \nSome have suggested Leicester's place in the top four may be under threat this season but the five-time champions looked impressive against Irish on the opening day. \nThey also welcome back World Cup trio Tom Youngs, Dan Cole and Vereniki Goneva for this weekend's clash, while Harlequins have picked England's Mike Brown at full-back. \n\"Quins have recruited well in the summer, they play their own style of rugby and they are always very difficult to play against,\" Leicester boss Richard Cockerill told the official club website. \n\"Our squad put up a great effort at Irish last week and that group of players who took us through the pre-season and into that game deserved the opportunity. \n\"Now we have the majority of the World Cup boys back and we want to integrate them and pick from a position of even greater strength.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:21:07.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
