But Hoiberg did try the jumbo lineup of Pau Gasol at center, Joakim Noah at power forward and Nikola Mirotic at small forward.\nAnd that meant Gibson wasn't the Bulls' only preseason debut.\nGasol and Noah hadn't played together since last season, a pairing that produced both highs and lows. Noah, who sat the last two games with a minor knee bruise, has said not to judge the pairing's performance off last season. That was when Noah's surgically repaired left knee never fully cooperated.\nAn offseason spent at an acclaimed sports science academy has Noah optimistic about the pairing. But at least for the first half, it looked like more of the same. In fact, Hoiberg ditched the look for the second half and started Doug McDermott for Noah.\nNoah, playing defensively more on the perimeter, gave up two quick open 3-point looks to Marcus Morris in the first half. Andre Drummond bulled through Gasol for 14 points and 10 rebounds. And Mirotic, who replaced the injured Tony Snell, admitted he's more comfortable at power forward.\nAll the action from the United Center.\nAs for the change from the big lineup in the second half, Hoiberg just said: \"We weren't very energetic out of the gate.\"\nBefore the game, Hoiberg said, \"I just want to see how we look with it. Can we keep the pace with that group? Is the spacing going to be OK with that group?\"\nOffense didn't pose as many issues as defense with the lineup last season. Noah and Gasol are both excellent passers and often found each other in high-low looks during halfcourt sets.\nBut with the proliferation of \"stretch-four\" shooters at power forward in today's NBA, Noah's defensive strengths — lateral quickness, showing and recovering, switching onto smaller players —were negated sometimes.\n\"I think we can be very good together,\" Gasol said.\nAs for Gibson, he logged two first-half stints totaling 9 minutes, 47 seconds. Hoiberg said he anticipates the valuable reserve to play in the Oct. 27 regular-season opener after Gibson's left ankle surgery in June.\n\"It's completely strong, no pain,\" Gibson said. \"I'm jumping a lot better, a lot higher. I'm just having fun. Guys are throwing me lobs all the time. Coach Fred has been great, just monitoring how I'm feeling every day.\n\"The offense is so open. It feels like I'm back in college, how we just run and up down the court without any cares. I can't explain the feeling in practice. Coach Fred is so easygoing, it's really fun.\"\nGibson finished with four points and two rebounds with solid defense. His return didn't slow rookie Bobby Portis' strong preseason. The first-round pick knocked down another 3-pointer and continued to display a confident stroke on his jumper, finishing with 11 points.\n\"I already see his determination,\" Gibson said. \"He gets up shots late. I come in late at night too and he's always in there. Scrimmages and practices, he's always listening to me. He's just a good, young talented player.\"\nLayups: Derrick Rose got fitted for his mask and received clearance for non-contact activity, shooting for several minutes before the game. \"I know he's excited about getting a sweat going,\" Hoiberg said. Rose, who still has some swelling and vision issues from the left orbital he fractured Sept. 29 and had surgically repaired the next day, won't practice or lift weights \"for at least the next several days,\" according to Hoiberg. … E'Twaun Moore started at point guard after Kirk Hinrich sat with a minor foot issue and scored a team-high 16. … Hoiberg said he viewed the four-day break between games — three of which feature practice — as an opportunity to correct recent defensive issues. The Pistons pulled away with a 38-point fourth quarter.\nkcjohnson@tribpub.com\nTwitter @kcjhoop\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Joakim Noah Fred Hoiberg Taj Gibson Pau Gasol Chicago Bulls Detroit Pistons Nikola Mirotic", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561f12a1/turbine/ct-bulls-vs-pistons-photos-spt-20151014", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561fa2ea/turbine/ct-gibson-gasol-noah-bulls-spt-1015-20151014"], "published": "2015-10-15T05:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:04:55.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
