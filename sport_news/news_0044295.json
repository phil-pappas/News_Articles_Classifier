The best month of the sports calendar. \nPerched on the cusp of Major League Baseball's post season, with opening night in both the NBA and NHL looming and just one month shy of the College Football Playoff beginning their weekly exercises of making-it-up-on-the-fly television show. \nWait, I meant, thoroughly and logically explaining their choices if the college football playoff were selecting the four participating teams that evening. That's what I really meant. And, believe me, when it comes to college football, the only sport where what we thought before the season trumps what we see during it, narrowing it down to four is no easy task. It's going to take a whole lot of those big chocolate chip cookies and caramel swirl lattes to figure out this puzzle. \nBefore I continue, let me admit that it's probably too early to really complain about the group think that currently exists in the two major polls, neither of which have any direct role in selecting the Fab Four. But, unlike every other sport we'd even consider following, \"expert\" opinions are the central driving force. The polls, around for more than three quarters of a century, shape the public discourse and give us the basic framework for the season. Teams that begin the year near the top of the rankings will remain there until it's plainly obvious they don't belong -- I'm looking at you, Oregon. And, even if those teams fall out of the Top 25, beat a couple of scrubs and you'll be among the first to return. AP Top 25 College Football Poll \nBottom line, I'm going to get in on the ground floor of whining about the way the experts think. I'll be the hipster who discovered the beatnik coffee house (do those even exist any more?) before it wins some sort of local award for scones and goes mainstream. \nAdam, will you please get to the freaking point? \nSorry, you're right. \nWhy in the name of Kirk Herbstreit is Ohio State still ranked first? Granted, they've lost a good deal of voter support, having been a unanimous No. 1 before the season according to the Associated Press. But, it makes me wonder what the 38 voters who still have the Buckeyes on top have been watching because there are possibly 10 schools that are also undefeated who have been more impressive than tOSU. When can we start taking into account what we see as opposed to what we thought? \nHow about as soon as NC State plays their first Power Five conference team? \n(Please accept my apology for that cheap shot.) \nOn College Game Day, Herbstreit sheepishly tried to fool the panel with his, \"I still think the Buckeyes have been the best team so far\", idea. Thankfully, there was pushback, but it's not like Kirk is the only one caping up for Ohio State. Yes, tOSU is 5-0, but there are 20 teams in that category after the first October weekend and roughly half of them have beaten a better group of teams in getting there. \nHeck, the Buckeyes aren't even the most accomplished unbeaten team in their own conference. Northwestern, yes Northwestern, with wins over Stanford (4-1), Duke (4-1) and Minnesota (3-2) has proven more than Ohio State. Keep in mind that I'm not suggesting that the Wildcats are better than tOSU or that they'll be ranked higher at season's end, I'm just suggesting that after a month of Saturdays it's time to start ranking what's actually happened. \nIf I was sequestered in that Dallas hotel room, armed with the necessary information like the very arbitrary \"Game Control\" that was invented by the committee a year ago, here's the four I'd spit out before heading over to the Ballpark at Arlington to buy my Rangers-Blue Jays ALDS Game 3 tickets…. \n1) Utah (4-0)…I know I just finished pointing out how Oregon was the poster child for preconceived notions, but the Utes are the gang that administered that molly whopping. What Utah did to the Ducks in Eugene is considered a felony in the lower 48. Throw in the season-opening win over Michigan and another over little brother Utah State and I'm buying what head coach Kyle Whittingham is selling so far. \n2) LSU (4-0)…The Bayou Bengals are 2-0 in conference play with wins over teams that were ranked at the time but aren't today. Still any win in the SEC West carries some weight, even though Mississippi State and Auburn are likely to end the year near the bottom of that side of the league's standings. Throw in a road win over a mildly stubborn Syracuse squad and 75 percent of the Tigers' opponents have come from Power Five conferences. \n3) Northwestern (5-0)…Some tried to mock the Wildcats' season-opening win over Stanford, but then the Cardinal won at Southern Cal and Northwestern proved to have the bigger slide rule in the battle of the brains in a win over Duke at Wallace Wade Stadium. The Cats also shut out Minnesota in their Big Ten opener and while it's a big ask to think they'll still be here in November, they deserve it right now. \n4) Oklahoma (4-0)…The Sooners have already set the NCAA record for wins over teams ranked 23rd at game time. They won in Knoxville when the Volunteers were in the polls (yes, fortune smiled on OU that night as Tennessee coughed up the game, but credit to Oklahoma for the furious comeback) and they just cruised past Big 12 rival West Virginia after the Mountaineers had crept into the lower portion of the Top 25. Akron and Tulsa aren't great, but they're not lower division fodder either and the Sooners are getting points from me for QB Baker Mayfield, who has the most Oklahoma quarterback name ever. \nTexas A&M (5-0), Clemson (4-0), Michigan State (5-0), Ohio State (5-0) TCU (5-0), and Florida (5-0) are all in the mix with the Gators showing the star power of a big SEC home win over an overrated conference team. Either way, there's so much football to be played, and this is guaranteed to change every week until conference championship weekend is complete. \nIf you're looking for Baylor, sorry. Yes, the Bears are 4-0, but a national contender with a non-conference schedule of SMU (1-4), Rice (2-3) and Lamar (1-2 in FCS) would never, ever, under any circumstance receive my vote. Try harder, Baylor. Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:39:58.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
