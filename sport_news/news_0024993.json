Facing a 17-6 fourth-quarter deficit, Cutler hit Marquess Wilson for a 22-yard touchdown with 3 minutes 5 seconds left, then delivered the game-winning dart to Matt Forte, a 7-yard score with 18 seconds left. Cutler's fourth-quarter numbers — 11-for-20, 79 yards, two TDs — weren't mind-blowing. But his late-game magic was impressive. All that came with an injury-depleted receiving corps and the third starting offensive line the Bears have used this season.\nToo cold\nMartellus Bennett\nThe normally reliable tight end bobbled a deep ball from Cutler on the final drive, a pass that would've put the Bears inside the Chiefs' 5. At the time, the Bears trailed 17-12 with 1:10 left and the incompletion looked like a missed opportunity the offense would lament after another frustrating loss. The Bears' ability to steal another win late softened Bennett's miscue. But the tight end caught only four of 11 balls targeted for him, finishing with 32 yards, his second-lowest total this season.\nJust right\nMarquess Wilson\nWith Alshon Jeffery missing his fourth game and Eddie Royal also inactive, the Bears needed Wilson to emerge. He came through with six catches for 85 yards and a touchdown while also drawing a 24-yard pass-interference penalty late. Said Cutler: \"He's growing up. And he kind of has to grow up. He doesn't have a choice. … I'm kind of hard on him during the week. Saturday we kind of love on him a little bit to get him ready for Sunday.\"\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears Matt Forte", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561aea47/turbine/ct-three-bears-spt-1012-20151011"], "published": "2015-10-12T01:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:30:15.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
