The Mustangs went into halftime with a 42-30 lead thanks to a late score and wasted no time extending that lead in the third quarter. Lucerne Valley received the second-half kickoff and scored on its first drive. California Lutheran fumbled on the following drive and the Mustangs took over at the C-Hawks’ 40-yard line. Lucerne Valley went on to score to take a commanding lead. California Lutheran scored just once in the second half as Lucerne Valley’s defense cleaned a few things up. “We just tried to keep our guys fired up and reminded them of some of their responsibilities,” said Lucerne Valley head coach Chris Klinger. “They were throwing some wide receiver screens on us and getting big yardage and we played those much better in the second half.” Jacob Carmona and Zack Mejia each found the end zone multiple times for the Mustangs, as did backup running back Jacob Kleber. “We had a lot of guys contribute, good team effort tonight,” said Klinger. Lucerne Valley next hosts Hesperia Christian in what may be the Mustangs’ toughest matchup of the Agape League slate. “We’re going to face a tough team in Hesperia Christian, but I think we’ll match up well against them,” said Klinger. “They’re similar to us, run a similar formation.” That game will begin at 7 p.m. in Lucerne Valley on Oct. 16.
