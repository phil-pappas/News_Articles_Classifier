The Huskers host the Michigan State Spartans on Wednesday at 7 p.m. to begin the week. The match will be televised on the Big Ten Network and will be streamed online at BTN2GO.com. Kevin Kugler and Kathi Weiskamp will call the action. John Baylor and Diane Mendenhall will have the radio call on Husker Sports Network (107.3 FM in Lincoln and 105.9 FM in Omaha). A free live audio stream and live stats are available at Huskers.com. \nNebraska (12-2, 3-1 Big Ten) faced a difficult task last week, traveling across the country to play two top-13 teams within a 24-hour span. The Huskers fought back from a 2-0 deficit to defeat No. 1 Penn State, 3-2, in University Park on Friday night. The Huskers also trailed game five, 5-1, but rallied for their first-ever true road win over a No. 1 team in school history, and the victory also snapped Penn State’s 33-match win streak. Nebraska won for just the second time in five tries at Penn State, with the other win coming in 1993. The Huskers concluded the weekend with a 3-2 loss at Ohio State on Saturday night, bringing an end to NU’s nine-match win streak, its longest since 2011. NU fell behind 2-1 but rallied again with a fourth-set win to force game five. But the Buckeyes led from start to finish in the decisive set. \nMichigan State (10-5, 2-2 Big Ten) split a pair of matches against No. 23 Michigan last week. The Spartans swept the Wolverines in East Lansing last Wednesday and held a 2-0 lead on the road on Saturday before the Wolverines rallied to win the last three sets to get the split. Michigan State’s other Big Ten loss came at home against Purdue (3-1). The Spartans own a sweep over Indiana and have won seven of their last nine matches. \nNebraska leads the all-time series, 14-2-2. The Huskers won a pair of 3-1 matches against the Spartans last year and have won three in a row in the series. Michigan State has never beaten the Huskers in Lincoln. Head Coach John Cook is 19-6 all-time facing Michigan State and 9-2 while at Nebraska. \nAbout the Huskers \n• Nebraska leads the Big Ten with 15.81 digs per set and ranks 64th in the nation. \n• The Huskers are hitting .272 on the season to rank third in the Big Ten and 17th nationally. \n• Nebraska averages 14.27 kills per set, which ranks third in the conference and 16th in the nation. \n• Libero Justine Wong-Orantes averages a team-best 4.08 digs per set and has played every set in 59 consecutive matches dating back to her freshman season in 2013.
