Santiago, in the head just after 9 p.m. Saturday, prosecutors said.\nPolice said the boy was playing cops and robbers.\nSantiago, 25, gave a videotaped statement to police in which he admitted he bought the gun off the street for protection. He was charged with felony child endangerment causing death.\nProsecutors said Sunday that Santiago had no concealed carry license, nor did he have a firearm owner’s identification card.\nThe boys were under the supervision of their grandfather, who was in an upstairs apartment when he heard the shot.\nThe grandfather carried the boy from the family’s apartment on the 1000 block of North Francisco Avenue about a block to Norwegian American Hospital. The boy was later transferred to Mount Sinai Hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\nAt the time of the shooting, Santiago was working at a pizza restaurant that he manages. His wife was at a grocery store buying milk with the couple’s third child, who is 1 year old.\nAccording to the public defender assigned to the case, Santiago’s family could gather only $1,000 for bond.\nSantiago’s family wept during the hearing and declined to speak with reporters in the hallway of the criminal courts building at 26th Street and California Avenue.\nSantiago has no felony convictions on his record. In 2010, he was convicted of misdemeanor theft and disorderly conduct, prosecutors said.\nSantiago, who wore a T-shirt bearing the logo of the pizza shop he manages and kept quiet in court while mostly looking at the floor, is the primary caretaker and provider of the family, his public defender said.\nThe bail amount, be it high or low, “is not going to bring back this child,” the judge lamented.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:08:05.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
