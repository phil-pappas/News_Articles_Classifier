However, Jorge Messi subsequently claimed he was in charge of his son's finances and pleaded for charges against the player to be dropped.\nJorge Messi also made a corrective payment of five million euros in August 2013 to cover alleged unpaid taxes plus interest, which should mitigate any sentence.\nMessi, 28, is the fourth richest sportsman in the world, according to Forbes magazine, which estimates he earns almost $74 million a year.\nHe is widely expected to add a record fifth Ballon d'Or for the world's best player to his collection on January 11 after leading Barca to a treble of Champions League, La Liga and Copa del Rey titles last season.\nHowever, the trial is just the latest blow for the Argentine, who will be out of action for another six weeks with knee ligament damage suffered in Barca's 2-1 win over Las Palmas on September 26.\nThe injury has also forced him to miss the start of Argentina's World Cup qualifying campaign at home to Ecuador on Thursday.\nOn the pitch Barca have struggled without their talisman as the Catalans squeezed past Las Palmas and Bayer Leverkusen 2-1 before losing 2-1 at Sevilla on Saturday.\nMeanwhile, a separate investigation is being carried out in Barcelona that could lead to another tax fraud case against Messi related to a number of charity matches in aid of his foundation which were played in South America in 2012 and 2013.\nMessi is just one of a number of high profile footballers in Spain under scrutiny from the tax authorities for the management of their image rights.\nHis Barcelona and Argentina teammate Javier Mascherano will also face trial on October 29 far failing to declare 1.5 million euros by ceding his image rights to companies he owns in Portugal and the United States.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:02:34.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
