You may not be over last week's last-second heartbreak delivered by Geneva, but it's time to spit the bad taste out and look at the bright side. You're 3-1 and have played really good football. You've scored the most points in the Upstate Eight River and given up the fewest. You're going to need to think positive thoughts with Batavia (4-0) coming to town tonight. The schedule did you no favors, having to play the two most established teams in the league in consecutive weeks, but let's go back to the bright side. This is an opportunity to prove without a doubt they're one of them. And if you beat Batavia and Batavia beats Geneva, you could be a conference champion. St. Charles North 34, Batavia 28.\nHello, Marist. Does anyone play more fun games than you? Last week's 49-42 victory over Notre Dame was vintage Marist. So too is the quarterback play of Brendan Skalitzky, who threw for 249 yards and four touchdowns to one receiver (Liam Keffer) last week and was 26-37 for 376 overall. You're 3-1 (2-0 in the East Suburban Catholic) and on your way to Lisle to play Benet (3-1, 1-1). Your loss was respectable, 21-14 to No. 3 Mount Carmel, but keep in mind the ESCC is really good this year. Marian Central (4-0) is not on your schedule, but your final two games are at defending champion Nazareth (3-1, 1-1) and at Joliet Catholic (4-0, 2-0). In other words, you can't afford to slip up against a Benet team that may well have a say in the ESCC race before it's all said and done. Marist 35, Benet 33.\nWhaddup, New Trier? You have a bright future, your numbers are strong and you're looking good, 4-0 heading into tonight's game at Evanston (3-1) You make no secret about your desire to end Maine South's 15-year CSL South winning streak, and why not? Are you not supposed to want to snap it? Maybe you're ready. If you are, you will handle a talented Wildkits team in convincing fashion. New Trier 34, Evanston 22.\nI didn't forget about you, Thornton. Truth be told, I don't know much about you. Google wasn't any help. A guy on Twitter raves about your quarterback, and he's obviously not the only one doing things right. You're 4-0, you score 37 points a game and you give up 1.5. Anyway, I think we agree you won't come up with another 37-1.5 victory over Lincoln-Way West (4-0), but I'm not going to say you can't win this game. West hasn't played anyone with a winning record either. And it probably doesn't know how to score a half a point. Thornton 21.5, Lincoln-Way West 21.\nMike Helfgot's football blog: Maine South knows how to rebound Mike Helfgot From pictures to banners to trophies to motivational speeches, Maine South's players are constantly reminded of the program's glorious history.\nIt can be a lot of pressure, which perhaps was a factor in the team's rough start this fall.\nIt can also be a source of comfort, a lesson in the importance...\nFrom pictures to banners to trophies to motivational speeches, Maine South's players are constantly reminded of the program's glorious history.\nIt can be a lot of pressure, which perhaps was a factor in the team's rough start this fall.\nIt can also be a source of comfort, a lesson in the importance...\n(Mike Helfgot) Mike Helfgot is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.\n High School Football", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56043496/turbine/ct-spt-0924-prep-fb-helfgot-blog-20150923", "http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56059aa4/turbine/ct-spt-0929-prep-fb-helfgot-blog-20150928"], "published": "2015-09-28T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:59:03.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
