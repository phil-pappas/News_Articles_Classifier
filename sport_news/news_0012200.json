When will Ryan Goins break out of his hitting slump?\nGoins, of course, isn’t in the lineup for his bat, but the Jays certainly need more out of him at the plate. The defensive wizard at second is hitless in 13 at-bats with one walk.\n2. What’s the basis for Troy Tulowitzki’s popularity with Toronto fans?\nTulo came to T.O. with huge expectations and a reputation for being an outstanding shortstop both with the glove and bat, but his hitting since touching down at the Rogers Centre has been unimpressive. In these playoffs, he’s batting .118 in 17 at-bats, but he did slug that huge home run on Sunday. Still, the love affair seems a bit odd.\n3. Is Kevin Pillar getting the attention he deserves this series?\nBesides his usual outstanding glove in centre field, Pillar has been the Jays’ most consistent hitter against the Rangers, batting .412 with seven hits in 17 at-bats, including two doubles, a home run and four RBI.\n4. Will Edwin Encarnacion hit a home run?\nThough he has only one extra-base hit in the series — a double — E.E. has come really close from putting it over the wall at least three times. He’s due big-time.\n5. Did John Gibbons plan to use Marcus Stroman as the Game 5 starter all along?\nThat seems pretty obvious from Game 3 when he had David Price warming up in the bullpen and then used the veteran lefty in Game 4 for three innings (and 50 pitches) against Texas — all but eliminating any chance of Price pitching out of the ’pen in the deciding game on Wednesday. (Although Price said he’d be ready to pitch and Gibbons back-tracked a bit on Tuesday.) A Texas newspaper called the use of Price in Game 4 with a 7-1 lead “a half-baked decision,” but Gibbons had visions of Stroman in Game 5 all along, it seems.\n6. Will home field make a difference in Game 5?\nAccording to how this series has gone, no. Toronto lost the first two games at the Rogers Centre and won both at Globe Life Park in Arlington. To a man, though, every player in the Jays’ clubhouse believes coming home and playing in front of a raucous crowd will be an advantage. “Normally, you wouldn’t expect it to be that way. But it has been,” said Jays catcher Russell Martin when asked about the home-park disadvantage so far. “But we’ll try to break that trend. It’s going to be nuts (at Rogers Centre). Love it. It’s going to be awesome.”\n7. How big a part has non-roster infielder Munenori Kawasaki been in keeping the Jays loose and relaxed?\nApparently, bigger than you think. Numerous Jays have commented about how great Kawasaki has been for morale. “Kawasaki was dancing on the bus after we lost the first two games on the way to our hotel and it was hilarious,” said R.A. Dickey.\n8. Will the Rangers’ big bashers Prince Fielder and Josh Hamilton break out of their slumps in Game 5?\nFielder has two hits in four games and zero homers, Hamilton the same. Both are hitting below the Mendoza line. Breaking out of their respective slumps could be the difference in Game 5. Rangers manager Jeff Banister sees signs that Fielder is close to breaking out. “This is a guy, when things click, he can take over a game and drive the ball all over the ballpark and even out of the ballpark. And it really felt like there were some balls that were well-hit (Monday) off of his barrel that were really close.”\n9. Will Adrian Beltre play in Game 5?\nBanister calls the club’s third baseman the heart and soul of the team and one of the toughest guys he’s ever met, particularly when it comes to playing through pain. Beltre is said to be really hurting with his back problems, but he told Banister prior to Game 4 that he wanted to play — and he did, going 2-for-4.\n10. Is Banister getting second-guessed for going with Game 2 starter Cole Hamels in Game 5 ahead of Game 1 winner Yovani Gallardo, who has done a great job against the Jays this year?\nAnd, if the Jays get to Hamels and Texas loses Game 5, will Banister get raked over the coals like Gibbons surely will if the Rangers get to Stroman on Wednesday?\nEmail: steve.buffery@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter: @beezersun\nMLB PLAYOFFS\n10 questions to ponder ahead of Game 5 of the ALDS\nBy Steve Buffery , Toronto Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 05:11 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 05:20 PM EDT\nAnswers aren’t always easy to come by in MLB post-season playoff action.\nUsually, the managers and the best players are brought down to the interview room after a game and asked a limited number of questions before they’re hustled away.\nSo, given the restraints put on the media during the ALDS series between the Blue Jays and Texas Rangers, we’ve come up with a list of 10 questions that can only be answered by a psychic.\n1.
