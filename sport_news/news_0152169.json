A short, rail-thin defensive back, this player looked more ready for accounting school than Big Eight football. \nStill, when coach Barry Switzer gathered his freshmen away from the rest of that 1984 team, he pulled this skinny kid to the front. \n“Don’t let his size fool you,” Switzer told a group that included Troy Aikman, Keith Jackson and Lydell Carr. \n“He will probably end up being better than any one of you.” \nSize didn’t matter for this player, who went on to become a first-team All-American, a Jim Thorpe Award winner and the fifth overall pick in the 1988 NFL Draft. \nToday, Rickey Dixon weighs around 130 pounds, can only walk a short distance on his own and has trouble talking. Two years ago, he was officially diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a disease that kills motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord, causing progressive muscle deterioration. There is no known cure. \nDoctors have told Dixon’s family that it’s likely his ALS stems from the multiple concussions he sustained throughout his football playing career. \nBut Dixon wants everyone in Sooner Nation to know something: He’s going to be just fine. \n“It is very important to me to let people know that I am doing well and that my faith is strong,” Dixon wrote in an email to The Oklahoman, choosing to be interviewed that way to rest his vocal cords. \n“I stand on Romans 10:9 and Proverbs 18:21. Please let Sooner Nation know this.” \nDixon will stand on Owen Field and be honored with other members of the 1985 national championship team during a halftime ceremony at Saturday’s Oklahoma-West Virginia game. \nAn Unthinkable Diagnosis \nAfter Dixon’s standout career at Oklahoma, he played six seasons in the NFL with the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Raiders, even playing in the Bengals’ Super Bowl XXIII loss to the San Francisco 49ers as a rookie. \nHe married, had four children and became a high school football coach and motivational speaker in Dallas, but around four years ago, Dixon began losing weight and found himself in occasional pain. At first, he and his wife, Lorraine, believed it was arthritis-related. \nBut when the weight loss continued and he began having trouble speaking, they went to the doctor and, in July 2013, received the terrifying diagnosis: Dixon had ALS, a devastating disease also known as “Lou Gehrig’s disease,” after the legendary New York Yankees first baseman who died of ALS in 1941 at age 37. \nOther former NFL players such as Steve Gleason, Tim Shaw, Kevin Turner and O.J. Brigance have also been diagnosed with ALS in the last 10 years. \n“When he was playing football, the concern was always with his spine, paralysis, that kind of thing,” Lorraine Dixon said. “I never imagined that football could lead to this.” \nThe Dixons kept Rickey’s battle with ALS relatively quiet for the first two years. Only close friends — including fellow former OU defensive back Tony Rayburn, Jackson and Switzer — and family members knew. \n“When you’re away from it and don’t see it every day, you don’t really understand the gravity of how severe something is,” said Rayburn, who lives in Edmond. “The first time I saw him, it wasn’t as bad, and then every time I saw him it seemed a little worse. \n“Probably within the last year, it’s really taken a turn and started affecting him a lot more. I still call him and talk through things with him. We pray together.” \nJackson, who is now a radio commentator for Arkansas football games, drives down to visit Dixon often. \n“You sit down to talk to him, thinking you’re gonna cheer him up, and he ends up cheering you up,” Jackson said. “He’s just so positive. Not that he doesn’t realize what’s going on; he just has a deep faith that God is with him.” \nSwitzer visited in early September and tweeted a picture of him sitting with Dixon, whose legs and arms are extremely thin from the weight loss and muscle deterioration. In the tweet, Switzer told the world that his former All-American player was battling ALS. \nSince then, a fundraising campaign was started by a group of former Sooners on GoFundMe.com and countless well wishers have contacted the Dixons. \n“A proud athlete is sometimes too proud to ask for help,” Rayburn said. “Everybody wants to think they don’t need to reach out to anybody if they need help and are struggling. We’re trying to break those walls down, break that pridefulness down. \n“It’s just like when we were on the field. We looked out for each other on the field, and we’re gonna look out for each other in life.” \n‘Part Of The Journey’ \nRickey and Lorraine Dixon developed their strong, unyielding faith in God about four years ago, when their then-6-year old son Cameron suffered from encephalitis, a brain inflammation that resulted in two strokes, put him in a coma and developmentally delayed him. \n“He is a mini me,” Rickey Dixon wrote in the e-mail interview. “Even though he is limited, he is the most loving child you will ever meet.” \nLorraine said the ALS subject doesn’t come up much in the Dixon household, especially since their 7-year old daughter, Alana, asked her mom, “Is my daddy going to heaven?” \n“It’s just so hard to explain to a 7-year old who is so fond of her father,” Lorraine said. “We try not to focus on ALS so much in our home. This is just part of the journey for us.” \nDixon will make his first trip to an OU football game in about five years this weekend, when he’ll be honored along with his 1985 national championship teammates. \nHe says he can’t wait to be on Owen Field and “feel that Sooner Magic again.” \n“Many people ask me if I regret playing football,” Dixon wrote. “I don’t regret playing football. \n“Yes, I would play again. I would love the chance to beat Texas again and play in another Super Bowl. I would just play the game differently. \n“Football allowed me to retire my mom, to provide for my family … it exposed me to a whole different environment and I met some incredible people along the way. \n“We trust Jesus. His word says, ‘In this world we will have trouble, but be of good faith.’ \n“ALS ain’t got nothing on me!” \nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:06:11.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
