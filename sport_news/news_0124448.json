Scott is the first McNeese player to be named to the list since 2012 when Malcolm Bronson was named to that season's the preseason watch list. Moving from linebacker to free safety during the offseason, Scott, a native of Weyanoke, has played a key role in leading McNeese’s defense to the top of the FCS statistical rankings in scoring (7.8 ppg), second in rushing (68.5 ypg), and third in total defense (255.3) as the Cowboys have built a 6-0 overall record heading into Saturday’s Homecoming game against Northwestern State.He’s recorded 32 tackles on the season, has two sacks, 3 ½ tackles for a loss and has recovered three fumbles with 142 return yards, a McNeese single season record. The NCAA and Southland Conference do not keep such records. He’s scored two touchdowns off those returns – 97 yards at Stephen F. Austin and 45 yards at Central Arkansas.Scott has been named the Southland Conference’s Defensive Player of the Week three times this season, including the last two weeks.McNeese has had two finalists for the award since its establishment in 1995 by The Sports Network. Bryan Smith was a finalist in both the 2006 and 2007 seasons. He finished seventh in the voting in 2006 and was third in 2007.Haley Prince finished second in the 2002 voting for the award as he helped lead the Cowboys to the 1-AA National Championship game that season.A national panel of over 150 sports information and media relation directors, broadcasters, writers and other dignitaries will vote on the award after the regular season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T22:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T04:57:56.796+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
