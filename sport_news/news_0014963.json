He has four sacks and 21 hurries on his 242 pass rushes.\nOregon ranked 125th in the nation in passing defense, allowing 323.5 yards per game, but UW quarterback Jake Browning will need time to take advantage of that. The Ducks rank third in the Pac-12 with 17 sacks through six games, and the Huskies have allowed 12 sacks in five games.\nOpponents have regularly double-teamed Buckner this season, and UW would be wise to do the same. UW offensive line coach Chris Strausser lauded Buckner this week, and also said considered nose tackle Alex Balducci an underrated player on Oregon’s defensive line.\n  Buckner is a projected top-10 NFL draft pick , and he presents a significant challenge for young Adams.\n“He’s making strides every week, which is really important for a true freshman,” Strausser said. “Sometimes those guys plateau. Right now, he’s continuing to make good strides. He watches film every week of the next opponent and he knows he needs to make strides, because the opponents get better and better every week.”\nAdam Jude : 206-464-2364 or ajude@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @A_Jude .
