The Great Danes have arrived at their bye week.\nUAlbany, wracked by injuries and starved for points, will use the time off to try to salvage what's left of its season after getting shellacked again Saturday.\nNo. 25 Villanova took advantage of five turnovers in a 37-0 rout of UAlbany at Casey Stadium.\n\"I have a lot of thinking to do of what we can do,\" Great Danes head coach Greg Gattuso said. \"I told them after the game I may be calm right now on the exterior, but I'm not happy right now. And that's not them. It's me. This coaching staff and myself need to pick it up. I need to figure out some of the disconnect we're having getting some of our points across.\"\nThe Great Danes have lost their past three games by a combined score of 113-7. Their past two defeats, including a 39-7 loss to Maine last week, are the two most lopsided home losses in the program's 17 seasons at the Football Championship Subdivision level.\nGattuso said he'll give his players a few days off while the coaches go out recruiting.\nUAlbany senior defensive tackle Samuel Gray agreed the players need the break.\n\"It's definitely going to be big for us to get rest,\" Gray said. \"We're getting banged up every game, losing a couple of key players. But this rest is really needed.\"\nUAlbany actually had a chance to lead at halftime against Villanova but found itself trailing 10-0 at intermission.\nThe Great Danes (2-5 overall, 1-3 Colonial Athletic Association ) drove inside the Villanova 5-yard line twice in the second quarter and came away with no points.\nFirst, UAlbany wide receiver Zee Roberson caught an inside screen pass and lost a fumble at the Villanova 4 with 11:18 left in the second quarter.\nThen the Great Danes drove to a first down at the Villanova 1 with 40 seconds left in the half. On second down, the Great Danes lost seven yards when quarterback DJ Crook had to fall on center Adam Wierbinski's low snap, and UAlbany used its final timeout with 20 seconds remaining.\nOn third down, Crook couldn't find a receiver and tried to scramble for the end zone. He was stopped at the Villanova 2 . Then, when UAlbany rushed out kicker Patrick Toole for an 18-yard field-goal attempt, the Great Danes were penalized for a false start because their players weren't all set. By rule, there was a 10-second run-off in the final minute and the half was over.\n\"I've got to use my head more,\" Crook said. \"It's a situation where I've got to throw the ball out of bounds so our kicker has time to kick the field goal.\"\nThe Great Danes fell apart in the second half. Crook threw three interceptions in the third quarter and came out for freshman Neven Sussman , who was picked off in the fourth.\nMeanwhile, Zach Bednarczyk tossed touchdown passes of 51 yards to Kevin Gulyas and 16 yards to Gary Underwood against a UAlbany defense missing three starting linebackers and a safety due to injury.\n\"I'm frustrated,\" Gattuso said. \"My job is to try and figure out what I can do to help us play better. But I've been in this situation before as a player, as a coach, many times in my life. The only way through it is to work hard.\"\nmsingelais@timesunion.com • 518-454-5509 • @MarkSingelais", "external_links": ["http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809328/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809327/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809327/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809329/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809326/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809329/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809326/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/46/55/8809328/5/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:16:54.308+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
