Heavy fighting was underway near the northern city’s airport where government forces retreated, highlighting the potent challenge the militants pose after their lightning capture of Kunduz. The Taliban’s occupation — now in its third day — raises troubling questions about the capabilities of Afghan forces as they battle the militants largely on their own after NATO’s combat mission ended last December. The Afghan army was supposed to be bolstered by its own reinforcements for the campaign to retake Kunduz, but attacks on convoys making their way to the city meant that back-up troops were only trickling in. “The Taliban have laid landmines and booby traps around Kunduz, slowing the movement of convoys of Afghan army reinforcements driving to the city,” an Afghan security official told AFP. NATO said the foreign special forces had reached Kunduz and US forces conducted three air strikes around the city since Tuesday to support the Afghan troops. The forces comprised of US, British and German troops, a Western military source told AFP on condition of anonymity, without specifying the number. — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:11:00.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
