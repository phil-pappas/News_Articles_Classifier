After a video review by the officials and conferring with the league's replay center in Secaucus, New Jersey, Jack was assessed a flagrant-2 foul and was ejected.\nIt was another discouraging moment in what's been a rather pedestrian preseason for Jack. He turned the ball over seven times in his past two games and is 5-for-his-last-13 from the floor.\nNets Nets vs. Celtics preseason Jack, who knows Jerebko well, said his emotions simply got the best of him. Now, he will have to wait to see if the league slaps him with a one-game suspension and sits him down for the Oct. 28 regular-season opener against the Bulls.\n\"I hope not, but I didn't mean to do that actually,\" Jack said. \"A little heat of the moment, a little bit more frustrated than anything and my intention wasn't to do that at all. But I thought the refs did make the proper call.\"\nJack started 27 games for the Nets last season, stepping in for a struggling Deron Williams. Entering this preseason, Hollins said Jack, Bojan Bogdanovic, Joe Johnson, Thaddeus Young and Brook Lopez were going to get the first crack at forming the Nets starting unit.\nHowever, with the exception of a few minutes in the preseason opener, they have not all been on the floor at the same time. Bogdanovic missed a week while nursing a sore right ankle and that certainly didn't help, but Hollins also experimented with a different lineup at the game's outset in each of their initial four preseason contests.\nHollins still has two preseason games left -- the Nets host the 76ers on Sunday before closing their preseason schedule against the Celtics in Boston on Monday -- and said there will be other determinants in deciphering the opening quintet.\n\"It's not just the games,\" Hollins said.\n\"It's every day at practice. It's the whole process that suggests games are there, but it's through the whole thing. So that's how I will evaluate the whole who plays and who doesn't play.\"\n\"As I've said before, it's how the team fits -- each group what they bring, what kind of energy we have, what kind of consistency we have, because this is a big decision, when you decide who starts and who doesn't. So, I don't want to take it lightly.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/performgroup.js", "http://images.eplayer.performgroup.com/namedImage/12637/install_flash.gif", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/swfobject.js"], "published": "2015-10-15T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:46:32.545+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
