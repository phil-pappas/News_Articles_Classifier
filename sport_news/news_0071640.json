Spiller with a short pass that the running back turned into an 80-yard touchdown - the 400th of the Saints quarterback's career - on the second play of overtime, and New Orleans won for the first time this season, 26-20 over the injury-decimated Cowboys on Monday night. Brees, who missed New Orleans' previous game because of a bruised rotator cuff in his right (throwing) shoulder, completed 32 of 39 throws for 279 yards in his return. Mark Ingram gained 126 yards from scrimmage on a combination of runs and short passes, and Khiry Robinson had a 1-yard touchdown run for New Orleans (1-3). Joseph Randle scored the lone TD for Dallas (2-2) on a 1-yard run in the first half. The winning score enlivened a Superdome crowd stunned by Saints kicker Zach Hocker's 30-yard miss in the final seconds of regulation. ___ AP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Aimee sent in this gameday photo Eyewitness News Alexius sent in this gameday photo Eyewitness News Allison sent in this gameday photo Eyewitness News Arion sent in this gameday photo Eyewitness News Avery sent in this gameday photo Eyewitness News Candis sent in this gameday photo Eyewitness News Destini sent in this gameday photo Eyewitness News Kayla sent in this gameday photo Eyewitness News Marci sent in this gameday photo Eyewitness News Roxanne sent in this gameday photo Eyewitness News Tara sent in this gameday photo Eyewitness News Tiffany sent in this gameday photo Eyewitness News Like this topic?
