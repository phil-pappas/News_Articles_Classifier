The Freeport junior can say, regardless anything else in his football career, he once played all five positions on the offensive line. And he did it in one season. No, he did it in one half of one season. “Most of the time it’s during the game,” Simpler said. “I’ll practice all the positions and if someone gets gassed, he’ll throw me into a different one. Basically, our whole offensive line plays anywhere. Three or four of our offensive linemen can be anything needed.” Simpler’s do-it-all resume – he has played left tackle, left guard, center, right guard, right tackle and even tight end – is evidence of Freeport’s necessity for players like Simpler. The Bulldogs, who travel to Mayo at 6:30 p.m. central time Friday to play Lafayette, have around 20 active players for varsity games. The Class 1A school consistently requires players to play offense and defense. “A lot of times our offensive linemen will play both guard positions or they will play both tackle positions,” Freeport coach Jim Anderson said. “He’s the only one who also has played tight end and not all have to play center.” In some cases, players need to switch positions from play to play. “Someone fairly experienced can move around a lot,” Anderson said. “Dalton is an excellent blocker, works hard in the weight room and has a good attitude. Him and fellow offensive linemen Aaron Parker and Codie Haberek are our three best-conditioned athletes.” Freeport (3-2) became somewhat of a trendy Cinderella pick in District 4-1A before losing to Freeport last week. The loss soured the Bulldogs’ 3-1 start, but they can move closer to a winning season with a win Friday. Simpler has recorded 18 sacks, the second most on the team, and one sack as a defensive lineman. His real value comes on offense, though. Simpler doesn’t get the ball – at least, not yet – but he is part of an offensive line averaging 264 yards per game. Chris Decker has 454 yards from 65 carries and Zack Seay has 223 yards from 41 carries. “We take a lot of pride in it,” Simpler said, \"because it lets us know we are blocking for our running back and our running back isn’t being selfish and running outside. He’s hitting the holes.” No, Simpler doesn’t show up in the offensive statistics. But he does have one unique accomplishment, something all those guys atop the rushing, passing and receiving leaderboards never will get.
