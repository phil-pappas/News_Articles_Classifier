(Chris Young/The Canadian Press via AP) \nThe Cavaliers will win their first NBA championship and James will claim his fifth MVP award in the process, according to results of the NBA.com GM survey released Tuesday. \nThe Cavs received 53.6 percent of the votes from those responding to the poll, beating out San Antonio (25 percent). Cleveland reached the finals last year before falling to Golden State, which finished third in the poll with 17.9 percent of the votes. \nJames got 39.3 percent of the MVP votes to outpace New Orleans' Anthony Davis (25 percent). Davis got an astounding 86.2 percent of the votes as the player executives would want to build a franchise around now. \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T17:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:00:39.113+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
