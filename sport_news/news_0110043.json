The problem was discovered during a FDA inspection at the Warrenton facility. Skipanon announced a blanket recall a week ago .\nThe FDA said the cans were potentially under processed, which can cause botulism. The bacterium does not smell and can't be seen but it's potentially deadly. Symptoms of poisoning include weakness, dizziness, double-vision and trouble with speaking or swallowing. Difficulty in breathing, abdominal distension and constipation are also common.\nThe cans should be pitched. Anyone who experiences symptoms should seek immediate medical assistance.\nNo illnesses have been reported.\nConsumers with questions about the Bornstein recalls should contact the company at 503-325-6164 or e-mail bornstein@bornstein.com . Skipanon can be reached at 503-861-8277 or by e-mail at recallskipanonbrand@gmail.com .\n-- Lynne Terry\nlterry@oregonian.com\n@LynnePDX", "external_links": ["http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm466521.htm", "https://twitter.com/lynnepdx", "http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/ucm467441.htm"], "published": "2015-10-20T16:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:55:58.738+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
