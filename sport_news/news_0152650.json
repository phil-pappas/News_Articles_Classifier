Human trafficking has always been a lucrative business, but rates and profits have gone up in recent months following instability in key West Asian countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya. Families from these countries seeking a more stable life in Europe are joining the queues of others from more established sources of illegal immigration, like India, Pakistan and Bangladesh, who are attracted by the higher wages and free health care and education available in the UK. Current rates charged for helping fugitives evade the UK border controls can be as high as the equivalent of Rs 10 lakh per person, representing pure profit for those involved in organising the smuggling network. The British police have highlighted the example of one such network, headed by an Iraqi Kurd named as Fahmi Hakim who made crores in profits by organising human cargoes. Police seized £90,000 in cash from Hakim before he was arrested and sentenced to 11 years in prison. Ironically, Hakim himself was smuggled into the UK as an illegal immigrant more than 10 years ago when he escaped from Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. He subsequently worked closely with NRI gang leaders, named Kuldip Singh (37) from Wolverhampton and Major Bajwa (44) from East London, to develop his smuggling network. Both Singh and Baja have Indian passports. A spokesman for Britain’s National Crime Agency commented, “There is an organised criminal minority in every community. The NCA would expect to, and does, see evidence that some people smuggling networks are operated by individuals who have themselves been smuggled, though by no means exclusively. “Whilst people smugglers may use their knowledge, language and experience in seeking out opportunities, they are fundamentally serious organised criminals who make no distinction for race or ethnicity. They are in it for profit, and they will offer to smuggle anyone who can pay”. In the case of Hakim’s network, Singh and Bajwa worked with Russian and Dutch agents to bring six Indians via Moscow, Slovakia and Dunkirk to the UK. For the last part of their journey from Eastern Europe, they were hidden in the backs of lorries. Although detailed information is available about Singh, Bajwa and Hakim, other ethnic communities, including Vietnamese, Sri Lankans and Syrians, are also involved in the smuggling operations. Two months ago, Syrian national Omran Hassan was extradited to Holland to stand trial for allegedly masterminding the smuggling of some 200 Syrian and Afghan nationals into the UK. One year earlier Sri Lankan immigrant Sudharshan Jeyakodi from Luton was arrested and jailed for helping smuggle fellow Sri Lankans into the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:13:55.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
