We talked about it, of course, but I am not an idiot. \n\"For me it is enough to have the first and the last word, the middle we can discuss everything. \n\"We only want to discuss about very good players, it is discussing on the highest level. \n\"I am not a genius. I don't know more than the rest of the world. \n\"I need the other people to get the perfect information and when we have this we will sign the player or sell a player. \n\"It is really easy to handle this.\" \nKlopp revealed he first began to think about the prospect of being Liverpool manager when he visited Anfield for the first time in a pre-season friendly in 2014. \nAsked about whether that trip had put the idea in his head, he said: \"Yes. Of course. I am not a dreamer in this way but I am a football romantic. \n\"I love the stories, the histories. Anfield is one of the best places in the football world and it was my first time at Anfield and I came in and thought about how it would be [to be manager]. \n\"Now I am here. I am a really lucky guy.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:51:49.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
