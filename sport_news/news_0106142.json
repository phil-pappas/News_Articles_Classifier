Since then, India has won three more medals at the Olympics Games, but none in shotgun events.\nAbhinav Bindra gave India its first individual Olympic gold at the Beijing Games in 2008. It was followed by rifle shooter Gagan Narang's bronze and pistol shooter Vijay Kumar's silver at the London Games 2012. In other words, after Rathore's medal, India has won three individual shooting medals in small bore events, but a podium finish in shotgun is still awaited.\nAs India get ready for the Rio Olympics with seven small bore shooters booking the quota places, only one shotgun shooter - Mairaj Khan in skeet - has qualified so far. It may be too early to reach a conclusion, but the fact that there is only one event left now - the Asian Championships - time is running out like quick sand from the shotgunners.\nNational Rifle Association of India president Raninder Singh, who himself was a shotgun shooter, feels there is no need to panic. \"You can't write them off. It will be too early to do that. The shotgun shooters have been shooting world class scores and I am more than hopeful that they will qualify in the next tournament,\" Singh said.\n\"We had three shotgun shooters each for the Beijing and London Games. This time too, we will have at least three shooters. I am hopeful, our shooters will win quotas there,\" the president said. \"The level of competition has gone very high. It is not easy to keep pace with the world. We have young kids, who need experience.\"\nColonel Lalit Sharma, Commanding Officer at the Indian Army Marksmanship Unit agrees with the NRAI president. \"Indian shooters are performing well, but they are missing out narrowly in winning medals,\" he says.\nSharma is stationed at Mhow, the same centre where once Rathore trained. Post Rathore, the unit has not seen any of their shotgun shooters at the Olympics. But the same unit has been producing small bore shooters, like London silver medallist Vijay Kumar, Jitu Rai, Gurpreet Singh and Chain Singh.\nExcept Vijay, the other shooters mentioned above have already qualified for Rio. The trend shows a shift of focus at the AMU, but the Colonel doesn't agree. \"No, the focus has not shifted. It is just the continued flow of talent that we need to maintain,\" he says. \"It is right to say that as of now, army doesn't have major representation in shotgun. Our shooters are missing out to others in team selections. But we are building a strong team now.\"\nRaninder said: \"According to their training methods, rifle and pistol shooting come more naturally to them than shotgun. So it will be wrong to say that they have shifted focus.\"\nFormer shooter Morad Ali Khan feels shotgun performances can't be judged through Olympic performances alone. He feels it is a process that is more important than winning medals at the Olympics.\n\"It would be wrong to say that shotgun has not seen the rise after the 2004 medal. On the contrary, I feel we have had some of our best shooting performances between 2004 and 2014. We have had shooters like Ronjan Singh Sodhi, who has won back to back World titles. We have had shooters like Manavjit, who has won almost every medal, except the Olympics. In 2012, we saw first woman shotgun shooter, Shagun Chowdhary, getting qualified for the Olympics,\" Khan says.\nSharma said that the 2004 medal was somewhat unexpected. It was a result of Rathore's excellence rather than collated efforts. \"The system has become more robust and inspiring.\"\nRathore, who is now a Member of Parliament from Jaipur (Rural) constituency, takes Sharma's point a little ahead. The retired Army colonel said his Olympic medal should be seen as path laid for the future than a trigger point for medal wins.\n\"The biggest benefit of 2004 is a crop of young shooters that took over the shooting ranges all over the country. Shooters from 12 years old to 23 year olds are now on the cusp of making it big. If they get the right direction and support and the sport is kept clean, it won't be too long that they take over the world,\" said Rathore.\nRaninder said: \"The 2020 Olympics should be our target, as our young shooters would be ready by then.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:55:58.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
