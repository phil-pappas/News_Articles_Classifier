Second-year coach Jimmy Lauzon has implemented a spread offense utilizing two quarterbacks in Jake Stevens, a stronger passer, who was 14-of-20 for 196 yards last week; and Ben Johnson, the better runner. Lauzon said Stevens will start, with Johnson suspended for the first half of the game. RB David Wiedenfeld is another player to watch. “They’ll do everything,” said Portsmouth coach Brian Pafford. “They’ll come out in some funky formations. They’ll come out in some swinging-gate (formations), which most teams only use on extra points.”… Clippers QB Cody Graham has completed 73 percent of his passes for 1,092 yards, 11 TDs and 6 INTs. Christian Peete has caught a team-best 28 passes for 413 yards and 2 TDs. When and where: Friday (7 p.m.) at Winnacunnet High School Team records: Timberlane is 2-2 in Division I; Winnacunnet is 2-2 in Division I Last week: Timberlane lost to Salem, 17-7; Winnacunnet lost to Exeter, 21-20 Last year’s meeting: did not play Preview: How effectively can the Warriors bounce back from a devastating loss? We’ll see Friday, in a game that will make the winner’s road to the playoffs a lot smoother. … After getting overtaken by Salem (26-21) and Exeter in the fourth quarter, the Warriors would like to put themselves in position to win and then close the game out. “Playoff teams, championship teams, do that,” Winnacunnet coach Ron Auffant said. “We have to learn to finish better.”… QB Jason Hughes, RB Tyler Furey and WR Jacob Post are strong weapons for the Owls, but were held largely in check in the loss to Salem. Furey gained 101 yards on 10 carries but Hughes was just 5-of-24 passing. … Mike Lewis (510 yards) and Brian Auffant (429 yards) have churned out yardage consistently for Winnacunnet, while sophomore QB Patrick MacDougall was 8-of-15 for 115 yards against Exeter, with Logan Keene one of his favorite targets. When and where: Friday (7 p.m.) at Salem High School Team records: Exeter is 4-0 in Division I; Salem is 3-1 in Division I Last week: Exeter beat Winnacunnet, 21-20; Salem beat Timberlane, 17-7 Last year’s meeting: did not play Preview: The Blue Hawks try to make it 3-for-3 against the stiff South Conference but it won’t be easy. An offense that has looked uneven at times and is averaging 24.5 points a game will face a stout Salem defense that’s giving up just 15.5 points. … RBs Charles Sibanda and James LeBlond are two big offensive options for the Blue Devils. Sibanda rushed for 118 yards and a touchdown in the win over Timberlane. … QB Kyle Ball continues to be the Blue Hawks’ best ground option, leading the team with 326 yards on 53 carries (6.2 average). Jackson Allen added 84 yards on 11 carries last week. … This should be a good test for Exeter against a team that can match it in size and toughness. The Blue Devils were the unlucky 7-2 team that got left out of last year’s Division I playoffs and would take a big step securing their spot in this year’s tournament with a home win Friday. GORHAM AT MARSHWOOD When and where: Friday (7 p.m.) at Marshwood High School Team records: Gorham is 0-4 in Class B South; Marshwood is 3-1 in Class B South Last week: Gorham lost to Greely, 41-8; Marshwood beat Leavitt, 29-28 Last year’s meeting: Marshwood won, 60-0 Preview: Tough to see the Hawks having any trouble with this one, even without starting QB Jack Spear, who dislocated his shoulder during the opening drive of last week’s win and is expected to be out for at least two weeks. Cole McDaniel, a running threat, will make his first career start under center. “I think he’s similar to (2013-14 quarterback) Luc Blanchette in a lot of ways,” said Marshwood coach Alex Rotsko. “The one thing he lacks is experience.”… Expect a good-sized workload for sophomore RB Kyle Glidden, the understudy to senior standout Zach Doyon. “He has a very good understanding of the offense and what we’re trying to do,” said Rotsko. “He’s going to get better and better every week.”… Gorham has been outscored 166-24 in its four games. It has eight starters back from last year’s 1-7 team that got routed by the Hawks, who also won 71-6 in 2013. BIDDEFORD AT YORK When and where: Friday (7 p.m.) at York High School Team records: Biddeford is 2-2 in Class B South; York is 1-3 in Class B South Last week: Biddeford beat Westbrook, 28-13; York lost to Kennebunk, 42-14 Last year’s meeting: did not play Preview: The Wildcats have no gimmes on their remaining schedule, so a win against Biddeford would go a long way toward securing a playoff spot. Eight of 12 teams qualify. … York’s defense will be tasked with slowing down FB Lucas Rhoy, who amassed 237 yards on 30 carries last week running mostly off-tackle. It will also need to be aware of QB Joey Curit, another running threat, in the option offense. “They’re a lot like Kennebunk,” York coach Randy Small said. “They run the option right at you and if you’re not disciplined, it’s going to be a long night.”… Most of the positives the Wildcats took away from last week came in the first 2½ quarters, before Kennebunk closed the game with five straight late touchdowns. Cullen McCarty ran for 165 yards on 21 carries and two TDs, but all but 7 of those yards were in the first half. When and where: Saturday (3:15 p.m.) at Epping High School Team records: Campbell is 1-3 in Division III; Epping-Newmarket is 1-3 in Division III Last week: Campbell lost to Winnisquam, 35-21; Epping-Newmarket lost to Bow, 46-6 Last year’s meeting: Campbell won, 29-6 Preview: After getting outclassed by Bow last week, the Blue Devils will face a team from their own weight class in Campbell, whose defense has struggled through four games, allowing an average of 39.8 points. … At 6-foot-1, senior QB Hunter Hannon has a good pocket presence for the Cougars. WR Conor Gannon is his top target. … For Epping, the biggest issues have been on the offensive side of the ball. Operating a spread offense for the first time, the Blue Devils have been hurt by inconsistency, injuries and — last week — a lack of pass protection that had QB Jake Bisaillon scrambling. “Our offense is a work in progress,” said Epping coach Justin Leonard. “(Jake) can throw the football … he just needs time.”… The winner of this game can insert its name back in the South Conference playoff race, but the loser will be all but eliminated. When and where: Saturday (6 p.m.) at Exeter High School Team records: Laconia is 2-2 in Division II; St. Thomas is 4-0 in Division II Last week: Laconia beat Hanover, 35-7; St. Thomas beat Plymouth, 43-7 Last year’s meeting: Laconia won, 35-28 Preview: The Saints have passed every test, home and away, with flying colors. Now the veterans get a make-up exam against Laconia, which handed them their only regular-season loss a year ago. … The Sachems have a new QB in Riley Roy but much of the rest of the cast is the same, with RB Kyle Chiasson and WR Jacob Filgate their top weapons. Chiasson ran for 129 yards and a score on 14 carries last week. … Laconia went 4-4 last year, missing the playoffs for the third year in a row. … Senior QB Stephen Hedberg hasn’t been the only shining star for the Saints, who’ve gotten great play from lines led by seniors Matt Elliott, Jay Gallipo and Will Micali. The offense is averaging 48 points a game. … The Sachems have piled up 99 points in their last two games, both wins, but against teams with a combined record of 1-5. … To buy more time for SATs, the game was moved to William Ball Stadium, where it will kick-off under the lights at 6 p.m. — Capsules compiled by Mike Zhe seacoastonline.com Posted Oct. 1, 2015 at 11:55 PM Updated at 11:59 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:52:56.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
