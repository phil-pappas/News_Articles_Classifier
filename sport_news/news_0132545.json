The Giants wide receiver, who put up ridiculous numbers in 2014, is having a \"down\" year, according to some people.\n\"Some people\" includes Jets cornerback Antonio Cromartie , who called ODB \"a one-year wonder\" on Friday during an appearance on SportsNation . The latest from SportsLine Pete's Best Bets: Bills won't stop Mariota \"Right now he's a one-year wonder,\" Cromartie said to the howl of the crowd. \"It's just one year. I need to see it on an every-game basis. Not him getting penalties ... on sucker-punching somebody. I think it's all about how you carry yourself throughout your whole entire career.\"\nCro has a point here: Odell has only played one year . But come on. ODB is pretty clearly a generational talent. Maybe fame could derail him, but he's putting up good stats in 2015 too.\nBeckham's averaging more than 75 yards per game this season and he's got a pair of touchdowns. His average is dragged down by the Giants thumping the Bills in Week 4. It might get dragged down by Odell and Co. trashing the 49ers on Sunday night too. \nCromatie at least acknowledged ODB is having the best 16-game stretch of anyone's career.\n\"Has he had a productive years in 16 games? Yes. I give him the utmost for that. He's had the most production out of any receiver I've seen in 16 games I've seen since Randy Moss,\" Cromartie said. \"But you've got to do it week in and week out and depend on that person no matter if you're getting double- or triple-teamed.\"\nIt's possible Cromartie ends up being right and Beckham ends up being an Icarusian lesson for having too much talent in your first year. Or maybe he deals with injuries throughout his career.\nMore than likely he's going to continue putting up silly statistics for the next decade or so and this headline-grabbing line from the Jets cornerback is going to go down as just another silly statement.\nThe best part about all of this? The Jets are playing the Giants this year! That noise you just heard was Beckham's Sharpie circling Dec. 6 on his calendar. Cro kind of knocked ODB.
