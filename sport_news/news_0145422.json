Asa Hutchinson on a 5-mile bicycle ride at Delta Heritage Trail State Park near Helena-West Helena on Sunday, Oct. 11, the state Department of Parks and Tourism said today, Thursday, Oct. 8. The Bicycle with the Governor event will begin at 1:30 p.m. at the visitor center at 5539 U.S. 49 in Barton, six miles west of Helena-West Helena. Cyclists will travel on a five-mile loop and end the ride back at the visitor center. Bring your own bicycle and helmet. The compacted, crushed rock trail leads through a shaded canopy of native hardwoods, alongside agricultural fields and across streams. The surface is good for hybrid, cruiser or mountain bikes, but narrow-tired road bikes are not recommended. The event is free, but donations to support the Boys and Girls Club of Phillips County will be accepted. The Delta Heritage Trail is being built in phases along the former Union Pacific Railroad right-of-way. The first 21 miles of the trail have been completed and offer opportunities for wildlife viewing and birding, the department said. When completed, the trail will be 84.5 miles long and include views from bridges that span the Arkansas River and White River. \nThe northern section that is completed has trailheads at Helena junction near Lexa, Walnut Corner at the U.S. 49 overpass, Lick Creek (Highway 85 just south of Barton), Lake View and Elaine. \nUnion Pacific Corp. donated its 73-mile right-of-way in 1992. This was the historic route of the Delta Eagle , Missouri Pacific’s passenger train that steamed along “ The Route of the Eagles .” \nThis donation created a rail-to-trail conversion of national significance, Arkansas State Parks Division says. The trail agreement for this long-distance hiking/bicycling trail was made possible by railbanking provisions of the National Trails System Act. \nRailbanking allows railroads to transfer all rights inherent in a rail corridor to a public agency sponsor to create a condition of public use. \nFor more information, contact: Josh Glenn, park superintendent, Delta Heritage Trail State Park; phone: 870-572-2352; e-mail: Joshua.Glenn@Arkansas.gov or visit www.ArkansasStateParks.com/DeltaHeritageTrail .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:44:11.515+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
