The Steelers unsurprisingly leaned on their running game and a bunch of short passes, with Bell highly active in both regards. The Steelers didn't have a pass play longer than 18 yards all night, and Bell's spectacular running was the only thing that kept the ball moving. Bell had at least three highlight-worthy runs, including an 11-yard touchdown in the second quarter that required him to cut all the way back across the field. He nearly turned another busted play into a 69-yard, walk-off touchdown in overtime, but Ravens safety Will Hill made a fantastic tackle to stop Bell for a 22-yard gain. The absence of Ben Roethlisberger (knee) is clearly devastating for the Pittsburgh offense, but Bell could actually benefit from increased volume with Mike Vick under center. The Steelers' Week 5 opponent, San Diego, has surrendered 136 rushing yards per game and 4.9 yards per carry through the first three weeks of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:03:19.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
