Sophomore tailback Phillip Lindsay, who is a member of the team's 12-player leadership council, called a players-only meeting Sunday. Several players said the tone of the meeting was positive, and served as a forum for them to get the team to recharge its self-belief. \n\"It's a tough loss, but we kind of talked amongst one another to get going on the right path,\" tailback Christian Powell said. \"It's kind of uplifting to see everybody come together like that.\" Advertisement \nMacIntyre and several players said the team has responded with two good practices to start this week, and they have no issues finding a competitive fire for practice. \n\"It's up to us to go out there and execute,\" quarterback Sefo Liufau said. \"I think ultimately we came out (of the meeting) with a better feeling and a better understanding of what needs to be done.\" \nA collection of miscues, including two turnovers and a blocked punt, contributed to the loss to Arizona State. The Buffs know they have to eliminate those mistakes, but there's only one way to completely change the mood in their locker room. \n\"Ultimately a win is the only thing that will satisfy us right now,\" Liufau said. \"We don't care about coming close. We just want to win; that's our main goal.\" \nThe Buffs having lost 13 consecutive Pac-12 Conference games, dating to Nov. 16, 2013, Powell said the back-to-back losses to open conference play this season could have turned things sour for the Buffs. \n\"Or you can find ways to get better and stay positive,\" he said. \"Everybody came in (this week) focused, finding ways to get positive in order to improve.\" \nCU's motivation this week is rooted in the fact that its goals are still in front of the Buffs. While every game carries some weight to it, the Buffs also know this is a pivotal week in their season. \n\"It's going to be huge for us if we want to accomplish our goals,\" receiver Nelson Spruce said. \nContact staff writer Brian Howell at howellb@dailycamera.com or twitter.com/BrianHowell33 .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:51:03.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
