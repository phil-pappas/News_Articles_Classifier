It's the first time the best-of-five series has gone the distance since 2009. \nThe 36-year-old Catchings has already said she will retire after next season. The 33-year-old Whalen has been slowed by leg injuries this season and may not have many more left. \nWhalen is chasing her third title in the last five years. Catchings and the Fever are looking for their second.
