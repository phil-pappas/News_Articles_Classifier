It was true before he got to the Jets , it was true with the way he's played this season, and it was true again Sunday, when the Jets beat Washington , 34-20, at MetLife Stadium to run their record to 4-1 heading into Sunday's Big Game at the hated Patriots .\nBut, in the interest of fairness, I'm coming right out and saying it: Fitzpatrick turned in his finest performance of the season against Washington.\nLet's start with the passing numbers: 19 of 26 passing, 253 yards, two touchdowns, one interception, a quarterback rating of 113.1, a Total QBR of 99.0. Let's add in the rushing totals: four rushes for 31 yards and a touchdown, including an 18-yard dash up the middle for a TD that gave the Jets a 20-13 lead in the third quarter. They never looked back.\nThe Jets had offensive balance—253 passing yards, 221 rushing yards—and all the pieces seemed to fit together. Those pieces are running back Chris Ivory (196 yards from scrimmage, including 146 on the ground) and wideouts Brandon Marshall (fourth-straight 100-yard receiving game, the first Jet since Don Maynard in 1968 to do that) and Eric Decker (four catches, 59 yards, one touchdown).\nBut Fitzparick also wasn't sacked —his sack rate is now down to 1.17 percent, best in the league. The Jets aren't explosive with him, but they are efficient. Fitzpatrick's Total QBR for the season is 76.6, which is fifth-best in the NFL. Seriously.\nPLUS: Tony Dungy likes what he sees: 'This Jets team is different' What Fitzpatrick did well: Other than when he tried to force a throw to Marshall's back shoulder in the second quarter, resulting in an interception after Marshall tipped it into the hands of cornerback Bashaud Breeland, Fitzpatrick didn't force anything. He was also largely accurate; he threw low for Marshall in the third quarter, but Marshall bailed him out by reaching down and turning to take the throw for an unlikely 35-yard touchdown. But Fitzpatrick was especially good when Washington pressure him: 8-for-11 for 117 yards and two touchdowns when pressured, according to Pro Football Focus. Fitzpatrick also got rid of the ball quickly—an average of 2.34 seconds, per Pro Football Focus. Among NFL starters on Sunday, only the Titans' Marcus Mariota and the Bengals' Andy Dalton delivered throws faster. And Fitzpatrick can run! He now has 65 rushing yards on 13 carries in his last two games.\nWhat Fitzpatrick didn't do well: There was the interception and the underthrown ball Marshall transformed into a touchdown, as mentioned above. But Fitzpatrick also never bothered to throw the ball downfield much; he had no throws of 20 yards or more, and he was just 4 of 7 with a touchdown and an interception on throws from 10 to 19 yards. But those four completions accounted for 101 of his 253 passing yards. Sixteen of his 26 throws went to Marshall and Decker. The Jets aren't even pretending to throw to their tight ends anymore; just one target total for Kellen Davis and Jeff Cumberland. But you know what? It's working.\nGrade: B+\nDom Cosentino may be reached at dcosentino@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @domcosentino .
