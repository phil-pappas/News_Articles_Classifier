The Utes were picked to finish third behind Arizona and California.\n“Not much has ever changed,” said Krystkowiak, who explained that such predictions have never meant anything to him. “You’re never as good as you think you are and you’re never as bad as you think you are.”\nSenior guard Brandon Taylor, who also represented the Utes at Thursday’s conference media day at the Pac-12 Networks studios, didn’t put much stock in the preseason poll, either.\n“You don’t really pay attention to those. It’s almost like how can you really sit here and make a prediction? That’s what it’s going to be, you know?” Taylor said. “But it is what it is. We’ve never been the type of team to even pay attention. I mean it’s cool to be in the top three or four in what people’s opinions are, but we really don’t care what someone’s opinion is — no disrespect to anybody. It’s just we’re not too into what people think or anything like that.”\nUtah was among five teams that picked up first-place votes. The Utes, who are coming off a 26-9 season and a Sweet 16 appearance, were the top choice of seven of the 36 voters. Arizona and California received 18 and nine, respectively. Oregon and UCLA each had a single vote.\nThe Ducks and Bruins were picked fourth and fifth overall in the poll and were followed in order by Oregon State, Colorado, Arizona State, Stanford, USC, Washington and Washington State.\nAlthough Taylor downplayed the significance of the poll, he didn’t dismiss the big picture.\n“You’re going to respect us, though. You’re going to respect us. That’s for sure,” he said. “You’re going to respect us and we’re going to go out there and make you respect us.”\n\nPAYTON’S PLACE: Before starring at Oregon State, guard Gary Payton II excelled at Salt Lake Community College.\n“I give all the credit to Salt Lake and coach Todd Phillips and coach Paul Marble up there,” Payton said. “They really taught me a lot about the game.”\nPayton added that the speed and the way they play at SLCC really made his transition to the Pac-12 easier. As for how he didn’t land at Utah, Payton said it was more about “finding the right spot” for himself.\nAnd that, as it turned out, is following in his father’s footsteps with the Beavers in Corvallis.\nSPECIAL EXPERIENCE: Taylor enjoyed being Utah’s player representative at Pac-12 Media Day.\n“It’s humbling. Especially just coming from where I come from,” Taylor said. “Like I’ve never been a part of anything like this and it’s special. I feel special.”\nEmail: dirk@desnews.com \nTwitter: @DirkFacer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:42:07.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
