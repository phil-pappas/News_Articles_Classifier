Los Angeles (83-76) is a game behind the Astros and tied with Minnesota, which beat Cleveland 4-2. \nHolland (4-3) allowed three hits and three runs in 6 1-3 innings for his first win since Sept. 5.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:44:15.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
