By Jocelyn Sheets Newton Daily News \nKNOXVILLE — Three area boys and one girl placed in the top 20 at Tuesday’s Knoxville Invitational varsity cross country races. Newton, Lynnville-Sully and Prairie City-Monroe competed in the Knoxville meet which featured 12 full teams in the girls’ division and 16 in the boys’ division. \nNewton High’s Rachel Rhoads posted the top finish among all area runners. Rhoads powered around the 5K course in 20 minutes, 37.5 seconds for ninth place. \nNewton’s Jack Callaghan held off PCM’s Chris Ellens to claim 12th in the boys’ varsity 5K race. Callaghan ran a personal-best 17:29.6 seconds and Ellen was 13th in 17:30.2. Lynnville-Sully’s Canyon Kuhlmann was the top Class 1A finisher in the race, taking 17th in 17:36. \nAnkeny Centennial swept the varsity team titles as both the girls and boys scored 27 points. In the girls’ race, Ankeny Centennial had four of top five finishers led by Taylor Brown in 19:34.5.

Rachel had a great race tonight. She ran with some good 4A runners and held off a slew of Pella girls.” \nCaelyn Brilley finished just out of the top 20, placing 21st in 21:30.3 as Newton’s No. 2 runner. Tessa Keeton ran 33rd in 22:37.7 followed by Abbie Barr in 38th at 22:14.73 and Ellie Horn in 56th in 24:12.3. \n“Caelyn and Abbie really came on strong. They raced well and should gain more confidence heading into the last part of the season,” Tipton said. “Tessa had another solid race tonight; she was fighting a cold and still ran close to her best time. Ellie continues to run well and will be tough in this back half of the season.” \nJayci Vos was 25th to lead the PCM Mustang girls, running the race in 22:03.

The good competition combined with cooler temperatures than what we’ve had helped everyone to season best times,” Lynnville-Sully head coach Darin Arkema said of the Hawk girls and boys. “I think the team was excited to see their times and get some assurance that they are improving and the hard work is paying off.” \nLynnville-Sully’s top girl finisher was Ida Byggeth in 31st with a time of 22:27 followed by Marissa Vos in 32nd in 22:31.
