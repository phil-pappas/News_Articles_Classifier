We’ll need to be better (tonight).\" \nThe Wheat Kings visit Kennewick, Wash., tonight to face the Tri-City Americans, who currently sit second in the U.S. Division at 4-5-1-0. They lost 3-2 on Wednesday to the division-leading Seattle Thunderbirds. \nThe lone Manitoban on the Americans’ roster is 17-year-old forward Morgan Geekie of Strathclair. \nThe Americans are led by centre Parker Bowles (four goals, eight assists in 10 games), right-winger Beau McCue (four goals and six assists in 10 games) and defenceman Parker Wotherspoon (two goals and eight assists in 10 games). \nIn goal, Evan Sarthou has started nine of the team’s 10 games, posting a 3.70 goals-against average and an .872 save percentage. \nIn their sole meeting last season, Tri-City beat Brandon 4-3 in overtime at Westman Place, a game in which Bowles had three assists. \nOn Wednesday, the Wheat Kings won their first shootout since Nov. 15, 2014, when Rihards Bukarts scored the team’s first shootout goal in eight chances this season and goaltender Jordan Papirny shut the door on the Chiefs at Spokane Veterans Memorial Arena. \nBrandon (7-1-0-2) briefly trailed 3-1 late in the second period, but John Quenneville scored his sixth of the season 46 seconds after the third Spokane goal to pull the Wheat Kings back within one. \nDefenceman Ivan Provorov tied the game with a slapshot from the point that got through a screen by Jayce Hawryluk and past Chiefs starter Tyson Verhelst, a Brandon native, at 11:34 of the third period. \nNolan Patrick also scored for Brandon. \nPapirny made 21 saves for the Wheat Kings, while Verhelst made 34 stops for the Chiefs. \nA curious part of the evening was the 45-minute second intermission after the ice resurfacing machine broke down. \n\"It was the same for both teams,\" McCrimmon said. \"It looked like we were maybe going to have play without resurfacing the ice, which I think would have not been good for us. At least we got it flooded. There’s nothing you can do about it, it’s just one of those things. I thought we had a real good start to the third period.\" \nWith the win, the Wheat Kings have now earned at least a point in all but one of their 10 games this season. \n» pbergson@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:38:46.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
