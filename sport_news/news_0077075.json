Turkey only managed two draws against Latvia but beat Kazakhstan twice. \nHungary finished with 15 points against non-sixth-placed teams, one less than Turkey on 16. \nCroatia also qualified for Euro 2016 by winning 1-0 at Malta in Group H. \nIvan Perisic's 25th-minute goal was enough for Croatia to qualify as runners-up in Group H despite being deducted a point for a racist incident last year. \nPerisic got behind a loose ball inside the Malta area and hit a powerful right-footed effort to beat goalkeeper Andrew Hogg. \nNorway will settle for a playoff spot after seeing a second-half lead disappear in a 2-1 defeat to Italy, who won Group H. \nA win would have seen Norway qualify instead of Croatia, and Alexander Tettey had given his side the lead in the 23rd minute with a 20-yard left-footed shot towards the right corner that beat Italy goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. \nBut Italy struck back through Alessandro Florenzi in the 73rd minute. Sebastian Giovinco's cross from the left saw Haitam Aleesami chest the ball back to keeper Orjan Nyland, only for Florenzi to nip in and strike the ball into the back of the net. \nGraziano Pelle scored the winner for the Azzurri eight minutes from time as he struck a left-footed volley past a helpless Nyland. \n\"They were much better than us in the 90 minutes and they of course deserved to win,\" Norway coach Per-Mathias Hogmo said. \nBosnia-Herzegovina secured a playoff spot from Group B with a 3-2 win at Cyprus. \nBosnia took the lead after 12 minutes when midfielder Haris Medunjanin curled into the bottom corner from the edge of the penalty area. \nCyprus drew level in the 32nd minute when Constantinos Charalambidis tapped home after goalkeeper Asmir Begovic could only parry Georgios Efrem's shot and went ahead nine minutes later when Nestoras Mitidis turned in Jason Demetriou's low cross. \nMedunjanin scored his second to draw Bosnia level shortly before half-time and Milan Djuric, seven minutes after coming on as a second-half substitute, earned all three points for the visitors when he headed home at the back post. \nDries Mertens, Kevin de Bruyne and Eden Hazard scored as Belgium eliminated Israel's slim hopes with a 3-1 win. \nBelgium went in front after the hour when De Bruyne set up Mertens in the box and his right-footed shot from 12 yards towards the far post beat Israel goalkeeper Ofir Marciano. \nDe Bruyne made it 2-0 with a powerful free kick which beat Marciano, who conceded again when Mertens set up Hazard in the box and the Chelsea star's right-footed shot found the net. \nIsrael got their goal when Hemed headed Zahavi's cross past Mignolet. \nThe win means Belgium will take over as the No. 1 nation in the FIFA World Ranking next month. \nWales, who qualified on Saturday, received goals from stars Aaron Ramsey and Gareth Bale to defeat Andorra 2-0. \nFive minutes after half-time, Bale worked himself into space down the right to deliver a cross towards the unmarked Ashley Williams and, when goalkeeper Ferran Pol pushed his header out, the ball fell kindly to Ramsey, who finished from close range with his weaker left foot. \nBale's seventh goal of this Euro 2016 campaign came four minutes from time when Ben Davies crossed and his shot had enough power to beat Pol. \nBulgaria defeated Azerbaijan 2-0, Mihail Aleksandrov and Dimitar Rangelov scoring in a meaningless game in Group H. \nAleksandrov opened the scoring in the 20th minute when he headed Ivelin Popov's outswinging corner from the right low into the net. \nAnd Rangelov sealed his side's third win of the campaign with a 56th-minute header, meeting Zhivko Milanov's right-wing cross. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
