Bratton cited several perceived irregularities.\nJudge Matt Johnson, who originally sentenced Ukwuachu to 180 days in jail and 10 years probation, has yet to set a date for a hearing on the motion.\nShould Johnson grant a new trial, Ukwuachu could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty.\nOn Twitter:\n @bhorn55", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/bhorn55"], "published": "2015-09-29T05:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:35:00.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
