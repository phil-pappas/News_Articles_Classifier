The Pacers’ reluctance to fully bend in the 2014 first-round series against the small-ball Atlanta Hawks nearly sent them packing from the playoffs. But last season, injuries introduced survival mode, and head coach Frank Vogel had to adapt with multiple starting lineups. \nNow, the Pacers want to show more flexibility — not because they have to, but because they can. \nWhen the Pacers face the divisional rival Chicago Bulls on Tuesday night, they will start the game with a new wrinkle: a big lineup consisting of Paul George back at his natural wing position. 7 things to know about the 2015-16 Pacers schedule \n“I think we’re set up for either-or, big or small lineup,” George said after Monday’s practice. “We have yet to start the game with a big lineup. So, we can see how that works out.” \nSuch a muted response from George is surprising, considering he spent the days before training camp, and even early into preseason, straddling a line of welcoming the Pacers’ new style of a spread offense that features him as a stretch-4 and pining for the good old days of playing small forward. After a game last week when reporters relayed Vogel’s plan to start big against teams loaded with size, George responded that was “music to my ears.” And that sweet harmony will play every time the Pacers face a team like the Bulls. \nOn Oct. 14, for the first time in the preseason, Chicago trotted out a starting lineup with 6-foot-11 center Joakim Noah and 7-0 power forward Pau Gasol. It would have been an interesting litmus test for the Pacers to continue with the spread lineup – George Hill, Monta Ellis, C.J. Miles and George at the four with Ian Mahinmi as the lone big — and observe just how dynamic they can be against a bigger frontline. However, the Pacers have options with rotational bigs 6-9 Lavoy Allen, 6-11 Myles Turner and 6-10 Jordan Hill, who will miss Tuesday’s game with a sore back. With same core, Chicago Bulls hope new voice is difference \nSo with size, why not be flexible and use it? \n“Starting big,” Vogel said about the Tuesday lineup of Hill, Ellis, George, Allen and Mahinmi. “I want to see what that rotation looks like.” \nNow, the Pacers only need the Bulls to comply with their experiment and run their big lineup as well. \n“Feel free to put that in headlines, because I want the Bulls to start big,” Vogel joked with reporters. “I may call them and tell them that.” Video | Pacers Fan Jam highlights \nDON’T FORGET ABOUT CHRISTMAS \nThe rookie show during the Pacers FanJam can be a peek into the personality of the newest players. Each year, the rookies walk to center court in front of thousands of fans and rap, sing and basically show an aversion to rhythm as snickering veterans stand by. So on Sunday when Myles Turner closed his eyes and sang falsetto to “Can’t Feel My Face,” and Joe Young asked for a wardrobe change to transform into a 6-2 Justin Bieber of sorts, the Pacers’ two most recognizable rookies stole the show. \nRakeem Christmas also performed, grooving to the song “Hit The Quan.” Or in his words, “tried.” Though Christmas showed a few dance moves, he wanted no part of the microphone he was forced to hold and often looked over to his teammates and away from the crowd. \n“I’m fine playing basketball in front of people,” Christmas explained Monday, “but to go out there and do something like that, it’s not me.” \nChristmas’ performance, much like his preseason, was overshadowed by his two rookie peers. While Turner and Young are expected to play on the second unit, Christmas, a 6-9 power forward the Pacers traded for in July, will not play such a pivotal role early for the Pacers. Christmas might even be a candidate to shuffle in and out of Fort Wayne this season. Still, don’t overlook Christmas — at least according to Paul George. \nThough on Sunday George teasingly led the fans in boos to jeer Christmas off the court, he supports the rookie who has displayed upside. \n“He’s kinda been the third man out, but he should get just as much credit as Myles and Joe,” George said. “He’s been one of our hardest workers. He’s just like Myles and Joe, they learn so quick. Rakeem’s been the same. \n“His only downfall is we have so many bigs and guys in his position right now, he’s got to wait his turn, but he’s looked great,” George said. “He has his own uniqueness to him. He’s a little quicker and when we’re playing small, he can be a great addition to us playing even faster.” \nChristmas ended the Monday scrimmage by demonstrating his explosiveness. In the half court set ‘Pistol,’ Christmas set a screen and rolled to the rim, finishing with a tomahawk dunk. \n“Those are the plays (Vogel) wants me to start doing,” Christmas said. “Coach wants me to go out there and just run. I’m a fast big, and he just wants me to outrun the bigs. Crash the boards, get rebounds and set good screens for my teammates, and that’s what I’m trying to do.” \nCall Star reporter Candace Buckner at (317) 444-6121.
