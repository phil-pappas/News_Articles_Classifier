(AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh) Sponsored Links The Associated Press CHICAGO â€” \nKris Bryant and Jorge Soler each hit two-run drives and the Chicago Cubs connected for a postseason franchise-record six homers in an 8-6 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 3 of the NL Division Series on Monday. \nKyle Schwarber, Anthony Rizzo, Starlin Castro and Dexter Fowler also homered, powering Jake Arrieta to another win despite a rare off night for the bearded ace. The Cubs' previous record for most homers in a playoff game was five in the opener of the 1984 NL Championship Series against San Diego. \nA third straight win for Chicago on Tuesday afternoon, and the once woebegone franchise will advance to the NLCS for the first time in 12 years. The Cardinals, who led the majors with 100 wins this season, have won at least one playoff series in each of the last four years. \nJason Heyward and Stephen Piscotty homered for St. Louis, and Jhonny Peralta had a run-scoring double.
