PredictionMachine 22 hrs ago Will the Lions go 0-16?\nAdChoices Detroit is now 0-5 after a 42-17 drubbing by Arizona. Considering the history of the franchise, which suffered the indignity of an 0-16 season in 2008, another winless campaign seems possible.\nWill the Lions go winless?\nIt is highly improbable that Detroit goes 0-16 again. The Lions are already three point favorites at home against the Chicago Bears next week and have a 58.7 percent chance to win in Week 6.\nOver the final eleven games, Detroit is the projected favorites in four games (vs. Bears, vs. Raiders, at Saints and vs. 49ers).\nThe chance that Detroit goes winless is 0.09 percent.\nChance the Lions Lose\nOpponent Chance of Losing vs. Bears 41.3% vs. Vikings 54.9% at Chiefs 61.8% at Packers 76.4% vs. Raiders 45.4% vs. Eagles 51.3% vs. Packers 69.2% at Rams 60.8% at Saints 48.5% vs. 49ers 35.0% at Bears 50.0%\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.predictionmachine.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:47:58.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
