Oregon's 318 rushing yards per game rank sixth-most in the FBS and Freeman's 32 rushes for 10-plus yards are the best of any back. Backup Taj Griffin, the true freshman, has made UO coaches look like geniuses by increasing his role the past two games, as he's gained 206 yards on 22 carries. Yet UW has reloaded despite the losses of NFL draft picks Hau'oli Kikaha and Danny Shelton along its defensive line and is holding opponents to a Pac-12-best 121.6 yards each outing. Buck linebacker Travis Feeney earned Pac-12 player of the week honors after seven tackles, 3.5 for loss, against USC. The secondary is patrolled by onetime UO commit Budda Baker, who has recovered from an ankle injury. Keeping the secondary honest will require a passing game with a pulse, however. Only one Ducks receiver has a 100-yard game this season, Bralon Addison's 138 against Michigan State, which was also the last time UO threw deep with regularity. UO has been coy about the availability of quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. and receiver Darren Carrington, but this could be the weekend UO integrates both back into the offense. If they play, Oregon could win in a runaway. If Adams doesn't, an upset could be brewing.\n The Official Visit Podcast: Starting Vernon Adams? In this week's edition of The Official Visit podcast, Tyson Alger and Andrew Greif discuss whether or not Vernon Adams Jr. should play this week against Washington.\nUO defense vs. Washington offense: Receiver and safety Charles Nelson is projected to play two ways for the second straight week, after his 12 tackles against Washington State led UO. At 5-foot-8 and 170 pounds he doesn't cut the typical profile of a long, tall safety such as 6-3 Tyree Robinson, but his speed to the ball was evident, though he did miss a touchdown-saving tackle against the Cougars. Nelson is listed as a co-starter alongside Reggie Daniels on the latest depth chart, after Daniels -- who played the most snaps of any UO defender in 2014 -- did not start against Utah and did not play against WSU for undisclosed reasons. After allowing 500-plus passing yards to the Cougars, Oregon now prepares for a true freshman quarterback in Jake Browning who leads one of the country's least-prolific passing attacks. Browning is only the second modern UW quarterback to start as a true freshman, joining Marques Tuiasosopo against Oregon in 1997, and ranks 73rd nationally in passing efficiency. Jaydon Mickens, a 5-foot-11 senior receiver, is third all-time in career UW receptions and has acted as a safety valve for Browning. The key for Oregon's front seven, which recorded a season-high seven sacks and 13 tackles for loss last week, is containing freshman running back Myles Gaskin. Gaskin rushed for 134 yards and a touchdown against USC.\nDid you know: Oregon has used the same starting offensive line for three consecutive games and five of its six this season. It took UO until the eighth game of its injury plagued 2014 season to field the same starting lineup three straight games.\nIndividual Matchup to Watch: Washington left tackle Trey Adams vs. Oregon defensive end DeForest Buckner. Adams is the first true freshman to start at left tackle in Washington history, and out of 306 tackles across the FBS is ranked No. 280 by PFF College. He won't often block Buckner alone but should receive the brunt of his pressure. Buckner is on track to become a first-round NFL draft choice this spring, and is the country's highest-rated interior defender, according to PFF College.\nMark Helfrich previews Oregon at Washington At his Tuesday press conference Helfrich talked about playing at Washington on Saturday.\nKey Stat: Oregon hasn't lost consecutive games in the same season since November 2007 and hasn't lost to Washington in 11 games.\nThey Said It: \"Hopefully we can make it a rivalry. Because it hasn't been for the last decade,\" Jimmy Lake, Washington defensive backs coach.\nPrediction: Washington 31, Oregon 28\n-- Andrew Greif\nagreif@oregonian.com\n@andrewgreif", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:13:51.920+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
