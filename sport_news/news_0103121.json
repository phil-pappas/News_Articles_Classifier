Berman noted that Olmeda had been commended for his sharpshooting skills before being honorably discharged from the military.\nThe judge said a stiff sentence was necessary to deter Olmeda and others from using weapons illegally.\nBefore he was sentenced, Olmeda complained that prosecutors tried to use against him a state court case in which he's charged with shooting at the officers, even though he still awaits trial.\nOlmeda was arrested days after the December 2011 shooting in Queens.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:49:10.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
