This year, she will test how the moon phases affect people’s moods and actions. Dovin’s softball games and playoffs are at the same time as PJAS states and regionals. She said the two conflicted last year, but she was still able to participate in both. \n“Last year it did come down to it and what had happened was my mom came down to Penn State and she picked me up as soon as I presented,” Dovin said. “So I left Penn State a day and a half early and I had to go home and play.” \n— CARMINE GERRITY-GEMEI \nsports@timesshamrock.com \nDunmore \nThe varsity golf team finished with a 10-4 record and reached the Small School Division semifinals. Senior members of the team are: Joseph Weber, Paul Scalese, Tommy Dunda, P.J. Taylor and Colin Sohns. Sophomores Dominic DiPietro, Amanda Lucas and Christopher Murray joined Weber in the districts individual tournament. \n— HERB SMITH \nhsmith@timesshamrock.com \nElk Lake \nThe boys varsity soccer team started the season with three one-goal losses against Montrose, Lakeland and Mountain View, which have a combined record of 23-3-1. But the team has rebounded with six straight victories. One of the senior members of the team is Bailey Newhart. \n“The Lakeland game might have been the toughest loss,” Newhart said. “We were in that game. We lost to Montrose on a penalty kick. But now we’re just looking to win our last two games and go on in districts.” \nThe Warriors have outscored their opponents 30-4 during the six-game winning streak. \n“We are a lot more confident now that we’re scoring and winning,” Newhart said. “The defense is starting to step up; we’re not allowing many goals. We are pretty confident right now.” \n— HERB SMITH \nForest City \nIan Bailey puts in a lot of work to perfect his passion — soccer. \nBesides playing in the fall, the sophomore is also a member of Forest City’s indoor league team with games played at Riverfront. He started on the high school team as a freshman and earned his Letterman’s certificate. \n“Soccer is my favorite sport because it allows me to create close bonds with my teammates,” Bailey said. “It is also a quick reacting sport. I always need to pay attention and be on my toes when the ball comes my way.” \nHe also participates in track and field, competing in the 100m, 200m, 4x100m and long jump. \nWhen he isn’t on the field or track, Bailey serves as a Life Scout for the Boy Scouts of America. He also serves as a member of student council, Future Business Leaders of America, the National Honor Society and the ski club. \n— JOE BARESS \njbaress@timesshamrock.com \nHonesdale \nSenior Janie Murphy played many sports growing up, but her favorite was field hockey. She started to play the sport in second grade at the Wayne County Commissioners Camp during the summer. Beginning in seventh grade, she played on the school’s team and had hopes of playing the sport in college. \nA series of concussions, however, changed all that. Murphy suffered her first concussion in eighth grade when struck in the head by a wild pitch during a softball game. She suffered two more playing field hockey during her sophomore year. \nThat’s when doctors said she had to stop playing contact sports. \n“It was really hard to deal with,” Murphy said. “I loved field hockey and being aggressive and competitive. I had to find something else to do.” \nIt was suggested she give golf a try. So despite having never picked up a club before, Murphy went out for the golf team as a junior. She took to it immediately and wound up having the best girls team average and league record. \n“I had so much fun,” Murphy said. “All the guys were so polite and respectful. They all helped me out so much because I had no idea what I was doing. At the end of the season when they told me what I did, I was really surprised because when I played I didn’t think I was doing well. So it was awesome.” \nMurphy also competed in track and field. Because of the concussions, running gave her headaches. So she did the field throwing events — javelin, discus and shot put — and qualified for districts last year in the javelin. \nBesides sports, Murphy has been an alter server for 12 years at her church, St. Bernard’s, and also participates in the St. John’s Youth Group. After graduation, she hopes to go to cosmetology school and one day open her own salon. \n“I like doing hair, makeup and nails,” Murphy said. “Since I can’t play field hockey in college, this seems like a good idea.” \n— SCOTT WALSH \nswalsh@timesshamrock.com \nLackawanna Trail \nNathan and Nick Rolka start for the varsity football team, which defeated Carbondale Area, 15-7, to get its second win of the season on Oct. 10. \nNathan, a freshman starting quarterback, scored a touchdown in the victory. His strengths include the ability to process information quickly and make decisions and arm strength. \nNick, a senior and two-year starter on the offensive and defensive lines, earned team captain honors from his teammates. A three-year member of the IRONMAN Club, he also serves as one of six members of the 1,000 LB Club on this year’s squad. \n— JOE BARESS \njbaress@timesshamrock.com \nLakeland \nCorey Bednash expected the football team’s game against Dunmore on Friday to be a physical one. \n“Our team is healthy and we have so many guys that can contribute,” Bednash said ahead of the game. “We were looking to show the Bucks what we’re made of.” \nBednash is a captain of the team, and is also a member of the track and field team. The senior plans to study criminal justice in college. \n— CONOR FOLEY \ncfoley@timesshamrock.com \nMid Valley \nFreshman Mariah Minter enjoyed quite the first season with the Spartans golf team, posting an 11-1 record in singles, already making her the all-time wins leader for a Mid Valley girls golfer.

One in particular was a camp at West Point, New York. \nBrewer attended the camp for five days to go through drills and running workouts. \n“I just wanted to see what the camp was like,” Brewer said. \nBrewer says his favorite part of camp was just being there and seeing what life was like on campus. He also recently led the boys varsity cross country team to victory at the McQuaid Invitational in Rochester, N.Y. \n— MARTY MYERS \nmmyers@timesshamrock.com \nNorth Pocono \nSenior Joanna Bernatowicz is a hard worker both in her athletic endeavors and in the classroom.

Emily, a senior, is the student chairperson while Maria, a sophomore, serves on the committee. \n“We didn’t have our first meeting yet — that’s this week,” Emily said. “We’re just getting ready for stuff, starting to plan for it. \n“We like to raise money for this cause. It’s important for us and our school.” \nEmily is also a member of Knight Rhythms, Spanish club, SADD and Freshman Orientation. She has been involved with the Coaches vs. Cancer campaign for three years. \n“It keeps you busy,” Emily said. “Even though it’s my senior year, I like doing things outside the school. Planning this is really exciting because it’s my last year and this is the last time I get to do it. \n— CONOR FOLEY \ncfoley@timesshamrock.com \nScranton Prep \nSenior members of this year’s girls cross country team are: Sarah Brown, Erin Feeney, Christine Kaffka, Katie Lapinski, Mary McFadden, Brianna Price, Kate Reilly, Eva Rine, Anna Roe, Emma Walsh and Katie Walsh. \n— SHANE HENNIGAN \nSusquehanna \nJunior Katie Woodruff has been running cross country for five years. \nShe recently finished in 11th place in a Lackawanna League meet Oct. 6 against Dunmore, Old Forge and Riverside.

McHale, along with classmates Hali Bargella, Aubri Fisher, Vittorio Romano, Carley Scopelliti and Jake Osborne, presented a program on bullying to the Valley View Elementary grades kindergarten to second grade. The seniors played out a skit of a pep rally scenario to interact with the students and teach them about bullying. \n“It was great to get to interact with the students at the elementary school,” McHale said. “I had just as much fun as they did and got a chance to speak about an issue as serious as bullying.” \nMcHale is also a member of the basketball and baseball teams and is a member of the National Honor Society, Math Honor Society, Spanish Club, student council and the International Travel Club. \n— HERB SMITH \nhsmith@timesshamrock.com \nWallenpaupack \nAfter being named Athlete of the Week for leading his team to a District 2 Class AAA championship, and following that up by pacing his team to the PIAA team golf championships as medalist in a subregional win Thursday over Selinsgrove, how much better could things get for Kyle Pillar? \nTurns out his great shots aren’t limited to the golf course. \nOver the weekend, the junior dropped an 8-point buck while hunting with bow and arrow. \n— MARTY MYERS \nmmyers@timesshamrock.com \nWestern Wayne \nOctober is Down syndrome Awareness Month and the cross country team is doing its part for the cause. \nAt its home meet Tuesday, the team is collecting coloring books, crayons and children’s books that will be donated to Abilities21, a nonprofit group in Moscow that works with special needs children and their families. The Wildcats ask the other schools competing in the meet — Montrose, Blue Ridge, Elk Lake, Honesdale, Forest City and Carbondale Area — as well as any fans attending the meet to consider donating the same items. \nAlso, team members have been collecting jars and painting them blue and yellow — the colors of Down syndrome awareness. The jars will be used as markers to line the course during the meet. \nRunners are also encouraged to wear blue and yellow ribbons and/or socks to help spread awareness and acceptance for Down syndrome. \n— SCOTT WALSH \nswalsh@timesshamrock.com \nWest Scranton \nSenior soccer player Jake MacDonald organized a coin drop Tuesday at Gerrity’s in West Scranton for Operation Warm to raise money for winter coats for students at Bancroft Elementary School. \nHead soccer coach Mark Schultz, a firefighter, came to MacDonald with the cause of operation warm. \n“I figured it’d be great to get involved because I really feel bad for the underprivileged kids in the cold northeast winters,” MacDonald said. \nMacDonald said he was grateful for the help of about 12 of his teammates who made signs and danced around outside Gerrity’s to attract donors. \nThey raised more than $250, which will provide seven winter coats to the Bancroft students. \n“I was interested in community service for whatever opportunity I get and it seems like a great cause and a great opportunity and obviously I needed the help,” MacDonald said. “I came to my soccer team because I know they would always be ready to support me.” \n— CARMINE GERRITY-GEMEI \nsports@timesshamrock.com We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.
