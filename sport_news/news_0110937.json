Portobello [Market],\" Marshall said Friday. \"I'm an antique guy. I collect antiques. So every time I get a chance, I'm always looking over there. It's cool. You guys should do it if you have free time. It's like a festival.\"\nPortobello Market, located in West London, is a popular tourist attraction and is considered one of the most famous street markets in the world. The nearly two-mile stretch of Portobello Road runs straight through Notting Hill, the location made famous by the Julia Roberts movie.\nMarshall said he's only been to London twice before coming with the Jets to play the Miami Dolphins on Sunday. But unfortunately for him, antiquing is out of the question this trip.\nJets Jets practice in London \"I want to go, but I will not go,\" he said. \"I just want to be at my best for Sunday. If it was a regular week or something, I definitely would go for like an hour. It's pretty cool. I'm telling you, you should go. They only do it on Saturdays.\"\nSo what's the coolest antique he's collected?\n\"I have a 1940 doctor's bag. That's pretty cool,\" Marshall said. \"So that's my thing now, collecting bags, antique bags. I've got an 1800s bag. Some cool stuff.\"\nFollowing Friday's practice, Todd Bowles gave players the rest of the day off, as well as Saturday, to spend time with family and do some sightseeing around London. \"We don't monitor them,\" said the Jets coach. \"They can't get into trouble and be that guy, but they have free time to go see the sights.\"\nBut most of his players had just one thing on their minds Friday.\nBob Glauber Glauber: Gailey a big fan of Brandon Marshall \"First things first, get a little rest today,\" outside linebacker Calvin Pace said. \"Tomorrow I'll do some things.\"\nAdded cornerback Darrelle Revis: \"Maybe I'll try to get out. But I've got to probably just rest because my body's a little off right now.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/performgroup.js", "http://images.eplayer.performgroup.com/namedImage/12637/install_flash.gif", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/swfobject.js"], "published": "2015-10-03T00:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T06:08:46.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
