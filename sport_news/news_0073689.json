It's one thing for him to say but to see him out there ... all of us have big respect for a guy like him and for him to come out here it's definitely special.\n\"What can't you learn? He's got so much knowledge in every area of the game. His stats speak for themselves but just the kind of person he is but for him to take time out his day to help ... Today we worked on my angles, shifting my hips a bit and working with Andy as well. Stuff like that can make me go from scoring six goals to 20 pretty fast.\"\nCoach Dave Cameron said Alfredsson will be on the ice \"as needed.\" It makes sense, he scored 444 goals in his 1,246-game career.\n\"We're still feeling our way around here,\" Cameron said. \"We're going to use him.\"\nLazar said just having Alfredsson around has been great.\n\"He knows a thing or two about the league, how it works, the city of Ottawa and the Senators,\" Lazar said. \"If I can have him on my side and stay in his good books then I think I'll have a pretty good career.\"\nTwitter: @sungarrioch\nAlfredsson helping Lazar with shot\nBy Bruce Garrioch , Ottawa Sun First posted: Saturday, October 03, 2015 03:52 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 03, 2015 06:28 PM EDT\nLike he was during his storied playing career with the Senators, it appears Daniel Alfredsson will be Mr. Everything in his new off-ice role as well.\nAs the formal part of morning skate was wrapping up at the Canadian Tire Centre Saturday, the 42-year-old Alfredsson, who looks like he could play, skated onto the ice in a track suit and spent more than 30 minutes working with a group of forwards on shooting the puck.\nAlfredsson went out specifically to work with second-year winger Curtis Lazar but it didn't take long for a crowd to gather round.\n\"It's awesome,\" said Lazar. \"He's going to lend a hand in every way, shape and form that he can.
