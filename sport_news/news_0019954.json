(Image Source: Mike Stobe/Getty Images) \n\"The greatest retaliation is winning,\" New York Mets outfielder Michael Cuddyer said following the team’s 13-7 Game 3 win over the Los Angeles Dodgers on Wednesday night. \nMuch of the sold out crowd of 44,276 at Citi Field wanted blood. Preferably Chase Utley’s (there were “We want Utley” chants, among others, heard throughout the night), but any Dodger would do. Instead of plunking one of LA’s hitters in retaliation for Utley’s dirty slide on shortstop Ruben Tejada , which resulted in a postseason-ending broken leg, the Mets got their revenge at the dish with their bats. \nWhen ace Matt Harvey was touched up for three runs in the top of the second it looked like the Mets might not get their payback, but the tone of the game changed quickly in the bottom of the inning. \nOutfielder Yoenis Cespedes has been making noise with his power since he arrived in Queens, but in Game 3 he started the rally with his speed, beating out an infield single on a groundball to shortstop Jimmy Rollins . Following a single by first baseman Lucas Duda , catcher Travis d’Arnaud hit the first pitch he saw from southpaw Matt Anderson sharply to get the Mets on the board. \nAfter shortstop Wilmer Flores loaded the bases with nobody out, neither centerfielder Juan Lagares (fielder’s choice), nor Harvey (strikeout) was able to plate a runner, leaving it up to Curtis Granderson . The leadoff hitter crushed the first pitch he saw off the wall in right-center to clear the bases and give the Mets a 4-3 lead. \nThe two-out knock was the biggest hit of the night. After seeing their ace, the Dark Knight, look very hittable and loading the bases with nobody out, the Mets needed to score more than one run in the bottom of the second. They did and New York was far from done. \nWith Cespedes on first the Mets continued their aggressive approach at the plate when d’Arnaud again was first-pitch swinging and he launched a two-run blast to extend the lead to 6-3 in the bottom of the third inning. \nIn the bottom of the fourth, Dodgers manager Don Mattingly walked David Wright with two outs and Lagares in scoring position, setting up Daniel Murphy for an RBI single, bringing Cespedes to the plate. The deadline acquisition gave the Citi Field crowd the wow moment of the night when he sent a laser beam into the second deck in left field and put the Mets ahead 10-3. \nThe Orange & Blue tacked on three more runs in the seventh on a pinch-hit sacrifice fly by rookie Michael Conforto , followed by a Granderson double, which plated two. Grandy finished with five RBI’s, while Cespedes and d’Arnaud drove in three apiece and they also had three hits, as well as three runs scored. \nThe offensive explosion allowed them to overcome a shaky outing by Harvey. His command was off for much of the game and he lasted only five innings. Harvey pitched three straight shutout innings once given the lead and did strikeout seven Dodgers. \n\"He worked harder tonight to give us five quality innings than I have seen him work at any time,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said of Harvey’s effort. \nThe Mets take the field for Game 4 on Thursday night with a chance to close out the National League Division Series. LA will send Game 1 starter Clayton Kershaw to the hill tonight. The Mets managed three runs on four hits in 6.2 innings off the southpaw, as they opened the series with a win in Dodgers Stadium. \n\"I'm always pretty confident when he's pitching,\" Mattingly said of his Game 4 starter. \nThe Mets will turn to a lefty as well, but one with much less experience, as rookie Steven Matz , who has six career starts, will make his postseason debut on Thursday night. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
