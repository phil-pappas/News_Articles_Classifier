I am looking forward to being out on the field with my team next season playing the game that brings me so much happiness.\" \nThe timing of the voluntary rehab check-in is especially challenging as the Yankees get set for the American League wild-card game, which if they win, would propel them into a five-game AL Division Series. Sabathia likely would've started a game or two in that series. \nIn August, a TMZ cameraman caught Sabathia getting into a fight outside of a Toronto-area night club. The Yankees never disciplined Sabathia, but it was bad press during an already subpar season. \nOutside of that incident, and perhaps a natural decline in production, Sabathia's apparent struggles with alcohol have been relatively unknown to the general public until now. \nThis is Sabathia's seventh year with the Yankees and his 15th in the majors. He has two years remaining on his contract. \nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T23:15:57.265+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
