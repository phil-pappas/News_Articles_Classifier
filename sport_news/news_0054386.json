Sheriff’s officials say the improvements have allowed the department to have a better presence in the small town. Tyler Richardson Tri-City Herald i \nFranklin County Sheriff’s Deputy Monty Huber stood at the door of a Mesa home and delivered a powerful knock fit for a wanted criminal. \nThe 6-foot-1, 250-pound former Army Ranger stepped back and waited as the door slowly opened. \n“It’s Monty,” a young girl in glasses exclaimed as she buried her face in Huber’s outstretched arms. \nThe family inside spilled onto the lawn to greet Huber with hugs. \nHuber, 46, stopped by the tan and green house tucked away on a nondescript street to visit a boy the deputy has mentored for years. The boy’s father is not around and Huber tries to help out when he can. \nHuber and his fellow deputies have become a constant presence in the tiny north Franklin County town with the recent renovation of a sheriff’s office substation attached to City Hall. \nAfter writing his phone number on a card and handing it to the boy, Huberslid back into his SUV and continued on his patrols. \n“As long as you treat them decent, it really does go a long way,” he said. \nSheriff Jim Raymond approached Huber a few months ago about getting the station up and running. For some time, there has been an office there for deputies to use, but the space was run down and in need of a makeover. \n“There were no computers, no phone. There was an old metal desk and a bathroom,” Huber said. “More often than not, if you stopped there, it was because you wanted to use the bathroom.” \nHuber, who lives in Connell and serves on the city council there as mayor pro-tem, used his background in city government to help develop a plan to get the station renovated, he said. The deputy envisioned a new office as a bridge into the community and its citizens. \nCity officials in Mesa jumped on board, dedicating an estimated $36,000 allocated to the city from the county’s public safety sales tax fund to pay for the project. \nSoon, construction workers were tearing the old office apart. The finished space was big enough for two desks and a large adjoining conference room. \nThe improvements allowed the sheriff’s office to move in computers and other equipment so deputies can stop in to write reports, conduct investigations and check emails. Technology also was added to help improve radio service in the area. \nThe sheriff’s office unveiled the office to citizens and officials during an open house last month. \n“The night we did the grand opening, there had to be easily 30 to 40 people floating in and out of there,” Raymond said. “It has drawn a little bit of attention from the community.” \nAs Huber cruised around town on a recent sunny afternoon, he stopped to wave at people doing yard work and had a brief chat with a young man with a propensity for graffiti art. \nSince the station opened, Huber has been more visible in the city of about 500 people and has begun to build relationships with many in the town, he said. Huber now drops into the station and routinely finds messages or notes from citizens about what’s going on around town. \nViolent or serious felony crimes aren’t prevalent in Mesa, but deputies are on the look out for graffiti, property thefts and break-ins, Huber said. \nMayor David Ferguson told the Herald that since deputies have started to use the station more, he has noticed less graffiti and citizens are showing appreciation for the increased law enforcement presence. \n“A lot of residents are happy that Monty and the other deputies use (the station) because they are in town now,” Ferguson said. “We have no local police department. We have to count on the sheriff’s office.” \nPart of the reason for making a push to get the station renovated was to continue strengthening relationships with citizens in the northern part of the county, a promise Raymond made during his 2014 campaign, the sheriff said. \nThe station has been received so well in Mesa that the sheriff’s office is talking to city officials in Kahlotus to try and open another station, Raymond said. \n“The more visual you are in those communities, that obviously creates a safer environment for the community,” the sheriff said. “It’s a win-win.” \nHuber agreed: “We were visible here before, but it was just in passing,” he said. “Our interactions now are getting out and playing ball with kids on the playground or handing out stickers. That’s huge, especially in an area like this.” \nTyler Richardson: 509-582-1556; trichardson@tricityherald.com ; Twitter: @Ty_richardson Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:57:50.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
