They should re-elect him over Republican challenger Richard Ottinger. Lewis, an Eastern Shore lawyer and former member of the House of Delegates, squeaked into the Senate last year with an 11-vote win in a special election to replace Ralph Northam, who left after being elected lieutenant governor.\nSince that narrow victory, Lewis has kept a low profile. But he bristles at claims that he's a \"back-bencher,\" describing such criticism from his opponent as typical of candidates who've never held elected office, and who lack understanding of process and politics in Richmond.\nIn a House where Republicans vastly outnumbered Democrats. Lewis learned to work across party lines, supporting the 2013 transportation funding package and funding for the spaceport at Wallops Island, among other bipartisan measures.\nAs a delegate and as a senator, he has advocated using Virginians' federal tax dollars to expand Medicaid, and for bills proposing to study sea-level rise, ban workplace discrimination based on sexual orientation and transfer redistricting duties to an independent commission.\nOttinger, a Norfolk resident and maritime lawyer, is a first-time nominee who faces a steep learning curve for the job he seeks.\nHis campaign insists he'll \"do everything in his power to stop Medicaid expansion,\" and his reliance on talking points is thin cover for his lack of knowledge about his own party's quiet, long-term history of expanding Medicaid's primary budget driver: fee-for-service waivers that cover developmentally and intellectually disabled Virginians.\nOttinger opposes voucher-funding to private schools because such a policy erodes public school quality. But his plan to require that 65 percent of education funds go to the classroom is unnecessary; a state report recently showed that percentage already goes to instruction.\nAlthough Virginia is a right-to-work state, where unions have virtually no standing, Ottinger has pledged to \"stop abusive union practices.\" Despite the commonwealth's reputation for business-friendly regulations, Ottinger has pledged to reduce regulations further.\nFor his experience and knowledge of the issues, Lewis is a better candidate.\nAbout editorials Virginian-Pilot editorials represent the consensus of the editorial board, which is independent of the newsroom.
