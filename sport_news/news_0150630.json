After losing the first match meekly here on Tuesday, the Indians showed aggressive intent in their approach as Ramandeep Singh gave the tourists an early lead in the 13th minute. The Kiwis quickly switched back to attacking mode before securing an equaliser through Kane Russell on the stroke of third quarter. The third quarter also saw Indian goalkeeper Sreejesh Ravindran display a fine performance by making three quick-fire saves. However, forward player Lalit Upadhyay put the tourists back in the lead in the 52nd minute before Nikkin Thimmaiah sealed the game for India in the final minute. India will now play the hosts in the third game of the tour at Christchurch on Friday.
