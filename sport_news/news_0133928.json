It was just a huge statement for us.\" \nThat statement helped to put the Pioneers (3-1 L-L, 5-2 overall) back in the thick of the Section Two race, and it started on their first play from scrimmage, a 62-yard pass from Shank to senior Jordan Boynton. \n\"We just had a great game plan,\" Shank said of the quick score. \"Boynton had a cast on the whole year until this game and he was a huge weapon for us.\" \nL-S added to their lead with a 28-yard screen pass to running back Shane Lawler before Baron's quarterback Kody Kegarise cut into the deficit with a 7-yard touchdown run. \nShank wasted little time answering on a short field, however, finding receiver Andrew Hay for a 12-yard first down and a 34-yard touchdown pass when Shank stepped up in the pocket and threw to the wide-open Hay on the sideline. \n\"I'm just making my reads, line gave me time,\" said Shank of the play. \"Guys made plays for me. All I have to do is put the ball near them and they'll catch it.\" \nThe offense for Manheim (3-1, 5-2) soon came to life behind the inside-outside running of halfback Damon Camacho (26 rushes, 110 yards, 3 TDs) and Kegarise (5-43, 1 TD). \nBut it was back-to-back Pioneer turnovers that allowed the Barons to take a 21-19 lead on the strength of a pair of 2-yard touchdown runs by Camacho. \n\"If you worry, you're done,\" said Pioneers' coach John Manion of the sudden deficit. \"I never sensed that (on the sidelines). I was worried if we got down two scores that might come on, but we didn't let that happen. I'm proud of our kids.\" \nL-S quickly took the lead for good, churning out 95 yards for the go-ahead score. \nAll but the final two yards of the drive came from Lawler (185 yards on 25 touches), including a 27-yards pass on third-and-21 after an offensive pass-interference penalty. Shank finished off the drive with a 2-yard plunge for a 26-21 halftime lead. \nAfter the half, Shank (19-of-31, 372 yards) threw third-quarter touchdowns to Caleb Lopez and Boynton (5 catches, 160 yards, 2 TDs) for a 40-21 lead. \n\"I wasn't sure that we would be that efficient,\" Manion said of the 40-point night. \"(Manheim has) a really good defense. I think my staff had their best game of the year.\" \n\"This team does really well adapting to schemes,\" Shank said, \"and at halftime we knew they were going to change things up and we adapted and still played really well.\" \nIn the fourth quarter, the Barons went with junior quarterback Trevor Hosler, who led Manheim to a fourth-quarter touchdown on Camacho's third rushing touchdown of the night. \nBut in the end it was Lampeter-Strasburg holding the party on offense, a celebration of sorts on their quarterback's birthday. \n\"It all comes down to we have the kid that can get the ball into a lot of their (our playmaker's) hands,\" Manion said, \"and everybody out there did their job tonight.\" \nL-S MC", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T07:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:13:11.472+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
