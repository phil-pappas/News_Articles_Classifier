PredictionMachine 22 hrs ago Which NFL team is most likley to stay undefeated?\nAdChoices Â© Provided by PredictionMachine, LLC Five teams (Panthers, Broncos, Bengals, Packers and Patriots) in the NFL have yet to lose a game. That is the most unbeaten teams at this point in the season since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970.\nWhich team has the best chance of finishing the regular season undefeated?\nCarolina Panthers (5-0)\nCam Newton and the Panthers are a soft 5-0. Carolina hasn't beaten a team with a winning record this season and the schedule is about to get a lot more difficult. Their next three games are against teams ranked 10th, 15th and 2nd in our Power Rankings . The Panthers are 99.9 percent likely to suffer a loss this season.\nDenver Broncos (6-0)\nDenver is undefeated and fans are calling for Peyton Manning to be benched . The NFL is a strange place. The Broncos have won five of six games by a touchdown or less. Records in one-score games tend to regress to the mean over time. With a struggling offense and a little less luck, Denver is one of the least likely teams to stay perfect.\nCincinnati Bengals (6-0)\nCincy is a surprise 6-0 to start the season. Of course until the Bengals start to have success in the playoffs (Marvin Lewis is 0-6 in the postseason) it's hard to take this team seriously.\nGreen Bay Packer (6-0)\nThe Cheeseheads are the best team in the NFC and arguably the most balanced in all of football. Aaron Rodgers is pretty but the Packers are longshots to run the table.\nNew England Patriots (5-0)\nThe Patriots are averaging an NFL best 36.6 points-per-game. New England is the No. 1 team in our Power Rankings and are nearly twice as likely to go undefeated as any team in the NFL, but another 16-0 regular season is highly improbable.\nTeam Chance of Winning Out Patriots 1.2% Packers 0.7% Bengals 0.6% Broncos 0.4% Panthers 0.1%\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.predictionmachine.com/Should-Broncos-Bench-Peyton-Manning", "http://www.predictionmachine.com/", "http://www.predictionmachine.com/NFL-Team-Rankings-10-20-2015", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:35:24.419+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
