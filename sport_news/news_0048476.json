Suffering from stomach issues, the 26-year-old Kenyan found herself passed by countrymate Cynthia Limo. Wacera thought her chances to win the race, as well as the BAA’s Distance Medley, were done.\nThen Wacera remembered the $20,000 in prize money she would earn if she clinched the Distance Medley title, awarded to anyone winning two of the organization’s four annual races.\n“I just had the surge to close the gap,” Wacera said. “In the back of my mind was the bonus. In the front of my mind was Cynthia.”\nWacera kicked it into high gear as the women’s field entered Franklin Park’s White Stadium, overtook Limo and crossed the finish line in 1:10:21, just one second ahead of Limo.\n“I didn’t know I could win until I entered the stadium and looked back and saw Cynthia dropping,” Wacera said. “My knees were saying, ‘No, don’t go.’ But I had to go. There is $20,000 somewhere.”\nKenyan Daniel Salel won the men’s race in 1:00.56. Like Wacera, Salel also clinched the Distance Medley title.\n“This is very special to me,” Salel said. “I’ve been trying. This was the third time. I was here in 2013 and 2014 and came in second. So today I worked very hard to win this one.”\nThe victory meant more than just a bonus check for Wacera. After not being able to complete the race last October, it was redemption.\n“Last year, I did not finish because I had a knee injury,” Wacera said. “So going into today, I was like, ‘This course is very tough.’ It’s actually not that tough. We are tough.”\nRunner-up Limo begged to differ.\n“This race, there are a lot of downs and hills,” said the 25-year-old Limo, who finished second for the second consecutive year. “It is not an easy course.”\nBelaynesh Oljira and 2015 Boston Marathon champion Caroline Rotich ran with Wacera and Limo in a four-runner pack through most of the race and finished third and fourth, respectively. Pennsylvania’s Clara Santucci was the top American finisher, with a seventh-place time of 1:14:23.\nSalel and Stephen Sambu led the men’s race most of the way. Surging ahead of an opening pack of four runners, Salel and Sambu ran shoulder to shoulder until Salel jumped ahead at the 11th mile. Holding a significant lead entering White Stadium, Salel didn’t look back.\n“After the 11th mile, I realized that I would win,” Salel said. “I was feeling strong, and I started pulling away. We went through the zoo, and I just started pushing. (Sambu) tried to follow me, but I just increased the pace.”\nFamiliarity with his closest competition helped Salel as he took the lead.\n“We have raced a long time,” Salel said. “I knew he was a strong guy. I knew he was very strong in the kick. After 11 miles I started pushing. I pulled away.”\nEliud Ngetich took third. The BAA saw one of its own and a 2016 Olympic trials marathon qualifier, Eric Ashe of Hanson, take fourth place as the top American in 1:05:48.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:21:45.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
