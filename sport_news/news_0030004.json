You introduce it, then you enhance it and clean it and polish it throughout the year. It’s going to be an important source of points.” \nThe Oil Kings open up a four-game road trip in Moose Jaw on Friday, playing their first game since Sunday at Rexall Place, where sniper Brett Pollock’s goal at 2:28 of overtime gave Edmonton its first win of the season, 3-2 over Swift Current. Pollock was also on the ice two games earlier when the Oil Kings lost 3-2 to Red Deer 38 seconds into overtime after turning the puck over in the Rebels’ zone and getting caught in a two-on-one going the other way. \n“You definitely don’t want to be dumping the puck in and giving away possession, so we’ve worked on when you’re tired just holding on to it, waiting for a guy to get open, and keep possession as long as you can, because obviously — as we saw against Red Deer — when you lose the puck down low, you get caught on a change and the game can end just like that,” Pollock said. \nIn concert with the CHL and following the lead of the NHL, the WHL starting this season made the switch from five minutes of four-on-four overtime to five minutes of three-on-three (power-plays see players added to the team with the advantage, rather than taken from the penalized side). As before, games not decided in overtime will go to a shootout. \n“I think it’s exciting,” said Oil Kings netminder Alec Dillon, who turned aside three shots during a Broncos four-on-three power-play in overtime before Pollock’s heroics. “You make a big save and the guys come back down and score you feel pretty good about yourself like (in) a shootout.” \nHamilton has prior experience with the three-on-three format, which was employed several years in the Alberta Junior Hockey League where he was a championship-winning coach with the Spruce Grove Saints. Puck management is key, Hamilton said, but just as important is shift length and changes. \n“We want (shifts) to be a really short burst and then if you’re not in the play on the back check, we’re going to try to get a new set of legs out the door,” Hamilton said. \n“It’s just going to be such a quick transition that we’ve got to get in the habit of bursting in 30 seconds and then being able to get a fresh set of legs to keep the pace high because there really is no prolonged play that benefits you.” \nThe coach is still learning who his three-on-three specialists are, though leading-scorer Pollock is clearly one of them. Forwards Lane Bauer and Davis Koch, along with blueliners Ben Carroll and Dysin Mayo, have also be used thus far. \n“Realistically, we’ll probably look at 12 guys, eight forwards and four D, that are going to be part of that mix,” said Hamilton. “The games haven’t lasted long enough to get them each a couple of turns so far so we’ll keep working throughout the year.” \nNine of the first eleven games that needed overtime in the WHL this year ended before the shootout, and the majority of them concluded quickly: last Saturday Spokane scored on Tri-City in a mere seven seconds. \n“You’re probably going to have the outcome of the game decided, which for fans is very exciting, because the game turns so quickly in overtime,” said Hamilton, an unabashed fan of the new format. “There’s so much open ice that you’re going to see a high level of skill on display and I think I’d want to see that, too.” \n@SunBrianSwane", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T04:41:20.904+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
