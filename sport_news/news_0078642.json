As you saw last year, this is actually not such a bad race from P2 (second on the grid).\"\nRosberg got alongside Hamilton at the start last year but made a mistake that sent him back to 20th place. The German then did 52 laps on one set of tires and fought back to finish second.\nBottas set the fastest lap in that race and said it was good to be right behind the Mercedes pair, even if Brazilian team mate Felipe Massa qualified only 15th.\nVettel had hoped for third place on the grid and felt sure the race would be closer.\n\"I believe we have a very good car so it should be a good race: I’m actually very confident for tomorrow,\" said the German.\n\"I think they (Mercedes) have been more or less one second away but I also think tomorrow it will be a lot closer, I expect that the gap will be smaller, we’ll see what we can do.\"\nBehind the Ferraris, Force India's Nico Hulkenberg and Sergio Perez qualified sixth and seventh with Romain Grosjean eighth for Lotus and Sainz's team mate Max Verstappen ninth.\nThere was disappointment for Russian fans with the only home-grown driver, Red Bull's Daniil Kvyat, set to start in 11th place with Australian team mate Daniel Ricciardo 10th.\n\"I will fight hard and hope to finish in the points, which would be a good result,\" said Kvyat.\n(Editing by Ed Osmond )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T22:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T21:48:38.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
