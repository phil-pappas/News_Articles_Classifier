Romaine Sawyers is finding the target more. \n“Sam Mantom was a big loss due to injury last season and now he’s fit and firing. \n“They are realistic contenders for promotion.” \nO’Donnell is particularly pleased to see the impact Sawyers has made this season, with the Saint Kitts and Nevis international often being deployed in a more advanced role. \n“Romaine has real quality,” O’Donnell said. “It’s great to see him chipping in because he is a great lad. \n“He did extremely well last season, the only thing that was missing was goals. \n“He would admit that himself but now he is scoring and performing well.” \nCrowned Walsall’s player of the year at the end of last season, O’Donnell still thoroughly expects Wigan to compete for an automatic promotion place. \nAnd he puts his team’s slow start down to players taking time to settle. \n“We have had a difficult start but the team is packed full of quality,” the glovesman added. “It’s been a big turnaround of players and it’s just taking a little bit of time to gel. \n“But promotion is the aim and it has to be with the talent we’ve got. \n“We’ve had a lot of injuries as well which has also made it difficult to field a settled side.
