It has committed zero. The Broncos have improved to plus-8 overall this season, which ranks tied for eighth nationally. \n“We’re proud of that,” coach Bryan Harsin said, “and that needs to continue.” \nBoise State tracks turnover margin on a board in the locker room. It shows how the Broncos fared in that battle in each game — minus-1 vs. Washington, minus-1 at BYU, plus-1 vs. Idaho State, plus-5 at Virginia and plus-4 vs. Hawaii. \n“You’ve got to value the football more than you value anything else,” offensive coordinator Eliah Drinkwitz said. \nHe has credited the defense for much of the Broncos’ offensive success the past two weeks because football, like real estate, is about “location, location, location,” Drinkwitz said. Turnovers usually create terrific field position. \n“When you’re playing with a lead and you’re getting a lot of opportunities, it feels like the offense can kind of get momentum,” junior wide receiver Thomas Sperbeck said. “You’re kind of in a groove and it feels like there’s not as much pressure to score rather than just running the offense.” \nColorado State, meanwhile, owns one of the nation’s worst turnover margins: minus-9. The Rams have committed 14 turnovers. \n“We won it against UTSA, and it’s cost us in the other games,” Colorado State coach Mike Bobo said. “We have to get more on defense.” \nAdded quarterback Nick Stevens, who has thrown five interceptions: “(The Broncos) have a knack for creating turnovers. They have created so many turnovers the past few weeks — it’s clearly something that can change the game.” Chadd Cripe: 377-6398; Twitter: @IDS_BroncoBeat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:46:10.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
