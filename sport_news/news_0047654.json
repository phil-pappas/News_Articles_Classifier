U.S. District Judge Anthony Ishii sentenced him on Tuesday.\nProsecutors say McCormack pretended to be a Bakersfield couple’s friend, but used visits to their home to abuse their toddler in the middle of the night at motels while the couple slept. Homeland Security agents in 2010 discovered images and recordings distributed by McCormack.\nA jury found him guilty in April of four counts of sexual exploitation of a child and two counts of kidnapping.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:36:29.249+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
