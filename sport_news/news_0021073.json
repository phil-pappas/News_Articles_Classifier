(AP) - The College of The Albemarle’s governing board has indefinitely suspended the school’s baseball and softball programs but left the possibility for their return if money becomes available. \nThe Daily Advance of Elizabeth City reports (http://bit.ly/1jO2sYu ) the college’s trustees voted unanimously last week. Chairman Marion Harris then appointed a committee to study funding for athletics. \nThe indefinite suspension follows trustees’ decision in April to suspend the programs for a year. \nTrustees have previously said the community college was spending roughly $90,000 yearly on baseball and softball but would need more money to field another women’s team to comply with federal rules. Trustees have also said the teams need a permanent field and reliable transportation. \n___ \nInformation from: The Daily Advance, http://www.dailyadvance.com/ \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T20:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:49:03.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
