But Cody Williams, who was 17-of-34 passing for 194 yards, led the Hawks (3-4, 1-1) downfield with three completions for first downs, including a 30-yarder to Reggie White Jr., who laid out to make a spectacular grab. \nLiberty's Josh Woodrum attempted a career-high 53 passes, completing 34 for 336 and an interception. Darrin Peterson made 13 catches for 120 yards. \nThe victory was the first for Monmouth over a FCS-ranked program. \nAll content copyright ©2015  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:47:07.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
