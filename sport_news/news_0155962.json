He has three brothers already on the force.\nFrancisco Hernandez, 34, is a field services officer in the Southeast Area Command; Michael Hernandez, 32, is a tactical K-9 officer; and Armando Hernandez, 28, is a property crimes detective.\n“I knew I wanted to help people,” said Kevin Hernandez, who moved to Albuquerque at age 17 to follow in his brothers’ footsteps. “My brothers were here. They had moved away when I was younger. And it wasn’t that hard of a decision for me.”\nThe path the Hernandez brothers took to become officers in Albuquerque started when they were growing up in the Bay Area. Although no one in their family had worked in law enforcement, Francisco and Michael decided to become police officers together.\nThe brothers imagined themselves as partners, riding in the same car and solving crimes.\n“It was a commitment Mike and I made together,” Francisco said. “We didn’t know we couldn’t ride together. But that was the idea.”\nAfter graduating from high school about 15 years ago, Michael joined the military and was stationed at Kirtland Air Force Base as a military police officer.\n“He was the pioneer,” Francisco said.\nWhen Michael’s service ended, he transferred to Albuquerque police in 2005.\n“And we’re a close-knit family, so I started recruiting,” Michael said.\nAt that time, Francisco was the equivalent of a police service aide in Northern California. It wasn’t long before he moved to Albuquerque and joined APD in 2007.\nTheir younger brother, Armando, would visit from California and ride along with police officers.\n“I was intrigued by what they did,” Armando said. “It opened my eyes to a different perspective.”\nA year after Francisco joined the Police Department, Armando also moved from California to Albuquerque to become a police officer.\nThe three brothers bought houses on the same street so they could maximize the time they spend together, because they all have different assignments and work hours.\n“It’s a puzzle piece,” Armando said of the schedules. “The time we do have with each other is pure comedy and joking around.”\nThe elder brothers said their assignments reflect their personalities. Francisco, the eldest, works the graveyard shift in the Southeast Area Command and is a field training officer, which means he trains and mentors new officers.\nMichael, the military veteran, was always athletic and stays physically fit for tactical police work. He is frequently on call in the middle of the night to rush to a SWAT situation.\nAnd Armando, as a detective, can take some of his personal style to work, which uniformed officers can’t do.\n“He likes to wear tight jeans and cute T-shirts,” Michael said.\nAs the elder brothers made careers in Albuquerque, Kevin, who is six to 12 years younger than his brothers, was back in California in high school. He decided to follow his brothers the first chance he got.\nHe graduated from high school and moved to Albuquerque.\n“He left everything in California at 17. His friends, all he knew here was us,” Armando said. “That takes a lot. … It speaks volumes.”\nAt 19, Kevin became a police service aide.\nAs a recent police academy graduate, he’ll do several months of field training and take investigation and crisis intervention courses before he starts patrol work as a field services officer.\nHis brothers gave him this advice: Follow your training and listen to officers with more experience.\n“We don’t worry too much about each other,” Michael said.\n“I think we’ll check in on him, but we’re all brothers; we know each other. We’re reasonably smart people, and we rely on our training,” Francisco said. “It all molds together.”\nThey is the second set of four brothers who currently work for the department, said officer Simon Drobik, an APD spokesman. Lance, Jacob, Matthew and Aaron Hoisington are also police officers and brothers.\nThe Hernandez brothers said their supportive families have been crucial in allowing them to turn police work into a family business.\nTheir families, they said, have to deal with their late hours, time in court and holidays on duty.\nMichael and Francisco are married and have two children each. And all four brothers said their parents, Martha and Francisco Hernandez, who moved to New Mexico in recent years and live in Corrales, have encouraged the brothers in their career choice.\n“I don’t think we’d have these great careers without that support group,” Michael said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:10:44.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
