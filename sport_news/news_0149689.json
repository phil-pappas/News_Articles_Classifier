Fox announced earlier this week that Joe Buck will call the American League Championship Series, and many Royals fans who feel that Buck ignored their team and was partial in last year’s World Series are upset.\nAdChoices According to some Royals fans, Buck was far too preoccupied with the performance of Giants pitcher Madison Bumgarner (who happened to have one of the greatest performances in postseason history), and didn’t pay enough attention to Kansas City. One fan started a Change.org petition to have Buck removed from the broadcast, which has more than 10,000 supporters by Saturday morning.\n© Provided by USA Today Sports Screen Shot 2015-10-17 at 9.59.14 AM\n“On October 29th, 2014, Joe Buck said Bumgarner 87 times, Giants 56 times, San Francisco 24 times, Kansas City 13 times, and Royals 8 times.\nOur opinion is clear and simple, why not have someone that will call the game evenly and without a preconceived love for either team?”\nBuck helped promote the petition on Twitter.\n© Provided by USA Today Sports Screen Shot 2015-10-17 at 9.59.41 AM © Provided by USA Today Sports Screen Shot 2015-10-17 at 10.09.40 AM\n© Provided by USA Today Sports Screen Shot 2015-10-17 at 10.09.49 AM © Provided by USA Today Sports Screen Shot 2015-10-17 at 9.59.41 AM\n@Buck I'm curious, do you really not realize how completely unprofessional you were in that series?\n— Tera (@teranelson) October 15, 2015\nBefore I answer that, are you holding or being held in your picture? https://t.co/rPgUFNBmgZ\n— Joe Buck (@Buck) October 15, 2015\n@Buck It's a serious ? Maybe you just didn't realize? Did you watch it back and think, gee, I did talk about SF 80% of the time, my bad?\n— Tera (@teranelson) October 15, 2015\nRoyals fan Rob Riggle, for one, is #TeamBuck.\nI'm not on board w/ this.
