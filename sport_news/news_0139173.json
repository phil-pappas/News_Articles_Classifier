Lumpkin County took on Fannin County and East Hall played Dawson County in a pair of best-of-three series. \nThe winners of those series will take on the top two seeds -- Banks County and Franklin County -- who already qualified for the state tournament, in the semifinals. \nEast Hall won the first game Monday 6-1 but the Lady Tigers rallied to take Game 2, 7-5, to force a deciding Game 3 on Tuesday. The winner will get Banks County on Wednesday. \nFannin County advanced to the state tournament with a sweep of Lumpkin County in a pair of 9-1 victories. The Lady Rebels will take on Franklin County starting Wednesday. \nIn Region 8-AA, the four playoff teams have been determined with Washington-Wilkes taking on No. 1 seed Union County beginning Tuesday. Rabun County travels to Social Circle on Wednesday with the winners of those series set to face off on Saturday for the region title and the top seed. \nIn Region 8-AAAA, the three of the four teams have been determined. Buford and Madison County are the top two seeds and already have qualified for the state tournament. North Hall qualified after sweeping Chestatee last week before the rains. \nNorth Hall will take on Madison County beginning Thursday in a best-of-three series. Buford, however, will have to wait for the winner of the Stephens County-North Oconee series. The Lady Wolves will play host to a best-of-three series also beginning on Thursday. \nRegion 8-AAAA is well-represented in the latest Class AAAA poll. Buford, which has won eight straight state titles spanning three classifications, is ranked fifth, Stephens County is seventh, and Madison County ninth. \nIn Region 8- , Flowery Branch already had advanced to the state tournament after sweeping Lanier last week. The Lady Falcons lost 10-9 in eight innings and 11-2 to Loganville on Monday in a best-of-three semifinals.
