Cook was unbeaten on 39 and Ali on 15 as England trail by 467 runs in reply to Pakistan’s first innings 523/8 declared after Day Two. The England batsmen will have to bat out of their skins to thwart Pakistan’s pace-cum-spin attack on a pitch which did not help the bowlers on the first two days but can change its nature as the game progresses. It was a day to remember for Malik as he capped his return to the Test side after a gap of five years with an epic knock of 245, his best score in Test cricket, after coming in to bat in the third over of the match on Tuesday. Asad Shafiq, who scored 107 for his ninth hundred, added 248 runs with Malik — a new record in Pakistan-England Tests — as Pakistan added 213 runs in the two sessions after resuming the day at 286 for four. Malik hit 24 boundaries and four sixes during his 420-ball knock before he smashed a Ben Stokes delivery straight to Ian Bell, who took a well-judged catch at mid-wicket. Brief scores: Pakistan 523 for 8 dec (Malik 245, Shafiq 107, Stokes 4/57); England 56 for 0 (Cook 39no). —AFP Karunaratne makes WItoil\nGalle: Opener Dimuth Karunaratne scored his third Test century and made the West Indies bowlers toil in sweltering conditions as Sri Lanka finished at 250/2 at stumps on the opening day of the first Test here today.
