Both teams rank near the top in the NSIC in nearly every offensive category. But their style of play isn't the only thing that's close about them. They are separated by just eight blocks. \n\"I'm not going to try and trick our team by saying this is just another game, because it isn't,\" USF Head Coach Jed Stugart said. \"It's a rivalry game. Both of us, I can't speak for them, but I'd guess that part of their recruiting is to explain just how special it is to play a team that is just a few blocks from you,\" he added. \n\"Certain people have their allegiance and this and that, but really it's about these kids and their experience that comes through it. There is a lot of pride that goes into it, that goes without question,\" Augustana Head Coach Jerry Olszewski said. \nAll eyes will be on each team's junior quarterback. Luke Papilion is the reigning NSIC Offensive Player of the Year and is well on his way to winning the award again this season. He has 26 total touchdowns and accounts for 66 percent of the Cougars yards on offense. \n\"Their offense really does go around Luke and he is a very dynamic football player. They also have a lot of weapons,\" Olszewski said. \nOn the other side Trey Heid has accounted for more than 2,100 yards and 19 scores this season for the Vikings. The Lakeville, MN native also ranks second in the nation in Passer Efficiency. \n\"He throws a nice deep ball and you have you to be ready for that, because they have been explosive that way,\" Stugart said of Heid. \nThe Cougars enter ranked fifth in the nation and have won the previous three meetings of this series. Both coaches understand the importance of this conference game, but know it's games like this that the players circle at the beginning of the year. \n\"These are the games I'm sure for both teams it's not hard to look ahead, because it's a fun week,\" Stugart said. \"It's a fun week of prep and it's fun for the media. I just tell our guys it's a fun week and to embrace it. These are memories they are making for the rest of their lives,\" he went on to say. \n\"They have one shot at this game. This isn't game eleven, this is game eight and we need to make sure that we are the best team that we can be in game eight and that happens to be against USF,\" Olszewski said. \nIf you are unable to attend the game at Bob Young Field Saturday, you can watch it live on our sister station My-UTV at 2:30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:24:58.441+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
