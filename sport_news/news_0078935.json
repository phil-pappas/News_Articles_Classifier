Pasta, egg sandwiches and pancakes everywhere.\nEarlier this year, America was just as stunned when Houston Texans NFL star J.J. Watt revealed he forces himself to consume between 6,000 and 9,000 calories a day just to keep at his 131kg frame.\nWell, now it’s time to meet San Diego Chargers defensive linebacker Brock Hekking.\nThe 24-year-old has not been idle since getting injured and being placed on the Chargers’ inactive roster.\nHe recently needed to have two screws surgically implanted into his left foot. Fortunately, his stomach works just fine.\nThe 1.90m, 113kg unit put himself to the ultimate test to see how much damage he could cause at the San Diego barbecue restaurant.\nThe answer is total destruction.\nBrock Hekking eats barbecue Here’s what was on the menu, according to Bleacher Report .\n2 racks of beef ribs\n2 racks of baby back ribs\n1 whole chicken\n2 pulled pork sandwiches\n1 giant sausage\n1 pound of mac and cheese\nLarge side of fries\nLarge onion rings\nBite of coleslaw\n2 ears of corn\n1.9 litre Mountain Dew\nThat’s more than 21,396 calories.\nHe did it in less than 42mins 38secs.\nThat’s a rate of 501.5 calories per minute.\nIt’s even better from the side.\nIt’s not the first time Hekking has been an internet sensation.\nIn the weeks leading into the 2015 NFL Draft, it was his unique blond locks that made headlines.\nThe Vacaville High School student became a college football star at the University of Nevada where he reportedly moved around the campus in a camouflaged golf buggy and was so popular the school handed out mullet wigs to fans at games.\nHis so-called “golden waterfall of mullet” also got the attention of TMZ Sports earlier this week.\nJust as confronting as his hair is the fact that Hekking has actually dropped quite a few kilos recently.\nAfter playing his college football at 120kg, he has dropped 7kg since joining the Chargers.\nHekking has signed a three-year deal with San Diego, but can be cut at any time as a free agent rookie.", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/eb28a41b3877ad230b5d3aea0ef67769", "http://bleacherreport.com/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/5fd994498ae4e948e065fbd0c6e63480", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fcontent4.video.news.com.au%2Ffoxsports%2Fprod%2Farchive%2F2015%2F10%2F13%2FDVU_131015_NFL_HARD_COUNT_WEEK_5_SUPERED_FIXED.jpg&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:48:55.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
