(AP) -- Tennessee running back John Kelly was taken to the hospital Tuesday after getting hurt during the Volunteers' afternoon practice. \nTennessee athletic department spokesman Ryan Robinson said that Kelly was taken to the hospital for a \"precautionary evaluation and was released.\" Robinson didn't specify the nature of Kelly's injury. \nKelly, a freshman from Detroit, has 21 carries for 88 yards in a reserve role this season. He recovered a fumble on a kickoff return to set up a touchdown in Tennessee's 38-31 victory over Georgia last week. \nTennessee (3-3, 1-2 SEC) has this week off before visiting No. 10 Alabama (5-1, 2-1) on Oct. 24. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
