Simpson or resolve Howard Hughes' will, Mike Perrin had a knack for finding a solution.\nAs Texas' new interim athletic director, Perrin confronts an equally difficult job -- trying to get all the alumni, boosters and fans on the same page while dealing with a struggling football program. Darrell Royal, the former Texas Hall of Fame coach and later AD, famously talked about trying to put all the \"BBs back in the box.\" So did Mack Brown.\nNow more than ever that may be difficult. Former athletic director Steve Patterson left after a stormy 22-month stay. Under coach Charlie Strong, football stands 1-4 going into the Red River Showdown with Oklahoma, the Longhorns' worst start in 59 years. Attendance is down. A major apparel deal, almost certainly a renewal with Nike, is being negotiated. Texas assistant Joe Wickline is being sued by former employer Oklahoma State\nYes, Perrin has plenty on his plate for someone who has never worked in an athletic department.\n\"Mike isn't going to make drastic changes especially immediately, but knowing his personality it will be very deliberate and firm changes,\" said Rusty Kelley, a fraternity brother of Perrin who worked with him as staffers in the Texas Senate.\nTexas president Greg Fenves said Perrin has \"all of the authority and discretion that a permanent athletics director would have\" and said he's off to a strong start. He'll be on the job into next year.\n\"In the spring, I will take a close look at how best to fill this post for the long-term,\" Fenves said.\nAlready a presence\nThose who know him well say Perrin is well equipped to begin the healing process.\n\"He's appropriately self-assured,\" said Mark Glasser, a Houston attorney and a former law partner of Perrin in the Houston branch of King & Spalding LLP. \"I can't imagine there's anybody who knows more what to expect than Mike and be ready to handle it.\"\nAt 68, Perrin is returning to Texas on the 50th anniversary of his arrival to play football for Royal. He's already a presence, visiting baseball and football practices Tuesday and trying to support coaches across the board.\nPerrin loves Texas' tradition. He's just not wedded to it, and pointed to one of Royal's key changes back in 1968, when Perrin was a senior.\n\"I think Texas from my experience has always had a blend of tradition but also change,\" Perrin said at the recent Big 12 ADs meeting in Grapevine. \"The Wishbone was a perfect example. It took some getting used to. ...\n\"The plays change. The rules change. You can't be mired in the past where you're not focusing on what the current issues are.\"\nStrong supporter\nWhen Patterson was ousted, national focus shifted to Strong.\nSo far, Perrin has unequivocally backed Strong, greeting the coach as he came off the team bus at Perrin's first football game as AD against California.\n\"I support Charlie Strong as a man and as a coach,\" Perrin said in a quick follow-up interview Monday after the 50-7 loss to TCU.\nPerrin was asked to introduce Strong last year before an alumni group in Austin.\n\"I wasn't going to just read stuff off a printed page,\" Perrin said. \"I was going to meet the man and spend some one-on-one time with him.\"\nBefore the meeting they talked about Strong's approach to coaching. Perrin heard how Strong wants his players to get an education and grow.\n\"He's interested in those young men, not just on the field,\" Perrin said. \"If you truly believe in the concept of a student-athlete, which I do, he's the epitome of the type of coach who wants his men to succeed.\"\nAbout that rivalry ...\nDuring his introductory press conference, Perrin escaped one question: Will Texas pursue renewing its football series with Texas A&M?\nPerrin knows all about the rivalry.\nHis father, Frank, was a civil engineering grad in the A&M class of 1940.\n\"It was always interesting around Thanksgiving,\" Perrin said. \"There's an old saying that blood is thicker than water. My father rooted for Texas for the four years I was there.\"\nSo?\n\"Will that game be rescheduled again?\" Perrin said. \"I'll take safe haven in the fact I'm an interim appointment. We're not playing them next year.\"\nPlaying days\nAs a player, Perrin went from potential fullback to a defensive end because of injuries early in his sophomore season.\nHe had never played the position. Perrin remembers Texas defensive coordinator Mike Campbell taking him by the shoulder pads and showing him the basics -- up to the line of scrimmage, back, in and out.\n\"We called him Iron Mike with good reason because he was tough as nails and very demanding,\" Perrin said. \"He was a genius. He could take complicated play situations and reduce it to something a 19-year-old kid could understand.\"\nFormer teammate Dick Watt remembers Perrin's reaction when Simpson, in his first game at Southern Cal in 1967, reversed his field and came toward him.\n\"Oh, crap,\" Perrin said.\nAs Simpson was about to turn the corner, Perrin reached in and poked the ball loose. Watt recovered.\nAs they jogged of the field, Perrin looked at Watt and said, \"Oh, crap.\"\nA future in Austin?\nPerrin handled many cases as a lawyer but not quite like the one involving the will of Hughes, a reclusive billionaire. Multiple wills surfaced.\n\"I won't say that I spent a lot of time on it,\" Perrin said, \"but from the time he died to us selling the company was 20 years, two months and six days.\"\nThe lawyer in Perrin surfaces when he's asked about the \"interim\" label. He immediately defers to Fenves.\n\"It means whatever he says it means,\" Perrin said.\nWatt sees possibilities.\n\"I think it could be an inspired choice because of his background and intelligence,\" Watts said. \"He's at the age that he might look for new worlds to conquer, and this would be a big world to conquer.\"\nTwitter: @ChuckCarltonDMN\nAbout Mike Perrin\nA look at Mike Perrin, named interim athletic director at Texas:\nHometown: Cameron\nResidence: Houston\nProfession: Attorney\nTexas connection: Played linebacker and defensive end for Darrell Royal from 1966-68, earning All-Southwest Conference honors. ... He received an undergraduate degree in math and then graduated from UT's School of Law in 1971. ... Perrin even owned Smokey the Cannon -- a staple at Texas home football games -- during the time the Texas Cowboys were suspended following the death of a student in the 1990s. ... His wife, Melinda, is the daughter of former Texas Supreme Court chief justice John Hill ... Named a \"Comer\" on Texas Monthly 's list of Texas power brokers back in 1987.\nBiggest asset: He's no stranger to Texas alumni and donors, who like and trust him.\nBiggest challenge: Rebuilding an athletic department that has lost a number of talented people and institutional knowledge the past two years; smoothing over the widespread discontent from the Patterson era.\nWhat others say: \"Mike's background as a player, a long-time supporter and a volunteer at UT -- as well as his successful career as an attorney and businessman -- was unique. There really was no one else who would have brought similar experiences, skills and relationships and who could connect immediately with alumni, student athletes, faculty and coaches.\" -- Texas president Greg Fenves.\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-10-08T02:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:25:57.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
