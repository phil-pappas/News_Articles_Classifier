Both the boys and girls teams qualified at sectionals on Saturdat, Oct. 10, 2015. By Karen Patterson Posted Oct. 13, 2015 at 7:34 PM Freeport, Ill. • Student Spotlight: Brooke Parkinson of Carl Sandburg Middle School... FREEPORT — Shane Orlow believes cross country should be fun. The fifth-year Freeport Middle School Co-op cross country coach has his runners train through games like capture the flag and other active team-oriented games early in the season. Keeping it light helps prevent burnout, he says. \"If you work them too hard, it's not fun and they quit the sport before they even get to high school,\" Orlow added. Orlow's methods aren't just fun for his athletes, they're also effective: both the boys and girls middle school cross country teams finished second at their sectional last Saturday to qualify for the Illinois Elementary School Association state finals this weekend. The members of the girls cross country team are Claire Giuffre, Julia Giuffre, Latonia Lacy, Ella Mercier, Chloe Rembisz, Nilaya Schulz, Haley Thies, Farah Tolu-Honary, Kiera Watson, Sarah Webster. The members of the boys cross country team are Jordan Brooks, Preston Engel, Will Giuffre, Brennyn Green, Mason Lei, Joe Mercier, Chris Metz, Bayley Pierce, Jayden Pierce, Andrew Wiesenberg. It is the ninth straight state finals appearance for the girls team, and third consecutive for the boys. Orlow said quite a few of the girls began training in June as a part of a summer running program to \"keep the tradition going,\" but he was pleasantly surprised by the boys' performance: of the 10 athletes, the team has only three eighth graders, and no seventh graders. Qualifying for state was a bit of a pleasant surprise, Orlow added. \"I'm telling them, 'You can be as good as you let yourselves be,'\" he said. A seventh grader, Lacy led the girls team with a personal-best time of 12:01 on Saturday, winning the overall division as well. Lacy said she was nervous, but it had little to do with the magnitude of the race. \"Within the same week my grandma died, so I wanted to win the race for her, and I was nervous that I wouldn't win,\" Lacy said. Orlow thinks Lacy and Metz—who won the boys division at sectionals with an 11:16— have a chance to earn all-state honors by finishing in the top 25 at state this weekend and thinks the teams have an outside chance to place near the top. Metz and Lacy also are optimistic. \"(State) is a lot of people and it's big, so I'm excited for that,\" Metz said. \"Some of the guys have become really good runners, especially the fifth graders who just started.\" Karen Patterson: 815-232-0133; Karen.patterson@Journalstandard.com ; @KarenP_FJS By Karen Patterson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:03:36.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
