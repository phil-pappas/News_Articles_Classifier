It was a bittersweet weekend for Griffioen, who certainly improved during her high school career for the Sturgis golf team. Her high school golf career started at Bedford Valley Golf Club a handful of years ago, on Saturday it came to an end on the same course. She shot rounds of 87 on Friday and 85 Saturday in poor golf conditions, finishing with a two-day total of 172 to finish tied for fifth among individual qualifiers at the Division 2 level. Griffioen’s score equaled the 19th best number out of the 90 golfers participating in the event. “I think there’s a bittersweet, yet poetic irony to ending my golf career on the same course I started it on,”she said. “My performance at state adequately sums up the improvements I’ve made over the past three years and I don’t regret it one bit.” Griffioen said she didn’t play her best golf last weekend, but she was still pleased with her ability to grind out holes. “Overall, I’m very pleased with my rounds, they were tolerable,”she said. “I’m only a little frustrated because I was NOT playing as well as I was capable of, but to not be on top of my game and have both rounds in the 80s is a win in my book.” Griffioen’s name is all over the Sturgis record books and the 85 Saturday tied the sixth-best score in school history. When she began playing for the Lady Trojans three-plus years ago Griffioen was eager to learn but not anywhere as good as she became over the final three years. Griffioen’s round of 85 was 35 strokes better than her first round for Sturgis, coach Ken Schau said, mentioning he was proud of her performances over the years. Griffioen’s first career round came at Bedford Valley. “In an individual sport, we stress TEAM and we like to talk about our TEAM accomplishments, however, Jessica has earned this recognition and her accomplishments speak for themselves,”he said. “She has worked very hard the last three years and deserves the accolades.” Griffioen broke the school record last week by shooting a 76 at Island Hills Golf Club, her home course, earning a regional championship. While the scores at the finals weren’t the same she stayed consistent enough to play well by both her and Schau’s expectations. Without the consistent play, especially on the greens, both of her rounds could have been much worse. “The conditions were really tough, but I ground through it and salvaged rounds that easily could have been in the 100s,”she said. “I’m satisfied with how I ended my career.” Page 2 of 2 - Griffioen said goals she accomplished this year included shooting a round in the 30s on nine holes, an 18-hole round in the 70s and having an average for the year in the 80s. Even with goals accomplished and her high school golf career coming to an end, Griffioen said it will probably take some time before it hits her. “I don’t think the sentimentality of the end of my high school career is going to hit me for a while,”she said. “I’m just glad I gave it my all until the end and enjoyed it while it lasted. It was an honor playing for Sturgis and I will miss it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:28:38.505+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
