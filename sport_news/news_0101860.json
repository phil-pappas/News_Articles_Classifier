Twitter opened the local office after acquiring Gnip in April 2014 . Gnip made sense of the massive amounts of public data available on social networks and sold the analysis to business clients. At the time, Gnip employed 85 .\nSince then, Twitter has added integrated the Gnip team into Twitter and continues to focus on data analysis in the Boulder office. The company currently has seven openings at the Boulder location.\nReached Tuesday, company officials declined to detail job cuts for regional offices, including Boulder, and instead shared a regulatory filing and Dorsey's letter to employees .\nAdvertisement In the letter, Dorsey said that Twitter will focus on \"experiences which will have the greatest impact,\" which includes the recently launched Moments . Moments feature images, videos and tweets representing a topic of special interest to the Twitterverse.\nBut Dorsey also hinted at which departments could be hardest hit by the job cuts: engineering.\n\"We feel strongly that Engineering will move much faster with a smaller and nimbler team, while remaining the biggest percentage of our workforce,\" he wrote.\nThe purge comes two weeks after Twitter brought back one of its co-founders as permanent CEO in hopes that Dorsey would be able to resolve problems that have slowed user growth at the messaging service and compounded an uninterrupted cycle of financial losses.\nCutting costs can boost profits but at Twitter, it has also raises uncertainty about the future, the company's pursuit of faster growth and its ability to attract a bigger audience.\nThe layoffs may be a sign of desperation at a sinking company, said Edison Investment Research analyst Richard Windsor.\n\"It is important to run a tight ship, but simply cutting jobs is often the action of a company that does not know what else to do,\" Windsor said.\nTwitter's workforce has nearly doubled over the past two years, hindering efforts to turn a profit for the first time in its nine-year history. Since Dorsey and his partners started the service, Twitter has lost nearly $2 billion.\nWhen reports of the anticipated layoffs surfaced late last week, investors initially fretted that Dorsey might be reacting to disappointing performance in the quarter that just ended in September. Twitter eased those worries Tuesday by disclosing that its revenue for the period will hit or slightly exceed its previously target of $545 million to $560 million. The official results are due out Oct. 27.\nTwitter's stock gained 99 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $29.74 in midday trading Tuesday.\nDorsey has acknowledged that Twitter is too confusing for many people to use, turning off new users at a time when other social services such as Snapchat and Facebook's WhatsApp have grown in popularity.\nAs part of its revival plan, Twitter last week unveiled a new feature called \"Moments\" that packages commentary, video and photos about major events that have captured people's attention. The work on Moments began while Dorsey's predecessor, Dick Costolo, was still Twitter's CEO.\nAfter returning as CEO, Dorsey promised to make Twitter even more accessible to the masses by next year. Jettisoning jobs will give Twitter more financial leeway while it designs new tools.\nTwitter's expenses through the first half of the year climbed 44 percent to $1.2 billion. The company's revenue totaled $938 million during the same period.\nRetrenching will cost Twitter $10 million to $20 million, mostly to pay for employee severance packages. The accounting charge for the reorganization is expected to be lower, ranging from $5 million to $15 million, because Twitter some of the departing employees will be losing stock options that didn't vest.", "external_links": ["http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000156459015008360/twtr-8k_20151012.htm", "http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000156459015008360/twtr-ex991_6.htm", "https://blog.twitter.com/2015/moments-the-best-of-twitter-in-an-instant-0", "https://about.twitter.com/careers/locations/boulder"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:01:58.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
