The kids continue to work to get better,” coach Kelley Sayahnejad said. “The Central Plains League has a number of tough teams that will push you to get better. If you take a step forward every week, the team will be in a position to compete at the end of the season.” The Bulldogs have taken more than their fair share of lumps in league play thus far. They’ve dealt with Conway, Trinity Academy and an improved Cheney squad. It isn’t that the Bulldogs aren’t trying to win every game, but there are some silver linings to be taken in the losses. Sayahnedjad said that, in some ways, the Bulldogs took a step in the right direction last week. Now, the Bulldogs are hoping for a payoff. They face a struggling Belle Plaine squad that hasn’t won a game this season, either. But the Bulldogs aren’t treating this game any differently just because it might seem more “winnable,”a term Sayahnejad, like any coach, doesn’t prefer to use because they want their team to know every game is winnable. “We have approached this game the same as any other. Our focus remains on us getting better at the things we are supposed to do. Belle Plaine will beat us if we don't continue to improve,” said Sayahnejad. The Bulldogs showed some consistency and a pretty significant improvement in the ground game against Conway last week. Quarterback Hunter Chadic rushed 17 times for 97 yards, a 5.6 yards-per-carry average. He had between 20 and 30 rushing yards per quarter against a stout Cardinals’ defense. Chadic did struggle passing a little bit by failing to make a completion in seven attempts while trying to evade a tough rush. Kye Wright added 69 yards on the ground on 13 rushing attempts (5.3). Dashon Arnold added 44 yards on nine carries. In all, Douglass rushed for 206 yards on 41 attempts, with an average of exactly 5,0 yards per attempt. And they didn’t put the ball on the ground with fumbles that led to turnovers, either. That’s a great step in the right direction. The Bulldogs finished with 63 penalty yards. Sometimes those can be dealt with, but other times they can be drive killers or help the opponent keep their drives going. More than anything, Sayahnejad doesn’t want to see the mistakes pile up and build up into more mistakes. “I think the keys for us are the same as every game. We have to play assignment sound, mistake free, and give great effort,” Sayahnejad said. “Battling adversity is an area we have to improve in. One mistake has to be one mistake. We can't allow one mistake to become 10 mistakes.” Page 2 of 2 - Belle Plaine won’t be a rollover team, though. The Bluestem Lions went back and forth with the Blue Dragons a couple weeks ago before getting a pick-six that helped seize control of that game. The Bulldogs might be getting big plays from their offense as much as their defense, though. Though it didn’t work last week, Douglass completed a couple big passes on the edges. Receivers Chase Banos and Arnold can be threats at any time.If the Bulldogs’ line can improve and allow the run game to get established, that will set up the big plays nicely.
