Fischer had three interceptions — including one he returned nearly the length of the football field for a touchdown — during a District 32-6A victory last week against Rivera. \nBut what his return to the defense means is something even bigger. \n“Knowing how important this football team is to him and to make a big impact in an important game, it was really special for me,” Brownsville Veterans coach David Cantu said. “I really think the world of Kevin.” \nFischer was a varsity receiver as a sophomore when an ACL injury ended his season. But he battled back to become a contributor with the secondary during his junior season. This year, while working on football-related drills, he injured his ankle days before practices were to start. His comeback was brief during a non-district game before he reaggravated the injury. \nThe senior has worked hard to get back to the field and seems to be making up for lost time. \n“I just wanted to be out there with my teammates because I missed it,” Fischer said. “They’re my brothers, and I wanted to be out there with them.” \nAndrew Crum covers sports for The Brownsville Herald.
