Hawryluk arrived just in time for Brandon’s game on Saturday, while Quenneville will make his WHL season debut this week. \nFor Jayce Hawryluk, the two points made it all worthwhile. Enlarge Image \nJayce Hawryluk, \nThe Brandon forward, who was reassigned to the team by the National Hockey League’s Florida Panthers on Friday, pulled into Swift Current, Sask., an hour before the Wheat Kings’ game against the Broncos on Saturday. \n\"It was probably the longest two days of my life,\" Hawryluk said. \nThe 19-year-old Roblin product had his flight home from Miami delayed and ended up staying in Detroit overnight. He caught an early flight on Saturday morning and arrived in Regina at 3 p.m., which left him 241 km from Swift Current. \nAfter being driven to the Credit Union iPlex, he finally rejoined the team an hour before the game, half an hour before warmup and with no time to focus. \n\"That whole day was a little bit of a writeoff but we got the win so that’s all that really mattered,\" Hawryluk said. \nHe was joined back in Brandon on Sunday by fellow 19-year-old John Quenneville, bringing home the last of nine Wheat Kings who attended NHL camps. \nQuenneville said after practice on Tuesday that he enjoyed his time with the New Jersey Devils. \n\"I was given a really good opportunity in New Jersey this year and I think that I took advantage of it real well,\" Quenneville said. \"It made for a great camp and an awesome experience overall.\" \n\"He treated me like he knew me for a long time,\" Quenneville said. \"I really appreciated the way that he kind of took me under his wing. He’s a good man. \n\"I’m so excited to be back,\" Hawryluk said. \"I have a lot of good friends here, some guys that are basically like my brothers. I’m excited for this year. \n\"Once I’m sent home from New Jersey I’m part of the Brandon Wheat Kings,\" Quenneville said. \"We have one goal here in Brandon, to win the Memorial Cup, and that’s my focus right now. \nBoth said that the lesson that they can bring back from NHL camp to their Wheat King teammates is the preparation that it takes to be a pro hockey player, whether it’ \nBut Quenneville said he thinks it’ \n\"I think that it’s less of a jump than it is for young guys coming in the ‘Dub’,\" Quenneville said. \"I think we’re all men and everybody’s playing the game the right way (in pro hockey). It makes it a lot easier for everybody else to play. \nHe’ \n\"You watch those guys on TV and then you go out there and you’re that close to that goal,\" Hawryluk said. \"You can just feel it. But there’s a lot of work still to be done. \nThere’s also much to be done before Quenneville and Hawryluk can fulfil their stated goal of hoisting the Memorial Cup. But they say a bitter lesson last spring will help. \n\"We were so close yet so far away,\" Hawryluk said. \" \n\"There’s a little fire inside all of us. \nICINGS: Wheat Kings C Tim McGauley has been listed on this week’ \n»", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:12:21.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
