Pointer/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 10:00 PM By T.D. Pointer/Daily News Correspondent Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 10:00 PM With a tip of the hat to Will Ferrell's “Zoolander” character Mugatu, Ol’ Pointer feels like he’s taking crazy pills! In the (edited) words of the late, great Vince Lombardi, “What the (heck)'s going on out there?” One need only see that Natick is 1-3 and Lincoln-Sudbury is 0-4 to know that these are strange times in Pointerland. Up is down, black is white, cats and dogs are starting small businesses together. Everywhere is Crazytown. And don’t get Pointer started on the eight-month root canal that was Deflateg — you know what? I won’t even say the word. And in case you stay strictly in the sports section (can’t blame you) and are unaware, human sideshow Donald Trump is running for president. Not only that, he is leading in Republican polls. This is the real-life equivalent of Newton South winning the Dual County League Large (Steve Burton’s son, Austin, is quite the QB, though). Cue Lombardi once again. Three yards and a cloud of dust became a six-yard swing pass and a cloud of field-turf pellets. We’ve got Milford Mighty Mites doing “Whips” and “Nae Naes” in the middle of games. I’d have Little Two-Point doing up-downs and running hills for such a thing. These are strange times, indeed. While Trump's presidential candidacy is lunacy (as is his hair that looks like someone tried to use the blur tool in photoshop) there is a grain of wisdom in his thinking. With that, here's your ol' friend's rallying cry. “Make Pointerland Great Again.” L-S and Natick will get started Friday night. Hope we can put the crazy pills away for a week. On to the picks … We’ve got another packed schedule this week, with 22 games on the slate (15 Friday night, 7 Saturday). And let me tell ya, there are some doozies. We’ll start in, of all places, Bolton, home of Central Mass. power Nashoba. The unbeaten Chieftains are welcoming in 3-1 Marlborough, whose one loss came on a last-second kick against Milford. In a case of unstoppable force (Marlborough’s 31.3 points a game) vs. immovable object (Nashoba’s 8.5 points allowed a game), T.D. likes the defense. It could be a classic, but Nashoba takes it. Then we go to Ashland, where the 3-1 Clockers host 4-0 Dover-Sherborn in a battle of resurgent programs. The pick doesn’t come easy, but we’re taking the scorching Raiders on the road. Staying in the Tri-Valley League, in an interdivisional matchup, Westwood heads to Millis-Hopedale. After a tough start, Millis-Hopedale is again finding its footing, and the Mohawks will take a close one at home. Also in the TVL Small, Norton will win at Bellingham. Page 2 of 2 - Moving to the TVL Large, Daily News dandy Holliston heads to Hopkinton in the battle of towns that take Beyonce’s “H-Town” anthems to heart. Holliston , a team that could probably run its offense with the lights turned off, is just too tough for the rival Hillers to overcome. Elsewhere in the TVL Large, Medfield will take out host Medway. The Scarlet Hawks of Milford, home of the aforementioned dancing Mighty Mites, are again at home. This time, the Scarlet Hawks host Hockomock Davenport foe Foxboro (4-0). Milford will always win the dance contest, but there will be two unbeaten teams with homes in Foxboro after this weekend (although T.D. can’t speak to the Foxboro Mighty Mites). In the Hockomock Kelley-Rex, look for Franklin to get over .500 with a win over King Philip. In the Bay State Conference, Natick will get a much-needed home victory over Dedham, while Framingham’s struggles may continue against Brookline at Bowditch Field. In the Dual County League Large, Lincoln-Sudbury will get its first ‘W’ by defeating Cambridge Rindge and Latin. In a non-league tilt, look for host Wayland to maul Masconomet. Also Friday night, host Hudson faces a tough test against fellow 2-2 squad Holy Name at Morgan Bowl. T.D. has a good feeling about those Hudson Hawks at home. In a Mid-Wach B battle, Algonquin will go over .500 when it grounds Groton-Dunstable for a road victory. In the Colonial Athletic League, Assabet heads to Fitchburg to face a tough Monty Tech squad. The hosts take it. On to Saturday, which is highlighted by a Bay State Conference Herget battle of W's, Walpole at Wellesley. The Rebels are never a walkover game, but Jesse Davis’ Raiders have been stout, and that trend continues in a thrilling win for Wellesley . Two local squads are welcoming two of the state’s well-oiled machines, as Westborough plays host to Leominster and Nipmuc says hello to Northbridge . Despite game efforts from those defending their respective turf, both visitors are too tough right now (to wit — Northbridge has yet to allow a point). Elsewhere, look for host Uxbridge to stay hot by slamming Southbridge, host Valley Tech to crush Quaboag, St. Bernard’s to bop Blackstone-Millville, and Tri-County to topple Diman. It’s a veritable pigskin lover’s paradise! Last Week: 17-4 T.D. Pointer is a Daily News Correspondent. By T.D. Pointer/Daily News Correspondent Milford Daily News By T.D.
