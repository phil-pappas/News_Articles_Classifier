She gives 100 percent in everything that she does. Her will to win and her will to compete are the things which help to make her a strong player.”A 5-foot 3 setter, Tello described herself as energetic on the floor.“I keep going,” Tello said. “I’m never going to give up and will always give 100 percent.”Tello, who is also a team captain, said her biggest improvement this season has been in the leadership department.“Nely has been in the program for four years now and she has been able to improve each and every year,” Putman said. “She has innate leadership abilities. She is looked up to by her teammates and she has earned that respect through hard work and dedication.”Whitney Howell and Caitlyn Wilbur are two beneficiaries of Tello’s solid play.“When I get a good enough pass and I know I’m able to set the front row, I will try to look out for my strongest hitter but if I’m not able to do that I also set the back row,” Tello said.For Tello, playing volleyball gives her a “rush” and feeling of “excitement” and her highlight of the season was the Lady Patriots’ 2-1 win over South Paulding on Sept. 1.Tello is also a member of the soccer team, filling the position of middleback.“I’ve always played soccer since I was little but every time during the offseason I’m always like ‘I wish it was volleyball season’ and the same thing for soccer,” Tello said. “Both sports keep me conditioned and ready for the next season.”Tello has a 3.5 grade-point average and wants to be a pediatric nurse. She said West Georgia and Kennesaw State are possible destinations for college.“If the chance is there for college volleyball I will take it,” Tello said.
