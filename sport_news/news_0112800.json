He has to be, given his gig as a studio analyst for TBS during the National League playoffs.\nBut in case you were wondering, son Darren Baker (remember him?) will be in New York for Game 1 on Saturday. And Papa said he'll be pulling for the Cubs.\n\"I don't tell him who to root for,\" Dusty Baker said. \"And he doesn't get paid by the network not to.\"\nObjectively, Baker said he believes \"everything favors the Cubs,\" starting with the Mets having to travel back from Los Angeles late Thursday/early Friday, whereas the Cubs have been getting R&R since polishing off the Cardinals on Tuesday.\nThe Cubs also have the psychological advantage of having beaten the Mets in all seven meetings this season.\n\"It helps,\" Baker said, \"but you don't know if the law of averages will work against you.\"\nIf the law of averages for the last century is in play, Cubs fans should be feeling good as Joe Maddon's team heads into this best-of-seven series.\nBaker, who won the National League pennant with the Giants in 2002 and took the Cubs to the postseason in 2003, lauded both managers.\nThe Cubs work out at New York's Citi Field.\n\"Both are deep thinkers and both have very good staffs,\" he said. \"Maddon has more playoff experience. Terry Collins has nothing to lose. He's like a little Chihuahua afraid of nothing.\"\nEven though Baker said the Mets are at a disadvantage after having to use Jacob deGrom and Noah Syndergaard to beat the Dodgers in Game 5, he said he would take their pitching staff over the Cubs'.\nBut it's no contest in the hitting department.\n\"The Cubs have seven or eight dudes in that lineup that can take you yard,\" Baker said. \"But you live by the sword, die by the sword. If you depend on the 3-point (shot) in basketball and you're cold, you have to have some inside game. If you're a passing team and have Darrelle Revis guarding you, you have to run some.\"\nBaker lauded the Cubs and Theo Epstein for doing what almost everyone found so objectionable at the time — hiring Manny Ramirez to work with the team's young hitters.\n\"Forget the personality, this guy is as knowledgeable a hitter as there ever was,\" Baker said. \"Manny is a student of hitting and a student of vision. Four or five years ago, he gave my son a couple of his training tools — rings with balls of three different colors.\"\nBaker said the tools worked for Darren, who is a long way from getting snatched from home plate by J.T. Snow as a 3-year-old in the 2002 World Series. Darren plans to attend California-Berkeley on a baseball scholarship.\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Cubs New York Mets Dusty Baker Joe Maddon National League San Francisco Giants Terry Collins", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5621ac5f/turbine/ct-dusty-baker-nlcs-tbs-greenstein-spt-1017-20151016", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5621a3c8/turbine/ct-cubs-practice-at-citi-field-photos-spt-20151016"], "published": "2015-10-17T05:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:52:54.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
