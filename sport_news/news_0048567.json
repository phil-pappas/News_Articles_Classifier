He was 62. \nMeyers died at his home in Temecula, Calif., after struggling with cancer for the last year, according to UCLA, which received the news from his younger sister, Ann Meyers Drysdale. \nHe played four years for Milwaukee after being drafted second overall by the Los Angeles Lakers. Shortly after, Meyers was part of a blockbuster trade that sent him to the Bucks in exchange for Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. \nThe 6-foot-8 Meyers led UCLA in scoring at 18.3 points and rebounding at 7.9 in his final season, helping the Bruins to a 28-3 record. He had 24 points and 11 rebounds in their 92-85 victory over Kentucky in the NCAA title game played in his hometown of San Diego. \nMeyers Drysdale also played at UCLA during her Hall of Fame career. \nMeyers assumed the Bruins' leadership role during the 1974-'75 season after Bill Walton and Jamaal Wilkes had graduated. Playing with sophomores Marques Johnson and Richard Washington, Meyers earned consensus All-American honors. Meyers made the cover of Sports Illustrated after the Bruins won the NCAA title. \n\"One of the true warriors in (at) UCLAMBB history has gone on to glory,\" Johnson wrote on Twitter. \"Dave Meyers was our Captain in '75 and as tenacious a player ever. RIP.\" \nJohnson recalled in other tweets how Meyers called him 'MJB' or Marques Johnson Baby when he was a freshman, and later in the NBA, Meyers was nicknamed \"Crash\" because he always diving on the floor for loose balls. \nAs a junior, Meyers started on a front line featuring future Hall of Famers Walton and Wilkes. \nMeyers was a reserve as a sophomore on the Bruins' 1973 NCAA title team during the school's run of 10 national titles in 12 years under Wooden. The team went 30-0 and capped the season by beating Memphis, 87-66, in the championship game, when Meyers had four points and three rebounds. \nIn 1975, Meyers, along with Elmore Smith, Junior Bridgeman and Brian Winters, was traded to Milwaukee for Abdul-Jabbar and Walt Wesley. \nDuring the 1977-'78 season, Meyers was reunited with Johnson on the Bucks and averaged a career-best 14.7 points. He missed the next year with a back injury. Meyers returned in 1979-'80 to average 12.1 points and 5.7 rebounds in helping the Bucks win a division title. \nBorn David William Meyers, he was one of 11 children. His father, Bob, was a standout basketball player and team captain at Marquette University in the 1940s. The younger Meyers averaged 22.7 points as a senior at Sonora High in La Habra, Calif. \nMeyers made a surprise announcement in 1980 that he was retiring from basketball to spend more time with his family. He later earned his teaching certificate and taught sixth grade for several years in Lake Elsinore, Calif. \nHe is survived by his wife, Linda, whom he married in 1975, and daughter Crystal and son Sean. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
