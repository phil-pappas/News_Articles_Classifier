Love, whose last game was April 26 against Boston in the playoffs when he separated his left shoulder, provided six points and four rebounds in 13 minutes of play. \nOn Sunday he displayed a new look with a curly hairdo and a black headband. But he also showed flashes of his old self to indicate it won't take long to find his stride. \n\"Kev has been down and out since Game 4 of the playoffs last year and he's worked very, very hard to come back,\" Cavaliers head coach David Blatt said. \"He's in good shape, he's in good basketball shape too and now it's time for him to get his rhythm and his game experience back.\" \nThe power forward nailed his first two field goals. Both of them were step-back jumpers over Luis Scola in low-post isolation sets. He missed his next five shots and was held out of the final two quarters. Blatt said his minutes would be at a minimum. \nOn the glass, Love demonstrated early on why he's so dangerous. His first defensive rebound led to his patented outlet pass to Matthew Dellavedova at halfcourt, where the guard lobbed to Timofey Mozgov for an alley-oop dunk. \nIt was an easy bucket in the span of four seconds. Those scoring opportunities have been absent this entire preseason. Blatt said the plan is for Love to sustain his rhythm and play in the friendly finale on Monday at The Q against the Dallas Mavericks. \n\"I'm just happy he's back,\" Blatt said \nMo Williams contributed 13 points and seven assists and Dellavedova supplied 12 points and five assists. Mozgov secured 11 rebounds and blocked two shots in 22 minutes. \nJonas Valanciunas led Toronto (4-2) with 12 points to go with four boards. Corey Joseph added 11 points and six assists off the bench. Former Cav Anthony Bennett tallied nine points. \nJ.R. Smith said prior to the game that he just wanted to his teammates to exit the contest injury-free. Well, that almost didn't occur. He left the game briefly in the middle of the first after turning his ankle draining a tough corner jumper. When Smith landed, he was in the midst of fans seated courtside. He may have stepped on someone's foot. \nBlatt immediately called a timeout to get Joe Harris in the game. Smith departed to the locker room for an evaluation and soon after, he was back out to start the second quarter. \nSmith finished with seven points on 3-of-6 from the field and also did not play in the second half. \nLeBron James, on the bench in Cavs' warmup gear, has only participated in two preseason games. Blatt hasn't completely ruled out his superstar joining Love in the Monday lineup. They could use the time together, but obviously health is first and foremost. \nThat delicate balance the Cavaliers have managed between rest and reps is why some believe they will struggle out of the gate. It could happen, but Blatt has history to lean on. \n\"It's a possibility, given the type of injury bug that we've had coming into the season, but you know, we didn't start out gangbusters last year and we finished up pretty good,\" Blatt said. \"So, I'm sure we'll be in a better way in terms of flow and continuity at the beginning of the season.\" \nAnderson Varejao will sit out Monday, according to Blatt. \nThe outcome of these exhibition games has been meaningless. Yet Blatt let it be known that his team's preseason showing hasn't been something he's content with. \n\"I haven't met a coach or a player yet that likes to lose,\" he stated.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:25:49.094+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
