Four games in, and the Chiefs are 1-3. Yeah, not what I anticipated, and definitely not what most fans expected. “I believe in this football team,” Andy Reid said. “I would tell you we’ve played good teams – that allows our young guys to get better. I feel that the season is not a four-game season, that’s not what it is. But at the same time, you have massive urgency every play to be better and we have to do that. Whether it’s coaching, whether it’s playing, we have to do a better job.” The Chiefs have the seventh hardest schedule this season, and the tough part started early. It began with the Denver Broncos in Week 2 followed by the Green Bay Packers and Cincinnati Bengals. The Chiefs went 0-3 against all three. OFFENSE ISN’T THE PROBLEM Yes, the offensive line has allowed 18 sacks, which is tied with the Seattle Seahawks for most in the NFL. Reid continues to tweak looking for his best five offensive linemen. Since the season started there have been multiple changes, and headed into Week 5 Reid switched it up again by reinserting Zach Fulton at right guard, where Fulton played every offensive snap last season. Still, despite how fluid the offensive line has been, Pro Football Focus ranked the Chiefs as their 10th best amongst offensive lines. “The offseason moves have worked, because Mitch Morse has hit the ground running, and Ben Grubbs has played better than anyone they had at guard last year,” Football Focus said. “There are some things to be decided, and it will be worth watching how Fisher plays as the season goes on, but it's been an impressive turnaround so far for the Chiefs.” Some think Smith holds onto the ball too long, which accounts for some of those 18 sacks. Fans like Chase Daniel because of what they saw in preseason. Daniel isn’t afraid to squeeze it in, and he’ll take a hit to complete a pass. Daniel plays with grit, and fans like that. I’d like to see Smith take more risks, and let his guys make plays. Put it out there, let it fly, and take a chance. The offense isn’t perfect, and pieces like tight end Travis Kelce aren’t getting used often enough, but the Chiefs have scored 100 points. That’s fourth best in the AFC, and ninth best in the NFL. Despite the offense not being all it can be, the Chiefs are averaging 25 points a game. Page 2 of 2 - The Chiefs have nine offensive touchdowns to the Broncos eight. The Chiefs have scored more total points and average more total yards per game than the Broncos. So yeah, the offense isn’t terrible. DEFENSE IS THE PROBLEM! This isn’t the same bunch I saw holding folks to less than 20 points a game last season. The Chiefs have allowed 30-plus points three games in a row, their worst defensive stretch since 1987. The Chiefs didn’t allow a single 30-point game last season. In their last three they’ve allowed 105 points, that’s 35 points per game. The Chiefs have allowed 125 points in four games, tied with the Chicago Bears for the second most in the NFL. At their current pace the Chiefs would allow 500 points, 60 points worse than the 2-14 Chiefs in 2008. The secondary is allowing 295 yards per game, fifth worst in the NFL. Last season the Chiefs allowed the second fewest points in the league, and had the second best pass defense. What’s separating the 1-3 Chiefs from the 4-0 Broncos? The Broncos allow 17 points a game, while the Chiefs allow 31. The real downer has been the defense, and a big reason why the Chiefs are 1-3. With Derrick Johnson and Mike DeVito back, I had no doubts. But not now, and it needs fixed. CHICAGO BEARS Both are 1-3, and both have given up the points, but the Chiefs have Arrowhead. “We’ve got a lot of veteran guys. So a lot of young guys look up to the vet guys, I think that we think we’re still one of the best teams in the league,” Jamaal Charles said. “We still have our confidence up there, we still go out there and - we’ve got to work. We have a good team, this team is not bad. The last three opponents we played were very tough, but every week is a different opponent. They (Bears) bring the same mentality as the other three teams we faced as well. So we’ve just got to go out there and play them and bring a lot of passion, a lot of energy and excitement to the game.” The Chiefs head into the easier part of their schedule, and a win would sure be nice.
