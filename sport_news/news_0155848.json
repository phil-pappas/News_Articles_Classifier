There's an opportunity there, definitely.\"\nWith two matches of the qualifying campaign remaining, Estonia remain in contention for a place at next year's tournament in France, but they have little margin for error.\nThey trail Slovenia by two points in the scramble for third place, which will yield a play-off berth, and if Slovenia defeat Lithuania on Friday and Estonia fail to beat England, Magnus Pehrsson's side will no longer be able to qualify.\n\"The chance is tiny and we face two great challenges,\" said Pehrsson, whose side finish their campaign at home to Switzerland.\n\"We need to win at Wembley and at home against Switzerland to make it. We'll need to prepare ultra well and produce a fantastic performance. Then the chance we've been working for will open up.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:03:55.938+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
