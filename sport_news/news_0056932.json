Nelson Each year, the UIL awards Lone Star Cups to six member high schools, one each from Class 6A through Class 1A. Schools earn points based on their results in UIL athletic and academic competitions, and Vandegrift totaled a Class 5A-best 95 points in 2014-15, surpassing second-place Aledo by nine points.\n“The UIL Lone Star Cup honors the best overall academic, athletic and music programs in the state of Texas,” the UIL’s executive director, Charles Breithaupt, said in a statement. “It takes contributions from every student, teacher and coach in all facets of UIL competition to win this outstanding award.”\nAnderson honors Yellow Jackets: Anderson High planned to bring together both Yellow Jackets and Trojans on Thursday night at Nelson Field.\nAbout 40 graduates of the original Anderson High, the segregated high school in East Austin for the city’s African-Americans, were expected to watch as the Trojans took on Lehman in a District 14-6A football game. A group of former Yellow Jackets who played for the original Anderson were to participate in the coin toss, sit in a reserved section at the 50-yard line and be recognized during the first half.\nThe former Yellow Jackets also were to receive a T-shirt adorned with both schools’ mascots and the words “Linking the past to enrich the future.”\nBefore a federal judge ordered the original Anderson High shut down in 1971 as part of desegregation efforts, the Yellow Jackets won four state championships in football as part of the Prairie View Interscholastic League.", "external_links": ["http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/22/35/c5/20150221_dsc_0487_tdn.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T22:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T07:46:41.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
