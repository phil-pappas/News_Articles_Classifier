The Red Raiders surrendered the game-winning touchdown on fourth down in a 55-52 loss to TCU last week.\nSecond, the venue. As senior linebacker Peter Robertson pointed out in postgame interviews, younger players were in awe of AT&T Stadium and its massive videoboard.\nAnd third, Baylor itself. The Bears came in leading the nation in scoring, total offense and rushing while Tech's defense came in with an average yield of 36 points per game.\nThose factors were evident in Baylor's 63-35 victory in the Texas Farm Bureau Shootout played before an announced crowd of 56,179.\nBaylor shredded Tech's defense for 680 yards, averaged nearly nine yards an offensive snap and scored touchdowns on eight of its first 10 possessions. Running back Shock Linwood rushed for 221 yards, averaging more than 11 yards a carry. Quarterback Seth Russell completed 15 passes for 286 yards.\nRobertson, a defensive captain who had six tackles, said the totals were unacceptable, but it's another learning experience for the defense.\n\"Baylor's good at their offense, and with an offense like that, you have to play sound and you have to play fundamental,\" Robertson said. \"And we made too many mistakes on the back end and the front end.\n\"They have the kind of athletes that if you give them any kind of room, they'll make a big play out of it.\"\nTech coach Kliff Kingsbury acknowledged that the defense struggled, but \"they are growing up.\"\n\"Last year, I don't know if they would have had that same fight, and they fought hard. It wasn't pretty.\"\nFreshman linebacker Dakota Allen had 13 tackles and strong safety Keenon Ward had 10 stops.\nTech's secondary was also thin with the presence of free safety Payton Hendrix and backups Jalen Barnes and Derrick Dixon. Hendrix was out with an illness.\n\"Not having that depth hurt us,\" Kingsbury said. \"Just because you'd like to run fresh bodies in there with that type of tempo and those type of weapons they have at wide receiver.\"\nTech also lost the turnover battle for the first time since facing Baylor in the final game of the 2014 season. In the first four games this season, the Tech defense forced eight turnovers. Against Baylor, Tech got only an interception from cornerback J.J. Gaines.\n\"You've got to try and create turnovers, which we did not -- and they did,\" Kingsbury said.\nPlaying in AT&T Stadium also contributed to Tech's slow start, Robertson said.\n\"That had a little bit to do with Jerry Jones and the big screen and the large crowd,\" he said. \"A lot of young guys got caught up in the glitz and glam. You got a lock on and really focus when you play great teams.\"\nHaving played back-to-back top-5 teams in TCU and Baylor, Tech has Iowa State next. The Cyclones routed Kansas 38-13 on Saturday.\n\"Everyone in the locker room is down right now, as they should be,\" said senior defensive end Branden Jackson, who had five tackles. \"But confidence isn't lost. We played a good team who had our number this week, and we'll forget this game and get on to next week.\"\nOn Twitter: @tommycummings\nBaylor 63, Texas Tech 35: Complete coverage\nBox score\nDiscuss this game and the Big 12 with Chuck Carlton on Thursday; ask questions now\nPhotos: Baylor shows up in grey, makes Tech pay in AT&T Stadium rout\nFive thoughts: Statement win for Bears?\nBaylor quotable: Art Briles says Bears 'trying to prove we belong'\nTownsend: Running Bears step over Tech on potential path back to Arlington\nBaylor's Linwood sets career high with 221 yards against Texas Tech\nFive thoughts: Sloppy play leads to another loss in the series\nTexas Tech quotable: Baylor WRs 'best group' Kingsbury has coached against\nTexas Tech defense has another lapse, allowing Baylor big yardage\nOn Twitter:\n @tommycummings", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/townsend-running-bears-step-tech-potential-path-back-arlington", "http://d-news.co/SYNiW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/baylors-linwood-sets-career-high-221-yards-texas-tech", "https://twitter.com/tommycummings", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/texas-tech-defense-another-lapse-allowing-baylor-big-yardage", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/texas-tech-quotable-corey-coleman-baylor-wrs-best-group-kingsbury-coached-seniors-rally-teammates", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/baylor-quotable-win-texas-tech-dominant-defense-exceptional-tough-red-raider-attack", "http://dallasnews.stats.com/cfb/boxscore.asp?gamecode=201510030079&home=79&vis=86&final=true", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesportsgallery/2015/10/03/photos-baylor-shows-grey-makes-texas-tech-pay-att-stadium-rout", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/03/five-thoughts-sloppy-play-paces-texas-tech-fifth-straight-loss-baylor"], "published": "2015-10-04T06:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:01:04.947+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
