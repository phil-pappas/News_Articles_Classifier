(Photo: Ben Twingley/btwingley@pnj.com) \nTwo months of practices at the University of West Florida have pushed into this moment. \nOf all the steps UWF has taken in a journey to begin a college football program, the biggest will be Saturday when the Argos play a full scale, intrasquad scrimmage on Fetterman Field at the Blue Wahoos Stadium. It will be a dress rehearsal in so many ways, both in relation to football operations as well as UWF seeking to present a fan experience ahead of the 2016 season debut. \nThere is free admission, free parking, too. The event is the third of five scrimmages this year and the only one at the bayfront stadium. \n\"This is the one we have been working on, this is the one we have been trying to get. This is huge,\" said UWF coach Pete Shinnick following the Argos' practice Wednesday. \"We want as many photos, as much video as we possibly can because this is our time to showcase the stadium. Pensacola economy gets boost from UWF \n\"The Blue Wahoos came out and put nice (artist) renderings of the stadium (when field is sodded next year) and we are very thankful for that.. At the same time, we can have those (images) and now here's what it could look like live. It will fun.\" \nAdding to the fun, UWF is expected to entertain between 30-40 high school prospects for the upcoming signing class. There will also be the chance for fans to look at potential seat locations for whenever the season-tickets go on sale. UWF will use the day to present a football experience inside and outside of the stadium. \nThe Argos' players have spent this week in an emotional buildup for Saturday. UWF's first scrimmage attracts crowd \n\"The way we are, it's through the roof right now,\" said running back Jaylon Hamer, an Orlando-Dr. Phillips HIgh grad, who has been one of the top offensive players in the two months of practices. \"We want to come out, work hard, be historic. We want the crowd to get into it. We want to make some big hits, some big runs, big catches, everything. \n\"We have been trying to hold back as much as we can, but are just ready to get out there and hit.\" \nHamer, along with defensive lineman John Williamson, are among the majority of UWF players who have visited the stadium and scouted the surroundings. \n\"The first college football team to play in Pensacola... on a field like that... so beautiful,\" said Williamson, a Spanish Fort (Ala.) High grad, who transferred from Nicholls State. \"It will be an awesome experience. Regardless of how many people are there, it is going to be pretty live.. When you think about just the stadium, the water is beautiful.. there is not a better setting for college football.\" \nRay Sayre, the Pensacola Blue Wahoos director of turf management, has worked all week with his staff, following last Saturday's annual Soul Bowl youth football games. They have painted the UWF logo at midfield and will dress the infield with the hashmarks and yard lines Friday. \nUWF players will board buses on campus early Saturday morning. They will have the first \"Argo Walk\" for supporters at 8:45 a.m. Saturday into the locker room areas. Part of the team will use the Blue Wahoos clubhouse as dressing room, the other will use the visitors clubhouse. Both are expansive enough to squeeze nearly 100 football players into the two areas. \nThe intrasquad scrimmage will be a simulated game. The only difference is the coaches will all stay on the field. The Gulf South Conference is sending one of its officiating crews to ensure UWF has a game experience with the same officials who will work games next season. \nUWF will rotate its three quarterbacks into running plays on both teams. \n\"The number one thing is I think it will be fun to be on a fast track,\" said Shinnick, referring to the quality of playing surface. \"And then we are going to have to deal a little bit with that infield and cuts and that kind of thing, but that's part of it.\" \nThat part of it will evoke memories for Shinnick. When he was a youth, his father, Don Shinnick, was an assistant coach on John Madden's staff with the Oakland Raiders. Just as they do now, the Raiders played in a baseball stadium (Oakland Coliseum) that had an infield surface. The Argos are mulling costs to completely sod the infield and warning track areas next year. \nThe players know this will be a one-time opportunity this year to make an impression with UWF football. \n\"People don't understand that we practice every day,\" Williamson said. \"It''s been an extended fall camp. So we have been busting our butts all the time. Something like this, people expect great things and we are going to give it to them. That;s what we have been working for.\" \nWANT TO GO?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T23:10:36.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
