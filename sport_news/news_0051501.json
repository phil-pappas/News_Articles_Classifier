Both teams averaged more than 40-points-per-game and combined for 95 in this one. And teams scored early touchdowns on fourth down plays. Skyline quarterback Dylan Mountain had a 23-yard scramble to the end zone to put the Tigers ahead 7-6. And the Comets then went back-ahead 12-7 on a fourth down 23-yard halfback pass from Jacob LaSalle to Rane Bateman. Both teams also had costly first half turnovers that led to touchdowns for the opposition. Skyline’s was a fumbled snap while Marionville had a muffed punt. Skyline led 23-18 at the half as the difference in the game was a 21-yard scramble by Mountain for a touchdown and a 35-yard field goal. But the real difference came with Skyline’s halftime adjustments. “We came in with a game plan that we were gonna pass it,” Mountain explained. “But they (Marionville) came out in a three-front so we were gonna look to run it and a lot more in the second half. And it worked.” “You could see there in the second quarter our fast-tempo started to pay big dividends,” Skyline head coach Brendon Shelby said. “So we just started gettin’ and going and gettin’ and going.” That gettin’ and going started just 41 seconds after the intermission when Chipper Berry’s 24-yard touchdown run made it 21-18 Skyline. Berry would end up with three touchdowns, all in the second half, with 155 yards rushing. Berry’s next touchdown came after a Josh Dansby interception set the Tigers up inside the Marionville 30 yard-line, and the resulting score put Skyline up 37-18 less than five minutes into the second half. By that point, the state’s second-ranked team knew that had a big mountain to climb to get back into it. But that mountain became insurmountable with another great scramble by Skyline’s Mountain as Dylan’s 33-yard trip to the summit made it 44-18 still in the third quarter. Mountain was just 6-16 passing for 66 yards but on the ground he had 15 carries for 157 yards and four touchdowns, much of it due to what he did scrambling under pressure from the Comets. “They did a good job of making me scramble and get out of the pocket,” Mountain said. “But I gotta give our receivers credit for blocking for me when I got to the second level. It made it easier for me to weave in-and-out and get the touchdowns.” And as for his amazing ability to find the opening while being harassed? “I don’t really see it,” Mountain replied. “But I feel it. I feel the pressure and start scrambling. It’s nothing that I look at and decide to run there. It’s a feel.” Mountain certainly had the “feel” on Friday night as the Tigers amassed 417 total yards and 35 second half points for a 58-37 win that ended a string of two consecutive losses to Marionville. And they also hope they earned some respect. “We felt like we were being called soft,” Mountain said. “So it gave us some comfort to go out there and hand it to ‘em.” “Every week we’re reading this-and-that that Skyline’s not physical,” Shelby added. “So we feel that we have something to prove every week. But it’s a life-lesson. Don’t let other people define you. I think our kids sent a really good statement tonight. That we’re more than just a bunch of fast guys running around out there. We have some grit to us that’s been our selling point all week.” Still, the Tigers, who made it to the state semifinals last year, know that looming in the post-season is Class 1’s top-team and perennial state champion Valle Catholic, the same team that knocked them out of play-offs last year 54-28. “We gotta make it to the state championship,” Mountain said of the team’s goals. “That’s what we’ve had our eyes on the whole season.” “We want to be playing our best football at the end of the season,” Shelby added. “Each week we want to play the best we’ve played so far but we don’t want to play our best until the end of the year. It was a great week for us because I really felt like our kids got better. You could tell and it really paid off.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:33:56.377+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
