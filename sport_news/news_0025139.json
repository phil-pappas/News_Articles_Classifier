Among many of the organizations in Atlanta, Raksha Inc. is a local nonprofit that is raising awareness and helping Georgia’s South Asian community when it comes to domestic violence and abuse.\nThere are approximately 100,000 people from India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Nepal who make up the South Asian population in the state. Started in 1995, Raksha has helped bridge the cultural gap for people seeking help in domestic violence situations from this region and beyond.\n“Raksha has been able to close a lot of the cultural and language barriers that are present for victims seeking help from their abusive situation,” said Aparna Bhattacharya, executive director of Raksha. “Most of the people we help have immigrated to the United States and the South Asian cultures are very traditional. Immigration, language and culture are also very sensitive areas to navigate especially in domestic violence situations and we provide that assistance to help men, women and children.”\nRaksha hosts financial management training through one of its programs aimed to build a healthier and safer South Asian community.

The community came to support Raksha on Oct. 3 for its annual fundraiser, Ek Shaam Rakshe Ke Naam (An Evening in the Name of Raksha) at the Rialto Center for the Arts. The event raised funds for its programs and spread awareness about domestic violence issues in Georgia’s South Asian community. Raksha means “protection” in Hindi, India’s official language.\nThe organization helps men, women and children through various services such as legal advocacy, counseling and emergency assistance. Although a majority of Raksha’s clients go through are domestic/family violence related issues, it also assists clients in other matters including sexual assault, immigration and assimilation.\nLast year, the organization served over 500 people through its various programs, and the need for volunteers is more important than ever.\nPeople can get involved with the Himmat (Courage) Program that provides direct services and advocacy to domestic/sexual violence survivors such as referrals to pro-bono attorneys, assistance with health and housing needs; the Youth Program that aims to break the cycle of violence; the Economic Empowerment promotes self sufficiency; and the Training and Technical Assistance educates government officials, community members and other non-profits through advocacy.\n“The more we can educate people and make them aware of these issues in our various communities, the more change we can affect,” she added. “Together, we can really make an impact in domestic violence issues not only in the South Asian community, but the community as a whole.”\nIn other news: The DeKalb Library Foundation’s fundraising event, A Novel Affair: Books & Bites raised $25,000 on Sept. 24 to support DeKalb County Public Library programs and services. Guests raised $6,500 during a Fund-A-Need to support the Library’s new 1000 Books Before Kindergarten family reading initiative which will kick-off in early 2016.\nWho’s doing good?Each Tuesday, we write about charity events such as fun-runs, volunteer projects and other community gatherings that benefit a good cause.
