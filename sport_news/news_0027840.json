Human Trafficking Crackdown Nets 8 Arrests in Bay Area Daniel Murphy did all the damage for the Mets, knocking in two runs and scoring the game-tying run on the most bizarre of plays: With the Dodgers leading 2-1 and Murphy on first base, Zack Greinke issued a walk to Mets slugger Lucas Duda. Murphy casually walked to first, but smartly saw LA's infield was in a shift and nobody was covering third base. Murphy touched the bag at second and took off for third stealing the base easily. â€” ESPN Stats & Info (@ESPNStatsInfo) October 16, 2015 One batter latter, Murphy would score on a sacrifice fly to right field, tying the winner-take-all game at 2-2.

The Dodgers would not score another run after the first inning, and the Mets would celebrate thanks to Murphy's heroics. Murphy's solo home run in the sixth inning joins him with Darry Stawberry and Ray Knight as the only Mets to homer in a winner-take-all game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T13:59:34.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
