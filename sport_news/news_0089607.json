Yaron Finkelman,\" the IDF said.\nOn Thursay, the Southern Command Headquarters chief, Brig.-Gen. Udi Ben Mohad, accepted Finkelman's position, that the officer had failed in his duties, and should be ejected from his position.\n\"The Ground Forces will examine the continuation of the officer's service,\" the military added.\nLast week, MK Nachman Shai (Zionist Union) wrote a letter to Defense Minister Moshe Ya’alon, demanding that he instruct the IDF to investigate the incident and make it clear that such behavior must change.\n“It cannot be that IDF soldiers harm and attack members of the press,” Shai said. “The press’s job is to be everywhere all the time. It is an inseparable part of reality. Breaking cameras and violence teaches the journalists that the soldiers and their commanders do not understand the basic values of democracy and, first and foremost, freedom of expression.”\nVideo captured from the incident showed two men wearing helmets and flack jackets marked press, and a soldier can be seen throwing one of their cameras to the ground and breaking it.\nThe two photographers then walk away, but a soldier runs after them, a jeep pulls up, and other soldiers come out. Again, the soldiers take one of their cameras and break it.\nThe Foreign Press Association issued a statement denouncing the conduct of the soldiers.\nTovah Lazaroff and Jerusalem Post Staff contributed to this report.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T19:43:44.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
