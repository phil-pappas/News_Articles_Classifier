Here’s what you need to know about today’s game.\nFirst pitch: 8:10 p.m. ET\nVenue: Globe Life Park, Arlington\nWeather forecast: 31C, sunny.\nStarting pitchers: RH Marco Estrada (13-8, 3.13) vs. LH Martin Perez (3-6, 4.46)\nTV: Fox Sports-1, simulcast in Canada on Sportsnet.\nProjected lineups:\nBlue Jays\nBen Revere – LF\nJosh Donaldson – 3B\nJose Bautista – RF\nEdwin Encarnacion – DH\nTroy Tulowitzki – SS\nChris Colabello – 1B\nRussell Martin – C\nKevin Pillar – CF\nRyan Goins – 2B\n-\nRangers\nDelino DeShields – CF\nShin-Soo Choo – RF\nPrince Fielder – DH\nMitch Moreland – 1B\nJosh Hamilton – LF\nRougned Odor – 2B\nElvis Andrus – SS\nChris Gimenez – C\nHanser Alberto – 3B\n-\nPEREZ VS. RIGHT-HANDED BATS\nThe Rangers’ 24-year-old lefty has been hit hard by right-handed hitters this season — a .304 batting average and .777 on-base-plus-slugging percentage, compared to a .210 and .537 mark against lefties — which bodes well for the Jays’ primarily right-handed lineup.\nESTRADA’S CHANGEUP\nEstrada has one of the best changeups in baseball and the pitch, which typically sits at about 78 mph, is his most dangerous weapon. Opposing batters have hit just .184 off Estrada’s changeup this season while swinging and missing more than 20 per cent of the time.\nLOUP, THERE IT IS\nThe Jays’ bullpen suffered a devastating loss Friday when Brett Cecil, the team’s top reliever throughout the second half of the season, tore his left calf muscle. With Cecil gone for the season, side-arming left-hander Aaron Loup will be pressed into more high-leverage duty. While this has been a disappointing season for the 27-year-old — who seems to unnerve Jays’ fans more than any other pitcher — over his four big-league seasons he has held left-handed hitters to a trim .206 batting average and paltry .555 OPS.\n-\nPlayers to watch\nJosh Donaldson: The Jays’ third baseman, a former divisional foe of Texas from his time in Oakland, has faced Perez more than any other Blue Jay. He’s 5-for-13 against him in his career with three doubles and a home run.\nMitch Moreland: The Rangers’ platooning first baseman should get the start ahead of Mike Napoli today and though the sample size is small, Moreland has fared well against Estrada in his career. He’s 3-for-5 vs the Jays’ right-hander with two singles and a homer.\nMore on thestar.com\nBlue Jays fans making trip to Texas for Game 3\nThe Interview: Gregg Zaun on Jays in the playoffs, Don Cherry, fashion sense", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T22:56:29.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
