Le’Veon gave us an opportunity to win, and we were trying to do everything we could to move the football.”\nThe Steelers’ last-second touchdown helped the NFL avoid another referee controversy. A week after the refs opted not to call a batting violation against the Seahawks in a Monday night win over the Lions, the clock operator allowed 18 seconds to tick off the clock before the Steelers’ final drive.\n“Didn’t change the outcome of the game,” Tomlin said.\nThe NFL told Pro Football Talk they are reviewing the play and would have comment soon.\nBell said it was the most meaningful touchdown of his three-year career. “The game-winner on the last play of the game, that’s what you dream about,” he said.\n“‘I got to get it in,” Bell said. “We still had a timeout left. I was thinking we still have a timeout left, so I’m thinking, ‘OK, maybe if I get stopped, maybe run like 4 seconds off and get a timeout and we could kick a field goal. I wanted to end the game right there.”\nThere was no way Tomlin was going to kick a field goal to force overtime.\n“We have to run the football. We have Le’Veon Bell. We had an opportunity to win the game,” Tomlin said. “We’re on the road in a hostile environment, we’ve got to play to win and that’s what we did.”\n \n  nfl ,  pittsburgh steelers ,  referees ,  san diego chargers", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:27:29.092+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
