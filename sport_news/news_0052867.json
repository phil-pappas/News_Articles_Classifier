Welcoming the noted Pakistani ghazal singer Ghulam Ali at his official residence here today, Yadav said \"art, literature and culture are the joint heritage of the entire humanity and no politics should be done on artists' talent\". \"Art and artiste cannot be linked to any specific region or religion... boundaries of countries cannot impose limitations on them,\" he said. The Chief Minister felicitated the ghazal singer on the occasion and thanked him for accepting his invitation and agreeing to perform here. Earlier this week, a programme of the Pakistani singer was cancelled by the organisers in Mumbai after Shiv Sena threatened to disrupt the concert if Ali performs there saying the singer belonged to a country which was firing bullets at Indians. â€” PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:16:28.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
