Both teams enter this game tied at 2-1, and this year has been quite the turnaround for the Eagles. \nThis time last year, Lindale was 1-2 and finished as one of the weaker teams in district at 2-5. Lindale is a much improved team this year, showing they have a back bone to them and Lufkin's preparing to avoid the mistakes they made last Friday night against a team you can't underestimate. \n“We had some turnovers that cost us there. There was one scoop and score that put them up by two scores. We didn't play real clean and we can't do that versus good teams,” said Lufkin head coach Todd Quick. \nQuick acknowledged Lindale has come out this year as a playoff contender with their effective schemes. \n“With Lindale, they've done a real good job this year. They're really good defensively. The kids play hard and they get after it. Offensively they do some things that spread you out and then they get in that tackle over stuff that causes a little bit of alignment problems defensively. We're really going to have to be focused on what we're trying to do to find the people that are eligible and be able to get lined up,” said Quick. \nPanthers will be home for back-to-back weeks as they host Lindale this Friday for their homecoming game. Kickoff will be at 7:30 p.m. \nCopyright 2015 KTRE. All rights reserved.
