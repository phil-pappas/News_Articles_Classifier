(AP) - A research team from a New York college says a Revolutionary War battle fought in the upstate wilderness was more significant than historians originally thought.\nThe Post-Star of Glens Falls reports ( http://bit.ly/1k1utMu ) that Binghamton University's Public Archaeology Facility spent the past year researching the Battle of Fort Anne, fought over two days in July 1777 in what is now the Washington County town of Fort Ann.\nAmerican regiments fought British troops that were part of Gen. John Burgoyne's army advancing toward Albany.\nThe Binghamton researchers say contemporary documents show the battle delayed Burgoyne's march, which played a key role in his eventual defeat at Saratoga.\nThe research was funded by a grant from the American Battlefield Protection Program. The researchers hope to conduct an archaeological dig on the battle site.\nInformation from: The Post-Star, http://www.poststar.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1k1utMu"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:35:06.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
