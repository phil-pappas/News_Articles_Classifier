Marcus Johansson added a power-play goal with 7:16 remaining – assisted by Ovechkin – and Matt Niskanen scored an empty-net power play goal with 2:53 left to make it 5-2. \nDevils left wing Mike Cammalleri was credited with a goal with 1:21 remaining when Washington’s Jason Chimera accidentally put the puck in his own net, but it still added up to an 0-2-0 start for the Devils under Hynes, their rookie head coach. \nAfter being unhappy with how his team played in a 3-1 season-opening loss to Winnipeg Friday night at Prudential Center, Hynes decided to shake up his lineup. Out came defenseman Damon Severson and forwards Reid Boucher and Tuomo Ruutu and in went Eric Gelinas and forwards Brian O’Neill and Stefan Matteau. \nHynes also decided to give backup Kinkaid the start instead of going to Cory Schneider on back-to-back nights to open the season. \nThe Devils drew the first power play of the night when Evgeny Kuznetsov was sent off for hooking Jiri Tlusty at 10:24, but the Caps were the team to cash in with a shorthanded goal from Jason Chimera at 12:04. The Devils’ troubles began when Travis Zajac was pulled down and lost the puck in the neutral zone while his teammates were going for a change. Although they the puck out of their zone after that, they never really recovered. \nChimera threw+ a pass in front intended for Justin Williams, but Devils right wing Jordin Tootoo reached in with his stick to deflect it away and redirected it past goaltender Keith Kinkaid instead. \nDefenseman Brooks Oprik made it 2-0 by beating Kinkaid between the pads from the slot at 14:32. \nJust when it appeared it was going to be a long night for the Devils, they answered only 22 seconds later with a goal from Adam Henrique. Tlusty made the pass from the right wing to Henrique alone in the slot and Henrique beat Braden Holtby over the right shoulder for his first goal of the season. Kyle Palmieri also assisted for the Montvale native’s first point as a Devil. Tlusty has a goal and an assist in the first two games of the season. \nThe Devils got another chance on the power play when Sergey Kalinin drew a holding penalty on Sean Collins with 3:26 left in the period. This time they converted and tied the game with goal from Gelinas with 2:20 remaining in the first. \nLee Stempniak got the puck back to Gelinas for a straight-on point shot that screamed in past Holtby on the stick side for his first of the season. \nThe Capitals were the better team in the second period, outshooting the Devils 11-5 after being outshot 11-6 in the first. Kinkaid was sharp, though, and kept the score tied at 2. \nKinkaid was particularly good during a Caps’ 5-on-3 power play for 1:38 following a Gelinas crosscheck with 5:21 left in the period and a Stempniak hold with 4:59 remaining, making five saves. His best was a blocker stop on T.J. Oshie’s backhand on a breakaway with 3:49 left. \nAfter exiting the box, Gelinas made a quick pass ahead to Adam Henrique to send him in on a shorthanded breakaway, but Holtby outwaited him and made a right toe save with 3:14 left. \nBriefs: O’Neill played in his first NHL game. The 27-year-Yale grad was acquired in Tuesday’s trade Los Angeles. … The Devils have the next two days off before hosting Nashville Tuesday night.
