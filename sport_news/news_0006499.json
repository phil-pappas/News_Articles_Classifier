Her attorney asked that she be placed there only if necessary because he didn't want her to be isolated.\nThe lawyer didn't respond to a message from The Associated Press seeking comment.\nProsecutors say Fearon threw Jahnyla Lawrence naked from the window to her death as her other children watched in horror.\nThe case is the third in three months in which a mother has been accused of throwing her infant out a window.\nThis story has been corrected to show the spelling of the girl's name is Jahnyla, not Janillah, based on updated information from prosecutors.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:57:44.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
