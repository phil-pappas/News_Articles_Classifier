South of the Border won 8-6 for its second straight title and third in four years. \nWaldoboro — Perhaps now, as two-time defending champions and league winners in three of the past four years, the 2015 Waldoboro Recreation Department adult coed softball titlists should treat themselves to a nice fall vacation to, of course, somewhere south of the border. \nIn a championship game that included sensational fielding, powerful, timely hitting and aggressive base running by both teams — as well as a few close calls for good measure — two of the top squads during the regular season put on quite a diamond show in the league finale on Sunday, Oct. 4 at Medomak Valley High School. \nNo. 1 South of the Border edged No. 3 Hilltop Stop 8-6 in the title clash on a beautiful early-fall day to culminate a weekend of postseason softball on several fields in the town. \nWhile Saturday's weather proved blustery and cold for a slew of early-round games, Sunday was just the opposite with sunshine, low wind and temperatures in the mid-50s. \nAnd South of the Border, which won its second straight league title and third in four years, and Hilltop Stop brought their \"A\" games to the final contest of the season. \nIn the end, the defending champs proved a couple of runs better. \nA link to more photos from the championship game will appear later with this story. \nSee more photos below. \nSouth of the Border finished the season 15-1 overall, including 4-0 in the playoffs, while Hilltop Stop ended 11-6, including 3-2 in the postseason. \nThe teams had met earlier in the playoffs, as South of the Border pulled out an 8-7, 8-inning victory to remain in the winner's bracket. \nSouth of the Border includes Erin Chase, Gordon Simmons, Eric Hunt, Jeremy Byrd, Jessica Veilleux, Dylan Maloney, Steven York, Carlos Arteaga, Ashley Geel, Mike Jameson, Mike Young, Jared Simmons, Keith Simmons, Dwayne Neubig, Andrew Simmons, Jimi Hunt and Sarah Cowan. \nIronically, Chase also was on Maine Cat, the championship team in the Camden Adult Coed League this summer, and many of the other players on South of the Border were members of Simmons Lobster Wharf, the championship team in the Rockland Area Men's Softball League over the summer. \nHilltop Stop includes Roland Peaslee, Jody Anderson, Miranda Achorn, Morgan Achorn, Timmy Cook, Nate Lee, Harold Anderson, Jeremy Green, Zeb Potter and Shane Reichard. \nIn the Sunday's championship game, which took a lightning-quick 40 minutes to play, there were several home runs hit and few robbed. Strong defense was played by those on both teams, including from the always stellar and acrobatic Arteaga at shortstop, as well as Neubig at second base and outfielders Maloney and York for South of the Border and second baseman Morgan Achorn, third baseman Lee and right fielder Reichard for Hilltop Stop. \nSpecific hits were not recorded, but South of the Border was led by Maloney (hit, run), Chase (3 hits), Neubig (3 hits, 2 runs), Veilleux (2 hits), Arteaga (2 hits, run), Geel (2 hits, run), York (hit, run), Byrd (hit, run), Young (2 hits, run), James (hit) and Hunt (2 hits). \nLeading Hilltop Stop were Potter (hit, run), Morgan Achorn (hit, run), Peaslee (2 hits, run), Miranda Achorn (hit, run), Green (hit, run), Jody Anderson (hit), Reichard (hit), Harold Anderson (hit), Cook (hit) and Lee (hit, run). \nSouth of the Border turned a nifty double play in the top of the seventh inning to quickly snuff any plan Hilltop Stop had of mounting a rally. \nJameson pitched for South of the Border and Peaslee for Hilltop Stop. \nThe double-elimination tournament was played Saturday and Sunday, Oct. 3-4. Other scores from the playoffs may be added later to this story. \nLeague games were played late-August through early October. There was 10 teams in the league this fall and games were played on fields at Medomak Valley High School, Medomak Middle School and John Foster Little League Field. In the past, games also were played in Friendship and A.D. Gray in Waldoboro. \nThe final regular-season standings, with place, team, record, winning percentage and runs allowed, were: South of the Border, 11-1, .916, 31 runs allowed; Knox County Benchwarmers, 10-2, .833, 79 runs allowed; Hilltop Stop, 8-4, .667, 74 runs allowed; Lash Realty, 8-4, .667, 99 runs allowed; Bench Jockeys, 7-5, .583, 81 runs allowed; Hatch Well Drillers, 6-6, .500, 95 runs allowed; Empty Pitchers, 4-8, .333, 90 runs allowed; Hi-Tek Drillers, 4-8, .333, 109 runs allowed; Maine-ly Pawn, 1-11, .083, 186 runs allowed; and Rising Tide, 1-11, .083, 221 runs allowed. \nSeeding tiebreakers included total wins, head to head, least runs allowed, coin flip, mercy-rule loss and forfeit wins. \nThe scores from regular-season games were: Hatch Well Drillers 12, Empty Pitchers 3; South of the Border 7, Hilltop Stop 0 (forfeit); Knox County Benchwarmers 11, Bench Jockeys 9; Lash Realty 7, Maine-ly Pawn 4; Hi-Tek Rednecks 22, Rising Tide 5; Hatch Well Drillers 9, Hi-Tek Rednecks 5; South of the Border 20, Lash Realty 1; Bench Jockeys 7, Hilltop Stop 0 (forfeit); Empty Pitchers 13, Mainely Pawn 7; Lash Realty 11, Hatch Well Drillers 6; Knox County Benchwarmers 15, Rising Tide 1; Empty Pitchers 11, Hi-Tek Rednecks 7; South of the Border 7, Hilltop Stop 0 (forfeit); Knox County Benchwarmers 30, Maine-ly Pawn 5; Hilltop Stopo 6, Hi-Tek Rednecks 5; Rising Tide 15, Maine-ly Pawn 9; Bench Jockeys 9, Hatch Well Drillers 3; Knox County Benchwarmers 6, South of the Border 4; Lash Realty 7, Empty Pitchers 0 (forfeit); Bench Jockeys 23, Rising Tide 4; Hatch Well Drillers 19, Maine-ly Pawn 7; Knox County Benchwarmers 15, Hatch Well Drillers 14; South of the Border 22, Rising Tide 0; Lash Realty 15, Hi-Tek Rednecks 8; Bench Jockeys 14, Empty Pitchers 3; Hilltop Stop 8, Empty Pitchers 5; South of the Border 7, Hi-Tek Rednecks 2; Hilltop Stop 18, Lash Realty 11; Bench Jockeys 20, Rising Tide 3; Hatch Well Drillers 26, Rising Tide 2; Lash Realty 11, Bench Jockeys 4; Hilltop Stop 10, Knox County Benchwarmers 8; Knox County Benchwarmers 16, Bench Jockeys 0; Hi-Tek Rednecks 18, Maine-ly Pawn 3; South of the Border 9, Bench Jockeys 5; Knox County Benchwarmers 21, Hi-Tek Rednecks 7; Empty Pitchers 10, Rising Tide 2; Hilltop Stop 9, Maine-ly Pawn 2; South of the Border 10, Hatch Well Drillers 4; Bench Jockeys 19, Maine-ly Pawn 9; Hilltop Stop 26, Rising Tide 1; Knox County Benchwarmers 24, Lash Realty 8; Maine-ly Pawn 9, Rising Tide 8; Hatch Well Drillers 11, Bench Jockeys 7; South of the Border 15, Knox County Benchwarmers 3; Empty Pitchers 7, Lash Realty 2; Hilltop Stop 8, Hi-Tek Rednecks 5; Lash Realty 7, Hilltop Stop 0 (forfeit); South of the Border 7, Empty Pitchers 3; Hatch Well Drillers 8, Empty Pitchers 0; Lash Realty 15, Maine-ly Pawn 7; Hi-Tek Rednecks 17, Rising Tide 2; Hilltop Stop 14, Hatch Well Drillers 9; South of the Border 22, Maine-ly Pawn 3; Knox County Benchwarmers 10, Hatch Well Drillers 4; South of the Border 8, Empty Pitchers 4; Knox County Benchwarmers 8, Empty Pitchers 2; Bench Jockeys 17, Hi-Tek Rednecks 3; and Lash Realty 15, Rising Tide 1.
