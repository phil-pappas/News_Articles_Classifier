He said spending more time with his family also is a factor.\nHarrelson originally said he was going to cut back on broadcasts last season before working an almost full schedule. He is a two-time finalist for the Ford C. Frick Award, given to broadcasters for major contributions to baseball.\nA Sox spokesman said the club is not yet ready to announce their broadcasters for the 2016 season. Ed Farmer and Darrin Jackson are expected back in the Sox radio booth as broadcasts move to WLS-AM 890 next year.\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612c3d5/turbine/ct-white-sox-hawk-harrelson-reduced-schedule-20151005"], "published": "2015-10-05T21:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:48:25.764+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
