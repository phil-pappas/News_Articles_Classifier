Image 11 of 11 Nike camp start of big cross country season for Aidan Tooker 1 / 11 Back to Gallery \nSaratoga Springs \nAidan Tooker was intrigued each summer when the automated email would arrive from Nike announcing which runners had been selected to participate in the company's Elite Camp in Oregon. \nTooker, a senior at Saratoga, always dreamed his name would be among the selected distance runners from around the country asked to train with the best of the best in Portland. \nWhile checking his email earlier this summer, Tooker saw an email from Nike — only this time, the correspondence was personally addressed to Tooker, extending him the invitation he'd dreamed about. This is a TU+ story. Click for more information. \nTooker had risen to become one of Section II's top runners, but the email was a sure sign he was earning national attention, too. \n\"I did a little freakout for sure,\" Tooker said. \"I was so excited. They just wanted to confirm that I could go.\" \nTooker was one of 10 male athletes from around the country selected for the camp. \n\"It's a big thing in the running community in social media every summer. I'd see it go by, with video and pictures,\" Tooker said. \"Since freshman year, it has been a joking dream that I'd ever think that it was reasonable. I started thinking. I'd imagine I'd be up there and thought, 'Hey, you never know.'\" \nThe camp included instruction from former NCAA cross country champions Pat Werhane and Simon Bairu, providing Tooker with an unforgettable experience. \n\"Every day, we had a sit down where they would lecture us and bring someone in, like a former NCAA champ, or a specialist who works for Nike — a nutrition day, a mental preparation day and questions and answers with some of the pros,\" Tooker said. \n\"The things they did for us were unbelievable.\" \nTooker returned from Oregon and was ready to go for the start of the cross country season. \n\"It makes you zoom out and think big picture,\" Tooker said. \"That was a pretty cool thing, knowing that there are people all across the country doing the same thing you are doing, with the same priorities.\" \nThe high expectations Tooker faced entering his senior season were validated with early-season wins at the Springstead Invitational by 36 seconds and then a 52-second spread at the Queensbury Invitational against quality competition. \n\"I've been successful doing what I've been doing, so I don't expect to change it or put a lot of pressure on myself,\" Tooker said. \"Doing what I've been doing has been working,\" \nTooker recently ended his college recruiting process with a commitment to Syracuse. \n\"The cross country guys ran unbelievably well the day before (the commitment) at a meet in Boston,\" Tooker said. \"I decided it was time, and I thought that program was going somewhere. It is where I wanted to be. It's a pretty cool thing.\" \nCool and calm always has been the way for Tooker. \nThat demeanor, along with his talent, figure to ensure that as future doors will open for Tooker. And he'll be running, not walking, through the openings. \nSean Martin , a local freelance writer, is a frequent contributor to the Times Union .
