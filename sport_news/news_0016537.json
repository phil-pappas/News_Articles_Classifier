After finishing in third place in the National League Central, the Cubs have beaten the two teams that finished ahead of them in the division — the Pittsburgh Pirates and the St. Louis Cardinals — in back-to-back rounds. Chicago advanced to the NL Championship Series with a 6-4 victory over the Cardinals in Game 4 of the NL Division Series on Tuesday night, leading President Obama to congratulate the team from the North Side: The Cubs appreciated the support: You may recall that President Obama chose not to follow the Cubs when he first joined Twitter earlier this year.
