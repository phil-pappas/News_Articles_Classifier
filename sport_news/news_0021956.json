(USATSI) South Carolina coach Steve Spurrier had decided to retire, ending his storied career at the age of 70, according to Thayer Evans of Sports Illustrated . Spurrier reportedly told the team of his plans Monday evening, informing them that an interim coach will be announced Tuesday, according to Josh Kendall of The State .\nSpurrier's Gamecocks fell 45-24 to LSU on Saturday, moving South Carolina to 2-4 (0-4 SEC) on the season.\nHis college coaching career will end with a record of 228-89-2 combined in 26 seasons at Duke (three), Florida (12) and South Carolina (11).\nHere are five things to know about the retirement of Spurrier, including what it means for the Gamecocks and world of college football\n1. Spurrier previously said he was far from done. South Carolina's horrid start undoubtedly played in to Spurrier's decision. Not only have the Gamecocks lost four of their last six games, they've been outscored 137-76 in those contests.\nIn July, addressing growing media speculation that he was near the end of his career, Spurrier held an impromptu press conference. \"I plan on coaching a long time,\" he said matter-of-factly. Spurrier's comments were in large part to help with recruiting as he wanted to ensure South Carolina did not lose ground with young players that were concerned he would not be with the program for the duration of their careers.\n2. Best coach at three different programs? Spurrier began his college head coaching career at Duke, going 20-13-1 (11-9-1 ACC) in three seasons with the program. In 1989, he led the Blue Devils to their first bowl game in 29 years and a share of the ACC Championship, the program's first in 37 seasons. He was also a two-time ACC Coach of the Year (1988-89) in Durham.\nSpurrier was hired away from Duke by his alma mater, Florida, on New Years Eve in 1989. With the Gators, where Spurrier won a Heisman Trophy as a star quarterback in 1966, he went 122-27-1 (87-12 SEC), leading Florida to its first national title in the 1996 season along with six SEC championships and seven total SEC East crowns. Spurrier won five SEC Coach of the Year crowns with the Gators and also led Florida to the national title game in the 1995 season.\nHe was successful at UF despite taking over a program marred in an NCAA investigation, bringing the Gators their first officially recognized SEC Championship in 1991. Spurrier's Florida participated in the first five SEC title games ever played, and many historians say he helped revolutionize the college game by introducing the Fun 'n' Gun offense while in Gainesville.\nIn 10-plus seasons at South Carolina, Spurrier amassed an 86-49 record (44-40 SEC), becoming the most successful coach in school history. The Gamecocks won their first and only SEC East in 2010 and finished 11-2 in three consecutive years from 2011-13. Spurrier captured two SEC Coach of the Year honors in Columbia, starting with his first season in 2005.\n3. He was a legendary college player, too. Spurrier's coaching prowess is well-known, but he also was a tremendously successful player for the Gators. The two-time All-America First Team selection was named the winner of the 1966 Heisman Trophy and Walter Camp Memorial Trophy, the same season he was named SEC Player of the Year. Spurrier finished his career at Florida with 4,848 passing yarsd and 37 touchdowns.\n4. Spurrier's success did not translate to the pro ranks. Spurrier was selected No. 3 overall in the 1967 NFL draft by San Francisco, playing with the 49ers for nine seasons as a backup quarterback and punter. He was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for their inaugural season in 1976 but concluded his career following that campaign with career totals of 40 touchdowns and 60 interceptions.\nFollowing five seasons as an assistant at Florida, Georgia Tech and Duke, Spurrier accepted his first head coaching job with the USFL's Tampa Bay Bandits. He went 35-19 over three seasons before taking the Duke job and spending 15 years in the college ranks. Spurrier would return to professional football for the final time in 2002, signing a five-year, $25 million contract (the richest in NFL history at that time) to serve as coach of the Washington Redskins. Spurrier did not last long in D.C. either, going 7-9 in his first season and 5-11 in his second.\n5. As great as he was on the field, he was just as entertaining off it. Spurrier's on-field successes and antics (read: throwing his visor) are well-known, but he has become just as popular because of his affable personality and quips that he would regularly throw out at press conferences and the SEC Media Days. Rarely was there a media availability that Spurrier did not leave reporters smiling.\n6. Spurrier named The Swamp and was around for the invention of Gatorade. As coach at Florida, Spurrier dropped a famous line that wound up resulting in a nickname for the Gators' Ben Hill Griffin Stadium. \"The Swamp is where Gators live,\" he said. \"We feel comfortable there. A swamp is hot and sticky and can be dangerous.\"\nSpurrier was also one of the very first test subjects for Gatorade as Florida's quarterback 50 years ago during its invention.\nUniversity of Florida QB Steve Spurrier drinking one of the 1st batches of Gatorade from a milk carton pic.twitter.com/xpDkddTmjy \nâ€” Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) September 30, 2015 \nTopics: Duke Blue Devils , Florida Gators , South Carolina Gamecocks , Washington Redskins , NCAAF , NFL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T04:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:23:15.164+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
