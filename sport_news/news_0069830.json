(AP) - Thomas Sperbeck caught two long touchdown passes and sophomore Jeremy McNichols scored his 13th and 14th TDs of the season, leading No. 25 Boise State past Colorado State 41-10 Saturday night. \nAmong Brett Rypien's 339 yards passing was a beautiful 85-yard TD to McNichols, who also caught a 53-yard touchdown pass from fellow wide receiver Shane Williams-Rhodes on a trick play. \nMcNichols, who leads the FBS in TDs, scored on a 56-yard scamper but was knocked from the game on a 1-yard TD run late in the third quarter and didn't return. \nThe Broncos (5-1, 2-0 Mountain West) jumped out to a quick 17-0 lead before the Rams (2-4, 0-2) had even moved the chains and Boise State was never seriously threatened in celebrating its return to the rankings by thrashing Colorado State for the sixth straight time.
