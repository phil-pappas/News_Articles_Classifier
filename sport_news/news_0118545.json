This year once again, a tough challenge using one of the rides at the fair, facing one of the top quarterbacks in the area, Lubbock Cooper QB Jarret Doege. \nHe's the younger brother of former Red Raider Quarterback Seth Doege. \nWe used the Spider which continuously moves around, up and down with the ride compartments spinning around. We tried to throw footballs in the compartments getting 1 point making it low and 3 points going up top and scoring high. \nThis proved to be a thrilling challenge. \nIf you have a challenge, email me at ibeatpete@kcbd.com . \nCopyright 2015 KCBD .
