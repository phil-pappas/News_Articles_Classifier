We’ve got the baseball playoffs coming, you’ve got the NFL season kicking off, you’ve got college football, and you’ve got the NBA season kicking off,\" James told USA TODAY Sports. \"It’s a really good time for sports right now.”\nRomanticism also clashed with reality for James, who has learned as well as any modern superstar how difficult it is to win a championship.\n“I have no time to waste,” the 30-year-old James said. He repeated that line. “I have no time to waste.\n\"My ultimate goal is to win a championship, and it starts now.”\nLast season at this time, James preached patience, saying younger teammates with minimal or no playoff experience needed time.\nBut after reaching the NBA Finals and losing to the Golden State Warriors in six games without Kevin Love for the entire series and Kyrie Irving for the final five games of the series, James understands urgency is just as important as patience.\nPatience and following the process are still important to him. But there’s no doubt he sees a window in which to capitalize with this group. Opportunities to win titles don’t last forever.\n“Yes, we have talent, and yes we did something pretty good last year,” James said. “But that doesn’t mean anything this year. So we’ve got to work just as hard. We’ve got to prepare just as smart and we’ve got to go out and be a team that’s together at all time.\n“You extract your individual ego for the team ego, for the better of the ultimate goal and that’s to get better every single day and each month you continue to grow and hopefully you put yourself in a position in June to compete for a championship.”\nJames likes the new additions – forward Richard Jefferson, center Sasha Kaun and guard Mo Williams, who played for Cleveland during James’ first stint with the Cavs.\n“I’m very excited with what we’ve done so far,” he said of general manager David Griffin’s offseason moves. “Mo Williams, Richard Jefferson and Sasha Kaun, that’s huge. To be able to re-sign Kevin Love and bring back Swish (J.R. Smith) and Shump (Iman Shumpert), that’s huge for our team. When Kyrie (Irving) gets healthy, that’s going to be big time.”\nJames also lamented a notable absence from media day – forward Tristan Thompson, who must either sign a $6.9 million, one-year qualifying offer or reach a longer deal by Thursday’s deadline.\n“He’s a huge piece of our team and obviously he showed that to the world how important he is to our team during the postseason,” James said.\nBut no matter how many offseason moves the Cavs made, their success depends on James who is still stung by his inefficiency during last season’s playoffs even if that inefficiency was out of necessity because of injuries to Love and Irving.\nJames shot 41.2% in the playoffs, including 39.8% in a Finals in which he averaged 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds and 8.8 assists.\n“The numbers that I put up in the Finals, I pretty much didn’t care for because I was so inefficient,” James said. “It hurts me. It bothered me a lot.”\nOffensive efficiency – high shooting percentages, assists, low turnover rate – has been James’ focus leading into camp.\n“I try to hone all my skills. I like to go back to basics, working on shooting,” he said. “I always like to work on shooting and feel I can get better as a shooter. Anywhere on the court – from the three-point line, all the way in to the paint. Layups, floaters, post-ups.\n“To see the see pieces we added and the pieces that are coming back this year, I can get back to my normal self.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:05:56.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
