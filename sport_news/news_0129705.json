That defense overcome three disastrous plays by its offensive teammates that gave the Giants 17 easy points, then authored a goal-line stand in the closing minutes that kept the door cracked for Tony Romo in a 27-26 victory.\nBut the defense is going to have to play even better going forward with word that Pro Bowl wide receiver Dez Bryant will miss at least four weeks with a broken foot. The Cowboys cut loose DeMarco Murray this offseason to pay Bryant, believing he was more instrumental to the success of this offense than the NFL's leading rusher.\nHis presence on the flank kept that eighth defender out of run defense, creating daylight for Murray, and also forced single coverage on Terrance Williams, Jason Witten and every other Dallas receiver. Without Dez, yards on the ground and through the air will be tougher to come by in the next month.\nThat could mean lower-scoring games and greater pressure on the Dallas defense to bow up -- especially with a schedule that includes the Saints and Patriots and their Super Bowl-winning quarterbacks in the next four weeks.\nBut if Sunday is any indication, the second edition of Marinelli's defense could be up to the task.\nLeading 23-20, New York had the chance to put the game away in the final two minutes with a 75-yard drive that set the Giants up with a first-and-goal at the Dallas 4 at the two-minute warning. But on first down, Barry Church stopped Rashad Jennings off left guard at the 2. Then Church and Anthony Hitchens stuffed Jennings on the left side again at the 1.\nThe Giants tried a play-action pass on third down, but a charging Sean Lee flushed Manning right, forcing him to throw the ball away and settle for a field goal. That gave New York a 26-20 lead but left the Cowboys 89 seconds to steal the game -- and Romo did just that with a 72-yard drive in six plays for the game-winning touchdown pass to Jason Witten in the final 10 seconds.\nThe Giants were one of the NFL's best offenses a year ago, finishing 10th in the league with an average of 367 yards per game and seventh in passing at 267 yards. But the Cowboys limited the Giants to 289 total yards and 193 yards passing and did a splendid job of protecting the end zone, forcing the Giants to settle for field goals of 50, 40, 30 and 19 yards.\nThe Giants were able to compete with the Cowboys because of gifts bestowed by the Dallas offense. The New York defense scooped up a Cole Beasley fumble and scored one touchdown and also intercepted Romo twice, setting up short scoring drives of 14 and 1 yards.\nThe Beasley fumble and Romo's first interception came on consecutive plays in the final minute of the first half, gift-wrapping 10 quick points for the Giants on just 14 yards of offense for a 13-6 halftime lead. New York's only offensive touchdown came on a 1-yard drive in the fourth quarter after a Trumaine McBride interception set the Giants up on the Dallas doorstep.\nThe addition of Randy Gregory and the healthy return of DeMarcus Lawrence at the other end obviously caught New York's attention this preseason. So Manning spent the night throwing quick passes to neutralize this new rush. The trade-off for those quick throws was the loss of New York's big plays. Manning's longest pass play of the game was a mere 19-yarder to running back Shane Vereen on a catch-and-run.\nThe Giants rushed for only 99 yards on 24 carries -- and 27 of them came on a late fourth-quarter run by Andre Williams on New York's final scoring drive. Another 8 came on a scramble by Manning, and 11 more came on an end-around by Dwayne Harris. For most of the night, Jennings and Williams were running into a brick wall.\nThe Cowboys will continue to play without Pro Bowl pass rusher Greg Hardy and middle linebacker Rolando McClain, who remain under NFL suspension for the next three weeks. And Gregory suffered a high ankle sprain in the second half Sunday night that could sideline him for the next month.\nSo the defense also will be short-handed. But a great defense doesn't make excuses -- it makes plays. And the Cowboys will need them going forward.\nListen to Rick Gosselin at 10:50 a.m. Tuesdays on Sportsradio 1310 AM/96.7 FM The Ticket with Norm Hitzges.\nCowboys' comeback vs. Giants: Full coverage\nAnalysis\nCowlishaw: Cowboys get miracle win, need another one without Dez\nGosselin: Romo's a hero, but thank Cowboys' defense for win\nBob Sturm: 'Fortunate' Cowboys, unsure RBs saved by bizarre Giants decision\n5 thoughts: Tony Romo again shows why he is one of the game's best QBs\nMoore: Overcoming adversity is always possible with Cowboys QB Tony Romo\nCowboys trends: Standing tall, making a stand and fighting back\nLatest news and updates\nJerry Jones: Dez Bryant has broken bone in foot, out 4-6 weeks\nGiants reveal game plan that shut down Dez Bryant, react to injury\nNational reaction: Jordan Spieth, LeBron James, more on Cowboys' win over Giants\nJason Witten: Tony Romo at his best in game-winning situations\nGiants on controversial pass interference: I couldn't believe it\nSean Lee after first regular-season game since 2013: 'I am sore'\nGiants CB Prince Amukamara: 'They're probably going to make a series of 'Why I hate Tony Romo''\nDallas Cowboys DE Jeremy Mincey: 'I ain't going to get hung by Cowboys Nation; it could have been real ugly'\nPhotos\nCowboys tailgating photos: Making fun of Eli Manning; lots of bling and meat\nPhotos: Dez Bryant gets pumped, then hurt; Romo leads miraculous comeback\nFun\nTrump-esque?
