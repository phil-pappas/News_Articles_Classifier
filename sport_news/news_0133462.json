Vancouver is looking to rebound after back-to-back losses. The team will have a big challenge trying to contain the high flying offence of the Capitals.\nHenrik Sedin says everyone always focuses on Alex Ovechkin, but Washington has plenty of other scorers.\n“I’ve played against him for a few years and you have to be careful when he is on the ice. You have to stay on the right side and be aware of where he is. They have a lot of fire power on that team. You look at Nicklas Backstrom, who is a great playmaking centre, and players like TJ Oshie, it will be a tough test.\nCoach Willie Desjardins is choosing to go with a younger lineup tonight and for the first time will have Jake Virtanen, Jared McCann, Sven Baertschi and Ben Hutton all in the lineup at the same time. McCann will centre the fourth line between Brandon Prust and Derek Dorsett, but Desjardins wants him to keep playing his type of hockey.\n“He has to play his game. We need him to be good defensively. It doesn’t matter if you are playing on the fourth line or the third line, you have to play good defensively. His role is pretty much the same.”\nThe other teenager in the lineup, Jake Virtanen says he is excited for his first game against Alex Ovechkin.\n“I liked him growing up. He is a pretty great player, so playing against him tonight will be pretty cool. I can’t wait to play against him head to head.”\nHutton will patrol the blueline and says he is ready to shut down Ovechkin.\n“You have to be aware of where he is at all times. You have to stick to your game plan and execute it. It’s what got me here, so I just need to stick to the game plan.”\nRyan Miller gets the start in net and Adam Cracknell will be the odd man out.\nThe puck drops at 7 p.m. You can watch the game on Sportsnet 360.\nAlex Ovechkin | Ben Hutton | Canucks | Capitals | Jake Virtanen | Jared McCann | nhl | willie desjardins", "external_links": ["http://capitals.nhl.com/", "http://canucks.nhl.com/"], "published": "2015-10-22T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:55:56.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
