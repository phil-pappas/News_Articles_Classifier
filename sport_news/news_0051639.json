Huron and Mitchell have also dropped into the upper 30s. Frost advisories were issued as a result of the colder temperatures across parts of the James Valley. \nThe forecast will remain cool today across the east with highs in the middle 60s in Sioux Falls. Pierre and Rapid City will be warmer in the middle 70s. \nTonight will not be as cold with lows in the lower 50s under mostly clear skies and south winds at 5-15mph. \nWe expect a big warm-up tomorrow with highs returning to the 80s in many areas. We could get close to 90 in both Pierre and Rapid City. Sioux Falls will be near 80 with gusty southwest winds. \nSunday will be another warm day with more 80s likely, well above normal for this time of year. \nMonday will be cooler as winds turn around to the northwest at 15-30 mph. Temperatures will also cool back into the 60s in many areas. \nIt still looks mild Tuesday and Wednesday, but a bigger change in the jet stream may allow colder weather to spill into the northern plains just after the 7-day forecast.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:28:23.547+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
