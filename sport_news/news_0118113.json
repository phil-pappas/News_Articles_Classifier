(Paul Beaty/Associated Press) \nWhen Maryland women’s basketball Coach Brenda Frese stepped to the lectern at Xfinity Center’s Heritage Hall Tuesday afternoon to deliver opening remarks at media day, she began by mentioning the many changes within the program during the offseason. \nFor starters, Frese won’t have the services of her longtime top two assistants, Tina Langley and Marlin Chinn, both of whom left to take head coaching positions at other schools. The offseason also included the resignation of first-year assistant Bryce McKey amid charges of sexual abuse from a women’s basketball player at Xavier, where he coached before briefly coming to College Park. \nThe most notable absence this season, though, figures to be starting point guard Lexie Brown , who elected to transfer to Duke, the Terrapins’ arch rival from when both schools were in the ACC. The move means senior Chloe Pavlech and redshirt senior Brene Moseley are competing to become the regular point guard on a team poised to make a run at a third straight Final Four. \n“With the success that we had, it was probably, as I go into year 14 here at Maryland, one of the busiest offseasons that you could possibly have,” the reigning Big Ten coach of the year said. “I’ve been fortunate that I’ve always taken a mind-set that I really welcome change. I think it’s healthy, and I think that you get a lot of great new energy when you have change.” \nMaryland has thrived recently despite considerable turnover. Following an appearance in the 2013-14 Final Four, for instance, the Terrapins graduated three senior starters, including three-time all-American Alyssa Thomas, the program’s career leader in points and rebounds, but went undefeated through the Big Ten regular season and conference tournament last season. \nThe Terrapins, then in their first year in the Big Ten, were rewarded with a No. 1 seed in the NCAA tournament and advanced to the national semifinals for the third time in 10 years. Still neither Frese nor her players were ready to term this season as national championship or bust, but it’s clear the aspiration is to claim the second NCAA title in program history a decade after winning its first. \n“I mean I think the pressure behind it, as long as we think about it, it will become that,” said Moseley, a first-team All-Met from Paint Branch as a junior. “I think if we focus on what we’ve been doing so far, everything else will take care of itself. Our success in the past hasn’t come from that type of mentality. Now we can’t really have that living-in-fear type thing. We have to be excited for the new day.” \nMoseley factored significantly into the Terrapins’ run through the Big Ten and NCAA tournaments, replacing Brown at critical junctures when the all-Big Ten selection was having difficulty getting on track. Pavlech, meantime, draws on experience from starting as a freshman when Moseley tore her ACL during a scrimmage and was lost for the season. \nThey’ll have plenty of help elsewhere, particularly from junior guard-forward Shatori Walker-Kimbrough. The all-Big Ten selection was tied for second on the team in scoring (13.3) and finished second alone in rebounding (5.3). Also back is junior all-Big Ten center Brionna Jones, who led Maryland in rebounding (8.9) and was third in the Big Ten in field goal percentage (.601). \n“We did go through a lot of changes this summer,” Walker-Kimbrough said. “Everyone goes through changes. We’re really excited. We continue to work hard. We stayed focused on us and our family here, and I thought we continued to push each other. We had a lot of distractions, but I thought we stayed really focused.” Gene Wang is a sports reporter covering multiple beats, including Navy football, the Capitals, Wizards, Nationals, women’s basketball, auto racing, boxing and golf.
