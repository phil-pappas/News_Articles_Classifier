Park, the winner last year at Miramar, skipped her title defense to play in a Korea LPGA event. \nAt 18 years, 6 months, 1 day, Ko is the youngest player to win 10 events on any major tour. \nKo finished at 20-under 268 after opening with rounds of 69, 67 and 67 to take a four-stroke lead into the final day.
