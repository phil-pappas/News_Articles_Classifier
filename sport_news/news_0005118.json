Something about the first time they’ve ever been ranked and hosted another ranked team at the Liberty Bowl. I don’t know.\nThanks, as always, to those of you who submitted questions this week -- especially those who helped out Thursday morning. Much appreciated. Remember that you can submit questions any time either via email or on Twitter . Remember to use #TigerMail when tweeting your questions. And now, without further ado, let’s get to it.\n@Tom_Schad what do you make of fuente being mentioned for these power 5 openings? Who would you see as a likely replacement ?\n— Daniel Carson (@goUofMTigers12) October 15, 2015 After practice earlier this week, I jokingly congratulated Justin Fuente on being the next head coach of Maryland, Illinois, Miami, both USCs and the Tennessee Titans. That’s what Twitter would have you believe, anyways. The truth is this: It’s about two months too early to even have a conversation about it. You’ll notice that all of this coaching carousel talk draws from the same pool of hot up-and-coming names. Just as Fuente is rumored to be in the running for all of these jobs (and more), so are Houston’s Tom Herman, Temple’s Matt Rhule, Toledo’s Matt Campbell and so on and so forth. There’s like this specific group of coaches that we’ve all unanimously decided are good, and young, and therefore should be considered candidates for every open Power Five job. That’s just not how it works. At most, schools with vacancies are internally tossing around names and doing background research at this point. I promise you Herman, Rhule, Campbell and Fuente aren’t sitting around thinking about what jobs may or may not be available to them at the end of the year, and there has to be mutual interest for anything to stick. I guess all of this is a very lengthy way of saying that you should put little to no stock in Fuente being mentioned for these openings right now. He will continue to be mentioned for Power Five jobs until he leaves or the Tigers tank, regardless of whether it’s actually realistic or not.\n@Tom_Schad Do Tigers commit to doubling Nkemdiche? Who else on OM front 7 can make similar impact on a game? #TigerMail\n— Don Curl (@jammaster0824) October 7, 2015\nHere’s a surprising stat for you: Robert Nkemdiche just recorded his first full sack of the season last week against New Mexico State. He leads the team with 5.5 tackles for a loss, but only had a half-sack in the team’s first five games. Now don’t get me wrong -- Nkemdiche is still the most dangerous player on the Rebels’ front seven. But doubling him at all costs simply creates opportunities for everyone else, namely defensive end Marquis Haynes (3.5 sacks), Nkemdiche’s brother, Denzel, a senior linebacker, and others. I would expect the Tigers to give Robert Nkemdiche plenty of attention, but a commitment to double-teaming on him on every passing play could backfire given the overall strength of the front seven.\n@Tom_Schad blue, gray, or annually disappointing black uniforms against Ole Miss? #TigerMail\n— Marc (@MarcFinley) October 11, 2015\nSadly, I don’t have any uniform intel for y’all this week. Sorry. The American Athletic Conference has been posting about Memphis “going pink.” Not sure if that means pink uniforms or pink armbands, shoes, etc. But whatever the Tigers wear Saturday, I’d expect it to be a new look. Like the Cincinnati game, I bet they’ve saved a little something for the big stage.\n @memphisathletics is going pink on Saturday vs Ole Miss for their Breast Cancer Awareness Game. #thinkpink\nA photo posted by American Athletic Conference (@american_conf) on Oct 15, 2015 at 7:33am PDT\n@Tom_Schad Name the Top 5 NFL prospects, in order, who will be on the field at the Liberty Bowl on Saturday #TigerMail\n— Tim Miller (@TiminMem23) October 15, 2015\nThis is a really good question, but it’s really hard for me to answer simply because I haven’t seen enough of Ole Miss. Obviously Nkemdiche and Rebels wide receiver Laquon Treadwell would be the first two names on that list. They could both be top-10 picks in the spring. Shoot, Nkemdiche could very well go top-5. Beyond that, I can’t definitively rank them. Ole Miss tight Evan Engram would be in there somewhere, though. Paxton Lynch would, too. No question he’ll be one of the five best NFL prospects on the field this weekend. But picking a fifth guy, and ranking them definitively? I’d need to watch way more of Ole Miss to be able to offer an answer on that. Sorry.\n@Tom_Schad Do you think we will use a more offensive game plan this game as opposed to the one used against ole miss last seaon#tigermail\n— Michael Anderson (@memphisfan2095) October 15, 2015\nI don’t think it was so much a matter of game planning last year as it was experience and, maybe confidence. It wasn’t like the offense was all freshmen, but there were a lot of sophomores, like Lynch, and juniors playing significant roles. I’d chalk up last year’s performance as an offense that, while talented, just hadn’t been in many games like that one in Oxford and struggled because of it. (Ole Miss’ defense, of course, was obviously very good, too.) This year’s Memphis offense is completely different. Now, the Tigers have one of the most efficient units in the country -- and they know it. There’s a lot of confidence in that group, and an expectation that they can, and will, put up a lot of points if they execute. There’s no chance they’re held to 104 total yards again this year.\n@Tom_Schad In order to win this game, someone (besides Lynch) will need a breakout game. Who do you believe is in line to do so? #TigerMail\n— Adam Casey (@RAdamCasey) October 15, 2015\nI always go back to Sam Craft on questions like this. He can just influence a game in so many ways. It appears that Jae’Lon Oglesby is returning kickoffs now, but Craft is still the primary ball-carrier and can create mismatches when he motions out of the backfield. I could see Craft ripping off a big play on a screen pass, for example. Mose Frazier has also been really, really good so far. He’s one of those guys that defenses really hate dealing with because he can lull you to sleep with short and intermediate routes, then sneak behind you for a huge play.\n@Tom_Schad If the Tigers beat Rebels, where do they land in polls? High enough to jump Boise St and Toledo? #TigerMail\n— Don Curl (@jammaster0824) October 11, 2015\nOh, I don’t know. Answering this question involves a certain degree of fortune-telling. I can confidently say that a win over Ole Miss would get the Tigers into the Associated Press Top 25. That’s a no-brainer. How high they’d go would obviously depend on how Boise State fares against Utah State and how Toledo looks against Eastern Michigan. Not to mention all the other teams in the bottom half of the rankings, including Houston, for example. If I had a vote, Memphis would jump all three with a win over Ole Miss, because it’d be the biggest win for a Group of Five team to date this year. But I don’t have a vote. And I can’t predict the actions of those who do.\nHas anybody pinpointed the problem with our secondary and miscommunication? #TigerMail\n— timothy bishop (@timothy_bishop) October 11, 2015\nJust to be clear: There have been a lot of different issues with the secondary this season. Miscommunication has, at times, been one of them. But it’s certainly not the only one. In the same vein, I don’t think there’s one answer or explanation that you can really pinpoint. There’s no quick fix. Fuente has talked about the team -- and the secondary, in particular -- improving over the course of the season. I think there’s certainly truth to that. The more in-game situations that these guys face, the easier it’ll be to recognize and adapt to a similar situation the next time. The question is exactly how much growth we’ll see, and when. Fuente said dropback passing (and, by extension, defending the dropback pass) was one of the main focuses over the bye week. It’ll be interesting to see if the secondary shows drastic improvement in the second-half of the year.\n@Tom_Schad with Lynch being mentioned as the #2 QB in the draft, how have the other QBs looked in practice? Starter if PL leaves? #TigerMail\n— Mason Massey (@masonmassey) October 13, 2015\nA little early to assume Lynch is gone, isn’t it? I don’t know, maybe that’s just me. But to answer your question, practice has been closed to reporters for several weeks now, so I can only go back to what I saw earlier in the season and the pre-season. I was pretty impressed with Brady Davis. He’s looked like a freshman at times, sure, but he’s got a good arm and the kind of reserved confidence that I think can help at that position. My guess is that he would get the first crack at the job, but I’d imagine they would have an open competition throughout the spring and fall before making that decision.\n@Tom_Schad What result from this weekend has a stronger impact: a close win or a blowout loss?\n— Patrick Scatamacchia (@plscatam) October 15, 2015\nA stronger impact on the perception of the program, right? I’m assuming that’s what you’re getting at here. If that’s the case, I think a close win would be more significant. Geoff Calkins made a good point on this week’s podcast when he said this: If Memphis beats Ole Miss, anything is in the conversation -- an outright American Athletic Conference title, a New Year’s Six bowl, a top 15 or top 20 ranking in the AP poll, anything. It would be a huge step for the national reputation of this program. A blowout loss, on the other hand, would damage that reputation a little bit, but not to the same extent as a win would help it.
