Williams also will announce opposition to Issue 2, a proposed ban on constitutional monopolies that's designed to block the marijuana effort.\nWednesday's event will include Ohio patients who could benefit from access to medical marijuana if the amendment passes Nov. 3.\nA spokesman said Williams does not intend to be an investor in any of the 10 authorized growing sites created by the proposal and has no current plans to be involved in the Ohio cannabis business.\nThis story has been corrected to show that this is not Williams' first time getting involved in a marijuana legalization effort.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
