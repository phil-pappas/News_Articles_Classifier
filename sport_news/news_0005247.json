Falling behind 3–0 is practically a death knell for a team’s season; you don’t need my spreadsheet of the 165 previous best-of-seven series in major league history to know that the only team ever to come back from a 0–3 deficit was the 2004 Red Sox . Things aren’t that dire yet for the Blue Jays , but even a 0–2 deficit is something just 17% of teams in that position have overcome.\nThe Royals , meanwhile, are in a familiar position, having swept their way from the wild-card game to the World Series last year. I’ve called them relentless and compared them to a singles-hitting version of the Gas-House Gorillas , and they seem unlikely to take their foot off the Blue Jays’ necks in this game. The Jays will have to push it off, but to do so, they’ll have to defeat the pitcher who dominated the Royals’ Game 5 Division Series win.\n• MORE MLB: Full postseason schedule, start times, TV listings\nRoyals at Blue Jays\nSeries: ALCS Game 3; Royals lead 2–0\nStart Time: 8:07 p.m. ET\nTV: FOX Sports 1\nStarting Pitchers: Johnny Cueto (1–0, 3.86 ERA) vs. Marcus Stroman (0–0, 3.46 ERA)\n• Acquired at the non-waiver trading deadline for a trio of pitching prospects, Cueto joined the Royals with the second-best ERA+ in baseball since the start of the 2011 season among pitchers with 500 or more innings pitched over that span. By the time he entered his Game 5 start in the Division Series, however, he had compiled a 6.44 ERA over his previous 10 starts this season, including Game 2 of the ALDS, to go with a 5.52 ERA in four career postseason starts. But he dominated in Game 5, allowing only a single and a home run in eight innings of work, retiring the last 19 men he faced and not allowing a fair ball to reach the outfield in his final four innings.\nThe cynical view of that outing is that Cueto was facing an Astros team that had been devastated by coming within six outs of winning the series in Game 4 only to blow the lead. He can silence that criticism by having another strong outing against the best offense in baseball in what is sure to be a raucous Rogers Centre.\nMLB Video David Price’s postseason demons haunt him again in Jays’ Game 2 loss by Phil Taylor", "external_links": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_Bugs", "http://twitter.com/cliffcorcoran"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T05:05:56.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
