After taking a 2-0 lead against Yorktown in the Yorktown Sectional semifinal, the Bearcats lost control as the Tigers scored four unanswered goals to advance. \nCentral felt it was the favorite after going unbeaten against its three sectional counterparts, and it probably is heading into this year's Yorktown Sectional as well as play begins Wednesday. Hill said he's trying to balance embracing a clean slate while acknowledging a great regular season that featured 12 wins and four losses. \nAnything but look back to last season. \n\"We could dwell on that if we wanted to and say, 'We can't let what happened last year happen again,'\" Hill said, \"but it's not even a thought in the minds of these guys. \n\"... If we want to do something this season, it's going to take moving forward and only focusing on each game as it comes.\" \nThe Bearcats have beaten Jay County (6-6), Delta (4-13) and Yorktown (7-6-2) this season. When asked if Central is the favorite, midfielder Rob Wilkinson didn't bite. \n\"Everything starts over in the postseason,\" he said. ... \"It's a whole new season right now.\" \nThat may be the case, but Central thrived in the regular season behind Chase Clasby and Devon McNabb. Clasby tallied 21 goals while McNabb put home 17, and the duo each had seven assists. The Bearcats won 11 of their first 12 games before losing three of their last four, including twice to Kokomo (17-1-1). \nDoes anything change now? \n\"We need to do the best we can do and just play like we have been playing,\" McNabb said. \nSeven Bearcats — including starters Wilkinson, David Lavanchy and Alan Rodriguez — missed Saturday's loss at Kokomo because they were taking the SAT. The Bearcats are hoping one educational experience leads to another — not that they're thinking about it. \nHill said the Bearcats will be keeping an eye on Jay County's Zach Chaney. Luke Bryan, Sam Green and Karter Bibbs lead Yorktown into the other semifinal against Isaac Griffis, Alec Lynn and the Eagles. The winners meet Saturday night, which is not even on Central's radar yet. \n\"The last few games, we've been talking about putting the pedal to the floor from the first whistle and not letting up, and that mantra is going to transfer over,\" Hill said. \"There is no time for letting up on anything in the postseason because things can come back to bite you in the butt. You pull off that gas at all, then the next thing you know is you'll be in a completely different situation than you were.\" \nAs the Bearcats know all too well. \nContact sports features writer Ryan O’Gara at (765) 213-5829.
