The senior wideout has 65 catches for 738 yards and two touchdowns this season. 171: Passing yards for Blake Frohnapfel \nIt was Frohnapfel's second-lowest total as a Minutemen, ahead of only his 147-yard debut performance against Boston College last year. 5,139: Frohnapfel's career passing total \nEven with the poor showing, Frohnapfel cracked an exclusive club Saturday, becoming just the fourth passer in UMass history to eclipse 5,000 yards as Minutemen. He joins Liam Coen (11,031), Todd Bankhead (7,018) and Dave Palazzi (5,461). 8.3: Marquis Young's yards-per-carry \nThe freshman led UMass with 68 yards on nine carries. Mark Whipple has said Young is making strides, but it's unclear why the dynamic runner isn't getting more of an opportunity. 12:46: Time of possession difference in favor of Kent State \nUnable to pick up first downs consistently, UMass punted seven times and allowed the Golden Flashes to churn up tons of clock. Those extra minutes would have come in handy with the team needing just a touchdown to pull out the win. 9: Kent State tackles for loss \nThe Minutemen's offensive line struggled again Saturday, letting up far too many negative plays. Add in four sacks, and UMass had 13 offensive plays come to an end behind the line of scrimmage. 97: Rushing yards for Kent State quarterback George Bollas \nFor years, UMass has struggled containing quarterback who can pull the ball down and make plays with their feet. Bolas, a redshirt freshman, picked up several first downs on his own and had a long rush of 18 yards. 17: Tackles for Jovan Santos-Knox \nThe UMass defense did plenty to give its offense a shot late in the game to eek out a win. \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:37:13.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
