(Photo: Advertiser file) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nHuntingdon wide receiver Jamichael Bibb and safety Anthony White are more like brothers than teammates. \nThe former Robert E. Lee stars have known each other since the second grade, growing up in the same North Pass neighborhood and playing on the same football teams. \n“Everyone used to go to Anthony’s house,” Bibb said. “We’d play ball or ride go-karts together and just have a bunch of friends over. Once his family moved out, we both still kept in contact and stayed over each other’s houses.” \nWhite said Bibb has been dedicated and loyal since the beginning. \n“My first impression of Jamichael on the field was that he catches the ball very well,” White said. “As a teammate, he’s a leader and role model that a lot of people look up to.” \nBibb said he was impressed by White’s athleticism when they first started playing football together at age 10. \n“He was a running back playing quarterback at the time,” Bibb said. “He played both sides of the ball in junior high. As we got up to high school, he was just an explosive player on the defensive side. He’s an awesome safety.” \nAfter graduating from Lee, both men say they had no idea if they’d ever be teammates again. Bibb enrolled at Troy, and White enrolled at Virginia Union. \nBibb said when Hawks head coach Mike Turk asked if he knew White upon coming to Huntingdon, he gave an immediate response. \n“We’re like brothers,” Bibb said he told Turk. “When Coach told me he was on his way also, I just thought we can’t stay away from each other.” \nThe childhood buddies didn’t have to change their primary school colors and are making their marks on Huntingdon football and the USA South. \nWhite is a two-time all-conference safety who tied a school record with three interceptions in Huntingdon’s 56-21 win over Ferrum College last Saturday. His nine career interceptions tie him with Bryan Wells for third on the all-time list. \n“Anthony always does the right thing and is a good leader on the field,” Bibb said. “As a friend, he’s always there for you. Whenever you need him, call him. He’s going to answer and come through at any time.” \nBibb is in the top five in career receiving yards (1,194), receptions (75) and receiving touchdowns (15) at Huntingdon. \nBibb and White are each halfway through their senior season, which will end their football partnership … for now. \nWhite said he hopes that long after their careers at Huntingdon end, they still can share the same brotherly bond. \n“Playing together brought us even closer as brothers,” White said. “We had no intentions of joining back up with Huntingdon, it just happened. I hope we can come back to Huntingdon with our families as alumni.” Read or Share this story: http://on.mgmadv.com/1RJBYmq TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T11:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:33:03.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
