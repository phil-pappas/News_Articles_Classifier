It’s been tested a number of times in practice, I keep working on the strength. I’m sure there’ll be a few scares here and there but that’s kind of mentally just getting over the hump a little bit. I feel great.” \nLove had six points and four rebounds in his first game since the opening round of last season’s playoffs, but the Cavaliers remained winless in the preseason with an 87-81 loss to the Toronto Raptors. \n“It’s the best I’ve felt in a long time,” Love said. “When the regular season starts it’s a whole different grind, but it’s a good starting point, for sure.” \nLeBron James and Richard Jefferson (rest) did not play for the Cavaliers (0-6). \nToronto’s Anthony Bennett had 11 points against the team that drafted him.
