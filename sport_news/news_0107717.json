She was babysitting the boy for his father in April 2014 when he died of what doctors determined was shaken baby syndrome.\n“I’m sorry that baby Jayceon died,” Thompson wept when she spoke before sentencing.\nDespite her guilty plea, Thompson still maintains her innocence.\nShe entered an Alford plea that allows a defendant to plead guilty without admitting to the crime, but because they believe the evidence would be enough for a jury to convict them.\nThompson agreed to plead guilty in exchange for a lighter sentence.\n“I had nothing to do with it, and I don’t know how he died,” Thompson said. “I didn’t hurt him. I would never hurt him. I love him.”\nThompson has been held in the Pierce County jail since April 2014 and will get credit for the time she served behind bars.\nWant to talk about the news of the day?
