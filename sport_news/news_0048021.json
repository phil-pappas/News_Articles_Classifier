Texas A&M is still battling for top honors after taking down Mississippi State. Florida’s 38-10 win against the Rebels has the Gators rounding out the top four.\nAlabama will look to stay on track when it welcomes Arkansas to Bryant-Denny Stadium (7 p.m. on ESPN), but the league’s other marquee matchups Saturday are in the East. Georgia will travel to Tennessee (3:30 p.m. on CBS), and Florida will travel to Missouri (7:30 p.m. on the SEC Network). The lone cross-divisional matchup is LSU at South Carolina (noon on ESPN).\nMississippi State and Ole Miss host non-conference opponents this week while Kentucky, Auburn, Texas A&M and Vanderbilt are all off Saturday.\nYou can see the full Week 6 power rankings below:\nCOURIER-JOURNAL\nCourier Journal College Football Power Rankings\n* If you cannot see the link above, click here to view our rankings and create your own.\nEmail Jon Hale at jahale@courier-journal.com .
