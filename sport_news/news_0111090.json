Royal Advantage \nRemember when Blue Jays manager John Gibbons seemed indifferent to the notion of winning just one of the final two games of the regular season, even though it was clear what was at stake? \nRemember the on-going narrative how this Jays team was built to thrive under its home dome? \nWell how much would that home advantage help now? The Jays have to win two at Kauffman Stadium, a park that can mute the long ball and favour the attack employed by the Royals. As we saw in Game 5 on Wednesday, there can be magic on Blue Jays Way. \n2. Will Price be Right? \nAll signs pointed to that being the case in Game 2 as Jays starter David Price retired 18 in a row after giving up a single to the first batter he faced. Price still had good stuff in the seventh but was small-balled to death and chased from the hill. \nPrice seems as cool as they come, but will there be any loose shrapnel in his head after that surprise collapse? \n3. The Shadow Knows \nRoyals hitters believe that the late afternoon start in Game 2 (3 p.m. local time) was a boost to Price. \nLong shadows created by the late-afternoon sun wreaked havoc on their ability to pick up Price offerings, a challenge at the best of times. This one should be all under the Kauffman Stadium lights. The shadows were long gone by the big seventh. \nIf the Royals see Price better, will they hit him better? \n4. It’s A Small World \nMuch has been made of the difference in attack for American League finalists, but it’s a fact. The Royals hitters are as patient as they come, content to grind their way through at bats and getting on base whatever way they can. It works to perfection in their expansive home park where home runs usually need to be earned. \nTo their credit, the Jays have had some success in grinding at bats as well, but have been more reliant on the boomer game. \n5. Special K \nSure, they may have been a little tone deaf, but to a man after Game 5, Royals players claimed the Kauffman Stadium crowd to be the loudest in the league. The 49,000 and change at the Rogers Centre on Wednesday would dispute that, of course. \nKauffman Stadium can get loud though and it’s always a treat to wrap up a big series in front of the home crowd. \nFIVE REASONS THE JAYS CAN PULL IT OUT \n1. Price is Right \nRoyals players raved about David Price’s “stuff” in Game 2. Jays catcher Russell Martin concurred, saying that Price was still throwing strong and effective in the seventh when it all fell apart for the Jays. \nIt seems crazy given his regular-season success that Price has yet to get a win in his seven post-season starts. With the Jays’ season on the line, his good form last outing and his body back on a more normal rotation, will this finally be the night that Price cashing in during the post-season? \n2. Elimination Heroes \nThe predicament the Jays face is not exactly foreign territory. Down 2-0 in the ALDS, they stormed back to win three in a row, including the dramatic Game 5 classic at Rogers Centre. \nThey dropped the first two in this series and once again found themselves in a two-game hole after Game 4. In part due to power and in part due to the chemistry, the Jays are never truly out of it. \nTwo more wins in the face of elimination? Been there and done that. \n3. Vegas Says \nWho are we to question the oddsmakers? (Have you checked out our middling NFL selections lately?) The Jays began the 2015 playoffs as slight favourites to win he World Series. They were also the oddsmakers choice to take the ALCS prior to Game 1. \nAnd now for Game 6, with elimination looming, the Jays once again are favoured. In most Vegas casinos, the Jays are listed at a favoured price of minus 135 (bet $135 to turn a $100 profit). \n4. Never Get Tu-low \nMired in a hitting slump earlier in the playoffs, key late-season acquisition Troy Tulowitzki has picked up his hitting game when needed most. \nHis bases-clearing double in Game 5 provided crucial run insurance for Marco Estrada, who had been brilliant on the hill for the Jays. \nThere’s power at the top of the Toronto order, but when there is production throughout, look out! \n5. Right in the Ruts \nWhen the Jays record their last out of the post-season, it will also be the last prose filed by our own Team Sun legend Mike Rutsey. \nThe Ruts is eagerly anticipating his pending retirement but the Jays are in no hurry to send him on his way. Rutsey’s record while in the press box for potential elimination? Like the team he writes about, a stellar 4-0.
