Here are the games that will shape the rest of the regular season and the way we think about the playoffs.\nNo. 9 Hinsdale Central at No. 4 Glenbard West (Saturday): Whoever wins this one will still need to take on undefeated Oak Park-River Forest to win the West Suburban Silver outright, but Saturday's winner deserves the benefit of the doubt in that one. Glenbard West is the favorite for obvious reasons, such as its winning percentage that's well over 90 percent in conference games since Chad Hetlet 's second season as head coach in 2008. If Hinsdale Central defies those odds, the Red Devils would instantly become not only the team to beat in the conference but one for all of Class 8A to fear.\nNo. 12 Lincoln-Way East at No. 1 Homewood-Flossmoor (Week 7): As much as H-F, last year's Class 8A runner-up, was looking forward to the championship rematch against Stevenson in Week 2 this season, the Vikings also were already talking about settling the score with the team that cost them the Southwest Suburban Blue title last season. You guessed it, Lincoln-Way East. The Griffins have been quietly dominant since their opening-night loss to Oak Park, which seemed like an upset at the time because we didn't know Oak Park was going to reload rather than rebuild. It's possible that both these teams will be playing for state titles on Thanksgiving weekend. We all expect H-F to be there. Lincoln-Way East is always a factor in 7A. If the Griffins can beat H-F again, why not any 7A team in the state?\nPrep football: Senior moments spur Conant Bob Narang Late during Tuesday's practice, Conant coach Bill Modelski stepped back from his normal routine to chat with some outside observers.\nInstead of stressing over every detail for Saturday's showdown at No. 11 Barrington, Modelski allowed his assistant coaches and players to handle the final 20 minutes...\nLate during Tuesday's practice, Conant coach Bill Modelski stepped back from his normal routine to chat with some outside observers.\nInstead of stressing over every detail for Saturday's showdown at No. 11 Barrington, Modelski allowed his assistant coaches and players to handle the final 20 minutes...\n(Bob Narang) No. 13 Nazareth at No. 6 Joliet Catholic (Week 7): A few weeks from now, we could be calling both these teams favorites to win state championships. Nazareth is the defending 6A champion, and forgiving the slippage on a wet field against Marian Central, the Roadrunners appear just as powerful this time around. It's been a turn-back-the-clock season at Joliet Catholic, with the 13-time state champion dominating even good teams like Providence and Marian Central. A 5A field void of success-factor victims Montini and Springfield Sacred-Heart Griffin — who are lined up to play in 6A — looks like one Joliet Catholic can and will handle. Especially if the Hilltoppers beat Nazareth.\nNo. 3 Mount Carmel at No. 2 Loyola (Week 9): This one sells itself, from the numbers preceding the schools' names to the teams themselves. One of the best recent rivalries from a competitive standpoint, this incarnation will pit a stellar Mount Carmel defense against perhaps the best offense Loyola has fielded in the John Holecek era. The winner becomes at least a co-favorite to win a state title. Not out of the question that both do.\nPrep football: Stats not important to Dara Laja, No. 2 Loyola Mike Helfgot Pat Naughton knows his number because he can visualize it, quite literally, on the plaque Loyola gave the 1996 graduate upon his entrance into its hall of fame.\nDara Laja was surprised to learn he was within reach of Naughton's school-record 2,142 career rushing yards in the off-season, though...\nPat Naughton knows his number because he can visualize it, quite literally, on the plaque Loyola gave the 1996 graduate upon his entrance into its hall of fame.\nDara Laja was surprised to learn he was within reach of Naughton's school-record 2,142 career rushing yards in the off-season, though...\n(Mike Helfgot) Mike Helfgot is a freelance reporter for the Chicago Tribune.\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune High School Sports Sports", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560dc32d/turbine/ct-spt-1001-prep-fb-helfgot-blog-20150930", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ca734/turbine/ct-spt-1002-prep-fb-feature-loyola-20151001", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560ca44b/turbine/ct-spt-1002-prep-fb-feature-conant-20151001"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T15:30:41.112+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
