They took advantage when Astros shortstop Carlos Correa couldn’t handle a deflected grounder that might have been a double-play ball, rallying for five runs in the eighth inning to beat Houston 9-6, forcing their playoff series to a decisive Game 5. \n“We always feel that we’re still in games, and we still have a chance,” first baseman Eric Hosmer said. “That’s the mentality for this whole entire team. It’s never quit, and the character we showed today. That’s what a championship ballclub does.” \nCorrea homered twice, doubled, singled and drove in four runs in Game 4 of the AL Division Series. Houston took a 6-2 lead into the eighth, but a tough error charged to the 21-year-old rookie keyed the Royals’ comeback to even the matchup at two games apiece. \n“I missed it. That’s what happened,” Correa said. “I wish I was perfect. I wish I could do everything perfect, but I’m not. I’m human.” \nGame 5 will be back in Kansas City on Wednesday night. Johnny Cueto is set to start for the Royals against Collin McHugh. \n“Everyone that watched that game, everybody that was a part of that game knows how difficult it is to feel like that game was closing in our favor and then have it not go our way,” Astros manager A.J. Hinch said. \nLate in the game, a tweet from the account of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott congratulated the Astros on advancing to the AL Championship Series. Abbott later tweeted for his personal account: “No predictions. Just support.” \nKansas City opened the eighth with five straight singles off relievers Will Harris and Tony Sipp, with RBI hits by Lorenzo Cain and Hosmer making it 6-4 and leaving the bases loaded with no outs. \nKendrys Morales followed with a hard, one-bouncer off Sipp’s glove. The ball took two more hops and got past the top of Correa’s mitt, rolling into center field as two runs scored to tie it at 6. \n“Just a weird spin on the ball and tough play,” Sipp said. “I’m sure it was tougher than it looked. Game of inches, and I barely missed it.” \nAlex Gordon’s RBI groundout off Luke Gregerson later in the inning put Kansas City ahead. \nHosmer launched a long, two-run homer in the ninth for insurance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:51:37.039+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
