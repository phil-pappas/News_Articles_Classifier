He finished the night 28 of 36, while also rushing for 46 yards. \n\"You never know how a rivalry game will turn out, but this was just impressive,\" Wildcats coach Lee Shaw said. \"Hopefully the score tells the story. We just stomped on the gas there and never let up and beat a very good football team in all three phases. The guys were dialed in from the start. Our word of the week was 'reliable,' and these guys were reliable for each other tonight.\" \nThe Wildcats pounced almost immediately blitzing down the field for a 1-yard touchdown run from Cal Drummond after just 1:44 -- the 7-0 lead was just scratching the surface, however, as Rabun went on to score on five of its six first half possessions. \nUnion County responded with a 10-play drive, but was held out of the end zone, forcing a 21-yard field goal from Knox Kiernan to pull within 7-3. \nIt proved the highlight of the first half for the Panthers, who gained 61 yards on the march -- they managed just 65 for the half. \nDrummond got the Wildcats offense back on track on their next possession, ripping off a 27-yard touchdown run or a 14-3 advantage with 4:32 remaining in the first quarter. It was part of a five-carry, 62-yard effort before halftime for Drummond. \nRabun’s defense got in on the act shortly afterward, picking off a Mancuso pass to set up the Wildcats third score. Taking over at the Panthers 31-yard line Fisher struck for his first touchdown of the night, connecting with Jack Johnson for an 11 yard score. \nEli Gipson then took his turn to shine, as the Rabun County running back hauled in an 8-yard touchdown dart from Fisher for a 28-3 lead with 8:00 left in the second quarter. After stuffing Union’s offense on three downs, the Wildcats then blocked a Panthers punt for Gipson to scoop up and run into the end zone from five yards for a 35-3 lead. \nFisher completed the first half rout on a 19-yard touchdown run -- on 4th and goal -- for a 42-3 lead at the interval. \nThe biggest hit for Union, however, may have come on the Panthers final possession of the half, as Mancuso took a hit on the leg and had to be helped from the field. Back-up Cole Wright entered and showed plenty of grit -- but little could dent the Wildcats defense. \nRabun County ended the half with 339 total yards, including 191 yards passing for Fisher -- who continued his stellar play after the half, hooking up with Johnson for their second scoring pass of the contest, a 29-yard bomb that made it 49-3. \n\"We may be big rivals in athletics with Union County, but we have a lot of respect for them and how good they are,\" Shaw said. \"Hopefully this will slingshot us to something really big.\" \nUnion County will take a bye next week, looking to regroup before playing host to Riverside Military in Blairsville on Oct. 30. \nRabun County, meanwhile, will take on Washington-Wilkes next week. \nSCORING SUMMARY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T16:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:37:11.179+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
