The Patriots used more 3-4 elements in their defense last week against the Cowboys, and some of those responsibilities required Ninkovich and Chandler Jones to drop into pass coverage.\nIt worked swimmingly. Cowboys quarterback Brandon Weeden was 0-of-2 when targeting Ninkovich, who had a pass breakup, and 0-of-1 when throwing at Jones, who nearly had an interception.\nSo again, is there a new island in town?\n“(Zero)-for-2 is not 0-for-20,” Ninkovich said with a laugh. “I’m just going to keep doing my best to not let those guys catch a ball. The more you can do, the better you are to helping your team out.”\nLet’s not skirt around Jones’ missed opportunity, though. After all, the Patriots haven’t.\nJones surprised everyone in the building by dropping into wide receiver Terrance Williams ’ lane, and Weeden fired a ball off the defensive end’s chest. From the moment the ball hit the ground, Jones’ teammates had some jokes at his expense, and since then, there have been equal parts ribbing and reinforcement.\n“We’re like brothers around here,” Jones said. “Surprisingly, the (defensive backs) and everyone is trying to help me more than joking on me. Everyone is saying, ‘Hey, let’s go get on the JUGS (machine). Let’s carry the ball, throwing the ball at me to see if I can catch it.’ It’s an opportunity, and hopefully I get another one.\n“It was a play that I should have made.”\nNinkovich might never let Jones live it down.\n“He’s got to catch that,” Ninkovich said. “Jeez, that’s bad. I told him, ‘If that’s me, I’m catching that.’ It was a good play on his part, good positioning, but didn’t finish.”\nNinkovich is well-versed on the coverage aspect because he played 3-4 outside linebacker at various points in his career, including his first two seasons with the Patriots. It’s fresher territory for Jones, who is working to keep lower leverage while monitoring the quarterback’s eyes during his pass drops.\nThe Patriots also used Dont’a Hightower and Jabaal Sheard on the edge in those sets last week, so they’ve got options. Don’t be surprised if the Patriots mostly shelve the 3-4 base tomorrow against the pass-happy Colts before bringing it back next week against the run-oriented Jets.\nThe Pats were also terrific last season at dropping Ninkovich to cover up Peyton Manning ’s preferred sightlines on crossing patterns, so this element is important.\nIt’s difficult for edge rushers to hone the craft of dropping into space and having a good feel for the routes in their vicinity, especially behind them, so the Patriots are diligently practicing for any future play calls. After all, Ninkovich can’t get to 0-for-20 without starting 0-for-2.\n“You have to practice a lot,” Ninkovich said. “I think doing that early in my career has helped me, but you definitely have to work on it and work on your craft. If you haven’t done it for a while, you’re kind of rusty on where you’re at on the field.”\nInjury observations\nIt sounds like running back Dion Lewis is ready to play tomorrow after suffering a minor abdomen injury during Thursday’s practice. Lewis is listed as questionable, but he certainly appeared ready to go yesterday.\nHightower, who is questionable after injuring his ribs, had his pads in his travel bag, but that doesn’t always mean anything. The Patriots have used tight end Rob Gronkowski ’s travel bag as a pawn in a poker game in the past.\nTackle promotion\nPractice squad tackle Cameron Fleming was informed yesterday he will be promoted to the active roster, according to a source. He will be the Pats’ third tackle tomorrow night.\nThe Patriots drafted Fleming in the fourth round in 2014, He played well as a rotational tackle-eligible tight end and started one game at right guard. Coincidentally, the Patriots ran 31 times for 181 yards and four touchdowns when Fleming was on the field during their regular-season victory against the Colts.\nIt’s not known who will be released to make room for Fleming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:26:47.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
