They'll have the same one Tuesday for Game 4 of the National League Division Series against the Dodgers. \nThere's one big difference though. They will be facing Clayton Kershaw , not Brett Anderson, and that's a big deal. So if the Mets want to end this NLDS in four games, they'll have to beat him for a second time in four games. \nNo easy feat, obviously. The Mets will throw Steven Matz on the mound. It will be his first start since Sept. 24 because of a back injury. \nMETS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:28:47.897+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
