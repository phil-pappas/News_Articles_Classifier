Dallas Keuchel , who pitched for the 'Cats back in 2009, hasn't allowed a run to the Yankees in 16 innings this season. I expect Masahiro Tanaka to pitch a strong game for the Yankees, but he'd better not give up many runs. The Yankees haven't been hitting lately and that's a major concern, especially if Keuchel settles in. One thing the Yankees have working in their favor is Keuchel will be starting on three days' rest for the first time in his career. And maybe with the game being played in the Bronx, it will give the Yankees the edge they need to advance.
