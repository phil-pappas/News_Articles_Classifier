The Badgers stifled almost any semblance of a run game. Save a 36-yard touchdown run by Ke'Shawn Vaughn, the Illini picked up only 19 yards on the ground. Illinois struggled mightily on third-down conversions, going 3-for-12 overall and 0-for-5 on third-and-short situations. \nDefense \nC-. Wisconsin, using a backup quarterback for most of the game, converted 9 of 16 third downs. Illinois did snag two interceptions by Eaton Spence and Clayton Fejedelem. Giving up a 56-yard run to Alex Erickson was a game-changer. \nSpecial teams \nC. Kicker Taylor Zalewski delivered with two field goals. V'Angelo Bentley was serviceable but didn't have a breakout run. Illinois started six drives at or inside its 20-yard line. \nCoaching \nC. The Illini had a chance to gain some leverage in the Big Ten West against Wisconsin. They even had a lead in the third quarter but lost momentum.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:38:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:09:27.175+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
