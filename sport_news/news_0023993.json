And there are those who still believe they have no business in the College Football Playoff conversation because of the way they are winning,\" Gemmell assesses. \"But so long as they keep winning, how they do it — or how they think they are doing it — really isn’t any of our business.\"\nElsewhere on ESPN, in a list of the 10 most memorable uniforms from around the country up to this point in the season, writer Sam Strong gave Utah's Homecoming throwback threads a nice review.\n\"It's no easy task to dig into the archives and find a uniform from a program's past that works at every level,\" Strong wrote. \"Utah circumvented that issue by wrapping the best of its history into one uniform.\"\nUtah State's Matt Wells on list of best mid-major coaches \nAggies rolled over Boise State last weekend, and on Monday, Sports Illustrated's Pete Thamel and Thayer Evans put him second on a list of the top 12 mid-major coaches behind only Memphis' Justin Fuente.\n\"Wells is 23–11 in his third season,\" they write, \"and he'll be a top candidate for any Pac-12 jobs—non-USC division—that open.\"\nRyan McDonald is a sports reporter at DeseretNews.com .
