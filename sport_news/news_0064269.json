(Image Source: USA TODAY Sports) \nHere’s a look at the Monday Night Football matchup between the San Diego Chargers and the Pittsburgh Steelers: \nSeries: Steelers Lead 21-7; Streaks: Steelers won 7 of past 9; Last Meeting: Chargers 34, Steelers 24 (12.09.12) \nTime: 8:30 PM ET; TV: ESPN (Mike Tirico, Jon Gruden & Lisa Salters) \nSpread: Chargers -3 ½; O/U 45 ½ \nInjury Report: Steelers: Out: QB Ben Roethlisberger (knee), LB Ryan Shazier (shoulder); Questionable: CB Cortez Allen (knee); Questionable: DT Daniel McCullers (knee), TE Matt Spaeth (hand), S Ross Ventrone (hamstring), WR Markus Wheaton (ankle) \nChargers : Out: OG Orlando Franklin (ankle), WR Stevie Johnson (hamstring), CB Craig Mager (hamstring), LB Tourek Williams (foot); Doubtful: OT King Dunlap (concussion); Questionable: WR Jacoby Jones (ankle), SS Jahleel Addae (ankle), OG D.J. Fluker (ankle), CB Jason Verrett (foot), C Chris Watt (groin), CB Brandon Flowers (concussion), WR Malcolm Floyd (concussion); Probable: OH Chris Hairston (ankle) \nWhere They Stand: The Pittsburgh Steelers are 2-2, in second place in the AFC North, however they are already 2.5 games in back of the Cincinnati Bengals (5-0) in the division. They are also 0-1 since QB Ben Roethlisberger went down with an injury. Pittsburgh hopes to tread water so that they are still in the Wild Card race when Big Ben returns, however the Steelers are 0-2 in conference games. The San Diego Chargers are also 2-2, and like Pittsburgh, they are in jeopardy of falling three games back in the division with a loss, as the Denver Broncos have jumped out to a 5-0 start. One difference is the Steelers are plus-21 in point differential, fifth in the AFC, while the Chargers are minus-14, tied for sixth worse in the conference. \nThe Steelers: Stepping in under center is QB Michael Vick , the NFL’s all-time leading rushing signal caller. He completed 19 of 26 passes (73.1 percent) including a TD (no INTs) in his only start this season, however managed just 124 yards through he air with a putrid 4.77 YPP average. WR Antonio Brown leads the NFL with 273 receptions and 3,675 receiving yards since 2013. He has six 100-yard games in his past eight but it’s hard to reach triple digits when your QB barely cracks the century mark. More likely to make an impact is RB Le’Veon Bell , who is averaging 160.5 yards from scrimmage with 10 TDs in his past 10 games. He went for 150 rushing yards last week, as the Steelers went to the ground game. A pair of DE’s will try to keep this one close and not force Vick to have to do too much. Stephon Tuitt has recorded 3.5 sacks in the past three games, while Cameron Heyward has a sack in two of the past three games. They will look to take advantage of a banged up San Diego O-line. \nThe Chargers: He may not have the Super Bowl rings that fellow Class of ’04 product Ben Roethlisberger does, but that doesn’t mean the Chargers are regretting selecting QB Phillip Rivers . The former No. 4 overall pick is second in the NFL (to former teammate Drew Brees ) with 37,755 passing yards since 2006 and he needs just two TD passes to tie Dave Krieg for 13 th on the all-time list. Third-year WR Keenan Allen is having a fabulous season and he has scored six TDs in his past eight games. The sure-handed Allen is complemented by the big-play ability of WR Malcom Floyd , who is third in the league since 2004, with his 17.2 YPC average (minimum 200 receptions). Emerging at TE is the athletic Ladarius Green who has caught a TD pass in two of the past three games. Veteran RB Danny Woodhead and rookie Melvin Gordon are sharing carries. Woodhead is coming off a career performance with 138 scrimmage yards last week (84 receiving) and Gordon was second among rookie runners with 228 rushing yards after four weeks. S Eric Weddle is coming off a 10-tackle effort last week and he leads the club with his 35 stops. He doesn’t mind providing run support, as long as the front seven helps the secondary in pass defense. Last week against the Browns, LB’s Jerry Attaochu (2 sacks) and Melvin Ingram (1.5 sacks) both set career highs in sacks, something San Diego needs them to do more of. \nPrediction: Judging by the throws Michael Vick was allowed to attempt against the Ravens last week, the Steelers don’t really trust their QB. He only had three days to get ready for Baltimore and has had extra time to prepare for their trip to SoCal, but that doesn’t mean Vick will be better. I will make him prove it, which is exactly what I expect the Chargers to do. Phillip Rivers, with no Ben Roethlisberger to counteract him, will be the difference on Monday night, as the Chargers get back over .500. \nScore: Chargers 24, Steelers 16 \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
