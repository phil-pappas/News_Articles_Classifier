Even Democrats worried about her general election prospects — a growing population — dismiss the possibility of her rival Bernie Sanders winning the nomination. And they are skeptical that Vice President Joe Biden will run or, if he did jump in, that he would win. The Republicans are in such chaos that a pathway to victory appears elusive.\nYet looking at Clinton's problems, and some of her less-often-cited promise, suggests how on the mark those odds may be.\nHer cavalier and clumsy reaction to the controversy over the use of her private email system as secretary of state is a case study in arrogance and poor political instincts. There probably isn't a smoking gun and the House Republicans' Benghazi investigative committee, before which she will testify next week, has been discredited as a partisan assault.\nYet she has taken a hit in the polls; voters don't like revisiting the trials and tribulations of Clintonland.\nFlip-flops show Hillary Clinton is long on ambition, short on principles Jonah Goldberg Hillary Rodham Clinton revealed Wednesday that she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, providing just the latest evidence that she is little more than political ambition wrapped in a pantsuit.\nPay attention to the press coverage, because it’s fascinating: Nobody takes Clinton at her...\nHillary Rodham Clinton revealed Wednesday that she opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, providing just the latest evidence that she is little more than political ambition wrapped in a pantsuit.\nPay attention to the press coverage, because it’s fascinating: Nobody takes Clinton at her...\n(Jonah Goldberg) The campaign makes surprising blunders, leaking stories about tactics — Hillary will offer a softer image — or her electoral firewalls.\nDemocratic professionals say that, in contrast to her last presidential campaign, she has strong leadership with John Podesta as chief executive and Robby Mook as campaign manager or chief operating officer. Privately, however, there is concern that crisis management sometimes comes down to a small coterie of personal intimates, her daughter, Chelsea, and Huma Abedin, a longtime aide and surrogate daughter.\nStill, there are also encouraging signs for her supporters. After stiffing the media for the first part of her campaign, Clinton has done well in a series of recent interviews. She hates the press but does better when she engages.\nNo campaign has offered more substance, even if it was overshadowed by the email contretemps. To be sure, some of this is politically calculated: Her biggest threat would be losing the first few nominating contests to Sanders, so her campaign is determined to protect the left flank.\nHillary Clinton op-ed: My plan to prevent the next financial crash Hillary Clinton Seven years after the financial crash, despite important new rules signed into law by President Barack Obama, there are risks in our financial system that could still cause another crisis. Banks have paid billions of dollars in fines, but few executives have been held personally accountable. \"Too...\nSeven years after the financial crash, despite important new rules signed into law by President Barack Obama, there are risks in our financial system that could still cause another crisis. Banks have paid billions of dollars in fines, but few executives have been held personally accountable. \"Too...\n(Hillary Clinton) Her only really egregious act of pandering was her announcement last week that she opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the trade agreement involving the U.S. and 11 countries, which will encompass 40 percent of the global economy. She long supported such a pact; her stated rationale for opposing it was specious and added to questions about her credibility or trustworthiness.\n(Some of the outrage from the Washington establishment, while justified, contrasts with the silence when it come to the disingenuous pandering of others: Jeb Bush's flip-flops on discrimination under the guise of protecting religious expression, or John Kasich who, under the shadow of Donald Trump, endorsed a wall along the Mexican border.)\nThere's a lot of real meat elsewhere. No one has offered a more sensible or feasible proposal to deal with the crushing debt imposed on many families by the costs of college. The same holds for her proposals to establish a sliding-scale capital gains tax rate, her focus on longer term economics, and initiatives to give financial regulators more powers and to impose a \"risk fee\" on big banks.\nThese offerings have drawn fire from the left and the right. But the financial measures were carefully crafted: She consulted experts including top Wall Street executives and former Rep. Barney Frank. Her July remarks on \"quarterly capitalism\" was one of the best economic speeches of this political season.\nThe two big tests she faces over the next 10 days — the debate and the Benghazi hearings — are opportunities to reaffirm the current odds and overcome much of this year's self-inflicted damage.\nBloomberg View\nAlbert Hunt is a Bloomberg columnist.\n Hillary Clinton Republican Party Jeb Bush John Podesta Barney Frank Huma Abedin Joe Biden", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561bb974/turbine/ct-hillary-clinton-benghazi-private-emails-20151012", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561b1dca/turbine/ct-hillary-clinton-trade-deal-20151011", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5616dda4/turbine/ct-hillary-clinton-wall-street-reforms-20151008"], "published": "2015-10-12T16:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:38:24.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
