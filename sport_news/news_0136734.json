(Photo: ADRIAN KRAUS) Buy Photo Story Highlights Derailed for the final 4 months last season by concussion issues, Nathan Lieuwen says he's just fine The fourth-year pro was among the AHL's top goalies in 2013-14 with the Amerks 11 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nWhen training camp began for the Buffalo Sabres and Nathan Lieuwen skated into the goal crease, there may have been as many people watching out of curiosity as there were from an evaluation standpoint. \nWas he healthy? Was the old Lieuwen, the one who played so well for the Rochester Americans in 2013-14, ready to reclaim his standing on the depth chart? \nThe organization really didn't know. \nHe hadn't faced real shots since Dec. 19, missing the final four months of last season due to lingering concussion issues, so even the coaches were anxious to find out. \nLieuwen was injured on April 6, 2014, in a goal-mouth collision with Philadelphia Flyers forward Jay Rosehill. It was at least the fourth significant concussion he has suffered, the first of which was in an auto accident at age 16. \nHe seemed to be fine last season but revealed to the Amerks coaches that he was having vision problems on the ice. A neurologist said the issues were related to his latest concussion and he was shut down for the remainder of the season. \nLieuwen's play in camp says he is just fine. And he made that very clear on Monday after the Amerks practiced at Blue Cross Arena at the Rochester Community War Memorial. \n\"I feel I'm a way better goalie than I was before,\" he said. \"Things are good.\" \nLieuwen played in a pair of Sabres preseason games. He then played for the Amerks in Saturday's preseason game at Binghamton, He made 26 saves in the 6-2 victory. \n\" 'Louie' was excellent,\" Amerks coach Randy Cunneyworth said. \"We're pleasantly pleased he's responded as he has. That has kind of helped the confidence level of the coaches.\" \nDue to Lieuwen's injury, and an unspectacular season from Andrey Makarov a year ago, goaltending has been considered an uncertainty for the Amerks. \nBut if Lieuwen can again play as he did in 2013-14 — when he had the AHL's eighth-best goals-against average (2.34) and fourth-best save percentage (.922) — there won't be cause for concern. \nHe's intent on being that goaltender again. He's not at all worried about any concussion issues. \n\"If that was in my head, I don't think I would have been able to come back the way I have,\" he said. \"To be honest, I'm very confident in my body, my brain and my skills.\" \nHe's also thankful that he is again healthy. He has spent too much time already in his career on the sideline. \n\"It's not fun when you're sitting watching,\" he said. \"Being able to contribute in a positive way is very rewarding.\" \nKEVINO@gannett.com \nGarbowsky sent to Elmira \nThe Amerks assigned former Rochester Institute of Technology standout Matt Garbowsky to Elmira of the ECHL on Monday. \nGarbowsky signed an AHL/ECHL contract with the Amerks in March. There was stiff competition at forward with the Amerks, especially with 13 players on NHL contracts. \nAlso assigned to Elmira: winger Colin Jacobs and goalie C.J. Motte. Defenseman Zach Tolkinen was released from the training-camp tryout and will report to Elmira. \nCenter Cal O'Reilly also officially joined the Amerks at noon Monday after clearing waivers. With a salary of $700,000 regardless of where he plays (NHL or AHL), there was almost no chance he would be claimed. 11 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.rocne.ws/1LeOOrP TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T04:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:31:29.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
