That's what the Chase for the Sprint Cup is like.\nAdChoices You'd start out with the full group of people and lots of chairs. The music would play and you'd be pretty confident when it stopped, you'd find a seat. You could rush forward for one or step back and find a seat that way.\nMORE: Kenseth on pole | Harvick looking forward | Schedule; green flag, 7 p.m. ET\nThen chairs were taken away. There are fewer people, too. Tension built. Then more people are eliminated and fewer chairs remain. The area where the chairs sit is much tighter and participants move with more hesitation and react faster.\nSo, put it in terms of NASCAR's championship series. Starting Saturday at Charlotte, there are four fewer drivers in the Contender Round, and the field will be pared to eight after the next three races. Chase participants have three chances to advance by winning races. The remaining five spots go to the drivers with the most points after the third race.\nMORE: Ranking Contender Round drivers | Race picks, odds\nFewer drivers, fewer spots, more tension. NASCAR loves this. Saturday at the Bank of America 500 at Charlotte, you likely will, too.\nTake last year's race, for example. Under the lights on a beautiful North Carolina night, Kevin Harvick punched his ticket to the third round , the Elimination Round, of the Chase. The win proved to be a driving force in Harvick winning the Sprint Cup title.\nPHOTOS: 2015 Cup winners | Gordon's final season | Stockcar Toon\nBut all everyone seems to remember is the post-race fight between Denny Hamlin and Brad Keselowski . And when Keselowski hit the cars of Matt Kenseth and Tony Stewart on pit road. And Kenseth's confrontation with Keselowski after the race.\nDrama ... NASCAR style.\nOn Saturday, there likely will be similar incidents in the Bank of America 500 — not just ones off the track following the race. Will we remember who won the race or will something else leave a lasting impression?\nLet's at least take a look at the drivers who could end up setting off fireworks of their own with a win on Saturday.\n1. Kyle Busch\n© Provided by Sporting News Thursday qualifying: 2nd\nLast year's race: 5th\nHe's had good runs at Charlotte but, surprisingly, has never won a Sprint Cup race there. He marked his return after the terrible crash at Daytona in February by placing 11th in the Coca-Cola 500 in May. He was second in last year's race and has 10 top-five finishes in 23 races at the track. The Joe Gibbs Racing assault on the title could very well start with Busch winning and advancing to the next round.\n2. Kurt Busch\n© Provided by Sporting News Thursday's qualifying: 6th\nLast year's race: 11th\nHe's only won once at Charlotte, the 2010 May race, and has just three top-10 finishes (4th, 3rd, 10th) since. It feels like he's been lying in the weeds since his win at Michigan, getting just three top-10 finishes over the past eight races. Teammate Kevin Harvick showed what he could do last week at Dover (legit or not). Now would be a great time for Busch to do the same.\n3. Carl Edwards\n© Provided by Sporting News Thursday qualifying: 8th\nLast year's race: 8th\nWInning at Charlotte back in May jump-started his team after a slow start to the season adjusting to the move from a Ford to Toyota. Since then, he's performed well and has seemingly found the groove he had while pursing a Chase title last year. He's another Joe Gibbs Racing car that could very well end up in victory lane with the rare Charlotte sweep (the last driver to win both Sprint Cup races at the track in a single year was Kasey Kahne in 2006).\n4. Kevin Harvick\n© Provided by Sporting News Thursday qualifying: 11th\nLast year's race: 1st\nThe win at Charlotte was the first of three he picked up in the Chase on the way to his first Sprint Cup title. He led 162 laps last year, including the final 17. He not only will be out to do that again to advance in the Chase, he'll also be looking to put the controversy behind him with last week's win .\n5. Matt Kenseth\n© Provided by Sporting News Thursday's qualifying: 1st\nLast year's race: 19th\nHe knows how to win there, picking up two victories at the track in his career, the last in 2011. Plus, he has 10 top-fives and the power of Joe Gibbs Racing pushing what may be his best performance since he won the Sprint Cup title in 2003. He's proven so far to be the best driver in the Chase with his steady performance. A win Saturday would only state his case further.\n6. Our picks\n© Provided by Sporting News In addition to our normal group, we'll have a pick from NBC Sports announcer Rich Allen, the lead voice for the Sprint Cup races.\nRick Allen, NBC Sports: My pick is Jimmie Johnson. After last week his team will want to prove that if it had advanced, it would be the team to beat for the championship.\nJeff Owens, SN deputy editor of operations, former NASCAR editor: Matt Kenseth is stout on 1.5-mile tracks, so this round starts just like the last one — with a Joe Gibbs Racing victory.\nJason O. Boyd, SN NASCAR writer: If Kevin Harvick can win when he needs it the most, as was the case last week at Dover, then so can Kyle Busch. He doesn't NEED to win on Saturday, but he almost proved one mistake (running out of gas at New Hampshire) can cost you a title, just like Harvick. He's running too well to see his Chase chances end with another mistake. A win Saturday will ease the tension for a couple of weeks.\nJoe Rodgers, SN writer: Jimmie Johnson is out for vengeance after being eliminated from the Chase at Dover and what better track to win at then Charlotte, where he has seven victories. Johnson also owns the No. 1 driver rating at Charlotte (109.6) and leads all active drivers in the Sprint Cup in laps led at Charlotte with 1,733 laps led in 28 starts.\nLinemakers: Linemakers' Micah Roberts gives Kevin Harvick the edge at Charlotte.
