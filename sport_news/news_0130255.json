Bucksport's quarterback has become a very accurate passer and he has several good receivers to throw to.” \nMount View rushed for more than 474 yards on the day, with Tyler Ripley again shouldering the load for the 'Stangs. \nRipley rushed for 205 yards and four touchdowns, along with a pair of two-point conversions. Jack Axsom also rushed for 122 yards on 17 carries, while Gavin Simpson averaged more than 18 yards per carry against the Golden Bucks. \n“We trailed Bucksport by a point at halftime, but fortunately we deferred our coin toss choice to the second half and we scored on the opening possession,” said Pratt. “Our special teams played extremely well setting up second-half scores and our defense finally forced a fumble and interception to help our cause.” \nSimpson and Devon Davis also played well on special teams, while quarterback Cole Hannan and Darrin Cook averaged more than five yards per carry in the win, the coach said. \nNow the Mustangs turn their attention to Mattanawcook Academy of Lincoln (5-1), one of teams they look up at in Class D North along with unbeaten Maine Central Institute of Pittsfield (6-0). \n“They are good offensively and defensively,” said Pratt of the Lynx. “They have a very good tailback, a strong running quarterback and several good receivers. Our defense will have to play well again this week and our offense will have to find more ways to get in the end zone.” \nIn the Maine Principals' Association Crabtree Point Standings for Class D North, Mount View (4-2, 121.2455 points) is third, while MCI (6-0, 150.0000 points) is first in the 12-team region. \nCourier Publications' sports staff can be reached by email at sports@villagesoup.com or by phone at 594-4401.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:29:17.159+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
