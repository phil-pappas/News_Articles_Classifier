I’m proud of the effort,” Coach Jamie Opfer said. “We just try to get better every day.” \nAfter the Bluejay defense forced a Schuyler punt on the first Warrior possession, they Jays marched 31 yards in six plays before losing the ball on a fumble. Schuyler took over on its own 48. Bailey Haas sacked the Schuyler quarterback on first down, but a facemask penalty negated the lost yardage. \nOn second and eight, Corbin Ruth intercepted a pass and returned the ball to the Warrior 45 with 6:02 to go in the first quarter. \nSix plays later, Scott Wolverton found Brady Fitzke in the end zone. Fitzke tipped the pass to himself and made the catch for six points with 3:25 to go in the quarter. Cayden Glandt made the point after for a 7-0 lead. \nAnother Warrior punt gave the Jays the ball at midfield late in the first quarter. A holding penalty against the Jays pushed them back to the Schuyler 46. Wolverton called his own number and raced 54 yards for the touchdown on the first play of the second quarter. The two-point conversion attempt came up short, leaving the score 13-0 with 11:49 to go in the first half. \nAnother sack on third down, this one by Josh Behlen, forced another Schuyler punt, which Ruth returned to the Warrior 11. Four plays later, Wolverton scored from two yards out. Glandt’s PAT extended the lead to 20-0 with 8:05 to go in the half. \nAfter Schuyler’s fourth punt of the first half, Seward used 10 plays to go 64 yards. Wolverton found Fitzke for a 17-yard touchdown pass with 1:12 to go. Glandt’s kick sailed wide, leaving the score 27-0. \nOn Schuyler’s next play from scrimmage, Nate Rech intercepted the pass, giving Seward the ball back with 1:04 left. Five plays later, Wolverton and Fitzke connected again, this time for a 25-yard scoring strike as time expired. Glandt made the PAT for a 33-0 lead at halftime. \nSeward took the second-half kickoff and marched 65 yards in nine plays, finishing with an eight-yard run by Wolverton with 7:48 to go in the quarter. Glandt made the PAT for a 40-0 lead. Because the margin was greater than 35 points, the clock ran continuously for the rest of the game. \nThe Bluejay defense forced another Schuyler punt, and the offense took over at its own 32. An eight-play drive ended in a 12-yard run by Connor Ruth with 42 seconds left in the quarter. Glandt’s PAT made the score 47-0. \nThe Jays were able to move the ball on their final possession but chose to take a knee on first and goal on the game’s final play. \nWolverton was Seward’s leading rusher, carrying 15 times for 137 yards. Corbin Ruth added 83 yards on 17 carries. \nWolverton also completed 10 of 13 pass attempts for 144 yards and three touchdowns. Fitzke had five catches for 75 yards. \nThe Bluejay defense allowed -1 yards rushing and 22 passing for the Warriors. Seward did not punt at all in the game. \nOn defense, Riley Kamphaus finished with two solo tackles and one assist. Six Bluejays had one solo tackle each in the game. \nEveryone got a chance to play in the game, and Opfer said he was pleased with how his younger players approached the opportunity. \nEven though the game was against a winless opponent, Opfer said the team prepares the same. \n“We just worry about what we can do,” he said. \nThe goal is always to establish a running game, which opens up the play-action passing options. \n“If you can do that, you have a chance to be successful,” he said. \nThe Jays (2-3) will host Norris Friday, Oct. 2, at 7 p.m. Opfer said the Titans are a good football team, and the Jays will have to stay disciplined.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:09:18.087+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
