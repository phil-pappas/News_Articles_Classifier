BC has easily the No. 1-ranked defense in the country by yards allowed, and held up well against strong ACC offenses Florida State and Duke. They Eagles have not yet seen a player as dynamic and versatile as Clemson quarterback Deshaun Watson. The leading candidate for ACC Player of the Year operates the league’s third-best scoring offense (35.4 ppg).\n2. True freshman Jeff Smith has the keys to the BC offense, a desperation move likely to run through season’s end. The read-option QB leads the team is rushing, with 253 yards and three touchdowns on 37 carries.\n3. BC is last in the ACC in passing offense, but the problem begins and ends at quarterback. Young receivers Thadd Smith, Sherman Alston and Elijah Robinson all have the speed to give the Eagles a vertical passing game. If they can draw more than single coverage, it would limit the bodies Clemson can load into the box to stop BC’s power run game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:21:14.197+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
