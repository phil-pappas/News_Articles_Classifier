(AP) - Jay Cutler led Chicago to a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns, including an alert toss to running back Matt Forte with 18 seconds left, giving the Bears a stunning 18-17 victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday. \nThe Bears (2-3) trailed 17-3 early in the third quarter when Chiefs running back Jamaal Charles went down with a potentially serious knee injury. Kansas City's offense quickly dropped off, and that allowed Chicago to mount a comeback for its second straight last-minute win. \nCutler threw for 252 yards and two touchdowns, the first a 22-yard strike to Marquess Wilson with 3:05 left in the game. After the Bears forced a quick three-and-out, Cutler drove them inside the 10-yard line. He took a snap in the shotgun, dropped it, then spotted Forte in the end zone. \nThe Chiefs (1-4) tried a 66-yard field goal that came up short as time expired. \nRAMS-PACKERS \nPackers' defense backs Rodgers in 24-10 win over Rams \nGREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) - Aaron Rodgers threw for two touchdowns and 241 yards, and the Green Bay Packers held off the St. Louis Rams for a 24-10 win on Sunday in spite of three turnovers by their normally mistake-free quarterback. \nRodgers connected with receivers Ty Montgomery and James Jones for long scoring strikes. \nBut NFL-record streaks of 587 pass attempts and 49 touchdown passes at home without an interception for Rodgers ended in the first quarter on linebacker James Laurinaitis' diving pick of a tipped ball for the Rams (2-3). \nRodgers threw another interception in the second quarter before losing a fumble in the third. \nRelentless pressure on quarterback Nick Foles helped keep the Packers (5-0) unbeaten. Foles threw a career-worst four interceptions, two in the fourth quarter inside the Packers 10. \nNLDS-CARDINALS-CUBS \nCardinals bracing for Game 3 of NLDS against Arrieta, Cubs \nCHICAGO (AP) - St. Louis manager Mike Matheny says the Cardinals are preparing for Game 3 of the NL Division Series in \"the same boring way\" they have all season long. \nThe Cardinals and the Chicago Cubs are tied at one game apiece heading into the first playoff game at Wrigley Field in seven years. Oh, the Cubs also will have Jake Arrieta on the mound on Monday night for his first start since he shut out Pittsburgh in the wild-card game. \nMatheny says the Cardinals have been counted out before against ace pitchers in the postseason, and then had success. But the NL Central champions are heading for quite a challenge in Arrieta, who hasn't lost at home since July 25. \nArrieta says the Cubs are \"in a great spot.\" \nCHICAGO MARATHON \nKenya's Chumba, Kiplagat win titles at Chicago Marathon \nCHICAGO (AP) - Dickson Chumba broke away from a three-man pack in the 23rd mile and easily outdistanced the field for his first Chicago Marathon title Sunday. \nThe 29-year-old Kenyan finished the 26.2-mile course in 2 hours, 9 minutes, 25 seconds, while fellow Kenyan Sammy Kitwara was 25 seconds back for his second consecutive runner-up finish in Chicago. \nSammy Ndungu completed Kenya's podium sweep. \nFlorence Kiplagat won the women's race in an unofficial 2:23:33. \nThe 28-year-old Kenyan, the half marathon world-record holder, pulled away late. Ethiopian Yebrgual Melese was second in an unofficial 2:23:43. \nThe men's and women's winners each won $100,000. \nSunday's race was the first without pace-setters, which officials said would result in a more competitive but slower event with record-breaking performances less likely. \nCHICAGO MARATHON-HEART ATTACK \nParamedic revives marathon runner who suffered heart attack \nCHICAGO (AP) - A man running in the Chicago Marathon has been revived by a paramedic after suffering an apparent heart attack. \nChicago Fire Department spokesman Larry Langford says the man in his 60s fell to the ground about 9:40 a.m. Sunday at Lake Shore Drive and Melrose Street on the city's North Side. He says a fire department paramedic used an automatic external defibrillator to restore the man's heart rhythm to normal. \nThe Chicago Tribune reports ( http://trib.in/1Mq5FbZ ) that the man was taken by ambulance to a hospital where his condition stabilized. His name was not immediately released. \nUS ROSTER \nBradley, Dempsey out for US exhibition vs Costa Rica \nCHICAGO (AP) - Michael Bradley and Clint Dempsey won't play for the U.S. in its exhibition against Costa Rica on Tuesday. \nA day after the Americans lost to Mexico in the playoff for CONCACAF's spot in the 2017 Confederations Cup, coach Jurgen Klinsmann announced his roster for the game at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, New Jersey. \nDefenders DaMarcus Beasley and Matt Besler, midfielders Kyle Beckerman and Graham Zusi, forward Chris Wondolowski and goalkeeper Nick Rimando were also released from camp Sunday. \nJoining the squad are midfielders Mix Diskerud, Lee Nguyen and Brek Shea, forward Andrew Wooten and goalkeeper Bill Hamid. \nTuesday's exhibition is the United States' final match before the start of qualifying for the 2018 World Cup.
