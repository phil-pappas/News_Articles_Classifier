Two plays later Neaville sneaked in for the touchdown. \nWest Memphis (3-2, 1-1) marched to the Searcy 15, but the drive broke down on second and 3 when junior Martavous Thomas hauled in a pass from quarterback Kylin Whiting and couldn't get out of bounds before the clock ran out. \nSearcy Coach Mark Kelley said he felt his team was fortunate to survive three second-half turnovers. \n\"We escaped with a win, and I emphasize escape,\" said Kelley. \"You turn it over three times like that you start thinking maybe this isn't your night.\" \nSearcy rushed out to a 14-0 lead on two touchdowns by Dixon, one of which was on the ground and the other a 10-yard pass from Neaville, who was 15 of 31 passing for 202 yards. \nSearcy held a 21-14 halftime lead despite giving up 106 yards rushing on 8 carries to Thomas. \nThe Blue Devils tied the game 21-21 on a 64-yard touchdown by junior Jonathan Craig with 6:55 to play in the third quarter and they took a brief 27-21 lead on a 9-yard touchdown by Devontae Dean with 10:56 to play in the fourth quarter. \nAfter West Memphis' Jerry Edwards intercepted a Neaville pass, the Blue Devils had an opportunity to widen their margin, but came up short on fourth and 1 from the Searcy 28, giving Neaville plenty of time to lead his offense for the game-tying touchdown. \n\"We really had to have [Neaville and Dixon] on that last drive, and they stepped up and made the big plays,\" Kelley added. \nJONESBORO 51, LR CENTRAL 27 \nJONESBORO — Princeton Pitts rushed for 153 yards and four touchdowns to lead Jonesboro (4-1, 2-0) to a 7A/6A East victory over Little Rock Central (1-4, 1-1). Jonesboro also scored on a fake punt in the third quarter to take a 35-point lead. \nNORTH LITTLE ROCK 62, \nMOUNTAIN HOME 6 \nMOUNTAIN HOME — Alex Day ran for three touchdowns to lead North Little Rock (1-4, 1-1) to a 7A/6A-East Conference victory over Mountain Home (1-4, 0-2). \nNorth Little Rock ran up a 41-6 halftime lead. \nCorvesea Cooney’s 1-yard quarterback sneak and Savannah Melton’s extra point gave the Charging Wildcats a 7-0 lead. Day’s first touchdown came on a 50-yard run for a 14-0 first quarter lead after Melton’s kick. \nTouchdown passes of 32 yards by Cooney and 34 yards from Trey Cox both went to Kyleal Lewis. After Garrett Larson’s interception, Day scored on a 13-yard run. Cox completed a 25-yard touchdown pass for a 41-6 halftime lead. Melton was good on three of the four second-quarter extra-point attempts. \nDay rushed for 48 yards for his third touchdown and Wynton Ruth’s 4-yard touchdown run, both in the third quarter, put North Little Rock ahead 55-6. Melton was good on both extra points. \nNorth Little Rock scored its final touchdown on Marcus Christopher’s 11-yard run in the fourth quarter. Melton converted her eighth extra point after the score. \n7A-WEST \nROGERS 28, \nROGERS HERITAGE 6 \nROGERS — Rogers (1-4, 1-1) ran for 306 yards as it wore down crosstown-rival Rogers Heritage (0-5, 0-2) in a 7A-West Conference game at Whitey Smith Stadium. \nMilacio Freeland carried 11 times for 98 yards, including a 21-yard touchdown run, to lead Rogers.
