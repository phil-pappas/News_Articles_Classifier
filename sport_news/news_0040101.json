They are used on about 850,000 people each year in the United States alone.\nThe ones available now in the U.S. are permanent metal implants. Abbott's Absorb stent, already sold in Europe, is made of a material that degrades over several years. It performed as well as but not better than a conventional stent for preventing reclogging in the one-year study.\nResults were discussed Monday at a conference in San Francisco and published online by the New England Journal of Medicine.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
