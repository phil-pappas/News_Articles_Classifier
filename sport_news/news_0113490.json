It was not pretty -- to say the least -- but Baltimore found a way to keep its season alive for at least another week. Down by 13 at one point, the Ravens forced overtime with a field goal, then shut down division rival Pittsburgh Steelers on two fourth-down plays before kicking another field for the win on Thursday evening.\nDown three late, Joe Flacco , who was not all that great for most of the game, managed to engineer the offense down the field without Steve Smith -- he'd left the game with an injury -- and set up Justin Tucker's field goal that sent the game into overtime. Just under 10 minutes of sloppy play later, Tucker kicked another field goal to seal the win.\n52 yards. OT. Justin Tucker : For the win! #BALvsPIT #TNF http://t.co/D6aKseugRs \n— NFL (@NFL) October 2, 2015 When you kick the game-winning field goal! #BALvsPIT #FootballIsFamily pic.twitter.com/vRkUeQum4S \n— NFL (@NFL) October 2, 2015 Flacco's work certainly wasn't stylish. It wasn't even all that effective -- he finished the game 20 of 33 for 189 yards, a touchdown, an interception and a lost fumble. But it was enough, and that's pretty much all that matters.\nIt was enough because the Steelers just kept finding ways to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory. They barely moved the ball for most of the night as well, even if Le'Veon Bell wound up with a nice-looking stat line. They converted only two of 13 third downs. They didn't take a single shot down the field to Antonio Brown . Mike Vick was conservative with the football to a fault, taking sacks on multiple plays where he had receivers open.\nAnd then there were those fourth downs. Mike Tomlin twice elected to go for it on fourth down rather than kick. He was, to be fair, justified in those decisions. Kicker Josh Scobee missed two field goals for the second time this season and could not reasonably be relied upon to knock the winner through the uprights. The play calls on those fourth downs, though, left much to be desired.\nOn the first possession of overtime, the Steelers had 4th-and-2 from the Baltimore 39-yard line. With Le'Veon Bell in the lineup and the backup quarterback under center, you'd think Pittsburgh would do the obvious thing. Instead, Todd Haley called for Vick to run a sweep to the left; the short side of the field. The sweep was stuffed and the Ravens took over control of the football.\nBaltimore would punt on the ensuing drive, and a few plays later the Steelers faced 4th-and-1, this time from the Ravens' 33-yard line. Rather than hand the ball to Bell, they called for Vick to drop back and pass. It was an out route that was wide open, but as you can see below, Vick airmailed it, setting up Baltimore for the game winning drive.\nIf Mike Vick completes this 4th and 1 pass to Antonio Brown, this game might have ended very differently. #BALvsPIT http://t.co/rT9wmyi26c \n— NFL (@NFL) October 2, 2015 Here are a few more things to know about this AFC North showdown ... \n2. The streak is over: For 35 straight games (36 including the playoffs), Antonio Brown had recorded at least five catches and 50 receiving yards. That streak came to an end in this one, as Brown indeed hauled in five Mike Vick tosses, but they totaled only 42 yards. The streak -- which began back on Sept. 8, 2013 -- officially lasted 753 days.\nI guess you could say he's still on a 36-game streak (37 including the playoffs) of at least five catches, though, which highlights the fact that the 5-and-50 streak itself ultimately wasn't much more than an interesting tidbit -- that it ended doesn't make Brown any worse of a player. He's still arguably the best receiver in football. He just may not get quite the volume of catches or yards with Vick under center that he did with Ben Roethlisberger , a fact that was underscored by his relatively low level of involvement in this game.\n3. Return of the run: The Ravens can look back on this game as having brought one more good thing: the return of their rushing attack. Things were on point right from the start when Baltimore handed it off -- they ran for 47 yards and a touchdown on eight first-quarter carries. Justin Forsett , who'd been struggling badly, racked up 150 rushing yards, which exceeded his total from the first three games combined. (I detailed what was behind the early-season struggles in our Thursday Night Football game preview , noting that Forsett could likely make some hay up the middle. That wound up working out pretty well.) Not much else went right for Baltimore, even in victory, but if they can get the best part of their offense back on track, that should open things up elsewhere.\n4. Get to know Ross Cockrell : Who? Exactly. Pittsburgh's sub-package corner -- signed shortly before the season after being cut by the Buffalo Bills -- was involved in a few big plays in this one. He picked off Joe Flacco early on, thanks to the Ravens QB misreading the coverage on a zone blitz:\nGIF: Almost looks like Joe Flacco is point shaving on this pick pic.twitter.com/Xcagyw5oHt \n— The Cauldron (@TheCauldron) October 2, 2015 On the first play of the third quarter, he made an incredible play to scoop a Flacco fumble before it rolled out of bounds.\nGIF: Great play by Russ Cockrell on after Flacco was stripped & fumbled pic.twitter.com/SKdslzPoyk \n— The Cauldron (@TheCauldron) October 2, 2015 He also got beat by Baltimore wideout Kamar Aiken for a touchdown, but we're not here to bury the guy, so that play goes in a link .\n5. The streak is over (Part II): The Ravens allowed a 100-yard rusher for the first time since Week 6 of the 2013 season, when Eddie Lacy toted it 22 times for 129 yards. (This was one of Chris Trapasso's five stats to know for the game.) Le'Veon Bell is the man who ended the streak, carrying 21 times for 126 yards.\n6. Vick's debut: Mike Vick didn't have a bad debut, but he pretty clearly hindered the Pittsburgh passing attack. He missed a few easy throws, neglected to even try a few others, and forced the Steelers to rely more on a slow-developing, medium-depth passing game rather than the short-and-quick or test-em-deep throws Ben Roethlisberger usually makes. He finished the game 19 of 26 for 124 yards and a touchdown. He was working on a short week of practice, though, and he'll have a few extra days to prepare for his next game. Justin Tucker knocks home the game-winning field goal.
