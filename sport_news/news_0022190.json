Many felt he was past his prime as far as his batting abilities were concerned. \nHowever, in a minor relief to Dhoni, Gavaskar, one of the most respected voices in Indian cricket, has hit out his critics. Gavaskar asked them to \"lay off\" Dhoni and not to make him a \"scapegoat\" for the narrow loss at Green Park Stadium on Sunday (October 11). \nGavaskar said Dhoni had 3 to 5 years of international cricket left in him and went on to add that retiring from Tests will prolong the right-hander's limited overs career. \nThe former captain made these comments on \"NDTV\" news channel last night (October 12). Gavaskar said it was wrong to blame Dhoni alone for defeat and asked why people were not talking about the failures of Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Stuart Binny and the team's bowling. Gavaskar also heaped praise on Dhoni calling him a \"special\" and \"extraordinary\" player. \nIndia and South Africa play the 2nd ODI at Indore's Holkar Stadium tomorrow (October 14). \nOneIndia News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T09:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:44:11.010+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
