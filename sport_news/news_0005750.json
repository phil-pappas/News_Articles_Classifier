Eighty-four percent of Oregon voters said they thought mass shootings are \"mostly the result of unidentified and untreated mental health problems.\"\nRespondents to the OPB poll were much more closely divided about whether the existing gun laws are too lenient or too strict.\nForty-five percent said it's too easy for violent people to obtain firearms while 53 percent disagree.\nAt the same time, 41 percent said the laws were too strict and that mass shooters could be stopped if more people were carrying guns and ready to defend themselves. Fifty-four percent disagreed with that contention.\nThis sharp divide is seen in national surveys, which show Americans split between those who think it is more important to protect gun rights and those who want to control gun ownership.\nIn the OPB poll, a strong majority of Oregon voters – 68 percent -- said they support mandatory mental health screening before someone could purchase \"assault guns, including semi and fully automatic rifles.\"\nIn addition, 69 percent said they support higher taxes to support more mental health treatment. And 55 percent said they favor making it \"easier to institutionalize someone who is showing signs of mental health problems that could lead to violence.\"\nWhile there is widespread concern about mental illness and gun violence, many experts note that those with mental illness are more likely to be the victims of crime than to engage in violence and that it is hard to identify who is at risk of violent behavior.\nThe Oregon Legislature took one step toward dealing with mental illness and gun violence by passing legislation that directed judges to decide whether they should remove a person's gun rights while they are undergoing court-ordered mental health treatment. That was included in a highly debated bill expanding background checks to cover private gun transfers.\nThe OPB poll found that 74 percent support taking gun rights away from someone convicted of a violent misdemeanor. Currently, the law bars felons from possessing guns , as well as those convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence and those convicted of misdemeanors carrying a maximum term of more than year in prison.\nThree-fourths of voters said they support a waiting period to purchase guns and 62 percent said they back limiting the number of firearms that someone can purchase at one time.\nNearly half -- 49 percent -- said more law-abiding citizens should be encouraged to carry concealed handguns so they are prepared to \"stop a mass shooter before he starts\" while 46 percent are opposed.\nAt the same time, 58 percent said they would oppose increasing taxes on ammunition for some types of guns to make them more expensive to use.\nThe OPB poll was conducted by DHM Research of Portland and has a margin of error of 4.9 percentage points, plus or minus.\nThe Oct. 8-11 telephone survey included 400 Oregonians and 400 Washingtonians likely to vote in the 2016 election.\n--Jeff Mapes\njmapes@oregonian.com\n503-221-8209\n@jeffmapes", "external_links": ["http://www.oregon.gov/osp/ID/docs/Things%20to%20Know%20When%20Purchasing%20a%20Firearm_Master%20Copy%20032615.pdf", "http://www.opb.org/news/article/poll-mass-shootings-are-a-mental-health-problem/", "http://www.pewresearch.org/data-trend/domestic-issues/gun-control/"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:09:17.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
