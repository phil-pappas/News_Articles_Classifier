Quarterback Brendan Lawler then kept the ball for the 2-point conversion and a 29-21 lead. \nBoth teams added fourth quarter scores as Salem’s Christian Lamb caught a 17 yard touchdown pass from Seth Hobson. Anderson then scored on a 6 yard run for the Pirates and if that didn’t put the game away, then the next two plays did. \nFirst, Garrett Woods, acting as a holder from kick formation, threw a 2-point conversion pass to Jamal Long. After Salem took over at their own 35, a Lamb pass hung just a little too long in the air, allowing Boley the interception and the Pirates the opportunity to run clock. \nAlthough the Lions put more points on the board than in recent years, the Pirate defense still turned in a solid performance as they allowed only 288 yards, 133 on the ground. \nCharlestown provided 380 yards of offense with 349 coming on the ground as Lawler gained 114 yards on 10 carries while Boley gained 93 yards on 20 carries. \nSalem was led by Hobson, who completed 13-of-30 passes for 155 yards with one interception and two touchdowns. Both touchdown tosses went to to Lamb, who pulled in five Hobson passes for 71 yards. \nOne thing the Pirates must correct if this season is to be successful is penalties. Against Salem, they were flagged nine times for 152 yards. \nBoth teams will resume MSC play next week as Charlestown will host Corydon Central, while Salem will host Eastern. \nCHARLESTOWN 37, SALEM 27 \nSalem 15 3 3 6—27 \nCharlestown 7 14 8 8—37 \nSCORING SUMMARY \nS — Hobson 1 run (Morris kick), 7:30. \nC — Syd Gieseking 6 run (Dalton Bowen kick), 6:35. \nS — Lamb 14 pass from Hobson (Daulton run), 1:41. \nSecond quarter \nC — Tate Boley 38 run (run failed), 11:48. \nS — Thompson 27 field goal, 5:44. \nC — Gieseking 2 run (Jamal Long from Brendan Lawler), :53. \nThird quarter \nS — Thompson 23 field goal, 3:21. \nC — Lawler 43 run (Lawler run), :14. \nFourth quarter \nS — Lamb 17 pass from Hobson (pass failed), 8:45. \nC — Jarren Anderson 6 run (Long from Garrett Woods), 3:57. \nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS \nRushing \nSalem (27-133): Hobson 15-102, Kalb 11-23, Akers 1-8. \nCharlestown (53-349): Lawler 10-114, Anderson 20-93, Boley 3-47, Antonyo Gaddie 6-46, Gieseking 11-42, Christian Davenport 1-7. \nPassing", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:40:45.147+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
