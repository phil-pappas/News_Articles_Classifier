That is a very good team we lost to.” \nHarrison has won 12 straight SWOC games and improved to 14-0 overall and 6-0 in the SWOC. Edgewood had a three-game winning streak snapped in falling to 10-5, 4-2. \n“We ran into a buzzsaw,” Stratton said. “They play a great non-conference schedule, they’re a good program and they gel well together. They are tough to knock off.” \nThe Cougars had their chances in the first half to make the Wildcats sweat. \nAfter Harrison had taken a 1-0 lead with 30:18 on the clock, junior Alison Siler rifled a shot that hit off the crossbar and out to Bailey Haynes. \nHowever, both of Haynes’ rebound opportunities struck the Harrison keeper to keep Edgewood scoreless. \n“I think if we could have got that one it would have changed the outlook of the game,” Stratton said. “We don’t play well when we are down and the crossbar was unkind to us. It was just very, very unlucky and you have to take advantage of those opportunities because their defense makes you work for everything.” \nEdgewood held a 3-2 advantage in shots at the half, but Harrison out-shot Edgewood 10-1 in the second half, scoring twice in the first 20 minutes to open a 4-0 lead. \n“I could tell from our body language that we were getting down on ourselves,” Stratton said. “We have to learn to play through some of that instead of letting it get to us. Harrison was just like a shark with blood in the water at that point and it was on from there.” \nHaynes had the lone shot for the Cougars in the second half, but her shot from just inside the 18 was corralled by the Harrison keeper. The Wildcats closed the scoring with less than a minute left. \n“That third goal took the wind out of our sails and frustration just set in,” Stratton said. “We had that look of defeat set in and that is something we have worked on all season. We have to get over this and come back strong for Senior Night.” \nEdgewood closes the regular season Thursday when it hosts Ursuline Academy.
