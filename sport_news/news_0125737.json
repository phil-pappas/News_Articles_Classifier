While holding Blackhawks senior Jaylin Barmer in check before he left with a fractured wrist, “we had too many turnovers and penalties. I wasn’t too happy with our performance. \nThe win gave the Falcons a 3-0 record in inter-area play with one home game to go against a team from Dubai next week. The Blackhawks fell to 3-3 on the season. \nMatt Neehan, the son of a 1989 West Point graduate, got it done on both sides of the ball, rushing 12 times for 112 yards, recording 11 tackles and an interception and catching three passes for 57 yards. He scored two touchdowns in Singapore’s 35-12 win over Daegu on Monday. \nGillespie finished with 107 yards on 11 carries and was 8-for-16 for 129 yards. \nFor Humphreys, Bashr Edmonds caught two touchdown passes and finished with 202 yards on five catches. Brice Bulotovich was 9-for-23 for 221 yards. \n“Our guys played their butts off,” Blackhawks coach Aaron Mundy said. \nSingapore’s win over Daegu was thought to be the Warriors’ last game of the season. But DODDS officials announced Friday that Daegu picked up two late regular-season games. \nThe Warriors host Songdo High School of Inchon on Saturday, then on Oct. 31 welcome Matthew C. Perry, the team they beat 60-50 for the Far East Division II title last season.
