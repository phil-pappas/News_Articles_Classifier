If they were above 200, the session would be postponed for an hour, then canceled if the smog levels remained too high.\n\"We are deeply disappointed with the haze threat,\" he said.\n\"However, the health and safety of our athletes, guests, officials, volunteers, spectators and staff are our top priority.\"\nSoutheast Asia has suffered for years from annual bouts of smog caused by farmers in neighboring Indonesia burning forests to clear their land for agriculture.\n(Editing by Amlan Chakraborty )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T11:13:41.060+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
