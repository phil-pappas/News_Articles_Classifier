The Lady Wildcats went 25-0 with their closest game coming against Harrisburg at their own tournament in the first week of the season. Marion finished second in 2014 after losing to Johnston City. The Lady Wildcats beat Johnston City in the semifinals this year. \"That was motivation for them,\" said MJHS coach Joy Martin. \"They kept pushing and fighting every day to have a perfect season.\" Marion hurler Ivy Smart gave up runs in the first and seventh innings but retired 17 straight with five strikeouts in between. Highland's first hit came in the sixth inning and they added two in the seventh before a comebacker to Smart ended the game. \"Ivy has worked so incredibly hard since I've had her in sixth grade,\" Martin said. \"Not only has she grown two feet but she's added several pitches and the amount of heart she has, I'm so incredibly happy to see her succeed like this.\" Marion stranded the bases loaded in the first inning but got on the board in the third after Hannah Nalley doubled and scored on a hit by catcher Tori Evans. The Lady Wildcats left the bases loaded in that frame as well, but Nalley walked and scored on a double by Jordan Turner in the fourth inning for a 2-1 lead. Then in the fifth, Nini Liong walked and scored on a double by Jayda Smith. Smith then scored on an RBI single by Heaven Lawrence after Cathlene Green reached on an error. Marion added two runs with two outs in the seventh. Daishen Wolaver singled and Nalley reached on an error before Turner ripped a two-run double. \"They did a good job of going out there and just playing ball and having fun,\" Martin said. \"That's how they got their results.\" Marion's roster also included Addi Wall, Destiny Phelps, Hunter Barlow, Lacy Culbreth, Julia Jimenez, Jackie Drury, Karris Rhine, Bayly Kelly and Rachel Daun. Martin was assisted by Gabrielle Hallman and Shayly Wilce.
