Completing as many passes in the first half as Mauk had in a game all season, Lock looked poised throughout the game and pounced on the Gamecock defense when needed, connecting with wide receiver Nate Brown for two touchdowns. The freshman quarterback finished the game 21-28 for 136 yards and two touchdowns. \n“Drew did a lot of great things for a young player and carried himself well,” coach Gary Pinkel said. \nOffensively, the game was closely contested, with Mizzou outgaining South Carolina by just one yard. The difference was defensively, with the pass rush of the Tigers getting to true freshman quarterback Lorenzo Nunez and forcing three interceptions in the game. \n“I couldn’t be more pleased with the defensive front after losing some guys,” Pinkel said. “I think they’re responding well.” \nMissouri may have seen the coming out party for yet another tandem of pass rushers under coach Pinkel. Charles Harris was a known commodity coming in, but the man opposite him Saturday, Walter Brady, was the defensive star for the Tigers. \nBrady compiled two sacks and made a big interception for the Tigers that helped keep the game out of reach in the second half. \nThe Brady interception lead to an Ish Witter touchdown, Missouri’s first rushing touchdown on the season. Witter finished the game two yards shy of his first 100 yard rushing game, a testament not only to how well he played, but to how dominant the Tigers offensive line was. \nPinkel seemed happy after the game with the production he got from a personnel group that has struggled through the first four games of the season. \n“There were creases there where I could have run through,” Pinkel said. \nThe win moved Mizzou to 1-1 in SEC play and should give the Tigers some confidence going forward. \nWith all the positives coming from both the offense and defense, Pinkel will have some difficult decisions to make going forward. \nUndoubtedly, the most difficult and most important decision will be what to do at quarterback. Pinkel said he would speak to Mauk soon about his suspension and would not make a commitment to either quarterback after the Tigers’ victory. \nSaturday’s game was the first time Pinkel had started a true freshman quarterback in his 39 year coaching career but, with the Tigers looking reenergized, don’t be surprised if Lock finds himself starting again. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
