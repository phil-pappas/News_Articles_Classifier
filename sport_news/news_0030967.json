John Rieger / USA TODAY Sports FOX Sports Updated Oct 12, 2015 at 5:56p ET \nAlmost exactly one year ago, the score 61-58 became a part of college football lore and the most contentious rallying point for the Baylor Bears in its Big 12 fight for supremacy with the TCU Horned Frogs . \nThe Bears, however, found themselves behind TCU in the first College Football Playoff rankings even though both teams had one loss. TCU would keep its edge in the rankings, to Baylor's disgust, for the rest of the regular season until the final edition. But then it hardly mattered because both teams were excluded from the inaugural four-team playoff. \nThe score 61-58 was continually mentioned by Baylor fans as the one true measure. Last week the score appeared again, spray-painted in green across the TCU campus after the Robert Griffin III statue outside Baylor's McLane Stadium was defaced with purple spray paint. \nAnd then to start the 2015 season, TCU still kept the upper hand in the head-to-head faceoff with the Frogs securing the No. 2 ranking in the the AP top 25 poll, while Baylor started at No. 4. Both teams moved up and down through six weeks, but TCU always remained ahead until this week. \nYet another Baylor avalanche buried another team while the Frogs continued to live dangerously, narrowly escaping Kansas State. AP top 25 voters leapfrogged Baylor to No. 2, its highest ranking in school history, while TCU dropped to No. 3. \nBaylor received 13 first-place votes as No. 1 Ohio State, which has not looked overly impressive so far, continue to see its gap shrink. \nAfter Baylor's 66-7 romp at Kansas, a game in which Baylor led 52-7 at halftime and could have piled on plenty more points, Briles was asked if he needed to make a case for the Bears to be ranked No. 1. \n\"I don’t think I’ve got to throw it, I think someone else is throwing it for us,” Briles told reporters. “We just got to keep doing what we’re doing and that will all take care of itself as we know. We’ve got a huge game against West Virginia at home, and that’s where our focus started pretty early (Saturday) quite honestly.” \nWest Virginia is the team responsible for keeping the Bears behind TCU in the rankings last season. The Mountaineers were the Bears' lone blemish in 2014, a 41-27 loss at Morgantown the week after the TCU victory. \nUnless Baylor hits an unexpected hiccup, it should stay ahead of the Frogs in the polls and in the CFP playoff rankings when those debut on Nov. 3. \nBaylor doesn't play TCU until Nov. 27. It will be the Frogs' final game of the regular season, while Baylor will have one remaining game at home against Texas on Dec. 5. \nFinally, 61-58, can officially be put to rest.
