That meant Lithuanians and English supporters mixed in the same stand and that spelled trouble. \nThe skirmishes started before kick-off when the England fans who had bought tickets in the home end, clashed with their Lithuania counterparts. The supporters brawled and missiles were thrown before riot police stepped in to break up the fighting and separate the fans. \nThe Lithuanian supporters booed God Save The Queen, before the England fans started singing anti-IRA songs. \nAn uneasy truce ensued between the two groups as the match began. \nHarry Kane, his breath visible in the chilly air, was eager to make the most of a surprise start. \nThe Tottenham striker drew three impressive saves from Arlauskis within the first 22 minutes, but he then played an important part in England's opening goal. \nAfter some impressive play down the right, Kane rolled the ball to Barkley, who got the ball out from under his feet before cracking a shot into the goal off the upright. Replays showed the shot took a slight deflection off Tomas Mikuckis, but it was still a stunning strike from Barkley. \nThe Everton midfielder continued to impress, driving at the hosts' defence while Lallana probed the back line with a series of nifty passes - one of which helped put England 2-0 up. \nLallana flicked the ball into Kane's path after receiving the ball from the Spurs forward and he unleashed a low drive which hit the post and struck the goalkeeper's back before the ball rolled into the net. \nKane wasted two good chances to add a goal of his own after the break. Arlauskis palmed a close-range effort from Kane straight back at the Spurs man, but his shot was blocked by Linas Klimavicius. Arlauskis produced a top save to deny Barkley from the resulting corner. \nThe Lithuania stopper could do nothing to stop Oxlade-Chamberlain's fine strike just after the hour, however. \nThe Arsenal winger beat the offside trip and latched on to Kyle Walker's incisive pass before belting the ball into the top corner to seal the win which sent England to France on the back of a 10-match winning streak. \nTWEET OF THE MATCH \n\"The regularity of England winning football matches is becoming tedious.
