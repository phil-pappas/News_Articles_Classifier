Zahid was attacked by some miscreants in Udhampur a few days ago. Azad, a former J&K Chief Minister, said: “I stand in solidarity with the bereaved family in this hour of grief and pray to the Almighty to give them the courage to withstand this tragic loss.” Calling upon the state government to take urgent and effective steps to prevent such events in future, Azad said such painful incidents ripped apart the social fabric and created fissures which were difficult to bridge. He said such acts of mob violence widened the gulf between various sections of the society and left lasting scars of affliction and anguish. “Time has come to put an end to politics of hate and intolerance in order to bring back glory to our state — which has been the abode of peace and tolerance for centuries,” he said. Earlier, Azad visited Safdarjung Hospital to enquire about the health of both victims of Udhampur mob violence.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:14:35.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
