If you're like most of us, you didn't see East Carolina beating Virginia Tech or Utah dismantling the Oregon Ducks. Consensus picks were 2-3 for the week, down from 4-1 in each of the first three weeks of the season. \nThe good news is that the slate has been wiped clean and we have a new opportunity to play KSL College Football Pick'em. \nBYU and Utah State return home, with the Cougars facing Connecticut tonight and the Aggies hosting Colorado State on Saturday. \nOther matchups for KSL Pick'em in Week 5: No. 19 Wisconsin vs. Iowa; Navy vs. Air Force; and No. 20 Oklahoma State vs. Kansas State. \nUtah has the week off. \nTo play KSL College Football Pick'em, click HERE or download the KSL GameCenter app on iOS or Android devices. \nOne big change you will notice this week is that auto-save has been turned off. After inserting the predicted score for each game, hit the \"Save Pick\" button to submit. If successful, the box will change from red to green. \nIf you haven't signed up yet, don't worry — each weekly prize ($30 Wells Fargo VISA gift card) will be awarded to the highest point total for that week, so you have the same odds to win as those who participated in weeks 1-4. \nNow, on to the staff picks for Week 5.
