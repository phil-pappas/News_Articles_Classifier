(Photo: Peter G. Aiken-USA TODAY Sports) \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The Royals earned another champagne shower at Kauffman Stadium. \nLorenzo Cain sprinted home from first base on Eric Hosmer’s single in the eighth inning, Wade Davis weathered a 45-minute rain delay and a white-knuckle ninth, and Kansas City beat the Toronto Blue Jays 4-3 Friday night to earn its second straight trip to the World Series. \nDavis retired Blue Jays star Josh Donaldson on a grounder with runners on second and third to end Game 6 of the AL Championship Series. \nThe Royals open the World Series on Tuesday night at home against the New York Mets. \nJose Bautista’s second homer of the game, a two-run shot in the top of the eighth, lifted Toronto into a 3-3 tie. \nBut any momentum Toronto might have had was washed away when a line of rain swept through town, sending players and fans scurrying for cover. \nAfter the delay, Cain promptly worked a leadoff walk from closer Roberto Osuna, and Hosmer followed with a clean single that Bautista fielded down the right-field line. \nRather than hit the cutoff man, though, Bautista threw to second to keep Hosmer to a single. That gave the speedy Cain, running full speed the entire way and being waved home by third base coach Mike Jirschele, enough time to beat the relay throw from second base with a textbook slide that ignited a sellout crowd. \nIt was up to Davis, who got the Royals out of a jam in the eighth, to finish it off. \nDavis gave up a single to Russell Martin and walked Kevin Pillar before striking out pinch-hitter Dioner Navarro. After stolen bases put runners on second and third, Davis struck out Ben Revere, then got Donaldson on a bouncer to third. \nKansas City shortstop Alcides Escobar was voted the ALCS MVP after going 11 for 23 (.478). And for the fifth time in two years, the Royals clinched a postseason series at home. \nBen Zobrist and Mike Moustakas homered, and Alex Rios also drove in a run for Kansas City, which ended an embarrassing 29-year postseason drought just last season. \nThe Royals eventually swept their way to the World Series, where they succumbed to the San Francisco Giants in Game 7 with the tying run standing 90 feet away. \nEscobar named MVP \nAlcides Escobar caused the Toronto Blue Jays all kinds of trouble from the very first pitch. \nIn just about every game of the AL Championship Series. \nThe leadoff hitter and defensive dynamo was voted MVP of the ALCS on Friday night following a 4-3 victory in Game 6 that put Kansas City in its second straight World Series. \nEscobar set a postseason record by getting a leadoff hit in the first four games of a series — he scored in two of those games. And he wound up going 11 for 23 against the Blue Jays, joining Dustin Pedroia of the Boston Red Sox as the only hitters to have at least 10 hits and five RBIs from the leadoff spot in LCS history. \nNot bad for a career .262 hitter known primarily for his defense. \n“He’s such a talented player,” Royals manager Ned Yost said. “But with the grind of a 162-game season, there are little periods where his focus will tend to waver a little bit. But during the playoffs, he just locks in. And when he’s focused, he’s as good as any player in the league.” \nWorld Series \nThe first two games of the World Series take place Tuesday and Wednesday nights in Kansas City. The series shifts to New York next Friday and Saturday with an if necessary game set for next Sunday night. 27 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1LTvUXQ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:17:30.315+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
