Doesn't happen very often. I didn't work on it,\" he said of the wonder-shot he played during practice in Belgrade. \"It's just instinctively I turned around and managed to play what I played. It was funny.\" \n\nYouTube footage of the shot has had nearly 600,000 views, but Djokovic said it would be \"disrespectful\" to an opponent to attempt something similar in a match. \"I don't know if I'm able to repeat that. I don't think so in a match. It's all about risk management, and I think it's too high of a risk to play that shot,\" he said. \n\n\"I think in a match it's different because you also have respect for the opponent and the game, so you can't really start doing different kind of things because it's a bit disrespectful towards your opponent.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:16:18.572+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
