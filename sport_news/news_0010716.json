And right now, the timing of Northgate's volleyball team couldn't be more perfect. \nCapping off three victories against state-ranked opponents on a busy final day of the Area 4- tournament at McIntosh, the Lady Vikings stunned the host Lady Chiefs in a three sets to one victory to capture this year's region championship. \nThe victory over McIntosh, the No. 6-ranked team in Class , gives Northgate a well-earned No. 1 seed in the state tournament beginning Thursday at home against the No. 4 finisher out of Area 6- . \nIt also gives the Lady Vikings (26-17) a huge shot of confidence after finishing 11-2 within one of the toughest areas in the state. \nJunior Katie Stanton finished four matches with 34 kills and 8 aces in a balanced effort from a veteran lineup led by senior captains Savannah Moore (30 kills, 27 blocks) and Taylor Richard (32 kills, 28 digs) in impressive efforts. \nSenior libero Cara Rhoad posted 30 digs and junior Kia Thomas posted double digits in both kills (25) and blocks (11). Setters Morgan Marshall and Delaney Surapine closed Saturday with 59 and 51 assists, respectively while showcasing the Lady Vikings' depth at the position. \nAlong with Moore and Thomas, junior Hannah Smith was strong up front with seven blocks. \nNeeding a win to reach the finals, Northgate bounced back from a twogame sweep by host McIntosh in the winner's bracket semifinal to defeat Ola (39-8) - the No. 7 ranked team in - for the second time on Saturday. \nThe Lady Indians opened the final day of the tournament by rallying past the Lady Mustangs 22-25, 25-23, 27-25 in a thriller to get a first crack at McIntosh. \nWith Ola looking to avenge its loss to Northgate, the Lady Vikings again stood tall in a three-set victory, winning 25-13, 23-25, 25-22 to reach the area championship.
