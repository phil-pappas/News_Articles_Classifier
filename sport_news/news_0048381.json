That means rookie Kevin Johnson and AJ Bouye, a former UCF standout, will likely have their roles elevated.

That performance, which happened to be Tannehill’s first regular season start, was the worst statistical game of Tannehill’s career (39 passer rating). It will be interesting to see the growth Tannehill has made 52 starts later, but the Dolphins offensive line can’t let Watt wreck the game plan. \nThe last time the Dolphins played Houston Watt consistently got into Tannehill’s passing lanes, and made plays in Miami’s backfield that produced turnovers back in that 2012 Dolphins loss.
