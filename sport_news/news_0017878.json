I’m really proud.”\nThe team received a standing ovation even after dropping a 4-1 decision to the Boston Pride.\nThe NWHL is the first professional women’s hockey league to pay its players.\n“Sure they’re getting paid and it’s history but they’re doing it for one reason and that’s passion for the game,” Beauts coach Shelley Looney said. “We’re starting to get a feel. They haven’t really played with each other and it’s just going to take some time. Every week we’re just going to get a little bit better and we’ve got a lot of speed on this team and I think we’re going to surprise a lot of people.\nFirst goal: Kelley Steadman notched the first goal in Buffalo Beauts history with a power play tally with 9:04 left in the game. Meghan Duggan and Emily Pfalzer picked up the assists.\nSteadman played her college hockey at Mercyhurst and was part of the 2009 team that went to the national championship game.\n“It was a pretty nice pass from Meghan Duggan out of the corner,” Steadman said. “It was pretty much a wide open net. Saw the goalie move over and knew that I couldn’t miss. It was a great pass from Meghan and I was lucky to put it in. ... The fans were amazing. We knew we wanted to get them a goal and give them something to cheer about.”\nSo, about Hilary Knight: The forward is considered the best player in women’s hockey and she showed off her speed and skill early for Boston. She scored the first goal at 12:08 of the first period and added a second tally at 15:36 of the second.\nThree-goal lead: Jordan Smelker, who played her college hockey at RPI, scored with 11:03 left in the second.\nMake that four: Amanda Pelkey had an impressive move on a break to extend Boston’s lead to 4-0 at 8:13 of the third.\nDominating the shots: Boston dominated the pace of play and hence the shots on goal. They finished with a 41-23 advantage.\nIn the net: While she gave up four goals, Brianne McLaughlin made 37 saves from all angles to keep the Beauts in the game.\nCeremonial puck drop: Manon Rhéaume, the goaltender who is the only woman to play in an NHL game, dropped the ceremonial first puck as girls from area youth hockey leagues filled in the Beauts bench for the pregame ceremony.\nFan support: There was no official attendance given. Around 1,200 tickets were sold and a solid walkup had the 1,800-seat HarborCenter near capacity.\nA large contingent of fans wearing RIT jerseys set up shop in the corner with three former Tiger players on the Beauts roster – forwards Erin Zach and Kourtney Kuniichika and defenseman Lindsay Grigg.\nAlso spotted were Mercyhurst jerseys with Laker alums Shelby Bram (forward) and Amanda Makela (goaltender) with the Beauts.\nNext up: The Beauts host the Connecticut Whale at 3:30 p.m. Sunday.\nemail: amoritz@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T10:39:58.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
