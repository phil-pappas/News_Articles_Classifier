(Richard Hamm/Staff) OnlineAthens / Athens Banner-Herald UGA's Malcolm Mitchell admires what Batman stands for By Fletcher Page published Wednesday, October 21, 2015 close \nMalcolm Mitchell got Batman tattooed on his left forearm about two years ago. \nPretty serious commitment. Pretty strong sentiment. \n“I love what he stands for,” the fifth-year senior Georgia wideout said. “A guy who doesn’t have to be seen, acknowledged or recognized for the things that he does. He just does it because he feels like it’s the right thing to do.” \nMitchell flashed his patented grin when Batman was brought up during an interview with the media Wednesday. \nHe loves the Christian Bale take on the character. Hasn’t seen the Clooney, Kilmer or Keaton versions. Through his explanation of the ink, it felt as if he was talking about himself as much as Batman. \n“I might get a Batman costume this Halloween,” he said. “If I ever got the right amount of money I would buy the exact costume in that last movie ‘The Dark Knight Rises,’ and I would wear it all day. I’d wear it out.” \nMitchell made the plays that helped Georgia win Saturday against Missouri. His performance on a fourth quarter punt — his first time covering a punt this season — led to a Missouri fumble and the Bulldogs tying the game at 6. \nMissouri coach Gary Pinkel appealed to Southeastern Conference officials that Mitchell interfered on the play. \nMitchell doesn’t care if he did or didn’t. \n“We got the ball that play, right? I don’t care what they say then,” he said. “It’s too late now, huh. I can’t get those pass interference (calls against Missouri) back.” \nA pass interference call late in the game on a throw intended to Mitchell helped position the Bulldogs for the game-winning field goal. \nAgain, Pinkel appealed to the SEC, saying the ball was un-catchable. \nAgain, Mitchell doesn’t care. \n“I’m not saying he’s wrong,” Mitchell said. “I’m not saying he’s right. The game’s over.” \nThe Bulldogs have a weekend off — Mitchell said he has no plans — before traveling to Jacksonville next week for the game against Florida that will probably decide the SEC Eastern Division. \nMitchell has gotten credit for getting the Bulldogs to this point, still in position to achieve their goal of reaching the SEC Championship game. \nThose plays in the Missouri game and leading the team with 35 catches, 505 receiving yards and four touchdowns are the high marks. And he’s made plays in this rivalry before, notably the game-clinching touchdown catch in 2012. \nLike Batman, Mitchell deferred the spotlight. \n“I don’t think about it much,” he said of that play. “I’ve got more games to play. If I flashed back on that play or reminisced on it I think it would do more harm than anything else. So I’ll focus on making more plays.” \nOnlineAthens.com aims to foster constructive, respectful civic conversation.
