Maines Veterans Memorial Arena. \nB-Sens coach Luke Richardson has yet to announce captains for the contest, but he has named a starting goaltender. Chris Driedger, who was a third-round pick in 2012 by Ottawa and is starting his second professional season, will get the nod with Scott Greenham serving as backup. Driedger started the past season playing for Evansville of the ECHL and completed the rare feat of also appearing in the AHL and National Hockey League in his first pro season. \nDriedger finished with a 6-0-0 record in eight games with the B-Sens last season, compiling a 2.55 goals-against average and .923 save percentage. The 21-year-old from Winnipeg also had an 8-27-4 record with a 3.78 GAA and .885 save percentage in 40 games with Evansville last season. He did not allow a goal in 23 minutes of NHL action last season while appearing in one game. \nSlight standings change \nThere is a decidedly new look to the AHL for its 80th season. \nFive Western Conference NHL teams have moved their affiliates to California, giving the AHL its first-ever presence in the Golden State. The Bakersfield Condors (top affiliate of the Edmonton Oilers), Ontario Reign (Los Angeles Kings), San Diego Gulls (Anaheim Ducks), San Jose Barracuda (San Jose Sharks) and Stockton Heat (Calgary Flames) are all members of the Pacific Division this fall. \nThe AHL is also returning to Winnipeg in 2015-16 with the return of the Manitoba Moose as the top affiliate of the NHL’s Jets. The Moose spent 10 seasons in the AHL from 2001 to 2011. \nOther affiliation shuffles heading into the new season have resulted in new parent clubs for the St. John’s IceCaps (Montreal Canadiens), Lake Erie Monsters (Columbus Blue Jackets), Springfield Falcons (Arizona Coyotes), San Antonio Rampage (Colorado Avalanche) and Portland Pirates (Florida Panthers). \nThe league’s alignment underwent a change as well, with the league splitting into four divisions – the Atlantic and the North in the Eastern Conference and the Central and the Pacific in the Western Conference. Teams will play a 76-game schedule with the exception of the five California-based teams, who will play 68 games apiece. \nStandings order will now be determined by points percentage, not total points. \nNew rules \nThe 2015-16 season will feature some new rules, most notably a five-minute overtime period during the regular season played at three skaters aside for the duration. \nLast season, playing a combination of 4-on-4 and 3-on-3 during a seven-minute overtime, the AHL saw 201 of its 268 OT games (75.0 percent) decided in the extra session – a dramatic increase from 2013-14, when 35.3 percent of OT games were decided during the 4-on-4 period used that season. \nTwo other rules to watch for: Rule 79.4: “Video Review – Coaches Challenge” permits a team – if it has its timeout available – to request a video review of any situation that would normally be subject to official review under Rule 79.3. If the challenge is successful, the team retains its timeout. Rule 76.4: “Face-Offs” calls for the defending player to place his stick on the ice first for all face-offs except those at center ice, where the visiting player will place his stick on the ice first. \nHOCKEY NIGHT \nWHO: Albany Devils at Binghamton Senators \nWHEN: 7:10 p.m./Saturday \nWHERE: Floyd L.
