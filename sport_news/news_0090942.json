But amid the furor directed at the program, Utah enters its weekend matchup against the USC Trojans as the underdog. \nOn Sunday, the multitude of Las Vegas sportsbooks opened up the betting line favoring USC by three points — a rare occurrence for an unranked 3-3 program against the No. 3 team in the country. But several statistical predictions agree with the sportsbooks and give Utah a slim chance of beating the Trojans. \nESPN's Football Power Index , a model based on the game's projected point margin against average opponents, gives Utah only a 28.2 percent chance of beating the Trojans. Bill Connelly, an originator of Football Outsiders' FEI and S&P Rating, has Utah the underdog with a slightly better 37 percent chance. \nBut why would a team with a .500 record be favored over an undefeated team? Utah head coach Kyle Whittingham only has one guess, and that's USC's overall talent. \n\"Well, they've got talent,\" he said. 'I say it every year, and every coach in the conference would agree, that they've got a bunch of talent with their players. That would be my guess.\" \nThat still doesn't answer the question, but maybe we're getting at something. It's one thing to have talent and another to do well with said talent. Just because the Trojans have a team loaded with four- and five-star recruits doesn't mean raw talent translates to winning. And in USC's case, winning has only come in half of the games. \nAnalytics writer for ESPN.com Sharon Katz attempted to answer the question , saying a lot of the statistical models base their numbers on a team's scoring margin. \n\"Scoring margin is generally a better predictor of future performance than a team's win-loss record itself, and USC and Utah have the exact same scoring margin (plus-17 points per game) through six games,\" Katz writes. \"The Trojans may be playing with an interim head coach, but they have arguably more talent, particularly on offense, than any team in the Pac-12.\" Related: They're not your typical stars on the football field in the sense of drawing attention. They're generally the biggest athletes on the team and get the least amount of love in the public's eye. \n\nSo talent it is. \n\"USC obviously does not have as impressive a resume as Utah's, but this weekend, the FPI and Vegas expect them to be stronger at home,\" Katz continues. \nNo matter the reason, Utah players aren't concerned by the disrespect. It's just another form of motivation for Utah as it seeks to keep its undefeated streak intact. In fact, Utah is 5-1 in Week 7 games after starting the season 6-0. \n\"Every time we're the underdog it motivates us every week,\" running back Devontae Booker said. \"We really don't care where we'll be, whether the underdog or even if we are picked to win; it doesn't bother us at all. We've just got to continue to go out there and play hard and win games.\" \n\"I've never really paid too much attention to that,\" defensive end Hunter Dimick said. \"I think that's kind of distracting. I think against Oregon they were favored by 11.5 points, or something like that. I wouldn't say it's exactly insulting, but we hear about it and we're going to ignore it and keep working and practicing just like we always have and do what we're doing.\" \nOther players like center Siaosi Aiono are happy that somewhere in all of college football, someone isn't buying into the hype around Utah. \n\"I'm glad there's somebody out there that's not hyping us up like everybody else,\" Aiono said. \"No. 3, that's good for us, but to have that (3-point underdog), it helps us be grounded and stay grinding until we earn all that respect.\" \nEarn your stripes instead of resting on your laurels seems like good advice for a team with an undefeated record and a high national ranking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:31:18.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
