Major League Baseball officials must then decide whether the second baseman can still play Monday night in Game 3 of the National League Division Series Monday night at Citi Field.\n“After thoroughly reviewing the play from all conceivable angles, I have concluded that Mr. Utley’s action warrants discipline,” Torre said in a statement. “While I sincerely believe that Mr. Utley had no intention of injuring Ruben Tejada, and was attempting to help his club in a critical situation, I believe his slide was in violation of [an official baseball rule] which is designed to protect from precisely this type of rolling block that occurs away from the base.”\nMet fans said it was too little too late.\n“Utley’s suspension is bulls–t p r intended to prevent beanballs in Game 3,” fan Jason Fry tweeted. “If what he did was illegal then call a DP[double play] and replay Game 2 from top of 8th. And if not, don’t suspend Utley.”\nThe suspension had Utley’s agent, Joel Wolfe, crying foul. A two-game suspension for “a legal baseball play is outrageous,” he said in a statement. “Chase did what all ball players are taught to do in this situation — break up — the double play.”\n“We routinely see plays at second base similar to this one that have not resulted in suspensions,” Wolfe added. “We will be appealing this suspension immediately.”\nThe Mets had been thirsty for revenge for the Tejada takeout slide. Hurler Matt Harvey was seething as he prepared for his Game 3 start.\n“As far as sticking up for your teammates, I think being out there and doing what’s right is exactly what I’m going to do,” said Harvey, who beaned Utley during a game in April over another incident. “I think the most important thing is going out and doing my job and doing what’s best for the team.”\nUtley’s history of hard, late slides is well known to the Mets, who grew familiar with the veteran infielder’s style of play during his years with the Phillies — including a 2010 incident in which Met David Wright called out Utley for a late slide into Tejada.\n\n“I think history has kind of shown that he’s kind of been in situations like that before,” Harvey said.\n“I know personally, you know, after watching in 2010 and hearing about it with Ruben as well, you know, there’s some situations that need to be taken care of. I think the league is going to do their best to do that and take charge.\n“As far as where we were, it was kind of hard to see at first, you know, where exactly the slide started. But after obviously the replay, everybody saw that it was more of a tackle than anything. We’re all feeling for Ruben.”\nEven Mets manager Terry Collins said he expected his players to settle the score themselves.\n“All I know is, for years and years and years, as long as this game is played, and we know there are a lot of changes, players always took care of stuff themselves,’’ he said.\nAs fans from Manhattan to Los Angeles railed over Utley’s bone-breaking “slide,’’ the under-fire second baseman doubled down on his claims that he “in no way, shape or form” was trying to hurt Tejada.\nHe said he reached out to Mets third baseman and captain Wright to make sure Tejada got word that he was sorry he got hurt, but not for taking him out .\nDavid Wright (right) exchanges words with Chase Utley (left) during a foul ball Saturday.

Wolfe, Utley’s agent, told The Post that the only reason his client didn’t personally reach out to Tejada was because he didn’t have his phone number.\n“Chase feels terrible about injuring another player,” Wolfe said. “Chase is a middle infielder, also. So this hits even more close to home for him.”\nBut he added, “Chase doesn’t feel it was a dirty play, it just happened.”\nUtley didn’t get off any of the three buses carrying his team from the airport to the New York Palace in Midtown on Sunday night.\nAlso missing from the group were several teammates including Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke and manager Don Mattingly.\nThe NYPD is currently doing a “threat assessment’’ on what’s being said on the Internet about Utley — much of it ugly, some threatening — but has not been aware of any credible threats against him, law-enforcement sources told The Post.\nThe number of officers at Citi Field were not expected to increase, but they were planning to move more cops to the field and near the Dodgers dugout.\nThe hotel also was contacted by the local precinct just to touch base, but there’s no reason to put any extra cops there right now, a source said, adding that this could change if there’s a big crowd of protesters.\n— Additional reporting by Mike Puma, Dan Martin, Larry Celona and CJ Sullivan \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under chase utley ,  los angeles dodgers ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  ruben tejada", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T16:04:35.665+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
