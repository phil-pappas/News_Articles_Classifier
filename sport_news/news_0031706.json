It was met with subdued applause afterward. However, the past week has seen its fair share of headline-making news that has involved the church in one way or another.\nOn the eve of Francis' big and contentious meeting on family issues, a Vatican monsignor came out as gay and, with his boyfriend by his side, denounced homophobia in the Catholic Church. He was summarily fired from his job in the Vatican's doctrine office.\nA few days later, Rome's mayor resigned amid scandal of his own doing. But Mayor Ignazio Marino's downfall followed widespread criticism within the church that the city was ill-prepared to handle the millions of pilgrims expected for Francis' Jubilee Year of Mercy, which starts in December.\nAnd finally, Francis' synod has been rocked by revelations that a dozen conservative cardinals wrote to the pope with serious concerns about the way the meeting was being run.\n\"Before I begin the catechesis I would like in the name of the church to ask your forgiveness for the scandals which have recently fallen on Rome and the Vatican,\" Francis said to thousands of people gathered under damp but warm skies in St. Peter's Square. \"I ask your forgiveness.\"\n\"Jesus is a realist and he says that it is inevitable that scandal happens, but woe to the man who causes such scandals,\" he said.\nThe Vatican spokesman did not immediately respond to an email seeking clarification of what Francis meant.\nDuring the audience, the also pope greeted some of the 33 Chilean miners who survived 69 days underground in 2010 after their mine shaft caved in.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:40:28.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
