(Photo: Kimm Anderson, kanderson@stcloudtimes.com) Buy Photo \nA couple weeks ago, Cullen Chisholm was told something no athlete ever wants to hear. \n\"I was told I was never playing soccer again,\" Chisholm said. \nThat didn't prove to be quite true. \nChisholm scored on penalty kick 7:22 into Thursday's Section 8A final, just a minute or two after entering a game for the first time since Oct. 6. \nIt helped give Sartell a 2-1 victory over St. Cloud Apollo at St. Cloud State's Husky Stadium. \n\"I couldn't be happier,\" said Chisholm, who has a nearly completely torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder. \n\"It's torn from 10 o'clock to 7 o'clock,\" said the senior attacker, noting those three unmentioned hours are what are keeping him from a total tear. \"I'm going to need surgery eventually.\" \nHe hurt it twice this season, the last time against Willmar. He hasn't played since, though he was cleared to play in a shootout situation Saturday. On Thursday, he got the OK from his doctor to play and wore a brace that hindered his shoulder movement. \n\"It's incredible,\" Chisholm said of qualifying for state. \"Most people don't get to play in one state tournament and I'm blessed to play in two.\" Buy Photo Sartell's Trevor Erickson (24) and Ethan Kiffmeyer (16) celebrate their 2-1 win in their Sect. 8A championship game against St. Cloud ApolloThursday, Oct. 22 at Husky Stadium.
