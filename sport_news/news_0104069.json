That situation went haywire.\" \nOn the final play of the game, O'Neill dropped the punt snap and the ball squirted into the air as defenders blitzed him. MSU's Jalen Watts-Jackson scooped up the loose ball and scored the winning touchdown. \nThe highlights and criticism followed O'Neill all week. And when you add the social media component, it's enough to make someone go into hiding. \n\"As punters and kickers, it's such a head game that we have to forget about the mistakes,\" Melchiori said. \"You can't dwell on it. You have to move on and get ready for the next punt or kick.\" \nMelchiori speaks from experience. He reached the highlight reel earlier this season in a game against Minnesota. His punt went straight up in the air and bounced back toward the original line of scrimmage. It was recorded as a 2-yard punt. \n\"I'm sure it was on [ESPN's] 'Not top Ten' that night,\" Melchiori said. \"That ball hit the ground and took the most unlucky back spin. Obviously, I didn't hit the ball well. It happens.\" \nMelchiroi has made things happen enough during his career at Kent State that he's a candidate for the Ray Guy Award for the fourth straight year. He earned Mid-American Conference first team honors last season after leading the MAC with a 44.3-yard average. \nThis year, Melchiroi leads the country in punting yards (2,391). His 41.2 average is 76th in the country, well below his goal. \n\"My average eats at me,\" Melchiroi said. \"It's not my best. We have five weeks to go in the season, and that leaves me more room for improvement.\" \nMelchiori is one of many Northeast Ohio natives to watch in Division I college football this week. Kent State will host Bowling Green at 1 p.m. Saturday on ESPN3. \nEach Friday, The Plain Dealer will identify some players from this area to watch, then report on Mondays on notable performances.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T21:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:26:26.374+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
