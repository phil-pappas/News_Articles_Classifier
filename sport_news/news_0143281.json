That was as far as he would go, his words exemplifying the willing and necessary mental disconnect that an NFL player must maintain just to suit up each Sunday. Murray was one of three U.S. high school football players to have died in September from injuries related to the sport. \nJust last month, researchers from Boston University and the Department of Veterans Affairs, having examined 165 men who played football in high school, college, and/or at a professional level, found that the disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy appeared in the brain tissue of 131 of them - a remarkable and terrifying 79 percent. The questions are unavoidable now. When should someone start to play football? When should someone stop? Who gets to make that choice, and who has to have that choice made for him? \n\"You try to take care of your body,\" Austin said, \"but also, I go into this practice, this season, this game, this thing that we do that's my job, and I know those risks, those inherent risks that are constantly going to be there. I know the potential for anything down the road - head, body, knees, hips, shoulders, who knows. I'm not going to say I pop out of bed fresh every single day, but it's one of those things where I know the risks.\" \nSo why is football worth those risks? \n\"Football's the ultimate team sport,\" he said. \"You have all different types of guys from all different types of backgrounds. The social aspect is all over the place - different personalities who have to come together for a common goal. There are so many different aspects. You could just look at it and say, 'These guys are running into each other.' But it's way deeper. . . . \n\"It's not a gladiator-slave type deal. You don't have to play. If you want to do something different, you can do something different. Personally, I know the risk that goes into it, but I love the game.\" \nAustin has a 9-month-old son, Miles IV. What if the boy comes to love the game, too? Will Austin allow him to play? \n\"Honestly, I want to get that golf club in his hand as fast as I can,\" he said. \"Whatever he wants to play, he's got to make his own decisions. My dad never led me in any specific direction. As long as you're active and a good kid, go ahead and do it. But if I could have him do anything, it'd be driving and hitting those putts.\" \nThat same crossroad is ahead for any parent of a young boy who shows an interest in football - that weighing of risk, that uncertainty over what the sport is and what it can do. Just before noon Thursday, Miles Austin walked onto the fields at the NovaCare Complex and yanked his helmet down on his head, ready to warm up before practice. Seventy-six miles to the north in Washington, N.J., Warren Hills Regional High School was closed for the day, and at Faith Discovery Church, they were an hour into Evan Murray's funeral.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:07:19.481+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
