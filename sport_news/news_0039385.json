I have therefore decided to change teams,\" Kittel wrote on his personal website on Saturday.\nEtixx-QuickStep CEO Patrick Lefevere said the Belgian outfit were delighted to have Kittel for the 2016 and 2017 seasons, adding: \"In the last years he showed incredible pure speed, which makes him one of the best sprinters in the history of the sport.\n\"We are sure that, together, we can achieve more big goals, and that we have yet to see the best of Marcel Kittel.\"\nLast month, British sprint star Mark Cavendish ended a three-year stint with Etixx-QuickStep after signing with South African team Dimension Data.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:48:25.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
