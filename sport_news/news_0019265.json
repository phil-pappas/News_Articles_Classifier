That’s an average of 44 points and 497 yards in each of the Ducks’ 11 consecutive victories over Washington. \nFor Husky fans of a certain generation, the idea that UW could lose 11 in a row to the Ducks still boggles the mind. But those are the numbers, and that is the reality, as the two rivals get set for Saturday night’s showdown at Husky Stadium. \nThe Huskies (3-2, 1-1), coming off a 17-12 upset of then-No. 17 USC and with two extra days to prepare for the Ducks, is a three-point betting favorite. They haven’t been favored over Oregon since 2003 .\n“Hopefully we can make it a rivalry,” said Jimmy Lake, UW’s defensive backs coach. “Because it hasn’t been for the last decade.”\nMost Read Stories Seahawks’ Derrick Coleman arrested for investigation of hit, run 7 Juanita football players told police of hazing, attacks Boom times in Bothell as McMenamins hotel, entertainment complex opens Zomato shuts Seattle office, lays off employees across U.S. 12 reasons why living in Washington is better than living in Oregon Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. To anyone who asked this week, UW coach Chris Petersen has insisted the Ducks (3-3, 1-2 Pac-12) are as “scary” as ever, even as they come to town as a .500 team.\n“To me, it’s the same ol’ Oregon team,” Petersen said. \nFor the 10th year in a row, Oregon leads the Pac-12 Conference in rushing, gaining 319 yards per game this season. That’s largely on the legs of Royce Freeman, a 230-pound sophomore who ran for a career-high 246 yards in the Ducks’ loss to Washington State last week .\nLast year, Freeman rushed for 169 yards and four touchdowns in a 45-20 victory over UW . Stopping him, or trying to, will be the Huskies’ No. 1 priority. \n“Royce is the best running back in the country, in my opinion,” Lake said. “I think he’s going to be a top-10 pick. I think he has unbelievable size, elusiveness, speed; he has great vision. I think he runs hard. This guy is like a once-in-a-decade-type running back. …\n“It’s going to be all hands on deck; we need all 11 Dawgs huntin’ and trying to get this guy down on the ground.”\nWhen Oregon has the ball, it’ll be strength vs. strength. The Huskies finally appear equipped to handle the Ducks’ fast-paced offense. UW held USC to one touchdown last week and enters the weekend as the Pac-12’s top-ranked defense.\n“Coming off the win, guys got a lot of confidence and a lot of belief in each other,” said UW senior linebacker Travis Feeney, the Pac-12 player of the week .\nWhen UW has the ball, it’ll be weakness vs. weakness. The Huskies are ninth in the conference in scoring (30.2 points), and Oregon ranks 116th in the nation in scoring defense (38.7).\nThe Ducks, who blew a 10-point fourth-quarter lead to WSU before losing in double-overtime, have not lost consecutive games since 2007.\n“Those guys aren’t down. Those guys are going to fight. … We know they’re going to come out and fight,” Feeney said.\nTwo key questions linger going into Saturday: Will Oregon have available quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. (broken finger), the fifth-year graduate transfer from Eastern Washington? And how will the Huskies handle not having starting middle linebacker Azeem Victor, suspended for the first half Saturday after a fourth-quarter targeting ejection against USC ?\nThere’s no question, however, about what a victory would do for the Huskies’ rebuilding plans and for their bowl hopes — not to mention what it would do for the psyche of scores of Husky fans, young and old.\n“Time and place, right now, shoot, to beat those guys and where it’s at and where we want the direction of this program to go, it would be great,” UW offensive coordinator Jonathan Smith said.\nSmith, a former Oregon State quarterback, has long been an Oregon rival. He helped the Beavers to two wins over Ducks in 1998 and 2000, and is now looking for his first with UW. \n“Any time you beat the Ducks,” Smith said, “there’s nothing better. So we’ll be ready on Saturday.”\nAdam Jude: 206-464-2364 or ajude@seattletimes.com .
