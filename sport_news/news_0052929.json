On a rainy day along the Brazos River, the Bears (7-0, 4-0 Big 12) were held under 60 points for the first time in six games. The only other NCAA team with five consecutive 60-point games was Oklahoma in 2008. Corey Coleman had two more touchdown catches, his sixth consecutive game with multiple scores pushing his FBS-leading total to 18. He also surpassed Kendall Wright's school record for career touchdowns with his 31st. Coleman had a 36-yard score on Baylor's opening drive, then had a downfield block that helped quarterback Seth Russell break free on a 37-yard TD run for a quick 14-0 lead. Coleman caught a 12-yarder from Jarrett Stidham in the closing minutes. Baylor coach Art Briles said after the game that Russell, whose last play was a 4-yard run on third-and-5 with 5:36 left, left the game because of a strained neck. The extent of the injury wasn't clear. \"He's a tough guy. It's hard to see tough guys hurt,\" Briles said. Iowa State (2-5, 1-3), which has lost its last 14 games against ranked teams, trailed 35-0 before Joshua Thomas ' 3-yard TD run with just under 5 minutes left in the first half. Mike Warren , another freshman running back for the Cyclones, had his fourth 100-yard rushing game, with 145 yards on 28 carries. Along with their 485 total yards, and held under 56 points for the first time this season, the Bears were well below their national-leading averages of 64 points and 720 yards per game. When Russell threw a 6-yard TD pass to Linwood to make it 28-0 early in the second quarter, Baylor's junior quarterback had 29 passing touchdowns and six rushing TDs. That is exactly what Bryce Petty had in his 12 games last season for the Bears before being drafted by the New York Jets . With an open date next weekend, Baylor played its last game before the initial College Football Playoff rankings of the season come out Nov. 3. The Bears next play Nov. 5 at Kansas State, a Thursday night that is two days after the first CFP weekly rankings are released. The two-time defending Big 12 champions were the first team left out of the first four-team playoff last season. Baylor hasn't lost a home game in more than three years, since a 49-21 loss to TCU on Oct. 12, 2012. Their home streak includes all 10 games since moving into their campus stadium last season along the Brazos River, which was swollen Saturday after nearly 14 inches of rain in the area over a two-day period. Even with all the rain that forced officials to prohibit sailgating (Baylor's version of tailgating on boats), the well-draining artificial turf was in good shape for the game. But after going up 35-0 on Devin Chafin's 2-yard run with 8:14 left in the second quarter, the Bears' went nearly 35 minutes — the equivalent of more than a full half — without scoring. Chris Callahan 's 34-yard field goal with 5:31 ended that unusual drought for the Bears' usual point-a-minute offense ___ AP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T00:16:19.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
