The 89-year-old resident of Oakland will be among the alumni who gather for Pacific’s homecoming festivities that run today through Sunday. The public events include the Tiger Tailgate and Food Truck Frenzy from 6-8 p.m. today in the Chris Kjeldsen Pool parking lot, followed by a Tiger Rally from 8-11 p.m. in Spanos Center. The Homecoming Parade, complete with floats, is at 1 p.m. Saturday down Pacific Avenue from Elm to Castle streets. Pacific Avenue will be closed to traffic from Harding Way to Regent Street from 11:45 a.m. to 3 p.m., according to Stockton police spokesman Officer Joe Silva. Access to Pacific between Harding and Regent also will be closed during that time. Also, retired Professor Larry Meredith will deliver his “last lecture,” Professoring at Pacific: The Whole Truth About Half a Century, beginning at 7 p.m. Saturday in the Biology Building. The rest of the weekend is devoted to reuniting and reminiscing. Lichtenstein, a broadcast major whose first job was at Stockton’s KWG, followed by stints at San Francisco’s KRON and KTVU television stations and KFOG radio, has retained close ties to fellow members of the class of 1949 and others who were in school with him. “Pacific had about 2,000 students, and about half of them were going to Stockton Junior College on the (south side of the) campus,” Lichtenstein said. “They had a strange relationship. Some students were taking classes only from Pacific, some only from Stockton College and some in both facilities. “The big thing in ’49 was our football team, undefeated, untied and uninvited to any bowl game. None of the schools wanted to play us.” Eddie LeBaron was the quarterback of that team and a broadcast major who was a friend of Lichtenstein’s. LeBaron died on April 1. “He was such a wonderful individual,” Lichtenstein said. “We’ll probably have a prayer or two for him.” Both Lichtenstein and LeBaron were members of the Murphys Ale and Quail club, a group formed by students in the 1940s. They’d get to Murphys to ski over spring break and according to Lichtenstein, “start drinking on Friday afternoon and keep drinking until Sunday afternoon.” Now, when the group gathers in Murphys, “we have warm milk at 10 o’clock and go to bed,” he said. The college spirit hasn’t left them, though, and Lichtenstein promises he and fellow Murphys Ale and Quail member Virginia Thompson, whose late husband, Boyd Thompson, was instrumental in the club’s founding and longevity, will lead a Pacific cheer at Sunday’s half-century gathering. “I used to jump and do somersaults,” said Lichtenstein, a high school yell leader in San Francisco who was never an official yell leader at Pacific but split his game day chores of helping with the radio broadcasts and leading cheers. “I barely get (on) my feet. I’m 89, and yell leaders aren’t 89. But I will do my damnedest to get them to yell.” He said Pacific students no longer spell out Pacific the way he and his cronies did. “I asked them what they yell at basketball games and they said, ‘Defense, Defense,’” he said. More has changed than cheers and student enthusiasm for Pacific athletics. Lichtenstein, who like many students of his generation had returned to school after serving in World War II, remembers everyone leaving the residence halls and making their way to Baxter Stadium for football games. Now, there are more residences, more classrooms, more majors, more students. He only hopes they are creating as many fond memories as he still has. “It was a great time for me and my fellow grads,” Lichtenstein said. “I’ve always kept my allegiance to Pacific.” — Contact reporter Lori Gilbert at (209) 546-8284 or lgilbert@recordnet.com.
