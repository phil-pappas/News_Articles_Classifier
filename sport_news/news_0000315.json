Coleman already has more touchdown catches this season (13) than half of the 10 teams in the Big 12, and more than twice as many as Kansas State, Kansas and Texas. \nColeman can tie and potentially pass Wright when Baylor (5-0, 2-0 Big 12) welcomes West Virginia (3-2, 0-2 Big 12) to McLane Stadium, where the Bears have an 18-game winning streak, the longest active streak in the nation. \n\"Kendall is one of the guys I look up to,” Coleman told the Waco Tribune-Herald . “He’s a great football player who is in the NFL, so this is exciting.” \nColeman likely would have already eclipsed Wright's mark if Baylor's starters had played in the second half of last week's 66-7 win at Kansas, or maybe even earlier had the Bears' starters been needed in more than one fourth quarter this season. \n\"I’m one of those guys who wants to always be in the game,” Coleman said. “I got to beg Coach (Art) Briles to let me play in the second half. But it was great to see the young guys get some experience.” MORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
