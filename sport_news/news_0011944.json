The NFL hit Cam Heyward with a $5,787 fine for displaying the personal message.\nHeyward said he’ll continue to pay the fine, adding he doesn’t \"want to ruffle any feathers, but this is bigger than all we play for. There are people fighting for [their] lives.\"\nAfter his dominance at Passaic during the early ’80s, Craig Heyward went on to a standout career at Pitt and with four NFL teams during an 11 year career.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:37:07.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
