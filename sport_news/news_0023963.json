A lawsuit brought by former team employee Anucha Browne Sanders alleging that she was sexually harassed by Thomas cost MSG $11.6 million. \nIn his first interview about rehiring Thomas, Dolan tells HBO’s “Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel” in a segment scheduled to air Tuesday night that “I think I’ve always understood him.” \n“I don’t know if I can explain it other than that there’s something inside of both of us that’s really quite similar: the tenacity, the stubbornness,” Dolan adds. “Isiah’s a guy who doesn’t believe in his limitations, and I’m a guy who doesn’t believe in his limitations.” \nThe Knicks didn’t win a single playoff game during Thomas’ stint as team president from December 2003 to April 2008 despite regularly owning the NBA’s highest payroll. Thomas also went 56-108 in two seasons as their coach before being fired. \nOf picking Thomas to run the Liberty, Dolan says: “I didn’t think I would get a better person to do that job than him. He would draw attention to the team.” \nThe Liberty had the best regular-season record in the WNBA this past season, setting a team record for wins, before falling in the Eastern Conference finals. \nDolan, whose father founded HBO, adds that “I think we’re going to be friends for a long time.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:27:59.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
