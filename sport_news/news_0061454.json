And all of a sudden, the 1920s and the 21st century didn’t seem so different. \nAfter all, we can all relate to these… \n1. Being the Bridezilla, because let’s be real, it’s the bride’s day. Pipe down Mary. Mrs Hughes told Cora she didn’t want to get married in the hall (ITV/Screenshot) #Downton go Mrs Hughes you tell them.

That awkward moment when you’re at a job interview and realise it’s totally not what you want. That job was SO beneath Thomas (ITV/Screenshot) My Thomas is on fine form this episode ❤️ #Downton \n3. Being asked out on a date excitement. Is Lady Edith falling in love with another perfectly charming jellyfish of a man? #Downton \n— David Green (@itsdavegreen) October 4, 2015 Can Edith fall for him and him for her and they live happily ever after  #Downton \n4. When that dress off eBay just turns out to be a big fat disappointment. But it looked so nice on the model…(ITV/Screenshot) Mrs Patmore is all of us after buying a cheap dress off of the Internet #downton #DowntonAbbey \n— Barbara Taylor (@BarbsieTaylor) October 4, 2015 \n5.
