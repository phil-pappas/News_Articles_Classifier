(Matt Smith | For lehighvalleylive.com) By Greg Joyce | For lehighvalleylive.com on October 22, 2015 4:47 PM View/Post Comments \nScanning the statistical leaders across the EPC South football scene, you won’t find many names followed by Freedom High School . \nMost of the Patriots are only in the middle of the pack of passing, rushing and receiving stats. Instead, they’re first in the category that matters most: wins. \nAnd another category they likely lead, though it’s hardly at the top of anyone’s go-to stats, is blocked kicks or punts. Freedom has blocked at least one kick or punt in each of its last four games. \n“We have a team here,” coach Jason Roeder said. “In order to be successful in this league, I feel like you gotta pay attention to the little things. That’s on offense, that’s on defense and that’s trying to gain an advantage on special teams. It’s something we practice, something we work on and try to coach. Our kids have been able to go out and execute.\" \nMORE : Freedom's Cordell Cotto anchors EPC's top defense ahead of Parkland showdown \nLast week, it was defensive tackle Deshawn Polk getting his hands on an extra point. The week before that, it was Brennan Reinert blocking a punt for the third straight game, one of which was shared with Jonah Gundrum . \nAnd when the Patriots aren’t able to block the punt, they’re still often able to affect its path with their furious rush. \n“We forced two shank punts (against Whitehall), so it was hard to see if we got a tip on it or not,” Roeder said. \nFreedom has also forced eight interceptions and recovered 10 fumbles behind a stout defense. \nCombined with an effective offense, the culmination has the Patriots in a good position to take home a league title, alone in first place with three games to go. \n“We just had a team meeting and (I said), ‘Just think about how many kids in the Lehigh Valley would change seats with you, to be able to play in this type of game,’” Roeder said Monday. “All you can ask for is opportunities and we have a tremendous one. It’s an opportunity that they’ve earned. You’re excited for Friday, but right now it’s just about trying to win Monday.” \nThat approach of taking the season day-by-day has served the Patriots well. \nThe teams they played through the first seven weeks of the season have a combined record of 17-32. Their final three opponents are 17-4. \nInstead of looking ahead to this stretch, they took care of the first seven weeks in order to make sure they were still in the best spot entering the final three. \n“This year’s team has had to deal with the expectations, whereas last year they didn’t,” Roeder said. “Because of the expectations, I think we needed to be extra, extra focused on a daily basis. \n\"We said coming into this year our two points of emphasis were a focus on staying focused and how we practice. They’re two things we can control and we’ve asked our kids to just put their heads down and take it one day at a time – which we did last year, and I think they saw the success come from that philosophy. They’ve just taken it and ran with it this year.” \nJust another little thing paying a big dividend.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T03:08:44.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
