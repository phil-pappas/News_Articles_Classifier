But NCAA champions don't like to share trophies. \nA year after splitting the title at its own Stanford Intercollegiate hosted by Condoleezza Rice, the No. 9 Cardinal women's golf team took care of business over 54 holes from Sunday to Tuesday to outpace the field by seven strokes. \n\"It's nice to have it on our own,\" Stanford senior Lauren Kim said. \"We don't like sharing titles very much.\" \nThe runner-up was last year's co-champion USC, with the top-ranked Trojans holding off No. 12 UCLA by a stroke in a top-three sweep for the Pac-12. \n\"Winning a tournament outright, and I think we won by seven strokes, it makes it really special and it shows us that the hard work we're putting in is paying off,\" said Stanford sophomore Shannon Aubert, the top individual for the Cardinal with a third-place finish at 3-under par (72-67-71). \nUCLA's Bronte Law claimed back-to-back individual titles with an 8-under score (67-70-68), which was three strokes ahead of runner-up Marissa Chow of Pepperdine (66-70-72). \nThere was a four-way tie for third place at 2-under par that also included the Stanford tandem of Kim and Casey Danielson, but Aubert sank an 11-foot birdie on the 18th and final hole with her teammates watching.

She didn't have a range of shots in her bag, she had one shot and she made it work for her, and it was incredible how she did that. But I would say over the last 365 days we've worked really hard in helping her understand the game of golf and then we've also really worked hard on developing a swing where Shannon can under pressure hit a variety of shots and a short game that under any situation she know she's got multiple shots she can hit to get the ball in the hole. \n\"And that's been the growth with Shannon. She's got more growth to do from 100 yards to 10 yards, from 10 yards to 100 yards. If she does that, I think Shannon Aubert is a contender for player of the year.\" \nKim, a grad of Los Altos High, posted a 3-over 74 on Sunday, but rebounded with a back-to-back rounds under par, including a 67 on Tuesday to tie for the low round. \n\"I was a little off the first day and it happens, what can you do?\" Kim said. \"But I decided the only way to make up for the first day was to come back for the next two.\" \nMariah Stackhouse, Stanford's other senior All-America, finished tied for 40th at 9-over par. \n\"In the four years that she's played here, I haven't remembered a tournament where we didn't count her score, really, and we were able to shake out on top,\" Walker said. \"That just speaks to the depth of our team, the effort that the underclassmen are putting in to get better, to grind, to be in those spots.\" \nAubert added: \"Coach does a really good job of recruiting kids that can not only grow, but can really get out there and compete during tournaments.\" \nPrior to the awards presentation, Rice took a moment to address the student-athletes, in particular. \n\"I know that you have a very, very tough road to be good at your sport and good at your academics, but I want you know how much I admire what you do,\" Rice said. \"I know it's not easy to juggle and balance the commitments on both sides, but you obviously do that and you do it well. And it's going to pay off later in life because you will always be very good at making the best of just a little of time.
