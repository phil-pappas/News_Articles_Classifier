Patty Murray is giving a warning just two months from a government shutdown.\nThe potential loss of federal dollars puts Head Start preschool families at risk of losing the program they rely on.\nRose Camacho wants Head Start to be there for her three-year-old daughter, Eva-Miamor Lynch.\n“It is absolutely giving us a foundation for the rest of her life,” Camacho said at the Denise Louie Education Center in Seattle’s International District.\nHead Start is the federally financed program that gets kids ready for elementary school.\nIt offers nutrition, health and parenting services for families who are working poor and may also face language barriers.\nAfter lunch, Murray read one of her favorite stories to the children. Then she reminded reporters of what happened the last time the government shutdown two years ago.\n“Those budget cuts forced Head Start to cut off services to nearly 60 , 000 children including 1,000 here in Washington State,” Murray said.\nThe House Republicans' chaotic search for a new speaker makes it even more difficult to avoid a government shutdown in November.\nTwo years ago , Murray, a Democrat , worked successfully with Republican Paul Ryan to create a budget compromise.\nAsked if that would make avoiding a shutdown easier, Murray responded:\n“Look, Paul Ryan and I share very different world views but we both agreed to come together and solve the crisis two years ago.”\nAt the Denise Louie Education Center, a government shutdown has the potential to be devastating.\n“On top of our daily struggles, we have to look to the future and wonder, ‘where am I going to go’,” Murray said. “Where is she going to go?”\ncomment (1)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js"], "published": "2015-10-13T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:17:11.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
