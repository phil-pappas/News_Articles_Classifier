The Ducks won 3-0. VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- A group that opposes trophy hunting hopes the case of an NHL player charged with killing a grizzly becomes a rallying cry to protect bears.\nAdChoices About a dozen members of Bears Matter gathered outside provincial court in Vancouver on Friday in connection with a court date for Anaheim Ducks defenseman Clayton Stoner.\nStoner is charged with five counts under the provincial Wildlife Act after a bear was shot on British Columbia's central coast in 2013. He is accused with knowingly making a false statement to obtain a hunting license.\nGroup member Barb Murray hopes the case raises awareness about such hunting practices. Murray also wants Stoner to apologize, pay a large fine and contribute to conservation in the province.\nStoner's case is set for Nov. 13. A lawyer appearing in court on his behalf says he does not know how the player will plead.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:39:41.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
