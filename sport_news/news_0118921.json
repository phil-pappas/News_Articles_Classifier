DT Austin Johnson. Nine tackles and a sack Saturday. Might just be Penn State’s best football player. 2. OT Andrew Nelson. Makes report mostly for being healthy enough to play, but it’s clear he was missed. 3. K Tyler Davis. A Big Toe problem, so to speak, moved Davis back into the kicking picture. 4. RB Nick Scott. Growing into role as ace utility man. 5. WR Geno Lewis. Three catches for 39 yards after a couple weeks of invisibility. That’s how it goes, seemingly, for most PSU wideouts. \nGoing down - 1. K Joey Julius. Bad day for Big Toe. Two straight missed XPs and a kickoff out-of-bounds. 2. OT Paris Palmer. He’s going to need help Saturday. Maybe any rookie left tackle would. 3. WR Saeed Blacknall. As one WR re-emerges (Geno Lewis), another disappears. 4. DT Anthony Zettel. A mega-blue-chipper, so “value going down,’ is a relative term, but he somehow had zero tackles Saturday. 5. TE Brent Wilkerson. Barely noticed out there, and it looks like Adam Breneman will be ready soon.
