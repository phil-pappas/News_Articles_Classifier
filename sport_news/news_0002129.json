Can we? Now, in fairness, it’s possible that a worse play has been run in the National Football League, probably involving the Jets (BUTTFUMBLE), or a kicker (GRAMATICA), or a right-handed quarterback throwing left-handed (Jake Plummer did that once. Jake Plummer turned out to be a cool iconoclast, as it happened).\nNow, you might say those plays were not designed to be so incompetent, to which I say, neither is this column, and yet, he we there.\nAre! Here we are. Looks like it’s another blooper reel for me!\nBut the Indianapolis Colts: oh, that play. You are playing the New England Patriots. Bill Belichick is standing over there with that look on his face, you know, that look, like he’s disappointed that you don’t have a spear sticking out of your sternum. Tom Brady is over there. This would have been his first game back from suspension, but it isn’t, so he’s good and warmed up.\nYou are within a touchdown, late in the third quarter, but have to punt. TIME TO RUN THE PLAY.\nSo if you haven’t seen it, the Colts line up at their own 37, and then suddenly, nine Colts run to the right, leaving a snapper (receiver Griff Whalen) and an imitation quarterback (safety Colt Anderson) behind the snapper, alone and naked, metaphorically. Some Patriots go with the herd, but three or four stay, waiting for the ball to be snapped. Not great odds, unless the Patriots had to count seven steamboats before rushing.\nThey, uh, didn’t. It was like throwing a cat into a shark pool. The Colts were never close again.\nNow, the Internet did its Internet thing and chopped up the play into a million GIFs and Vines and Boppers (not a thing, probably). The Colts tried to defend the play. “The look was not there that we normally have in practice where it’s a go,” said Colts punter Pat McAfee, understatedly.\nThe best part is watching them line up, then switch all around, then snap the ball, then the Patriots dogpiling. So the best part is probably all of it.\nThe world needs more trickeration. Trying trick formations is fun and brave, because you’re taking a risk. When they work, it’s like watching someone skateboard against traffic and make it out the other side. When they don’t, it is like watching a bug who never saw the windshield coming.\nWhat it really reminded me of was U.S. college football. It’s a largely untended sewer of unpaid labour and barely concealed graft surrounded by tribal war camps, but it’s pretty fun as long as neither team is so good that it doesn’t make wild, game-changing mistakes. College football is full of bloopers and mad geniuses and idiot savants, in addition to the hyper-corporo Nick Sabans of the world. It’s less professional, and sometimes that can be good. The lesson here is really, if you’re going to play bad football, make sure it’s at least hilarious.\nLast week this space went 7-6-1 for a second straight week. “ME-DI-O-CRE!” (Clap, clap, clap-clap-clap.)\nAs always, all lines could change.\nTHE PICKS\nMinnesota (-2.5) at Detroit\nAs Detroit’s Golden Tate helped demonstrate last week, the NFL still doesn’t know what a catch is, again. Imagine if baseball had the same problem. Yes, you caught the ball, but you only took two steps and then flipped it into the stands without making a baseball play, so that’s not an out. The Mets win the World Series!\nPick: Minnesota\nPittsburgh (off the board) at Kansas City\nThe NFL fined Steelers defensive end Cam Heyward for wearing eye black that said Iron and Head, honouring his late father, Craig (Ironhead) Heyward, who died of cancer in 2008. Because once you start acknowledging that football players are human and they die, where do you stop?\nPick: Pittsburgh\nN.Y. Jets (+8.5) at New England\nIn that Patriots-Colts game, New England’s Jamie Collins jumped over the entire Colts offensive line on an extra point and blocked the kick, which frankly seems unfair. By the way, the Patriots had 182 points through five weeks of their 16-0 season in 2007. They have 183 so far this year.\nPick: Jets\nTHE REST\nBuffalo (-4.5) at Jacksonville\nPick: Jacksonville\nTampa Bay (+3.5) at Washington\nPick: Tampa Bay\nAtlanta (-4.5) at Tennessee\nPick: Atlanta\nNew Orleans (+4.5) at Indianapolis\nPick: New Orleans\nCleveland (+6) at St. Louis\nPick: Cleveland\nHouston (+4) at Miami\nPick: Miami\nOakland (+4) at San Diego\nPick: Oakland\nDallas (+3.5) at N.Y.
