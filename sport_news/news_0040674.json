Nevin, a former major league corner infielder who has been managing in the minors for the past six years, has become an attractive up-and-coming managerial candidate. \nThe Diamondbacks gave the Astros permission last winter to interview Nevin for the job that went to A.J Hinch. Nevin interviewed for the Marlins managerial vacancy on Thursday. \nWhen Nationals General Manager Mike Rizzo explained Williams’s dismissal earlier in the week, he said he wanted a more extensive search process that pull more from experienced candidates than in 2013. Nevin, 44, has never managed beyond Class AAA. \n“We feel that where we’re at in our timetable, our time-frame of winning a championship, we would lean toward someone who has some type of managerial experience at the major league level,” Rizzo said. “But again, we’re gonna be open minded and look for the best candidate that we can that allows us to win a championship here in the very near future.” \nNevin played first base, third and some outfield over 12 years with the Padres, Tigers, Rangers, Twins, Cubs, Angels and Astros. He is best known for his seven-year tenure with the Padres, where he was an all-star in 2001. In San Diego, Nevin played under then-manager Bruce Bochy, now a three-time champion with the Giants and one of baseball’s elite managers. Nevin, the 1992 first-overall pick by the Astros, hit .270 with 209 home runs over 1,217 career major league games. \nNevin retired in 2007 and began managing in independent league baseball in 2009, then moved to the Tigers’ Class AA and AAA affiliates. In two seasons as the manager of the Reno Aces, the Diamondbacks’ Class AAA affiliate, Nevin compiled a 151-137 record. \n“He’s drawing a lot of attention because he’s rock solid,” said Tony LaRussa, the Diamondbacks’ Chief Baseball Officer and Hall of Fame former manager. “He’s got a great background as a player, manager, infield, hitter and a leader. … He’s outgoing and takes charge. Triple-A is a tough place to manage. He was understanding and nurturing of the young guys but also had the respect of the veterans. He’s smart and has a good out-going personality that attracts people and is built for people. And he runs a hell of a game.” \nLaRussa declined to say which teams have asked about Nevin but vouched for his readiness to manage at the next level. Others who have been around Nevin describe him as a patient and approachable person who held players accountable. \n>>> Cal Ripken Jr.’s name has swirled around the Nationals since the last managerial vacancy. Rizzo and Ripken, 55, have each publicly expressed their admiration for each other. Ripken, who has never coached or managed in the majors, even admitted in August that he and the Nationals had serious discussions about the job but nothing to the point of making a choice. The Nationals went with Williams, but Ripken remains an icon in the Baltimore-Washington area. \nPost columnist Thomas Boswell explored the Ripken’s interesting case in a column . Though Ripken’s family and business interests always caused some to question whether he even wanted a managing job in the first place, people close to him believe he does now, with both of his children off to college and his businesses in strong positions. \nRipken’s son, Ryan, a first baseman, was picked by the Nationals in the 15th round of the 2014 draft and spent last season with the Nationals’ rookie-level Gulf Coast League affiliate. \nThe Nationals appear to still be in the early stages of their search process and it is unclear how many potential candidates have been contacted so far. \n>>> Royals bench coach Don Wakamatsu is among the many potential managerial candidates with previous experience. He was the Mariners’ manager from 2009 to August 2010, fired with a 127-147 record. He was the first Asian-American manager in major league history. \nWakamatsu, 52, has been part of the Royals’ resurgence since the 2014 season. He was a finalist for the Rays’ managerial job last winter that went to Kevin Cash. According to a person familiar with the situation, the Royals have not been contacted by the Nationals about Wakamatsu — but any request, if the Nationals were interested, would typically come after a team is eliminated. \nRoyals General Manager Dayton Moore praised Wakamatsu’s creative thinking and leadership and touted him as a candidate positioned to succeed if — or when — he is given a second opportunity to manage a big league team. \n“He’ll get another chance somewhere, and he’ll be an extremely good manager for someone,” Moore said. “He’s extremely prepared. There’s no doubt in my mind he’ll get another opportunity and be an excellent manager.” \n— Adam Kilgore and Dave Sheinin contributed James Wagner joined the Post in August 2010 and, prior to covering the Nationals, covered high school sports across the region. sports Success!
