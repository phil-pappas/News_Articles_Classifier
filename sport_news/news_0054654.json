Infused with a proprietary blend of performance-enhancing stimulants, Run Gum was designed to help maximize athletes’ performance during workouts and competition.\nRun Gum was co-founded by two-time Olympian and 2015 U.S. 800m champion, Nick Symmonds, who made news this past August during a contract dispute with USA Track and Field which caused him to miss the 2015 IAAF World Championships. Symmonds, a biochemist (B.A. Chemistry, Willamette University class of 2006), launched the company on October 14, 2014 with his long-time mentor and coach, Sam Lapray. After years of experimentation, the two found that chewing gum provided the fastest, most efficient method of delivering caffeine, taurine, and b-vitamins to an athlete’s body.\n“Coach Sam Lapray and I took a big risk when we decided to launch a new business,” said Symmonds. “Over the course of the past year, with the help of some good friends and loyal supporters, we have transformed our wild idea into a profitable enterprise.”\nTo celebrate their one-year anniversary, Run Gum will have deals on their website, giveaways on social media, and live video streams with the team every day from October 12-15 during what they are calling #RUNiversary Week.\nThe week will also mark the beginning of year two for the startup company that has large ambitions for 2016.\n“We have some very big plans for Run Gum's future and are reinvesting all of our profits back into the company as well as putting cash into the hands of professional athletes,” said Symmonds.\nFor more information about Run Gum and their one-year anniversary week, visit http://getrungum.com/\nAbout Run Gum\nRun Gum is a sports supplement brand selling performance chewing gum headquartered in Eugene, Oregon aka TrackTown USA.
