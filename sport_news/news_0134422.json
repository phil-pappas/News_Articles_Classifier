Berry made his first interception of the year off pass Johnson deflected, and Hali forced the game-clinching fumble on a sack in the fourth quarter.\nJohnson especially looked good on passing downs, as he too had an interception of his own coupled with numerous pass deflections and open field tackles. Both Johnson and Berry have been visibly slower at times this year, and still made mistakes this week, but the duos's play-making ability is still there and that’s a good sign for Kansas City moving forward.\nTurnovers were really the key to the game, as Bell was able to run the ball well most of the time. The patient speedster totaled 121 yards on 17 carries, but was kept out of the end zone. This forced Jones to do more than manage the game for Pittsburgh, a tough task for someone making his first career NFL start.\nAt times, Jones looked poised in the pocket, especially on the 19-yard touchdown pass to Martavis Bryant. This was in part due to Kansas City’s inability to create much pressure. Jones only was hit once and sacked twice, all three times by Hali. However, Justin Houston did help in the run game along with Dee Ford, who had a key 4th down stop.\nThe pass defense was inconsistent at times, but was also tasked with covering some of the game’s best receivers. Antonio Brown turned in a 124-yard day as he rotated between corners Sean Smith and Marcus Peters for most of the day. Smith held his own with exception of one mistimed play, but Peters was often overmatched.\nPeters has shown flashes of greatness this year, but also has flaws. The rookie’s run defense continues to be a major weakness as he was thrown down by Bell on one 3rd down run, and was often times turned around by the crafty Brown. He’ll need to be more physical at the line and let his speed recover against top receivers going forward.\nThe Chiefs were able to overcome numerous injuries coming in, as Ramik Wilson and Mike DeVito’s play was missed but not a crucial blow. Josh Mauga returned to inside line backer in Wilson’s spot, but was often times too slow for Pittsburgh’s backs. The Chiefs didn’t create as much pressure as they normally do with Devito in, as the Steelers were able to focus more on shutting down Allen Bailey and Jaye Howard.\nOverall, the Chiefs defense did a commendable job of avoiding the backbreaking big play and limiting the mistakes. The D forced Jones to make big plays, and for the most part, he couldn't deliver. By keeping Brown and Bell out of the end zone they showed they can apply the bend but don’t break mentality to even the game’s best weapons.\nThey’ll need to have more of the same mindset next week, as they’ll be tasked to shut down Calvin Johnson, Jr. and the Detroit Lions in London.\nBe ready to get your game on early. Kickoff is set for 8:30 a.m. central time.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
