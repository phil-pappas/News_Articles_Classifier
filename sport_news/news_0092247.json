Which Colts QB will the Patriots face in Indianapolis on Sunday night? “Obviously,” Patriots defensive coordinator Matt Patricia said Tuesday, “you’ve got to be ready for both guys.” Perhaps, but as Patricia said, indications to this point are that Andrew Luck is “appearing to be moving in the right direction.” Luck has missed the Colts’ last two games with a right shoulder injury. In his place, Matt Hasselbeck – born and raised just a down-and-out from Foxboro (hometown: Norfolk) and the son of former Patriots tight end Don Hasselbeck – stepped in and quarterbacked the team to wins over Jacksonville and Houston and into sole possession of first place in the AFC South. “Hasselbeck has stepped in and done a great job of understanding what they’re trying to do and distributing the ball to the players out on the field and protecting the ball,” said Patricia. While practice in Indianapolis was closed to the media Monday, Luck told reporters afterward: “It feels better every day. It was great to go through practice without limitations, in a sense, and get out there and throw. It was better.” And, for the second straight Monday, third quarterback Josh Johnson was released. Unlike the previous week (when he was re-signed Wednesday), though, this time he won’t be coming back. With starter Tyrod Taylor ailing, the Buffalo Bills signed Johnson on Tuesday. More – maybe – will be learned today when the teams’ initial participation reports of the week must be submitted to the league. If Luck does play, he’ll be facing a team he’s never beaten. Luck is 0-4 lifetime against the Patriots (losing those games by an average of 29 points), his passing percentage against them 50.3, his passer rating not much better (58.7), his interceptions outnumbering his touchdown passes in those games, 10-6. The fourth-year quarterback has also struggled this season. He’s compiled a passer rating of 65.1 and thrown more interceptions (seven) than TDs (five) in the three games he’s played. Despite all that, Patricia labeled Luck “an extremely great quarterback” who “provides a whole level of depth to their offense with his mobility, his arm strength” and is “a great quarterback in the NFL.” “Certainly,” Patricia said, “(Luck is) somebody that brings a huge element of challenge and competition. “I think both quarterbacks are excellent,” said Patricia. “I think we’ve got to be ready for both and we’ll find out on Sunday who’s out there.” Page 2 of 2 - Saddle him up: In Frank Gore, the Colts have taken a step up from the ground game they had when career-long underachiever Trent Richardson was their lead back. With 325 yards (12th in the league) through five games, the former San Francisco 49er, whom the Colts signed as a free agent during the offseason, is on pace for the ninth 1,000-yard season of his 11-year NFL career. “He’s got great vision and great ability to move and jump and cut and see the plays develop and (is) a very patient runner,” said Patricia. “He’s got enough speed to get to the edge and turn those into big plays. “He’s doing an excellent job in the run game. I think that’s really opening up everything else.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T04:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:35:52.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
