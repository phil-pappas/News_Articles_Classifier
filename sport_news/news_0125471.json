She poses like a pro and rocks any couture outfit under the sun with a confidence of a supermodel. Biker chic, preppy, grunge or vintage - give her any look and she's likely to do full justice to it. After Hrs speaks to the Hero actress on her love for all things chic and cool...\nBeing fashion's it girl...\nI don't know if I'm the 'it' girl but it's a nice feeling that everyone thinks I'm confident. I'm happy and excited. I'm having a lot of fun - whether it goes right or wrong, I don't know. I think that what matters. I always wanted to be an actress since young but I wasn't vocal about it. Acting's always been I have loved and enjoyed doing.\nWhat does your name mean...\nGift of God.\nStyle icon.\nKendall Jenner.\nSari or LBD\nI love Indian so sari.\nCheek bones or long limbs\nCheek bones.\nSooraj Pancholi or Salman Khan\nSooraj Pancholi.\nOne product endorsement I'd never do.\nFairness cream.\nBiggest competition? Also, comment about comparisons with Sonam Kapoor.\nThere's only one Sonam Kapoor and no one can ever reach close enough to her. She's in a league of her own. She's one of the elegant and classy actresses of today's times. There's no room for comparisons because she's quite ahead.\nFavourite labels\nSabyasachi and Givenchy. I'm more of a high street shopper so I love Topshop, Bershka and Pull & Bear.\nStyling inputs\nI like to be comfortable in what I wear. It has to suit your body type.\nPersonal style\nBoho chic right now. I'm a very erratic dresser - one day I'd be in track pants with ganjee, next day I'd be girlie. It depends on my mood.\nAccessories love.\nI'm minimalistic. I don't like neck-pieces. I stack up my wrist with watches and bracelets.\nHow often you shop.\nWhenever I travel.\nVintage finds.\nRecently, I found my mom's denim jacket which she used to wear in college and her round glasses, my nani's gold hoops and bracelets.\nMom Mana's style influence.\nGrowing up, I have always seen her put things together well whether it's a plain white shirt with silver jewellery.\nDecade in fashion you want to go back to,\n70's bell bottoms.\nFashion capital\nParis.\nShare a style tip\nIt's okay to make mistakes.\nAny faux pas you think Indian women commit and should avoid?\nWho am I to judge? I make mistakes constantly.", "external_links": ["https://apis.google.com/js/platform.js", "https://plus.google.com/u/0/104225430271191968200/posts"], "published": "2015-10-15T14:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:17:48.153+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
