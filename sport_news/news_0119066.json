On November 21, John Charles' shoe and clothing collection become available to the general public .\nHere's more about John's story and some of his interests that were incorporated in the design of the shoe, courtesy of the OHSU Doernbecher Children's Hospital .\nJohn Charles is a kid of many talents. He plays soccer, does gymnastics and wrestles. He can raise one eyebrow, and since his diagnosis of Crohn's disease, he's discovered that he can swallow seven pills at once. Many of those notable accomplishments have found their way onto John's signature Air Jordan XIII Retro. You'll find his soccer number, a cartoon kid with a raised brow and even seven pills to represent the many meds he takes to manage his disease. A lot of John's other favorite things are represented as well: his twin brother, Jonah, makes an appearance on the sockliner, as does his beloved German shepherd, Teagan, and an Egyptian pyramid. \"If I could travel anywhere in the world, that's where I'd want to go,\" he explained. Even his favorite foods get a shout-out: look closely at the lace tips, and you'll see the words chicken and jo-jos. One of the most powerful features is the one that's hardest to spot. Flip the shoe over, and you'll see the word Crohn's on the outsole. His reasoning? \"When I'm walking, I want to literally stomp out the disease with every step,\" he said. To aid in the effort, the words courage, strength, and fight surround the midsole. John hopes to become a professional soccer player when he grows upâ€”until then, he's content to cheer on the Portland Timbers and take each day as it comes. While he says his family is one of his main sources of support, his dad Tony said it's the other way around. \"John is such a strong kid, wise beyond his years,\" said Tony. \"The way he just quietly deals with whatever is handed to him is really inspiring.\" -- Tim Brown | @ timfsbrown", "external_links": ["http://www.ohsu.edu/xd/about/dchf/fundraising/nike-freestyle/john.cfm", "https://twitter.com/timfsbrown"], "published": "2015-10-24T07:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:52:24.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
