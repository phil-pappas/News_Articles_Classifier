The 45-year-old, an avid golfer and currently part of the Indian women's team at the ongoing 42nd World bridge here, brought glory to the nation when she partnered Ranveer Saini to win gold at the Special Olympics World Games held in Los Angeles in July this year.\nHailing from a family of international sportsmen, it didn't take long for Monica to delve deep into sports. \"Jeev Milkha Singh, my first cousin and his legendary father (Milkha Singh) have always encouraged everyone in our family to take up sport. In fact, each one of us in our family has been inspired by their stupendous feats over the years. I have seen Jeev grow into a champion golfer. I am an outdoor person and have been playing competitive golf for over 12 years. Bridge has been part of me for over seven years now, and managing both can be time consuming,\" Monica told TOI on Monday.\nTo top that, Monica is also part of the management team at the Scottish High International School in Gurgaon. \"I am a vice-chairperson there. It is always about managing your time, and when you have sportspersons of international repute - you don't need to look far for inspiration,\" said Monica.\nShe considers her feat with 14-year-old nephew Ranveer a life-changing experience, and also gave credit to Jeev and Milkha Singh for their unending support. \"Ranveer is an autistic child and was introduced to golf when he was 7. The first thing we needed to do was to break the barrier of communicating with him. The tournament format was that after Ranveer played a shot, I had to play the follow-up shot from where the ball stopped. This was not easy at all. Jeev made sure he comes and meets us before and after the event. He had in fact gifted Ranveer a putter which was specially minted with Jeev's name on it. His father too sent his wishes,\" added Monica.\nThe gold-winning effort of Ranveer ensured he got to meet the first lady of United States-Michelle Obama. \"It was a great experience to meet her. Though it wasn't a one-on-one since she had come to meet the winners of various categories, but her words of encouragement were memorable,\" she said.
