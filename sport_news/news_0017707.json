Additionally, the way Laidlaw marshalled his pack was magnificent throughout. But for all Laidlaw's enduring excellence, plenty of his team-mates were well below that same shining standard - and will need to considerably improve if Scotland are to stand any chance of reaching the last four. \nANOTHER BAD START THREATENED TO COST THE SCOTS DEAR \nBad starts have been a hallmark of the Scottish World Cup campaign so far - they struggled to shake off both Japan and the United States before giving themselves too much to do against South Africa last week. For all their insistence they would work on pressuring the Samoans from the off, they were found spectacularly wanting as the Pacific islanders dominated the early exchanges and came close to scoring a costly upset as a result. \nDECISION-MAKING IS NOT THE SCOTTISH STRONG POINT \nIf there was one slightly negative aspect of Laidlaw's towering performance, it was his decision-making early in the second half when the Scots still trailed by three points. Twice in succession Laidlaw opted not to go for the points, effectively costing his side the lead. Fortunately, the Samoans' persistent misdemeanours allowed the Scots to emerge unscathed. Laidlaw opted to kick his next two opportunities - and Scotland managed to hang onto their advantage. \nSAMOA EXPOSED THE SCOTS' LACK OF PHYSICALITY ACROSS THE LINE \nThe ease with which the Samoans breached Scottish lines in their three-try first half will have set alarm bells ringing for coach Vern Cotter with much sterner tests to come. Cotter made seven changes from last week's loss to South Africa, bringing back his supposed big guns, but arguably last week's weakened line-up showed more strength in dealing with opposition attacks. The good news is, it gives Cotter a selection dilemma ahead of Twickenham next week. \nTHERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH SCOTLAND'S MENTAL STATE \nFor all their obvious failings, one thing that certainly cannot be levelled against Scotland is an inability to perform under pressure. Laidlaw's cool head led by example as his side shrugged off a monumental effort by the Samoans in the first half. Despite their last-eight berth apparently hanging by a thread, the Scots played as if they were always confident of turning things around - and once they gained the lead late on it was one they never looked likely to relinquish.
