We had one, we were fourth-and-four down by the goal line, but we were 0 of 7 in our last three games on fourth down and short. So going into that situation you gotta be smart about when you do it, how you do it, what play do you have and what kind of room do you have to be able to spread the ball out and things like that.” \nKU finished 1-of-3 on fourth-down conversions Saturday. \n— See what people were saying about the game during KUsports.com's live blog .
