(AP) - A 25-year-old New Hampshire mother has waived arraignment on a murder charge in the death of her toddler daughter.\nKatlin Paquette was arrested Saturday on a second-degree murder charge, accused of recklessly causing the death of Sadence Willott. She remained jailed Monday; her lawyer filed a notice that she would not be appearing for arraignment.\nPaquette is scheduled for Oct. 13 hearing.\nAuthorities say the 21-month-old girl suffered a fatal brain injury; the medical examiner ruled her death a homicide caused by blunt impact head injuries.\nPolice responded to a call to their Manchester home Sept. 5 and found the child unresponsive. She was taken to a hospital, where she died the next day.\nThe story has been corrected to show that Katlin Paquette is 25, not 22.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-28T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:49:44.903+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
