It's happened a lot. But it's likely you've never seen it done with a walkoff touchdown scored on a wildcat direct snap to the running back. That does not happen a lot.\nThat was the case tonight as the Pittsburgh Steelers snatched the hearts of San Diego by the nose of the football. Had Le'Veon Bell fallen a few inches short(er) time would've ran out and the Steelers would've lost 20-17. Instead they're traveling back east with a 24-20 'W,' and a 3-2 record.\nOn top of that, had Bell not gotten in, Mike Tomlin would've almost certainly been annihilated all week by outraged fans calling for his job. Instead he'll get celebrated for his ruthless aggression.\nAnd if that isn't enough, tonight's touchdown likely saved the NFL from a disaster brought about by the guy running the clock at Qualcomm Stadium , as well as the refs who failed to notice his/her screw-up:\nMajor clock error on kickoff. Steelers lost 24 seconds on a touchback. pic.twitter.com/ET9MOfgBGn\nâ€” Jason Vida (@jasonvida) October 13, 2015 What a difference breaking the plane makes, huh?\n[via Vine ]\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com", "external_links": ["https://vine.co/v/eEKXU1uaxdX", "https://twitter.com/jasonvida/status/653774257181323264", "http://t.co/ET9MOfgBGn"], "published": "2015-10-13T07:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T18:22:47.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
