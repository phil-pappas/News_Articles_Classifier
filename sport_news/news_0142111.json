I don't think there will be much motivation needed to play on Sunday.\"\nAtletico also have reason to seek revenge as they were eliminated from the Champions League for the second consecutive season by Madrid in their last meeting back in April.\nHowever, that defeat ended a seven-game unbeaten run against Real.\n\"Sunday will be a special game for everyone. Lately we have played very well against them, above all here at home and we hope it continues like this,\" added Atletico captain Gabi.\nReal boss Rafael Benitez may be able to recall the injured trio of Gareth Bale, James Rodriguez and Sergio Ramos, who have all missed the last four games.\nSpanish international Koke remains Atletico's only injury doubt, with Simeone tasked with deciding between the misfiring Jackson Martinez or Fernando Torres to partner Antoine Griezmann up front.\nBarcelona could move four points clear of Real on Saturday when the injury-ravaged European champions travel to Sevilla.\nThe blow of losing Lionel Messi for two months was intensified as Andres Iniesta hobbled off during Barca's 2-1 win over Bayer Leverkusen in midweek and is also set for a month on the sidelines.\n\"It is not just 11 or 12 players that win competitions, there are reserves behind and now some of those that wouldn't have had so many minutes will get their chance,\" said Argentine defender Javier Mascherano.\n\"Those of us that are fit need to keep going and know that whilst we win games there is less time left until those important players return.\"\nElsewhere, Celta Vigo have the opportunity to move top for 24 hours on Friday when they host Getafe.\nLeaders Villarreal are favourites to stretch their winning streak to six league games when they visit Levante on Sunday.\nFormer Manchester United boss David Moyes's position as Real Sociedad boss will come under more scrutiny should the Basques fail to secure just their second win of the campaign at a Malaga side that has yet to score a goal this season.\nAnd Valencia will be aiming to continue their upturn in form with a third consecutive win when they visit Athletic Bilbao.\nFixtures (all times GMT)\nFriday\nCelta Vigo v Getafe (1830)\nSaturday\nSevilla v Barcelona (1400), Granada v Deportivo la Coruna (1615), Espanyol v Sporting Gijon (1830), Las Palmas v Eibar (2000), Malaga v Real Sociedad (2005)\nSunday\nRayo Vallecano v Real Betis (1000), Athletic Bilbao v Valencia (1400), Levante v Villarreal (1615), Atletico Madrid v Real Madrid (1830) ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-02T17:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:46:57.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
