But we remain focused on the necessary reform process, the Presidential election and on supporting the current investigations. To restore public trust is a crucial objective.” \nActing Secretary General Markus Kattner discussed the main administrational matters with Hayatou and provided an overview of FIFA’s activities over the next few months. \n“Operationally, FIFA is working well, as it should, and the best example is the FIFA U-17 World Cup, which is about to kick-off in Chile”, said Kattner. \n“On top of that, the FIFA World Cup qualifiers are taking place and over one million spectators attended matches this week in Asia. Our football development activities across the globe continue apace and our preparations for the upcoming FIFA Club World Cup in Japan and the FIFA Ballon d’Or 2015 are also progressing well.” \nActing President Issa Hayatou will remain in Zurich until next week, when he will lead the Extraordinary Executive Committee meeting on Tuesday 20 October at the Home of FIFA. \nHayatou as the most senior vice president of FIFA took charge in acting capacity following the 90 day suspension of Sepp Blatter alongside UEFA president, Michel Platini. Both men have appealed their ban, insisting that they have done no wrong. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
