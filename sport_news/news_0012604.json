There is no try.\nJulian Edelman did, again .\nThe wide receiver shared a Patriots-inspired version of the latest poster for Stars Wars: The Force Awakens on Monday night shortly after a highly anticipated trailer for the film aired on ESPN.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below #starpats pic.twitter.com/zPQoMz8Kv9\n— Julian Edelman (@Edelman11) October 20, 2015 The original version of the poster containing heroes and villains whose exploits occur far, far away from Foxborough was released on Sunday.\nCheck out the new official poster! Tune in to @ESPN ?s Monday Night Football for a new look at #TheForceAwakens . pic.twitter.com/NTRWLlVyID\n— Star Wars (@starwars) October 18, 2015 While entertainment outlets and sci-fi blogs will study the new trailer and official poster as if they were Jedi holocrons , let’s breakdown Edelman’s iteration of the poster:\nBill Belichick as Rylo Ken: The head coach of the Patriots has long been hailed and/or reviled as Darth Belichick. Here, he is cast as the Vader-obsessed villain with that divise crossguard lightsaber .\nJulian Edelman as Rey: The Patriots’ wideout made himself the focal point of his own poster by standing in for Rey, a previously unheralded young scavenger who seems to be the central character of the film (and just might be force sensitive ).\nJamie Collins as Finn: The linebacker who defied gravity against the Colts might just be the only player dynamic enough for a role that seemingly involves both being a Stormtrooper and wielding a lightsaber.\nRob Gronkowski as Chewbacca: Strong? Check. Willing sidekick? Sure. Not exactly a wordsmith? GGGWARRRHHWWWW.\nDanny Amendola as Princess Leia: A day after notching his fourth 100-yard receiving game with the Patriots, Amendola nabbed the role of Leia: Rebel, diplomat, princess and sex symbol. Leia might just be the most heroic character of the original trilogy. Can Amendola measure up?\nTom Brady as Han Solo: The Patriots’ four-time Super Bowl champion quarterback is the swashbuckling scoundrel with a heart of gold who piloted the Millennium Falcon, obviously.\nWhat do you think it all means?\nActually, just drop those thoughts in the comments. There’s no time to discuss this as a committee.\nPHOTOS: Casting Deflategate: The Movie\nPrevious -- of -- Next Ben Affleck as Tom Brady: If Ben can don Batman's cape and cowl, the \"Good Will Hunting\" co-conspiritor has as good a shot as anyone at filling the No. 12 jersey. and Chris Pizzello / AP Previous -- of -- Next Steve Buscemi as Tom Brady Sketch: If Buscemi is the first actor to audition for the role of Brady Sketch 1, then all others would be sent home immediately. Sketch by Jane Rosenberg (left) / Photo courtesy HBO Previous -- of -- Next Elizabeth Banks as Gisele Bundchen: The Pittsfield native's role as Vinnie Papale's love interest in Disney's \"Invincible\"certainly gives Banks the leg up for the highly coveted role as Tom Brady's supermodel wife.

Robin Marchant / Getty (left) and Charles Krupa / AP Previous -- of -- Next Casey Affleck as Julian Edelman: The younger Affleck makes perfect sense to take on the role as Tom Brady's favorite receiver and superpal Julian Edelman.

Richard Drew / AP (left) and Mario Anzuoni / Reuters Previous -- of -- Next Terrence Howard as Ted Wells: Many say the pure acting chops of Howard's \"Hustle & Flow\" is enough to secure the role of lead Deflategate investigator Ted Wells. But sometimes a good mustache can get you places in this world. Handout photo (left) and Damian Dovarganes / AP Previous -- of -- Next Denis Leary as Bill Belichick: Sarcastic? Check. Unwilling to suffer fools lightly? Check. Experience playing a head coach on the big screen... the Browns even! Check. Slam dunk casting. Jim Davis / The Boston Globe (left) and Todd Heisler / New York Times Previous -- of -- Next Craig Robinson as Vince Wilfork: It's pure swagger that gives Robinson the edge to play the former Patriots nose tackle's role in the film. A hot tub that can travel through time certainly helps. Brynn Anderson / AP (left) and Vivian Zink / NBC Previous -- of -- Next John Slattery as Robert Kraft: Boston's own slick John Slattery of \"Mad Men\" fame could certainly portray Patriots wealthy owner and unwavering Brady supporter Robert Kraft. Slattery's role as a Ford executive in \"Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights\" gives him the necessary upper class experience. Gene J.

Gene J. Puskar / AP (left) and Disney Enterprises Previous -- of -- Next Jason Mewes as Jim McNalley and Kevin Smith as John Jastremski: Perhaps this could be the perfect - and hilarious - scene from \"Deflategate,\" as the Patriots locker room equipment attendants deliver Brady a basketball after a texting mishap.

Brad Barket / AP Previous -- of -- Next Dane Cook as the pump: Need to take the air out of a fellow comic? Cook could do the trick. Handout Photos Previous -- of -- Next Michael Schur as the Patriots lawyer who wrote The Wells Report in Context: It's not entirely clear if the writer behind Fire Joe Morgan and \"Parks & Recreation\" - also the actor that played Mose Schrute in \"The Office\" - was the inspiration for wellreportcontext.com. But judging from the breakdown, is sure seems likely.
