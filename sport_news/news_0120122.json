I look at the injury as a blessing from God. If I hadn’t gotten hurt, I don’t’ know where I would have ended up.” \nLocated in Mechanicsburg, Pa., Messiah is a longtime Division III powerhouse. As a freshman in 2012, Elsaesser started some games and helped the Falcons win the NCAA Division III title for the second straight year. \n“I owe my transition to the senior class that year,” she said. “They made you feel so welcomed and didn’t make you feel like a little freshman who couldn’t do anything.” College Corner: P-Way's Williams aiding soccer power \nShe has returned the favor to subsequent newcomers. The result speaks for itself. \n“We end up winning a lot of games but people don’t see the behind-the-scenes part of that,” Elsaesser said, “how we invest in each other as teammates more than as individuals. If matters more that we’re friends.” \nOn the field, Elsaesser is working her way up Messiah’s record book. She currently ranks fourth in program history in career goals (64) and tied for fourth in assists (36). With 10 goals and eight assists so far this fall, she’s on her way to finishing second in both categories. \n“I don’t really think it matters too much,” she said of the numbers. “If what the team needs me to do is score goals, that’s what I want to do for my teammates. But it’s not really about me. The last piece might be me scoring a goal, but it took a bunch of plays by my teammates to get the ball up there. To me, it’s more about the team.” \nThat team is 10-0-2 so far and ranked No.1 in Division III. Elsaesser, who graduates in May with a degree in athletic training, would love to bookend her career by leading Messiah to another national title. No matter what happens, though, the experience has been the ultimate victory. \n“My coach always talks about excellence, which is doing the little things right every day,” she said. “That’s how you become better. I’m going to take that with me in whatever I do after graduation.” \nCollege Corner appears each Tuesday in the Courier News and Home News Tribune. Send tips to Jerry Carino: jcarino@gannettnj.com .
