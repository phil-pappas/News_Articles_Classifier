Their margin for error was microscopic, at best, and they wasted no time showing the Rams (4-3) that they meant business.\nSenior quarterback Steele Lombardi capped the opening drive with a 5-yard touchdown pass to senior tight end Ryan Lawton. It was the first of three touchdown passes from Lombardi to Lawton as the Cardinals opened a 35-7 lead.\nLombardi completed 12 of 17 passes for 179 yards and five touchdowns. He also ran for 50 yards, and did an outstanding job managing drives.\n\"He's played well this year,\" Hard said. \"He's done a great job for us.\"\nLawton caught five passes for 79 yards and three touchdowns, including a 47-yarder in the third quarter that seemingly put the game out of reach with 3:09 remaining in the third quarter.\nBut the Rams, who could still see Westwood again in the playoffs, never hung their heads. They scored a late touchdown in the third quarter to make it 35-13, and then made the Cardinals sweat out the final 12 minutes.\nRamsey senior quarterback Thomas Feehan led an impressive late drive, connecting with junior wide receiver Chris Blasius on a 16-yard touchdown pass to make it a seven point game with 40 seconds left.\nThe Rams then tried an onside kick, and after a scrum at midfield, the Cardinals came away with the ball to seal the victory.\n\"We certainly made it interesting,\" Hard said with a smile.\nFeehan had an outstanding second half for the Rams, who came into the game sitting No. 3 in North 1, Group 2 after last week's upset of Ridgefield Park. He completed 16 of 24 passes for 226 yards and three touchdowns.\nThe Cardinals got some help Friday when Lakeland lost to Wayne Valley, but still have to beat Dumont on Friday, hoping that will be enough to earn them a shot at another sectional title.\nHard said this was the kind of game that a young team can build on going forward.\n\"We hope so,\" Hard said. \"If we don't go forward from this, well. We're a young team that's been getting better every week, but we still have a lot to do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:02:23.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
