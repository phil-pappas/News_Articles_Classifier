Celebrated polling site Fivethirtyeight.com pointed out in June that 57 percent of Republicans disliked the real-estate mogul and reality-TV performer. \"For this reason alone, Trump has a better chance of cameoing in another 'Home Alone' movie with Macaulay Culkin -- or playing in the NBA Finals -- than winning the Republican nomination.\"\nBut it's now four months later, and pundits are being forced to reconsider their predictions. Because Trump, defying all expert opinion, is still leading in the the GOP polls. In August, Fivethirtyeight's founder, Nate Silver, put Trump's chances at winning the GOP nomination at 2 percent. This week he grudgingly upped that prediction to \"high single digits\" -- with a caveat. \"There's a lot of existential uncertainty here,\" he said. \"If you're being purely empirical -- well, nobody quite like Trump has won a party nomination before, or even come all that close to it. So there's some universe where his chances are 0 percent.\"\nNeedless to say, that means there's also some universe where his changes are 100 percent. In short: no one knows what to expect anymore.\nDavid Burstein, founder of the political-reform group Run for America , believes we need to start preparing ourselves for the possibility that Trump will indeed win the nomination and go on to become the next president of the United States. Burstein has looked at the polls and the electoral map for Vanity Fair magazine and has concluded that \"Trump is just as competitive -- and perhaps more so -- as either John McCain, in 2008, or Mitt Romney, in 2012.\"\nThe reason for this unexpected competitiveness: Trump has been astonishingly successful at defining himself as a pure, anti-establishment bellower of truths, which is exactly what Republican voters and many independents are looking for. Remember, the goal in a presidential general election is not necessarily to win the national popular vote. The goal is to win the Electoral College , and most of the states that make up the Electoral College vote are locked down for one party or the other no matter who the nominees are. Burstein's analysis suggests that, in a general election against Hillary Clinton or any of the other Democratic presidential candidates, Trump would do much better in the key battleground states than the mainstream punditocracy wants to admit. \"Which all means,\" Burstein states, \"that the election comes down to Florida and Ohio, two states where Trump has significant advantages.\"\nIn Florida, Trump is, incredibly, polling better than his Floridian GOP competitors Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. The state's Cuban voters are less likely than Hispanics in other states to find Trump's anti-immigration bloviating offensive, and, Burstein writes, \"the Florida voting population includes a high percentage of evangelicals (a group with whom Trump seems to have had baffling success).\" As for Ohio, Trump has a magician's hold on working-class and many young voters. \"Trump's resonance with today's version of the American Dream is hugely aspirational for people who are unemployed and financially hurting,\" Burstein writes. Burstein also believes Trump has the potential to turn out a huge number of new voters across the country -- basically, all those reality-TV watchers who don't normally pay any attention to politics.\nThe upshot: We can no longer consider Donald Trump a sideshow to the serious business of running for president. Trump and his reality-TV style of campaigning are the new normal. Notice has been given: We have four years to get ready for the epic 2020 showdown between Trump, the incumbent, and insurgent challenger Kanye West .\n-- Douglas Perry", "external_links": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2015/10/donald-trump-could-be-president", "http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/why-donald-trump-isnt-a-real-candidate-in-one-chart/", "http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/12/trump-unlikely-to-end-up-as-president-obama.html", "http://www.runfor.us/about", "http://www.270towin.com/", "http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/donald-trump-is-doomed-andor-invincible/", "http://time.com/4055682/ellen-degeneres-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-president/"], "published": "2015-10-23T17:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:11:43.741+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
