(WUSA9) -- Most people wouldn't think about getting dressed without them, but imagine an organization decicated to donating underwear. \nThat's what Leonardtown's head football coach Ron Weinberger has dedicated his time to off the field. \n\"My daughter started bustin' on me about it, Dad you can do toys for tots or coats. That's so embarrassing,\" said Weinberger. \nOf course high schoolers thought their coach was kidding. It's all fun and games until you don't have any. \n\"Nobody really thinks about it when they're donating stuff and that's when it was like, yeah, this is something we need to do,\" said James Scheetz, a junior linebacker for the Raiders. \nWhen Weinberger brought the idea of collecting underwear to his players at Leonardtown, they realized they wanted to make sure the under-served got that basic necessity. So for the last two years, they've partnered with the non-profit Underwearness to collect the item many of us take for granted. \n\"When you go to homeless shelters, you can see the pantries of food, you can see coats, you see clothes, you don't see underwear,\" said Weinberger. \nIt might be hard to understand, but receiving underwear can change the way kids feel about themselves. The same goes with donating. \n\"Making other people more self confident and happy makes you happy,\" said Scheetz. \nThe Raiders are on schedule to meet their goal of a week's worth of underwear for at least 300 children. Their work will benefit youngsters in St. Mary's County, like Kayleah Perry and her siblings. \n\"Sometimes the people who do donate to the people who don't have them so it'll be fair,\" said Perry. \nKayleah went on to say that if she could have the chance to meet those heroes at Leonardtown who donate, she would make sure to thank them. \nAnd what does Coach Weinberger's daughter think about the Underwearness campaign now after being embarrassed at first? \n\"Now she gives me advice on how to do it better,\" said Weinberger. \nThey will collect underwear at Friday's game and again for homecoming on October 23. They will also take money. They don't have a link yet, but you can donate to the national non-profit, http://www.underwearness.org/ . \nLike this story?
