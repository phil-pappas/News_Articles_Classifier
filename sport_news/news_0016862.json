Shashikala (40) was found injured and unconscious at the Tohana railway station on October 6. Ranjit Singh, a passenger found her lying between the platform and railway track with injuries on her head, arm and on other parts of the body. She was admitted to General Hospital, Tohana. Dr Satish Garg, Senior Medical Officer of the hospital, said she had a fractured forearm and other minor injuries. “Dr Garg contacted us to look after her and to locate her family,” said Kush Bhargava, state convener of Bharat Vikas Parishad (BVP). He lives in Tohana. “We inquired about her identity and past after she started feeling better. She told us she is from Kosaideh village near Thalamadu city of Adilabad in Telangana,” he said. Then she made a shocking revelation that her husband had pushed her out of Howrah Express on the night intervening October 5 and 6 when the train resumed its journey after a brief halt at Tohana. She alleged Ramana had illicit relations with another woman back home and he had taken (Shashikala) to Hanumangarh in Rajasthan on some pretext, but with the motive of selling her off. When she resisted against this at Hanumangarh, Ramana agreed to take her back to Telangana but on the way threw he her out of the train. “On October 7, we contacted Adilabad SP Tarun Joshi on telephone and apprised him of the episode. He personally looked into the matter and sent a police party from Telengana (Constables Sirajjudin, Gangma, Shrivani) to take Shashikala back. The police party reached here on Friday and took the woman back the same evening after completing all legal formalities. “Joshi told us that Ramana is already a convict in a criminal case and the police had taken him into custody for attempting to murder Shashikala,” Bhargava said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:08:07.593+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
