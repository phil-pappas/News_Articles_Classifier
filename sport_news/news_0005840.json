This was back in 2012, during coach Todd Graham's first year at Arizona State. Magee was a senior linebacker, and here was this hard-hitting newcomer from Long Beach Poly High trying to get noticed.\n\"He always had a very strong punch when we were hitting the bag drills and he was always very aggressive, it's just sometimes he would go the wrong way.'' Magee said, laughing. \"But I knew right off the bat with his mentality and his work ethic that he was going to be a great linebacker.\"\nThree years later, Fiso has reached that point. Entering Saturday's showdown at No. 4 Utah, the junior strong-side linebacker is playing at an all-conference level, putting himself in the early mix for Pac-12 Pat Tillman Defensive Player of the Year. A three-year starter, Fiso leads the nation in solo tackles (45) and ranks ninth nationally in tackles for loss (10.5), but his bigger contribution might come in how he's led ASU's defense.\nAZCENTRAL\nASU XTRA app: Get latest news, analysis, scores, photos\nGraham said this week no one on that side of the ball is more respected than Fiso. That's why he decided to promote the linebacker to team captain, six weeks into the season. It's something that needed to be done, the coach said.\nIt's taken awhile to get to this point.\nOver the last two seasons, co-defensive coordinator Keith Patterson tried different methods to motivate the laid-back Fiso. In spring practice, he moved sophomore Christian Sam ahead of him on the depth chart just to see how the linebacker would react. He told Fiso -- who turned 21 on Tuesday -- he didn't want the same linebacker from last season. He wanted someone better, hungrier.\n\"Me and him, we talked about it (recently),\" Patterson said. \"Sometimes with all the right intentions, you can try. And all he did, he just committed to it instead of just trying. ... I noticed it Day 1 when I watched them run in the summer time. I saw a difference in him. I tested him early in fall camp by putting Sam in front of him just to see if he was still just trying or was he committed. Obviously, he was committed to being a better player.\"\nAZCENTRAL\nBoivin: Utah football game has smell of ASU upset\nFiso declined an interview request Wednesday, simply saying \"I'm good, I'm good,\" as he rushed past a reporter. In a rare group interview last week, the linebacker explained his leadership style: \"A vocal leader? Still not me. I just play. I play and do my part and try to do my part the best I can and that in itself is leading I feel like. And helping the young guys like (sophomore linebacker) DJ (Calhoun) and Christian next to me, making sure they understand what they're doing.\"\nThose close to Fiso have noticed a different approach, a sharper focus. Junior defensive tackle Viliami Latu – one of Fiso's roommates – said the linebacker at times last season \"was lazy, lounging around\" at home. This season, he's hooking up his iPad to the television to watch film.\n\"He's more serious,'' Latu said. \"He takes practice very seriously. ... He's acting like a real captain. He has a whole other step he has to get to. He has two more years, this year and next year, and he's trying to make a name for himself.\"\nD.J. Foster has noticed the same from the opposite side of the ball.\nAZCENTRAL\nASU football midseason roundtable: The highs and lows\n\"Salamo's a very interesting person,'' the senior receiver said. \"I've never seen someone make the steps and strides he has this year. Leading the nation in solo tackles. The intensity (in which) he plays with on game day. It's unbelievable, even in practice. That's where his biggest improvement has (come), in practice. He's bringing it every day.\"\nSpeaking of those tackles, redshirt freshman safety Dasmond Tautalatasi said he recently brought up the statistic to Fiso, trying to pay him a compliment. The linebacker's reaction: I'm focused on a bigger picture.\n\"On the field, even off the field, just the way he goes about himself, he shows a lot of leadership qualities,\" Tautalatasi said. \"I love being around him.\"\nMagee – who's watched every ASU contest this season – sees a linebacker that sets a tone. As Fiso goes, the Sun Devils go, he said. He also sees a linebacker playing within Graham's attacking system and making the most of it.\nAZCENTRAL\nPac-12 football power rankings - Week 7\n\"The thing I like most about him: He doesn't try to do too much,'' Magee said. \"He does what he has to do and he makes plays when he's called upon, like when he's blitzing off the edge or making tackles for loss. He has great instincts and he can get off blocks. … And he's only going to continue to grow.\"\nContact Doug Haller at 602-444-4949 or at doug.haller@arizonarepublic.com.
