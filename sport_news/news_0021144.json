Mariota has handled the challenges of varying defensive schemes from opponents, and he will be tested by Buffalo coach Rex Ryan and his defense when the Titans face Buffalo (KOIN-6 (CBS), 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET) .\nMariota hasn't used his legs very much, preferring to remain in the pocket and look for receivers in passing situations. He may be scrambling a little more often if the Titans offensive line cannot figure out the Bills defensive formations and blitz packages.\n\"I don't think the kid is going to have his way with us,'' Ryan told reporters during a teleconference call. \"I don't think that is going to happen.\"\nThe Bills possess their own dual-threat quarterback in Tyrod Taylor. Taylor, who has been in the NFL for five years, doesn't possess much more game experience than Mariota. Taylor didn't play much during his first four seasons before Ryan named him the starting quarterback to begin the 2015 season.\nIf you want to watch Mariota and the Titans take on the Bills, here's what you need to know:\nWhat : Buffalo Bills at Tennessee Titans\nWhere : Nissan Stadium, Nashville, TN\nWhen : Sunday, Oct. 11, 10 a.m. PT/1 p.m. ET\nTV : KOIN-6 (CBS)\nWatch online : You can watch the live stream of DirecTV's live stream package.\n-- Geoffrey C.
