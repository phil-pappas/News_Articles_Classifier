Alma’s Whitlock And Family Back On Track Times Record • ktaylor@swtimes.com \nMULBERRY — It’s 5:30 a.m. as Trevor Whitlock traipses across the wet, dew-covered grass toward his early model Dodge Ram 1500. \nAs the black truck zips along U.S. 64 on its way to the Frank Vines Fieldhouse for an early morning workout under the lights at Alma’s Airedale Stadium, Whitlock cranks up the music. Today’s choice is rock. \n“But it doesn’t matter,” he says, arms folded. “I like all kinds of music.” \nWhitlock’s choice of music fits his personality. Creed, Popcaan and George Strait might seem like an odd musical mix. \nBut considering Whitlock’s long and sometimes imprecise path toward adulthood, Popcaan’s “Everything Nice” reggae sound and Strait’s classic country twang “Gone As A Girl Can Get” make for good company. \nTrevor Lee Whitlock is a survivor. \n“Trevor is very determined,” says Tashonda Plant, Trevor’s mom. “He’s very headstrong; he’s wise beyond his years. \n“He’s overcome a lot to be where he’s at.” \nWhitlock landed on Alma football coach Doug Loughridge’s doorstep last spring, though the veteran coach knew better than to get his hopes up. Whitlock has a past. Alma High School was his third school in a span of two months. \nIn fact, Alma wasn’t Whitlock’s first athletic choice. \nAfter moving from Little Rock Christian to Mulberry, where he had gone to school from kindergarten through sixth grade, Whitlock hoped to play basketball and baseball for the Yellowjackets. But he says he was ruled ineligible to participate in the second half of the 2014-15 school year. \nSo he enrolled at Alma. \nAnd, though letters from Division I football programs aren’t pouring in, the 5-foot-11, 165-pound senior is having a solid season as the team’s weak side cornerback. \n“He’s a great athlete, but to come into a place your senior year, where this group’s already been here for three years, he did a really good job of adapting,” Loughridge said. “It takes a little while to get used to the routine we do, but he bought in.” \nNew routines are to Whitlock like water is to fish. \nA month shy of his 18th birthday, Whitlock’s unwavering hardship in elementary school might have broken many. \nNot Trevor. \nBoth his parents, Plant and Willie Jones Jr., spent time in prison during Whitlock’s formidable years in elementary school. He overcame the hardships. \nSo did his parents. \nPlant, 41, is happily remarried and thriving in Little Rock, and Jones, 69, is on his feet and doing well for himself in Mulberry. \n“Both of my parents are doing good now; they’ve been through a lot,” Whitlock said. \nThe once “ornery” Whitlock lives with his dad in a red brick duplex on Church Street in Mulberry, right across from the double-wide mobile home he once lived in with his aunt, Felecia Whitlock, back in elementary school. \nA friendly blue heeler named “Blue” is attached to 20-foot chain in the backyard. \n“That dog will lick you to death,” Whitlock said. \nA Vietnam veteran, Jones is a retired truck driver with a somewhat stormy past. Born in Spiro but raised “in and around Fort Smith and Van Buren,” Jones is a story all to his own — some of it good, some of it not. \nThe former Marine spent portions of 1967-69 in the Vietnam War. He retired from trucking and became a disabled vet following open-heart surgery. He also spent time in prison. \n“When I was in the first grade, the SWAT team busted in, and I went to DHS for a little while, and my aunt ended up taking care of us,” Whitlock said. “That was the period that I went to Mulberry from the first through the sixth grade.” \nWhitlock was born Nov. 15, 1998, at Sparks Regional Medical Center. His parents were never married. Whitlock took his mom’s maiden name. \nInvisible Shield \nWhitlock has 12 siblings. “My mom has three children, dad has five, and my stepdad has four,” he said. \n“We had five kids in the house,” Whitlock said. “We would eat breakfast, lunch and dinner — all at the same time. You always ate what was on your plate.” \nAs he grew older, Whitlock developed a deep passion for sports. After reuniting with his mom in the summer of 2009, Whitlock played travel baseball with, among others, Catholic baseball and football standout Lance Harville-Thomas. He played travel basketball, too. And, after enrolling at Little Rock Christian, Whitlock excelled as a good football player. \nBut there was always that void; mom and dad weren’t always there. \n“It was tough growing up,” Whitlock said. “For a long time, they were out of my life. I was wishing they were at my ballgames, but I knew once they were out they would come. I look for them in the stands when I’m out there.” \nWhitlock built an invisible shield. \n“I just continued to play hard and not let anything affect me,” he said. “I didn’t put any weight on my shoulder. I had a chip there, but I managed to get through with my head held high, knowing that God had a plan for me.” \nThe Turnaround \nTashonda Plant was raised in Mulberry. As a young adult, however, Plant was in and out of trouble with the law, which eventually led to a six-year incarceration. \n“We went through six years of me being away from him, and there wasn’t anything I could do about that,” Plant said. “I was raised with an alcoholic parent, plus my mom (Mickey) died when I was 12; I made a lot of bad choices — it was my fault. \n“(But) I had to leave my children for six years.” \nUpon her release, Plant soon reunited with Whitlock. \n“I wasn’t living with her when she first got out; I gave her a little time,” he said. “But now, she’s going to church every Sunday; she’s really pushing me to continue my faith. I look up to her.” \nWhitlock enrolled at Little Rock Christian Academy in the fall of 2009 and remained there through the first semester of his junior year. A brush with a Warriors assistant coach over a misunderstanding during his sophomore football season disrupted what he had considered a “great time” at LRC. \n“I just didn’t feel like I was in the right place,” he said. “I got along with everybody, and I had a bunch of friends, I just felt out of place.” \nBack Home \nLast January, Whitlock moved back to Crawford County, enrolled at Mulberry High School and prepared to finish the school year playing basketball and baseball. \nBut after the first nine weeks, he left the school after being ruled athletically ineligible. \n“It was definitely tough, transitioning from one school to another, and then another,” Whitlock said. “It’s really been a breeze this year having the same curriculum. It was kind of tough going to three schools; I kind of struggled with my grades.” \nThe adjustment of moving back home with his dad wasn’t hard for either Trevor or Willie. \n“I was glad to get him back with me,” Jones said. “He’s my youngest one (child), and I’m proud of him very much. \n“He’s a survivor.” \nThe Alma Way \n“We sat down with him at the first of summer and said, ‘Look, you’ve got all kinds of athletic ability, but we have to figure out how to make it work.’ He’s done a great job; he’s been here every day,” explained Loughridge, in his third season as the team’s coach. “We started him off at safety and had to move him to corner.” \n“It’s always odd being the new kid,” Whitlock said. “(But) they (Alma teammates) welcomed me in as one of their brothers. We all make plays together, and we’re happy being on the field.” \nWhitlock has 19 tackles, including 10 unassisted stops from his weak side cornerback position. Like his teammates, he’ll play through pain if that’s what it takes. \n“Trevor’s biggest thing wasn’t athletic ability, it was just learning the coverages,” Loughridge said. “Trevor has caught on. He’s a good tackler, which is the biggest thing, and he gives great effort.” \n“He’s determined at anything he tries,” added Jones. “I love watching him play football, because his eye is on that ball. \n“He was good at basketball, baseball and wrestling, too.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T13:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T13:08:32.109+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
