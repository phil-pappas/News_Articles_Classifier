Ravens win in overtime 1 / 2 Back to Gallery Pittsburgh\nJustin Tucker made a 52-yard field goal with 5:08 left in overtime to give the Baltimore Ravens a 23-20 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday night.\nTucker tied it with three seconds to go in regulation after Pittsburgh's Josh Scobee missed a pair of kicks in the fourth quarter that would have given the Steelers some cushion. Tucker then won it in the extra period after the Steelers failed to convert a pair of fourth downs.\nJustin Forsett ran for 150 yards for the Ravens (1-3). Joe Flacco threw a touchdown pass and did just enough late to help the Ravens end the worst start in franchise history.\nMichael Vick threw for 124 yards and a score while starting in place of injured Ben Roethlisberger .\nGiants: Coach Tom Coughlin says Victor Cruz will not play Sunday against Buffalo after aggravating a calf injury on Wednesday. Instead, the wide receiver will work with trainers. There is no timetable for his return. Cruz had said Monday he expected to practice Wednesday and play Sunday. Cruz hurt his calf in training camp in August and has not practiced with the team. He has missed the first three games of the season and has not played in an NFL game since his season-ending knee injury last Oct. 12 against the Eagles. It was his second knee injury in two seasons.\nJets: Wide receiver Eric Decker participated in some team drills for the first time since spraining his left knee nearly two weeks ago. Cornerback Darrelle Revis was limited for the second straight day with a sore hamstring. Revis said Wednesday he would be fine to play on Sunday against the Miami Dolphins in London. Running back Chris Ivory was a full participant after being limited with a strained quadriceps.\nBills: Coach Rex Ryan ruled out running back LeSean McCoy (hamstring) and receiver Sammy Watkins (calf) from playing against the New York Giants on Sunday.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/34/8726290/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/32/8726207/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/32/8726207/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/34/8726290/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-02T08:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:48:03.831+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
