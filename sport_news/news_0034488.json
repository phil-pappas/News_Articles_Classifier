It's tough to survive unscathed for too long, and managing injuries becomes a critical part of surviving the latter portion of the season. \nHeading into Week 6, plenty of big names are listed on NFL injury reports. Here are a few of the important injuries to follow. LeSean McCoy, running back, Buffalo Bills (probable, hamstring) \nIn a bit of surprise, the Bills listed running back LeSean McCoy as probable after he got in a week of limited practices on his injured hamstring. He won't be 100 percent heading into Sunday, but he's good enough to play. The Bills are going to need him, and while he's a risky option, he's also a high upside play against the Bengals. \nAdvice: Play him Sammy Watkins, wide receiver, Buffalo Bills (questionable, calf) \nAfter missing two games with a calf injury, Sammy Watkins looks ready to make his return to the lineup Sunday. He said earlier in the week that he wants to push through the injury to provide the offense with a boost. He's still a risky play, given the fact that EJ Manuel will be under center. \nAdvice: Sit him Andrew Luck, quarterback, Indianapolis Colts (questionable, shoulder) \nAndrew Luck is finally expected to return to the Colts' starting lineup despite being listed as questionable on the injury report. If he plays, it's tough not to start him. The tricky thing is, he plays on Sunday Night Football, so you're in a bit of a bind if he's a last-minute inactive. It sounds like Luck is ready to give it a go, though. \nAdvice: Play him Marsahwn Lynch, running back, Seattle Seahawks (questionable, hamstring) \nAfter missing time with a hamstring injury, Marshawn Lynch is close to full strength and listed as questionable on the injury report. The Seahawks are up against a tough Panthers defense this week, but if Lynch is close to full speed and gets a big workload, it's tough to bench him. \nAdvice: Play him Alshon Jeffery, wide receiver, Chicago Bears (questionable, hamstring) \nAlshon Jeffery may finally make his long-awaited return to the Bears' lineup. He got in a full week of limited practices on the injured hamstring that has kept him on the sideline early in the season. As long as he's in the lineup, Jeffery is worth the risk against a beatable Detroit secondary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:55:50.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
