I've said that all along. But I don't know that there's any indication that there will be an exact timeline other than the fact I'm sure it will be done before the season starts.” \nIf Diallo is indeed cleared by the NCAA, how will that affect the Jayhawks' rotation, which Self said will likely not be 10 deep? The Topeka Capital-Journal's Jesse Newell, Matt Galloway and Kevin Haskin discuss this on the latest edition of the KU HawkZone Podcast. Also discussed: Wayne Selden's playing time, the expected roles of freshmen Carlton Bragg and Lagerald Vick, and the KU football team's uncertainty at quarterback. \nMobile viewers can listen to the podcast here or via the HawkZone app. And be sure to subscribe on iTunes, Stitcher or SoundCloud for new episodes as they are posted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:16:09.342+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
