All the same elements were there Friday night, reflected in a mirror image.\nWhich meant everything was reversed, including the winning team.\nAfter failing to score a touchdown in last year's defensive slugfest, Euless Trinity ran its way to more than 600 yards of offense at Pennington Field. The Trojans needed all of it to hold off Carroll 37-35.\n\"You never know what's going to happen,\" Trinity coach Chris Jensen said of the Trinity-Carroll series. \"We've had these types of games, and we've had 10-6. This game wouldn't do well in Vegas.\"\nIt would certainly fit into the Vegas spectacle, however. And what happened at Pennington Field will certainly not just stay at Pennington Field.\nThe game was that good. As expected.\nTrinity (8-0, 4-0 in District 7-6A) rushed 53 times for 603 yards, led by the spectacular performance of senior running back Ja'Ron Wilson, who had 31 carries for 339 yards and three touchdowns.\n\"I just kept thinking, 'I've got to score,'\" Wilson said. \"I've got to make it for my team.\"\nTrinity, No. 2 in the area rankings, needed all the scores against No. 4 Carroll (5-2, 2-1). The Dragons' offense struggled in the third quarter, but broke out for 21 points in the fourth quarter. Each time Trinity made it a two-possession game in the fourth quarter, Carroll answered back quickly with touchdowns.\nBut the Dragons simply couldn't stop the combination of Trinity's offensive line and the runs of Wilson, quarterback Tyler Natee (10 rushes for 157 yards) and De'Jaun Garrett (8 rushes, 103 yards, 2 touchdowns). During a Trinity drive that bridged the third and fourth quarters, Natee - a 6-1, 239-pound senior - bulled his way to consecutive runs of 13, 16, 14, 22, 5 and 12 yards.\nHe was injured on the last run, however, and left the game for two Trinity drives. But as Carroll's scores put the pressure on Trinity, Wilson responded. With Natee on the sideline and Trinity clinging to a 24-21 lead, Wilson converted a third-and-13 with a 49-yard run around the right side. He then capped the drive with a fantastic run on another critical third down.\nIt was third-and-11 at the 16, and Wilson took off to his left. Carroll cut off the running lanes, so Wilson reversed field and headed right. When he got back to midfield, he saw some space, cut toward the end zone and ran between defenders for the touchdown.\n\"I thought the play was going to be dead,\" Wilson said, \"but I thought I've got to make something happen.\"\nCarroll scored again to pull within 37-35 with 1:46 left, and although Natee was able to return to the game, Wilson was the Trojans' closer. He ran for a pair of first downs to wipe out Carroll's timeouts and then the clock.\n\"I'm super tired,\" Wilson said with a smile after the game. \"But I've just got to keep strong for my team.\"\nTwitter: @mattwixon\nOn Twitter:\n @mattwixon", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/high-school/football/game/2015/21856?hootPostID=6f6772841a9d8a9491c5bbdcd5bd32dc", "https://twitter.com/mattwixon"], "published": "2015-10-17T07:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T09:27:57.072+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
