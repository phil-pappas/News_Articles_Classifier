MacArthur, who missed 18 games with a concussion last season and suffered a head injury in the pre-season, did not great as he walked slowly out of the building.\n“I don’t know the extent (of the injury) but it’s probably frustrating for him,” Ryan said of MacArthur, who saw just 6:05 of ice time. “It’s been what, two, with the scare in the middle, in the last nine months or so. It’s tough. You want him to get better and come back and contribute, but right now you just hope he gets healthy and gets the 100 per cent go-ahead before you risk playing anymore.”\nErik Karlsson led the Senators on their biggest offensive explosion of the season, picking up four assists. Marc Methot, Milan Michalek, Kyle Turris, Jean-Gabriel Pageau and Mike Hoffman were the other goal scores.\nCraig Anderson made 37 saves, as the Senators were outshot 40-28.\nBrandon Saad, Boone Jenner and Brandon Dubinsky replied for the now 0-4 Blue Jackets.\nFor the first part of Wednesday’s game at Nationwide Arena, the Senators looked like they were distracted. Maybe, like most Canadians, they were more interested in Blue Jays updates than the task at hand.\nBut down 3-2 in the second, they snapped to it and became the latest team to beat up on the Blue Jackets.\nThe victory improved the Senators’ record to 3-1, with all their victories on the road. The Blue Jackets remain winless after four games.\nOttawa is now 14-0-3 in its past 17 road games, dating back to last season.\n“I don’t know if we played a really good 60 minutes, but we got away with a win and a lot of goals,” said Zibanejad, who scored the winner. “We’ve got things to work on.”\nAt least now, the second unit is contributing on the scoresheet.\n“It was nice to get the first one, obviously,” said Zibanejad. “Our line got going tonight.”\nHelping might have been the long conversation Zibanejad had a with coach Dave Cameron at the morning skate.\n“It’s good to see what we talked about worked,” said the young centre. “It’s nice to be able to contribute in point situations.”\nRyan’s goal was an empty netter from the neutral zone with 4:05 left. Zibanejad passed him the puck rather than shoot it himself.\n“I was going to give it back,” said Ryan. “He was mad I waited so long to shoot it. I said at this point I’m going to skate it right into the thing if I can.\n“It was a helluva shot.”\nTrailing 2-1 to after a first period that saw them outshot 15-7, Michalek scored his second of the season on the power play to tie the game at the 1:44 mark. Ryan took the shot from the point before Michalek took a couple of whacks at the rebound to put it home.\nThree minutes later, a wide Ryan shot produced a 2-on-1 for the Blue Jackets during which Dubinsky sent a backhander through Anderson to put Columbus in front again.\nBut Mark Stone waived his magic hands twice — first by stealing a puck deep in Blue Jackets territory, then with a slick pass from behind the net — to set up Turris for his fourth of the season.\n“I just saw the replay,” said Ryan. “I heard ‘what an effin pass’ (on the bench) three or four times.\n“It’s an elite play. Elite player, elite play.”\nWith less than three minutes left in the period, Karlsson missed on a chance but retrieved the puck then fed it to Ryan, who teed up Zibanejad for a gimmie and his first of the season.\nLuck was on the Senators side through 40 minutes, as they were outshot 28-16 and saw the Blue Jackets hit three posts — Nick Foligno and David Savard in the second, Jack Johnson in the first.\n“It was a big win. Two points on the road and we keep our road record going,” said coach Dave Cameron, whose team visits the Pittsburgh Penguins Thursday. “Yeah, there was some ebbs and flows.”\nIn search of their first win, the Blue Jackets were a feisty lot from the outset, when Cam Atkinson started jawing with Mike Hoffman before the opening face-off. In outshooting the Senators 15-7, they also drew first blood.\nAlex Chiasson took a penalty with the Senators on the power play, and he watched from the box as the Blue Jackets struck first.\nAnderson had stopped the initial shot, but couldn’t get his trapper on the rebound, as Saad opened the scoring in the 12th minute. Methot was able get that one back about four minutes later, taking a slap shot from the point that deflected off Saad’s stick and past Bobrovsky.\nJust 62 seconds from the intermission, however, Jenner put the Blue Jackets in front when Anderson fumbled a puck along the back boards and didn’t get any help from Patrick Wiercioch or Zibanejad.\nMark Borowiecki tuned Gregory Campbell in a late third period fight, his first of the season.\nTwitter: @sundonib\nOttawa Senators explode for 7 against Jackets\nBy Don Brennan , Ottawa Sun First posted: Wednesday, October 14, 2015 09:54 PM EDT | Updated: Wednesday, October 14, 2015 11:10 PM EDT\n For the first part of Wednesday's game at Nationwide Arena, the Senators looked like they were distracted.
