The school's public safety office said there was no imminent danger but increased police presence on the Richmond campus. \nThursday's game moves about 30 miles north to Georgetown's Toyota Stadium, which formerly hosted training camp for the NFL's Cincinnati Bengals. The Colonels (2-2, 1-0 OVC) will try to bounce back against the Golden Eagles (2-3, 1-1) following last week's 34-27 overtime loss at Kentucky. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:48:14.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
