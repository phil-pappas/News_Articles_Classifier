He actually caught passes from Johnny Manziel during his brief time in College Station, Texas. But after helping lead the Aggies to a 29-24 win over Alabama in 2012, he disappeared for a few days and, while he eventually turned up a short time later, he left A&M for good and never played college football again.\nToday, Johnson is sitting behind bars after allegedly attacking and killing a man who was jogging at a park in Dallas on Monday. According to Dallas police, Johnson randomly attacked the jogger on the White Rock Creek Trail with a “large-edged weapon” and killed him.\n“It appears Mr. Johnson picked this victim at random. Absolutely random,” Deputy Chief Rob Sherwin told The Dallas Morning News . “He just attacked him…It’s just very unusual. It’s quite shocking.”\nSherwin added that Johnson was the one who called 911 after killing the man to report what had happened. He later admitted to killing him. The man has not yet been identified.\nJohnson is going to be charged with murder.
