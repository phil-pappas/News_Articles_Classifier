But, you know, there's still a lot that appears to be happening tomorrow night.\nHere are the spoilers from WWE Smackdown , which was taped last night in Cincinnati, Ohio.\nRoman Reigns defeated Bo Dallas after Dallas talked sh*t about him coming up short all of the time. He even makes a remark about surviving his trip to Suplex City, which is something that Roman didn't do. Post-match, Reigns said Bray Wyatt was the devil, and said the only way to to defeat him is to ride into hell. Then Bray cut a promo on Roman. Cesaro and Neville defeated King Barrett and Sheamus. â€‹ Dean Ambrose steals a candy bar from Byron Saxton. Kevin Owens defeated Zack Ryder , then Ryback (who was at ringside) to confront Owens, who slowly left the ring. Paige apologized to Natalya backstage, who said Paige had a long way to go. Dolph Ziggler defeated Rusev ; Summer Rae was guest referee, and is said to have showed favoritism to Dolph. Word is Ziggler kicked out of a slow count at 2, which infuriated Rusev. Summer Rae slaps him, which allowed Dolph to hit Rusev with the Zig Zag. Post-match, Summer says she and Ziggler have chemistry, but Dolph blows her off and leaves. Dean Ambrose and The Dudley Boyz did an interview backstage. Braun Strowman and Luke Harper defeated the Prime Time Players. Charlotte defeated Alicia Fox. The Dudley Boyz and Dean Ambrose defeated The New Day via DQ. After the match, The New Day beats up the Dudleys.
