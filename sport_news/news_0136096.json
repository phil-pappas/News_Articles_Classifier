Since Yates had previously been ejected from a game, against UNLV last season, and was in a probationary period, he was suspended an additional half, meaning he’ll miss the entire UNLV game. \nOn Saturday, Nevada was notified Yates’ hit was under review. On Sunday, it was notified the league would take action on the play. On Tuesday, the full-game suspension was announced publicly. \n“We had an opportunity to present an appeal,” coach Brian Polian said. “We did that. We appreciate the Mountain West allowing us that opportunity. There was a debate, but in the end it was denied. We don’t always see things the same way, but I respect the decision of the league. I have no issue with it.” Get to know your Wolf Pack foe: Rival UNLV \nYates, an honorable mention All-Mountain West selection in 2014, has 10 tackles, including two for a loss, and one sack this season. Yates was called for an unsportsmanlike conduct for hitting Buffalo’s Marcus McGill with a helmet-to-helmet hit after McGill had crossed the goal line for a successful 2-point conversion. McGill was down for about 5 minutes following the hit, but returned to the game. \nYates is a talented player who has had off-the-field trouble at Nevada. He has been suspended by the Wolf Pack three times (once in each of the last three seasons), including for quarter in this year’s season opener. Polian said he’s disappointed a senior doesn’t get to play in Nevada’s annual rivalry game. \n“He is a collegiate student-athlete,” said Polian, who made a statement about the suspension but didn’t take questions. “He is not a professional athlete. I’m not going to publicly berate the young man. He’s made mistakes in his career, as all young people do. Young people learn when you make mistakes there is a price to pay. He’ll pay that price and move forward from it and hopefully grow and learn from it.” \nSophomore Korey Rush is expected to replace Yates in the starting lineup, with senior Kevin McReynolds and redshirt freshman Kalei Meyer also seeing increased snaps. UNLV has averaged 238.5 rushing yards per game this season, so the subtraction of Yates in the middle of the defense is a big loss. \n“As is the case if a player goes down with an injury, he’s unavailable for the game, so next man up,” Polian said. “We can’t look back. We have to move forward and get ready to go.” \nDefensive end Lenny Jones, who is close friends with Yates, said he played for Yates after his linemate was ejected from last year’s UNLV game. Jones eventually intercepted a pass in that game and returned it for a touchdown. Jones said he’ll play against UNLV for his friend, Yates, again this season. \n“I’m going to make some big plays for him, too, and we’ll celebrate like he was there,” Jones said. \nSELLOUT CREEPS CLOSER \nNevada began the start of the business day Tuesday with a little more than 2,700 tickets remaining for the game and announced in the morning that less than 100 general-admission tickets remained. \nA limited number of student tickets will be available at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Lawlor Events Center ticket office. General admission tickets for the game start at $36 and increase up to $71. \nThe Wolf Pack has sold out seven games since 2000 (four against Boise State, two against UNLV and one against Cal). Nevada’s last sellout came last season against Boise State. \nTE MOEN OUT FOR THE SEASON \nSophomore tight end Matt Moen will miss the season with an undisclosed injury. \n“We’re going to redshirt him and we’re going to call it a non-football injury,” Polian said. “There was a time when his football future was in question but we have enough information now to know that’s not the case. But he played as a true freshman, so we’re going to go ahead and redshirt him this season.” \nSince Moen played as a true freshman last year, he’ll simply use his redshirt in 2015 and have three year of eligibility remaining. That leaves started Jarred Gipson, backup Evan Faunce, a junior-college transfer in his first year at Nevada, and Brandon Scott, a redshirt freshman, as the only scholarship tight ends on the team. Austin Carrow, a walk-on put on scholarship this season, also could see playing time. \n“Brandon Scott will enter the conversation and Faunce’s role will grow,” Polian said. “He’s competed and done a fine job, but he’s been limited to certain packages because he’s only been here a short time. And tight end is one of the most difficult, if not the most difficult, position in this offense to learn.” \nStarting linebacker Jordan Dobrich (muscle strain) is expected to return against UNLV after missing last week’s game. Starting offensive guard Adam Khouri (undisclosed injury) is questionable for UNLV. \nWOLF PACK ADDS RB COMMIT \nIsaiah Hamilton, a 5-foot-10, 180-pound running back from Sacramento, has committed to Nevada, Hamilton said in a tweet. Hamilton is the 12th known commitment to Nevada’s 2016 class. \nHamilton is listed as a two-star recruit who also had offers from Wyoming, UTEP, Sac State and Eastern Washington, according to Rivals.com. He reportedly has a 4.66-second 40-yard time. \nPlaying for Vanden High in Fairfield last season, Hamilton rushed for 1,158 yards and 18 touchdowns. He also caught 17 passes for 147 yards and two scores. As a sophomore, Hamilton rushed for 1,087 yards and 17 touchdowns. The Wolf Pack loses starting running back, Don Jackson, to graduation this summer. \nWOLF PACK FOOTBALL \nWho: UNLV (1-3) at Nevada (2-2) \nWhen: Saturday, 4 p.m. \nWhere: Mackay Stadium (capacity, 30,000) \nTV/Radio: None/94.5 FM \nBetting line: Nevada favored by 7; total is 57.5 \nWeather: High of 78; low of 44 11 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.rgj.com/1FBrX9J TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T23:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:43:28.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
