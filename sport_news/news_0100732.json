A survey of 25 Division I conferences showed little support for the clock, which the Division I Baseball Committee had recommended using throughout the 2016 tournament. \nThe average length of nine-inning games in the College World Series increased from 2 hours, 53 minutes in 2012 to 3 hours, 19 minutes in 2015. Game lengths also increased in regionals and super regionals last year. \nMajor League Baseball this year installed clocks to time between-innings breaks and pitching changes. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T00:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:12:17.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
