Police say a shooting at the gathering killed one person and injured four others. By The Associated Press FORT MYERS, Fla. | Police say a shooting at the annual ZombiCon gathering in Florida has left one person dead and four more injured, causing a chaotic scene that sent throngs of zombie-dressed revelers running through the streets.\nThe shooting happened around 11:45 p.m. Saturday night and authorities quickly cleared out crowded nearby bars and set up crime scene tape, while others patrolled the area with rifles searching for a suspect.\nFort Myers Police Lt. Victor Medico said four people had injuries that were not life threatening. The fifth victim died at the scene, but no other details were released.\n\"There were a lot of witnesses down here, there were a lot of people taking pictures, videos with their cellphone,\" Medico told the News-Press ( http://newspr.es/1jMJamf ). \"Anything that could help with this investigation would be greatly appreciated.\"\nPolice did not immediately return email and phone call messages seeking comment.\nThe annual festival had been expected to draw more than 20,000 fans dressed as zombies, the newspaper said. Medico said the scene was described as \"shoulder to shoulder.\"\nA statement on the ZombiCon Facebook page said organizers were saddened by the news and the group takes the safety of its patrons very seriously.\nZombiCon has been a popular event for nearly a decade, but some local residents and business owners have not welcomed the crowd of costumed revelers in the street dressed as limping, bloated, degrading corpses. Restaurant posted signs on its doors, warning visitors Zombicon participants were not welcome.\n\"Quarantined. No Zombies allowed,\" the signs read.\nSeveral members from a religious group also picketed the event this weekend.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/ZombiCon.jpg", "http://newspr.es/1jMJamf", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/ZombiCon.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-18T20:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:17:39.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
