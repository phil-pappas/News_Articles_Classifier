Though Beckham was able to return to the field for the final few plays – he drew a key pass interference penalty – a new hamstring situation does not bode well for the Giants as they take a three-game winning streak into Monday night’s NFC East clash with the Eagles (2-3) at Lincoln Financial Field.\n“Well, it’s day-to-day with the trainers,’’ Tom Coughlin said Wednesday on a conference call with Philadelphia-area media. “They seem to think he’s making good progress. All we can do it hold onto the fact he’s a competitive young man and, if at all possible, he’ll be ready to play.’’\nCoughlin added he hopes to get “some work in’’ for Beckham later in the week. The Giants will practice Thursday, Friday and Saturday.\nBeckham was having a big game against the 49ers and caught a touchdown pass late in the third quarter to put the Giants ahead 20-13. There was speculation Beckham might have tweaked his hamstring during his celebration gyrations. He said he felt it a few plays before that.\nRueben Randle also came out of the 49ers game with a hamstring issue and his status for the week is unknown.\nVictor Cruz will not play against the Eagles and probably will not be ready to make his 2015 debut for several more weeks. Coughlin said Cruz has not been cleared to return to practice.\n“He’s rehabbing, working indoors primarily working with trainers,’’ Coughlin said. “He’s in every meeting, however he has not been cleared to begin on the field.’’\nCruz felt he was all set to play leading up to the fourth game of the season, in Buffalo, but he re-injured his left calf Sept. 30 , unable to make it out of individual drills in his first practice.\n  Filed under new york giants ,  odell beckham jr. ,  victor cruz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T16:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T23:04:59.864+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
