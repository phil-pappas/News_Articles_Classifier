The lengthy semifinal matches also forced the final to move to today. \nNorth Pocono battled Wyoming Seminary in the last of Tuesday’s semifinals. \nIn the lone singles win for North Pocono, Annika Treitz defeated Abbey Capin, 6-3, 6-2, to get the team started. \nThe Lady Trojans then swept the doubles matches as Brooke Panek-Haley Zernek defeated Megha Sarada-Emily Laurore, 6-3, 6-4, and Morgan Carney-Aurora Monacelli beat Megna Melkote-Kelsey Kayton, 7-5, 6-4. \n“It was an amazing feeling, because I get really upset sometimes in a match,” Treitz said. “I just did what my coach has been telling me to do since I started playing when I was 7 years old. \n“It clicked. I moved my feet and was hitting all of my angles. I stayed focused and paced myself.” \nScranton Prep is back in the final in search of its seventh straight team title. \nEmily Jonsson, the reigning District 2 Class AA singles champion, defeated Cali Craig, 6-0, 6-0, and Maansi Malhotra beat Alyssa Santarelli, 6-1, 6-0, and the Classics, who reached the PIAA Class AA final last season, clinched the win at No. 1 doubles as Tatiana Klacko-Mira Patel defeated Gabriella Barber-Courtney Mackrell, 6-1, 6-0. \n“I am so excited, because this is my senior year,” Patel said. “This was definitely the best that we all played so far this season.” \nClass AAA \nHazleton Area won the coin toss for the No. 1 seed, held before the teams took the court. \nBut, it was Wallenpaupack that seized its opportunity. \nIrene Gendelman gave the Lady Buckhorns the early advantage by staying unbeaten at No. 3 singles by defeating Sofia Losen, 6-3, 6-2. \nWallenpaupack clinched the victory with a pair of wins in doubles. Kristen Denniston-Phoebe Cykosky defeated Jessica Wenner-Adrianna Bohman, 6-0, 6-2, and Gina Nolan-Heidi Washburn set off the celebration after a grueling win over Sayaka Ishibashi-Kimberly Delregno, 5-7, 6-2, 6-4. \n“We started off kind of rough, but we finished tough,” Washburn said. \n“We fixed our mistakes, that was the key,” Nolan said. “Once, we settled in, we did pretty good.” \nAbington Heights advances to the final where it will be seeking its sixth straight title. \nLauren Carroll gave the Lady Comets a win at No. 3 singles, beating Alisha Chen, 6-0, 6-1. \n“I am just honored to play in districts, because last year, I wasn’t a starter,” Carroll said. “I went in and was really nervous, so I just tried to shake it off and play my game.” \nThe Lady Comets sealed the victory with a pair of straight-sets wins in doubles. \nCaroline Hickman-Catherine Pusateri beat Kathleen Kinley-Kelly Hoffman, 6-1, 6-4, while Ajna Prahalad-Rachel Muir beat Madison Helier-Christine McFadden, 6-1, 6-1, to hand the Millionaires their first loss of the season. \nContact the writer:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:34:19.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
