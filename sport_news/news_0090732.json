That proved tricky, as Datisa's assets had been frozen by the Department of Justice. Defending 2015 Copa America champion Chile will be one of 10 teams representing CONMEBOL at the Centenario. \nLast week, CONCACAF announced that it had reacquired its marketing rights for the tournament from Datisa , thus smoothing the way for the tournament to be held. \nCONMEBOL, CONCACAF, and the USSF also announced the formation of a new executive committee to govern the event. It will be comprised of five members, two from CONMEBOL, two from CONCACAF, and one from the USSF. The intent is to provide even greater financial transparency regarding funds collected for broadcasting and sponsorships. \nThe 16-nation tournament, to be played from June 3-26, 2016, will feature all 10 national teams from South America and six from CONCACAF, including the United States, Mexico, Costa Rica and Jamaica. \nThe areas that expressed interest to host were Atlanta; Baltimore; Boston; Chicago; Cleveland; Dallas; Denver; Detroit; Houston; Indianapolis; Jacksonville, Florida; Kansas City, Missouri; Los Angeles; Nashville, Tennessee; New York/New Jersey; Orlando, Florida; Philadelphia; Phoenix; St. Louis; San Diego; San Francisco; Seattle; Tampa, Florida; and Washington, D.C. \nOrganizers are in the process of selecting from the list of host cities and venues. However, sources told ESPN that the final will be played at the Rose Bowl, in Pasadena, California, and one of the semifinals will be held at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. \nIn a joint statement, CONCACAF and CONMEBOL said: \"We are extremely happy for our fans, our teams and our partners, that we were able to find a way to host the Copa America Centenario celebration in the United States under an entirely new structure for managing the tournament's operations and finances. The improved governance structure will bring greater accountability and transparency to the event so it can serve its two intended purposes - to celebrate the 100 years of history of Copa America, and provide a once in a lifetime spectacle for fans in the CONCACAF and CONMEBOL regions.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:52:58.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
