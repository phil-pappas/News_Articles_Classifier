BLOOMFIELD — Sometimes the scoreline doesn’t really say much about the game. While Honeoye did indeed dominate Bloomfield in their 25-8, 25-7, 25-12 win on Wednesday, the match was hardly a failure for the Bombers, as they successfully put on their first Dig Pink event, a game dedicated to raising awareness and funds for breast cancer treatment, in partnership with the Side-Out Foundation. “Almost every girl on the team has someone in their life that has been affected by breast cancer,” said Bloomfield head coach Laura Edwards. “The girls really took over with it.” It didn’t take long to realize the extent to which the team had prepared for the event, with signs and decorations adorning the hallways leading up to the gym, which was a room filled with energy from the crowd, the players, and of course, the bright pink everywhere. “We’ve been planning it for quite a while now,” said senior co-captain Maria Matuck. The event was not only meaningful for the home team, however. “We’ve had so many staff [members] at Honeoye that have been affected by breast cancer,” said head coach Alana Graziano, adding they will be holding a similar event at their home game this Friday. “It’s a great event, and I’m really glad we got to participate in it with Bloomfield.” The excitement about the event was not limited to the two teams. The Bloomfield community clearly came together in support of the day, with local businesses donating goods to be raffled off and hundreds of people attending the game, creating a tremendous atmosphere and helping to raise a total of $570. “It feels good to know that all these people came to support not only us, but breast cancer [treatment] too,” said Matuck. “They all donated and contributed just by coming.” The actual match was a lopsided affair, with Honeoye pulling away midway through the opening game and never looking back, led by senior Hailey Cornish, who had 7 aces, 16 assists, and 2 blocks. Junior Lydia Barnard had a game-high 13 kills, while senior Margaret Slocum set the high mark with 8 digs. “I think the girls played phenomenal tonight,” said Graziano. “They really came together as a team, they were all lifting each other up, encouraging each other.” Perhaps the biggest difference between the teams was their demeanors. Honeoye never got too high or low on themselves, whereas Bloomfield struggled to bounce back in the points following an error. “We definitely let the mistakes get to us, which is something we really need to work on as a team” said junior co-captain Sierra Leitten. Page 2 of 2 - The Bombers’ top performer was Ruby Close, who finished with 6 digs, 2 kills, and 1 ace. Despite the humble statsheet, Edwards was still pleased that her team had fewer errors than when they last faced Honeoye in September. “It was a step in the right direction,” she said. “Even if it wasn’t the result we wanted.” Edwards’ was not the only one who had a positive outlook after the match. It was hard not to see the pride the team had after putting on the event, especially from the two captains, who were clearly on the same page about the night, to the point of Matuck finishing her co-captain’s sentences. “Even if we didn’t get a win out of it...,” began Leitten, “...it still feels good.” By Ben Shapiro", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:34:57.529+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
