One victim was shot while trying to fight off the intruders. The injuries were not life threatening, according to police. The 16-year-old suspect was also shot. Police later found him in northeast Salem and took him to Salem Hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.\nFollowing an investigation, Salem Police detectives served three search warrants and arrested the four suspects Oct. 16 on charges of burglary, assault, unlawful use of a weapon and five counts of robbery.\nWhile the investigation is still ongoing, police believe the robbery to be narcotics related. The identities of the victims are not being released.\n— Nuran Alteir\nnalteir@oregonian.com\n503-294-4028\n@whatnuransaid", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/whatnuransaid"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:14:55.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
