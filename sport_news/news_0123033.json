He made his season debut in last weekend's 42-17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals , but aggravated the injury in the first half and left after just 17 snaps.\nJosh Bynes, who started the first four games in Levy's place, will start Sunday against the Chicago Bears (1 p.m., Fox).\n\"Anytime you have a guy that plays as well as he plays consistently, with the kind of experience that he has, obviously, you lose that for a period of time, and he's been out for quite some time at this stage,\" Caldwell said. \"Very, very integral part of what we do, but we do have some capable guys, obviously. And ... one of the things we did this year is we were a little bit heavy, in terms of the numbers that we typically keep at that spot, because of the fact that, early on in the season, he was having some difficulty. So our numbers should be there, and we anticipate getting the kind of production that we expect out of that spot, as well.\"\nCaldwell said no determination has been made on whether Levy will go on season-ending injured reserve.\n\"Every surgery's unique and every individual's unique, so it may take us some time to kind of sort that out,\" Caldwell said.\nOne option that isn't available for the Lions is injured reserve with a designation to return. The Lions used their lone short-term IR spot on rookie cornerback Alex Carter before the season.\nCarter, a third-round pick out of Stanford, missed most of training camp with a high ankle sprain and bone bruise. He said today that he expects to start practicing Monday, the first day he's eligible to return to the field. But he's not expected to be more than a role player on defense this year.\nThe Lions decided not to use their short-term IR designation on Levy in August because they did not think he'd require surgery.\nCaldwell said that changed after Levy's setback Sunday.\n\"The doctors took a look at it and, not only ours inside but then outside, as well, in our training staff,\" Caldwell said. \"Those individuals looked at it and made a determination that the best course of action was the one that we took.\"\nThe Lions signed Levy to a four-year, $33.7-million extension this spring that, at the time, made him the highest-paid 4-3 outside linebacker in the NFL.\nCaldwell said he won't second-guess the decision not to have Levy undergo surgery earlier this year, and he said that the Lions did not rush their star linebacker back.\n\"That may be your angle or someone else's, but just in terms of professional opinions, I think those are the ones that count, to be honest with you,\" Caldwell said.\nNote: The Pro Football Hall of Fame will honor three Lions Hall of Famers -- cornerback Lem Barney, running back Barry Sanders and linebacker Joe Schmidt -- with a new Hall of Fame \"ring of excellence\" at halftime Sunday.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nJamie: Time for Lions to move on from Martin Mayhew\nContact Dave Birkett at dbirkett@freepress.com.
