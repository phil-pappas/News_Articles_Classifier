Japanese knotwood lives up to 'killer bamboo' nickname Japanese knotwood lives up to 'killer bamboo' nickname By Don Dreyer For The Times Timesonline.com | 0 comments \nFor regular readers of “Over the Garden Gate,” you know myriad subjects have been covered. But one theme we keep coming back to is the importance of native plants and the advantages they have over non-native plants that might be invasive and cause other problems. \nThat said, today’s column is about one of western Pennsylvania’s bad guys -- the highly invasive, non-native Japanese knotweed. Its botanical name is Fallopia japonica. Often called \"killer bamboo,\" it has the common names fleeceflower, Mexican bamboo and huzhang, among others. \nThis diversity of nomenclature supports its notoriety as an invasive. It is nasty under a variety of names. The World Conservation Congress lists it as among the world’s worst invasive species. Some local beekeepers encourage it because bees love it and make “red bamboo honey.” \nAs is so often the case, in the late 1800s, this Asian native was intentionally introduced into the United States as an ornamental. Japanese knotweed plants were first introduced from Japan into the United Kingdom, then into North America. \nI’m sure you have seen it along highways, railroads and other disturbed areas all over the region. It is a rather attractive plant with white flowers, reaching heights of 10 feet and probably the kind of plant that many people would enjoy seeing (remember it was introduced as an ornamental plant). \nBut have you noticed that where Japanese knotweed grows, native plants of a similar size or smaller are not usually present? One road I travel frequently is Steffin Hill Road (Route 588) between Darlington Road in Chippewa Township and Beaver Falls. The road has areas that are Japanese knotweed jungles. I use this location as an example, but it is by no means unusual in the area. \nA common habitat for Japanese knotweed is sunny, moist areas, including riverbanks, roadsides and, yes, your lawn and garden. Japanese knotweed is often spread via fill dirt: all it takes is one fragment of one root, submerged within a pile of dirt dumped onto an unsuspecting yard. \nIt is also most invasive in areas that were already disturbed for other reasons such as construction or lawn preparation. Thankfully, it is not as prone to invade wooded, undisturbed areas. \nWhile Japanese knotweed easily establishes and spreads, it is difficult to control. Control is complicated by the fact that it often occurs on public right of way, such as roads, railroad beds and commercial construction sites. Since it is not just a garden weed, control must involve a degree of political and business community will, knowledge, expense and awareness of its invasiveness and the problems it causes. \nIt is such a strong-growing plant that it can and will grow through minor cracks in paved surfaces. When describing it, the Japanese use the term itadori, which means \"strong plant.\" \nControlling Japanese knotweed is probably a more apt term than eliminating Japanese knotweed. The first tool you are going to need is persistence. It does not succumb easily. A first step is to cover the plants in the spring with heavy plastic or poly tarps. Before the tarps are placed, make sure the old canes are cut off so that the tarps are not punctured by the old growth. \nLarger-sized tarps will help you cover areas more easily. Make sure the tarps overlap and that all edges are weighted down. Covering the plants and depriving them of light will not kill the plants outright, but it will weaken them. The plants will push into the tarps with softer new growth, but since the tarps are flexible, the plants cannot break through as they would on a paved surface. If you do not like the appearance and time the tarps require, you could cover the tarps with mulch and use potted plants until you are ready for the next control step. \nThe weed killer recommended for use against Japanese knotweed is glyphosate. Trade names for weedkillers containing glyphosate include Roundup, Gallup, Landmaster, Pondmaster, Ranger, Rodeo, and Touchdown. The weedkiller should be sprayed onto the plants, preferably in late summer or early fall. \nYou can follow these treatments with cutting the remaining plants back to reduce photosynthesis. Cutting the plants back is very laborious and time-consuming and may lack effectiveness. While extension services do not typically recommend the use of herbicides, in this case, it is probably necessary to keep treating persistent plant regrowth. Unfortunately, all of this is not a one-season solution. Some or all of these steps might need to be repeated until control is achieved. \nDon Dreyer is a Master Gardener with Penn State Extension-Beaver County. \nReferences: USDA National Agricultural Library; Invasive Plant Atlas of the United States; Non-native Invasive Freshwater Plants; USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:56:59.856+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
