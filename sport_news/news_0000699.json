(Photo: Daniel Mears, Detroit News) \nAllen Park — After missing every practice in September, star linebacker DeAndre Levy finally made his return for the Lions on Thursday.\nLevy said he suffered his hip injury in practice on Aug. 24, and after missing the Lions’ last two exhibitions and first three regular-season games, there’s a chance he’ll make his debut Monday night in Seattle.\n“Obviously, he’s an outstanding player,” coach Jim Caldwell said of Levy before practice Thursday. “Anytime you get a guy back with his kind of experience and those kinds of things, it’s going to help — there’s no question.”\nNow, the question at hand is how Levy’s body responds to the work he does in practice. He said last week that effects of this injury could linger, but if he doesn’t suffer any setbacks, he should be on track to play against the Seahawks.\nWhile Levy made his return, the Lions lost a couple other starters in the first practice of the week. Defensive end Ziggy Ansah, who suffered a groin injury Sunday, and running back Joique Bell were out. Tight end Brandon Pettigrew was also out and hasn’t practice since suffering a hamstring injury in Week 1.\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T22:45:34.496+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
