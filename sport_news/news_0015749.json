Incidentally, Malhotra had headed the council then.\nAAI sources confirmed Malhotra had resigned but said a final decision on it as well as the way forward would be taken once the veteran administrator takes over as AICS chairman. \"We haven't received any official communique about Mr Malhotra taking over as AICS chairman. Once that happens, we will seek our members' opinions before charting our course,\" the sources told TOI.\nMalhotra's exit will mean AAI seek recognition from the sports ministry. The body was derecognised in 2012 after Malhotra was re-elected as its president in contravention to the age and tenure guidelines of the sports code. The guidelines prescribe an age cap of 70 and only three consecutive terms of four years each for an NSF's president.
