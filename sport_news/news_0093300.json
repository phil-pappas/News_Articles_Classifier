Donovan has stepped down as the head coach of The Connecticut Sun after three losing seasons. (Jessica Hill / Associated Press) Anne Donovan resigns after three bad seasons; Sun looking for a new coach \nIt was a bad hire. \nIt was a clumsy resignation. \nIn between, the Connecticut Sun won 38 games, lost 64 and were the only WNBA team during her tenure to miss the playoffs all three seasons. \nOther than that, how did you enjoy the slot machines, Mrs. Lincoln? \nAs a player, 6-foot-8 Anne Donovan, recently inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame, was one of the best centers ever. As coach of the state's major league women's basketball team, Donovan leaves as 80 inches of failure. (JOHN ALTAVILLA) \nFirst, as a failure to meet expectations. \nAnd, ultimately, as a failure to sufficiently win the players' confidence to bring what she was trying to build to fruition. \nThe Sun never should have fired Mike Thibault. It was a mistake in November 2012. It remains a mistake in 2015. That one is on Sun CEO Mitchell Etess. That one is on general manager Chris Sienko. \nSome who cover the team nailed it as a 100 percent blunder from the beginning. I took a slightly different angle. While Thibault is unquestionably one of the best women's coaches around and a truly decent man, my conclusion was that there's an intangible, sometimes slight difference between winning big and winning it all. After a decade at the casino, Thibault, now coaching the Washington Mystics, had done plenty of the former yet had not won a WNBA championship. Those who run the Sun exercised their right to put everything on the line for a title. They just had to be right. \nThe decision to make a change on Thibault, in my mind at that time, was like the Yankees removing Buck Showalter in favor of Joe Torre in October 1995. Showalter is an excellent baseball man, but Torre — hired to decidedly lukewarm reviews — won four World Series. \n\"Our objective is to win championships,\" Sienko said at the January 2013 press conference to announce Donovan's hiring. \"Anne knows that. It has been made very clear.\" \nIn other words, the casino team executives bet on Donovan and it is clear they lost big. Anne Donovan is no Joe Torre. She's no Mike Thibault either. \n\"We don't regret having made that move [to replace Thibault],\" Etess said Thursday. \"We don't second guess our decision. We went out and got a proven coach who had won a gold medal and WNBA championship. Clearly, the results haven't panned out.\" \nDonovan won the WNBA title with Seattle in 2004. Donovan, with Thibault's assistance, won the Olympic gold medal in Beijing in 2008. The Sun were considered a championship contender in 2013 and jumping the tracks from a 25-9 team in Thibault's final season to a 10-24 disaster under Donovan was a spectacular train wreck. \nSome players quit on Donovan. Some came up lame. Tina Charles, one of the top half-dozen players in the world and a Thibault favorite, bailed on Donovan and then bailed on the franchise. \nDonovan is no magnetic personality and she was no bet in June 2015 to be back in June 2016. Players are not quick to hug her. Officials are not quick to run in the other direction after a bad call. Yet even as Katie Douglas, Chiney Ogwumike, Allison Hightower, Kelsey Griffin, Danielle McCray had gone down with injuries before the opener, the Sun stood as the league's early surprise at 7-1. The players talked about seeing a different Donovan. \n\"She laughs more, she smiles more. She even cusses us out a little more,\" Kelsey Bone said as the Sun, despite all the injuries, got off to a hot start. \"She came into the locker room after the game the other day so excited. She told the starters we have tomorrow off. I wanted to check her temperature. I was like, 'Who is this person?'\" \nAs Elizabeth Williams, Alyssa Thomas and Alex Bentley all went out with injuries, the losses did mount to a 15-19 finish. Yet the Sun never quit. They played hard. \n\"The players did not give up on her, which I think is really important,\" Sienko said at the home finale. \"Anne has had bad luck from Day 1, with people wanting to leave, people not playing, we've had injuries every single season. It's not like we've had a chance to be healthy and see what could happen. You take a 15-19 record, with all the injuries, all the close games, she did a really good job.\" \nAdded Etess that day at Mohegan Sun Arena: \"In spite of all those injuries, there were very few games we weren't in. They continued to play hard. I think she has done a great job with this team.\" \nDonovan sometimes seemed to walk around with a dark cloud hovering over her 6-foot-8 frame. Yet after being dealt a ton of lousy cards her first three years, she was overdue to get some aces in 2016. The Sun have a ton of young talent. Donovan knew the landscape. She was building with players she wanted. She had the experience. All this pointed to a return for at least one more year to harvest the youth's growth. \nImmediately at the end of the regular season, Donovan went to Europe for the FIBA induction, the Sun brass met first with the players individually and then with Donovan in the annual follow-up meetings. Something happened. Something most definitely happened to change the narrative. \n\"We reviewed the season, talked about the entirety of her time here,\" Sienko said. \"We talked about some goals and objectives for next year. We asked Anne to come back and visit with us this week.\" \n\"We never frankly got to the point to making that decision [whether she would return],\" Etess said. \"We talked about what we thought needed to happen and what the outcome needed to be next year and some things we thought needed to be different. We talked about coming back up and let's talk about what you think you'll do and give us a plan.\" \nInstead, Donovan called Sienko back and told him she was resigning. After a less-than-rousing postseason meeting, it can't be considered a shock she resigned. \n\"I guess we were surprised she didn't get back to us and give us a plan,\" Etess said. \"Maybe she sensed something that none of us know.\" \n\"It's not easy walking away from a team that I put my heart and soul into, but I think it is in my best interest to move on at this time,\" Donovan said in a statement. \"I will miss the ladies and the passion of the Sun fans. I was proud to serve as their head coach.\" \nYou really have to wonder if that communication gap between Donovan and the players hadn't widened again. You looked at the team playing hard through injuries and maybe it turns out they weren't playing hard for her. Written off early, maybe were playing for themselves. There is some talk players had lost confidence in her coaching. If she lost the team and didn't realize she had, maybe Donovan had no real plan on how she could win them back. \nIf that's the case, now is time to move on. \nSienko said the Sun need to see what candidates are available. He wouldn't narrow a list to the \"silo\" of coaches only with WNBA ties. A few possibilities? Both Donovan's assistants Steve Key and Jennifer Gillom have been WNBA head coaches. If the Sun want to go young, Liberty assistant coach Katie Smith or even Becky Hammon (although that would seem like a long shot given her NBA pursuits) are intriguing names. \nAt any rate, it's time to bring in somebody who can communicate, who can look the players in the eye and they will absolutely respect. Minnesota coach Cheryl Reeve learned something about winning WNBA championships under Bill Laimbeer. Lynx assistant Jim Peterson, who played eight years in the NBA, has learned something about winning WNBA championships with Reeve. Maybe the 6-10 Peterson, known as the Ivory Tower as a player, is the right guy for the gaming tower built in Eastern Connecticut. \n\"We've got a lot of talent,\" Etess said. \"I'm sure we'll have a lot of interest in the position and move ahead and get that championship.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:46:46.254+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
