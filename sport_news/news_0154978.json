Manan Vohra (5) and Jiwanjot Singh (31) got out with Punjab's scorecard reading 57/2 but that was the last success for the Railways as Mandeep scored a ton off 196 balls with 14 boundaries. Kaul's innings (92) was a dogged effort as he hit only nine boundaries en route his 245-ball unbeaten vigil. Skipper Yuvraj Singh is yet to come out to bat. For Railways, Arnab Nandi was the only successful bowler (1/55). India discard Karn Sharma went wicketless in 21 overs. Sehwag sizzles with 92\nPune: Virender Sehwag started the Ranji Trophy season for Haryana in right earnest as his sparkling 92 set the foundation for a decent score of 303/6 against the hosts Maharashtra. Only 19 days shy of his 37th birthday, Sehwag showed glimpses of his vintage self, with his 92 off 129 balls that had 15 well-timed boundaries. He added 124 runs for the third wicket with centurion Himanshu Rana, who dropped anchor, scoring an unbeaten 138 off 236 balls that comprised 20 boundaries. The Haryana captain came at the start of the second over, and by the ninth over, the visitors were reeling at 32/3 with Rahul Dewan (6), Chaitanya Bishnoi (4) and Sachin Rana (7) back in the hut. J&K get off to a controversial start Srinagar: Vice-captain Parvez Rasool and senior batsman Bandeep Singh scored half-centuries as Jammu and Kashmir reached 247/7 against Kerala on a controversy-hit opening day of their Ranji Trophy Group C match. There was a lot of confusion as the two warring factions of the Jammu and Kashmir Cricket Association (JKCA) named two separate squads with former Delhi player Mithun Manhas being named captain in one, while the other team named Rasool as their captain. In the end, the Manhas-led team took the field with Rasool as his deputy.
