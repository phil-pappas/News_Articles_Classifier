For several reasons, senior quarterback Mike Bercovici has taken every snap, which has forced Wilkins, a redshirt freshman, to continue his development in other ways.\n\"Not frustrating at all,'' Wilkins said after Thursday's practice. \"I think the team is doing some great things. As long as we're winning games, man, that's all we need to do. Berc's the starting quarterback for a reason. He's a leader of this football team for a reason. We have complete faith in him. This is his offense.\"\nAZCENTRAL\nASU XTRA app: Get latest news, analysis, scores, photos\nThrough five weeks, ASU is the only Pac-12 school to use just one quarterback this year. In previous seasons, the Sun Devils have gotten the backup mop-up duty during early season blowouts. This season, however, with a front-loaded schedule and the offense struggling to find a rhythm, that was not a luxury. Even against lower-division Cal Poly, the Sun Devils didn't pull away until late in the fourth quarter. Against New Mexico, they led just 10-0 early in the third quarter.\nThis has forced Wilkins to prepare in other areas. At practice, he runs ASU's second-team offense. On game days, he warms up as if he's the starter. At timeouts, he throws the football with freshman Brady White to stay loose in case he's needed.\n\"I'm really proud of Manny,'' offensive coordinator Mike Norvell said. \"He's done a great job in meetings. His awareness and overall understanding of the offense is really improving. ... You just have to watch our sideline, he's probably the guy -- next to me -- doing the most jumping. He's very excitable. Talking with Berc and making sure we're always on the same page with what we're seeing. Like I tell Manny, he's one play away, he's got to be prepared, and I really like that he's making the most of his opportunities in practice and in preparation.\"\nAZCENTRAL\nASU practice report for Thursday: Tracking D.J. Foster\nDespite the lack of experience, Wilkins remains confident. He knows this is Bercovici's team. He also knows anything can happen.\n\"When my number is called, I'll be ready,'' he said.\nStrange homecoming\nFormer Arizona State player Jim Jeffcoat waves during the Ring of Honor ceremony at halftime at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe on Oct. 18, 2012. (Photo: Rob Schumacher/azcentral sports)\nJim Jeffcoat admits: Returning to Sun Devil Stadium is always different.\nThe Colorado defensive line coach -- in his third season -- starred for the Sun Devils from 1979-1982. Playing for former ASU coaches Frank Kush and Darryl Rogers , he was a 1982 All-Pac-10 selection at defensive end.\nToday, Jeffcoat -- who played 15 years in the NFL, most with the Dallas Cowboys -- is in ASU's athletics hall of fame and one of 22 players in the program's Ring of Honor.\n\"It's a little unique,\" Jeffcoat said in a phone interview. \"It brings back a lot of great memories. There are a lot of great people I know still in the area. Obviously, that place holds a very special place in my heart.\"\nAZCENTRAL\nRich Rodriguez 28th, Todd Graham 33rd on list of highest-paid college football head coaches\nThe Buffaloes still are a program in transition, but they're making progress. After finishing 2-10 last season (0-9 Pac-12), they enter Saturday's contest at 3-2 and 0-1 in conference play. Last week in Boulder, they trailed Oregon just 31-24 early in the fourth quarter before falling 41-24.\n\"We're working on it and making sure we're taking one step at a time -- just keep on improving,'' Jeffcoat said. \"We're building confidence in our players and making sure they understand what is expected of them and what they expect from us.\"\nTacking Ballage\nBy now, a lot of college football fans around the country have seen Kalen Ballage 's 23-yard touchdown run that sealed ASU's win over UCLA. It's been all over social media and on television highlight shows.\nColorado coach Mike MacIntyre saw it, too. His reaction: \"I don't know how we're going to take down Kalen Ballage when 22 guys can't tackle him from 30 yards out,'' he told reporters this week. \"We have to figure out how to do that.\"\nContact Doug Haller at 602-444-4949 or at doug.haller@arizonarepublic.com.
