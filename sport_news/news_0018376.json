Helmets were flying. Flags were flying, but in the end, Live Oak came out on top. \n“This was the most physical game we’ve had this year,” said lineman Anthony Ditta, who was involved on some big stops late in the game. “Other teams get kind of tired toward the end of the game, but (Santa Teresa) stuck in the whole game.” \nThe Acorns defeated Santa Teresa 24-13 to stay perfect on the season, improving to 6-0 overall and 3-0 in Mt. Hamilton Division play on Hall of Fame night. \nLive Oak may have not reached the 42 threshold of the five previous games, but coach Mike Gemo was pleased his boys stood tall when not everything was working right. \n“It proves we can play close games and we stay in it. I wish we had done a little better, but we’ll fix it,” Gemo said. \nAnd it all came down to two big conversions. \nLive Oak had just held on fourth down deep in its own territory and moved the ball passed midfield. \nThe Acorns got down to the Saints’ 35 on a Jacob Ryder 15-yard run, but then were hit with two flags that pushed them back. \nA holding call and a false start brought Live Oak back to its own 47 and gave the Acorns a first and 28 situation. \nA Christian Guary run, two Mitch Conforti passes and a Ryder carry later, Live Oak made up those yards and converted on fourth down, pushing the ball to the Saints’ 15. \n“That was a game changer right there. That was the game right there,” Ditta said. \nThen a second holding call pushed the ball back to the 29. Live Oak had the ball on the Santa Teresa 30 facing third and 25 when Erik Ornduff found Zach Heffernan wide open near the goal line. \nHeffernan pulled down a high pass and was brought down inches shy of scoring. \n“It’s nothing you plan to be in, it’s nothing you draw a play that you are going to get 28 yards. You know what, Zach ran a good route and got himself open and Erik made a good throw. \nBut Live Oak gave it to its breakout back in Ryder and he put Live Oak up 21-7 in the fourth quarter and stole the wind from the Saints’ sails. \nOrnduff finished 12 of 17 passing for 171 yards and a touchdown. \nOrnduff had as much time as he needed on most pass plays, never getting hit when he dropped back. He gave credit to the front five who blocked well the whole night. \n“Passing I don’t think I got pressured once. I had a lot of time. We had some good runs. Some of them didn’t get blocked, but we’ll work on that,” Ornduff said. \nHeffernan caught two passes for 88 yards and a touchdown. \nThe good plays were impressive, but Gemo said they were situations the team should never have been in. \n“We put ourselves in some bad situations tonight,” Gemo said. “We were able to get out of it, but we can’t put ourselves in bad situations like that anymore. We’re going to have work on it this week for Oak Grove.” \nRyder had 56 yards on nine carries and a score. \nSanta Teresa and Live were locked in a close battle for most of the game until those two conversions. \nThe two teams were tied 7-7 after the first quarter and Live Oak held a 14-7 lead at halftime and through all of the third quarter. \nIn fact, after Live Oak took the lead early in the second, it would be the equivalent of two full quarters before the Acorns got on the board again. \nThe Acorns came out swinging, going 80 yards on their opening drive thanks to a big run from Conforti and a big pass play from Ornduff to Isaac Prickert which set up Live Oak on the Santa Teresa 1. \nOrnduff took it the rest of the way for a quick 7-0 lead. \nThe Saints got moving on their ensuing possession, pushing up to the Live Oak 32 where the drive staled. \nEugene Nfon had a sack and Joseph Avendano blew up a reverse play while lying on the ground and Santa Teresa was forced to punt from the Live Oak 44. \nBut after the Acorns were pinned back, the Saints got the ball back at midfield, and drove the 50 yards on five plays with Michael Laahs going the final three yards. \nLaahs had a game-leading 123 yards and two touchdowns. \nThat tied the game 7-7 with 52 seconds left in the first quarter, but Live Oak didn’t have to wait long for an answer. \nOrnduff hit Heffernan for a 59-yard touchdown pass early in the second quarter for the 14-7 lead. \nFrom then, both defenses clamped down. \nEach side crossed midfield just once until Live Oak’s scoring drive that started late in the third quarter. \nMeanwhile, Santa Teresa turned the ball over on downs twice, including once on a fake punt that came up two yards short of a first down. \nLive Oak didn’t convert a first down until that late scoring drive. \nAfter the Acorns went up 21-7, the defense rallied. \nLed by Ditta who helped blow up two big plays, Live Oak forced Santa Teresa into a three-and-out. \nOn Live Oak’s ensuing possession, the first play out of the gate was a flea flicker featuring three pitches that eventually came back to Ornduff. \nBut by then, the Saints defense was swarming and Ornduff had to abandon the pass play and take off. \nAnd he ran right by Ryan Quadros who blew up a defender, losing his helmet in the process and buying Ornduff time to run. \n“We put that one in this week. It was going good until Paul (Lomanto) got some pressure and had to pitch it to Mitch and Mitch pitched it to me,” Ornduff said. “… Guys made some big blocks for me, laying some guys out.” \nHe gained seven yards on the play and Santa Teresa was flagged for a late hit out of bounds, giving the Acorns the ball on the Saints 35. \nLive Oak couldn’t find the endzone, but instead settled for a 33-yard field goal that Morgan Salzwedel hit with room to spare. \nThat put the game on ice, as Live Oak led 24-7 with less than 7 minutes to play. \nThe Saints did manage to score again, but it took them almost six minutes to find the endzone and they got some major help thanks to Live Oak penalties. \nThe Saints were moving backward and were forced to punt facing fourth and 35 from their own 32. \nBut a roughing the kicker call gave Santa Teresa a fresh set of downs. Then an unsportsmanlike conduct call on third down took the Saints from a fourth and three to a first down. \nAnd the Saints capitalized, needing three plays to go the final 31 yards, capped off with Laahs going the final eight yards for the score. \nAfter the PAT snap was fumbled, Live Oak’s lead was cut to 24-13 where the game stayed after the Acorns recovered an onside kick. \nLive Oak now must get ready for the perennial powerhouse that is Oak Grove. The Eagles are coming off a 43-0 win Friday night against Leland. They are now riding a four-game winning streak after dropping the first two games of the season and are starting their league-title defense strong. \nThe Acorns know they will need to hit the film room hard and work out the kinks of some plays that plagued them during Santa Teresa if they hope to beat the Eagles in San Jose next Friday. \n“We need to work on the penalties and we need to work on the mental game. A lot of big plays that could have been stopped,” Ditta said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T00:50:11.384+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
