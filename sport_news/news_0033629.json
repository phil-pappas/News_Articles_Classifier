(AP) — Buffalo Bills running back LeSean McCoy says he could miss another three games because of a pulled left hamstring. \nThat’s the timetable McCoy says he was provided by the team’s medical staff after he aggravated the injury in a 41-14 win at Miami on Sept. 27. Though calling himself a fast healer, McCoy didn’t rule out being sidelined until Nov. 8, when Buffalo returns from its bye week to host Miami. \nMcCoy provided the update Friday after being ruled out from playing at Tennessee this weekend. He called the new injury as a “grade-two pull” and acknowledged he might have come back from the injury too soon. \nMcCoy was hurt on Aug. 18, and returned for Buffalo’s season opener against Indianapolis on Sept. 13. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:48:46.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
