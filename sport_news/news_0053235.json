Considering the sensitivity of the matter and the serious implications that it could have not just for the six-time Chief Minister but also for the Congress, former Union Minister Kapil Sibal flew in to plead Virbhadra’s case. Sibal, who arrived here today morning, held an hour-long meeting with the Chief Minister before appearing in court and left immediately after the hearing was over. “I have personally been questioned before the CBI on their premises in New Delhi for one-and-a-half hours and have nothing more to add. Any further questioning by the CBI will amount to unnecessary harassment,” Virbhadra told The Tribune. He said he had answered in detail to every query of the CBI on exactly the same issue in which the CBI has now registered a case. The entire questioning was videographed and the CBI has given its report in this regard to the Delhi High Court. He also said that he never approached the court to prevent the CBI from arresting him. “I never apprehended arrest as I have already answered to each and every query of the agency as my lawyers have sought quashing of the FIR and questioned the issue of jurisdiction of the CBI,” he said. “However, I want to make it amply clear that I am being made a victim of political conspiracy hatched by Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and MP Anurag Thakur,” said a relaxed Virbhadra after the High Court directed the CBI that he could neither be arrested not his statement recorded during investigation without permission of the Himachal High Court. The Chief Minister said he was being made a target of political vendetta as the state Vigilance and Anti-Corruption Bureau in the state was probing the wrongdoings committed by Himachal Pradesh Cricket Association (HPCA). The HPCA is headed by Anurag Thakur, who is the BJP MP from Hamirpur and the son of former Chief Minister PK Dhumal. Virbhadra also said that he had made up his mind to go and attend the T-20 match between India and South Africa slated for October 2 in Dharamsala. “The subsequent developments and the obnoxious statements given by Anurag and Arun Dhumal that the HPCA has invited the Chief Minister and not Virbhadra Singh amounts to denigrating me and compelled me to change my mind,” he said. “The manner in which these insulting and humiliating statements were followed on social media by Dhumal’s younger son only makes it very obvious that it was a deliberate action and not unintentional,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:04:18.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
