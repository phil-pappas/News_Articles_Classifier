He had a fumble recovery, scooping up the ball just before it went out of bounds. And he had an interception. \nThe Acorns forced give Leland turnovers Friday night, turned them into 14 points and rolled to a 47-0 win on homecoming. \n“I’ve never had that before. It was exciting, but I had to stay focused and keep my composure,” Coreas said. “… I’m just happy in the moment. I love my team. My team is so great. I’m just very humble.” \nJoseph Avendano recovered Coreas’ forced fumble. \n“We put him in a new position this year, he stepped in and he’s doing a really good job for us,” said coach Mike Gemo of Coreas. “It was nice seeing him get that strip-sack, he got a pick in the second half. He’s just playing really well for us.” \nEric Payne had the other turnover, intercepting backup quarterback Collin Petrow to effectively end the game. \nLive Oak improved to 5-0 overall and 2-0 in Mt. Hamilton Division play. This is the best Acorns start since 2012 when they started 5-0 and is just the third time this century they have reached the midpoint of the season undefeated. \n“We’re only halfway through the season, I want to continue this,” Gemo said. \nLive Oak started 7-0 in 2004 and finished 8-3. \nBut what this team has accomplished is more than just starting 5-0. \nLive Oak has scored at least 42 points in every game and is averaging 47.6 points per game this season. In 2004, Live Oak averaged 27.7 points per game during its winning streak. In 2004, the Acorns averaged 31. \n“I knew we had some playmakers, but the kids are just making plays when they need to,” Gemo said. \nAnd Live Oak’s defense is yielding just 9.6 points per game, compared to 11.1 in seven games in 2004 and 14.6 in five games in 2012. \nLive Oak’s defense was beyond stingy Friday. \nThe Acorns allowed four first downs the whole night and never allowed the Chargers past midfield. The defense had six tackles for loss. \nThat propelled the Live Oak offense to put things away quickly. \nThe Acorns led 26-0 at the half and went up 40-0 in the third quarter when the game went to a running clock. \nQuarterback Erik Ornduff had three passing touchdowns, while throwing for 155 yards on 6 of 12 passing with an interception. \nThe interception didn’t hurt as the defense made a stop after giving up a first down, noting allowing Leland any further than its own 14. \n“It was just get back to work,” Coreas said. \nMeanwhile, two of Ornduff’s throwing TDs went for more than 40 yards. \nThe first went to Mitch Conforti who made a leaping grab before making a short run for the endzone and a 33-0 lead. \nThe second was an incredible catch by Isaac Prickett who made an off balanced grab along the far sideline, dodged diving defenders, tip-toed along the line and eventually dove into the endzone just keeping the ball on the correct side of the pylon. \nThat brought the score to 40-0. \nThat also brought Live Oak’s third running clock game this season. It allowed the Acorns to pull their starters and get the backups significant time. \n“I always love seeing everyone play. It doesn’t happen every week, but when it does, it’s real exciting for me to see everybody play,” Gemo said. \nOrnduff also had a rushing TD, going in from two yards out with 11 seconds left in the first half. \nThat play was set up two plays later on a 28-yard pass to Conforti, who took a big hit, which kept him out of the endzone. \nPaul Lomanto had two touchdowns, one rushing and one receiving. \nThe first was a screen pass that he broke 28 yards for the first score of the game in the opening quarter. \nHis second came with 4:29 to play in the half when he went four yards for a score and a 20-0 lead. \nChristian Guary set up the play when he returned a punt to the Leland 19, setting up Lomanto’s score three plays later. \nGuary got into the endzone himself in the fourth quarter when he broke and eight-yard off tackle run for the final margin of the game. \nJacob Ryder accounted for the remaining touchdown, when he punched the ball in on a 57-yard run in the first quarter. \nRyder went for 101 yards on seven carries. \nLeland’s Matt Takeuchi threw for 42 yards on 5 of 9 passing before being taken out for the second half. \nThe passing game was the bright spot of the night for Leland, who had 46 yards of total offense. \nThe Chargers had -3 yards on the ground, including sacks. \nThe Acorns will now prepare for Santa Teresa, who comes into the game with a 1-1 league mark after falling 27-14 to Willow Glen. The Saints are 3-2 overall. \nKickoff in the Santa Teresa game is scheduled for 7 p.m. Oct. 16. This will also be the Hall of Fame Game where 12 former athletes and coaches will be inducted in a pregame ceremony. \nNotes: Before the game, Coach Darrell Guthrie and his 1965 league title team were honored in a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the championship. It was Live Oak's first league title. Since then, according to the high school, the Acorns have won 17 league titles and four Central Coast Section championships. \nMorgan Salzwedel missed her first PAT of the season after making her first 29 attempts. She is 32-33 in attempts this season after making three more PATs in the second half. As a comparison, last year's place kicker Chase Vandenbrandhorninge made 30 PATs in 11 games. Salzwedel has made 32 PATs in five. \nThe Second half was delayed more than 5 minutes while stadium lights came back on following a halftime fireworks show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T22:15:31.471+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
