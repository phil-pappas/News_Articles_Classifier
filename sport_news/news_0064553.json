Park bounced back from a second-round 74 with a 67 to match Ko at 13 under 203 on Sky 72's Ocean Course.\nKo made the double bogey on the par-4 14th, driving left into the water and missing a 4-foot putt. The 18-year-old South Korean-born New Zealander rallied, driving the short par-4 15th to set up a two-putt birdie and making a 10-foot birdie putt on the par-3 17th.\nPark birdied three of the last four holes, also driving the 15th, holing a 20-footer on 17 and chipping to 2 feet on the par-5 18th. Making her first career LPGA Tour start, the 22-year-old South Korean player opened with a course-record 62. She won the Korea LPGA's Se Ri Pak Invitational two weeks ago for her third victory of the season.\nAmerican Lexi Thompson and South Korea's Mirim Lee each birdied the 18th to pull within a stroke of the lead. Thompson had a 69, and Lee shot 67.\nKo would take the No. 1 ranking from Inbee Park with a victory Sunday and also could move up under other scenarios. Inbee Park was tied for 18th at 5 under after a 70.\nKo tied for second last week in the LPGA Malaysia after winning her previous two starts in Canada and France, where she became the youngest major champion. Ko and Inbee Park, a two-time major winner this year, are tied for the tour victory lead with four.\nThailand's Moriya Jutanugarn and South Korea's Yoon-Ji Cho were two strokes back at 11 under. Jutanugarn holed out from 110 yards for eagle on the par-5 fifth in a round of 67, and Cho had a 69.\nTaiwan's Yani Tseng (69) was 10 under, and Norway's Suzann Pettersen (68) was 9 under along with China's Shanshan Feng (71). Pettersen won the event in 2007 and 2012.\n1 CONNECT 3 Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
