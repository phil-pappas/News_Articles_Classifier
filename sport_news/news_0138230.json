Miles invited Ortis and his family to take in the Auburn game at Tiger Stadium in September. It was a special event for all involved, as Miles and Ortis shared a moment on the field. \nThe two have also corresponded via phone calls. \nMiles called Ortis, who is home from the hospital and in hospice care, Thursday to discuss the upcoming game versus Western Kentucky.
