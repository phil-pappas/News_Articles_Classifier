He went down 143-145 to Turkey's Demir Elmaagcli in the summit clash. In the gold-medal match, Verma started with a 10 and a solid 29 in the first end to lead by a point. The lead changed hands after each of the following four ends. A wild eight in the second set from Verma allowed Elmaagcli to take the upper hand at 57-56, but the Indian rallied to shoot a perfect 30. Verma had a single-point lead (86-85) after nine arrows, but the Turkish, with the two consecutive perfect ends of 30, put paid to Vermaâ€™s hopes of clinching the god medal. \"You never know when perfect score is going to happen. Sometimes you just have a good feeling and this is what happened to me. It's been a great experience,\" Verma said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:11:58.496+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
