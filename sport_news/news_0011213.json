By Jocelyn Sheets Newton Daily News \nNewton High’s Cardinals came up short in scoring points off the serve Tuesday against Class 4A 15th-ranked Pella’s Lady Dutch. The Lady Dutch took advantage in winning the Little Hawkeye Conference match, 25-11, 25-12, 25-18. \nThe Cardinals dropped the conference match after honoring their six seniors and their parents in a pre-match ceremony. Stephanie Hoebelheinrich, Emily Fitzgerald, Allison Ergenbright, Jessie Smith, Adrienne Bergman and Fran Lucas played in their final home match. \n“Pella brought their A game,” Newton head coach Laura Sherratt said. “We are ready to work hard in practice Wednesday to make improvements.” \nNewton drops to 16-18 overall and 1-4 in LHC play. The Cardinals wrap up the regular season Tuesday in a conference match at Norwalk, which is ranked No. 14 in Class 4A. \nThe Cardinals were 35-of-37 serving the ball, but only scored 10 points off the serve. Pella (24-10, 4-1 LHC) went 61-of-68 from the service line, scoring 41 of its 75 points off the serve. \nLucas served up a point to pull the Cardinals even at 3-3, then Pella had back-to-back serving runs of four points. Junior Kaytlin Ahn, who had five service points on the night, served up two for the Cardinals to make it 14-8. \nAnother four-point run by the Lady Dutch pushed it to a 24-11 lead in the first set. Pella won the set on a defensive point. \nWith junior Taylor Shipley serving, the Cardinals pulled ahead 3-2 to open the second set. One of those points came on a kill by junior Megan Pressgrove. The set was back-and-forth until the Lady Dutch pulled out to an 11-7 lead. The Cardinals could not get any closer. \nIn the third set, the Cardinals were hanging with Pella in a point-for-point contest early. The Lady Dutch got the upper hand at 12-8. \nAhn, who led the net attack for the Cardinals with eight kills, downed one of those kills then served two points. Again, the Cardinals got close, but the Lady Dutch fended them off for the victory. \nNewton could not stem the potent net attack of Pella senior MaKenna Bogaard, who downed 10 of her team’s 28 kills in the match. Kiki Pingel was credited with 22 sets for the Lady Dutch. \nThe Cardinals had 17 kills as a team. Pressgrove had five and Shipley put down three kills. Junior Morgan Allen had one kill. Shipley put up 11 set assists, Pressgrove had five set assists and Hoebelheinrich had one set assist. \nAllen was credited with two block assists. Ahn, Pressgrove, Shipley, Ergenbright and Smith each had one block assist. Lucas came up with nine digs, and Pressgrove had seven digs. Ahn made four digs. Credited with one dig each were Hoebelheinrich, Fitzgerald, Bergman and sophomore Audrey Lucas. \nPressgrove served for two points. Shipley, Bergman and Fran Lucas each had one service point. \nPella won the junior varsity match, 25-21, 25-21. \nNewton’s freshman A-team lost 25-12, 25-9 and the B-team lost 25-13, 23-20. Brittney McConnell had a kill and a service ace for Newton while Hannah Edwards had an ace serve. Tegan Simmons, Desirae Shelton and Kyleigh Stevenson each had a kill. \nIn the B match, Anna VanDam served up an ace and Carolyn-Kaye Kimmel had strong serving runs. \n“In the A-team match, we played weak, not aggressive. We came off a great week of practice and worked on a lot of passing, but we didn’t pass well throughout the night,” NHS freshman coach Michaela Wood said. \n“We are battling some injuries and missing a couple of players. We had to mix it up, but the girls took it well and made some adjustments.” \nNewton’s freshmen play in Saturday’s tournament at Des Moines Lincoln. \nContact Jocelyn Sheets at 641-792-3121 ext. 6535 or jsheets@newtondailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T19:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:32:33.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
