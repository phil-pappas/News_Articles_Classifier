(AP) - The Lafayette Parish School Board has accepted a committee recommendation that it move forward with a tax proposal for facility improvements.\nThe Advocate reports ( http://bit.ly/1jdWjVQ ) the board's Wednesday vote was merely procedural and puts the public on notice that the board plans to discuss a potential tax in future meetings.\nFuture discussions will focus on what kind of tax - property or sales - and even whether a tax goes on a ballot. Once those decisions are made, the board must decide when it would go to voters.\nThe vote came after the board received an updated master facilities list from Chris Pellegrin, of CSRS Inc. The report is an update of the 2010 master facilities list that identified $1 billion in needed work on school buildings.\nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1jdWjVQ"], "published": "2015-10-08T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:53:46.467+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
