St. John's Prep's Jake Ewing is one of a stable of golfers for the unbeaten Eagles who is capable of shooting in the mid-30s in a given match. Posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 12:09 am \nBEVERLY — Last Wednesday afternoon at the Beverly Golf & Tennis Club, the St. John's Prep golf team found itself lined up against one of the best teams in the state. \nFor the Eagles, it was just another day at the office. \nSt. John's Prep, just like it had done in its other 10 matches this season, had very little trouble dispatching St. John's Shrewsbury by 15 strokes. That wasn't unusual. \nVery few teams, however, could survive against a top-notch opponent with its No. 1 player struggling. Prep senior captain James Turner had an off day in this one, shooting a 40, but players at the bottom of the lineup came through. Tom McGee, who plays No. 9 for St. John's, contributed a 39. No. 7 Tommy Cothern shot a 38, and No. 6 Will Grady came through with a 37. \nIt's that kind of depth that makes the Eagles — now 11-0 heading into Tuesday's big match vs. Xaverian at Salem Country Club — a favorite to not only win the Catholic Conference, but also capture the Division 1 North sectional and even the state championship. \n\"That's great because the top players aren't going to play their best every time out,\" St. John's Prep coach Larry O'Neill said. \"James shot a 40 and for him that's terrible. For me, I wouldn't mind it at all, but for him that's not good. (So) to have somebody else down the lineup pick us up means a lot, especially when we're playing a good team.\" \nTruthfully, St. John's is always playing a good team. The Eagles are tested with multiple matches against Xaverian, B.C. High and St. John's Shrewsbury, three teams that are also considered Division 1 state championship contenders. \nThe Eagles aren't really looking ahead, but their ultimate goals since the preseason have been to win everything they can — including every regular season match. \n\"I think it's definitely on the mind,\" St. John's Prep junior Mark Turner said. \"That's the goal; to try to win everything we can (in the regular season) and win the sectional and hopefully come out on top in the state tournament.\" \nThe top of the Prep lineup is definitely built like a state championship team's. \nThe Turners are two of the best high school golfers in the state, along with junior Chris Francoeur. That trio could certainly match up with any other team's top three, and it will no doubt give the Eagles a chance to win in the postseason. \nJake Ewing has also had a great season for the Eagles, as has Griffin Chenard. \nIf anything, having all that depth could make things a little difficult for O'Neill when the postseason rolls around. Only the top six players compete in the postseason tournaments. \n\"Playing six is going to be tough to determine. The fifth and sixth players, who will that be?,\" O'Neill said. \"But we've got (five regular season matches) more to play, so there's still a ways to go. Hopefully, that will shake down. It's a nice problem to have.\" \nSt. John's Prep has depth and confidence; two things that could be huge factors during the upcoming postseason. \n\"I think we're all capable of playing well. Our team is so deep. I didn't have a good day (Wednesday), but they really didn't need my score to count because some guys down the line played well. That's just been a consistent theme throughout the year,\" James Turner said. \n\"I think if we play our best, we're pretty tough to compete with. Anyone can kind of do that when they're playing well: shoot mid-30s. When you're playing high school matches, that's always going to help.\" \n||||  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:24:22.712+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
