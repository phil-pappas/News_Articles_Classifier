Silvers has said all season he thinks Ballew is the smartest player he has coached. However, Silvers likes that younger players will now get an opportunity to play, especially because the Week 9 matchup is relatively inconsequential. This allows Silvers to get a bit of a head start on next season. \n“I don’t want to discount our seniors by any means,” Silvers said. “They got us where we’re at now, the season’s almost over…but we’ve gotta do a good job of seeing what we’ve got for next year as well. It’s almost like what the NFL guys will do in Week 16 and you’re out of the playoffs. We’ve still got a chance Week 10, but Week 9 we can try to find a couple of pieces because we kinda get a do-over.” \nSo Week 9 will likely be about staying healthy and seeing what some younger guys are made of. Last week, Versailles ran some wildcat offense, just in case Duane Danner gets hurt. That’s something that may come up again against Blair Oaks. \nVersailles knows that the likelihood of coming out on top in either matchup against Blair Oaks is not great, but it’s going to get a practice run of sorts this week. Blair Oaks has been among the best teams in Mid-Missouri this season. \nThe Falcons have lit up the scoreboard every single week and only their game with Eldon was even a contest, but that game ended with Blair Oaks winning by 15. This electric offense is based around quarterback Jordan Hair. Hair was thrown for more than 1,300 yards with 17 touchdowns to go along with 465 yards on the ground with 11 scores. He has a nose for the end zone and spreads it around to a number of talented players. \nCody Alexander has had a phenomenal season out of the backfield with almost 800 rushing yards and 17 total touchdowns and wide receiver C.J. Closser has more than 700 receiving yards and 11 total touchdowns. \nVersailles hosts Blair Oaks - Updates on Twitter: @tony_hawley .
