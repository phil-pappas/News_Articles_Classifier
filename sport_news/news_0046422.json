He did not travel to Maryland, then dressed but sat out last weekend against Northwestern with an unspecified injury.\n“He was very, very close this last weekend,” U-M coach Jim Harbaugh said Monday. “He could have played, but we thought it was more prudent to not play him.”\nLosing a starting cornerback would affect most teams, but the Wolverines substituted Jeremy Clark for Stribling and missed very little. The first game without Stribling, Maryland threw for only 76 yards, and Northwestern threw for only 130 despite trailing the entire game.\n■ Offensive Line Rolling: Michigan’s offensive line produced another strong game in the 38-0 win over Northwestern on Saturday, as the Wolverines rushed for more than 200 yards for the fourth time in the past five games (against Maryland they finished just short with 198).\n“ Graham Glasgow stood out the most as our offensive player of the game,” Harbaugh said of his center. “Also (guard) Ben Braden continues to be an ascending player. He might have even got the silver medal. It was good to see. The line play has been ascending.”\nWith different players carrying the ball — 10 non-quarterbacks have a carry so far this season — the linemen have provided consistency as the same five players have been in for nearly the entire season.\n“They’ve just been taking huge strides,” U-M tight end Jake Butt said. “It helps too when you play together, and we’ve played some really good defensive lines, and Northwestern had the best (scoring defense) in the country. We still had great plays and had an easy time running the ball against them. It just helps with their confidence, and we’re starting to jell as a group.”\n■ Williams Emerges: U-M tight end A.J. Williams entered the Northwestern game never having more than two catches in a game in his career.\nHe caught four passes for 48 yards in the win over the Wildcats, both career highs.\n“I was smiling from ear to ear for him,” Butt said. “That was so cool to see. I think he was our leading receiver. A.J. does a lot of the dirty work, blocking in a glorified role. You don’t see a lot of those passes for him. But I think he was excited. Everybody was excited to see that.”\n■ Honored Trio: Last season, Michigan received only three Big Ten player of the week honors for the entire 12 weeks — two on defense, one on special teams.\nThe Wolverines matched that on Monday alone when cornerback Jourdan Lewis was named the defensive player of the week (a 37-yard interception return for a touchdown and four tackles, including one for loss), kickoff returner Jehu Chesson the special teams player of the week (a 96-yard kickoff return for a touchdown) and defensive back Jabrill Peppers a co-freshman of the week (five tackles, 1 1/2 for loss, and three pass-breakups).\n■ Hall Of Famers: Former U-M football coach Lloyd Carr headlines the four-person class that will be inducted into the athletic department’s Hall of Honor on Friday. Carr will be joined by former swimmer Brent Lang , former gymnast Elise Ray and former hockey player John Matchefts in the second class of 2015 as the induction ceremony is moving from the winter to the fall. They also will be honored at halftime of the Michigan State game.\nCarr, who retired as the head coach after the 2007 season with a 122-40 record, including the 1997 national championship, was inducted into the National Football Foundation College Football Hall of Fame in 2011.\n■ Correction: The pregame confrontation mentioned in the 1964 U-M/MSU capsule in Monday’s paper actually occurred before the 1966 game, according to the MSU player involved, Pat Gallinagh .\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nHarbaugh has 'utmost respect' for job Dantonio has done\nContact Mark Snyder at msnyder@freepress.com .
