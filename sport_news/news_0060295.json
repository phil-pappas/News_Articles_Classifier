Last September, the district counted 39,910 students, according to district data.\nEach additional student will bring about $6,988 in state funds. For Beaverton, the 815 additional students could bring nearly $5.7 million.\nThe number was 256 students higher than the district predicted.\nNext door, Hillsboro School District saw its numbers fall for a second year. As of Oct. 1, enrollment stood at 20,447, which is 120 students shy of the 20,567 the district counted on Oct. 1 last school year, according to district numbers.\nEnrollment numbers do not include the nearly 200 students at City View Charter School or students in out-of-district placements who are attributed to Hillsboro by the state.\nThe district had predicted a loss of students this school year, but it was even greater than the estimate of 76 students.\n\"The biggest contributor to that (decline) is our kindergarten class,\" said Beth Graser, district spokeswoman. \"We projected a class of 1,606 and currently have 1,477 kinders.\"\nEnrollment in Hillsboro has been a bit of a roller coaster over the last few years. The district saw a steady increase for years until 2012-13 when it lost students for the first time. The next year, Hillsboro saw a jump of 344 students in 2013-14 but has lost students for the last two years.\n-- Wendy Owen\nwowen@oregonian.com\n@bvrtnreporter\n@wowen1\n503-294-5961", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/bvrtnreporter", "https://twitter.com/wowen1"], "published": "2015-10-03T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:24:45.476+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
