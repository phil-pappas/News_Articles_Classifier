They are enjoyable in their own right and bring us benefits like health and longevity. Positive attitude is not necessarily there in all of us but it can be cultivated. Meaning to say that if you are not naturally prone to looking at the bright side, you can actually change that attitude. October is called the “Positive Attitude Month” and since we are in this month this is a perfect excuse for cultivating the attitude that can bring in greater health, happier relationships and more luck in life than what you would attract with a sulky disposition. Big five\nWe are all born with a set point of certain traits such as the “Big Five”. These are inborn personality traits that influence our levels of optimism and positivity: n Openness\nn Agreeableness\nn Extroversion\nn Conscientiousness\nn Happiness\nPositive Psychology Research has shown us that we can alter our habitual thought patterns by changing our perceptions. If we change our negative thinking patterns and replace them with new positive patterns and make them a habit we can create a new set point for happiness. Attitude adjustment\nSome of us are just naturally happy people yet it is important for us to share our happiness. We can share our positive attitude with our loved ones. Positive thinking\nThinking positively changes your possibilities. Happy circle\nSurround yourself with positive energy. One works with positive energy around you. Cognitive restructuring\nHabitual thought patterns colour our world for better or worse. Try to look at things more positively realistically and feel less stressed as a result. Self sabotage\nAre you your own worst enemy? There are many negative patterns that can really hinder your success in coping with stress. Recognise the ones that are familiar to you. Learn to let them go. Self esteem versus stress levels The way you feel about yourself impacts your happiness level. For example, if you can see difficult things as challenges instead of as a threat then. If you don’t trust yourself then these situations seem like threats. Self talk\nThis is your internal dialogue with yourself. We use it to view the world explain situations and communicate to ourselves. Positive or negative self talk will influence the level of stress you feel. A thinking style negatively tuned can perpetuate a negative view of one’s life. Positive self talk\nAre you playing on your own stress? Check it. You can create more energy with your attitude. Negative self talk\nThis can limit you increase your stress levels adversely and effect your confidence. Are you an optimist? Learn to be one!
