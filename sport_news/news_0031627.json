He was very good for them tonight.\"\nLundqvist has a .943 save percentage and has allowed just six goals while facing an average of more than 35 shots per contest.\n\"It's great to see (Lundqvist) give us a chance to win these first few games,\" Rangers defenseman Ryan McDonagh said. \"Now we know we can improve for sure defensively, giving up chances, hopefully give up less against. But at the end of the day, we found a way to win three pretty good, important games to start the year.\"\nLindberg, a 23-year-old rookie, is also enjoying a great start to the 2015-16 season. He is tied for the league lead in goals with four while linemates right winger J.T. Miller has four assists and left winger Kevin Hayes has a goal and two assists.\n\"I think we've been doing that all three games, playing hard and trying to get the puck deep,\" Lindberg said of his line. \"I think from there, we've been creating chances and I've been able to be in the right spot at the right time. So we are just trying to keep it going.\"\nLindberg gave the Rangers a 1-0 lead at the 1:20 mark, when he drove the net and swept home the rebound of Hayes' attempt, and scored again less than four minutes later when a pass from Miller banked off his skate and past goaltender Sergei Bobrovsky , who allowed four goals on 22 shots before being relieved by Curtis McElhinney .\nMoore gave the Rangers a 3-0 advantage by batting a pass from center Jarret Stoll out of mid-air at the 5:48 mark of the first period.\nLeft winger Rick Nash had a chance to make it 4-0 on a penalty shot but Bobrovsky made a right pad save.\nBrassard eventually extended the lead to 4-0 by deflecting a pass by defenseman Dan Boyle and center Derek Stepan made it 5-0 at the 1:26 mark of the third period. Goals by Johansen and left winger Boone Jenner were cosmetic and too little, too late against an extremely sharp Lundqvist.\n\"They're a great team. We've said that from the start of the season,\" Blue Jackets right winger Nick Foligno said. \"They do a lot of things right. They're consistently at the top of the league for a reason. ... We just weren't able to overcome the adversity of a couple bad bounces.\"\n\"I felt like I was tracking the puck pretty good and it was a challenging game,\" Lundqvist said. \"Playing three (games) in four (nights) - going into this game, the biggest challenge was to find that energy. But it's fun to come back home and play here at the Garden again and it was not hard to find that energy tonight.\"\nNOTES: Blue Jackets C William Karlsson made his season debut. He took the place of C Alexander Wennberg, who suffered a concussion Friday night against the Rangers in Columbus. ... Blue Jackets RW David Clarkson (lower body) missed his third game of this season with an injury and D Cody Goloubef was also a scratch. ... The Rangers made one lineup change, inserting LW Tanner Glass in place of RW Jesper Fast. ... D Dylan McIlrath and RW Emerson Etem were scratches for the Rangers. ... The Rangers have won each of their first three games of the regular season for the first time since 2008-09.\n  NHL Game Summary - NY Rangers at Chicago Talbot, Rangers blank Flames NHL: NY Islanders 3, NY Rangers 2 NHL: New York Rangers 3, Dallas 2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:11:22.720+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
