Well, that’s what the meathead contingent of Cubs nation believed. The sane, rational crowd understood that Bryant missing those 12 games was a punt you had to kick in order to retain his rights another season down the road. #Krismas came right on schedule, and the Cubs are now in the National League Division Series against the St. Louis Cardinals, having won the Wild Card playoff against the Pittsburgh Pirates. Having Bryant on day one would not have made enough difference to catch the Cards- that’s just a fact of life. Kris Bryant has had a NL Rookie of the Year level season, but he’s not superman. Essentially it all worked out. Now it’s time for Bryant to show his stuff in the postseason and help lead the Cubs to the National League Championship Series. MLB on TBS analyst Gary Sheffield tabbed the Cubs infielder to be the breakout young star of this Major League Baseball playoffs. Here’s what Sheffield said on a media call yesterday about Kris Bryant: Gary Sheffield on the young star that will stand out in the postseason: “Chicago’s Kris Bryant. There’s something about this kid that I just love. I like a lot of players, but I love this guy. You could put him anywhere on the field. He’ll go over there and is still going to hit… What happened to him in spring training, had to go down, we know why, but to come back and not be bitter about it and just go out and do his job, and now his team is in the playoffs, I love this kid.” Paul M.
