He’s definitely got it,” Cook said, conceding the battle to Whitfield. “Kermit’s fast. He got it. Kermit got it.” Florida State running back Dalvin Cook speaks with media on Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2015. Safid Deen/Democrat \nCook and Whitfield have been standout performers for the Seminoles’ offense through the first six games of the season. Whitfield leads the team with 29 receptions and 397 yards after being a non-factor during his first two seasons. He was also out of a majority of spring practice, recovering from a hamstring injury. \nCook, who was named a midseason All-American by USA Today, ESPN and CBS Sports on Tuesday, leads the team with 11 touchdowns and is second in the nation with 8.68 yards per carry ahead of LSU’s Leonard Fournette. Cook is 45 yards away from becoming the fastest player in school history to rush for 1,000 yards, and joining Warrick Dunn as the only Seminoles to accomplish such a feat more than once. No. 9 FSU looks to turn the corner against Georgia Tech \nCook is on pace to accomplish the feat by not even running as fast as he’s capable of during select points in the games because of a hamstring injury he suffered on Oct. 3 at Wake Forest. \n“That’s real crazy coming from him and then me having one” Whitfield said comparing their injuries. “I don’t think I probably would even run with that.” \n“He’s running, but he’s running powerfully against big ole’ lineman. … He’s a freak of nature. I tell you.” <!--iframe--> \nSince Cook has sustained the injury, he’s pulled up on three runs when he felt the hamstring flare up during the Miami and Louisville games in the last two weeks. In those games, Cook has accounted for 44 carries for 385 yards and four rushing touchdowns. He’s also caught 10 passes for 107 yards and a touchdown. \nCook said by slowing down and getting out of the game immediately after he feels the hamstring getting tight again, he’s able to stretch on the sidelines and prevent it from getting worse. FSU's Kermit Whitfield transforming into reliable receiver for Seminoles \n“That’s key right there,” Cook said of his hamstring. “Just using it when you really have to, and that’s really helped me in the games just being smart about everything. It’s all about monitoring, and using it when I have to use it.” \nCook sat out his second consecutive day in practice Tuesday, as the Seminoles (6-0, 4-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) prepare to face Georgia Tech (2-5, 0-4) in Atlanta on Saturday at 7 p.m. on ESPN2. \n“Coming off Saturday, they try to get me to rest it earlier in the week so I can get that strength later in the week,” Cook said. “I feel better in the week. There’s no pain earlier in the week. I just get my strength back.” FSU’s Tyler Hunter held out of practice after concussion \nAgainst the Yellow Jackets in the ACC title game last season, Cook became a true weapon for the Seminoles accounting for 31 carries for 177 yards and a touchdown during FSU’s 37-35 victory. \nWhile he’s eager to practice every chance he can with his teammates, Cook knows resting and getting mental reps will allow him to perform to the best of his capabilities after the first hamstring issue in his football career. \n“As a back, you’re going to have to do that sometimes being a smart football player,” Cook said of keeping himself healthy. “I’ve learned that over these past couple of weeks. It’s all about the long term at my position. \n“I’m key to the team, and they’re going to need me down the long run so it’s all about being honest with Coach Fisher and stuff like that.” \nFSU at Georgia Tech \nWhen/where: Saturday, 7 p.m., Bobby Dodd Stadium in Atlanta \nTV/radio: ESPN2, 103.1 FM in Tallahassee VIDEOS: JIMBO FISHER, FSU PLAYERS PREVIEW GEORGIA TECH Video: Jimbo Fisher talks Georgia Tech's triple-option offense | 02:45 Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher speaks with media after practice on Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2015.
