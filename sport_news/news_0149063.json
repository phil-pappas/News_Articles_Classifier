(Joshua Trujillo/seattlepi.com)\nSeahawks strong safety Kam Chancellor forces a fumble from Detroit...\nTwo weeks ago, Kam Chancellor was public enemy No. 1 for many Seahawks fan.\nNow, he very well might be the man who saved Seattle's season.\nChancellor forced a fumble from Detroit Lions receiver Calvin Johnson just short of the goal line in the final minutes of Monday night's matchup, wrestling a win away from the rallying Lions and helping the Hawks even up their record at 2-2.\nThe Seahawks were staring a 1-3 record squarely in the face heading into next week's tough road test versus the Cincinnati Bengals, but the 27-year-old strong safety almost single-handedly reversed their fortunes with a game-saving play that secured the 13-10 victory.\n\"We saw one of the great plays in ball, when the team's on the precipice of winning the football game and the guy makes a play,\" head coach Pete Carroll said after that game. \"The play Kam makes is extraordinary.\"\nBefore Chancellor's miracle finish, Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford, held down for much of the game by a stingy Seahawks defense, hit backup tight end Tim Wright for a 26-yard gain in front of Chancellor that gave the Lions a first down at the Seattle 20-yard line with less than three minutes remaining.\nThree plays later, facing a key third-and-1 from the 11, Stafford hit Johnson, who had beaten cornerback Cary Williams for a catch at the 8-yard line. The three-time All-Pro gained steam as he raced toward the end zone, then dived toward the end zone at about the 2-yard line as he was being tackled by both Williams high and free safety Earl Thomas low.\nChancellor came from behind Johnson, punching the ball out of Johnson's left arm and into the end zone, where it was batted -- illegally, as you might have heard -- out of bounds by linebacker K.J. Wright. The officials ruled the play a touchback and gave Seattle the ball in front of a frenzied crowd of more than 69,000.\nMinutes later, Chancellor told reporters that he felt he needed to make a play to make good with his teammates after giving up the long completion to Wright.\n\"I gave up a big play to get down there,\" Chancellor said. \"I gave up a seam route -- something I didn't see on film  -- and I owe that to my defense to get the ball back. We always preach 'get the ball back,' so I made up for it.\"\nHe certainly did that, and he likely made up for his nearly two-month-long contract holdout in many fans' eyes.\nDuring Chancellor's protracted stalemate with the team, many fans eviscerated the three-time Pro Bowler for abandoning his team, calling him selfish -- or worse. Some even swore they were forever done with the player who put the \"Boom\" in the Hawks' vaunted \"Legion of Boom\" secondary.\nBut on Sunday, Kam made good with Hawks fans. Not that he felt like he needed to apologize.\nAfter he reported back to Seattle on Sept. 23, Chancellor said he forgave fans who didn't know or understand his situation, avoiding any opportunity to admit that he empathized with a fanbase that felt betrayed by one of Hawks' heart-and-soul players. He said what brought him back was watching his teammates struggle without him, and after watching him make the game-deciding play on Monday, his teammates said they were glad he returned.\n\"I just saw Kam just finishing all the way to the end,\" Wright said. \"That's just something he does. He's a special football player. I'm so glad that he came back, and it's just a play that was big time for us, and he knocked the ball out. He got the game-winner for us.\"\nThere will likely be some who won't forgive Chancellor even after his heroics Monday night bailed out a Seahawks offense that frankly failed to live up to its end of the bargain versus the Lions -- due largely to the continued struggles of a line that might be among the worst in the NFL.\nOn a day when the offense let Detroit back in the game with a fourth-quarter fumble from quarterback Russell Wilson that Lions defensive tackle Caraun Reid returned for a 27-yard touchdown, Chancellor said he was just doing his duty when he made a play that could very well save the Hawks' 2015 campaign.\n\"That's our job,\" he said. \"We play defense. We don't really look at what the offense does over there. We praise them and we encourage them to keep going, keep fighting no matter how the results look. But we play defense. We're there to get the ball. We're there to stop the offense. We're there to protect the end zone.\"\nChancellor said he's moved on from the contract dispute, and that he's someone who doesn't live in the past. For any holdouts who saw Chancellor man his post when it mattered most on Monday and still hold a grudge, it might be time to do the same.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:49:12.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
