Lono/for New York Daily News MLK's Jethro Dede shows sympathy for a bloodied John Bahr DeStefano but the Knights still put a beating on Bronx Science, winning 4-0 in a PSAL Class A quarterfinal on Sunday. Martin Luther King soccer has developed a reputation and culture of excellence over the past 20 years, reaching the semifinals of the PSAL playoffs in each of the last 18 seasons. Head coach Martin Jacobson and his team have taken great pride in controlling the game, dominating possessions and wearing down opponents.\nOn Sunday at Randall’s Island Field, the Knights were able to do just that against Bronx Science in a PSAL Class A quarterfinal game.\n“We’re a possession team,” Jacobson said following his team’s 4-0 victory. “We’re a nationally-ranked team and we teach soccer correctly, to possess the ball.”\nJacobson estimated the top-seeded Knights controlled about 90% of the touches, which was the main reason why they were able to fend off the pesky, eighth-seeded Wolverines and advance to Monday’s semifinal. MLK will play Clinton in one semifinal and Tottenville will play Aviation in the other.\nMLK threatened to score early and often in the first half on Sunday, but was repeatedly turned aside by Bronx Science goalkeeper Caden Pavlin. The freshman was at his best from the very beginning. In the 10th minute he saved two MLK breakaways, each time by coming out of his net and sliding into low shots.\nPavlin was forced into action after senior starter Brett Goldstein received a red card in the team’s opening-round game on Saturday, meaning he was suspended for Sunday as well.\n“I did not expect Caden to come out and do what he did today,” Science coach Philip Cancellar said. “He kept us in the game with save after save. He did a fantastic job.”\nIt was not until the 66th minute that the Knights were able to break through Pavlin and the stingy Bronx Science defense. Senior midfielder Jesus Sanmartin received the ball at the top of the box, took one step to his left and unleashed a rocket over the keeper’s outstretched arms to put MLK up 1-0.\n“We do that in practice,” Sanmartin said about the play. “I’m always the man on top of the box and I try to get off a shot, so that’s exactly what I did.”\nOver the next 10 minutes, the Knights would use their skill and superb ball movement to tack on three more goals — each of them off the foot of senior Kerfala Sylla — and securely end the Wolverines’ season.\n“I told the guys we had nothing to lose,” Cancellar said. “This is the best season we’ve had. I’m very proud of these guys. We had a great season and have a good crop of guys coming up (next year).”\nMLK has won 12 of the last 15 city titles, including last year, but its players and coaches are still not satisfied.\n“We’ve got another tough game coming in the semifinal,” Jacobson said. “We’ve go to try and get back to the championship.”\n“King’s a big name,” Sanmartin said, “so we have to show what we can do and win this championship. These are the playoffs, these games are no joke.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:11:18.522+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
