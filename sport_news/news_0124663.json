WILLIAMS / STAFF WRITER\nPublished: Oct. 15, 2015 12:48 p.m. WILDOMAR: Property purchases holds up storm drain project Print Photo Share Pin It More Galleries ADVERTISEMENT Wildomar officials are seeking to install a storm drain near Palomar Street in the central part of town to control severe flooding that occurs there during the rainy season, as seen here on Palomar in 2014. , FILE PHOTO Related article » Rather than go to court to force a Wildomar property owner to sell land needed for a storm drain project, the city will attempt to negotiate one last time.\nThe City Council voted 5-0 Wednesday, Oct. 14, to postpone initiation of the eminent domain process in attempting to obtain land totaling about 3/4 of an acre near Palomar Street. With the power of eminent domain, a city can force an owner to sell land needed for a project that will benefit the public.\nThe decision came after Assistant City Manager Dan York said the owner’s attorney suggested it might be fruitful to continue negotiations. York said that while the owner has agreed to accept the city’s offer of $37,500, there are other aspects of the deal still in dispute.\nThe city plans on installing drains totaling about 2,400 feet in length along Refa Street between Charles Street and Palomar, and along Charles between Woshka Lane and Billie Ann Road.That section – including the Windsong development – is prone to flooding during the rainy season.\nThe proposed drain, which would range in diameter from 84 inches to 66 inches, will be designed to handle runoff from a 100-year storm.\nContact the writer: 951-368-9690 or michaelwilliams@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwa1so-b88540778z.120151015124838000gqlcjrfc.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwa1so-b88540778z.120151015124838000gqlcjrfc.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:08:46.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
