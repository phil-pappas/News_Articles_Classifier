It also exhibits an offense that, behind a formidable front, can move the football in a myriad of ways. \nIn many ways, that makes William & Mary exactly the type of football team Delaware aspires to be. \nThe Blue Hens aren’t there yet, and William & Mary will likely make their attempt to continue to develop quite a challenge in the 7:30 p.m. Delaware Stadium matchup. It will be televised nationally on the NBC Sports Network. \n“They play exceptionally hard and they’re very, very physical,” Delaware coach Dave Brock said of the Tribe. “I think they play great complimentary football, great team football. They take the ball away, they don’t give it away. They run the ball, they stop the run. They play good special teams.’’ \nComing off a confidence-building effort at FBS North Carolina, which pulled away late for a 41-14 win, the Blue Hens find themselves at a critical juncture. A winning season and their ultimate goal – making the NCAA playoffs – may ride on this outcome for Delaware (1-3 overall, 0-1 CAA). \nWilliam & Mary (2-1, 1-0) shut out Stony Brook 21-0 last week. \n“It’s William & Mary. There always ready to play,” said Delaware senior defensive lineman and team captain David Tinsley after a spirited practice session. “We know it’s going to be a line-of-scrimmage game and that’s what we pride ourselves on. Our offensive and defensive lines need to be ready to play. We just have to do our job, knock it back on the line.’’ \nThe Tribe and Blue Hens are each among the CAA leaders in rushing offense and rushing defense, with Delaware having gained a season-high 279 ground yards last week at UNC. Stony Brook had averaged 286.5 ground yards per game before being limited to 64 by William & Mary. \n“They look like they have as good a football team as they’ve had in a while,” Brock said. “They’re certainly playing great football and I can’t imagine they’re going to lack for confidence after coming off a shutout and doing what they did to Stony Brook’s defense. I think everybody in this league knows how good they are.” \nBut Delaware has struggled to get its passing game untracked, with freshman quarterback Joe Walker having completed just four passes in two of the last three games, which adds to Saturday’s challenge. \nThrowing the football has never been a problem for William & Mary, whose 36th-year coach Jimmye Laycock’s has long been singled out for his offensive acumen, particularly with his passing attack. The fact that William & Mary can run the football so well makes their passing game even more dangerous. \nTailback Mikal Abdul-Saboor had rushed for 100 yards or more in seven straight games, and 15 overall, before last week. When he went out with an injury against Stony Brook, junior Kendell Anderson stepped in and gained 191 yards on 19 carries with two touchdowns. \nWilliam & Mary junior quarterback Steve Cluley is No. 2 in the CAA in passing efficiency while completing 64 percent of his passes with six touchdowns and just one interception. Tinsley said the Tribe will try to lull the Hens by pounding the football on the ground and then hit them with a clever pass play. \nDespite the Blue Hens’ youth – 16 starters and 33 of the 46 who played last week at North Carolina were freshmen and sophomores – Laycock said Delaware cannot be underestimated. \n“Delaware’s Delaware,” Laycock said. “They’re always talented, they always play hard, they’re always good. They’re especially tough to play up there in Newark. We know what we’re getting into.” \nContact Kevin Tresolini at ktresolini@delawareonline.com .
