That soon became 10-0 after McCloskey slotted a penalty. \nAfter the Ulster centre missed with his next shot at goal, and Jayden Hayward did likewise for the Italians, Ulster bagged their second try when Reidy drove over from a maul. \nMcCloskey converted to make it 17-0 and Treviso's ill-discipline then cost them dear, with yellow cards being shown in quick succession to both prop Rupert Harden and number eight Robert Barbieri. \nThe net result was the inevitable concession of more tries, with Marshall getting over first and then Gilroy scoring a trademark try by weaving his way through a thicket of defenders to grab the bonus point. \nMcCloskey missed both conversions but Ulster looked out of sight at half-time on the back of their 27-0 lead. \nAfter Sam Christie's score for the Italians, converted by Hayward, Ulster upped the ante again. \nBrowne crossed in the 55th minute, McCloskey converting, and Gilroy's try and Nelson's conversion took the score beyond 40. \nStevenson went over the Italians' line in the closing stages to complete the rout with the help of another Nelson conversion.
