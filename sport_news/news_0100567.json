It’s typically good for a player to spend a little time in the AHL. \n“Look at a guy like Klef (Oscar Klefbom), who benefitted, I think, a lot from it,” said Andrew Ference, adding the emergence of Klefbom and the arrival of Griffin Reinhart, not to mention Andrej Sekera and Eric Gryba, have made it tougher to get a spot here. \n“We have a lot of guys here this year, obviously. A lot of young guys pushing to come into the league. It’s a dog fight to earn your job and earn your ice.” \nBut Ference believes Nurse has the skills and heart to stay in the NHL for a very long time once he gets here. \n“He’s a tremendous player, there’s no doubt about that,” said Ference. “He’s obviously just physically a great athlete. His movement and his aggressiveness and his willingness to do whatever it takes in a game makes for a tremendous teammate. \n“And it doesn’t take very long to season. It’s not like when I came in and young guys took a few years. Young guys coming in now are coming in so prepared and so ready for the NHL game now it doesn’t take the good ones too long to be ready for it.” \nMcLellan says Nurse is not far off right now, and expects him in the NHL very soon. \n“Nobody wants to be cut,” he said. “Whether you’re 18 or 39 you don’t want to be released. You take it on the chin and it hurts a little bit. \n“Darnell is a very proud man and it hurt a little bit but I’ll see a smile again, it won’t be long.” \nFollow me on twitter.com/sun_tychkowski", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:25:14.703+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
