(AP) - A Port Allen man has been sentenced to 10 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to charges in a murder-for-hire plot against a Pointe Coupee couple after a business deal went bad.\nThe Advocate reports ( http://bit.ly/1Pwzidy ) Tommy Joe Gioele broke down in tears Monday outside the courtroom of state District Judge J. Robin Free while walking to a holding cell. The 38-year-old man had entered the guilty plea to two counts of solicitation of murder.\nGioele was arrested in December after the man he's accused of hiring to kill Manuel A. Persica and his wife, Camellia, turned informant for the authorities, jump-starting the investigation leading to his arrest.\nInformation from: The Advocate, http://theadvocate.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
