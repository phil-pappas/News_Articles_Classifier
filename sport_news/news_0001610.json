Both Bill Belichick and Mike McCarthy, if they are at all interested in their legacies, would do well to remember the adage: Good coaches win; great coaches cover. \nJets over Patriots: The stingiest team in the AFC versus the most prolific, which makes for a tough call. However, according to time-tested football handicapping theory: Great defense stops great offense. Thus, save your prayers for Tommy and your cash for Gang Green.\nGiants over Cowboys: Tom Coughlin predicts the Giants won’t embark on a long losing streak as they did last year at this time. Surely he’s right, but Hondo wouldn’t be as confident about Nostra-Thomas’ prophecy if the ’Boys weren’t likely to be without Dez Bryant and definitely without a quarterback.\nIt’s fortunate for Eli Manning that Damontre Moore has taken so much heat for committing that foolish roughing penalty on Sam Bradford in Monday night’s loss to the Eagles. Otherwise, Eli would have received his fair share of the blame for throwing a pick-six. \nBills over Jaguars: This week in London: Big Ben meets Big Mouth, who will be on the high side of a big rout. During its interview of Pacman Jones after Cincinnati’s win over the Buffs on Sunday, the NFL Network showed some naked Bengwads in the background. Apparently, it’s part of their new postgame package.\nRams over Browns: Operators of fantasy football sites DraftKings and Fan Duel can breathe a sigh of relief now that they have been summoned to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. As proven with its investigations of the IRS targeting scandal, as well as Benghazi, no ramifications should be expected from appearing before that collection of lightweights.\nSteelers over Chiefs: Rumor has it Iran, which convicted Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian of espionage, is extremely grateful to Obama for not making his and the other hostages’ release part of the nuke negotiations, although not enough to call off the chants of “Death to America.”\nDolphins over Texans: Bill Clinton is making a rare appearance on the campaign trail Saturday in Iowa with Hillary. Sources say Bubba has told friends he has two good reasons to disrupt his weekend: Katy Perry also will be at the rally.\nCanada’s Prime Minister-designate Justin Trudeau Photo: Reuters Lions over Vikings: With Justin Trudeau, son of Pierre and Maggie, having been elected Prime Minister of Canada, stories of his mother’s affair with Ted Kennedy have resurfaced. It’s a little known fact, but Ted and Maggie eventually broke up because neither was comfortable with Ted being the one with the larger rack.\nTitans over Falcons: The problem with R-S MSNBC (Ratings-Starved MSNBC) using breaking news anchor Lyin’ Brian Williams to report breaking news, as was the case Wednesday with Joe Biden’s announcement, is that viewers then have to switch to another network to verify if the item is true.\nRedskins over Buccaneers: Speaking of anchors without credibility, “Truth,” the movie that disputes the veracity of Dan Rather’s erroneous report on George “Dubya” Bush’s National Guard service — the one he apologized for and was fired for — is tanking at the box office. That’s probably because it’s competing against “The Martian,” a blockbuster that is far less fictional than “Truth.” \nSaints over Colts: Colts’ coach Chuck Pagano on the old “two left, nine wide right” fake-punt formation that ended in disaster against the Patriots: “I don’t regret the play call at all.” That’s similar to what Seahawks coaches Pete Carroll and Darrell Bevell said after last year’s Super Bowl-blowing call. All clearly have taken up residence in the State of Denial. \nChargers over Raiders: The NFL suspended side judge Rob Vernatchi for one week for screwing up the clock in the Steelers-Chargers game. However, there will be no suspension for Roger “$44M A Year” Goodell for screwing up the investigations/punishments of Deflategate, Ray Rice, Greg Hardy, and Bountygate, or for destroying the Patriots’ Spygate tapes, or for his network showing naked Bengwads. \nPanthers over Eagles: From emailer BarkingMut, aka the HondoNation SoBe Bureau Chief: The last guy in charge of a group of uniformed young men who professed as much ignorance about what was going on right under his nose — as Louisville head coach Rick Pitino has vis-à-vis the team’s hooker scandal — was Sgt. Schultz in “Hogan’s Heroes.” \nCardinals over Ravens: In explaining why he couldn’t possibly have been responsible for two murders at the 2000 Super Bowl in Atlanta, Ray Lewis writes in his autobiography he was overdressed. Wearing a suit, earrings, a Piaget watch and a mink coat, according to Lewis, makes one far less apt to perpetrate violence. He’s right; that’s an outfit more suitable for obstruction of justice, to which he pled guilty and was sentenced to 12 months’ probation. \nBest bets: Giants, Bills, Dolphins.\nThursday: 49ers. (L)\nRussell Wilson’s abstention from sex is starting to get to him. The other day at practice he was overheard muttering to himself: I’d like to go to a hard count to cause some penetration, maybe get a sack and then head for the e-zone. So you can see why Hondo didn’t take the Seahawks Thursday night. \nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under bettor's guide ,  hondo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:14:41.246+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
