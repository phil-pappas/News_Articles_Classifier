Campaign. Uggs and Trump: For the discerning gentleman. This week, Boston Magazine reported Brady’s personal trainer, spiritual advisor and all-around guru, Alex Guerrero, was “a glorified snake-oil salesman,” just because he claimed to have produced a nutritional supplement that cured cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s in 192 of 200 patients. He said the stuff also cured heart disease, diabetes, arthritis, and helped you lose weight. Oh, and kids or pregnant women could take it. There were TV infomercials and everything.\nNone of it was true, of course. It also wasn’t true when he later claimed to have discovered a concussion-curing juice, which included testimonials from Brady and, uh, Wes Welker.\nThe 38-year-old Brady, of course, has said he wants to play until he is 45, and he is roaring through the NFL this season again, throwing for a preposterous 346.8 yards per game, 11 touchdowns, no interceptions. He never gets hurt, either. Brady is also Guerrero’s business partner, now. Enter, questions about the shadowy guru.\nBrady, on Boston radio station WEEI, fired back. He said, “I disagree with a lot of things that people tell you to do. You’ll probably go out and drink Coca-Cola and think, ‘Oh yeah, that’s no problem.’ Why? Because they pay lots of money for advertisements to think that you should drink Coca-Cola for a living? No, I totally disagree with that. And when people do that, I think that’s quackery. And the fact that they can sell that to kids? I mean, that’s poison for kids. But they keep doing it.\n“I think we’ve been lied to by a lot of food companies over the years, by a lot of beverage companies over the years. But we still do it. That’s just America, and that’s what we’ve been conditioned to. We believe that Frosted Flakes is a food . . . You just keep eating those things, and you keep wondering why we have just incredible rates of disease in our country. No one thinks it has anything to do with what we put in our body.”\nPutting aside the fact that Tom Brady is correct, this was a magnificent distraction. You want to know about my snake-oil trainer? Pow! Smoke bomb! Quackery! Kellogg’s and Coca-Cola responded to Brady, and Coca-Cola’s statement included the phrase, “All of our beverages are safe and can be enjoyed as part of a balanced lifestyle.” Which means Brady forced a major American company to essentially say, in real-world English, “None of our drinks are ACTUAL poison.” By the way, the Wikipedia page for Coca-Cola’s slogan history is a treasure. Go visit it sometime.\nAs for Brady, I would enjoy it if he prompted those caught in potential public scandals to deflect from them by speaking a hard truth about society. The next guy who gets busted for steroids should point out that campaign finance in America is a joke.\nLast week this space went 7-6-1. Also, the first time I lived in my own apartment one of the first things I did was go buy some Froot Loops, because my mom never let me have any. As Richard Russo once wrote, we do not want what’s good for us.\nAs always, all lines could change.\nTHE PICKS\nCincinnati (-3) at Buffalo This week the NFL declared war on sites like Deadspin and SBNation for posting NFL highlight GIFs, and Twitter briefly shut down their accounts. It’s funny: Twitter choosing advertising from the NFL over the NFL getting free advertising. Pick: Cincinnati\nChicago (+3) at Detroit Last week the Lions, the only winless team in football, benched former No. 1 pick Matthew Stafford and replaced him with Dan Orlovsky, famous for taking 11 steps out of an end zone before noticing during Detroit’s best chance of winning in that 0-16 season. I think the Lions are a prank. Pick: Chicago\nNew England (-9) at Indianapolis The Colts, of course, are the team that played tipster on the whole Deflategate thing. They were pretty good then, or at least, looked like they weren’t so bad. Now, it feels like the Patriots might actually kill them. Pick: New England\nTHE REST\nWashington (+6) at N.Y. Jets Pick: Jets\nArizona (-3) at Pittsburgh Pick: Arizona\nKansas City (+4) at Minnesota Pick: Minnesota\nDenver (-5) at Cleveland Pick: Denver\nHouston (pick) at Jacksonville Pick: Houston\nMiami (+2) at Tennessee Pick: Tennessee\nCarolina (+7) at Seattle Pick: Carolina\nSan Diego (+10.5) at Green Bay Pick: Green Bay\nBaltimore (-2.5) at San Francisco Pick: San Francisco\nN.Y. Giants (+4) at Philadelphia Pick: Philadelphia\nByes: Oakland, Dallas, St. Louis, Tampa Bay Last week: 7-6-1\nSeason: 39-35-2\nMore on thestar.com\nCanadian Soccer League rife with match fixing, according to report\nHow the Kansas City Royals won the American League", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T04:34:12.309+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
