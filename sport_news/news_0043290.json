The Trevians finished second to Hinsdale Central at the Class 3A state tournament.\n\"I was playing good golf, too,\" Iserloth said. \"It was a real smack in the face.\"\nHealthy and back on the course, Iserloth once again is a key contributor in the New Trier lineup. Iserloth shot a 10-over 81 to help the Trevians finish second (311) at their own invitational on Saturday, Oct. 3, at Winnetka Golf Club. The Class 3A New Trier Regional was scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 6, on the same course.\n\"I learned not to play basketball during the season,\" Iserloth joked. \"That can wait. I am enjoying playing golf this year.\"\nIserloth is just the second four-year varsity player that coach Pete Drevline has had in his 14 seasons involved with the program. The other was Wilson Bowen, a 2008 graduate.\nIserloth said he wouldn't be where he is today without learning some hard lessons as a freshman. After shooting an 85 in the first round of the Class 3A state tournament, he was pulled from the lineup for the second round.\n\"He didn't handle the pressure situation very well,\" Drevline said. \"But he's come a long way. It's been great to watch him grow all these years.\"\nIserloth said the talk he had with Drevline after that round at The Den at Fox Creek in Bloomington three years ago changed his outlook on the game.\n\"I look back at it as a blessing in disguise,\" Iserloth said. \"I had a bad attitude as a freshman, a bad demeanor on the golf course. [Drevline] gave me a great kick in the gut. That helped me a lot.\"\nLoyola\nA bout of pneumonia during the summer kept Luke Lynch off the golf course for nearly one month, and he wasn't cleared to play until the day before tryouts.\nAfter barely making varsity, he spent most of the year on the second team. It wasn't until Saturday, Sept. 26, at Lake Forest's tournament at Lake Bluff Golf Club that Lynch played his first 18-hole tournament as one of the top six varsity players. Then on Thursday, Oct. 1, he had one of his best rounds of the season, carding a 6-over 78 at the Catholic League tournament at Cog Hill's No. 3 course.\nAs of Sunday, Oct. 4, Lynch was in line to play for the Ramblers during the state series. The Class 3A New Trier Regional was scheduled for Tuesday, Oct. 6.\n\"I was playing catch-up all season,\" said Lynch, who credited his even-par 72 at the Sanctuary Golf Course on Saturday, Sept. 12, with vaulting him to the No. 1 lineup. \"But it's been rewarding. I set a goal for myself after my junior season to make the top team, and I did it.\"\nLoyola coach Tim Kane said Lynch has been a model player for the Ramblers — who won the New Trier invitational with a 307 on Saturday, Oct. 3, at Winnetka Golf Club — and not just because of his scores.\n\"He never gets too down on himself,\" Kane said. \"He's always steady and always has a smile on his face.\"\nLynch, who shot a 14-over 85 at the New Trier invitational, said his composure on the course is one of his strengths.\n\"As a kid, I used to get frustrated and freak out,\" he said. \"But I found I played better if I didn't do that. I'm always happy to be playing golf. There are far worse things to be doing.\"\nNorth Shore Country Day\nThe North Shore Country Day boys golf team had an outstanding run of success in Class 1A before this season, with two state championships and two second-place finishes since 2011.\nBecause of that, the IHSA's success factor moved North Shore up to Class 2A this season. The change puts the Raiders among bigger schools at the regional and sectional tournaments, yet senior captain Charlie MacVicar said the biggest difference will be at the Class 2A state meet — if they get there.\nGoing up to Class 2A \"will matter a little bit less in regionals and sectionals,\" MacVicar said. \"It's just the way that it's worked out. ... The scores — we've done our research the last couple years — they're pretty similar for getting out of our regional. [The competition] will be a little better, but the real difference will be at state.\"\nThe team to beat in Class 2A will be Morton. The defending Class 2A champions feature sophomore Tommy Kuhl, the 2015 Class 2A individual state champion, and senior Pete Kuhl. Tommy and Pete Kuhl are brothers, and they're committed to Illinois and Wisconsin, respectively.\nThe Raiders are led by MacVicar and fellow captain Drew Miles, who is the Independent School League Player of the Year this season. North Shore struggled at the New Trier Invitational on Saturday, Oct. 3, finishing with a 356 (13th) on a cold, windy day. Miles shot an 80, MacVicar shot 89 and sophomore Will Dart finished with a 91. Freshman Charlie Fezell (96) was the Raiders' fourth golfer.\nIt was a poor performance less than a week after the Raiders won the Independent School League championship, but MacVicar said it wasn't in line with how the team has played this season. He added that an important facet of having success in the postseason — the Raiders were scheduled to play in the Class 2A Richmond-Burton Regional on Tuesday, Oct. 6 — is to play consistent golf up and down the lineup.\nTwitter: @harnesspreps and @VanDrilSports\n Golf Winnetka Sports Illinois High School Association", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-5613f089/turbine/ct-gln-loyola-academy-new-trier-north-shore-country-day-boys-golf-tl-1005-20151006"], "published": "2015-10-06T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T20:18:41.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
