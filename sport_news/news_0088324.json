(Nuccio DiNuzzo / Chicago Tribune) Dan Wiederer Contact Reporter GM Ryan Pace's message at Halas Hall: If you don't fit, you don't stay. \nSomewhere, somehow, on the one Sunday of the fall he’s allowed to decompress, you could picture Bears general manager Ryan Pace retreating to a quiet place, staring off into the distance and finally taking a deep exhale. \nWow. This has been some month. \nIn the always chaotic NFL, the Bears have had themselves quite an eventful stretch, a fall filled with roster shakeups and heartening comebacks and drama of all kinds. \nSo as the sun set Sunday on the Bears’ off week and the team glanced forward at a demanding five-game November, it was imperative that Pace return to the controls with one necessary action: Ctrl+Alt+Del. \nA reboot is necessary in Lake Forest after a mid-week disturbance that proved downright, well, disturbing. On Wednesday, respected veteran Jeremiah Ratliff arrived at Halas Hall in no condition to work, according to multiple sources. And when asked to leave – with a family member summoned to pick him up – Ratliff exploded. \nHe became, according to sources, belligerent and insubordinate. And when it became obvious he was no longer standing on solid ground with his employer, Ratliff’s anger sparked multiple returns to team headquarters with outbursts menacing enough that the Bears called Lake Forest police as a safety precaution. \nOn the surface it was a disruption that harkened back to last season’s debilitating dysfunction within the franchise. Yet Pace’s swift and decisive action to terminate Ratliff’s contract spoke volumes of a new regime unwilling to tolerate misconduct and pushing to immediately stifle major threats to the team’s growing chemistry and belief. \nComeback wins over the Raiders and Chiefs to start October sparked an energy surge within the locker room, creating widespread confidence that progress is escalating. And in that context, the Bears could not let the month end with growing tension and anxiety and uncertainty surrounding what exactly will be tolerated. \nSay this much for Pace, a 38-year-old rookie GM still feeling out the nuances of his new role: he’s firm in his convictions. He is certain there’s been a positive culture change within the organization since January. And he’s determined to protect that cohesion by attacking his front office responsibilities without fear. \nRatliff, keep in mind, isn’t the first big name Bear to depart suddenly. \nOn Sept. 28, linebackers Jared Allen and Jon Bostic were both traded, to Carolina and New England respectively. A day later, Brock Vereen was cut. \nWhen Pace becomes certain that a player just isn’t a fit for what the Bears are aiming to accomplish, he hasn’t wasted time acting. \nAllen, it turns out, just wasn’t ever going to become an impact outside linebacker, no matter how hard he worked to adapt to the role the team needed him in. And at 33 years old, with his best football behind him, obvious indicators revealed that Allen wouldn’t be part of the long-term plan. So off he went. \nBostic? He was too often injured and subsequently too often rattled by those setbacks, his recovery timetables dragging on and on and on to the point that the coaching staff had no idea what they’d ever be able to squeeze out of him. So off he went. \nVereen, meanwhile, lacked the physicality to be an impact pro playmaker. So off he went, too.And while Pace may have made what many saw as an unwise and impractical gamble by signing legally troubled defensive lineman Ray McDonald this spring, the GM did at least install a zero-tolerance set-up that made McDonald a former Bear at his first misstep. \nIt’s far too early yet to assert definitively that Pace has the right formula to mold the Bears back into a Super Bowl contender. But what can be said is that he knows the stakes and he knows the business. Failed GMs rarely get second chances in this league. So if this is indeed his one and only shot as a team-building foreman, Pace is not going to sit on his hands and later look back with regret on all the moves he wishes he had made. \nAs the Bears return to Halas Hall on Monday after a four-day break, reaction to Ratliff’s departure figures to be muted. And whether it was an opportune time or not, a long weekend reboot was needed. \nNow the Bears will charge forward in their Week 8 preparations for the Vikings with clear minds.Yes, Ratliff’s exit leaves them even thinner up front defensively. Yet there will be no ambiguity in the standards and expectations being established. \nPlayers who don’t fit, don’t fit. For whatever reason. Talent. Role. Durability. Behavior.It is what it is. And off they’ll go.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:17:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:29:04.263+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
