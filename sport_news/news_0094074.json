Hedman had three assists. \nNikolaj Ehlers, Drew Stafford and Blake Wheeler had goals for the Jets (4-3-0). \nBen Bishop has started every game for the Lightning this season and stopped 33 shots. Ondrej Pavelec picked up his third loss in five starts. \nWheeler scored 1:17 into the third period to make it 3-3 with a shorthanded goal. He raced behind the net, stole the puck from Bishop and scored on a wraparound. \nTyler Johnson threaded a pass from behind the net to Coburn, who buried his first of the season for a 1-0 Tampa Bay lead. \nWinnipeg tied the game 1-1 when Ehlers scored his second of the season. Mark Scheifele shuffled the puck to Ehlers after taking a feed from Mathieu Perreault. \nEhlers came inches from his second of the night and a lead for the Jets, but his shot found iron, much to the liking of a helpless Bishop. \nTampa Bay restored their one-goal advantage 7:22 into the second frame. Paquette benefited from the Lightning forcing a turnover that allowed the sophomore to snipe his first of the season top corner over Pavelec's glove hand. \nStafford briefly tied the game 2-2 on a partial breakaway. But 21 seconds later, the Lightning struck again when Namestnikov fired in a rebound off Hedman's point shot to restore their one-goal cushion at 11:18. \nNOTES: Wheeler has a point in each of the Jets' seven games to start the season, tying a franchise record set by Donald Audette in 2000-01. Wheeler has nine points in seven games . Steven Stamkos played in his 500th game on Friday night. ... The Jets continue their six-game homestand against the Minnesota Wild on Sunday. Tampa Bay heads to Chicago for a date with the Blackhawks on Saturday night. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T06:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:49:41.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
