She’s going on a vacation, not to relax, but to compete. \n“I’m pretty pumped,” said Heims, a 16-year-old junior at Prairie High School. “I’m a little nervous. But I’m excited.” \nHeims is one of 84 athletes (and one of 32 women) selected to represent the United States at the International Paralympic World Championships, Oct. 22-31, in Doha, Qatar. The team was released Tuesday. \nShe will compete in the 400-meter dash and the discus. She leaves Oct. 13. \n“They say it takes about eight days to recover from jet lag,” said Heims’ mother, Kris. “We’re all very, very excited that Jess will have this opportunity.” \nHeims was born with a random congenital birth defect called Amniotic Band Syndrome, in which the fetus becomes entangled with fibrous amniotic bands in the womb, restricting blood flow and affecting the baby’s development. \nHer lower right leg and foot were deformed, lacking muscle and bone. Her right leg was amputated before she was a year old. \nShe joined the Cedar Rapids Track Club when she was about 10. She competes for Prairie’s track and field team, and now she’ll represent Team USA. \n“At the beginning of the summer, I knew this was a possibility,” she said. \nHeims used a prosthetic for her discus throwing, a “Cheetah blade” for running. She is being trained this fall on the track by Bill Calloway, girls’ coach at Cedar Rapids Jefferson. \n“I’ve definitely improved in the month or two he has been helping me,” Heims said. \nBrad Wymer of Solon is helping with her discus throwing. \nHeims will be trying to improve on her effort of 1:15.04 in the 400 meters, and 25.14 meters (82 feet, 5 inches) in the discus. \nWhile autumn is taking effect in Iowa, it’s still hot in Qatar. The average high temperature in October is 95 degrees. \n“I’ll be drinking a boatload of water,” Heims said. “I’d been getting used to running in the nice fall weather. It will take a week or two to get acclimated again to the heat.” \nIn addition to her training, she’s working ahead on her studies at Prairie, where she’s a 4.0-point student. \n“Hopefully, I’m not too far behind when I get back,” she said. \nHeims hopes to compete in the 2016 Paralympics in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which are held in conjunction with the Olympics. \nl Comments: (319) 368-8857; jeff.linder@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T18:42:22.823+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
