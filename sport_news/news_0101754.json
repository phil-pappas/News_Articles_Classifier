I think we've gone 10 quarters now without giving up a point on defense and I couldn't be prouder of how our defense has been playing.”\nPleasant Grove coach Les Hamilton\nPLEASANT GROVE — Good things happen when your defense is shutting opposing offenses down and Pleasant Grove's defenders are doing just that as their team approaches the postseason.\nThe Vikings ran past Westlake on Wednesday 34-2 using a defensive jump-start early in the second quarter to get rolling.\nWith Westlake approaching midfield in a scoreless contest, defensive back Jacob Doman picked off a pass that could have easily gone for a Thunder touchdown. Pleasant Grove's offense responded two plays later with Bub Wilde taking a backward lateral in the flat from quarterback Isaac Hamilton and then heaving it 55 yards downfield to Dane Christiansen to put the Vikings up 7-0.\n\"Defense led the way for us again tonight,\" said Pleasant Grove coach Les Hamilton . \"I think we've gone 10 quarters now without giving up a point on defense and I couldn't be prouder of how our defense has been playing.\"\nThe Vikings polished off the first half with Hamilton hitting on two 18-yard touchdown passes to Malik Overstreet and to Wilde for a 20-0 lead at the break.\nHamilton tacked on two more touchdown passes, a 63-yarder to Christiansen and a 15-yarder to Koy Wilkinson, to give him four touchdown passes on the night.\n\"I thought he played a great game. He really did a good job,\" Les Hamilton said of Isaac Hamilton, who happens to be his son. \"I'm biased, obviously, but he handled the pressure, hit the open guys and then our other guys just made plays. He had a really good game tonight and I'm proud of him.\"\nOther highlights for the Vikings included John Raas blocking a punt and Jacen Harker intercepting a pass late in the fourth quarter that effectively ended the game.\nWestlake's only points came when Mikey O'Connor tackled Overstreet in the end zone for a safety.\nWith the win, Pleasant Grove improves to 5-4 on the season and 3-2 in Region 4 play.\n\"I like how we're playing after having to play some really tough teams early on,\" Les Hamilton said. \"But we still have a lot of work to do and it starts again next week having to play a really tough American Fork team.\"\nWith the loss Westlake falls to 4-5 on the season and 1-4 in Region 4 play. The Thunder will finish off the regular season taking on Lehi at home this coming Thursday.\nEmail: bgurney@desnews.com\nTwitter: @BrandonCGurney", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:13:03.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
