Chengelis, Bob Wojnowski and John Niyo offer their predictions on the outcome of Saturday's Michigan State-Indiana game.\nMatt Charboneau: Michigan State's secondary has shown signs of improvement, but Indiana can move the ball through the air and likely will score its share of points. The Hoosiers, however, also have one of the worst defenses in the Big Ten and the Spartans should be able to get their offense rolling. Expect another big day for Connor Cook as Michigan State heads into the bye on a high note. Michigan State 38-20 \nAngelique S. Chengelis: Michigan State is coming off an emotional victory over Michigan and will have to counter a letdown. Indiana, which features the Big Ten's top-ranked team in total offense, will test Michigan State's secondary — QB Nate Sudfeld had 464 yards passing in a 55-52 loss at Rutgers last week. But Spartans QB Connor Cook is as steady and poised as they come. He will direct Michigan State to its 12th straight victory, sixth over Indiana. Michigan State 35-21 \nBob Wojnowski: As we've seen, the Spartans make you pay for mistakes, and the Hoosiers make plenty of mistakes. But Indiana also flings the ball more prolifically than anyone in the Big Ten with senior QB Nate Sudfeld. Michigan State's thin secondary will be tested, and so will its mental sharpness after last week's wild finish. The Hoosiers will score, but Connor Cook should have his way against their flimsy defense. Michigan State 47-33 \nJohn Niyo: Michigan State has yet to dominate an opponent, and Indiana's passing game — and tempo — certainly could give that secondary fits. But eventually the Spartans will get the running game rolling. The Hoosiers seem like a good place to start.
