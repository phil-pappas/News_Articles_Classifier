It includes an evening of live music, family friendly activities and a competition featuring creative spreads of picnics large and small.\n“We’re going to have a lot of fun this time,” says Peter Shannon, the Philharmonic’s artistic director and conductor. “The first half of our concert is going to be the typical fare.\n“We’ll do some classical stuff, some well-known classical pieces. We’ll do music from ‘The Royal Fireworks’ by Handel.\n“The end of the first half will be the finale of ‘The 1812 Overture, which is spectacular,” he says. “We will be involved with members of the cast of the Savannah Theatre again this year. They were so good last year.”\nThe second half of the concert will be in keeping with the picnic theme.\n“It does have quite a lot of music from the movies, including an excerpt from Wagner’s ‘Ride of the Valkyries.’ We’re also going to have ‘Comin’ Home, Baby,’ which was Ben Tucker’s most famous piece.\n“That will feature Jody Espina on the saxophone,” Shannon says. “The first piece we’re actually doing at the beginning is ‘Parade of Charioteers’ from ‘Ben Hur.’”\nIn addition to cast members of the Savannah Theatre, 40 students from different band programs in the Savannah-Chatham Public Schools will perform bass and percussion during the “Parade of the Charioteers.”\n“That’s going to mean a very big orchestra,” Shannon says. “We’re delighted to do this with these young, talented up-and-coming musicians from the schools.”\nOthers performing during the evening include Esther Garrison School for the Performing and Visual Arts Band and Orchestra, Savannah Arts Academy Chorus and local gypsy jazz band Velvet Caravan.\nThis year’s concert will be slightly different in one aspect.\n“Traditionally, we do more classical in the first half and then go into the poppy stuff in the second half,” Shannon says. “This year it’s a good balance of both. That is the goal of the concert.”\nPicnic in the Park is a treat for the entire orchestra, Shannon says.\n“It’s just a massive audience, such an appreciative audience,” he says. “This is the one event that draws the biggest crowd in Savannah.\n“We want to make sure we get it right. We’ve got to have a lot of energy on stage to transmit to such a massive group of people who are all there to listen to beautiful music and have fun.\n“We’re playing to a home crowd,” Shannon says. “We’re under a bit of pressure to do it right, but everyone is rooting for the orchestra and excited for the concert, so it’s hard to get it wrong.”\nMost professional orchestras have an outside concert at least once a year, Shannon says.\n“I think what I like about this venue is that it’s in an obviously beautiful park in Savannah,” he says. “Forsyth Park is so central in so many ways, geographically being in the heart of the city, but also with personality, too — it’s in the heart of the people.\n“Other places might use a fairground or park outside of town. That doesn’t have the attraction that Forsyth Park has to Savannah.”\nFor the third year in a row, Parker’s will serve as the presenting sponsor and has selected the theme “Hollywood in the Park.”\nPeople who attend are encouraged to design creative picnic spreads inspired by the theme, including classic films, favorite actors, unforgettable movie moments and iconic celebrity style. Participants can enter the annual Picnic in the Park contest for the chance to win $500, $250 and $100 Parker’s cards.\n“Once again, we’re delighted to host the popular Picnic in the Park Contest, which is a highlight of this annual event,” said Greg Parker, president and CEO of Parker Companies. “We’re always amazed by the creativity of the picnickers, from their imaginative costumes to their elaborate theme décor.”\nFor Robert Rund, the Philharmonic’s executive director, the 2015 Picnic in the Park will be his first.\n“It’s a little different than it has been in the past,” he says. “We have taken in the terms of production that were done by the city in the past.\n“Picnic in the Park is now contracted from the city to the Philharmonic to produce. This year, it is our staff who is working with those contracted to everything from the rental of restrooms to hiring police officers, so it’s a pretty big project for us.”\nBut a fun project, Rund adds.\n“Picnic in the Park is a beloved Savannah tradition,” he says. “We’re looking forward to a great night filled with great music.\n“At the Savannah Philharmonic, we firmly believe that arts and culture should be for everyone — this is our Philharmonic,” Rund says. “To that end, Picnic in the Park is just one part of our robust community outreach program.”\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: Picnic in the Park\nWhen: 4-9 p.m. Oct. 4\nWhere: Forsyth Park\nCost: Free\nInfo: 912-232-6002, www.savannahphilharmonic.org , info@savannahphilharmonic.org\nSCHEDULE\n4 p.m.: Esther Garrison School for the Performing & Visual Arts Band & Orchestra\n4:45 p.m.: Savannah Arts Academy Chorus\n5:30 p.m.: Velvet Caravan\n7 p.m.: Welcome\n7:10 p.m.: First half of Savannah Philharmonic concert\n7:55 p.m.: Intermission\n8:15 p.m.: Second half of Savannah Philharmonic concert", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "https://bit.ly/ZyZaur", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14767965.jpg", "https://bit.ly/ZyZ8mc)", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14766676.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14767963.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14767965.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14766676.jpg", "https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/dosavannah/id626862925?ls=1&mt=8", "https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=hr.apps.n53744379", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif", "http://i.imgur.com/2Ix6dHF.png", "https://bit.ly/Ke006c", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14767963.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T20:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:02:02.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
