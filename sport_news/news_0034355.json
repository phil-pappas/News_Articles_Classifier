Indianapolis won 27-20.(AP Photo/Patric Schneider) \nINDIANAPOLIS (AP) — Colts quarterback Andrew Luck returned to full participation for Monday’s practice for the first time in two weeks. \nHe is still day-to-day with a sore right shoulder and had been limited in practice since leading Indianapolis to a 35-33 win at Tennessee on Sept. 27. The Colts (3-2) host defending Super Bowl champion New England (4-0) on Sunday night. \nLuck says he is hopeful to play against the Patriots after missing the last two games — at Houston last Thursday and Jacksonville last Sunday. \nLuck wouldn’t go into detail about what exactly he did in practice and Colts coach Chuck Pagano didn’t reveal much either.
