In other news, the NHL’s Hockeyville USA game was unsurprisingly below last year’s regular season levels, and Golf Channel had its most-watched third quarter since becoming Nielsen rated. Rare Bump For NASCAR Xfinity Series NASCAR Xfinity Series racing from Kentucky drew 933,000 viewers on NBCSN Saturday night, up 32% from last year (708K) and up 12% from 2013 (837K), both of which aired on ESPNEWS. Despite the rare increase, the race tied the smallest Xfinity Series audience of the season (27 telecasts) — matching Richmond two weeks earlier. (via ShowBuzz Daily ) Under 250K For Hockeyville USA Tuesday’s Penguins/Lightning NHL preseason game, the centerpiece of the league’s Hockeyville USA program, drew 239,000 viewers on NBCSN. By comparison, the network’s regular season games last year averaged 349,000. A broadcast of the movie Slapshot , which was filmed in the same arena in which the game took place, drew 91,000 viewers immediately afterward. (via Sports TV Ratings ) Golf Channel Has Top Third Quarter Golf Channel averaged 114,000 total day viewers during the third quarter of the year, up 8% from last year (106K), up 2% from 2013 (112K) and the network’s most-watched third quarter since becoming Nielsen rated in 2006. Viewership has increased 54% from third quarter 2010, the year before Golf Channel became part of NBC Sports Group (74K).
