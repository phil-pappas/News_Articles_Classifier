The same as an NBA All-Star’s.\nFrom his 24th-floor penthouse overlooking downtown Boston — formerly rented by the Celtics’ Rajon Rondo — 26-year-old Amherst grad Saahil Sud made more than $1 million playing daily fantasy football during Week 3 of the NFL, MMQB.com wrote in a feature on the rapidly booming business. \nWorking on three computer screens from his “lab” in the two-bedroom condo, Sud expects to earn more than $5 million this year as the top-ranked Daily Fantasy Sports player in the world, according to RotoGrinders.com. \n“People say guys like me bastardized fantasy,” Sud says. “I’m sure that people have said the same thing about the stock market when algorithmic trading came out. ‘They’re cheating.’ I can understand where they are coming from, but any time there is money to be made, people are going to find the fastest and smartest ways to do it, whatever way that is.”\nUnlike most participants, Sud enters hundreds of lineups every week, having devised a program which compiles box scores, weather sites and advanced statistics, as well as his own instincts. He spends eight hours per day programming during the offseason.\nSud said he risks roughly $140,000 per day and usually sees an 8 percent return, estimating he loses money on 30 percent of days.\nMixed in are rare windfalls like Week 3, when Sud earned about 10 times more than Packers receiver Randall Cobb (roughly $100,000 for the game), whose three-touchdown game against the Chiefs produced Sud’s massive payout.\n“What? Hey, man, I’ve got to start collecting my money from these guys,” Cobb joked to MMQB.com. “If I’m on your team and I’m making you money, I need a paycheck for that. Help me out, man!”\nAnd for so many years, it’s been fans envying the players’ checkbooks.\n  fantasy football", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:04:18.286+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
