(AP) - Packers right tackle Bryan Bulaga could return for Sunday's game against St. Louis after missing the last three weeks with a left knee injury.\nCoach Mike McCarthy says Bulaga is doing well after the first two days of practice. Bulaga says he won't talk about Sunday, though he is happy with his progress.\nGreen Bay is off Friday and practices Saturday.\nGetting Bulaga back would boost a front five that must match up against the Rams' tough defensive front.\nBulaga missed the 2013 season with a torn ligament in his left knee. He says rehab for the latest injury has gone well. When asked if he was optimistic about Bulaga's availability for Sunday, McCarthy said \"So far, so good, yes.\"\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
