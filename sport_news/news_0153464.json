Rich, shows his love for the Blue Jays with playoff anthem. Related Stories Orioles beat Blue Jays' backups for 2nd straight day \nWell Toronto, it's been less than 24 hours since your Blue Jays clinched a division title and already the fan-made-videos are dominating the interwebs. \nThe phenomenon started in August and has only gained momentum since; much like the team they're so desperately rooting for. There are tons of amazing videos out there but these are our five favourites at CBCSports. \n1. #WeTheNorth Jays Edition \nThis new take on the Raptors promo is exactly what the \"We The North\" slogan is all about: the fans are the team. It was an incredibly successful marketing campaign that youtuber Scott Ewing Jaysified to give us all of the feels. \n2. Drawing inspiration from pop stars \nCanadian musicians Aaron Pollock and Swift Oliver took Taylor Swift's platinum hit \"22\" and parodied it into a Blue Jays playoff anthem. And they're not wrong, it sure does feel like '92. \n3. Blank space or pennant race? \nAnother day, another T-Swift/Jays parody video. This gem came from singer/songwriter Adam Jesin and we gotta say, it may take the cake in the Swift-off. \n4. All of the hype \nSometimes all you need is a good pumpup video and that's exactly what Jorey Perry provided. It has homeruns, diving catches and most importantly a huge bass drop. \n5. Wait, is that Kelly Gruber? \nThe guys who brought you \" Out for a Rip \" are back killing it with a new Jays anthem. They have the fans, they captured the the fever and they even featured a legend. \nGot any more awesome fan videos?
