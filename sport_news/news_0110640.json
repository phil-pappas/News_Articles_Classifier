The C’s got what they wanted from their kids — and from some of their older players as well — shooting 51.3 percent overall in a 111-105 preseason win against Brooklyn last night.\nRookie Terry Rozier, out last week with a sore knee, had 16 points and six assists in his first game against NBA competition. Ten-year veteran Amir Johnson added 15 points, while Kelly Olynyk had 14.\nWith David Lee (strep throat), Jae Crowder (injured thumb) and Isaiah Thomas (sore shin) out for the Celts, and Joe Johnson, Brook Lopez, Jarrett Jack and Thaddeus Young left off the trip for the Nets, this was, in many ways, a glorified scrimmage — albeit with dancers, video-board fun during timeouts and paying fans.\nRozier gave them something to talk about, starting with his first field-goal attempt in the Garden, a driving, soaring near-dunk on which the 6-foot-1 powder keg was fouled by Justin Harper. He missed the two free throws but came back in the final seconds of the opening quarter to hit two others from the line, stick an 18-footer and steal an inbound pass.\nRozier canned all three of his treys and had four steals and just one turnover in 28 minutes.\n“You get out what you put in,” he said of his long-distance marksmanship. “I’ve been putting in a lot of work shooting 3’s. A lot of people said I was going to struggle with that. . . . I worked on it, so it’s starting to carry over to the games.”\nMarcus Smart (nine points, four assists) came back from a bout with strep throat and looked a lot more point guard-like than in his rookie season. Smart had three assists in eight first-quarter minutes, attacked the basket more and added a two-handed, follow-up jam in the second quarter.\nThe C’s went ahead by 10 early in the fourth before they committed five turnovers in a span of 1:25 to allow the Nets to get within 92-90.\nR.J. Hunter, who had two of those turnovers, then broke the fall with a right-to-left baseline reverse layup. Later, James Young took a transition pass up from Rozier and, without hesitation, drilled a 3-pointer from the right wing. Young hit another trey soon after to restore the margin to 10.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:11:24.779+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
