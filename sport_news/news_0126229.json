The Grizzlies remain undefeated and are ranked sixth in Class 1A in the Associated Press Washington Prep Football poll. On the other end of the spectrum, Aberdeen is still looking for its first win of the season. \nHoquiam takes its perfect record on the road to face 2A Rochester this week. When the dust settles in Stewart Field on Friday, either Aberdeen or Forks will have won its first league game. \nMontesano, whose only 1A loss came to Hoquiam, hosts a tough Tenino team. The Beavers have been ranked most of the season and are coming off a gut-wrenching 42-41 loss to Eatonville. \nElma will make the long road trip to Eatonville. The Cruisers are the defending Evergreen 2A/1A League champs, but are currently 2-3 in league and are outside the postseason positions, which the Eagles still have a chance to get into. \nHOQUIAM-ROCHESTER \nThe Grizzlies have been road warriors this season with big road wins against Meridian, Eatonville and Montesano. Hoquiam will face its final road test of the regular season this week with a trip to Rochester. The Grizzlies are undefeated and state-ranked, but they aren’t letting their any outside forces take their focus off the task at hand. \n“We don’t talk about what the papers say and I always tell them, ‘It is what they write after the game,’” HHS head coach Rick Moore said. “If you win a big game, you get another big game.” \nThe Warriors bring both size and strength to the contest. Montesano defeated Rochester, 36-15, last week, but both of the Warriors’ touchdowns came on long pass plays. Tiki Hickle, a transfer from Elma, was on the receiving end of 45 and 60-yard touchdown passes. \n“(Rochester) has good speed at some of the skill positions,” Moore said. “Their quarterback is very quick and throws well on the run. Their running backs run hard and are quick and they have two decent receivers that they like throwing the ball to. We are going to have to be scrappy on defense and be able to execute and have some series where we chew a little more clock offensively.” \nRochester quarterback Nicholas Taylor was 10-for-21 passing against Monte last week for 201 yards. The Warriors added 83 total yards on the ground. \nHoquiam had a slow start against Forks last week with three turnovers, a blocked punt and 50-yards in penalties in the first half against the Spartans. The Grizzlies settled down for a 35-point third quarter and beat Forks, 56-7. \n“It could be coming off the big game,” Moore said. “I’ve been there before as a player and a coach. You come off that big game and you deflate a little and it is hard to generate that emotion with the next game. But they remembered what they needed to do and we got over that.” \nMoore cited Jordan Sears, Trystan Skorzewski and Tahj Malone for their defensive performances as well as Jerod Steen and Ryan Espedal for their work on offense last week. With the letup in the first half against Forks being a wake-up call of sorts for the Grizzlies, Moore said he doesn’t expect a slow start on Friday. \n“We have to block more efficiently on offense and catch the ball,” Moore said. “Defensively, we have to stop the run. We will have to throw the road warrior jerseys on again. It is just play how we play and things should fall into place.” \nFORKS-ABERDEEN \nAfter leading a game for the first time this season last week, the Bobcats are looking to put a complete performance together against Forks. \nThe Spartans operate a spread offense, lining up in the pistol formation several times. Forks is led by sophomore quarterback Cole Baysinger, who attempted 35 passes against Hoquiam last week. The Spartans were able to gain 183 yards through the air against the Grizzlies, but finished with negative-23 yards of net rushing. Running back Kenny Gale has been effective for Forks at times this season. Against Elma, the junior rushed for 131 yards. \nDefensively, the Spartans are led by linebacker Jack Dahlgren. \n“They have big guys up front,” Aberdeen head coach Kevin Ridout said. “Their receivers and quarterback are skilled guys. They are pretty consistent in what they do and they will probably throw the ball around 30 times. Their running game is a semi-zone blocking. Their running is not overly sophisticated, but it is all premised on their short passing game.” \nRidout said the defensive concentration for the Bobcats will actually be on stopping the pass first and making the Spartans run the ball. Aberdeen limited Elma’s rushing attack to 163 yards last week. Ridout cited his defensive front of Michael Torres, Skyler Murray, Joel Krebs, Braden Castleberry-Taylor, Kenny Wheeler, Justin Baldwin, Tyler Johnson and Elias Jimenez for their efforts against the Eagles and he expects them to come up big against the Spartans. \n“We have pretty much handled everybody’s running attack, with the exception of Montesano, so my thought is that we have to stop the pass first,” Ridout said. “We have to make them want to run the ball.” \nWhile the Bobcats are still without a win, Ridout said the players continue to put in hard work, including 6:30 a.m. weightlifting sessions, and he expects the wins to come soon. \n“I’ve ran these guys harder than I’ve ran any group in my 29-year career,” Ridout said. “We have worked them hard and they are still battling. We like what we see and we just have to believe that Aberdeen football is going to be dominate in the future. Any win is a good win, but right now it would be overly special. It would give us some momentum going into the final week. It would be a verification of hard work and dedication to a program.” Rules for posting comments \nComments posted below are from readers.
