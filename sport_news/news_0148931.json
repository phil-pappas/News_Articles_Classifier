A few bare-chested students spelled out \"LETS GO\" and some others began a half-hearted chant of \"Undefeated!\" in the game's final minute.\nThis team deserves far more.\nThis could be the nation's premier defense, having yielded just 35 points — and three touchdowns — in its five victories, three against Power Five teams.\nAsked about the shutout, Igwebuike replied: \"That's what we expect as a defense. Going out and just dominating.\"\nI asked Fitzgerald, the defensive star of the 1995 team that went to the Rose Bowl, how the two defenses compare.\n\"I have every chapter of that group in '95,\" he said. \"I'm not ready to even put this group in the same category. We have a lot of chapters left to write. But if they continue to progress, I think it has a chance to be much better. It's much more athletic; it's much deeper.\n\"The challenge is: Will we continue to put weight on the bar, so to speak? As you go up in Big Ten play, it gets heavier and heavier and harder and harder. The potential is there to be something we'll be very proud of.\"\nFitzgerald normally revels in pointing out his team's flaws. After beating Stanford, he criticized players for their body language. The Duke victory brought on this: \"We blocked atrociously on the perimeter. Our wide receivers were awful.\"\nBut after being asked Saturday about limiting Minnesota to converting only 4 of 16 third downs, Fitzgerald replied: \"If you include the fourth-down (attempts), they were 4 of 20. That's pretty dominant. I know Hank (defensive coordinator Mike Hankwitz) and the guys will be pretty mad about the four they got. All we'll talk about (Sunday) will be why we didn't go 20-for-20.\"\nWow. How's that for confidence?\nNorthwestern's missing link has been its passing game. The strategy regarding redshirt freshman quarterback Clayton Thorson heading into Saturday seemed to be: Don't blow it, kid. But Thorson was terrific against the Gophers.\nIt took a rugby-style scrum to tackle him on a 5-yard gain in the second quarter. His read-option keeper gave Northwestern its first touchdown a few minutes later. And on a fourth-and-7 completion to Mike McHugh, he took a big hit just after firing a perfect strike.\n\"Amazing growth,\" receiver Christian Jones said. \"I think Clayton could be one of the greatest to play here, honestly.\"\nThat comment startled Igwebuike, who was sitting next to Jones. The two chuckled.\nHey, if there was ever a day to make grandiose statements and comparisons, this was it.\ntgreenstein@tribpub.com\nTwitter @TeddyGreenstein\nPrivacy Policy College Football Northwestern Wildcats College Sports Big Ten Minnesota Golden Gophers Rose Bowl Game Ohio State Buckeyes", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56107437/turbine/ct-colleges-northwestern-fitzgerald-video-spt-20151003", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56106cdf/turbine/ct-pat-fitzgerald-greenstein-northwestern-football-spt-1004-20151003"], "published": "2015-10-04T04:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T10:44:45.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
