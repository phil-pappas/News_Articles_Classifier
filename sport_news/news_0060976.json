Peru and Chile is a South American classic, and fans will see two starkly different teams on the pitch Tuesday. \nChile has established itself as probably the best team of the continent in 2015. In June, while hosting the 2015 Copa America, they took the title against Argentina convincingly. This was Argentina’s second consecutive final loss in an international tournament in as many years. Argentina lost the 2014 World Cup final to Germany. \nWhen you watch Peru vs. Chile live streaming on Tuesday, you will see whether Chile manager Jorge Sampaoli’s decision to play injured Arsenal striker Alexis Sanchez will cost him. According to the Mirror , Sampaoli admitted he played Sanchez for 90 minutes knowing he was not at 100 percent.

The Arsenal medical team conveyed their concern that Sanchez may aggravate his injury during his participation in the qualifiers to Sampaoli. \n“Alexis arrived not at his top form, with pain in the abductor. \n“He couldn’t play at 100 percent, but we thought that for us him not playing was to give too much advantage to our rivals because his presence in our team makes things difficult for our opponents.” \nWhen fans watch Peru vs. Chile live streaming, they will see how Chile performs on the road in Lima. Undoubtedly, the Copa America champions looked very strong, and experts believe they have a good chance to finish at the top of the standings after the group stage is complete. \nChile will try to carry out this by taking advantage of Argentina and Brazil’s woes. Both superpowers lost their 2018 World Cup qualifier openers to their fans’ dismay, which opens the door for the next best thing: Chile. \nIn its earlier qualifier match, Peru lost to Colombia, which is missing yet another superstar, James Rodriguez. The last time Peru and Chile faced off competitively was at the 2015 Copa America semifinals, where Chile prevailed 2-1 and went on to win the title, while Peru finished in third place. \nWatch Peru vs. Chile live streaming to see if striker Paolo Guerrero can tie Peru’s all-time top goal scorer, Teófilo Cubillas. The legendary player scored 26 goals in 81 appearances, with Guererro hot on his heels in second place with 25 goals in 65 games. Teodoro Fernández came in third with 24 goals in 32 games, according to the Latin Post .

We want to finish among the top places and give the people a reason to cheer. \nEven though Peru is a weaker team, they are not to be underestimated and left a positive impression in the 2015 Copa America. However, Ricardo Gareca’s team will attempt to qualify for the World Cup finals for the first time since 1982. \nWatch Peru vs. Chile live streaming free on October 13 here .
