Unfortunately, that quickly became the case at the Rogers Centre Wednesday night following a controversial call. \nThe Rangers were credited with one of the most bizarre runs you will ever see in the seventh inning. You can see the play and read a good breakdown here . After Texas took a 3-2 lead because of the ruling, Blue Jays fans began throwing food and drinks toward the field — some of them from the upper deck. \nAt one point, a woman was shown on camera shielding her baby from flying objects. \nFortunately, it does not sound like the baby was injured and Toronto police were able to identify the person responsible. @abalkovec @BlueJays @TorontoPolice FYI:The baby sprayed with some beer. Police have made an arrest and charges are expected.^dh \n— Toronto Police OPS (@TPSOperations) October 15, 2015 \nWe don’t need to get into a big lecture about how idiotic it is to launch objects from the upper deck at a baseball game. As you may have seen, tempers also flared later on the field when the benches cleared . The Blue Jays ended up winning, but there’s no excuse for how some of the fans acted. A woman having to shield her baby from danger is a perfect example of how stupid fans can be.
