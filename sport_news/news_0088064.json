He used to coach me growing up,\" Sanchez said. \"So he's like, 'you did it to us again.'\" \nThe midfielder also assisted Taysia Snead for the first goal of the game with 36:03 left in the first half. \n\"Sanchez does a hell of a job for us all the time,\" Liberty coach Scott Rodenbach said. \nSanchez says she played for Eaton until she was 11 years old and owes a lot of her soccer skills to him. \n\"He taught me everything I know,\" Sanchez said. \"So he knows my strengths and weaknesses. But it's still a friendly competition so it's fun.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T01:51:34.696+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
