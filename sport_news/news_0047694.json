The previous year, when winning the Premier League, City lost 22.9 million pounds. \nCity had previously been fined by UEFA for breaching Financial Fair Play rules as it spent heavily to catch up with rivals with a more sustained record of success. \nCity reduced its wage bill to 193.5 million pounds and City generated a club-record 351.8 million pounds in 2014-15, closing in on Manchester United, whose turnover was 395 million pounds in the same period.
