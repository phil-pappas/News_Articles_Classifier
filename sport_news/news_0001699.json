Stephanie Marcus Entertainment Editor, Huffington Post Posted: 10/20/2015 09:56 AM EDT | Edited: 24 minutes ago \nKhloe Kardashian has paused her relationship with Houston Rockets shooting guard James Harden , according to TMZ. \nSources told the website the 31-year-old reality star chose to take a break from Harden while she's dealing with estranged husband Lamar Odom's health issues. \nKardashian filed for divorce from Odom back in 2013 . Though both parties finally signed papers to officially end their marriage in July 2015 , it recently came to light that the two are still legally married since a judge has yet to finalize the divorce. \nWhile Kardashian has had other relationships since splitting from Odom -- previously dating rapper French Montana before Harden -- sources told TMZ it's clear she still has feelings for Odom. \nAs for Harden, who was first linked to Kardashian in July , sources told People magazine that he's being \"as supportive as humanly possible given the situation.\" \n\"Lamar essentially has zero consistent family other than the Kardashians, and James understands that. The last thing he would want to do would be to add more stress to her plate,\" the source said. \nMeanwhile, things are looking up for Odom, who was discharged from the Las Vegas hospital where he's been recovering for the past week and was transferred to a Los Angeles medical facility for additional treatment and therapy on Monday. \nA rep for Kardashian did not immediately return The Huffington Post's request for comment. \nAlso on HuffPost:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T16:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:27:33.126+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
