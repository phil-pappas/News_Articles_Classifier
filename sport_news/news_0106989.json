(AP) - West Virginia's Republican attorney general is criticizing President Barrack Obama for what he calls the Democrat's assault on the state's struggling coal industry.\nAttorney General Patrick Morrisey scolded the president ahead of his visit to Charleston on Wednesday to address West Virginia's devastating drug overdose death rate - the highest in the nation.\nWhile Morrisey commends Obama for taking on the issue, he takes the president to task on his policies regarding coal. The Obama administration has pushed environmental regulations aimed at coal-fired plants to reduce emissions contributing to climate change.\nIn a statement, Morrisey calls those policies an \"illegal, unprecedented regulatory assault\" on the coal industry. He blames the administration for closed coal mines and countless job losses.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
