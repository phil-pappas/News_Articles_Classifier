Ed Wisneski Special to the Courier PRESCOTT - Ask Tri-City College Prep soccer coach Matt Maxwell about the foot-long scars and six perforation marks on his left leg, and he'll joke that they're from a fight with an alligator, a large shark, or some other adversary with claws or big teeth. The actual painful details would take too long to describe. \"I just tell them something and move on,\" Maxwell, 33, says with a laugh.Even if he took time to recount the true story, the improbable series of events would seem just as unreal as his tall tales. Who would believe that ligaments from a corpse kick-started his remarkable recovery?The fact that the former first-team all-state soccer goalkeeper from Sedona Red Rock High School even has a left leg, let alone can run on it, is a testament to his indomitable spirit, innovative and talented surgeons, and support from his family which refused to allow amputation of his mangled limb 15 years ago when he crashed his 2000 Yamaha YZ 125 motorcycle during a practice run at Canyon Raceway in Peoria.Maxwell had been wearing almost all the protective gear - helmet, chest protector, kidney belt, goggles, gloves, and boots. But he didn't use knee braces. \"If I had on knee braces,\" he says, \"I might have just had a broken bone and been fine.\"Instead, Maxwell tore every acronym in his left knee - ACL, MCL, PCL - as well as his patella tendon. He fractured his tibial plateau, a critical weight-bearing area in the shin. The patella was shattered. His knee folded backwards. He popped his popliteal artery, which is the lower section of the femoral artery, one of the largest in the body and the primary means through which blood circulates in the legs. His left leg ballooned from internal bleeding that was building up pressure. It's called compartment syndrome.Maxwell's injuries were life-threatening. His brother Josh, a paramedic, knew it. Fortunately, he was at the scene of the accident and insisted that Matt be transported by helicopter to the trauma unit at John C. Lincoln Memorial Hospital in Phoenix. In all probability, that decision saved his life. \"I learned later from the doctors that if I had arrived [at the hospital] five minutes later, I might not have made it,\" says Maxwell. Because of his massive blood loss and catastrophic injuries, the vascular surgeon wanted to amputate, Maxwell says. Josh called their father Bill, a captain in the Sedona Fire Department, as he was speeding south to the hospital in the early-morning hours. Maxwell had been riding his motorcycle around midnight to avoid the heat. \"Absolutely not,\" Bill said. \"Do anything to stabilize his leg and we'll figure it out.\" Josh relayed the message to the doctors. The vascular surgeon performed an operation to graft the great saphenous vein from his right leg to the femoral artery in his left leg. Removal of that vein does not hinder normal circulation in the leg because the blood will flow through other channels in a phenomenon known as collateral circulation, according to the Heart and Vascular Institute at Johns Hopkins University.\"The doctor flipped the vein over and attached it to the artery,\" says Maxwell, who has a scar from the top of his knee to his groin on his right leg. \"This stopped the internal bleeding and restored circulation to my left leg,\" That was the first of many operations. Maxwell remained in the Phoenix hospital for nearly two months.\"I didn't remember anything from five minutes before the accident to two weeks after the accident while I was in the ICU [intensive care unit],\" recalls Maxwell, who had also suffered a concussion. \"I'd wake up and ask my parents what happened. Then I'd forget what they said and ask them again. They told me the story over and over for weeks.\" One night, disaster struck. Maxwell recalls falling out of bed on his left leg, dislocating his knee, and twisting his foot. \"Somehow I got up and crawled back to bed to reach the nurse call button,\" says Maxwell. \"The tibia and fibula had fallen out of the socket and were pressing against the nerves feeding the lower part of my leg. I was in the most excruciating pain. It felt like my foot was on fire and worms were crawling through my leg.\"Eventually, Dr. Geoffrey Cook, an orthopedic specialist in Sedona, performed surgery at Verde Valley Medical Center to straighten and stabilize Maxwell's now re-dislocated leg.\"The bones in my shin had dropped down two inches and had rotated internally because my knee was dislocated,\" Maxwell says. \"They were starting to heal in that position.\"Dr. Cook maneuvered his bones back into place and clamped an external fixation device to his leg to prevent another dislocation. \"Eight-inch pins were mounted into my bones,\" Maxwell says. \"They were connected by a rod. That's where the six marks on my leg come from.\" Maxwell's parents proactively searched for the next possible options. They sent their son's medical records and biography to orthopedic surgeons throughout the country. One suggested fusing his knee and amputating his foot. That was rejected. The family went to see Dr. Robert Pedowitz, then the Chief of Sports Medicine and Residency Director for the Department of Orthopedic Surgery at University of California-San Diego. Maxwell says Dr. Pedowitz told him that \"people didn't keep legs like mine.\"\"He said that if anyone tells you they've seen or worked on a leg this bad before, they're lying,\" Maxwell recalls. \"He was very straightforward. He told me he thought he could get me walking, but I'd never run or play sports. I'd never be active like I was before. He didn't want to give me false hopes.\" Dr. Pedowitz put Maxwell in the cadaver program. That doesn't mean what it seems. \"He [Dr. Pedowitz] took three ligaments from a dead person and put them into my leg,\" says Maxwell, who remained in a wheelchair or on crutches for nearly two years before he was done with all his subsequent surgeries.Despite all his medical problems, Maxwell was able to keep up with his schoolwork at home and graduate with his class in 2001. When he heard his name called at the graduation ceremony, he slowly made his way on crutches toward Mrs. Covington McBride, the principal.\"I got to within four feet of her,\" Maxwell recalls as tears well up in his eyes. \"I dropped my crutches and took three steps to get my diploma. The audience started cheering. It was one of the biggest moments of my life. My friends rushed the stage and carried me back to my seat.\"Maxwell enrolled at Northern Arizona University , where he eventually improved enough to play intramural soccer. He remembers watching a man walk with a limp in downtown Flagstaff and how much that made an impact on him.\"I promised myself to do everything I could not to walk that way,\" Maxwell says. \"I forced myself to walk properly, no matter how painful it was. I have drop foot syndrome. My toes just fall. I trip over my big toe about 30 times a day if I don't pay attention.\" Maxwell left NAU to become an emergency medical technician and then a paramedic, eventually working on helicopters like the one that carried him to the trauma unit when he was 17 years old.\"I wanted to give back to others like my brother had given to me and others,\" he says. After six years as a paramedic, Maxwell established a home and commercial building inspection business in Prescott called Silver Hammer Inspections. \"Crawling around an attic isn't as difficult as curling up in the corner of a helicopter working on someone,\" he says.Maxwell and his wife Carissa have been married 10 years and have three children. They still deal with some of his lingering pain and sensitive nerves from the accident.\"I constantly sleep with an ice pack,\" Maxwell says. \"I know I'm going to have a knee replacement in two years. I still don't have any feeling below my left knee.\"Despite these obstacles, Maxwell has become an athlete again.He says he can outrun 90 percent of his players on his Tri-City College Prep soccer team...although his knee aches for days after he races them. He plays in indoor soccer and softball leagues. He snowboards. He surfs. He hikes and plays golf...\"lots of golf,\" he says. \"I have only one life to live, and I don't want to live it in fear of something bad happening,\" Maxwell says. \"Success comes from pushing yourself beyond what even you thought was possible.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:17:41.245+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
