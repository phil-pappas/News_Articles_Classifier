He was on the court shooting baskets before Wednesday's preseason game at the United Center.\nRose's left eye was still visibly swollen, but he shot the ball well. Rose suffered a broken left eye socket in the first practice of training camp on Sept. 29.\n\"He still won't do any contact for at least the next several days,\" coach Fred Hoiberg told reporters at the morning shootaround. \"Don't know exactly how long that will be, but he's cleared to ride the bike and get a sweat going, so I know he's excited about that.\"\nHoiberg said Rose has been fitted for a protective face mask, which he will likely wear when he returns to the court. The Bulls are unsure if Rose will be able to play in the regular-season opener Oct. 27.\n\"He's still got some issues a little bit with his vision,\" Hoiberg said. \"But I think just the fact that he can start getting back to activity is huge for him. It's big for his confidence. So hopefully we'll get him back on the practice court here soon.\"\nBig lineup returns: The Bulls used Pau Gasol and Joakim Noah together Wednesday for the first time in the preseason. Both players have missed games for various reasons.\nBefore the contest, Detroit coach Stan Van Gundy was asked whether two bigs can work in today's NBA.\n\"I think when Gasol and Noah are on the floor together, it's pretty good,\" Van Gundy said. \"I think when Zach Randolph and Marc Gasol are on the floor together it's been very, very good in Memphis.\n\"I think people have focused on everybody going small, when I really think the focus, to me, watching it is the need for versatility and the need to play a lot of different ways. You're going to have to go in and play Memphis with two big guys. Then you have to go and play Indiana, who's playing Paul George at the four. Can you do that?\"\nSVG likes Portis: Stan Van Gundy also serves as team president, so he took a good look at Bulls rookie Bobby Portis before the draft.\n\"He's a guy we really liked heading into the draft,\" Van Gundy said. \"I'm not surprised with how well he's playing. He's one of the true inside-outside bigs you can get. He's good on the block, but he can step out and shoot the ball with range.\n\"You don't see much of that. There a very few of those guys -- Kevin Love, Chris Bosh. There just aren't many guys who have that, and Bobby does.\n\"Plus, my impression of him going into the draft is he's just a no-nonsense, hard-playing guy who's out there to win games. They got a good one. We were a little surprised he lasted so long in the draft, but it worked out for Chicago.\"\nPortis ranks third in the NBA in rebounds during the preseason, with 12.3 per game. Detroit chose small forward Stanley Johnson with the No. 8 overall pick.\nThoughts with Odom: Stan Van Gundy paid tribute to ailing former NBA forward Lamar Odom before Wednesday's game.\n\"It's just really rough thinking about it,\" said Van Gundy, who coached Odom in Miami. \"The guy's had such a hard life in a lot of ways and was still such a positive person. He doesn't deserve this, he really doesn't, and it's really, really sad. Tough to deal with.\"\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
