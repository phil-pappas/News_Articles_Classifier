Pic/Getty Images \nVijender won the contest with a few seconds left in the third of the four-round bout via Technical Knockout, pushing Whiting literally on to the ropes and smacking him with a combination of jabs and uppercuts before the referee stepped in to stop the contest.\nStrolling in confidently to the beats of Punjabi song, the 29-year-old hardly looked a debutant as he got down to business against Whiting.\nIn fact, it was Whiting, who looked timid and unsure of what to do against the clinical Indian. Nimble-footed and precise, Vijender used his long reach to full advantage against his 26-year-old rival, who is himself merely four-bouts old in the pro circuit.\n\"Thanks to all my fans. My next fight will be Oct 30 in Harrow, enjoy it. It's new for me, but I've been working hard. It's going well, I want to win! That's just the beginning,\" said the Haryana-lad after a resounding start to his pro career.\n\n\nVijender Singh celebrates after winning his debut bout. Pics/PTI \nVijender treaded cautiously to start with, taking a measure of Whiting in the opening three minutes. However, that did not stop him from landing a few clean jabs to clinch the initiative.\nThe Indian grew in confidence in the second round against the erratic Whiting, whose attacking strategy went haywire with every passing second.\nVijender dominates \nVijender, on the other hand, was a picture of composure despite the home fans loudly cheering for the local favourite. Moving quite literally like a butterfly, India's first Olympic and World Championships medallist stung quite hard, smashing through his opponent's defences with the razor-sharp accuracy.\n\n\nVijender Singh is all smiles before his bout \n\"I am very happy for this win. It's just a beginning as I have to go a long way. I will work harder and have to be Professional champion one day,\" Vijender said.\n\"I never got nervous during the bout. My punches have replied to Sonny Whiting in the ring. It's new for me, but I have been working hard. Its going well. I want to win, win and win,\" declared India's greatest ever boxer.\nThe effort put in to improve his jabbing by his renowned trainer Lee Beard was there to be seen as Vijender had Whiting scurrying for cover.\nHis foot movement remarkably rhythmic, Vijender pummelled Whiting in the second round with his combination of hooks and jabs.\nIn contrast, Whiting could never really get going and match his tall claims.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:40:30.928+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
