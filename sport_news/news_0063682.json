She is author of 15 books, most recently “Drinking in America: Our Secret History” (Twelve). She spoke with Marc Myers.\nMy relationship with my late father, novelist John Cheever , was complicated. At our family home in Ossining, N.Y., we read together, we sometimes drank together and we frequently fought. Alcohol played a big role in our house, as it did in many suburban homes in the 1960s.\nMy first memory of the house was a phone call from my mother in January 1961, while I was at boarding school. I was 17, and my parents wanted to fly me home to see the house they planned to buy. That’s how excited they were. I flew down and loved it immediately.\nMore House Call\nDick Van Dyke’s Funny Family Rocker Chrissie Hynde’s Confessions of a ‘Normal’ Childhood Judy Collins Recalls Her Early Struggles The two-story, five-bedroom house was built in 1799 by a Hudson River boatman named Benjamin B. Acker and renovated in 1928. It was built into a hill and sat on 5 acres. From the living room, you looked out across a little private valley with a brook and up past birch trees to an orchard. It was peaceful and idyllic.\nENLARGE The Ossining home where her family moved in 1961 and ‘gave great parties,’ Ms. Cheever says. Photo: Susan Cheever We first lived in a two-bedroom rental apartment at 400 East 59th St. [in Manhattan], which grew tight when my brother, Ben, was born in 1948. Then in 1951 we moved into a house my parents rented in Scarborough, N.Y., about 45 minutes north of the city.\nBy the early 1950s, my father had published nearly 100 short stories, most of them in the New Yorker magazine, where his work had appeared since 1935. Everything changed in 1956, when at age 45, he sold his first novel, “The Wapshot Chronicle.” In 1956, we courageously moved to an apartment in Rome for a year.\nWhen we returned, my father won the National Book Award , which established him as a major novelist. With the money he had earned on the book, my parents took out a mortgage for the Ossining house, which at the time sold for just under $50,000.\nFor my father and for all of us, the house was the house that affirmed at last that we were the people we thought we were. My mother, Mary, was a wonderful cook; her domain was our kitchen.\nMy father had a superstitious fear of having a permanent writer’s study. He’d set up his typewriter in whatever room was empty. Once, when we were all home, he wrote in a tent on the terrace outside my room. He felt the way to invite the muse was to stay on the run.\nMy parents gave great parties—the kind that Jay Gatsby should have had. Every writer imaginable was at the house, including Robert Penn Warren, Saul Bellow and John Updike. I remember Ralph Ellison playing Bach’s “Jesu, Joy of Man’s Desiring” on the alto recorder.\nENLARGE The author with her father, John Cheever, in 1976 in Ossining, N.Y. Photo: Nancy Crampton Naturally, there was lots of drinking, and over time my father’s drinking grew worse. We had lots of stairs, which became problematic. At dinner one night, he told me not to eat butter with a fork and I told him to shut up. Upset, he left the table and headed upstairs, but couldn’t make it. You’d hear terrible slipping and thumping.\nIn 1975, my father stopped drinking—it was live or die, and our family doctor insisted on rehab. It worked. Instead, he loved having friends over and getting them drunk. I, too, became a casualty. I began to drink at college, and he took me to my first Alcoholics Anonymous meeting in 1975. I’ve been sober since 1992.\nI think my father’s motive for drinking as heavily as he did had a lot to do with the fact that he was gay, something he kept secret. Looking back, it was sad and scary.\nMy father died in 1982 and my mother died last year. I live in New York in a two-bedroom rental on the Upper East Side, and my brothers, Ben and Federico, have their own homes, so we are trying to sell the house. But most buyers want something contemporary.\nWhile cleaning out the attic last summer, we found storage boxes with 130 letters my father had written to me over the years. They are so loving and so beautiful. I’ve read all but 30. I’m saving these because I know that when I finish them, my father will truly be gone.", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV112_CHEEVE_P_20151019152804.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV114_CHEEVE_8V_20151019153158.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV112_CHEEVE_M_20151019152804.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-20T19:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T18:42:55.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
