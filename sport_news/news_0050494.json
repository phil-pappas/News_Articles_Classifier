A kayaker also assisted the injured man back to shore. Once on shore, people put the man on a surf or paddle board and used a leash as a tourniquet on his badly injured leg.\nA 911 call was received at 10:25 a.m. and the victim was already on the beach when rescue crews arrived, Enright said.\nWitnesses told officials the shark was either a tiger or Galapagos about 10-12 feet long, but officials could not confirm the species or size. A fire department helicopter spotted a shark in nearby waters about two hours after the attack. They estimated it was about 8 feet long, but they could not confirm it was the same shark that bit the surfer.\nThe man had an injury to his left leg and cuts on his hands, indicating he fought off the shark, Enright said. The man was transported to Queens Medical Center in critical condition.\nLifeguards in the area were warning visitors to stay out of the ocean. and signs have been posted along the beach. Officials say they will reassess the situation on Saturday and determine if it is safe for people to enter the water.\nBraxton Rocha, who was attacked and severely injured by a 13-foot tiger shark off the north coast of the Big Island in September, saw the news of Friday's attack and said it brought him back to what he went through.\n\"I'm speechless right now,\" he said. \"I just want to wish him a speedy recovery, and hope he gets back into the water soon. I hope what happened doesn't make him feel any differently towards sharks or the ocean.\"\nRocha required over 100 staples to close the wounds he suffered when the shark bit him while spearfishing. He said he would like to visit Friday's victim to help him in any way he can.\nThis is the fifth shark attack in Hawaii this year. One attack, which occurred in April on Maui, was fatal. All bites this year have happened in turbid or murky water.\n___\nFollow Caleb Jones : https://twitter.com/CalebAP", "external_links": ["http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apcm", "https://twitter.com/CalebAP", "http://ap.org/schemas/03/2005/apnm"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:21:45.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
