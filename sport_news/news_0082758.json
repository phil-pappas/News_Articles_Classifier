Jeff Sochko Special to The Herald Hours after details of an investigative report went public, alleging she created a “hostile work environment,” Agnes Slayman resigned as Chester County schools superintendent last week. Jeff Sochko Special to The Herald 1 of 3 Order Reprint of this Story CHESTER \nA Chester native and former Fort Mill school district superintendent will serve as Chester County schools’ interim administrative leader, officials announced Wednesday. \nChester school board trustees unanimously voted Wednesday night to pay Keith Callicutt – previously a principal and superintendent in other public school systems across South Carolina – the same daily rate as Agnes Slayman was earning until her resignation from the superintendent job last Thursday. \nAlso Wednesday, the Chester school board unanimously voted to declare outstanding employee complaints “moot,” without offering publicly further detail of those grievances. It appears that issue relates to the former superintendent, who stepped down and negotiated a $300,000 compensation package with the school board just hours after The Herald published details of an investigative report showing multiple allegations against her. \nBefore naming Callicutt interim superintendent, school board members spent about three hours meeting privately. They said they were talking with lawyers about a “contractual matter” related to Slayman, the outstanding employee grievances and possibly naming an interim superintendent. \nDuring their executive session, school trustees met with Callicutt and were impressed with his qualifications, said Denise Lawson, school board chairwoman, after the meeting. One other candidate was considered, she said. \nPast coverage: \n▪ Chester sheriff: ‘Very concerned’ about racial comments \nCallicutt led the Fort Mill school district in York County from 2005 to 2010, including shepherding through two large borrowing plans of nearly $165 million total to pay for five new schools and repairs and additions to aging and cramped facilities. Most recently, Callicutt worked in Florence County School District 3. There, he was hired as an interim superintendent but saw his contract extended to serve a total of four years. \nHis contract in Florence County expired in June, according to the district’s website. Callicutt has also previously worked in Lancaster County schools, including serving as principal for four years at Andrew Jackson High School. \nHe graduated from Chester High School in 1968. Callicutt holds a political science degree from Clemson University and graduate degrees from Winthrop University and Francis Marion University. He earned his Ph.D in educational administration from the University of South Carolina in 1999. \nChester school officials said Callicutt will start immediately. A search for a permanent superintendent will begin in coming months, Lawson said. \nThe board was looking for an interim superintendent to “hit the ground running,” she said. Slayman to remain ‘consultant’ for Chester \nCallicutt’s appointment comes nearly one week after Chester trustees accepted Slayman’s resignation and agreed to pay her the equivalent of two years’ superintendent salary. Since then, she’s commented only through her lawyer about the numerous employee accusations against her, including claims that she threatened her staff physically and made racist remarks. \nSlayman denies those allegations, her attorney has said. \nThis month, the school board has spent more than a dozen hours behind closed doors, mostly meeting with lawyers and talking about Slayman’s employment. As many as 100 people attended one of the board’s recent meetings, but since then the crowds have tapered off. \nOn Wednesday, no one other than members of the media, a board member’s spouse, and a security official attended the meeting. \nEarlier in the day, district officials released to the public a 10-page investigative report detailing allegations made against the former superintendent. It’s unclear whether Wednesday’s executive session of the board included discussion of that report. \nMore past coverage:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:03:56.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
