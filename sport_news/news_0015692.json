Jalen Watts-Jackson grabbed it with his right hand, cradled it to his body and ran a ball into the end zone that was supposed to be booted the other way. \nIn the 10 seconds it took for the clock to tick down, Watts-Jackson went from total obscurity to pulling off one of the most unlikely endings in college football as No. 7 Michigan State beat No. 12 Michigan 27-23 on Saturday in Ann Arbor. \n\"That's why football is loved so much in America,\" Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio said. \"It's because things like this happen. Every now and then, they happen.\" \nAs Watts-Jackson lay in the end zone, his teammates piled above him, his hip was dislocated in the ruckus. Watts-Jackson was later carted off the field and taken to a hospital, barely getting a glimpse of the scene he set off. \nThe game was seemingly over when Watts-Jackson found himself in perfect position to make the unbelievable play. Michigan led 23-21 with 10 seconds left when punter Blake O'Neill bobbled a low snap. As the Australian spun around to try and make the kick, he was swarmed by Spartans, and the ball popped free. \nWatts-Jackson caught it and raced 38 yards to the end zone, taking advantage of Jermaine Edmondson's blocking and powering through Jake Butt's hit just before the goal line. Advertisement \n\"You go from 10 seconds, a guy punting the ball, you're thinking OK this is done,\" Dantonio said. \"And then all of a sudden, life gets flipped upside down.\" \nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh lamented that O'Neill didn't simply handle the ball after bobbling it and fall to the ground, likely leaving the Spartans with a heave into the end zone. \n\"A mistake was made,\" Harbaugh said somberly. \"Mistakes were made. It's very unfortunate circumstances.\" \nMichigan State (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) has won seven of eight in the series, its best stretch in more than a half-century. \n\"We're not the weak sisters,\" Dantonio said. \nMichigan (5-2, 2-1) lost for the first time since opening the season with a setback at Utah. \nMichigan used its last timeout with 10 seconds left to set up the final punt and discuss all options. \n\"If you go for it, you leave them with a Hail Mary opportunity,\" Harbaugh said. \"We could protect and throw a long pass. We ran through the scenarios and felt like the best decision was to punt. They didn't have any returners. It was a matter of punting it. We messed up.\" \nA fan was treated for a heart attack and taken to a hospital after the game. A Michigan spokeswoman said she didn't know if the fan had the heart attack before or after the stunning ending. LSU's gamble pays off Perhaps someone at Florida should have reminded first-year coach Jim McElwain about Les Miles' propensity to gamble against the Gators. \nLeonard Fournette ran for 180 yards and two touchdowns, Miles victimized Florida with a fake field goal for the second time, and the No. 6 Tigers beat the No. 8 Gators 35-28. \nKicker Trent Domingue's 16-yard touchdown run on the fake was LSU's only scoring play of the second half, breaking a 28-all tie in the fourth quarter. \nThe Tigers' defense held from there -- barely. Florida receiver Antonio Callaway, who had a 72-yard punt return for a score, had his hands on a long pass to the end zone from Treon Harris in the middle of the fourth quarter, but LSU's Dwyane Thomas punched it out to prevent a tying touchdown. \nHarris, starting for the suspended Will Grier, passed for 271 yards and two touchdowns for Florida (6-1, 4-1 SEC), with both scoring passes to tight end Jake McGee. Brandon Harris threw for 202 yards and two scores for LSU (6-0, 4-0). \nThe fake field goal was reminiscent of the teams' game in 2010, when LSU converted a fake field goal for a first down on its way to a late winning touchdown. \nThis time, Domingue bobbled the lateral pitch in the air as he ran at full speed but was able to gather it in as he sprinted around the left end for a go-ahead score. \n\"They had to fake a field goal to beat us,\" McElwain said. \"They made a hell of a play.\" Select company at Baylor Seth Russell did something for second-ranked Baylor only a Heisman Trophy winner had done before. Russell became the only Baylor quarterback other than Robert Griffin III in 2011 to throw for 300 yards and run for 100 in the same game as the Bears cruised to a 62-38 victory over West Virginia. Russell was 20 of 33 for 380 yards and five touchdowns and ran 14 times for 160 yards and a score. \nBaylor receiver Corey Coleman broke Kendall Wright's single-season school record for touchdowns, his nation-leading 16th coming halfway through the regular season for the Bears. He finished with 10 catches for 199 yards and three touchdowns. Rutgers' furious comeback Rutgers erased a 25-point third-quarter deficit by converting three fourth-quarter turnovers into touchdowns, and Kyle Federico delivered the knockout blow -- a 26-yard field goal as time expired -- for an incredible 55-52 victory at Indiana. \nThe record-tying comeback was part of a wild and crazy day that could have been much easier for Rutgers if Federico could have avoided having two extra points blocked. \nIt was the second time in 11 months that the Scarlet Knights rallied from 25 points down. They matched a school record that was set during a 41-38 victory at Maryland last November. Big numbers Alabama's Derrick Henry ran for 236 yards and two scores, helping the No. 10 Crimson Tide beat No. 9 Texas A&M 41-23. \nBaker Mayfield threw for five touchdowns in 19th-ranked Oklahoma's 55-0 win over Kansas State. \nAkrum Wadley stepped in for injured running back Jordan Canzeri to run for 204 yards and four touchdowns to carry No. 17 Iowa over No. 20 Northwestern 40-10. \nPhillip Ely threw for 327 yards and four touchdowns to power No. 22 Toledo over Eastern Michigan 63-20. \nPaxton Lynch threw for 384 yards and three touchdowns to lead Memphis over No. 13 Mississippi 37-24. \nPharoh Cooper caught seven passes for 160 yards and South Carolina's only touchdown to beat Vanderbilt 19-10 in Shawn Elliott's first game as interim coach. Longtime coach Steve Spurrier resigned last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:13:12.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
