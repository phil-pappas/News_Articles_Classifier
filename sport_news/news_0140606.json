Actually, the Yandle-Girardi duo is probably Pair 2A/2B with the Marc Staal-Dan Boyle tandem, the distinction dependent upon matchups.\nThe move is reflective of Girardi’s glaring difficulty getting out of the gate this year and it was explained without sugar-coating by Alain Vigneault in the coach’s press briefing following Friday’s practice at the club’s training facility in Tarrytown.\n“Kevin was playing so much better than Danny that I made the switch,” Vigneault said. “For some reason, Danny’s overall game, especially with the puck, has not been as efficient as in the past.\n“He’s working at it. Watching a lot of video to see where he can improve.”\nIncluding playoffs, Girardi has played the fourth-most minutes (8,922) in the NHL the last four years, trailing just elite defensemen Drew Doughty (9,341), Duncan Keith (9,150) and Ryan Suter (9,109). He has played more postseason minutes — tough, hard matchup minutes against the opposition’s top lines — over that span than everyone other than the Blackhawks’ splendid Keith.\nThe Rangers’ alternate captain, the epitome of the “It’s only pain” philosophy first articulated by Brandon Prust, has played through myriad injuries while dressing for 659 of a possible 664 games since joining the Rangers during the 2007 All-Star break. He has missed just four games because of injury, a pair in 2010-11 and two more in 2012-13.\nLast season, Girardi played through a badly swollen ankle for which he underwent a surgical clean-up procedure the first week of June as well as with a Grade 1 MCL sprain the final four games of the conference finals loss to Tampa Bay.\n“It’s not an excuse but it is a reality,” Vigneault said, unprompted. “It was a long recovery.”\nVigneault also said he has no intention of resting Girardi, either for the defenseman’s own good or as a mechanism for getting Dylan McIlrath into the lineup. The rookie has played one game, Oct. 13 against Winnipeg, while Boyle sat.\nIf the realistic objective is to play into the middle of June, it would seem beneficial for the Blueshirts to adopt some sort of rotation through which McIlrath steps in for either Girardi or the 39-year-old Boyle on at least an intermittent basis, but Vigneault obviously doesn’t see it that way at the moment.\nThe coach did say he and general manager Jeff Gorton talk “on a daily basis” about the need to “get a better read” on both McIlrath and winger Emerson Etem, who also has gotten into just one match.\n“We talk about how to try and handle that with the team winning games,” said Vigneault, whose team is 5-2-1 after consecutive victories. “It’s tough getting in … it’s unusual to play [eight games] and not have any … knock on wood [injuries].\n“Usually things work themselves out.”\nDerek Stepan missed practice because of lingering and substantial pain from Wednesday’s wisdom tooth extraction that was coupled with the removal of two screws that had been implanted in the aftermath of his May 2014 broken jaw, courtesy of Brandon Prust. \nVigneault said he expects Stepan to be able to go against the Flyers.\nHenrik Lundqvist will be in nets for his eighth start in nine games. Antti Raanta is likely to get the call for Sunday’s match at the Garden against the Flames.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:22:28.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
