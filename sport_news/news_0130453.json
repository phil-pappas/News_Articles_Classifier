The 2015 Yankees overachieved just by reaching the postseason. \n“We had to fight really hard to get to this spot, and so, yeah, I am pleased,” Yankees manager Joe Girardi said before the game. “This club accomplished a lot more than people thought we would.” \nGirardi started two rookies in his infield during what turned out to be the Yankees’ fifth straight postseason loss: first baseman Greg Bird and second baseman Rob Refsynder, who combined for exactly 200 career at-bats coming in. \n“When we left spring training, it wasn’t what I expected,” Girardi said. \nFollowing Jeter’s retirement last fall, the Yankees arrived at spring training with uncertainty, fought through a summer of anxiety and injury and ended their season in misery, a great distance from their first World Series title since 2009. \nOn a night when Yankee Stadium had the red-white-and-blue bunting out for its loudest crowd this season, New York managed just three singles in six innings against Dallas Keuchel, who looked like a bearded lumberjack cutting down the Yankees’ offense. The Yankees didn’t get any hits off the Astros’ bullpen. \nMasahiro Tanaka allowed five hits in five innings, but he gave up solo homers to Colby Rasmus and Carlos Gomez. \nComing off six straight losing seasons, Houston had more spark and spunk in its first postseason appearance since 2005. By the eighth inning, fans in the crowd of 50,113 started booing the home team’s lacking batters. \nNew York reached the playoffs after a rare two-year absence, but in some ways the deforestation of the last great era Yankees’ progresses without pause. Among the players swept by Detroit in the 2012 AL Championship Series, only two appeared against the Astros: centerfielder Brett Gardner and designated hitter Alex Rodriguez. Mark Teixeira hobbled onto the field with crutches for the pregame introductions, unable to play since he fouled a pitch off his right shin on Aug, 17. \nInstead of being available out of the bullpen, former ace CC Sabathia checked into an alcohol rehabilitation clinic Monday. \nBrought in last year at a cost of $153 million as part of the renovation, centerfielder Jacoby Ellsbury was dropped from the starting lineup following a second-half slump. Gardner, kept in at Ellsbury’s expense, struck out three times against Keuchel. \nRodriguez, who revived in the first half following his one-year drug suspension, seemed like he was zapped by Kryptonite around the time of his 40th birthday in late July.
