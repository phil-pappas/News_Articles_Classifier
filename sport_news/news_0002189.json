Every game is a different game, but if we play the way we can then we should be able to beat anybody in the league.” \nThe Bobcats opened their season with a 4-0 win over the Blazers in Winnipeg and then topped CMU 3-1 in Brandon on Oct. 4. \nJaycee Castle led BU’s attack this season with eight goals, which was the second-most in the MCAC. The Bobcats have been pretty stingy defensively, allowing only five goals. Red River College (8-0-0), which is playing Providence University College (1-7-0) in the other semifinal, was slightly better by allowing just four. \nLike most of the season, Schira knows a full team effort is going to be needed to reach Sunday’s final and potentially win the MCAC crown. \n“The key is to stay calm, believe in ourselves as a team so that everybody can contribute the best that they know how and that the other people trust them,” he said. “Don’t try to do it on their own, but try to do it as a team. Keep the ball low on the ground, pass it into the box and score.” \nThe Bobcats men’s soccer team will also be in Otterburne to make its playoff debut. BU secured the fourth and final playoff spot with a 4-4-2 record and will take on top-seeded CMU (7-1-2) in the semifinals. \nThe Blazers beat the Bobcats 4-0 in both of their meetings this season, but BU head coach Terry McGonigle expects a tighter matchup this time around. \n“It was a tight race all the way and a very competitive league for the men, very competitive,” he said. “We want to do the best that we can. We know that we have 11 players, same as the opponent of the day. If we’re the best team of the day, then we should win.” \nOsian Edwards was the Bobcats’ top scorer, netting eight of their 25 goals in the regular season. Goals may be a premium for BU as CMU allowed only nine this year while putting up 35 of its own. Brandon allowed 23 goals during the campaign. \n“We have to play our best game (to beat CMU),” McGonigle said. “We have to be well organized and we have to play the best game that we can.” \nBU VOLLEYBALL \nThe Bobcats continue their Canada West volleyball seasons tonight and Saturday in Calgary. \nThe injury woes continue for the Bobcat women (0-2), who will be without right side Nikala Majewski. She rolled her ankle during practice this week. However, left side and captain Shanlee McLennan is expected to make her first start of the year against the host Dinos (2-0), who are ranked eighth in the CIS. \nMeanwhile, things won’t get any easier for the BU men (1-1) as they take on the Dinos (2-0). \nCalgary is ranked third in the nation, replacing Trinity Western in that spot. The Spartans dropped one spot after a split in Brandon last weekend. \nACC VOLLEYBALL \nThe Assiniboine Community College Cougars volleyball teams begin their MCAC seasons tonight at ACC. \nThe Cougar women host the Providence University College Pilots at 6 o’clock The men’s match between the two schools follows at 7:30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:45:56.491+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
