(AP) -- Corvus led all the way to win the $100,000 Maryland Million Nursery Stakes for 2-year-old colts by 1 3/4 lengths, with Olympic champion skier Bode Miller's horse Ravenheart finishing fourth.\nCorvus ran six furlongs in 1:12.15 and paid $53, $20.40 and $13.40 on Saturday at Laurel Racecourse. It was Corvus' first career start and his first win for owner-trainer Katharine Voss.\nFlash McCaul was second, while Captain Alex was another neck back in third.\nRavenheart, the early 5-2 favorite, is owned by Miller, who purchased a barn at Fair Hill training center in northeast Maryland this year with the goal of becoming a trainer. Ravenheart won his debut race at Delaware Park on Oct. 3.\nMiller didn't attend the race. The skier plans to skip this season's World Cup circuit to spend more time with his wife and infant son.\nSports & Recreation Horse Racing   7111/10000   33535/79545  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:23:05.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
