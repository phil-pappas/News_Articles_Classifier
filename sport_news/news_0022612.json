Bills starting quarterback Tyrod Taylor is out, and running back LeSean McCoy is returning after missing two weeks for Buffalo's game against the Cincinnati Bengals.\nBackup EJ Manuel will make his first start in a little more than a year in place of Taylor, who sprained his left knee in a 14-13 win over Tennessee last week. McCoy returned to practice last week, and will start after being nagged by a pulled left hamstring he initially injured during training camp.\nTaylor is from Hampton and Manuel is from Virginia Beach.\nBuffalo is still without backup running back Karlos Williams, who will miss his second straight game with a concussion.\nStarting receiver Sammy Watkins is active after missing two weeks with a right calf injury.
