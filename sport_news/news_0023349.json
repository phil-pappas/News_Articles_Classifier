Hours will be spent watching shows, analyzing game replays and following the latest news of their favorite teams and celebs. For contact lens-wearers, excessive hours in front of digital screens can cause lenses to become dry and uncomfortable.[1] In fact, the majority of Americans (87 percent) will spend anywhere from 5-10 hours per week watching football on TV during the season.[2]\nNearly half (43 percent) of contact lens wearers who binge-watch their favorite shows while wearing their lenses experience discomfort and 75 percent are forced to remove their lenses due to this discomfort,[3] according to a study commissioned by Bausch + Lomb, makers of Biotrue ® multi-purpose solution, and conducted by Harris Poll.\n\"While covering sports and entertainment is my job, I am also a huge Seahawks and reality TV fan. Between watching and reporting on my favorite teams and shows, I definitely experience the discomfort of dry contact lenses at the end of a long day,\" said Charissa Thompson , host of FOX Sports Live and co-host of EXTRA. \"This is why I am super excited to team up with Bausch + Lomb to take the Biotrue Challenge. I can feel the difference and no longer worry about missing the most important play of the game, or a key scene in Veep, because my lenses feel dry.\"\nVisit www.biotruechallenge.com to take the Biotrue Challenge and experience the difference.
