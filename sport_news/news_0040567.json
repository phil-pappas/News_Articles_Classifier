The list goes on,” he said. \nFans flock to Twitter because it makes it easy to connect with players, Doyle said. \n“Stroman and Price are two of the best athletes on Twitter. They connect with fans in an authentic way,” Doyle said. “Stroman documented his entire recovery from injury on Twitter. It was very personal and he shared it with fans.” \nTwitter Canada, meanwhile, has embraced Blue Jays mania. During the Jays’ post-season run, if you tweet the season motto #ComeTogether, a red maple leaf emoji will appear.
