I think our players probably know it and I like to think we had something to do with it,” CSU coach Tom Hilbert said. “I don’t want to take any credit away from my players. I think we played a very, very good game in a lot of areas.” \nThe No. 21-ranked Rams (13-3, 6-0 MW) won the first set comfortably. \nThen in the second set Wyoming (15-4, 5-2 MW) started showing why it is receiving votes in the AVCA coaches poll. \nThe visitors jumped out to a 13-8 lead using a block that’s one of the best in the country. Wyoming had four blocks early in the set, but then CSU battled back. \nA six-point scoring run with Cassidy Denny serving tough put the Rams in control. \nAfter the intermission came the statement. The teams traded points until CSU took a 4-3 lead. Then all the dominoes started to fall. \nShot after shot fell in. Seemingly every Wyoming attack was blocked or dug by CSU. The Rams had five blocks in the set alone as they held Wyoming under double-digit points, with the Cowgirls looking more shellshocked with each point. \nFor the match CSU out-blocked the 11th-ranked blocking team in the nation 9-8. Wyoming hit .079 for the match while CSU hit .317. \nWith Wyoming’s defensive strategy, Hilbert told his team the outside hitters would need to have a good match. \nThey responded. Adrianna Culbert had 12 kills and hit .526, Alex Reid and Jasmine Hanna had nine each as the Rams won their eighth match in a row. \nFor CSU, there’s no feeling quite like dominating a good Wyoming team to create some separation atop the Mountain West standings. \n“I think it’s super easy to take a step back after you’re up two sets,” Reid said. “Instead of us relaxing, we really went out there and we’re like ‘let’s show this team what we have.’ It was fun because everyone was on their ‘A’ game…I think this is the best we’ve played all-together this entire season.” \nCulbert sets CSU record \nWith 12 kills, 18 assists and 10 digs, Culbert now stands alone atop CSU’s career triple-doubles standings. \nShe now has five career triple-doubles, breaking the record of four held by Angela Knopf, who was in attendance Tuesday night. All five of Culbert’s triple-doubles have come this season, four of them happening in three-set matches. \nFollow sports reporter Kevin Lytle at twitter.com/Kevin_Lytle and at facebook.com/KevinSLytle. \nNo. 21 CSU 3, Wyoming 0 \nAt Moby Arena", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T06:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:35:34.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
