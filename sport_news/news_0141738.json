We have got two opportunities in the side games so it’s an opportunity for me to pull things around and score some runs.”\nTaylor said he feels more confident than in 2012.\n“Obviously three more years of experience is on my side and that has helped me and the confidence knowing that I have scored runs against the best sides in the world now.\nTaylor added that he was ready to face a spin assault by Pakistan, something England succumbed to in 2012 when they were routed 3-0, also in United Arab Emirates.\nOff-spinner Saeed Ajmal (24 wickets) and left-armer Abdur Rehman (19 wickets) shared the spoils in 2012 while their voids will be ably filled by leg-spinner Yasir Shah and left-armer Zulfiqar Babar this time around. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:59:38.404+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
