Crowley told police that Manziel hit her several times. \nManziel denied striking Crowley, was not arrested and the couple was allowed to leave together. Manziel could be facing a fine, suspension or potential banishment if the league finds he broke provisions in its conduct policy. \nA league spokesman said Friday there was no update on its investigation. \nFollowing practice, Browns coach Mike Pettine said Manziel will \"more than likely\" back up starter Josh McCown on Sunday when Cleveland visits the St. Louis Rams. The Browns made Manziel active for last week's game against Denver despite his domestic incident. \nThe Browns' only other option at quarterback is Austin Davis. He played for the Rams last season and recently signed a two-year contract. The Browns have leaned on him this week for information about his former team. \nPettine said Manziel was allowed to dress for last week's game because the team was satisfied with its findings of the incident, which occurred on an off day for Browns players. Pettine also indicated that Manziel was fined, but the coach would not make public the Browns' internal discipline of the 22-year-old. \nManziel admitted drinking alcohol a few hours before his argument with Crowley, who police said was intoxicated. He spent 10 weeks in a rehab facility during the offseason for an unspecified condition. \nIt's not known if Manziel's after-care prohibits him from drinking or if he is in the league's substance abuse program. \nWhile Pettine said the incident was \"upsetting to all of us,\" he praised Manziel for his renewed commitment this season. Following a rough rookie season, Manziel acknowledged he didn't take his job seriously enough. \n\"One of the positives in his life is football,\" Pettine said. \"That's to give him an outlet and, again, it's hard for me to speak on, not just him, but any player outside the building because I'm not with them, but as his coach he's been an A-plus when he's here.\" \nBrowns Pro Bowl tackle Joe Thomas said he isn't concerned by Manziel's latest issue in what has been a drama-filled two seasons. \n\"I try not to get too involved in the gossip side, and what happens outside of football is none of my business,\" Thomas said, \"and what I see from our team and what I see from the guys when they're in the building is how I evaluate them and their progress. I think Johnny's doing a great job and the preparation this week has been the same as it has been all year. \n\"So the off-field incident that may or may not have happened, or whatever happened, doesn't seem to be affecting how he's preparing for each Sunday's game and I think that's the most important thing. The other stuff is just kind of between him and whoever it happened with.\" \n___= \nOnline: AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WPXI-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:06:57.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
