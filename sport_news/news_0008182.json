I like to see my teammates play well too.”Russell was really happy for her teammate and fellow senior Bailey Noonan on Sept. 17, which was senior night, when Noonan hit a three-run, walk-off home run with two outs in the seventh inning to defeat Hillgrove 9-7.“It was an emotional night,” said Russell, who watched from the on-deck circle. “We were hoping to come out with the win and we did.”As a result of a 5-4 loss to North Cobb in the region tournament on Oct. 6, North Paulding will not compete in the Class playoffs and Russell will prepare for another season of softball with her Georgia Impact team.When Russell begins her tenure at Florida SouthWestern, she plans to major in elementary education because she wants to be a teacher. Russell has a 3.85 grade-point average and her favorite subject is history.Russell also considered playing softball at Polk State College and Lenoir-Rhyne University.“Playing in college will be a different level of softball,” Russell said. “It’s a whole new experience. You get to meet a bunch of different girls and learn a bunch of different things.” Russell doesn’t have a favorite softball player but said she enjoys watching the Women’s College World Series on television.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T22:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:41:42.451+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
