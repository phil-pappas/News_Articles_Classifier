At the very least, there should be a sense of joy over the statistically meaningless games and the stretches of getting-to-know-you practices very quickly coming to an end.\n“I’m just happy that pre-season is over and we get to play games that actually count to something,” Raptors forward Patrick Patterson said Thursday, with a healthy sweat running off of him after a quick weight session at the end of practice.\nThat other train of thought is easy to board, though.\n“It’s pre-season. Whether I drop 100 or whether we go out there and embarrass them it doesn’t matter at the end of the day,” Patterson continued about the game against the team that swept Toronto in the playoffs last season.\n“It’s just going out there and having fun playing against John (Wall, Patterson’s former Kentucky teammate) again, having an opportunity to play another basketball game and just get better with my teammates.”\nDropping 100 might be excessive, but a scoring outburst wouldn’t hurt Patterson.\nThe starting power forward job is assumed to be Patterson’s but the 26-year-old has had a largely underwhelming pre-season. He’s been hesitant to shoot that three-point shot that coach Dwane Casey speaks so highly of. On Sunday against Cleveland, Patterson was 2-4 from three-point range but has averaged 3.5 points and 1.8 rebounds in 19.2 minutes in the Raptors’ 4-2 pre-season.\n“In my mind, individually I’m right on track,” Patterson said. “It’s progressiveness. Starting off early, I was figuring out my teammates, what they like and don’t like. That’s just me being way too unselfish. As the game moves forward I’m starting to take more shots that I normally take.\n“I’m starting to get back in my groove and hopefully this game will be much the same. I’ll be 100 per cent back in my groove, comfortable and taking shots that I’m comfortable taking.”\nThis final pre-season game serves as the culmination of the work put in over the last few weeks of training camp. The intensity on the court will likely be sporadic from both teams at the Bell Centre, but this marks Casey’s last chance to tinker with lineups without consequence.\nThe game still a day away when he met with media, Casey wasn’t interested in discussing who might be used and how much. Patterson factors into this final evaluation though, as that power forward spot needs some final evaluation.\n“There’s a lot of good. Each player brings something good to the table,” Casey said.\n“Pat brings his three-point shooting, (Luis) Scola brings his experience and knowledge. (Anthony) Bennett brings his athletic ability, his youthfulness and defence. James Johnson brings a lot: strength, athleticism, driving the ball.\n“We’re very pleased with all of them. We’ve just got four of them and probably only two, two-and-a-half can play. Those other one-and-a-half guys will have to be ready when their number is called, be ready, be motivated, be the best cheerleaders they can be and be a pro.”\nPatterson is the on-paper fit to blend into the Raptors’ frontcourt, with free-agent signee DeMarre Carroll and centre Jonas Valanciunas. Patterson sees a lot of talent in that pairing.\n“Speed, quickness, guys who can move and share the ball, guys who can knock down perimeter shots; guys who can pretty much just take over a game at any given point and time,” he said. “Guys who can constantly get the job done offensively and defensively.”\nCasey and his staff have decisions to make at power forward and when they do, they’ll stick with them.\n“We’re going to keep it simple with a set rotation,” he said. “Guys will know when they’re going in and what situations (they’re going into).\n“The minutes may change a bit according to the match-ups . . . we hold that card, but I’m not going to jerk guys in and out game-to-game and mess up their rhythm that way.”\n--\nPatrick Patterson is expected to be the Raptors’ starting power forward in their season opener Wednesday when the Indiana Pacers are in town, but there’s a string of bodies who would love a shot at the job:\nAnthony Bennett\nSix-foot-eight, 245 pounds\nStrengths: A young (22 years old), versatile player, Bennett has impressed Dwane Casey with his defensive effort since signing with the Raptors on Sept. 29. He’s had a few highlight-reel plays in the pre-season and has shown an ability to step back and hit the three.\nWeaknesses: Three years and three teams into his career, Bennett is still trying to figure out who he is as a pro. He could very well spend time with Raptors 905 in the D-League this year for some soul searching.\n-\nJames Johnson\nSix-foot-nine, 250 pounds\nStrengths: Physically, Johnson holds his own and is capable of big, athletic plays. He’s worked hard this off-season to fit into what Casey is looking for, starting with a defence-first approach to the game.\nWeaknesses : The players in front of Johnson may have him buried in Casey’s rotation. When the coach speaks of players needing to be pros and waiting for their turn, it could be directed right at the seven-year vet.\n-\nPatrick Patterson\nSix-foot-nine, 235 pounds\nStrengths: Patterson’s resume — a career 37 per cent three-point shooter with a 14.67 player efficiency rating —makes him the prime candidate to start for the Raptors this year.\nWeaknesses: Patterson’s pre-season numbers have been low in the pre-season (keep in mind the required grains of salt that come with that) and he’s been hesitant to shoot the ball. His rebounding has been down as well, which doesn’t mesh with the defence-first mantra that Casey has preached since last year’s playoff meltdown.\n-\nLuis Scola\nSix-foot-nine, 240 pounds\nStrengths: At 35, Scola has seen just about everything basketball can throw at him, thanks to eight years in the NBA, two Olympic medals (gold in 2004 and bronze in 2008) representing Argentina and a pro career that started in Argentina in 1995.\nWeaknesses: Age can work against a player too. Can Scola hold up to rigorous minutes this year with a lot of mileage already on him?\nMore on thestar.com\nArgos defiant prior to relocated game in Hamilton against Alouettes\nNFL Picks: Colts trick play was a treat to watch", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:47:35.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
