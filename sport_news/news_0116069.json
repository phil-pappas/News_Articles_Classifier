(Jason Miller/Getty Images) \nPeyton Manning is struggling these days with his passing, but the savvy veteran knows that there’s more than one way to help his team. On a running play Sunday against the Browns, the Broncos quarterback played fullback and laid out safety Donte Whitner with an open-field block. \n[ Maybe Peyton Manning stayed a year too long. But can he help the Broncos’ defense to a Super Bowl? ] \nManning’s display of fearless physicality didn’t help Ronnie Hillman gain any more yards on the play, but it will surely elicit cheers when the Broncos review the footage from their 26-23 win in overtime. And in the Browns’ film room, Whitner — who once announced his intention to change his name to “Hitner” — figures to be hanging his head in shame. Donte Whitner needs to retire. Peyton Manning just pancaked him. https://t.co/wLrwYPLgEx \n— CAVS NATION (@LeKingJames23) October 18, 2015 39 year old Peyton out there just throwing down pancake blocks on Donte Whitner. http://t.co/AP5hkxTber \n— NFL Network (@nflnetwork) October 19, 2015 \nOkay, so Manning didn’t pile-drive Whitner into the turf so much as let the 5-10, 208-pound safety bounce off his 6-5, 230-pound body. But it was still quite a sight to see the record-setting quarterback lay out an opponent like that. \nOn the very next play, though, Manning threw a pass that was intercepted by the Browns and returned 35 yards for a touchdown. Unfortunately, that was much more emblematic of the kind of season he is having, one in which he is looking every bit of his 39 years. \nManning threw three interceptions on the day, bringing his total to 10, which leads the NFL and puts him on pace for 27, which would be his most since his rookie season in 1998. His one touchdown pass against Cleveland gives him just seven through six games and puts him on pace for a mere 19, this from someone who has never thrown fewer than 26 in any season, and who threw for 94 touchdowns over the past two seasons alone. \nHowever, the Broncos are 6-0, and while that has a lot do with the league’s best defense, Manning is doing some things right. Surprisingly, that includes the occasional pancake block. Des writes for the Early Lead and the D.C. Sports Bog, scouring the Web to bring readers items of interest, both serious and amusing.
