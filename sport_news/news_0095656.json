(Photo: Dave Schwarz, dschwarz@stcloudtimes.com) \nIt was a moniker suggested by Drew Anderson that might just stick — homecoming wreckers. \n“We’re pretty unpredictable,” said Anderson, a senior running back/defensive end for the Sauk Rapids football team. “We call ourselves the homecoming wreckers, actually.” \nAs Anderson sees it, Sauk Rapids ruined their third homecoming of the season Friday night at Michie Field, beating host St. Cloud Apollo 30-6. \nOn Sept. 18, they ruined St. Cloud Tech’s homecoming, too, 30-29. And the Storm wrecked their own last week in a 49-0 loss to Sartell. \nStory continues below.

But any statistical analysis of this one should start and pretty much end with this: Apollo (1-6) had six turnovers, including four fumbles. \n“Defense was definitely turnovers and offense, we had a lot of guys step up,” Sauk Rapids senior fullback/linebacker Eric Burski said. “We had a lot of guys out. \n“A lot of guys played 100 percent and did their jobs. Our line blocked real well and our running backs played real hard.” \nThe list of key players out for Sauk Rapids right now is as long as the menu at Jimmy’s Pour House. Richard Carriveau is the latest, suffering a neck injury that prevented the two-way player from playing Friday. \n“We had a lot of new guys on ‘D’ this week,” senior quarterback/defensive back Matt Johnson said. “And they’re all young guys, too. \n“They really stepped up. It was really big for us.” \nJohnson, Anderson, sophomore linebacker Tommy Wittowski and junior cornerback Daunte Keller had fumble recoveries. \nJohnson and junior defensive back Ethan Bengtson had interceptions. \n“Our defense did a great job tonight,” Anderson said. “Overall, it was great team play.” \nAfter a scoreless first quarter, Sauk Rapids scored twice in the second to take a 14-0 lead, getting a 2-yard TD run by Johnson with 9:11 to go until halftime. It culminated a six-play, 92-yard drive set up by Nathan Waldorf’s 57-yard run. \nWittowski, making his first start, then grabbed a pitch by Apollo quarterback Joey Atkinson intended for Clayton Hoeper with 4:22 to go until halftime. The Storm then went 71 yards on 10 plays, scoring on Burski’s four-yard TD run with 35.2 seconds to go. \n“We were pretty proud of ourselves for the first five games even though our record was 2-3,” Sauk Rapids head coach Bill Magnuson said. “We played some good teams. \n“And then last week, we got our butts handed to us. It was a gut check time for our kids this week. We challenged them to have no regrets; just go right at ’em and play hard. Our kids I thought rose to the occasion very well.” \nSauk Rapids made it 22-0 with 54 seconds remaining in the third quarter. Koby Thelen scampered into the end zone from 43 yards away. It came right after an Anderson 30-yard run. \nShortly after that, the Storm made it 30-0 when Anderson scored on a 55-yard run. It was the first time Sauk Rapids had beaten Apollo since 2011, a 31-21 Storm victory, also at Michie Field. \n“After the game, I told our kids that we can’t turn the ball over six times and not tackle,” Apollo head coach Justin Skaalerud said. “It doesn’t matter what level you’re talking about. \n“It was the story of the night.” \nFirst quarter", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:28:34.263+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
