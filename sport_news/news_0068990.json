He took a charge and the ref called it the other way, sending him to the bench with six fouls. It was terrible call and Cousins did not hesitate to let the ref know that. He was pulled to the bench by his teammates, ending his night and the show he was putting on for Big Blue Nation. \nDavis will win be the NBA MVP within the next three years. \nI’ll put money that. I know tonight was only a preseason game, but he has gotten s good. \n\nWe were robbed of a Marshall Henderson sighting. \nThe Kings released the former SEC villain the day before they boarded the plane for Lexington. I bet they were afraid of what he may do in Rupp Arena. \nI couldn’t hear a word anyone said in the locker room after the game. \nI made my way into the Kings locker room (Kentucky’s locker room) after the game and the music was blaring. Speaker is definitely blown. Charge that one to Vivek. \nI talked to Boogie for a little bit off the record (that’s a story I’ll tell one day) and attempted to get some quotes from Willie and Rondo, but the music was too loud to accomplish anything. I think Rondo said something about eating a fish sandwich on a roller coaster. That may not be accurate. \nI also made the mistake of going to the locker room too early, before the rest of the media. I won’t go into detail but I’ll tell you I was the only one wearing clothing. The nudity ruined a potentially great SnapChat story.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:55:38.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
