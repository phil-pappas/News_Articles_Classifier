The predictions were that the Royals would win 75 games and fail to make the playoffs.\nInstead, the Royals won 95 regular season games and the title of Central Division champs.\nInstead of using his bat, Hosmer used a virtual pen to take on the Royals critics in a piece written for Yankees great Derek Jeter's Players Tribune in a piece entitled, \"No Fluke.\"\nThe first baseman described the magic of the 2014 season. He said he still cannot explain the incredible come-from-behind win in the wild-card game.\n\"It felt like this - playing on national TV, in primetime, in a meaningful baseball game in October - was where we belonged. And we didn't want that feeling to end,\" Hosmer wrote.\nHe said the team found its identity, groove and swagger in that game. He said everyone on the team knew how close they came to winning the World Series against a dynasty.\n\"We had gone toe to toe. We had taken the champ's very best shot, and endured one of the best World Series performances in history from Madison Bumgarner,\" Hosmer wrote. \"And still we had nearly come out on top.\"\nHe said no one understood how much the players and coaching staff had come together and how that would translate over to this season.\n\"For us, the stakes are even higher. For us, we feel like we aren't just playing for this year,\" Hosmer wrote. \"We're playing for last year as well. We're playing to win the pennant. But we're also playing to prove that last year's pennant was real. We're playing to prove that the 'heartbreaking ending' to our season was only one of those things. That yeah, it was heartbreaking. But it wasn't an ending at all.\"\nThe Royals were down four runs in the seventh on Monday. The Texas governor's office tweeted their congratulations to the Astros on playing for the pennant.\nBut the Royals mounted a huge comeback against the Astros on Monday that was reminiscent of the wild-card game. The Royals are in a do-or-die situation against the Astros in a decisive Game 5 at Kauffman.\n\"We're in a fight for our playoff lives. In other words: We're right where we want to be,\" Hosmer said. \"We weren't a fluke. We're the Kansas City Royals. We're here, now. And we're going to be sticking around for a while.\"\nClick here to read Hosmer's entire piece.\nKCTV5's Brad Fanning contributed to this report. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
