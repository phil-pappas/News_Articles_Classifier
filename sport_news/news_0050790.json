Lamar Odom’s primary concern at the moment is his health, but the former NBA star may also have to face some legal trouble going forward as a result of the alleged drug-fueled weekend that almost cost him his life.\nAdChoices According to TMZ, police obtained a search warrant to test Odom’s blood when he was receiving treatment at Sunrise Medical Center in Las Vegas. The detective who signed the affidavit interviewed prostitutes who had spent time with Odom at the Love Ranch, and they reportedly claimed they suspected Odom was using cocaine.\n“He possibly ingested cocaine in the bathroom adjoining in the bedroom,” the detective said. “They indicated that they heard him snorting.”\nOdom showed symptoms of a drug overdose when he was rushed to the hospital, which is why police needed a blood sample. Doctors reportedly found the presence of cocaine in his system, and that could lead to Odom being prosecuted when police receive the results of the blood sample they took.\nEmployees from the Love Ranch have not said anything about Odom publicly, likely because he had them sign confidentiality agreements when he began staying there. However, if you listen to some audio of the 911 call that was made on Odom’s behalf, it seems fairly obvious that he was under the influence of drugs.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/lamar-odom-911-call-cocaine/278042", "http://larrybrownsports.com/basketball/lamar-odom-brothel-workers-confidentiality-agreement/278368", "http://www.tmz.com/2015/10/22/lamar-odom-snorting-cocaine-brothel/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:38:48.158+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
