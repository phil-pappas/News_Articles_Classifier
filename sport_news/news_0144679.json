Central (1-3, 1-1 Mid-Eastern Athletic) reached the Wildcat 1 inside the final minute, but an apparent touchdown run was ruled short, and Elliott Miller blocked Nigel Macauley's 18-yard field goal attempt to preserve the win. \nBethune-Cookman (4-1, 2-1) won its third game by four points or less this season. \nNorth Carolina Central scored three unanswered touchdowns in the third quarter to turn a 7-6 halftime deficit into a 26-7 lead. But Williams hit Jawill Davis for two touchdown passes, and Michael Jones scored the game-winner on a 6-yard run with 10:50 remaining. \nMalcolm Bell rushed for two of North Carolina Central's touchdowns, while Dorrel McClain finished with 144 yards and one score. \nThe game was moved up two hours as North Carolina declared a state of emergence ahead of Hurricane Joaquin. \nCopyright 2015 by The Associated Press.
