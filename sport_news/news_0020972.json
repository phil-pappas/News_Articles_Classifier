The field itself utilizes Tifway II Bermuda turf, which is the most drought tolerant species available for playing fields. Best suited for Southern California's warm climate, this turf will enable Mirman School to minimize water usage as compared with other playfield suitable turf species.\n\"The Kotzubei Family share our founder's belief in celebrating the whole child,\" said Susan Berman , Board Chair. \"Quietly, and with an open heart, they made this expansion possible.\"\nIn addition to the athletics field, many Mirman families have provided funding and other support for a new Athletics Department building and sports courts. This expansion will be located on the eastern side of campus. For the first time, Mirman will be able to host field home games and hold simultaneous practices for its volleyball and basketball teams. This will also allow for future expansion of the school's academic programs, classrooms, and other facilities.\n\"While we refer to this space as a field, it is much more than that,\" said Dan Vorenberg , Head of School. \"Indeed, this is the quintessential outdoor classroom â€“ a place where some of the most important Mirman lessons will be learned.\"\nAbout Mirman School\nMirman School opened its doors to educate highly gifted children in 1962. Motivated by a deep love and concern for these children, Dr. and Mrs. Norman J. Mirman began the school with nine pioneering students in their West Los Angeles home. Today, Mirman continues to distinguish itself as one of the few schools in the country devoted to the education of highly gifted children.
