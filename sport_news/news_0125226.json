Championship Series in Kansas City. \nThey showed everyone why. \nThe Blue Jays came out swinging, and their rowdy fans were singing from the start, with Tulowitzki and Donaldson connecting in a six-run third inning as Toronto roughed up Johnny Cueto and the Royals for an 11-8 victory Monday that cut Kansas City's series lead to 2-1. \n\"That's really what we're all about,\" manager John Gibbons said. \"We desperately needed that breakout.\" \nVeteran knuckleballer R.A.

Kendrys Morales capped a four-run surge in the ninth with a two-run homer before Roberto Osuna closed it out. \n\"We're just going to keep fighting,\" Kansas City outfielder Alex Gordon said. \"We've got a lot of competitors on this team, and that's what you see.\" \nEven with a big lead, Tulowitzki lost his cool. He was given a rare playoff ejection for arguing balls and strikes before the top of the eighth.

Gibbons and bench coach DeMarlo Hale also came out to break it up. \nDespite being outhit 15-11 by the pesky Royals, Toronto pounced on Kansas City's pitching in the first ALCS game at Toronto since 1993 for their most runs ever at home in the postseason -- after scoring just three in two games in Kansas City. \n\"You could not tell in the clubhouse if we're down 0-2 or up 2-0,\" winning pitcher Marcus Stroman said. \"What we have is extremely special. The confidence that everybody has with everybody is amazing.\" \nSeemingly not distracted by the contentious federal elections that were being held in Canada on Monday, 49,751 fans serenaded Cueto with a singsong \"Cueto-Cueto!\" chant from the game's first pitch and never quieted down. \nThe Royals took a quick lead when Alcides Escobar opened the game with a triple and scored on Ben Zobrist's grounder. But that was the only advantage Kansas City held in having its nine-game ALCS winning streak snapped. The string dated to the 1985 series against Toronto.

Eleven of his remaining 13 batters reached, and at one point in the third inning he threw his hands up in frustration after gesturing for a new cycle of signs from catcher Salvador Perez. \nGoins singled in two runs in the second after Tulowitzki singled with one out and Russell Martin was hit by a pitch that knocked off his left elbow guard. Goins pulled into second on the throw home and shouted and pumped his arms. \n\"There's no need to put any extra pressure on yourself,\" Goins said when asked if he was looking for redemption. \"Just come out and do what I've been doing all season -- whatever I can do to help this team win is what I'm going to do.\" Tigers: Pitcher Daniel Norris says baseball kept him sane after a jarring medical diagnosis. The Detroit left-hander announced in a message on Twitter and Instagram that he kept playing this season after finding out he had a cancerous growth on his thyroid. Norris, 22, said the growth was deemed malignant but he was told by a doctor that he could wait until the end of the season to have it removed. \"I was given the option to shut my year down & get it removed immediately,\" Norris posted. \"However, seeing another doctor that determined I could wait until the end of the season reassured my gut feeling. Just keep playing.\" \nNorris went 3-2 with a 3.75 ERA this year in 13 starts for Toronto and Detroit. He was traded to the Tigers in late July as the most highly regarded prospect in the David Price deal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T14:37:33.424+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
