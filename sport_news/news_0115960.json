He also hauled in a catch for 12 yards. \nIn last week’s 34-29 loss to Ohio Dominican, Wiseman either didn’t play or didn’t get any touches. \nGarrett Powell \nOne-time Bartlesville High School receiver extraordinaire Garrett Powell helped Northeastern State University break a 17-game non-winning streak. \nPowell recorded one rush for 14 yards, and averaged nearly 40 yards per punt, during the RiverHawks’ 31-14 thumping of Nebraska-Kearney. \nIn a recent 59-7 loss to Northwest Missouri, Powell fingered four receptions for 45 yards, his longest catch going for 23 yards. \nSadie Schaffner \nFormer Bartlesville High School cross country icon Sadie Schaffner has helped the Oral Roberts University spiker team to a winning (10-9) record through 19 matches. \nSchaffner — a front row player — has appeared in 47 of a possible 73 sets and contributed 59 kills, sixth most on the team. \nShe also has made 24 digs and participated in 35 blocks, third most on the team. \nColby Mitchell \nFormer Bartlesville High School rock-solid lineman Colby Mitchell has started all five games at center this season for the University of Louisiana-Monroe. \nThe Warhawks are 1-4 on the season, including last weekend’s 34-24 loss at Tulsa. \nSlade Nordic \nA Bartlesville High receiving/defensive back standout in the last few years is getting a chance to produce for Pittsburg State. \nSlade Nordic, a redshirt freshman, has grabbed two catches for 21 yards, including a 15 yarder. \nAndrew Rodgers \nCopan High School sports standout Andrew Rodgers — a former four-sport athlete during his prep years — recently helped the Pittsburg State men’s cross country team finished fourth at the Fort Hays State Tiger Open. \nRodgers surged to 40 th place overall, with a time of 25:36.1, and to fourth place for the Gorilla team.
