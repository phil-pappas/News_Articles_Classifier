The people spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak about the accident. Jackson was taken back to the team's facility and reported no injuries. \nPhotos of Jackson's black Chevrolet Corvette with New York license plates were seen on social media. A stop sign and street signs were knocked over in the wreck. The accident happened at the end of a long straight road that leads from the Seahawks facility to Lake Washington Blvd and in front of a Seahawks sign.
