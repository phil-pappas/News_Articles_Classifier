It is not good for the MERC as Nasser is an ambassador of motor sports. We will be really disappointed if he does not take part,” said Rawahi. \nAttiyah confirmed his 11th title win in 13 years with an emphatic start-to-finish victory in the Jordan Rally, round six of the series, which finished in the stunning backdrop of Dead Sea on Saturday. \nHis ninth victory in Jordan also marked a 59th career MERC win to put him just one success away from equalling the 60 victories achieved by Dubai’s Mohammed bin Sulayem between 1984 and 2002. \nAdding to the woes of the OAA is the lack of corporate support for an international rallying event. \nThe organisers have been forced to cancel a lot of activities that were initially planned to provide entertainment for the fans. \nRawahi said, “The OAA is committed to host the rally even though there has been a disappointing response from the corporate world. Oman boasts of one of the best terrains for rallying and it is an honour to host the MERC leg after a gap of seven years.” \nHeld over three days and across some of the finest gravel-laden special stages in the world, Oman returns to the FIA regional series for the first time since 2007, although it did run as a candidate event in 2014. \nRawahi said that 'despite the grim picture, there were no plans to stop the hosting of the rally'. \n“Motor sports have got one of the largest following in the sultanate and we would do our utmost to avoid any erosion of the fan base,” he said. \nAnwar al Zadjali, the OAA's advisor and vice-chairman of the organising committee, is expecting about 20 entries in all, but he said that the final list will be known after the last date of registration, on Tuesday. \nHe said, “We will be holding the national rally alongside the main event and we have already registered ten Omani drivers. The final picture of the number of participants will be known only after the final day of registration, scrutineering and documentation of the cars.” \nZakariya al Aufi, Khalid al Minji, Said al Minji and Saif al Harthy are among the talented local drivers who are expected to be in the fray. \nAlso, drivers from Kuwait, Qatar, Abu Dhabi, UAE and Jordan are expected to be part of the rally. \nAhmed al Zadjali, the clerk of the course (CEC), revealed that this year’s event will run over 13 timed special stages and a distance of 249.62km. \nThe opening super special stage will be held at the OAA facilities on Thursday, while the stages will have the competitors cover 121.6km in Rusayl, Misfah and Saal gravel course on the first day. The next day, the drivers will be in action in Al Khoudh, Murayarat and Misfah over a distance 125.2km. \nThe road stages comprise 254km and the total distance covered in the rally will be 540.3km. \nAhmed said, “The challenging route will offer a demanding test for the region’s finest drivers and the emphasis has been put on spectator and competitor safety at all times.” \nHisham al Sinani, an OAA board member and a representative of the Ministry of Sports Affairs, said the rally is a prestigious event in the sultanate's sports calendar and the ministry is fully supporting the organisers to make it a success.
