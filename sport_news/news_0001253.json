On Sunday, Jones won the Winchester 400 to become the Championship Racing Association's first triple-crown winner. Posted: Sunday, October 11, 2015 8:05 pm Jones three-peats in Winchester 400 By Ken de la Bastide | The Herald Bulletin Herald Bulletin Posted on Oct 11, 2015 by Ken de la Bastide \nWINCHESTER — Erik Jones not only won his third consecutive Winchester 400 on Sunday, but he also became the first Champion Racing Association driver to pocket the $100,000 Triple Crown bonus. \nJones won the Rowdy 251 at Berlin Raceway and the Stoops Freightliner Redbud 300 at Anderson Speedway to set up the opportunity to take home the $100,000 bonus. \nHe also became only the third driver to win three or more consecutive Winchester 400s, joining Mike Cope, who recorded three wins in the 1990s, and Bob Senneker who captured five in a row in the 1970s. \n“This is pretty awesome,” Jones said in the winner’s circle. “I love to win races. To win that kind of money makes it really special.” \nJones took over the lead for the final time on Lap 322 with an inside move of Donnie Wilson following a restart. \nMost of the leaders took the opportunity to pit for a final time for tires on Lap 316, but Wilson elected to stay on the track for position. \nThe victory was far from assured at that point, with Chris Bell in the Kyle Busch Motorsports Toyota glued to his rear bumper. Bell looked inside and outside for a way to get around Jones. \nBell’s day came to an end on Lap 351 when he brushed the Turn 4 wall. \nThe 13th and final caution flag waved on Lap 364 when Grant Quinlan spun while battling for the third spot. \nFrom there, Jones held off Cody Coughlin, Chase Elliott, Quinlan and Bubba Pollard. \nAt one point, both Elliott and Pollard fell a lap behind the leaders but were awarded the lucky dog to record top-five finishes. \nIt proved to be a race of attrition with only 12 of the 38 cars running at the finish. There were 13 cautions periods for 101 laps, and the race was red-flagged twice. \nJones and Bell led 340 of the 400 laps. There were nine lead changes among five different drivers. \nDonnie Wilson crashed on Lap 327 in an incident involving three cars while running third and tangled with two lapped cars. \nDaniel Hemric made contact with the Turn 2 wall after running among the leaders in the early stages of the race on Lap 290. \nA mechanical issue cost Dalton Armstrong a potentially strong run when his Winfield Solutions Chevrolet wouldn’t start after the red flag. The team lost several laps in the pits before the car fired. \nHe finished 11th after running most of the day near the top five. \nRick Turner started 25th in the field and drove to an eighth-place finish. \nFollow Ken de la Bastide on Twitter @KendelaBastide, or call 640-4863. \n​Follow Ken de la Bastide on Twitter @KendelaBastide or call 640-4863.
