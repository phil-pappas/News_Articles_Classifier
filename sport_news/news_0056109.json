The U.S. won its second team Olympic gold in London three years ago and easily captured the world title in China last fall. \nMadison Kocian, Brenna Dowell and MyKayla Skinner also made the team, though one athlete will be named an alternate before the competition begins Oct. 23. \nBiles, Kocian and Skinner were part of last year's world championship team.
