IT IS TIME. \nThis is the week that is circled all year on my calendar. The week when the loyal denizens of the University of Georgia Bulldogs make the trek to our lone outpost in enemy territory to the south and meet the fans of that dark power known as the University of Florida Gators . On Saturday, our teams will be locked in mortal beatdown combat on the banks of the St. John's River in Jacksonville. Until that time 6 days hence, it is our job to prepare the way for the men who now wear the Red and Black by being locked in the throes of borderline-mortal alcohol consumption, partying, and HATE. \nWe have another rivalry during football season that we have named Clean Old-Fashioned Hate , and that's all well and good. This week, however, isn't clean, and it isn't old-fashioned (though it is a tradition going back to 1904). It's just HATE. Dirty, stankin', drankin', sweatin'... HATE. Especially this year, when we come into this game with very little hope of actually emerging from the stadium victorious, it is important to remember just how much we hate the Sunshine State Saurians. That oft-repeated refrain used by Ole Miss fans might also come in handy this week: We might lose the game, but we ain't never gonna lose the party . \nI eagerly encourage all of you loyal Dawg fans out there to post your paeans to Saurian scorn as FanPosts and/or FanShots this week, and we'll be promoting the most deserving to top-page status. (Hell, I might just promote 'em all. I just hate Florida that much.) \nThis is Florida week. This is World's Largest Outdoor Cocktail Party week. THIS IS HATE WEEK. Therefore, I'm letting the following people know that, for Hate Week, 2014, You're On Notice, Dawg! \nWhat? You expected something from me other than intense, irrational hatred on a week like this? This week is not a time to be rational. It's not a time to be \"even-handed.\" It's not a time to pause and consider the fact that we might be looking at a 1990's-era beatdown in Jacksonville. I don't even care about football right now. I. Just. Hate. Florida. And you should, too. \nAs I usually do during HATE WEEK (yes, I'm doing it in all caps all week, because I HATE FLORIDA), I will be providing regular snippets of hate to help get us primed and ready to meet the Gators down in Jacksonville. I look forward to seeing what the rest of Dawg Nation will come up with, as well. \nUntil tomorrow...", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:37:56.561+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
