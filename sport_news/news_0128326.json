(AP) - The severe winter that dropped record amounts of snow in New England took a toll on the deer herd in Vermont and Maine, prompting wildlife officials to scale back the number of deer hunting permits issued this year.\nAs archery deer hunting season opens Saturday in Vermont, the deer population is estimated to be down 11 to 15 percent due to the winter. As a result the total number of hunting permits authorized has been reduced by 44 percent from 2014 - from 17,350 to 9,650.\nIn Maine, state biologists recommended a nearly 25 reduction in deer hunting permits for 2015 because of the tough winter's toll on the herd.\nNew Hampshire officials say although the winter was harsher than recent winters the deer herd is in good shape.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
