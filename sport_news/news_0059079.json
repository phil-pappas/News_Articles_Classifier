(Photo courtesy: Arizona Athletics) Anthony Gimino TUCSON, AZ (Tucson News Now) - \nThe wrong opponent at the wrong time. \nThe Arizona Wildcats, wounded and a bit light in the caboose on defense, will try Saturday night to hold their ground against Stanford, the football equivalent of a runaway locomotive. \nIt's \"four quarters of War-Daddy football,\" said Oregon State coach Gary Andersen, whose team gave up 325 rushing yards last week in a 42-24 loss to the Cardinal. \n\"Stanford is going to try to tire us out by booming us,\" said Arizona linebacker DeAndre' Miller. \n\"They've hit their groove right now,\" said Arizona coach Rich Rodriguez.That groove is a power running game that has added weekly fuel since a season-opening 16-6 loss at Northwestern. The Cardinal has gone from 85 rushing yards, to 130 to 195 to 331 to ... well, to whatever the Wildcats surrender on the ground Saturday night. \nWith three linebackers out for this game due to injury, and linebacker Derrick Turituri questionable with a hip injury -- and Miller trudging forward while having to play with a cast to protect a right wrist injury -- Arizona will counter Stanford with one of the rag-taggiest crew of linebackers perhaps you've ever seen. \nWhoever plays has to be ready for a heavyweight fight. \n\"Who's tougher?\" Miller said. \"Who's swinging? Who's going to get knocked out? Who's throwing the uppercuts?\" \nStanford lands body blows in its methodical run-heavy attack. The offense actually huddles. Weird, right? \n\"I haven't played a huddle school since like high school,\" said Miller, a redshirt sophomore. \nThe Cardinal takes 30.85 seconds per play, making it the fifth-slowest team in America. Arizona is playing at the sixth-fastest pace -- 19.75 seconds per play. \nAfter the loss to Northwestern, Stanford has climbed back to 18th in the AP poll, helped by a 41-31 upset win at USC two weeks ago. \nPac-12 analyst Curtis Conway was asked on the Pac-12 Networks if Stanford was just too strong for Arizona's 3-3-5 defense, which fits better against a spread attack than a two-tight end, smash-mouth approach. \n\"I think so, man,\" Conway said. \"I just think when you look at the matchup, it's not built for Arizona's defense when you talk about the way Stanford runs the football. ... They're going to say, 'We're going to run right at you.' I don't know if the Wildcats have the guys to stop them.\" THREE WILDCATS TO WATCH \nQB Jerrard Randall -- With Anu Solomon recovering from a concussion, Randall is in line to get his first start at Arizona. The senior's running -- four long touchdown sprints -- has been sensational. But his 6-for-19 passing performance shows the problem: He hasn't been able to consistently coax accuracy or touch out of that strong right arm. \n\"I tell him all the time, 'You've got to learn when to release that thing and when to calm it down a little bit,'\" said quarterbacks coach Rod Smith. \"It's a work in progress, obviously -- how to throw with touch, how to take heat off certain balls. He's trying. We'll get him there.\" \nBut by Saturday night? \nC Cayman Bundage -- Arizona hopes you don't notice him against Stanford like you did against UCLA, when a couple of bad snaps, including one over Anu Solomon's head, contributed to the Cats' big early deficit. Bundage moved over from guard in camp to handle center after a season-ending injury to Carter Wood. \n\"He's been pretty good with it,\" Rodriguez said of Bundage's snaps. \"There were a few, certainly, in this game that were off. Cayman gets so fired up sometimes that he just wants to fire out and his snap mechanics will suffer because of that.\" \nSome linebacker -- Unless Arizona shuffles it's linebacker corps, 205-pound redshirt freshman walk-on Tre Tyler is in line to start at middle linebacker. There could be ample playing time at linebacker, too, for a couple of other guys who likely wouldn't have cracked a preseason depth chart -- senior Sir Thomas Jackson and sophomore R.J. Morgan. THREE CARDINAL PLAYERS TO WATCH \nLB Blake Martinez -- The senior, a graduate of Canyon del Oro High School, was described by a TV announcer last week as the \"Scooby of the North.\" You can never blame a kid for taking a full ride to Stanford, but it does hurt that the former Arizona staff of Mike Stoops didn't see fit to offer a scholarship to Martinez. \nBy the time Rodriguez arrived in late November 2011, he evaluated game film, made calls and offered a scholarship, but the Wildcats were too far behind to catch up. \nMartinez has a league-high 50 tackles in four games, as well as an interception and four other pass break-ups, on his way to an all-conference season. \nQB Kevin Hogan -- The experienced senior has had an up-and-down career, but he remains a solid NFL prospect (mid-round variety) and can make big throws off play-action, especially to another group of talented tight ends, led by Austin Hooper. \nRodriguez said Hogan is more than a game-manager. \n\"I think he's a pretty smooth operator as far as being able to make all the throws,\" Rodriguez said. \"He does that as well as anybody I've seen.\" \nRB Christian McCaffrey -- Stanford was very slow to ease him into the lineup last season, but now the sophomore has gained the trust of the coaching staff, which has completely turned him loose. He's a multi-purpose threat who ran 30 times for 206 yards last week against Oregon State, and he's the team's leading pass-catcher (13 receptions) and the primary kick and punt returner. He is third in the country with 222.5 all-purpose yards per game. NOTES \n--The Stanford coaching staff has three Arizona ties. Secondary coach Duane Akina and special teams coach Pete Alamar were assistants under Dick Tomey, and inside linebackers coach Peter Hansen played football and basketball for the Wildcats. A quarterback by trade, the 6-7 Hansen earned a spot in UA lore by becoming a kick-blocking specialist. He swatted seven kicks at Arizona. \n--The Arizona-UCLA matchup on Saturday night was the lowest-rated in the 115-game history of ABC's Saturday Night Football. The game, which UCLA turned into an early rout, drew 2.4 million viewers. On the bright side (?), at least a bigger audience didn't see that debacle. \nAt least ESPN raved about the local hospitality and the fan turnout for GameDay on Saturday morning. \n\"It wasn't just the attention for the program, but for the university and the city itself,\" Rodriguez said. \"Talking to the GameDay crew and other people, they thought it really showed well. I don't want to say it was a surprise or a secret, but that's what we've been telling folks -- pay a visit, come to Tucson.\" \n--Stanford LB Blake Martinez, in a story on the Cardinal's official website, talked about how he made an impression on Stanford coach David Shaw at a summer football camp. \n\"I remember the part where Coach Shaw came up to me during the camp and told me not to kill or hurt anyone because I was showing some physicality out there,\" he said. \"I thought I did well but never got my hopes up because I was a low-rated player.\" \nShaw offered a scholarship soon after the camp, stealing a heck of a player out of Tucson. \n--The fathers of Stanford running back Barry Sanders and Arizona receiver Cayleb Jones played against each other in the NFL. The elder Sanders, of course, was a Hall of Fame running back for the Lions; linebacker Robert Jones got to tackle him at various points in a 10-year career. HE SAID IT \n\"He's done what I thought he would do. He's gotten bigger and stronger and better every year. He was a really good player last year, and watching the film so far this year, he's all over the field. He makes plays in every aspect, whether it's the run game or pass game. Without question, one of the best linebackers in our league.\" -- Rich Rodriguez, on Stanford linebacker Blake Martinez PREDICTION \nStanford is going to attack the gaps in Arizona's 3-3-5 defense, and the Wildcats are going to fill those gaps with linebackers who don't answer to the name \"Scooby.\" That's just going to be a tough way for Arizona to survive, and all the scheming in the world can't really provide a good answer. \nOn the other hand, I think the pendulum of public opinion has swung too far on both teams. Stanford might not be as good as it has looked in the past couple of weeks, while Arizona isn't as bad as it looked against UCLA. \nWhile the Wildcats will have trouble stopping Stanford, the Cardinal defense could struggle as well. I'm calling this one closer than the 14-point spread. \nStanford 38, Arizona 31.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:37:07.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
