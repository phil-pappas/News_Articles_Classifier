Cubs manager Joe Maddon plays cards right in 4-0 wild-card win over Pirates By Bill Allmann Times Sports Correspondent Timesonline.com | 0 comments \nPITTSBURGH — In a one-game, sudden death atmosphere like the National League wild-card game, there’s no time for maneuvering back and forth like a chess match. \nInstead, it’s more like a roll of the dice. If the numbers come up in your favor, you win. \nThe numbers came up in Chicago’s favor Wednesday night as they beat the Pirates 4-0, eliminating Pittsburgh from the postseason after an impressive 98-win regular season. \nCubs manager Joe Maddon built his lineup on offense and quick-strike capability. He was prepared to switch to defense as the game required. \n“I set it up defensively, maybe not on paper would be our best defensive lineup, but matching up against (Gerrit) Cole, our best offensive lineup,” Maddon said before the game. \n“We wanted to score first.” \nPlaying Kyle Schwarber in right field, where he had played minimally all year, and Kris Bryant in left, gave Maddon his offensive lineup. \nSchwarber drove in Dexter Fowler as the second batter of the game, giving him the early lead he wanted. In the second, Schwarber took Cole deep to right field to give the Cubs a 3-0 lead. \nOnce the lead reached 4-0, Schwarber was moved to his more normal position of left field and eventually replaced by Chris Denorfia. \nPirates manager Clint Hurdle built his lineup on defense. He was prepared to bring on the offense as the game required, but the early Chicago lead kept any maneuvering to get offense into a close game never materialized. \n“An old friend, Tracy Ringolsby, told me that sometimes, you just draw a tough bull,” said Hurdle. “We drew a tough bull.” \nThat tough bull started showing early, from the first inning on. The Cubs managed just seven hits in the game, but leadoff hitter Dexter Fowler had three and scored three and drove in one. Second hitter Kyle Schwarber had two hits and drove in three. \n“In the first, Gerrit got a pitch elevated and in the second, he threw a back foot slider that stayed up,” Hurdle said. “It was like a batting practice pitch.” \nCole agreed that it was a few pitches that separated the season from ending and continuing. \n“We knew runs would be at a premium,” Cole said. “I went out and did my best, it wasn’t good enough.” \nWhile Cole might have come up short, he wasn’t going to be coming out on top when the offense didn’t score. The key opportunity came in the sixth when the Pirates loaded the bases with one out but Starling Marte’s hard hit to third base was turned into a double play. \n“We had opportunities,” Pirates center fielder Andrew McCutchen said. “But they got out of them. The ball that Marte hit was hit hard but right at somebody. \n“When we hit the ball hard, they were at someone. It’s tough. \n“It’s just a crazy game.” \nCrazy enough that if your number doesn’t come up, a season can end.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:03:38.680+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
