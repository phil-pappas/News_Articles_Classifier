Easley Escort wonders how Pitino could not know 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Louisville, Ky.\nEscort Katina Powell broke her silence on Tuesday, saying she has no proof that Louisville men's basketball coach Rick Pitino knew that a former Cardinals staffer hired her and other dancers to strip and have sex with former recruits and players.\nBut Powell said in an interview initially aired on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" that with \"a boatload\" of recruits and dancers, \"loud music, alcohol, security, cameras\" in a campus dormitory, \"how could Rick not know?\"\nIn her first interview since the release of her book earlier this month, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen,\" Powell spoke with ESPN's \"Outside the Lines,\" part of which was aired on the ABC morning show and all day on the sports network. Powell said that the coach had to be aware of some of 22 shows she alleges that former staffer Andre McGee paid her for that took place in Billy Minardi Hall from 2010-14.\nPitino has denied knowledge of the activities that Powell alleges in her book.\nFormer Cardinals recruit JaQuan Lyle , now an Ohio State freshman, has confirmed the \"gist of allegations\" detailed in Powell's book during a meeting earlier this month with the NCAA , CBS Sports reported. OSU confirmed that Lyle spoke with the NCAA.\nPowell alleges that McGee, who played for Louisville before becoming a graduate assistant coach and director of men's basketball operations, paid her $10,000 for the 22 shows. The dancers included Powell, her three daughters and other women, according to the book.\n\"Andre would come to me and tell me what girl the recruit wanted,\" Powell said Tuesday morning in the broadcast of the ESPN interview, \"and I would tell the girl. She would say her price, I would tell him, he would say, 'OK', give me the money. That was just it. He would take them into another room, and her and the recruit would do what they did behind closed doors.\"\nMcGee left Louisville in 2014 to become an assistant at Missouri-Kansas City. The school placed him on paid administrative leave on Oct. 2 when the allegations surfaced.\nLouisville men's basketball spokesman Kenny Klein texted Tuesday that \"to preserve the integrity of the review process, the university will withhold comment on any details until the review is concluded.\"\nNo one answered at Powell's home Tuesday afternoon. Messages left on Powell's cellphone and with her attorney were not immediately returned. Attempts to reach McGee's attorney also were unsuccessful.\nOklahoma State coach Travis Ford , who played for Pitino at Kentucky, said he is 100 percent confident Pitino knew nothing of the sex parties, if the allegations are true.", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/10/8823338/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/52/10/8823338/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-21T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:35:26.376+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
