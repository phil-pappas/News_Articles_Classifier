Playing surface is still good.” College GameDay remains scheduled for Bowman Field from 9-12 a.m. Saturday, which is open to fans.

Hurricane Joaquin has been predicted to begin traveling east from the Bahamas, but heavy rainfall remains in the forecast for the weekend. The university is urging fans preparing to visit Clemson to travel together and avoid grass lots. “Grass lots may be limited and we’re working on alternatives,” the statement read. “We encourage people to carpool or consolidate into cars with paved parking by meeting off campus to limit cars in grass lots. We’ll update parking lot information this afternoon.” According to the university, ESPN and ABC “is running 100 percent on generator power” and power usage is being decreased in Riggs Field and Memorial Stadium. Reported power outages on campus do not include Memorial Stadium.
