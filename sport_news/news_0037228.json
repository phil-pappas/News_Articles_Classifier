(Photo: Gregory Shamus, Getty Images) Story Highlights The Bengals rank fourth in the NFL in scoring and second in yards gained on offense. Bengals QB Andy Dalton ranks second in the NFL in ESPN's QBR at 83.7. 3 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nORCHARD PARK According to the official statistics, the New England Patriots own the most dynamic offense in the National Football League. \nNo one could attest to this any better than the Bills, who watched Tom Brady put up 40 points, 28 first downs, and 507 yards, 466 of which came via the pass, the most a Buffalo defense has ever allowed. It was a stunningly surgical dissection, and Rex Ryan is still having nightmares about it a month later. \nYet this week, several players in the Buffalo locker room were of the opinion that Sunday's undefeated opponent, the Cincinnati Bengals, are an even more dangerous offensive juggernaut, at least through the first five weeks of the season. \nThe Bengals? Andy Dalton? Really? \n\"We know that this is probably our biggest challenge of the year,\" said defensive tackle Kyle Williams, who isn't exactly prone to hyperbole, or a guy known for getting caught up in the moment. Walkthru: Bengals offense vs recent NFL history \nHow can this be? Well, the Patriots rank No. 1 in the NFL in yards gained and are No. 2 in scoring, but the Bengals are right there as they rank second in yards and fourth in scoring. The reason Williams gives the Bengals a slight edge, though, is balance. “They run the ball really well, they play-action off of it, Dalton can throw the ball well and distribute it as good as anybody in the league right now so we’ve got our work cut out for us.” Kyle Williams \nThe Patriots are No. 1 in passing because that's pretty much all they do; Brady slings it all day, regardless of how far ahead the Patriots are (ask the Bills) and they barely care about their running game (ranked 23rd). Cincinnati, with Dalton playing better than he ever has, ranks fifth in passing, but also sits 10th in rushing thanks to the two-headed monster running back duo of Giovani Bernard and Jeremy Hill. \n\"I think they’re as balanced a team as we’ve faced yet,\" said Williams. \"They run the ball really well, they play-action off of it, Dalton can throw the ball well and distribute it as good as anybody in the league right now so we’ve got our work cut out for us.\" \nRyan doesn't always gush about opponents because it's part of his schtick to always play the tough guy and exude confidence that his team is better than the other. But like he showed respect for the Patriots, grudgingly as it may have been, he did the same when discussing the Bengals who are coached by his old Baltimore coaching mate, Marvin Lewis.

So it’s a more balanced attack than you might think; it’s obviously gonna be extremely difficult. But we’ll see where we’re at. After this game we’ll definitely be able to see how we stack up.\" \nBengals fans have been riding Dalton hard for several years, mainly because he is 0-4 as a starter in playoff games. Lost in all that is the fact that the Bengals have made the playoffs all four years he's been with them. Still, that didn't dissuade Cincinnatians from booing the quarterback in July when he made an appearance at the Major League Baseball All-Star Game, which was played in Cincinnati. \nWhile the Bills have spent nearly two decades trying to find a useful quarterback, Dalton has a record of 45-23-1 as a starter, completing 62 percent of his career passes with 110 touchdowns and 68 interceptions. Would Bills fans take that over the past four-plus years? \nRyan, who has had to line up with Mark Sanchez, Geno Smith, and now the still inexperienced Tyrod Taylor at quarterback, surely would have. Bengals' Film Session: Facing the Bills \n\"I get it, I know he’s had some games that weren’t very good or whatever, but that’s every quarterback,\" said Ryan. \"He’s doing a great job. He throws the ball on time, he’s a rhythm thrower, he’s got a lot of good targets, and he’s accurate with the football. He runs their show out there so it’s a big challenge, there’s no doubt.\" \nIt helps that Dalton has an arsenal of weapons to unleash, starting with dynamic wide receiver A.J. Green. \"He’s one of the top receivers in the league so you have to play physical with him,\" said Bills cornerback Stephon Gilmore, who's off to the best start of his career. \"He’s a big receiver, and I’m going to do my thing against him.\" \nThe thing is, Gilmore and the Bills will have more to worry about than just Green. There's wideouts Marvin Jones and Muhammad Sanu, emerging stud tight end Tyler Eifert, and the two backs who make the running game go. \nVideo: Sal & Leo preview the Bills-Bengals showdown Sal Maiorana and Leo Roth preview the Bills showdown with the undefeated Bengals on Oct. 18. \n\"Obviously they have a really good offense, their skill positions are tremendous,\" said linebacker Nigel Bradham. \nBradham said it's clear what the Bills have to do if they hope to slow this offense down. \"The first thing we've got to do is stop the run, we know that's what they're going to start the game with,\" said Bradham, who is one of only three linebackers in the NFL who has played every defensive snap for his team this season. \"They are very balanced, everything they do is pretty much 50-50 run-pass keys, so when you're going against teams like this you definitely have to stop the run and make them one-dimensional and let our guys up front rush.\" \nGiven Buffalo's injury situation on offense, scoring is going to be difficult as it was last week in Tennessee, so there is massive pressure on the Bills defense. The Bengals lowest point total this year is 24, and if they match or surpass that, it seems like a reach to think the Bills can outscore them. \nNaturally, Ryan thinks it can be done because since the second half of the Giants game, he believes his defense has played outstanding. \"We had one bad play in the Giant game (in the second half) that unfortunately cost us the game, but you look at that second half and it’s pretty much a beat-down,\" he said. \"I thought we started to play pretty decent; starting to get the idea of where we’re at.\" \nMAIORANA@Gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:38:24.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
