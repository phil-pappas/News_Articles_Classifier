We know that. But this guy kept them off-balance and allowed the offense to settle in and get some runs.\"\nTulowitzki provided three of those runs. He broke the game open with a bases-clearing double off Kelvin Herrera in the sixth, giving him seven RBIs in the series. Edwin Encarnacion had walked with the bases loaded against Edinson Volquez , who seemed flustered by a couple of close calls against the Royals.\nMore Information \nALCS \nAll games televised by FS1\nKansas City 3, Toronto 2 \nGame 1: Kansas City, 5-0\nGame 2: Kansas City, 6-3\nGame 3: Toronto, 11-8\nGame 4: Kansas City, 14-2\nGame 5: Toronto 7-1\nFriday: at Kansas City, 8:07 p.m.\nx-Saturday: at Kansas City, 8:07 p.m.\nx- if necessary\n\n\nNLCS \nAll games televised by TBS\nNew York 3, Chicago 0 \nGame 1: New York, 4-2\nGame 2: New York, 4-1\nGame 3: New York, 5-2\nGame 4: New York 8-3\n\n\nKansas City totaled 22 runs and 30 hits in the first two games in Toronto, but Estrada faced the minimum 20 batters before Lorenzo Cain walked with two outs in the seventh. Closer Roberto Osuna was perfect in the ninth.\nYordano Ventura will start for the defending AL champions on Friday in Game 6 against David Price , the Game 2 loser.\nEstrada, a 32-year-old free agent to be, kept the bullpen door closed for most of the afternoon, a day after Kansas City romped 14-2 in a game that saw infielder Cliff Pennington pitch in the ninth. \"This time around I had a better fastball command,\" said Estrada, who gave up three runs in the opener.\nToronto is trying to become just the 13th team to rally and win among 80 who trailed 3-1 in best-of-seven postseason series. In this year's best-of-five division series, Toronto fell behind 0-2, then won three straight against Texas.\nChris Colabello's solo homer into the left-field seats in the second gave Estrada a lead..\nSalvador Perez homered for the Royals with two outs in the eighth. Estrada retired his first nine batters, ending at four Escobar's record streak of leading off playoff games with hits.\nEscobar, who entered 9-for-15 (.600), got Kansas City's first hit when he opened the fourth with a ground single past a diving Tulowitzki.\nZobrist promptly grounded into a double play to second baseman Ryan Goins . \"He was really good today,\" Escobar said. \"He threw the ball down, down and away, down and in. He didn't miss many pitches today.\"\nKansas City had no other runners until Cain walked with two outs in the seventh. Price was up in the bullpen, but Estrada got Eric Hosmer to fly out.\nVolquez allowed just two singles after Colabello connected but lost the strike zone in the sixth.\nBen Revere led off with a walk and Volquez hit Josh Donaldson with the first pitch. He then walked Jose Bautista in a 10-pitch at-bat on a knuckle curve that looked to get a piece of the plate.\n\"I thought the pitch to Bautista was definitely a strike,\" Royals manager Ned Yost said.\nEncarnacion walked on another pitch that upset Volquez and Yost. Volquez turned his back to plate umpire Dan Iassogna as Revere jogged home for a 2-0 lead. It was his last batter.\n\"When you lose your fastball command, it's hard for the umpire to give you the close pitches,\" Volquez said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:31:04.801+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
