(AP) - Russell Wilson threw a 43-yard touchdown pass to Tyler Lockett late in the first half, Marshawn Lynch jumped the pile for a 1-yard score, and the Seattle Seahawks beat the San Francisco 49ers 20-3 on Thursday for their fourth straight win in this rivalry. \nThe Seahawks whipped San Francisco (2-5) in Levi's Stadium on a Thursday in prime time 11 months after Richard Sherman chomped turkey on the field here last Thanksgiving night following a 19-3 victory. \nWilson completed 10 of his first 12 passes and finished with 235 yards passing. He was sacked five times to push his NFL-leading total to 31. \nLynch ran for 122 yards despite vomiting on the sideline in the first half as Seattle (3-4) won its first road game in four tries, avoiding another fourth-quarter collapse. \nIn a game lacking its usual intrigue with both teams trying to save their seasons and with Pete Carroll missing coaching nemesis Jim Harbaugh, Wilson made the key plays and Colin Kaepernick struggled once again facing Seattle. \n(Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
