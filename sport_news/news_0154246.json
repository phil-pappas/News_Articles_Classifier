Lovullo said he would speak with Ortiz after the game Thursday to devise a plan for this weekend's series in Cleveland. Ortiz has come out of the last two games after his third at-bat, and Lovullo said that would be the case \"if he plays again.\" \"The body is tired,\" Lovullo said. \"He’s had a really ,really good season. And I don’t want to put him in a situation where he’s going to run up against an injury, out of fairness to him. He deserves this time down.\" Allen Craig got the start at DH in Ortiz's place. It's just Craig's fifth start since he was called back up in September. He's 2-for-17 in those games as he continues to search for his swing. \"He’s made some really good mechanical adjustments with Chili Davis. They’ve talked about it. Allen has bought into it,\" said Lovullo. \"He’s trying to get into a loaded position as early as possible and just maintain good vision throughout the course of the delivery and his BP’s have been outstanding. It takes a little time when you make a mechanical adjustment. You have to feel uncomfortable before you get comfortable. I think he’s right in the middle of that stage. He’s starting to feel a little more comfortable and now he’s looking to get some results and see where it takes him.\" Craig's downfall from middle-of-the-order stud in St. Louis to roster afterthought in Boston continues to befuddle. The Red Sox haven't given him much of an opportunity at the major-league level this season, and Craig hasn’t given them much of a reason to put him in the lineup more often. Travis Shaw's emergence at first base has further cluttered Craig's standing in the organization. Even if Boston is able to move Hanley Ramirez this winter, Shaw would be the favorite to assume the job. It would be hard to even view Craig as a viable platoon partner at this point. \"I know [his old form] is in there. I believe he feels like it's in there. He just needs to make a couple adjustments,\" Lovullo said. \"He made some great progress. As you get older, you start to make mechanical adjustments and that’s where he's at. If there's one guy you can bet on, it's somebody that’s done it before. If you see that track record that’s been that special, you’ve got to believe he can do it again.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:20:07.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
