Read isportsweb's column every Monday and follow Tony on Twitter @RealTonyGarcia .\nThe Mark Dantonio era has been highlighted with story book endings and unparalleled success. Add an exclamation mark to that list after the Spartans completed the most improbable victory one could ever imagine, on a play that will go down as one of the most unbelievable in the history of college football.\nBy now you know the story. Michigan looking at a fourth-and-2 and had the ball on the Michigan State 47-yard line with 10 seconds remaining. Wolverines punter Blake O'Neill — who sent his first punt of the game 80 yards down field, just 2 yards shy of the all time college football record —was lined up on his own 38-yard line needing to just punt the ball down field and the game would essentially be over.\nYet, when the fifth-year senior out of Melbourne, Australia, lined up to receive the snap, the ball bounded off his hands. As he picked up the loose ball, a host of Spartans bombarded him and as he flailed about in an effort to get the punt off, it was instead batted off of his own arms into those of Jalen Watts-Jackson, who ran 38-yards behind a convoy of Spartans into the Michigan end zone with no time remaining on the clock.\nMSU (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) hopes and dreams — somehow — are still alive, while with this loss, U-M (5-2, 2-1) is effectively eliminated from playoff contention. However, while most will look at the play of the Wolverines fifth-year senior punter, it was the play of the Spartans fifth-year players that kept them in it the whole way.\nFirstly, it was Connor Cook. Now 3-0 as a starter against U-M, Cook was sharp all day long along the best defense he has faced this season. While the Spartans signal caller finished the day completing just 18 of his 39 attempts — MSU wide receivers dropped about six-or-so passes — he still managed 329 yards through the air, his second 300-plus-yard game in as many weeks, and was able to find the end zone (something he has done in 31 of his 33 starts) against a stingy U-M defense.\nArguably the other biggest play of the day came through the air to another fifth-year senior. The Wolverines had just kicked a field goal and regained a two-possession lead, 23-14, with 9:25 remaining in the game. The next play was a double-play-action fake; first a fake end around to RJ Shelton, then a fake zone-read type play to Delton Williams, and Cook rolled out to give himself some time. As he rolled, he found a wide-open Trevon Pendleton, who began rumbling down the sideline 74-yards — the Spartans' longest play of the season — but was ultimately tackled a foot shy of the end zone.\nOn the other side of the ball, it was a fifth year senior, representing another fifth year senior, who turned in a dominant performance. Shilique Calhoun wasn't sporting his usual number 89, but was instead wearing the number 43 — the number of fellow senior Ed Davis, who suffered a season ending knee injury in practice before the season. Calhoun had a day that was almost dominant enough for the both of them.\nCalhoun made five tackles on the day, 3 1/2 for loss, including two sacks.\nWhile most people will only remember the final play, and the rest of the game will fade into the abyss as if it never took place, the Spartans, led by their seniors, played one of their most complete football games of the season.\nDespite going just 3-for-12 on third down, and 0-for-4 on fourth down, the Spartans managed 20 first downs — four coming via Michigan penalties — compared to just 10 first downs on the day for U-M.\nIn addition, Michigan State netted 386 yards of offense — the most Michigan gave up all season — and allowed only 230 yards — the fewest Michigan managed all season.\nWith the victory, the fifth-year seniors on the Spartan team have achieved something that not many players can say. Cook, Calhoun and company have now defeated every one of the other (13) Big Ten teams on the road, with the wins at Rutgers and Michigan the past two weeks sealing the accomplishment.\nIn addition, MSU now holds a 12-game Big Ten road winning streak, dating back to a 2012 loss in Ann Arbor, and has gone 19-3 on the road in conference play since 2010.\nSo call Saturday what you want.\nA miracle. A fluke. Complete luck.\nLittle Giants against Notre Dame, the Hail Mary against Wisconsin, the Cotton Bowl comeback against Baylor and now, the fumbled punt against U-M.\nNow 33-3 overall in their past 36 games, one thing is abundantly clear; the Spartans know how to win.\nThere's nothing lucky about that.", "external_links": ["http://isportsweb.com/", "http://twitter.com/RealTonyGarcia"], "published": "2015-10-19T10:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:48:51.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
