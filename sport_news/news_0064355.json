They didn't know we would have Twitter or the internet and thought hoverboards would be a viable mode of transportation. They also thought the Chicago Cubs would win the World Series. So delusional.\n(Oh, wait, what? They could? This year? Like, for real? Nah. No way.)\nIf only Doc and Marty could see the world today . Well, thanks to College Humor they can.\nSpooky transition Halloween is coming up, and if you haven’t picked out a costume, don't.\nSeriously. Don't. What are you, 6? Who are you going to go as? Donald Trump's hair? Left shark? Tom Brady's deflated balls? Save it. You're better than that.\nInstead, marvel at the evolution of Halloween costumes over the years. Basically, it involves wearing less clothes.\nSign him up The video is in Japanese, so it's anybody's guess as to the context, but a dude pulled out a samurai sword and sliced a baseball in half while it was traveling 100 mph from 30 feet away.\n(SPOILER: It's not a real baseball because the inside of a real baseball doesn’t look like that, but is that really the takeaway here?)\nOur kind of America Stephen Colbert feels bad for presidential candidates not getting to use the music they choose for their campaigns due to the fickleness of the artists who don't want their songs associated with abortion rights or border fencing, so he tried to help them out.\nColbert, along with guest Jack Black, created a song the candidates can use for free that highlights all the things that make America great like freedom, blue jeans, standing on hay, Doogie Howser, pig roasts, Bagel Bites, halter tops and honeymoons in Reno.\nThe song actually starts at the 4:00 mark.\nAnimal of the Week We are in full-on pumpkin spice mode and this corgi is having none of it . We feel your pain, puppy. Pumpkins are not to be trusted.\nMore stuff for when you’re bored The MLB pennant races are reaching their conclusion this week (Cubs! Mets! It's the end of the world!) and the most exciting that has happened this postseason was a wacky inning in the deciding game between the Blue Jays and Rangers. Jose Batista provided the most dramatic moment with a science-defying bat flip. http://espn.go.com/video/clip?id=13898425\nTesla gifted its owners with an autopilot software update, and people are a little wary of it. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yCAZWdqX_Y\nIf you ever find yourself face-to-face with a tiger, prepare a bubble bath for it. You might still die, but research suggests it could be a distraction. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XG2bvLcRbDs\nDon't ignore people when they sneeze. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Z_Eqp3gjSo\nA chicken is tweeting for an Australian restaurant. If it types a five-letter word, we all get free chicken for life. Or something. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7dYQi3meh8\nFor additional videos and occasional nonsense, visit Twitter at @BNT_RNN .
