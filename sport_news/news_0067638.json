That is the message the players have had for a decade.” \nIn other games, it was: Manchester City 6, Newcastle 1; Sunderland 2, West Ham 2; Stoke 1, Aston Villa 0; Norwich 1, Leicester 2; Crystal Palace 2, West Brom 1; and Bournemouth 1, Watford 1. \nThe decision to recall captain John Terry backfired and fellow center back Gary Cahill was similarly susceptible in defense as Mourinho endured only his third league loss at Stamford Bridge as Chelsea manager. \nWillian had curled in a free kick after 10 minutes to put the champions in front but Steven Davis leveled before halftime. Sadio Mane and Graziano Pelle netted in the second half to give Southampton its first win at Chelsea since 2002. \nChelsea is only four points above the relegation zone and 10 points behind leader Manchester City. \nChelsea’s latest setback overshadowed Sergio Aguero’s five-goal performance as City trashed Newcastle 6-1. \nCity’s dominant performance in the second half against Newcastle provided a reminder of the team’s title credentials after back-to-back Premier League losses and a Champions League setback. \nAleksandar Mitrovic headed Newcastle in front in the 18th minute and it took Aguero until three minutes before halftime to equalize. \nBut in a 13-minute spell at the start of the second half, Aguero added another four goals, while Kevin de Bruyne also got in on the scoring act for the leaders. \n“In other games he was maybe having a lot of chances but not scoring,” City manager Manuel Pellegrini told the BBC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:21:26.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
