During the postseason, such decisions are made by Major League Baseball.\nThere’s a 20 per cent chance of precipitation for Game 1 on Thursday and a 30 per cent chance for Friday’s Game 2 at Roger’s Centre.\nThis season, the Jays are 38-14 with the roof open.\nFor whatever reason, Jays batters tend to smack the ball further when they can see the open skies and enjoy a 91-49 edge this season in homers when the Rogers’ lid is open.\nThat said, there are still things to worry about, if you are the worrying sort.\nPrice might be a candidate for the Cy Young award but he isn’t always at his best against the Rangers.\nHis overall career record against them is 3-7 with a 5.04 ERA, although he gave up just two runs in six innings in a 12-4 win in his only start against them this season.\nThe Rangers also added star hurler Cole Hamels at mid-season and Star baseball columnist Richard Griffin notes that their right-hander Yovani Gallardo hasn’t allowed a run in 13.2 innings.\nMore on thestar.com\nNationals\nNHL players weigh in on jersey advertising", "external_links": ["http://www.theweathernetwork.com/14-day-weather-trend/canada/ontario/toronto/?utm_source=mobileadwords?utm_source=adwords&utm_medium=SEM&utm_campaign=CAMobile&gclid=CNPDp53Lq8gCFQGoaQodILsF7g", "http://baseballhall.org/hof/ruffing-red", "http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T20:19:00.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
