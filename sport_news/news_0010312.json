The ultimate trash-talking tool for fanatics, the keyboard is packed with emojis, GIFs and memes for nearly every fantasy football situation. The keyboard is the perfect sidekick for SportsManias' new fantasy football feature, which allows users to import their fantasy roster and create a personalized team news feed.\nFew topics strike up as much passionate conversation as fantasy football, but finding the right words or images, at the right moment, is not easy. Hardcore trash-talkers can easily spend 10 minutes hunting for the perfect meme or GIF. So instead of spending game time on Google image search, fantasy fanatics can now use the SportsManias emoji keyboard to spice up their smack talk.\nCurated by SportsManias' very own diehard football fans, the emoji keyboard gives fantasy competitors one perfect picture for the thousand things they want to say. When Odell Beckham Jr. makes a spectacular catch, send the OBJ whip emoji. If Rob Gronkowski steam rolls a corner on his way to the end zone, send the Gronk spike GIF. Even when things are looking dicey, the keyboard has plenty to say. Praying that the running back doesn't go down? There's a Will Ferrell meme for that.\nDiehard fans will find that the emoji keyboard is useful outside fantasy league. Left hanging by friends? Send them a sad GIF of Tom Brady looking hopelessly for a high five on the Patriot's sideline. Throughout the season, SportsManias will update the emojis, GIFs and memes based fan suggestions and too-good-not-to-share moments. Every emoji will come with a description of what it is and how to use it.\n\"We created this keyboard because fantasy football trash-talking is an art form, and we want SportsManias users to dominate this aspect of the game, too,\" said Vicente Fernandez , co-founder at SportsManias. \"Nothing like this has ever existed for fantasy football. Between our new fantasy news feeds and this keyboard, SportsManias users will be fully equipped for the season.\"\nThe SportsManias emoji keyboard is currently available on iOS and is compatible with all messaging platforms including iMessage, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and many others. Step-by-step instructions for enabling the keyboard can be found within the app. Like a standard emoji keyboard, SportsManias' fantasy keyboard can be accessed by clicking the globe icon on iOS.\nAbout SportsManias\nSportsManias is the real-time news source for the fantasy player and the avid sports fan.
