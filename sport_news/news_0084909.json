Carr is flanked by medallists Joe Morrell and Sonni Wilson. \nCarr, who is a second degree black belt, said: “It has topped a great month with the results coming on the third anniversary of the club being opened.” \nThose successes come swiftly on the back of two other national victories for Ryu Shotokan. \nWilson has recently claimed a bronze medal while Carr finished a creditable fifth in the British International Championships, which were held at Glasgow’s Emirates Arena. \nThe tournament was on Sky TV, providing further exposure for the club. \nClub bosses are keen to add to their ranks in their fourth year and Carr said: “As a celebration of the three-year anniversary, the club are on the lookout for new students at both their Cannock and Stafford classes. \n“Anyone wanting to train will get their classes in October for free and also will receive a free karate suit.” \nClasses, which are open to all ages and abilities, take place at Active Arts in Greyfriars, Stafford, on Tuesday and Thursdays from 7.30pm-9pm. \nA Saturday class, for children aged five to 13 years old, takes place from 12.30pm-1.30pm at Avon Community Centre in Cannock. Admission is £5 for classes in Stafford and £3 for the Cannock session. \nAside from the above lessons, Carr also holds sessions in several schools across the region and the club boasts around 1,000 members in total. \nIt is far cry from the club’s more humble origins, and Carr – who is a decorated international competitor for England – chuckled: “When I started I had two members so it has not done badly since then. \n“I had been doing karate for 24 years, having started when I was four, and one of my England coaches suggested that I should start up a school of my own. \n“He thought I had ability to teach as well as being an athlete, so I created the classes and it has gone from strength to strength.” \nMany of the school’s students learn just for self defence, but there have also been a number of high profile triumphs in competitions, culminating in the exploits at the UK Open. \nCarr said: “Everyone who has competed for me has medalled, which is a statistic that I am very proud of. We have won medals at the UK Open, British and English nationals and various regional titles.” What do you think?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T09:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T00:50:19.069+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
