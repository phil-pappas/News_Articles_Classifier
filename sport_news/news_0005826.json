The Cardinals have clinched playoff spots in field hockey and both boys and girls soccer, and each in convincing fashion. PM East's field hockey program enters Friday's final game of the year at 8-7-2, as the Cardinals host Pleasant Valley. A victory against Pocono Mountain West on Wednesday solidified Pocono East's spot in the District 11 Class AAA playoffs, but a win on Friday would send the Cardinals to the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference playoffs as well. \"So a win (Friday) would be an opportunity, obviously, for us to advance to a little bit of a higher seed and maybe get a good draw for our first round,\" Pocono East head coach Jill Dorn said Thursday. \"And we are the last team to go in and report what happens. So everyone will kind of be waiting on us to see what happens to see what the determination will be.\" Being the last team to play, the Cardinals control their own destiny. \"We have a very young team, so I think what it does is it gives them that sense of understanding of what it will take to be able to not just advance to playoffs ... but we are looking at our postseason,\" Dorn said. \"So what we want to do tomorrow is not just challenge ourselves to win but challenge ourselves to be better and to peak at the right time going into playoffs.\" East's team is very young - \"at one point, we had started five freshmen this season\" - so while the team may not have experience, it certainly has the talent. Looking for more Talent is a common trait found around the Swiftwater campus. A talented Cardinals' boys soccer team is enjoying a fantastic year, finishing the regular season 15-2 en route to a No. 3 seed in the EPC (pending Friday's game between Liberty and Freedom). But to head coach Bob Black, as nice as the regular season was, it's the postseason that matters. In 2014, the Cardinals exited the playoffs in the first round. In 2013, they won once in the postseason before another early exit. \"These guys don't want that to become their legacy,\" Black said. \"They've been using (last year) as a motivation. They made it very clear to the coaching staff back in August that they're not last year's team. They don't want to be thought of that way. They want to change - and no disrespect to last year's team; they did very well - I'm just saying that that bitter taste at the end of the year, it lingered for them. They definitely want to get that taste out of their mouth.\" Depending on Friday's game between Liberty and Freedom, the Cardinals will face either Stroudsburg or Pleasant Valley in the first round of the EPC playoffs. Key players stepping up Pocono East's girls soccer team had to endure some tough times this season. The Cardinals lost two key players early in Angie Fernandez and Marianna Maldonado to knee injuries, but players like Victoria Burkhardt and Taylor Caridi stepped up big when they needed to, leading PM East to a 13-3-1 record, clinching first place in the EPC Mountain Division and the No. 4 seed in the EPC. Burkhardt was a defender before Fernandez's injury forced her to move to midfield. \"For me, it was a pretty hard transition because I played defense all my life,\" Burkhardt said. \"And I'm just used to staying back, getting it out and finding my teammates. But I'm liking the midfield because I get to go up and actually try to score sometimes.\" She adapted well, scoring 15 goals and nine assists. Taylor Caridi scored 22 goals and 15 assists this season to the lead the Cardinals, including one in a dramatic, double-overtime 4-3 win against PM West on Wednesday to clinch the division.
