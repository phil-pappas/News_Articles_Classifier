The Sleepwalker Tonic . It was a timely appearance, what with Halloween approaching, and with it came a whole faction of children looking to meet Jason Segel the Book Author.\nOf course, mega-fans of Jason Segel the Actor—the one who appeared on nine seasons of How I Met Your Mother and in movies such as This Is the End , Forgetting Sarah Marshall , and I Love You, Man —were amid the ample turnout, as well.\n Segel first talked about his most embarrassing moment on the set of How I Met Your Mother (he gained a bit of weight and broke a couch because Jason Segel is all of us).\nThen he got this serious question from an audience member: “Was there a real Sarah Marshall in your life?”\n“I think that every girl that I dated up until that movie was made felt like Sarah Marshall. It felt like every breakup I had felt like the biggest breakup in the world,” Segel said. “The opening scene of the movie, the breakup scene, that happened to me exactly as it was portrayed in the movie.”\nHe also made jokes about trying to keep his recollection of the movie PG in front of the kiddos.\n“A woman I was dating was out of town, and she came back and called me up and said, ‘We need to talk,’” Segel said. “I thought that meant something different than what that meant, apparently. So I was waiting, and she walked through the door, and I was like how I am in the movie. And this breakup happened.”\nIf Segel lost you at this point, maybe Google the first scene of Forgetting Sarah Marshall . (Warning: It’s NSFW .)\n“All I was thinking the whole time was, ‘This is going to be so funny in a movie.’”\nThe best Boston comics:\nPrevious -- of -- Next Canton-born comic Bill Burr owns the record for most consecutive sold-out shows at the Wilbur Theatre.
