Now’s about the time, entering the final three-week stretch run of the regular season, to start setting that table. It just might be best to start off with a little vocab review. Division I football is a 20-team league that’s broken down into four sub-conferences: the East, West, North and South. The committee has used the sub-conferences to set up a three-year scheduling rotation, which started in 2013 and ensured that all 20 teams play each other over that span. For example, Exeter’s sub-conference, the Division I East, played each team from the West in 2013. Last year, the East faced teams from the North. This season, it’s facing Timberlane, Salem, Londonderry, Merrimack and Pinkerton of the South. Thus, the East/South and North/West make up your two “scheduling clusters” this season. That term carries significant weight in regard to how the eight Division I playoff teams will be selected for November. The clusters essentially split Division I into two halves. The Division I East teams — including playoff-bound Exeter (6-0) and playoff-hopeful Winnacunnet (3-3) — haven’t seen a team from the North or West this season and won’t until a potential meeting in the state championship game. Each scheduling cluster will award four playoff berths, with each sub-conference champion from the regular season receiving automatic home games in the first round of the playoffs. From there, four wild-card teams — two from each respective cluster — will be picked based on won/loss record; the NHIAA’s football rating system will settle any ties. Each cluster will form its own four-team half of the bracket, with the two survivors meeting at Cowell Stadium in Durham on Nov. 22 for the state title. That’s the new Division I playoff structure in a nutshell. It’s a lot to swallow for the casual follower, but it’s helped make these next three weeks immensely intriguing, especially for the team down the road in Hampton. Using last year’s system, Winnacunnet, at 3-3, would have been a locked-in playoff team with the rest of the East — Portsmouth (1-5), Dover (1-5) and Spaulding (0-6) — struggling mightily. Under this new system — which in another important note, does allow three teams from one sub-conference to qualify for postseason play — the Warriors are where they should be as a .500 team, needing to win out to keep hopes alive for a wild-card berth. Winnacunnet saved its season last Friday night with its 17-7 upset of defending champion Pinkerton, ending the Astros’ 17-game win streak. The Warriors also kept Exeter from clinching the East’s automatic playoff bid and home game with three games to spare. But the Blue Hawks (6-0) can handle their own business in Friday’s 7 p.m. kickoff with Dover. Exeter has won its last 10 meetings in succession with the Green Wave by an average margin of 24.5 points, and it captures the East conference title with another win tonight at William Ball Stadium. Exeter is a virtual lock to reach the postseason. From there, honing in on the East/South cluster, five solid football teams will be engaged in a three-week battle for three spots. Here’s a glance at the playoff picture in the Division I East/South: LOCKS Exeter (6-0) The Blue Hawks clinch the East’s automatic playoff berth with a win. Dover’s playing better ball of late, but it will have its handful handing Exeter’s multiple rushing attack. The Hawks have four rushers averaging over 4.6 yards per carry, led by quarterback Kyle Ball, who’s rushed for a team-high 376 yards and five TDs while passing for another 338 and four scores. This is more of a numbers game than anything. It's tough to picture Dover having the horses to make this one competitive. ON THE VERGE Pinkerton (5-1) Coming off last week’s loss to Winnacunnet, the Astros suddenly have their hands full with Timberlane coming to town. Did Pinkerton do enough heavy lifting early, defeating Salem, Londonderry and Merrimack, to ensure at least a wild-card berth? Time will tell. Pinkerton will likely finish no worse than 6-3. Lose to Timberlane, though, and the South will be guaranteed to have three 5-2 teams at the top entering Week 8. The Astros are a lock with a win tonight. Timberlane (4-2) The Owls have been as tough as Exeter coach Bill Ball promised back in Week 1, but their best win so far came at Winnacunnet on Oct. 2. Critical road tests with Pinkerton and Merrimack loom. A win at Pinkerton tonight suddenly tosses Timberlane into the running for the South conference title. Lots of athletes. Lots of speed. Veteran QB. No team would be thrilled to see Timberlane on their playoff schedule. Salem (4-2) The Blue Devils survived a near disaster last week at winless Spaulding, prevailing 27-20. They might be a lock on Saturday morning if they can find a way to beat surging Merrimack tonight. Portsmouth (1-5) and Londonderry (2-4) are their final two opponents. STILL ALIVE Merrimack (4-2) The Tomahawks have played their way into the thick of the Division I playoff picture with last week’s 41-7 rout of Londonderry. The week before, they led Pinkerton in the second half of a 42-32 setback. This week’s road game at Salem is the big one. Merrimack faces tall tasks with home games against Exeter and Timberlane over its final two weeks. Winnacunnet (3-3) The Warriors not only sent shockwaves through the state when it held Pinkerton to one touchdown in last week's upset — they also saved their season. Winnacunnet’s final three opponents — Portsmouth, Londonderry and Spaulding — enter this week with a combined 3-15 record. The Warriors will need to catch one South Conference team and see another fall off the wagon completely, but their chances for a wild-card berth are alive and well — so long as they keep winning. The Division I North/West cluster has playoff locks in Goffstown (6-0) and Bedford (5-1), two powerhouses who reside in the North conference. Nashua North (4-2) and Bishop Guertin (4-2) are in a fight for the West conference title, and both Manchester Central (4-2) and Concord (3-3) of the North are still in the hunt. Prediction The Blue Hawks are too well coached — and too well numbered, in comparison to Dover — for a letdown in just their third home game of the season. Exeter should have its way with the Green Wave and clinch a Saturday home game on Nov. 7. Exeter 35, Dover 6 Ryan O'Leary is a sports editor for Seacoast Media Group.
