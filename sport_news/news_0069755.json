CIMBUREK james.cimburek@yankton.net yankton.net | 0 comments \nHOWARD – New venue, new distance, same results for the Gayville-Volin girls. \nThe Gayville-Volin girls – second in the last three South Dakota State Class B Cross Country meets – put two runners in the top four and all five in the top 25 to win the team title at the Region 2B Cross Country meet, held Wednesday at the Howard Golf Course. \nThis year’s meet marked the first time South Dakota girls have run 5,000 meters for post-season. It also marked the first year in Region 2B for Gayville-Volin and other teams from the southeast corner of the state. \n“It was an unknown for us,” said Gayville-Volin head coach Larry Buffington. “But we knew if everyone did their part the team would be in good shape.” \nAnother unknown was the condition of GV junior Laura Nelson, who had been under the weather since the weekend. Nelson fought through to win in 19:14, more than a minute ahead of Dell Rapids St. Mary sophomore Christina Vogel (20:26.5). \n“I tried to relax. I felt good, but a little tight,” said Nelson, the 2013 Class B champ. “There’s not going to be a race where I don’t feel bad at some point, but the best races come where I get out of that sooner rather than later.” \nElkton-Lake Benton senior Heidi Stoltenburg (20:28.4) was third, followed by Gayville-Volin senior Genevieve Clark (20:32.6), the 2012 champion. \n“I had my breakthrough today,” said Clark. “I am happy about that.” \nClark compared the course to drills from her other fall sport, volleyball. \n“It was like when we do line drills in volleyball,” she said. “It was zig-zaggy, which helped me.” \nAlso for the Raiders, Megan Hirsch (21:00.0) was 11th, Elianna Clark (21:42.5) was 19th and Jayden Engen (22:52.1) was 25th. Gayville-Volin finished at 15 points, with Dell Rapids St. Mary (26) second and Howard (37) third. \n“Our girls have been working so hard, juggling volleyball and cross country,” Nelson said. The Clark sisters and Hirsch are also a part of the Raiders’ volleyball program. “I’ve been so proud of them. They are the best teammates.” \nViborg-Hurley was fifth with 48 points, led by a ninth place finish from junior Jacia Christiansen (20:48.1) and a 17th place finish from Kirsten Paetow (21:32.7). Alcester-Hudson freshman Kendra Jensen (20:47.8) placed eighth, also earning a state meet berth. \nWith a state meet berth locked up, Buffington turned his attention to his “favorite night, looking at all the regions to see how we size up,” he said. “I think our girls feel good about what they did today. It gives us momentum going into state.” \nOn the boys’ side, Canistota beat out McCrossan 17-21 for the team title. Elkton-Lake Benton, led by medalist Cameron Harming (17:13.5), edged out Viborg-Hurley 32-37 for the third and final state qualifying spot out of the region. \nCanistota was led by runner-up Mason Decker (17:28.7) and third place Mandre Adams (17:54.0). Viborg-Hurley junior Logan Hansen (17:57.8 was fourth). \n“It was different competition, but it’s still the same race, still the same distance,” Hansen said. “We knew the course was flat, and we usually run better on flat courses.” \nDespite getting fourth, Viborg-Hurley will still get to compete as a team, with Logan Slack (17th, 18:49.1) and Emil Flade (18th, 18:50.7) also finishing in the top 20. \n“Overall our kids ran great. They all PR’d,” said Viborg-Hurley head coach Bill Hansen. “It will be fun. We’re looking for the opportunity to compete on another flat course, which we feel is beneficial to our boys.” \nWhile Logan Hansen was excited for himself and his team, he was especially excited for Flade, an exchange student. \n“It will be nice, especially for our third runner,” he said. “We will get to show him what it’s like to be at a state meet.” \nAlso qualifying for state was Alcester-Hudson freshman Brayden Pulscher (15th, 18:44.2) and Irene-Wakonda’s freshman Joe Sees (19th, 18:56.5) and junior Levi Van Beek (20th, 19:00.3). \nThe South Dakota State Meet will be held on Saturday, Oct. 24, at Yankton Trails Park in Sioux Falls. \nFollow @JCimburek on Twitter. \nBOYS’ DIVISION \nTEAM SCORES: Canistota 17, McCrossan 21, Elkton-Lake Benton 32, Viborg-Hurley 37, Oldham-Ramona-Rotland 57, Irene-Wakonda 61, Chester Area 70, DeSmet 82, Dell Rapids St. Mary 87, Lake Preston 88, Parker 114 \nTOP 20: 1, Cameron Harming, Elkton-Lake Benton 17:13.5; 2, Mason Decker, Canistota 17:28.7; 3, Mandre Adams, Canistota 17:54.0; 4, Logan Hansen, Viborg-Hurley 17:57.8; 5, Greg Boni, Mccrossan 18:00.9; 6, Brian Brave, Mccrossan 18:09.3; 7, Baylor Beck, Desmet 18:16.5; 8, Cole Deruyter, Elkton-Lake Benton 18:22.3; 9, Connor Libis, Dell Rapids St. Mary 18:23.0; 10, Logan Dahl, Mccrossan 18:25.6; 11, Justin Casanova, Oldham-Ramon 18:36.4; 12, Trey Ortman, Canistota 18:38.9; 13, Evan Baumberger, Chester 18:40.8; 14, Ja Gallman-Ringing Shie, Canistota 18:42.5; 15, Brayden Pulscher, Alcester-Hudson 18:44.2; 16, Jordan Logelin, Mccrossan 18:46.8; 17, Logan Slack, Viborg-Hurley 18:49.1; 18, Emil Flade, Viborg-Hurley 18:50.7; 19, Joe Sees, Irene-Wakonda 18:56.5; 20, Levi Vanbeek, Irene-Wakonda 19:00.3 \nOTHER FINISHERS: 21, Edward Soto, Mccrossan 19:11.9; 22, Peyton Roti, Oldham-Ramon 19:13.0; 23, Quinn Doorn, Viborg-Hurley 19:15.6; 24, Grant Deruyter, Elkton-Lake Benton 19:23.9; 25, Mike Sees, Irene-Wakonda 19:35.8; 26, Connor Spilde, Oldham-Ramon 19:51.1; 27, Byron Bumann, Lake Preston 20:02.0; 28, Rhett Mcmasters, Lake Preston 20:03.6; 29, Seth Overholt, Chester 20:11.1; 30, Zach Brown, Chester 20:15.5; 31, Luigi Thompson, Elkton-Lake Benton 20:34.8; 32, Alfonso Erickson, Irene-Wakonda 20:36.8; 33, Logan Hattervig, Howard 20:41.6; 34, Ben Connor, Howard 20:43.3; 35, Nick Thon, Parker 21:03.7; 36, Drew Wood, Dell Rapids St. Mary 21:12.9; 37, Dylan Kuehl, Elkton-Lake Benton 21:16.1; 38, Stetson Eschenbaum, Lake Preston 21:17.5; 39, Noah Roth, Desmet 21:21.8; 40, Justice Belt-Richards, Chester 21:30.6; 41, Kaden Mork, Irene-Wakonda 21:42.0; 42, Max Poppinga, Desmet 22:22.3; 43, Mace Plucker, Parker 22:38.9; 44, Jordan Neises, Desmet 23:11.9; 45, Zavier Centeno, Parker 23:33.7; 46, Broden Lesch, Desmet 23:39.0; 47, Zanto Centeno, Parker 23:50.0; 48, Thomas Eining, Dell Rapids St. Mary 23:50.4; 49, Hunter Griffin, Dell Rapids St. Mary 24:02.1 \nGIRLS’ DIVISION \nTEAM SCORES: Gayville-Volin 15, Dell Rapids St. Mary 26, Howard 37, DeSmet 42, Viborg-Hurley 48, Elkton-Lake Benton 50, Lake Preston 61, Arlington 76 \nTOP 20: 1, Laura Nelson, Gayville-Volin 19:14.0; 2, Christina Vogel, Dell Rapids St. Mary 20:26.5; 3, Heidi Stoltenburg, Elkton-Lake Benton 20:28.4; 4, Genevieve Clark, Gayville-Volin 20:32.6; 5, Ashlyn Deknikker, Lake Preston 20:34.2; 6, Emily Martens, Desmet 20:34.8; 7, Ella Heinitz, Dell Rapids St. Mary 20:43.3; 8, Kendra Jensen, Alcester-Hudson 20:47.8; 9, Jacia Christiansen, Viborg-Hurley 20:48.1; 10, Reyna Beck, Desmet 20:50.8; 11, Megan Hirsch, Gayville-Volin 21:00.0; 12, Macey Claussen, Howard 21:06.3; 13, Emma Neises, Howard 21:07.2; 14, Callie Otkin, Elkton-Lake Benton 21:11.5; 15, Hannah Noonan, Howard 21:18.6; 16, Saddie Palmquist, Howard 21:28.4; 17, Kirsten Paetow, Viborg-Hurley 21:32.7; 18, Tana Harrington, Dell Rapids St. Mary 21:34.6; 19, Elianna Clark, Gayville-Volin 21:42.5; 20, Kenedy Koepsell, Howard 21:48.8 \nOTHER FINISHERS: 21, Jessica Wittrock, Colman-Egan 22:09.5; 22, Catherine Vogel, Dell Rapids St. Mary 22:42.9; 23, Elena Waite, Alcester-Hudson 22:48.4; 24, Mykkah Krinkie, Canistota 22:50.6; 25, Jayden Engen, Gayville-Volin 22:52.1; 26, Madysn Gilbertson, Arlington 23:02.0; 27, Laura Selman, Chester 23:22.1; 28, Ashley Neely, Lake Preston 23:24.9; 29, Emily Nold, Oldham-Ramon 23:42.6; 30, Tori Hansen, Viborg-Hurley 23:45.0; 31, Trixie Jo Schlechter, Arlington 23:51.4; 32, Paige Bunkers, Dell Rapids St. Mary 24:02.5; 33, Sydney Altenburg, Desmet 24:02.8; 34, Holly Richards, Viborg-Hurley 24:21.6; 35, Zoe Evenson, Arlington 24:22.0; 36, Kearra Elkins, Desmet 24:46.6; 37, Randi Rowen, Arlington 24:48.6; 38, Skyler Kludt, Viborg-Hurley 25:12.3; 39, Julia Falsetta, Lake Preston 25:20.4; 40, Erica Declark, Parker 25:31.5; 41, Marie Robbins, Elkton-Lake Benton 25:50.4; 42, Alyssa Iiams, Irene-Wakonda 26:13.9; 43, Codi Schmidt, Desmet 26:52.1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T06:53:06.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
