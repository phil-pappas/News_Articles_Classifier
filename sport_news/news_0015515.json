The Green Wave won their AAC opener against Central Florida (0-7), but struggled on both sides of the ball against two of the top teams in the league. \n\"I look at Tulane and I see a team that is very capable, very dangerous,\" Niumatalolo said. \"I think Tulane has a lot of really good athletes. Coach (Tom) Herman from Houston said Tulane had one of the best defensive fronts he's seen all season and I agree with him. Offensively, the line is huge and they have a bunch of outstanding skill people. We're the Naval Academy. We can't look at any team's record and think that means anything.\" \nNavy closes conference competition by playing three of four on the road. Two of those November games are at 18th-ranked Memphis and No. 21 Houston. Niumatalolo was thrilled to see three American Athletic Conference schools in the Associated Press Top 25 this week. \n\"We have a really tough conference with a lot of really good teams. We have to get ready for a six-week grind and that starts, first and foremost, this week versus Tulane,\" he said. \"It's an exciting time for our conference and it's great to see so many teams doing well. We've got some challenging games coming up, but right now we've got to get all our arrows pointed in one direction and that's Tulane.\" \nOffense has been the big issues thus far for Tulane, which ranks 123rd out of 127 Football Championship Subdivision schools with an average of 297.2 total yards. Starting quarterback Tanner Lee sat out last Friday night's loss to Houston with a reported concussion and was replaced by Devin Powell, who completed just 11 of 28 passes for 88 yards. \nTulane hasn't been much better on defense, ranking 118th nationally with 38.5 points allowed per game. The Green Wave do have a returning all-conference performer in junior linebacker Nico Marley, who leads the team with 44 total tackles (six for loss). The grandson of reggae legend Bob Marley has recorded 193 career tackles. \nIn his post-game press conference in the bowels of Notre Dame Stadium, Niumatalolo said it was important to not allow one loss to turn into two. Based off what he saw in practices and meetings last week, the eighth-year head coach thinks his troops have put that loss behind. \n\"Our practice on Friday was as good as we've had in a long time,\" he said. \"Sometimes during a bye week when we're giving the players off for the weekend, that Friday practice can be a bit sloppy, but I thought everyone was really focused and dialed in.\" \nNavy lost starting safety Kwazel Bertrand for the remainder of the season due to a broken ankle while it was unclear on Monday how long Copeland will be out. Those are the only serious injuries sustained by members of the depth chart through five games. \n\"Going into game six, we're as good physically as a coach could hope,\" Niumatalolo said. \"We've been very fortunate to not have many injuries to this point and we can only hope that continues.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:10:35.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
