John Bazemore / AP Oct 21, 2015 at 11:44p ET 0Shares \nATLANTA —  One game away from the franchise's most-anticipated regular season in recent memory, the Atlanta Hawks were reminded what the regular season can look like on Wednesday night. Sometimes the pace grinds to an absolute halt. The Memphis Grizzlies were in town and, true to reputation, they seemed set on making life — even preseason life — miserable for their opponent. \n\"That's probably the wrong team to find our rhythm against offensively,\" Hawks coach Mike Budenholzer quipped after his team's 82-81 preseason loss. \nPreseason games played at this pace and intensity can be helpful, though, a reminder of those regular-season and playoff clashes that crawl possession by possession. It's the rare preseason outing where efficiency goes under the microscope. The clash of styles can be a helpful reminder that, at times, teams have to dictate their preferred pace. Rarely is this more apparent than when uptempo-type teams take on Memphis, which graded out as the fifth slowest-paced team in the NBA last season — a statistic that seems to overestimate the Grizzlies' preferred tempo. \nThrowing preseason games into the mix, the Hawks are 1-6 against the Grizzlies under Mike Budenholzer. (Of course, nearly half of those games do not count toward anything.) There's a reason for this: The Grizzlies are very good, and very good at playing to their strengths. \n\"They go deep in the playoffs every year and they always have a chance to win the trophy. They've been together for a while,\" said Kent Bazemore , who finished with a team-high 18 points, his best game of the preseason. \"Same thing we're trying to create here, a bunch of guys that have been together for a while. ... You've to give them credit, though. They stuck to their (strengths) and wore us down.\" \nIt was a loss that demanded a little more of the starting unit, and for that Budenholzer expressed his post-game gratitude. The Hawks and Grizzlies both treated this one like a full dress rehearsal.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:21:58.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
