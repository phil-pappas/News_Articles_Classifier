Lehigh matched a sesaon-high in points scored, but fell to the No. 10 ranked Rams 59-42. (TIM GEER/LEHIGH SPORTS INFORMATION) Keith Groller Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call Lehigh scores a lot, but not enough at Fordham \nFordham's Chase Edmonds ran for a school-record and league-record 347 yards, including 242 yards and three touchdowns in the second half alone as the No. 10 ranked Rams outlasted visiting Lehigh 59-42 in a wild Patriot League game in the Bronx on Saturday. \nLehigh led 21-17 at halftime on the strength of two TD passes by Nick Shafnisky. But the Whitehall grad suffered a hip-pointer while running in a two-point conversion with 10:36 left in the first half and didn't return. \nFordham got a field goal to close the first half scoring and then scored touchdowns on five of their first six possessions of the second half, including an interception return for a score. \nStill, Lehigh fought back behind freshman quarterback Brad Mayes, who threw the first two TD passes of his career, both to Sasha Kelsey. \nLehigh got back within 10 and had a 35-yard field goal attempt bang off the left upright with 2:35 left and Edmonds, a sophomore from Central Dauphin East, closed out his memorable day with a 75-yard bolt to the end zone with 2:17 left. \nWith two receptions for 55 yads and another score, Edmonds had 402 all-purpose yards, a school record. \nYet, despite the big offensive show by the Rams, there was frustration over the self-inflicted wounds by Lehigh. \n\"I was very pleased with the guys effort and how they competed, but we're still our own worst enemy,\" said disappointed Mountain Hawks coach Andy Coen, who saw his team fall to 3-4, 1-1 in the Patriot League. \"Too many penalties, too many turnovers and if you keep turning the ball over more than the other team, it's hard to win games especially in a league like ours where everything is very, very competitive. \n\"When Nick went down, I felt the energy went down on the sideline. But the kids rallied around Brad and got past that. Defensively, we got bit by big plays. We have a great group of guys. They just have to learn what they need to do to become a really good football team.\" \nLehigh will play three of its remaining four games at home starting with next Saturday's game against Georgetown. It's a 12:35 kickoff at Goodman Stadium. \nLehigh ---- 7 - 14 - 0 - 21 -- 42 \nFordham - 14 - 3 - 21 - 21 -- 59 \nSCORING SUMMARY \nFIRST QUARTER \nLEH: Nick Shafnisky 3 run (Ed Mish kick) 1:19 (Drive: 10 plays, 87 yds, 4:41) \nFOR: Austin Long 3 pass from Kevin Anderson (Makay Redd kick) 5:04 (Drive: 8 plays, 32 yds, 3:09) \nFOR: Phazahn Odom 15 pass from Anderson (Redd kick) 2:19 (Drive: 5 plays, 66 yds, 1:44) \nSECOND QUARTER \nLEH: Gatlin Casey 26 pass from Shafnisky (kick blocked) \nLEH: Dom Bragalone 10 run (Shafnisky run) 10:36 (Drive: 4 plays, 59 yds, 0:50) \nFOR: Redd 37 FG 1:36 (Drive: 8 plays, 39 yds, 4:56) \nTHIRD QUARTER \nFOR: Odom 30 pass from Anderson (Redd kick) 11:55 (Drive: 8 plays, 76 yds, 1:43) \nFOR: Chase Edmonds 9 run (Redd kick) 5:08 (Drive: 5 plays, 68 yds, 1:43) \nFOR: Edmonds 60 run (Redd kick) 2:58 (Drive: 4 plays, 83 yds, 1:10) \nFOURTH QUARTER \nLEH: Nana Amankwah-Ayeh 2 run (Mish kick) 14:51 (Drive: 6 plays, 46 yds, 1:29) \nFOR: Edmonds 50 pass from Kevin Anderson (Redd kick) 13:16 (Drive: 4 plays, 67 yds, 1:35) \nFOR: Jihaad Pretlow 23 interception return (Redd kick) 12:52 \nLEH: Sasha Kelsey 8 pass from Brad Mayes (Troy Pelletier pass from Mayes) 10:19 (Drive: 9 plays, 42 yds, 2:33) \nLEH: Kelsey 22 pass from Mayes (run failed) 7:03 (Drive: 5 plays, 48 yds, 1:11) \nFOR: Edmonds 75 run (Redd kick) 2:17 (Drive: 2 plays, 80 yds, 0:18) \nINDIVIDUAL LEADERS \nLEHIGH \nRushing: Dom Bragalone 19-109, TD.
