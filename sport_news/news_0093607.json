The match is scheduled to kick off at 4pm here in Ouagadougou (5pm Nigerian time). In-form star, Gbolahan Salami, alongside the duo of Chisom Chikatara and Prince Aggreh were among those who failed to make the starting line-up in the first leg a week ago in Port Harcourt. Assistant coach of the Eagles, Salisu Yusuf, has however quashed reports they could be handed starts on Sunday.“All things being equal, we are starting with the same players that started the game last week,” Yusuf told Completesportsnigeria.com after the team’s training session on Saturday at the August 4 Stadium, here in Ouagadougou.“All the players have trained well and should every one stay fit, then we won’t be changing the first eleven.” This is how the Eagles are expected to line up: In goal, Ikechukwu Ezenwa, left-back Chima Akas, Kalu orji who replaced the injured Solomon Kwambe in the first leg is the right-back. The centre-backs are Jamiu Alimi and Austin Oboroakpo. Midfield three will be Paul Onobi, Ifeanyi Mathew and Bature Yaro. Ezekiel Bassey, Osas Okoro and Tunde Adeniji will be the front three. \nLine-up vs Burkina Faso:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T00:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:06:21.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
