SPECIAL Marc Weiszer ATHENS — Keith Marshall is returning to Neyland Stadium where his college football career took a major detour two years ago after a knee injury.\nSony Michel on Saturday is going up against a Tennessee team that knocked him out of the lineup for four games last year with a broken bone in his left shoulder.\nThe Georgia running backs look a bit differently at their first games against the Volunteers since those injuries, given Marshall’s injury impacted him much longer.\nMarshall sustained a season-ending torn ACL in his right knee against Tennessee on Oct. 5, 2013.\n“I remember it very vividly,” he said Wednesday when asked if he would remember the spot on the field where it happened. “I have very good detail about what happened. That’s in the past. I don’t really want to think about that too much, especially when we get there. We’re just focusing on trying to win.”\nMarshall only played three games in 2014 after injuring the knee again. He is the team’s third-leading rusher with 131 yards on 23 carries with three touchdowns, but his carries have decreased each of the five games from 10 to five to four to three to one.\n“I’m not going to go to the coaches and say, ‘I want to get the ball more,’ ” said Marshall, who rushed for 759 yards and eight touchdowns as a freshman. “Obviously, I would like to play, but that’s everybody.”\nMarshall said starter Nick Chubb and Michel are “killing it. We’re trying to win.”\nMichel has 441 all-purpose yards (276 rushing, 148 receiving and 17 on a kick return) heading into his second game against Tennessee. He had three carries for 17 yards against the Volunteers before his injury.\n“It’s not really a motivation,” Michel said. “I didn’t even think about it. That’s the game of football. It kind of just happens. I guess it’s just another game.”\nMichel fractured the shoulder again this spring, but changed up his shoulder pads and hasn’t missed time this season.\n“I knew that all the rehab that I’ve been through, I was ready to go,” he said. “I never really had any worries about it.”\nMarshall said of his knee injury “obviously, it changed my life, it changed everything, really.”\nNow he’ll walk into the stadium where he was injured.\n“I’m not really too emotional a guy,” Marshall said, “but I’m sure it will cross my mind.”", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-08T17:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:48:51.296+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
