He also was docked $8,681 for unnecessary roughness for head-butting Giants rookie tackle Ereck Flowers.\nNew York receiver Odell Beckham Jr. was fined $8,681 for throwing punches and striking Buffalo's Duke Williams in that game.\nRams WR Stedman Bailey used the football as a pillow after catching a touchdown pass at Arizona. That cost him $8,681 for unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
