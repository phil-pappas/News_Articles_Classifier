But intervention by the minister of justice led to a series of delays before the parole board announced yesterday that he would be released on October 20.\nProsecutors have filed an appeal against the culpable homicide verdict, arguing that he should have been convicted of murder over the killing of Reeva Steenkamp on Valentine's Day 2013. If they win their case, due to begin on November 3, Pistorius could face at least 15 years in jail.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:46:53.143+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
