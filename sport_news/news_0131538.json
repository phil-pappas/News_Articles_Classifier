When he looks around and sees so many new faces, Weber said their low pick it logical. \n“You have three teams that are possibly top 10, top 12 teams,” he said. “You have another three teams that are possible top 25 teams. So, especially when you look at returning players, that’s our big question. People don’t even know our guys.” \nThe Big 12 released its preseason coaches poll on Thursday, with Kansas picked to win a 12th consecutive Big 12 title. Oklahoma was selected second and Iowa State third. All three teams were ranked in the top 10 of the coaches’ poll this week. \nK-State, meanwhile, was picked in a tie for eighth with TCU, while Texas Tech rounded out the last spot. \nThe Wildcats are heading into the season with a roster that features seven new scholarship players, including six freshmen, with a returning group of starters that have never wowed offensively during their time at K-State. \nLed by returning starters Wesley Iwundu and Justin Edwards, K-State also returns Stephen Hurt and Brian Rohleder in a slim group of contributors from last season. The Wildcats get junior big man D.J. Johnson back after a 16-month absence due to injury. \nBut even with so many new faces and so few returning major contributors, Weber likes his group. \n“We feel good about our guys,” he said. “We feel good about the freshmen. The older guys have made steps in the right direction. If we keep doing the right thing everyday and working our butts off and continue improving, I think we will be fine. We will be very, very competitive. \n“This league, it’s been number one RPI the past two years. It probably has a great chance of doing that again. You could be fifth, sixth, seventh, or eighth and still be a really good team, a top 50 RPI team.” \nThe newcomers will be headlined by freshman guard Barry Brown, listed in the media guide as the projected starter at shooting guard, and freshman forward Dean Wade. Junior college transfer Carlbe Ervin and freshman Kamau Stokes offer the Wildcats contrasting looks at the wide-open point guard spot, while freshmen Ron Freeman and Dante Williams are wildcards in terms of what their production value could be. \nAfter dealing with a team full of problems on and off the court last season, Weber said they’ve worked to move on by embracing the present group and letting the past stay where it lies. \nPractices so far have been competitive, and Weber said his staff has enjoyed the change. But he added they have a lot to accomplish before they are a finished product. \nRohleder said the new and old players have meshed well and the chemistry has been good. All the players have shared in the common goal of out-playing the low expectations placed on them externally. \n“I think everyone is excited to go and prove to everybody that we’re a good team,” he said. “To go and show that we’re going to be more than what people think we’re going to be this year. We need to prove to ourselves that we’re a good team.” \nWeber said the staff has drawn a fine line in the amount of time it spends teaching, versus the amount spent on letting the guys just play and learn on the fly. He said they often have to let them play through mistakes and fix it through film later on. \nBut as the opening game approaches on Oct. 30, against Emporia State in Bramlage Coliseum, the Wildcats are taking advantage of every second they have to try prepare and improve. \n“I think the biggest word is time, right now,” Weber said. “We need time. We need time to get experience, we need time to heal up and get healthy and we need time to learn. I think that’s what the portion of this early practice and building the foundation is about.” \nAs far as the players are concerned, no one seemed too concerned with how the rest of the league is picking them before the season begins. Although it does serves as some motivation, the focus is on working to get better as a team. \nThe rest will take care of itself. \n“It definitely fires us up, but we don’t worry about it,” Stokes said. “We don’t worry about it because as long as we do what we need to do then everything else is go with the flow.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:32:56.518+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
