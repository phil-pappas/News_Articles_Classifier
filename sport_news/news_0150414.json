(AP) - Rookie star Jack Eichel scored a nifty unassisted goal and Buffalo beat the Columbus Blue Jackets 4-2 on Monday to give coach Dan Bylsma his first victory with the Sabres. \nThe former Boston University player selected No. 2 overall in the June draft, Eichel bodied off Boone Jenner in a loose-puck battle, kept the puck in the offensive zone, wheeled to his forehand and ripped a shot over goalie Sergei Bobrovsky to give Buffalo a 3-1 lead at 9:21 of the third period. \nRasmus Ristolainen, Ryan O'Reilly and Matt Moulson had power-play goals for Buffalo. Moulson also had two assists, and Chad Johnson made 21 saves to help Buffalo rebound after losing its first two games of the season. \nScott Hartnell and Brandon Saad scored for Columbus, and Bobrovsky stopped 29 shots. The Blue Jackets are 0-3. Oct 12, 2015; Buffalo, NY, USA; Buffalo Sabres center Jack Eichel (15) takes a shot before the game against the Columbus Blue Jackets at First Niagara Center.
