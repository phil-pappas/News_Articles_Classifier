Raphael Tapia’s PAT cut the lead to seven points, and Harvey got the ball back with four minutes left on a recovered fumble by Tapia. The Cavs moved the ball down to Newark’s 25-yard-line, but on fourth down the Minutemen stopped Smith on a run, just one yard short. Newark then ran out the clock. \nThe first half was a defensive battle as both teams made big plays to thwart drives and frustrate the offense. In the first quarter, senior Captain Joe O’Connell blitzed off the left edge and knocked the ball free from the Newark quarterback and freshman Cameron Polemeni-Hegarty recovered it to stop a Newark drive at the Harvey 35-yard line. \nIn the second quarter, Harvey stopped a Newark drive at the Cavaliers’ 15-yard line when senior Captain Mike DePass forced a fumble and junior Sam Bocklet recovered it. \nThe Minutemen defense was equally adept at stopping Harvey at their 15-yard line on an interception and stopping another drive on downs deep in their territory. Newark finally broke through late in the second quarter on a 35-yard QB keeper run and the half ended with Newark on top 7-0. \nNewark received the second half kick and stunned the Cavs, scoring again on the second play from scrimmage on another 60-yard QB keeper to take a 14-0 lead. But Harvey struck back and drove the ball down the field. Two clutch passes from senior captain QB Tom Smith to DePass, for 18 and 14 yards, set up Little’s two-yard TD run. Harvey stunned Newark by having O’Connell kick on-side and DePass recovered it on the Newark 34-yard line. Several plays later, Smith, off a busted play, ran the ball into the end zone from 10 yards out to make the score 14 – 12. \nNewark made a big play late in the third quarter when the Minutemen blocked a Smith punt deep in Harvey territory and scored again on a 35-yard TD run to end the third period up 20-12. \nAfter recovering a Harvey fumble on their 35 yard-line, Newark scored for the final time on a 20-yard TD run and was on top 26-12 with 10 minutes left. When Harvey stopped the two-point conversion, it kept Newark’s lead within two touchdowns, giving the Cavaliers the chance for a comeback that was not to be. \nSmith, nursing a broken index finger on his throwing hand, completed seven passes for 130 yards and rushed for another 52 yards and scored a TD. Little, who also struggled with nagging injuries, gained 129 yards on 18 carries and scored two TDs. DePass caught four passes for 83 yards and freshman Tyler Wagnblas had two catches for 33 yards. \nThe Harvey defense was spectacular, forcing five turnovers and not allowing Newark a completed pass. Sophomore Captain John Sullivan led the defense with 10 tackles. Senior Jordan Washington had his best game of the year with eight tackles and a sack, O’Connell made six tackles and recorded a sack, while DePass, Little, Polemeni-Hegarty and junior Dajour Fisher each had six tackles. \nThe Cavaliers, who dropped to 2-1-1, host Horace Mann Saturday .
