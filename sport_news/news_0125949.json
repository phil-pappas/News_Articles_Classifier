The Warriors announced Thursday that Kerr will need time off for rehabilitation and recovery. Kerr underwent back surgery to repair a ruptured disc in late July and had follow-up surgery in September. The length of his absence is unknown at this time. Kerr said that after two days of training camp he realized he needed to take a step back and focus on his rehabilitation so he can make it through the grind of an NBA season. The Warriors won their first NBA title in 40 years in Kerr’s first year as coach last season. NFL Ware’s work on quarterbacks recognized with award ENGLEWOOD – Denver Broncos outside linebacker DeMarcus Ware won the first Defensive Player of the Month honor of his 11-year career. The eight-time Pro Bowler earned the AFC’s monthly honor after helping lead the NFL’s No. 1-ranked defense with 3 1-2 sacks in three games in September. He’s the only player in the league with a sack in each of his team’s first three games. Ware also leads the league with 11 quarterback hits and added 10 tackles in helping the Broncos to a 3-0 start. Ware has benefited from defensive coordinator Wade Phillips’ 3-4 defensive scheme in which he doesn’t have to square off against tackles all the time like he did in the 4-3 alignment. Ravens rally late past their rival Steelers in overtime PITTSBURGH – Justin Tucker made a 52-yard field goal with 5 minutes, 8 seconds left in overtime to give the Baltimore Ravens a 23-20 victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday night. Tucker tied it with 3 seconds to go in regulation after Pittsburgh’s Josh Scobee missed a pair of kicks that would have given the Steelers some cushion. Tucker then won it in the extra period after the Steelers failed to convert a pair of fourth downs in Baltimore territory. Justin Forsett ran for 150 yards for the Ravens (1-3). Joe Flacco threw a touchdown pass and did just enough late to help the Ravens end the worst start in franchise history. Michael Vick threw for 124 yards and a score while starting in place of injured Ben Roethlisberger, but the Steelers (2-2) bumbled late and Baltimore took advantage. Soccer FC Kansas City wins NWSL championship over Seattle PORTLAND, Ore. – Amy Rodriguez scored off a header in the 78th minute and FC Kansas City sent midfielder Lauren Holiday into retirement with a 1-0 victory over the Seattle Reign for the National Women’s Soccer League championship game Thursday night. Rodriguez scored off a cross from Heather O’Reilly. Just moments later there was a scary moment when Holiday went down and a stretcher was brought on to the field. Holiday walked to the sideline on her own and eventually returned for the final minutes of her last competitive game. Holiday announced plans to step away from the game in July, shortly after winning the FIFA Women’s World Cup with the U.S. national team, but she vowed to first finish out the season with her NWSL club. It was the Blues’ second consecutive championship. The two also met in the final match last season, with Kansas City winning 2-1.
