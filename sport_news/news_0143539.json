Posted: Wednesday, October 21, 2015 6:53 pm H.S. Football: Seals say welcome back to two-way lineman Strickler By Todd Hummel/The Daily Item DailyItem.com \nSELINSGROVE — Juvon Batts’ talent on the football field is unmatched, but maybe the most underrated talent the senior tailback possesses — ace recruiter. \nFellow senior Jacob Strickler didn’t come out for football for two seasons, so Batts spent last winter working on Strickler to come back out for football for this, his senior season. \n“Actually, Juvon made me come out for football,” the 6-foot-3, 255-pound senior joked. “He kept nagging me about it.” \n“He’s a big kid. He was always good, he just stopped playing, Batts said. “I kept telling him to come back out. He was really good in junior high. We’re really happy to have him back.” \nHead coach and defensive coordinator Derek Hicks certainly wasn’t going to turn down a player with the size and athletic ability of Strickler. \n“When I took over as head coach and I did the sign-ups, he came and said he was interested in playing,” Hicks said. “He’s been really dedicated since he came back out. He had a great spring session and really hit the weights. \n“From what we saw when he was a freshman, we thought he could be really good.” \nStrickler burst on the scene in the second game of the season from his defensive tackle position. He had 14 tackles against Mount Carmel, including three for a loss and a fumble recovery. \nFor the season, Strickler is tied for second on the team with 50 tackles and leads the team with three sacks. \nMaybe the biggest surprise for the Seals and Hicks is Strickler has been the starting left tackle since the first game of the season. \n“It was a pleasant surprise that he was able to step in at left tackle on the offensive line,” Hicks said. “He’s become a key two-way player for us.” \nOne help for Strickler on the offensive end was the fact that the Seals were changing their offensive system. He was learning right along with his teammates what line coach Pete Voss and offensive coordinator Derek Pope were expecting out of the offensive line. \n“I would say it helped that it was new for everybody,” Strickler said. “With all of us studying together and working on (the new offense) together, it really helped me visualize what I needed to do.” \nStrickler has been one of the key cogs on a Seals offense that is averaging 225 yards and six yards per carry on the ground. \nStrickler decided to not play football after his freshman season so he could concentrate on his grades. \n“I just kind of lost my love for the game,” Strickler said. “I had to concentrate on my grades.” \nHe was never far away from the program, though. \n“I was still at the games supporting my friends,” Strickler said. \nBut with Batts’ prodding, he began to reconsider his decision to give up on football. \n“I missed playing (football) and I missed playing with the guys,” Strickler said. \nBut if he was going to go back to play football, he was going to jump in with both feet. \n“It was my senior year, if I was going to play, my parents said I had to be committed to it,” Strickler said. “They’d make sure I was safe and healthy. \n“(My parents) were all for it.” \nStrickler also said his grades being up to par also played a big role in coming back. \n“I feel like I have more control over my grades,” Strickler said. “I’m much better at time management now.” \nStrickler, the son of Mike and Susan Strickler, also plays basketball and throws for the Seals track and field team.
