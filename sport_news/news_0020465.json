I don’t expect him to back out of that commitment.” \nBrian Dohn, a national recruiting analyst for Scout.com, said Miami’s offer, which is the first Krimin received since announcing his commitment to Rutgers in February, “speaks to his development as a player” and “is a big deal” for St. Joseph. \n“When you have a school like Miami coming in and offering a kid, it means other (colleges) are going to pay attention to your program,” Dohn said of the Falcons, who currently have 13 former or current players either competing in or committed to a college program. \n“Everybody thinks of North Jersey Catholic schools and they know St. John Vianney (in Holmdel). St. Joe’s is trying to build its program.” \nDohn said Miami head coach Al Golden, a Colts Neck native with strong New Jersey ties, continues to keep close tabs on Garden State talent and that his offer to Krimin after the St. Joseph star committed is not unique. \n“This is common practice now,” Dohn said. “Gone are the days when a kid verbals and his recruitment is over. A lot of times when a kid verbals it means his recruitment is about to start.” \nKrimin also holds offers from Pittsburgh, West Virginia, Duke, North Carolina State, Syracuse, Temple and Old Dominion. \nFlood learned of Krimin’s commitment to Rutgers prior to a Scarlet Knights men’s basketball game against Purdue eight months ago. \n“He’s a great coach,” Krimin told MyCentralJersey.com at the time. “He started off as a line coach here. He only wants the best for his players. He’s going to steer you in the right direction. I told him today he just gained another son with me committing. They go by the motto of family here, and in the end we are just one big family.” \nKrimin told Dohn last month that the recent off-field turmoil surrounding the Scarlet Knights did not adversely impact his commitment. \n“There is not really much they say,” Krimin told Dohn of his conversations with defensive coordinator Joe Rossi, who recruited him. “They said everything is going to be all right. \n“I trust them in everything they do. I really have nothing to worry about.” 14 CONNECT 26 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://mycj.co/1RMMJV5 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:36:45.780+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
