Ask the experts! \nPISCATAWAY, N.J. – It was Michael Thomas' 50-yard grip-and-rip of a J.T. Barrett pass midway through the second quarter on Saturday night that finally got the Ohio State offense off the launching pad on the way to a 49-7 romp over Rutgers.\n“I had to make a play, I had to make a play for my team, spark the offense, get 'em going,” said Thomas who, after catching the short out-cut pass shoved a would-be tackler to the ground with a stiff arm and sprinted to the end zone. The idea was “to show coach (Urban) Meyer we could expose the secondary.”\nThomas said that Barrett, who was 14 of 18 passing for 223 yards and three touchdowns, is adept at putting a pass in a spot that gives a receiver a chance to make a play after the catch.\n>> Get the most out of your Ohio State experience, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \n“He does a great job with it, the coaches call great plays, and we just execute at a high level,” said Thomas, who led the team with five catches for 103 yards.\nThe other two touchdown catches were hauled in by Jalin Marshall, who turned a shovel pass into an 11-yard play, and by Curtis Samuel, who grabbed a well-thrown, 30-yarder.\nThe game was played in front of a capacity crowd of 53,111, the fourth-largest in Rutgers history. And it was obvious to the OSU players, Thomas said, that the swell was due in large part to a huge OSU contingent.\n“It felt like a home game,” Thomas said. “They had our back 100 percent, and I respect them for that.”\ntmay@dispatch.com \n@TIM_MAYsports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:16:20.452+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
