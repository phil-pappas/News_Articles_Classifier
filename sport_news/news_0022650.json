Colts Coach Chuck Pagano was hoping to draw the Patriots into a mistake. Instead, receiver Griff Whalen inexplicably snapped the ball to safety Colt Anderson, who was immediately tackled for a 1-yard loss. \nThe bizarre play overshadowed everything else in one of this season’s most hyped games – the rematch of January’s AFC championship game, which spawned the “Deflategate” controversy.
