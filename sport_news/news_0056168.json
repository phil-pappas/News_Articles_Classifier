The comparison of LeBron James to Michael Jordan has been an ongoing debate for roughly five years now, and it’s one that may never end.\nAdChoices Jordan is the G.O.A.T., as he won six NBA championships and garnered Finals MVP honors in each of those seasons. He averaged over 30 points per game during the course of his NBA career, and many would agree that he was the most clutch player in the league’s history.\nThe former Bulls superstar played his final game in April 2003. Coincidentally, only three months later, James was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers. Many agree that James has been the most dominant player in the league since that time.\nBut is he in Jordan’s class? James thinks so. Check out what he recently said in an interview with GQ Magazine.\n“When I was a kid and I used to see guys wear MJ’s shoes when they played against MJ I’m like, ‘Oh, MJ got a little mental edge over those guys,'” James said . “So, for me, now being in that MJ class, if he’s not a real brother of mine, if you’re just a guy that’s just like, you actually just go to Foot Locker or somewhere, you just get a pair of ‘Brons and you want to wear them on a Tuesday night vs. me? I’m gonna bust your a——. Straight up.”\nYou see how he cleverly snuck that tidbit in there? The interview was supposed to be about sneakers, but he managed to work a Jordan comparison in there.\nSorry, LeBron, but this writer does not believe you’re in the same class as the G.O.A.T., who played one level above every other player in NBA history. If James manages to win at least two more rings, we can revisit the conversation at that time. But until then, Jordan remains on a level that no other player has played at throughout an entire career.\nOne thing James has never lacked is confidence, that’s for sure.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8AokP2baiVM"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:48:47.788+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
