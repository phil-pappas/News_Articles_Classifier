I was like, ‘No, it’s fourth down. You can come off the field,’” Bowen said with a laugh. “He had a big grin on his face.” \nIt’s moments like that — and players like Graham — that make Bowen glad he’s in the profession he’s in. \n“The kid really came a long ways,” Bowen said, “from being basically an off-the-street walk-on.” \nAsk Bowen how Graham ended up at KU, and he says he has no idea. \nAsk Graham — a 5-foot-9, 196-pound junior originally from New York — how he made it to Lawrence, and he calls it a “leap of faith.” \n“You build the dream or you build the picture in your head, and after you build it, you try to go get the supplies to implement how you see the vision working,” Graham said. “That’s what I did.” \nHis high school friends back in Easton, Pa., told him he was nuts. \nAfter earning honorable mention all-area honors at Easton Area High, Graham had no Division I offers and only a single offer to a Division II school: East Stroudsburg in Pennsylvania. \nStill, Graham wanted to prove he could play at a higher level. He’d seen some of KU's football team playing on television, and his father, Chris, had recently moved to Wichita to start a new job. \nGraham formulated a plan. He contacted KU’s football offices to ask about walk-on tryouts, then eventually decided he would enroll at KU even without a spot on the team. \nThere were no assurances. No one guaranteed that he would make the roster, and all he was told was to show up to the tryout date in January. \n“A lot of people would ask me, ‘Why would you go out there if you’re not really sure that it’s going to happen?’” Graham said. “I just believed in it at the time, and just kept focused on the same track.” \nFor a semester, he was like any other KU student. In 2013, he attended every home football game using a ticket while sitting in the student section. That included a 13-10 victory over Louisiana Tech when another walk-on — Matthew Wyman — hit a game-winning 52-yard field goal as time expired. \nAfter trying out for the team on a Sunday in January, Graham didn’t hear back from KU’s coaching staff. He finally called the offices, only to be told that he had, in fact, made the team, but that the coaches hadn’t contacted him because his paperwork wasn’t in line. \n“When that happened, it was like, ‘At least I have a foot in the door,’” Graham said. “‘Now, let’s see what I can do with it.’” \nHe ended up doing plenty. \nAfter playing in four games on special teams last year without recording any statistics, Graham has emerged as a defensive starter in KU’s last two games, posting eight tackles against both ISU and Baylor. \n“He did some really nice things,” KU coach David Beaty said, “but he also made some mistakes that young guys make, guys that haven't had a lot of experience.” \nGraham also isn’t taking it easy academically. A chemical engineering major, he says studying receivers is enjoyable compared to his thermodynamics homework. \n“Thermo, you never really understand what you’re doing. You just know that A plus B yields C somehow,” Graham said. “I’d rather watch hours of football receivers. Trust me.” \nGraham — his original name is “Chevrick,” though he received the nickname “Chevy” from a public-address announcer at an eighth-grade football game — is most proud that his work in the film room now can lead to results on the field. \n“Although I’ve accomplished a lot, there’s still other things I can accomplish,” Graham said. “It is definitely a great experience, having everything play out the way it’s playing out right now.” \nGraham, who says he’s a quiet guy by nature, admits he didn’t know how to celebrate after making that tackle against ISU on third-and-4. He was excited but didn’t exactly know how to show it. \nThere’s still time to work on that in the weeks to come. \n“It’s a lot different being in the stands than being on the field,” Graham said with a smile. “It’s definitely an opportunity you’ve got to be thankful for.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:03:58.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
