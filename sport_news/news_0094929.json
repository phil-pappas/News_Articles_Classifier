On one of those evenings, in the same water I had just thoroughly fished, I caught eight bass in 30 minutes, all 17 inches or better. On the second evening, under identical circumstances, I caught 12 bass, seven of which were at least 17 inches long. \nThat taught me something I wish I’d learned a lot sooner. \nBecause not only is it more fun to catch big bass; it also more fun to catch any fish on a topwater lure. \nWith a submerged lure, you can only feel and imagine the ferocity of a smallmouth bass strike. When a smallmouth strikes a topwater lure, you feel, hear and see it and, no matter how mentally prepared for it you may be, it will startle you. \nl Comments: (319) 934-3172; orlan.love@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:44:52.423+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
