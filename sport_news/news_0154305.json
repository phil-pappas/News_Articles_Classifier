Michael came in a trade with Seattle three weeks ago. \nRandle had 85 yards on his first three carries, but just 2 on his final 11 runs last weekend against Atlanta. Dallas couldn't hold a two-touchdown lead in a 39-28 loss. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:04:26.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
