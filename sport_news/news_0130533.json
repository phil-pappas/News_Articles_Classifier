Haddix said she reviewed the autopsy done by Dr. Robert Lawrence, a pathologist. \nThe report was “pretty brief,” she said, and the fatal injuries were not described in much detail. \nDuring Haddix’s testimony, multiple photographs were displayed of Leila’s wounds. \nIn one photograph, Leila was shown lying on her back, her eyes closed, with multiple medical pads placed on her at Mark Twain Medical Center in San Andreas. \nStab wounds covered her body. \nHaddix said she was given more than 50 photographs. \nSome did not have clear scales, she said, which would have been useful for measurement purposes. \nHaddix also reviewed other items, including a kitchen knife seized from the home that had Leila’s blood underneath the handle. \nHaddix believes Leila was on her stomach due to the blood found near her closet that seeped underneath the carpet where she was found on her back. \n“In some fashion she was rolled over — whether it was on her accord or by someone else,” Haddix said, due to the majority of stab wounds on Leila’s chest area. \nHaddix added that, in a murder, blood would appear on an assailant who stabbed a victim more so than any other method. \n“Stabbing is a pretty intimate process,” she said. “It involves being in close proximity.” \nDana Pfeil, Calaveras County deputy district attorney, asked whether there were many ways to do pathology work. Haddix said not all pathologists do things the same way. \nKenton S. Wong, senior forensic scientist of Forensic Analytical Sciences Inc., also said he believed at one point Leila was lying on her stomach. \n“Somehow she was turned over,” he said. \nBradley Swanson, assistant lab director of the California State Department of Justice, testified for the prosecution on Sept. 21 that the attack appeared to have begun on the top bunk of Leila’s room. \n“At some point she would either have to be moved from that location, or propelled off,” Swanson said, due to the lack of blood found in between the bed and closet. \n“Most likely she was carried in some fashion,” Wong said Thursday. “There was no trail of blood.” \nWong added that Leila “definitely” would have been bleeding at that time due to the multiple stab wounds on the front of her body. \nSgt. Greg Stark of the Calaveras County Sheriff’s Department testified Thursday he investigated the vacant house near Leila’s house around the time of the killing to make sure no one was in the home. \n“It did not look like somebody was living there,” he said, adding that no one was located in the house. “It did not appear that anybody had been there for some time.” \nOn Wednesday, a 17-year-old girl testified she and a friend explored the vacant house a week to a week and a half prior to Leila’s murder. \nThey went in through an unlocked door connected to the garage and saw beer cans on the floor in one of the bedrooms and a television that was playing static. \nIn the kitchen, paper towels and an opened box of saltine crackers were on the counter, she said. \nWhile in the kitchen, the girl said she heard an adult male’s voice say, “Get out.” \nThe girls ran to her house on Hartvickson Lane, one street over from Leila’s. \nStark said he did not remember seeing any items described by the 17-year-old. \nThe crime was reported shortly after noon on April 27, 2013. Leila Fowler was pronounced dead at Mark Twain Medical Center in San Andreas shortly afterward. \nThe defendant, whose name is not being used because he is a juvenile, was arrested May 11, 2013. He is not being tried as an adult, but his trial is being held in open court due to a statute that allows juvenile murder trials to be public. \nThe trial, which began Sept. 15, is scheduled to resume Monday, and the defense team, Mark Reichel and Steve Plesser, estimated they will conclude then.
