Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford (7) scrambles out of the pocket against the New York Giants on Monday night at Lincoln Financial Field in Philadelphia. (CHRIS KNIGHT / SPECIAL TO THE MORNING CALL) Nick Fierro Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call #Eagles emerge from slop with big victory over NFC East rival New York. \nPHILADELPHIA — Sloppy football reigned, but so did the Philadelphia Eagles' defensive line. \nOn Monday night, that was all the Eagles needed to somehow catapult themselves into a first-place tie in the NFC East with a 27-7 triumph over the visiting New York Giants at Lincoln Financial Field. \nThe Giants (3-3), who committed just three turnovers in their first five games, had that many by halftime of this one, and it was the only reason the Eagles (3-3) were able to go to intermission with a 17-7 advantage. \nQuarterback Eli Manning passed for 162 yards in the first half but was victimized by two interceptions, including one that was returned for a touchdown by cornerback Nolan Carroll in the second quarter. \nAfter opening the game with a dazzling 80-yard touchdown drive, capped off by a 13-yard strike to Odell Beckham, Manning and the Giants never sniffed the end zone again, thanks to an offense that self-destructed the few times its offensive line wasn't throttled by the men on the other side of the line of scrimmage. \nPHOTO GALLERY: The Eagles take on the Giants on Monday Night Football from Lincoln Financial Field \nThough the Eagles and quarterback Sam Bradford (24-for-38, 280 yards, three interceptions) were equally inconsistent on offense, they made enough plays to have the game all but sealed by the time the fourth quarter began. \nLate in the first quarter, on a drive set up by a DeMeco Ryans interception, Bradford drove the team 78 yards for a touchdown, hitting Riley Cooper with a 32-yard pass to finish it off. \nJust as impressive was the play right before it — a 15-yard reception by Josh Huff in which fellow wide receiver Miles Austin sealed off the left side with a devastating block to spring Huff. \nPHOTO GALLERY: See photos of the Eagles cheerleaders and fans at Monday night's game against the Giants. \n\"It's an important part of our job to be able to block,\" Austin said. \"It's not always easy, but we've got to do our best regardless. \nCarroll described his TD as a \"bang-bang thing. I saw Eli looking at [Dwayne Harris], threw it and I just caught it and ran with it.\" \nLater in the second quarter, Caleb Sturgis kicked a 37-yard field goal with 3 seconds left to increase the Eagles' cushion. \nThe second half began for the Eagles much the way the first half unfolded for them offensively. Jordan Matthews fumbled away a reception to end the first series, and they went three-and-out on the second — only to be bailed out by a penalty for running into the kicker that put the offense back on the field. \nEight plays later, DeMarco Murray ran 12 yards for a touchdown and a 24-7 lead. \nMurray finished with 109 rushing yards. \nAnother Sturgis field goal — this time from 39 yards with 8:23 remaining in the game — sealed it for the Eagles, who after the Giants' first series played their most complete defensive game of the year. \nNot only did the Eagles sack Manning three times, but they held the Giants to 247 net yards and just 18 first downs. \nBut it was the defense that dominated, sacking Manning three times and forcing him to take two intentional grounding penalties while holding the Giants to 247 net yards. \nThey especially did the job on the Giants' most dangerous receiver, Beckham, who finished with a game-high seven receptions, but for only 61 total yards. \n\"We had him doubled a lot of the night,\" Eagles defensive coordinator Billy Davis said. \"Even when he caught a couple, we had a lot of attention his way. Other than the touchdown — that was the only breakdown we had — the rest of the night we put a lot of attention on him. \n\"Eli is playing as well as he's played and the offense is really working at a high level. And our guys came to play tonight. They played with great effort and technique.\" \nRyans was responsible for two of the turnovers as well as his normal calming influence when chaos threatened early. \n\"We just had to get it together,\" the inside linebacker said, \"and we had a little communication issue, just had to come back and refocus things, get back on the right track.\" \nEqually encouraging was the running game producing 155 yards, 109 for DeMarco Murray, who oddly enough did not start despite the groin injury backup Ryan Mathews had going in. But Murray wound up with the bulk of the carries and exhibited the kind of fresh legs that many thought he had lost. \nIn the end, the Eagles did more than enough to overcome three interceptions tossed by Bradford to gain that first-place tie and take command of their destiny again in what has so far been a mediocre division.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:43:16.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
