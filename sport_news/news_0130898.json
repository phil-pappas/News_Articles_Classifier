Real Quote: s. Nothing fabricated.\nâ€” evan rosenblum (@EvanTMZ) September 30, 2015 NEOMG asked coach Mike Pettine on Wednesday if he believes that three of his players talked anonymously to TMZ. He declined to answer.\n\"I've said all I'm going to say on that,'' he said.\nGuard John Greco said Pettine addressed the team about the report Wednesday.\n\"He was just like, 'I can't imagine anyone saying that.''\nWhen initially asked about the report Wednesday, Pettine said he's certain his locker room is unified.\n\"We're confident in that our players know that my door is open, that their position coach's door is open, that the coordinator's door is open,'' he said. \"We have a leadership council, where there's a player in each room, so there's certainly resources available.\n\"Are we going to have 1000% agreement on how we're using players and how we're doing that? No, but it falls into coaches coach and players go out, they have their jobs to do.\n\"Are they going to have opinions? Certainly. I'm confident that there's no rift in the locker room. I think the way our players reacted signifies that. We always talk about controlling the controlables, and external debate, as you put it, is something that we don't control, so we're confident in our plan and we'll move ahead, forward with it.''\nJosh McCown on TMZ Johnny Manziel report of riff in the Browns locker room Cleveland Browns quarterback Josh McCown discusses the TMZ Sports report from yesterday that stated three anonymous offensive starters said they thought Johnny Manziel gave them a better chance of winning. Dave Andersen, Northeast Ohio Media Group\nPettine said he's addressed the team on occasion about not talking off the record, but didn't say he specifically talked to them about the TMZ report, in which three offensive starters anonymously demanded Manziel be put back on the field.\n\"We've talked to the team periodically just about media policy and if you want to (talk), put your name on something. As far as multiple players being off the record, we talk to them about it, but that's not something that I'm concerned with,'' he said.\n\"I know it makes for good copy and clicks outside of here but given the veterans that we have in the room and being on inside and talking to the players constantly, and getting feedback whether it's other coaches or other players, and getting a sense for the pulse of the locker room, I'm confident this is not an issue.''\nAsked if the controversy puts Josh McCown in a tough spot, Pettine said he's not worried about his starting quarterback.\n\"There aren't too many NFL quarterbacks that aren't in a 'tough' spot,'' he said. \"It comes with the job. I think he has tremendous mental toughness. He's been in this league a long time, and whether he's personally gone through it, or a quarterback that he's worked with has gone through it, I don't think he's any stranger to situations like this, so I think that would be the least of our problems, worrying about how Josh is handling this.''\nOn Tuesday, TMZ Sports posted the report on tmz.com, with the headline that Browns players are furious over Manziel's benching.\n\"I love both Johnny and Josh but its (messed) up when you have Johnny come in and play well and has proven to the team that he is the right person for the job,\" one player was Quote: d anonymously as saying by the site. \"It's frustrating to him and us when you sit a player down when he is playing well. Coach has got to understand you are messing up the chemistry and timing with players and its (messed) up.\"\nAnother anonymous player was Quote: d by TMZ Sports, \"The team plays better when [Manziel] is in the game. I play better when he plays.\n\"You can't get better unless you play. We won when he played and coach has got to trust him like he trusts Josh.\"\nA third anonymous player was Quote: d: \"When Johnny in the game it puts the defense on edge. He doesn't just sit in the pocket, he makes plays. Coach has got to make the change now.\"\nShortly after the report hit, Hawkins tweeted that it's \"%1000 made up.''\nLater that afternoon, NEOMG talked to all five Browns starting offensive linemen, most of whom doubted that three of their teammates would vent to TMZ. All of them said it wasn't them. One, center Alex Mack, acknowledged it was possible that three of their teammates did so.\n\"I think it's not a great way to go about it,'' he said. \"I think we should also keep a lot of things within the team, and I don't see a reason to go out and speak behind someone's back about anything.''\nThomas agreed with Hawkins that the story, which has no by-line, was fabricated.\n\"My first take was that it sounded like a story that came from The Onion and not TMZ, not that TMZ's really a reputable news source with hard-hitting journalism,'' Thomas said. \"But to me it was just something that was crafted from thin air.'' Thomas added, \"I'd be surprised if it even happened.''\nThomas said the language in the Quote: s strained credulity.\n\"They used the word 'chemistry,''' he said. \"Media and coaches use the word 'chemistry,' not players.''\nHe stressed that the communication with the coaching staff is good and that the door is always open.\n\"We feel that if there was some deep-seated revolution going on backing Johnny over Josh, I think the coaches would listen and they would take what we have to say seriously and bring that into the equation,'' said Thomas. \"But I just don't really give the story a whole lot of credit because I think it's off-base.''\nRight guard John Greco was equally skeptical about the report, which did not have a by-line.\n\"Initially my reaction was I wanted to know if anyone said it because I can't imagine any of our guys saying that,'' he said. \"We have full support in Josh -- as well as Johnny -- but that's not the type of room we are. I can't see any of our guys doing that. I just can't think of who it would be.\n\"There's no reason for anyone to hide behind anything. If someone has an opinion, they should bring it up and I know we all would. When I read that, my thought was, 'I kind of find that hard to believe,' but we'll see.''", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EvanTMZ/status/649235936018956288"], "published": "2015-09-30T23:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:45:16.758+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
