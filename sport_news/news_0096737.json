It is a festivity that has been celebrated with gusto for many decades. Pontiac’s all-time winningest coach, Mick Peterson, was a huge fan of the Homecoming Game. He saw his teams winning this game just as important as the dance the following night. Current head coach Buck Casson is also a fan of Homecoming. “I enjoy it and I think most of our guys just have a good time throughout the week and have a lot more fun,” Casson said Wednesday after practice. “I could tell at practice tonight that they are having fun.” Having fun might be the key for Homecoming success. Some coaches have seen the activities during the week as being a possible detriment. But Casson sees it in a different light. “Sometimes we take things a little bit too serious. We try to stay focused but we can have fun,” Casson said. The opponent for Homecoming is Eureka, a school that is leaving the Corn Belt Conference after this school year. The Hornets are coming off their first win of the season and will be trying to put a damper on the PTHS festivities. It will be a difficult task as long as the Indians are able to bounce back from a playoff-type week. Pontiac’s gauntlet of facing Mahomet-Seymour on Monday and then having three days to prepare for Central Catholic results in a 1-1 mark. Although it dropped the Tribe out of first place in the league standings, it did provide the troops with a glimpse of what playoff football used to be like before 1994. The loss on Friday to Central Catholic also doesn’t seem to have damped spirits. The Indians battled with enthusiasm on the practice field while also having some fun. It was a more vocal event that other Wednesday practices. “Today was a sharp practice for us,” Casson said. “I felt defensively and special teams-wise we had attitude and tempo that we need to have to compete.” The defense will be looking to make the Hornets look like the team that scored just seven points in a three-week stretch of losses to Mahomet, Central Catholic and U-High. “We are going to have to have an assignment-oriented defense, which we didn’t do last week, so I’m sure they’re licking their chops a bit,” Casson said. “It’s a wing-slot type of an offense — a lot of different things that look the same. “We’re going to try to get them in third-and-long or second–and-double-digit situations. Something they are not comfortable with.” Page 2 of 2 - The pass has been Pontiac’s Achilles heel on defense. There was trouble with tackling last week against the Saints, but a lot of teams have had issues stopping Brett Segobiano and Ryan Zitkus. As for the offense, the Indians ran into problems running the ball. Casson sees Eureka potentially creating issues, as well. “They roll guys in and out. They like to blitz and play solid defense,” Casson said. “This is a copycat league, I’m sure they will be looking at some of what (others) have been doing and base their scheme off of what others have had success with.” It will be the line play that will be key. It is up to those up front to give Levi Ransom and Vaughn Hobart running room, as well as provide protection for Seth Cunningham. Pontiac’s speed should be an asset if it can be utilized. “We have to progress as an offense,” Casson said. “We’re running a lot of similar things and practicing other things. Hopefully we will be sharp on some of those aspects.” A win pushes the Indians to 4-2 on the season and 4-1 in the conference. Road dates at Olympia and U-High will follow.
