More >> SHREVEPORT, LA (KSLA) - \nA bar named as the \"Best Sports Bar in North America\" by ESPN, will soon have a location in Shreveport. \nEarlier this year, a Shreveport restaurateur signed on to bring Walk-On's Bistreaux & Bar franchise to Northwest Louisiana. \nAccording to former LSU football star Jacob Hester, the sports bar is expected to open mid to late October. He said the owner was trying to shoot for the LSU versus South Carolina game on Oct. 10, but it might be a week or so later. \nIn January, Walk-On's Enterprises released a statement that the franchise executed a franchise agreement with Shreveport native Chris McJunkins. \nWalk-On's is co-owned by New Orleans Saints Superstar Drew Brees and his wife Brittany. \nMcJunkins, who heads up a partnership group formed for the venture that includes former LSU football star Jacob Hester and former LSU baseball star Todd Walker, becomes the third franchisee to sign-on with Walk-On's. \nWalk-On's currently has four locations â€“ two in Baton Rouge and one each in New Orleans and Lafayette. \nCopyright 2015 KSLA .
