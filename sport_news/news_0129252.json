(Photo: Stephen Brashear, Getty Images) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE National writers react to the bizarre conclusion of the Lions' loss to the Seahawks Monday night: \nDoug Farrar, Sports Illustrated: The Lions had only themselves to blame before the strange call. Many of the same issues that had plagued Detroit throughout this season showed up again here -- spotty production, questionable play-calling, and an inability to sustain drives at a repeatable rate. Matthew Stafford completed 24 of 35 passes for just 203 yards, and overthrew Calvin Johnson on several vertical boundary routes. The Lions amassed just 53 rushing yards on 18 carries, which won't help their league-worst ground game. Johnson led the team with seven receptions for 56 yards, which is not the kind of numbers one would expect from a player of his magnitude. The defense played well against a Seattle offense that was playing without the injured Marshawn Lynch, and is sporting perhaps the worst offensive line in the NFL, but in the end, none of that mattered.\nChris Wesseling, NFL.com: As is the case with the rest of the NFL's most disappointing outfits, the Lions have been undone by an offensive line that simply can't block effectively. Play-caller Joe Lombardi's ongoing inability to unlock the obvious talents of playmakers such as Calvin Johnson, Golden Tate and Ameer Abdullah is exacerbating the issue. Matthew Stafford has now gone seven consecutive games without a 300-yard performance, his longest such stretch since his first seven career starts.\nDavid Steele, Sporting News: The Lions choked. Just not as big as the officials. The Lions will pay for their mistakes. The zebras should not make them pay extra. The Lions are 0-4, the NFL's last winless team. Coach Jim Caldwell won't get graded on a curve. He won't be soothed by the notion that, well, that should've been a win. The NFL isn't bringing both teams back to finish the last 1:45. The explanation by the league wasn't its finest hour. It was a play that resulted in a turnover, in the end zone yet, but as head of officiating Dean Blandino said on NFL Network, it wasn't reviewable. He revealed that what seemed pretty black-and-white was actually a judgment call, about whether the act was \"overt.\" That's no way to oversee a sport like this, with so much riding on its outcomes and so much sunk into it by players and everybody else.\nDETROIT NEWS\nNiyo: Fumble, batted ball are double punch to Lions' gut\nSheil Kapadia, ESPN: When you're on the right side of a botched call, it's easy to say the breaks will even out and one play didn't determine the result. But for the Seahawks, it's worth acknowledging they could easily be staring 1-3 in the face with a trip to Cincinnati looming. \"Now that you look at it, we're fortunate on that one,\" Seahawks coach Pete Carroll said.\"\nSean Wagner-McGough, CBS Sports: After the game, ESPN's crew of analysts on location -- former NFL players Steve Young, Ray Lewis and Trent Dilfer -- all seemed shocked by the rule. And really, the only explanation would be that the official in the end zone also wasn't aware of the rule. Because the play clearly unfolded right in front of him. ... Regardless, instead of the Lions having the ball just inches away from the end zone, the Seahawks escaped.\nSeahawks players celebrate and the Lions' Calvin Johnson sits stunned after losing the ball right before the goal line, causing a touchback instead of a touchdown late in the fourth quarter of a 13-10 loss.
