It’s not easy to watch,” Ioane said. “It’s frustrating to see guys not in the right positions to make plays. As a coach you’ve got to find ways to get guys to battle back. \n“For us, we’ve got to find a way regardless if they hit a big play and score a touchdown to bounce back, snap back in it, reset our minds and get focused on the next series and get a stop. We’ve got to have that next-play attitude.” \nAsh and Ioane both said a few positions on defense have been opened up for competition this week, though neither divulged what they are. \nMeanwhile, Ash and the defensive coaches are looking at MSU’s issues from three angles — scheme, personnel and technique — and that the team will continue to divvy up its practice workload in an effort to create as many reps as possible. \n“We’re making some adjustments on the scheme, we’re talking about some minor personnel changes, a couple spots here and there that we might make some adjustments, and technique comes from teaching,” Ash said. “That’s what we have to focus on. How are we teaching the game to try and get these guys in the right spots more often? That’s the agenda. \n“We made some major (practice) changes before the Sac State game and divided up our defensive team periods into a run period and a pass period going on simultaneously so we could double our reps, and we thought that was very effective. We continued it last week and obviously didn’t get the results that we wanted. But I think that’s something that we will continue to implement. \n“The other thing we want to do is be more systematic in the way we line up plays against different calls. We had a play or two in the game that we practiced against but never got it against the right call in the game, and we didn’t defend it properly. We’re going to be more systematic about taking favorite plays and making sure we run those plays maybe even consecutively to get them up against every defense call, and hopefully that will improve performance as well. \n“Believe me, we’re working on a lot of different strategies here.” Injury report \nA few notes on MSU’s injury status: \nAsh said running back Gunnar Brekke will miss the ETSU game with a concussion. Brekke was injured early against Portland State and did not return. \nAlso, Ash said right guard Kyle Godecke, who suffered a neck injury against PSU, is questionable. He did not practice Tuesday. If Godecke can’t play, backup Dylan Mahoney will start. \nLinebacker Fletcher Collins will not play this week. He is still hindered by a right hand/thumb injury. Ash said Collins is on target to begin practice next week. Ash also said safety Bryson McCabe (knee) is “possible” to play.
