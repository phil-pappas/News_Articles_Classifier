I wanted to get a good start and see who was up there the first mile and kind of go from there.\"\nWhen she runs a fast time, however, it almost 100 percent translates into a win for Keklak. She ran with a pack that included Rebecca Grusby and Clared Martin of Newton South and Bishop Feehan's Abigail Long through a comfortable 5:38 opening mile before throwing in a surge and breaking the tape in 17 minutes, 25.16 seconds for the lightning fast 3.1-mile layout. Martin was 11 seconds back in 17:36.98 and Long was a strong third in 17:39.27. Grusby, one of the most consistent harriers in the state, was fourth in 17:45.95 and Weymouth's Kelly Higgins took fifth in 18:23.94.\nKelkak bore down in the second mile to put distance between herself and the pack and was able to coast home the final mile. \"Through the second mile I got them,\" she said. \"I just maintained through the third mile.\"\nKeklak led the Warriors to the team title with 58 points in front of Newton South (90 points) and Bishop Feehan (109 points).\nThe Div. 1 boys race was a burner from the gun as a whopping 15 runners dipped under 16 minutes. It was Western Mass that took away the bragging rights as Liam Sullivan of Northampton edged out Cambridge's Esu Alemseged 15:16.28 to 15:17.27 for the victory.\nWellesley standout Tom D'Anieri continued his strong autumn of running by taking third in 15:23.88. Cambridge's Daniel Aschale of Cambridge was fourth in 15:31.14 and Peter Monahan led St. John's of Shrewsbury to the team title with his fifth-place finish of 15:34.85.\nZach Rolfe of Parker Charter took the Div. 2 event in a quick 15:47.41 in front of Coyle & Cassidy's Joseph Gill, who was 10 clicks back in 15:57.60. Rolfe's teammate Nico Agosta was third with a 16:01.89. The always-tough Hopedale sqaud edged out Wakefield for the team win 101 to 115 with Norwell right in the hunt with 118 points.\nBellingham's speedy Sarah Edwards was victorious in Div. 2 girls, holding off Milton's duo of Bridget Mitchell and Collette O'Leary with her 17:51.44. Mitchell crossed the finish line in 17:57.68 and O'Leary posted an 18:09.38. The Wildcats decimated the team competition with a stingy 46 points, well ahead of runner-up Lenox's 117 points. Parker Charter took the bronze with 133 points.", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share?text=HIGH+SCHOOL+CROSS-COUNTRY%3A+Highlights+from+the+Barnstable+Twi-light+Meet"], "published": "2015-10-25T22:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T17:42:23.232+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
