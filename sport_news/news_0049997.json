Not before the first game, but in the close future, we will be good. I hope so.\"\nFor about 45 minutes, assistant coaches Tyronn Lue and Larry Drew along with assistant player development coach Vitaly Potapenko worked with Mozgov on his post moves. They stressed the need to back his defender down for closer field goal opportunities and urged him not to settle for long hooks outside of the paint. The staff put him through a great deal of repetitions, then instruction, followed by more reps.\nAt one point, a discouraged-looking Mozgov pointed to his knee as to why he couldn't move like he wanted. Yet still, he continued on.\nThe organization has been cautious with his workload.\nOf the three back-to-back sets Cleveland had on its schedule during the preseason, Mozgov only participated in the final pair. He wanted to see how his knee would feel after a back-to-back before the regular season tipped off on Oct. 27 against the Chicago Bulls.\n\"I'm happy with how my body responded to back-to-back, but I'm still not happy where my body is at right now,\" he said. \"[I'm not happy] by the shape, by my knee, whatever.\"\nIt's clearly an annoying situation. When he was first asked about the knee, he responded: \"You asked me again, so you want the same answer?\"\nHead coach David Blatt was under the weather and did not speak to media. So how he plans to utilize Varejao in practices before the season remains unknown.\nConsidering Mozgov made it through the exhibition season averaging 24.8 minutes over five games, he appears to be headed on the right track. But it appears there's going to be more pain and frustration before a full bill of health follows.\n\"I think it's not really bad,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T23:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:40:07.524+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
