These include laying the foundation stone of Rs-10 crore vegetable market at Mehandli. Being constructed in an area of 34.17 bighas, the marketing yard would have 26 shops with an auction platform of 600 square metre to facilitate local growers and farmers. It would cater to the marketing needs of apple producing belts of Rohru, Chirgaon, Dodra-Kawar and a few panchayats of Jubbal tehsil. The Chief Minister directed the marketing board to immediately release a sum of Rs 3 crore for the vegetable market. “Opportunities were being explored to tap tourism potential on slopes of Chanshal in Rohru area as developing slopes and ropeways requires a lot of paraphernalia. Serious efforts are being made in this direction,” said Virbhadra while replying to a query after performing foundation stone laying ceremony of phase-I of new marketing yard/ vegetable market at Rohru. The Chief Minister said the process of selection of site for multi-level parking and commercial complex at Rohru was underway. He inaugurated Mehandali bridge completed with an outlay of Rs 7 crore. He inaugurated Mehandali-Bakhrina by-pass road constructed at a cost of Rs 75 lakh and Rs 3.50 crore CA store of the HPMC at Rohru. The CM also performed bhoomi pujans of the Parsa-Dhara-Shekhal road to cost Rs 7.58 crore and the Rohru-Brara-Sharog road to be constructed at a cost of Rs 3.75 crore. The roads will benefit a population of over one thousand. Addressing a public meeting at Parsa in gram panchayat Shekhal in Rohru tehsil, the Chief Minister said that the Congress came to power in the state in a democratic manner. “Blaming me for unaccounted income by Dhumals was witch hunting and unfortunate as I have nothing to hide. All I have has been inherited from my ancestors”, he said, adding that the only way of saving the BJP was by way of removing PK Dhumal from the party.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:55:55.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
