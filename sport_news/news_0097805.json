Tennis Coaches Association 3-A rankings, swept past Jacksonville 6-0 on Tuesday in the first round of the NCHSAA 3-A girls’ tennis playoffs. The Cardinals, who won the Coastal Conference for the third time in four years, finish 12-2. “Today was tough,” JHS coach David Fleischer said. “Actually, some of those matches, especially at three through six, were a little closer than the scores indicate. We only played singles and it was a solid two hours. “We couldn’t ask much more from these girls considering we lost our top two players from last year. We have five of six back and next year I expect us to win the conference and maybe with an older team be able to compete a little better in the first round of the playoffs.” SINGLES: Bryant (RM) d.
