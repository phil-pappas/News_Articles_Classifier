And though the Wildcats were valiant in a comeback effort, it’s hard to shake the feeling of a team reeling, searching for answers.\nBOX SCORE: Washington State 45, Arizona 42\nRodriguez isn't happy, and neither are his players.\n“What would you expect after a loss?” wide receiver Nate Phillips said. “Ain’t nothing special to it.”\nWith the loss, Arizona dropped to 5-3 and 2-3 in the Pac-12 , and are now closer to the bottom of the Pac-12 South standings than the top. It’s a far cry from a team that only lost two conference games and won the South last year.\nThis week, the Wildcats head to Seattle for a late-night game against Washington (3-4, 1-3). It's a game that both teams need to win for a real shot at bowl eligibility.\nArizona then faces a gauntlet of USC, Utah and Arizona State to finish the season.\nBoth teams are coming off tough losses, and both are badly in need of a breakthrough game.The Huskies, who lost 31-14 to Stanford on Saturday night, finish their schedule with games against Utah, ASU, Oregon State and Washington State.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Wildcats 2015 football schedule\n“The bottom line is these guys get it; there’s a scoreboard there for a reason and when that doesn’t come out in our favor they feel it,” Washington coach Chris Petersen told reporters after Saturday’s loss. “We all feel it. The only way to get rid of that feeling is to go out and play better and get a win. That’s the bottom line. They’ve been a pretty resilient crew; they have. I’m encouraged that they’re going to show up to work tomorrow. We’re going to get better and play better next Saturday.”\nWhen Arizona and Washington face off, it will be a battle of polar opposites.\nUA leads the Pac-12 in scoring, total yards, rushing yards and first downs. Against Washington State, UA scored 40-plus points for the fifth time and ran for 176 yards.\nOn the opposite end, Arizona’s defensive performance in recent weeks has been woeful. The Wildcats have allowed the most points in the Pac-12 this season, including 76 the last two weeks to Washington State and Colorado. Washington State quarterback Luke Falk set an opponent record Saturday with 514 passing yards.\nAZCENTRAL\nArizona Wildcats XTRA app: Get latest news, scores\nFor the Huskies, it’s all about the defense. Heading into the Stanford game, the Huskies had the Pac-12’s best defense in both scoring and yards. On Oct. 8, Washington held a talented USC offense to just 12 points in an upset win in Los Angeles.\n“We always want to score aggressively so it doesn’t matter who we play,” UA receiver Cayleb Jones said. “It’s always frustrating when we don’t put up a lot of points.”\nWashington's offense has been the issue in 2015. The Huskies will be the third team this season to start a true freshman at quarterback in Jake Browning — he missed the Stanford game but is expected to play this week. Browning is averaging 222 passing yards per game with six touchdowns and five interceptions.\nWashington has a stud at running back in Myles Gaskin, a true freshman who has run for 100-plus yards in three consecutive games.\n“We keep guys covered up and we see Myles being able to find the creases,” Petersen said.\nOutside of Gaskin, though, Washington has struggled — its offense averages 24 points per game, 11th-most in the Pac-12. The team has the second-worst rushing offense and is the worst at converting first downs.\nPetersen said Saturday night “down the road, we’ll be a good football team — but not tonight.”\nFor both Arizona and Washington, this game might just show who’s good enough for this year’s postseason.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6c47d660a401556d2cda0cdf550493e6d1fa9b13/c=87-0-612-525/local/-/media/2015/08/26/Phoenix/Phoenix/635762183712997114-arizonawildcats.jpg", "http://azcentral.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-boxscores.aspx?page=/data/NCAAF/results/2015-2016/boxscore48669.html", "http://azcentral.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-standings.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/standings/2015-2016/league/standings.html#11", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5092cf79f98a0760aa3e8e0141664bda15af2760/c=507-0-3327-2821/local/-/media/Phoenix/Phoenix/2014/09/16/1410914255000-arizona-stadium10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T01:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:36:59.160+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
