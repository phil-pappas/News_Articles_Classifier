But four days later he announced he would stand down when a new election is held on February 26.\nDespite the new allegations, Blatter said he will carry on until the election.\n\"I will fight until February 26. For me. And for FIFA,\" he told Bunte, a German magazine.\n\"I am convinced that evil will come into the light and good will triumph.\"\nPlatini had been favorite to win the election until the Swiss investigation named him. His entourage said that he did not appear before the FIFA commission this week and that he feels he has done nothing wrong.\n\"The president feels that he has given satisfactory explanations to the authorities that are dealing with this case,\" Platini's spokesman, Pedro Pinto, told reporters in London.\nPlatini, Chung and Prince Ali bin al-Hussein, a former FIFA vice president from Jordan, are the main candidates for the election so far.\nChung is under investigation because of his lobbying for South Korea's bid for the 2022 World Cup, which Qatar controversially won.\nThe South Korean tycoon says FIFA has cleared him of the charges once in 2012 and that the new charges are part of a Blatter campaign to block his bid for the presidency.\nChung returned to the attack on Wednesday at the Leaders Sport Business convention in London, saying Swiss lawyers could launch a $100 million \"embezzlement\" case against Blatter.\nChung, a FIFA vice president for 17 years until 2011, condemned what he called Blatter's \"secretive\" ways in not declaring his salary and taking payments without permission.\n\"FIFA has become a badge of shame,\" he said. \"In short Mr Blatter is a hypocrite and a liar.\"\nChung said the FIFA ethics committee has sought a 15 year ban against him. He called it a \"smear campaign\" by Blatter.\nLate Wednesday, the Doha-based International Center for Sport Security (ICSS) said that claims of a suspension for Blatter was \"a defining moment\".\n\"Football, not just FIFA stands on the precipice of disaster,\" said Chris Eaton, the ICSS executive director.\n\"It is now absolutely vital that the entire governance structure of world football, not just FIFA, is independently restructured by credible figures...in order to restore trust and ensure the integrity of the game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:19:25.645+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
