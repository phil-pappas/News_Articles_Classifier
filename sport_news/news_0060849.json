It was like a collective “enough is enough” went around the team. \nAnd the coaching staff showed them exactly what they needed to do to get over the hump. \n“It’s a mindset,” Florida Tech football coach Steve Englehart said after the Panthers defeated West Alabama 24-13 on Saturday night. “Our mindset of making winning a habit has started to take over these past couple of weeks.” Florida Tech football team defeats West Alabama \nAnd it is noticeable. \nThere has always been a confidence around the program that they can compete and win games despite this being the third year of the program. But this is a bit different. \nYou get the feeling they can and will win no matter what is happening in the game. They have grown up. They understand what it takes to win and are working hard to get to the next level. \n“After the North Alabama game, our hearts were broken,” Englehart said. “I told the guys we are not going to win these close games at the end if we don’t win on a consistent basis in practice. You have to treat every day like Saturday.” \nIt was like a light came on. And then they went out and upset No. 5 Delta State on the road and now they see what coach was talking about. \nThings seem to be coming together, making this Panthers team very dangerous as they begin the second half of the season. \nThey now sit in third place at 2-1 in the Gulf South Conference with four conference games remaining. Can they make a playoff run? It sure looks like it but the season is far from over and lots of things can happen. \nOne thing is for sure, they now have the mindset that they can beat anyone, and that is half the battle. 21 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.flatoday.com/1LpZgNf TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:13:00.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
