Mike Quinn made a pair of tackles in the end zone here on Friday night as part of second-ranked Northbridge High’s 42-7 victory over Tantasqua, and while the Rams’ 35-point margin of victory wound up being a comfortable one, Quinn’s first safety seemed to mark a turning point in what was a close game for the first half. It came with just 28 seconds left in the second period and turned a 14-7 Northbridge lead into a two-score advantage at 16-7. “That safety really seemed to take the wind out of (Tantasqua’s) sails,” Rams coach Ken LaChapelle said. The second safety came with the game well in hand and punctuated a diverse night of point accumulation for Northbridge, which scored almost every way possible. It had the two safeties by Quinn, five PAT kicks by Geoffrey Reichert and a 36-yard field goal by Reichert, and by the way, four rushing touchdowns by Jake Wood, three in the third quarter. The Rams remained unbeaten with the victory, extending their winning streak to seven games. The Warriors fell to 5-2 and have lost two of their last three. One consolation for Tantasqua was that it snapped Northbridge’s six-game shutout streak by scoring the first opposition points of the season versus the Rams defense. They came on a big play that at the time seemed like it could be a momentum-creator. Northbridge jumped ahead, 7-0, when Koby Schofer hit Chandler Brooks for 5 yards and a touchdown —and Reichert converted — at 5:16 of the first period. Just 27 seconds later, Tantasqua quarterback Jordan Choquette connected on his 16th touchdown pass of the season, with his favorite target, J.J. Howland. The play covered 68 yards as Howland caught a strike over the middle, cut down the left sideline and outran the Rams' secondary. That made it a 7-7 game, then Wood scored on a 1-yard run late in the quarter, and Quinn came up with the key safety at the end of the half. “We took it to heart a little bit,” Wood said of the Warriors’ score, “but it’s the bigger picture we were looking at after that, winning a football game, not keeping a team scoreless every week. The reality is, that’s not gonna happen.\" Wood scored on runs of 1, 40, 5 and 36 yards as Northbridge employed its ground game more than usual. “We did what we had at the beginning, but after that safety — do we dare say we got a little conservative when you run the ball three plays and you’re in?\" LaChapelle said. “Then our defense just got hungrier and hungrier.” LaChapelle and Northbridge defensive coordinator Steve Falconer agreed that the shutout streak would end sooner or later. “It was hard to believe that in six games, somebody wouldn’t have scored just by accident,” LaChapelle said. “I feel like, a little bit in a way, that we might have been focusing on it too much,” Falconer said, “and we might have been robbing some of the younger kids of playing time towards the end because we had made it such a focus. “It’s not realistic to go to the end of the season without allowing a point, and I’ll trade those two safeties for the seven points any time.” The safeties were Northbridge’s second and third of the season, a school record, and Quinn is the first Rams defender with two in a year, let alone a game. —Contact Bill Ballou at wballou@telegram.com.
