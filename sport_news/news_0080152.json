(AP) - Authorities on Long Island are investigating after a dog reported missing more than a year ago was found abandoned outside a Hempstead veterinary clinic.\nThe poodle-mix dog named Nino was suffering from open wounds and was covered in bloody bandages when it was found on a small bed outside the entryway to the clinic on Tuesday morning.\nNassau County prosecutors say they have acquired a video depicting someone leaving the animal there. It shows two people walking past the clinic, then one of the people returns and leaves the dog near a door.\nNino was identified because of a microchip implant. The dog's owner had reported it missing from her front yard.\nThe dog is expected to be reunited with its owner after it recovers.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:56:55.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
