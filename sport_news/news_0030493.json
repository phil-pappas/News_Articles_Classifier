Here's a look the schools that have partnered with Under Armour. (Sean Welsh) Edward Lee Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun Lee Hull is pleasantly surprised to find Morgan State football tied for first place in MEAC standings. \nAfter Morgan State graduated eight starters from last season’s team that captured a share of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference title and lost five more in September due to a certification snafu, there were plenty of questions about how the team would fare in 2015. \nEven coach Lee Hull was unsure how the Bears would play. But after five weeks, they own a 3-2 overall record and are tied with Bethune-Cookman for first place in the league with identical 3-0 marks in conference play, and no one is more pleasantly surprised than Hull. \n“We’re such a young team that I didn’t know where we would be,” Hull said Tuesday morning during his weekly conference call arranged by the MEAC. “I thought that we could be here at this point, standing 3-0, but I’m just excited. The guys are getting better and better each week, and you can see their development through each game. So we’re just going to keep grinding and getting the guys ready to play and see what happens.” \nAfter opening the season with back-to-back losses at Air Force and Illinois State, Morgan State is riding a three-game winning streak. Hull said Saturday’s 42-3 thrashing of league foe Savannah State at Hughes Stadium was a building block for his team, which started 11 freshmen and sophomores. \n“You can see our confidence level as a team going up and up each game that we play,” he said. “When you have a young team and you have some success early, that’s a good thing. They build on that. Success breeds confidence.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:41:42.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
