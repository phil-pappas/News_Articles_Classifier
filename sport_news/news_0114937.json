He's been a huge member of PK throughout the last two decades and there's a lot of history in that club and he's been a massive part of it,\" Sommers said. \n\"He's come back to help us with coaching and obviously with a bit of clutch playing as well. I sure as hell won't forget that. It was a special moment to witness and it was great to be part of it.\" Ad Feedback \nGrant was originally called upon to help coach the PK pitchers but he was happy to step in and deliver on his home turf. \n\"I didn't expect to do it but when you get the opportunity you've got to step up. These guys are all good players and when you're in an environment where everyone wants to win it's sort of contagious,\" he said. \n\"I pitched a couple of weeks ago in the Masters Games and I've been staying relatively fit. I guess I've been doing it since I was five so if you're technique is fine and you're well conditioned then you can continue to do it, you just need the mental toughness.\" \nMeanwhile, the two local teams had mixed fortunes on day three of the Labour Weekend Open, with the Stoke Eagles managing to record their second win of the tournament. \nThe Eagles, who had earlier beaten local rivals United Titans on day one, managed to hold off Marlborough's Saints Aces 8-3 before going down 4-3 to the Halswell Hornets in a nailbiter. \nThe Titans ended their tournament with two more defeats, losing 11-4 to the eventual winners and 10-3 to last year's champions the Papanui Tigers. - Stuff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:09:49.742+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
