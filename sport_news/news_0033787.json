Hunter started his NBA career with a ready-to-go mantra, and the wisdom comes from one of his more famous friends, Hall of Famer Reggie Miller.\n“You have to be crafty when you’re skinny, and you have to be smarter when you’re skinny,” Hunter said of the great shooter, one of the Celtics rookie’s heroes growing up in Indianapolis. “It’s being craftier and smarter with every movement, and every movement has to be precise.”\nGood advice, considering that Hunter’s thin physique was one reason he lasted long enough in the draft for the Celtics to select him with the 28th pick last June.\nCoaches’ sons typically come into the NBA with higher basketball IQ’s than others, and by the time the Celtics took the floor for last night’s exhibition game against Brooklyn, Hunter already had made his greatest early impression with his smarts.\n“Just making the right play,” Hunter said of his early focus. “It’s not all about shooting sometimes. I’ve done a lot of other good things. Just based on the league being so good, you can make any pass you want, and I’m a good passer.\n“At this level everybody is smart, so I kind of blend in with that, and the guys I’m playing with are even smarter. These guys are talented and smart, so when I think a play is going to be there, it’s already there waiting for me.”\nHunter, in turn, has also made those quality plays for others.\n“Have I surprised myself? No. I’ve always believed in my IQ,” he said. “But the learning curve I was definitely worried about, because these guys are even more talented and smarter than I am. I still have a long ways to go IQ-wise and learning-wise, but I think I’m headed in the right direction.”\nWhatever knowledge he carries into the league after playing three years for his father Ron at Georgia State, though, the IQ factor isn’t what people first think of when seeing Hunter.\nIt’s his smooth, quick-release jump shot, of course. Hunter has a chance to become a very good shooter in the NBA, maybe even a great one.\nAnd his game-winning 3-pointer from the top of the circle against Baylor in last spring’s Elite Eight matchup will be highlighted on NCAA tournament telecasts for years.\nIt’s certainly how Miller identified Hunter in a chance encounter during last April’s Final Four.\n“He saw one shot, and that’s all he needed to see was a shooter,” Hunter said of seeing Miller as the Hall of Famer was getting on a hotel elevator. “I don’t even think he knows my name. He just saw the shot. But he knew my face, that was the coolest thing.\n“I’m from Indy, so I was like, ‘Wow, this is wild right now.’ The elevator was closing and I saw him and his back was turned. I said Reggie, ‘Can I get a picture?’ And he’s like, ‘No picture.’\n“He turned around right when it closed and saw me and recognized me from the tournament and said, ‘Oh, Shooter.’ So he opened the elevator back up and I was like, ‘Wow, this is crazy.’ After that, he sat down with me for a little bit and said to just (think) about the process. That was nuts. I couldn’t believe that.”\nBut Hunter wasn’t so cowed by his hero that he sat silent. He absorbed Miller’s advice, asked questions, and has now waded into the exhibition season with a high grade of confidence.\n“Once you get comfortable, there’s no better feeling,” Hunter said. “When I stepped into that (Olimpia) Milano game, it just felt natural. Even in practice it’s not consistent. So when I start feeling 100 percent natural, that’s when it’s going to really start.”\nAnd even if Miller recognized Hunter because of his big NCAA moment, the rookie now wants to move on to something better, like an NBA career.\n“I want to enjoy (the shot) down the road, but right now I want to be over it,” Hunter said. “I’m on a different level now. I want to hit a big shot here, in Boston. That would mean more to me.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:34:43.020+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
