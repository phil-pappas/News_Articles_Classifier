For this simulation, we used the latest roster update from SCEA and the ever-enjoyable Post Season mode. We also ensured that the Wildcard games ended as they actually did, with Houston and Chicago advancing. ALDS Texas Rangers vs. Toronto Blue Jays Cole Hamels and the rest of the Ranger's pitching staff couldn't cool off Toronto's red hot offense, as the Blue Jays win the series easily, 3 games to 1. Game 4 was a 10-1 blow-out, wth Marcus Stroman going the distance and Russel Martin collecting 2 home runs and 5 RBIs. Kansas City Royals vs. Houston Astros The Astros built an early two game lead in the series, thanks to some key hits and pitching. Scott Kazmir out dueled Johnny Cueto in Game 1, while George Springer hit three home runs combined in the first two games. The Royals answered in game three, torching Dallas Keuchel for 7 runs in only 3.1 innings. However, the Astros complete the upset in Game 4, by a 12-5 score, thanks in part to another big game from Springer. NLDS New York Mets vs Los Angeles Dodgers The Mets and Dodgers traded wins through the first four games, setting up a Game 5 showdown between Clayton Kershaw and Jon Niese. Kershaw was good, but not dominant, allowing only three hits but four runs through six innings. Niese was a touch better, going 7.2 innings, while allowing only two runs. Clippard held the Dodgers at bay in the 8th, while Familia shut the door in the 9th, giving the Mets a 4-2 win and a place in the NLCS. St. Louis Cardinals vs Chicago Cubs After the Cardinals won Games 1 and 2, the Cubs rode their pitching stars Lester and Arrieta to wins in Games 3 and 4. Arrieta in particular was impressive, throwing a complete game 4-hit shutout and setting up a dramatic Game 5. In this game, the St. Louis bats were hot but not timely, as their 11 hits only translated into 1 run. Jason Hammel went all nine, despite the hit parade, and the Cubs moved on to meet the Mets. ALCS Toronoto Blue Jays vs Houston Astros This was a tight series, as neither team scored more than 6 runs in any game, and the run differential was never more than 3. With the series tied at two games, Game 5 was an aces' duel between Keuchel and David Price. Neither were outstanding, each lasting only six innings and allowing 3 and 4 runs, respectively. Both bullpens held, but the Jays couldn't produce the tying run, ultimately losing 5-3. With the series on the line, the Astros plated 4 runs in the first inning of Game 6, which Kazmir used to produce a 6-2 win. NLCS Chicago Cubs vs New York Mets The Mets built a 3-0 series lead, thanks to their trio of young pitchers holding the Cubs to just three total runs. But it was all Cubs when Harvey, De Grom, and Syndergaard weren't on the mound. Chicago won Games 4 and 5 easily, again thanks to good starting pitching from Hammel and Arreita. But DeGrom threw a gem in Game 6, striking out 9 in a complete game shutout. World Series New York Mets vs Houston Astros Just like the NLCS, the Mets used their young guns to build a 3-0 series lead, even though every game was decided by only one run (1-0, 2-1, 3-2). In Game 4, Matt Harvey was just as dominant, but Mike Fiers was a bit better, holding the Mets scoreless through 7.1; Astros win 2-1. The magic ends for the Astros in Game 5, as Syndergaard clinches the Series with another strong performance. The New York Mets win the World Series for the first time since 1986. The MVP would go to Jacob deGrom, who was 4-0 in the Post Season with a 1.03 ERA, three complete games, one shutout, and 38 strike outs in 35 innings.
