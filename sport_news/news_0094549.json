They play at Kansas City Friday night in Game 1 of the ALCS. \nBautista’s homer capped an event-filled, 53-minute seventh inning that took a turn when Toronto catcher Russell Martin’s throw back to the pitcher deflected off batter Shin-Soo Choo and allowed the tiebreaking to score. \nThe Blue Jays filed a protest after an umpire review ruled Rougned Odor was allowed to cross home plate. Toronto fans pelted the field with debris during the 18-minute delay. \nThe Rangers started the bottom half by making three straight errors, and Toronto rallied. \nRoberto Osuna got the final five outs for his first postseason save. \nOsuna turned toward the outfield after striking out Wil Venable, looked to the sky and was mobbed by his teammates as jubilant fans cheered. \nAfter Edwin Encarnacion tied it 2-all with a second-deck drive off tough-luck loser Cole Hamels in the sixth, Odor led off the seventh with a single and went to third on a sacrifice and groundout. \nWith Choo up, Martin’s throw back to reliever Aaron Sanchez deflected off Choo and dribbled toward third base. \nHome plate umpire Dale Scott initially ruled it a dead ball but, after Rangers manager Jeff Banister questioned the call, the umpires huddled and Odor was sent home. \nFans littered the field with objects during the delay as umpires sorted out a play that is certain to rank up there with Derek Jeter’s Jeffrey Maier homer or Reggie Jackson’s hip block of a throw as one of the craziest in the postseason. \nAccording to rule Major League Baseball rule 6.03(a)(3), the batter is not to be charged with interfering with the catcher if the batter is still in the batter’s box and doesn’t make a movement to block or disrupt the throw. \nThis type of play is not subject to manager’s review but Scott, the crew chief, after discussing the ruling with Blue Jays manager John Gibbons, called an umpire’s review. After a delay of 2 minutes, 32 seconds, the play stood and fans continued to throw objects on the field. \nThe Blue Jays filed a protest. \nNo need for the paperwork, though. \nThe Rangers made three consecutive errors to start the bottom half of the inning. Bautista finished it by hittting a towering drive into the second deck, glaring at Dyson as he stood at home plate to admire his go-ahead drive, enthusiastically flipping his bat away. \nTexas opened the scoring in the first when Delino DeShields scored on a fielder’s choice by Prince Fielder. Choo homered off Marcus Stroman in the third to make it 2-0. \nChoo’s homer was the first for the Rangers since Odor connected off David Price in the seventh inning of Game 1. \nToronto cut the deficit in half in the third on Bautista’s two-out double.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:14:33.512+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
