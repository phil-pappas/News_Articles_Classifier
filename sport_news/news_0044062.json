Although Rajon Rondo isn’t the player he was before tearing up his knee, he and Darren Collison are a more-than-competent point guard tandem. The same goes for Ben McLemore and Marco Belinelli at shooting guard, and small forward Rudy Gay had one of the best seasons of his career last year in his first full season in Sacramento.\nCombine them with solid depth players such as Kosta Koufos, Omri Casspi and rookie Willie Cauley-Stein — who at least will be able to provide some defense from the get-go — and there’s little doubt the Kings have talent.\nGeorge Karl Photo: AP George Karl remains the team’s coach despite spending most of the offseason feuding with Cousins — even working at times to get him traded. Those attempts eventually bled into the public eye and forced upper management, led by Vlade Divac, to try to patch things up.\nThough Karl has issues when it comes to the postseason, the man knows how to win games. The last 20 times Karl has coached at least half of an NBA season, he’s won at least 50 percent of his games — and has won 60 percent of his games in 13 of the 20.\nThe Kings have a roster capable of playing Karl’s preferred style. Sacramento can play small with Gay or Casspi at power forward next to Cousins, and can roll out multiple three-guard lineups with some combination of Rondo, Collison, McLemore and Belinelli.\nThe top seven spots in the Western Conference playoff race are virtual locks: the Warriors, Spurs, Rockets, Clippers, Thunder, Grizzlies and Pelicans in some order, barring significant injury issues.\nBut the eighth spot is very much up for grabs. The Lakers are still awful, and the Timberwolves are too reliant on their young talent. The Mavericks appear headed for the lottery — possibly a very high pick — with half their roster injured. The Trail Blazers, after winning the Northwest Division, will plummet to the bottom of the conference after losing four-fifths of their starting lineup. The Suns and Jazz will be in the running, but have issues: Jeff Hornacek’s expiring contract and the tumult surrounding power forward Markieff Morris in Phoenix, the lack of a point guard in Utah.\nYou can make as strong a case for the Kings snatching that eighth spot as you can any of those other teams, none of which has a player better than Cousins or the depth Sacramento has developed across its roster.\nWere the Kings smart in how they tried to retool this summer? No, and that could be problematic in the future. But for a franchise trying to build momentum as it prepares to move into a new downtown arena next summer, those moves could provide them with the playoff berth they’re desperate to achieve.\n  demarcus cousins ,  george karl ,  nba ,  nik stauskas ,  rudy gay ,  sacramento kings ,  willie cauley-stein", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:45:22.105+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
