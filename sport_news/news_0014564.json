LOS ANGELES – You could almost hear the individual shouts and primal whoops coming from the pitcher’s mound, where the Mets collided into one another.\nIn front of a dead-cold, silent Dodger Stadium, it was the start of a party for the ages, the kind that wouldn’t end for hours. And who could blame the Mets for going into an altered state?\nThey’re now one step closer to the winning the pennant after a thrilling 3-2 win over L.A. in Game 5 of the NL Division Series. For that, they can thank Jacob deGrom, who gutted out six difficult innings without his best fastball, and Daniel Murphy, who was 3-for-4 and smoked the game-winning home run off Zack Greinke in the sixth inning.\nDeGrom left with a one-run lead, giving way to Noah Syndergaard and Jeurys Familia, who combined to shut down the Dodgers over the last three innings: no runs, no hits, no hope. The final out – Familia’s strikeout of Howie Kendrick — added another chapter to this surreal season, and set up the dream matchup with the Cubs in the NL Championship Series.\nOne series down, two to go.\n“It’s an unbelievable feeling to have these guys play the way they did,” Terry Collins said afterward. “When you go in a five-game series and get [Clayton] Kershaw and Greinke four times and you win, you better be proud of yourself. Because that’s a tremendous accomplishment to pull that off.”\nSo it starts anew on Saturday – Game 1 will be at Citi Field, and the Mets will have the home-field advantage. But no matter what happens from this point on, Murphy becomes a cult hero in Flushing, and not just for delivering the key hit against Greinke.\nHe literally stole a run in the fourth inning, taking third after Lucas Duda was drawing a walk, taking advantage of the Dodgers’ shift that left third base unattended. Murphy scored moments later on Travis D’Arnaud’s sacrifice fly, tying the game.\nThat was Murphy: heady, quick-thinking and dangerous throughout the series. He batted .333 (7-for-21) with three home runs and five RBI, and leaves the Mets in a difficult spot this winter.\nWith free agency looming, the Mets will probably let Murphy walk. They have younger players on the horizon and will want to use his money elsewhere, maybe to convince Yoenis Cespedes to put down roots in Flushing. But it’s possible Murphy has changed ownership’s thinking. Maybe everything changes after a thunderous performance over the last five games.\nPut it this way: When the Mets needed him most, in Game 5, Murphy succeeded where Cespedes (0-for-4, three strikeouts), David Wright (0-for-4, two strikeouts) and Lucas Duda (0-for-3, two strikeouts) could not.\nEach of them had been smothered by Greinke, which makes deGrom’s performance that much more impressive. The right-hander proved why he’s the ace, and represents the Mets’ best chance to get to the World Series. Somehow, no matter how close he came to being knocked out, deGrom survived.\n“DeGrom pitched really good,” said Don Mattingly. “When he needed those outs it seemed like he was able to run the fastball up there to get us going, and then he was able to use the change to finish us off.”\nAs a result, the Dodgers were bounced from the playoffs for the third straight year, which almost certainly will cost Mattingly his job. Yet, the former Yankee, classy to the end, emerged from the Dodgers dugout to seek out Collins and shake his hand.\nThe game started with what looked like pure chaos for deGrom and Greinke – neither looked sharp. What was billed as a pitchers’ duel had a chance to dissolve into a run-scoring orgy.\nImpossible as it was to believe, the Mets broke through on Greinke immediately, scoring a run in the first inning. Curtis Granderson beat out an infield hit and then scored all the way from first on Murphy’s double into the gap in left-center.\nThe sold-out crowd was too stunned too react: The only noise in the ballpark came from the pockets of Mets fans who were lucky enough to score tickets. But they, too, must’ve felt like they’d woken up in an alternate universe. Greinke, the NL’s ERA champion, struggling to get out of the first inning?\nThe Dodgers created the same panic in the Mets’ dugout, pounding deGrom for two runs in the bottom half of the inning. All the weapons that the right-hander had at his disposal in Game 1 were gone – the fastball was off by a tick, forcing deGrom to over-accelerate his arm, which in turn cost him command of the strike zone.\nThe Dodgers picked up on deGrom’s deficiency right away, launching four straight singles, all hit hard, which wiped out the Mets’ lead. Suddenly L.A. was ahead, 2-1, and deGrom was staring at a full-blown crisis.\nHere he was, pitching in the biggest game of his life, at less than 100 percent. DeGrom almost reached his breaking point in the second inning, having walked Joc Pederson, who was bunted over by Greinke and stayed put after Wilmer Flores’ throwing error allowed Kendrick to reach base.\nSo, runners on first and second, one out, the heart of the Dodgers’ lineup ready for the kill. Collins fidgeted in the dugout, trying his best to keep his anxiety hidden from the players. He, too, was at a crossroads, no doubt tempted to think about removing deGrom and going to Plan B.\nBut Collins never left the dugout, never came to the mound to talk to deGrom, never even called down to the bullpen. No one was told to start warming up. It was the ultimate vote of confidence in deGrom: The rally, the inning, the game itself, the defining moment in the Mets’ season, was his and only his.\nSomehow, deGrom finished with 15 swings and misses, despite losing 2 to 3 mph off that Game 1 fastball. He never really found that killer velocity, but Mattingly was right: deGrom simply was tougher than Greinke, just as the Mets themselves found a way to win.\nThe NLCS is next. It should be a whopper of a series to decide who goes to the Fall Classic, but there’s no disputing this much: Thanks to deGrom, Murphy and an airtight bullpen, the Mets have gotten this far the old-fashioned way.\nThey flat-out earned it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:07:09.012+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
