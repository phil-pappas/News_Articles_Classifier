Rutgers managed the bulk of a 25-point comeback win against Indiana without him. \n\"Leonte is obviously a key factor in the game. He is our best player,\" quarterback Chris Laviano said. \"But at the end of the game, in the fourth quarter, we've got to do what we've got to do with whoever we've got on the field.\" \nIt likely will take a lot to keep Carroo on the sideline, as he tried to force his way back in against Indiana. \n\"I'll definitely be playing next week,\" he said after the game. \nUPDATE: Leonte Carroo did not practice Tuesday. \"We don't know that yet,\" coach Kyle Flood said Tuesday on the weekly Big Ten coaches teleconference when asked about Carroo's game availability. \"We'll have an update a little later in the week. He didn't practice today.\" \nGrant was a big part of the passing attack when Carroo was suspended for two games earlier this season. When Carroo went to the sideline against Indiana, offensive coordinator Ben McDaniels began incorporating more wide receiver screens to Grant into the play-calling. \nCoach Kyle Flood said he will know more about the availability of Carroo and Grant for the 8 p.m. Saturday game as the week progresses. A third wide receiver, John Tsimis, is out with a lower body injury. \n\"Everybody at every position had better be ready every week because you're only one play away from being in the game,\" said Flood, whose team is listed as a 20-point underdog. \n\"We saw that with Carlton (Agudosi). A guy like Vance Matthews, a guy like Jawuan Harris, we have some guys that have been practicing and practicing well who have not had a lot of opportunities yet and those opportunities could be coming quick.\" \nThe same can be said within the secondary, the unit that seems to be more cursed than any other in the program going back over the last three seasons. \nJacobs and Austin are the latest hits for Rutgers, which dismissed a total of five defensive backs during the offseason and training camp. \nJacobs missed two games with injury earlier in the season and only briefly played against Indiana, while Austin took a knee to the head from teammate Steve Longa during the game. Strong safety Kiy Hester also left the Indiana game injured but is not listed on the injury report. What is the biggest deficit ever overcome by Rutgers? Not 25 \nTrue freshman Jarius Adams replaced Austin and quickly allowed a 38-yard touchdown pass, though he recovered as the rest of the defense improved in the fourth quarter. \n\"He's a guy that unfortunately missed a little bit of time this year or he would have a little bit more experience than he does right now,\" Flood said, \"but we've got confidence in him as well. And I think next week he'll be a better player than he was last week, just like a lot of young guys.\" \nAustin still is listed as the starter opposite Isaiah Wharton, with Adams, Brian Verbitski and Ronnie James as the next wave of cornerbacks. \n\"Those are guys you could definitely see in the game,\" Flood said, \"and all those decisions get made through the game-planning process, deciding what personnel groups we think they are going to use, what personnel groups we want to use to match up.\" \nRutgers could ask free safety Anthony Cioffi to return to his roots as a cornerback and turn to true freshman safety Najee Clayton, who was a late arrival during training camp. Because he has not played in a game yet, Clayton could redshirt. \n\"I think Najee is getting close,\" Flood said. \"Najee is a guy that I think at some point this season, we're going to see him on the field and see him play. Andre Hunt is another guy who plays in that spot. I think those would probably be the next two places we would go, but we won't know more about that until a bit later in the week. \nLonga, who has a team-high 66 tackles and is coming off a career-best 16-tackle performance, is probable (lower body) but the bigger concern at linebacker is in the middle with Lewis (upper body). The South Carolina transfer is tied for third on the team with 31 tackles. \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com 29 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1RRZNsg TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T05:18:27.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
