A penalty is a crucial moment in the game with the result 1-1. \n\"I repeat, if the FA want to punish me, they can punish me, they don't punish other managers, they punish me - it's not a problem for me. \n\"But I want to repeat because I think my players deserve it, I think our fans deserve it and I am a Chelsea fan too. I want to say it again: referees are afraid to give decisions for Chelsea.\" \nMourinho's suspended stadium ban will be immediately invoked should he be found by an independent regulatory commission to have committed a further breach of FA Rule E3 for any comment or statement to or through the media before 13 October 2016.
