This was stated by Anurag Thakur, Member of Parliament-cum-BCCI Secretary, while addressing a press conference here today. He said there was nothing to say against the Modi-led BJP government in the Centre in the past 18 months, but political rivals had started using media to malign the image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi on petty issues. He said it was sad that price hike of cereals was being projected as failure of the government, but the media did not publicise the achievements of the Central government. Condemning the attack by Shiv Sena workers at the BCCI office in Mumbai, Anurag said it was unfortunate that workersâ€™ political parties turned hooligans. They should have instead protested in a democratic way. He said talks with the Pakistan Cricket Board would continue, but the cricket match to be played between the two countries depended on the governments of the respective countries and the BCCI could hardly do anything in it. He said the election of the Bihar Assembly was important for the BJP. He said it was only the BJP that could give stable and better governance to the people of Bihar as it had proved in the Centre too. Earlier, Anurag Thakur inaugurated a faculty house complex at National Institute of Technology (NIT) built at a cost of Rs four crore. He also addressed to the grievances of NIT staff and assured early remedy to them. Anurag addressed a public meeting at Sarakar village and inaugurated development works completed by spending the MP local area development fund. MP Rajya Sabha Bimla Kashyap, MLA Narender Thakur and district BJP president Anil Thakur were also present on the occasion.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:15:39.314+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
