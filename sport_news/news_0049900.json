They've witnessed his lowest moment of the year, a Sunday Night Baseball massacre in Baltimore, when he gave up four home runs and eight runs in 6.1 innings. But, they also saw him throttle the Astros in Game 5 of the ALDS last week. Cueto held Houston to just 2 hits and two runs over eight innings. He set down the last 19 men he faced, the longest perfect playoff stretch since Don Larson's perfect game in the 1956 World Series. \nWhich Johnny Cueto will Royals fans see Monday night? Unfortunately, it was the \"bod\" Johnny and it set a record for the Royals. \nHe carried a 3.86 ERA through two postseason appearances. \nThat number will go up, however, as the Blue Jays battered Cueto with eight runs through the first three innings. The big blow, a 3-run homer from Troy Tulowitzki. He left the game in the 3rd, trailing 7-2, having given up six hits and four walks with two strike outs. \nThe Jays added a 2-run bomb by Josh Donaldson, and led Kansas City 9-2 through three innings. Kris Medlen gave up that home run. \nThe Royals rallied for two runs in the top of the 6th, to trail 9-4, only to see the Blue Jays hammer another homer in the bottom of the 5th, to lead it 10-4. \nCueto did get run support in the first inning. Alcides Escobar got a lead off triple and Ben Zobrist's ground out scored him. \nIn the second, a walk and a hit had two on and Ryan Goins' double scored two including a spectacular slide at the plate for Kevin Pillar. Josh Donaldson kept the hits going to give Blue Jays 3-1 lead. \nBut Kansas City answered with an RBI from Eric Hosmer, His fielder's choice scored Zobrist.That made it 3-2, Toronto in the middle of the 3rd. \nMarcus Stroman is pitching for the Blue Jays, he's already given up six hits. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
