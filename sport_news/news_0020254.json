He pleaded not guilty. A 10-day trial is scheduled for Nov. 30 at 9 a.m.\nHannon is also facing two counts of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, first-degree kidnapping, second-degree kidnapping, unlawful sexual contact and another charge alleging sexual assault. He pleaded not guilty and will stand trial for 10 days on Feb. 22, 2016 at 9 a.m.\nAdvertisement According to information from the District Attorney's Office, McCaffrey-Pickett pleaded guilty to first-degree assault with a deadly weapon — she appears again in court Friday. Before her plea, McCaffrey-Pickett was facing first-degree murder, second-degree kidnapping and conspiracy to commit murder, all felony charges.\nRosario pleaded guilty to second-degree murder, according to the District Attorney's Office. He originally faced two counts of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder, first-degree kidnapping and second-degree kidnapping. He will appear in court Jan. 20, 2016.\nThe last suspect in the case, Guinn, also pleaded guilty. She will appear in court again Dec. 18 on a first-degree kidnapping charge. She, too, originally faced charges of two counts of first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit murder in the first degree, first-degree kidnapping and second-degree kidnapping before the plea.\nThe details of the homicide case were made public for the first time in an April preliminary hearing regarding Bensen's charges . It was reported there that Bartmess' autopsy determined she had died from hypothermia, multiple blunt force trauma to her head and a laceration to her neck\nProsecutors laid out evidence alleging the five co-defendants conspired to kidnap, beat and kill Bartmess in early October 2014 — they said Bensen admitted to \"finishing the job\" when he drove her out on Red Feather Lakes Road about 9.5 miles west of U.S. 287 to kill her and dump her body.\nWhile Bartmess was last known to be living in Fort Collins, her mother Wilma Cotten said she had spent some time in Loveland prior. Bartmess had lived with her in Aurora until Easter 2014.\n\"Andrea was a very energetic, outgoing, fun-loving kid who wanted everyone to like her,\" Cotten said in November 2014. \"But she had a dark side; she suffered with bipolar (disorder). We struggled to find the right combination of therapy and medications for her.\"\nDana Rieck: 970-635-3630, rieckd@reporter-herald.com or twitter.com/DanaRieckRH", "external_links": ["http://www.reporterherald.com/news/larimer-county/ci_27832174/judge-finds-probable-cause-homicide-case", "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/larimer-county/ci_27054011/5th-arrest-made-bartmess-murder", "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/ci_27004637/bartmess-death-ruled-homicide", "http://www.reporterherald.com/news/loveland-local-news/ci_28024159/homicide-co-defendants-will-face-capital-charges", "http://twitter.com/DanaRieckRH"], "published": "2015-10-19T13:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T19:37:09.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
