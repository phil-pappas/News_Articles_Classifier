Pakistan resume day two of the first Test against England at Zayed Cricket Stadium on Wednesday on 286-4 with Shoaib Malik unbeaten on 124. Day 1 report Malik hit a brilliant century to cap an impressive return to Test cricket after five years as he led Pakistan's charge in the first Test against England in Abu Dhabi on Tuesday. Malik was unbeaten on 124 for his third Test hundred - his first against England - to guide Pakistan to 286-4 at close on the opening day at Zayed Cricket Stadium. Malik shared in a 168-run stand for the second wicket with opener Mohammad Hafeez who missed his century by two runs after Pakistan won the toss and opted to bat on a flat pitch. Malik has so far hit 14 boundaries in his patient 230-ball knock. It was also memorable day for veteran batsman Younis Khan (38) who became Pakistan's leading run scorer in Test cricket when he passed Javed Miandad's tally of 8,832 runs made in 124 Tests. Younis, playing his 102nd Test, jumped out of his crease to hit spinner Moeen Ali for a big six at deep mid-wicket to reach 21, two more than his illustrious countryman Miandad. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:19:18.402+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
