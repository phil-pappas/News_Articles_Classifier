What an incredible career,” Anderson said of the Giants’ Hudson, who walked off the mound for a final time Thursday with 222 wins, a 3.49 ERA and 2,080 strikeouts.\n“I was lucky to get a hit off him.” The Dodgers (89-70), who have clinched the National League West title, finish the regular season at home with three games against the San Diego Padres.\nThe Mets (89-70), champions of the NL East, wrap at home with three against the Washington Nationals. The team with the better record will secure home-field advantage in the best-of-five playoff series between the two teams that begins next Friday.\nMaking his 479th start, Hudson (8-9) allowed three runs, three hits and two walks as the Dodgers knocked him out of the game early, lasting just 2-1/3 innings.\n“I’ve had a lot of fun over the last 17 years,” said the 40-year-old Hudson, who left to a standing ovation and was greeted outside the dugout by a long line of teammates led by Madison Bumgarner.\n“I feel very lucky to have played as long as I have (and) I’m fortunate to have played on some great teams with great teammates. “I’m very proud of the career that I’ve had.”\nCubs 5, Reds 3\nAustin Jackson homered while Jason Hammel pitched five shutout innings to lift the Chicago Cubs to a 5-3 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.

First baseman Darin Ruf and third baseman Andres Blanco homered for the Phillies.\nEickhoff, facing a lineup of Mets reserves, went seven innings and allowed four hits as he struck out 10 and walked one. In other games it was: Nationals 3, Braves 0; Padres 3, Brewers 1; Diamondbacks 8, Rockies 6.\nAmerican League Orioles 6, Blue Jays 4\nManny Machado homered twice and stole two bases as the Baltimore Orioles outlasted a rain delay of almost 3-1/2 hours to beat the Toronto Blue Jays.\nThe start time was also brought forward because of concerns about the impending Hurricane Joaquin that is starting to affect the East Coast.\nMachado hit a two-run homer in the first inning and added a solo shot in the sixth, finishing 3-for-4 with three RBIs.\nYankees 4, Red Sox 1\nRight fielder Carlos Beltran, first baseman Greg Bird and second baseman Rob Refsnyder hit solo home runs while CC Sabathia pitched five innings as the New York Yankees clinched a post-season berth with a 4-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox.\nThe Yankees (87-72) clinched their first post-season berth since 2012.
