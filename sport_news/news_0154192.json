(Jared Wickerham/AFP) Ex-NFLer Stevens, Hope Soloâ€™s husband, jailed for drunk driving \nU.S. women's soccer goalie Hope Solo will again face domestic violence charges after a ruling by the Washington state appeals court overturned a lower court's decision to dismiss the case. \nSolo was originally charged with two counts of fourth-degree domestic violence, stemming from the alleged beating of her half-sister and nephew in June 2014. \nShortly before the case went to trial, it was dismissed on procedural grounds. Prosecutors immediately filed an appeal and it was granted on Friday. \nSolo will appeal the latest development, according to her attorney, Todd Maybrown. \n\"We are shocked and disappointed by the judge's ruling this morning,\" Maybrown said in a statement. \"However, we maintain our position that the charges in this case should have never been filed, that the original trial court's dismissal of the case was correct, and we plan to file an appeal of today's decision with the Court of Appeals.\" \nSolo is one of the faces of the team that won the Women's World Cup.
