After dropping a pair of games to begin the preseason, the Carolina Hurricanes won four straight to end their six-game exhibition slate. Tonight, it was a 2-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Penguins. \nJust over a week ago, the Penguins thumped the Hurricanes 7-3 in a game that crammed all 10 goals into the first 40 minutes. Tonight was a much more measured, controlled affair, with the Hurricanes nursing a 1-0 lead heading into the third period. \nJordan Staal opened the scoring with just 30 seconds remaining in the first period, spinning out from behind the goal line, throwing the puck to the net and surprising Marc-Andre Fleury. \nChris Terry scored what was ultimately the game-winning goal three minutes into the third period, streaking down the far wing and picking the far corner to make it a 2-0 game. \nPittsburgh would get one back when Pascal Dupuis deposited a rebound past Cam Ward. \nSpeaking of Ward, he was brilliant in his 60-minute body of work tonight. He made 34 saves on 35 shots. With the Canes ahead 1-0 in the second period, Evgeni Malkin burst into the zone with speed, blowing past a stick check from James Wisniewski. Ward sprawled out and flashed the pad, turning away two shots from Malkin to preserve the Canes’ one-goal advantage. \nThe Hurricanes surrendered two power-play goals to the Penguins when the two teams met last week. Tonight was a much different story, as the Canes were a perfect 4-for-4 on the man disadvantage opposite a very dangerous Penguins five-man unit. \nThe Hurricanes thought they had a 1-0 lead when Andrej Nestrasil centered the puck and it bounced in off Joakim Nordstrom. The official immediately waved it off, though there wasn’t much in the way of an explanation. \nTwo weeks after skating onto the ice for beginning of training camp, the Hurricanes conclude the preseason with a 4-2-0 record and skate into the beginning of the regular season with a four-game winning streak. It starts for real on Oct. 8, but this was a mighty fine start. \nCopyright 2015 Carolina Hurricanes. All rights reserved.
