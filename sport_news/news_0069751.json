But he paid the price for his actions, missing out on the 1972 Olympics, and was erased from popular memory, even in his home country.\nWhen San Jose State University erected a statue to commemorate the defining moment, Norman’s podium was left empty.\nOn Friday, arts magazine Griot posted a piece about the Australian by Riccardo Gazzaniga on Facebook, called “The white man in that photo” and it has now had almost 30,000 shares. Gazzaniga echoed the thoughts of the world when he learned Norman’s story, saying he had previously thought him “a random presence, an extra.”\nTHE WHITE MAN IN THAT PHOTOSometimes photographs deceive.Take this one, for example. It represents John Carlos and...\nPosted by GRIOT on Thursday, 8 October 2015 “I even thought that that guy — who seemed to be just a simpering Englishman — represented, in his icy immobility, the will to resist the change that Smith and Carlos were invoking in their silent protest,” wrote Gazzaniga. “But I was wrong.”\nThanks to a two-year-old article he saw in an Italian newspaper, Gazzaniga realised Norman was the third hero at this turning point for civil rights. Coming in just behind world record-breaking Smith at 20.06, he set an Australian record that still stands today.\nAt the time, the White Australia policy was in effect, there were restrictions on non-white immigration and Aboriginal children were facing forced adoption by white families. But when the two Americans asked Norman if he believed in God and human rights, he didn’t hesitate.\n“We knew that what we were going to do was far greater than any athletic feat,” said Carlos at Norman’s funeral in 2006 , where he and Smith carried the coffin. “He said, ‘I’ll stand with you.’”\nSo Carlos and Smith stood barefoot, to represent the poverty that afflicted so many African Americans. Each bowed their head and a raised a fist in the air in a symbol of Black Power, wearing one glove each at Norman’s suggestion.\nThe Australian stood proudly beside them, wearing an Olympic Project for Human Rights badge. Carlos said he expected to see fear in Norman’s eyes but instead, “I saw love. Peter never flinched. He never turned his eyes, he never turned his head.”\nSmith famously said in Mexico City: “If I win, I am American, not a black American. But if I did something bad, then they would say I am a Negro.”\nAfter their bold statement, the duo were withdrawn from the relays, expelled from the Olympic Village and shunned by their country. They struggled to find employment and received death threats, and Carlos’ home was attacked.\nNorman, a former Melbourne teacher, was punished, but allowed to stay in Mexico for the rest of the Olympics. However, in 1972, he was overlooked for the Munich Olympics by the Australian selectors, despite meeting the qualification standards.\nIn 2012, Parliament finally made an official apology for his exclusion. Liberal MP John Alexander said “the further embarrassment” was that Norman was not formally recognised at the Sydney Olympics in 2000.\nSmith and Carlos were pallbearers at Norman’s funeral in Melbourne. Source: News Limited\nWhen Carlos heard talk of an apology to their friend in 2012, he said: “There’s no-one in the nation of Australia that should be honoured, recognised, appreciated more than Peter Norman for his humanitarian concerns, his character, his strength and his willingness to be a sacrificial lamb for justice.”\nSince the post went viral, Norman’s nephew, Matt, has re-released Salute, the documentary he made about his uncle, which brought the story to a new audience in Australia and overseas seven years ago. He told news.com.au: “I’ve had a lot of emails, from normal people saying how amazed they were. It’s pushed me to move forward on 1968 , the big budget drama version of the story. Peter stood up for what he believed in, for the human race, not the Olympic race.\n“I’ve always wanted something to represent Peter, not only for the support he showed those two but for his sporting achievements.\n“Peter was always overlooked. He missed out on the opportunity to be thanked. I made that film to honour him and show him people do care. He always said, when you’re at an Olympic Games and you win a medal, you own that spot you’re standing on to do what you want.”\nIn the 2008 film, Norman says: “I couldn’t see why a black man couldn’t drink the same water from a water fountain, take the same bus or go to the same school as a white man. There was a social injustice that I couldn’t do anything about from where I was, but I certainly hated it.\n“It has been said that sharing my silver medal with that incident on the victory dais detracted from my performance. On the contrary. I have to confess, I was rather proud to be part of it.”\nNow, a simple Facebook post has opened the eyes of the world to a modern-day Ned Kelly, giving him some of the recognition he deserved but never saw in his lifetime.\nThe three former sprinters remained close. Source: Supplied\nWhile most reaction has been positive, Gazzaniga wrote a statement on Tuesday answering readers’ criticism: “Some of them said I’m tryin’ to ‘whitewash’ the story. No, they’re wrong, this wasn’t absolutely my intention.\n“Norman found himself in this historical moment and in just few seconds he made a choice.\n“If you listen to Carlos and Smith public speeches I think you can clearly understand that the real struggle started after that race and that night. And you can listen to how grateful they are to this man. Tommie Smith and John Carlos made an enormous thing, they changed the story and finally the whole world recognised their role.\n“Norman decided in just one moment, and his decision changed and, in some way, destroyed his life. This is not a competition between Smith, Carlos and Norman. They ran one against other only in that night of 1968, after they always ran together. This story is so powerful and has been so shared not because I’m so good as a writer, but because it deeply touches a lot of hearts. Because it is a story of sport and courage, friendship and loyalty.”\nIt certainly seems to have resonated overseas and at home. As Carlos said when Norman died aged 64: “Go and tell your kids the story of Peter Norman.”\nIt appears the world is doing just that.\nThe Team That Never Played 54:11 What part did football really play in South Africa during Apartheid?\nMarch 12th 2015 7 months ago /video/video.news.com.au/TV/Documentary/ ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/e9ccce763524b9f9753c4feb92aa82b6", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/external?url=http%3A%2F%2Fvideomam.news.com.au.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fgenerated%2Fprod%2F05%2F06%2F2015%2F38026%2Fimage1024x768.jpg%3Fcount%3D1&width=650&api_key=kq7wnrk4eun47vz9c5xuj3mc", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "https://www.facebook.com/GriotMagWorld", "https://www.facebook.com/GriotMagWorld/posts/180385798962583:0", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/f1c61f3451fe2a1c9a1336128688471e", "http://griotmag.com/en/white-man-in-that-photo/", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/864e2384ee086ccf92b66de6d1af3315", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-16T20:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:50:38.353+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
