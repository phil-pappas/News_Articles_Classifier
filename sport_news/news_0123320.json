According to sources, Amarinder spent about an hour with Rahul and held detailed discussions with the leader over the Congress’ strategy in taking on the Akalis in Punjab as well party’s restructuring in the state. Amarinder has been seeking the ouster of PCC chief Pratap Singh Bajwa for long now. He is also demanding the party’s revamp in order to take on the Akali-BJP combine in Punjab in the Assembly poll slated in early 2017. What transpired during the meeting was not known as Amarinder did not talk to media after meeting Rahul at his Tughlaq Road residence, but sources say that the core issue of discussion was about resolving the leadership row in the state. The Congress has lost twice in Punjab under the former Chief Minister’s leadership. Recently, Amarinder has held lengthy discussions with Congress chief Sonia Gandhi and her deputy Rahul at least twice. He is reportedly “unhappy” with the party’s plans of resolving the leadership row in the state. Rahul has initiated fresh discussions with party MLAs, senior leaders and other elected representatives too in a bid to resolve the issues in its state unit. Senior leaders in Punjab have gone public against each other leading to embarrassment for the party. The Congress high command had earlier zeroed in on senior leader Ambika Soni to head the party’s Punjab unit replacing incumbent Bajwa, but Singh is not happy with the arrangement, the sources say. The party high command has chalked out a plan of restructuring its Punjab unit, giving a role to all its leaders and intends to come out with a “consensus” all-new PCC. Rahul has also stressed on the importance of unity in the party’s state unit, especially after the war of words between its top leaders, to all leaders meeting him on party restructuring. The Congress, which wants to do a balancing act through the reshuffle, has been taking its time to meet senior leaders of all sections. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T22:46:06.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
