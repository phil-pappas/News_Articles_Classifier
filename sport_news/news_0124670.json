She then led them to where Phoebe was stuck, perched atop concrete rubble that held her out of the water of the cistern.\nInslee will presented Tillie with the Washingtonian of the Day award for her bravery and loyalty.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:46:18.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
