Spiller to establish Flex value, it’s now, after last week’s 80-yard game-winner. Mark Ingram will continue to dominate early-down touches, remaining on the RB1/2 borderline. DeMarco Murray may want the ball more, but his 1.6 YPC average suggests the opposite may be necessary for the touchdown-dependent RB2. Continue to fire up target-monster Jordan Matthews as a WR2. \nChicago @ Kansas City: A top DFS play, Jamaal Charles should have his way against Chicago’s leaky defense. KC’s passing offense runs through Jeremy Maclin ... at the expense of talented but mid-range TE1 Travis Kelce. Chicago’s top receiver Alshon Jeffery is likely to eased in as a WR2, opening up space for top-flight RB Matt Forte versus this tough defense. Continue to start high-end TE1 Martellus Bennett. \nSeattle @ Cincinnati: Marshawn Lynch projects to be a game-time decision, creating workload questions. Thomas Rawls should be rostered in all leagues as a handcuff. Jimmy Graham’s role is disappointing for all fantasy investors, an uninspiring TE1. It’s a tough matchup for A.J. Green, but he remains a WR1. It’s hard to imagine touchdown-dependent Jeremy Hill and scatback Giovani Bernard carving out much more than Flex value. \nWashington @ Atlanta: Jordan Reed’s absence leaves Washington low on pass-catchers behind WR2 Pierre Garcon. DeSean Jackson appears a week away. Both Alfred Morris and Matt Jones should have room to run as RB2s in Atlanta. Keep riding Julio Jones as an elite WR1 after last week’s inevitable slowdown. Devonta Freeman is now the Falcons’ bellcow and a legitimate RB1 in a high-octane offense. \nJacksonville @ Tampa Bay: Mike Evans (25 targets the past two weeks) remains a WR2 until Jameis Winston gets his feet wet. Doug Martin has a nice matchup as a low-end RB2. Allen Robinson could carve out great DFS value as Blake Bortles’ alpha receiver, with WR2 price and WR1 upside. T.J. Yeldon’s high-volume role equates to RB1/2 value in a game featuring two poor defenses. \nCleveland @ Baltimore: Justin Forsett’s role in Baltimore’s was cemented after Steve Smith and Michael Campanaro’s injuries. Cleveland is ranked 27th against the run. An ugly win last Thursday against Pittsburgh should inspire a Ravens defense to play to its ability. Duke Johnson is a decent flex play, however, and Gary Barnidge is a solid option for TE streamers. \nBuffalo @ Tennessee: Buffalo is thin with running backs LeSean McCoy and Karlos Williams ailing. Boobie Dixon would be a volume RB2 if both were unable to suit up. Charles Clay is the only startable pass catcher with Sammy Watkins injured. Mid-range TE1 Delanie Walker and WR2/3 Kendall Wright have minimal value against the Bills’ stingy defense. \nSt. Louis @ Green Bay: Todd Gurley’s 146-yard breakout offers optimism going forward, but Green Bay’s disciplined defense caps him as an RB2. Low-end WR3 Tavon Austin won’t repeat last week’s two-TD performance. Every-week RB1 Eddie Lacy will earn everything he gets against St. Louis’ defensive line. Randall Cobb is a top-five WR1, and resurgent James Jones has WR2 value as Aaron Rodgers’ favorites. Richard Rodgers has solid TE2 value. \nSunday, 4:05-4:25 p.m. \nArizona @ Detroit: Things get easier for Carson Palmer and Co. after last week’s loss. Consisten Larry Fitzgerald is a WR1. Andre Ellington is likely to return with Flex value, but Chris Johnson is still an RB2. Detroit’s offense is underperforming. Declining Calvin Johnson is just a low-end WR1, while talented options Golden Tate and Ameer Abdullah are shaky Flex plays. \nDenver @ Oakland: Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders are great WR1 options as Peyton Manning gets his feet under him. C.J. Anderson and Ronnie Hillman cap each other’s value as game-flow dependent RB3s. WR2 Amari Cooper is the alpha WR, but Denver will take him away. Banged-up Latavius Murray is only an RB2 as Oakland is likely to play from behind. \nNew England @ Dallas: The obvious TE1 overall, Rob Gronkowski remains a value in DFS. Julian Edelman and Dion Lewis are also must-starts as New England should score at least 30. Dallas will likely play from behind, but Joseph Randle carries decent RB2 status. Jason Witten is the best receiving option with low-end WR3 Terrance Williams expected to tangle with Malcolm Butler. \nSunday, 8:30 p.m. \nSan Francisco @ New York Giants: WR1 Odell Beckham could explose against talent-deficient San Francisco, but the Giants aren’t getting him the ball enough. Rashad Jennings and Shane Vereen are just Flex plays in a limiting timeshare. Carlos Hyde has RB2 value as offensive focal point. Colin Kaepernick’s continued regression makes starting any 49er pass-catcher a leap of faith. \nMonday, 8:30 p.m. \nPittsburgh @ San Diego: Le’Veon Bell has re-emerged as the NFL’s top all-purpose RB, and Pittsburgh will rely on him even more until Ben Roethlisberger returns. Michael Vick’s presence takes the upside away from WR1 Antonio Brown. Martavis Bryant is a solid dart throw as a WR3 in his return from suspension against a banged up secondary. Danny Woodhead and Melvin Gordon are great RB2s in an equal opportunity attack, with sneaky WR1/2 Keenan Allen a Philip Rivers favorite. \nFantasy Rundown writer Will Homonnay is a junior at North Andover High.
