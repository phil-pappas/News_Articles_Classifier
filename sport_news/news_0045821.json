How do you figure that? As Rudy Tomjanovich might say: Never underestimate the heart of a former Bettor’s Guide champion.\nHaving carefully analyzed the Week 4 card, Mr. Aitch is confident he won’t have to stage another comeback in Week 5. And Bob’s your uncle, as they say across the pond.\nJets over Dolphins: Which brings us to the Roger Goodell 9:30 full-English-breakfast game. Not to be cheeky, but Hondo will be gobsmacked if Gang Green’s defense doesn’t bloody well knock the Dolphins on their sorry bums. The only issue could be if the Jets get lagered up Saturday night and are too knackered to perform. Cheers!\nMarshawn Lynch’s mom, Delisa, named Brandon Marshall her Dumb-Azz Player of the Week.\nGiants over Bills: The price seems steep for a team likely without LeSean McCoy (hamstring) and Sammy Watkins (calf). In fact, the only Bill operating at full strength is Rex Ryan (mouth).\nThe worst part about Victor Cruz not playing this week is viewers won’t be treated to watching Tom Coughlin salsa dancing, which he had promised to do if Cruz scored.\nColts over Jaguars: Brye Anne Russillo, an MMA fighter, complained that her F-cups have caused her to go up in weight class. Actually, they could be helpful in any division, because as her opponents are distracted as they work on the double-speed bags, it could leave them open for The Breasty Bruiser to come over the top with a devastating right hand.\nTexans over Falcons: Ahmed Mohamed, the 14-year-old Muslim student in Texas who was arrested for bringing a suspicious looking homemade clock to school, was honored this week at City Hall by Public Advocate Letitia James. So that’s what the Public Advocate’s job is: To pay tribute to youngsters who scare the crapola out of people by making clocks that look like bombs.\nMayor de Blasio reportedly told Mohamed to “keep doing what you’re doing.” Maybe one of Ahmed’s scary-looking clocks can cure de Blasio of his oversleeping problem. Just to be safe, he’d no doubt want to be up and out of the house before the alarm/timer goes off.\nPanthers over Bucs: Emailer BarkingMut, aka HondoNation SoBe bureau chief, writes Ahmed is coming out with a new line of young adult clothing: Loafers that look like shoe bombs, sleeveless sweaters resembling suicide vests, and backpacks in the shape of pressure cookers.\nRaiders over Bears: “Chicago Med” has joined Dick Wolf’s Chicago-themed television franchise that already included “Chicago PD” and “Chicago Fire.” Rumor has it he has another one in the works for next year: “Chicago Sanitation,” a trashy show that should pick up some good ratings.\nRedskins over Eagles: Sam “The Sham” Bradford did nothing against the Jets (14-28-1-118) that could possibly make anyone wooly bully about laying three points on the road.\nBengals over Chiefs: In addition to rolling out the red carpet for Ahmed Mohamed, the city also honored executed traitor Ethel Rosenberg this week with a proclamation for her bravery as her two sons looked on. Emailer Donny Mac writes the Ethel tribute actually was a last-minute replacement for a tribute to Benedict Arnold, whose great great great grandson canceled.\nChargers over Browns: Let’s hear it for Paul Schwartz, who finally made it into double-figures in the win column during Week 3. And in other Bettor’s Guide news, Ms. Charleen already has clinched her 25th straight Girls Division crown. Heartfelt HondoNation props to both of you for your outstanding achievements.\nPackers over Niners: A total mismatch, every bit as scary as Barack “Red Line” Obama trying to take on Putin.\nBroncos over Vikings: The Edward M. Kennedy Oral History Project has been released by the University of Virginia’s Miller Center. It was called that because it’s such a project to understand what he is saying through all his slurring.\nCardinals over Rams: In one excerpt, Kennedy talks about downing a few morning scotches as a freshman Senator in 1963 before meeting with another Senator about his committee assignments. It’s not clear why he found it noteworthy to mention his standard breakfast.\nCowboys over Saints: Hillary Clinton, at Bill’s suggestion, had several plastic surgeries before beginning her run for President. According to reports, it was done at their home in Chappaqua (she didn’t want to put on a burqa a la Gisele and go to a clinic) and included having her cheeks lifted, wrinkles botoxed, and work done on her eyes, neck and chins. In other words, everything was treated that isn’t covered up by a double-wide pantsuit.\nBill also asked Steven Spielberg to try to make Hillary more likable by analyzing her videos, and he finally came to her defense on the email scandal. It shows how much Bubba wants another crack at the White House interns.\nSeahawks over Lions: Joyce “Tillie” Mitchell received a 2 ¹/₃-7 year sentence in the slamm’er for giving tools to help Richard Matt and David Sweat escape. Apparently, Tillie felt it was the fair thing to do because they had shared their tools with her so many times.\nBest bets: Ravens, Bengals, Cardinals.\nThursday night: Ravens.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under bettor's guide ,  hondo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:49:14.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
