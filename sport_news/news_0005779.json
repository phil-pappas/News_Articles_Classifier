David Tulis / AJC Special The Shepherd Center specializes in treatment, research and rehabilitation for people with spinal cord or brain injuries.\nChanges in medical insurance coverage, means patients spend less time in a hospital or other medical facility than they did a decade ago, so therapists have less time to help them hone their wheelchair mobility skills. Those skills include navigating on different terrain - sand, gravel, brick, curbs or doing up or downhill.\nThe clinic may also cover falling safely, wheelies and uprighting a wheelchair.\nThe event will be held at the Irene and George Woodruff Family Residence Center on the Shepherd campus. Caregivers, a friend or relative may also attend to work on spotting techniques, but it is not required for participation.\nFor more information and to register, contact physical therapist Jill Roecker at 404-603-4631 or jill_roecker@shepherd.org.", "external_links": ["http://www.myajc.com/news/lifestyles/wheelchair-training-helps-people-navigate-various-/nhkp2/", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/22/58/e2/101514-wheelchair-dt15.jpg", "http://www.shepherd.org/"], "published": "2015-10-22T11:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T22:57:26.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
