His form in the national league and a desire from the coaches for something a bit different worked in Mitai-Wells' favour. \nBatch referred to the newcomer as offering a point of difference. \n\"All I can really think of is [he means] my aggression with the way I attack and defend,\" Mitai-Wells said. \nHe has been given a chance at a pivotal time for New Zealand men's hockey. Ranked seventh, they must topple world No1 Australia in the cup to advance to the 2016 Rio Olympics. \nThe bulk of the Black Sticks squad have piled up the caps - eight have played 150 or more internationals - and the new face in the group is relishing what lies ahead. \n\"I am excited but it is a big deal to be playing in the cup. It's the only chance to get into the Olympics and it is quite a big task,\" he said. \nHe has been raised on hockey. Born in Rotorua, he moved to Auckland at the start of this year. \n\"My granddad loves the sport so we all grew up playing - brothers, cousins and uncles. There's a few of us,\" he said. \nMitai-Wells will be the first to make the national team. \nHe has been training with the Black Sticks this year so should not be too fazed when the squad get together in Stratford next week. \nSaid Batch: \"Leo is physically strong and a very hard-working player, and while it's his first opportunity he certainly understands every part of our game plan.\" \nNZ Oceania Cup squad \nGoalkeepers: Devon Manchester (Auckland), Kyle Pontifex (Capital). \nDefenders: Nick Haig, Bradley Shaw (Canterbury), Blair Tarrant, Kane Russell (Southern), Nic Woods (Midlands). \nMidfielders: Simon Child (c), Ryan Archibald, Arun Panchia (Auckland), George Muir (North Harbour), Nick Ross (Southern). \nAttackers: Nick Wilson (Central), Steve Edwards, James Coughlan (North Harbour), Hugo Inglis (Southern), Stephen Jenness (Capital), Leo Mitai-Wells (Midlands).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T10:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:53:59.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
