The Knights scored the only goal of the first half when Bryce Bump drove the ball past Campbell-Savona keeper Brent Smith. “Bump got off a good shot in the box that bounced off the keeper,” Addison head coach Dennis Knowles said. Smith was at a disadvantage, as well, staring right into the setting sun. “The sun did not help him,” Knowles said. Addison took the 1-0 lead into halftime. “I felt that we came out with more intensity in the first half,” Knowles said. “But Campbell-Savona came out with more intensity in the second half and that was the difference in the ballgame.” Roughly 10 minutes into the second half, the Panthers’ Caleb Warn got loose down the left side, then hammered home a shot to the upper right corner of the goal. The game-winning goal came in the 73rd minute off a Campbell-Savona corner kick. “The ball bounced around the 18, then went off a defender and into the goal,” Knowles said. The goal was awarded to Caleb Orvek. On the day, Smith stopped four shots, while teammate Cody White added five saves in the second half. Addison’s Felipe Kain recorded nine saves on the night. Addison will open Section V, Class C1 play on Wednesday as the tournament’s No. 11-seeded team. “We’re young and we’ve had some untimely injuries,” Knowles said. “But we’ve been getting healthy and the young kids are coming along. If we bring our “A” game, we could surprise someone.” By The Leader staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:31:13.360+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
