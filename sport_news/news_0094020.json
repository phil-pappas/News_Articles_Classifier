They will of course make their own decisions and express themselves as they see fit,\" the coach added.\nRecent reports in Italy claimed that Fiorentina fans are planning to whistle the Pharaohs star at every minute of their game against AS Roma on Sunday in the Serie A.\nAccording to Italian newspaper La Republica, the fans have a grudge against the 23-year old winger who made a huge impact at the Violas during a six-month loan spell but declined to extend his stay in order to move to Roma this season.\nFiorentina filed a complaint to FIFA against Salah and his former team Chelsea claiming they had the right to sign the player on a permanent basis after taking the buy-out options. A decision has yet to be made.\nRoma signed the international winger this summer on loan before revealing that they made the deal permanent for a reported fee of 20 million euros.\nSalah scored four goals in eight league appearances this season.\nFiorentina currently ranks at the top of the Serie A table with 18 points, one point ahead of second-placed Roma.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:32:52.176+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
