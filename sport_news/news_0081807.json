The key component in, statistically, the Premier League's joint-best defence so far this season. \nRaheem Sterling (Manchester City) \nInstrumental to Manchester City's 5-1 defeat of Bournemouth. Particularly impressive were his three goals, given his occasionally-erratic finishing is frequently criticised. \nGeorginio Wijnaldum (Newcastle United) \nInspired Newcastle to a much-needed 6-2 win over Norwich with four goals, including two headers and an outstanding long-range strike. Also impressed with his linking of play. \nAnder Herrera (Manchester United) \nEven if he scored the second goal in Manchester United's 3-0 win at Everton, his creativity from midfield was what truly caught the eye. Quite why Louis van Gaal chooses not to start him every week, only the manager will know. \nManuel Lanzini (West Ham) \nScored one and assisted another in West Ham's 3-1 win at Crystal Palace. If he continues to perform like that his loan will likely become a permanent transfer. \nJamie Vardy (Leicester City) \nScored Leicester's two goals to secure a 2-2 draw at Southampton when they had been 2-0 down. Enjoying the finest form of his career, the forward particularly impressed in the way he recovered from missing an excellent chance to equalise by scoring his second. \nWayne Rooney (Manchester United) \nFinally scored in the Premier League - for the first time in 11 months - to prove that class is permanent. The goal was Manchester United's third in their 3-0 win at Everton, and will likely be followed by more given the improved confidence that should follow. \nWilfried Bony (Manchester City) \nScored twice for Manchester City in a 5-1 defeat of Bournemouth to prove that he is capable of replacing the injured Sergio Aguero, and did so having not started a game for them since September 15.
