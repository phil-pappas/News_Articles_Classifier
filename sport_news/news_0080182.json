Determined to stay in the perfect position to strike for his second PGA Tour victory, and first since April 2011, he had a solid 69 to reach 14 under, finding sand off the tee at the long 18th but avoiding a dropped shot. Indeed Steele parred his way home after a birdie at the 10th. \nHe may need to shoot lower on Sunday to finish the job, but showed himself capable with a 63 on Thursday. \nScotland's Martin Laird dipped out of contention after a two-over 74 saw him slide from a share of sixth to a tie for 39th on six under, the same overall score as Northern Ireland's world number three Rory McIlroy whose 71 on Saturday was also out of keeping with the scoring trend, as a host of players went low.
