However it was generally accepted that his six-year reign in the job had come to an end before he took up a director role at Super League outfit Salford in June. \nMeninga has enjoyed unprecedented success in his role as Queensland mentor, leading the Maroons to victory in nine of 10 State of Origin series since taking over for the 2006 season. \nThe former Australian skipper has been bullish in his aspirations towards the top job. \nLike many others, Meninga feels the Kangaroos coaching job should be a stand alone role. \n“To be honest, I don’t know why someone like Wayne would want the Test job. He has plenty of commitments with the Broncos,” Meninga said. \nAfter being dumped by Manly late last season Toovey is another who has expressed interest in the job. \nCleary was sensationally axed by the Panthers on Monday, but his role as PM XIII’s coach in September was an indication he was being groomed for higher coaching honours. \nPROS AND CONS OF KANGAROOS COACHING CONTENDERS \nMAL MENINGA \n* PROS \nAn unprecedented record as Maroons coach that boasts nine State of Origin wins in the last 10 series. \n* CONS \nMeninga’s detractors says he fills more of a managerial role at the Maroons, with the likes of Cameron Smith, Johnathan Thurston and Cooper Cronk the real brains trust. \nWAYNE BENNETT \n* PROS \nThe supercoach showed he has still got it in leading Brisbane to the grand final in his first season back at Red Hill this year. \n* CONS \nDoubts over whether he could wear two hats as Kangaroos and Broncos mentor and the conflicts of interest that might arise. \nGEOFF TOOVEY \n* PROS \nLed Manly to a preliminary final, a grand final and a semi-final in his first three years as coach, before the Sea Eagles missed the finals last season. \n* CONS \nInexperience coaching at representative level. \nIVAN CLEARY \n* PROS \nRevived the fortunes of both the Warriors and the Panthers, leading the New Zealand-based franchise to the 2011 grand final and Penrith to a preliminary final last year. \n* CONS \nPhil Gould says Cleary is burnt out and in need of a rest. Cleary has also indicated his intention to return to the NRL so his appointment to the Kangaroos job would likely only be short term.
