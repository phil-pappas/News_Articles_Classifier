Hundreds, including two sisters who lost their mom in the Charleston Church shooting, paid tribute to the Emanuel Nine. \nThe two sisters hit the hardwood on opposing teams with a common goal. It didn't matter what team you were rooting for or what the score was at the end of the game, Thursday night everyone left the gym a winner. \nTwo sisters on separate sides of the net were playing for the same team fighting against violence. \n\"It was emotional,\" said Kaylin Doctor, a freshman volleyball player at Johnson & Whales University. \nThe two star players were light on their feet, but played with heavy hearts. \n\"It makes me feel like she's right next to my heart,\" said Gracyn Doctor. \nOn June 17, their mom, DePayne Middleton-Doctor, was killed in the Charleston Church shooting. \n\"They've been hard,\" said Gracyn. \"I don't know what I would do without a strong support system.\" \n\"We did this in the remembrance for my mom,\" said Kaylin. \nOrganizers thought this was the perfect opportunity to pull together and put an arm around these sisters. \n\"Its cool to see the competitiveness, but I think everybody is on the same page and understands the magnitude of the game,\" said Donnell Gardner, Team True Blue. \n\"[It] was more about supporting the two of them and our teams coming together on and off the court and showing them what it was all about,\" said Johnson & Wales Head Coach Callie Phillips Read or Share this story: http://www.wcnc.com/story/news/features/2015/10/01/sister-opponents-mourn-and-honor-emanuel-9/73185092/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:28:50.807+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
