Just the nature of the game.\n\"Some days are better than others.\"\nUSA TODAY\nU.S. takes 4-1 Presidents Cup lead after dominating opening session\nSome days are weirder than others, too, and it all started with Mickelson's blunder.\nOn the seventh tee at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea, Mickelson and Johnson were all square in their match against world No. 2 Jason Day and Adam Scott when Mickelson reached into his pocket and pulled out a different model ball than the one he started the match with and swung away. A few moments later, Mickelson found out he violated the One-Ball Condition of the rules, which states a player must use the same model of golf ball throughout the match that he started with on the first hole.\nThe penalty for this breach is a one-hole adjustment in the match.\nBut that wasn't the end of things. Mickelson was incorrectly told he was disqualified from the hole by a rules official so he picked up his ball, leaving Johnson alone against Day and Scott. Day won the hole with a birdie to go 1 up. And with the one-hole adjustment because of the rules violation by Mickelson, the score went to 2 up before the four players reached the eighth hole. But in fact, Mickelson could have actually played out the hole – either with the wrong ball or after putting the correct ball back into play – and tied Day with a birdie of his own, which then would have meant the Americans would have lost the hole just once because of his breech of the rules.\n\"I accept total responsibility for that mistake,\" said Mark Russell, chairman of the Match Committee.\nTo cap off the incident, Johnson and Day each made birdie on the final hole and the match ended all square.\nAlthough the Match Committee realized that it incorrectly advised Mickelson, under Decision 34-2/6 of the Rules of Golf, the committee is not allowed to have Mickelson go back and play in an attempt to correct the error. According to a statement released by the committee, \"Once any player in the match plays a subsequent stroke allowing a correction could potentially undermine the strategy already employed by both sides in the match in completing the hole.\"\nConfused? So were the players.\n\"It was kind of a weird ruling with Phil and that whole situation was weird,\" Day said. \"I've never heard of that before.\"\nNeither had Mickelson.\n\"We've never had a one-ball rule that I can think of in these events, or at least that I was aware of. But it's never been an issue, either,\" said Mickelson, who added that he never fathomed losing two holes in one hole. \"Obviously as a player, you need to know that. You need to know the rules and if you have a question, you do it beforehand.\n\"The weird thing was I've never heard of a match-adjustment penalty. I just thought, OK, well if I hit the wrong ball, no big deal, Zach will cover me this hole, I pick up, put the right ball in play the next hole. But obviously that was not what happened, either, so.\n\"But it's the job of the player to know the rules, and it's not the committee's fault. I know they made a mistake and it's disappointing, but they should not have been put in that situation. It wasn't a hard thing to just play the same ball throughout the round.\"\nMickelson was still bothered by the situation but found a silver lining. And in the process, Phil being Phil, provided some bulletin board material for the Internationals.\n\"I feel like we spotted the Internationals' best team two holes and they still couldn't beat us,\" he said. \"Just saying.\"\nUSA TODAY\nPhil Mickelson proves his Presidents Cup worth after some questioned him\nThe incident will be remembered much longer than the bunker shot Mickelson holed on the 12th hole when he and Johnson rallied. Mickelson, who holed a bunker shot from 20 yards in a key moment Thursday when he and Johnson defeated Day and Steven Bowditch, holed out from a bunker from 142 yards for a hole-winning eagle and a 1-up lead on the 12th hole.\n\"Zach was in there 12 feet, and so I hit an aggressive pitching wedge,\" Mickelson said. \"It kind of drew with the hook-wind and landed five or six feet left of the hole and just side-spun right in the hole. That was nice, because Jason and Adam were down there with a short wedge in, that they very well may have hit it close and had kind of a free run at it. Knocking it in gave us the hole and some momentum.\"\nMost of the momentum, however, was with the Internationals.\nThe local crowds got a big thrill when Sangmoon Bae, the only Korean-born player on the team, made a 20-footer for birdie to win the last hole as he and Danny Lee defeated Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker, 1 up.\n\"I was really desperate that I really wanted to help out the International team, and after I did the last shot on the 18th hole today, I was very happy,\" Bae said. \"But it was a different kind of happiness because I felt like I did something for the team, and I also created a momentum for the other players for the team, so I was very happy, and it was a very thrilling moment.\"\nBranden Grace and Louis Oosthuizen rolled world No. 1 Jordan Spieth and Dustin Johnson, 4 and 3, in the opening match. All the blue flags next to the names of Grace and Oosthuizen, who won the team's only match in Thursday's first session, sparked the other team members.\n\"We went full heart for it today,\" Grace said.\n\"We both played very poor rounds of golf and we didn't have many chances, so it was Merry Christmas to the other guys,\" Spieth said.\nIn the last match of the day, Charl Schwartzel, who couldn't play the first day because of an illness, teamed with Thongchai Jaidee to defeat Bill Haas and Chris Kirk, who did not play the first day.\nThe only victory for the U.S. was provided by J.B. Holmes and Bubba Watson, who went to 2-0 with a 2-up victory against Marc Leishman and Bowditch.\n\"We just had to take care of our point,\" Watson said. \"We could have easily lost. They make one putt or two more putts, we lose. For us, we were just trying to take care of what we were doing. Now, we were hoping and wishing that other points would have come up on the board for us. But at the same time, if we don't control our match or try to win our match, then we can't worry about other people until we secure ours.\"\nPHOTOS: Best shots from Presidents Cup\nThe International team's Danny Lee, left, celebrates after playing partner Sangmoon Bae sank a putt on the 18th green to win their fourball match in the second round.
