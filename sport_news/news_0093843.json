The podium finish seemed to be slipping out of his hands but thanks to the Ferrari driver, he got his place back, seconds before the end of race.\nAn over-ambitious Raikkonen rammed his Ferrari into Valteri Bottas' Williams from the back and ended his race. The Finn managed to complete the last lap but let Perez pass the two cars struggling after the contact.\nMercedes' Lewis Hamilton won the race ahead of Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.\n\"I have been enjoying with the team. Happy to be here. It seemed like everything went away from us. I was unhappy with myself. Many things came to mind. Last lap I gave it all. There was no more I could so. There was massive degradation on my tyres. Last lap, it was amazing, nice to give team a podium,\" Perez said after the race.\nWith 15 points in the kitty from the race, Force India have consolidated their fifth place in the constructors' championship. They are now at 92, 28 more than sixth-placed Lotus.\nPerez said the result is a great reward for all the work team has put in together.\n\"The call to pit under the safety car turned out to be very good because it gave us track position ahead of all the battles. With one lap to go, when Valtteri (Bottas) and Kimi (Raikkonen) passed me, it felt like this result had been taken from us: I was obviously disappointed but I also knew I had given all I could during the race.\n\"There was no more I could do because I had been on the same tyres for more than 40 laps. When I finally managed to get back into third it was just an amazing feeling. I am happy I was able to share this second podium with my team. It's a very special result and one that fills me with expectation ahead of the races in Austin and especially Mexico City.\" he said.\nHulkenberg, who had retire in the opening lap following a spin at turn two, explained how it all happened.\n\"I didn't have the best of starts, but then I was able to pick the ideal line on the approach to turn two. Unfortunately, I locked the rears going into turn two and, when that happens, you just end up in a spin. I hoped the whole field would get past without hitting me but unfortunately Ericsson got stuck with me and I couldn't move away,\" the German said.\n\"The first lap is always a unique situation: I didn't brake any later, but with cold tyres it's really tricky and once the tyres locked there was nothing I could do to save it. It's always a pity to go out at the start and it's really frustrating because our pace seemed really good this weekend. I just want to move on and start thinking about the next race. At the same time I have to say well done to Checo because the podium is a great result for the team.\"\nRobert Fernley, Deputy Team Principal, said pitting Sergio under the safety car was an aggressive call, but it paid off.\n\"We knew we would be under pressure towards the end, but having track position was crucial and the events on the final lap vindicated our decision. Checo did a great job defending against Ricciardo first and Bottas later until the very final stages and then we had some good fortune on the final lap.\n\"The only blot on our copybook today was Nico's accident at the start. It was unfortunate but he will bounce back in Austin. Our recent run of form is testament to the great job we have done over the last few months and it's incredibly satisfying to deliver on the potential we have shown with a podium.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:37:30.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
