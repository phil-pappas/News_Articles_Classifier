He signed an entry-level contract with the Coyotes in May. \nVitale was injured in Saturday’s game against Boston after a fight with the Bruins’ Kevan Miller. He went to the hospital for X-rays after the game. \nVitale was a healthy scratch the first four games before making his season debut against Boston.
