PITTSFORD — Juniors Noah Heckenlively and Andrea Jagielski finished first and second in their respective races to lead the Hillsdale Academy boys’ and girls’ cross country teams to victory at the SCAA jamboree in Pittsford. Heckenlively ran a lifetime best 17:29 to win the boys race, an impressive time at Pittsford’s challenging course. Despite this performance, the Hillsdale Academy boys’ top-5 finishers were tied at 63 with Tekonsha once the race finished. The tiebreaker goes to the 6th runner for each school, and because Tekonsha didn not have a sixth runner available, the Colts won the meet with Ian Calvert’s 30th place finish. The Lady Colts defeated St. Philip Catholic 49-52 with strong performances by Jagielski, Megan Poole (22:49) and Claire Calvert (22:57) who each finished in the top 10. In boys race, two runners from Will Carleton Academy had top 10 finishes. Drew Randall finished at 18:59 while teammate Devlin McNeil finished at 19 minutes flat. “[Randall] works very hard everyday at practice and at all meets,” said Will Carleton coach Stacey Kies. “He trains year-round. We have two that are neck and neck and they have very strong goals to do well and compete with each other.” Pittsford’s boys and girls squads each had good showings on their home course as they hosted the third of four SCAA jamboree. The boys finished in 3rd place with a score of 88 while the girls finished 4th at 99. “We did alright,” said Wildcats coach Brian Smith. “We’re out of it standings-wise for a league championship so we’re training them through these races, trying to get them ready for the regional meet and hopefully the state meet.” Junior Dustin Lennox finished in third place in the boys race with a time of 18:11. He was followed by fellow Wildcat Keagan Hinkley who finished in 15th place at 19:06. Renee Osbourne led the Pittsford girls once again with a time of 21:15, putting her in seventh place on the night. Katlyn Belcher was the next best Wildcat female with a time of 23:47 finishing in 16th place. “They know the course. They practice on it, they know where to surge. You get more spectators, their friends are here, their classmates are here rooting them on so that’s always a good thing.” Other notable female finishes: Alicia Roney, Waldron, 4th, 19:58; Alyssa Phillips, Will Carleton Academy, 10th, 23:14; Anna Richards, Hillsdale Academy, 11th, 23:18; Elizabeth Westfall, Waldron, 18th, 24:21; Aianna Smith, Hillsdale Academy, 19th, 24:30. Other notable male finishes: Connor Oakley, Hillsdale Academy, 6th, 18:39; Jason Marsh, Litchfield, 8th, 18:54; Nick Rush, Hillsdale Academy, 12th, 19:04; Johannes Olson, Hillsdale Academy, 14th, 19:05; Adam Saunders, Pittsford, 19th, 20:20.
