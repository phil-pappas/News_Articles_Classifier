He proposed that parents pay for the additional security, “which is in fact already happening,” he said.\nIn Ramat Gan, city parking enforcers are patrolling near schools, municipal employees are temporarily joining the ranks of security guards and teachers will be joining crossing guards.\nIlan Lior\nHaaretz Correspondent\n ", "external_links": ["http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:32:58.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
