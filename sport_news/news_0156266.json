After throwing mostly fastballs to the first few hitters, Ichiro mixed in an upper-70s breaking pitch to Freddy Galvis, inducing an awkward whiff with his first one. \nSuzuki allowed one run on two hits with a ground out and two fly outs. \nSuzuki, a 15-year big league veteran, finished this season with 2,935 major-league hits and another 1,278 hits in nine professional seasons with the Orix Blue Wave in Japan. \nThe Marlins lost 7-2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T16:50:50.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
