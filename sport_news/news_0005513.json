Teixeira (.255, 31 HR, 79 RBI) was on par to accomplish similar full-season stats alone, until a fractured right shin Aug. 17 led to an abrupt end to his season.\nBird, 22, began the season at Class AA Trenton and became a steady presence in manager Joe Girardi's lineup, batting .261 with 11 homers and 31 RBI while playing better than adequately at first base – a position he converted to after being drafted as a catcher.\nBut with Teixeira expected to be 100 percent ready for the start of spring training, Bird is tentatively ticketed to start the 2016 season at Class AAA Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.\n\"If Teix is healthy and [designated hitter] Alex (Rodriguez) is healthy, right now I don't foresee him playing another position,\" general manager Brian Cashman said of Bird. \"So, that would create a problem.\"\nSecond thoughts \nWhile the Yankees could explore signing free agent Ben Zobrist or trading (again) for Martin Prado, the big-league depth chart at second base – for now- is a lefty-righty platoon of Dustin Ackley and Rob Refsnyder.\n\"I think we have at least some comfort knowing that I have Ref,\" Cashman said. \"I maybe have Ackley if we get a better feel for what he can provide on the defensive standpoint.\"\nCashman also mentioned Jose Pirela, who batted .305 this year at Class AAA with 10 homers and 60 RBI in 535 at-bats. But he's yet to show that type of offensive promise in two seasons of cameos at the major league level.\n\"I think we have some candidates … unless something presents themselves as being better,\" Cashman said. During the season, Cashman said the only second base upgrade he explored was Zobrist, who wound up going from Oakland to Kansas City after the GM refused to package Refsnyder and Adam Warren.\n— Pete Caldera", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:15:02.047+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
