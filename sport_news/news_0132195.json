The Wolverines defeated the Cougars 31-0. (Photo by Doug Pensinger/Getty Images) Doug Pensinger Previous Next \nNo. 13 Northwestern (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten) at No. 18 Michigan (4-1, 1-0), 3:30 p.m. (BTN) \nLine: Michigan by 8 \nSeries Record: Michigan leads 56-15-2 \nWHAT'S AT STAKE \nNorthwestern keeps its high hopes, in the Big Ten and nationally, if it stays undefeated with a second win over a ranked opponent one next week before hosting Iowa. Michigan can maintain momentum it has earned with four straight wins since opening the Jim Harbaugh era with a seven-point setback at Utah, going into next week's game against Michigan State at the Big House. \nKEY MATCHUP \nNorthwestern's stingy defense will likely force QB Jake Rudock to throw the ball down the field, possibly exploiting his weakness. The Wildcats have started the same 11 players on defense in every game this season. They have shut out two teams, given up a nation-low seven points a game and rank second in third-down defense. Rudock has thrown six interceptions, one more than he threw all of last season at Iowa, and has lost two fumbles in five games with the Wolverines. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nNorthwestern: RB Justin Jackson. The speedy and powerful sophomore opened with 28 carries for 134 yards rushing against Stanford, his first of four 100-yard games this season and 10 in his career. Jackson is going against a defense that has shut out consecutive opponents and is giving up an average of just 71.4 yards rushing per game, ranking fifth in the nation. \nMichigan: DE Royce Jenkins-Stone. The senior is expected to get the biggest opportunity of his career, starting his first game this season and just the third of his career. Jenkins-Stone is projected to replace Mario Ojemudia, who made at least one tackle for loss in each of the team's first five games. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nThe Wildcats can surpass their number of wins from the previous two years, both of which they finished with 5-7 records, with their first victory against the Wolverines since beating them seven years ago on the road. ... Michigan ranks No. 1 in third-down defense, No. 2 in points and yards allowed. ... The Wolverines can match the number of wins Brady Hoke (5-7) had last year before being fired. ... Both Northwestern's Pat Fitzgerald (LB) and Harbaugh (QB) played for the teams they're coaching. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
