She set a new benchmark for humility and honesty that Australia wanted all its sports stars to aspire to, and she became a national symbol of pride and hope.\nSo it’s no surprise she used her status for good. She has campaigned tirelessly for Indigenous rights, and established the Cathy Freeman Foundation in 2007 to support Aboriginal children’s access to education.\nBut now her legacy has left another mark, and it’s out of this world. Literally.\nOne of the most memorable features of Freeman’s winning run 15 years ago was how she looked doing it. She wore a full green, gold and silver bodysuit, complete with a hood to cover her hair.\nIt had such positive results for her then that aerospace engineers decided the same principles behind her suit should be applied to help those in space.\nThe innovative new SkinSuit was developed at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, and was first worn at the International Space Station in September. Aerospace engineer Dr James Waldie used Freeman’s suit as inspiration to create the SkinSuit as a way of combatting the adverse effects of weightlessness on the body in space.\nEverybody remembers where they were the moment Freeman won gold. Source: AP\n“Given the impact of atrophy on astronauts in space, I wondered if a suit like the one worn by Freeman could fool the body into thinking it was on the ground rather than in space, and therefore stay healthy,” Waldie said in a statement.\nAstronauts often experience a loss in bone and muscle mass while in space, as well as stretching of the spine, which causes significant discomfort. The suit aims to gradually place increased pressure on the body to simulate the effect of gravity back on Earth.\nDanish astronaut Andreas Mogensen was the first person to trial the suit, wearing it for 10 days.\n“Seeing live video of Andreas wearing SkinSuit on board the ISS was thrilling — I felt an enormous sense of achievement that my concept was finally in orbit,” said Waldie.\n“We believe if we can reduce spinal elongation in space, we can reduce the stress on the intervertebral discs,” Waldie is Quote: d as saying in E&T Magazine . “This should help with pain in-flight and the chances of slipped discs post-flight.”\nWaldie worked with scientists from America and England, as well as some from the European Space Agency (ESA).\n“It was really exciting but also very humbling, as there are so many people that have dedicated so much effort to this success. To share their passion, and see it all come to fruition, has been amazing,” said Waldie.\nFreeman's gold medal run ", "external_links": ["http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/9ee6270286cec6fae23e16c9d30a0b0c", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/7ac833fa1e7aaa18cafa39ccfa5e6255", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js", "http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/origin:fatwire.", "http://eandt.theiet.org/news/2015/oct/gravity-simulating-suit.cfm"], "published": "2015-10-16T05:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T17:49:07.209+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
