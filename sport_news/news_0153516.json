Texas, however, won't have to pay Patterson next year if he finds a new job that will pay him at least $1.4 million. The university would need to make up the difference if Patterson's new job paid less than $1.4 million, the website reported.\nNew Texas President Greg Fenves announced the decision on a conference call Sept. 15 in what he called a resignation after a \"mutually-agreed upon decision.\" The school had used similar terminology to describe the firings of football coach Mack Brown and men's basketball coach Rick Barnes.\nFenves said it wasn't one or two particular concerns that led to this decision.\n\"This has been a decision that has been building over recent weeks, not a very long time,\" Fenves said. \"And I felt the risks of not accepting his resignation at this time and try to have him stay outweighed the benefits.\"\nPatterson's predecessor, DeLoss Dodds, spent 32 years in Austin building the most financially successful athletic department in the country. Patterson lasted 22 months.\nClick here to read the full report.\nMore on split of Texas, Steve Patterson\n(Eric Gay/AP)\nCarlton: Steve Patterson provided blueprint of what not to do as Texas athletic director\nTexas AD Steve Patterson out after two years with Longhorns\nSherrington: With AD out, no sure things at Texas for Charlie Strong, others\nPossible Texas AD candidates include Mack Brown and Big 12 competitors\nTom Hicks calls Steve Patterson's firing 'a tragedy,' but his own fault due to 'fatal flaw'\nNational reaction: Ex-Longhorns lobby for Mack Brown to replace Steve Patterson as Texas AD\nTexas president Greg Fenves sends email to Longhorn faithful, pledges support for Charlie Strong, Shaka Smart\nNational Analyst: Steve Patterson was 'too arrogant' for Texas\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/national-analyst-steve-patterson-arrogant-texas", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/tom-hicks-calls-steve-pattersons-firing-tragedy-fault-due-fatal-flaw-inability-communicate", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/carlton-steve-patterson-provided-blueprint-texas-athletic-director", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texaslonghorns/2015/09/15/possible-candidates-texas-ad-job-include-mack-brown-big-12-competitors", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texaslonghorns/2015/09/15/sherrington-pattersons-legacy-texas-one-acidic-relationships", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/texaslonghorns/2015/09/15/texas-ad-steve-patterson-fired", "http://www.scout.com/college/texas/story/1589828-sources-patterson-get-28-million", "https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/texas-ad-steve-patterson-resigns-mike-perrin-serve-interim", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/09/15/longhorn-players-media-react-texas-ad-steve-pattersons-firing"], "published": "2015-09-22T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:58:10.294+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
