The Warhawks have yet to beat an FBS opponent so far this season. \nLast Saturday provided the latest indignation for long-suffering fans who opted for the exits at Malone Stadium instead of sitting through a 59-14 loss to Appalachian State — ULM’s worst home loss in the program’s FBS era. \nThe team hasn’t been immune from the talk outside of the program, much of which centers on Berry’s job security. \n“A win would do a whole lot for our confidence and probably put everything to rest and help people feel good about this place,” tight end Harley Scioneaux said. “We’ve played hard each week but we’ve had to go back to the drawing board and look at a couple things.” Wickstrom not ready to give up on ULM's season \nThe first adjustment ULM made this week started at the top, where Berry relinquished the play calling to assistant head coach and offensive coordinator Steve Farmer for the Idaho game. \nBerry said he thought giving up calling plays for one week was in the best interest of the team and would allow him to be more involved with the defense. \nDespite a losing streak that’s now at four-straight games, Berry said he’s proud of the way ULM has handled many adverse situations this season, including all the injury woes and the sudden death of backup quarterback Daniel Fitzwater. \n“I told the team on Sunday one of the toughest things for a football team to do, and that’s why we do it, is to go over to your student section and your band after a game. When you win there’s an elation that comes with success but when you lose you have to face the music,” Berry said. \n“Sunday there weren’t any heads down. Their heads were up kind of owning this and that’s part of being accountable.” \nFollow Adam on Twitter @adam_hunsucker 20 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/1LJo6aZ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T13:35:08.185+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
