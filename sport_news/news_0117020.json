One of the main differences between that roster makeover and this one is this time Bowman got a few more NHL-ready players in return.\nThe Hawks aren't so much rebuilding as they are reloading in the hopes of keeping their Cup window open.\nSeveral new faces will play significant roles this season. Here's a look.\nTrevor Daley , defenseman: The Hawks acquired Daley, 31, who has two years remaining on his contract, in the deal that sent Patrick Sharp and defensive prospect Stephen Johns to the Stars. Daley's addition offset the loss of Johnny Oduya, who signed with the Stars in free agency. Daley's possession numbers are not on the level with the Hawks' top three defensemen â€” Duncan Keith, Niklas Hjalmarsson and Brent Seabrook, but Daley is known more for his offensive prowess. He scored a career-high 16 goals last season, including six on the power play.\nArtem Anisimov , center: One of three new Russians on the team, Anisimov, 27, came over in the trade that sent Brandon Saad to the Blue Jackets. Bowman was so high on Anisimov that he immediately gave him an extension through 2021 to be the second-line center the Hawks have sought for years. The Hawks hope Anisimov will mesh well with Patrick Kane, who said he prefers left-handed centers like Anisimov. Anisimov had 22 goals two seasons ago.\nArtemi Panarin , winger: The Hawks were one of several teams vying for the services of Panarin, 23, who spent the last four seasons in the KHL developing into a dynamic scorer. Panarain was injured much of training camp, but his contract included an out clause that would allow him to go back to Russia if he did not make the team. Regardless, the Hawks like his playmaking ability.\nRookie Artemi Panarin impressive in first exhibition game with Blackhawks Chris Hine Blackhawks rookie winger Artemi Panarin was named the second star of Saturday's 4-0 exhibition victory over the Stars.\nAs is customary with the three stars, the public address announcer will say the player's name, the player will skate in a small circle on the ice and acknowledge the crowd before...\nBlackhawks rookie winger Artemi Panarin was named the second star of Saturday's 4-0 exhibition victory over the Stars.\nAs is customary with the three stars, the public address announcer will say the player's name, the player will skate in a small circle on the ice and acknowledge the crowd before...\n(Chris Hine) Viktor Tikhonov , winger: Tikhonov, 27, is the grandson of the famous Russian national team coach and was a member of the Coyotes organization before going to the KHL to refine his game. He and Panarin played on the same team last season and he and Anisimov serve as interpreter for Panarin, who is just learning to speak English. Tikhonov is expected to play on the bottom two lines.\nRyan Garbutt , winger: The Hawks also acquired Garbutt, 30, in the Sharp trade with the Stars, retaining half of his $1.8 million cap hit. Garbutt has looked good through the preseason, using his speed to mesh well with the Hawks' style. He's a bottom-six winger who possesses some of the same skills and provocative attitude as Andrew Shaw and Andrew Desjardins. In that way Garbutt may seem a bit redundant on the roster. Garbutt is looking to rebound from an eight-goal performance last season after scoring 17 two seasons ago.\n Ice Hockey Chicago Blackhawks Stan Bowman Dallas Stars Patrick Sharp Andrew Desjardins NHL", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-5612aaed/turbine/ct-blackhawks-newcomers-spt-1006-20151005", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561196a1/turbine/ct-artemi-panarin-blackhawks-spt-1005-20151004"], "published": "2015-10-05T19:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:46:36.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
