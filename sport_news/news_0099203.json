But the Bombers quickly marched 82 yards to close within 27-20 on a 19-yard Hunter Wright touchdown reception and 2-point conversion run from quarterback Max Stoltz. \nTaylor Roberts hauled in a huge 53-yard pass for Ballard’s big play of the drive. \nThe Bomber defense then made a huge stop after Burnett returned a Bomber onside kick to the Ballard 14. The Bombers forced Carlisle to turn the ball over on downs to get the ball back on its own 13 with just 1:42 left. \nStoltz and Moody connected on two huge plays to get the ball down to the Wildcat 21. Stoltz caught a 22-yard throwback pass from Moody and Moody then snared a 43-yard pass on third-and-10. \nStoltz hooked up with Tyler Ihle for a 9-yard pass and Hunter Wright followed with a 10-yard run to give Ballard a first down on the Carlisle 10. Two plays later, Edwards made a sliding 3-yard reception in the end zone to get Ballard within an extra point of tying the game with 23 seconds left. \nBut after Ballard barely got the ball snapped before the play clock ran out, Burnett slipped passed the Bomber line and blocked the extra-point try from Ballard’s Charlie Rietz. The Bombers were unable to regain position on the kickoff to suffer their second-straight close loss - following a 28-22 setback at Gilbert the week before. \n“We should’ve gone for two there,” Ballard head coach Al Christian said. “That’s on me. I just feel bad for the kids.” \nBut Christian said he couldn’t have been more pleased with the way his players finished the game. That should give them a nice momentum boost heading back into Class 3A District 6 play next week at Newton (0-5). \n“It would’ve been easy when it was 27-12 to say it was a non-district game, let’s just turn it in and wait for next week,” Christian said. “But they didn’t. They kept battling and kept fighting. They listened to the coaches and worked their adjustments. I feel bad for them that we couldn’t get a win for them tonight. They have to take from this the type of effort they gave on to the next four weeks. As a bad as this one is going to hurt, the next four weeks are really what’s important now.” \nBallard had 357 yards of total offense with 249 passing and 108 rushing and no turnovers. \nStoltz completed 11 of 22 passes for 196 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. He also ran for 41 yards and a score and caught one pass for 24 yards. Wright had 54 yards rushing and 27 receiving, Roberts caught three passes for 88 yards and Moody was 2 of 2 passing for 53 yards and added one 43-yard reception. \nSeth Moore made 14 tackles, Kade Wilson had 10.5 stops, Kaleb Odden tallied 9.5 and Wyatt Terrones and Kolby Jensen each made seven tackles for Ballard on defense. Easton Moody chipped in five tackles plus a fumble recovery. \nCarlisle ran for 308 yards on 45 carries and totaled 373 yards of offense. \nBurnett ran for 144 yards and two touchdowns on 22 carries, Pierce ran for 89 yards and threw for 65 and Dallas Wright made three catches for 49 yards for the Wildcats (3-2). Burnett also had 6.5 tackles and one sack and Joe Crowley made two sacks for Carlisle on defense. \nBallard’s game next week with Newton will take place at 7:30 p.m. in Newton. \nCarlisle 27, Ballard 26 \nC 8 6 7 6 - 27 \nB 0 6 0 20 - 26 \nScoring \nC - Andrew Burnett 5 run (Brian Robertson pass from Jordan Pierce), 9:31 \nSecond quarter \nB - Max Stoltz 1 run (run failed), 9:18 \nC - Dallas Wright 28 pass from Pierce (kick failed), 0:25 \nThird quarter \nC - Gabe McCaughey 24 run (Anthony Hanson kick), 5:59 \nFourth quarter \nB - Austin Edwards 29 pass from Jaden Moody (kick blocked), 7:08 \nC - Burnett 8 run (pass failed), 4:19 \nB - Hunter Wright 19 pass from Stoltz (Stoltz run), 3:01 \nB - Edwards 3 pass from Stoltz (kick blocked), 0:23 \nTeam statistics C B", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T18:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:05:59.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
