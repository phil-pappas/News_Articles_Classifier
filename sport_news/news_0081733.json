(Adam Davy/PA via AP) UNTIED KINGDOM OUT - ... more > By JAMES ELLINGWORTH   \nKIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Outside of the top 10 in the Premier League and outside of the qualifying spots in Champions League Group G. That’s not how Chelsea’s October was supposed to look. \nFollowing a 2-1 loss to Porto last time out, Tuesday’s visit to Ukraine could offer a much needed boost, especially since group leader Dynamo Kiev is coming off a heavy loss to its fiercest domestic rival. \nStill, the Ukrainians will be no pushover. Dynamo boasts passionate home fans as well as star winger Andriy Yarmolenko, who last week signed a new five-year contract. \nIn the other game Tuesday, Porto hosts Israeli opposition for the first time and will be widely expected to beat a Maccabi Tel Aviv side that has lost both its games so far and has yet to score a goal. \n___ \nMAKE OR BREAK FOR CHELSEA? \nThe match against Dynamo in Ukraine on Tuesday could have a big influence on Chelsea’s European aspirations this season. \nThe defeat to Porto leaves Chelsea third in Group G with three points and visiting a stadium with a reputation as something of a fortress. Dynamo has not lost any of its last seven European home games dating back to the 2013-14 season. \nCoach Jose Mourinho thinks Saturday’s 2-0 English Premier League win over Aston Villa could mark the team turning a corner. After the game he admitted that “some of our players have lost confidence” but that results like the win over Villa could bring it back. \nAmong the goalscorers was striker Diego Costa, who also scored in Chelsea’s Champions League-opening 4-0 win over Maccabi but had his recent game time curtailed by a Premier League suspension. \nAs well as the long-term injury to goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, defender Branislav Ivanovic is doubtful after missing the Villa fixture. \nChelsea should expect a tough reception in Kiev, where the crowd is large and loud, though its passion can take less pleasant forms. Last season, the club was punished by UEFA for fan racism in its Europa League win over Everton. \n___ \nMOURINHO BACK IN KIEV \nFor Chelsea coach Jose Mourinho, Tuesday’s game against Dynamo will be his second trip to Kiev’s Olimpiyskiy stadium this month.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T15:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:37:25.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
