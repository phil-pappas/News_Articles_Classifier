Live Stream \nWith the MLB postseason moving to national broadcasts, it's easier to get ahead of an online broadcast. Even the official MLB option is more reasonable. \nFox Sports 1 has a solid streaming service for desktop and mobile. It's free for cable subscribers, which may make things a little tricky for folks who cut the cord. \nMLB.tv Postseason Package - A package from the league that lets you catch postseason games streaming on your computer and other devices. May not include all ALCS/NLCS games. \nFox Sports Go (or Fox Sports Go mobile app ) - Fox carries a pretty good streaming service for national games -- free for cable subscribers. \n--- \nThe Blue Jays made the curious decision of having ace David Price pitch in relief in a Game 4 situation in which Toronto was already up six runs late. It was a weird move then, and will continue to be discussed as they head into Game 5 without him starting the game. In his stead, the Blue Jays will send youngster Marcus Stroman to make the start. Stroman was effective in his first career playoff outing, going seven innings while giving up three earned runs. \nMeanwhile, the Rangers still have the services of trade acquisition Cole Hamels at their disposal. We won't get the traded ace vs. traded ace scenario some may have dreamed of for Game 5, and that might just work in Texas' favor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T21:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:22:58.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
