The only next logical step is a Beast Mode Frappuccino.\nPresto! Coming right up.\nMarshawn took a trip to the Starbucks test lab to cook up his very own Frap to help benefit his Fam 1st Foundation . The drink seems ... interesting . It's a double mocha frap with mint, cream and protein powder with whipped cream, \"purple berry drizzle\"(???) and a matcha powder sprinkle.\n(Note: He did eventually take off his backpack that probably held Skittles and pounds of protein powder.)\nStarbucks wrote that after tasting his concoction, Marshawn said, \" I'd drink this before a workout. I'd get buff on this .\"\nSo there you go -- get buff on Starbucks' new Beast Mode Fraps.\nAnd for a good cause, as stated on the coffee company's website :\nFor every Beast Mode™ Frappuccino® blended beverage sold throughout the football season in Washington and Oakland, Starbucks will donate 24 cents – which coincides with Lynch’s number – to the Fam 1st Family Foundation, up to $100,000. Starbucks will kick off the new collaboration and beverage with a minimum $24,000 contribution to the foundation.\nCheers to swole Fraps. Swole Fraps for all.\nAll Photos : Starbucks , H/T @RapSheet\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://fam1stfamilyfoundation.org/", "http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/RapSheet/status/656476633877061632", "https://news.starbucks.com/news/beast-mode-frappuccino-to-benefit-opportunity-youth"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T20:47:58.023+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
