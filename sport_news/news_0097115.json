Specifically, if the man hired as the Blue Jackets new headman on Wednesday could change as a person from his former hotheaded self.\n“What do you think?” Lundqvist said jokingly. “I don’t know, he is the way he is. I think he was very consistent the way he coached and the way he talked to us as players and people. It was fun. He was tough, but he was honest. As a player, I think you appreciate that. Straight answers all the time.\n“Sometimes as a player, you don’t want to hear the truth, but the truth is good. Sometimes it’s not good, but in the long run, it is — if that makes any sense.”\nTortorella took over the Blueshirts for the fired Tom Renney in the middle of the 2008-09 season, and was behind the bench for four more years until his dismissal following a disappointing first-round exit from the postseason in 2012-13. He is the winningest U.S.-born coach in NHL history, and won a Stanley Cup with the Lightning in 2004.\nIn his most recent job before Columbus, he flamed out in one year as coach of the Canucks in 2013-14. He was recently named head coach of the U.S. team for the World Cup of Hockey, to take place next September in the middle of NHL training camps.\n“We needed a change when he came in here,” Lundqvist said. “He did a great job in pushing everyone and challenging guys in a good way to perform better. It was refreshing to see something new like that.”\nForward Tanner Glass cleared waivers on Wednesday and was assigned to AHL Hartford. Coach Alain Vigneault said he expected Glass and his $1.45 million salary-cap charge to clear, and the decision was made “to save a little bit of money at this time,” along with being able to see what the team has in Emerson Etem, who has been a healthy scratch for all but one game to start the year.\nThe 23-year-old Etem would have had to clear waivers as well, and likely would have been claimed. But Vigneault said, “before we would even think going that route, we have to know what we have.”\nLundqvist will start on Thursday night at the Garden against the Coyotes, his seventh start in the first eight games. … Center Derek Stepan missed practice after getting a wisdom tooth removed. Vigneault expects Stepan back for Thursday, saying it “shouldn’t be a problem.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:21:41.725+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
