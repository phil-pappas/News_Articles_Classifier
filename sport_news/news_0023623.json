East Coweta boys won its first ever Coweta Cup Championship meet on its home course last Saturday. Northgate was second and Newnan third. \nNorthgate’s varsity starters traveled to the 13th annual Nike/Fleet Feet Coach Wood Invitational in Gainesville, with the Vikings winning the Cardinal Boys division among 14 schools and the Lady Vikings placing sixth overall in the Gold Girls division. \nSenior Cathleen Hoffman pulled double duty, running in both meets. She led the Lady Vikings at the Coweta Cup with a ninth-place finish in 22:30 before bettering her time at the Coach Wood Invitational in 22:08. \nThe Coach Wood Invitational meet featured 52 boys teams and 52 girls teams split into Championship, Cardinal and Gold divisions. North- gate competes in the Region 4- meet hosted by Starr’s Mill on Saturday at Heritage Christian Church in Fayetteville. \nCompeting among teams that included Marietta, Heritage-Catooosa, Tupelo (Miss.), Wesleyan and Dac- ula, Northgate’s girls placed sixth while led by junior Elise Glorvigen’s sixth-place finish in 20:18. \nJunior Caroline Nelson was 19th in 20:54.56, and sophomore Sydney Tuttle placed 42nd in 21:48. Seniors Erica Lee and Hoffman both crossed in 22:08 to close out the scoring. \nThe Vikings had four of the top nine finishers in the Cardinal Boys division led by sophomore Hayden Hasburg- er’s third-place finish in 16:59. \nSenior Andrew Tuttle (7th, 17:36) and juniors Sherman Dewey (8th, 17:47) and Jaelin Rainey (9th, 17:50) all crossed in the top-10. Senior Alex DiTaranto was 28th in 18:32. \nAt the Coweta Cup meet, Shumake’s time bettered his previous best by more than 90 seconds and was just four seconds from setting a new school record. Both East Coweta and Newnan will head to the Region 3- Championships on Oct. 31 at the Newnan Utilities Reservoir near Carl Miller Park. \nThe event also showed off East Coweta’s future varsity lineup. Lee Middle eighth graders Jake Young and Kyle Harkabus led a victory in the JV boys race with efforts of 18:05 and 18:30, respectively. Both are ranked among the top-10 runners at their age group in the state and Harkabus is ranked among the top-100 at his age group nationally. \nSophomore Jakin Buckalew placed third for the JV Indians, whose 24-point effort was ahead of Northgate (38) and Newnan (67). \nAmong varsity boys, junior Bobby Martin finished behind Shumake in second place in 17:30. Freshman Kade Johnson (4th, 17:40), senior Zach Jones (6th, 17:51) and freshman Xavier Church (8th, 17:55) also scored. \nNewnan senior Mary Douglass Hallman cruised to an individual victory among girls in 20:15.51, more than a minute ahead of East Coweta sophomore Miya Dean. \nThe Lady Indians, with four of the top-six finishers including Dean, won the varsity team trophy with 23 points, ahead of Newnan and Northgate. \nEast Coweta’s scorers included freshmen Holly Hind (3rd, 21:36), Haley Davis (4th, 21:40) and Riley Walsh (6th, 21:49), as well as junior Reina Chen (8th, 22:26). \nScoring for Newnan’s girls behind Hallman were senior Caroline Thomas (5th, 21:49), junior Mallory Greene (7th, 22:18), senior Julia Sanders (10th, 22:48) and Senior Lindley Hudson (12th, 23:21). \nJuniors Garrett Klone (5th, 17:50) and Mason Bray (7th, 17:54) led the Vikings. \nNewnan’s junior varsity girls finished with a perfect score of 15, with seniors Emily Flournoy (23:08), Emma Mor- ris (24:23) and Darby Cook (24:32) crossing first through third, respectively. \nLATE TUESDAY \nLIONS WIN GISA REGION 1-AAA TITLE, LADY LIONS PLACE SECOND \nTrinity Christian and The Heritage School competed at the GISA Region 1-AAA championship on Tuesday at Loganville Christian. \nTrinity’s boys won a region title and the Lady Lions finished second. \nBoth lineups now advance to the GISA State Meet. \nA detailed story will appear later this week in the Times-Herald.
