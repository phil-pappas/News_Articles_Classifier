Then, Modesto-Central Catholic, a nationally recognized small-school power, rolled into town and all those statistics went out the window. Fresno State-commit Justin Rice ran for 280 yards and three touchdowns, and the Raiders physically dominated Manteca on their way to a 28-6 Valley Oak League victory on Friday at Guss Schmiedt Field. Manteca (6-1, 3-1) entered the game unbeaten, unchallenged and sporting one of the elite defenses in Northern California, having allowed just 20 points. The starting unit hadn’t given up a score until allowing a touchdown in last week’s 43-8 rout of Sierra. When these teams met last season, Central Catholic’s first VOL game after being promoted to the top-tier league following years of dominating lesser competition, the Raiders won 29-28 in overtime, when Rice crashed into the end zone for the walk-off two-point conversion. Many expected a repeat of last year’s battle, but the Buffaloes stuggled to throw and were unable to consistently run against Central Catholic’s aggressive, athletic defense. Dakarai Charles provided the only points for the Buffaloes, tossing a 50-yard touchdown pass to Jose Garcia to make it 14-6 in the second quarter. Manteca didn’t approach the end zone the rest of the game, while the Raiders continued to churn out yards and control the clock. In an era of prolific offenses, no-huddle schemes and wild scoring affairs, this game took the crowd back decades. Central Catholic huddled after each play, while Manteca took their time between snaps. Neither felt comfortable going to the air and both quarterbacks were more effective as runners. It was a rough game for Charles, as the dynamic senior was twice knocked from the action after taking wicked hits in the open field. He had receivers slip behind the Raiders’ four or five times, but his passes were always just out of reach. Charles was forced to improvise much of the game because he was Manteca’s only threat, and he was often on the run when he dropped back to throw. He was most effective after breaking containment, dashing into the secondary for yardage. Those sporadic runs weren’t enough to preserve Manteca’s perfect record.
