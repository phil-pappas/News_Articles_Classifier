Prosecutors say she asked the boy to keep their relationship quiet and practiced what to say if he spoke to law enforcement.\nMcCrea said in court Wednesday she takes responsibility for her actions and that she feels the pain of knowing she's hurt many people with her choices.\n— The Associated Press", "external_links": ["http://goo.gl/Xl5PZr"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:03:33.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
