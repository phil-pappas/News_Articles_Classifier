The Beavers rushed for 215 yards in the game.\nFalk, who threw for 505 yards and five touchdowns at Oregon, completed 39 of 50 passes for 407 yards, with two interceptions. He came into the game leading the Pac-12 in passing at 396 yards per game, and has thrown 21 touchdown passes with just four picks this season.\nDom Williams caught 11 passes for 158 yards and two touchdowns for WSU.\nOregon State, under new coach Gary Andersen , produced 394 yards of total offense, but couldn't slow the Cougars in the first half.\nWashington State's Tavares Martin Jr. returned the opening kickoff 51 yards and the Cougars marched down the field, with Falk throwing a 3-yard touchdown pass to River Cracraft.\nOregon State went three-and-out, and Washington State replied with a 69-yard drive that ended with Falk's 3-yard touchdown pass to Williams.\nGarrett Owens kicked a 50-yard field goal to put Oregon State on the scoreboard near the end of the first quarter.\nGabe Marks caught a 23-yard touchdown pass from Falk in the opening seconds of the second quarter for a 21-3 lead.\nOregon State tried a fake punt from its own 20, but punter Nick Porebski was dropped for a 6-yard loss. After a touchdown pass to Marks was called back for offensive interference, the Cougars had to settle for a 30-yard field goal by Erik Powell and a 24-3 lead.\nOregon State's Victor Bolden returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards down the right sideline to cut the WSU lead to 24-10.\nThe Beavers then tried an onside kick, but the Cougars recovered on the 50. After a 28-yard reception by Williams, Falk's fourth touchdown pass was for eight yards to Jamal Morrow.\nAfter an OSU punt, Washington State drove 69 yards, with Falk throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass to Morrow for a 38-10 lead.\nOregon State's Collins led an 80-yard drive that ended with his 12-yard touchdown run.\nBut WSU replied with Falk's 11-yard touchdown pass to Williams in the closing seconds of the half, for a 45-17 halftime lead.\nFalk's six touchdown passes in the first half tied the school record for most touchdown passes in a full game, set by Connor Halliday last year. The Cougars had 399 yards of offense in the first half.\nNeither team scored in the third quarter.\nCollins threw a short touchdown pass to Jordan Villamin late in the fourth, to close within 45-25. The Beavers then recovered the on-side kick with 5:44 left in the game. But Collins was intercepted by Shalom Luani, who returned the ball 84 yards for a touchdown. Luani had a second interception to end Oregon State's next possession.\nThe Beavers came in with the Pac-12's top-ranked pass defense, allowing an average of 177 yards a game.\nLeach has a career record of 100-70 at Texas Tech and with the Cougars.\nThis is the 100th game in the series, which Washington State leads 50-47-3.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:24:42.521+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
