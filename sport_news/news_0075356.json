It was a clean game with a lot of hard hits and the younger Cats never gave up. But mistakes also killed them. Whitefish had a successful onside kick that went off the hands of a Cat player and quarterback Dakota Bridwell had to contend with two snaps that went over his head. One of those resulted in a turnover, the other killed a Cat drive. Bridwell did not have an interception, however. \nBridwell finished the game with 110 yards passing against a tough Bulldog defense that held the Cats to negative 11 rushing yards. Whitefish, which was bigger and faster, had 236 yards on the ground and 203 yards passing. \nThe Cats at times had six sophomores on defense and started a freshman as well. There was a bright spot on the defense — Bryce Fagerland had a 68-yard pick six for the Cats only score of the game. \nSchweikert has confidence in his young squad showing success. \n“We’re closer than people think,” he said. \nHe said the Cats will trim the playbook a bit for Polson and the boys need to play fast and aggressive against the Pirates. The game is at home Friday at 7 p.m. \nWhitefish 3 34 3 7 — 47 \nC.
