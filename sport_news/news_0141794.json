Brent Burns and Tomas Hertl added insurance markers in the second period, and Joonas Donskoi was credited with his first NHL goal 3:31 into the third period to give the Sharks a four-goal lead.

They play a heavy, honest game,\" DeBoer said Wednesday morning. \"You know coming in here, you have to be prepared to play a heavy honest game to have success.\" \nIt was also DeBoer's first taste of the rivalry between the Sharks and Kings, who play each other again on Oct. 22 at SAP Center. There were three fights by early in the third period, with Mike Brown getting into two scraps. Advertisement \n\"Spending the last month in San Jose around the team, around the people, around the players, it's obvious there are some big rivalries in the state,\" DeBoer said. \nThe Sharks held the Kings to just eight shots in the first period and six in each of the last two periods. Special teams were also a factor for the Sharks, San Jose killed off all six of its penalties and converted 2 of 7 power plays. \nJones' first official start for the Sharks got off to an auspicious beginning, as the Kings' first shot of the game found its way into the net. \nDustin Brown's shot from just inside the blue line was tipped by Nick Shore past Jones just 1:49 into the first period. Shore fought off a check from Hertl to get his stick into the shooting lane. \nBrown scrapped with Kyle Clifford two seconds after Shore's goal, and Jones and the Sharks seemed to settle down. Joe Thornton and Pavelski both scored to give San Jose a 2-1 lead at the end of the first period. \nPaul Martin won a battle for a loose puck along the wall and chipped it into the neutral zone. Thornton picked it up from there and on a 3-on-1, beat Kings goalie Jonathan Quick with a wrist shot high to the blocker side with 10:17 to go in the opening period. \nPavelski then picked up his first of the season. Just six seconds after Shore got a two-minute penalty for closing his hand on the puck, Pavelski tipped a shot from the point by Burns with 4:08 to go in the first period. \nJones was arguably the Sharks' best player in the preseason, posting a 3-1 record with a 0.76 goals against average and a 97.0 save percentage. He wasn't tested much in the second period until he made a late sliding stop on a shot by Tyler Toffoli, who was right on the doorstep. \nRaffi Torres will not appeal the 41-game suspension handed to him earlier this week. According to Bob McKenzie of TSN in Canada, Torres has decided to accept the nearly record setting suspension he was given Monday for an illegal hit to the head of Anaheim's Jakob Silfverberg. Torres will not be eligible to return to the NHL until Jan. 14, 2016, when the Sharks host the Edmonton Oilers. Torres will forfeit $440,860.29 of his salary this year. \nWith his appearance in Wednesday's game, Sharks defenseman Marc-Edouard Vlasic tied Mike Rathje for most games played with San Jose by a defenseman in team history with 671. Vlasic is 28. Rathje had just turned 30 when he played his last game for the Sharks in 2004 in the Western Conference finals. Vlasic had two assists Wednesday. \nThe Sharks signed defenseman Cavan Fitzgerald to an entry level contract. Fitzgerald, 19, is in his second full season with the Halifax Mooseheads of the Quebec Major Junior League. He is teammates with Timo Meier, the Sharks' first-round draft pick in June.
