Williams was carted off in the fourth quarter in last week's loss to Cincinnati with a left knee injury. \nOnline: \nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T16:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:39:46.093+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
