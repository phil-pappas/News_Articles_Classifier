Those living at higher altitudes will also receive wood stoves and solar lamps.\nMattias Bryneson, Plan International’s Country Director in Nepal, says: “While progress has been made to meet the immediate priorities of families, many still need earthquake-resistant homes and protection during the winter season.\n“Children tend to be more vulnerable in severe weather and are at risk of winter-related illnesses. So we must act fast to ensure they are protected during the freezing temperatures and are still able to go to school,” adds Mr Bryneson.\nAs part of the new project, thousands of families will be educated about the importance of building safe insulated shelters that will withstand the winter, as well as future disasters.\n Plan will also be raising awareness about child protection and preventing violence against women and girls, which often increases during emergencies.\nTanya Barron, Chief Executive of Plan International UK, was in the Nepal when the earthquake struck on April 25th.\n“The earthquake was a devastating and terrifying event that has had a huge impact on the people of Nepal. Six months on, there is still much to do.\n“This grant from the Department of International Development will make a huge difference to families in Dolakha over the winter period.\n“The key element of this project is that the community itself will be involved in its implementation.\n“We will be targeting the most vulnerable families, and ensuring that their specific needs and challenges are fully taken into account.\n“This is a vital part of our work, enabling us to support communities in the most effective way possible,” she adds.\nFather-of-three Chitra, 33, who has been trained in carpentry by Plan, says: “I want to ensure that everyone in my community gets a new home. I will advise people on how to insulate their homes to keep them warm during the winter months.”\nSince the April earthquake, Plan International has helped 255,000 people in Nepal, 107,000 of them children.\nThe charity has provided emergency shelter kits, food and water and sanitation facilities as well as ensuring thousands of children have safe spaces to play and learn.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T21:23:16.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
