If Indiana could score 52 on Rutgers, what’s one more TD for J.T. and his pals?\n  * * * * *\n\n\nBill Rabinowitz \nOSU Beat Writer\nThe Columbus Dispatch\nOhio State 52, Rutgers 21\n\nWith J.T. Barrett running the show, the offense has looked smoother. If the Buckeyes defense can cut down on big plays, this should be a comfortable win.\n * * * * *\n\nDom Tiberi \nSports Anchor\nWBNS-10TV\nOhio State 49, Rutgers 14 \n\nJ.T. Barrett has been given the keys to the car and he is going to drive it up and down the field. Rutgers has a nice offense, but Joey Bosa and company are licking their chops.\n * * * * *\n\nStanley Jackson \nAnalyst for BTB and WTVN-AM\nFormer OSU quarterback\nOhio State 56, Rutgers 21   \n\nWith the captain — quarterback J.T. Barrett — back at the helm, the Buckeyes’ offensive machine, sputtering at times this season, shifts into full gear.\n  * * * * *\n\nMario Batali \nCelebrity chef\n1982 Rutgers graduate\n\nOhio State 42, Rutgers 10  \nAs a Rutgers grad I’m pragmatic, well-informed and very attentive to social trends. Also, sadly, I’m realistic in my business expectations.\n \n  * * * * *\nHere are some other predictions from our staff:\n>>  Rob Dewolf, BuckeyeXtra editor \nOhio State 62, Rutgers 14 : Buckeye Nation gets the rout it has been thirsting for since Jan. 13.\n\n>>  Bob Hunter, Dispatch sports columnist \nOhio State 51, Rutgers 24 : Barrett start good for Buckeyes, bad for Rutgers.\n\n>>  Todd Jones, Dispatch college football writer \nOhio State 38, Rutgers 20 : The switch to J.T. Barrett makes sense because he’s a better fit for an OSU offense that doesn’t have a deep receiving threat. Look for the Buckeyes to take another step toward the real season that begins Nov. 21.\n\n>>   Rob Oller, Dispatch sports columnist \nOhio State 52, Rutgers 7 : The old QB switcheroo works wonders, and just in time because the College Football Playoff committee is watching.  #stylepoints\n\n>>  Ray Stein, Dispatch sports editor \nOhio State 52, Rutgers 21 : With J.T.
