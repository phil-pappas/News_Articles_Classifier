The varsity football game capped off Purple Week and it was tied with a bow. Ionia took down Fowlerville, holding them until the final seconds of the game. Students rushed the field as the Bulldogs captured their second win of the season and first in the CAAC White this season, by winning, 20-16 over the Gladiators. “We still have a lot of belief in our kids and our kids believe a lot in themselves,” said Ionia head coach Mike Holes. “We had a couple bounces go the wrong way early, we still feel like we’re a really good football team. Our kids believed until the end in a close game. If you don’t believe, you’re not going to win.” It was really a game of defense for both teams in a low scoring affair. Ionia was the first to get on the board. With 4:35 left in the first quarter, a short drive thanks in part to a couple of passes gave Ionia the lead. Quarterback Mitchell Lahr found wide receiver Martin Gale down the left side for a 33-yard 79-yard touchdown reception. The Bulldogs took a 6-0 lead on the missed PAT. They held Fowlerville to just eight first downs in the first half. Ionia took an 12-0 lead after Lahr found wide receiver Josh Malgey on the right side of the end zone for an 11-yard touchdown reception with 10:12 left in the first half. The two-point conversion was no good on a Lahr keep, allowing Fowlerville to keep the score within striking distance. Fowlerville took advantage of an interception by Lahr midway through the second quarter. They got the ball near the seven-yard line of Ionia and punched it in on a quarterback keep. The PAT was good to bring it to 12-7 for an Ionia lead with 7:48 left in the first half. That’s how the first half would end as Ionia nearly took up the rest of the half on their drive. They were just five yards short of extending that lead in the dying seconds of the first half. “Our kids fought it through and made some plays when they needed to,” said Holes. The third quarter would go scoreless for both teams and Ionia was hungry to finish out this game with a victory. On their firs drive of the fourth quarter, they ran the clock down over five minutes on the drive. Lahr found wide receiver John McCord in the end zone, wide open for a 21-yard touchdown reception. Lahr then found Gale wide open on the right side of the end zone for the two-point conversion and a 20-7 lead with 4:25 remaining. Page 2 of 2 - Ionia nearly had the win in their laps but on the ensuing drive, the first play from scrimmage for Fowlerville was a double reverse flea flicker that went for a touchdown with the PAT good. Now a 20-14 lead, Ionia knew it was now or never if they were going to win. With 4:05 to play, they ran the ball on almost every play to whittle the clock down to just 14.2 seconds. On 4th down and 6 from their own 35, they called a timeout, trying to figure out how to punt the ball, that’s when defensive coordinator Jason Griffith came up with an idea. “Coach Griffith had the decision to run out of the end zone on the game winning play basically for us,” said Holes. “Anything can happen on a punt, anything can happen if they have the ball at midfield. He made a great decision, he said this is the time to take a safety.” That’s exactly what Lahr did. He scrambled behind his own line of scrimmage before running out the end zone with 3.2 seconds to play. Now up 20-16, Ionia had to make two more plays. With 1.5 left on the clock after the kick, Fowlerville went for it all. They heaved it downfield, for a catch, but the receiver was quickly tackled and time expired. The Bulldogs rushed the field, celebrating the hard-fought victory. “Any time guys make great calls and ideas like that, they deserve all the credit and that was a big play for us, it won the game,” said Holes. Holes was proud of the way his team performed and how the community showed up in support. “We had fireworks, we had the balloon pop at the beginning, we won the game, we probably raised a lot of money that stays within our community,” said Holes. “The jersey presentation to the people that they’re in honor of, it’s a great event for everyone in the community. Proud to be here and proud to be part of the game.” Andrew Fox led with five tackles on defense and had 17 rushes for 49-yards. Lahr had 21 carries for 60-yards. Cam Sanicki also had two tacks on defense and an interception. Ionia will host Lansing Waverly next Friday at 7 p.m. Follow Sports Editor Chris Zadorozny on Twitter @ZadsISS.
