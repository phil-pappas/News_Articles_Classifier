Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed hope that \"by turning the world U.N. blue for a day, we can light a way to a better tomorrow.\"\nOct. 24 is the anniversary of the entry into force of the U.N. Charter in 1945 and is celebrated as U.N. Day.\nThe General Assembly unanimously approved a declaration Friday reaffirming the faith of the 193 member states in the United Nations on its 70th anniversary and the U.N.'s determination \"to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war.\"\nIt says the U.N. charter unites all member states \"in diversity beyond our differences of language, culture or religion, today as 70 years ago.\"\nThe secretary-general told the assembly that the U.N. over seven decades has brought \"freedom to millions, dismantling colonialism, defeating apartheid and defending human rights for all, regardless of race, religion, nationality, gender or sexual orientation.\"\nBut he said \"violence, poverty, ill-health and abuse plague far too many people, especially women and girls,\" and more people have fled their homes than at any time since World War II because of conflict, oppression and fear.\nNonetheless, Ban said, \"without the United Nations, our world would be a far bleaker place.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:20:17.343+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
