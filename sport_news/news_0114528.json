Megan Hatfield started the offensive show with a smashed shot to the upper 90 in just the 8th minute of play for the early advantage. \nSix different Lady Lions scored on the afternoon including two freshmen in Alora McCoy with a score in the 13th minute and Sarah Weber with a goal in the 51st minute. For McCoy, the goal was her second in as many games as she also scored in yesterday's 4-1 win over LaGrange. \nPiedmont scored three goals in each half as Tori Gillett scored just before 28 minutes gone on perhaps one of the best goals all season after several combinations right at the top of the box. Cassidy Reich added to her season totals now at 14 with a penalty kick in the 71st before defender Haley Hall capped the scoring with a right-footed shot over the head of the Berea keeper in the 74th to put the final score at 6-nil. \nSenior Michaela Gardner kept the shutout in goal playing the full 90 for yet another clean sheet, her 12th such performance of the season.
