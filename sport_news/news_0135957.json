(Photo: David Guralnick, Detroit News) \nMichigan's defense has posted gaudy numbers, but so has upcoming Big Ten opponent, Northwestern.\nThey face each other on Saturday at Michigan Stadium, the Wildcats unbeaten and coming off a shutout of Minnesota, while the Wolverines (4-1) are coming off back-to-back shutouts of BYU and Maryland. Michigan beat Maryland, 28-0 on Saturday, and for the second straight week allowed the offense a mere 105 yards.\nNorthwestern, which climbed into the polls earlier this season with valuable wins over Stanford and Duke, also have two shutouts this season, including a 41-0 win over Eastern Illinois.\nDefense is about attitude, and Michigan linebacker Desmond Morgan said the Wolverines have advertised what they want theirs to be.\n\"I definitely think there's an attitude,\" senior linebacker Desmond Morgan, who had one interception, nine tackles and two pass breakups said after the game. \"We want to be that D (that is) kind of nasty and mean and known for stopping the run and making big plays. So we're trying to put some of those big plays on top of each other week after week.\"\nMichigan remains second nationally in total defense, yielding an average of 184 yards a game, trailing Boston College (140.0). Northwestern is fifth nationally, allowing 247.4 yards a game.\nThe Wildcats are ranked No. 1 nationally in scoring defense, allowing an average of 7.0 points per game, while Michigan is No. 2 at 7.6. They're also the top two teams in third-down percentage defense, with the Wolverines ranked first. Where they differ significantly is rush defense. Michigan is ranked fifth, allowing an average of 71.4 yards a game, while the Wildcats are 26th, allowing 117.4.\nFor Michigan, which entered the Coaches' poll on Sunday at No. 21 and is ranked 18th in the AP Poll, the season has been about relying on its stifling defense.\nAgainst Maryland, the Wolverines forced 12 three-and-outs, and that included possessions after each of the offense's three turnovers. Michigan had three interceptions, held the Terps to 29 rushing yards and 1-of-18 on third down and also had three sacks.\nSince the first quarter of the Oregon State game the second week of the season, Michigan has allowed one touchdown. The Wolverines have outscored opponents 119-7 in their last 15 quarters.\nMorgan said the Michigan defensive players have become finely tuned and are settling in five games into the season. They understand their assignments and adjustments.\n\"(There's an) overall comfort with one another, communication that's going on on the field, guys knowing where one guy's going to be out on a play versus another formation, so it's guys being able to adjust and play off one another,\" Morgan said. \"As we get more comfortable with each other, the better we'll play and the faster we'll play.\"\nMichigan's offense, which snapped out of the first-half funk in large part because of the contributions of tailback Drake Johnson, is benefitting from the play of the defense.\nThe offensive players say they are feeding off their defensive counterparts.\nDETROIT NEWS\nSecond-ranked UM defense playing at 'extremely high level'\n\"It's always an energy boost to see them playing as well as they did,\" Michigan tight end Jake Butt said. \"Going off that too, it's been an advantage for us to get to go against them all camp. We're going against one of the best defenses in the country, battling them the whole month of August, so it doesn't get harder that. So when we're out there playing different teams, it's a little bit easier than it is when we're playing our defense.\n\"We made some mistakes that could have been game-changers, but our defense stepped up and made plays. It's great for us knowing we have one of the best defenses in the country that if we mess up, it's going to be OK. There's no panic button, because we have guys making plays. It's a real big advantage for us.\"\nMichigan hasn't had back-to-back shutouts since the 2000 season and must go back to 1980 for the last time the program registered three straight.\n\"That's what we strive for in practice is perfection,\" said Maurice Hurst, who had one sack and two tackles for loss against Maryland. \"Obviously, we weren't perfect. We have things to work on so we can come out next week and play better. We had a couple plays they got first downs â€“ they shouldn't have anything.\"\nHurst said the ability to rotate players, particularly on the defensive line, has kept the players fresh.\n\"(We are) fighting to get on the field and when we get on the field we really get after it,\" he said.\nMichigan hasn't allowed a touchdown since the fourth quarter against UNLV on Sept. 19.\n\"I think our team is playing Michigan football, and we need to build on it, of course, and get better,\" Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said. \"I think we can play better. I think there's still a higher level.\"\n\nachengelis@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/chengelis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:13:31.043+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
