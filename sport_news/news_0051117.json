It plans distribute Ferrari stock to its shareholders next year. \nThe remaining 10 percent belongs to the Ferrari family. \nThe IPO, even in what has become a dodgy market with doubts about the economic recovery seeping into the minds of investors, raised more than $893 million this week. \nA number of companies in recent weeks have canceled IPO, fearing the market malaise. \nBut investors clamored for a piece of one of the world's premier automakers, erasing doubts about the allure of holding its stock. \nLess than an hour after trading began, had risen 9 percent to $56.88. \nFiat Chrysler is offering nearly a 10 percent stake in Ferrari and giving underwriters a 30-day option to buy up to an additional 1.7 million shares. If fully exercised, Ferrari will have raised $982.4 million. \nFerrari reported a net profit of 265 million euros (currently $300 million) last year, up 7 percent from the previous year. Its net revenues have grown by 7 percent annually from 2005 to 2014. The company also has an extensive range of branded fashion items as well as a Ferrari World theme park in Abu Dhabi, with another set to open in Barcelona. \nAll content copyright Â©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:32:25.590+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
