But he's already one of the Tigers' best on-ball defenders and he's kept constant pressure on the defense this preseason with his ability to blow by his man, draw in help and quickly find the open man.\nMemphis has two or three other point guard options ahead of Martin at this point in senior Kedren Johnson, senior Ricky Tarrant and sophomore Markel Crawford. But Martin, who averaged 19.8 points, 5.3 rebounds and 4.8 assists while earning Class A Mr. Basketball and state-tournament MVP honors last year, could move up the depth chart quickly with Johnson's playing status this season still in question due to a shoulder injury and Tarrant's knee also a question mark following surgery at Alabama last season.\n\"He's improving. He admitted to me he's never played this position. So we're teaching him on the fly and he's getting better,\" Pastner said of Martin. \"He gets himself in trouble when his mind is racing. Mentally he's just gotta slow down. His motor's revved up, but mentally he's gotta slow down.\n\"I've been saying from the beginning he's gonna be a fan favorite because of his motor, how hard he plays and he comes from a winning background.\"\nPastner shortening rotation earlier\nPastner said that he plans to play his entire roster in the Tigers' closed scrimmage against Georgia Tech in Nashville on Oct. 31.\nBut he'll use the scrimmage this year to help make a determination on a rotation. Last season, Pastner continued to play all of his players through the team's exhibition game against Division 2 Christian Brothers, which it lost 74-70 in overtime. It was Memphis' first exhibition loss since the 1996-97 season.\nPastner won't play everyone this time in the Tigers' Nov. 6 exhibition game against LeMoyne-Owen — their lone exhibition before opening the regular season Nov. 14 against Southern Miss at FedExForum.\n\"Very early on I'm going to set the tone of the rotation,\" Pastner said. \"That doesn't mean it's set for the rest of the year. Someone can move out of it or someone can move in it. That just means that's where we are at that point with LeMoyne-Owen.\"\nInjury updates\nPastner said he expects senior forward Shaq Goodwin (ankle) to return to practice Thursday.\nGoodwin was held out of Tuesday's practice as a precaution, but he was able to dunk the ball in drills. Freshman guard Randall Broddie also sat out Tuesday's practice with a knee injury. The players were off Wednesday.\nJohnson (shoulder) continues to practice with the team in non-contact drills and is listed as day-to-day. It remains unclear whether Johnson will choose to undergo potential season-ending shoulder surgery or attempt to play through the pain.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T00:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:26:32.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
