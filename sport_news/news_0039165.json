Center Jason Kelce placed the blame for the offensive woes squarely on the offensive line.\n\"Our offense struggles to move the ball when we don't do our job, and that's been the thing from the (expletive) beginning of the season,\" Kelce said, according to CSNPhilly.com. \"That's been exactly what stalled out our offense from the beginning all the way through these first four games. And right now we don't run the ball when we need to, we don't pass block when we need to, and it's a disgrace right now .\"\nThe Eagles experienced myriad problems in the first half of their 23-20 loss at Washington Sunday. They couldn't consistently sustain a drive and end the half with zero points.\nThe group found a rhythm in the second half and actually gained a 20-16 lead. However, the inability to move the ball on the ground prevented the Eagles from running time off the clock. They had a three-and-out on their drive before a punt. Washington produced a 90-yard drive for the game-winning touchdown.\nRunning backs DeMarco Murray, Ryan Mathews and Darren Sproles never were able to get anything going. Those three rushed for a combined 73 yards on 17 carries in the game.\n\"Sometimes we look great,\" left tackle Jason Peters said. \"Sometimes we look like we don't know what we're doing.\"\n-- Geoffrey C.
