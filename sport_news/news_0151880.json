The assailants, four in number, said nothing as they fired at Paswal before vanishing into the dark. Paswal, in his mid-30s, however, survived the attack. He was admitted to a Srinagar hospital where he was treated for nearly a year. “For the initial two years we were given assurances that we will be given powers and those two years were wasted with it,” said Paswal, sarpanch of a Shopian village for the past four years now. Paswal now walks only short distances and that too with a limp, a reminder of the threat faced by village representatives in the Kashmir region. “The government offices are either not responding to the suggestions of panchayats or not working in coordination with them,” said Paswal, who has lost hope of witnessing any change in the system. Like Paswal, many village-level representatives in the Kashmir region have struggled over the past years to survive the threat of militants, some even fleeing their homes and living in hiding, and yet continuing their battle against the government apathy. The PDP-BJP government in its ‘Agenda of Alliance’ had included the promise to ensure powers to the panchayats and decentralisation of decision making. However, there is no update on the progress made so far. The landmark panchayat poll, then celebrated as a victory of democracy, was held in 16 phases between April and June 2011 and witnessed election of 4,130 sarpanches and 29,719 panches in the state. The election, however, pushed hundreds of these men and few women to a dangerous fault line where they found themselves sandwiched between powerlessness and a fatal threat from militants. Panchayats in most villages have been overseeing the works carried out under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act and the Indira Awaas Yojana. Ghulam Nabi Khanday, a sarpanch from the Keller block of Shopian district, said there was some progress in 2012 and 2013 but that was lost in the aftermath of flood as the state government struggled with rehabilitation. Khanday and several other sarpanches, who were interviewed by The Tribune, said the only cooperation to panchayats had been extended by the Rural Development Department and, with some varying degree, by the Agriculture Department. “The government only makes hollow promises,” Khanday said. He said a sarpanch of a neigbouring village, Mohammad Sultan, was killed by militants last year and another village’s sarpanch, Paswal, survived the fatal attack. “Sultan’s wife had to move from one office to another just like beggars. The government paid no attention to his family,” said Khanday. Gulzar Ahmad Beigh, sarpanch of Badran village in central Kashmir’s Budgam district, was among the protesting village representatives, who had flocked to Srinagar to plead their innocence after a spate of attacks on their colleagues in 2012, when nearly a thousand of them advertised their resignation through newspapers and in mosques. “The basis on which the panchayat election was held, the three-tier system, has not been implemented. It is not even two-tier,” said Beigh. “Some departments were to coordinate with panchayats, but except for the Rural Development Department no one has shown any willingness,” he said. Beigh said the consent and advice of panchayats had not been sought by most of the departments while planning or initiating works in villages. When asked about the relevance of panchayats today, Beigh said: “As of now, there is none.” “However, there is accountability now. It has been a benefit of panchayats,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:03:13.026+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
