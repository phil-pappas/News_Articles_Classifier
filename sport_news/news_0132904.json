Autumn is the time to get outdoors in the Lake of the Ozarks region. Temperatures are more moderate. Ticks and mosquitoes are starting to die away. Itâ€™s a beautiful time to get out in the woods and on the water. For a more remote, back-to-nature experience, head to the Lead Mine Conservation Area/State Forest in northeast Dallas County near the boundary with Camden and Laclede counties - about 40 miles south of Lake of the Ozarks. The largely forested area also contains savanna, glades and old fields. Jakes Creek runs through part of the 7,761-acre property owned by the Missouri Department of Conservation. It also fronts a two-mile stretch of the Niangua River. Facilities include boat ramps, an unmanned firearms range, fishable ponds, several intermittent streams and springs in addition to the Niangua River. Portions of Jakes Creek through the conservation area are also a permanent stream. Enjoy expansive views of the Niangua River hills from open glades above Jakes Creek valley. A specially-designated natural area within the conservation land features dolomite glades, chert woodlands, fens, headwater streams and forests. The best way to see the area is one of its multiple hiking trails, though you may also want to bring a kayak for a little float on the Niangua during warmer afternoon temperatures. Six trails through the conservation area range in challenge from easy to difficult and in length from 0.5 and 2.5 miles to 5.7 and 8.6 miles. On the trail, keep your eyes peeled. A number of bird species utilize the restored glades and woodlands including the prairie warbler, blue-winged warbler, blue-gray gnatcatcher, eastern wood-pewee, summer tanager and white-eyed vireo.
