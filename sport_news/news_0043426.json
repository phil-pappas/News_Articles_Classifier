Harvey misses Mets' workout, apologizes after late arrival Associated Press | 0 comments \nNEW YORK (AP) â€” Matt Harvey is off to a horrendous start in his first postseason. \nThe star pitcher missed a mandatory New York Mets workout Tuesday at Citi Field and apologized to the team for arriving late. Harvey did not give a reason for his absence when he spoke to reporters about 15 minutes after practice ended. He did not take questions, either. \n\"I just screwed up,\" Harvey said. \nMets manager Terry Collins told reporters Harvey called and said he got stuck in traffic. Later, Collins told Newsday and the New York Post that when Harvey showed up, he said he had lost track of time. \nWhatever the reason, captain David Wright definitely sounded annoyed. \n\"It's about the guys that are here. And the guys that are here, we had a great workout,\" Wright said. \"So you will have to talk to Matt about that.\" \nNew York opens its NL playoff series against the Dodgers on Friday night in Los Angeles. Collins told reporters Harvey will be fined but remains scheduled to start Game 3 at Citi Field next Monday. \nHarvey was not on the field as the Mets went through drills from around noon to 2 p.m. General manager Sandy Alderson initially said he didn't know why Harvey was absent. \n\"Obviously, today was not the greatest. I know we had a mandatory workout. And the last thing I ever want to do is not be here for my team,\" Harvey said. \"Basically, there's no excuse. I screwed up. I wasn't here. I showed up a little late.\" \nHarvey's agent, Scott Boras, also was in the dark at first. He told The Associated Press by phone he wasn't sure why his client wasn't at the workout. \n\"I've talked to Sandy and I've talked to Terry and my teammates and apologized to them and apologized to everybody,\" Harvey said, wearing sweats and a Mets cap while seated in front of a microphone. \n\"They understand I'm here to get my workout in and be with the team. Unfortunately today, I screwed up. So there's not really anything else to say. They know what happened and I told everybody and apologized to everybody, told them it's not going to happen again. It's never happened before and unfortunately it happened kind of at a bad time.\" \nHarvey's time in New York has been anything but drama-free. \nThe right-hander was panned last month during a ruckus over his workload on the mound in his first season back from Tommy John surgery. He finished 13-8 with a 2.71 ERA in 29 starts and 189 1-3 innings, surpassing the 180-inning limit Boras said doctors recommended. \nIn other news Tuesday, rookie left-hander Steven Matz had a successful bullpen session and is headed to Florida to pitch a simulated game Thursday in the instructional league. The plan is for him to throw 90-95 pitches, Alderson said. \nMatz (4-0) has been sidelined since late September because of a balky back that tightened up. If healthy and sharp enough, he could start Game 4 in the best-of-five Division Series against the Dodgers. Or, he might be a bullpen option. \n\"He threw very well today,\" Alderson said. \"Based on how he does in Florida, we'll make a decision as to whether he's on the roster, and if so at least a tentative decision on what role he will have with us in the Division Series.\" \n\"I think we've been encouraged over the last couple of days,\" the GM added. \"Things have improved. So certainly today is a step forward.\" \nA decision on Matz might not be announced until Friday morning, when rosters are due. The team plans to carry 14 position players and 11 pitchers, Alderson said, and the NL East champions will bring an extra player to Los Angeles as insurance for Matz because of his uncertain status. \n\"It's going to be a game-day call I think,\" Alderson said. \nAs for reserve infielder Juan Uribe, he won't be available in the Division Series but hasn't been ruled out if the Mets advance to the next round, Alderson said. \nUribe hasn't played since Sept. 25 because of a chest cartilage injury. He will remain in New York this week and continue to work with therapists. \nAnd with the Mets ramping up to face Dodgers aces Clayton Kershaw and Zack Greinke, two of baseball's best pitchers, slugger Yoenis Cespedes said his bruised fingers are fine after he was hit by a pitch last week. \n\"I am 100 percent ready to start this battle,\" Cespedes said through a translator. \n___ \nAP Baseball Writer Ronald Blum contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T01:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:33:13.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
