Friday night, Durango High School was swept 3-0 (25-21, 25-16, 25-23) by Grand Junction. Saturday afternoon, the Demons faced No. 11 Montrose and came out on the short end of a 3-1 final (25-18, 25-19, 22,25, 25-16). “We’re only halfway through the season so we have to keep focusing on the positives, and the girls are in good spirits,” Durango head coach Colleen Vogt said. “It’ll be good to get back home, and it’s homecoming week so hopefully that will give us some added motivation and we’ll be able to feed off of that energy.” Vogt did not provide any statistics for the two matches. The Demons will try to get back to their winning ways at 6 p.m. Friday against Grand Junction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T11:53:25.934+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
