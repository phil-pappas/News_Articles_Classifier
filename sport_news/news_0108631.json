Not surprisingly, the teams needed overtime to decide who stayed perfect and who finally changed the number in their loss column. \nA 20-yard field goal by Middle Creek kicker, Jared Shea, lifted the Mustangs to a 17-14 win over the Bengals of Fuquay-Varina Friday night at Bengal Stadium. \nShea who suffered a concussion and a broken collarbone from playing pick-up basketball weeks ago, kept Middle Creek unbeaten in a return the senior kicker will never forget. \n“I tried to keep calm like it was a normal PAT,” said Shea on his game winning kick. “It was definitely a little bit nerve-racking because if I missed it, there would be another series and that would of been pretty scary.” \nMiddle Creek opened up the scoring on the first drive of the game off a Darian Fogg touchdown run from three yards out, but the Mustangs would have trouble getting their offense going after that. After a three and out from Fuquay, Middle Creek quarterback, Dominique Shoffner was intercepted by Fuqua’s Trey Thornton which sparked the Bengals on a drive ended by a one year keeper by Brycen Braswell to tie the game. \nThat’s how the first half would end after Braswell and again Shoffner would exchange interceptions. That wouldn't be it for the Mustangs when it came to turnovers because they would put it on the ground twice in the third quarter. The Mustangs defense, who only lets up 14 points a game this season, was stout once again in this one as they kept the Bengal running game in check for the most part. \nThe Bengal offensive trio led by Braswell, Josh Arrington and Colten Smith were averaging over 300 yards on the ground going into this game. They did not reach that mark tonight rushing for around 230 yards. \nArrington punched in a one yard touchdown with just under six minutes left to go in the fourth quarter for Fuquay, but it was the Mustangs senior receiver, Johnathan Spencer, who broke a quick screen for a 55 yard touchdown to strike back for Middle Creek on the next drive. \nFuquay ran the clock and lined up for a 33 yard field goal to win it with two seconds left, but it was just short and to overtime they went. Fuquay's first possession didn't go well as Fuquay kicker, David Henson tried to redeem himself, this time from 30 yards out, but it went wide right. The Mustangs then ran it three times and Jared Shea did the rest. Middle Creek coach Randy Ragland, who was celebrated by Fuquay-Varina high school at halftime for his time as the Bengals quarterback in 1985 who played in the 2A state championship. This clearly win meant a lot to him and to his football team. \n“This win wasn't special just for me, but for this entire football team. The character that they showed after turnovers and not being able to get the football from them shows a lot”, said coach Ragland. \n“This was a well played high school football game on both sides, two different contrasts of football and this is huge for playoff seeding. Looking at a eight or nine seed now we are potentially looking at a one seed, so I am extremely proud of this football team tonight.” \nMiddle Creek now 9-0 (5-0) finishes the season with two home games against Green Hope and Cary while Fuquay-Varina falls to 8-1 (4-1) and finishes their regular season on the road at Panther Creek and Cary. \nCopyright 2015 by Capitol Broadcasting Company.
