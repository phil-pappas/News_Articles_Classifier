In other words, Michigan was either tied or leading for the entire 60 minutes of game clock in a contest it lost. \nCall it the Gift Six. Call it Fail to the Victors. Call it one of the wildest endings to a college football game you'll ever seen in one of the wildest off-the-field weeks during a regular season the sport has encountered. We'll talk about this play forever, just as we remember Stanford-Cal with the band out on the field and the Kick Six at Alabama-Auburn. Just when you think college football has already devised the most painful ways to lose, the sport dials up another one. \nDid you expect anything less in a week when Steve Spurrier watched a football game in Ann Arbor, instead of coaching one in South Carolina? \n“You're thinking it's done,” Spartans coach Mark Dantonio said of the finish, “then life is flipped upside down.” \nLeading 23-21, Michigan needed to simply get off a punt with 10 seconds left and then probably defend one more play. If the Wolverines did that, Jim Harbaugh would be the first Michigan coach since 1948 to beat Michigan State in his debut. If they did that, the Big Ten championship would have to go through Ann Arbor. If they did that, Michigan would be in the top 10 next week, considered a playoff contender, and be ridiculously ahead of schedule in Harbaugh's first year. \nPoor O'Neill, the Michigan punter. He's a native of Australia and, until now, was probably the most unrecognizable graduate transfer in a year of high-profile grad transfers. A year ago for Weber State, O'Neill ranked sixth in punting among all Football Championship Subdivision players. On Saturday, he had performed well with an 80-yard punt -- yes, 80 yards! -- and pinned three punts inside the 20. \nPressure can get to anyone. With Michigan sending all 11 players for a block, O'Neill flat-out dropped the snap. Then while swarmed by Michigan State defenders, he compounded the error by trying to pick up the ball and punt it. The ball landed in the arms of Watts-Jackson, who outran Michigan's pursuing defenders 38 yards and scored as time expired. (This is a good time for my recurring question: Why don't college football staffs have kicking and punting coaches? ) \nAdding to the utter chaos of the play: Watts-Jackson got carted off the field after the game. Dantonio said he likely dislocated his hip on the winning touchdown and was taken to the hospital. “What the hell just happened?” Michigan State quarterback Connor Cook asked on a television interview. Best answer: Shoulder shrug. \nLet's be clear: Michigan had this game won dead to rights. These teams are very evenly matched. That was best evidenced by the terrific battle all day between Michigan cornerback Jourdan Lewis and Michigan State wide receiver Aaron Burbridge. Lewis won some; Burbridge won some. \nBut Michigan had this . Cook made tremendous throws while passing for 328 yards, but there's only so much he could do. The Spartans' leaky and battered offensive line plus some key drops by receivers limited Cook to 18-of-39 passing. Michigan appeared to win the game by forcing three consecutive incompletions and sacking Cook with 1:47 left. Michigan defensive tackle Willie Henry made two sacks and got a key quarterback pressure against Cook on the Spartans' final drive. \nInstead, Michigan State has won seven of eight games over Michigan, an unprecedented stretch in series history. Instead, Dantonio joins national championship winner Duffy Daugherty as the only Michigan State coaches with victories over three different Michigan coaches. Instead, somehow, someway, the Spartans are 7-0 and 3-0 in the Big Ten and still in the College Football Playoff hunt. \n“Yeah, I'm a little numb,” Dantonio told reporters. “A good numb, like putting ice on it.” \nIt was that kind of week. \nSteve Sarkisian reportedly showed up drunk to practice and lost his job, joining Randy Edsall, Dan McCarney and Spurrier in the unemployment line. Florida quarterback Will Grier was suspended for a year after a positive drug test. Boise State turned over the ball seven times in one half. Oklahoma endured an eight-hour flight delay to Manhattan, Kan., and handed Kansas State's Bill Snyder his worst loss (55-0) in his illustrious career. Two Texas A&M quarterbacks threw three pick-sixes and totaled 207 interception yards (third most in SEC history), nearly tossing more interception yards to Alabama than passing yards to teammates. Michigan linebacker Joe Bolden got blocked into a quarterback and found himself ejected for targeting. Stanford wide receiver Francis Owusu made an improbable, blind catch off a UCLA defender's back. \nSo yeah, we're all a little numb now. \nLeave it to the Mad Hatter, Les Miles, to pull a fake field-goal touchdown out of his hat to provide normalcy in this mad, mad world. Miles taught math while explaining to ESPN his go-ahead touchdown to beat Florida. \n“We had it, and it was an opportunity to get seven,” Miles said, “and seven is a whole lot more than three.” \nThis is true. Still, in a week that played out like this one, someone might want to confirm. \nMichigan State came up with the most unthinkable touchdown to win in the Big House. (USATSI) \nWhat We Learned This Week \n1. SEC West depth took another hit. Lost in the crazy Michigan-Michigan State finish was Memphis' huge win over Ole Miss. More on the Memphis angle in a minute. But first, can we finally acknowledge the SEC West depth top to bottom isn't what it used to be? Ole Miss lost at Memphis. Arkansas lost at home to Toledo. Auburn barely beat Jacksonville State in overtime at home. Texas A&M still looks like a fraud as a national title contender after getting blasted by Alabama 41-23. Toledo and Memphis are good teams so those aren't cupcake losses, and there's no shame in losing to Alabama. But the narrative that the SEC West is incredibly tough to navigate took a huge blow last bowl season and is getting shot down again. There are some fine teams in the SEC West. Alabama or LSU may end up being in the playoff or possibly win the national title. But if the SEC has a one- or two-loss conference champion, there's no given that team will be in the playoff. I tend to think a one-loss champion will get in, but a lot will depend on the rest of the country. The SEC won't get the benefit of the doubt anymore. \n2. Justin Fuente is going to get paid. The bad news, Memphis fans: You're going to lose your head coach soon. After upsetting Ole Miss, Fuente has won 16 games in the past two years at Memphis, which won a total of 13 games from 2009 to 2013. Memphis won its first game over a ranked opponent since knocking off Peyton Manning and Tennessee in 1996. The good news, Memphis fans: Your team (which inexplicably isn't ranked yet) is well-positioned for the Group of Five bowl. At this rate, the American Athletic Conference (Memphis, Houston or Temple) or Toledo are the frontrunners to get a New Year's Day bowl. Memphis will be helped by beating a team that beat Alabama. Don't write in Memphis to a major bowl just yet, though. The Tigers have this three-week stretch from Nov. 7-21: vs. Navy, at Houston, at Temple. But imagine the interesting playoff debate if Memphis finishes undefeated with a win over the team that beat Alabama. \n3. Stanford-Northwestern may be 2015's Ohio State-Virginia Tech. Remember when the Buckeyes lost to Virginia Tech in their 2014 national championship season and got counted out? That was Stanford after its 16-6 loss to Northwestern in Week 1. As ugly as Stanford was that day, it has been as impressive since then while averaging 45 points a game in the past five weeks. Christian McCaffrey, who ran for a school-record 243 yards and four touchdowns, has burst onto the Heisman Trophy scene. Meanwhile, Northwestern has been outscored 78-10 against Michigan and Iowa in the past two weeks, mirroring how the Hokies collapsed in 2014 as the season went on after the Ohio State win. In the playoff era, it's all about improving as the year goes on since the committee has shown it will reward teams that get better. No one is getting better than Stanford. \n4. Don't forget about Derrick Henry. In this year of the running back, it's easy to forget about Alabama's Henry. That would be a mistake. Lane Kiffin finally just fed Henry the ball time after time after time. Even without injured center Ryan Kelly, Henry ran for a career-high 236 yards on 32 carries and scored twice. Just like last year, Texas A&M's defense was overmatched against Alabama's running game. In nine career games as a starter, Henry has rushed for 1,103 yards and 14 touchdowns while averaging 6.2 yards a carry. Looming on Nov. 7 is LSU at Alabama when Leonard Fournette and Henry compete on the same field. \n5. LSU and Florida passed QB tests. The big question for LSU: Can Harris hit throws downfield when needed? On Saturday, Harris produced a rare 200-yard passing game by completing 13 of 19 for 202 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions. If Harris consistently performs like that, LSU is a legitimate national championship contender. There will be more tests with road games against Alabama and Ole Miss and a home finale against Texas A&M. Meanwhile, the Gators learned they can still win the Big Ten West -- er, SEC East -- with Treon Harris at quarterback. The Gators showed up well in a 35-28 loss. Harris was 17 of 31 for 271 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions, although he looked overwhelmed on the final drives while trailing. Even without Will Grier, the East remains Florida's to win if it beats Georgia in two weeks. \nStat of the Day, Part I \nBoise State had more turnovers in one half (seven) against Utah State than 35 teams had all season entering the week. That includes Boise State, which entered Friday with six turnovers all season. Eight turnovers by the Broncos in their loss to Utah State dropped Boise's national turnover margin ranking from fifth to 112th. \nStat of the Day, Part II \nFlorida State running back Dalvin Cook's 10 touchdown runs this season have come by an average of 42.1 yards. While continuing to fight a bad hamstring, Cook added a 54-yard touchdown run Saturday in Florida State's 41-21 win over Louisville. Cook may be the best running back not named Leonard Fournette. The undefeated Seminoles would have a couple losses without him. \nStat of the Day, Part III \nBaylor's Corey Coleman set the school-single season touchdown reception record. It's Oct. 17. Coleman caught three more touchdowns in Baylor's 62-38 win over West Virginia, giving him a nation-leading 16 midway through the season. Coleman is “the best player in college football,” West Virginia coach Dana Holgorsen said. “You can put me on record for that.” \nSign of the Times \nRemember David Sills? Sure, you do. He was the 13-year-old quarterback who committed to play quarterback for Lane Kiffin at USC five years ago. The non-binding commitment drew national consternation about how silly early recruiting has become. Sills' really, really long recruitment ended when he became a West Virginia quarterback. On Saturday, Sills burned his redshirt season … as a wide receiver! Sills caught two passes for 64 yards against Baylor, including a nifty, over-the-shoulder, 35-yard touchdown. So apparently, Sills is the next Kevin White. Just like everyone thought. \nScore of the Day \nIowa 40, Northwestern 10. The Hawkeyes now have the clear lead in the Big Ten West race while improving to 7-0 overall. Given a very favorable schedules for the Hawkeyes, it's entirely possible they could be 12-0 going into the Big Ten Championship Game. Iowa plays in the Big Ten's weaker division and drew Maryland and Indiana as cross-division opponents this season. Still left for Iowa: Maryland, at Indiana, Minnesota, Purdue, at Nebraska. The toughest of those teams (Indiana) just lost 25-point, third-quarter lead at home in a 55-52 loss to Rutgers. \nWhat Was He Thinking, Part I? \nIt's understandable why Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze plays defensive lineman Robert Nkemdiche, the potential No. 1 NFL draft pick, on offense. He's a really large human being and a freak of nature, meaning he can help the Rebels as a short-yardage fullback and occasional pass-catcher. Let's not be revisionists here. Almost every sportswriter loved the risk-reward idea of Nkemdiche playing offense. The gamble backfired Saturday when Nkemdiche took a handoff and got his head slammed onto the field. Nkemdiche left with a concussion. The Rebels' defense wasn't the same after he left. “He just got tackled on his head,” Freeze told reporters. “That could happen on any play. I don't think you can operate out of fear of getting somebody injured if it helps your football team. True. Still, it's probably time to end the experiment with Nkemdiche on offense. \nWhat Was He Thinking, Part II? \nWe now know players can be ejected for targeting by getting blocked into a fallen quarterback. Look, I am all for the targeting call to keep the game safer. It's a good rule in theory. But how Big Ten replay official Tom Kissinger didn't overturn a targeting call on Michigan's Joe Bolden is beyond me. Michigan State offensive lineman Jack Conklin finished his block, as he's taught to do, and pushed Bolden into Spartans quarterback Connor Cook, who was on the ground. If you're Bolden, how do you stop that from happening? The mistaken call meant Bolden, the Wolverines' leading tackler, was out for the game. College football needs to figure out how to consistently handle replay decisions with targeting. \nQuote of the Week \n“Michigan beat my statue, but they couldn't beat the MSU Football team! LOL #GoGreen #GoWhite” -- Michigan State legend Magic Johnson on Twitter after the Spartans' stunning win over Michigan. \nEarlier in the week, Johnson's statue in East Lansing was vandalized by Michigan fans. \nFollow and read more from Jon Solomon on Facebook and Twitter .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:01:07.284+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
