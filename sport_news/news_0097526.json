The Clemson Tigers played host to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets at Memorial Stadium in Clemson Saturday, October 10, 2015. ¬ GWINN DAVIS / FOR POST AND COURIER CLEMSON – So much of this offseason discussions surrounding Clemson football involved the health, growth and potential of quarterback Deshaun Watson. Nearly at the half point of the 2015 season, Watson is healthy, growing and potentially going to improve from a solid yet unspectacular first five games of his sophomore year. It’s not that Watson is slumping, but he’s not quite fulfilling the Heisman-like expectations set for him this summer. However, Clemson brandishes five victories, the No. 5 ranking and as imaginably clear a path to the College Football Playoff as their could be because of some old-school qualities: a consistent running game and a ferocious defense. “That speaks to the core of what we want to do,” Clemson head coach Dabo Swinney said. “We always want to be able to play great defense, and we wanted to run the ball effectively. It creates a lot of explosive plays when people try to stop the run.” The first three quarters against Notre Dame, and throughout Saturday’s 43-24 win over Georgia Tech, Clemson controlled the pace on offense and defense with the work of its “big uglies” up front. “I think it’s a part of any really good football team, having a good line of scrimmage on both sides,” defensive coordinator Brent Venables said. “When you need to impose your will and that’s not a weakness, usually you can translate winning and losing with that.” Tailback Wayne Gallman has given Clemson its first runner to record 100 yards on the ground in three straight games in a decade. His 107.2 yards per game rank second in the ACC, trailing only Florida State’s Dalvin Cook, who’s become a Heisman contender. Venables’ defense has been the story of the season, losing eight starters – many of whom now play on Sundays or serve on NFL practice squads – and reloading to the tune of the No. 13-rated total defense in the country. First quarters have been flex-worthy for Clemson’s defense – its five opponents have amassed 140 yards eight first downs in all five first quarters combined. Foes have also scored just six points in the first quarter – both were field goals on drives that began in Clemson territory. The Tigers rank in the top ten nationally in first downs allowed, 10-yard plays allowed, tackles for loss and third-down defense. “Even if we don’t end up No. 1 in most of those categories,” junior safety Jayron Kearse said, “we know we have a good defense.” The Tigers are fresh off responsibility for Georgia Tech’s lowest rushing total – 71 yards – of the 100-game Paul Johnson era. “If you like defensive football, you could sit there and rewind the tape and watch it all day. It was just spectacular,” Swinney said. “Good defense never goes in a slump. It’s always there, and if you show up and play great defense, you always got a chance.” Venables has taken great pride in the Tigers’ defensive line reinforcements – Kevin Dodd and Shaq Lawson on the ends, Carlos Watkins, Scott Pagano and Christian Wilkins at tackle, a group with two combined starts to their names entering 2015. “They want to be something,” Venables said. “Nobody respects what took place a year ago more than that group, but I respect their willingness to learn from them, watch, pay attention, and put their own flavor on it this year.” If the Tigers’ defense has their sights set on the No. 1 total defense ranking, just like it finished last year, this Saturday’s a good place to start. Boston College (3-3, 0-3 ACC) has the No. 119 offense, a chance for the Tigers to decrease its yardage total. And, the Golden Eagles themselves are the No. 1 defense, so Gallman, Watson and the Tigers’ offense could do their part to help its counterpart. BC is already installed as an underdog of more than two touchdowns. “Some games have a little more juice than others as far as the media,” Swinney said. “But for us coaches and us players, we all understand the margin for error is so small, and you don’t get mulligans. We think we can beat anybody, but we can beaten by anybody.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:43:45.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
