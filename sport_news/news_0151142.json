Two years later Cairns, 45, brought a libel action against Modi and successfully sued for £1.4million ($2.14 milion).\nBut prosecutor Sasha Wass told London’s Southwark Crown Court on Wednesday that Cairns’ co-accused, Andrew Fitch-Holland, a lawyer and his “lead adviser”, approached teammate, Lou Vincent, to get him to lie during the libel action.\nVincent not only knew Cairns had fixed matches, but was involved in match-fixing himself under the direct orders of Cairns, Wass said. Wass said there was evidence to prove Cairns had been involved in match-fixing and had lied about it under oath.\nThe jury were also told that Vincent was once threatened with a cricket bat by Cairns after scoring too many runs in a fixed game, telling his then wife Eleanor Riley he had “lost Chris Cairns $250,000.”\nThe court also heard that Cairns had even attempted to recruit current New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum, saying he could get between $70,000 and $180,000 dollars per match to throw games while playing in the ICL in 2008.\nCairns first approached McCullum in a hotel when he was playing for the Calcutta Knightriders, giving him an in-depth explanation of how spread-betting worked, Wass said.\nThey then later met up in a cafe in Worcester, where a touring New Zealand team were playing against the county side.\n“At that meeting Brendon McCullum says Cairns approached him and asked him whether he had changed his mind,” Wass told the jury. “He said no he hadn’t. McCullum didn’t report Cairns at the time.\nCairns is charged with perjury and perverting the course of justice. Fitch-Holland is accused of perverting the course of justice. They deny the charges.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:35:37.817+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
