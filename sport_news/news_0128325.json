Will this be his biggest game as a head coach to date?\nFuente shrugged.\n\"It's the next game for us,\" he said. \"Our kids will be excited to play.\"\nThere's no ignoring the hype surrounding Saturday's nationally televised game at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium, the latest installment of a local rivalry between two schools separated by only 73 miles. Memphis and Ole Miss share recruiting turf. Only 10 spots separate them in the latest Amway Coaches Poll. This is the game that Memphis fans have long circled on their calendars. The city is abuzz.\nThat excitement should result in a near-capacity crowd, but it will also create a challenge for the undefeated Tigers. This week, more than most, they will need to insulate themselves from the hullabaloo leading up to game day.\n\"The vibe is out there. Everybody knows about this game. It's a big game,\" senior linebacker Wynton McManis said. \"But we've worked so hard to keep our focus on going 1-0, because it's gotten us to where we are now. We just try to keep going 1-0.\"\nOn Monday morning, students lined up outside the Memphis ticket office before sunrise for a chance to purchase student guest tickets at $25 apiece. The allotment was sold out before noon. That excitement will follow players across campus and throughout classes this week.\n\"We just try to focus on what we can control,\" backup tight end Daniel Montiel said. \"We can't control if students come â€” they're outside waiting for tickets and they're excited for this game. The city's excited for this game. But we're just trying to focus on this game, the next play.\"\nMemphis has won 12 consecutive games spanning a calendar year, most recently a 24-17 victory over South Florida on Oct. 2. But in that game, and the two preceding it, the Tigers needed a second-half rally to win.\nFuente said Monday that he would like to see the team start faster. One component of that, he said, is finding a balance between excitement and control.\n\"Part of our challenge is we've got to play a little more under control early in the game. I don't feel like we've done a good job of that,\" Fuente said. \"We've got to calm it down a little bit. And I know our kids will be excited, and I know it will be a great atmosphere and all those things. But we've got to understand that we can play with some great emotion, but we've got to play with some great intelligence, too.\"\nFuente understands the excitement surrounding this game. He was outside the ticket office Monday morning, handing out Gibson's doughnuts and chatting with students who were waiting in line. However, he is also determined to keep this one game in perspective. It is just one piece of the larger picture.\n\"It counts as one non-conference win or loss. And anything more than that is a little much for us right now,\" he said. \"The bottom line is when the game's over, six days later we've got to be ready to play at Tulsa, regardless of what happens. That does not mean we're not going to gear up and prepare and do everything we can to be ready Saturday. But it's one game in a 12-game season.\"\nTiger Insider: The Memphis City Council, in conjunction with the city and university, announced that it plans to dedicate a portion of Tiger Lane in honor of former Memphis linebacker John Bramlett. Street signs recognizing \"John 'Bull' Bramlett Lane\" will be unveiled in a ceremony Saturday morning at 8:45, at the corner of Tiger Lane and Early Maxwell Boulevard.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:01:04.748+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
