Modi said the Centre would launch Gold Monetisation Scheme, Sovereign Gold Bonds and gold coins of five gm and 10 gm denominations with Ashok Chakra inscribed on them on the eve of Diwali. He said the government would also do away with the system of interviews for appointments with group D, C and B category (non-gazetted) Central Government posts from January 1, next year. Modi said gold-related schemes would give impetus to the country's economy, besides ensuring subscribers with assured dividends on their gold assets. \"In our country gold has, in a way, become part of social life. Gold is considered to be a medium of economic security. Gold is considered to be the key during critical times…I do not think anyone can reduce attachment towards gold. But it does not behove to store gold as dead-money in today's times. Gold can become powerful…,\" Modi said. Under the scheme, banks will give monetary interest on the market value of gold deposited with it. Interviews for recruitment at lower levels in governments, he said, were a source of corruption. \"The government has completed the entire process to do away with interviews for lower rank jobs. There will be no requirement of interview for Group D, C and B non-gazetted posts in Centre. It will come into effect from January 1, 2016,\" Modi said. Announcement kicks up row\nNarendra Modi's no-interview announcement drew accusations of violation of the model code for elections and attempts at putting an end to the reservation policy. Bihar's anti-BJP grand alliance alleged that Modi's announcement would also lead to \"effective implementation\" of RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat's call for a review of quotas. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:08:01.605+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
