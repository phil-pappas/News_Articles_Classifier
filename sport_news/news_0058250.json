Johnson finished with six catches for 77 yards.\nThe Colts (3-2) extended their AFC South winning streak to an NFL-record 16 games.\nBrian Hoyer, who replaced Ryan Mallett for Houston (1-4) in the second quarter, threw a pass up for grabs that was intercepted by Mike Adams with less than 2 minutes left.\nThe 40-year-old Hasselbeck was filling in for Andrew Luck, who missed his second straight game with a shoulder injury. Hasselbeck may not have been 100 percent either, after missing practice Tuesday with an illness.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
