Receiving e-mails is definitely a highlight for this outdoor columnist. While I can never know what might be coming from any of my 67 semi-regular readers, I am almost guaranteed a smile and an antidote or two. When there is a question included, the day just gets brighter for me. One question came from “a long time reader” asking about a strangely colored deer she and a friend observed while on their way into work. It had a lot of white on its rear end, and mostly brown on its other end, a rather strange color pattern for a wild deer. Whitetail deer that exhibit this kind of color pattern, most often with various amounts of white showing where brown is normally seen, are generally referred to as “pie-bald.” And, while most people, including many dedicated deer hunters, have never actually seen one, there are actually a lot of pie-bald deer in the population at any given time. The amount of white can also vary widely. I have seen deer with a white spot on their side, sort of like a “bulls-eye” (which was a pretty unfair joke for nature to play on them if you ask me). And I have seen all-white deer with just some brown on their heads, and often just around the base of a buck’s antlers or the topmost scalp of does. I remember one doe that had brown ears, a brown stripe down the top of her neck and middle of her back, and all the rest of her hair was pure white. She was a wild deer, and since I observed her for five hunting seasons in a row, and never heard of any hunter harvesting her, I have to assume she finally died of old age. Since there is nothing good or bad about pie-bald coloration in the whitetail deer gene pool, there is no biological reason for a hunter not to harvest one if he sees it during the regular season and he has an unfilled tag. While such oddly-colored deer are somewhat unique, I believe we humans are more curious than concerned about them. Another reader asked what rifle calibers were legal for deer in New York. My response was that, while all center-fire calibers were legal for use during New York’s deer season in rifle-legal areas, not all center-fire cartridges were ethical for such use. There are some calibers and specific cartridges that I feel should not be used on these fine game animals. Specifically I believe that no .22 caliber cartridge should be used. Most bullets in this caliber are designed for varmint hunting, and have thin metal skins. They are designed to fragment instantly upon impact with anything. Their use on deer could result in a severe wound and a lost animal. Rifles chambered for certain other cartridges should also be left home. The .30 caliber carbine cartridge is one. The .38 Special cartridge is another. Neither has enough energy, especially over 50 yards or greater, to be absolutely effective on whitetail deer. So, what cartridges would I recommend? The .243 Winchester cartridge with 100 grain bullets would be my smallest caliber personal choice. The green light also goes to any of the traditional .25 to .30 caliber bottleneck deer cartridges. And certain straight-walled cartridges such as the .44 Magnum and .444 Marlin are also satisfactory as long as the hunter maintains strict limits on the maximum distance he will shoot at a deer. Another reader asked how it was possible to tell the age of a deer just by looking at it. Actually it is not possible to accurately tell the age of a deer strictly by sight. What is important is for every hunter to be able to tell the difference between an adult doe and a fawn of the year. Adult does have muzzles that are noticeably longer that fawns from the previous spring. Once enough deer have been observed it is no problem for anyone to tell the relative age (adult or fawn) at a glance. Don’t rely on body size alone because, unless you have two deer standing next to each other, the body size factor by itself is not reliable. Hunters should attempt to take adult does when they fill their Deer Management Permits. An adult doe is far more likely to have multiple births (two or three fawns) the next spring while a yearling doe will most likely have a single fawn, so taking a mature doe will aid in good wildlife management more than taking fawns. Keep in mind that a certain proportion of fawns will be “button” bucks. By not taking these youngsters the hunter may be increasing his chances of seeing an adult buck in future years. Having more mature bucks in a well-regulated deer population is always a good thing. * * * Now for a tale of another outdoor dummy. In Wilmington, Delaware, police received an anonymous tip about a dead white-tailed deer on a front porch in nearby New Castle County that prompted them to visit the house. They observed the animal, on the front porch, and thought it was “odd.” So they questioned Jeremy W. Nacchio, 24, the homeowner. And they eventually got a full confession from this dummy when his story kept changing. They charged him with hunting without a license, illegally hunting on Sunday, trespassing to hunt, possession of unlawfully taken antlered deer, transporting unlawfully taken antlered deer, harvesting antlered deer without purchasing an antlered deer tag, failure to tag an antlered deer and failure to check an antlered deer within 24 hours. Nacchio pled guilty and was ordered to pay $2,800 in fines, including court costs. He also had his hunting privileges revoked for three years. So why did he leave a very dead and very illegal deer in plain view on his front porch? He was tired after all that very hard and very illegal work. And verily, another outdoor dummy bites the dust.
