They returned in the fall of 2012, wound up in the Eastern Conference finals, but fell to LeBron James ’ Miami Heat.\nSo where will this month’s trip to Milan and Madrid lead them?\n“It can be a great experience,” coach Brad Stevens said before the team’s first practice abroad yesterday. “Only if we can balance this new thing of being away from home with the awareness that we’re only 24-25 days away from the start of our season. We need to have productive days in the gym; these sessions are really important to get something accomplished in practice. I will address that to the team, because if we don’t understand what’s coming from a challenge perspective, we’re in trouble.”\nFor Stevens, the trip might offer a lesson or two.\n“From my perspective, as a guy who loves basketball and enjoys the game, to get the chance to watch teams from other countries play, study the systems they run, and then watch their coaches, their style, I think I will try to steal something to use it later on,” he said. “That’s the fun part to me.\n“I enjoy watching a lot of international basketball anyway, so to have the chance to play against Olimpia Milano and Real Madrid is a treat and a great challenge.”\nHe generally likes what he sees.\nStevens says he likes the spacing and pace of the international game, the emphasis on team and ball movement.\n“There’s not a lot I don’t like (about international basketball),” he said. “I love the spacing. I love the emphasis on team. I love the way the ball moves. I love the pace of the game. I’m a huge international basketball fan. When I coached in the World University Games in China in 2011 with the United States, my most prized possession coming back was a 23-minute tape of plays that I still use, that I still look at, that I sent to a couple of buddies.” “You know, that’s what coaches do. You study, and for me that was incredible. I was the assistant coach (to Purdue coach Matt Painter), so I just had to scout all the other teams to find out how Russia played, how Finland played, and those were great teaching moments.”\nLee leads early\nThe Celtics didn’t have to wait long to see David Lee ’s leadership skills in action. The newl acquired veteran power forward invited all his teammates out to Il Tavolino — a nice restaurant not far from the team hotel — for a players-only dinner on their first night.\n“It’s the nice part of a trip like this,” Lee said. “Nobody brought their families or friends, it’s just us over here, so little things like this one are very important as a way to come together as a team.”\nLee said he values his role from watching the leadership skills of past teammates.\n“When I was a rookie in this league I looked up to veterans like Antonio Davis — that old man — and Malik Rose ,” Lee said. “I want to be that figure here in Boston. . . . I don’t think a lot of young players want to have somebody give them hour-long speeches nowadays; they want to see a veteran go out there and get the job done on the court, being a good teammate and a professional.”\nItalian memories\nCutting his teeth in the Italian League for two seasons before making the leap to the NBA, Jonas Jerebko doesn’t have great memories of the Celtics’ opponents on this trip.\n“When I played for Angelico Biella (a small town in between Milan and Turin) in my second season, we reached the league semifinals, and we faced Olimpia Milano in a best-of-five series, losing 3-1. Had we beaten them, we’d have played for the championship against eventual champion, Montepaschi Siena.”\nJerebko said that last year’s playoff appearance has made the Celtics want more.\n“We got better from last year, when we only spent two months really together,” Jerebko said. “We added strength with David, Amir ( Johnson ) and the rookie. We ended last season on a high note and we just want to keep building from that.” . . .\nSome Italian reporters asked Stevens about Gigi Datome , who played 18 games for the Celtics last season after a trade-deadline deal with the Pistons. Datome is playing in Turkey this season.\n“Oh, I love Gigi,” Stevens said. “He texted me yesterday, as soon as we arrived in Italy. He’s a great guy, a great teammate. He did a good job for us and I think he’ll do great with Fenerbahce.\n“To me, he’s definitely an NBA player, he could be on a team right now, but he got a good opportunity in Turkey and he’s excited about it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T01:31:38.813+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
