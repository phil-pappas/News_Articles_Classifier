You want to avoid REM sleep on game day because it kind of takes your body down and then you have to recharge the entire thing. We let them get off their feet, we want them to relax, but we let them sleep in and we wake them up a little bit later so that they're ready to go.\" \nNaps are part of the routine for many NBA and NHL players because teams in those sports play mostly night games and travel more often. With only one game per week, the schedule in football is more regimented. \nRutgers practices in the morning, typically from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. After noon, players \"become students and go back on campus,\" Flood said. \nFlood said the team has an itinerary for every possible start time — 12 p.m., 3:30 p.m., 7 p.m. or 8 p.m. \n\"You just back up from the kickoff time and you go from there,\" Flood said. \nPLUS: Rutgers receiver Leonte Carroo questionable for Ohio State game \nRutgers always has its pregame meal 3.5 hours before kickoff and arrives at the stadium an hour after the meal. With much more time to fill today than next week when Rutgers' game at Wisconsin kicks off at 11 a.m. local time, Flood explained the team's pregame routine. \n\"We'll go to the team hotel (on Friday night), we'll get up Saturday morning, we'll have breakfast, we'll have some meetings, we will then come over to the bubble and we'll have a little run-through, head back, the players will get a little bit of free time to just kind of gather themselves, and then it's pregame meal and you're into the entire pregame routine,\" Flood said. \"Like anything else, I think if there's a routine in place, the players know what to expect and they know how to prepare.\" \nFlood isn't superstitious, but he has one staple in his pregame routine. \n\"My routine is pretty consistent: 90 minutes before the team breakfast, I run,\" Flood said. \"Then I just go through the day with the team.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:34:56.413+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
