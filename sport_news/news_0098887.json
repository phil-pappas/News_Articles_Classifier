Photo courtesy of Stacey Titter \nAfter Santa Clarita Christian’s 34-24 win over The Webb Schools of Claremont on Saturday night, SCCS head coach Garrick Moss said the victory was the school’s biggest since 2011, when it jumped from 8-man to 11-man football. \nAnd it looks like he was right. \nFor the first time since joining 11-man, the Cardinals have broken into the CIF-Southern Section top 10 rankings — they’re tied for the No. 10 spot of the East Valley Division. \nLast week, SCCS was on the brink of top 10 honors, being listed under the “others” category. But with Saturday night’s San Joaquin League victory over then-No.8 ranked Webb, the Cardinals were able to secure a spot. \nSCCS sits tied on the list with, of all teams, Webb, which beat the Cardinals 55-28 in 2014. But the Gauls aren’t the only team the Cardinals are acquainted with in the rankings. Also in the Top 10 is conference foe Saddleback Valley Christian, which is ranked fifth at 7-0. \nSCCS is scheduled to travel to Saddleback on Oct. 30. \nThe Cardinals’ presence in the CIF Top 10 shouldn’t be a surprise, especially being in an ever-tough conference like the San Joaquin League. \nAnd although SCCS has been putting up strong offensive numbers (2,491 yards passing, 574 yards rushing, 45 offensive touchdowns and scoring 325 total points) its defense has been setting the bar. \n“Our defense has been the key this year, in every game,” Moss said Saturday night after moving to 2-0 in league and 6-1 overall. “We were able to cause fumbles, turnovers. That was the difference in the game.” \nAnd that has been the difference this season. \nThe Cardinals’ defense has intercepted 12 passes and recovered 11 fumbles, causing eight of those. They have 13 sacks on opposing quarterbacks, generating 113 sack yards lost. \nBrody DeRevere leads the defense with 76 total tackles. Behind DeRevere is Logan Eagle with 60 tackles, Tommy Shields with 46 and Riley Pettee with 40. \nThe defense has been regularly getting the ball back to the offense — and in good field position. \nAs was the case against Webb. The SCCS defense was able to pick off Webb quarterback Wyatt Albert four times, and it caused two fumbles. \nTyler Kalinske’s second interception of the night helped seal the win for SCCS late in the fourth quarter. \nThe defense led to a balanced offense as freshman Seth Yu ran for a 55-yard touchdown up the left sideline with one minute left in the game to put the Cardinals up 34-24. \nYu, who got a majority of the carries for SCCS, led the ground game with 114 yards on 12 carries. Quarterback Tristan Miller went 26-for-39 with 301 yards, three touchdowns and four interceptions. \n“Offensively, we still have so much we can do better, which is amazing,” Moss said. “We’re winning games because our defense is holding us in the games, and our offense is doing just enough.” \nWest Ranch 11, Santa Clarita Hockey Club 0 \nThe Santa Clarita Valley saw history on Saturday night at the Ice Station Valencia, as West Ranch played the Santa Clarita Hockey Club for the first time in the Los Angeles Kings High School Hockey League. \nThe game was all West Ranch from the first period, as the Wildcats came out pressuring SCHC in a packed house for both team’s first game in the SCV. \n“It was a really exciting evening,” said West Ranch head coach Chris LeCornu. “There is nothing more exciting than playing in a packed arena. We want this to grow into something great. There is great community support.” \nJackson Vercellono and Tristan Warr both had hat tricks for the Wildcats. \nVercellono scored the first two goals of the game in the first period, one short handed, and added an assist on the night. \nWarr tallied five points on the night adding two assists for West Ranch. \n“Tristan and Jackson are just absolutely two of the most talented players I’ve seen,” LeCornu said. “Every time they step on the ice, nothing is holding them back.” \nMichael Onda, Tyler Amaya, Bailey Prouty all put the puck in the back of the net, while Ethan Wolthers added two goals. \nWest Ranch improves to 2-1 on the season and is in third place in the eight-team league. \nGoalie Adam Rousselo stood out for Santa Clarita. He saved 39 shots in the net for a save percentage of .780. \nSCHC is still in search of its first win of the season as the loss drops them to 0-3. \n“What (SCHC) suffers from is not enough kids,” LeCornu said. “We were fortunate to have a large group of kids right out of the gate. They’re still trying to develop that momentum, but the coaches are extremely dedicated and those kids will grow a lot in the years to come.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:10:30.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
