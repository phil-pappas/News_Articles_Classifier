Now Alexander is being accused of using a fictitious persona to found a professional basketball league, AmeriLeague, which was scheduled to conduct its draft today in Las Vegas.\nThese latest revelations concerning Alexander, who allegedly has been portraying himself for several months as \"Cerruti Brown,\" were brought to light Wednesday by ESPN's Outside The Lines .\nAccording to the Outside the Lines report, \"Brown\" admitted yesterday to AmeriLeague operations manager Marcus Bass that he was in fact Glendon Alexander. Bass said Alexander told him to inform AmeriLeague staff members that he was stepping away and that there would be new ownership.\nAs of today, the AmeriLeague website is not functioning and the immediate futures of staff members and numerous players who have committed to play in the league are in doubt. Those players include Royce White, the 16th pick of the 2012 NBA draft.\nFormer Texas A&M standout Antoine Wright is also in the league. Wright played professionally with the Mavericks for two seasons, playing 15 games in 2007-08 and 65 in 2008-09.\nAmeriLeague organizers had been portraying the league as an alternative to the NBA's D-League, which is scheduled to conduct its draft on Saturday. \"Brown,\" or rather Alexander, had been touting that the AmeriLeague had investors, but shortly after its founding the league's commissioner and president both resigned.\n\"Unless he has a body double, it's definitely him,\" former league commissioner Ethan Norof told Outside the Lines on Wednesday afternoon. \"No question about it.\"\nNorof, AmeriLeague investor Brian Moore and a former league employee each identified Brown as Alexander to Outside the Lines after watching a Dallas Morning News video that accompanied our Jan. 2014 report about Alexander.\nAlexander at the time was operating ABCD Basketball Academy in Des Moines, Iowa, having relocated it from Rowlett in 2010. An ABCD player and his mother had contacted The Morning News to say that Alexander had provided substandard living arrangements, travel and training.\nIn the same News report, a Des Moines athletic complex owner said Alexander had failed to pay several months of rent for use of his facilities.\n\"I pretty much have built a machine the last couple of years where every year I'm sending two or three kids to Division I [schools],\" Alexander told The News then. \"I'm helping kids in that way.\"\nOne month after The News ' story, a Des Moines TV station reported that the landlord of one of the two homes Alexander had rented for ABCD players had filed eviction papers; and that police were investigating Alexander for writing several hot checks -- including to a church for the purchase of a van.\nIn August of 2014, The News reported that Alexander had been arrested and jailed in Collin County for violating community supervision conditions from a March 2010 conviction for fraudulent use or possession of identifying information.\nLongtime basketball fans in North Texas recall Alexander starring at Carrollton Newman Smith in the 1990s and earning McDonald's All-America honors in 1996. His 3,637 career points at Newman Smith still stand as a state record in Texas' largest enrollment classification.\nHe originally signed with Arkansas, but finished his career at Oklahoma State. It was during his time in Stillwater that he pulled a series of scams and con jobs, including stealing a scholarship check from a teammate, $46,500 from a Carrollton dentist and $150,000 in cash and jewelry from former major leaguer Derek Bell.\nAlexander in 2002 was convicted of bank and wire fraud. He spent more than three years in the Seagoville federal prison.\nOn Twitter:\n @townbrad", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/townbrad", "http://www.orangepower.com/threads/glendon-alexander.19224/", "http://espn.go.com/espn/otl/story/_/id/13944043/amerileague-founder-tells-operations-manager-persona-fake-lines"], "published": "2015-10-22T19:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:12:41.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
