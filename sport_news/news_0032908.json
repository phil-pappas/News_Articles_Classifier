There’s really no home-field advantage when you’re facing a guy like deGrom,” Kershaw said Tuesday. “We saw that in Game 1. He’s just very impressive, very tough to square up.” \nIn this win-or-go-home game tonight at Dodger Stadium, the Mets are entrusting their new ace to guide them to the NLCS against the Cubs. DeGrom already has defeated the Dodgers in this series, throwing seven scoreless innings in a Game 1 tri umph. \nThis is the Mets’ first playoff elimination game since the 2006 NLCS. \n“It’s probably the biggest game I’ve ever pitched,” deGrom said Wednesday. “I think that will be kind of in my mind, and I’ll go out there and try to put up zeros.” \nWhen the Mets aligned their rotation for this series, knowing they could match up against the Dodgers’ two aces four times, they knew one starter might have to pitch twice in the five-game set. \nAmong a staff of young, power arms, deGrom had the best season, and the team turned to him to start Game 1, and Game 5 if necessary. DeGrom, in his sophomore season, went 14-8 with a 2.54 ERA and earned a spot on the All-Star team. “I’m really confident he’s going to go out and pitch another great game,” Mets manager Terry Collins said. “He’s just got to get some runs to work with.” \nIn the first game of the series, deGrom outpitched Kershaw, allowing just five hits and striking out 13 while throwing 121 pitches. The Dodgers put him in some early jams, but he managed to make the big pitch when needed. \nDeGrom stressed that when he’s on the mound he blocks out everything but the task at hand, and the nerves dissipate. He focuses on taking it one pitch at a time, and his view on giving up a hit? “So what?” \nHe said pitching in big games — like his debut in the Subway Series last year and this year’s All-Star Game — have helped him with that mind-set. \n“Early on, my pitch count was getting up, and once I noticed that, I was trying to get quick outs and kind of trying to go away from the strikeouts,” deGrom said of his postseason debut Friday at Dodger Stadium. “I think that will be my game plan going into this game, trying to keep my pitch count low and go as deep as I can.” \nThis will be the first elimination game deGrom pitches, and most of his teammates also have never played in a do-or-die game. The Mets had a chance to close out the series Tuesday and save deGrom for Game 1 of the NLCS, but they lost to Kershaw. \nDeGrom said the team was loose on its plane ride to California on Wednesday afternoon, and they have a good attitude. Collins said the team has remained positive after failing to clinch at home, and the players are excited for the task at hand. It helps when they have the right guy on the mound. \n“This is where you want to get. You want to get to the postseason. Any time you’re down to win or lose, it’s a tough situation,” Collins said. “There’s a lot of pressure on both teams, but I’ll tell you, I’m so proud of the way our guys made it through the season. \n“This, to me, is gravy. We’re going to go out and play real, real hard.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:50:30.372+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
