He ran for 30 yards on three carries, and he completed all three of his passes for 16 yards. His only turnover came in the final two minutes, as he fumbled while fighting for extra yards near the goal line.\n\"I was a little nervous,\" said Gass, who replaced Chris Regalbuto, who last week suffered a season-ending leg injury. \"I didn’t want to make a mistake, but I tried my best and did pretty good.\"\nInterestingly, the 5-foot-9, 150-pound Gass also served as the long snapper, and was equally effective despite the wet footballs.\n\"We have had a heck of a couple of days, with guys banged up, and we had to move a ton of people around,\" Sabella said. \"It was a gut-check win for the Spartans.\"\nParamus (3-2) stretched its lead to 14-0 with 1:52 remaining in the third on a 2-yard TD run by senior running back Derek De La Cruz. He was the centerpiece of the Spartans’ attack, scoring both TDs while rushing for 114 of the team’s 191 total yards.\nParamus scored in the second quarter for a 7-0 lead after taking possession on its 8-yard line and forging an 11-play drive in which De La Cruz carried eight times and scored.\nThe Spartans’ key plays included De La Cruz’s 18-yard run – the team’s biggest gain of the half - and his 9-yard TD run at 3:40. Senior Brandon Sullivan chipped in the first of his two extra points.\nParamus’s TD drive came after it stopped Bergenfield (2-2) on a first-and-goal at the 1-yard line. The Spartans’ first stop was pivotal, as senior linebacker Christopher Voorhis tackled junior running back Carlos Macon for no gain. On second down, Macon was again tackled for no gain.\nBergenfield hurt itself on third down with a fumbled snap for a 2-yard loss, then was whistled for a false start and 5-yard penalty. That set up a fourth-and-8, and Haskins’ pass into the end zone was incomplete.\nThe Bears created the first-and-goal after Haskins, on a fourth-and-8, tossed a 34-yard completion down the middle to senior receiver Jamal Williams. That was the game’s lone gain of more than 20 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:42:38.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
