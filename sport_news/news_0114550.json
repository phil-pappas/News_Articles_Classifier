It is a bit surprising because no other decision in the tournament has been reviewed,” Cheika said. “I really feel for the ref. It is so unfair. No other referee has had his stuff put out there like that and Craig Joubert is a very good referee. \n“Genuinely I’ve never seen that before. I am not sure why that decision had to be publicly reviewed and put out there. I really hope his fellow referees stand by him.” \nJoubert awarded Australia a last-minute penalty when Scotland knocked on at a lineout and Jon Welsh caught the ball in an offside position. But television replays showed that Australian scrumhalf Nick Phipps touched the ball just before Welsh, so the Wallabies should have been awarded a scrum rather than a penalty. \nJoubert was first criticized for not referring the incident to the TV match officials but World Rugby said that under RWC rules, he was not permitted to ask for a review.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:44:06.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
