Previous Next \nRain or shine, it's time for \"Da Blitz\" where we give you a weekly rundown on the high school football games you couldn’t go to. Related \nClick here to get last night's scores and a review of the games. \nThis week, the Farrington Governors locked up the OIA Blue Division's No. 2 seed with a 21-14 win over the Campbell Sabers. \nStandout player of the night was running back Challen Fa'amatau who had 24-carries for 108-yards, all three of Farrington's touchdowns. \nGames that weren't so standout were McKinley vs. Castle and Anuenue vs. Waialua. \nMcKinley and Anuenue were forced to forfeit their scheduled games – again – due to the lack of healthy bodies to field their teams. This is the eight straight week for Na Koa at 0-9 this season. \nOn the Garden Isle, the Kapa’a Warriors had their best night with a 28-0 win over Waimea. The Warriors continue to roll in KIF, having shutout league opponents for 16 straight quarters this season. \nOn the Big Island, the Waiakea Warriors were also able to prevent their opponents from scoring in their 30-0 win over Kea'au. \nMore information will be updated as the games are being completed. \n(Remaining: Kahuku vs. Waianae, KS-Maui vs. King Kekaulike) \nMeanwhile in Idaho, something that hasn't happened in 49 years – three shutout losses by the UH football team in the same season. \nThe last time a Hawaii team was blanked three times was in 1966, losing to University of Portland, Utah State, and Air Force. UH outscored 143-to-nothing in those shutouts. \nThis year, with donuts against top-ranked Ohio State, Wisconsin, and now Boise State, points total to 121-to-none. Final score to Boise State: 55-0. \nRainbow Warriors fall to 2-3 overall, 0-1 in the Mountain West. \nNext, they return home to host San Diego State for homecoming.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T10:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T10:23:57.716+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
