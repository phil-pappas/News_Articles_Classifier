Bellingham's Annika Reiss cross the finish line first during the girls’ varsity race at the 2015 NWC Cross Country Championships on Thursday, Oct. 22, at Civic Stadium in Bellingham. Evan Abell The Bellingham Herald i BELLINGHAM \nWhatcom County’s cross country scene should get use to hearing Bellingham freshman Annika Reiss’ name. \nThose who’ve raced against her know of the Red Raiders’ standout freshman, but during the Northwest Conference Championships Reiss showed the entire league what she’s capable of. \nTrailing Nooksack Valley decorated senior Amy Jo Murphy with 200 meters left, Reiss found another gear and sped past Murphy to clinch an individual NWC title Thursday, Oct. 22, at Civic Stadium. \nAnd Reiss is hoping to make winning league titles a habit. \n“It’s special to be doing this as a freshman,” said Reiss, who won her third race this season, “and I hope to continue it all four years.” \nReiss finished the 5,000-meter run in 18 minutes, 12 seconds; Murphy finished in 18:18; Sehome’s Abby Johnson took third with a run of 18:34; Mount Baker’s Natalie Smith finished fourth with a 19:13 and Anacortes’ Heather Hanson rounded out the girls’ top five with a time of 19:18. \nReiss employed her plan of staying behind Murphy to ensure she didn’t get out too fast, and at the end she had just enough energy to pick off the Nooksack Valley standout. \n“I play soccer and so sprinting really helps me in cross country,” Reiss said. “I didn’t know if I could win, but I just tried my best and ran my best.” \nReiss offered Bellingham a major race highlight, but the championships belonged to Sehome, as the Mariners again displayed their NWC cross country monopoly. \nFive boys (Colton Johnsen, Riley Allsop, Bryce Johnson, Sam Gillman and Logan Franey) and four girls (Abby Johnson, Kate Rose, Dana Ringler and Maya Smith) finished within the top 10 in their respective races to lead Sehome to team titles in dominating fashion. \nThe Sehome boys finished with 31 points followed by Burlington-Edison (90 points), Bellingham (101), Anacortes (131) and Meridian (175). The Sehome girls captured its title with 39 points and were followed by Anacortes (69 points), Bellingham (89), Meridian (114) and Lynden Christian (129). \nAnacortes’ Dylan Holland cruised to a win in the boys’ race, leaving little drama, but Colton Johnson edged Ferndale’s Roberto Aguilera late for a second-place finish. \n“They went out really quick, so I kind of sat behind them and then I tried to catch up after the first mile,” said Johnson, who finished with a time of 15:36 — 9 seconds behind Holland. “I was just trying to catch people and get as high as a place as I could for the team.” \nAguilera took third with a time of 15:43, Allsop took fourth with a 15:56 and Anacortes’ James Parker rounded out the boys’ top five with a 16:04. \nReach Andrew Lang at andrew.lang@bellinghamherald.com.
