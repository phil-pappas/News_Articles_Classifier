He didn't look very well yesterday apparently,\" said Cook, whose team drew last week's first Test. \n\"But he's here now, for training. We'll just see. He should be fine, but we've got to be careful.\" \nEngland have the option, if they were not happy with Stokes' well-being, of selecting his fellow all-rounder Samit Patel instead as a third spin option. \nThey are likely to prefer, however, to stick with the line-up which came so close to going 1-0 up in the three-match series in Abu Dhabi. \nCook added: \"It depends how badly he has been knocked about. Five days in this heat, you need to be 100% before you start. \n\"I think he'll be fine. But we'll see how he gets on in training, and obviously make a decision tomorrow morning.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:15:58.187+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
