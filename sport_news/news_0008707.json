Watson finished 27-of-41, including touchdowns throws of 21 yards to Zac Brooks, 51 yards to Artavis Scott and 6 yards to Jordan Leggett. \nScott had 10 catches for 162 yards as Clemson put up 532 yards on an Eagles defense that was only allowing 140 a game coming in to lead the Football Bowl Subdivision. Boston College hadn't allowed so many yards since losing the Independence Bowl to Arizona State after the 2013 season. \nClemson won its school-record 14th straight game at Death Valley. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:43:08.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
