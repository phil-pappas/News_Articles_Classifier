Russell's office is projected to be 6.8 percent over budget by the end of the fiscal year.\nHunt did not pay the invoices Russell submitted in September after deeming they were promotional items. The items included plastic bags, clip-on reflectors and personal size hot/cold packs with custom imprinting with a logo identifying Russell as coroner, according to Hunt.\nKane County Board Chairman Chris Lauzen called them \"political trinkets.\"\nRussell protested those unpaid invoices as well as others for contractual services. He did agree on a resolution with the county's Judicial and Public Safety committee last week to transfer $27,000 from an administrative fund for capital projects to his operating budget. Half will be used to pay for contractual services and half for supplies. The county's Finance Committee is expected to discuss the resolution at its Oct. 28 meeting.\nPromo items Gloria Casas, The Courier-News A tote bag, reflectors and personal size hot and cold compress were purchased by Kane County Coroner Rob Russell. A tote bag, reflectors and personal size hot and cold compress were purchased by Kane County Coroner Rob Russell. (Gloria Casas, The Courier-News) He withdrew the invoices for the promotional items. Friday, Russell said he withdrew the invoices because he anticipated the Judicial and Public Safety committee would not approve them.\n\"The reason I utilized the credit card as opposed to going through the whole process is because Kane County businesses desired to get paid, and they did not deserve to get put in the middle of a political battle,\" Russell said. \"I am allowed to spend money to whatever is applicable to the office. This is part of our public awareness campaign.\"\nThe charges were made in late September and appeared on the Oct. 5 statement with the description \"men's/women's/children's uniforms/commercial cloth,\" according to an online statement the auditor's office receives.\nLauzen, who does not have a county credit card, thinks the county needs to look at its credit card policy, who has a credit card and credit limits.\n\"I think it is a hole in the system,\" Lauzen said. \"Everything else has to go through our board, but if you put it on your credit card, there are no questions.\"\nThe credit card is used for \"pretty much anything we feel we need,\" including hotel rooms, plane tickets and different things, Russell said. It is not strictly for emergencies, he said. Russell said the invoices were \"well under\" his credit card limit.\n\"I am not over budget,\" Russell said. \"If I was going over budget with this, I would deserve the criticism. In this case, this is a witch hunt.\"\nGloria Casas is a freelance reporter for The Courier-News.\nCopyright Â© 2015, Elgin Courier-News", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-562af43a/turbine/ct-ecn-kane-coroner-credit-card-st-1025-20151023", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-562af43c/turbine/ct-ctlfl-ct-ecn-russell-lauzen-st-0911-jpg-20151023"], "published": "2015-10-24T04:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T23:13:51.690+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
