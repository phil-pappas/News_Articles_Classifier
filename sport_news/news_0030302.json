Mahindra won it again in 2013, when the series was opened to Moto3, 250cc, machines.\nThe current bike Bezzecchi rode to victory is a 250cc four-stroke, as campaigned in the Moto3 World Championship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:46:28.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
