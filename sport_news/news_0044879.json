You can't grow without screwing up every now and then.\nThese are the things I tell my social media staff, as well as anyone who seeks out my social media advice. On one hand, I'm a stickler for perfection, but I always remain realistic. And when I say mistakes, I'm not necessarily talking about the kind that result in national news coverage. I'm talking about knowing right from wrong, with the ultimate goal of preventing it from happening again.\nSo here are five social media mistakes and five ways to bounce back/correct the problem.\nProblem: Not engaging your community/not responding to your community.\nSocial media never was and never will be a one-way street. You can't just promote and talk without responding to the people who are talking to you. The conversation surrounding you (personal) or your brand (business) is always going to depend on several factors, including the size of your name or company. So your flower shop could go days or weeks without interaction, but your restaurant could have some daily. That same flower shop might attract much more conversation around Valentine's Day or Mother's Day. By default, plan to respond to everyone who reaches out, whether it's a tweet, Facebook comment, Instagram tag, etc. And if you truly get into a situation where you are overwhelmed with conversation, remember that's a good problem to have. Address that if it happens.\nProblem: Cross-posting.\nDespite any previous advice you may have received, this is a social media no-no. It's easier to copy and paste a post from Twitter to Facebook or vice versa, but easier doesn't mean better. The minute your audiences learn that you are sharing the same thing in multiple places, you open the door for them to choose one and not frequent both. You never want to give a choice. You always want to provide value and a reason for people to follow you in more than one place. So, think of it as a tweet with two photos versus a full Facebook photo gallery versus a series of different photos on Instagram. And if you don't have enough content for all that, start by choosing the network where you know you have an audience.\nProblem: Poor spelling and grammar.\nI was engaged in a customer-service email thread of my own this weekend when I received a reply from a brand representative that was one sentence over two paragraphs riddled with spelling and grammar mistakes. Whether it's in an email or on a social network, remember that your responses reflect you and your brand. Someone who sends messages that are incorrect appears lazy, and lazy is a bad message to send.\nProblem: Incomplete bios/generic avatars.\nOn Twitter, people who use the default avatar, the one that looks like an egg, are called eggheads. That's not a term of endearment. Not taking a few minutes to put your brand logo or your face in an avatar is lazy (see my note about that above.) Plus, it's silly because this is a simple way for brands to get their logos front and center every time content is shared. On Facebook, you need a cover photo and a profile photo. It should fit the recommended dimensions and be of the highest quality.\nProblem: Liking your own Facebook posts.\nIt seems so minor, but it smacks of desperation, and it's not all that different from putting your own dollar in the tip jar. You are better off having zero likes for a while than one that belongs to you.\nIf any of these problems apply to you, make the fixes now. You'll improve your social media game in no time.\nWhat questions do you have about social media? Tweet them to @scottkleinberg with hashtag #SoSocial.
