Posted: Thursday, October 8, 2015 9:59 pm H.S. girls soccer: Red-hot Midd-West keeps Heartland-II lead By Chris Nagy The Daily Item DailyItem.com MIDDLEBURG — As the leaves begin to change, Midd-West coach Russ Goodling knows all too well that the mind set of his team must change. \"When it gets to this time of the year, every game is important,\" he said. \"Every time out we have to be tough and be ready. \"Every game matters as the playoffs get near.\" That’s particularly true if the opponent is the only team that defeated this season. Midd-West converted a corner kick with just 8 minutes left in the first half Thursday and made it stand to beat Lewisburg, 1-0, under the lights at Sports Booster Stadium. \"You just hate to lose a game like this on a corner kick,\" said Lewisburg coach Jose Vega. \"It was a great game. It came down to one corner kick.\" With the win, Midd-West (10-1-1, 8-1-1) stays in first place in the ultra-competitive Heartland Athletic Conference-Division II. Since losing to Lewisburg to three weeks ago, the Mustangs are 7-0-1 with a current five-game win streak. The game opened with Lewisburg (9-2-2, 7-2-2) controlling the tempo and getting a shot on goal in the first 10 minutes. But after that, the Mustangs gradually took over, winning the 50/50 balls and connecting on passes in the midfield. The goal came off an unfortunate play that gave the Mustangs a corner. A Lewisburg defender controlled the ball and appeared to be passing it back to her goalie. The ball was struck and went just past the post, giving the Mustangs a corner. Makenzi Kauffman fired the ball toward the middle of the box where Tayah Kepler, who had just checked into the game, went up uncontested and headed the ball into the net with 8:45 to play in the first half. \"It just worked out that way with Tayah checking in,\" said Goodling. \"I keep telling the girls how important the set pieces are and how important they are to our game. And once again it gave us a goal.\" \"We can do a lot better defensively than we did on that play,\" Vega said. \"We just watched the ball and allowed a girl to go up uncontested and just head it in.\" With the score 1-0 at half, Midd-West wasn’t about to let the game get away. \"We came out very strong in the second half and just kept pounding away at them,\" said Goodling. \"We put a lot of pressure on the ball and the defense played big.\" Lewisburg had two chances to tie the game in the final 14 minutes. Alison Reed’s cross found no Lewisburg feet in the box, and Olivia Reish’s shot in the final 60 seconds was saved by Brynn Markley to preserve her shutout. \n\"It just wasn’t meant to be,\" said Vega. \"The girls came to play and it was a great game. I’m proud of the way my team played.\" Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T04:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:14:48.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
