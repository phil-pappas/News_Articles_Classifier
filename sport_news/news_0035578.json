Villagers who came to the gurdwara to offer their morning prayers spotted the pages and immediately informed police. Several Sikh organisations marched towards the main intersection at Kotkapura, where they will stage a sit-in protest, after the incident. The pages are believed to be torn from a copy of the holy book stolen from a gurdwara in Burj Jawahar Singh Wala village of Faridkot on June 1. The area has been witnessing communal tensions sporadically since. Sikh religious groups have stages several protests against what they see as police’s inaction and failure to trace the culprits. Monday’s incident led to a complete shutdown of town. Radical Sikh leaders gathered at the gurdwara to discuss their next course of action. However, they refused to allow Sukhdev Singh Baath, a local leader of the SGPC to participate in the meeting, accusing him having failed in catching the person who stole the Holy Scripture. Meanwhile, police stepped up security in the town and adjoining villages, Faridkot SSP SS Mann said. Tensions gripped the town on September 25, when it woke to see handmade posters bearing insults meant for radical Sikh leaders on the walls of the gurdwara in Bargari. — TNS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:06:59.035+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
