She also dropped out of a tournament in China.\nHer suit claims the USTA, tennis' national governing body, was negligent. It seeks unspecified damages.\nBouchard says her world ranking has dropped 13 spots since the incident and she believes it is likely to continue to drop.\n  USTA spokesman Chris Widmaier says the organization does not comment on on-going litigation.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:16:07.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
