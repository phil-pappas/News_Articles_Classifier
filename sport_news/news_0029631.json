The leader, who is closely involved with the strategy and management of the BJP’s election plans, claimed the party-led NDA would win around 150 seats in the 243-member Bihar Assembly. He said the PM would address four rallies each for the third and fourth phases and five for the fifth phase on October 25, 26 and 27. “His schedule is as per plan. In the beginning, we said the PM would address 22 rallies in Bihar and we stand by the figure. He has addressed nine rallies in Bihar so far and will address 13 more,” he said. There has been speculation that the number of Modi’s rallies in Bihar has been reduced because of unfavourable ground reports and poor response. Swinging into a celebratory mode, the Congress reportedly called the cancellation of rallies a sign of the BJP’s impending defeat in the state. BJP leader Shatrughan Sinha has blamed party leaders in Bihar for “cancellation” of rallies to be addressed by the PM, who is also the BJP’s star campaigner in the Bihar elections. Sinha, who has been making veiled attacks at the party leadership, also tweeted: “A situation that led our star campaigner PM to cancel his Bihar rallies at the last minute...sending a negative message???”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:22:09.734+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
