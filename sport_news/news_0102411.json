All the pent-up aggression is coming out in this game, and there is no way the Colts — with or without Andrew Luck — can handle it. Not with a coach like Chuck Pagano, who cried his eyes out and talked about one of the biggest wins of his career after beating the lowly Titans. And what's worse, the Colts made the AFC title game last year, but didn't really take the necessary steps to improve, especially on the defensive end. Signing 75-year-old Frank Gore won't win you a Super Bowl. Or even get you there. This will be all New England, early and often. And sorry Jimmy Garoppolo fans, but Brady is in for the whole night. He ain't taking a knee. Nick Friar (3-1): Patriots 48, Colts 14 The game every Patriots fans has been waiting for since Deflategate. This is the chance to give the Rats, rather, the Colts, what’s coming to them. Bill Belichick has often been portrayed as a villainous character because of his demeanor and, well, pretty much everything else he does. Today it’s safe to say he’ll more like a mob boss. He’ll send out Tom Brady, Rob Gronkowski and Julian Edelman to show Indianapolis what happens when you try to bring down the Robert Kraft Empire. While Dion Lewis is a question mark heading into the evening, Legarrette Blount will be more than enough for New England on the ground. Indy has improved its run defense this year, but will be too worried about the pass, focusing on stopping Brady and Edelman — not Gronk, no one knows how to stop him. There have been times where the Patriots have blown out teams — like almost every game this year — but they usually take their foot of the pedal to some extent. That will not be the case tonight. The game will be over by halftime. This would have been the game TB12 returned from his four-game suspension. He’s going to take this one for himself to embarrass the NFL, Indianapolis and Roger Goodell in prime time. southcoasttoday.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:24:43.592+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
