(Photo by Derek Evans) Mario Chagolla Sr. Column Contributor CAMP VERDE - Matt Mejia Camp Verde Wrestler was nominated by the Head Coach from California Clovis High School to attend the 2015 wrestling tournament \"Journeymen Classic\" on October 4th. He was nominated for having defeated one of the Nation's top Wrestler, Justin Mejia (Clovis high School) who is no relation. Matt won two out of three matches against Justin while under the guidance of Carolyn Wester of Wrestling Prep a world champion producing Coach. My understanding is that Matt Mejia is the first Arizona competitor to be invited to participate. This prestigious tournament held in New York invites the best of the best from across the country squaring off in a preseason round-robin pool format. The winners of their respective pools are moved into the Best of the Best: This is a true battleground for wrestlers on the east coast. Four-, six-, or eight-man round-robin brackets with all decorated and accomplished opponents (three to four matches for each wrestler) National, State or New England place finishers, followed by state qualifiers, get preference. Best of the Rest: the next four, five or six best-accomplished wrestlers are paired together. Early Sunday morning Matt Mejia won his pool and moved forward to the Best of the Best. He finished the day taking second place which is absolutely awesome. Matt Mejia is one the best wrestlers this state has ever seen. He is one of the most exciting and gifted wrestlers I have ever had the privilege to coach. He wrestles 12 months a year and it has all paid off. Many believe that just because we are a Division 4 small school our skill level is beneath the higher ranked schools. Camp Verde High School Wrestling has been criticized for being \"small\" and therefore inferior in quality. In reference to our program, many have learned through trial and error competing against our stalls of thoroughbreds, that perception is patently false. \"Small\" school programs can provide quality training. Our size also allows us to provide hundreds of \"one on one\" training hours from former alumni dedicated to diverse disciplines ranging from their personal college experience; to life success skills learned along the way. These varied opportunities support the development of our wrestlers in special and valuable ways.As a member of the Three-peat State Champion Wrestling Team and one of its Captains, Matt Mejia will help lead his team to victory. Camp Verde has been blessed to have such a special gifted talent placed under our care. The off-season program is definitely the building block to what we hope will help us continue a championship season. We accomplished some great things last year just by taking the State championships, but at the same time we're not satisfied. We know we have the potential to be a four-peat team, so we want to continue to build where we left off and the off-season program is the start of that. The energy is contagious right now. Everyone is very positive and hopefully we can continue to build from that.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:36:28.050+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
