He injured the same area while being tackled in the first quarter after making an 8-yard catch on the Tigers’ second possession. He was in obvious pain before leaving the field. \nAt 6-foot-5 and 308 pounds, Gordon lining up next to the offensive line basically gave the Tigers another offensive tackle as he was the Tigers’ best blocking tight end. \n“Dillon Gordon looks like he’ll be out, I hate to say, for the rest of the season,” LSU coach Les Miles said at his press luncheon on Monday. “I can’t imagine him returning at this point.” \nLSU plans on requesting a medical red-shirt for Gordon, which would mean he could play next season, if granted. Gordon started 25 of LSU’s 26 games in 2013 and ’14 after playing in 13 games as a true freshman in 2012 out of John Curtis High. \n“Dillon may be eligible for a red-shirt,” Miles said. “It’s so sad that he basically is lost.” \nSEC HONORS NEAL, ALEXANDER: LSU picked up its eighth and ninth player of the week honors by the SEC office on Monday as defensive end Lewis Neal and offensive tackle Vadal Alexander won the SEC defensive and offensive lineman of the week awards. \nNeal, a junior from Wilson, North Carolina, made 10 tackles in the 35-28 win over Florida Saturday with three sacks and three quarterback hurries. Neal is second in the SEC in sacks this season with seven and seventh in tackles for losses with 7.5. LSU’s defense held Florida to 55 yards rushing on 31 attempts. \nAlexander, a senior from Buford, Georgia, received a 90 percent grade from LSU coaches for his efforts against Florida as he collected 13 knock-down blocks and gave up no sacks or quarterback pressures. LSU’s offense held Florida to no sacks for the first time this season. The Gators entered the game leading the SEC in sacks with 21 in six games. The Tigers gained 221 yards rushing and 202 yards passing against Florida. \nQUOTE OF THE DAY: “The place was electric. It was as good as it’s been. The fans make a difference. There’s no question that our guys play to the environment.” \n---LSU coach Les Miles on playing in Tiger Stadium against Florida Saturday.
