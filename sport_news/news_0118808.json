Miller’s talent makes it easy to forget just how big a change he made. \nThe Wayne High School graduate made the switch last summer knowing he would have little time to learn the new position. He wouldn’t have a life preserver or training wheels. If he failed, he would do so on the national stage, and Buckeye fans hungry for a second national title would cut the fifth-year senior little slack. \nAnother former quarterback on the roster, Middletown grad Jalin Marshall, spent the 2013 season on the sideline as a redshirt studying to play hybrid back. He played the 2014 season at that position and now starts at wide receiver. \nMarshall praised Miller for learning a new position on the fly. \n“It’s hard,” Marshall said. “It’s not easy going from (playing quarterback) to not touching the ball every play.” \nMarshall has helped Miller transition to H-back. \n“I told him I would do anything to help him get to that point because I’ve been through what he’s been through,” Marshall said. “I’m younger than him but I can show him what he needs to do. I’m continually coaching him up as he is with me. I’m coaching him more so with where to be at, what play to run or how to run that play. He coaches me up more with how to make people miss and make more plays. It’s a win-win situation.” \nAfter a highlight-reel performance against Virginia Tech in the season opener — 140 yards of total offense and two touchdowns — Miller’s role diminished in a four-game stretch against Hawaii, Northern Illinois, Western Michigan and Indiana. \nThe Buckeyes found a way to get Miller involved in their sixth game against Maryland. He had five catches for 79 yards and three runs for 11 yards. \nMarshall knows how frustrated Miller was by his lack of touches. \n“I think it’s that way for him every week because it’s his last season,” Marshall said. “He wants the best for us and the best for himself. He was probably a little down but he knew his time was coming and his time will continue to come.” \nNEXT GAME \nOhio State at Rutgers, 8 p.m., ABC, ESPN or ESPN2, 1410 More News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:14:19.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
