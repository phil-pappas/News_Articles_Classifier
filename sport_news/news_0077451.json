The third T20 between India and South Africa was called off last night without a ball being bowled because of a wet outfield, giving the Proteas a 2-0 series win. “I’m disappointed with the result as anybody would be. We play to win. But it’s not that it will give me sleepless nights. It has taught me a lot as well going forward into the World T20,” said Shastri. “It’s a very long season coming up. It was a great exposure for the team. We might have lost the series but I treat it as a great exposure in the lead up to the World T20,” he added. The Twenty20 series is followed by five ODIs and four Tests and Shastri believes India would be an improved side after South Africa’s 72-day long tour to India. “By the time they leave, we will be a much stronger team. We will be a much better team irrespective of the result,” he said. Cautioning South Africa ahead of the five-match ODI series, Shastri said India would be a far better side in the 50-over format. “We have had a good look in the two games and know what we can expect of the South Africans. In the One-day competition, we understand our game well. We are a far better side in the One-dayers and I expect very good contest over the next month,” he said. Shastri further said they are trying to unburden Mahendra Singh Dhoni as it is important to get the skipper back in his elements. “That will be our endeavour. We know what he can do when he starts striking. The world knows, I don’t have to say anything,” he said. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:08:43.176+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
