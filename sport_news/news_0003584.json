The Owls are tied for first in the Meadowlands with Hasbrouck Heights.\n\"This was great, this was one of the best performances we’ve had in a while,\" Curry said, \"but it’s all for naught if we don’t come out next week against Secaucus and play our ‘A’ game.\"\n\"The league title was our first goal when we got into camp this year,\" said Owls senior quarterback Evan Matthews, \"and the fact that we’re so close to accomplishing that, I think it speaks to how hard we’ve worked.\"\nMeanwhile, the chance for Becton (5-2) to grab a piece of the Meadowlands title is no longer in its hands, and it needs a home win Friday over North Arlington to remain in the hunt for a North 1, Group 1 bid.\nMatthews led Park Ridge on Friday by tossing four touchdown passes, including three to junior receiver Joshua Lewis, and also running for a score.\nPark Ridge dominated the first half and led, 20-0, gaining command with a three-touchdown second quarter against a Becton team that had held five of its first six opponents to eight points or less.\nThe Owls amassed 241 yards in the opening half and Matthews threw three TD passes in the second quarter, with the first going to senior receiver Greg Kolaros and the next two to Lewis.\nPark Ridge took a 7-0 lead at 9:29 of the second quarter when Matthews capped an 11-play, 80-yard drive by tossing an 8-yard TD pass to Kolaros.\nThe Owls extended their lead to 14-0 with 2:41 left in the half when Matthews hooked up with Lewis for a 67-yard TD.\nPark Ridge stretched the lead to 20-0 with 1:59 left in the half when Matthews threw to Lewis for a 28-yard score.\nBecton’s biggest gain was a 49-yard pass from sophomore quarterback Michael Bolwell to senior Gianni Failla that would have been a TD if not for a tackle by junior linebacker Tom Morgan. Also, the defense set up the Owls’ third score: an interception by sophomore Gabriel Robles.\n\"All aspects of the game, special teams, defense, offense, we showed up,\" Curry said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:02:22.631+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
