It was the first time in eight years the Lakers opened camp in Hawaii.\nSuperstar guard Kobe Bryant was an active participant in his first team action since recovering from a shoulder injury which ended his 2014-15 season prematurely.\n“It’s a lot of great memories here,” said Bryant, who was part of several Lakers camps on Oahu, most recently in 2007. \"It feels good. It feels strange. I remember it like it was yesterday, being here, and all my teammates that were here before, that are all now either retired or coaching, or on TV.\"\nSeveral new faces were on hand for the closed session, including center Roy Hibbert, No. 2 overall draft pick D’Angelo Russell, and guard Louis Williams. Forward Julius Randle opened his second camp with L.A. — but first since breaking his leg in the 2014-15 season opener.\n\"It's a little strange to look around and see so many young guys,\" Bryant said, \"but at the same time, you feel a great sense of responsibility to try to guide them the best as I can.\"\nForward Metta World Peace, a member of the Lakers’ 2010 championship team, recently was added to the camp roster.\nThe Lakers are coming off a 21-61 season, their worst since moving to Los Angeles.\nLos Angeles will play the Utah Jazz in exhibitions at the Sheriff on Sunday and Tuesday. Utah does not arrive in the islands until later in the week.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:00:46.845+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
