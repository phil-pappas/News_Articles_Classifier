(Julie Bennett/jbennett@al.com) (JULIE BENNETT) \nThere is something different about going home. \nThat goes for most anybody and college football players and coaches are no different. \nThere are more demands of time as friends and family ask for tickets, naturally leading to some pressure to perform with so many familiar faces in the stands. \nWith as many ties as Auburn's coaching staff, including Gus Malzahn, has to Arkansas there is more to this weekend's trip to Fayetteville than merely a football game between the Tigers and Razorbacks. \n\"Everybody does try to make something of it,\" offensive coordinator Rhett Lashlee said. \"It's where we are from and I went to school there. \n\"You always want to put your best foot forward when you go back 'home.'\" \nRELATED: The 2 friends coaching in Arkansas, Auburn rivalry \nLashlee, who played quarterback for Malzahn at nearby Shiloh Christian High School, later went to Arkansas and served as a grad assistant with the Razorbacks. Running backs coach Tim Horton and offensive line coach J.B. Grimes have also worked at Arkansas. \nMalzahn was a walk-on at Arkansas, where he served as offensive coordinator during his debut season as a college coach in 2006. Though he's downplayed each of his five trips back to Fayetteville since leaving following the 2006 season, Malzahn was keenly aware of his 0-3 record at Reynolds Razorback Stadium prior to Auburn's 35-17 win in 2013. \n\"That was a big win for us,\" Malzahn said. \"It was a big win at that time. It's a tough place to play and you've got to play well to win. We're going to have to play our best overall game to get a victory there.\" \nMalzahn is extremely proud of his roots as a high school coach and speaks fondly of his time at Hughes, Shiloh Christian and Springdale before entering the college ranks. He'll take part in a ceremony honoring his 2005 state championship team at Springdale tonight in another example of something that can only happen for Malzahn during a trip back to Northwest Arkansas. \nRELATED: Where's the beef? Why Arkansas' Bret Bielema 'hates' Auburn \nThe back-and-forth rhetoric between Malzahn and Arkansas coach Bret Bielema cooled this offseason compared to the prior two years. \nMalzahn is 2-0 against Bielema in the duel of offensive philosophies and neither side can afford to lose Saturday and fall into last place in the SEC West. \n\"They're all important,\" Malzahn said. \"SEC game, for your team, that's what you focus on.\" Auburn beat writers share Arkansas predictions Auburn beat writers Wesley Sinor, James Crepea and Brandon Marcello share their score predictions for the Arkansas game.
