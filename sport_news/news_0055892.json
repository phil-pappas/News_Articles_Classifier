Races in the pro stock and sportsman division will be held before the main race. \nEvents in the 358-modified, Empire Super Sprints, USAC and DIRTcar sportsman divisions were staged throughout Central New York at tracks like Brewerton and Weedsport Speedways. Friday’s card at Rolling Wheels Raceway in Elbridge was rained out. \nThe track will be torn down after 100 years to make way for a multi-million dollar renovation project that will replace the famous raceway with RV space, an equestrian events center and changes to the Chevy Court concert area. \nMany area racing fans have followed the exploits of local racers like Bob McCreadie and his son Tim, along with Tim Fuller and others Former Times Sports Editor John O’Donnell covered the event in its heyday and he said people loved the atmosphere. \n“It was a week to have fun,” O’Donnell said. “Some stay for the just the weekend, but the diehards are there the whole week.” \nWinning the race can change the career of drivers like it did for Watertown’s Billy Dunn when he took first in 2013. \n“It probably wasn’t as much what it did for me as much as what it meant to me,” said Dunn in 2014 to the DIRTcar website . “It’s the biggest race in DIRTcar and the biggest race since I was a kid. Hopefully I have a chance of winning it again. It is pretty special.” \nHowever, the event won’t be leaving the region as the DIRTcar circuit will head to Central New York Raceway park in the Oswego County town of Hastings. The park is currently under construction. \n“The State of New York has made a 10-year commitment to Super DIRT Week to keep the event in Central New York,” DIRTcar CEO Brian Carter said at a press even on Sept. 30 at the state fairgrounds. \nO’Donnell said the event is in good hands, but the fairgrounds will be missed. \n“The fans will miss it, but the new place should be interesting,” O’Donnell said. \nOswego Speedway is the backup venue if CNY Raceway Park is not ready for next year. \nDUNN 2ND, MCCREADIE 3RD \nJimmy Phelps held off the field on a late restart to claim the Salute the Troops 150 358-modified race at the Moody Mile. \nDunn overtook Watertown’s Tim McCreadie for second on the final lap, but could not get by Phelps in the final tuneup before the Syracuse 200. \nHogansburg’s Carey Terrance was 13th, while Watertown’s Frankie Caprara was 24th and Chris Raabe was 28th. \nDunn won one of the Twin 50 races in the 358-modified division earlier in the day.
