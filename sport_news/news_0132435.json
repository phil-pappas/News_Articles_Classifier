Coach: Roy Williams. \nConference: Atlantic Coast Conference. \nKey returners: Seniors Marcus Paige (14.1 points) and Brice Johnson (12.9) were all-ACC picks a year ago, while junior forward Kennedy Meeks and sophomore Justin Jackson give the Tar Heels four returning double-digit scorers. \nWho left: Starter J.P. Tokoto (8.3 points) was the team’s top perimeter defender and a good passer who was second on the team in assists. \nThe Skinny: Four starters and nine of the top 10 scorers are back, giving the Tar Heels a mix of talent, depth and experience that will make them one of the favorites to reach the Final Four. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T21:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:29:33.767+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
