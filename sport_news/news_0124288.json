He’s faster than Mariota,” Walker said. “He has a pretty good arm, too. I was watching him … The kid can fly.” \nNo. 11 FSU (5-0, 3-0 ACC) fields one of the top defenses in the country, but Louisville (2-3, 1-1 ACC) and its budding offense — led by Jackson — will undoubtedly test the Seminoles. \nThe Cardinals started the season 0-3, falling to Auburn, No. 5 Clemson and No. 24 Houston by a combined 13 points. \nLouisville coach Bobby Petrino struggled to figure out a calling card for his offense, playing three quarterbacks. \nThe identity crisis was epitomized during the team’s first offensive snap of the season against Auburn, when Jackson and quarterback Reggie Bonnafon took the field simultaneously. Jackson threw an interception. \nPetrino has settled on Jackson the past two games — both wins — and Jackson has settled down. \n“I’ve seen him on film enough. I didn’t sleep much the night before,” Seminoles coach Jimbo Fisher said of Jackson. “He gave me a headache. That guy can throw. He can run. We recruited him. I liked him out of high school. I thought the guy was a very dynamic player, really, really good player.” \nPetrino said that Louisville spent its bye week working on timing patterns in the passing game, hoping to make the athletic Jackson more polished as a passer. \nMore of a threat to run the ball (435 rushing yards), Jackson is still a promising but raw quarterback. \nHe has completed 53.6 percent of his passes while compiling a passer rating of 107.36. \nUsing a lot of read-option concepts out of shotgun and pistol formations, the Cardinals plan to use Jackson’s legs to bolster a stagnant run game — Louisville running backs are averaging less than 4 yards per carry — and try to put the Seminoles’ defensive linemen in space. \n“It puts pressure because you have to play with all 11 players in terms of the running back being an extra blocker,” Florida State defensive tackle Nile Lawrence-Stample said. “You’re not having a quarterback just sit back there and hand the ball off. I have to make sure I’m doing everything I can to make sure the defensive end can squeeze.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T18:11:03.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
