TAMMANY PARISH, LA (WVUE) - “That was very courageous of him. I don’t know of any other dog that would do that,” Blake Cordova said.\nPeople carrying signs and four-legged friends all waited with anticipation as they gathered for a special homecoming.\nThor, the K-9 who was stabbed by a burglary suspect earlier this week, is out of the hospital and credited with saving the life of his best friend and partner, Deputy Olivier.\n“I’m just amazed at the outpouring that’s been on Facebook,\" Claire Morgan said. \"It’s been on the news. He’s one of us. He protects us. He deserves every ounce of support from all of us.”\nYou could sense their closeness. It isn’t the first time Thor and his handler have been in a near-death situation. It was last year when a suspect jumped into a river with Thor and tried to drown him. Deputy Olivier jumped in between them and saved Thor. On Tuesday, the K-9 returned the favor, leaping in between his partner and a suspect wielding a 6-inch switchblade.\n“I just think it’s amazing,\" said Beth Cordova. \"I really think that he did something that a lot of people wouldn’t do. He jumped in front of harm's way, and he’s really a true hero. He saved his deputy.”\n“I’m certainly hopeful that Thor makes a complete recovery,” Helen Prine said.\nPrine is, perhaps, Thor’s biggest fan. She's the woman who donated him to the Sheriff’s Office nearly three years ago.\n“I made a contribution of $10,500, because those dogs require all the extra training,” Prine said.\nShe said Thor was one of four dogs they had to choose from at the time of her purchase, but it was clear that he was the best choice.\n“I’m so delighted with Thor,\" she said. \"I still think he’s like my dog, but of course, he belongs to the Sheriff’s Office.”\nShe’s spent some time with him over the years and describes Thor as living up to his name - a fictional superhero, who isn’t afraid to bring down the hammer on crime. But she said he’s also sweet and lovable otherwise.\n“We got him when he was just 15 months old, and now he’s just about to make four and now he’s got another four to six years with the police department,” Prine said.\nThe Parish President presented Thor with a proclamation declaring today Deputy Thor Day in St. Tammany.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
