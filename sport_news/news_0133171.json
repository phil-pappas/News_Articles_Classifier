That is the situation facing the Nittany Lions this Saturday, when they travel to Columbus to face defending national champion Ohio State (8 p.m., ABC). More coverage SHOP: Collegiate Sportswear & Merchandise \n\"I think we'll learn a lot this week,\" Franklin said yesterday. \nThe Lions (5-1, 2-0 Big Ten) have won five straight since losing their opener at Temple, all at home and all against suspect competition. There are still questions about their offense, which remains among the worst in the nation, and their special teams. PSU also has some key injuries, notably the right-ankle sprain that has caused freshman tailback Saquon Barkley, the team's top rusher, to miss the last two games. \nNow the Lions will play their first game outside the state of Pennsylvania, against a Buckeyes team off to a 6-0 start. \n\"It's a unique challenge,\" Penn State middle linebacker Jason Cabinda said. \"That's why we came here - to be in big games against the No. 1 team in the nation.\" \nThe Lions last faced the top-ranked team in 2010, losing 24-3 at Alabama. They last defeated the No. 1 club in 1990, when Craig Fayak's last-second field goal gave them a 24-21 victory at Notre Dame. \nThe Buckeyes have won three straight over PSU, including a 63-14 thumping the last time the Lions were in Columbus, in 2013. Two of OSU's victories this season have been close - 20-13 over Northern Illinois on Sept. 19 and 34-27 over Indiana on Oct. 3 - and in two other games opponents have been within one score in the third quarter. \n\"Looking at their film and watching them, we understand that we can move the ball on them offensively and we can definitely stick with this team,\" Lions offensive tackle Andrew Nelson said. \"We don't fear anybody. . . . They're a great team, but we know if we play to the best of our ability, we can be successful.\" \nThe Lions piled up 420 yards, 266 through the air, in last Saturday's 29-7 victory over Indiana, a game in which quarterback Christian Hackenberg threw for two touchdowns and ran for two others. Yet they are no better than 86th among the nation's 127 FBS teams in passing offense, rushing offense, total offense and scoring. \nAs for Barkley, Franklin said only he will be \"limited\" in practice this week. \n\"We'll see what happens,\" he said. \nThe starting tailback, Akeel Lynch, has also missed the last two games with a knee injury, leaving redshirt freshmen Nick Scott and Mark Allen as the top alternatives at that position. They combined for 102 yards against the Hoosiers, but at one point assistant coach Charles Huff was caught on camera violently yanking Allen by the jersey as the younger man approached the bench. \n\"There's obviously a lot of details and specifics that go into it that we don't need to get into right now,\" said Franklin, adding that he had spoken with Huff about the incident. \"I know who Charles Huff is as a man, I know who Charles Huff is as a coach and those things have been addressed. So yeah, there's not a place for that.\" \nFranklin also said that kicker Joey Julius, benched after missing two extra points against Indiana, will keep his spot if he can fend off Tyler Davis this week in practice. And the biggest concern Saturday is how the Lions will be able to defend an OSU team that leads the Big Ten in rushing offense, total offense and scoring. \nThe Buckeyes, averaging 230 yards rushing, 230 yards passing and 36.8 points a game, are quarterbacked by Cardale Jones, who emerged as the regular late last season after injuries kayoed Braxton Miller and J.T. Barrett. \nBarrett has been used in red-zone situations this year, while Miller, the two-time Big Ten Offensive Player of the Year, plays wide receiver. And, at times, running back. And Wildcat QB. \nThen there's running back Ezekiel Elliott, whose 859 yards on the ground (6.9 per carry) are fourth-most in the nation. \n\"Everybody has to be accounted for,\" PSU safety Jordan Lucas said. \"We just have to be on our P's and Q's as a defense and make sure we play mistake-free football.\" \nThe Lions' defense held the Buckeyes scoreless in the second half last year, and scored a TD itself on an interception return by defensive tackle Anthony Zettel. That allowed Penn State to erase a 17-0 halftime deficit and force overtime, though the Lions lost, 31-24, in the second extra period. \nA 1-0 finish this week figures to be no less difficult to come by.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:12:22.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
