While Nebraska, Boise State and UCLA are more well-known nationally, Shelton says ECU has similar athletes, especially in the skill positions.\n\"They are going to be very fast, and very good,\" he said Tuesday.\n  Shelton, one of the smallest players on the team at 5-foot-8 and 165 pounds, said he had offers from only Auburn and BYU when he committed to play for the Cougars. But after word got out that he had committed to BYU, East Carolina and local schools such as Duke and North Carolina started to show interest.\nToo late.\n\"I know a lot of guys that play for them. I have a few former teammates from high school that play for them. A lot of guys I played against in high school play for them. So yeah, I am quite familiar with ECU,\" Shelton said.\nBYU coaches learned about the prospect who lived more than 2,200 miles from Provo because Shelton is Mormon.\n\"I knew I wanted to come to BYU pretty quickly,\" he said. \"The decision that led to that was my visit here. My visit here was probably one of my most favorite experiences here. I have never felt more welcome, or more at home. That's why it is no problem being so far from my actual home. It is a great place.\"\nShelton redshirted last year because he suffered an injury toward the end of preseason camp.\nNow, he's battling starting corners Micah Hannemann and Michael Davis for playing time and getting on the field when the Cougars go to their nickel package.\n\nSikahema heading to Polynesian Hall of Fame\nFormer BYU running back and kicker returner Vai Sikahema will be inducted into the Polynesian Football Hall of Fame, the hall's organizing committee announced Wednesday. Sikahema, who played for BYU from 1980-81 and from 1983-85, became the first Tongan to play in the NFL after he was drafted by the St. Louis Cardinals.\nFormer BYU coach LaVell Edwards and former Utah coach Ron McBride are on the selection committee. The other inductees for the class of 2016 are Charlie Ane, Jr., Rockne Freitas, Troy Polamalu and Al Lolotai.\nEnshrinement ceremonies are scheduled for Jan. 29 and 30 in Oahu, Hawaii.\n\nCharges against Davis reduced, dismissed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:08:03.291+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
