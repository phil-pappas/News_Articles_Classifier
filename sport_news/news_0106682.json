But after it was announced Sunday that he would take a leave of absence, reports emerged that some Trojans assistant coaches believed Sarkisian had not been sober during U.S.C.’s 42-14 win at Arizona State on Sept. 26.\nSarkisian was 12-6 at U.S.C., and has an overall head-coaching record of 47-35. The Trojans (3-2, 1-2 Pacific-12) play at No. 14 Notre Dame Saturday night. The offensive coordinator Clay Helton will serve as the Trojans’ interim head coach.\nLoading...
