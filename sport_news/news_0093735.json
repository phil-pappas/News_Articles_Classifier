The number is unrecognizable. The voice on the other end of the line is unfamiliar—and it comes with a Swedish accent.\nThis is how the world’s most esteemed minds learn they have won the Nobel Prize. Hearing the phone ring on that October morning is a life-changing moment, and many Nobel laureates start their celebrations in the same way.\nThey assume it’s a prank call.\nENLARGE Nobel medal The organizations that oversee the awards, including the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, are actually used to dealing with disbelief. They even have unofficial protocols for assuring the newly named laureates that they are not, in fact, at the center of an elaborate hoax.\nFirst a calming Swedish voice says hello. But an accent would be easy to fake. Then he says that you have won the Nobel Prize. But that could be a lie, too. Then he might insist it isn’t a prank. But of course he would say that. For some winners, only when he passes the phone to members of the committee whom they know personally does the achievement finally sink in.\nAs far as practical jokes go, convincing someone that he has won the Nobel Prize would be “pretty evil,” said Torsten Persson, the secretary of the committee that on Monday will name this year’s Nobel laureate of economic sciences. “I guess how prank-y it seems might depend on how thick a Swedish accent the guy has.”\nThe annual recognition of scientists, doctors, authors, economists and humanitarians usually opens with a surprising phone call. One weekday in 2013, the University of California, Berkeley biologist Randy Schekman was awakened at 1:20 a.m. He had a feeling the Nobel committee was on the line when his wife blurted out: “This is it!”\nDr. Schekman didn’t need any more proof that his Nobel Prize was real. The secretary of the Nobel committee offered some anyway.\n“Without my saying anything,” Dr. Schekman said, “he assured me it was not a hoax.”\nOther laureates haven’t been as sure. The biochemist William C. Campbell shared the Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine on Monday and responded the way almost anyone else in the world would. “You must be kidding,” he said, according to the award’s official website. Then, like any good scientist, he wanted evidence. “The first thing I did after that was to ask for a way to verify that this could be genuine,” he said. “Because it just seemed impossible.”\nIt was already a strange morning when University of Cambridge biologist Venkatraman Ramakrishnan won the 2009 prize in chemistry. For one thing, he says, he had forgotten the Nobel would be decided that day. But he wouldn’t have been thinking about winning even if he had remembered. Dr. Ramakrishnan was more concerned about his bicycle catching a flat tire on his commute to work that day.\nSo when the phone rang, he admits, he figured it was more probably a prank call than a Nobel Prize call. He had a reason to be suspicious. Almost everything about the Nobel Prize process is secretive. There are no official nominations and the call comes without any advance warning. The winner is determined the morning that the prize is announced.\nENLARGE University of California, Berkeley professor Randy Schekman taking calls on the day he won the Nobel Prize in medicine in 2013.

The Nobel Prizes may reward breakthroughs that are decades old. Then again they may not.\nUniversity of Massachusetts Medical School biologist Craig Mello’s discovery of RNA interference had come only eight years earlier—the blink of an eye in Nobel time—when his home’s phone went off at 4:30 a.m. in 2006. His wife told him not to answer. She thought it was a prank. Then the phone rang again, and this time Dr. Mello picked up. “I’m glad they don’t just move down the list,” he said.\nDr. Mello wasn’t the first or last Nobel laureate to miss the call. It is so unpredictable that the phone often goes unanswered. Princeton University economist Christopher Sims asked his wife to check the area code on the number that woke them up. It appeared to be from Texas. “That’s when we said it was a wrong number,” said the 2011 Nobel laureate, “or a crank call.”\nSimply talking to someone with a Swedish accent isn’t enough to satisfy some Nobel Prize winners. The official who called Stanford University economist Alvin Roth in 2012 didn’t waste much time passing the phone to members of the committee whose voices Dr. Roth might recognize. He shared the good news with Dr. Roth, “but then what he said was I’m here with six of my colleagues, and you know two of them, and they’re going to talk to you now,” he said.\n“Somebody on the committee, sometimes two people on the committee, adds their congratulations and says this is the real thing—it’s not a prank,” Dr. Persson said.\nBrowse Recent A-heds ENLARGE Did Cronkite’s Gift Really Come From Hitler’s Urinal?

That is when the winners are informed how they can watch the news conference online and confirm that the last hour of their lives wasn’t actually a scam. “You type Nobel Prize into Google,” Dr. Roth said. “By then, if there is any doubt, you’re completely convinced.”\nWhether or not a prankster has ever pulled off a successful Nobel Prize caper is uncertain. But there are at least some laureates who think the con could work. Dr. Ramakrishnan, for one, said the idea has popped up in conversations with friends who love practical jokes. There are some scientists, he said, who almost actively campaign for the honor. That only makes them easier targets.\n“We often thought it would be great fun to have some Swedish postdoc call them up and say you’ve won the Nobel Prize,” he said. “But we’d never do it.”\nWrite to Ben Cohen at ben.cohen@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/OG-AE938_AhedIn_G_20150624162255.gif", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/HC-GT931_Medal_G_20151007173020.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ974_NOBELP_M_20151007140509.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KQ974_NOBELP_P_20151007140509.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T05:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:31:00.051+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
