China struggled on bars, typically one of its strongest events. Three athletes fell, though China assured itself of a spot in the eight-team final on Tuesday with solid if unspectacular sets on vault and floor exercise. \nChina's finish bumped Romania down to ninth, meaning one of the sport's original superpowers will miss a team final at a major international meet for the first time in more than 40 years. Romania must qualify for the 2016 Summer Olympics by competing in a test event in Rio next spring. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T14:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T15:05:24.244+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
