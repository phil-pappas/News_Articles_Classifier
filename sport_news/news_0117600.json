The Bills are 3-3, and a number of defensive players, especially defensive linemen who have been asked to drop into coverage instead of rush the quarterback, have spoken out in frustration over how they’re being used.\n“I think I probably set a record on dropping today,” defensive end Mario Williams said after Sunday’s 34-21 loss to the Bengals. “But that's part of the scheme for us to go out and be put in a position to win. Whatever's called you have to go out and do it.”\nUSA TODAY\nHow can Seahawks salvage their season?\nWhen the Bills landed in London Monday for this week’s NFL International Series game against the Jaguars, the team’s mood hadn’t improved.\n“Hey, like (Williams) said, they pay us a lot of money,” defensive tackle Marcell Dareus said, according to Yahoo! Sports. “And we want to use our talents the best way we know how. If we're going to be dropping we don't want to get questions about not getting sacks. That's just how it is.”\nWhen you consider that receiver Sammy Watkins’ complained last week to The Buffalo News that he wasn’t getting enough targets, it’s easy to see that Buffalo’s players are griping at an alarming rate.\nThis should come as a surprise to no one.\nRyan loves to talk. It’s one of the reasons why people from different backgrounds love playing for him. He exudes charm and makes his players feel like he has their back, no matter what.\nBut when things don’t go well, all the talk merely becomes more noise. In the end, Ryan’s players are just practicing what he preaches.\nAnd that's not always good, even though Ryan seems fine with that.\n\"I would say that I probably agree with them,\" Ryan told reporters in London on Wednesday, according to ESPN.com. \"When you look at it, should we rush more this past week in particular? That's probably true. I'm not perfect as a playcaller and all that. And I know that surprises you guys. But I try to do the best. If I'm going to make a mistake, it's something that I feel strongly about but if it doesn't work out at the end of the day, then that happens.\n\"Obviously, when you look at it, and I get it, you get paid to rush the quarterback. Well, I try to get paid to win. What I try to do is I tried to get the guy [Andy Dalton] out of rhythm initially and I think initially it was working pretty good but I think I lived in it too much and so I don't necessarily disagree with Marcell and Mario's views.\"\nBart Scott, who played for Ryan in two places, is not surprised.\n“He would always tell us: ‘Hey, you guys might read some stuff in the paper that you might not like,’ ” the former Jets and Ravens linebacker told USA TODAY Sports recently. “We knew he was going to say some stuff to the media before I happened. He’s transparent to his team. We weren’t shocked by anything that was said because a lot of that stuff was premeditated. It was strategic. He was trying to put all the attention on himself, so you wouldn’t focus on the bad stuff.”\nUSA TODAY\nNFL hot seat coaching index: Jaguars' Gus Bradley stacking losses\nScott pointed to an example when the New York media was pouncing on then-quarterback Mark Sanchez for ineffective play. Rather than to let reporters go after Sanchez, Ryan turned up the trash talk and became the focus of the back pages of local tabloids.\nWilliams, Dareus and Watkins are merely following Ryan’s lead.\nThe Bills, who have almost $41 million tied up in contracts to defensive linemen this season alone, have produced only nine sacks this season, tied for 24th worst in the NFL. A big reason for that is because Ryan seemed to expect his four-man front – comprising defensive ends Williams and Jerry Hughes and defensive tackles Kyle Williams and Dareus – to generate pass rush without needing to bring additional blitzes.\nBut by dropping eight players into coverage, opposing quarterbacks have shredded the Bills with quick passes.\nBuffalo’s season isn’t on the verge of collapse or anything like that. They can still turn it around.\nThere are a lot of new pieces on the roster and it takes time – especially with a young quarterback in Tyrod Taylor – for teams in transition to hit their stride.\nBut there’s no doubt that the Bills – especially with all the bluster and all the talk coming from Ryan – haven’t lived up to expectations, and much of that has been brought on by his own doing.\nAs many fans about 370 miles southeast of Buffalo know, it’s just part of the territory that comes with a Rex Ryan team.\nFollow Lorenzo Reyes on Twitter @LorenzoGReyes\nPLAYLIST: LATEST SPORTS VIDEOS Five games you can't miss in Week 8 of college football | 02:14 USA Today Sports' George Schroeder offers up the five games you can't miss in Week 8 of the college football season.
