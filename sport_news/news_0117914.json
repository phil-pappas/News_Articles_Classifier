'New attitude' Flyers face Rangers Sam Carchidi Posted: Saturday, October 24, 2015, 1:21 PM \nThe Flyers have struggled mightily against the Rangers since 2011 - going 5-14, including a 0-9 mark at Madison Square Garden - but have actually dominated the Blueshirts in recent games at the Wells Fargo Center. \nThe teams will meet tonight at the WFC at 7. The Flyers have won four of the last five meetings with New York on home ice. \nThe Rangers, one of the NHL’s fastest teams, are 5-2-1, second in the Metropolitan Division, behind Washington. \n“I feel like when we play them, they seem to be getting the second and the third efforts,\" right winger Wayne Simmonds said. \"I don't know why, but it just seems to happen when we play the Rangers. But it's a new year. We changed up a lot of things in this dressing room - coaches and personnel wise. We've got a new attitude. We're focused on a different way to play.\" \nRookie coach Dave Hakstol said the Flyers (3-2-1) have a “lot of respect” for the Rangers “in terms of the way they play the game and the success they’ve had, but it needs to end there. From there, it turns into a focus of what we need to do to be successful against a good team.” \nThe Flyers, coming off a 5-4 comeback win in an overtime thriller in Boston, need to slow down a Rangers team that is averaging 2.75 goals per game. \nNew York is allowing just two goals a game, which is tied for No. 2 in the NHL. \nThe Rangers’ Henrik Lundqvist (4-2-1, 2.00 GAA, .938 save percentage) will oppose Steve Mason (1-2-1, 3.88, .878). Mason’s numbers are inflated because of a poor start (four goals in the first 6:38) and quick hook in Florida. \nJason LaBarbera, 35, was recalled from the Phantoms to serve as Mason’s backup. Michal Neuvirth was hit in the mask by Patrice Bergeron’s stick Wednesday and only played one period against Boston. \nManning returns. In a surprise move, defenseman Brandon Manning will return to the lineup Saturday. Luke Schenn replaced Manning and played well in the win over Boston and had practiced with the regular units on Friday. \nThat means Schenn will be scratched for the fourth time in five games. Manning is coming off a shaky performance in a 2-1 loss to Dallas. \nBreakaways. Despite Sean Couturier sitting out the game with an injury, Vinny Lecavalier will be a healthy scratch for the seventh time in seven games. Sam Gagner will center the second line, and R.J. Umberger will replace Couturier on the second PP unit….The Flyers are averaging 33 shots per game, tied for third in the NHL. New York is 21 st , averaging 28.6 shots per game….Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi, who had off-season ankle surgery and is off to a slow start, was recently demoted to the second pairing, next to Keith Yandle. Kevin Klein took his spot on the No. 1 pairing, alongside Ryan McDonagh. Girardi, 31, is in the second year of a six-year $33 million deal.
