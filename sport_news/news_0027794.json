It was as much of a disaster for the Sooners as it was a reprieve for Charlie Strong's beleaguered program, and it was further proof that expecting anything in this series is a sure way to feel like you're hallucinating from eating too many fried Snickers by the end.\nHere are three thoughts on an outcome few of the 91,546 in attendance expected:\n1. Texas can play defense\nOne of the great reservations about the Strong regime was that the program had hired a defensive coach in a Big 12 that demands offensive expertise just to keep up on a week-to-week basis. Even having a defensive-minded head coach wasn't working particularly well on defense ; the Longhorns hadn't allowed fewer than 28 points in a game all year.\nBut the defense asserted itself Saturday with blitzes from just about everywhere to keep Oklahoma quarterback Baker Mayfield unsettled while owning the line of scrimmage. Texas had four sacks at halftime, and the Sooners didn't notch a non-penalty first down until four and a half minutes were left in the first quarter.\nOn what might have been the most critical play of the day, the defensive line won out: With the Sooners facing a third-and-14 with 4:24 left, Texas's Poona Ford and Naashon Hughes flattened their blockers and dropped Mayfield for a 17-yard loss.\nThe Longhorns have their issues, especially with some veterans in the secondary that Oklahoma attacked consistently. And the Sooners made their pushes, as one might expect. But Texas produced its best defensive performance of the year—by far—at exactly the right time.\n2. Mayfield tried to whip up some magic, but was undone by those charged with protecting him\nWhether it was problems with the offensive line or problems with the quarterback not recognizing the pressures that were coming, Oklahoma's offense was having fits for the better part of Saturday.\nCollege Football Video Week 6 college football picks: Cal at Utah, NU at Michigan, more by SI Staff", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:37:01.452+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
