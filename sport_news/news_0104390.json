Ronaldo was brilliant as he helped his depleted side beat Levante 3-0 on Saturday night to top the La Liga table. In the process, he also broke Raul Gonzalez’s club scoring record. “I thought that Cristiano today has taken on the responsibility well. With so many players missing he had to drive the team on for us, and he did that,” Benitez was quoted as saying by 90min.com on Sunday. Meanwhile, Benitez also confirmed that forward Gareth Bale hadn’t suffered a recurrence of his injury after being taken off at half-time. “I did not take Bale off because of some injury,” said Benitez. “He just needed some rest after an intense week with Wales.” Related Posts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T15:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:55:58.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
