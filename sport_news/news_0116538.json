He will sign a five-year, $82 million deal to remain with the team that drafted him in 2011, his agent, Rich Paul, told Yahoo Sports' Marc Spears . \nHere are five things to know about our long, (inter)national -- Thompson is Canadian! -- nightmare being over: \n1. This really didn't need to take so long: Thompson and Paul were reportedly holding out for a five-year, $94 million maximum contract. The Cavaliers ended up giving him essentially the same deal they reportedly offered at the beginning of this process. The leverage, from Thompson's side, was the threat of him sitting out the season and leaving next summer. According to Yahoo Sports , the team didn't buy it. Thompson's side could have saved itself a lot of stress and uncertainty by coming to an agreement earlier -- for example, Draymond Green accepted the same terms from the Golden State Warriors on July 1. \n2. This is still a win for Thompson: There is no guarantee Thompson would have been able to get this kind of contract next year, even with the rising salary cap. While he was great for Cleveland in last season's playoffs, this is still a lot of money for a big man who is not much of a rim protector and does not stretch the floor at all. The Cavs are capped out and have few avenues to improve the team, which meant they were willing to pay up, just not to a crazy degree. In the end, after a whole summer's worth of rumors and posturing, Thompson arguably got more than he's worth, even under the new salary cap. He should be extremely happy, especially considering he should have a chance to compete for multiple titles. \n3. Cleveland is going to have a huge luxury-tax bill, and that's OK: The Cavs should have no problem with paying $170 million-plus in payroll, including the luxury tax, as calculated by ESPN's Brian Windhorst -- that's just the cost of doing business when you have LeBron James on your roster. James would not have come to Cleveland if he thought the organization was going to pinch pennies when it comes to keeping core parts of a championship-contending team. That obviously includes Thompson, so the Cavs would have deserved criticism if they didn't lock him up. \n4. Thompson should be thinking Sixth Man of the Year, not All-Star: As long as Kevin Love and Timofey Mozgov remain healthy, Thompson should come off the bench. That's not the case for most guys who sign $82 million deals, but nothing about this situation has been normal. Cleveland's crowded frontcourt will prevent Thompson from putting up huge numbers, but it also gives him an opportunity to continue contributing on a contender and getting easy looks from James and Kyrie Irving . There won't be a ton of pressure for him to \"live up to the contract\" -- he just has to keep doing all the dirty work that made James and head coach David Blatt rave about him so much last year. Perhaps it's better to be one of the NBA's best reserves than a league-average starter. \n5. The Cavs must wish training camp started now: Thompson isn't the only key piece who didn't get a chance to get in rhythm with his teammates.James just had a back injection, Kevin Love missed most of the preseason, Irving could still be out for a while and Iman Shumpert probably won't be back until January. Cleveland is playing catch-up, and it should be thankful that its early-season schedule is relatively soft. \nTristan Thompson has himself a new contract.
