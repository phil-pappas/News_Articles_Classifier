Because cats also retain sharper hunting skills than dogs, abandoned felines are more likely to survive without any human help. And in some countries, feral cats routinely breed with their wildcat cousins.”\nThe study, which was published last November, confirmed that “after 9,000-odd years of living alongside humans, the house cat remains only semi-domesticated, according to a report… in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
