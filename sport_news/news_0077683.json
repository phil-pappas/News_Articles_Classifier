There's plenty of room off the tee and I don't believe this course is going to get hard enough to make any difference.\" \n\nNicklaus earlier told reporters to laughter that changes had been made to the greens because \"I made it too tough to start with. \n\n\"I think a lot of times, everybody, all designers go through cycles of when they do different things. I guess I was in my bumpy cycle when we started this. I'm in my more 'peaceful, love golfer' cycle right now.\" \n\nNicklaus, who won 18 majors and is regarded as the greatest ever player, said he hoped the two team captains would be able to arrange a Sunday singles showdown between Jordan Spieth and Day, the hottest players in world golf. \n\nHe said he and his opposing Presidents Cup captains had always managed to find a way to put together the match-ups fans wanted to see, such as Tiger Woods v Ernie Els in 2003. \n\n\"We used to be able to get that done, I don't know what they're doing now,\" he said. \n\n\"The captains here will make up their mind what they want to do. If they want to have Spieth and Day play, which I think would be a great match, they certainly have the option to do it.\" \n\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T12:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T14:01:19.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
