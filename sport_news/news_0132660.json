A mile away at the inner harbor, a Browns fan the size of a lineman was wearing a Gene Hickerson shirt. Hickerson was a Browns guard in 1964 when Cleveland beat the Baltimore Colts in an NFL championship game. Nearer the stadium, another Browns fan walked up a ramp near a parking lot where people in purple shirts were playing cornhole. “Look at all the happy Ravens,” someone said to him. “I hope they enjoy being 1-3,” the fan said, before that turned to 1-4. Inside the stadium, spots of brown or orange were visible in the sea of purple seats. Most of the game went Baltimore’s way, but not the business part. As the Browns approached the game-winning field goal in overtime, most of the purple shirts were gone. All of the orange ones remained. The Browns avoided 1-4, and for a moment at least, 2-3 seemed like the top of the world. • Baltimore fans are spoiled and don’t know it. “This is my last game this year,” said a season-ticket holder three rows off the field. “I’ve sold these tickets for the rest of the year. “We aren’t going anywhere. We don’t have any receivers.” Baltimore hasn’t seen a losing season since 2007. There has been a Super Bowl win and two other trips to AFC title games. Browns fans have seen one winning season (2007) in the last 13 years. RISE OF THE CROW Josh McCown headed to overtime with 425 passing yards, fourth most ever against the Ravens. At that point, Browns running backs Isaiah Crowell and Duke Johnson had rushed for only 53 yards on 16 carries. Yet, Crowell made his presence felt late in the fourth quarter. With the Browns trailing 27-22 and driving, Crowell made a 4-yard gain on first down. On the next play, he turned a short pass from McCown on the left side into a 22-yard touchdown. “There was a blitz coming from the other side,” Crowell said. “I went out where I was supposed to be, Josh dumped it out and I took off for the end zone.” The Browns went for two and converted (Andrew Hawkins), taking a 30-27 lead, which led to overtime when the Ravens drove to a field goal. The Ravens won the coin toss and opted to receive in overtime. The defense picked a good time to make one of its handful of stops. The offense took over on its own 35 and got enough help from the running game to matter in driving to a touchdown. Page 2 of 4 - “Early on,” Crowell said, “Baltimore shot a lot of gaps. They played very well. We kept fighting, and the ground game came alive a little in the second half.” THE HORSE’S MOUTH Key points from Browns head coach Mike Pettine after Sunday’s 33-30 overtime win at Baltimore: • Putting the win in perspective: “Sometimes you get wins that define things for you, that becomes a turning point. “We did a lot of bad things, but we found a way. “We know we didn’t play well, but we made enough plays. We made a great stop in overtime. I can’t speak enough about the guys on offense, how they kept going out, unfazed.” • On throwing 51 times: “I thought we would put it in McCown’s hands. We protected Josh fairly well. He made some huge throws.” • On Gary Barnidge’s “butt catch”: “I told him if that’s not judged the No. 1 play of the day, something’s wrong.” • On an necessary roughness call against K’Waun Williams that prolonged Baltimore’s last series, leading to a field goal that sent the game to overtime: “I thought he was just trying to jar the ball loose. It was a bang-bang call, a close call. We have been on the short end of a lot of those. Our guys did a great job (coming back from) that.” LOCKER-ROOM CHATTER • McCown on how missing Travis Benjamin early in the game sharpened his focus: “It was the second quarter. I threw it low. I just missed him. That bothered me the whole game.” • Ravens safety Kendrick Lewis on failing to break up Barnidge’s “butt catch” that went for a touchdown: “That was just a crazy play. It just happened to roll their way.” • Browns defensive end Desmond Bryant, who returned from a shoulder injury and helped on a stop in overtime: “There’s nothing better than going out there with my brothers and winning a game like that.” • Ravens wideout Kamar Aiken, whose 48-yard catch helped Baltimore control much of the game: “We’re 1-4. That’s a tough one. My spirits aren’t too high right now.” • Baltimore head coach John Harbaugh: “Obviously, a very disappointing loss, one that should not have happened. Give the Browns credit. They found a way to win.” Page 3 of 4 - • Linebacker C.J. Mosley, part of a defense that allowed the Browns to rack up 505 yards: “I’ll point out myself as the first one. I’ve got to have more discipline. I gave up a big play. They were able to get a shake right on me.” (It was not clear which play he was talking about.) • Browns running back Duke Johnson: “We came out slow. We played well when we needed to.” DOING THE MATH • Cleveland tied a franchise record with 12 third-down conversions. The only other time the team converted 12 third downs in a game was in 2008 against Seattle. • McCown passed for a career-high and Browns single-game record 457 passing yards. McCown is the first player in Browns history to throw for 300-yard in three consecutive games. His 1,154 passing yards across the past three games is a Browns record in a three-game span, surpassing the 1,038 totaled by Brian Sipe in 1980. • Rabbit watch: McCown targeted Benjamin 12 times, hitting him six times for 83 yards. Through five games, Benjamin has caught 22 passes for 411 yards. In all of 2014, Benjamin caught 18 passes for 314 yards. • Tight end Rob Housler, who made 105 catches in four years with the Cardinals, made his first catch as a Brown. It went for just 6 yards, but it came at a crucial time, helping along a drive to the touchdown that gave the Browns a 30-27 lead with 3:03 left in regulation. • McCown is 2-0 against Baltimore in his 14-year NFL career. In the only other meeting, he led the Bears to a victory in Chicago. • Coming out of the game, McCown’s season passer rating is 102.8. Joe Flacco’s is 80.8. • Rookie Duke Johnson caught six more passes, netting 55 yards. He has 21 catches through five games. No Browns running back had more than 11 catches (Terrance West) in all of 2014. • The Browns’ run defense continues to be a problem. Justin Forsett and rookie Javorius Allen combined to give the Ravens 179 rushing yards at 6.2 per carry. Allen, a fourth-round pick out of Southern Cal, broke a 44-yard run. In four previous games, he totaled 66 rushing yards, with a long gain of 12. JOE HADEN HURT Cornerback Joe Haden landed hard while trying to break up a pass on the second play of the fourth quarter. Haden stayed down on the field for two minutes before being helped to the bench, where he was diagnosed with concussion-like symptoms. He was placed in “concussion protocol” and is in jeopardy of missing next Sunday’s game against Peyton Manning and the Broncos. Page 4 of 4 - The Browns took a 22-21 lead and kept it on their first series without Haden. On the next series, the Ravens drove to a touchdown and a 27-22 lead. • Dwayne Bowe, the $9 million man, did not suit up for the third time in five games. Bowe was targeted once in each of the team games he was active. Neither resulted in catch. He was on the field for a total of 12 snaps in his two games. • Injured Browns regulars who did not suit up because of injuries included safety Tashaun Gipson and linebacker Craig Robertson. WAKE UP THE COLTS Pro Football Hall of Fame President David Baker took the field at halftime to present Hall of Fame rings to Raymond Berry, Gino Marchetti and Lenny Moore. Those three were enshroud in the Hall of Fame before the Hall presented rings. All three played against the Browns in the 1964 NFL championship game, won 27-0 by Cleveland. EXTRA POINTS • Brian Hartline made his third catch of the season that was followed by a replay challenge. For the first time, his catch was overturned. • After one quarter, the Browns trailed 134-56 in yards. • Jamal Lewis spent the game on the Ravens’ sideline. He spent the end of his NFL career with the Browns. Lewis ran for a then-league-record 295 yards, against the Browns, when he was with Baltimore. In 2007, he ran 1,304 yards for a Browns team that went 10-6 and beat the Ravens twice. Lewis played for the Browns in their last overtime win, 33-30 in overtime in Baltimore in ‘07. • Flacco made his 117th career start as Baltimore’s quarterback. The most starts made by a Browns expansion-era quarterback was 34 by Derek Anderson. The most starts (regular season) by Browns quarterbacks before the move to Baltimore were 114 by Otto Graham, 112 by Sipe and 105 by Bernie Kosar. • The Browns are 1-0 in the AFC North for the first time since 2004. • The Browns totaled 505 yards of total offense, their most in a game since 2007, when the team total 554 against Cincinnati on Sept. 16.
