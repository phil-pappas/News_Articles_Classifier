Jorge Beale, Jr. handles LST wound care, hyperbaric personnel, operations within the hospitals that have contracted LST to provide services and medically accredited courses. The majority of LST’s work comes from setting up and operating hospital-based Wound Care and Hyperbaric Medicine units.\nHyperbaric Medical treatment involves placing a patient in a specially designed vessel known as a hyperbaric chamber that is pressurized greater than atmospheric pressure. The patient breathes 100% oxygen while under increased pressure. Monoplace hyperbaric chambers are the most common and are designed to treat one patient at a time. Multiplace chambers are purpose-built and can accommodate a dozen or more patients. LST operates a critical-care Multiplace chamber at Nassau University Medical Center, East Meadow, NY.\nRecent LST projects have included providing consulting and proprietary decompression profiles, procedures, and medical support for workers creating tunnels underneath the East River between Long Island and Manhattan for the Long Island Railroad (LIRR); providing emergency medical training for workers building the new Tappan Zee Bridge across the Hudson River, between Tarrytown, NY and Nyack, NY; expanding hyperbaric medical operations at various hospitals in New York; training physicians and allied health professional through accredited hyperbaric medicine courses in NY and in CT.\nGlenn Butler, LST’s founder and CEO, said, “We work in the metaphorical Yellow Submarine. The uniqueness of submarine operations is reflected in the breadth and depth of LST’s operations, which originated from the world of deep sea diving and research. Jorge Beale, Jr. has proven himself more than capable of juggling the various personnel and operational requirements of our blend of medical and life-safety engineering companies. With the help of Jorge’s operational talents we have expanded considerably during his 14- year tenure with LST. We look forward to continued expansion with Jorge’s very capable, professional handling of daily operations.”\nJorge Beale, Jr, COO said, “LST operates in unique pressure environments, including – quite literally – from orbital space to under the sea and into your hospital. LST contracts include medical, engineering, tourism, NASA and military support. Personnel are expected to be able to shift gears quickly and safely. I’m honored to have been promoted in this interesting, multi-faceted group of companies.”\nLST hyperbaric medicine courses are accredited by the Undersea & Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS) and also by the National Board of Diving & Hyperbaric Medical Technology (NBDHMT). The UHMS and also the American College of Hyperbaric Medicine (ACHM) set standards and are the certification boards for physicians who wish to supervise human hyperbaric medical treatment. The NBDHMT sets standards and is the certification board for allied health care professionals who are involved with hyperbaric medical treatment of people, and animals, including horses and small animals.\nCurrently, in the United States, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approve hyperbaric treatment for fifteen (15) medical indications. Most commercial insurance carriers follow CMS guidelines for hyperbaric treatment reimbursement. Conditions covered by CMS include: acute carbon monoxide intoxication; decompression illness; gas embolism; gas gangrene; acute traumatic peripheral ischemia; crush injuries and suturing of severed limbs; progressive necrotizing infections (necrotizing fasciitis); acute peripheral arterial insufficiency; preparation and preservation of compromised skin grafts (not for primary management of wounds); chronic refractory osteomyelitis, unresponsive to conventional medical and surgical management; osteoradionecrosis as an adjunct to conventional treatment; soft tissue radionecrosis as an adjunct to conventional treatment; cyanide poisoning; actinomycosis, only as an adjunct to conventional therapy when the disease process is refractory to antibiotics and surgical treatment; diabetic wounds of the lower extremities in patients who meet certain criteria.\nFor more information see:\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)\nhttp://www.cms.gov\nNational Board of Diving & Hyperbaric Medical Technology (NDBHMT)\nhttp://www.nbdhmt.org/\nUndersea & Hyperbaric Medical Society (UHMS)\nhttp://membership.uhms.org/\nLife Support Technologies Group (LST)\nhttp://www.lifesupport-USA.com\nAbout the Life Support Technologies Group (LST)\nThe Life Support Technologies Group (LST) is a Tarrytown, NY-based medical and life-support engineering company specializing in Advanced Wound Care and Hyperbaric Medicine Services to hospitals in the NY, NJ, CT region.
