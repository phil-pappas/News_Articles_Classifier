The Indian football team captain was set up by Haitian Sony Norde on both the occasions. The victory, after two losses and a draw, boosted their points tally to four. Mumbai, who had scored only one goal so far, found the mark in the 13th minute after a delightful one-two between Norde and Chhetri. Chhetri scored the second with a deft low shot into the left corner after his strike partner had run through three defenders to lay it up for him, much to the delight of the small crowd. â€” PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:14:41.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
