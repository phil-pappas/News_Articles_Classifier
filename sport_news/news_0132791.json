Greilick, Detroit News) \nCONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE When Michigan State scored on the final play of the game to beat Michigan, 27-23, on Saturday, the Spartans streamed onto the field at Michigan Stadium in celebration.\nCaught up in the moment, Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio followed, overcome by the excitement of the victory. A few seconds later, Dantonio noticed safety Jalen Watts-Jackson, the game’s hero, was on the ground with a broken hip. It was only moments after that he realized he hadn’t greeted Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh for a postgame handshake.\nIt wasn’t a slight, and after the game, Dantonio called Harbaugh a “good man” and said he “respects the University of Michigan and what coach Harbaugh has done so far and the direction they are going.”\nOn Sunday, Dantonio again emphasized his respect for Harbaugh.\n“It’s too bad,” he said. “In a game, somebody is going to win and somebody is going to lose. And I’m sure that’s a tough loss.”\nHarbaugh did seek out Michigan State athletic director Mark Hollis on the sidelines to congratulate him and the two shook hands.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T23:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T03:32:54.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
