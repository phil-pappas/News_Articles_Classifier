Iannetta took the team charter for potentially his final time as an Angel.\nTeammates Taylor Featherston , Ryan Jackson, Jose Alvarez , Fernando Salas , Matt Joyce and Carlos Perez also handled their own packing Monday morning, saying little, still letting the disappointment sink in about how their frenzied playoff chase ended so abruptly.\nThis was the toughest ending of Iannetta’s 10 seasons in the majors. It concluded his third and final year of his three-year, $15.5 million deal with the Angels, a season spoiled by an April slump (.093 batting average) and one that ended with the former everyday catcher watching from the dugout as a rookie Perez got the bulk of the starts.\nIannetta, 32, finished with a slashline of .188/.293/.335 and 10 home runs in 92 games. He saw action in just 10 games in September, his last appearance a Sept. 28 start in which he drew a walk, had a sacrifice fly, scored a run and struck out.\nHe’s a free agent now, destination unknown.\n“I have no expectations. I’d love to be back here,” said Iannetta, sounding like most free agents as they prepare to walk out the clubhouse door. “We’ll see what happens. The ball’s not really in my court. It’s really about what they (the Angels) want to do and if it makes sense.”\nIannetta has gracefully handled the season as the Angels continued to turn more often to the developing Perez, 24, who appeared in 86 games and hit .250/.299/.346. He mentored Perez, spoke to the rookie nearly every game about the position and, after the final game Sunday, made sure to spend a moment with the young Venezuelan who had a breakout season.\n“It was really fun to watch you play,” Iannetta told Perez. “Keep working hard. Don’t relax. Keep going.”\nPerez on Monday recalled more of that conversation, remembering, “He (Iannetta) said I did a good job and that was nice of him. He helped me every day and told me he was proud of me.”\nIn opposite sides of a quiet clubhouse, Perez and Iannetta packed up their lockers Monday and left separately, Perez first. Iannetta, wearing his tattered ballcap from his University of North Carolina days, took his time.\n“It’s a weird feeling,” he said, loading cardboard boxes with gear, not knowing where he’ll play next. “I’m unemployed. I don’t know what’s going to happen.”\nHe keeps reminding himself of the lessons players learn during the season about living in the moment rather than obsessing over what has happened or what might occur in the future.\n“This (offseason) is going to be one of the big tests of that ideology of living in the moment and focusing on what you can control,” he said. “It’s one thing to grasp the lessons but to actually live by them and put them in practice.\n“It’s easier to do when things are going well but it’s more difficult to do when things are challenging, so this will be a good challenge.”\nHe still wants to be an everyday catcher. “Yes, of course,” he said. “Physically I know I can. I’m in no different shape than I was when I was 26 or 27 or 28. If anything, I’m probably stronger than I was then. Now I feel like I can be an everyday guy for another three or four years from a physical standpoint.”\nBut maybe not wearing No. 17 for the Angels.\nHe figures he will probably be “processing” his season throughout October. He plans to return home to Rhode Island, enjoy the company of his children, and start offseason workouts in two weeks rather than the month he typically gives himself.\nHe’s fresher from not having carried the everyday load. He has stayed in shape, running the stadium and lifting, while waiting for the starts that became occasional ones.\nHe still grapples with his dreadful April slump that towed his batting average below .200. Without April, he was as consistent as he has been in the past. Last season, he batted a more career-typical .252.\n“I just had a really bad stretch in April,” he said. “I can’t change it. I wouldn’t have been able to predict it. I knew something was up starting in spring training … and then once I got it figured it out, it took off (the rest of the season). Now I’m just going focus on what I did well … and use some of the negative stuff to get me through workouts in the offseason.”\nIannetta did plenty well. He handled all the arms that cycled through the rotation and bullpen. He was a solid teammate and a friendly Angel who often stopped for the fans. He supported Perez, the player who would replace him.\nHe has made Angels memories, including in 2012, when he caught Jered Weaver ’s no-hitter. He gutted out the game after being plunked in the wrist, which turned out to be broken.\nOn Sept. 19 at Minnesota, Iannetta hit his 100th career home run. He retrieved the milestone ball from a fan in exchange for an autographed one.\n“It’s one of the (best Angels) memories,” he said, “... because you put yourself in some small numbers among catchers who’ve hit over 100.”\nIannetta hopes he will find a team next season, “a landing spot,” he said, knowing he might not return to the Angels who have a new general manager and other changes ahead.\nContact the writer: masmith@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:30:40.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
