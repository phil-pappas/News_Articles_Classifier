Ultimately, the 0-2 Bruins were forced to make changes for Game 3 – Monday’s TD Garden matinee against the defending Eastern Conference champion Lightning (1:05 P.M., NESN, WBZ-FM/98.5). Perhaps predictably, the Bruins lost a player who excels in several of their areas of need late in Saturday night’s 4-2 loss to the Canadiens. Brad Marchand, left wing on the Patrice Bergeron-centered line that checks top opposing forwards, Bergeron’s penalty-killing partner, and last season’s top goal-scorer (24), sustained a concussion when he ran into Montreal’s Dale Weise. He’s sidelined indefinitely. “We have no timetable for him,” coach Claude Julien said after Sunday morning’s practice, during which he administered the first bandage to cover up Marchand’s loss. Loui Eriksson slid from Bergeron’s right side to his left, and Brett Connolly was moved up from the third line to play right wing. That Connolly, whom the B’s obtained late last season from the Lightning, would be first choice to fill a hole on such an important two-way line says a fair bit about the Bruins’ difficulties so far: He was minus-4 with no points in two games on a line with Ryan Spooner and Jimmy Hayes, who are both also 0-0–0 and minus-4. “I felt they were losing too many battles,” Julien said, “and because of that, they’re not ... having enough opportunities to create (offense). “To be successful, you’ve got to win those battles for pucks, and races, and be strong on them. I think, as a line, they needed to be better there.” Veteran Chris Kelly, most valuable as a defensive player, joins Spooner and Hayes. “Communication will be big, if we are together,” said Kelly, who will try to help the line execute “little plays – quick support, trying to outnumber guys, being patient when need be and aggressive when that opportunity comes.” Given the number of players new to the lineup, combined with the absence of veteran defensemen Zdeno Chara (upper body injury) and Dennis Seidenberg (back surgery), the Bruins anticipated some disorganization and preached patience to start the season. One offseason addition already seems to have run out of time, though. Defenseman Matt Irwin, who signed a one-year, one-way contract for $800,000 after three years with the Sharks, was placed on waivers on Sunday, after just two games as a Bruin. Irwin, 27, was minus-3 skating with Zach Trotman in Thursday’s season-opening, 6-2 loss to the Jets, and minus-2 when partnered with Kevan Miller against the Habs. Page 2 of 2 - While that transaction was hardly what the B’s envisioned when they signed Irwin over the summer, it may in some ways foreshadow some defensive improvements. Rookie Colin Miller, who replaced Trotman on Saturday, made a solid NHL debut against the Habs, and likely earned the chance to play on Monday. Perhaps more important: That the Bruins deleted one of only three left-shooting defensemen (Irwin) on the eve of a game suggested that Chara, who was injured on Sept. 24, could make his 2015-16 debut against the Lightning. Julien wouldn’t confirm that. “I would say questionable,” said the coach. “We haven’t made that decision yet. “That’s going to be done at some point (Monday) with the medical staff, and see if it warrants playing or not. ... It’s a matter of, what’s the risk factor?” The B’s will have their hands full on Monday, no matter who plays. The 2-0-0 Lightning are one of the NHL’s deepest, most explosive outfits, with the dynamic “Triplets” (Tyler Johnson, Ondrej Palat and Nikita Kucherov) on one line, and two-time NHL goal-scoring leader Steven Stamkos on another. “They’re structured, they’re well-coached, and they’ve got a lot of firepower, so we’ve got to play them tight,” said Connolly, who scored 12 goals for the Lightning last year before his trade to the Bruins. “There’s no question it’s going to be a big challenge.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T06:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T06:46:11.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
