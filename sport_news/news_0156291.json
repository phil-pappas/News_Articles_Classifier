A four-star defensive end out of Aldine MacArthur, Chambers made a verbal commitment to TCU on Friday afternoon at ceremony at his high school.\nChambers put on his TCU hat as he announced his decision and left Texas, Texas A&M and Houston on the table. He also held offers from Baylor, Florida State, Georgia, Oklahoma, Oregon and a number of other major programs.\nAt 6-foot-3, 258 pounds, Chambers is ranked as the No. 6 strong-side defensive end in the country and No. 14 overall prospect in the state, according to 247Sports Composite.\nChambers has an official visit planned to Arizona State on November 20, but it is unclear if he will still make that trip.\nChambers is the 15 th verbal commit in TCU's 2016 class and third defensive end. He joins Long Beach C.C.'s (Calif.) Mat Boesen and Mesquite Horn's Gary Overshown.\nOn Twitter:\n @EJHolland247", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EJHolland247"], "published": "2015-09-25T22:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:34:10.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
