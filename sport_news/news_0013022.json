He’s played on several teams that lost the first game of a series and some that won the first one.\nHe was not deeply troubled that the Blue Jays lost this first foray into playoff baseball Thursday.\n“It’s just baseball,” said Martin, who went 1-for-4 with a double. “I think we can win three in a row. We’ve done it before. The way to think about is this: I definitely think we can finish the year playing above .500 in the playoffs. If you do that, you win the whole thing.”\nMartin has caught David Price when he’s been at his best and Thursday was not his best.\n“He wasn’t as pinpoint-accurate as he can be and we didn’t really give him the kind of run support that we’re capable of,” said Martin. “We lost but I thought Price did a good enough job to keep us in the game. They just played a little bit better.”\n“He didn’t have his best command. Having said that, I’ve seen him without his best command and he can still manage. He’s powerful enough that he can get away with some mistakes. Today they capitalized on a couple of mistakes and we weren’t able to score enough runs.”\nMartin is counting on the Blue Jays’ resilience that has been evident all season long.\n“I can only speak for myself,” he said. “I’m ready for tomorrow already. This game’s over. They played better than us. We’ll look forward to getting back in the zone tomorrow.”\nCOLD STREAKS\nThe Game 1 loss by David Price was his fourth straight to the Texas Rangers in the post-season. Only one player has a longer losing streak against a single team in post-season history: Aaron Sele of the Rangers lost five in a row to New York Yankees. Four pitchers had four-game losing streaks to a single team:\n* Roger Clemens, Boston Red Sox to the Oakland A’s.\n* Doug Drabek, Pittsburgh Pirates to the Atlanta Braves.\n* Clayton Kershaw, Los Angeles Dodgers to the St. Louis Cardinals.\n* Tom Glavine, Atlanta, to Pittsburgh.\n— Bob Elliott\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nExperienced Russell Martin stays calm after Jays lose Game 1 of ALDS\nBy Ken Fidlin , Toronto Sun First posted: Thursday, October 08, 2015 11:43 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 08, 2015 11:47 PM EDT\nOver the course of his career, Russell Martin has played in 41 post-season games.
