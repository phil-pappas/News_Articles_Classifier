Manti, 110.\nComing down the stretch, Millard’s Anna Camp was confident that she could win state and three-peat in the individual race. However, with North Summit’s Sadie Sargent right on her heels, it wasn’t easy obtaining individual honors.\n“I was confident that I could win but when (Sargent) got close to me I got pretty worried,” Camp said.\nHowever, Wednesday at Sugar House Park, the Millard senior was clutch down the stretch and finished the three-mile course with a 18:48.0 time to win the 2A girls cross country individual title. Her time edged out Sargent by the slim margin of 0.2 seconds.\nSargent didn’t leave empty-handed, though, as North Summit won the girls team race and left with the first place trophy.\nIn the boys competition, Millard surprised everyone by winning the team competition over North Summit while cross country rookie Jace Richins of North Summit won individual honors.\n“It was more nerve-wracking than other years with all the pressure after winning two years in a row,” said Camp who also won in both 2013 and 2014 and who also plays soccer for Millard. “I have never worked so hard during the season.”\nSimilarly, North Summit won for the third year in a row in the girls team portion of state.\n“This group has just been a very cohesive group,” North Summit co-head coach Virginia Richins explained. “They’ve worked hard and they’ve encouraged each other. This has been the hardest working group we’ve ever had.”\nRichins credits the win to her team’s dedication but also to the community of North Summit where the cross country squad received a lot of support from various people and from the school . \n“It’s really a community win,” Richins said. “We’re a really tight-knit community.”\nNorth Summit was led by Sargent who finished with a time of 18:48.2 and also by sisters Maggie and Abbi Zwahlen who finished at third and eighth with times of 19:24.6 and 21:00.7, respectively.\nIn the boys team portion, Millard also repeated as it took state for the second year in a row, which came as a bit of a surprise.\nDue to some health complications with Millard’s Connor Cox, who is one of the best runners in 2A, Millard struggled during the year and took second in its region.\nWith all the difficulties that Millard had, head coach Cody Moat was unsure if his team could take first place in the state tournament though he knew his runners had plenty of talent.\n“I told my team before the race ‘You have the talent, you have the ability, but you need to step up,’” Moat explained. “They put it all out there. I’m proud of the way they stepped up. I thought there was no way that we could take first. It was a miracle.”\nMillard was led by Calvin Bell and Parker Stevens who took sixth and eighth with times of 17:30.2 and 17:31.7, respectively.\nNorth Summit’s Jace Richins took 2A individual honors despite this being the first state championship in cross country running that he has participated in.\nRichins played football in previous years but after discovering a hidden talent for long-distance running during the 2015 track season, Richins gave cross country a try. Wednesday he proved that that was a good choice as the junior ran a 16:21.9 time defeating Wasatch Academy’s Devin Mesquite by 14 seconds.\nWhen asked about the wide success of North Summit’s cross country program, Richins believes that it has a lot to do with lifestyle.\n“They put us out it the fields (to do farm work),” Richins explained. “We do a lot of work down there, we’re always running.”\nComing in second place in the boys team race was Emery while North Summit took third.\n2A Boys Results \n1.
