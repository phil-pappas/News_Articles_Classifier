We figured it was something they would try to do on that play, and we were ready.\"\nThe next task was for the offense to get breathing room, and coach Tim Doup’s first impulse was to call a play-action pass.\nThat thought quickly disappeared for quarterback Kevan Green when Capital blitzed in order to plug the gaps to keep the Cardinals pinned.\nSenior John Pyles of Franklin Heights burst through the left side of the line and ran 99 yards for a touchdown to make it 21-7 with 10:20 left in the first half.\n“My thinking there was to protect the ball and get away from the goal line,\" Pyles said. “I didn’t think I got touched. I just wanted to run as fast as I could and don’t get caught.\"\nHad he been tackled from behind, Pyles would have never lived it down with his teammates on the track team. He ran a leg on the 4x100 relay team that finished eighth in the NCAA Division III meet last spring.\n“I was thinking, ‘You have to finish strong,'\" said Pyles, who finished with 193 yards on the ground. “I think our offensive line stepped up the entire game. We had a balance of running and passing, and that had a great effect.\"\nGreen got the best view of the play and liked what he saw once Pyles ran into the line.\n“There was a small hole and when he got through there was nobody there -- nobody,\" he said. “He’s fast, a great athlete. He was gone. I like to run up the field to follow the play, but I was walking at midfield.\"\nThe game changed for good when Otterbein recovered a fumble on the ensuing kickoff at the Capital 33.\nFive plays later, sophomore receiver Julian Lowe of Gahanna ran 18 yards for a touchdown on a jet sweep to make it 28-7.\n“Our guys calmed down -- relaxed -- after the (Pyles touchdown),\" Doup said. “When we got the fumble on the kickoff, we said they could be in a little bit of trouble if we score here.\"\nCapital (2-3) got within 28-14 on a 1-yard run by Nick Waters of Hilliard Davidson with 1:56 left in the second quarter.\nThe Cardinals responded by going 75 yards in four plays for a touchdown, a 37-yard pass from Green to Logan Stepp of West Jefferson with 50 seconds left in the half to make it 35-14.\nGreen said it was about time the play, a skinny post in the back of the end zone, worked.\n“That play, we probably run it every game,\" Green said. “I either overthrow it or the protection breaks down. Finally, we connected. That was a big play.\"\nmznidar@dispatch.com \n@markznidar", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T21:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T01:22:36.672+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
