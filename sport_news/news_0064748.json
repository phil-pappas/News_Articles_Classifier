(AP Photo/Phelan M. Ebenhack) \nJACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) — The Jacksonville Jaguars have signed Jeff Tuel to the practice squad, giving them a third quarterback in case Blake Bortles can’t play this week because of a sprained throwing shoulder. \nBortles injured his right shoulder early in a 38-31 loss to Tampa Bay on Sunday. He finished the game, completing 23 of 33 passes for 303 yards and a career-high four touchdowns. \nBortles is not expected to practice Wednesday, leaving backup Chad Henne to get first-team repetitions while Tuel runs the scout team. \nThe Jaguars claimed Tuel off waivers from Buffalo in June. He spent training camp and the preseason with Jacksonville before he was waived in August. Tuel, who started a regular-season game for the Bills in 2013, played in one preseason game this year. He completed 6 of 11 passes for 63 yards against the New York Giants. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:59:59.644+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
