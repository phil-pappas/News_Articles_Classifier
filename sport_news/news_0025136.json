The 46-year-old German coach had previously managed Wigan and Brentford. \nA force in domestic and European football from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s, Leeds has struggled over the past decade and the team has yet to win at Elland Road this season. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T14:21:07.358+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
