It was clear all along, though, that defenseman Andy Greene was that right guy.\nSo, after taking training camp to observe, talking it over among themselves and polling the players, Shero and Hynes called Greene in for a meeting Thursday afternoon to let him know he was going to be named the 11th captain in team history.\nHe wore the \"C\" for the first time in Friday night’s 2015-16 opener against Winnipeg.\n\"It’s pretty cool,\" Greene said after Hynes made the official announcement following the team’s morning skate Friday. \"Obviously, there’s only 30 teams in the NHL and there can only be 30 captains and it’s pretty cool to be one of them.\"\nGreene, who will turn 33 on Oct. 30, became the fifth Devils’ defenseman to wear the \"C,\" joining Bruce Driver, Scott Stevens, Scott Niedermayer and Salvador.\n\"I think you knew as soon as Sal wasn’t coming back that it was just a matter of time before Greenie got it,\" center Stephen Gionta said. \"He’s arguably been our best player for the last couple of years. On top of that, he’s an unbelievable leader. When he speaks guys listen and that’s a sign of the respect that guys have for him.\"\nHynes acknowledged the selection was \"clear cut\" among the coaching staff, management and the players. When Salvador missed much of last season with a back injury, Greene was the de facto leader of the defense and a dominant personality in the locker room with his ability to be both lighthearted and seriously focused at the appropriate times.\nAnd, as Gionta noted, though unheralded throughout much of the league, he has been the Devils’ best player for a while. \n\"It was a good choice and a clear choice,\" goaltender Cory Schneider said. \"He’s such a rock back there. He doesn’t seemingly ever miss a game or make a bad play. So, he’s kind of the epitome of consistency and work ethic that we’re looking for here in New Jersey.\"\nEmail: gulitti@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:20:45.299+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
