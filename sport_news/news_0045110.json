The star quarterback for the Elba Tigers announced this week that he will be walking on for the Auburn Tigers come spring. \nRigby is in a unique position, due to his academic standing. He will graduate in December, which will give him the chance to be a part of Auburn's quarterback unit come spring ball. It also gives him the opportunity to train with Auburn up until his class graduates, and pick another school if he chooses. \nRigby will be the overlooked man as a walk on, but his work ethic and attitude has him thinking he can fight for a shot in a group of unproven quarterbacks. \n\"Even though there may be some better athletes than me, I know I'm going to work harder than everyone else,\" the athlete explained. \nBased on recruiting sites, Rigby is the least heralded quarterback that will be on Auburn's roster next season. These recruiting sites typically rank recruits based on their play at camps and combines, which Ramsey has never attended. \nCoach Ed Rigby, who also happens to be Ramsey's father, believes recruiting sites don't always measure players the right way. \n\"These rankings from recruit sites come from attending these Nike combines, things like that, and he's never been.\" Coach Rigby said. \"I believe in film, and real coaches believe in film. You look at how people perform in live situations. I've seen guys who look like Tarzan and play like Jane, guys who are the greatest drill runners you've ever seen.\" \nIn addition, recruiting sites can't measure heart. \n\"There's an intangible where you can't get a zipper and unzip their chest and open it up and look inside of it and see what they're really made of.\" Coach Rigby continued. \"That's the one thing recruiting sites can't do.\" \nRamsey Rigby may be a name that you hear down the road with the Auburn Tigers, but for now you can watch him lead his top ranked Elba Tigers as they aim for the Class 2 state championship.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:14:25.708+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
