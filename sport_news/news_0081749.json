Edwards, a member of the Australian National Team, served as team captain at the 2013 and 2015 World University Games. Matteo Morelli (21 goals), Mac Carden (18 goals) and Nick Bell (17 goals) round out the top goal scorers for USC. \nIt will be a marquee match-up on Saturday with two of the top three teams in the nation squaring off. \nThe all-time record is relatively even, with USC dipping below .500 against Stanford since 1979 at 59-60 after its loss to the Cardinal on Sept. 20. Stanford, led by Bret Bonanni with 43 goals, is 12-1 on the season. However, under Vavic, the Trojans are a sturdy 48-17 against the Cardinal. \nAfter that 6-5 loss to the Cardinal in the 2015 Kap7 NorCal Invitational semifinals a couple weeks ago, Bell believes that USC now has a chip on their shoulders to get a win against Stanford. \nUnlike with Stanford, the Trojans have little history against San Jose State because the Spartans’ water polo team is in its first year of existence since 1981, when the program was discontinued. \nThe Spartans have struggled in their first year back, with a 3-8 record thus far under head coach Bruce Watson. \nAfter this weekend’s slate of games at home, USC will participate in the SoCal Tournament hosted by LMU and Pepperdine on Oct. 10-11. \n“I think we can beat any team — it’s just about whether we play our systems and everyone does their role,” Edwards said. “If that happens I think we can beat anyone. I think it will be a much different story this time.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T08:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:44:42.303+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
