(Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times) Zach Helfand Contact Reporter \nAfter the takeout slide that broke New York Mets shortstop Ruben Tejada's leg and shifted the momentum for the Dodgers on Saturday night, Dodgers infielder Chase Utley passed along an apology. \nAccording to Fox Sports' Ken Rosenthal, Utley reached out to the Mets' third baseman, David Wright, to relay the message to Tejada. \nUtley told Rosenthal, \"In no way shape or form was I trying to hurt Ruben. I slid in hard like I have for 12 years. I feel terrible about the outcome.\" \nOn Saturday, after the game, several Mets players said they felt aggrieved by the play. That included Wright. \n\"I have a problem with the play on a number of different levels,\" he said. \nWright called out Utley on a similar play in 2010, when, coincidentally, Utley also slid hard into Tejada at second base.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:20:52.954+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
