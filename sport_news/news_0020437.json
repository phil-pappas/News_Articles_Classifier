Rather, the Burroughs Burros jumped on the Hesperia Scorpions early, putting up 22 unanswered points in the first quarter en route to a 55-21 victory Friday night at Hesperia High School. “Our offense looked good,” said BHS head coach Todd Mather. “We felt we were going to have a bunch of mismatches. Hesperia left the middle of the field wide open for us at times.” The Burros first scored three minutes into the game – after forcing a Hesperia three-and-out – with a Kevin Burgess 1-yard rush. They would score on their next three drives. Quarterback Austin Griffin went 12-18 with 212 yards and three touchdowns in the match. Mekhi Ayers caught two of those scores and added 53 yards. Burgess finished the evening with four carries for 64 yards and two touchdowns. Even the defense made its way to the end zone. Shortly before halftime, Michael McKinney sacked Hesperia quarterback Eddie Gleason to force a fumble that Kenny Dutton picked up and ran back 23 yards for the scoop and score. “We’ve always had a very good, athletic defense,” McKinney said. “When teammates do their jobs, it creates opportunities.” Leading 48-7 at the half, the Burros switched their lineup in the second half, with quarterback Austin McCullough getting some time behind center. Hesperia took advantage of Burros mistakes, however, to score in each quarter after the intermission. “We said we were going to play some guys and work them out,” Mather said. “We got too many penalties in the second half.” The Burros will next visit Apple Valley on Friday.
