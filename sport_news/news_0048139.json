Wilson was unable to manufacture much offense in the first half and the Pirates were in control the rest of the way. \nTop performers : Krauss rushed for 31 yards and two touchdowns and passed 72 yards to Pat Lodwig for another score. Lodwig also rushed for 54 yards and a score, and Matt McGrath added 77 rushing yards and a TD. \nWhat it means : Palisades wins its third game in four tries to square its record at 3-3. Wilson, which fell to 1-5, was unable to use the momentum gained from last week's 21-20 win at Catasauqua to its advantage. \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com .
