Sophomore goalkeeper Hannah Greenburg was stellar in the cage for Catasauqua by stopping 17 shots and giving her team a fighting chance until the end. \nWhat it means : Southern Lehigh finishes an outstanding regular season in the league with just one loss, a 3-1 setback to Moravian Academy. The Spartans found the going tough but persevered to get the win. Catasauqua made an excellent showing and despite the loss, the solid effort should give the Rough Riders some confidence when they compete in the District 11 Class AA playoffs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:52:30.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
