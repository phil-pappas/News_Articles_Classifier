October 25th 2015 /video/video.news.com.au/Sport/Rugby Union/Rugby World Cup/ \nTHE World Cup has done wonders for Sam Whitelock. \nNot only has he made it to his second final in as many tournaments, the towering lock appears to have enjoyed a growth spurt during his stay in the northern part of the world. \nOr so it may seem. \nAfter the All Blacks’ semi-final win against South Africa on Sunday morning (AEDT), Whitelock was snapped shaking the hand of New Zealand Prime Minister John Key. Either Sam Whitelock is part giant, or John Key is part hobbit. \nLooking like something direct from the latest Game of Thrones episode, the second rower towered over the Kiwi PM, making it blatantly obvious that he is no regular-sized human. \nAnd while the smoke and mirrors of a few clever camera angles at the hands of a cheeky photographer may have helped Whitelock create the illusion, the image sends a poignant message to the Wallabies ahead of the World Cup final: The enormity of the All Blacks knows no bounds.
