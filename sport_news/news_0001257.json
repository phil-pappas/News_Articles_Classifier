The Lady Panthers were good, but not quite good enough to make it to the State Finals. Pinckneyville's girls golfers shot a team score of 365, 14 strokes behind the last team to advance from Monday's Carterville Sectional, and Sarah Breslin lost a potential trip to Decatur on a playoff after tying for the final individual spot with an 86. PCHS's Megan Breslin was just one shot back of the top ten not on an advancing team with an 87. Ellie Carlson (96), Trista Ogilvie (96), Graci McDaniel (104) and Erica Crews (119) also took part in the Sectional for the Lady Panthers, who finished fifth out of twelve teams. Massac County fired a 336 led by Carlin Flannery's 75 to take the Sectional crown. Flannery lost in a 7-hole sudden death playoff with Mt. Carmel's Abbey Leighty, who earned the medalist award. Mt. Carmel's team also advanced with a 351, as did second-place Belleville Althoff at 348. Nashville was fourth with a score of 364. The list of ten advancing individuals includes Salem's Megan Gallatin (76), Waterloo's Haley Faus (81), Nashville's Hope Rueter (81), Carterville's Avery Rea (82), Bethalto Civic Memorial's Sara Gwillim (83), Hillsboro's Lindsey Storm (84), Alton Marquette's Carlee Cronin (85), Breese Mater Dei's Mikaleen Lawrence (86), Harrisburg's Alexa Burtis (86) and Roxana's Andrea Mellenthin (86). The Class A State Final Tournament begins on Friday at Decatur's Red Tail Run Golf Course.
