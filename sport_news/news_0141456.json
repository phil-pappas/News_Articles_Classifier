None of us set out and said, 'Hey, let's shoot for 1-3.' We're all disappointed, but at the same time, as men, we have to respond and we have to come back. That's the measure of who we are individually, and it carries you outside of football. \n\"It's a great tool for your life, and then, when we do that, I think it will shape us as a team and we'll start to grow our character as a team. We'll find the positives. We'll find the things to gain out of this. We'll learn from the mistakes, and the main thing is, we'll respond.\" \nAlthough the Browns found a way to fight their way back into the game against the Chargers on multiple occasions, the defense allowed San Diego to score five times on ensuing drives after Cleveland field goals and touchdowns. \n\"That's the best way to sum it up, whoever gets it last is probably going to have the best chance to win the game, especially the way we went into the half,\" McCown said. \"We had it last in the half and got points and tied it up. It did (have) a little back and forth. You look back at these games and every drive is so critical, and a couple of the ones we didn't get going on, I think we'll kick ourselves for.\" \nWhile admitting they were disappointed by the \"heartbreaking\" setback, the Browns' second straight loss overall and second defeat in as many road games to start the season, both McCown and cornerback Tramon Williams feel the team took a positive step against the Chargers. \n\"I felt like everybody battled and fought really hard,\" McCown said. \"When you know it's a game like that where it's going back and forth and if you can just get it last, I don't know, it just hurts when you don't have a chance to have it last because you feel like everybody's fighting. \n\"You come home with a loss, and it doesn't reflect the effort that was put into that game. I'm just really proud and honored to be a part of this team, and the way we fought. I'm proud to say I'm on the Browns because we fought hard and that's all you can ask for.\" \nWilliams added, \"It was a good vibe all game. The guys were together. We stuck together, whether we were up or we were down, and that's big for me. From game one to now, it's totally different. In game one, guys weren't in it after we went down. We were in it the whole time this game, confident. We believed that we would come back and those guys are making progress, so that was a good sign.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RqVBjd TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:15:15.272+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
