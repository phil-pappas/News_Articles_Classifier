However, the reduction in lending rates of the banks is so far less than RBI's 0.5% cut, with state-run SBI and PNB leading the charts with cuts of 0.4% each in its base rate. The base rate is the minimum rate of interest at which a bank lends to its borrowers. Axis Bank cut its base rate by 0.35%, while the reduction by IDBI Bank was 0.25%. Country's largest lender State Bank of India, Andhra Bank and Bank of India were among the first to cut base rate yesterday in the range of 0.20-0.40% in response to RBI's repo rate reduction to 6.75%. While the base rate cut so far has come mostly from public sector lenders, private sector players, except Axis Bank, are expected to follow suit soon. Those announcing the rate cuts today included Bank of Baroda (by 0.25%), Oriental Bank of Commerce (0.20%) and IDBI Bank (0.25%), PNB said its base rate has been cut by 40 basis points to 9.60% from October 1. Soon after the policy rate cut, RBI Governor Raghuram Rajan, as also Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, had yesterday expressed hope that banks will transmit the benefit to borrowers to boost investments and the economy. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:21:45.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
