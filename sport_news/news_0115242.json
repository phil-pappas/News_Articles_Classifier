That night, he gave Andrew Luck fits. Now, four games into his third year, Collins poses as a nightmare for every quarterback on the Patriots schedule.\nAs Cowboys quarterback Brandon Weeden found out Sunday, Collins is here, there and everywhere. One minute, he’s pushing through two blockers for a sack. The next, he’s stuffing a run. The next, he’s forcing the tight end to cough up the ball.\n“Dude’s not human,” safety Devin McCourty said of Collins after the victory over the Cowboys, when he made a team-high 10 tackles and added a forced fumble, his third straight game with one of the latter.\nYesterday, the defensive captain expanded on that comment and added a little more perspective.\n“He was just all over the field in that game,” McCourty said. “He made tackles in the middle, on the sideline. In pass coverage, he was just everywhere, and he was the most energetic player on the defense, talking the whole game. Just seeing him do that at such a high level for 60 minutes was impressive.”\nMcCourty said when the team watches film of their games, Collins typically jumps off the screen.\n“Yeah, I think he’s been doing it all year,” McCourty said, “and Sunday, his energy level was so high, it just got everyone else going. That’s when you’re really becoming a great player, when you energize a whole defense, and hold everyone accountable. At different times we didn’t get off the field on third down, he was the first one barking. I thought that was huge for us.”\nCollins has arrived. He has become that superstar. While he’s quiet, shy, unassuming and not the least bit imposing off the field, he plays loud. Only, the league hasn’t taken full notice of Collins being in that rare stratosphere just yet. While his teammates see it every day, every game, the league is just starting to catch on.\n“Hopefully they start to see him as one of those type of players,” Patriots Hall of Famer Willie McGinest, an NFL Network analyst, told the Herald yesterday. “He’s one of the best linebackers in the game. I think him and (Dont’a) Hightower have been playing at a really high level the last couple of years. If he keeps being consistent and stays healthy, there’s no doubt he will emerge and people will start recognizing him as one of the best.”\nMcGinest said there’s only a handful of others — Carolina’s Luke Kuechly, Seattle’s Bobby Wagner and K.J. Wright, Baltimore’s C.J. Mosely — who can do all the things Collins does.\n“He’s just bigger,” McGinest said of Collins, who is 6-foot-4, 250 pounds.\nCollins impacts practically every play. If he’s not making the play, he’s helping someone else to make one.\n“He’s a heck of an athlete, a freakish athlete, and any time you’ve got a freakish guy like that on the field, he’s going to draw a lot of attention,” defensive end Jabaal Sheard said. “He does a good job getting penetration on the line. I just play off of him.”\nPlaying off of Collins on Sunday meant two sacks, one quarterback hit and three hurries for Sheard.\nDefensive end Rob Ninkovich has watched Collins mature and grow from being that rookie in the Colts playoff game with so much promise, or “wow factor” as Ninkovich called it, to something even better.\nThe difference between Collins then and now has a lot to do with the linebacker learning from all of his game experience, and understanding the game and defense better.\n“He still has the wow factor, and I think I said back then, with experience he’s going to be even better,” said Ninkovich. “Having that game experience has made him grow as a player. His experience and his athleticism, and all the things he can do, with his intelligence, have all helped him become a really great football player. But he’s still going to grow.”\nNinkovich also touched on Collins and his football smarts, something that gets overlooked due to his athleticism. But Collins is an intelligent player. He has to be, or else he wouldn’t get the green dot as the signal caller.\nIf Hightower, who suffered a rib injury vs. the Cowboys, can’t play, Collins will add that role to his duties against the Colts on Sunday.\nSaid McGinest: “I’ve always thought he was one of the rare prototypes, the (coach Bill) Belichick-style-type linebackers: A big guy that’s physical in the run, that’s versatile enough like we were, (Mike) Vrabel and myself, that could play in the pass and hold up physically in the run game. I just think Matt (Patricia, the Pats defensive coordinator) has done a great job of utilizing him in a lot of different aspects.”\nAnd why not? As McCourty says, “Dude’s not human.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T08:25:04.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
