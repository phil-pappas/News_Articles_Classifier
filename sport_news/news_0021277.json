SAD secretary and spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said it was shameful that the Congress leaders were trying to gain political mileage out of an issue that had hurt sentiments of the Punjabis in general and Sikhs in particular. “Similar blunders of the Congress had been responsible for the turmoil in the past and these leaders are now trying to repeat the same,” he said. Urging all political parties to show restraint and maturity in dealing with such issues, he said the people of the state were closely watching actions and behaviour of political leaders. Education Minister Cheema also appealed to the youth to be wary of the nefarious designs of anti-Punjab elements. He described the videos and pictures pertaining to the sacrilege and the police firing killing two protesters as “fake and manipulated” ones. Condemning the incidents of sacrilege of Guru Granth Sahib in different parts of the state, he said these incidents had hurt sentiments of the Sikh community. “Provocation of the masses was natural under such circumstances, but it is high time for the community to perform its duties in such a manner that we emerge stronger than ever,” he said. The SAD was committed to expose the conspiracy behind this episode, he added.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:12:55.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
