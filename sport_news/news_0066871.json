When he comes back we will check and then we will see.\" \nReplays showed Sainz lost control of his STR10 approaching the corner, hitting the outside wall before running through the run-off area and into the barriers. \n\"The car was lost under braking, but we need to find out the reason,\" Tost added. \"We need the car for this, but at the minute it looks like nothing was broken.\" \nDue to the extensive damage done to the track barriers during Sainz's crash, the GP3 race which was due to follow Practice Three was cancelled.
