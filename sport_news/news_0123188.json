The points will make students eligible for prizes and experiences, as well as factor into student seating and game selections for the 2016-17 men's basketball season.\n\"Making the Crimson Guard student section and rewards program all-in-one is a great way to reward students for attending IU sporting events,\" Student Athletic Board President Samantha Feather said. \"They can watch their points add up on their mobile devices which makes it more fun for students.\"\nFeather added that it creates a better home game atmosphere for fans and will reward those who consistently attend games. The Crimson Guard's reward program is available through FanMaker.\nStudents can sign up for the Crimson Guard Student Reward app on iPhone or Android by visiting iucrimsonguard.com . They are all eligible to join by visiting the website and creating an account using an IU email address.\nOpening the app when entering an IU Athletics event with Bluetooth and GPS location on allows students to check in without using a student ID. Additional points are rewarded for sharing selected Facebook, Instagram or Twitter posts. Students will also be made aware of specials and sales at concessions stands and the Varsity Shop.\nBeacons located at the entrances of venues will track when fans arrive and how long they stay for more points.\nBrody Miller", "external_links": ["http://iucrimsonguard.com/"], "published": "2015-10-09T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:50:15.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
