He asks a lot of questions, studies a lot of film, and he wants to get better.\" \nThat in turn has allowed Montgomery to start playing faster because he has a better idea of what is expected of him,\" Jones said. \nThe low-key Montgomery doesn't seem overwhelmed. MVP quarterback Aaron Rodgers has given a lot of praise to Montgomery since the newcomer's arrival in the spring. \nRodgers continued to throw accolades Montgomery's way Monday, when the rookie instinctively broke off his inside route with the coverage shaded that way and veered to the outside to get in position for an open 8-yard touchdown catch early in the game. \n\"I thought Ty had a good second-reaction play for a touchdown,\" Rodgers said. \nIt was Montgomery's first scoring play. He has six receptions for 51 yards this season. \nThe adjustment for Montgomery from college football after a productive four-year career as a receiver and a kick returner at Stanford hasn't been without some setbacks, however. He was penalized for offensive pass interference and illegal use of hands in back-to-back series for the Packers in Monday's game. \nMontgomery didn't agree with the interference call for making downfield contact, which wiped out a touchdown pass from Rodgers to Randall Cobb. \n\"They never call it, but they called it,\" Montgomery said. \"It's the rules. Whatever.\" \nNOTE: S Morgan Burnett (calf) is questionable for Sunday. The veteran starter hasn't practiced this week after being out Monday for the second time this season. \"He's getting better,\" McCarthy said \"He's definitely closer.\" Cobb (shoulder) and RB Eddie Lacy (ankle) are probable for the game. \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T03:30:18.724+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
