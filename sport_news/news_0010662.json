(USATSI) \n\nAfter a night remembering the Chicago Blackhawks ' 2015 Stanley Cup title, the New York Rangers stole the show pretty quick once the game actually started. A three-goal first period for New York following a lengthy banner-raising ceremony sunk the Blackhawks and spoiled the party a bit in a 3-2 Rangers victory.\nMaybe there was some early sluggishness from the Blackhawks, but the Rangers also started hot. New York's speed remains one of their great assets and Henrik Lundqvist was sharp all night. And the Blackhawks actually recovered in the second period and started playing like we're used to seeing.\nThe game was pretty darn entertaining from start to finish, though. It did end with some controversy as the Blackhawks had appeared to tie the game on a Patrick Kane tip-in with a minute to go, but it was waved off after it was determined the referee was attempting to blow his whistle to kill the play. You can see video and the NHL's explanation of the decision here .\nSince this is the first game of the season, we're not about to make any sweeping proclamations about either team or any of the players. That said, here's a quick look at three things that stood out in a game featuring two really strong clubs.\n1. Henrik Lundqvist looked like Henrik Lundqvist \nWhen the New York Rangers needed their goaltender most, he was there. Lundqvist made 32 saves in the season-opening win, including the initial stop on Jonathan Toews that preceded the whistle that ended up negating Patrick Kane's would-be tying goal. Somehow Lundqvist got enough of his pad on Toews' redirect to make the play. That preserved the 3-2 lead.\nThe only two goals that Lundqvist gave up were on scoring chances that were whatever better than \"Grade A\" is. Both goals came via open looks in the slot from Chicago forwards that most goalies in the league are not going to be able to stop. A little help from the defense on either would have been nice for the veteran netminder.\nOverall, this was a solid first night out for Lundqvist. We all know the clock is ticking for him. At 33, he's reaching the years that a lot of goalies start the downward trend. The team needs him to be sharp this year, especially now that the very capable Cam Talbot is no longer backing him up. So it was a pretty impressive opening statement from The King.\n2. Chicago's kids were all right \nThe Blackhawks had a lot of new faces on the roster as part of their tumultuous summer of turnover. Some of the holes were filled by veteran acquisitions in trades, but they'll also need some big performances from their younger guys in substantial roles.\nThe Blackhawks have second-year forward Teuvo Teravainen on their top line with Marian Hossa and Jonathan Toews, while Russian rookie Artemi Panarin is on the second line with Artem Anisimov and Patrick Kane. Both Teravainen and Panarin scored the goals for the Blackhawks.\nBoth also saw the benefit of playing with good players as each had wide-open looks from the slot and perfect passes from veteran teammates. If they continue to have veterans making space for them on the ice, Teravainen could be due for a breakout campaign, while Panarin will be among the most exciting rookies to watch this year.\n3. The Rangers may be on to something with their All-American line \nThe Rangers trotted out a line featuring Chris Kreider , Derek Stepan and Kevin Hayes that tended to give Chicago some trouble. The all-American trio combined for the Rangers' third goal on a tremendous effort and clever play from Hayes to chip a puck that Stepan eventually knocked home.\nKreider may have been the real standout though. His speed routinely put opposing defenders on their heels, but he was also incredibly strong on the puck. After notching 21 goals last season, he could be due for an even bigger step forward this year if he puts everything together.\nAs a whole, the Rangers kind of tapered off over the course of the game as the Blackhawks continually got their legs under them, but this line's performance early helped put New York in a position to win the game.\nThere seems to be just the right mix of skill, speed and strength that could make this an effective group going forward. They just may give a lot of teams trouble if they manage to stay together.\nTopics: Artem Anisimov , Artemi Panarin , Cam Talbot , Chris Kreider , Derek Stepan , Henrik Lundqvist , Jonathan Toews , Kevin Hayes , Marian Hossa , Patrick Kane , Teuvo Teravainen , Chicago Blackhawks , New York Rangers , NHL", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T10:09:30.210+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
