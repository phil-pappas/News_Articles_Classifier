An MRI on Monday confirmed the tear. \nEarlier Monday, Coach Andy Reid said that \"the worst case is the ACL is torn. That's probably the direction it's heading.\" \nCharles was making a cut deep in Bears territory when his right knee buckled at a gruesome angle. The four-time Pro Bowl selection needed help to get off the field. \nCharles tore the ACL in his other knee four years ago, missing most of the season. \nArizona is said to sign Freeney \nThe Arizona Cardinals have signed veteran defensive end-outside linebacker Dwight Freeney to a one-year contract, a person with knowledge of the situation said. (Sam Farmer) \nThe person spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because the signing had not been officially announced by the club. \nThe move comes after the Cardinals' top outside pass rusher, Alex Okafor , went down with a calf injury in Sunday's 42-17 victory at Detroit. \nThe 35-year-old Freeney, a seven-time Pro Bowl player and three-time first team All Pro, ranks 21st in the NFL in career sacks with 111 1/2 and led the league with 16 sacks in 2004. \nLuck's shoulder 'feeling better' \nIndianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck was a full participant in Monday's practice for the first time in two weeks, though his availability for this weekend's showdown with New England remains unknown. \nLuck is still day to day because of a sore right shoulder and had been limited in practice since leading Indianapolis to a 35-33 win at Tennessee on Sept. 27. \n\"It feels better every day,\" Luck said. \nBackup quarterback Matt Hasselbeck threw for 213 yards and two touchdowns to lead the Colts to a 27-20 win at Houston and he threw for 282 yards and a touchdown in a 16-13 overtime win at Jacksonville. \nEtc. \nCleveland Browns star cornerback Joe Haden will probably miss one game because of a concussion sustained during an overtime win Sunday at Baltimore. ... Miami Dolphins special teams coordinator Darren Rizzi has been promoted to assistant head coach by interim Coach Dan Campbell . ... Atlanta Falcons center Mike Person , who left Sunday's win over Washington because of a sprained ankle, is expected to miss Thursday night's game at New Orleans. ... The Chicago Bears have lost backup running back Jacquizz Rodgers for the season because of a fractured arm. ... New York Jets defensive end Sheldon Richardson has returned to practice after serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's substance abuse policy. ... Buffalo Bills running back Cierre Wood will miss the remainder of the season because of a knee injury. The Bills filled Wood's roster spot by activating defensive end Ikemefuna Enemkpali , who finished serving a four-game suspension for violating the NFL's player personal conduct policy. Enemkpali was suspended for a punch that broke the jaw of New York Jets quarterback Geno Smith during a locker room altercation in Aug.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T06:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:30:33.990+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
