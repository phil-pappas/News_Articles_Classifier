Kela walked toward home plate and began trading words with Donaldson.\nTexas catcher Chris Gimenez and plate umpire Vic Carapazza quickly stepped between the two, and the order was restored a few moments later. Donaldson stared intently at Kela as the rookie right-hander returned to the mound.\nDonaldson eventually struck out on a dropped third strike and was thrown out at first base.\nIt was the second time in this postseason that benches had cleared.
