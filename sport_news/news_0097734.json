Their ascension to baseball’s grandest stage validates their adherence to a plan born of necessity and based on prudence, pitching — and a whole lot of patience.\nBefore this season, when they won 90 games and lost 72, the Mets had endured six losing years in a row. No team in the majors had a longer active streak of futility.\nComplicating matters was the Bernard L. Madoff fraud scheme, which had a direct effect on the Mets, embarrassed the team, strained its finances and undermined public confidence in the club’s lead owner, Fred Wilpon .\n Related Coverage After the Sweep: It’s No Time for Complacency OCT. 22, 2015 Mets 8, Cubs 3: Mets, Team of Big Shoulders, Sweep Cubs to Reach World Series OCT. 21, 2015 On Baseball: At the Plate, an Owner Calls His Shot FEB. 17, 2011 Mets Announce Sandy Alderson Deal and Say Terry Collins Will Return SEPT. 23, 2014 Sports of The Times: Pardon the Disorientation, but the Mets Are on the Verge of the World Series OCT. 21, 2015 Alderson Makes It Clear: Mets Won’t Spend a Bundle This Winter DEC. 8, 2014 Book on Sandy Alderson Set for Release as Mets Try to Turn Page MARCH 13, 2015 Mets Envision Playoffs, and Idea Isn’t So Blurry FEB. 20, 2015 Sports of The Times: Madoff Had Everything to Do With Reyes’s Leaving DEC. 5, 2011 But on Wednesday, after the Mets beat the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field to win the National League pennant, the deliberate approach the Mets had taken through all the defeats and difficulties was being toasted with Champagne. And as the celebration went on around him, Jeff Wilpon, the son of the owner and the team’s chief operating officer, was asked what made him most proud of the team’s vision.\nPhoto Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson, far left, with Jeff Wilpon, the team's chief operating officer, before Game 1 of the N.L.C.S. Credit Jason Szenes for The New York Times “That we stuck to it,” he said.\nIt was a vision actually conceived and executed by the Mets’ general manager, Sandy Alderson , who was hired from the commissioner’s office after the 2010 season and inherited a team with significant promise in the minors but a roster of bloated salaries in the majors.\nHis opening day payroll for 2011 included $18.25 million for players released in spring training (Luis Castillo and Oliver Perez), $22.5 million for an injured pitching star (Johan Santana), and almost $40 million for two veteran outfielders — one a severe disappointment (Jason Bay), and the other, Carlos Beltran, an already aging player who would be traded that summer.\n“I was here, and we did it for certain reasons,” said John Ricco, the assistant general manager, who has worked for the Mets since 2004, was part of the team’s spending binge before Alderson arrived and knew the team needed to take a different approach.\n“When you’re trying to just get out from under it,” Ricco said in reference to the bad contracts the Mets had saddled themselves with, “it’s so fresh in your memory you’re not going back there too quickly.” So for the next three seasons — 2012 through 2014 — the Mets operated with a payroll of under $100 million. Teams in much smaller markets, like Cincinnati, Milwaukee and Minneapolis, sometimes spent more on player salaries than the big-market Mets did. The crosstown Yankees routinely spent more than twice as much as the Mets, who began this season with a payroll of just over $100 million.\nAdvertisement\n For the Mets, Alderson said, spending lavishly on free-agent talent was simply not an option in those seasons anyway, not with the Madoff issue lurking in the background. But it may have been wise all along. Across the baseball landscape, teams pay premium prices for faded, injury-prone veterans. That problem no longer plagues the Mets.\nAlderson said Wednesday that acquiring “marquee players who’ve performed well in the past is always a temptation and a potential solution to whatever problems a team may have.” But, he said, “history tells us that it doesn’t always work out.”\nAdvertisement\n “In fact,” he added, “it works out rarely.”\n Sports Newsletter Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, with distinctive takes on games and some behind-the-scenes surprises, delivered to your inbox every week.\nSo, Alderson said, the Mets, under his direction, found it easier to just say “no” to big signings. “And now we’ve gotten accustomed to it,” he said. “It’s worked out pretty well for us.”\nAll around, there is evidence of extravagant spending working poorly for the Mets’ rivals. Six of the teams among the top 10 in opening day payroll (Boston, Detroit, San Francisco, Washington, the Los Angeles Angels and Philadelphia) did not reach the postseason. The Yankees were ousted in one game.\nIn the first round, the Mets beat the Los Angeles Dodgers, whose payroll has swollen to about $300 million, by far the highest in the majors. In the final two games, the Dodgers did not even bother to start outfielder Carl Crawford, a once-dynamic speedster who is now a barely league-average performer. He makes $21 million per season through 2017.\nThe Mets have signed one player to a nine-figure contract under Alderson: their third baseman and captain, David Wright, who accepted an eight-year, $138 million extension in December 2012 that carries him through 2020. While Wright has struggled to stay healthy, he has generally performed as a star and had been a reliable spokesman for their brand.\nUnder Alderson, the Mets traded Beltran and another holdover, pitcher R. A. Dickey, to acquire the injured starter Zack Wheeler and the hard-throwing right-hander Noah Syndergaard. The other young starters — Matt Harvey, Jacob deGrom and Steven Matz — were drafted under Omar Minaya but largely developed by Alderson’s staff.\n“For all of us, when you’ve done it for a while, you’ve got to have patience because you know it isn’t going to happen overnight,” said Manager Terry Collins, 66, the Mets’ former minor league field coordinator, who has been in charge in the dugout since Alderson took over as general manager. “Sandy had to do a lot of manipulating of the roster, and we traded some great players. But we knew down the road we were going to have to have good pitching.”\nThe young starters are years away from free agency, and the veteran Bartolo Colon, 42, has been an unlikely bargain as he finishes a two-year, $20 million free agent deal. But the Mets will face difficult decisions this winter about two of their best hitters, outfielder Yoenis Cespedes and second baseman Daniel Murphy — October’s slugging sensation — who are both facing free agency.\nThe Mets’ recent, somewhat tentative, steps into the free-agent market have produced mixed results. Right fielder Curtis Granderson — halfway through a four-year, $60 million deal — has provided solid value. Left fielder Michael Cuddyer — halfway through a two-year, $21 million deal — has largely given way to a rookie, Michael Conforto.\nPhoto Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson traded several marquee players. Credit Ben Solomon for The New York Times Taken together, though, both deals are successful, because the Mets are in the World Series.\n“In baseball, you could say, ‘Hey, we had a really efficient payroll, we had all these young guys and they performed way better than the payroll, and we won 73 games’ — no one’s going to care,” said Paul DePodesta, the Mets’ vice president for player development and amateur scouting and an executive who inspired a character in the movie “Moneyball” from his years with the low-budget Oakland Athletics.\nAdvertisement\n Advertisement\n What ultimately matters, he said, is “how many games you win.”\n“That absolute return is the most important thing,” he said.\nThe Mets’ return is a National League pennant and a chance at a third franchise championship. Alderson said he doubted the team had proved anything in its discipline along the way.\n“Process is designed to enhance probabilities,” Alderson said. “It’s not designed to insure anything. So a lot of things have to go right. There’s a lot of luck involved.”\nLuck, in the form of a title, has eluded Alderson since 1989, when he was general manager of the Oakland Athletics. He gave his championship ring to his father, John, who treasured it and wore it often. Alderson has the ring now, after his father’s death in 2010. He still does not wear it and said he never would.\n“I gave it to him; it’s his,” Alderson said. “I honor him with that memory.”\nThere is another reason, he added, for not wearing the ring. It would remind him, Alderson said, of how long he has gone without one. The 26-year interval, he suggested, was too long. The Mets know the feeling, and now they can end the wait.", "external_links": ["http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/22/sports/SUB-22mets1/SUB-22mets1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/Y-KEPNER-2/Y-KEPNER-2-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/23/sports/Y-BASE/Y-BASE-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/02/18/sports/ARATON1/ARATON1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/Y-KEPNER-2/Y-KEPNER-2-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/14/sports/13alderson-1/13alderson-1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/09/sports/baseball/09mets/09mets-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/12/06/sports/baseball/06vecseySUB/06vecseySUB-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/CITY-JP-KEPNER/CITY-JP-KEPNER-articleLarge.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/23SWEEPweb1/23SWEEPweb1-thumbStandard.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/23/sports/CITY-JP-KEPNER/CITY-JP-KEPNER-superJumbo.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/22/sports/22POWELLweb1/22POWELLweb1-thumbStandard-v2.jpg", "http://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/21/sports/21METS2-hp/21METS2-hp-thumbStandard.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T05:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:13:05.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
