But I feel like we're a great defense as well and we have to continue to have that mindset so no matter what team we play or what individual we play we have to give it our best and they're going to know they played the Air Force Falcons by the end of the game.\" \nWalker revealed how he intends to play Reynolds whenever he carries the ball down the line of scrimmage. \n\"Mainly, I'm the pitch key read, so the quarterback pitches off me,\" Walker said. \"So when I slow play it, I'll let the rest of my team rally to the ball and when he finally pitches the ball, if he does pitch the ball, I think having the speed in order to come off of him and get to the pitch back, I think that helps me out a lot.\" \nWalker said he's also not too worried about fullback Chris Swain, who has used his 245-pound frame to run over many a linebacker during his career. Walker has been fighting through the pain of a stinger, but said that won't stop him from taking on Swain. \n\"I'm not scared of anybody,\" Walker said. \"If it was me and him in the hole, I'm taking me 100 percent of the time. That's just how I feel. I think that's the attitude you have to have to play the game, especially playing defense. You can't be scared or afraid to play anybody. If I met the fullback in the hole, he'd know he met me in the hole.\" \nPREPARED FOR TRICKERY: Air Force fooled Navy last year with a trick play as quarterback Kale Pearson lateraled to wide receiver Jalen Robinette, who then stopped and tossed a 54-yard touchdown pass to Garrett Brown. \nBrown was wide open because the Navy cornerback responsible for covering him came up to play the run. \nIt has been commonplace for Air Force to pull out a trick play in this game and the Navy coaching staff has repeatedly reminded the defensive players of that fact. Will Anthony said defensive line coach Shaun Nua has shown film of the Falcons running a reverse numerous times this week to remind the ends to stay home in certain instances. \n\"Really every year they do that. Every year they've got some trick plays,\" Niumatalolo said. \"We've just got to be good with our eyes. This game always comes down to that: who can limit big plays, who can take care of the ball, least amount of penalties.\" \nDOUBLE SECRET PROBATION: Air Force head coach Troy Calhoun announced this week that defensive back Gavin McHenry will be available to play against Navy. McHenry, a two-year starter, has successfully completed six months of conduct/aptitude probation and is now considered a cadet in good standing. \nMcHenry had been restricted from participating in intercollegiate athletic competitions due to an undisclosed incident in March. He has been allowed to practice with the football team and last week was taking repetitions with the second unit, according to the Colorado Springs Gazette. \nSACK PACK: Navy has already recorded seven sacks through three games this season with defensive end Amos Mason and outside linebacker Kevin McCoy credited with 1 Â½ apiece. That is one shy of the number of sacks the Midshipmen totaled in 13 games last season. \n\"We know we have to pick our spots and have some intelligence about how we come after people, but quarterbacks are too good these days,\" Niumatalolo said. \"You can't let (quarterbacks) sit back there and survey the field. Even if you don't sack them, you need to get them to move around. I've been pleased with the way we have pressured the quarterback.\" \nPUNTING COMPETITION: Alex Barta nailed down the starting punter job with his performance last Saturday against Connecticut. Barta boomed a 43-yard punt with great hang time that was downed at the 1-yard line thanks to a great hustle play by linebacker Ryan Harris. He later delivered a 41-yard punt that was downed at the 10-yard line. \nBarta, whose first collegiate punt was a 72-yarder against Colgate, is averaging 49.5 yards on four attempts. Going into the Connecticut game, Niumatalolo still had not decided between Barta and Gavin Jernigan and therefore gave them both a chance to kick. Jernigan's lone punt last Saturday was a subpar 32-yarder.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:57:30.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
