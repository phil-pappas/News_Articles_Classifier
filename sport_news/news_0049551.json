The Trojans finish their season at 12-11. CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nNEW WASHINGTON - The Buckeye Central Buckettes are on a roll. \nThere may not be many more words to describe the level of play that the Buckettes are showing as they picked up a sectional championship Thursday night. Buckeye Central hosted the championship match and welcomed the South Central Trojans rather rudely, serving them a three-set defeat, 25-14, 25-13 and 25-23. \nBuckeye Central has not tasted defeat since Sept. 29, when they hosted Northern 10 Champ Upper Sandusky. Since then, the Buckettes have dropped just three sets in route to a nine-game winning streak. \n“It is the start of our tournament run tonight so this title means a lot but we know it is just the beginning,” Reinhart said. \nThe Buckettes started off in dominating fashion taking the first two sets without much of a fight. Claire Songer served for five points in the set and Bailey Agin recorded nine service points to pace the Buckeye Central effort. But it was defensively where the Buckettes shined. They allowed just four service points total in the first set by South Central, and four more in the second set. \nThe third set saw a lapse in focus from Buckeye Central and the Trojans took advantage. They commanded most of the third set and even took a 20-18 lead at one point. But the Buckettes responded to take the two-point win and close out the match. \n“It is girls volleyball at its finest,” Reinhart added. “It is a roller coaster sometimes but they were able to go out and get the job done and at the end of the night that is all that matters.” Buy Photo \nSouth Central libero Hannah Vogel looks to return the ball during warmup before the sectional title game Thursday.

The match was a representative of the type of season South Central has had. \n“It has been a fun season and we have grown so much from the beginning of the year to this point,” Trojan coach Sara Hohler said. “The season was kind of like the match tonight. We started really slow then started to pick it up towards the end.” \nSarah Oney shined for the Trojans. The lefty sent down 10 kills on the evening. Lexie Adams contributed with six kills and four blocks. Madison Albert and Hannah Vogel both recorded four service points. \n“I am very proud of both of my seniors, Hannah Oney and Hannah Vogel, and we will miss them a lot,” Hohler added. “We have a lot of young girls and we learned something each night and it made us stronger as the season rolled along.” Buy Photo \nBuckette setter Addie Ackerman gets in a warm up before the sectional title game.

Karl recorded 15 kills and five serving points including an ace. Delarber set down 13 kills and blocked two shots. It was Heydinger that made the hustle plays sending down 11 kills and blocking 10 shots including two blocks on the final point and smacked down her final kill to end the match. \n“Sarah gets after it. You tell her to give 100 percent and she will go out and give you 110. It is just the kind of player she is and we love her for it,” Reinhart added. \nSonger and Addie Ackerman finished with 10 serving points each, Ackerman chipped in four kills. Agin ended the evening with nine serving points and four aces. Erin Baldosser served for five points and recorded three kills. \nThe Buckettes earned the Division IV Sectional title and a trip to Willard to face the winner of St. Paul and No. 2 ranked Old Fort. They will be back in action at 8 p.m. Tuesday for the district semifinals.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T04:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:11:26.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
