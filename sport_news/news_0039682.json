John Kasich's presidential efforts here, the campaign announced Wednesday. Joining her will be a handful of other high-profile state Republicans, including DuPage County Board Chairman Dan Cronin. \"As a leader in a state very similar to Ohio, I understand the significance of his accomplishments,\" Radogno said in a statement. \"Kasich's record of success serves as a model for other Midwestern states, and it is little wonder that 62 percent of Ohioans approve of the job he's doing.\" Also on Kasich's list: State Reps. Ron Sandack of Downers Grove, Ed Sullivan of Mundelein and David Harris of Arlington Heights. Former Illinois Republican Party Chairman Pat Brady of St. Charles is on the list, too, along with Cook County Republican Chairman Aaron Del Mar. Radogno's Republican colleague in the House, Leader Jim Durkin, is backing former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, as is former House Republican Leader Tom Cross and former Gov. Jim Edgar. State Sens. Michael Connelly of Lisle and Jim Oberweis of Sugar Grove are among those behind Florida Sen. Marco Rubio. Illinois' primary isn't among the first in the nation next year, but the state's vote could matter to a field that's been narrowed down to a few candidates by March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T01:58:05.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
