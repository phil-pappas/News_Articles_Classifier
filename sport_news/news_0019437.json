He carried the ball 59 times for 421 yards and scored nine touchdowns, while throwing a 19-yard pass for another score and returning a punt 86 yards for an 11th touchdown. All told, the senior accounted for 597 total yards.\nBrady Burse, Olive Branch: One week after setting OB single-game records for completions and attempts in a loss to South Panola, Burse set two more records against DeSoto Central. He completed 20 of 34 passes for a record 354 yards and eight touchdowns. Burse also ran for a ninth score as Olive Branch improved to 4-3.\nDEFENSE\nNickell Herron, Southwind: The Jaguars have one of the top defenses in the area this year and Herron, a 6-1, 180-pound senior linebacker, has been one of the main reasons why. Last Friday against Overton, he had 10 tackles and recovered a fumble as Southwind held the Wolverines to just 33 total yards in a 40-0 victory.\nNominations: Coaches can nominate candidates for Player of the Week by emailing john.varlas@commercialappeal.com.
