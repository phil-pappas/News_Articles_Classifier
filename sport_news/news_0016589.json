(AP Photo) Comments \nOne-quarter of the way through his rookie NFL season, Oakland Raiders quarterback Amari Cooper has 24 receptions for 339 yards and two touchdowns. Keep that up for the rest of the season, the former Alabama All-American would finish 2015 with 96 catches for 1,356 yards and eight touchdowns. That would put him on the cusp of breaking the NFL rookie record for receiving yards of 1,377 yards set by Anquan Boldin in 2003. \nCooper is not impressed. \n\"I'm not really pleased with my first four games,\" Cooper said after practice on Tuesday. \"There's always room for improvement. It's why I'm here today. It's why I'm here tomorrow. To get better.\" \nWhile Cooper has not impressed himself, he has made an impression on opposing defensive coordinators. Oakland quarterback Derek Carr said the Chicago Bears double-covered Cooper during most of their game last week. The Bears held Cooper to four catches for 49 yards, but he caught a touchdown pass. That came after Cooper became the first Raiders receiver since Randy Moss in 2005 to post back-to-back 100-yard games. \nRELATED: SEE THE AMARI COOPER TD THAT FOOLED THE REFS \nCooper has been working this week to face the first AFC West rival of his career.
