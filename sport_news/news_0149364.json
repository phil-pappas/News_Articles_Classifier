So much talent,\" Teravainen said Monday after practice. \"They want to win a lot. I (will) just try to enjoy my chance and try to be myself with those guys.\"\nAt the Hawks convention this summer, Quenneville said he'd like to see the 21-year-old Teravainen center a line this season. For now, that plan has been scrapped.\n\"It's a big step,\" Quenneville said of playing with Toews and Hossa. \"But it's real, good quality ice time when you play with those guys. Not an easy job, but certainly we feel he's capable of playing the offensive side of things, and the defensive side as well.\"\nMarko Dano had first crack at the Lottery Line early in camp but was reassigned to Rockford last week. Andrew Shaw also had a look but centered the third line at practice Monday with Bryan Bickell and Kyle Baun as the wingers.\nKeeping Teravainen out of the middle helps alleviate some of the responsibilities that go with playing center. Putting him with Toews and Hossa also means he will see many of the league's top defensemen each night.\nHow long will the line stay together? Quenneville hopes all 82 games, but the veteran coach isn't the most patient man when things aren't working.\n\"I don't know if the word is impatient,\" Quenneville said. \"You can call it whatever you want. It's the way it is. It's a competitive world out there and it's about winning today. If it can make our team better, or we're looking for a different kind of balance (we'll change it up).\"\nIt's amazing to think how far Teravainen has come, considering his NHL resume consists of just 52 games (18 of which came in the playoffs). The Hawks took their time with the young Finn, letting his game mature in Rockford last year, then easing him into a role as an NHL player.\nNow, in addition to playing on the top line, Teravainen also will be on the ice during power plays, 4-on-4s and 3-on-3 in OT.\n\"His overall game both ways puts him where he's not slotted in one area,\" Quenneville said. \"He can do a lot of things.\"\nIt will be interesting to see how much Teravainen will grow in the coming weeks and months. One thing's for sure: He'd love to punch that Toews-Hossa lottery ticket all the way through April and beyond.\n\"Of course, I want to be in that line,\" Teravianen said. \"I have to work hard every day to be on that line.\"\nBickell better: Coach Joel Quenneville was impressed with Bryan Bickell's play during the Hawks' 4-0 preseason win over Dallas on Saturday. Bickell, who was placed on waivers the day before, was credited with 5 hits and nearly beat Antti Niemi with a shot in the first period.\n\"Liked his game,\" Quenneville said. \"Thought he had a real good game. Much more effective, more noticeable, more consistent.\"\nHe said it: \"Too bad we can't watch them. We'll be rooting for them.\"\nJoel Quenneville on not being able to view the Cubs-Pirates wild-card game Wednesday\nGet great articles like this sent to your inbox!
