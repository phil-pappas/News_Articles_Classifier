He stood beyond the 3-point arc but didn't hesitate. Randolph caught the pass and calmly buried the long-range shot.\nHe was hot, and that was mostly evident throughout the first half of the Grizzlies' 91-81 preseason victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers on Monday night in Value City Arena at The Schottenstein Center.\nRandolph was mostly low-key in the Grizzlies' first two preseason games. At this stage of Randolph's career, another early October game would seem an occasion for another light workout.\nBut the veteran forward went at the Cavs from the opening tip as if they were playing in June.\n\"It was good to see Zach get a good run in. You know, doing the things we normally look for him to do,\" Griz point guard Mike Conley said. \"He looked really good. I was glad he was able to get that aggression back.\"\nRandolph's 14 points tied Cavs forward LeBron James for a game high. Randolph made 7 of 12 shots and routinely used his familiar jab step on the perimeter to keep Cavs center Timofey Mozgov off balance while making midrange shot after midrange shot.\n\"I was trying to get a feel with my shot and just being aggressive,\" Randolph said. \"Earlier in camp, I was trying to help the young guys out and work my way into it. … It's been important for me to get my legs strong and get my wind so I can run with these guys.\"\nEntering his 15th NBA season, Randolph clearly doesn't need much time to find his scoring touch. Randolph, however, didn't attempt a free throw or grab an offensive rebound. He didn't attack the basket often and instead punished the Cavs from the perimeter.\n\"He made his first shot and then got going,\" coach Dave Joerger said. \"He knows himself and how he wants to pace himself. He knows what's more important. I can't honestly say that he enjoys the preseason. It's a tough deal when guys have been doing it so many years. Yet he's been a real professional.\"\nThe game, held at Ohio State, was supposed to be Conley's sweet homecoming. Conley played one season for the Buckeyes before entering the NBA draft and becoming the fourth overall pick by the Griz in 2007.\nConley received a warm, loud ovation during player introductions and then great attention from the Cavs' defense. Conley missed his only three field goal attempts but had nine assists.\n\"I was trying to get 20 assists,\" Conley said. \"They were playing it in a way to get the ball out of my hands to make plays so I just played the game and did what was there.\"\nThe Cavs played without guard Kyrie Irving and forward Kevin Love, who are still rehabilitating from injuries suffered last season. Memphis' deft shooting and aggressive defense didn't give the Ohio State crowd and Cavs faithful much to cheer.\nJames eventually produced a highlight moment in the third quarter when the crowd stood to watch the Cavs forward finish a fast break with an uncontested tomahawk slam.\nNeither team played key players in the fourth quarter when the Griz comfortably held a double-digit lead.\nAll was not good for the Griz, though.\nAlthough Tony Allen returned after missing last Thursday's game against Maccabi Haifa because of a sore elbow, backup point guard Beno Udrih sprained his right ankle in the second quarter.\nUdrih landed awkwardly after being fouled on a jump shot. He writhed in pain for several minutes before hobbling to the bench. Udrih returned to shoot free throws after a timeout but immediately committed a foul to leave the game.\nHe didn't return.\n\"It's a little sore,\" Udrih said. \"But it's not anything like what I had in the playoffs. There's a little swelling so I'll just be day-to-day.\"\nTip-in: The Griz will host fans for their annual open practice Tuesday from 1-2 p.m. in FedExForum. Festivities tip off at noon with a plaza party outside the arena. There will be food trucks, a stage with a DJ and plenty of face painting, balloons and more. Doors to the practice open at 12:30 p.m. and free parking will be available in the Toyota Parking Garage off Dr. Martin Luther King Avenue.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T12:26:02.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
