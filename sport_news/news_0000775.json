The Polar Bears (7-3-3) out-shot G-A, 23-5 and had 17 corners to four for the Devils. \nDevil coach Rebecca Farson said, \"Jenna Carty and Mackenzie Oberholzer were my stars today. Carty consistently lifted the ball 40 yards downfield to advance play and prevented many players from taking a shot. When Northern was able to push into the circle for a shot, Oberholzer calmly cleared the ball away, whether it was with her stick, her gloves or her pads. She was unstoppable in the cage tonight.\" Greencastle 0, Northern 0 \nShots — GA 5, NY 23; Penalty corners — GA 4, NY 17; Saves — GA 15 (Mackenzie Oberholzer), NY 4 (Abi Kennedy). \nJV score — Northern 2, Greencastle 0. \nCAMP HILL 7, SHIPPENSBURG 1 &GT;&GT; Camp Hill rolled to a 4-0 lead in the first half and sent Shippensburg to a 7-1 non-league defeat. \nThe Lady Hounds (5-6-2) scored in a the second half on a shot by Rachel Kline, assisted by Maddie Kline.
