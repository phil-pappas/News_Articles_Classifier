That was my first reaction. He said, 'No, I'm not saying that.' \n\"Again he wanted me to be more aggressive in terms of running at players, closing them down, tracking back, being there and in their faces,\" Walcott added. \nThe striker also said Henry has been a key factor in his improvement. \n\"I have been chatting to him on a personal level behind the scenes as well to learn things from him,\" Walcott said. \n\"It is a great tool to have in the locker ... I've had quite a few words with him about some of the games I've played. \n\"He has just given me his analysis and if I've needed to ask him some questions about it, he's always there,\" he added. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
