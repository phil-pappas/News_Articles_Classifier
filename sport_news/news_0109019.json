But the Dodgers have not reached the World Series since winning the championship in 1988.\nThe 54-year-old former Yankees star is sixth in wins among Dodgers managers.\n  After the Dodgers lost 3-2 to the New York Mets in a decisive Game 5 of the NL Division Series, Mattingly met with president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman, general manager Farhan Zaidi and Josh Byrnes, senior vice president of baseball operations over the last week.\n\"We all felt that a fresh start would be good for both the organization and me,\" Mattingly said. \"We talked about several scenarios, including my returning in 2016. However, I believe this is the right time and right move for both parties.\"\nThe franchise with baseball's highest payroll, a record $289.6 million as of the end of the regular season, managed just two playoff victories before losing to the Mets.\n\"As the dialogue progressed daily, it evolved to a point where we all agreed that it might be best for both sides to start fresh,\" Friedman said. \nLos Angeles reached the postseason in three straight years for the first time but the Dodgers won just one series, beating Atlanta in the Division Series two years ago, while losing three.\nMattingly had one year remaining on his contract.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:15:34.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
