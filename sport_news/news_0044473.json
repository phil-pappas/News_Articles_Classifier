Stone Stadium on October 5, 2015. PJ Ward-Brown/The Courier-Tribune By Megan Crotty mcrotty@courier-tribune.com Twitter: @MeganCrottyCT \nASHEBORO — The Asheboro and Southwestern Randolph High School varsity football teams were tied with 5 minutes left in the first quarter Monday. \nIt didn’t last long. \nThe Blue Comets exploded, scoring on seven of their nine remaining drives on the way to a 54-14 Mid-Piedmont Conference-opening win over their crosstown rival at Lee J. Stone Stadium in a game that was delayed due to Friday’s wet weather. Five different AHS players scored as the team improved to 5-1 heading into Friday’s game against Ledford (6-1). \n“The number of mistakes we’re making is getting smaller and smaller,” Blue Comets coach Owen George said. “Our offensive line doesn’t get a lot of credit, but they were big tonight. On defense, we pitched a shutout save an offensive mistake and a nice offensive play by them. They have two great running backs and we rallied to the football on defense. \n“Overall, I’m proud. This is the closest we’ve come to playing a full four-quarter game.” \nTerry Richmond had 17 carries for 187 yards and three touchdowns. He also went 1-for-3 for 10 yards in the quarterback spot. Wayne Robertson had five carries for 98 yards and a touchdown, and Malik Brady had five carries for 87 yards and a score. Starting quarterback Auston Foley completed 7 of 14 passes for 149 yards and two touchdowns — both to Emmanuel Jones, who caught three passes for 123 yards. \nFor the Cougars (1-1, 3-4), Ray Hoskie had 15 carries for 68 yards, while Kenyan Beason had 16 carries for 38 yards and a score. Quarterback Ethan Walker completed 6 of 16 passes for 86 yards and a touchdown to Jaxon Snyder, who caught \nthree passes for 67 yards. \n“They’re a good football team,” said SWR coach Danny Akins, whose team has a bye this week before facing the Panthers. “We gave up way too many big plays. We didn’t make tackles in space. Our guys were fired up and ready to play, we just got confused a bit. We got away from our responsibilities and tried to do too much. \n“We’re beat up. Our leading tackler (Joey Evans) had to leave the game. I hope the break lets us heal and get ready for Ledford. We’ve got four games left and the opportunity to make the playoffs.” \nDespite giving up its first first-quarter touchdown of the season, AHS dominated the first half of the game, outgaining SWR 327-26 and scoring on four of its seven first-half drives. \nThe Blue Comets opened with a five-play, 61-yard drive capped by a 52-yard pass play from Foley to Jones 1 1/2 minutes into the game. \nThe Cougars reached the AHS 28 on the ensuing drive, but got stuck, putting in Brycen Walker to try a 45-yard field goal — tying his career long. The kick fell short, but on the second play from scrimmage, Walter Farrish intercepted a Foley pass, giving SWR possession on the AHS 12-yard line. \nFour plays later, Beason pushed 2 yards into the end zone to tie the game at 7-all with just over 5 minutes left in the first quarter. Still, after that, the Cougars were forced to punt four straight times. \nThe Blue Comets, meanwhile, responded by scoring on their next two drives — a 1-yard TD rumble by Richmond on fourth-and-goal and a 66-yard pass from Foley to Jones early in the second quarter. Both extra points failed, making it 19-7 AHS. \nAfter giving the ball over on downs on their next two drives, the Blue Comets scored again with 21.3 ticks left until halftime as Richmond sprinted 76 yards into the end zone. This time, the extra point was good and AHS took a 26-7 lead into the locker room. \nThe Blue Comets kept rolling in the second half, scoring on all four of their drives — a 63-yard run by Richmond, a 12-yard rush by Robertson, a 51-yard rumble by Brady and a 7-yard run by Tyrese Austin with 10 1/2 minutes left in the game that led to a running clock. \nSWR turned the ball over on downs and punted twice before putting together an eight-play, 65-yard drive capped by a 46-yard touchdown pass from Ethan Walker to Snider with just over 3 minutes left in the game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T05:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T10:50:16.031+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
