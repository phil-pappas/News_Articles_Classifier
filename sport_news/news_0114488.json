Qualifying is tomorrow. Well try to do as good a job as we can there; and when the race starts, run up front and try to stay toward the lead. I think its important to be in the lead in the last 50 laps of the race, so were going to try to be there.\" I dont know if well all be sorry once its over with (laughter). Im just kidding. We had a really good time. They were very nice and we had a good time out on the West Coast shooting that promo. And we will be over there tonight. Its live TV and itll be pretty interesting to see how that goes on and how they put the show on. Its a very fun show. Ive seen it several times. So, I kind of know what were getting ourselves into. But, it should be good. Its kind of putting ourselves in front of a new audience and hopefully we get some fans.\" If I get caught up on any of them at any time is never good, whether youre getting eliminated from a race, or your running the Daytona 500. You dont want to be in a wreck. I think the green-white-checkers are a way to give the fans an opportunity to see a race end under green, but how many are too many attempts? Even with three attempts, thats not a 100 percent guarantee that youre going to finish the race under green, so when do you end it? I thought three was a lot. It still think three is a lot; anywhere at any race. One attempt was kind of the norm if anybody ever did that in racing in the last 100 years. One attempt seemed to be plenty. And I thought that was a good move for NASCAR, not only considering what happened in Daytona, but just one attempt. We want to finish under green. We should hopefully finish under green without the opportunity of a green-white-checkered. But if there is a problem where we have to run extra laps, theyll be one attempt, and that should satisfy not only the fans, but the drivers and everybody involved.\" You have to talk to everybody instead of just a handful of guys that youve had a chance to speak to. Im sure there are some other guys here that are just as confident when they come here. But, weve won here this year and weve ran good and won at Daytona over the last several years. So when we come to all the plate tracks we feel confident we can do well and feel confident in the car. The confidence that you have in the car is really where it all stems from. If you go out there and go through about 50 to 100 laps and the car is just not really showing you what youre looking for, you lose a little confidence in the ability of the car. And another guy beside you might be going through the opposite situation where his car is awesome and hes gaining confidence as the race is going on. And with that confidence, his moves and decisions are different and changing. When you dont believe in the car, you make different decisions. You might not go in a direction you would typically go because you dont believe the car is capable of making that move without causing you to lose spots, right? When you feel like you have a dominant car like weve had over the last several years, you definitely make some moves with confidence and you come into the race with confidence. Until we see anything different, well be confident.\" Yeah (laughs). Marty Smith wrote a good article on that this week. I was sitting behind Mike Skinner. We were in single file line on the inside and Mike was protecting the bottom. And I was going to sit there until the last lap and try to pass him. And, Dads line formed on the outside and was coming. And, I could see him in the mirror knocking off a few guys each corner and getting closer toward the lead. And then I had to decide whether I was going to try to pass Mike now, and then maybe battle my dad for the lead, which was probably the best thing I could have done. Was I going to push Mike and try to work hard? Once their line got tires, ours had been kind of stagnant for a while. I think ours would have sort of rejuvenated itself and maybe battled-back. And so, I knew that pushing Mike Skinner past Daddy was not going to work well. I think I was riding home with Daddy anyways (laughter). I didnt have a plane then, I dont think. I knew he wouldnt have wanted that; for me to do that, you know? You cant communicate at that moment, but youre just thinking of about a million things like hes passing me. Part of me is pulling for him; the other part of me is thinking Im not in the situation I want to be in because I thought I was just going to have to try to pass Mike. That was the only thing I had to worry about until the end of the race. Now, our lane is not the lead lane. What do I got to do to get our lane back into the lead? So now again, its against me and Mike. But Dad, I dont want to push Mike in our lane past Dad. So I started not pushing Mike. I started lifting. And then our line really started falling. And then I decided coming through the Tri Oval that I was going to pass Mike. And I went to the bottom and he stayed against the apron. So he said basically at that point, if youre going to pass me youre going into this corner on the apron. And that wasnt going to work. I was going to wreck myself and Mike and everyone else. So, I had to lift. And when I lifted to get back in line, I fell to like 14th place. Of course we had already lost about five or six spots to Dads line. But, it was a mess. I just sort of felt destructed, mentally, when all that was happening because I didnt know exactly what I should do, what Tony Sr. wanted me to do on the pit box, what Dad wanted me to do; but he won the race. It worked out for him and that was good. It was a hell of a comeback. And its great for Kenny Wallace. He seems to really enjoy being a part of that story; and hes such a great guy and he had a lot of respect for Dad. So, its just great to hear that story. I hate to think about how it went for me because I wanted to win the race. We were just starting to sort of understand our strength at DEI as a plate track powerhouse. We began to win races after that. Id like to try it again. I wish we could do it again because I think I would have done a lot of things differently.\" Yeah, its real intense. Theres no denying the intensity and the pressure it puts on drivers like myself to be in a cutoff situation where youre eliminated if things dont go perfectly on Sunday. But I think its what the fans enjoy. If Im a fan, I like it. I know Ive read quite a few comments about this system and whether its fair and so forth. And I think Ive read a lot of great opinions about that. But, it definitely, as a fan, I think its really what we needed. And even if we dont make it through this weekend, I think its still going to be exciting. It was great last year even when we werent a part of it. It was amazing to watch. I really like to see the sport be as healthy as possible. And what we saw last year was great for that. This one has been pretty intense. Weve seen some guys get wrecked. I, myself, got wrecked. We were worried. I know we had some comments and questions from some guys. Were we going to be able to see the kind of intensity we saw last year? I think we have. And, its not even Texas yet (laughs). I dont know what happened there. So, who knows whats left? Im excited to see it and hopefully Im a part of it.\" Well, we have a system at Hendrick Motorsports that brings guys in. A lot of these guys are coming out of college or coming out of different careers as athletes and maybe they just kind of went through the system and some coming back from injuries but theyre still capable of going over the wall and being competitive on a pit crew. So, weve got a pretty good system. Weve had a lot of guys moving in and out of our team this year, trying to find a good combination that works for us. And I believe in what weve got going on at Hendrick Motorsports to find that combination. Weve got a lot of good guys and Im hoping what we have right now is going to work for us the rest of the season.\" I dont think you see it until like 20 to go. And to me, they all look kind of similar up until those last 20 laps. And I think the personality of the race depends on the guys that are up front and what theyre willing to do and what kind or style of place racer they are and the kind of things that theyve done in the past. And, you know, sometimes you get teammates up there working together and sometimes you get one group ganging-up on one lone guy. It just depends on the characters involved. It takes a long time. All the races feel very similar to me right until the end. And right around the end, you sort of realize where you are and what your chances are. Like I said, I think I need to be in the lead with 30 or 20 to go to have a really, really good shot at it. If not, its going to be a bit more difficult task to get that lead. Its just really difficult to pass the leader. And hes probably going to be a strong car if hes got the lead. So, it will be tough to get around him. Theyll be trying to do everything they can to hold it. And hopefully its exciting. Id love to lead the last 30 straight. So, well see how it goes.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:29:10.991+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
