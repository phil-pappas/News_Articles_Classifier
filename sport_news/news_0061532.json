Stark St., if approved by the Board of Commissioners on Thursday morning.\nIn exchange, the nonprofit agrees to operate the shelter for at least six years, a service valued at $50,000 annually in loan paperwork . Another $397,697, most of it county money , could go toward renovations to the building. If the nonprofit backs out or the county chooses another contractor, the county has dibs to take over the property and keep the shelter running.\n\"It fits right into our mission for a safety-net government, and we know that Human Solutions is a very capable long standing partner in this work,\" Commissioner Judy Shiprack said Wednesday.\nOfficials filed a two-year contract with Human Solutions in July 2014 to provide a warming shelter, records show. This year, Human Solutions has planned to open their shelter Nov. 1 at an old office building near Southeast 161st Avenue and Burnside while the land deal goes through and renovations to the building are made, said Mary Li, director of the county's Community Services Division.\nBut the plan has caught some concern from Commissioner Loretta Smith , who worries the deal may provide Human Solutions with an unfair advantage. That's because the county plans, by June 30, 2016, to begin seeking qualified nonprofits to provide the various homeless services for the next five years.\n\"We are using our taxpayer dollars to pay for a building for a vendor who will apply for our warming-center money next year,\" Smith said.\nBut Li said Human Solutions or any of its eight service providers are not guaranteed a renewed contract with the county.\n\"This is not a sweetheart deal for any single provider,\" Li said. \"This is a continued commitment by this board to make sure there is a system of care for homeless families that include winter shelter.\"\nIf completed by February, the new shelter should house up to 130 individuals, Li said. Last winter after the December holidays, Human Solutions was taking in up to 100 people a day compared to past years where averages ranged from 55 to 70 people a day, she said.\nThe half-acre property contains the 7,438-square-foot building currently owned by JZ Property Management in Lake Oswego, according to PortlandMaps.com owned by the City of Portland. It's market value stands at $1.2 million, according to the website.\nBoard records also indicate further development to build more affordable housing units would be possible at that location.\nEven though Human Solutions provides shelter services during the winter season, its contract is for the full year, Li said. If the deal goes through, the nonprofit will provide year-round sheltering.\nA representative with the nonprofit did not immediately return a message on Wednesday afternoon.\nCommissioners and county staff say the $300,000 down payment will come from what they expect will be unused general fund money such as unspent money from keeping unfilled positions within the Department of County Human Services. Most of the money for the $397,697 will come from Chairwoman Deborah Kafoury's $2 million allocation for the A Home For Everybody, a regional partnership with Portland and Gresham, aimed at providing sheltering services and rental assistance. Of that $397,697, about $25,000 comes from Metro grant.\nCommissioner Diane McKeel said in an email Wednesday she's seen winter shelters for families change locations over the years. It has created hardships for access to emergency shelter services.\n\"The loan we are providing this week helps that solution become a reality,\" McKeel said, \"and it also secures the property as a permanent shelter and our interest for years to come.\"\n-- Tony Hernandez\nthernandez@oregonian.com\n503-294-5928\n@tonyhreports", "external_links": ["https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zLgSkDwKM5vY.k4WYXRm0GF5M", "https://multco.us/loretta-smith", "https://multco.us/ds3", "https://multco.us/ds4", "http://multnomah.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=3&event_id=502&meta_id=80425", "http://www.twitter.com/tonyhreports", "http://humansolutions.org/", "http://multnomah.granicus.com/MetaViewer.php?view_id=3&event_id=502&meta_id=80473"], "published": "2015-10-22T02:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:08:46.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
