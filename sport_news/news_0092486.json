An afternoon spent with one on a race track is proof positive.\nAfter a few laps around Calabogie Motorsports Park near Ottawa , I can report that the hottest of Volkswagen’s hot hatches does indeed have the right stuff.\nFinally, for the 2016 model year, the Golf R is back and it is one serious performance rocket.\nLike the previous generation, the 2016 R is powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged 4-cylinder engine. Like the old car, this one produces a near-obscene amount of power for a small car: 292 horsepower and 280 lb-ft. of torque.\nGetting all of that power to the ground is the responsibility of a standard 6-speed manual transmission (or optional 6-speed DSG automatic). Volkswagen’s 4MOTION all-wheel drive is standard, as is Dynamic Chassis Control and independent front and rear suspension.\nOther standard chassis bits include anti-slip regulation, electronic stability control and an electronic transverse differential lock.\nIn terms of appearance, there isn’t much that sets the Golf R apart from its less powerful (210 hp) GTI stablemate, aside from a few minor styling cues and R badging.\nThe one thing that does stand out, however, is the quad exhaust at the rear that differs from the twin setup on the GTI.\nIn all, the R cuts a handsome profile. The lines are clean, sharp and straightforward. Not a beautiful car, perhaps, but certainly an attractive one that almost appears to be grinning as if it knows exactly why you bought it.\nIt’s a similar story on the inside, where the spacious cabin is finished in a pleasing array of high quality materials.\nVolkswagen Canada has wisely chosen to limit the R’s option list. Aside from colour, transmission and wheel options, the only other variable is the Technology Package ($2,015) which adds adaptive cruise control, blind spot detection with cross traffic alert and an 8-inch infotainment screen, among other features.\nEverything else is standard, and as you might imagine the list is lengthy: heated leather seats, satellite radio, rearview camera, 12-way power driver’s seat, Fender audio system, Apple CarPlay / Android Auto / MirrorLink smartphone integration, USB, Bluetooth, among many others.\nSo what’s it like driving a Golf R?\nFun, times a thousand.\nThe car is a pleasure to drive on public roads, but it really comes alive on the track where one can really push the limits of a very well-sorted platform.\nThe natural terrain road course at Calabogie Motorsports Park is challenging, and the Golf R is very capable.\nThe rev-happy 2.0-litre turbo screamed with delight as I mashed the accelerator, rowed through the gears and launched the manual-equipped R around the tricky circuit.\nThe R is an absolute rocket, both from rest and when climbing through the gears.\nAlthough I was fast enough to snap it into fifth gear a few times, the R was most fun in third and fourth.The light clutch and smooth-shifting six-speed manual was a delight and made the rolling curves a grin-inducing experience.\nAs one might expect, the 4MOTION all-wheel drive combined with Dynamic Chassis Control and independent suspension makes the R a very forgiving car to drive at speed.\nThe steering is light and responsive, body roll is minimal and well-controlled, and acceleration and braking is fast-twitch good, both with the manual and the DSG.\nIn short, the Golf R behaves like a go-kart on the track. It is truly at home in a closed course environment. It delivers bushels of fast fun with remarkably little drama. In all, it delivers a compelling performance package.\nAll of this goodness doesn’t come cheap, but considering how much performance it delivers and the cars it’s competing against, the $40,000-ish price tag seems pretty fair and consumers seem to agree.\nThe first crop of deliveries has already begun. With roughly 1,200 Canadian orders already in, the Golf R figures to be a popular option for those looking for a car that delivers track-ready performance and everyday driveability.\n2016 VOLKSWAGEN GOLF R\nPRICE: $39,995 — $41,395, ($42,010 / $43,410 as tested)\nADD-ONS: $2,015 (technology package) $1,605 (freight & PDI), taxes, licensing\nTYPE: Compact performance 5-door hatchback\nPROPULSION: front-engine, all-wheel drive\nCARGO: 388 L (1,336 L with rear seats folded)\nENGINE: 2.0-litre turbocharged 4-cylinder\nTRANSMISSION: 6-speed manual, 6-speed DSG automatic\nPOWER/TORQUE: 292 / 280\nFUEL CONSUMPTION (city / highway L/100km): 10.9 / 7.7 (manual), 10.2 / 7.8 (automatic), premium fuel\nBRAKES: 340 mm (front, vented disc), 310 mm (rear, solid disc)\nTIRES: P235/35R19, performance all-season\nSTANDARD FEATURES: 19-inch alloy wheels, 4MOTION all-wheel drive, dynamic chassis control, bi-xenon headlights, Discover Media with App Connect (Apple Carplay, Android Auto, MirrorLink), Fender audio and more\nACCESSIBILITY: An upright stance makes entry and exit a breeze.\nCOMPETITION: Ford Focus ST, Mini John Cooper Works Countryman ALL4, Subaru WRX / WRX STI\nWHAT'S BEST: Rocket-like acceleration, superb handling, refined upmarket interior\nWHAT'S WORST: I guess one could say it’s a bit pricey for a hatchback.
