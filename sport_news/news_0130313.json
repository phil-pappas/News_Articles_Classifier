Hawthorne Christian is enjoying a second consecutive breakout boys soccer season. The Defenders are now poised to accomplish something that has never been done before at the school.\nWith a 5-1 Passaic County tournament semifinal victory over Wayne Hills, the Defenders advanced to the final against Wayne Valley at noon Saturday at Clifton Stadium. A win not only would be the first county crown for Hawthorne Christian, it would be the first in any sport – boys or girls – for the small private academy.\n“We’re very proud of what we’ve achieved and we’re looking to accomplish even bigger and better things in the weeks ahead,” Hawthorne Christian coach Tyler Van Dyk said.\nThe Defenders (12-2), whose county final appearance against the ninth-seeded Indians will be their first in the 43-year history of the event, have been a true force, outscoring their opponents by a 58-12 margin.\nLed on offense by senior forward Rene White (26 goals, 12 assists) and senior midfielder Will Woodfin (13 goals, 13 assists), the Defenders basically can score anytime from almost anywhere on the field with their quick-strike attack.\nOther important contributors are back and co-captain Joseph Leveroni, forward Denys Falcon, midfielder Frank Generoso, back Clarence Fitchett and goalkeeper John Williams, all seniors, along with sophomore forwards David Falcon and Kirk Schmidt.\nBesides the county final, this week’s schedule includes key NJIC Patriot Division encounters at home against Saddle River Day, today at 4 p.m., and at Park Ridge at 7 p.m. Thursday. If the Defenders win their final three division games (including one at home against Midland Park on Tuesday), they will clinch at least a share of the Patriot crown.\nA year ago, Hawthorne Christian went a program-best 19-4-2 and won the first sectional championship in school history with a 4-3 victory over Morristown-Beard in the North Non-Public B final.\n“We’re taking advantage of our opportunities and we want to continue this positive streak we’re on,” said White, a 6-foot, 160-pounder from Bloomfield. “We feel we can handle the pressure of these big tournament games because we’re good at maintaining our composure and staying calm when the game comes down to the decisive final few minutes.”\n Email: mills@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T02:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:32:51.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
