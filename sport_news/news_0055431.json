(AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (Alex Brandon) \nPHILADELPHIA -- It doesn't sound like it is the Eagles ' first option. \nMore like their only option. \nSpeaking to reporters a day after his team's 23-20 loss to the Washington Redskins , Eagles head coach Chip Kelly said the team will not be signing a new kicker to replace Caleb Sturgis, who missed a field goal and an extra point in his first game with the team. \n\"We are going to stay with Caleb,\" Kelly said. \"We looked at what is available out there, don't feel...I think the state of kicking in the league right now is not very good.\" \nUnfortunately for the Eagles, the state of their kicking right now is right up there in terms of the worst in the NFL after losing starting kicker Cody Parkey for the season. EAGLES: Sam Bradford report card \nAt 1-3, the Eagles have lost two games due to kicking . In their Week 1 26-24 loss to Atlanta, Parkey missed a 44-yard kick in the fourth quarter. On Sunday, Sturgis cost the team four points in a game they lost by three. \nKelly mentioned that one kicker they worked out last week, Nick Novak, signed with the Houston Texans. \nAlthough he didn't say it, it's fair to wonder if Novak was still available if, he wouldn't be signed by the team by now. \nInstead, the Eagles will be forced to live with their decision to go with Sturgis for at least another week. \n\"We feel in terms of what we have available out there,\" Kelly said, \"we'll stick with Caleb.\" THE NO-HUDDLE SHOW, Ep. 10: Can Chip Kelly fix the mess he's created with Eagles? \nWe know Chip Kelly is a good coach, but after the Eagles' disastrous start to the season, we're starting to see he might not be a very good general manager.
