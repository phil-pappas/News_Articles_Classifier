Vermeulen was responding to a complaint made by black player Prosper Utseya alleging racism in Zimbabwe cricket.\nIn the post made back in July, Vermeulen wrote that black people wouldn’t have any problems “if we had left them in the bush,” and Utseya might be happier if he was living “in his mud hut.” He referred to black people as “the apes.”\nVermeulen, who has played nine Tests and 43 one-day internationals but has been in and out of the team, could face a life ban in Zimbabwe after a series of previous problems.\nMark Vermeulen batting in a Test between Zimbabwe and England in 2003. Source: AP\nIn 2008, Vermeulen escaped a conviction for arson because of mental illness after setting fire to two Zimbabwe cricket buildings in 2006 in protest at being left out of the team. The court found Vermeulen had been suffering from serious psychiatric problems since he was struck on the head by a ball while batting in a game in 2004.\nVermeulen was banned from playing in English league cricket for 10 years in 2011 for hurling the ball at a group of fans after they teased him.\nHe made his return to Zimbabwe’s Test team last year after a 10-year absence but has fallen out of favour again.\nOn Friday, a Zimbabwean newspaper published what it said was an apology from Vermeulen. In it, Vermeulen said that he had apologised personally to Utseya and had his apology accepted.\nVermeulen Quote: : “I know my comments were over the top and I apologise to all that I have offended. But as a cricketer, it’s how our minds work.”\n Vermuelen in trouble over ‘apes’ racial slur", "external_links": ["http://resources0.news.com.au/images/2015/10/17/1227572/712084-0a2abb9e-7498-11e5-9c0a-ce1ed3f9b0e3.jpg", "http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/zimbabwean-cricketer-mark-vermeulen-in-trouble-over-apes-racial-slur-on-social-media/story-e6frf3g3-1227572712111"], "published": "2015-10-18T01:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:36:10.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
