McKenna. He also was charged with unarmed burglary for stealing a number of guns from McKenna’s home. His girlfriend, 31-year-old Lauren Kalil, was charged as an accessory after the fact to murder for hiding evidence that implicated Moscaritolo in the killing.\n“We said it, and we meant it. We told them we were coming for them, and we did,” said Marshfield police Chief Phillip Tavares.\nOn Sept. 16, police were called to McKenna’s home on Damons Point Road after a friend found his body. Police found McKenna lying on his kitchen floor with a large gash on his arm and an injury to his head.\nInvestigators found blood throughout the house, and bloody clothing, gloves and shoes at the home and along the roads that police believe the suspects drove after the killing. They found a pot growing operating in McKenna’s basement.\nNeighbors and associates told prosecutors that McKenna had claimed he was a diamond and gold runner in Africa, and a witness who had worked at McKenna’s home said McKenna showed him a number of gemstones, none of which were found.\nOn Sept. 28, police arrested 40-year-old James W. Ferguson, of Dorchester, a career criminal with an extensive history of drug and assault convictions, and charged him with murder. Ferguson pleaded not guilty and was held without bail. Police at the time said they were looking for two more suspects.\nA tip to police implicated Moscaritolo and led them to arrest him and recover five of the firearms that were stolen from McKenna’s house, according to Plymouth County District Attorney Timothy Cruz.\n“This case is far from over,” Cruz said. “This case is ongoing and the work is not over and will not be over until every person who is responsible is held accountable for their actions.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:49:28.591+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
