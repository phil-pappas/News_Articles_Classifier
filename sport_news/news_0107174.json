(Photo: Ryan Garza DFP) \nGolden Tate said his comments about opposing defensive players knowing what plays the Detroit Lions are running were not meant as veiled shots at offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi nor anyone else, and the Pro Bowl receiver insisted that he hasn't lost faith in the struggling offense, despite the team's 0-3 start. \n\"I think Joe's a heck of a coach,\" Tate told the Free Press today. \"I can't sit here and speak ill about a guy who helped take us to the playoffs and also a guy who helped me have a career year, who also put his tail on the line to get me here in this offense. He's one of the first guys I met with when I came on my trip, so I have nothing but great things to say about him and I'm super, super appreciative for him.\" \nTate told WMGC-FM (105.1) in his weekly interview Tuesday that the Lions' offense had become predictable to that point that opposing defensive players \"called out\" plays during each of the season's first three games. \n\"I've had a couple occasions in literally each game, where they called out our play, for one, and then afterwards been like, 'Hey, we knew what you guys were doing,'\" Tate told the station. \"I don't know how they know or which film they're watching that we're giving away. And that's something we need to go back and watch our tendencies to figure out where we line up or how we line up or what formation -- whatever it may be, we've got to figure it out, because we're clearly giving away. I mean if three weeks, a player's come up to me and said, 'We knew what you were going to do,' that's bad.\" \nDenver Broncos safety David Bruton, who played two seasons with Tate at Notre Dame, told reporters Monday that he jumped a Matthew Stafford pass to Calvin Johnson for a game-clinching interception after he recognized which play the Lions were running by the formation they used . \nThe Lions lost to the Broncos on Sunday Night Football , 24-12. \nTate declined to identify which players told him that the Lions' offense was tipping plays, but he said one of the exchanges happened after a game. \n\"I don't want to open this box up anymore,\" Tate said. \"I just wanted to clear it up.\" \nThe Lions are off to their worst start since 2010, and they have a difficult schedule ahead with games against two of the best teams in the NFC the next two weeks. They visit the defending NFC champion Seattle Seahawks on Monday night (8:30, ESPN, Channel 7) and host the undefeated Arizona Cardinals the following Sunday at Ford Field. \nDespite having Tate, Matthew Stafford, Calvin Johnson, Eric Ebron and Ameer Abdullah -- all first- or second-round picks -- playing key roles on offense, the Lions rank 27th in the NFL in total offense, last in rushing offense and are averaging just 14 points per game the last two weeks. \nThey've been outscored, 80-35, since jumping out to a 21-3 lead at the start of a Week 1 loss to the San Diego Chargers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T23:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:52:49.388+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
