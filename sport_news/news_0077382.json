Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports, USA TODAY Sports)\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Grizzlies were one of the most efficient teams defensively during their 55-win season, ranking in the top 10 in points allowed and opponent field goal percentage.\nUSA TODAY\nNew Orleans Pelicans preview: How far can Anthony Davis carry them?\nWhat’s different this season? Memphis signed Marc Gasol to a five-year, $110 million contract. They also signed former L.A. Clippers small forward Matt Barnes to add more versatility on the wing, and Brandan Wright to back up Zach Randolph at the four spot.\nHow good can they be? The Grizzlies gained more than they lost this offseason and will have another impressive season this year because of that. They have one of the best big man tandems in the league with Gasol and Randolph (a combined 33.5 points and 18.3 rebounds per game), a veteran point guard in Mike Conley who has played above-average basketball his entire career (13.4 points, 5.6 assists, 44.2% shooting through eight seasons), and two top-notch perimeter defenders, Tony Allen and Barnes (No. 2 and No. 9 in defensive plus/minus last year).\nUSA TODAY\nSan Antonio Spurs preview: Don't think they're done just yet\nHow far they have to go: Being able to re-sign Gasol and adding Barnes and Wright and losing only Kosta Koufos sets up the Grizzlies to have an even better season this year. They will be among the best in the West once again, but they have to improve offensively. They ranked 20th in points per game (98.3) and were tied for 22nd in three-point percentage (33.9%) last season.\nDealing with Father Time: The Grizzlies are one of the oldest teams in the NBA. Six of their players are older than 30, three of them starters. In a Western Conference that’s getting better each year, you have to wonder how much longer the Grizzlies have in the West’s upper echelon with their current roster.\nKeeping Conley: Star point guard Mike Conley will be an unrestricted free agent at the end of this season. He’s not going to go out and drop 50 points like Stephen Curry or effortlessly record triple-doubles like Russell Westbrook, but he will play efficiently. He’s only 27, so keeping Conley around would be in Memphis’ best interest.\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/33be497db4f9658ae724e47fe7e56f8beba47eb7/c=0-183-2229-3155&r=537&c=0-0-534-712/local/-/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814492374761306-XXX-s130125-672.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1N2xXtu&text=Memphis%20Grizzlies%20preview%3A%20Veteran%20team%20looking%20to%20win%20big&via=usatoday", "http://imgur.com/LhuRZsQ.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814492374761306-XXX-s130125-672.jpg", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1N2xXtu&mini=true", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67c25b7dcc74f5feeeb0bdec5b486267d4e89391/c=556-0-3192-2636/local/-/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814499540979243-AP-Spurs-Kings-Basketball.1.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/68653637ed9a918b8a45585659768132fa3db932/r=283x400/local/-/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814492374761306-XXX-s130125-672.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/38326b5b6e2ce888b438ef47256229bbff461b77/c=984-0-4261-3277/local/-/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814503137738299-USP-NBA--Preseason-Miami-Heat-at-New-Orleans-Pelic.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:28:35.692+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
