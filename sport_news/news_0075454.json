Last season, he received 63 percent of the votes. He was an even more overwhelming favorite this season, earning 79.3 percent of the votes. \nHarden, who finished as runner-up for the league's Most Valuable Player award, tied with Kevin Durant with 10.7 percent of the votes to win the award this season, trailing LeBron James (39.3 percent) and last season's MVP winner, Stephen Curry (25 percent).

He trailed the same two players, in the same order, in that category as well. \nAsked which player you would want taking a shot with the game on the line, Harden again received the third-most votes. Harden received 10.3 percent of the votes, while Steph Curry (51.7 percent) and Kevin Durant (31 percent) finished in the top two spots. \nThe reigning NBA champion Golden State Warriors were voted as the favorite to finish first in the Western Conference again, while the Rockets were deemed the fifth best team in the conference. Over half of the general managers voted for the Rockets to finish among the conference's top four, and they finished only slightly behind the Los Angeles Clippers for the fourth spot. \nSan Antonio, which added LaMarcus Aldridge this offseason, was voted the team that made the best overall moves in the offseason (79.2 percent of the votes). But the Rockets were right behind (6.9 percent), largely due to the trade that brought point guard Ty Lawson to Houston. \nLawson finished second in the voting for which single player acquisition will make the biggest impact. He finished behind Aldridge. Lawson also tied for the most underrated player acquisition, along with Paul Pierce (Clippers) and David West (Spurs). \nDwight Howard was tabbed as the fifth best interior defender. \nTo view entire survey, click here . \nCopyright 2015 by Click2Houston.com.
