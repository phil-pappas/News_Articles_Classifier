John Farrell is coming back to the Red Sox as manager next season, welcome news for plenty of reasons, only some of which have to do with baseball. Torey Lovullo is returning as bench coach, good news too for a lot of reasons, many of which have to do with baseball. To me, the return of both men to the positions they occupied before Farrell took his leave of absence in August for cancer treatment is the epitome of a best-case scenario. The Red Sox won’t face the karma-baiting awkwardness of replacing a manager who was away fighting a serious illness. They will retain a coach in Lovullo who proved in Farrell’s absence that he is a bright and savvy managerial prospect. The organization is better for having both of them, and should the team’s record not be better early next season, well, then any speculation about Farrell’s job status would be appropriate. But it isn’t now. He deserves the chance to prove the Red Sox’ improvement in his absence was because of the players, not the temporary change in the dugout.\n2. All right, one last thought on Don Orsillo’s sad and transfixing goodbye Sunday, and then I’ll put this topic away for a while, at least until there’s more news. I understand that there’s some backlash to the backlash, that some among us thought the fist-shaking at the Red Sox and NESN was a little over the top, or that various appreciations for Orsillo became a little too maudlin. (I’m not pleading guilty, but I’ll consider a no-contest plea.) To some degree, I get it. Dave O’Brien, who will replace Orsillo in 2016, is a terrific announcer and there’s a chance – a chance – that NESN may have bumbled its way into having an even better broadcast next season. But I think I’ve always acknowledged that it’s their prerogative to make a change. What bothered me more than anything else was watching someone who excelled at his dream job, who did nothing wrong, and who habitually treated people the way they would hope to be treated being replaced with such apparent callousness, and seemingly with absolutely no regard for how the news would be received. NESN had a right to make a change. O’Brien deserves a fair shot, as does his partner, whether it’s Jerry Remy, someone else, or a few someone elses. But Orsillo deserved more compassion from those making the decisions. And that’s a point always worth reiteration.\n3. The decision to lowball Jon Lester in spring 2014 with a four-year, $70-million offer – $12.5 million less than the Red Sox currently owe the mediocre Rick Porcello through 2020, it must be noted – has been a hovering embarrassment pretty much since the moment it became public. That offer – and the Red Sox’ inability to bring Lester back in free agency last winter – will look even more ridiculous once the David Price sweepstakes gets serious this winter. Price, who turned 30 in August, has both Lester and Max Scherzer on his similarity scores lists at Baseball-Reference.com. Scherzer signed a seven-year, $210-million deal with the Nationals last winter. The price for Price will be in the same range, and you have to figure the Red Sox will be in the hunt. I’d love to see Price here, even with the obvious risk of such a long-term deal. But they should have just paid Lester what he was worth in the first place. He’d already be a bargain.\n4. From a baseball and trade-value standpoint, I can’t argue with Michael Silverman’s assertion in the Boston Herald that it might make sense for the Red Sox to deal Jackie Bradley Jr. this offseason. He did follow up that affirming whoa-he’s-figured-it-out-now torrid stretch (he hit a downright crazy .446/.489/.952 with 7 homers in 90 plate appearances from Aug. 9-Sept. 7) with a too-familiar prolonged slump (.138/.247/.263 with 2 homers in 94 plate appearances the rest of the way), so we’re still not certain what he will be as an offensive player. (I’d take that final .832 OPS every single year, even if it comes with a .249 batting average.) But I know this: I’ll suffer from incurable envy if he ends up moving on and playing that spectacular outfield defense for any other team but this one. I wouldn’t say this if I hadn’t compared, contrasted, and given it the utmost consideration: He is the best defensive outfielder I have ever seen.\n5. It certainly was evident every time he lumbered hopelessly after anything more challenging than a fly ball, but it was nonetheless interesting to get confirmation from the Red Sox that they believed Hanley Ramirez was not in peak physical condition this season. Chances are though, that the Red Sox have about as much hope of Ramirez actually shedding 15-20 pounds this offseason as they do of unloading, oh, all 240 or so pounds of Ramirez on a misguided trade partner this winter.\n6. If Arnie Beyeler really was relieved of his duties as first base coach largely because he couldn’t get Ramirez to master the basics of left field play, that’s unfortunate. Ramirez wasn’t going to master the position even if he had a hologram of ’67 Yaz standing out there in the shadow of the Monster with him and showing him what to do. Turns out a term you’ve heard applied in other sports to talented, untrustworthy athletes apparently also applies to Ramirez: coach killer.\n7. I mentioned a variation of this on Twitter a couple of days, but it’s so ridiculous-in-a-good-way that I’ve got to post it here too. In 162 combined games from June 21-Oct. 1, Xander Bogaerts and Mookie Betts produced these numbers: .332/.370/.488, 692 at-bats, 230(!) hits, 116 runs, 53 doubles, 5 triples, 15 home runs, 100 RBI, 15 steals. Bogaerts turned 23 on Oct. 1. Mookie turns 23 on Wednesday. If you need a source of optimism to carry you through a Red Sox-free October and into the long winter, here you go.\n8. As staggering and encouraging as those offensive numbers are for Bogaerts and Betts, perhaps their most impressive – or at least comparatively unsung – feats have occurred on defense. In one season, Bogaerts made the leap from a raw and inconsistent defensive shortstop whose future at the position was murky to an above-average defender who seemed to improve in every mental and physical aspect. The importance of that given the importance of the position cannot be overstated. Yet Betts’s achievement with the glove might be even more impressive. He has become so stellar in center field – to the point that he may remain there while the exceptional Jackie Bradley Jr. moves to right – that we almost forget he made the transition from second base just a year ago.\n9.
