The Boston Globe profiled the club yesterday , detailing their $100,000 rides, the signature stuffed turtle on their dashboards that signifies their membership, and many of their preferences to remain anonymous. Many of these students come from wealthy foreign families from countries like China, where an economic boom has made the rich even richer. Although the piece emphasizes that not all foreign students come from luxurious wealth, and the group does not aim to support that stereotype.\n“There’s whole gangs of them that have the same Maserati,” Satya Patel, a BU graduate student, told The Globe , referring to a blue Maserati GranTurismo.\nMany may remember, this was the same car in which a Boston University student got charged with driving over 100 mph through Back Bay without a license. It’s just one of the risks you take when trying to roll with the “Fantastic Rush Rally.”\nNew and improved cars of 2016:\nPrevious -- of -- Next Some cars are going to be very different in 2016. A few popular brands, including the Honda Civic and the Toyota Prius, will be getting upgrades like better engines and improved range. Another car will run on hydrogen, while others like, the all-electric Tesla Model X (pictured) will offer a very unique design. Check out the cars to look forward to driving in 2016. Tesla Previous -- of -- Next 2016 Honda Civic. As Consumer Reports tells it, consumers were so dissatisfied with the current version of the Civic that Honda pushed a replacement version six months earlier than anticipated. When it arrives in the fall of 2015, the redesigned Honda Civic will have a base 2.0-liter 4-cylinder engine. A 1.5-liter turbocharged 4-cylinder will also be available. Honda also says the cabin will be quieter, more refined, and offer more room. Don Emmert / AFP / Getty Images Previous -- of -- Next 2016 Volvo XC90. After more than a decade, Volvo finally gave the XC90 – first introduced in 2002 – an upgrade. The improved XC90 has a more contemporary style, a more elegant interior, and advanced safety features including a 360-degree surround view camera, pedestrian and cyclist detection. Volvo also promises an R-Design option with a “unique grille, larger wheels, mirror covers in matte silver, and sportier Sport Contour seats.” William Griffith Previous -- of -- Next 2016 Toyota Prius (pictured: 2014 Toyota Prius): Toyota has yet to officially unveil the 2016 Toyota Prius. But CR reports the redesigned hybrid vehicle icon will still be a 5-door hatchback but will feature a new platform and deliver a longer range from a small gas engine and an electric motor. A lithium-ion battery upgrade may offer even more range. Previous -- of -- Next Toyota officially unveiled the 2016 Toyota Prius on September 8. The redesigned hybrid vehicle icon will still be a 5-door hatchback but will feature a new platform and deliver a longer range from a small gas engine and an electric motor. An improved battery promies to deliver a 10 percent improvement on fuel efficiency. John Locher / AP Photo Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next 2016 Tesla Model X. Tesla is currently taking reservations for its Model X, which features “falcon wing” doors that appear to pay homage to the Delorean. The Model X is an all-electric SUV, a follow up to its highly successful Model S sedan, which forced Consumer Reports to revise its grading system. CR reports there will be 70-, 85-, and 90- kWh battery packs available, with the 85-kWh delivering a range of about 200 miles. Tesla Previous -- of -- Next 2016 Chevrolet Camaro. According to General Motors, the sixth-generation Camaro will deliver a “more nimble driving experience” thanks to a lighter design that sheds around 200 pounds and a wide range of powertrains. It has also been given a more “athletic” look and aerodynamically optimized with a “driver-focused” interior with enhanced technology. GM claims the only thing the newest Camaro has in common with previous versions is the “rear bowtie emblem and the SS badge.” Rebecca Cook / Reuters Previous -- of -- Next 2016 Toyota Mirai. According to Kelley Blue Book, “mirai” means “future” in Japanese. The Mirai is a four-door midsize sedan that runs on hydrogen and apparently has a range of 300 miles. KBB reports the Mirai can go from zero to 60 in about nine seconds and its fuel cell technology delivers 153 horsepower. Since it runs on hydrogen, it’s a very quiet ride and refilling the tank can take a few minutes, compared to recharging an electric vehicle which can take considerably longer.

CR reports only a 2.0-liter, 228 horsepower turbo engine will be available at the X1’s initial launch later this fall. All-wheel drive and front-wheel drive options will be available. Courtesy of BMW Group Previous -- of -- Next 2016 Mazda CX-3. This Mazda is a compact crossover with an exterior that KBB says “reflects the sharpest and most dynamic take on the KODO look to date.” KODO – Soul of Motion is Mazda’s design philosophy, which aims to capture the spirit of movement even while the vehicle is at rest. The CX-3 has all-wheel drive and its interior has a modern-looking cabin. Mazda Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next 2016 Hyundai Tucson. The redesigned Hyundai Tucson has been given a style that makes it a little more like its sibling, the Hyundai Santa Fe. The new design includes a hexagonal grille, LED headlights, and high wheel arches to create the illusion of motion. The Tucson is built on a new platform that gives it a roomy interior and 18.5 cubic feet of cargo space (when the second row is up). Hyundai Previous -- of -- Next 2016 Nissan Titan. KBB says Nissan is making “significant changes” to the Titan after a long wait that are meant to address consumer complaints about a lack of variety. Nissan is making two versions of the pickup available, the Titan and the Titan XD (pictured). The XD features a larger frame than its counterpart capable of towing 10,000 to 12,000 pounds. It is also available with a diesel V8 engine.
