SJSU now needs to win just two games to become bowl-eligible. \nIt won't be easy -- San Jose State's November slate includes home dates against Brigham Young and Boise State and tough road games at Nevada and Hawaii. But beating New Mexico (4-4, 2-2) was a good first step. San Jose State's Tyler Ervin tries to fend off New Mexico's Nik D'Avanzo in the second quarter at San Jose State University in San Jose, Calif., on Saturday, Oct. 24, 2015. (Jim Gensheimer/Bay Area News Group) ( Jim Gensheimer ) \n\"We know how much we have left to play for,\" junior quarterback Kenny Potter said. \"We have to get to 6-6 or 7-5, whatever it may be. \n\"The conference championship's not fully in our hands -- some things have to happen for us to win that. But as far as what we can control, it's a bowl right now, and that's our goal.\" \nErvin moved into second place on San Jose State's career all-purpose yardage list, finishing the game with 5,225. He surpassed 5,000 on his second carry, a 71-yard touchdown run that helped the Spartans go up 7-0. \nThe senior tailback also became the 11th Spartan to rush for 1,000 yards in a season, surpassing the mark on a 3-yard run in the second quarter, and the fourth with two 200-yard rushing games in a season. Ervin is seventh on SJSU's single-season rushing list with 1,159 yards.

It's fun to watch.\" \nPotter did some pretty incredible things himself, completing 16 of 20 passes for 181 yards and two TDs with no interceptions. He also came through with two huge scoring plays at crucial moments. \nThe first of those came just before halftime. With the score tied at 14, Potter lofted a short pass over several Lobos defenders to wide-open tight end Billy Freeman for a 25-yard score that put SJSU ahead to stay. \nPotter then turned a potentially huge loss of yardage into a 12-yard insurance TD in the third quarter. With all of his receivers covered, Potter suddenly found himself under pressure from an oncoming pass rusher. After first rushing backward, Potter found a hole and bolted for the end zone to give SJSU a 28-14 lead. \n\"Kenny does that,\" SJSU coach Ron Caragher said. \"He's got that athletic ability. It keeps defenses honest when you've got an athletic quarterback who can make a multitude of plays.\" \nSaid Ervin: \"Kenny's magic. He does a good job creating something out of nothing.\" \nSJSU's rushing defense entered Saturday's game as the MWC's worst and gave up an early 79-yard touchdown to New Mexico's Teriyon Gipson. However, the Spartans surrendered just 208 yards on the ground, well below New Mexico's average of 254.6 per game. \nCleveland Wallace III, who had a second-half interception, noted that the Spartans have one more win than they did last season. \n\"We talk about climbing the mountain,\" the junior cornerback said. \"This was a good first step.\" \nAustin Lopez became the first San Jose State place-kicker to reach 300 career points. He got No. 300 on his second PAT, which tied the game at 14-14 after fellow senior Hansell Wilson's 35-yard touchdown reception in the second quarter. \nLopez now has 305 points, the last three coming on a 43-yard field goal in the fourth quarter. \nJunior linebacker Christian Tago and sophomore cornerback Maurice McKnight led SJSU's defense with 10 tackles apiece. Tago also blocked a field goal in the second quarter.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:27:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:30:56.690+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
