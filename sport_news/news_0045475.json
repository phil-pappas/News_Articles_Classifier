Superintendent Jim Holbeck made the decision Wednesday afternoon. \nMany of the students say they are still trying to come to grips with what exactly happened. They have mixed emotions about what it will feel like to get into the classroom after a day they will never forget. \nIt's a scene students never thought they would see. Sophomore Lauren Aden was in the middle of the lockdown. She didn't know what was going on, until she saw the news on social media. \n\"When Dr. Lein, our principal, came on the intercom and told us that he's been hurt we kind of all just figured it out and it got really surreal after that,\" Aden said. \nIt's been a difficult day for many, but the district believes being back in school is what the students need. For sophomore Abigail Bushar, going back to school will be hard. \n\"I think it's just that I'm a little scared because now that this can happen I don't want it to happen again. I don't think it'll ever be the same just walking by the principal's office ever again knowing what happened,\" Abigail Bushar said. \nAbigail's mom Shelly says Wednesday was stressful. As she drops off her daughter to pick up her car after a long day, she agrees going back to school will help the students. \n\"I personally think it's great. I mean I want them to get back to a routine and make sure they don't have any issues and if they do that they've got the support here to help them,\" Shelly said. \nStudents agree that starting that line of communication is the best way to move on. \n\"We just kind of have to talk about it. There's really no way around it. It's not going to do any good to just kind of pretend like it didn't happen,\" Aden said. \n\"I think it's more that if we all figure it out as a whole that we'll be able to heal from this as a whole community and a school,\" Abigail said. \nA day at school that will be anything but normal. \nCounselors will be available at the school Thursday for anyone having a difficult time.
