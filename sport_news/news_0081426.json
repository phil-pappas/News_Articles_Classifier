Dombrowski already has discussed a 2016 payroll with ownership. \n\"They're very desired to win,\" Dombrowski said about ownership. \"It (payroll) is not going backwards. But I don't really have that specific number. But if you say ballpark, yeah, that would be safe to say it's in the same ballpark (as 2015).\" \nThe 2016 ballclub has plenty of needs. \n\"First and foremost, we've talked about trying to improve our pitching staff: our starters and our bullpen,\" Dombrowski said. \nDombrowski also will look to add an outfielder to complement Mookie Betts, Jackie Bradley Jr. and Rusney Castillo. \n\"The rest of the club is probably pretty much well set from a positional player prospective,\" Dombrowski said. \nSo does that mean Betts, Bradley and Castillo definitely will be the three starting outfielders come Opening Day 2016? \n\"Mookie's easy to say,\" Dombrowski said, meaning 'Yes'. \"The other two guys have done well. Jackie probably a little bit more. I think Castillo looked tired at the end. I was encouraged when I saw him earlier. We know they can all play defense. We know they can do the other things. They're going to have to hit from a consistent perspective and in Castillo's case being a corner guy more so. I'm not ready to make a declaration. But if we were to open the season today, they would be (the starters). We like them all. \n\"But I do think it's important that we have a flexibility for John (Farrell) to be in a spot where he can still pick and choose when he wants to give those guys a break for certain pitchers.\" \nDombrowski emphasized there's much more starting pitching than relief pitching available via free agency. \n\"So how it affects us yet, I'm not really sure,\" Dombrowski said. \"But there are many more starting pitchers available in free agency than there are bullpen guys. So I'm sure that comes into play at some point. Again, we'll tackle that in a couple weeks when we sit down with our group and discuss all the names. \n\"But I think you're much more apt to be in a position where the availability of what you're looking to acquire is out there in free agency. Now, can you do it? What's the cost of making a trade? Those conversations are just starting.\" \nWhile the Red Sox will look to add multiple relievers, Dombrowski wants to add one reliever who has the potential to close if Uehara suffers another injury. \nFinding this reliever will be essential. Uehara's season ended Aug. 10 when he was diagnosed with a non-displaced distal radius fracture . \nUehara will be 41 on April 3. He's no sure bet in 2016. \n\"His track record is that he can handle the closing situation very well,\" Dombrowski said. \"People have told me he can fit different roles. But you also feel comfortable that he can close games still at this point of his career. Right now he's our closer. That's the plan. Who knows what will happen? \n\"But I'm also concerned that if the same thing happens this year where we have an injury, (Junichi) Tazawa is much more comfortable pitching the eighth inning than the ninth inning. As you know we mixed and matched and Robbie Ross did a good job for us, but to say we're going to put that (closing) on his (Uehara's) back completely going into next year, I would hope that we could find somebody else that could help in that regard.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T01:22:58.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
