(AP) - Matt Kenseth won the pole Thursday night for the NASCAR Sprint Cup race at Charlotte Motor Speedway. Kenseth turned a lap at 194.532 mph to edge fellow Chase contender and teammate Kyle Busch and sweep the poles at Charlotte this season. It is Kenseth's fourth Sprint Cup pole this season and the 17th of his career. Joey Logano qualified third for the Saturday night race, non-Chase driver Greg Biffle was fourth and Denny Hamlin fifth. Among the other Chase contenders who'll start in the top 10 are Kurt Busch in sixth, Carl Edwards in eighth and Ryan Newman in 10th. Kevin Harvick, who raced his way into Round 2 with a clutch win last week, will start 11th and Dale Earnhardt Jr. begins 12th. Only three of the 12 drivers remaining in the Chase didn't make it to the final round of qualifying - Brad Keselowski (starts 13th), Martin Truex (15th) and Jeff Gordon (22nd).
