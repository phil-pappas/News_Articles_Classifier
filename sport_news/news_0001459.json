MARTIN kimberley.martin@newsday.com \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nFOXBOROUGH, Mass. -- Brandon Marshall wishes he could have that one back. \nThe Jets receiver had a chance to secure a touchdown and perhaps a Jets win early in the fourth quarter. But his end-zone drop helped pave the way for the New England Patriots to squeak by with a 30-23 win Sunday afternoon. Latest Jets stories See also Jets vs. Patriots play-by-play \nJets quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick was 22-for-39 for 295 yards with two touchdowns. He also rushed for 29 yards on five carries. \nTom Brady was 34-for-54 for 355 yards with two touchdowns for the undefeated Patriots (6-0). He also scored on a quarterback sneak. \nWith 13:53 remaining in the game, Patriots cornerback Malcolm Butler was flagged for pass interference, which moved the Jets to the New England 15. After throwing a second-down incompletion intended for Eric Decker, Fitzpatrick looked for Marshall near the end zone. He tried to adjust to Fitzpatrick's third-and-7 throw, turning his body around and away from the defender in the end zone. But Marshall couldn't hold onto the ball and the Jets were forced to settle for a Nick Folk field goal. \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nThe field goal gave the Jets a 20-16 lead with 12:54 to go. And that was plenty of time for Brady to work his magic. \nThe Patriots scored twice in the fourth quarter, first on Danny Amendola's 8-yard reception and again on a 15-yard TD by tight end Rob Gronkowski with 1:13 remaining. Gronkowski was Brady's favorite target, catching 11 passes for 108 yards. Jets Jets vs. Patriots \nThe Jets found a way to ground New England early in the game. The Patriots held a 13-10 edge at halftime, but their offense struggled mightily against the Jets' swarming secondary and Bowles' blitzes. But they couldn't sustain it for four quarters. \nChris Ivory was a shell of himself, favoring his sore left hamstring for much of the afternoon. But the Jets' bruising back gave the offense its first lead of the day, 17-16, with 4:07 left in the third quarter. Ivory easily walked in a 9-yard touchdown pass from Fitzpatrick, capping a 13-play, 80-yard scoring drive that lasted 7:03. \nNotes & quotes: With less than a minute remaining, center Nick Mangold left the game with a possible stinger or concussion . . . Safety Calvin Pryor suffered an ankle injury. \nSubscribe to Newsdayâ€™s sports newsletter for stories, photos and videos about your favorite New York teams plus national sports news and events.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T00:47:06.213+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
