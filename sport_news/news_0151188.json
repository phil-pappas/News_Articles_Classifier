Bruising encounter - the foot injury that ruled out Frankie Gavin. \nNow Evans has come in at 11 days notice for the top of the bill on Saturday October 17, which will take place live on Sky Sports. \nThe British Boxing Board of Control today passed the Welshman to go for glory, with Eggington now embarking on a revenge mission. \nEvans had been due to face John O'Donnell in a rescheduled eliminator on December 5, but now gets his shot without the need to qualify. \nHe's one of only two boxers, alongside Johnny Coyle, to beat the 21-year-old in a paid ring with both defeats coming in Prizefighter. \nThe first loss came in just Eggington's fourth pro bout two years ago, when 'the Savage' shook off a booming right hook to be outpointed over the three-round distance. \nHe's disappointed not to be facing world title challenger Gavin, but feels that Evans is as good as an alternative opponent as he could have hoped. \nHe said: \"Frankie was a nice fight for all of us, everyone wanted to see it and I wanted to be in it, but I have to move on. I'm not one for moping. \n\"Whether it will come up again down the line, I don't know, but the country knows I'm not scared of Frankie Gavin. We'll see what happens. \n\"I'm pleased to still be able to get another notch on the Lonsdale belt and happy to give Dale Evans this opportunity. He's a nice and down-to-earth lad. \n\"He's beat me, as well, so there's that angle and that can sell a fight on its own, as we've seen with Anthony Joshua and Dillian Whyte.
