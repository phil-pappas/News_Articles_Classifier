The threat was made against Emory’s Oxford campus in Newton County.\nEmory University officials confirmed the arrest in a statement emailed to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. It read: “Emory University Police arrested an Oxford College student on Sunday, Oct. 11, and charged her with making terrorist threats against the university as a result of a social media message that she posted early this morning.”\nAccording to a report on 11Alive, the student posted the threat on Yik Yak, an anonymous messaging service. Students who saw the post passed it along to police.\nThe message read: “I’m shooting up the school. Tomorrow. Stay in your rooms. The ones on the quad are the ones who will go first.”\nOfficials have not identified the student who allegedly made the threat.\nAccording to an email Dean William Bower sent to students Sunday evening just after 8:30 p.m., Emory police identified the person behind the threat as a sophomore student. Bower said the the woman confessed to posting the threat and is currently in custody at the Newton County Jail.\nPlease returnto AJC.com for updates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T20:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T19:39:26.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
