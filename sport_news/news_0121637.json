Thanks to one of the biggest postseason meltdowns on this side of Clippers-Rockets, the Texas Rangers failed to advance to the American League Championship Series this season. But one Ranger that certainly can't be faulted for not leaving it all out on the baseball diamond is third baseman Adrian Beltre.\nAdChoices On Friday, two days after the Rangers blew a 2-0 series lead to fall to the Toronto Blue Jays in the ALDS, general manager Jon Daniels revealed per Evan Grant of the Dallas Morning News that Beltre played the entire second half of the season on a torn ligament in his thumb.\nColby Lewis had a meniscus cleanup today; Daniels confirmed Beltre played 2nd half of season with torn thumb ligament. No word if surgery\n— Evan Grant (@Evan_P_Grant) October 16, 2015\nThough Beltre missed two of the five ALDS games with an unrelated back issue, he managed to log four hits in nine at-bats during the series. Even more impressive are his numbers post-All-Star break when he was supposedly hampered by the ligament tear every time he swung the bat: 11 home runs and 61 RBIs on .318/.376/.509 hitting splits.\nThe production of the 36-year-old Beltre was one of the biggest reasons why a dark horse Rangers team swiped the 2015 AL West division title. And with this latest revelation, it looks like Beltre's attainment of full baseball immortality is just about complete.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/Evan_P_Grant/status/655130902461202432"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:25:12.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
