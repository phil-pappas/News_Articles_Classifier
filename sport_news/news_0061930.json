The New York Red Bulls are assured top spot but there is a fierce five-way battle for second.\nNew England Revolution squandered a chance to go second in the East when they were beaten 1-0 by visiting Montreal and defeat saw them slip to sixth on 47 points.\nA 25-yard strike by midfielder Ignacio Piatti in the 55th minute won the game for the Impact and lifted the Canadian side to fourth place on 48 points.\nIn the West, FC Dallas increased their lead at the top of the standings to six points thanks to a 1-0 away win over Real Salt Lake.\nDallas created precious little until striker David Texeira scored in the 57th minute.\n(Reporting by Andrew Both in Cary, North Carolina; Editing by Peter Rutherford )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T08:05:02.706+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
