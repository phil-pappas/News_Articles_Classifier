(AP) - Three days after a gunman opened fire at a community college in Oregon, New Hampshire authorities are conducting an emergency drill to test responses in a possible similar situation.\nSunday's drill was scheduled well before Thursday's shooting at Umpqua Community College in Oregon, where nine people were killed and seven others wounded.\nThe drill will take place at Goffstown High School and Catholic Medical Center in Manchester, and will examine interactions between local, state and federal officials during a disaster.\nPassersby can expect significant activity at both locations, though traffic will not be obstructed. Simulated injuries may be visible on volunteer participants, and there will be signs at the hospital indicating a drill is underway.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
