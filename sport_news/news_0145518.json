I knew (Stuarts Draft) was going to be tough. They’re a good football team. They’ve got some tough kids and a lot of speed.” \nWhile Buffalo Gap won 22-14, it wasn’t without a fight from Stuarts Draft. \nPlaying on a field was chewed to a slippery mess, making it a test to hold on to a ball slicked with mud, Draft found a running game that stumped the Gap defense on multiple drives, including the Cougars’ first of the game, when senior running back Marston Jones took off for a 78-yard touchdown. \n“He’s a fast kid and they’re capable at any time to pop him one way,” Cline said. “Our kids stepped up and played after that first (touchdown). It took us some time to get up to that speed.” \nBut the most dominant player on the field for Gap was David Mullins who picked up all three of the Bison’s touchdowns \nMullins is Gap’s biggest back, and can punch through even the smallest holes, something he proved when he went toe-to-toe with a strong Stuarts Draft defense. \n“I feel like I say this every week, but in these kind of (rainy) conditions it’s nice to have him there to stick him with the ball and get some yards,” Cline said. \nSTUARTS DRAFT 7 0 0 7 — 14 \nBUFFALO GAP 14 0 8 0 — 22 \nFirst Quarter \nSD — Marston Jones 78 run (Wyrick kick) \nBG — David Mullins 21 run (Pass failed) \nBG — David Mullins 11 run (Comer pass from Wheeler) \nThird Quarter \nBG — David Mullins 3 run (Mullins run) \nFourth Quarter 73 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.newsleader.com/story/sports/high-school/2015/10/09/mullins-buffalo-gap-cage-stuarts-draft/73699384/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:43:08.225+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
