The Alto superintendent confirmed that Cam'ron Matthews died Saturday after collapsing during a Friday night game, KLTV reports—making the junior the sixth high school football player to die in the US this season, USA Today notes. Right before a kickoff late in the first half of the game, Cam'ron had mentioned to teammates he felt dizzy, and he collapsed on the sidelines shortly thereafter; initial reports indicated he had had a seizure. He was airlifted to a local hospital and pronounced dead just after 6pm Saturday. Cam'ron's status as the sixth death is just a continuation of last year's sobering stats. Per the National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury Research , 11 high school players died last year: five from direct fatalities such as head or spinal injuries, and six from indirect fatalities, including heatstroke and water intoxication. And he wasn't the only one who suffered a serious injury on the field this weekend: Brandon Massey, a sophomore at Durham's Jordan High School in North Carolina, broke his neck during a Friday game and will be undergoing surgery Sunday, High School OT reports. Meanwhile, the Alto community came together to remember Cam'ron at a Saturday night vigil. \"When you have your own kids and you want them to emulate someone and follow in their footsteps, Cam'ron was a perfect example of that,\" the school superintendent said, per KTRE . \"He was a great kid in the classroom, unbelievable athlete, but more importantly, just a great, great kid.\" (A Seattle player died just over two weeks ago.)
