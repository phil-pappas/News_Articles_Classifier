By Greg FarrarMichele and Kent Van Slyke pose with her brushed- and powder-coated steel and gold leaf sculpture, ‘The One Who Reached the Star’ installed in the Sammamish City Hall Commons Art Gallery for their ‘You & Me, Me & You’ show, presented by the Sammamish Arts Commission through Jan. 15, 2016. \nThat’s about to change. At age 72 and 70, respectively, husband and wife team Kent and Michele Van Slyke are the latest artists whose work is on display in the Sammamish City Hall Commons Art Gallery. “You & Me, Me & You” will feature the steel sculpture of Michele and the photography of Kent. \nA reception is from 6-8 p.m. Oct. 22 in the Commons Gallery. The exhibit runs through Jan. 16. \n“We are very different in our work,” said Michele, who added she doesn’t really remember ever not being an artist, though she says she went to college to become an interpreter. She admits that was mostly to make her parents happy. \nAs for Kent, he spent most of his life as a graphic designer working in advertising. He’s now retired and photography has become front and center to him. \nBoth Michele and Kent are inspired by the many trips they have taken to France (where Michele was born), to Japan and to China. For the show, Kent’s photos are largely images from those trips. In fact, the wall of a second-floor balcony in City Hall is covered with photos from Europe and China. \nMichele works mostly with welded steel. She said the Sammamish show provided an interesting challenge in that she had to find pieces to fit the space. The hallway inside City Hall is lined with columns on both sides. For one column, Michele created an all new piece, a flock of birds, with one small bird gliding in front and reaching the stars ahead of the others. \nMichele said she uses a lot of birds and wing shapes in her work, as well as nature in general. \nThe show is designed to demonstrate how two people, who are about as close as two people can get, can have the same experience but express that experience in totally different ways. For the most part, the two are intertwining their displays in Sammamish. \n“It’s two different points of view,” Kent said. “It’s going to be very interesting.” \n“It’s kind of difficult to combine the two media,” Michele added. \nAnd while they have not specifically ever worked together, they do bounce ideas off of each other in the Bainbridge Island studio they have shared for 40 years. \n“We don’t step on each others toes,” Kent said. “I’m basically a 2-dimensional person and she is very much a 3-dimensional person.” \nMichele has created a lot of public art around the area, including in front of the Issaquah Library. She has completed pieces for spots in Japan and China as well. She admits to a fascination with China and its culture. \n“I actually tried to teach myself Chinese on my own when I was 8,” she said. \nWritten by Tom Corrigan · Filed Under Community , Local News \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:53:28.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
