The Indian team showed a lot of intent right from the start, launching several attacks to keep the hosts under pressure right through the first quarter. In the 10th minute, India earned their first penalty corner. Rupinder Pal Singh converted it to give India an early lead. The goal put the hosts on the back-foot. They tried hard to negate the lead but the Indian defence thwarted their efforts. In the second quarter, India again looked the dominant side, at least at the start. They came close to increasing the lead when Nikkin Thimmaiah pushed the ball into the opponents’ circle, and Mandeep Singh managed to defect it towards the goal. His strike, however, missed the citadel by a whisker. Soon after that, the Kiwis fashioned a counterattack, and managed to break through the Indian defence to find an equaliser in the 22nd minute. The first half of the game ended with the teams tied at 1-1. In the 41st minute, Akashdeep Singh got hold of the ball and gave a nice pass to Ramandeep Singh, who sounded the board to put India ahead again. The hosts fought back again and levelled the score (2-2) in the 52nd minute with Steve Edwards scoring a field goal. The equaliser spurred India to intensify their attacks. Their effort bore fruit when Dharamvir Singh found the back of the net in the last minute to give India a thrilling victory. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:11:36.519+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
