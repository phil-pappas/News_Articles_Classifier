Bob Stoops' team will get its first shot at ridding itself of the upset loss to the Texas Longhorns at the Red River Showdown.\nHere's a quick scouting report of the Wildcats:\nRecord : 3-2, 0-2 in Big 12\nLast : Lost to No. 2 TCU 52-45\nKey number : 44 -- the number of rushing attempts Kansas State averages per game.\n1). Typical Bill Snyder team\nQuick! Name five players on the Kansas State football roster.\nIf five names came to mind, that's impressive. Bill Snyder's team might not have that big-name player that casual football fans know, but his teams are always competitive.\nThe Wildcats were picked by the media to finish as the No. 7 team in the Big 12 before the season started . Kansas State might just be one game above .500, but they've played Oklahoma State and TCU tough in those two losses.\nOne prime example of how resilient Kansas State is was the loss to Oklahoma State.\nStarting quarterback Joe Hubener left the game against the Pokes due to injury, so the Wildcats had to roll with wide receiver Kody Cook at quarterback. All he did was go 10-16 for 122 yards and two touchdowns while racking up 87 rushing yards and a touchdown on the ground. How many other teams could go on the road against a ranked team and only lose by two points with a wide receiver at quarterback?\n2. The run-pass option\nOne play that Kansas State utilizes well is a play that is designed as a run but has a passing option.\nHubener is a threat through the air and on the ground. In the gif above, Hubener runs a run-pass option play. When the ball is snapped, he'll sit back and see what the defense is doing. If it drops back into coverage, he'll tuck it and take off.\nThe tricky part about defending this is his ability to throw. If he stutter steps in the backfield and acts like he's going to run, defenders can get sucked in leaving their man open. Hubener can throw it right as he gets to the line of scrimmage burning the defense. Throw in the read-option plays and the KSU offense can be a handful to defend.\nThe Texas Longhorns a week ago were able to run the ball extremely effectively against the Sooners defense. Jerrod Heard and the Longhorn running backs were able to take advantage of Oklahoma's aggressive rush off the edges by going straight up the middle.\nThe Sooners will need linebackers Eric Striker and Dominique Alexander to be on their A-game to stop the Wildcats.\n3. Top run defense in the Big 12, but...\nThrough five games, no Big 12 team has given up less rush yards per game than the Wildcats (105.2 yards per game). Oklahoma State was only able to muster 49 rushing yards on 27 attempts two weeks ago.\nHowever, TCU's Trevone Boykin and Aaron Green absolutely torched the Wildcat defense. Each had 11 carries and each had 120-plus yards.\nSamaje Perine, Joe Mixon and Baker Mayfield certainly could attack the KSU defense and perform well. But, just as it is every week, it'll be up to Lincoln Riley to actually utilize his backs.\n4. Blown halftime leads\nKansas State has been in excellent positions to win its last two ballgames. Against Oklahoma State, the Wildcats scored first and eventually had a 28-13 lead in the first half. Against TCU, Kansas State was up 35-17 against the No. 2 team in the nation.\nSnyder's team ended up losing to OSU by two and TCU by seven.\n5. The rushing attack\nKansas State is a run-first team. The team has only attempted 125 passes all season compared to 220 rushes, good for 44 attempts per game. The Wildcats are by no means an offensive juggernaut, but 180 rushing yards per game is nothing to scoff at, especially since the Sooners just gave up 313 rushing yards.\nAnother advantage of running the ball so much is keeping Mayfield and the Sooners offense on the sideline.\nTwitter: @Josh_Friemel\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://www.big12sports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?ATCLID=210216058", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-10-14T04:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T19:53:49.840+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
