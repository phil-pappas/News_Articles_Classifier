It was Malhi’s second straight three-sack performance. \nJackson, a Pelham resident, had five receptions for 85 yards and one touchdown and rushed twice for 51 yards and another score as Central Catholic rolled over Everett 24-0. \nAlso available, as always, are predictions on the weekend’s games by Mike Muldoon and myself (David Willis). \nFarnham makes Pens \nNorth Andover’s Bobby Farnham will open the season in the NHL, as the former Eagle-Tribune MVP was named to the Pittsburgh Penguins’ opening day roster. \n“You’re looking at your phone from 9 to 12, hoping you don’t get a call,” the diminutive tough guy told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review. “It was nice to stick around and be a part of this.” \nThe Pens open the season on Thursday by hosting Dallas. \nD’ANDRE’S BIG DAY \nFormer Central Catholic star D’Andre Drummond-Mayrie delivered his best day yet for the University of New Hampshire over the weekend. The true sophomore scored his first career interception and made five tackles, one short of his career-best, in a victory over Elon. \nMCANDREW THE WORKER \nAnyone that has seen Methuen running back Brian McAndrew play football, or seen his stellar grades, knows he is a worker. But that extends beyond Methuen High. \nOver the summer, McAndrew worked two jobs, at Manos Pizza and at Market Basket in Methuen. Even with football and school, he continues to work when he can at Manos. \nCakes are baking \nBelated happy birthday wishes go out to a pair of for Salem wrestling superstars, Trevor Dearden (26) and Aaron Kalil (27). They share an Oct. 5 birthday. \nDearden, selected to the Salem-Woodbury Hall of Fame this fall, was a three-time New England champion while Kalil is now wrestling for the US Marine Corps. \nA-ROD’s STRUGGLES \nAnyone that has a passing interest in baseball knows that Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez has a reputation for struggling in the playoffs, and the stats back that up. After Tuesday’s 0-for-4 night, A-Rod is now 0 for his last 19 in the postseason with runners in scoring position, and has a career .156 playoff average with runners in scoring position. \n... \nDavid Willis is a sportswriter/videographer for The Eagle-Tribune.
