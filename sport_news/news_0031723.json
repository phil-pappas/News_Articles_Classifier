(Photo: Mike Granse, USA TODAY Sports)\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE An almost unprecedented flurry of events over the past few days has left us with an unusual situation in college football's top division.\nAt the moment, there are five programs headed by interim coaches. There was a sixth, but Norries Wilson has now handed the reins at Rutgers back to his boss, Kyle Flood, who is back from his three-game suspension. Here's a ranking of the other five in terms of the difficulty level they face just to see the season through to some sort of a conclusion.\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. Mike Canales, North Texas As fate would have it, this is Canales's second stint as the Mean Green's interim head coach. The first came in 2010, when Todd Dodge was fired after seven games. Translation: this might not be a terribly desirable gig right now. Just getting into the win column would be a major accomplishment with the current roster. There aren't many opportunities to get a \"W\" left on the Mean Green's slate — tonight's televised clash with Western Kentucky is not one. The best shot might be a Halloween home date against UT-San Antonio.\nMike Locksley, Maryland Locksley does have head coaching experience, though he'd probably rather forget about it. His two-plus year stint at New Mexico did not go well, on or off the field. He now finds himself in caretaker mode in what is already a lost season in College Park. The Terrapins at least have a bye week before hosting Penn State, but the second-half schedule is quite daunting. The season-ending visit to Rutgers might be the Terps' best hope for another victory.\nShawn Elliott, South Carolina Only the apparent futility of the first two squads mentioned keeps this situation from a higher spot on this list. Elliott, after all, is only stepping in for a legend. The Gamecocks' next contest against Vanderbilt is winnable, though even the Commodores are playing stout defense these days. With the likes of Texas A&M, Florida and — oh yeah — Clemson still to come, a postseason appearance is unlikely.\nUSC interim head coach Clay Helton (Photo: Richard Hartog, AP)\nClay Helton, Southern California It won't be easy by any means, but this might be a case where a change does everybody good. The Trojans' second-half schedule is a killer to say the least, starting this weekend at Notre Dame. A Pac-12 title is improbable, but there's still enough talent on the USC team to spoil someone's bid for one.\nBill Cubit, Illinois Right now this is the least challenging of the five spots because Cubit has held the interim tag since the season began. The Fighting Illlini are just two wins away from bowl eligibility, but there are no true gimmes left on the schedule. The Purdue game is on the road, and the trip to Minnesota follows the home contest against Ohio State. With the Illini idle this weekend, the Oct. 24 home date with Wisconsin could be a must.\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST USC begins its search for a new coach | 01:47 USA Today Sports' Jason Armesto discusses potential candidates who could fill the head coach position at USC.
