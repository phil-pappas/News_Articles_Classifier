Or maybe they’re just too good to care. \nJake Arrieta allowed four hits in nine dominant innings and the Cubs rolled to a 4-0 win over the Pittsburgh Pirates in the NL wild-card game Wednesday night. \nArrieta struck out 11 without a walk. He also dusted himself off after getting plunked by Pittsburgh reliever Tony Watson to send the Cubs to the NL Division Series in St. Louis starting on Friday. \n“I’m exhausted. I haven’t felt this way all year,” said Arrieta, who led the majors with 22 wins. “This atmosphere, the energy was unbelievable. Tried to use it to the best of my ability. They were loud, they were really loud.” \nDexter Fowler homered and scored three times for the Cubs. Kyle Schwarber added a towering two-run shot off Pittsburgh starter Gerrit Cole as Chicago raced to an early lead and let Arrieta do the rest. \nThe largest crowd ever at PNC Park failed to rattle Arrieta or one of baseball’s youngest teams. First-year manager Joe Maddon’s club played with swagger and confidence and looked right at home while snapping a nine-game playoff losing streak that dated to the 2003 NL Championship Series. \n“It’s tremendous for the city. It’s been a while,” Arrieta said. “Chicago’s been waiting for this.” \nPittsburgh was knocked out after finishing second in the majors with 98 victories this year. Last year, the Pirates also were shut out on four hits in the wild-card game, losing to the Giants. \n“Well, sports is hard. Life’s not fair. You go out and play. You get beat, you move on,” manager Clint Hurdle said. \nThe bearded, 29-year-old Arrieta, still unbeaten since July 25, stretched his remarkable second half — in which he posted an 0.75 ERA — into the opening round of the playoffs. He threw the first complete-game shutout for the Cubs in the postseason since Claude Passeau tossed a one-hitter in the 1945 World Series against Detroit. \nArrieta even laughed off a weird sequence in the seventh when Watson’s fastball hit him in his left side. The benches and bullpens cleared when Watson was issued a warning, leading to little more than a few heated exchanges. \n“I hit two guys, unintentionally. I’m not trying to hurt or hit anybody,” Arrieta said. “Balls were slick tonight. I just lost it a couple of times, it kind of ran away from me. \n“I expected that. They’re going to take care of their own guys. It’s understandable. Everything after that was fine.” \nPirates utility player Sean Rodriguez, who’d already been pulled, was ejected and proceeded to give an unsuspecting water cooler a series of one-two combinations, eventually sending it tumbling to the ground. \nPittsburgh had no such luck against Arrieta, with Hurdle seemingly flummoxed on how to get to attack a right-hander who has matured from raw project into overpowering force. \nHurdle shelved slugger Pedro Alvarez — whose 27 homers led the team but whose 23 errors made him a defensive liability — in favor of more sure-handed Rodriguez. Hurdle pointed to the athleticism Rodriguez brought as a major factor, figuring the Pirates would need to get creative to score against Arrieta rather than hope Alvarez runs into the kind of mistake Arrieta has avoided nearly all season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:21:14.317+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
