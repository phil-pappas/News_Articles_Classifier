Last year the atmosphere was so awesome,\" David Henson said. \"Everybody had fun.\" \nOne bar, McFadden's, is quickly becoming a hot after party spot for the Royals players, too. The tradition started after a rain-out game last season. \n\"A couple of our favorite guys came down here and just naturally created friendships that we'll have forever,\" General Manager Mike Ferger said. \nMcFadden's has its own pregame tradition, too. Before a game, managers will pour a bottle of blue liquid into the district's fountain for good luck. \n\"We realized the centerpiece of our live block wasn't blue,\" Ferger said. \"So we made our special potion, our Royal blue potion and dumped it in there. And they won. And they advanced.\" \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.) All rights reserved.
