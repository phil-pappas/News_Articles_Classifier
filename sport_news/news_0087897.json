Posted: Monday, October 12, 2015 3:22 pm Sobrato caps strong week with Polofest sweep Cheeto Barrera Sports Editor MorganHillTimes.com | 0 comments \nSobrato has had in incredible week. \nIt started with a dramatic win over Pioneer on Oct. 7 and ended with a sweep of Polofest, which included a rout of crosstown rival Live Oak. \n“We wanted to defend our home turf. … We had a chance to let our subs play who normally don’t get much time. It was fun to cheer them on and see them score some goals,” said Oliver Jensen. \nBefore the start of the tournament, the Bulldogs had a dramatic 11-9 win over Pioneer. \n“Everybody was so hyped after that game, it was ridiculous,” Jensen said. “I think we really used that momentum to carry over into the tournament.” \nCoach David Letts said that win helped to carry over to the tournament. He said the defensive emphasis against Pioneer helped in the Live Oak game where Sobrato yielded one goal for the game. \n“It’s been a main focus. If we shut them down, now we can go back and score some goals,” Letts said. \nThe Bulldogs won that game 12-1 when they gave up just eight shots on goal. \n“We struggled early in the season with some defensive issues and we lost a lot of close games,” Jensen said. “That was really stressful. I like to see the less experienced guys go out and play well against a team like Live Oak.” \nMeanwhile, the offense was well distributed as eight players scored goals and no one had more than two goals. \n“The more people we get involved, the harder you are to stop, no matter what sport you’re playing,” Letts said. “We have a lot of seniors who have been playing for three or four years now. They’re starting to understand it’s their last year and they need to work hard.” \nSimon Caruso led things off with two quick goals as Sobrato converted five of seven shots on goal. \nColin Kyle, Clayton Sawyer and Parth Shah all scored for a 5-0 lead after the first quarter. \nSawyer added a second goal in the second quarter, as Jensen, Kaden Foster and David Olson all got on the board for a 9-0 halftime lead. \nSobrato converted four of six shots on goal to hold a comfortable lead in the second half. \nThe Bulldogs scored three more times before the game’s end, as Derek Jordan got on the score sheet with Olson and Kyle added second goals. \nKeeper Blake Mosher stopped seven of eight shots, including a 5-meter shot in the fourth quarter. \nThe Live Oak win was one of four in a sweep of Polofest, as the Bulldogs also took down Lincoln 10-4, followed by wins over Christopher 13-8 and Santa Clara 12-3. \nSobrato will next host Leland on Wednesday starting at 4 p.m. Letts is a Hall of Famer \nAfter hosting Leland, Letts will be honored by his alma matter when he is inducted into the Live Oak Hall of Fame during a ceremony on Friday. Letts is one of 10 athletes and two coaches who will be honored before Live Oak’s football game against Santa Teresa. \nLetts, a 1998 graduate, said it is a great honor, but gave credit to his teammates who made his run special. \nWhen asked about having a Hall of Famer for a coach, Jensen heaped praise on his skipper. \n“He’s a really good coach. When he gets in the water, it’s pretty ridiculous,” Jensen said. “He can do some pretty cool stuff. He’s a great coach and a great mentor. I’m just glad he’s our coach.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T11:50:40.682+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
