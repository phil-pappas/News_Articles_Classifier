The Bills (3-4) were playing in the British capital for the first time. \nThe game, which started at 9:30 a.m. EDT, was streamed live on Yahoo's website outside the Buffalo and Jacksonville markets, although it was televised in those two areas. \nEJ Manuel started at quarterback for the Bills for the second straight game because of the absence of the injured Tyrod Taylor. \nManuel's early struggles allowed Jacksonville to take a 27-3 lead, but Manuel led the rally until the Jaguars took over for good in the final minutes. \nBortles was 13 of 29 for 182 yards, two touchdowns and one interception. The defense was even better, though, scoring two touchdowns in a 7-second span and setting up another for T.J. Yeldon, who finished with 116 yards. \nTrailing 3-0, Bortles hit Allen Robinson on a 10-yard touchdown pass. Then the defense stepped up. \nOn third-and-9, Aaron Colvin forced a fumble from Manuel. Sergio Brown nearly smothered the ball, but Chris Clemons grabbed the loose ball and ran 6 yards into the end zone. \nAfter the kickoff and a touchback, Manuel was again in the pocket but his pass was picked off by Telvin Smith, who ran it in from the 26. \nAnd the defense wasn't done yet. On the fourth play of the next drive, Manuel was again picked off, this time by Paul Posluszny. \nThe Jaguars' offense didn't disappoint this time, with Yeldon running it in from the 28 to give Jacksonville a 27-3 lead after Jason Myers missed the extra point. \nThe Bills' comeback started when Manuel completed a 16-yard touchdown pass to Robert Woods. That score and another field goal from Dan Carpenter made it 27-13 at the half. \nIn the fourth quarter, Carpenter kicked a third field goal before Manuel hit Marcus Easley on a 58-yard touchdown pass — only minutes before Graham gave the Bills a 31-27 lead with 5:21 left. \nManuel started at quarterback for the second straight game, and for the second straight loss. He finished with 298 yards on 24 of 42 passing with two touchdowns and two interceptions. \nManuel was starting because Taylor sprained a ligament in his left knee in the 14-13 win over Tennessee on Oct. 11. With a week off after the trip, as usual for teams playing in London, Taylor will have more time to heal before the Bills host the Miami Dolphins on Nov. 8. \nThe Jaguars, who will again travel to London next season, next play at the New York Jets, also on Nov. 8. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T19:47:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:59:07.842+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
