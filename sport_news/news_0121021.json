Barrett finished five touchdown drives as a red zone specialist, providing a much-needed spark in Ohio State's 49-28 victory over Maryland on Saturday. \nIf J.T. is the right guy in the red zone, in that situation, why isn't J.T. the right guy all the time? \nOSU's head coach, pausing to collect his thoughts, or simply flat-out stumped, fumbled with the bottled drink in front of him and flashed an exasperated grin. \n\"We just won, man,\" Meyer sighed. \"I'm going to go enjoy a nice Gatorade tonight. That's a good question and J.T. is ... they're both very good quarterbacks (referring also to starter Cardale Jones.) They both played well. I'm going to hug them both and say great job, well done.\" \nHow much of Saturday's quarterback rotation was a product of playing a team whose head coach, Randy Edsall, is a dead man walking? Or a product of Meyer's genius? We'll probably have a better answer as soon as next Saturday night's visit from 5-1 Penn State. \nFor now, everything's peachy. Barrett, a 2014 Heisman finalist, was pulled out of moth balls and Jones, an easy target for Twitter trolls the last couple of weeks, looked like the guy who magically navigated the Buckeyes through a 2014 post-season gauntlet to a national championship. \nJones completed 21 of 28 passes for 291 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions. Criticized by his head coach for several underthrown balls two weeks ago against Western Michigan, he found Jalin Marshall behind the secondary for a 48-yard score and threw perfect strikes of 33 and 19 yards to Braxton Miller on back-to-back plays, the latter completing one of six red zone touchdowns by the Buckeyes. \nThey came into the game 121st out of 127 FBS schools in red zone efficiency with only six touchdowns in 16 trips inside the 20. Saturday they batted a perfect 1.000. \nWhen that stat was brought up, Meyer asked the reporter to repeat the question. \n\"I know; I heard you the first time,\" Meyer joked. \"I just wanted you to say it again ... six for six, no turnovers.\" \nOn one scoring sequence, the Buckeyes undoubtedly set a school record by playing three quarterbacks on three consecutive snaps in the first quarter. That's not to suggest that Miller, a two-time Big Ten Player of the Year, is back in the quarterback derby. Better to fixate on his career-high five receptions â€” a good sign that he is back in the passing scheme after spending the last several weeks looking like little more than a Wildcat specialist. \nIf the Buckeyes can continue to work Miller into the flow at his new position, get Ezekiel Elliott untracked before the second half and make this quarterback collaboration work against more than the dregs of the Big Ten, a repeat national championship will come into sharper view. \nBut I have my doubts about this quarterback shuffle. \nEveryone wants to compare it to what Meyer did in winning a national championship at Florida in 2006 with starting quarterback Chris Leak and red zone specialist Tim Tebow. It worked because nobody knew then how great Tebow would become. He was only a freshman, being eased into the gameplan. And Leak was more of a game-manager who didn't have an argument for having the job all to himself. \nAll we've heard is that Jones and Barrett have put egos aside for the good of the team, but Jones can't be happy coming out every time the Buckeyes are on the cusp of scoring. And Barrett, after setting 19 school and Big Ten records last season, can't be thrilled about being a sometimes-player who arguably does everything better at the position than throw the deep ball. \nGiven Jones' shaky play in recent weeks, why not leave him in Saturday on those promising drives? The Buckeyes never seemed in serious danger of losing, even though they trailed 7-0 and it was 21-21 in the third quarter. After falling behind, OSU reeled off 21 straight points. After it was tied, another avalanche of 28 points. \nIf Jones struggled in the red zone against a Maryland team so bad that coach Randy Edsall might not survive the upcoming bye week, then Jones would deserve to get benched. And the Buckeyes could start fresh, still unbeaten (presumably) for the much tougher second half of the season. \nInstead, Meyer seems bent on winning games while still finding a way to keep Jones in the starting role. By doing so, even he knows he's keeping the pilot light burning under this simmering quarterback controversy. \n\"The attention to this thing, I'm exhausted from it,\" Meyer said. \"I don't read my phone often, so I can imagine what those two young guys ... they stay pretty focused, and they've got a support group that's really, really strong.\" \nFor what it's worth, Meyer didn't come to this decision easily. Or even unilaterally. \nAccording to Jones, Meyer told his quarterbacks he was going for his usual Monday walk to give the time-share some thought. Then he asked them to think about his plan for a couple of hours and report back to the facility with their opinions. \n\"I agreed with him,\" said Jones, the half of the winning duo to meet with the media. \"J.T. brings an element to the run game and certain positions on the field .. or just period. \n\"I think it can work. Coach Meyer does a good job of managing it. The plan was to improve our red zone offense by adding an extra element, the quarterback run, which (Barrett) is unbelievable in doing. \n\"If it will help us win, I'm down with it.\" \nAre you?", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:49:32.918+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
