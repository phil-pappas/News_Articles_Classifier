It marks the two schools' 47th meeting. Oakland has won the past two meetings, but trail the series 33-13. \nOakland's defensive dominance comes despite several key graduation losses on that side of the ball, including college signees Josh Smith (linebacker), Kevin Prather (linebacker), Anthony Akers (defensive line), Tyler Black (defensive back) and Josh Cunningham (defensive back). \nOakland first-year coach Kevin Creasy said defense has been a priority for the Patriots. \n\"We pride ourselves in playing good defense,\" Creasy said. \"That's what has put us in the position we are in now. If we hadn't played really well on defense, we'd have a whole lot more than one loss. \n\"They've saved us on several occasions. We're going to rely on them heavily this week.\" \nOakland has picked off 11 passes and recovered six fumbles this season. \nLSU commitment JaCoby Stevens has 39 tackles, three interceptions and recovered two fumbles. Safety Kaleb Oliver has 47 tackles and two interceptions. And linebacker Jackson Cauthen has 73 tackles and two interceptions. \nBoth Oliver and Cauthen are first-year starters for the Patriots. \n\"We're just taking film more seriously as a defense,\" Stevens. \"Of course, we have Ty, Turrell Ward and Mark Pruitt as our defensive leaders. We're just listening to them.\" \nNix, a three-year starter on the defensive line, has been an anchor up front. He has 28 tackles with three sacks and an interception. He moved from defensive tackle to defensive end. \n\"My coaches told me in the preseason that I'd play just about every spot on the D-line this year,\" Nix said. \"I said I was up for anything just to help the team.\" \nReach Tom Kreager at 615-278-5168 and on Twitter @Kreager. \nFriday's Games \n(All games at 7 p.m.) \nRiverdale at Oakland*", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:29:33.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
