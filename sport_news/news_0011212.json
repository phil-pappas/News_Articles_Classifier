Odor streaked home and crossed the plate as the rest of the Blue Jays — and their fans — looked on in utter confusion.\nAfter a lengthy replay review and torrent of fan-thrown garbage delayed the game, umpires ruled the run would stand, giving the Rangers 3-2 lead in the top of the 7th.\nRELATED: Rangers-Blue Jays 14-inning game historic\nFans demanded swift retribution as many were escorted out by security following the hail of debris they reigned down upon the field.\nIn this case, it appears Karma was swift.\nThe bottom of the seventh saw the Rangers commit three consecutive errors, and before rage could grip all of Canada, Jose Bautista cranked one into the obstreperous stands.\nJust like that the Blue Jays were back up 6-3 heading into the eighth.\nIn the span of an inning, emotions from Rangers and Blue Jays fans touched every portion of the spectrum. Here's a look at some of the best reactions to what may be remembered as one of the most chaotic series of events ever witnessed in a postseason baseball game.\nClick through the slides above to see the best and worst of social media's reactions.\nnmoyle@express-news.net\nTwitter: @NRMoyle", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/24/8791358/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791376/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/24/8791347/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/24/8791347/4/920x920.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/24/8791358/4/920x920.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791390/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791383/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791392/4/920x920.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/24/8791345/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791383/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791363/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791360/5/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/24/8791353/4/920x920.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791393/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791395/4/920x920.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/24/8791353/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791390/4/920x920.png", "https://platform.vine.co/static/scripts/embed.js", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791392/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791360/5/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791395/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791393/4/square_gallery_thumb.png", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/24/8791345/4/920x920.png", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791363/4/920x920.png", "https://vine.co/v/eEwlJPaZdtO/embed/simple", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/42/25/8791376/4/square_gallery_thumb.png"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:30:56.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
