Fisher Catholic won sectional and district championships and enters the tournament with the lowest qualifying score. With an 18-hole average in the mid-70s, Wood has been the team’s No. 1 player for most of the season.\nProvided all goes as planned in district and regional cross country competition, Wood hopes to qualify for his third state meet, on Nov. 7 at National Trail Raceway outside Hebron.\nThis fall, he was won nine of 10 races, the only defeat coming to national leader Andrew Jordan of Watkins Memorial by a mere 9 seconds. He ranks No. 2 in the state in Division III with a 5,000-meter best of 15 minutes, 30.3 seconds.\n“I know it’s a lot to ask, but my goal is for our team to win the state championship this weekend and then for me to come back and win it in cross country in three weeks,” Wood said. “That’s my focus and my dream, and whether or not it happens, I know I’ve paid my dues in order to make it a reality.”\nWood took up golf at age 8 and later developed into an outstanding distance runner in track. When a friend suggested he attempt golf and cross country as a freshman, he balked.\n“I never really thought about running cross country because I didn’t think it was, Quote: -unQuote: , cool, and I didn’t imagine it being nearly as fun as golf,” Wood said. “As I started having more success in track, I gave it more consideration and decided I might want to try it (as a sophomore).\n“The great thing about being at a small school like Fisher Catholic is that kids are encouraged to play multiple sports and the coaches are very supportive of each other. We worked it out so I could do both sports.”\nGolf coach Travis Saffell and cross country coach Mary Smith said Wood has the maturity and discipline to manage his practice schedule.\n“He handles everything himself and does a brilliant job making it work,” Saffell said. “Being a runner helps him on the golf course in many respects because he brings such an unbelievable work ethic and competitiveness. He sets the bar so high for himself and his teammates. He comes into a pressurized situation and performs very well when the chips are down.”\nWood said he typically gets his running workouts from Smith a day in advance and runs at 5:30 or 6 a.m. He practices with the golf team after school. Often, he goes on a second training run during the evening.\n“It takes an awful lot of mental focus and discipline to play these two sports in particular,” Smith said. “It’s a rare combination, for sure, but you can draw some comparisons with the two sports, most notably in course management.”\nOn three Saturdays this fall, Wood traveled directly from one competition to another. On Saturday, the state golf tournament will force him to miss the Mid-State League cross country championships.\n“It’s taxing at times, but I’ve gotten used to it,” Wood said. “It has become kind of a joke with my golf teammates because they say that I always play better after I’ve just gotten done with a race. Actually, it’s harder to run after playing golf because of the mental stress and because you’ve been carrying that big bag around for four hours.”\nIn golf, Wood tied for 24th in the state in 2013 and tied for 14th a year ago. In cross country, he was 71st as a sophomore and 13th last year.\nWood expects the state tournament to be his final golf competition. He plans to run track and cross country and study mathematics in college. Notre Dame is his “dream” school, but the door is wide open.\n“This is my last hurrah in golf,” he said, “and I’d like it to be a memory I’ll cherish forever.”< /p>\nsblackledge@dispatch.com\n@BlackiePreps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T13:28:49.627+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
