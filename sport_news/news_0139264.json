When I was about 10, I asked my older brother Mike where the huge electrical lines at Etobicoke’s Centennial Park went, and he said if you follow them all the way, you’ll reach China. So of course a few days later I started following the lines in a westerly direction until I got as far as some gas station in Mississauga and asked the attendant if I was in China. \nNot the sharpest knife in the drawer. But you have to forgive kids for their indiscretions. \nAnd in that light, you have to forgive Blue Jays closer Roberto Osuna for his sub-par performance in picking up the loss in Toronto’s 4-3 defeat at the hands of the Kansas City Royals on Friday night, a loss that eliminated the Jays from the playoffs. \nDespite his size and stature, Osuna really is just a kid, a 20-year-old reliever in his rookie year playing against guys who were already well on their way to the pros when he was born. Osuna gave up the winning run in the bottom of the eighth following a 45-minute rain delay and took the loss, a devastating end to what had been a season of celebration for the young Mexican and the Jays, who don’t have to worry about a closer now for the next few years. \nOsuna was entitled to a bad outing, even more so when you consider what he was going through, mentally and physically. Everyone is aware that the native of Sinaloa, Mexico had been having problems with a broken nail embedded in the middle finger of his pitching hand which prevented him from throwing a slider, his strikeout pitch. That problem had cleared up somewhat in recent days but he also had another issue weighing on his mind on Friday. \nHurricane Patricia, described as the strongest storm ever recorded in the Western Hemisphere with winds of 190 mph, was barrelling towards the Mexican west coast, just south of Osuna’s home state of Sinaloa. \nThroughout the day, Osuna had no way of knowing if Hurricane Patricia was going to veer north and slam into his home state. Prior to Game 6, the deeply religious fireballer, who spends a few moments before every appearance praying just off the mound, tweeted an image of Jesus Christ and asking people to pray for Mexico. \nWhat was happening in his homeland certainly trumped a ball game, but Osuna had to put all of that aside to try to do his job in the incredible pressure-cooker of the MLB playoffs. Afterwards, inside a quiet Blue Jays clubhouse, Osuna was asked if he was all distracted by what was going down back home. \n“No, not really,” he said, not sounding terribly convincing. “Not really. There’s no excuses.” \nThere aren’t any excuses, but there certainly were extenuating circumstances. Still, when the game was over, the first player who made himself available to the media inside the visiting clubhouse at Kauffman Stadium was Osuna. \n“I feel sad and happy at the same time,” he said. “Sad because we (lost) but we worked really hard this year and I’m happy with what we did all year.” \nThe Jays are certainly happy with Osuna and nobody on the team was throwing the young pitcher under the bus. Perhaps going 0-for-12 with runners in scoring position had more to do with the Blue Jays demise in Game 6 than a poor inning by their closer. The Jays rushed to defend Osuna when it was all over — and well they should have. \n“Anybody who gives up a lead late in the game, you feel for that guy,” said Game 6 starter David Price, when asked about Osuna. “And his body of work this year, being 20 years old, being able to get the last three outs of the ball game, which are definitely the hardest three outs to get at this level ... he’s done a fantastic job of doing that all year long.” \nOne game certainly won’t define Osuna’s entire rookie year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:12:53.422+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
