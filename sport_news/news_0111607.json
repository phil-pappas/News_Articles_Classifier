Other health parameters too were worrisome.\nDoctors treating him at the hospital also suggested that Jagan take a liquid diet to improve his condition though he wanted to continue with his hunger strike. They administered him fluids intravenously. The Leader of Opposition in AP Assembly has been kept under observation.\nSpeaking to mediamen after Jagan's hospitalisation, his sister Sharmila alleged that CM Chandrababu Naidu made the 42-year-old leader break his fast as Prime Minister Narendra Modi was visiting the state on October 22 to lay the foundation stone for the state's new capital Amaravati.\nMeanwhile, YSRCP leader Botsa Satyanarayana lauded Jagan's determination to fight for people of Andhra Pradesh and said that the party would chalk out its next course of action towards achieving special category status to the state.\nThe promise of special category status was made to Seemandhra (new Andhra Pradesh) by the then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh in Parliament during bifurcation of Andhra Pradesh last year.\nYSR Congress, Congress, Left parties have been hitting out at the TDP-BJP combine for not granting special status even one year after coming to power.\nThe NDA government has asked NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya to go into the issue. â€”PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T11:28:37.123+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
