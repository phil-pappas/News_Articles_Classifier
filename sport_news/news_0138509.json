I think it really went away after the first pitch I threw.”\nThe big question now might be whether manager Terry Collins intends to use deGrom on short rest for a potential Game 4 start on Tuesday at Citi Field. Collins’ initial reaction was deGrom worked too hard to be considered for a return on short rest.\n“I think he went too far tonight,” Collins said.\nDavid Wright’s two-run single in the seventh against Pedro Baez gave the Mets the cushion they needed after nursing a 1-0 lead provided by Daniel Murphy’s home run against Kershaw in the fourth.\n“That’s about as sweet as I thought it was going to be,” Wright said after his first playoff game in nine years.\nTyler Clippard surrendered an RBI single to Adrian Gonzalez in the eighth before Jeurys Familia entered and retired tying run Justin Turner before working a perfect ninth for the save.\nAnother pitching showdown is expected Saturday, when Noah Syndergaard is scheduled to face Zack Greinke in Game 2. The rookie Syndergaard matched Kershaw in a no-decision at Dodger Stadium on July 3 and Greinke is the co-favorite for the NL Cy Young award, after posting a 1.66 ERA this season.\nThe Mets overcame two Michael Cuddyer fielding flubs in left field to win their fourth straight against the Dodgers in the postseason dating to 2006.\nKershaw was removed with two outs in the seventh, at 113 pitches, after walking his second batter of the inning, Curtis Granderson, to load the bases. Baez entered and allowed a two-run single to Wright that gave the Mets a 3-0 lead.\n“Going into that inning we kind of looked at what [Kershaw’s] pitch count was and kind of thought through Granderson if we got back to Wright the fourth time through, David pumps lefties pretty good,” Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said. “We felt that was going to be a spot if we got to that point, thought we were going to make a move there.”\nKershaw allowed three earned runs on four hits over 6 ²/₃ innings with four walks and 11 strikeouts. The lefty fell to 1-6 in the postseason for his career, including five straight losses.\nAll four hits Kershaw allowed were to lefties, including two Granderson singles and Murphy’s home run.\n“If you have all right-handers against [Kershaw] and he gets in a groove he will carve you up,” Collins said. “So you’ve got to give him something different to look at.”\nDeGrom’s only real jam came in the fourth, when Turner and A.J. Ellis each singled. Joc Pedersen was then retired before deGrom retired Kershaw on a drive to deep left-center that Yoenis Cespedes snagged in full stride, preserving the Mets’ 1-0 lead. DeGrom finished his night by retiring 11 straight batters.\nMurphy homered into the Mets’ bullpen leading off the fourth to give the Mets their first run. It was the continuation of a hot stretch to close the regular season for Murphy, who hit a career-high 14 homers in 2015.\n“[Kershaw] doesn’t make a lot of mistakes and I felt real fortunate to put a good swing on the ball he threw me,” Murphy said.\nCuddyer’s fielding gaffe in the third added eight pitches to deGrom’s count, but did not cost the Mets a run. Corey Seager hit a two-out pop fly that Cuddyer misjudged in the left-field corner and watched bounce for a double. But deGrom rebounded to strike out Gonzalez and end the inning.\nCuddyer also got a bad jump on Turner’s fly to left in the second inning. The ball skidded off his glove and went for a leadoff double before deGrom escaped the inning with three strikeouts.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under clayton kershaw ,  david wright ,  jacob degrom ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:42:11.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
