Whitecwhite@mdjonline.com The Marietta Daily Journal  15 AM | 380 views | 0 | 3 | | Tyler Green reaches the end zone on a short touchdown run in the second quarter of Friday’s region game against South Cobb. Special photo by William Lofton slideshow SMYRNA — South Cobb continued its recent string of success over Campbell, beating the Spartans 34-7 on Friday at McDaniel Stadium.The Eagles (3-5, 2-3 Region 3 ), who have won six straight in the series, snapped a two-game skid and spoiled Campbell’s homecoming in the process. The Spartans (2-6, 0-5) suffered their sixth consecutive loss.South Cobb converted three turnovers into touchdowns and scored on a safety. In addition, Tyreik Fitzpatrick’s 58-yard scoring run extended the Eagles’ lead to 20-7 with 5:06 left in the third quarter.“I thought Tyreik did an outstanding job running the football, and the offensive line gave him enough space to get open,” South Cobb coach Sherrod Rainge said. “Our defense played well, too. We count on those guys to keep us in games because we’re young on offense. Our defense put us in good position on a couple of our scoring drives, and our special teams got us the safety and good field position on kick and punt returns.”Following a scoreless first quarter, Javaris Harrell intercepted Jawan Nobles’ pass just outside the red zone. A 13-yard run from Jermaine Smith on fourth-and-12 gave the Eagles first down just outside the 10 and, one play later, Smith ran in for a 2-yard touchdown with 8:32 on the clock in the second period to give the Eagles a lead they never relinquished.A blocked punt in the end zone put South Cobb up 8-0 with 3:22 in the second. After a kickoff return to midfield, Smith connected with Tyler Green for a 36-yard reception, putting the Eagles in the red zone again. Smith’s 8-yard run to the 1 set up Green for a 1-yard score and put South Cobb ahead 14-0 with 2:42 left until halftime.Campbell got on the board on its first possession after the intermission. Starting the drive from the South Cobb 40, Nobles completed passes to four different receivers, the last of which was a 15-yard touchdown to Randy McClure. Lamin Sanyang made the point-after, trimming the Spartans deficit to 14-7 with 8:26 remaining in the third.South Cobb, however, scored 20 unanswered points the rest of the way, including Fitzpatrick’s 58-yard run and Dorquincy Jordan’s 97-yard interception return to give the Eagles a 28-7 margin with 9 seconds left in the third.The Eagles failed to convert on all of their point-after attempts, aside from Michael Lapeyrolerie’s run for a 2-point conversion following Jordan’s interception return.Emmanuel Pecina recovered Jeremy Kearse’s strip-sack and forced fumble, giving South Cobb possession at the Campbell 14 late in the fourth. Smith ran in for a 1-yard touchdown after completing a 13-yard pass to Jevon Robinson, resulting in the final margin.Smith, who was 7-of-12 passing for 85 yards, also had seven carries for 27 yards and two touchdowns. Fitzpatrick carried three times for 56 yards and a score.South Cobb played the game with heavy hearts following the death of sophomore Isaiah Dean, who was struck by a car in front of the school Tuesday morning and died from his injuries. Dean had been a member of the Eagles’ football program, playing with the freshman team last year.“It was a real emotional game for our kids,” Rainge said. “They’ve been emotional all week. Some of the kids couldn’t come to practice because they were just out of physically and mentally. I’m proud of how these kids responded. They came together and they were focused for their friend.”Campbell failed to score on five trips inside the Eagles’ 30-yard line.Nobles completed 14 of 28 passes for 108 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. He also rushed nine times for 50 yards.“Everybody’s struggling right now,” Campbell coach Ryan Brady said. “The kids are practicing hard, but we’re still trying to find our way on Friday nights.” Share This Article | similar stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:30:10.397+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
