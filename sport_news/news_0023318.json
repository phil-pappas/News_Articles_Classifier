(AP) - Chris Christie is hearing a clear message from influential Republicans in the early voting states of New Hampshire and Iowa: Keep going.\nThis, despite his single-digit poll numbers.\nWhat he's not hearing at now are enough commitments.\nWith Trump still commanding the field and several other rivals apparently rising, the New Jersey governor has been chugging along. He has held nearly 30 town hall meetings in New Hampshire, for example.\nDonna Sytek is a former speaker of the New Hampshire House whose support Christie is courting heavily. She says Christie may be \"the tortoise in this race.\" She likes him but isn't settling on a choice yet.\nMany top Republicans in early states are urging him to stick with it, but few are willing right now to give him endorsements.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
