Not with defending Conference USA champion Marshall coming to FAU Stadium on Saturday. There is no break from the hangover of the early-season struggles.\n\"This is a huge game for our players, a huge game for our coaches,\" FAU coach Charlie Partridge said. \"The year before I got here, it was a close game. This is something that the players marked coming into the season. It's a game that they really looked forward to. I don't think motivation will be a problem.\"\nAs if the Owls needed more motivation, Marshall beat Northern Illinois in last year's Boca Bowl at their home stadium. This is indeed a game they have been focused on for quite some time. Marshall won last year's game 35-16 and 24-23 the previous season.\n\"Certainly they're going to focus this week,\" Partridge said. \"To their credit, they've worked hard every Monday. Certainly, this is a game that they've had marked.\"\nThe 1-4 Owls are desperately trying to stay positive despite their current state. A loss Saturday would likely eliminate them from bowl contention, especially with remaining games against Florida, Western Kentucky and Florida International.\n\"Players were around [Monday] morning,\" Partridge said. \"They put in a ton of overtime, putting in their study hall. Really good indicators there.\"\nThey realize the situation could easily be different if not for a few unfortunate mistakes. Against Rice, they were nearly in contention of attempting the winning field goal before Johnson was sacked on fourth down at midfield.\n\"We get one more stop, one more first down and you're asking me a completely different question,\" Partridge said. \"The kids have come motivated every week. I applaud them for that.\"\nThe Owls lost in overtime to Tulsa in the season-opener, had a five-turnover defeat against Buffalo and momentum swayed after lightning delays in losses against Miami and Rice.\n\"All of them hurt but these hurt a little bit more just because we were so close,\" quarterback Jaquez Johnson said. \"It's something we've got to work on as a team.\nAdded receiver Kamrin Solomon: \"A loss is a loss. I can't put a cap on how it feels compared to losing by one to 24 points. It feels the same to me.\"\nPartridge said he and the staff haven't needed to do much to keep the team in good spirits. Monday's film session was arguably the most productive of the season. After digging themselves a hole after five games, the Owls know the margin for error is minimal the remainder of the year.\n\"The sun comes up and you come back to work,\" Partridge said. \"It's really that simple. You evaluate the film and analyze what you could have done better and what you did well.\"\nsrichardson@tribpub.com\n Florida Atlantic Owls Marshall Thundering Herd Rice Owls Conference USA Tulsa Golden Hurricane", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d6256/turbine/fl-fau-owls-main-1014-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-13T20:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:31:36.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
