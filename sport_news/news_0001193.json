(Matt Marton / AP) Time for Northwestern to put words into action. \nPat Fitzgerald values insightful words and purposeful actions from his players. \nThe conversion of words into action the last two weeks for Northwestern has been disappointing after lopsided losses to Michigan (38-0) and Iowa (40-10). While the Wolverines and Hawkeyes are emerging as elite Big Ten teams, the Wildcats (5-2, 1-2) had hoped to be in that conversation after an auspicious 5-0 start. \nNow comes a seminal moment in the season as the Wildcats travel to Nebraska (3-4, 1-2) Saturday for a chance to become bowl eligible and revive their confidence. \n\"The team's got to make a decision,\" Fitzgerald said this week. \"Is it a team that went out and won five games and made plays all over the place, or a team that the last two weeks, quite frankly, is void of making plays? \n\"It's been very disappointing, our performances the last two weeks.\" \nFitzgerald meets with the team's senior Leadership Council on a regular basis to gauge the players' perspective. Senior superback Dan Vitale is a member of the council. \n\"The most important thing right now is not to separate, to come together,\" Vitale said. \"Refocus and just recommit to everything we established during the winter, the spring, the summer workouts. Everything we put together then, just bring that back to the front and move forward. That's all we can do. Keep our attitude where it's been and bring everything that we've done at practice to the football field on Saturdays.\" \nMeanwhile, waiting in the wings to hand NU a possible third straight loss is a Nebraska team that is coming off a resounding 48-25 victory at Minnesota in which quarterback Tommy Armstrong Jr. threw three touchdown passes and Terrell Newby had a 69-yard TD run. \nNebraska's four losses have come by a total of 11 points. \nOffensively, it was evident in the blowout losses to Michigan and Iowa that sophomore running back Justin Jackson became a nonfactor after pacing the Northwestern offense in the five wins. \nJackson had just 10 carries against Iowa and 12 at Michigan after averaging 27.6 in the first five games. \n\"It's really hard when you've got to get in the two-minute mode when you're down three scores,\" Fitzgerald said. \"That skews the last two games. \n\"But we've got to get our run game going. When we've been consistent running the ball, we've been pretty successful as an offense. So we've got to get him back going, there's no doubt about that.\" \nNebraska's injury-depleted defense could provide Northwestern with an opportunity to get back on track and help redshirt freshman quarterback Clayton Thorson with a more balanced attack. \nThe Wildcats have been talking a pretty good game this week, now they hope to put together a good game on the field.
