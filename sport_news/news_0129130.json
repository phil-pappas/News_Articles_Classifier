Next week they are at home against Oakland.\nGreen Bay stays unbeaten at 6-0.\nThe defeat overshadows a huge day by Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers, who broke team records for completions (43) and yards (503). Still, on the final drive, after bringing his team 77 yards with a chance to send the game into overtime, Rivers couldn't get the ball into the end zone on four straight plays. On first-and-goal from the 3, Danny Woodhead took a handoff on a draw and gained a yard. On second down, Rivers didn't see an open Woodhead in the end zone and instead threw an incompletion intended for Antonio Gates. On third down, the Chargers ran another draw to Woodhead and lost a yard. And on fourth down a pass intended for Woodhead was batted away.\nRivers finished 43 for 65 for 503 yards. He is the first quarterback in NFL history to throw for over 500 yards with 0 interceptions and still lose the game. Keenan Allen has 14 catches for 157 yards. Melvin Gordon has 7 carries for 29 yards.\nRivers' counterpart, Aaron Rodgers, threw for 255 yards and a pair of touchdowns, a 5-yarder to James Stark and an 8-yarder to James Jones. Stark also had a 65-yard touchdown run for Green Bay.\nThe Chargers got a 19-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to Ladarius Green in the third quarter and a 1-yard pass from Rivers to Dontrelle Inman on the last play of the first half.\nFor the Packers, Rodgers finished 16 for 29 for 255 yards. Jeff Janis had two receptions for 79 yards. And Starks had 10 carries for 112 yards.\n(c)2015 The San Diego Union-Tribune\nVisit The San Diego Union-Tribune at www.sandiegouniontribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739839&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739839", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739839&h=Chargers+waste+big+day+by+Rivers+in+loss+to+Packers"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:44:12.870+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
