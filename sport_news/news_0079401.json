Wehrly said in a statement. \nOdom was stabilized and taken to Desert View Hospital in nearby Pahrump, the statement said. Officials then tried to have him airlifted to Las Vegas, but he was too tall for the helicopter that was available and he was driven by ambulance to Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center. \nThere was no further word on Odom’s condition. \nThe emergency call came from Richard Hunter, media director for Dennis Hof, who owns the Love Ranch and other brothels in Nevada, the sheriff’s statement said. Hof did not immediately reply to a request for comment. \nHis hospitalization was first reported by TMZ. The 35-year-old last played in the NBA in 2013 and saw reality TV fame through his four-year marriage to Khloe Kardashian. \nJames takes night off as Cavaliers lose again \nCLEVELAND \nLeBron James and Cleveland’s other four projected starters sat out as the Cavaliers dropped to 0-4 in the exhibition season with a 110-101 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks on Tuesday night. \nGreg Monroe and rookie Rashad Vaughn scored 19 apiece for the Bucks, who trailed by three going into the fourth quarter. Monroe had 13 rebounds and John Henson added 16 points and 10 boards for Milwaukee, which is expected to build off a surprising run to the playoffs last season. \nJames was given the night off by coach David Blatt as the Cavs played their second game in two nights. Center Timofey Mozgov also got a break and the defending Eastern Conference champions remain without Kyrie Irving (knee), Kevin Love (shoulder) and J.R. Smith (hamstring). \nPolice: Former Texas A&M player kills jogger \nDALLAS \nA former star football recruit whose receiving skills once brought him prominence at Texas A&M randomly attacked a jogger, using a “large-bladed knife” to repeatedly strike the man and lodging the weapon in his head, according to police documents. \nInvestigators say Thomas L. Johnson, 21, had recently lost his housing and was angry with his lot in life when he struck the runner Monday on a popular trail in Dallas. A bicyclist told police he saw the attacker repeatedly striking the jogger in the head, an arrest warrant affidavit revealed Tuesday. \nThe affidavit says Johnson then approached a nearby man, asked to use his cellphone and called 911 to say the victim “was laying down with a sword in his head and not moving.” \nJohnson stayed at the scene and spoke with a responding officer, twice saying, “I just committed capital murder,” according to the affidavit. It said when the officer asked him to explain, Johnson said only, “It’s like when you don’t wake up.” \nThe male jogger, whom police identified Tuesday evening as 53-year-old David Stevens, died at a hospital. Johnson was being held Tuesday at the Dallas County jail, charged with murder and two counts of probation violation. \nChiefs place injured RB Charles on IR \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. \nThe Chiefs placed Jamaal Charles on injured reserve Tuesday after the star running back tore the ACL in his right knee while making a cut against the Chicago Bears. Charles had an MRI on Monday that confirmed the extent of the injury. \nThe Chiefs filled his roster spot by promoting running back Spencer Ware from the practice squad. Ware is a former sixth-round pick out of LSU who spent the offseason with Kansas City. \nThe Chiefs also released linebacker Tyrell Adams, cornerback Jeremy Harris and offensive lineman Daniel Munyer from the practice squad Tuesday. \nAssociated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T14:03:05.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
