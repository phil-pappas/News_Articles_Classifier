(Photo: Register file photo) Buy Photo \nIOWA CITY, Ia. — Nate Meier stood out at Camp Randall Stadium last Saturday. \n“He was certainly the small guy out there, and that was the land of giants,” Iowa football coach Kirk Ferentz said. “It was a tale of two cities.” \nTwo cities, one goal: win a physical, smash-mouth Big Ten football game. Meier’s team did just that. Iowa beat Wisconsin 10-6. Heart shot an arrow through size. \n“The good news is he’s got a big heart,” Ferentz said. How Hawkeyes are dealing with newfound prosperity \nMeier made two huge fourth-quarter plays that helped keep the reborn Hawkeyes undefeated. The first came with Iowa clinging to a 10-6 lead and Wisconsin a yard away from the lead. Meier smashed into Wisconsin left guard Michael Deiter, which started a chain reaction. Deiter stepped on the foot of quarterback Joel Stave, who missed the exchange with running back Dare Ogunbowale. Iowa’s Faith Ekakitie recovered the fumble. \nDeiter stands 6-foot-6, and weighs 316 pounds. Meier is 6-2, 252. \n“I just came off the ball as low as I could and I shot the gap,” Meier explained. Iowa takeaways: What's new is old for Kirk Ferentz \nAnd then, with Wisconsin facing a fourth-and-2 from the Iowa 16 in the final minute, Meier’s pressure on Stave helped force an incompletion. Game over. A 5-0 record, and a national ranking for the first time in 2010. \n“Like our coaches always tell us, bend, don’t break,” said Meier, an eight-player football star at Fremont-Mills who once ran for a state-record 10 touchdowns in one game and rushed for 528 yards in another. \nMeier is proof, once again, at what an inexact science recruiting is. He was a two-star recruit. His other offers were from Northern Iowa and South Dakota. \n“He looked like John Riggins out there playing eight-man football, just running everyone over,” Ferentz said. “We weren’t sure where he would play. But we thought he was a football player.” Kirk Ferentz open to changing strict Twitter policy \nWhen Meier got to campus his assigned roommate at the Hillcrest dorm was another farm kid and eight-player product out of Nebraska. His name was Drew Ott. They are now the starting ends of this resilient defense, the only one in the nation that hasn’t allowed a rushing touchdown this season. \n“Like our coaches always harp on, we have to stop the run,” Meier said. \nOtt is not wild about Meier’s penchant for wearing neon-hued clothing, but the two have become rock-solid friends. Two kids who learned the value of hard work on the farm and carried it over to the football field. \n“He’s a little shorter and smaller,” Ott said. “But he’s pretty strong and explosive.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T06:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T03:06:48.926+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
