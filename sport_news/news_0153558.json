It allows his stars to rest, and gives his bench meaningful experience against an opposing team's starting lineup. \nFor the second year in a row , Popovich will circle that strategy on himself and stay in San Antonio for an upcoming preseason game against the Sacramento Kings. true Spurs coach Gregg Popovich also didn't make trip to Sac for preseason opener as they will be coached by assistant Ettore Messina,source says â€” Marc J. Spears (@SpearsNBAYahoo) October 8, 2015 \nThis is unusual by NBA standards, if not those of the Spurs , but Messina could be a candidate as San Antonio's full-time head coach once Popovich decides to retire. So from that perspective, it makes sense to give the Italian some useful experience. \nAlso, this is the preseason, so, you know, whatever. Popovich can do what he wants.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T23:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:54:54.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
