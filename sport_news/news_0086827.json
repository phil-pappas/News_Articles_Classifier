With this in mind the team will hope that it manages to sneak in the opponents' D early and get the scorecard ticking.\nWith S K Uthappa, Akashdeep Singh, S V Sunil leading the charge it will not be a surprise if they yet again pull off a victory.\nSpeaking about the game, chief coach and high performance director Roelant Oltmans said, \"The last two matches were good learning for us and in a way has got us familiar to the conditions here.\n\"What is working in our favour is the field goals and which in a way showcases the team's ability to break the defence chain to enter the opponents' D and even our coordination during those few seconds.\nThis is a good sign and I hope we continue this. Also from here we will aim to get more penalty corners and convert them.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:14:53.603+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
