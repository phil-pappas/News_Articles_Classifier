Nazareth 25-21, 25-20, 25-23 – Rapid Recap \nLiberty High School’s girls volleyball team rolled into the Eastern Pennsylvania Conference final with an impressive sweep of Nazareth (25-21, 25-20, 25-23) on Thursday at Whitehall High School. \nTurning point : After taking the first set, the Hurricanes trailed 19-17 in the second before going on an 8-1 run to put the game firmly in their grasp. The sequence included a kill and an ace from Sydney Wilson , and two kills and a block from Lina Perugini. \nTop performer : Liberty (19-1) got a remarkably balanced performance from a handful of girls, but Wilson kept popping up during key moments for her team. She finished with eight kills, two blocks, 14 digs and a pair of aces. \nWhat it means : The Hurricanes advance to the EPC championship game against the Parkland/Central Catholic winner 1 p.m. Saturday back at Whitehall.
