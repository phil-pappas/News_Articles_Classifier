(Photo: Nati Harnik/Associated Press) \nAUBURN – Mississippi State head baseball coach John Cohen has given his endorsement of Butch Thompson to Auburn. \nIn a post-game media conference following MSU’s fall season, Cohen addressed the news that Thompson, his top assistant coach since 2009, is a top candidate for the vacant head coaching position at Auburn. \n“Nobody deserves to have that type of opportunity more than a Butch Thompson,\" Cohen said to the Jackson Clarion-Ledger Wednesday. \"We’re cheering for him. We don’t want to lose him. I’ve told many people at Auburn, you’d be crazy not to hire this guy. But I’m going to be the happiest guy in the world if you don’t.\" \nThe Montgomery Advertiser confirmed last week Auburn did bring Thompson on campus on Oct. 12 to interview for its open head baseball coach position . Former Clemson head coach Jack Leggett also interviewed with Auburn officials that week as well. Auburn has conducted interviews this week and local reports have suggested those candidates are Florida State assistant coach Mike Martin Jr . and Virginia pitching coach Karl Kuhn . \nMississippi State pitching coach Butch Thompson has recruited and developed 22 Division I All-America selections and 29 all-conference honorees in his coaching career. (Photo: Mississippi State athletics) \nSources close to the situation confirmed to the Montgomery Advertiser Thompson has spoken to Auburn athletics director Jay Jacobs , the Auburn baseball search committee and various head coaches including football coach Gus Malzahn , men’s basketball coach Bruce Pearl and Auburn softball coach Clint Myers . \nThompson, 44, was the pitching coach at Auburn for three seasons (2006-08) under head coach Tom Slater and has spent the last 14 seasons as an assistant in the Southeastern Conference. Each of Auburn’s three recruiting classes with Thompson on staff were ranked among the top 20 in the nation, including a No. 5 national ranking in 2007. \nSources have also told the Montgomery Advertiser that Thompson would consider reaching out to former Auburn All-America selection, 7-year MLB veteran and current SEC Network baseball analyst Gabe Gross to join his staff as a full-time hitting coach. \nJacobs announced in a university release on Sept. 27 Golloway was being fired as Auburn’s head baseball coach with cause but did not reveal the nature of the violations in the statement. Jacobs told reporters on Oct. 1 that he wanted to get the program through fall drills, which are going on this week, before commenting on the head baseball coach search. \nJacobs announced that assistant coach Greg Norton , who played in Major League Baseball from 1996-2009, will be responsible for Auburn’s baseball operations until a new coach is hired. \nIn a phone interview with the Montgomery Advertiser , Golloway said he didn’t understand why he was dismissed from his position after two seasons with the Tigers program. Multiple sources have also confirmed to the Montgomery Advertiser that Auburn placed associate head coach/pitching coach Tom Holliday on paid administrative leave at the same time they dismissed Golloway. \nIn a media statement, Golloway’s attorney called the decision by Auburn “outrageous” and threatened possible litigation if a settlement on severance compensation couldn’t soon be reached between the two parties.
