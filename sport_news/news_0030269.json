ISU assistant T.J. Otzelberger led the recruitment against more than a dozen Division I offers, including Oklahoma State, Kansas State, Wichita State, Missouri, Ole Miss, Houston, South Carolina and Texas Tech. \n\"I really didn't care about staying close to home or not, but when I decided to go to Iowa State I knew it would be a good fit for me and close enough for my family to watch me play,\" Long said. \n\"My dad (Terry Long) told me not to pick a school because of its status, pick a school because you love a place and want to live there.\" \nAs a junior, Long led Mustang High School to an undefeated state championship season with his father serving as head coach. He averaged 15 points, eight rebounds and six assists on a balanced team that rolled through Class 6A, Oklahoma's largest classification. — wizard kelly (@jsnipe43) October 9, 2015 \nFootball was another college option for the Athletes First AAU product, but Long has decided to put his explosive 210-pound frame to use on Big 12 basketball courts. \n\"I love Iowa State's style of play,\" he said. \n\"They shoot a lot of threes, they play aggressive defense, they get out and run and that's the style I want to play for.\" \nRivals.com had Long ranked in its top 150 players nationally last year, and Scout.com currently lists him as the top-ranked prep player in Oklahoma. Iowa State lands Jakolby Long out of Oklahoma. Son of a coach, well built and physical scorer. — Eric Bossi (@ebosshoops) October 9, 2015 \n\"Long ran the point, played off the wing and also spent some time in the paint,\" Rivals analyst Eric Bossi wrote after a Mustang win in Texas last season. \n\"Wherever he was, Long showed strength and toughness. A high-energy player with a great feel for the game, he got his team off to a quick start with the three-ball before making plays as they were needed down the stretch.\" \nLong is the fourth commitment to Prohm's 2016 class, following guard Donovan Jackson (Iowa Western Community College), forward Solomon Young (Sacramento, Calif.), and wing Emmanuel Malou (Yuba Community College). \nSkipping over nearby Oklahoma and Oklahoma State could raise a few eyebrows, but Long expects to see his Oklahoma City metro rivals when Big 12 play comes around. \n\"It's a different pick from most people that live in my state, but I think I'll be fine. Iowa State's a great place,\" Long said. 482 CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1Lm9kH9 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T21:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T05:31:13.825+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
