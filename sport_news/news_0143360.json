Chengelis) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE College Park, Md. — With wind gusts expected to hit 30-plus miles per hour, the Michigan-Maryland game on Saturday, moved eight hours earlier in the day because of weather-related safety concerns, likely will boil down to which team has the better running game.\n\nIt has been a week of handwringing among Big Ten officials since tropical storm Joaquin became a hurricane threatening to hit the Mid-Atlantic States and northward up the East Coast. Joaquin has become less of an issue, but the accompanying rain and wind are expected to factor into the Wolverines’ game at Byrd Stadium.\n\nBut this also is about the fans, and that’s why the Big Ten moved the game from a heavily promoted prime-time kickoff at 8 p.m. to noon.\n\nStill, the forecast is largely dismal. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA.gov), the chance of rain is 90 percent through 7 p.m. and wind gusts could reach 31 mph. Rain fell all day on Friday, and students walking on the Maryland campus Friday afternoon did battle with their umbrellas that turned inside out because of the wind.\n\nOne to two inches of rain were expected by evening, however, the State of Emergency in Maryland, issued earlier in the week when it was unclear what direction Joaquin would take, was lifted on Friday.\n\nFor fans who have seats in the upper section of Byrd Stadium, it could be challenging on Saturday. Those seats are unprotected and according to a story in the Baltimore Sun, the stadium is situated on North Campus and the high-rise dorms in that area have created wind tunnels that affect the venue and field. \n\nChanging the game time and the weather clearly have affected the ticket prices on the secondary market. What was once a tough ticket, particularly since there are so many Michigan alums in the Washington, D.C. area, is now cheap. A seat in that uncovered section was going for $34 on StubHub on Friday afternoon.\n\nRain always has been called the great equalizer in football games. Michigan, ranked No. 22 and 3-1, has run the ball well in the last three games, including back-to-back games of 254 yards rushing. It is unclear whether lead back De’Veon Smith, who left the BYU game late in the third quarter last Saturday with a right ankle/foot injury, will be available. \n\nMaryland is ranked seventh in the Big Ten in rushing offense, averaging 196 yards a game.\n\nThe wind undoubtedly will factor into the kicking game, sometimes with an assist. As the Sun pointed out, Maryland kicker Brad Craddock made a 57-yard wind-assisted field goal against Ohio State last season.\n“If it’s just kind of a steady rain, I think you can combat that,” Maryland coach Randy Edsall told the paper. “The thing that makes it tough is if you have the rain and it looks like they’re calling for anything from 15 to 25 mph winds, so I think you get the wind, you get the rain and you get the cold, that could make it a little bit difficult to throw the football.”\n\nMichigan coach Jim Harbaugh, making his weekly radio appearance Thursday on 97.1, said rainy games force a focus on hanging onto the football. He is looking forward to the weather challenge that will add to playing on the road.\n\n“It’s really one of the best, exciting things that I’ve found for players in all of sports,” Harbaugh said. “To go on the road you have to defeat another team, their crowd is a factor, you have to defeat that, and then the trifecta is defeating the elements. If you can do all three of those things, at least in my opinion, in my experience, there’s nothing that will make you more like a man than that. We’ve got that opportunity.”\n\nangelique.chengelis@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/chengelis", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:07:13.337+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
