He said he made the least amount of money, $100, working for the Amish, above. He's the ultimate jack of all trades.\nDaniel Seddiqui set out on a mission in September to work 50 jobs in 50 weeks in all 50 states.\nIt's week 42, and the determined young man is spending five days as an Internet marketer in New York City .\n\"I try to find jobs that relate to the culture of the state,\" Seddiqui told the Daily News Wednesday from his office at Blueliner NY, a Web marketing agency on W. 35th St.\n\"I wanted to be a stockbroker on Wall Street , but the firms I talked to couldn't justify hiring me for a week with all the recent layoffs.\"\nSeddiqui's \"Living the Map\" project started 42 weeks ago when the 27-year-old college graduate realized he had no clue what to do with his life. He decided to try a little bit of everything with the hope that he'd find his true calling.\nSince then, the University of Southern California graduate and economics major has worked for a week at a time as a crab chef in Maryland , coal miner in West Virginia , auto mechanic in Michigan , petroleum engineer in Texas , maple syrup processor in Vermont , golf caddie in South Carolina , border patrol agent in Arizona and many more.\nSeddiqui hated his job as a performer at Universal Studios in Orlando , where they made him walk on stilts dressed like the king of Egypt .\n\"I was 12 feet up and it was hot,\" he said. \"I fell behind a popcorn stand - it was a long and slow fall.\"\n\"The most brutal job was making cheese in Wisconsin ,\" he said. \"It smells like dirty socks when you're trying to separate the curds from the whey.\"\nHe enjoyed coaching high school football in Birmingham, Ala. , where he \"loved the city and the food,\" and had fun as a TV weatherman in Cleveland .\nSimmons/News Daniel Seddiqui (below in New York) is determined to work 50 jobs in 50 states in 50 weeks. He said he made the least amount of money, $100, working for the Amish, above. Seddiqui never imagined he would land a job marrying people in Las Vegas , or driving the limo after the reception.\nHe made the most money - $2,000 for the week - as a medical equipment manufacturer in Minnesota , and the least making wood furniture with the Amish in Pennsylvania . That paid just $100.\nHe's also had a \"side project\" over the weeks that has fulfilled him in ways work cannot.\n\"I'm dating as many women as I can along the way,\" he said.\nWhen asked how he feels about taking so many jobs from employers who like his gimmick while so many Americans can't find work to support themselves, Seddiqui said he's just better at finding work than the average guy.\n\"You have to be able to go out of your comfort zone and be sure of yourself and know that you're going to make things work out,\" he said.\nHis advice to downtrodden American workers is to be better at networking, saying it's not what you know, it's who you know that will land you a job.\nThe irony is, Seddiqui has decided he's more interested in pulling elaborate stunts than anything else, and it's economically viable.\nHe's made about $60,000 - most of which he has saved because he always stays with friends or colleagues, and he drives from state to state.\nHe'll also cash in next year when the book he's writing about the adventure is published. And he's in talks to do a reality show on a similar stunt - 50 jobs in 50 weeks in 50 European cities.\nRelated News California man's mission? 50 jobs in 50 weeks in 50 states", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T16:23:59.117+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
