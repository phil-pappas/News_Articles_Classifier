Reynolds and was a fixture here at Western Carolina,” Speir said of Mutt DeGraffenreid, who was 60 when he died following a long illness. \n“We found out (he died) before the game last year so we had little Al, who is helping us out this year, make the pre-game speech. He talked about how proud his dad would have been. \n\"So this win is for coach Mutt. He was out there helping us today, him and the good Lord.” \nMutt DeGraffenreid was an Asheville native and graduated from Reynolds in 1972. He went on to play football at Western Carolina and later coached in the program as an assistant for nearly 20 years. \nDeGraffenreid also holds the distinction of being the first African-American high school football coach in Western North Carolina, coaching at Cherokee from 1999 to 2004. He was later an athletic director at North Buncombe and Smoky Mountain. \nHis daughter, Cetera, is the area's all-time leading scorer in girls basketball (3,081 points) and led the Smoky Mountain girls to a NCHSAA 2-A championship in 2007. She later played for North Carolina. \nMutt DeGraffenreid is a member of the WCU hall of fame, \n“We love the DeGraffenreid family,” said Speir, whose team (5-2, 3-1 Southern Conference) will play at Chattanooga on Saturday. \n“I told little Al if he gives those type of speeches he’s going to give the rest of them. I just wanted to give a big shout out to Mutt DeGraffenreid. He was definitely with us (Saturday).\" 94 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1S4stOW TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T20:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T10:25:32.579+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
