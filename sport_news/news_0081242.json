However, the betting marketplace remains steady as she goes with various betting options hovering around the usual 50/50 mark. \nLines can alter slightly from house to house but based on consensus closing lines, underdogs hold a marginal 32-30-1 edge against the spread to this point. Many subscribe to home field favourites when risking their dollars but that too finds host teams with just a slight 22-20 advantage. Another popular philosophy involves backing home underdogs but once again, a 10-10-1 mark only benefits the house if one were to do so. \nAs for Over/Unders, the same outcome applies as game totals are deadlocked at 31 overs to 31 unders and one push. This all serves as a reminder that whenever there is an imbalance on this type of data, a correction is usually forthcoming. \nPLAYERS, HOUSE, PLAYERS ... \nWhile it is still relatively early, it has been a see-saw battle for which group ends up with the money. The odd numbered weeks, 1 and 3, had the bettors lining their pockets. However, the even numbered weeks, 2 and 4, have had the bettors returning the money to their source. \nThe books were exposed this past week as a number of games were big decisions for the guys taking. As usual, the house was rooting for the underdogs with the public supporting six different favourites. Money kept coming in on Philadelphia, Denver, Green Bay, Arizona, Cincinnati and somewhat surprisingly, the Raiders. When the dust settled, only the Packers and Bengals were able to cover from that group with the other four underdogs cashing tickets for their minority backers. From that group, only Denver was able to win its game but not cover while the other three lost straight up to their supposedly weaker opponents. \nWEEK 5 LINES MOVEMENT \nBuffalo -3 at Tennessee \nFew can figure out the Bills right now but someone feels they have some intel on them. After opening at -3 this week over the less than stellar Titans, sharp bettors felt that a full field goal was too flattering and quickly drove the game down to 2½. Any time a game comes off a three, it is notable as three-point games are the most common winning margin in the NFL. Since 2002, 16% of all game are won by exactly three points. \nDenver -4½ at Oakland \nTalk about a lack of respect. Last we looked, Denver was 4-0 while Oakland just lost to the lowly Bears. \nIn this same game last season, the Broncos were a huge 12½-point choice, winning handily 41-17. Eleven months later, the game opens at Denver -5½ and the Raiders get flooded with money, driving the spread down to Broncos -4½. Folks not trusting Denver’s offence or do people believe the Raiders could be on the rise? \nNew England -7 at Dallas \nOddsmakers can’t list the Patriots high enough. After all, who really wants to oppose this rested gorilla after New England tallied 119 points in three games before its bye week. This game opened with the Pats as a full touchdown favourite but seems that wasn’t enough. With Dallas dropping consecutive games after losing QB Tony Romo and New England pounding its opposition, this one was quickly upped to the Patriots -9. \nSUPERCONTEST UPDATES \nThe Las Vegas mega-contest continued and once again, the consensus plays of the 1,727 entrants fared very well with a 4-1 mark. Briefly, contestants are required to submit their top five plays each week of the 17-week NFL season. Week 4 saw the top overall consensus pick go down with the Cardinals giving seven-point to the Rams who lost their game straight up. The Panthers -3, Giants +5, Jaguars +9 (aided by the speculation of Andrew Luck sitting out) and Bengals -4 were all winners. That now has the consensus picks through the first four weeks sitting at an impressive 15-5 overall. \nAfter a decent start to the contest with a 7-3 record, we suffered another losing week with a 2-3 mark. That has us dead even with a 10-10 mark and we’ve now sunk to the bottom half of the group, sitting in 1,038th. Last week’s leader held their spot as a team called The Right Reasons had a 4-1 weekend and are now 18-2 on the year. Three teams sit one game behind with 17 correct predictions. \nONE MAN’S GRIEF ... \nYou can bet on almost anything when it comes to the NFL. That includes a prop that asks ‘which coach will be fired first?’ Turns out, we have a winner already as Miami’s Joe Philbin was let go this week after his team laid another egg, this time British style. A handsome 15-1 return awaited those that thought Philbin would be the first to get his walking papers. Looking back, odds were presented for this dubious distinction just prior to the season commencing: \nJay Gruden, Redskins 2½-1 \nMike Pettine, Browns 5-1", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:26:34.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
