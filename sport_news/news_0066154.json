Signal photo by Dan Watson. \nA Santa Clarita Christian football team that has spent the season moving the ball at will was suddenly baffled early in Saturday night’s game. \nAnd by the time the SCCS offense picked things up, it was too late to rally. \nCapistrano Valley Christian ran the ball very effectively and pounced on every opportunity in a 37-21 win over the Cardinals in a San Joaquin League game at Canyon High School. \nIt was a letdown for the Cardinals (6-2 overall, 2-1 in league), who were ranked 10th in the CIF-Southern Section East Valley Division poll this week, marking the first top 10 ranking for the team in nearly five years in the 11-man ranks. \nThen again, SCCS head coach Garrick Moss said he believes Capistrano may be the toughest team on the schedule despite its losing record. The Eagles improved to 3-5 overall, 2-1 in league with Saturday’s win. \n“I keep telling people... they’re not like that,” Moss said of Capistrano. \nCapistrano ran for 275 total yards out of what head coach Eric Preszler deemed a ball-control offense. That effort was led by Kci Thompson, who picked up 132 yards and two touchdown runs on 17 carries. \nDaniel Herber added 80 yards and a rushing score of his own, while also scoring on a key 90-yard interception late in the game. \n“We knew we had to possess the ball on offense. We knew we had to control the clock because (SCCS is) dangerous,” Preszler said. \nIn the end, the Cardinals did end up with big yardage in the passing game, with quarterback Tristan Miller finishing 29-for-46 passing for 381 yards, three touchdowns and two interceptions. \nBut 277 of those yards and all three scores came after a rough first half for the Cardinals. \nCapistrano took advantage of two SCCS turnovers to build a 23-0 halftime lead, while the Cardinals failed to cash in even when they did put together a few long drives early. \nFollowing a field goal on Capistrano’s opening drive of the game, Thompson raced 56 yards to the end zone early in the second quarter to put his team up 9-0. Later in the quarter, Dylan Baird added a 34-yard run to the house, followed by a 14-yard score from Thompson to set the halftime score. \n“You can’t come out flat like that,” Moss said. “In the first half, we didn’t come out with energy, heart, effort, anything.” \nSCCS came out firing in the third quarter with back-to-back touchdown drives capped off by Millers’s passes to Caden Brenner and Ethan Schwesinger to cut the lead to 23-13. \nBut the Eagles’ stable of big running backs kept grinding away scoring drives. \nThe game was effectively put away when Miller’s pass was snatched away by Herber and taken all the way back for a score. That pushed Capistrano’s lead to 37-13 with 7:19 to play, and it ended what looked like another promising drive for the Cardinals. \nBrenner was the game’s leading receiver with 11 catches for 190 yards. \nSCCS is still in prime position to make the playoffs for the first time since 2013, and it could still win a league title if it can win its final two games.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T08:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:01:23.780+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
