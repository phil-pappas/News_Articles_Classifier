On the second play from scrimmage, Fitzpatrick fumbled on a sack by Chandler Jones that Patriots linebacker Dont’a Hightower recovered at the Jets’ 19.\nThe defense held the Patriots to a field goal, but it felt like it was going to be a long day for Fitzpatrick.\n“Just poor ball security, you know,” Fitzpatrick said. “That was a play where they doubled Brandon [Hightower] and I was kind of looking his way, just something that can’t happen.\nFitzpatrick bounced back, though, and played fairly well the rest of the day. He completed 22 of 39 passes for 295 yards and two touchdowns. He also ran for 29 yards on five carries.\n“He did a good job,” coach Todd Bowles said. “We fought. We win as a team, [and] we lose as a team and it counted for everybody, coaches included. We’ve just got to regroup and go on.”\nFitzpatrick was sacked twice, equaling his total for the season before the game.\nThe Jets had no takeaways for the first time this season. They nearly had one in the third quarter when Sheldon Richardson sacked Tom Brady, forcing the ball loose. But the ball bounced off a lineman’s foot and right back into Brady’s hands.\n“It was just the luck of the bounce,” defensive lineman Leger Douzable said. “It went right back into [Brady’s] hands.”\nCB Darrelle Revis was not too sentimental about his return to Gillette Stadium.\n“It’s just a Week 7 game,” Revis said.\nRevis spent the 2014 season with the Patriots before signing with the Jets as a free agent in March.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T04:03:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:54:46.891+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
