Owner and head chef Ryan Tracy appreciates the positive coverage. \n\"It's extremely rewarding and makes that hard work in this career. That's really what you want, the recognition. If you can get that, and bring that to your city or state, it's something you can be very proud of,\" Tracy said. \nStern enjoyed a tasty enchiladas at Mamma Laddas and dessert at Oh My Cupcakes! He also made stops at CH Patisserie for another sweet treat. \n\"Someone like Ron, or any travel writer who has never been here before, the whole scope of Sioux Falls is available to sell to them. To convince them, and to show them. And time and time again, they fall in love with Sioux Falls,\" Teri Schmidt said. Not only with the city but also those who live here. \n\"It seems like the people are very down to earth and very friendly, everyone has been accommodating and kind,\" Stern said.
