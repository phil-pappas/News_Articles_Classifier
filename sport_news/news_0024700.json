(AP) — Officials think they'll finally be able to sell off two New Hampshire properties formerly owned by a now-jailed pair of tax evaders who kept federal agents at bay during a months-long armed standoff, despite concerns one might still be booby-trapped.\nAn auction last year for Ed and Elaine Brown’s properties drew no bidders, but much has changed.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below The minimum bids on both places — $125,000 for the 100-acre compound in Plainfield and $250,000 for Elaine Brown’s dentist office in Lebanon — are half what they were.
