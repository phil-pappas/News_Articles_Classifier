TOLEDO (13abc Action News) - Myth confirmed!\nImagination Station to host MythBusters: The Explosive Exhibition\nThis exhibition is headed for Imagination Station from October 17, 2015 – January 10, 2016\nDiscover the madness behind the method in MythBuster: The Explosive Exhibition! Apply the scientific method to uncover the truth behind popular myths. Can you drive a car blindfolded or hang from the edge of a cliff? Based on the real-life operations room of the MythBusters’ iconic set, this exhibition is filled with gadgets, props, video and blueprints used by the hosts to explore myths on the show.\nThe exhibition creates hands-on, interactive experiences for guests of all ages by combining popular scientific facts with innovative, family-friendly displays. Videos and notes from co-hosts Adam Savage, Jamie Hyneman, Tory Belleci, Kari Byron and Grant Imahara take scientific investigation to exciting new levels by proving or exploding myths using their highly experimental approach and extensive backgrounds in special effects. Savage and Hyneman were heavily involved throughout the development of the exhibition to ensure guests experience a true MythBusting encounter.\n\"It's exciting to see fans take on some of our favorite experiments from the show while drawing their own conclusions and data,\" said Savage. \"Although they are tackling the same myths and questions, each guest can have a unique experience within the exhibit.\"\n\"We hope people have fun at the exhibit and get a sense of what it is like doing the show,\" added Hyneman.\n“Many of our team members are MythBuster fans and have been looking forward to this exhibition for years,” said Lori Hauser, Chief Executive Officer for Imagination Station. “We are excited to bring an authentic MythBusting experience to Toledo. Whether you are a fan of the show or not, the hands-on method of busting myths will get you excited about the scientific method.”\nExhibits cover topics such as flight, friction, gravity, speed and combustion. The exhibition showcases:\n• Blueprint Room – Based on the real-life operations room of the MythBusters’ iconic set, this room acts as an introduction to MythBusting and is filled with gadgets, props, video and, of course, blueprints used by the hosts to explore myths on the show.\n• Workshop – This is the place where guests turn into investigators and use real science to test myths. Guest discover whether they get more wet running versus walking in the rain and find out if toast really does always land buttered-side down.\n• Live MythBusters Demonstration Stage – Here guests have the opportunity to view and participate in live science demonstrations that dissect myths with the help of a team of energetic MythBusting facilitators. One lucky participant will have the opportunity to see if their reflexes are quick enough to dodge a paintball.", "external_links": ["http://media.graytvinc.com/images/353*198/Paintball6.jpg", "http://up.anv.bz/latest/scripts/anvload.js", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?sz=640x480&iu=/301721715/WTVG&ciu_szs&impl=s&gdfp_req=1&ad_rule=1&vpos=preroll&env=vp&output=xml_vast2&unviewed_position_start=1&correlator=", "http://gray-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/captures/6F6/9E0/6F69E0186FC948A2BD5A7FED40BC3AAD.mp4", "http://media.graytvinc.com/images/Paintball6.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T06:15:09.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
