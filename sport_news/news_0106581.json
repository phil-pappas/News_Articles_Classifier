Staff photo by Kelly J. Huff slideshow Even though it ultimately prevailed, there was pressure on Walton’s side of the court when it hosted Johns Creek in the second round of the Class state playoffs.In 2014, the Lady Raiders were upset in the same round by eventual champion North Cobb, and Walton’s returning players didn’t want to bow out for the second straight year. Add to that the four freshman standouts who knew they were facing lofty expectations in their first taste of the playoffs. Walton found itself trailing at points of its match with Johns Creek, but it still rose to the occasion and took care of business in three sets. Awarded the top seed for the quarterfinals, the Lady Raiders (34-4) are now focused on today’s opponent, Peachtree Ridge (28-16).Walton freshman Gabby Gonzales didn’t appear to be shaken by Johns Creek, which was only a No. 3 seed but overachieved and ended North Cobb’s title defense. She posted 23 kills.Walton’s veterans also made a presence, with Celeste Fitzgerald totaling 33 digs, Dalaney Hans 30 assists and Tai Bierria 10 kills and nine digs.But it’s the poise of the freshmen — led by Gonzales, Riley Spurlin, Meghan Froemming and Reilly MacNeil — that has impressed coach Suzanne Fitzgerald during the postseason.“They are so talented, yet they are so young,” Fitzgerald said. “When they are nervous, they could turn toward friendship and push past that. They get along so well on the off the court.”After coming back from two sets down to beat Lassiter, third-seeded Harrison (31-9) will host Norcross (34-14).Back-row defense has made up for a lack of size, with Camryn Bihary and Riley Fischer thwarting many kill attempts. But against Norcross, serving is going to play a major role for Harrison. “I think the girls have been focused. They have put in the hard work, and they feel good about the weekend,” assistant coach Rob Cowart said. “We focused on defense and serving after the second set and making sure we were targeting our serves. Against Norcross, serving is going to be a big part of our game.”In the Class state quarterfinals following a pair of straight-set wins over Kell and McIntosh, fifth-seeded Allatoona (34-17) will travel to Dunwoody (36-14). This is the Lady Buccaneers’ first trip to the round of eight since 2011, and a win would put them in the semifinals for the first time. Allatoona coach Joe Soley said his team will rely heavily on defense to contain Dunwoody’s outside hitting and keep a close watch on the Lady Wildcats’ top hitter, Bridget Boyle. Soley also said the Lady Buccaneers will also have to continue serving well and remain strong in the middle. Jedaiah Daniels and Jaslynn Gwyn combined for 15 blocks in Allatoona’s win against McIntosh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:31:44.700+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
