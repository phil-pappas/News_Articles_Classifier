Blackmon, Mathews and Jeurgens each have over 300 yards receiving. Blackmon recorded his second game with over 100 yards receiving against East Carolina last Saturday. Devon Blackmon runs the ball in the homecoming game against ECU. He had a career-high 142 receiving yards. (Ari Davis) \nAside from BYU’s game against Michigan, the offense has shown that it can put up big numbers on the scoreboard. The Cougars scored a season-high 45 points in their win over the Pirates. BYU’s offense will need to continue playing at that level to keep up with Cincinnati’s high-tempo offense this upcoming Friday. \n“Speaking about Cincinnati, they are very skilled, very similar opponent to (East Carolina),” head coach Bronco Mendenhall said. “Maybe a little bit more explosive, similar caliber and similar type of athletes.” \nThe Cougars will continue to take all the magic Mangum can supply them, and expect that Mangum’s hamstring injury won’t prevent him from playing against Cincinnati. Backup quarterback Beau Hoge will fill in if Mangum does not play. \nMangum’s performance Saturday night provides insight into his potential and future as BYU’s quarterback. His passing was on point, completing 73 percent of his passes for 332 yards and three touchdowns. He tweaked his hamstring in the fourth quarter but was resilient enough to come back in on the Cougar’s last drive to lead them down the field for another memorable last-minute win. \n“It’s just unbelievable,” Mendenhall said. “The decisions he is making for a freshman are just exceptional. The poise that he is displaying, it just really impresses me.” Tanner Mangum throws the ball in the homecoming game against ECU. Mangum finished the game with 332 passing yards. (Ari Davis) \nNine different receivers record a catch against East Carolina, the second time that has happened this season. \n“It’s great that Tanner can pass the ball so well,” running back Algernon Brown said. “It’s fun to see him be able to find a guy here and find a guy there; it opens up the run game for us.” \nBrown opened up the Cougar running game with 134 rushing yards, three touchdowns on the ground and one touchdown reception. \n“Our offensive line and running game on the last drive was great,” Mangum said in a press release. “It is a great feeling when you can step on the field and trust your guys and know that they’ll do everything they can to help you.” \nBYU expects another offensive battle when they take on Cincinnati on Friday, Oct. 16 at LaVell Edwards Stadium. Kickoff is set for 6:00 MDT. Author's latest posts Joshua Landon Josh Landon is a junior at BYU majoring in News Media. He is a sports writer covering football and golf.
