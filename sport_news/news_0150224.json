The 49ers running back responded to the query by repositioning himself so he could look the questioner in the eye. He had to make something clear. \n\"I'm all for it if they call my number,\" Hyde said. \"I've been in that position before, where they call my number and I had to carry the team on my back. If there comes a time that needs to be done, I'll be ready.\" \nThat moment might be here. Hyde might be the best hope of redirecting the 49ers season, which is spiraling out of control. \nAnd up Interstate 880, the Raiders too might be relying heavily on their back. Latavius Murray has more around him, but so far Oakland has shown it's a more formidable team when Murray is getting touches. Oakland Raiders' Latavius Murray (28) runs against Baltimore Ravens' C.J. Mosley (57) in the second quarter at the O.co Coliseum in Oakland, Calif., on Sunday, Sept. 20, 2015. (Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) ( Nhat V. Meyer ) \nThe 49ers and Raiders are franchises known more for legendary quarterbacks and Hall of Fame receivers. But this year, they are heading down the featured back route, and their success is largely tied to it working. \nFortunately for both franchises, they've landed special talents. In an age where running backs are supposed to come a dime a dozen, the Raiders and 49ers have found a couple gems. \nHyde is third in the NFL in rushing yards (262) entering Week 4. Murray (248) ranks fourth. Both are averaging just shy of 5 yards per carry. \nHyde and Murray, after waiting their turn, came into this season with pretty high expectations. And both easily pass the eye test just watching them so far. Advertisement \nIt's been a long time since both squads had productive backs anchoring their offenses. It's rare for both to have such promise in the backfield. \nPerhaps you'd have to go all the way back to Marcus Allen and Roger Craig in the 1980s. You could, however, make a case for Garrison Hearst and Charlie Garner in the early 2000s. \nWhat makes Hyde and Murray so special?

(Nhat V. Meyer/Bay Area News Group) ( Nhat V. Meyer ) \nBoth are big backs -- Hyde 6-foot, 230 pounds, and Murray 6-2, 230 -- who can run inside the tackles and finish strong. Hyde and Murray can either run around defenders or run through them. Both are also deceptively quick with good footwork, making them dangerous on the outside and in space. \n\"His vision is unbelievable,\" Raiders quarterback Derek Carr said of Murray, a sixth-round pick in 2013. \"The holes that he can see and the cuts that he makes ... For a bigger guy, they usually run with a high pad level. The way he can drop his hips and make a cut, let alone see that hole, blows my mind. ... He knows where to run. He's not out there just running. That's where he sets himself apart.\" \nHyde, a second-round pick in 2014, flashed his combination of power and explosiveness with 168 yards and two touchdowns in the opener. He followed with 94 yards on 28 carries the next two games, facing defenses intent on stopping him. \nBut with the way the 49ers offense has looked, a steady, relentless diet of Hyde might be the solution. \nMurray, on the other hand, started slowly and exploded. His workload was limited over the first two weeks as the Raiders leaned on their passing game. But in their first road game, they stuck with Murray. \nAfter Murray ran for 139 yards and a touchdown at Cleveland, the conclusion is the same as it is for Hyde: Get him the ball. An effective Murray opens up the world for Carr and gives the Raiders' creaky defense more time off the field. \nBut there is a noteworthy concern regarding each back. Murray was knocked out of his breakout game last year with a concussion. Hyde was knocked out of the Week 2 loss at Pittsburgh with a head injury and got up slowly several times against the Arizona's hard-hitting defense. \nCan they hold up under the load they'll be asked to carry this season? If they can, the Bay Area is in for a treat. Read Marcus Thompson II's blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/thompson . Contact him at mthomps2@bayareanewsgroup.com .
