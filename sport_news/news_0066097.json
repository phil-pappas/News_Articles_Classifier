Yoenis Cespedes wore a balaclava. As baseball's postseason keeps getting longer, the Boys of Summer are starting to resemble skiers on a Steamboat Springs lift line.\"This weather is not for me,\" Cubs infielder Javier Baez said. \"I'm from Puerto Rico, and you know how the weather is in the island — it's hot all year long.\"Players wish there was only 6 degrees of separation between the dog days of summer and the coolest venues in baseball they all try to reach — the postseason. It was 48 degrees when the NL Championship Series opener began at New York's Citi Field last weekend and 45 for the start of Game 2. The teams did get a break with a 72 degree night at Chicago's Wrigley Field for Game 4 on Wednesday.\"Baseball is a warm weather sport. Guys like to sweat,\" Toronto manager John Gibbons said. \"The pitchers tend to have the advantage and dominate a little bit more because guys get sawed off and guys' hands are hurting. You're just not as loose and relaxed.\"Before the start of the League Championship Series in 1969, the World Series ended by Oct. 16 each year except for 1910, when the NL attempted to expand the regular season from 154 to 168 games before backing off, and 1911, when there were six days off between Games 3 and 4 because of rain. Expanded playoffs and television have extended the schedule.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:02:46.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
