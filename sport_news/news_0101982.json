It's been so much fun to have the family here and have Dad caddying for me,\" Kuchar said.\n\"We've had an amazing time in Fiji and you probably don't have to twist my arm too hard to get me back to Fiji.\"\n(Reporting by Ian Ransom ; Editing by John O'Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T12:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:07:40.871+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
