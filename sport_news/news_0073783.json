Here are a few thoughts from media around the country after the loss.\nDon Williams, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal: To do anything approaching special, Tech has to take care of business against Iowa State and Kansas. The Red Raiders, now 3-2, ought to be able to make 5-2 before that Oct. 24 reunion with Lincoln Riley and Baker Mayfield in Oklahoma. Red flags are popping up, though... The three-game meat grinder portion of the schedule is now complete, Tech having taken one victory and two weeks' worth of mostly positives. With everything that happened Saturday, though - the injuries, the penalties, the turnovers, the defense's failure to appear - there's a chance the tone could change.\nJustin Murphy's now being helped to #TexasTech locker room by a trainer, putting no weight on right leg. Doesn't look good.\n— Don Williams (@AJ_DonWilliams) October 3, 2015 Max Olsen, ESPN: Baylor and Texas Tech combined for 832 total yards on 88 plays during their two-hour-long first half. The Bears only needed 42 plays to surpass 500 yards of offense, and they got there before halftime... This one just got away from the Red Raiders too quickly. Ending five first-half drives in either turnovers or punts made keeping up in this back-and-forth firefight too difficult, and they didn't have many answers for the efficient machine that is Baylor's offense.\n#Baylor 5 TDs on 6 drives. #TexasTech on 5 drives has 2 TD, 2 punts & fumble.\n— Keith Fletcher (@FSFletch) October 3, 2015 Paul Myerberg, USA Today: Texas Tech quarterback Patrick Mahomes' interception five minutes into the second quarter gave Baylor, already up 35-14, possession on the Red Raiders' doorstep. Quarterback Seth Russell's touchdown pass to wide receiver Corey Coleman pushed the Bears' lead to 42-14, and goodnight, Tech... Baylor's 28-point first quarter was impressive but unsurprising. The Bears have scored 28 or more points in the first quarter seven times in their last 30 games\nReserving judgment on Baylor for now. Bears play 2-4 defenses a year that can stop them. Those games decide the season. Tech is not one.\n— David Ubben (@davidubben) October 4, 2015 Nick Talbot, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal: Sandwiched between Baylor's (4-0, 1-0) scores was a 55-yard touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes, who was hampered again by his ailing left knee, to Zach Austin... Despite the hobbled leg, he still showed why Kingsbury has stuck with the sophomore. On a fourth and 6, Mahomes rolled out and found Cameron Batson in the end zone for a 37-yard score.In the second half, Mahomes improvised and scampered 25 yards into the end zone.\nDon Williams, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal: To do anything approaching special, Tech has to take care of business against Iowa State and Kansas.
