Bottas fell to third. \n\nMassa's best lap was two minutes and 0.458 seconds, two-tenths quicker than the time set by Bottas, as the track improved marginally, but a long way off last year's pole time set by world champion Lewis Hamilton in one minute and 38.5 seconds. \n\nDutch teenager Max Verstappen, who celebrated his 18th birthday by passing his driving test last week, was fourth for Toro Rosso ahead of two-time champion Spaniard Fernando Alonso, in his 250th Grand Prix, in a McLaren-Honda running with an updated engine. Local hope Russian Daniil Kvyat was sixth for Red Bull ahead of Spaniard Carlos Sainz in the second Toro Rosso and Briton Jenson Button in the second McLaren. \n\nNo other drivers set meaningful lap times on a day that gave few clues to performance or the qualifying session and race ahead. \"Not a great day for the fans who came here to watch us,\" said German Nico Rosberg, who trails his Mercedes team-mate two-time world champion Briton Lewis Hamilton by 48 points with five races remaining this year. \n\nFrenchman Romain Grosjean, who will leave Lotus for the new American-owned Haas team next year, was equally succinct. \"Boring,\" he said. \"The rain came just before that session so we did a team 'selfie' and we discussed the track... it was too wet and there was no point in running. We'll just have to wait and do all the work on Saturday.\" \n\nIn the absence of any real track action, the paddock was abuzz with rumours about the future of the Red Bull and Toro Rosso teams - who remain without confirmed engine suppliers for next season. Commercial ring-master Bernie Ecclestone was involved in talks with the teams and prospective engine suppliers, but without giving away any clear information. \n\n\"It's all sorted,\" he said, with a typically enigmatic half-smile after making clear he was confident of having a full grid for 2016.
