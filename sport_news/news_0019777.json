Chris Christie 's administration to re-hear the case.\nThat means August's 2-1 decision is vacated and a larger panel of judges will now consider the the matter. A date for the hearing has not been set.\nIt marks the first time that New Jersey has won a legal victory in the four-year, multimillion-dollar saga. And state Sen. Raymond Lesniak (D-Union), the lawmaker who has driven the fight, is hopeful the full Third Circuit will side with the state in the end.\n\"I think it's unlikely the court would have vacated the previous ruling only to reinstate it,\" Lesniak said. \"I'm very optimistic my Super Bowl will have sports betting in Atlantic City and at Monmouth Racetrack.\"\n\"I'm encouraging people to reserve rooms in Atlantic now,\" he added.\nDaniel Wallach, a sports gaming expert, said the state is \"not there yet.\"\nBut this is a major, significant step for New Jersey,\" said Wallach, a gaming and sports law attorney with Becker & Poliakoff in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. \"The pendulum has swung the other way. New Jersey needs only to win once. I believe they are on the path to victory.\"\nNew Jersey has been trying to legalize sports betting to give a boost to Atlantic City and the state's horse-racing industry, both of which have been struggling financially.\nRELATED: Christie asks for re-hearing in N.J.'s sports betting battle\nBut the state has been challenged every step of the way by the NCAA and four professional sports leagues — the NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL — who say New Jersey's effort threatens to damage the integrity of their games and violates a 1992 federal ban on sports betting in all but four states.\nFederal courts have sided with the leagues and against the state on every occasion, including two decisions by Third Circuit panels.\nNew Jersey has spent millions of dollars in legal fees on the case, but state officials argue the Garden State loses millions each year to illegal sports betting operations.\nTuesday's victory comes as a number of other states push for legal sports betting. Indiana, Minnesota, New York, South Carolina, and Texas have all introduced measures this year to legalize such wagering.\nWallach said a New Jersey victory \"will potentially open the floodgates to nationwide sports betting.\"\nHe said he experts neighboring Pennsylvania and Delaware would likely act \"swiftly\" to pass similar legislation — and that it could also force Congress' hand to lift the national ban.\nTuesday's news also comes as Christie fights off low poll numbers in the race for the 2016 Republican nomination for presidents.\nThe governor's office did not immediately return a message seeking comment Wednesday.\nNew Jersey's battle began in 2001, when residents voted to legalizing sports betting. Christie signed it into law a year later.\nBut the leagues sued, and both a federal court and the Third Circuit appeals court sided with them in 2013. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the state's case.\nStill, Lesniak believed he discovered a loophole to get around the ban: allowing private casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting as long as the state didn't sponsor or regulate it. He introduced the bill last year, the state Legislature fast-tracked it, and Christie signed it into law in October.\nBut the leagues sued again, saying New Jersey was still breaking the ban. In November, a federal judge ruled in favor of the leagues again. The Third Circuit followed suit last month, voting 2-1 that the state can't use \"clever drafting\" to get around the ban.\nStill, Judge Julio Fuentes — who ruled against New Jersey in 2013 — was the only member of the panel to favor the state this time, saying that nothing in the ban prevents private companies from setting up sports wagering.\nChristie's administration and the New Jersey Thoroughbred Horsemen's Association responded by asking for an \"en banc\" review — in which at least 12 judges in the Third Circuit would re-hear the case.\nExperts say en banc reviews are rare, but New Jersey had a strong case.\nIf it loses in the re-hearing, the state could petition the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the matter. But Lesniak said such a petition would unlikely be granted.\n\"This is really the last hurrah for us,\" the state senator said. \"I expect it to be a big hurrah.\"\nBrent Johnson may be reached at bjohnson@njadvancemedia.com .
