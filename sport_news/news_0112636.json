But because the governing body also introduced a limit to the number of regular season games teams can schedule, the longtime Cullman coach was left “disappointed,” to say the least. \nFor one more spring, teams will be permitted 18 playing dates during the regular season. After, Class 1A-6A squads will be confined to 28 regular season games and 7A teams to 32. Competition during a school's spring break will not count toward the total. \nWhile the new rule has no effect on most local baseball programs, Cullman is accustomed to packing its schedule with around 40 regular season games a year. This past campaign, the Bearcats played 44 in the regular season and another 11 in the playoffs en route to the 6A state title. \nWith less games, Patterson expects less players to be needed. For a proud program that has so many kids work year round just to get ready for baseball season, the coach is worried playing opportunities — especially for starters at the tail end of the pitching rotation and “guys that normally may not get on the field — won't be as plentiful moving forward. \n“I'm a big fan of playing a lot, because I think it's a reward for your kids to put the uniform on and go out and compete,” Patterson said. “To take away games is ultimately going to take away the number of kids that are going to be participating. In my opinion, you start to diminish the importance of the high school season. \n“Hopefully not here, but in more places, you're going to see more emphasis on summer. I think summer has its place, but I think summer promotes individuality.” \nPatterson pointed to Jacob Heatherly as his prime example of how a Cullman player might've been negatively impacted had the rule been implemented this past season. The sophomore fireballer was sparsely used early in the campaign before seeing more substantial innings when the 'Cats schedule kicked into high gear. \nThe lefty eventually carved a role as the Black and Gold's Game 2 starter for all five rounds of the playoffs and turned his breakout season into an offer from Alabama. \n“Jacob started getting on the field when we were deep in our staff last year,” Patterson said. “It helps develop your program. It helps develop kids. What if Jacob didn't do what he did throughout the end of our high school season, throughout the playoffs, then is he still an Alabama commit right now? I don't know.” \nAn obvious workaround to the new parameters would be for Cullman to play around 10 games during spring break so the difference wouldn't be all that noticeable. Patterson, however, doesn't believe that'd be the healthiest route to take for the kids. \nThe 'Cats generally get in plenty of spring break games at the Hoover Classic but are opting for just four at the IMG Academy National Classic in 2016. That means, had the new rule been put in place a year earlier, the Black and Gold's upcoming regular season would be capped at just 32 games — the same slightly higher number 7A teams will be afforded before factoring in spring break come 2017. \nDon't even get Patterson started on that discrepancy. \n“How I'm getting four less games than the Hoovers and the Spain Parks really blows my mind,” he said. “I understand they've got a week longer in their season because there's only 32 teams in 7A, but I don't care.” \nMore than anything, Patterson wishes there had been more of a discussion before the changes were passed. The coach said he'd heard of proposals but had no idea anything would be set in stone until he was notified of the AHSAA's decision on Wednesday. \nAccording to an AHSAA press release, the rules were recommended and adopted by the AHSAA Baseball Coaches Committee, which is chaired by Mountain Brook coach Lee Gann. \nPatterson said he felt like he and his “coaching friends that have great programs around the state” missed out on the discussions and that “very few of us felt like we had any voice whatsoever.” \n“It just kills me to tell you the truth,” he said. “What I don't want to see is summer ball and travel stuff where they're not really playing for anybody but themselves. I don't want to see that gain more and more significance throughout our state because it doesn't teach the things the game is supposed to teach them, which is teamwork, unselfishness, a work ethic, loyalty, just all those things. \n“Hopefully we can find ways to keep a balance there. But the bottom line is, what I'd try to protect if I'm making the decisions is the integrity of the high school game. And by taking away games, the first thing I think is it hurts that.” \n% Rob Ketcham can be reached at 256-734-2131, ext. 138 or at robk@cullmantimes.com.​ Sign Up / Sign In With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:37:52.130+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
