He's relatable like a friend and he can flat out coach,\" McLaughlin says of Burns, Bryant's assistant coach. \"He's not the type of coach who yells. But you respect him because of his basketball knowledge and how he communicates tactically. He'll sort of give you a look and you'll know what he means. That's so valuable to me as a point guard. In a hostile environment — like at Gonzaga or Indiana — he has a calm form of leadership that makes you feel comfortable.\"\nUSA TODAY\nA coach comes out of the closet\nBurns, a former Bulldogs point guard, felt far from comfortable since his return to campus in 2012. That changed when he came out as gay to McLaughlin and the rest of the team late last month before becoming the first coach in men's Division I basketball. to publicly announce his is gay.\nBryant's Shane McLaughlin, right, dribbles by UConn's Ryan Boatright in a game last season as head coach Tim O'Shea looks on. (Photo: Fred Beckham, AP)\n\"I think he's the perfect person to be the first coach,\" says junior forward Andrew Scocca. \"Burns isn't really a spotlight guy so he's not necessarily about all the attention and he doesn't want to distract the team. But going off of how personable he is as a coach to all of us, that's the type of impact he can have on people around the world who are struggling. Everyone on the team goes to him with their personal problems because he's not afraid to be vulnerable. We trusted him before he told us. Now we trust him even more.\"\nAdds senior forward Curtis Oakley: \"Since he told us, we've grown closer together as a family. In the locker room now, guys express themselves more and we've become more united. …Ultimately, I tell all the younger guys on our team we gotta have Burns’ back like he does ours. That's part of sticking together.\"\nMost players on Bryant's roster, including Oakley, never knew anyone gay before Burns. Oakley's idea of a gay person fit a stereotype: \"Feminine mannerisms, all that,\" he says.\nUSA TODAY\nWhy haven't more coaches come out as gay?\n\"I had no idea because with Burns you never would have guessed. He's a straight hooper,\" says Oakley. \"But I told him right away that don't change nothing. That's my big brother right there, on and off the court. When I got a problem, I go to him. I see him as a person, not a gay dude. I gravitated to him since Day 1. He's the realest dude I know. He just got realer. Him telling the team, that was pure courage. Heroic.\"\nBryant head coach Tim O'Shea calls Burns a \"player's coach.\" He's proud of Burns for his courage to tell the team, as well his players for how maturely they've handled it.\n\"How our players reacted, that's the biggest barometer for me of where society is at with this issue,\" O'Shea says. \"Whenever someone in life has a situation of vulnerability where they're sincere and genuine, you create more trust. We're a family and this situation builds a stronger culture with our team. The players know Chris and we support him being authentic with who he is.\"\nBurns also has the full support of Bryant’s athletic department.\n“Watching Chris as a player, he led by example. He’s doing the same thing here,” says Bryant athletics director Bill Smith, whose first year at the helm was Burns’ senior season as a player. “We’re a family here at Bryant and we support Chris as a member of our family. I’ve been proud of coaching hires I’ve made, but I’m real proud that we have a culture where Chris felt comfortable doing this. He could have taken an easier road. Instead he's doing this for others.\"\nBryant coach Tim O'Shea has helped the program in its transition to Division I. (Photo: Bryant Athletics)\nAmong the major concerns for Burns in going public was how it would affect recruiting, a pivotal part of Division I basketball coaching. On that area, O'Shea says, \"If a high school parent all the sudden feels like we're on the wrong side of this issue and that persuades a kid not to go to Bryant, so what? We move on.\"\nBryant assistant coach Frankie Dobbs, one of Burns' best friends, says he was deeply saddened when he heard of his colleague's double-life due to basketball culture. He believes Burns' story provides an eye-opening education process to the team and the sports world.\n\"In life, how important is it to not judge somebody until you meet them? Chris is the epitome of that,\" says Dobbs. \"He defies the stereotype of what you think of a gay person. He's a manly man. I had no inclination for four years and I was around him every second. And I'm not stupid. The most powerful thing in all this is that he changes perceptions. The idea here is that anyone could be Chris. For me, I see myself in Burns every single day. We think alike and agree on practically everything. At the end of the day, the strongest dude I know is gay. What's that say?\"\nBurns, left, jokes with players during a game last season. (Photo: Bryant Athletics)\nAnother concern for both Burns and O'Shea was how the media attention that surrounds the first openly gay coach would affect the team. Dobbs believes the program will take on a bigger spotlight than it ever has, but it's worth it to be a part of history.\n\"Our guys can handle it,\" Dobbs says. \"You can think of it as a distraction or think about it as the most notoriety this program has ever gotten and think of how many people he's going to reach. This is bigger than his recruiting abilities or the image of the school. This is bigger than basketball. I'm just so proud to say I'm a part of something like this. He's a pioneer. Twenty years from now, down the line, we're going to be living in a different world. What Chris is doing, that's how we get to that point. For the 13-year-old who's confused, Chris' message is that everyone should be the full version of themselves and not live a double life.\"\nESPN college basketball analyst Jay Bilas believes Burns' courage to go public will have a \"profound impact on our sport and on society.\"\n\"Basketball and sports in general are far behind,\" Bilas says. \"Every new person that comes out gets us closer to shrugging shoulders and it not being an issue. It's still an issue because this is a male dominated sport. Who you love does should not affect your profession. What other area of life do you have to be afraid to be who you are? We try to act like it's a different dynamic in sports but it's all the same. The idea that gay athletes and coaches don't exist is just not true. There are gay people in every walk of life.\n\"Anytime something positive like this happens, it helps you identify ignorance. When someone comes out, it allows those people to be refuted and refer to the masses. And the masses will embrace this.\"\nUSA TODAY\nCatch-22: Coming out can quell gay slurs, but fear of homophobia hinders closeted athletes\n***\nFollow college basketball reporter/digital editor Scott Gleeson on Twitter @ScottMGleeson .
