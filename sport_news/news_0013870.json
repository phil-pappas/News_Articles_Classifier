I guess Azam Khan is indirectly seeking the dismissal of the Akhilesh Yadav government,\" Bajpayi added.\n\"In case Azam Khan means the dismissal of the state government, I too support him as the security and well-being of all sections of society, including the Muslims, has been compromised under the Samajwadi Party (SP) government,\" the state BJP president said.\nâ€”IANS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:18:05.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
