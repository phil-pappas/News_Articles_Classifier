Grigson reiterated in February he just wanted to ensure a level of playing field. Fair enough. Plenty of other teams were rooting for the Patriots to get busted, too.\nBut what did the Colts get out of it? Besides an enhanced look of desperation to close the chasm between them and their rivals from Foxborough?\nLittle more than an annoying offseason for the Patriots, who were fined $1 million and docked two draft picks, and Brady, whose four-game suspension was overturned last month by a federal judge. (The NFL is appealing.) On the field, the tangible impact has been nil.\nIf anything, Brady looks more fired up than usual, and the Patriots have reason to really shove it down the throats of a Colts team they’ve trounced four times by a combined score of 189-73 since the current regime came to Indianapolis in 2012.\nUSA TODAY\nOutrageous accusations spew from Colts, Patriots fans\nIt’s the Colts who have gone sideways, even if they have rallied for three straight wins – including two without Luck, who’s dealing with a shoulder problem – by 12 points total against foes from a comically bad AFC South division they’ll probably win again by default.\nIrsay’s inaction has spoken louder than his words on Pagano, whose defense (assembled by Grigson) has been mediocre. Irsay has said he expects to win multiple titles with Luck, 26, so any further evidence the QB’s prime years could be wasted won’t sit well.\nNow the Patriots go into the Colts’ building Sunday as 6½- to 9-point favorites at various sportsbooks, and it’d be an upset if the game’s that close. The Patriots won’t let up.\nGrigson couldn’t have known every detail of his protest would become public. But if all that matters is “what’s best for the horseshoe,” as Pagano and Grigson say, the ‘shoe the Colts hurled at the Patriots turned into a boomerang and hit them square in the nose.\nWhen, not if, the Patriots roll Sunday night, all that will be left is perhaps one more playoff embarrassment for the Colts on their way into what sure looks like an offseason of upheaval.\nFollow Tom Pelissero on Twitte r @TomPelissero\nVIDEO PLAYLIST: LATEST FROM THE NFL NFL Monday Hot Reads: What we learned in Week 5 | 02:27 USA TODAY Sports' Tom Pelissero takes a look at the lessons learned from NFL Week 5.
