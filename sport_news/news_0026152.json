Then we saw corpses around the station,\" said Ahmet Onen, 52.\n\"A demonstration that was to promote peace has turned into a massacre, I don't understand this,\" he said, sobbing.\nReports said hundreds of people in Ankara rushed to hospitals to donate blood for the victims.\nThe death toll surpassed that of the May 2013 twin bombings in Reyhanli on the Syrian border that killed over 50 people.\nWith international concern growing over instability in the key NATO member, EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini urged Turkey to \"stand united against terrorists\".\nUN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said in a statement he \"expects the perpetrators of these terrorist acts to be swiftly brought to justice\". â€”AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:41:31.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
