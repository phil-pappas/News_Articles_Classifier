A lot of those are on Bernier, who was supposed to have cleared up that bothersome issue. \nHe’s atoned with some fine work in the final 40 minutes in Pittsburgh, coming back from two goals in 39 seconds on Saturday to make a total of 31 saves. Patric Hornqvist was left staring at the Consol Energy Center roof when Bernier robbed him with a second-period glove. \n“You saw what he’s capable of in the second and third period,” coach Babcock said. “We need that at the start. \n“Whether it goes good or bad, (at the start) let’s get ready for the next shift. But catch-up hockey is losing hockey. You want to start on time, you want to take the lead. Once he was settled in, Bernie played good.” \nBernier blamed himself for giving Evgeni Malkin too much of the far post to aim for at the 5:49 mark of the game. \n“That’s my goal, for sure. I just have to track it better,” Bernier said. “I just kind of took my body away from it. I definitely just have to be ready mentally. It’s nothing physical, I have to be sharp right off the bat.” \nSpecial KK day \nA day after Phil Kessel was blanked by the Leafs, Kasperi Kapanen had his first goal for the Marlies. \nObtained with centre Nick Spaling and defenceman Scott Harrington on July 1 in the Kessel deal with Pittsburgh, the young Kapanen was playing in his first game after an opening-week illness. \nBut his goal and Matt Frattin’s first of the year were not enough to stop the Albany Devils in a 3-2 loss Sunday at Ricoh Coliseum. It was the first defeat for Toronto’s farm team in four games. William, Nylander, Stu Percy, Connor Brown and T.J. Brennan all had assists in the game. Garret Sparks made 28 saves. \nHelping Bernie \nThe first two Leafs to skate back and console Bernier after Pittsburgh’s quick goals were young defenceman Morgan Rielly and alternate captain Matt Hunwick. \n“It’s a little bit of support,” Hunwick said. “No one wants to feel that they’re hung out to dry. We’re always there for each other. You give him a tap and let him know that we’ll play hard for him and he obviously made a lot of big saves from that point, did a great job keeping us in the game.” \nAt the other end, Hunwick has shown a desire to hop into the rush and get back in time to avert danger. With Rielly and Jake Gardiner, that’s three defencemen with a knack for using speed on the attack. \n“You try and do it when it’s there, but you can’t force the issue,” Hunwick said. “Especially playing against some of the forwards (the Penguins) have. It could be a 2-on-1 (the other way). Those guys can certainly finish, so you want to work as a five-man unit. \n“If there’s a time to jump, you’d certainly like to do it and try to create offence from the back end.” \nLoose Leafs \nAn update is expected Monday on the condition of centre Tyler Bozak, whose lower-body injury kept him out of the third period in Columbus and all of Saturday’s game. If it’s long term, the Leafs will look at an extra centre with Mark Arcobello now in Bozak’s place ... The Leafs have two goals in 15 power-play attempts so far, though not all were the full two minutes. The use of four forwards means lots of creativity, but so far, modest results. \n“I would have liked to have zipped one in the net,” Babcock said of the unit not coming through with an equalizing goal on Saturday. “It’s great to say you have looks, but it has to go in once in awhile. There’s nothing wrong with bar-down (driving the net).”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:23:47.633+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
