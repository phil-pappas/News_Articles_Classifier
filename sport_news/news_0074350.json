The one catch is that the player who commits the penalty doesn't have to do pushups.\n\"Just see how many people he is affecting,\" Ryan said. \"That his actions are affecting. Penalties still gonna happen, but we have to eliminate them to the best of our abilities. Especially the self-inflicted ones.\"\nRyan implemented the same pushup penalty when he was with the Jets both in 2010 and 2013. Bills players seemed to respond a bit Wednesday.\n\"It's one of those things where you mess up and you have 60-something people doing pushups,\" Incognito said. \"You're sitting there thinking, 'Wow, that not only affected me, that affects our entire organization.' It's a good little reminder.\"\nAt the very least, nobody wants to be the one responsible for having everyone on the practice field doing pushups.\n\"I think that should be our motto for the week, 'Don't be that guy,'\" running back Boobie Dixon said.\nOf course, it will take more than a few pushups for the Bills to fix their penalty problem. The Bills have 47 penalties through four games, and the next closest team is the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with 38.\n\"There's a lot more going on behind the scenes than just pushups,\" Incognito said. \"We've been talking about it all week. I think we're going to change our mental approach going into games. There's a lot of things that need to be addressed. It's one of those things that we can control. It's completely on us. It's something that we can fix.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:29:09.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
