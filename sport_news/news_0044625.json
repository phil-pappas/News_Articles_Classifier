They can still bounce back in a division where the other three teams are each 2-2, but they hardly look like a legitimate playoff contender.\nCritics are hammering Kelly for his risky, headline-grabbing offseason moves, and many are questioning his up-tempo offense that leaves the defense on the field far too long. Kirk Cousins led the Redskins on a 15-play, 90-yard touchdown drive late in the fourth quarter against a defense that look tired after being on the field two-thirds of the game.\nBut Kelly sees a team that's a couple plays from 3-1.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\n___\nFollow Rob Maaddi on Twitter: https://twitter.com/AP_RobMaaddi\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
