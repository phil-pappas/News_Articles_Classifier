Cueto, though, was true to form, gesturing and smirking to the crowd as he strode off the field.\nJays starter Marcus Stroman scattered 11 hits and four runs over a 6.1-inning effort that was effective if not dominant; most importantly, the young gun once again delivered in a high-pressure situation, the fourth such game he’s done so since his storied comeback in September from a devastating knee injury in spring training.\nNow trailing the series 2-1 , the Jays turn to knuckle baller R.A. Dickey Tuesday night in Game 4, while the Royals counter with 6-foot-10 right-hander Chris Young (whose wife Elizabeth, is the grand daughter of hockey legend Lester Patrick, the namesake of the NHL’s Patrick Division and Lester Patrick Trophy).\nToronto fell behind 1-0 within the first three pitches of the game from Stroman, who gave up a lead-off triple to Alcides Escobar and an RBI ground out to second from Ben Zobrist.\nZobrist, whom the Jays have sought in deadline trades the past three seasons, put the ball in play to the right side of the infield to score the run – a typical piece of hitting that has characterized the Royals since their World Series drive last season.\nToronto rebounded with a three-run inning in the second, triggered by Goins two-run double in a great at-bat against Cueto. Goins worked the count to full at 3-2, then took a weak slider to the left field to bring in the runs. Donaldson followed with a single to score Goins with that third run.\nCueto, with 50 pitches on board after two innings, and bombarded with jeers from a raucous Rogers Centre crowd ever for a Jays game, collapsed in the third; he delivered a flat fastball over the heart of the plate to Tulowitzki for a three-run homer that proved the crushing blow for the Royals.\nDonaldson followed up five batters later with a two-run shot off reliever Kris Medlen, the second homer of the inning, but the runs were charged to Cueto in what was a nightmarish frame.\nBy the time it was over, Toronto had boarded six runs, with the first six batters of the inning reaching base safely. Overall, Cueto lasted just two innings plus six batters – he was tagged for six hits and eight runs overall on 69 pitches.\nToronto went 6-for-10, with a homer, a hit batter, a stolen base, and four walks, against Cueto after he retired the first two batters of the game in order.\nTulowitzki bagged his eighth RBI of the post-season, tying him for sixth all-time in club history for the most RBI in a post-season. He also became the first Jay ever with multiple three-run homers (his second) in the post-season. He was also ejected for arguing balls and strikes in the eight inning.\nDonaldson joined Joe Carter and Candy Maldonado (92), and Paul Molitor (93), as the only Jays with three post-season homers (no one has ever hit four).\nThe six-run third also tied a club record for the most runs scored in a single inning in post-season history.\nMore on thestar.com\nFans confident Blue Jays can get back in the series\nPatient Cubs will stick with what got them to NLCS", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:29:34.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
