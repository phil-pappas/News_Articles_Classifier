Then they made a great play on the power play. We had it covered and it still went in.\"\nTexas (2-0-0-0) opened the scoring at 13:26 of the first period after the Wolves gave away the puck in their own end. Right wing Matej Stransky wound up with possession at the hashmarks of the right circle and snapped a shot past Pheonix Copley's blocker.\nThe Stars forced another turnover a few minutes later with their aggressive forecheck, which led to center Gemel Smith's one-timer from the slot that gave Texas a 2-0 lead at 16:46 of the first.\nThe Wolves (1-1-0-0) pulled within 2-1 at 6:20 of the second on Harrold's snapper from the top of the right circle that found a home in the upper left corner of the net. Andre Benoit and captain Pat Cannone set up Harrold's goal, which came four seconds after a Wolves power play expired.\nChicago forced a 2-2 tie at 16:09 of the second on Kristo's first goal with the Wolves. Cannone launched a shot from the right corner that Texas goaltender John Muse steered aside, but the carom went directly to Kristo bearing down on the crease for a quick strike.\nTexas recovered swiftly with a pair of goals nine seconds apart. Devin Shore blocked a shot, carried it all the way down the ice and slammed on the brakes just outside the crease to poke a shot past Copley at 16:49 of the third period.\nThe Stars went on their first power play one second later and veteran Greg Rallo capitalized with a quick shot from the bottom of the left circle to push Texas' lead to 4-2 at 16:58.\nTexas boosted its lead to 5-2 at 1:13 of the third when Rallo tipped a shot from the point on the power play, but the Wolves answered 30 seconds later with Rattie's precise shot from the bottom of the left circle set up by Justin Hodgman's wraparound from behind the net.\nThe Stars short-circuited that Chicago rally as Cole Ully launched a blast crossing through the high slot at 4:41 to make it 6-3 for the visitors.\nCopley (0-1-0), making his Wolves debut, stopped 23 of 30 shots. Muse (2-0-0) posted 23 saves to earn the win.\n Rosemont Wolves Hockey Pro Men", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-17T07:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:39:29.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
