In a sense that described the Taft junior varsity volleyball team Tuesday evening after they fell 25-16, 25-12 to the Bakersfield Christian Eagles in Taft. “Our goal today was to hang with them and get double digits and we did that,” said Taft coach Suzanne White. “I thought we played well.” With the loss, Taft falls to 10-9-2 overall and 4-2 in the South Sequoia League. The start of the match turned out to be a battle with the Lady Wildcats getting the first point. After Bakersfield Christian outscored the Lay Wildcats 4-1, Taft answered with a point to cut the lead to one. That is when the Lady Eagles started to pull away with a 6-2 run including three straight points to start the run. Taft cut the deficit to one at 10-6 but the Lady Eagles countered with a pair of points to increase their lead to 12-6. Taft whittled the lead down to four thanks in part to Alyssa Reeves’ ace. Bakersfield Christian maintained a three to five point lead until the Lady Eagles went on a 5-1 run to lead 20-12. Taft cut the lead down to five before Bakersfield Christian went on another 5-1 run to close out the set. The Lady Eagles roared out the gates to begin the second set with a 7-2 run. After Taft got another point, Bakersfield Christian went on a 4-1 run to lead 12-4. Taft threatened to get back into the set with three straight points to cut the deficit down to 12-7. Bakersfield Christian took off again with an 8-2 run including five straight points. Taft ended the run but the Lady Eagles went on a 5-2 run to close out the set and match. Yaws and Roslyn Maino each had a kill. White feels that the match against Bakersfield Christian will help the team in the second half of the season. “I think doing well against BCHS will motivate them against the other teams,” she said. “I think the momentum will carry over.” Taft opens the second half of the league season Thursday when they traveled to Arvin.
