(CHRIS KNIGHT / SPECIAL TO THE MORNING CALL) Nick Fierro Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call #Eagles emerge from slop with big victory over NFC East rival New York. \nPHILADELPHIA — Sloppy football reigned, but so did the Philadelphia Eagles' defensive line. \nOn Monday night, that was all the Eagles needed to somehow catapult themselves into a first-place tie in the NFC East with a 27-7 triumph over the visiting New York Giants at Lincoln Financial Field. \nThe Giants (3-3), who committed just three turnovers in their first five games, had that many by halftime of this one, and it was the only reason the Eagles (3-3) were able to go to intermission with a 17-7 advantage. \nQuarterback Eli Manning passed for 162 yards in the first half but was victimized by two interceptions, including one that was returned for a touchdown by cornerback Nolan Carroll. \nAfter opening the game with a dazzling 80-yard touchdown drive, finishing it with a 13-yard strike to Odell Beckham, Manning and the Giants never sniffed the end zone again, thanks to an offense that self-destructed the few times its offensive line wasn't throttled by the men on the other side of the line of scrimmage. \nPHOTO GALLERY: The Eagles take on the Giants on Monday Night Football from Lincoln Financial Field \nThough the Eagles and quarterback Sam Bradford (24-for-38, 280 yards, three interceptions) were equally inconsistent on offense, they made enough plays to have the game all but sealed by the time the fourth quarter began. \nLate in the first quarter, on a drive set up by a DeMeco Ryans interception, Bradford drove the team 78 yards for a touchdown, hitting Riley Cooper with a 32-yard pass to finish it off. \nIn the second quarter, after Carroll's TD, Caleb Sturgis made good on a 37-yard field goal attempt with 3 seconds left to increase the Eagles' cushion. \nThe second half began for the Eagles much the way the first half unfolded for them offensively. Jordan Matthews fumbled away a reception to end the first series and they went three-and-out on the second — only to be bailed out by a penalty for running into the kicker that put the offense back on the field. \nPHOTO GALLERY: See photos of the Eagles cheerleaders and fans at Monday night's game against the Giants. \nEight plays later, DeMarco Murray ran 12 yards for a touchdown and a 24-7 lead. \nMurray finished with 109 rushing yards. \nBut it was the defense that dominated, sacking Manning four times and holding the Giants to 247 net yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T06:58:37.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
