Troopers Brian Viglione and Ryan Hickey were monitoring traffic when they noticed the SUV and followed it off the highway. Shortly after exiting the highway, the SUV was involved in a collision with two other cars; a 2001 blue Chrysler Town and Country and a 2013 blue Ford Flex. Witnesses at the scene told troopers the operator of the black SUC caused the collision and fled. Nashua police helped state troopers and a State Police K-9 unit search for the suspect.
