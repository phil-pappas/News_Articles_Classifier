Michigan State won 52-26 to remain undefeated. (Photo: Robin Buckson, Detroit News) \nEast Lansing — Michigan State’s running game was going nowhere and its defense was struggling against Indiana’s offense on Saturday. \nBut as it has been so many times over the last three seasons, the difference was Connor Cook. \nThe Michigan State quarterback threw for a career-high 398 yards and four touchdowns, two going to R.J. Shelton, as No. 7 Michigan State came away with a 52-26 victory over Indiana in front of 74,144 at Spartan Stadium. \nBOX SCORE: Michigan State 52, Indiana 26 \nCook was 30-for-52 and finished 2 yards shy of the single-game Michigan State record. Bill Burke threw for 400 yards in a victory over Michigan in 1999. Cook also moved into second place all-time with 64 career touchdown passes, two behind Kirk Cousins. \nAaron Burbridge had eight catches for 128 yards and a touchdown while Shelton finished with six grabs for 76 yards. Delton Williams added a 1-yard touchdown run while Josiah Price had a 13-yard scoring catch. In the fourth quarter, LJ Scott had a 26-yard touchdown run and Gerald Holmes added a 22-yard score after MSU recovered a fumbled kickoff late in the fourth quarter. \nThe Spartans (8-0, 4-0 Big Ten) head to the bye week, with a trip to Nebraska coming in two weeks. \nNate Sudfeld threw for 308 yards and three touchdowns for Indiana (4-4, 0-4), which lost for the fourth straight game. Simmie Cobbs had five catches for 108 yards and a touchdown while Jordan Howard scored on a 5-yard run. Ricky Jones and Andre Booker added touchdown catches for the Hoosiers. \nThe first half had plenty of things going on, but defense wasn’t one of them. \nCook threw for 260 yards and two touchdowns while Sudfeld went for 197 yards and a couple of scores as Michigan State held a 21-20 lead at the break, thanks to a missed Indiana extra point. \nIt started well for Michigan State as safety Grayson Miller got his first career interception on the first play from scrimmage. It gave the Spartans the ball at the Indiana 37, but they did nothing but go the wrong way. A 2-yard loss on a first-down run was followed by a 7-yard sack of Cook. An incomplete pass on third-and-19 was followed by a punt that went through end zone. Indiana essentially only lost 5 yards and wasted little time carving up the Michigan State defense, going 80 yards on 10 plays and taking a 7-0 lead on a 5-yard run from Jordan Howard with 9:12 left in the first quarter. \nThe Spartans bounced right back, however, as Cook started heating up. He had a 31-yard connection with Burbridge on third-and-8 before hitting Shelton for a 22-yard touchdown pass to tie the score at 7 with 5:56 left in the first quarter. \nA quick, torrential downpour aided a three-and-out for the Michigan State defense, one that ended just as the Spartans regained possession. \nMichigan State kept rolling on offense, going 64 yards on nine plays and capping the drive with a 1-yard run by Williams to give the Spartans a 14-7 lead on the first play of the second quarter. After Michigan State was forced to punt, Indiana got back on the board, due in part to a pair of personal foul calls on the Spartans. \nTackle Joel Heath sacked Sudfeld for a 9-yard loss and Indiana was set to face a third-and-22. But Demetrius Cooper was called for hands to the face to give the Hoosiers a first down. On the next play, cornerback Arjen Colquhoun was called for unnecessary roughness on a tackle. Indiana scored on the next play, an 11-yard pass from Sudfeld to Jones. The extra point missed, keeping the Spartans in front, 14-13. \nMichigan State answered with a long drive that took up most of the second-quarter clock and left the Spartans with a 21-13 lead with 1:37 left. Cook hit Burbridge with an 11-yard pass to cap the drive, one Cook left for one play after taking a big hit to the ribs. It was plenty of time for the Hoosiers, however, as they went 77 yards on just four plays, ending a 25-second drive with a 37-yard pass from Sudfeld to Cobbs. \nWith 1:07 on the clock, Cook marched Michigan State back into Indiana territory before special teams crumbled for the Spartans. Michael Geiger was lined up to attempt a 35-yard field goal, but a bad snap ended the drive. \nMichigan State opened the second half with a 58-yard kickoff return from Shelton, and the Spartans turned it into a touchdown and a 28-20 lead with 11:07 left in the third quarter. Scott scored on a 3-yard run, but a holding penalty brought the play back. After two incomplete passes, Cook threw a 13-yard strike to tight end Price for the score. Indiana’s quick-strike attack wasted little time in finding the end zone again. The Hoosiers went 75 yards in just 1:22, finishing with a 3-yard pass from Sudfeld to Booker with 9:45 left in the third quarter. \nAfter a couple of MSU punts and a missed field goal from Indiana, Michigan State extended the lead to 31-26 with 12:44 to play on a 21-yard field goal by Michael Geiger. The drive lasted 15 plays, but the Spartans came up 3 yards short of the end zone. \nMichigan State got a big stop on its next series, overcoming what appeared to be a recovered fumble. The offense answered with a 71-yard drive that ended with a 10-yard touchdown pass from Cook to Shelton with 4:57 to play. Scott and Holmes then put the game away with the final two touchdowns. \nmcharboneau@detroitnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:36:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:51:07.209+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
