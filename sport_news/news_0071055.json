Her husband had taken her trout fishing there in 1979 for their third date. He told her if he died, he wanted his ashes left there.\nShe has twice met with the woman who helped her that day and has thanked her each time.\n\"She said she doesn't feel like a hero. She said she was just glad to be there to help,\" Jan said. \"But I consider her a hero because she took the time out to help me and I'll always appreciate that.\"\nShe spends her days with her three dogs and that helps keep her spirits up. She's closer to her children, she said. She has since begun taking classes at Mount Hood Community College.\n-- Everton Bailey Jr.\nebailey@oregonian.com\n503-221-8343; @EvertonBailey", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/EvertonBailey"], "published": "2015-10-16T21:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:39:13.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
