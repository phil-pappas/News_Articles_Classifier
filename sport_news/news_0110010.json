He had a great outing against Houston in Kansas City and his last two starts were really, really good.\"\nYoung broke into the majors in 2004 and over 11 seasons has played for five different teams, never winning more than 12 games in a campaign.\nThis season, the 36-year-old posted a record of 11-6 in 34 appearances that included a 7-5 loss to the Blue Jays in July.\nHe also made a relief appearance in Game One of the AL division series against Houston, giving up a run in four solid innings of work.\n\"Moments like this are what I dreamed about and aspired to achieve going through surgeries and rehabs,\" said Young, looking ahead to his start.\n\"It's been nine years since I've been in the postseason, and now to have this opportunity and help this club who has, one, lifted me up, and secondly, given me an opportunity.\n\"Comparing myself to nine years ago, I guess at the time I thought there would be a lot more playoff opportunities going through it.\n\"Maybe have lost a few miles an hour on the fastball but hope I can make up for it with a little bit more between the ears.\"\nKnown as a fly ball pitcher, Young has benefited from playing home games at the expansive Kauffman Stadium, which gave up the fewest home runs in the major leagues this season.\nThe cozy Rogers Centre however, is known as a hitters ball park and Young will be challenged to keep the ball from flying into the stands.\n\"If he's got the fastball and slider going he's going to be very, very tough,\" Yost added. \"Again, every pitcher has to execute.\n\"If a pitcher executes he's going to be in good shape. If he doesn't, he probably won't be in good shape. But we expect Chris to execute tomorrow (Tuesday).\"\n(Editing by John O'Brien)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T09:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:34:07.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
