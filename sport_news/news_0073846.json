The detectors replaced the “wands” security staff previously used to check people for weapons. \n“It’s a simple process,” said Dan Mahoney, vice president of broadcasting and corporate communications for the Thunder. “It’s not like the airport, you don’t have to take off your shoes, don’t have to take off your belt.” \nFans should expect to put aside their cellphones and large items, like keys or belt buckles, before going through the metal detectors. \nIn light of recent deadly shootings across the nation, fans are happy about the new system. \n“I like the security,” Melissa Bauman said. “I think that’s great.” \nWhile fans get used to the system, Mahoney encourages ticket holders to arrive early prior to games. \n“The security of our fans is of the utmost importance to us,” Mahoney said. “But this is not a reflection of any additional threats, any additional need for security. This is simply a precaution.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:42:24.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
