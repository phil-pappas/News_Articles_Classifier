Place Stadium.\n\nVancouver Whitecaps' Kendall Waston, centre, of Costa Rica, Tim Parker, right, and Octavio Rivero, left, of Uruguay, celebrate Waston's goal against the Houston Dynamo during the second half of an MLS soccer game in Vancouver, B.C., on Sunday October 25, 2015. THE CANADIAN PRESS/Darryl Dyck \nThe 20-year-old Gambian dropped to his knees after his shot hit the back of the net before racing to the Whitecaps' bench to celebrate with teammates.\nWaston put the game out of reach by heading a corner kick home in the 72nd minute for a 2-0 lead before Robert Earnshaw added another in stoppage time on header of his own.\nThe result, coupled with the Los Angeles Galaxy's 2-1 loss to Sporting Kansas City, means that Vancouver (16-13-5) will get a first-round bye while also clinching the franchise's first home playoff game since joining MLS in 2011.\nVancouver will play the first leg of the conference semifinal on the road on Nov. 1 before the second leg goes at B.C. Place Stadium on Nov. 8.\nThe Whitecaps entered Sunday with just two league wins since the middle of August (2-5-2) and could have finished anywhere from second and sixth in the West depending on their game with the Dynamo and results elsewhere.\nVancouver made the playoffs in 2012 and again last year, losing single elimination first-round matches on the road both times.\nWillis made a couple of big saves for Houston (11-14-9), which had already been eliminated from playoff contention.\nVancouver has had issues scoring all season, and had a number of chances to grab the lead early against the Dynamo.\nWillis made a diving stop on a header from Whitecaps striker Octavio Rivero inside three minutes before stretching to stop Matias Laba's shot from distance moments later.\nVancouver's Cristian Techera then rattled Willis' crossbar with a thunderous strike from 25 yards out that bounced down but stayed out in the 13th minute.\nDespite not having anything to play for other than pride and jobs next season, the Dynamo looked confident moving forward at times and got their first opportunity on free kick in the 21st off the boot of Giles Barnes that Whitecaps goalkeeper David Ousted stopped comfortably.\nVancouver, which had to play a meaningless CONCACAF Champions League game in Honduras on Thursday, had another chance in the 29th, but Waston's header off a corner kick hit the turf at B.C. Place Stadium before bouncing into Willis' arms.\nHouston then put a scare into the Whitecaps in the 37th minute when Barnes blasted a shot from 25 yards out that was stopped by a diving Ousted.\n---\nFollow @JClipperton_CP on Twitter\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:24:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:22:24.273+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
