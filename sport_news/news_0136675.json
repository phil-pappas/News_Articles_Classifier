They cheered, and a few screamed, \"We love you, Geno.\" \nAfter the opening festivities, there was a three-point shooting contest won by Moriah Jefferson, who defeated Samuelson in the final round. Samuelson advanced by beating Breanna Stewart,. \n\"I just went out there and shot it,\" Samuelson told Joe D'Ambrosio on the court. \"That's what I do.\" \nNext was an impromptu alumni three-point contest pitting Donny Marshall against Allen, the greatest three-point shooter in NBA history. Who won? Marshall, of course. \nMarshall was the first to convert a three-pointer. Allen buried one as he walked off the court, looked toward the crowd and shrugged. \nThe slam dunk contest was won by transfer Shonn MIller, who defeated freshman Steve Enoch. \nWhen the game began — Team Kevin vs. Team Geno — the players were hitting their stride. There was little defense as players ran from one end of the court to the other, tossing no-look passes and alley-oops and dunking whenever possible. \nJefferson, of Team Kevin, dribbled through a crowd at midcourt, grinning as she weaved through defenders. Later, she drove through the paint only to have her shot blocked by Phil Nolan. And when her teammate Amida Brimah, knocked down a three, Jefferson ran back on defense with her hands raised over her head. \nAs the buzzer sounded at the half, Adams hit a three-pointer for Team Geno. And just before the final buzzer, Adams converted a dunk to send the crowd home with one last thrill. \nThe final: Team Geno 63, Team Kevin 56. \nNolan led all scorers with 14 points; Enoch and Miller had 12 each for Team Kevin. Stewart, the most celebrated player on the court, had four points. \nWhen it was over, the players were smiling and the fans were satisfied. The freshmen got a taste of UConn basketball and the veterans got a respite from the preseason practice grind. \n\"I know they like a break from me,\" Ollie said. \"Instructing, I call it. Not yelling at them, but instructing them. So they get to have fun, go out and dance and really give the fans a show. Because if it wasn't for our fans, if it wasn't for our family, we wouldn't be here.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:05:05.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
