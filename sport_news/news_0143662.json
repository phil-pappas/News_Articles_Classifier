Bae and Korean-born Danny Lee walked off with a 1-up victory over Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker. \nThe International team also picked up wins from Louis Oosthuizen and Branden Grace and from Thongchai Jaidee and Charl Schwartzel. The three wins and a half-point in another match cut the American lead to 5 1/2 to 4 1/2 going into a double session of eight matches on Saturday. \nThat halved match got most of the attention at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea when the International team effectively went from all square to 2 up in one hole. \nIt started when Phil Mickelson mistakenly broke the one-ball rule by substituting a different model ball on the par-5 seventh hole to help him reach the green in two. According to the rule, players must use the same model of golf ball for the entire match. \nMickelson realized his error from the fairway, and then the rules committee made a mistake of its own by telling him he was disqualified from the hole.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:04:17.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
