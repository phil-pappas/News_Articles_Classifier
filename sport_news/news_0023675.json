A longing to go back to the old times is a blessing for mankind, to once more relive the days gone by and experience happiness. It is rejuvenating, not the same feeling, but quite close. Whenever I am alone, I find myself travelling back to my childhood. Isn’t a journey back to one’s childhood the most cherished dream? Only if it could come true. Undoubtedly, our childhood was starkly different from what we see around us in the present times. It was more simple in the absence of television and commonplace gadgets like Ipads and smartphones, which for our children is a necessity. Instead, we had simple wooden toys to delight us. What is childhood without flying kites, getting drenched in rain, playing stapu or pithu garam? I pity children confined to match-box flats and spending time playing electronic games at malls. I still have fond recollections of the outdoor games we played. Summer would bring its bitter- sweet experience. Our granny, a stern lady, would force an obnoxious indigenous herbal concoction, chairata, down our throats to detoxify our bodies. It still brings back the nightmare for me. Being the youngest sibling, and also frail, I would hide in a dark and dingy storeroom. Unfortunately, the cook would always locate me and present me like a culprit before her. When granny would thrust chairata down my throat, my mother would hold my arms and the cook my legs. What a terrible memory! But this wasn’t the end. Next came neem. Its leaves were ground every fortnight and we were made to drink it like manna from heaven to ward off the ill-effects of mangoes. Sure, granny’s home remedies gifted us a clear skin, without any blemishes. Summer brought its pleasures too. The taste of the delectable mango ice-cream my mother made in a wooden machine still lingers in my mouth. How we would vie with one another to move its handle to churn the sweet treat. Wild berries and shahtoot made up the other unforgettable summer treats. The unique taste of fresh tandoori roti with a big dollop of homemade white butter and sugar or ‘aam ka achaar’. Simple food, but even the gods would be tempted to taste it. Winter was enjoyable too. Mother’s mouth-watering pinnis and gajar ka halwa with nuts were to die for. There were no chocolates then. We would raid the kitchen for Ovaltine and Horlicks. Grandma would keep these on the top shelf. We would tiptoe to the kitchen while the rest of the family enjoyed siesta, and climbing atop my brother, I would bring the tins down. We would have our fill, eating greedily with our hands. Before we left, we would ensure the tins were back in their place and our mouths were diligently wiped on our sleeves. Sometimes, a tiny spot would betray us. It was also the time for milk loaded with dry fruits at night to ward off cold. Wish it was possible to turn back the clock to enable the present-day kids to taste the little treats of our childhood.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:18:53.052+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
