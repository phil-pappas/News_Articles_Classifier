Ryan Vogelsong plans to keep pitching — somewhere 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nOn the day Jeremy Affeldt announced his retirement and Tim Hudson pitched his final game in the majors, Ryan Vogelsong said he wants to keep pitching. \n“About next year, I can say this: I’m playing baseball somewhere,” said Vogelsong, who permitted one hit and struck out six batters in four scoreless innings Thursday. “Where that’s going to be, I have no idea. \n“I’m playing. I don’t feel it’s time to stop playing yet. My body’s not telling me it’s time. My stuff’s not telling me it’s time. I still love to pitch. I still love to compete. It’s not time for me to stop playing yet, but I’m not sure where that’s going to be.” \nVogelsong, 38, won two World Series rings with the Giants and was a huge factor in the 2012 postseason, posting a 3-0 record and 1.09 ERA in four starts. Counting 2014, the Giants won all seven of his postseason starts. \n“It’s a tough week because it’s probably going to be the end of the road here,” Vogelsong said. “Obviously, I love being a Giant. It’s why I came back in 2011. It’s tough and it’s sad, but I’m trying to finish up my last couple of days here strong and see where the wind blows me next.” \nVogelsong’s journey and late-career success have been well-chronicled. Reflecting on his comeback story with the Giants, he said, “I never thought that was going to happen to me when I was in Japan and struggling, being an All-Star and World Series champion not once but twice. So there are a lot of good memories.” \nWith Thursday’s outing, Vogelsong said he proved he’s not done. He said he watched video in recent weeks to try rebounding to his 2011 and 2012 form and thinks he’s close. \n“If this is the last one (as a Giant), it’s been a fun ride. It’s been an amazing ride,” Vogelsong said. “Things have happened to me here with this team in this city that I never thought would happen to me and my career. The fans have been great to me and my family. I couldn’t ask for more from them.” \nJohn Shea is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. \nOn deck", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:10:41.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
