Baylor and TCU topped all of our voters' ballots.\nAfter that, things got a little murky.\nHere's a look at this week's Best in Texas poll, which is voted on by the Dallas Morning News' college insiders and bloggers, as well as Denton Record-Chronicle's Brett Vito. Make sure to click here to view the full breakdown .\n1. Baylor, 132 points (12 first-place votes) Baylor (7-0, 4-0 Big 12) / Beat Iowa State 45-27 on Oct. 24 / Next: Bye\nBaylor had a harder than expected win over Iowa State, but pulled off a tough 45-27 win at McLane. Unfortunately, while the Bears might have gotten the win, they lost starting QB Seth Russell to a fractured bone in his neck. It's unclear at this point how long he will be out, but Jarrett Stidham will need to come in and prove why he was a five-star prospect coming out of Stephenville last season. -- Shehan Jeyarajah\n2. TCU, 121 points TCU Horned Frogs (7-0, 4-0 Big 12) / Last: Bye. / Next: vs. West Virginia, 6:30 p.m. Thursday at Amon G. Carter Stadium in Fort Worth.\nThe Horned Frogs received their much-needed bye last week, setting up a grueling run through Big 12 conference play that kicks off with the Mountaineers in prime time Thursday. A status update to look out for is that of freshman receiver/return man KaVontae Turpin, who was knocked out of the Iowa State game early with an upper-body injury. Three of TCU's final five games involve Oklahoma State (Nov. 7), Oklahoma (Nov. 21) and Baylor (Nov. 27), which are a combined 11-1 in league action. So although TCU's first four Big 12 games made for a major test of its mettle, the next five, it seems, should very well define the season. -- Jose Rodriguez\n3. Texas A&M, 105 points Texas A&M (5-2, 2-2 SEC) / Lost to Ole Miss, 23-3 / Next: vs South Carolina, 11 a.m. Saturday in College Station\nA&M suffered its second straight defeat with a 23-3 loss to Ole Miss in what some consider to be the worst loss of the Kevin Sumlin era. One week after throwing three interceptions for touchdowns, sophomore Kyle Allen followed up with a dismal 12-of-34 passing for only 88 yards and an interception. There are a mountain of issues regarding quarterbacks, and the rest of the offense, that must be addressed before Sumlin and the Aggies take the field next week against the South Carolina Gamecocks. -- Brandon Wheeland\n4. Houston, 102 points Houston (7-0, 4-0 AAC) / Beat UCF, 59-10 / Next: vs. Vanderbilt, 6 p.m. Saturday\nHouston got off to a slow start against UCF but turned on the jets and cruised to an easy win over winless UCF to remain unbeaten. The Cougars once again showed why they are one of the top non-Power 5 teams in the country as they racked up 600 yards of offense and forced four turnovers. While Vanderbilt isn't exactly a powerhouse, Houston will have an opportunity to make a statement by taking down an SEC team next week. -- E.J. Holland\n5. Texas, 85 points Texas (3-4, 2-2 Big 12) / Defeated Kansas State, 23-9 / Next: at Iowa State, 6 p.m. Saturday in Ames, Iowa\nThe Longhorns inched closer to bowl eligibility with a win over Kansas State. Texas has found its identity with its running game. The Longhorns were able to rush for 274 yards against the Wildcats. Senior running back Johnathan Gray had his first 100-yard rushing day of the season with 107 yards, Saturday. Junior quarterback Tyrone Swoopes also had a big day against Kansas State. Swoopes, who's been nicknamed '18 wheeler' because of his jersey number and physical running, scored three touchdowns and ran for 50 yards. Texas' defense had another good performance as it held the Wildcats to 242 total yards. The Longhorns look to keep rolling and get back to .500 against Iowa State on Oct. 31. -- Nick Castillo\n6. Texas Tech, 82 points Texas Tech (5-3, 2-3 Big 12) / Lost to Oklahoma, 63-27 / Next: vs. Oklahoma State, Saturday in Lubbock\nTexas Tech's defensive scheme emphasizes turnovers under defensive coordinator David Gibbs. The Red Raiders have 9 takeaways in five Big 12 games - behind only No. 2 Baylor and No. 14 Oklahoma in conference play. Defending opposing rushing attacks has not proven as efficient for Texas Tech to say the least. Tech's rushing defense is ranked last in the conference, allowing 296 yards per game, including a 405-yard, 7 touchdown rushing performance last week against Oklahoma. -- Michael DuPont\n7. Rice, 64 points Rice Owls (4-3, 2-1 C-USA) / Defeated Army, 38-31 / Next: vs. Louisiana Tech, 8 p.m. Friday in Houston\nDriphus Jackson hooked up with Zach Wright on a 13-yard touchdown to put the Owls out in front over the Black Knights for good in a 38-31 victory. The win puts Rice back over the .500 mark, andis the 14th victory in the last 16 attempts for the Owls at Rice Stadium. After Army tied the game 31-31 with a field goal, Jackson led a seven play drive ending in the game winning TD. The senior was 20-of-30 for 267 yards and two touchdowns on the evening. -- Brandon Wheeland\n8. UTEP, 45 points UTEP / Beat FAU 27-17 on Oct. 24 / Next: at Southern Mississippi at 1:30 p.m. Saturday at M.M Roberts Stadium in Hattiesburg, Miss.\nUTEP picked up a hard-fought win over FAU after it scored 13 unanswered points in the second half to pick up a much-needed third win and first Conference USA win. Quarterback Mark Leftwich threw for 271 yards and three touchdowns, which running backs LaQuintus Dowell and Jeremiah Laufasa combined for 144 yards. It's encouraging to see UTEP find a consistent offensive performance, perhaps the first since Aaron Jones went out. -- Shehan Jeyarajah\n9. SMU, 43 points SMU (1-6, 0-3 AAC) / Loss to South Florida, 38-14 / Next: vs. Tulsa, 3 p.m. Saturday\nAfter a what seemed to be a much-needed by week, SMU came out flat against South Florida and played arguably its worst football of the season. The Mustangs let South Florida quarterback Quinton Flowers rush for more than 200 yards and couldn't generate anything offensively. Tulsa is obviously a must-win game, but it looks like the Mustangs have lost the fight they had earlier in the year. The near comeback against TCU seems like years ago. -- E.J. Holland\nT-10. Texas State, 34 points Texas State (2-4, 1-1 Sun Belt) / Defeated South Alabama, 36-18 / Next: at Georgia Southern, 7:30 p.m., Thursday in Statesboro, Ga.\nThe Bobcats got a much-needed win with a 36-18 victory over South Alabama. Texas State had a big night rushing. Senior running back Robert Lowe scored three touchdowns and ran for 248 yards on 30 carries against the Jaguars. Junior quarterback Tyler Jones ran for 71 yards and a touchdown, Saturday. The Bobcats will have a short week as they play Georgia Southern on Thursday.Texas State will try and build off its win over South Alabama against the Eagles. -- Nick Castillo\nT-10. UTSA, 34 points UTSA (1-6, 1-2 C-USA) / Last: Bye / Next: at North Texas, Saturday in Denton\nThe Roadrunners are poised to win their first game in four weeks against North Texas on Saturday. UTSA enters this week's matchup following a 25-6 win over UTEP, back-to-back losses and a humbling week to regroup. Comparatively, the Mean Green are winless this year and fired former head coach Dan McCarney five games into the season following a 66-7 homecoming loss to Portland State. Considering UNT was nearly shutout by an FCS opponent, this is likely the least difficult game on UTSA's schedule. -- Michael DuPont\n12. North Texas, 11 points North Texas (0-7, 0-4 Conference USA) / Lost to Marshall, 30-13 / Next: vs. Texas-San Antonio, 6 p.m. Saturday in Denton\nNorth Texas' season continued to spiral downhill in a 30-13 loss to Marshall on Saturday that wasn't as close as the score indicated. The Mean Green are 0-7, are officially out of bowl contention and have lost eight straight dating back to last season. UNT will host bitter rival UTSA on Saturday. The Mean Green have lost both of their previous meetings with the Roadrunners. -- Brett Vito\nOn Twitter:\n @SportsDayDFW", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/SportsDayDFW", "http://beta.sportsdaydfw.com/college-sports/collegesheadlines/2015/10/25/best-texas-breakdown-1026-texas-tech-leapfrogged-houston-surging-longhorns"], "published": "2015-10-26T05:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:22:25.121+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
