(AP Photo/Jack Dempsey) \nENGLEWOOD, Colo. (AP) — Left tackle Ty Sambrailo will miss his second straight game when the Denver Broncos play Oakland on Sunday \nThe Broncos (4-0) will go with the same O-line they had last week against Minnesota, with right tackle Ryan Harris moving over to protect Peyton Manning’s blindside and Michael Schofield replacing Harris on the right side. \nLeft guard Evan Mathis missed two practices this week with a sore hamstring and is questionable against the Raiders (2-2), although coach Gary Kubiak said he expects him to play. \nEither way, Kubiak said he will rotate rookie guard Max Garcia and newly signed veteran tackle Tyler Polumbus into the lineup to keep his battered line fresher. \nAlso, defensive end Derek Wolfe returns from his four-game suspension this weekend. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T22:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:35:18.756+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
