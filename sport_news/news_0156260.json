Lee/The Boston Globe The Beachcomber in Quincy—not to be confused with the club in Wellfleet of the same name— officially closed its doors on Saturday night. It had been in business since 1959.\nTo go out in style, the club welcomed Boston’s own Dropkick Murphys to play the final set.\nAfter announcing the show last week, the club sold 150 tickets online and sold another 100 at the club on the day of the show. The band’s set was a collection of originals and covers (including a relevant and obligatory “Dirty Water”).\nThe band kicked off the show with a moment of silence for the club, followed by a recorded introduction from club founder Jimmy McGettrick, who passed away four years ago. From there, they ripped into a version of “T.N.T.” by Aussie rockers AC/DC.\nWatch it go down:\nShare 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement Music Kiss108’s Jingle Ball 2015 lineup: The Weeknd and a Jonas Brother are just the beginning 10.05.15 | 3:57 PM Entertainment Watch this man re-enact all of Breaking Bad as a one-hour show tomorrow in Somerville 10.05.15 | 2:25 PM Entertainment Watch the Dropkick Murphys close down The Beachcomber in style 10.05.15 | 1:12 PM TV A breakdown of The Leftovers opening scene no one expected 10.05.15 | 11:47 AM TV Hillary Clinton served up cocktails, killer Donald Trump impression as bartender named Val on SNL 10.04.15 | 11:55 AM Movies The Martian works because it makes science sexy 10.03.15 | 4:06 PM Events HUBweek starts Saturday.
