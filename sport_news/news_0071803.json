Mo. — Tim Naehring is going to fill the vacancy created when Billy Eppler left, but won’t have the title of assistant general manager attached to his name.\nThe Post’s Joel Sherman confirmed Naehring replacing Eppler, the former assistant GM who was hired by the Angels to be their GM.\nEppler’s title was VP, assistant GM with a heavy emphasis on professional scouting.\nHired by the Yankees in 2007 as a scout, Naehring has been one of GM Brian Cashman’s most trusted advisors on players the Yankees look to trade for or sign as free agents.\nIt was Naehring who recommended the Yankees acquire shortstop Didi Gregorius from the Diamondbacks, and after a slow start, Gregorius turned into a nice fit as Derek Jeter’s replacement.\nOften times other organizations see Naehring at a game and conclude the Yankees are interested in somebody involved in the game.\nThere was some talk around the Angels that Eppler was going to take Jay Darnell and Naehring to Anaheim with him, but they were under contract to the Yankees.\nNaehring, 48, played eight seasons in the big leagues with the Red Sox from 1990-97. He retired at 30 years old because of injury.\nAfter retiring, he joined the Reds as director of player development and later served as minor league field coordinator. He was let go in 2007 when the Reds underwent a massive shakeup.\nWhen Eppler left, Naehring’s name immediately surfaced as a replacement. So, too, did Kevin Reese, a former Yankees outfielder who served as director of professional scouting this past year.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brian cashman ,  new york yankees", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T13:53:09.685+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
