The 31-year-old shooting guard faces misdemeanor charges for resisting arrest and obstructing the administration of government. The charges stem from Sefolosha’s early-morning altercation with New York City police officers outside the Manhattan nightclub “1 OAK” on Apr. 8. Six jurors have been empaneled to hear radically different portrayals about what took place.\nAccording to the New York County District Attorney’s Office and the NYPD, Sefolosha intentionally interfered with a police investigation into the stabbing of Indiana Pacers forward Chris Copeland , who, along with a companion, had been attacked outside the nightclub (the alleged assailant, Shevoy Bleary Murdock, was later charged with felony assault). At the time, Sefolosha was standing with teammate Pero Antic near where the stabbing occurred. Prosecutors insist that Sefolosha refused multiple requests by officer JohnPaul Giacona to move so the officers could locate evidence and conduct witness interviews. In purportedly refusing to comply, the 6’7\" Sefolosha also allegedly insulted the 5’7\" Giancona by calling him a “midget.” Police also say Sefolosha made aggressive movements in the direction of another officer, Daniel Dongvort. On Tuesday, Giacona testified that after observing Sefolosha’s allegedly antagonistic behavior and hostile interactions, he had no choice but to place Sefolosha in handcuffs. Assistant District Attorney Jesse Matthews describes Sefolosha—who according to Basketball-Reference.com has earned $26 million during his NBA career—as displaying “a sense of entitlement and disdain” in his interactions with the police officers investigating a crime scene.\nNBA Video Roundtable: Which NBA star is under the most pressure this season? by SI.com Staff", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/McCannSportsLaw", "http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/s/sefolth01.html"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:59:30.844+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
