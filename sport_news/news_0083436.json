By Latifah Muhammad Filed Under Gloria Govan , New York Knicks , Memphis Grizzlies , matt barnes , Sports News , Derek Fisher \nMatt Barnes says he’s not “some maniac driving 95 miles listening to Tupac to go beat somebody up.” \nThe Memphis Grizzlies forward responded to the reported altercation with former teammate Derrick Fisher for allegedly dating his estranged wife, Gloria Govan . \nAccording to Barnes, he was at his home near Los Angeles when he went to Govan’s residence, to check on his children. Barnes says he received a text message from one of his twins late that night. \"’I’m like, 'First of all, why are you still up? It's like 10 o'clock at night?' So I text back, 'I love you and I miss you, too,’” he told ESPN Thursday. “Then I FaceTimed him. I'm just like, 'Hey, what's up buddy?' \n“Carter is like the rambunctious one,\" Barnes continued. “He's always jumping off the walls, and when I saw his face, he was just sitting there and I knew something was wrong. I was like, 'What's wrong, Carter?' And he shook his head, 'No.' Then he lays his head down on the couch, puts a pillow in front of his face and says, 'Mommy's friend Derek is here.'\" \nHe added, “I live 15 minutes away and I was going over to check on my kids because they seemed uncomfortable. That was my main reason for going over there.” \nTMZ Sports reported that the New York Knicks coach won’t press charges against Barnes. Fisher, who has no visible bruises or scratches, refused to address the rumored scuffle. ”Personal and private matters will remain private,” he said. \nGovan and Fisher have been dating for “a few months,” according to a Bleacher Report source. \nBET Sports News — Get the latest news and information about African-Americans in sports, including weekly recaps, celebrity news and photos of your favorite Black athletes.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:19:39.167+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
