The main question for the court Tuesday was whether that decision in Miller v. Alabama should be extended retroactively to Montgomery and hundreds of other inmates whose convictions are final.\nIn the 5-4 decision in 2012, Justice Elena Kagan wrote for the majority that judges weighing prison terms for young offenders must take into account \"the mitigating qualities of youth,\" among them immaturity and the failure to understand fully the consequences of their actions.\nS. Kyle Duncan, arguing on behalf of the state of Louisiana, said the Alabama decision doesn't qualify as an extraordinary ruling that should be extended to older cases because it left open the imposition of life without parole for people under 18 if courts take account of a defendant's circumstances.\n\"In Miller this court was invited to categorically bar the penalty of life without parole for juveniles who commit murder, but it decided not to do so,\" Duncan said.\nKagan disagreed about the significance of the Alabama decision, noting that courts now have to consider less severe punishments. \"What the court has done is to say, there have to be other options,\" she said.\nIf the court says it should not have taken up Montgomery's case, others are waiting, including one from Virginia. The inmate in that case, Shermaine Ali Johnson, was 16 years old when he raped and killed a woman in 1994.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
