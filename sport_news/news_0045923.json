It really got the fans going quickly and the students going quickly. It was a pretty quick hit.” \nThe idea started with an email that Brown received from a fan during the first week of September. Director of fan experience Rob Roselli worked out the specific concept. \n“He linked me the song,” said Brown, who is part of the Rutgers Fan Advisory Board, “and the email literally said, ‘You’ve got to play this at the stadium. The students will go nuts.’” \nSure enough, Rutgers filmed groups of students pounding their chest at various spots around campus as part of the video. A handful of football players also are seen in the footage. \nShort snippets (like the one above) of the longer video have been teased out through the athletic department’s social media channels. It was played on the stadium’s video board three times last home game. \n“It’s something easy for the students to get into and make some noise,” Brown said. “Now it’s just take it and run with it.” \nSyracuse also began using \"The Hum\" as part of its crowd hype at the start of this season. \nWithin the Big Ten, Wisconsin is famous for its crowd making stadium-rattling noise to the song \"Jump Around\" at the start of the fourth quarter. \nIf the scene Rutgers wants to depict sounds familiar, it’s because it’s a spin-off on a scene from the movie “Wolf of Wall Street,” when Matthew McConaughey is explaining the wild lifestyle he leads to Leonardo DiCaprio. \n“I know Matthew is a big football fan,” Flood said. “I think he is a Texas fan. But I’ll put it out there right now: If Matthew wants to come to the game, I’ll take care of him.” \nFlood is urging fans to be in their seats early. \n“The importance of being there early is I think it energizes the stadium, which ultimately energizes the football team,” he said. \n“I know there is no question that it raises the emotional level of our players when they are out there in warm-ups. The student section has done such a great job of becoming a force within the game. When the game starts, we want them to be warmed up too.” \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com 45 CONNECT 36 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1LSCPk6 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T05:37:05.654+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
