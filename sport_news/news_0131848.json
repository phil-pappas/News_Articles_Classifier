Campbell, representing the Cambridge Boat Club, wound up third behind runner-up John Graves of the Craftsbury Sculling Center (Vt.).\nThe 36-year-old, 6-foot-6 Drysdale, representing the West End Boat Club, clocked 18:11.96. Graves crossed in 18:16.95, while Campbell finished in 18:25.14, well off his 17:11.6 pace of last year as the rowers faced gusty winds from the west that made keeping the boat in line a virtual magical trick.\n“With these conditions, the deck was definitely stacked against me,’’ said Campbell. “But it was a good race. I’m proud of it, I gave it my all, I tried to win.”\nThere was far less drama on the women’s side where local hero and London Olympian Gevvie Stone captured her second straight and sixth overall title with another strong performance. Stone, a Newton native, won in 19:43.07, slowest of her six HOCR championship victories.\nThe popular tandem of Linda Muri and C.B. Sands-Bohrer of Concord successfully defended their title in the senior masters women’s doubles. Muri, a cancer survivor, is an 18-time national champion and three-time world champion and previously coach at Harvard for 13 years. Bohrer, who is married to Boston University crew coach Tom Bohrer , is a former two-time world champion in doubles sculls. Both women represent the Cambridge Boat Club and received a hearty cheer from the spectators.\n“It was a really good row,’’ said Muri, the current coach at Dartmouth. “We got ahead and then they closed. But we had a very solid middle mile. We were solid there. I steered probably my best course. The buoys are really nice.’’\nAdded Sands-Bohrer: “A lot of boats were struggling with the wind. You were kind of skidding sideways. But if you knew the course, you knew that and when it was coming.’’\nThe duo had only four practice rows together on the course leading up to yesterday’s win. They set the record of 19:17.9 in last year’s event with an emotional victory with Muri still recovering from cancer treatment.\nMen in blue\nThe inaugural effort by the Massachusetts State Police in the men’s club fours was solid as the quartet of troopers Pat Mahady , Patrick Moynihan , Sean Maloney and Matt Davis wowed the crowds, who responded with raucous cheers. The MSP rowers, in some instances, were giving up more than a decade to their younger competitors and have less training time than their year-round foes, many of them owning international experience.\nThe Fab Four, who had 18-year-old Noble & Greenough senior Inna Oh as coxswain, finished the arduous three-mile course in 23:27.16, behind race winner Union Boat Club, timed in 16:54:54.\n“It was good. We’re excited about what we did,’’ said Mahady, a former Northeastern letter winner in crew. “Up by the BU Bridge it was really windy, then there was a lull, and then we had some pretty good gusts. All in all, everyone is exhausted but excited. We’re hoping it raises enough awareness to continue in the future.’’\nOne busy exec\nExecutive director Fred Schoch is doing it all this weekend, rowing in three events on top of his administrative duties. The first of the trey was in the senior masters eights, where he teamed with his Cambridge Boat club pals on Team Attenger. The boat finished second with a time of 17:26.36, almost six seconds behind the 1980 Rowing Club, a boat made up of hard-luck rowers from the would-be 1980 U.S. Olympic team.\n“Huffing and puffing,’’ quipped Schoch, who is also celebrating his 25th year of heading the Head. “We got second in the grand masters division so the 1980 (crew) finally got redemption on us after all these years. … Not a bad performance, just not a winning one.’’\nTeam Attenger set the grand masters course record in winning last year with a time of 16:30.06. The crew is comprised of John Van Blom , Charlie Hamlin , Roger Borrggaard , Dan Johnson , Schoch, Nik Jurmakov , Roman Lesnau , Chuck Pieper and coxswain Dick Grossman .\n“The conditions were challenging,” Schoch said. “It’s a west wind gusting pretty hard so going toward any of the bridges that were aligned with the westerly direction blew you sideways right into a headwind. So, going through the BU Bridge, going through Weeks Bridge, they were tough, especially the last quarter-mile. It was right into it.’’ . . .\nThe senior masters (50-and-up) event was captured by Molesey in 16:14.12 after closing hard to catch pace-setter Marin Boat Club (16:17.12).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:29:00.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
