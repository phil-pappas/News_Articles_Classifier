Comment Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 1:16 AM Updated at 1:19 AM Posted Oct. 8, 2015 at 1:16 AM Updated at 1:19 AM FOXBORO – Pardon Patriots players if they play the part of tourists early Sunday afternoon. The team, after all, has never been to “Jerry’s World”– AT&T Stadium, the $1.15 billion stadium in Arlington, Texas, that’s been home to Jerry Jones’ Dallas Cowboys since 2009. “This stadium for me is like a bucket-list stadium. I haven’t played there,” said Patriots defensive end Rob Ninkovich, whose team plays at Dallas in a 4:25 p.m. (Eastern Time) start on Sunday. “You just hear good things about it. Obviously, (it’s) a state-of-the-art stadium, so I look forward to playing there.” The last time the Patriots played the Cowboys in the “Lone Star State”– a 48-27 romp that occurred during their pursuit of perfection eight years ago – Texas Stadium was still standing. The Patriots haven’t even faced the Cowboys since 2011. How long ago was that? Tom Brady’s 8-yard touchdown pass to Aaron Hernandez with 22 seconds to play lifted them to a 20-16 win at Gillette Stadium. “I don’t have a lot of experience playing against this team. It’s only my second time playing them in my career,” special teams captain Matthew Slater, a Patriot since 2008, said. “But obviously the tradition: ‘America’s Team.’ I think most of my family’s Cowboys fans and I understand that, I respect that and what that franchise has been able to do, but all that doesn’t really mean much to us. We just have to prepare for Sunday’s game and go out and try to execute on Sunday.” A week’s worth of film work will help the Patriots get acquainted with the Cowboys; the team’s first look at the stadium won’t really come until the team buses pull into 1 AT&T Way on Sunday. “In this case it’s new,” Patriots head coach Bill Belichick said. “We went through it last year when we played at Minnesota (a 30-7 win at TCF Bank Stadium). It was a new venue, too, so it comes up from time to time.” At this stage of the game – 16 years in the league – it doesn’t often come up for Tom Brady, but Sunday will be a first for him as well. “You try to study what you can on tape and see how the other quarterbacks kind of adjust, maybe some of their rhythms and mannerisms,” said Brady. “It is a little different for me not playing in a place where I’ve played before. A lot of environments I kind of know what I’m getting myself into. I know where the clocks are. Page 2 of 2 - “So this will take a little bit of time. (I’ll) get out there a little earlier and kind of get a feel for things. But I’m excited. I’ve heard a lot of great things about this stadium, so it’ll be fun playing there.” For punter Ryan Allen, it can mean added work. “It’s important to know (where) the 40-second clock (is) in terms of running a unit, whether that’s field goal and knowing how much time, whether we’re a little late getting out there,” said Allen, who also serves as Stephen Gostkowski’s holder on placement kicks. “I think it’s just smart to know where that stuff is. That’s just game management basically and having a good understanding of that can definitely help.” Ultimately, though, it will all come down to what the numbers on the scoreboard say at game’s end. “I think during the warm-up time we just go out there and familiarize ourselves with the field and the surroundings, but at the end of the day it’s football,” said Slater. “The field’s the same length, the same width. You’ve got to go out there and play at a high level.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T09:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:18:22.643+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
