Josh Holmberg/Las Vegas Review-Journal By Damon Seiters \nHere's a look at what happened during Week 7 of the high school football season. \nWHAT WE LEARNED \n1. This week's schedule was really, really bad. Of games featuring Division I or I-A teams, only one (Cheyenne at Mojave) had two teams with winning records. \nOnly Basic at Green Valley featured two ranked teams, and one of those came in with a losing record. Only three games were decided by fewer than 24 points, and the average margin of victory was 33.2 \nYuck. Next week has to be better, right? \n2. Bishop Gorman vs. Southwest League is a joke. We knew that already, but the Gaels 69-7 thumping of Durango just points out the disparity in the league. \nGorman is 7-0 and ranked No. 1 in the nation by USA Today. The rest of the league is a combined 4-22, with two of those wins coming in league play. \nThe Gaels have now beaten their two league foes by a combined 139-14, and the real surprise is that they've given up the 14. Last year Gorman outscored its four league opponents 238-13. \n3. The Henderson Bowl is a really good rivalry, and it was probably the best game of the night. The stands were full, the game was close and wasn't really decided until the final whistle. \nGreen Valley is a difficult team to figure out. A week after giving up 381 rushing yards in the first half against Liberty, the Gators stuffed Basic's inside running attack, and the Wolves never got any rhythm on offense. \nBut Basic did get some big performances on defense, with Deondre Ishman changing the game with a fourth-quarter interception. The Wolves also forced two fumbles, stuffed a pair of short-yardage plays to get a turnover on downs and got an interception from John Funaki to seal the win as time expired. \nUPSET OF THE WEEK \nSunrise Mountain 34, Rancho 27 — This probably doesn't qualify as a true upset, as the Miners came in with the better record and were playing at home. But Sunrise Mountain improving to 5-2 is a real surprise, and something the team deserves some credit for. \nThe Miners had never won more than two games in a season before this year, and they look like a real contender for a playoff berth in the Sunrise Region. \nSunrise Mountain, which had never won a league game before this season, sits in fourth place in the league at 2-2, and if the season ended today, the Miners would get the league's final playoff berth. \nTOP PERFORMERS \nTanner Otteson, Tonopah — 14-24 passing, 348 yards, 6 TDs \nAndrew Solis, Chaparral — 7-10 passing, 250 yards, 5 TDs \nJamaal Evans, Centennial — 13-18 passing, 242 yards, 3 TDs \nKenyon Oblad, Liberty — 12-25 passing, 207 yards, 1 TD \nGregory Castenada, Western — 15-27 passing, 193 yards, 1 TD \nDeven Dabbs, Eldorado — 15-30 passing, 192 yards \nRushing \nDavid Walker, Cheyenne — 22 carries, 205 yards \nJustice Jackson, Foothill — 13 carries, 191 yards, 3 TDs \nChristian Marshall, Faith Lutheran — 10 carries, 164 yards, 3 TDs \nClaude Moore, Sunrise Mountain — 31 carries, 158 yards, 1 TD \nStephan LauShaul, Agassi Prep — 20 carries, 157 yards, 4 TDs \nTy'shun McClinton, Desert Oasis — 21 carries, 153 yards, 4 TDs \nReceiving \nAmir Boone, Clark — 8 catches, 163 yards, 2 TDs \nR.J.

It was something awesome to see.\" \n— Basic coach Jeff Cahill after his team beat rival Green Valley 26-21 to claim the Henderson Bowl trophy. The Gators had won the previous three meetings. \n\"We came out and executed and did what the coaches asked us to do. We didn't overthink it and we came out and competed.\" \n— Cheyenne junior defensive back Deriontae Green, who intercepted two passes to help the Desert Shields to a 28-0 win over Mojave to take control of second place in the Sunset Legaue. \n\"That wasn't a bad night for Justice. He's been a workhorse for us all year, and he just gets better and better.\" \n— Foothill coach Marty Redmond on senior running back Justice Jackson, who rushed for 191 yards and three TDs on 13 carries in a 48-7 road win at Eldorado. \n\"I'm so happy right now — five wins and our first homecoming win. I am so tired, and my voice is gone because I've been yelling so much. For this program, this is a big step. I love my team.\" \n— Sunrise Mountain running back Claude Moore, who rushed for 158 yards and had the go-ahead touchdown in a 34-27 win over Rancho to improve to 5-2. \n\"The way we started out was my fault. I was making the wrong reads. Everybody else was doing their jobs and I wasn't getting the job done.\" \n— Liberty sophomore quarterback Kenyon Oblad after the Patriots started slowly, leading 11-0 at halftime before rolling to a 39-0 win over Canyon Springs. \nHOW THEY FARED \nA look at how the top 10 teams in the Southern Nevada Football Coaches Poll fared in Week 6. \n1.
