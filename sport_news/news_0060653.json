He, along with a partner and an agreement with the Chinese government, started the Heineken Open, an ATP 250-level tournament.\n“We started with modest expectations,” Smith says from Shanghai. “The government liked it.”\nThe government liked it so much—coupled with the success of the Masters Cup, now the Barclays ATP World Tour Finals, hosted in Shanghai in 2002 and again between 2005 and 2008—that the Chinese committed to build the Qi Zhong Forest Sports City Arena center, which opened in 2005. Fast forward to 2015 and the Shanghai Rolex Masters—an ATP Masters 1000 event held in a retractable-roof stadium court with more than 14,000 seats—is in its sixth year and serves as the main feature of a growing tennis center.\nPhoto: Kevin Lee/Getty Images The Qi Zhong tennis center serves as one of the most recognizable sites outside of tennis’ Grand Slam locations with one of the first retractable roofs in the sport. “We had realized very early on that you couldn’t build a stadium that doesn’t have a retractable roof,” Smith says. “Shanghai and China can get different weather and we had had experience with rain.” In fact, the first three years of the initial tournament had the finals pushed back a day due to weather.\nWhile the retractable roof idea is now a popular feature in tennis stadiums around the world, Shanghai took its roof to the next level. The hard court stadium has an eight-piece retractable roof in the shape of a magnolia flower, the symbol of the city. The roof stands as the centerpiece of a trio of stadiums that includes the 14,000-seat center court, a 5,500-seat open-air grandstand court built in 2011 and a third, 1,500-seat stadium. With an additional four match courts, each with between 400 and 800 seats, plus six indoor courts and 12 practice courts, the Qi Zhong center has a total of 25 courts.\nTennis Federer upset in opening match at Shanghai Masters", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/tdnewcomb"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:27:45.798+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
