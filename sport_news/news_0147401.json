He even compared the pressure ahead to a walk in the park. \nWin at Dover and the back-to-back bid is alive. Fall short, and Harvick likely could be relegated to a spoiler role for the rest of NASCAR’s playoffs. \nHarvick has two wins and a series-best 18 top fives, but is mired at 15th in the 16-driver Chase for the Sprint Cup championship field. The Stewart-Haas Racing driver has gone from boom to bust in the Chase, finishing 42nd in the Chase opener at Chicagoland and 21st last week at New Hampshire. \nAhead is the concrete mile track at Dover where Harvick is 0-for-29. \n“I like these types of situations,” Harvick said Thursday. “I think they’re different and fun and it’s all in the approach and how you react to them.” \nHarvick has had the No. 4 Chevy up against the wall before — he was eighth out of eight teams and had to win last season at Phoenix International Raceway to advance into the championship finale. He won the race, then won it all the next week when his second straight checkered flag gave him the highest finish among four championship drivers to earn the crown. \nUnder NASCAR’s playoff format, the bottom four drivers in the Chase field are eliminated after Dover. He’ll earn an automatic berth into the championship round with a victory. \nJoe Gibbs Racing drivers Denny Hamlin and Matt Kenseth have secured the first two spots. \nIt was only three weeks ago when a confident Harvick said of the JGR drivers, “We’re going to pound them into the ground.” \nSo far Harvick has taken a beating on the track, and dished one out in the motorhome. Harvick was unwilling on Thursday to discuss if he’s talked with Jimmie Johnson in the wake of their post-race skirmish at Chicagoland. \nKyle Busch, Paul Menard, Harvick and Clint Bowyer are the final four drivers on the brink of elimination. They would advance with a victory, but Johnson stands at the No. 1 contender in their way at Dover, where he has a track-record 10 victories. \nHarvick was runner-up to Johnson in May in the first Dover race. Good, though probably not good enough on Sunday. \nThe surprise isn’t that Harvick is in this precarious position because poor finishes can happen to any driver. \n“I know the Gibbs guys are fast, but watching practice, he’s really embarrassing the (heck) out of everybody,” Chase driver Dale Earnhardt Jr. said Thursday. “It’s going to be a shame more than anything because he’s got the potential to win the whole thing.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:10:45.330+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
