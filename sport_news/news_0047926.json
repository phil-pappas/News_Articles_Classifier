One that showed this Bengals team is indeed in a different class. \nThe Bengals remained unbeaten by matching the second-biggest comeback in their history on Sunday, this one against the two-time defending NFC champions.

Nugent tied it with a 31-yard field goal on the final play of regulation.

Nugent's deflection off the upright ended it with 3:36 left in overtime, leaving Cincinnati 5-0 for the first time since 1988, the last time it went to the Super Bowl. \nIt was the second time Cincinnati had overtime a 17-point deficit in the fourth quarter and won, according to STATS. The Bengals also did it at Baltimore in 2004 for a 27-26 victory. Cincinnati overcame an 18-point deficit to beat Arizona 24-21 in the 1997 season. \nThe 17-point collapse matched the biggest in Seattle history. The Seahawks also blew such games in 2003 against Baltimore and 2004 against St. Louis, losing in overtime as well.

(AP Photo/Frank Victores) \nThe Seahawks looked to be in good shape after scoring a pair touchdowns during a 2-minute span of the third quarter. Undrafted rookie running back Thomas Rawls ran 69 yards for a touchdown, part of a career-best 169-yard game. \nBobby Wagner then returned a fumble 23 yards for a touchdown, handing a 24-7 lead to the NFL's second-ranked defense. Unlike Monday night, when Kam Chancellor stripped the ball from Detroit's Calvin Johnson to preserve a 13-10 win, it couldn't come up with the big play at the end. \nDalton was 30 of 44 for 331 yards with two touchdowns, an interception and a season-high four sacks. His 11-yard TD pass to Eifert on the game's opening drive ended Seattle's streak of 20 defensive possessions without allowing a touchdown.

His 30-yard pass to Jermaine Kearse was the first touchdown the Bengals had allowed before halftime this season. \n___ Seattle Seahawks running back Thomas Rawls (34) celebrates his touchdown with wide receiver Tyler Lockett, left, in the second half of an NFL football game against the Cincinnati Bengals, Sunday, Oct. 11, 2015, in Cincinnati.
