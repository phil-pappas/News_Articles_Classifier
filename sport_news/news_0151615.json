The only relative stat would be that NCState beat EKU 35-0, although that is not the point of this post, just an interesting tidbit. What I would like to make a point of in this post, however, is that what I saw out of Louisville’s play vs NCState is that if we’re talking like we’re wanting to chalk this one up as an “easy win”, then the next day is going to be a sad day to be a Cats fan. If we play as flat vs UL as we did vs EKU, it’ll be another UL win again this year.

If not, then I assume you feel Pitino should also have no liability in this issue. ukjaybrat October 5, 2015 at 11:11 am | Permalink \nNo I am saying that Louisville fans will absolutely use a double standard when it comes to this. \nBut to answer your question more specifically. I think What Rose did was not under Cal’s control. He may or may not have cheated on his SAT, that fact was never proven. And he was not told before the season started that he would be ineligible. It wasn’t until after the season that Rose was found to be ineligible. So none of that had anything to do with Cal, that sucks. \nAnd the in Camby situation, Cal found out what happened and turned himself in. Anyone that would cheat just to turn himself in is just dumb. \nThis situation isn’t somebody cheating on a test or taking money from a recruit. This is underage kids having sex and drinking “IN THE DORMS.” I don’t care if he knew or not, what happens in your players dorms *should* be your responsibility. If it happened in a dirty hotel off campus, that’s not something you can really police. But in the dorm?

Pitino was personally implicated. Look it up if you don’t believe me. \nCoack K, Dean Smith, and Roy Williams are all considered to be great coaches and not at all dirty, but that’s mostly because the NCAA refuses to really investigate allegations at Duke or UNC. Corey Maggette took money from a booster and Lance Thomas paid $30,000 in cash for jewelry at Duke, but nothing happened because the NCAA doesn’t want to tarnish Coach K’s image. UNC committed 18 years of mass scale academic fraud, and nothing is being done. The NCAA picks and chooses what to enforce.

Pitino will probably get another raise and Jurich might get a statue in his honor. Matt is talking about the “standards” in Louisville. Everything we’ve seen happen up there the last 10 years would leave you to believe that there are zero ethics. There isn’t much of a reputation to protect at this point and they pretty much made a statement that nothing matters except winning when they brought back Bobby Petrino after everything he had done. \nHeck, they probably will just make an athletics department rule that all hookers need to be taken off campus and paid for in cash after this. It SOUNDS ridiculous but I think all of us that have watched this circus know there is some truth to that. I don’t think it will bother them to be a laughing stock nationally as much as losing games would.

I’ve taught ethics at a Christian university before, and what Matt doesn’t understand is when it is taught from a purely secular perspective (such as at a state university), one man’s opinion is basically considered as good as another’s. It is taught as being subjective and relativist. That’s why an ethics professor at a state school can look at hiring Petrino as being fine. houndstooth October 5, 2015 at 11:23 am | Permalink \nThe problem is people confuse an ethical person with a moral person.
