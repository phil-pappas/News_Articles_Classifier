Comment Posted Oct. 11, 2015 at 6:11 PM By Julie Sherwood Posted Oct. 11, 2015 at 6:11 PM Sally and Pat Littlefield couldn’t have asked for a better preview weekend to their 36th wedding anniversary. The pair from Hilton took in the spectacular views, foods, and events Sunday at the Bristol Mountain ’s annual fall festival. Sally said they also hiked up to the summit of the mountain to take in a view of the Bristol Hills, still full of green but beginning to sport their fall colors. The Littlefields were among hundreds of people who turned out for the festival that included chairlift Sky Rides up and down the mountain and a slew of fun events and vendors. Live music, food trucks, craft vendors, animals and tents with vendors of wine, beer and spirits made something for everyone. The newest attraction, Bubble Ball Extreme, gave kids wild rides rolling around in big rubber balls. Kevin Willard of Victor had a blast refereeing his son, Alex, 9, who couldn’t get enough of the sport. Alex “is on the freestyle team here,” said Kevin. So his son feels right at home on the mountain and not shy about trying Bubble Ball, he said. Managing Bubble Ball Extreme was Mark Constantino, a 2002 Canandaigua Academy grad now from Rochester who enjoyed being back in his home territory introducing the event for the first time at Bristol Mountain’s fall fest. Nicolette and Neil Reidy of Webster brought their son, Cole, 2, to the festival. It was the family’s first time and they didn’t think it would be their last. They enjoyed all the activities, they said. Their favorite: “The chairlift was amazing,” said Nicolette. Bristol Mountain continues offering its Sky Rides on Columbus Day, Oct. 12, and on Saturdays and Sundays through October 25, from 12-4 p.m. For more information, email fun@bristolmt.com or call (585)-374-6000.
