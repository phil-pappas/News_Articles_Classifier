We routinely see plays at second base similar to this one that have not resulted in suspensions. Chase feels terrible about Ruben Tejada’s injury and everyone who knows him knows that he would never intentionally hurt anybody. We will be appealing this\nsuspension immediately.”\nAfter the suspension was announced, Torre appeared on Fox Sports' broadcast of the Texas-Toronto AL Division Series game from Arlington and said Utley's slide went beyond normal aggressive play.\n\"It was really based on the fact that he slid very late and he hit Tejada and the ground at the same time,\" Torre said. \"When you're targeting the player...He certainly didn't want to hurt him. He was just trying to break up a double play. I thought this was a bit much.\"\nCertainly, Utley's appeal will be grounded in the fact players have avoided suspensions for similar - or even more malicious - slides. Torre sounds intent on establishing a new precedent, even as MLB and the union hammer out rule modifications to protect middle infielders.\n\"I can't worry about what's happened in the past,\" he said of Utley's appeal. \"I just based it on what I say and that we're trying to have rules that are going to keep these players on the field. It's unfortunate; Chase Utley is a great player.\n\"He's always played hard. This just happened to have a bad result.\"\nThe series is tied 1-1 with Games 3 and 4 in New York.\nContributing: Bob Nightengale\nA hard slide from a Dodgers base runner broke the leg of the New York Mets' shortstop, and the teams disagree if the play crossed the line.
