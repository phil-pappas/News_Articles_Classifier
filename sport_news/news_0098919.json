Join the Conversation Both Teams Played Hard Adam Hunsucker , ahunsucker@thenewsstar.com 1:13 p.m. CDT October 18, 2015 \nTodd Berry’s demeanor matched what one would expect from a coach who just watched his team lose by 45 points. \nIn the wake of a 59-14 loss to Appalachian State Saturday night, the worst loss at Malone Stadium in the FBS era, Berry directed his frustration towards ULM’s schedule. Particularly how it relates to the one the Mountaineers have played. \n“They've had a chance to play some guys, stay healthy and gain confidence. You look at our schedule and it's not like that,” Berry said. \n“Our guys aren’t getting any experience because of who they’re playing early in the season and it’s hurting us. Now all of a sudden you have injuries and those guys haven’t had any playing time to allow them to grow up as players.” \nA decimated group of receivers that's already missing Rashon Ceaser and Tyler Cain was dealt another blow Saturday night when Ajalen Holley left the game during ULM's first possession. The Warhawks have lost three players (Cain, tight end Alec Osborne and running back Nathan Meadors) for the season, while two (Ceaser and defensive end Jacob Tyson) remain out indefinitely. \nThe combined record of ULM’s opponents prior to the Appalachian State game was 20-12 compared to 12-19 for the Mountaineers. \nULM opened the season at Georgia and travelled to no. 10 Alabama three weeks later after hosting FCS Nicholls State. The Warhawks then entered Sun Belt Conference play at home with Georgia Southern and visited Tulsa. \nIn the same stretch, Appalachian State hosted FCS Howard, played at no. 5 Clemson, at Old Dominion, at home against Wyoming and went to Georgia State. \nBerry said the Mountaineers’ schedule, which features only one power-five opponent, not only allowed them to get their younger players more experience, but develop the confidence that comes with winning. \nAppalachian State has won 10 of its last 11 games dating back to 2014 with the only loss being to Clemson. \nULM’s athletic budget is the lowest in the entire FBS and forces the Warhawks into playing a certain number of “money games” against power-five opponents each year to pay the bills. \n“At some point in time you’ve got to address those things because you can’t keep asking these guys to come out and get beat up,” Berry said. “What we’re seeing right now is a function of a lot of that stuff and it disappoints me for the players.” \nFollow Adam on Twitter @adam_hunsucker Read or Share this story: http://tnsne.ws/1LBQlbB Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:13:36.623+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
