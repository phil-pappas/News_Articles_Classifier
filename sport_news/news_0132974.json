However, world football's governing body insisted the ban should be enforced during Brazil next two international matches.\nThe CAS ruling, in favour of FIFA, means that Neymar will miss Brazil's opening qualifier against continental champions Chile on October 8 as well as the visit of Venezuela five days later.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T18:53:23.418+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
