It said her life was not in danger, as did Reker's campaign team.\nFour other people were wounded, one of them seriously, in a scuffle as they tried to overwhelm the suspected attacker, who was then arrested. There was no immediate word on the 44-year-old man's possible motive.\nThe attack happened as Reker was visiting a campaign stand set up by Merkel's Christian Democrats ahead of Sunday's election. Reker, 58, has been the head of the city's social affairs and integration department since 2010.\nOutgoing mayor Juergen Roters said he was \"deeply shocked\" by the attack. Center-left Social Democrat Jochen Ott, Reker's main rival in the election, suspended his campaign.\nCity officials said the election would go ahead as planned.\nAttacks on politicians are rare in Germany but there have been prominent cases.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:02:53.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
