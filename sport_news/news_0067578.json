With help from the Bulldogs’ squandered opportunities, the Eagles escaped with a one-point win and set the county record for consecutive victories. Staff photo by Kelly J. Huff slideshow TRION — Mount Paran Christian used a little luck, a lot of defense and the running of Taylor Trammell to break a 50-year-old Cobb County record with its 7-6 victory at Trion on Friday.Mount Paran committed six personal fouls and was flagged for 17 penalties in all. Trion had the go-ahead 80-yard touchdown pass called back, and it missed a 29-yard go-ahead field goal.In the end, Mount Paran still managed to win its 22nd consecutive game to break the county record set by Marietta over the 1965 and ’66 seasons.“Trion just whipped us (Friday),” said Eagles coach Mitch Jordan, whose team improved to 8-0 overall and 3-0 in Region 6A (A). “We were aware of the record, but it isn’t something that added pressure to us.“However, the record is something that we are real proud of and something that these boys can look back on in 10 or 20 years and it will be very special.”Mount Paran will host Mount Zion-Carroll next week, with a win allowing the Eagles to play for the region championship Nov. 6 against Pinecrest Academy, the top seed from the opposite subregion.Clinging to a 7-6 lead late in the game, Mount Paran dodged several bullets that could have ended its winning streak.Midway through the fourth quarter, Trion (5-3, 1-2) drove 66 yards to the Mount Paran 12-yard line. On fourth down, Jackson Walters missed a 29-yard field goal that would have given the Bulldogs the lead.After forcing the Eagles to punt on their next possession, Trion had the ball at its own 20 with 4:19 remaining, and quarterback Jarrett Gill hit Jarrett Pierce in stride for an apparent 80-yard touchdown.Trion, however, was called for an illegal shift, Mount Paran was called for pass interference and the offsetting penalties wiped out the Bulldogs’ touchdown.Then, with the ball at Trion’s 15 with 1:47 left, Carter Smith sacked Gill to seal the victory.Trion coach Justin Brown found encouragement for his team despite the loss.“That game was an absolute war,” Brown said. “I feel real good about our effort (Friday) against the top team in the state.“They are ranked No. 1 for a reason, but our boys hung in there and played them tough. I think this type of game will really help us as we push for the playoffs.”After a scoreless first quarter, Mount Paran got on the scoreboard when Trammell scored from 2 yards out with 10:25 left in the first half. Jackson McLarty’s extra point gave the Eagles a 7-0 lead.When it looked like Mount Paran would take a 7-0 lead into halftime, Trion struck on a long pass that put the ball at the Eagles’ 2. Gill threw a screen pass to Pierce, who raced 92 yards downfield. Malik Martin then dove in from 2 yards out to cut the Mount Paran lead to 7-6 with 1:08 remaining until halftime. The extra point was no good.Trammell finished with a game-high 131 yards rushing on 24 carries for Mount Paran.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:31:48.141+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
