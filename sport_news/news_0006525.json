Some highlights\nSteve Politi, NJ.com: Real leaders. Inspires a football team. It sure looked as if Hardy was dressing down the Cowboys' special teams players, not firing them up. What a disaster. And, that this all unfolded at MetLife Stadium as the Giants threw a few more cans of gasoline on the fiery wreckage of this Cowboys season, made it easily the sweetest victory for this team in 2015. How could a Giants fan not delight in the unraveling in Dallas?\nJones, the owner and GM, brought that upon his franchise when he signed and enabled Hardy. Now the whole thing is unraveling, and Giants fans were just lucky enough to have a front-row seat for it. It was Harris who, during training camp, described the Cowboys locker room as \"always arguing.\" He said \"in Dallas, it's like an all-out brawl,\" while classifying the atmosphere in Giants camp as more professional. Look: The all-out brawl thing is fine ... when a team is winning. When it's not, you end up with one of the \"real leaders\" blowing up at his teammates on the sidelines in the fourth quarter of a still-winnable game.\nBob Glauber, Newsday : The Giants were fortunate to beat a badly wounded Cowboys team that trotted out its third quarterback of the season Sunday -- a quarterback who wasn't even with the team when Tony Romo suffered a collarbone injury that could turn out to be the undoing of the defending NFC East champions. Matt Cassel was so inept in relief of Brandon Weeden that he threw three interceptions in less than a 15-minute span of the second half -- and still the Giants needed a muffed punt by Cole Beasley at the end to secure the win. But it's going to take more than barely beating a third-string quarterback at home to put the Giants at a level that makes them legitimate playoff contenders, much less Super Bowl candidates.\nBrian Lewis, NY Post: (The headline was \"Cowboys' 'woman-beating' villain turns on own team in tantrum'): The Cowboys coughed up a record-setting game-winning kick return, had their most sure-handed player botch a punt in the waning seconds, and saw the quarterback they traded for to save their season throw three second-half interceptions. But none of that was more shocking than seeing Dallas' Greg Hardy push teammate Devin Street, get tossed out of a special-teams huddle and into a shouting match with injured star receiver Dez Bryant. It was all just part of the Cowboys' three-ring circus, in a 27-20 loss to the Giants before 80,319 at MetLife Stadium.\nRALPH VACCHIANO, NY Daily News: (Last year's Giants), with many of the same players, had no toughness when it mattered. This one does. And what they lack in talent and ability - particularly along the offensive and defensive lines - they make up for with that \"scrappy\" quality they keep proving they have. They say they've had enough of the losing, of the meaningless games late in the season. They want to again be part of a national conversation. That's why this win over the Cowboys, no matter how ugly, no matter how depleted the Cowboys were, was so important. A loss would've felt like the start of a 10-week death march toward another depressing end to the season. A win made all the difference in the world.\nFull coverage: Giants 27, Cowboys 20\nGosselin: New QB Matt Cassel gives Cowboys what they want, but it comes at a price\nMoore: A once promising season continues to slip away for last-place Cowboys\nSturm: Time to panic?
