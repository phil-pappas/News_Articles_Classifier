Newcastle, two places above them, have six. \nNewcastle won for the first time this season when they crushed Norwich City 6-2 on Sunday and McClaren is keen to make it back-to-back wins for the first time in nearly a year. \nBut he told reporters at his pre-match briefing that he was not preparing for the game any differently from any other. \nMcClaren and his assistants moved to Newcastle after the end of last season and he said: “We don’t know anything about the five previous ones and I know half the team probably won’t, either. \n“It’s a fresh game and why should we approach it any differently than we approach Chelsea, Manchester United, Manchester City, Norwich, Watford .... we have to approach every game the same. \n“This game is massive for the fans and I know there is a determination in this club to get that win for the fans.” \nNewcastle crushed Norwich with Giorginio Wijnaldum scoring four times, and Ayoze Perez and Aleksandar Mitrovic adding the others, but McClaren told the fans in his letter no-one was getting carried away by one win. \n“Gigi took most of the plaudits after the game, and rightly so. However, there were still areas we identified that need to be worked on and that’s what we’ve been concentrating on this week on the training pitch,” he said. \nNewcastle last beat Sunderland in August 2011 and in all have gone seven matches without a victory over their neighbours, having drawn the next two before Sunderland’s run of wins began. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T19:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:09:27.799+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
