He was 74. \nThe funeral home handling the arrangements near where he lived in Ohio confirmed Chance died. There were no details on the cause of death. \nChance died two months after being at Angel Stadium in Anaheim, California, for his induction into the Angels Hall of Fame. \nIn 1964, Chance went 20-9 with a 1.65 ERA for the Angels and won the Cy Young — from 1956-66, only one pitcher in the majors won the award each year. \nChance threw a no-hitter for Minnesota in August 1967. Earlier that month, he pitched a five-inning perfect game. \nChance went 128-115 with a 2.92 ERA in 10 seasons. He began with the expansion Los Angeles Angels in 1961 and also pitched for Minnesota, Cleveland, the Mets and Detroit. \nThe two-time All-Star was well known for his exploits off the field, too. With teammate Bo Belinsky, he would pal around Hollywood with the likes of Frank Sinatra and Marilyn Monroe. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T04:42:06.982+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
