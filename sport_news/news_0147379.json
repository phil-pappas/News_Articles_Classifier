(AP Photo/Brandon Wade, File) Article Through four weeks, NFL underdogs have the slight edge IRVING, TEX. - \nDefensive end Greg Hardy joined practice with the Dallas Cowboys on Wednesday, but he already talked his way into a controversy Tuesday while discussing Sunday’s game against the New England Patriots. \nHardy and linebacker Rolando McClain were fresh off their respective four-game suspensions when they suited up for practice Wednesday. McClain was out because of a substance abuse violation. Hardy’s suspension was the result of a domestic violence situation involving his ex-girlfriend. \nAgainst that background, and in an NFL that is approaching zero tolerance level for the appearance of an impropriety, Hardy probably should have stuck to football when he talked to reporters Tuesday. \nInstead, he made a weird comment about quarterback Tom Brady’s wife, supermodel Giselle Bundchen, and her sister and friends. \n“I love seeing Tom Brady, he’s cool as crap,” Hardy said. “Have you seen his wife? I hope she comes to the game. I hope her sister comes to the game, all her friends come to the game. One of my favorite games of the year, guys.” \nAnd when prodded by an equally insensitive remark that Jacksonville quarterback Blake Bortles also had an attractive wife, Hardy took the bait. \n“Is she?” Hardy replied. “This kind of information is important. That’s how I select my Pro Bowls.” \nThe Cowboys said they discussed Hardy’s comments with him on Wednesday. Head coach Jason Garrett said the statements from Hardy were “nothing we want.” \nHardy did not seem to show that his suspension gave him an enlightened perspective. In fact, he hinted that because the domestic violence issue allowed him to sign with the Cowboys, the whole episode was a good one for him. \nBrady was asked about Hardy’s unprofessional remarks on Wednesday. Did it bother him? \n“No, I’m just getting ready to play,” Brady began. “I’m focused on my job. He’s a great player. It takes a lot of different things to handle a guy like that. He’s been a great player since he’s been in the league. We’re going to have to prepare for him and be ready for all the different types of moves that he’s got. They have a good D-line anyway. They count on getting pressure from their front four to get to the quarterback. \n“I don’t really care about his personal feelings.” \nAt the NFL owners meetings in New York, commissioner Roger Goodell was asked about Hardy’s remarks, but replied that he had not yet heard them. \nHardy refused to go into details when asked about a May 2014 domestic violence incident that has kept him out of NFL regular-season games for 14 months. He ended last year on the commissioner’s exempt list and was suspended for the first four games this year. \n“It’s hard to get sacks when you’re not on the football field,” he said when asked about how tough the last year has been. “That’s my main purpose in football, to get back there and get sacks and make a difference on the team, and I wasn’t able to do that. It was a process mentally for myself.” \nHardy deflected all questions about the domestic violence incident and his suspension. He refused to reflect back. \n“I’ve been on the field lately,” Hardy said. “In the last few seasons, this honestly, it’s been a blur, getting ready to come back. And now that I’m back, I don’t reminisce. I don’t look back, other than to know that I need to get to practice, and I need to get to sacks, and I need to get to the place where I need to be to help this team. That’s where we’re at right now.” \nThe Cowboys had only 28 sacks last season, a big reason they signed Hardy, and have only six sacks this season, including three last week against New Orleans. \n“I hope I come out guns blazin’,” Hardy said. “I’m full of excitement and full of juice. I’m ready to go. I have what they call fresh legs. I’m really excited to get out there on that grass or turf and see what they can do.” \nHardy served his four-game suspension and lost $2.2 million in possible roster bonuses. The Cowboys structured the deal as best they could to protect themselves from a possible suspension when they signed Hardy in March. \nHardy also has a maximum of $1.804 million in incentives that are going to be harder to attain because of the suspension. He will earn $500,000 for eight sacks, $1 million for 10 sacks, $1.4 million for 12 sacks and $1.804 million for 14 or more sacks.
