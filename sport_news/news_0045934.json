We were ready to play. We made some mistakes, but we made up for it and came away with a victory.”\nAlta quarterback Braxton Kerr\nSANDY — Alta threw punches early and often against rival Corner Canyon on Friday, en route to a 45-31 win where just about every punch thrown landed with a lot of force behind it.\nQuarterback Braxton Kerr led the way for the Hawks, throwing five touchdown passes while directing an offense that seemingly moved at will throughout the context.\nKerr's first pass of the evening set the tone.\nOn the first play from scrimmage, Kerr hit a streaking Camden Johnson for an 84-yard touchdown pass to put Alta up 7-0 before Corner Canyon even knew what hit it.\n“We knew exactly what they were doing and we had the right game plan,” said Alta coach Alema Te'o. “That very first play — we called it. We told everybody we were going to score on the first play, and that’s exactly what happened.”\nJust over a minute later, Kerr and the Hawks struck again.\nThis time it was running back Joshua Davis catching a pass out of the backfield from 17 yards out to put the Hawks up 14-0 with 10:31 remaining in the first quarter.\n“We came out fired up. We were ready to play,” Kerr said. “We made some mistakes, but we made up for it and came away with a victory.”\nThe Chargers managed to gather themselves and return some punches to put the game at 31-24 at the half before the Hawks again exploded out of the gate to start the second half.\nAgain it was Kerr connecting on a well-placed screen out of the backfield, this time to Zach Engstrom from 25 yards out to put the Hawks ahead 38-24 with 10:34 remaining in the third quarter.\nFrom there, Alta buckled down on defense, allowing just one touchdown for the remainder to come away with the win.\nFor Alta players going against a team that included former teammates and friends, Friday's victory held a lot of meaning.\n“It’s huge. It’s a big rivalry between the two schools and hopefully it’s the beginning of a great rivalry,” Te’o said. “My hat’s off to them, they have a great team.”\nTe'o also wanted to convey a message to those wanting to come to Alta's home turf in the future.\n“We don’t lose at home, and that’s the message we’re going to send to anyone who comes out here to play us,” Te’o said.\nWith the win, Alta finishes the season 7-3 and secures the No. 3 seed out of Region 7. With the loss, Corner Canyon secures the No. 4 seed while finishing the regular season with a 3-6 mark.\nEmail: bgurney@desnews.com \nTwitter: @BrandonCGurney", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:10:33.656+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
