Neither made the two-week West Coast trip with the team. \nSTREAKS: Tanner Kaspick and new captain Macoy Erkamps both went into Wednesday’s games with goals in four straight games, while Jayce Hawryluk and Reid Duke had six-game point streaks on the go. The season-high point-scoring streak in the Western Hockey League this season is held by Simon Stransky of the Prince Albert Raiders and rookie Michael Spacek of the Red Deer Rebels, who both had 10-game streaks snapped last Friday. \nRANKINGS: Brandon rose to third in the Canadian Hockey League rankings this week, up from their season-worst ranking of sixth last week. The unbeaten Erie Otters of the Ontario Hockey League remain on top. The other WHL teams in the rankings are the Moose Jaw Warriors (sixth), Seattle Thunderbirds (eighth) and Prince Albert Raiders (10th). \nROAD WARRIORS: When the Wheat Kings left Saskatoon on Saturday, they were 3-0-0-0 on the road this season. \nPRODUCTION BY PERIOD: The Wheat Kings had scored 16 goals in the first period of the nine games they played prior to Wednesday, with 15 goals scored in each the second and third periods. They gave up four in the first period and six in each the second and third periods. \nTAKING THEIR SHOT: The Wheat Kings have taken 132 shots in the first and second periods this season and 129 in the third, which is remarkably consistent. Overall, they have outshot their opponents 401-210, averaging 44.56 shots per game.
