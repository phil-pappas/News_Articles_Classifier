First, it was to beat Lone Pine, which the Tornadoes did on the road. On Saturday, it was about beating a rival on their biggest stage of the year, which they checked off their list. The 46-0 Homecoming victory over the Immanuel Christian Crusaders at The Pit boosts the Tornadoes’ momentum, as they head into the final stretch of the season. “The win means the world to us,” said Trona head coach Curtis Boutte. “We knew ICS; they played a really tough schedule. To do it in front of our alumni, that’s awesome. The turnout here shows that this game is really important.” The Tornadoes began scoring early in the game when the Crusaders were stopped in their own end zone for a safety. Afterward, the Tornadoes endlessly pumped out offensive yards. Tyler MacLean and Malik Evans had rushing scores, and quarterback Tyler Boutte hurled a scoring strike to MacLean to put the Tornadoes up 24-0 at halftime. Trona played the ground game in the second half, as Gunnar Cartmell (twice) and Ben Leslie added rushing scores, while stifling the Crusaders’ rush presence to keep the shutout intact. “We are a hard-hitting team; that does our talking,” Boutte said. “I think we worked hard, and it shows in our contact.” Last season, the roles were reversed. The Tornadoes stopped by the Cerro Coso soccer field to play the Crusaders, which Immanuel won, 36-0. “We did a lot of weight lifting over the summer,” Curtis Boutte said. “We brought in a coach who loves weight lifting, and we are stronger than what I have ever seen.” Additionally, the Tornadoes played more sensible football. They lowered the number of penalties compared with the Lone Pine game, and didn’t give the Crusaders any chance to capitalize off free yards. It’s a part of the strategy Curtis Boutte has enforced in practice. “Every flag that we get equals 10 pushups,” he said. “And we do the number of wind sprints by penalty yardage.” Despite the loss, the Crusaders came into the game having prepared for the tough contest. Head coach Andy Castillo had his team play tough opponents before going into Hi-Lo League play. “It’s prepared us,” Castillo said of his preleague slate, “but we have a small team. They do show up though, and when they do, it’s about the numbers and keeping everyone healthy.” For additional, Trona-based preparedness, practice this week didn’t happen at Leroy Jackson Park, as usual. Page 2 of 2 - “We practiced at Immanuel,” Castillo said, “where it was mostly dirt and fertilizer. It went good, and the team handled everything fine.” The Tornadoes (5-1, 2-0 Hi-Lo) will visit Big Pine on Saturday, where they will be crowned the Hi-Lo League champions with a win. The Crusaders (2-5, 0-1 Hi-Lo) will visit Lone Pine on Friday. “We stay focused and say, ‘Yes, the league title is our goal, but we have more goals beyond that,’” Curtis Boutte said. “Win CIF – that’s been our motto this season.” By Christopher Livingston", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:54:43.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
