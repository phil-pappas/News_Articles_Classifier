(AP) -- Didier Drogba's scored on a 30-yard free kick, Evan Bush made a late diving save and the Montreal Impact beat the Colorado Rapids 1-0 on Saturday.\nAdChoices Drogba bent it around the wall and inside the right post for his team-leading ninth goal in nine appearances this season. It came immediately after the Impact's Andres Romero left the game on a stretcher because of an apparent right knee injury.\nThe Impact (13-13-6, 45 points) ended a two-game losing streak and increased their lead to four points over seventh-place Orlando City for the final Eastern Conference playoff position. Both teams have two games left.\nLucas Pittinari put a low hard shot on frame for the Colorado Rapids (8-14-10, 34 points) in the third minute of second-half stoppage time.
