The 44-year-old German on Saturday stabbed Henriette Reker, a leading candidate in Sunday's election for new mayor of Cologne. Reker is currently responsible for housing refugees in the city, and officials have said the man told them he acted out of anti-foreigner motives. A psychological examination has shown that there is no reason to doubt that the suspect can be held criminally responsible, prosecutors and police said in a joint statement. They said that they will seek to keep the man, who has not been identified, in custody on suspicion of attempted murder and dangerous bodily harm. The suspect has told officials, without giving details, that he was actively involved in the right-wing scene in the past, they added. \"This time goes back to the '90s,\" the statement said. \"In what function and intensity\" he was involved is now a matter for investigation. Officials have said that the man apparently acted alone and had no police record. Germany's interior minister has said that the attack on Reker, an independent candidate who is backed by Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democrats and two other parties, underlines growing concerns over hatred and violence amid the refugee crisis. Reker was stabbed in the neck and seriously wounded. Doctors said Saturday night that an operation went well and her life isn't in danger. They said she is likely to make a complete recovery. Sunday's election went ahead as planned. Reker was one of the favorites to win.
