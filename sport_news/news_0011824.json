The couple was headed eastbound on the Pike near Natick.\nBy the time two troopers and an ambulance arrived on the scene about 5 minutes later, a healthy baby girl had been born, police said. The family then continued on to Brigham & Women’s Hospital in the ambulance.\n Congratulations to the new baby, who we assume will be named “Pike,” “Lane,” or “Offramp.”\nGallery: The top baby names in Massachusetts.\nPrevious -- of -- Next The Social Security Online has posted the 100 most popular names for girls and boys in 2014 by state.
