His agent, Rich Paul, and the Cavs have not been able to reach an agreement over the past few months.\nWhile at a wedding in Miami, James posed for a photo with Thompson that he posted on social media with the caption, “Get it done!!!! Straight up. #MissMyBrother.”\nThe four-time MVP denied the message was aimed at the negotiations between the Cavs and Paul, who also represents James.\n“I’m not going to go to them and tell them what they should do,” James said. “That’s their job. They know how to do it very well, and they’ve done that to this point. They’ve brought in and did what they had to do for us to be a contending team. Tristan is a big part of that run we want to make. I believe that something will happen.”\nThompson remains a restricted free agent and can receive offers from other teams.\nThe Cavs went through a similar situation in 2007 with centre Anderson Varejao, who sat out Cleveland’s first 21 games before Charlotte signed him to an offer sheet that was matched by Cleveland.\nThompson made 15 starts in the playoffs last season after Kevin Love dislocated his shoulder in the first round against Boston.\nMore on thestar.com\nMaple Leafs make final cuts ahead of season opener\nBuehrle pulled in bottom of the first, Rays lead Jays 9-0", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T23:30:37.034+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
