Athletic Director Pat Haden announced that offensive coordinator Clay Helton would be the Trojans’ interim coach.\nSarkisian will seek treatment immediately, according to an athletic department source. Players noticed Sarkisian acted unusual during a special teams meeting and smelled alcohol on his breath, according to sources.\nHe did not attend Sunday’s practice and left before Haden informed the team of the coaching change.\n“I was at a basketball event earlier today when I got a call to say Sarkisian was not at practice,” Haden said. “I called Steve and he made it clear to me that he was not healthy, and I asked him to take an indefinite leave of absence. I think this is the right thing for our team.\n“I’ve spoken to our team and our coaches. They obviously had a great deal of concern for the health of coach Sarkisian. It was also clear to me the support that Clay has from the team and the staff.\n“We’ve got a big task this week with the Notre Dame game, and Clay will do a great job getting our team ready. I don’t have a lot of answers right now for you guys, as I first heard about this an hour-and-a-half ago.”\nA USC player, who asked not to be identified, said Sarkisian “acted drunk.”\nThis is the second time Sarkisian’s alcohol-related issues went public. However, sources that include a USC assistant coach, said they believe Sarkisian was drunk during USC’s 42-14 victory over Arizona State on Sept. 26.\n“In the locker room, he was too animated and had bloodshot eyes,” the coach said.\nAnother source claimed Sarkisian tried to huddle the players on the sideline but was pulled away by assistant coaches who believed he was not sober. Sarkisian spoke to the media after that game and did not appear drunk.\nSarkisian’s leave of absence is a black eye for Haden, who refused to suspend the coach after Sarkisian was drunk at the Salute to Troy event.\n“Leaders have to make decisions,” Haden said. “I’ve got lots of people who disagree with me.”\nDr. Howard Samuels, founder of the The Hills treatment center in Hollywood, said in August it was unwise to have Sarkisian seek treatment and coach football at the same time.\n“For him to be drunk (in public) is a huge problem,” Samuels said. “For him to say he mixed medication with alcohol, that is a bigger red light. He probably has a substance abuse problem.”\nAdvertisement\nHaden’s decision was even more unpopular after Sarkisian started the season 3-2 and lost to 17-point underdog Washington last week. The Sarkisian-led Trojans also lost back-to-back games at the Coliseum for the first time since 2001.\nOne of USC’s top recruits, linebacker Daelin Hayes of Ann Arbor, Michigan, announced Sunday he was no longer committed to the Trojans.\nThis is the second time Helton has served as interim coach. In 2013, he coached USC in the Las Vegas Bowl after then-interim coach Ed Orgeron quit because he was upset Haden hired Sarkisian.\n“Fortunately or unfortunately, I’ve been in this situation before, and once again am very fortunate to have a group of first-class kids that are extremely talented and want to do something special here,” Helton said.\n“They still have a lot of things out there that we can obtain with a big game against Notre Dame this week. The opportunity to still compete for the South championship in the Pac-12, and again very fortunate to have a group around me as a staff that is as first class as they get.”\nAbout scott.wolf@dailynews.com or follow Scott on Twitter: @insideusc Scott Wolf Back to top", "external_links": ["http://www.sbsun.com/sports/20151011/usc-players-noticed-steve-sarkisian-was-not-sober-at-sundays-special-teams-meeting", "http://twitter.com/insideusc", "http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=39"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:07:11.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
