We deal with this dilemma every autumn — and occasionally during spring — but this year’s version seems to me especially fraught with difficulty. The trouble, as anyone knows who has passed more than a few falls around here, is the temperature. Specifically the daily temperature fluctuations — what meteorologists, who like all specialists cultivate a jargon that’s as useful as hieroglyphics to people outside the field, refer to as the “diurnal range.\" Baker County’s climate tends toward the extreme end of this range. Our relatively high elevation, which ensures chilly nights, contributes to this. So does our isolation from the moderating influence of the Pacific Ocean, which is largely responsible for the much more temperate conditions west of the Cascades. The pattern of warm afternoons and nippy nights typically peaks in Baker County during early autumn. The clear skies common to the period have much to do with this — September, on average, is the second-driest month in Baker City, and October the third-driest. The scarcity of clouds allows for maximum warming from the sun during the day. But at night the lack of clouds, which act rather like a down comforter for the ground, lets much of that heat radiate back into the atmosphere. The result is what’s often called Indian summer — frosty mornings and balmy afternoons. Why this combination wreaks havoc on our choices of garments is obvious. The down coat that defies the dawn chill feels as appropriate, a handful of hours later at noontime, as waving a Confederate flag at a Bernie Sanders rally. Although there is no official gauge for defining the severity of the daily temperature swing, a spread of 50 degrees is abnormally high even for Baker County’s climate. (In Western Oregon such a range is exceedingly rare. And the difference once you cross the Cascades, one of the nation’s great climatic dividing lines, is even greater when you look at the temperature spread for the whole year. In Baker City, for instance, the overall temperature range — the difference between the hottest and coldest temperatures ever recorded here — is 145 degrees. The record high of 106 was set on Aug. 4, 1961, and the record low of 39 below on Dec. 30, 1978. The range for Salem, by contrast, is 118 degrees, and for Portland it’s 110 degrees.) As for days with at least a 50-degree spread, we had five in September — the widest spread, of 58 degrees, was on the 25th, with high of 89 and a low of 31 — and have had one so far in October. On 14 other days since Sept. 1 the daily range was between 45 and 49 degrees. Which is to say we’ve had quite a few days in which a significant wardrobe shift, around midday, was needed to stay comfortable. I don’t mean to imply that this bothers me. Actually I relish the extreme nature of our climate, and would happily trade the banality of a place with more tranquil weather for the occasional misjudgment in clothing choice. Baker County is so generous, delivering often within the same year the 20-below-zero arctic front, the 100-degree high pressure ridge and an eclectic mix of thunderstorms and gales and much else besides, that I’m loathe to choose from among its climatic cornucopia. I’d as soon pick the best Beatles song, or the greatest of Elliott Easton’s guitar solos with The Cars. But were I forced to make my stand, at risk of something nasty like a paper cut in the webbing between two fingers, I would select as my favorites these bright autumn days on the edge of winter. I need journey no farther than my own yard to enjoy the curious sensation of being balanced, as it were, between the frigidity just ahead and the sweltering days that have barely receded behind. I was out there the other day, around 11:30 in the morning, puttering around with a plastic rake in one hand and pretending, in case anyone looked outside, to be doing something about the crunchy and brilliant yellow carpet the ash tree had laid across the lawn. I had donned the thinnest of my fleece pullovers but in the shade cast by the ash and its neighbor, a weeping willow, my exposed skin shivered, and I felt clearly the breath of December. Yet in the span of a few steps to the east, I stepped into the sunlight and instant August. There is, though, a palpable difference between an 85-degree afternoon in October and one in July, no matter what the principles of thermodynamics (or whatever branch of science) dictate. I’ll concede that this contrast is partially psychological. By October, even during an early autumn as persistently fair and mild as this one has been, we understand implicitly that the heat of the day is a fragile thing, that its peak will be brief and that by dusk, which arrives more than two hours earlier than in July, the air will lose any semblance of summer. July is nothing like that. Then the heat lingers long after the dark has fallen and sometimes it never truly dissipates, only reaching a tepid minimum around dawn. But although I own a formidable array of thermometers, and consult them with the frequency of someone devoted to the tarot, I sometimes distrust the instruments. I can’t go along when they insist that a day in October, as the Wallowas seem almost to float on the horizon, their granite and limestone angles jutting into the blue with the crystalline sharpness of things seen through the finest optics, is the equivalent of July, when the haze lies heavy and the peaks are mere smudges. Physics, of course, insists that at 85 degrees, no matter the month, the molecules in the air are moving at the same rate. But I’d swear that even the molecules can distinguish between the inevitability of July’s heat and the ephemeral nature of October’s, that they begin to slow as if to prepare for the coming days when they will very nearly stop altogether, like a frog’s heart in deep winter.
