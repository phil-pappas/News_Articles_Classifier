It was really our performance that handicapped us,” MSU junior Joe Cox said. “It’s just something you can’t dwell on – they played a great game, and we have to come back (Friday) with a new mindset. It’s really in our hands. We didn’t play a good game today, and it obviously showed out there.” \nThe Spartans defeated the Lakers in their first meeting, 4-1, on Oct. 10 in Portland, Maine. They’ll wrap up their weekend series at 7:05 p.m. Friday at Munn, part of a stretch in which MSU (1-3-1) will play 10 of its next 13 games at home. \nThe turning point came with 12:06 left in the second period and the game tied 1-1. Cox got a short-handed breakaway and was slashed from behind on his drive to the net by the Lakers’ Eric Drapluk. MSU was awarded a penalty shot, but LSSU goalie Gordon Defiel smothered Cox’s shot after two fakes. \n“The goalie made a pretty nice stop. I threw pretty much everything I had at him,” Cox said. “If I’d have put that in, it’s 2-1. It might have changed things up.” \nThe Lakers (2-3) got a short-handed goal a little more than two minutes later, with Bryce Schmitt punching in the puck past MSU goalie Jake Hildebrand on a two-on-one breakaway. C.J. Hayes scored a little less than three minutes later to make it 3-1 LSSU. \nMSU’s Mackenzie MacEachern scored his third goal of the season just 2:18 into the third period. \nHildebrand was pulled with 2:04 remaining and the Spartans on a power play, but they couldn’t capitalize on the 6-on-4 advantage. LSSU’s Gage Torrel came out of the penalty box to score an empty-net goal with 56.6 seconds remaining. \n“Not good from start to finish,” MSU senior captain Michael Ferrantino said. “There wasn’t a whole lot of energy, there wasn’t a whole lot of puck possession, and there wasn’t too many good things. We shot ourselves in the foot a bit.” \nHildebrand made 19 saves, and defenseman John Draeger added a goal for the Spartans.
