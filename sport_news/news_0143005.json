Reggie Jackson, move over. \nPRAYER TIME \nEvery appearance that Roberto Osuna makes, the closer steps to the back of the mound, turns his back to the plate and says a prayer. Then after he gets the final out, he crosses himself, points skyward and says another quick prayer. \n“I just pray, I can’t tell you what I pray but I just pray and my mom does the same thing,” Osuna said of his ritual. “Then I give the best that I can like I promised just for them (his parents). I’ve been doing it since I was 16 years old.” \nAnd after the game? \n“I’m just giving thanks for letting me finish the game and letting me finish healthy,” Osuna said. \nOther than his parents, Osuna thinks of his grandmother. \n“She passed away when I was two years old but I remember her and all I do is for her,” he added. \nIn what proved to be the final game of the season, Osuna came on after the rain delay and didn’t have his good stuff as he opened with a walk and then allowed the go-ahead run to score all the way from first on a single into the right-field corner. \nOther than Lorenzo Cain running, who would have scored on that play? \nThe Royals hadn’t really flashed their wheels until that play. \nOY VEY \nIn looking for redemption and avoiding the ignominy of becoming the first pitcher in post-season history to lose his first eight starts, David Price missed the mark. \nInstead, the veteran left-hander hit the middle of the Kansas City Royals bats and almost sent the Blue Jays packing. \nIn looking to shed his loser tag and become a playoff mentsch, Price ended up like a post-season putz and it took a mighty two-run bomb by Bautista in the eighth to take him off the hook. \nStaring at a 3-1 loss and down to four outs, Bautista, who had hit a long solo shot in the fourth, crushed an offering from Madson to tie the game 3-3. \nPrice’s sixth pitch of the game ended in the seats in left in the first inning and his 15th pitch of the game ended in the seats in right in the second inning. Two solo home runs, two body blows from which Price and the Jays almost didn’t recover. \nFIRST-INNING BLUES \nSometimes the first inning tells you all you want to know. \nLast night looked like one of those times. \nIn the top of the first, leadoff hitter Ben Revere yanked a Yolando Escobar offering down the first base line just inside the bag for a leadoff double. A good way to start. \nThe positive vibes stopped right there, however, as Ventura retired the meat of the Jays order — Josh Donaldson, Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion — in order leaving Revere stuck at second. \nIn the bottom of the frame, Ben Zobrist , batting second in the Royals lineup, belted a 1-1 pitch into the seats in left to power Kansas City into an early 1-0 lead. \nIt set the tone for most of the game. Overall the Jays were 0-for-11 with runners in scoring position. \nTHE HARD WAY \nIn the fourth inning a mammoth solo shot by Bautista to left cut the Jays deficit to one run in the race to the seventh inning. \nWhy the seventh. Well, if the Royals hold a lead after six they go to their bullpen and roll out Kelvin Herrera, Madson and Wade Davis to close it out. The trio usually comes through so it was imperative for the Jays to at least be in a tie by the end of the sixth. \nTheir fifth inning opened on a promising note with consecutive walks to start the inning. Kevin Pillar took a strike, bunted foul and then flied out to centre as he failed to move the runners along. \nHad he done so it would have produced a run as Revere followed a deep fly to left on which Martin would have scored. \nIt was up to Donaldson now and the Bringer of Rain tagged the first pitch, hit a bullet that third baseman Mike Moustakas snared inches off the ground after diving to his left. \nNo runs, the Jays trailed 2-1. \nTaking no chances, Royals manager Ned Yost went to Herrera in the sixth with one out after an Encarnacion double. Herrera breezed through 1.2 innings before turning the ball over to Madson. \nMIDDLE MEN \nMiddle infielders have been a pain in the butt for the Blue Jays this post-season. \nIn the Division Series it was second baseman Rougned Odor of the Rangers who drove them crazy with his ability to get on base and his speed of foot. \nPicking it up where Odor left off and zooming on by him in the pain in the ass scale is Royals shortstop Alcides Escobar. Simply put he has been lights out at the plate and has been a table-setter extraordinaire. \nAgainst the Jays in the ALCS, Escobar batted .478 (11-for-23) while overall in the post-season he has raked at a .386 clip (17-for-44) with five RBIs and nine runs scored. \n“What he does, I think, is he really intensifies his focus,” manager Yost said in attempting to explain Escobar’s excellence in the post-season. \n“During the playoffs he just locks in. And when he’s focused, he’s as good as any player in the league at his position.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:19:05.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
