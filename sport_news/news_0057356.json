Boucher scored the go-ahead goal 12 minutes into the second half and also dished out two assists to teammate Bryce Rollins as the Ashland High boys soccer team overcame an early deficit to defeat visiting Churchill 3-1 in a Midwestern League clash Thursday at Ashland Middle School. After Churchill (3-3-3, 0-1 MWL) scored first in the 17th minute Rollins responded 11 minutes later on a corner-kick assist from Boucher. Boucher gave the Grizzlies (7-2-1, 3-0) the lead for good following a steal and an unassisted strike in the 52nd then delivered a perfect pass that led to Rollins’ second goal in the 63rd. “(Churchill) was really good,” Ashland assistant coach Brad Roupp said. “What happened today is the Ashland boys manned up. We had a whole bunch of players that came absolutely determined to play their best games, and several played the best games I’ve ever seen them play.” Other than Boucher and Rollins, Roupp said Ashland benefited from stellar defensive efforts from senior right back Aiden Locklin, sophomore Sam Inada and sophomore center back Ian Rinefort. Locklin found himself matched up against Churchill’s most dangerous offensive player, senior midfielder Giovanni Brigola, most of the day and was able to hold his own, Roupp said. “He just kept doing the right thing over and over to limit their attack,” Roupp said of Locklin. “(Brigola) plays all over the field and whenever (Locklin) was in the area he just stepped on it, took a stand and said, ‘Not today.’” Churchill took advantage of a defensive miscue by the Grizzlies to score in the 17th, but Ashland tied the game when Rollins headed in Boucher’s left-footed corner kick. Rollins ran from the far post to get to the ball then drove it just inside the near post, chest high. In the 52nd minute, Boucher scored on a goal Roupp described as “pure effort,” stealing the ball from a Churchill defender before beating two defenders and completing the run with a 12-yard strike. In the 63rd, Boucher passed the ball into the box and Rollins finished from just outside the box to give the Grizzlies some insurance. Roupp is pleased with how the Grizzlies are playing heading into their final three regular-season games, starting with next Thursday’s clash with Marist. Ashland has won four straight matches by a combined score of 15-2. “We started the season a little unsure of how we were going to play and even with positions,” he said. “The seniors are leading this thing and the young players are stepping up big time. It’s fun to watch them turn into young men and play with the desire called for.” Girls Volleyball Ashland won for the eighth time in its last nine matches, defeating North Eugene in four sets in Midwestern League action Thursday at Mountain Avenue Gym. The Grizzlies (14-5, 7-2 MWL) beat North Eugene 25-12, 23-25, 25-15, 25-17 to clinch a season sweep of the Highlanders. North Eugene fell to 7-10 and 3-6.
