(AP Photo/David Richard) \nTOLEDO, Ohio (AP) — Phillip Ely threw for 327 yards and four touchdowns as No. 22 Toledo improved to 6-0 for the first time since 1997 with a 63-20 win over Eastern Michigan on Saturday. \nThe Rockets (6-0, 2-0 Mid-American Conference) led 28-6 at halftime, and then Ely really warmed up. He threw touchdown passes on Toledo’s first two possessions of the second half, connecting with Corey Jones for a 55-yard score and then with Cody Thompson on an 88-yarder four minutes later. \nThe touchdown to Thompson was the fourth longest completion in school history, and it wasn’t the only record book-worthy play of the game against an Eastern Michigan (1-6, 0-3) defense that entered the game ranked 118th in scoring defense (40.7 points) and 116th in total defense (495.3 yards). \nToledo sophomore Terry Swanson busted loose for a 90-yard run late in the second quarter that set up Kareem Hunt’s 4-yard touchdown run on the next play. The long run — also the fourth longest in school history — was a payback of sorts for Hunt, who converted two fourth-down runs on an earlier drive that ended with Swanson scoring on a 9-yard run. \nDamion Jones-Moore also scored a rushing touchdown for Toledo, which finished with 611 yards of total offense. \nEly, who completed 18 of 27 passes and also threw touchdown passes to Michael Roberts and Diontae Johnson, was relieved by sophomore Michael Julian after the Rockets built a 49-6 lead late in the third quarter. \nJulian was 4 of 6 for 46 yards, including a 14-yard touchdown to Zach Yousey. \nQuarterback Reginald Bell Jr. returned to the Eastern Michigan lineup for the first time since suffering a broken jaw in a season-opening loss to Old Dominion. \nThe dual-threat sophomore completed 16 of 26 passes for 121 yards and rushed for 28 yards on 14 attempts. He threw one interception and was sacked four times before being replaced in the fourth quarter by Brogan Roback, who started the five previous games for the Eagles. \nEastern Michigan’s Darius Jackson rushed for 113 yards and two fourth quarter touchdowns. \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T22:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:19:24.732+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
