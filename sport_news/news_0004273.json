The loss ends BU's season just shy of a postseason berth. \nNeeding a win to advance to the America East playoffs, BU (3-12-2, 2-5-1 America East) grabbed the lead in the 51st minute when senior midfielder Katherine Corcoran scored her third goal of the season. Corcoran received a throw-in on the right side and dribbled left toward the top of the box. She then unloaded a 25-yard left-footer that tucked into the lower right corner. \nWBNG E-News - Sign Up For Our Newsletter! \nBut the Catamounts (7-7-2, 4-3-1 AE) countered in the 70th minute when a failed clear found the foot of Rylee Osgood, whose blast from the left side hit the top right corner. Then less than two minutes later, Vermont scored the game-winner when a cross from the right side was knocked around. Savana Yurick controlled it and quickly fed a short through ball to Catamounts' leading scorer Nikki McFarland, who didn't miss from 12 yards. \nCorcoran had Binghamton's last good chance with just over seven minutes left in regulation when her right-footer from 16 yards was pushed away by a diving Catamounts keeper Ally Ramos. \nBefore the game, BU honored its five graduating seniors: Corcoran, Samantha Crane, Jacqueline Ehrenreich, Alyssa Vallar and Stephani Church. \n\"Our seniors have been great for four years,\" head coach Sarah McClellan said. \"To be a Division I athlete at a tough school like Binghamton is quite an accomplishment. We started off slow this season and struggled to find meaning and purpose ... and the seniors and our entire team changed these last few games and put us in a situation where we had an opportunity to get into the playoffs on our own. I'm really proud that our team worked themselves back into the playoff hunt. We played a tight game today and almost made it ... we just came up a little short.\" \nCorcoran, a reigning second team all-conference player, was dangerous all afternoon, getting off a team-high four shots and dribbling around Vermont defenders all over the field. The goal was the eighth and final of her stellar career. \n\"Kat's been playing 'lights out' these past couple of games and she's certainly one of the best midfilders in the conference,\" McClellan said. \"She has the technical ability and speed on the ball. I'm happy for her that she was able to score another goal.\" \nSophomore keeper Katie Hatziyianis made five saves, including a leaping deflection over the crossbar that kept the game scoreless late in the first half. \n(Courtesy: Binghamton University)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T00:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T01:12:20.330+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
