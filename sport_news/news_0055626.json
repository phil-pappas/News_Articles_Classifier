There has been improvement to the hazy conditions in Singapore since early this morning (Sept 11). The 3-hour PSI dropped to a moderate 64 at 8am after hitting a high of 248 at 3am. As at 8am today, the 24-hour PSI was 152-176, in the mid to high sections of the Unhealthy range, said the National Environment Agency (NEA). This improvement is due to a shift in the direction of the prevailing winds to southeasterly. These winds are forecast to be maintained today, hence hazy conditions are expected to improve through the day. The haze hit new highs in Singapore on Thursday, recording 137 on the 3-hour PSI index at noon. This picture, taken on Sept 10, shows the worsening view from Sentosa. Smog from forest fires in Indonesia on Tuesday prompted the cancellation of flights and warnings for people to stay indoors while pushing air quality to unhealthy levels in neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia. The thick haze came from blazes on western Sumatra island and the Indonesian part of Borneo island which are home to huge palm oil and pulp and paper plantations. Vast tracts of land are cleared on both islands for plantations using illegal slash-and-burn methods, causing fierce fires every year during Indonesia’s dry season that choke the region with acrid smog.

Several areas in western Malaysia, including the capital Kuala Lumpur, recorded unhealthy air quality. Western Malaysia lies across the Malacca Strait from Sumatra. Efforts to tackle the fires with water-bombing helicopters and by chemically inducing rain were being hampered by poor visibility due to the smog which was preventing aircraft from flying, Indonesia’s disaster agency said.

The fires started raging intensely several days ago prompting Indonesian President Joko Widodo to visit Sumatra at the weekend and pledge a crackdown on companies that break the law by starting blazes. Pressure to stop the annual outbreaks of smog has increased since 2013 when Southeast Asia suffered its worst air pollution crisis for more than a decade with haze levels hitting a record high in Singapore. But attempts by the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations to resolve the problem have moved only slowly with repeated meetings on the subject producing little concrete.

If they were above 200, the session would be postponed for an hour, then cancelled if the smog levels remained too high. \"We are deeply disappointed with the haze threat,\" he said. \n\"However, the health and safety of our athletes, guests, officials, volunteers, spectators and staff are our top priority.\" Southeast Asia has suffered for years from annual bouts of smog caused by farmers in neighbouring Indonesia burning forests to clear their land for agriculture.
