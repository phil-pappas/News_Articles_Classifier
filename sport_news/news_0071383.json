We haven’t done one of these in a while. Rather than us picking topics, now is your chance to put issues on the table for discussion. What’s on your sports mind this weekend? \nIf there are things about the site you want to get off your chest, that’s fine too. We are always looking for ways to make the place more fun and welcoming and productive. Jonah and I both have our own watching, listening, and reading habits so obviously we won’t cover all the things worth covering in Toronto sports media. If there are things you want us to discuss more, let us know. \nHappy weekend everyone. I’ll be back at you next week. \nMike", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T01:41:34.634+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
