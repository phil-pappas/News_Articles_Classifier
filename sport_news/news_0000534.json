This also is a good confidence booster for her as she gets comfortable with racing again,” said Carstens. \nBrody Runez earned a 56th-place finish to lead the Whippet boys. Runez ran a 17:09.37. \n“Although finishing 56th, he is doing quite well in his first season on the team as a junior. His time of 17:09 is something to be proud of but also to look to build on as the season rolls on,” Carstens said of Runez. \nWhitewater competes again today in the Rock Valley North Divisional Championship at the Timber Lee Christian Center hosted by East Troy.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-29T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T12:27:23.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
