In that game, Clemson's defense held the Terriers to just 123 rushing yards, the lowest output by Wofford's triple-option offense. \nClemson and Georgia Tech have swapped victories in the series over the last several years, with the Yellow Jackets winning four of the last seven, albeit their victory in the 2009 ACC Championship Game was later vacated. Last year, Georgia Tech's defense took advantage of Clemson mistakes, taking two Cole Stoudt interceptions to the house en route to a 28-6 victory. Dabo Swinney didn't mince words when he brought up last year's game during his Monday press conference. \n\"They kicked our butt last year, it's that simple,\" said Swinney. \"We were pathetic offensively against this group last year and we really put our defense in a bad situation in this game last year.\" \nLast year, the Tigers were outgained 353 to 190 and lost the turnover margin, a stat that limited Clemson's sputtering offense even further. The Yellow Jackets enter Saturday's contest with a +3 turnover margin. The winner of the turnover battle has won five of the last six meetings in this series. \n\"They stretch the field horizontally and vertically and create one-on-one matchups,\" Swinney said of the Yellow Jacket offense. \"You have to be incredibly disciplined when you play option football. Paul Johnson came out of the womb coaching option football, and he's got answers. Throughout the course of the game you better have some change ups because if you have one pitch, he's going to hit it. The turnover margin will be critical and that's what happened to us last year.\" \nJohnson downplayed the differences in Georgia Tech's so-called unconventional offense, likening it to what many teams around the country are doing on a regular basis. \n\"If you really look, what we're doing and what they're doing is not a whole lot different, they're just doing it out of the gun,\" said Johnson. \"We don't zone block as much, but the principles are the same and it's pretty much the same every week. It's not a whole lot different from what everybody else does.\" \nGeorgia Tech's offense has been an enigma thus far in 2015. The Yellow Jackets are tops in the ACC, averaging 41 points per game, but convert just 35-percent of third down opportunities, which is next to last in the conference. Georgia Tech has accumulated the second-most first downs in the ACC this year, moving the chains an average of 23 times per game. Big plays have been the Yellow Jackets' calling card through the first third of the season. \n\"They've scored 28 touchdowns and 12 of them were on drives of two minutes or less,\" Dabo Swinney said. \"That's what they have the ability to do, so we need to be very disciplined. Everybody has to do his job, and they play four downs so we need to be ready. They don't punt a whole lot.\" \nA quick look at the stat book backs up Swinney's claim. The Yellow Jackets have punted just 16 times, the second-fewest in the ACC. Paul Johnson's team isn't afraid to go for it on fourth down, either, with the Yellow Jackets keeping their offense on the field 16 times on fourth down, converting nine of those attempts.
