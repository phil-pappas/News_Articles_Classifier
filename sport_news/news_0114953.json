The current team has added a bit more hardware to the shelf. The Cyclones broke rival Springfield High’s six-year stranglehold on the City Tournament championship last month, then clinched their first CS8 title since 2005 last week with a tough, two-set Senior Night victory over Rochester. It was a strangely muted affair, all things considered. “We were kind of surprised that not very many people were at our gym that night,” said Cyclones coach Sandy Hamilton, whose squad was still thrilled to have run the table with a perfect 9-0 league record. “That’s pretty impressive. It’s been a long time. It was a huge celebration.” Now Hamilton’s Cyclones (25-8) have their eyes on taller prizes as they get set to host a Class 3A regional this week at Jim Belz Gymnasium, where they will be the highest seed among six participants. SHG begins what it hopes will be a long postseason run on Tuesday night at 6 p.m against either No. 6 seed Jerseyville or No. 11 Lanphier, who will play an elimination match Monday night. A rematch with No. 3 seed Rochester (15-14) could await the Cyclones if both win their Tuesday semifinal matches. The Rockets will take on either No. 5 Taylorville or No. 12 Southeast at 7 p.m. Tuesday. Hamilton recalls that her squad was down 22-18 to Rochester last week before rallying to win the match 25-23, 25-19. SHG ended its regular season with a three-set victory at Mattoon last Thursday, avenging a three-set tournament loss to the Green Wave from Oct. 17. SHG is led by its trio of top hitters, Annie Urbance (221 kills, 33 ace serves), Eilise Cummins (190 kills, 70 blocks) and Emma Hopkins (180 kills, 44 aces 42 blocks), and is taking some momentum into the postseason. But Hamilton and her squad know they can’t assume anything now. “Each match has its own life and you’ve just got to come out and play,” said Hamilton. “We are not overlooking anybody.” Elsewhere Also in Class 3A, conference runner-up Lincoln (23-8 as of Saturday, 8-1 CS8) gets the top seed at its own regional. The Railers play at 6 p.m. Tuesday against either No. 6 Stanford-Olympia or No. 11 Clinton. In the other semifinal match there, No. 4 Metamora will battle No. 5 Morton. Lincoln closed out its regular season by winning the Mount Pulaski Topper Tournament on Saturday. The Railers are led by libero Julie Huynh (337 digs, as of Friday) and hitters Kaylyn Hoffert (257 kills, 31 aces), Hannah Cameron (180 kills, 196 digs) and Brook Soebbing (114 kills, 37 blocks). Jacksonville (12-18 takes the No. 4 seed into the Class 3A Greenville Regional, where non-league rival Quincy Notre Dame is the top seed. The Crimsons’ storied program has been in a rebuilding mode the past two seasons but boast a core of young talent, led by sophomore hitters Kiley Brunstein (143 kills) and Shae Upton (133 kills, 75 blocks) as well as junior Cassie Huey (64 blocks). In Class 4A, Springfield High (21-12) has a tough draw in the Pekin Regional, where the Senators’ 21 wins got them only a No. 6 seed in a 12-team regional. Pekin is actually a sub-regional, where Springfield will have the third-highest seed on that side of the bracket. “A lot of those (teams), we haven’t seen,” said Springfield High first-year coach Angie Riggle. “I know a lot of the teams, across the board, play pretty tough schedules. I think we’ve got a good shot of coming out of that regional if we play to our potential.” The Senators, led by hitters Carrie Rolf (207 kills, 259 digs) and Kari Wilhelm (167 kills, 35 aces, 53 blocks), have gotten a nice spark lately from freshman outside hitter Abby Ratsch, who joined the varsity lineup at the City Tournament and has since posted 82 kills — 2.3 per set, which is second on the team. “She’s that young energy on the team,” said Riggle. “Even though she’s young, she’s got a lot of power behind her swing, and I think the upperclassmen respect that.” Looking for a third-straight regional title, the Senators begin their postseason Tuesday at 7 p.m against host Pekin, the No. 4 seed. The winner likely gets top seed Bloomington (22-5) in the title match on Thursday. Riggle said she likes that her squad is not dependent on one or two “star players” but instead goes out each match with a “whatever it takes” mentality. That explains why six different SHS players have each recorded at least 100 digs, led by Cressa Wagner’s 289. “We’re kind of a quiet team,” said Riggle. “Everybody is in it together. Ultimately, they know we all have to pull together to keep on playing.” Page 2 of 2 - —Contact Brian Webster, 788-1545, brian.webster @sj-r.com, twitter.com/briweb69 . ***", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:28:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:38:45.070+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
