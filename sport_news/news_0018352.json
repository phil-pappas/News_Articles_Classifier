Bacus also scored four touchdowns. Sam Jackson also had 148 yards and a touchdown on 10 carries, while Colby Miller added 132 yards and two scores on 14 carries. Jackson Madonna also had a rushing touchdown, as the Trojans averaged 10.1 yards per carry. \nMadison County fought its way back into the contest with two touchdowns in the second quarter to pull within 28-20 at the half. But Jackson ripped off a 33-yard touchdown run in the third quarter for a 35-20 lead, setting up the fourth quarter spree that killed off the contest. \nMiller scored on runs of 1 and 54 yards, while Bacus added a 71-yard run to pull away for good. \nNorth Hall travels to Monroe Area next week.
