Now six games into the regular season and still undefeated, this is the best start for any Panther squad in team history. \n\"We made the jumbotron! That was the highlight,\" said Trish Haddock, a life-long Panther fan outside the team store. \"There were a few touch-and-go moments, but yeah, we knew they could pull it out.\" \nHaddock and three of her friends had to be asked to leave the Stadium Sunday night. This season has been magical for them. \n\"It's just got all the right pieces working together. Right players, right fan base, everything is working right, and we're going to the Super Bowl this year.\" \n\"I think it's their fan support.\" added Elizabeth Folk, who was in the group. \"I expect for them to go all the way.\" \nAt 'THE FAN Sports Radio 610AM', the phone calls were steady, and the conversation was dominated by a hometown team playing their best football ever. \n\"There were a lot of guys on that defense that stepped up,\" said Bustin' Loose co-host Mark Yarbro. \n\"There is something going on with this team,\" added co-host Frank Garcia. \"Most importantly, when they got into the red zone last night they found a way to get seven (points). That was the difference.\" \n\"Oh, man; it was amazing,\" said Brian Sweeney who just moved to Charlotte a year ago. \"I'm a die-hard Panthers fan now.\" \nSweeney has his tickets for the next chance to see his team keep their perfect season going. \n\"I'm excited to go to the game on Monday night.\" \nThe Carolina Panthers are back in primetime November 2, as they host the Indianapolis Colts at Bank of America Stadium.
