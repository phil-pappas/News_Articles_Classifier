U.S. District Judge Lance Africk told Sheriff Marlin Gusman to again use an area of the old jail known as \"the docks\" to hold court-bound inmates until a new arrangement can be made.\nAfrick told the city to cover the cost of bolstering security in the area.\nAfrick is overseeing court-ordered reforms at the jail.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
