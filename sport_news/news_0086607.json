Ahmedabad's triple world billiards champion Rupesh Shah settled for a bronze medal in the time-format of the world billiards championship played in Australia. Shah was knocked out by compatriot and defending champion Pankaj Advani in four hours semi-final encounter.\nThis is for the first time that Shah has won a medal in time-format at worlds.\nArjuna awardee Rupesh was never allowed by Advani to come close to his points as Advani maintained his lead throughout the match. Advani continued scoring reasonable breaks at regular interval and later scored breaks of 205, 205 and 397 to widen the gap between him and Rupesh.\nThere was a chance when Rupesh could have made a big break and put pressure on Advani he failed to convert that chance into big break and faltered after scoring 105.\nThe ONGC employee continues to impress on the green baize. And hopes to pocket a few more world titles before he calls it a day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-27T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:20:08.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
