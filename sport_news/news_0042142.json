Coach Jim McElwain says Grier made an honest mistake that could have been prevented by talking to the team’s medical staff. \nGrier was emotional while apologizing for his mistake when he spoke to reporters Monday. \nThe eighth-ranked Gators (6-0, 4-0 Southeastern Conference) play at No. 6 LSU (5-0, 3-0) Saturday. Grier, a freshman, has started the last five games for the Gators. Sophomore Treon Harris is expected to start in his place. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
