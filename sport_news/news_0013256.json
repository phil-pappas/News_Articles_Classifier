BC High cut the lead to 21-14 on a 20-yard touchdown run by Stephen Timmins and a 27-yard touchdown pass from Marco King to Will Johnson.\nBC High (4-2) tied the score at 21 with 1:20 to go on a 31-yard touchdown run by King (six rushes, 48 yards, three TDs), sending the game to overtime.\nSt. John’s Prep (6-0), however, refused to die. It scored on its first overtime possession on a 1-yard touchdown run by quarterback Ollie Eberth (14/20, 148 yards, two TDs). The lead extended to eight on a two-point conversion pass from Eberth to Declan Burt.\nNeeding eight points to keep the game going, BC High scored on a 10-yard run by King. The two-point pass attempt, however, was broken up by Burt and the Prep held on against its archrival.\n“You go up 21 and to be honest I don’t think we did anything differently, they just started making plays,” said St. John’s Prep coach Brian St. Pierre. “But, these kids, a lot of resolve shown on both sides of the ball.\n“This conference is brutal,” St. Pierre added. “On top of our ridiculous nonconference schedule, I mean that’s why these kids come here. To play against the BC Highs and the Catholic Memorials and Malden Catholics and the Xaverians. We were far from perfect tonight but it’s a big win in the end.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:47:55.520+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
