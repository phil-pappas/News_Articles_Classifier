Na played the closing stretch in 3 under for a 64. \nThe PGA Tour season opener is wide open going into the final round. Sixteen players were separated by only four shots. \nSteele was at 14-under 202 as he tries to go wire-to-wire. \nRory McIlroy never got anything going and was eight shots behind. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:04:48.850+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
