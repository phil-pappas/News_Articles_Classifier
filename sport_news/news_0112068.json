A 20-year-old Staten Island woman has been charged with statutory rape for her alleged sexual relationship with a 13-year-old.\nMegan Donovan was arrested on the salacious charges Wednesday but released on $1000 bond, CBS2 reported . She is under strict orders not to contact her accuser or his family.\nDonovan, who met the teenager through his sister, had her first sexual encouter with him on Tuesday, law enforcement sources told SILive.com .\nThe wannabe Mrs. Robinson was reportedly outed when her underage conquest bragged to friends and the secret slipped out to his mother, who called the police.\nIncriminating text messages between the pair confirmed the act, sources said.\nDonovan's lawyer Mark Geiser dismissed the accusation as a \"fabrication\" and blamed the boy for inventing the story.\n\"He has a crush on her,\" Geiser told SILive. \"He has a rich imagination, an overactive imagination.\"\nGeisser also pointed to the the accuser's mother's own troubled legal past, citing her recent perjury indictment.\nOn top of the rape charge, Donovan faces charges of sexual misconduct and endangering the welfare of a child, according to a spokesman for the District Attorney's office.\nIf convicted, she could face up to four years in prison and would become a registered sex offender.\n\"She's a very nice girl. I'm very surprised to hear that,\" Donovan's neighbor Ron Hansen told CBS 2.\nBut Louis Diamond , who represents the teen and his mother, stressed that nice or not, Donovan knew what she was doing.\n\"This is a woman. She's not a girl,\" he told SILive. \"Don't forget, there's a big difference between 13 and 21.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.silive.com/southshore/index.ssf/2011/03/staten_island_woman_20_in_cuff.html", "http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2011/03/31/staten-island-woman-accused-of-having-sex-with-13-year-old-boy/"], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T12:28:28.853+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
