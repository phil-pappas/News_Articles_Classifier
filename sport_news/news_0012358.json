(AP Photo/Rui Vieira) \nLONDON (AP) — Juergen Klopp’s first game since taking over as Liverpool manager ended in a 0-0 draw with Tottenham in the Premier League on Saturday. \nDivock Origi, making his first Premier League start for Liverpool ahead of the injured Daniel Sturridge, hit the crossbar at White Hart Lane with a header in the 10th minute. \nLiverpool had more possession in the first half but Tottenham had better chances. \nLiverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet made a stunning one-handed save to deny Clinton N’Jie and also saved one-on-one against Harry Kane. \nOrigi went close again in the second half, where Liverpool had the majority of the ball, but neither side could find a winning goal.
