The Spaniard has beaten Sindhu three times in four duels. The only time Sindhu had beaten the World No. 2 Spaniard was in 2011 Maldives International Challenge. \nBlowing hot and cold this season, Sindhu produced a superb game to leave Yihan clueless. \nSindhu came up with a neat game where she held a 3-0 lead early on and didn't allow Yihan to gain any momentum in the first game. \nThe script didn't change much in the second game as Sindhu once again moved to a massive 7-1 lead and zoomed to 19-15. Yihan reeled off four straight points to conjure up hopes of a turnaround but the Indian shut the door on her with two more quick points. \nImage: India's P V Sindhu \nPhotograph: PTI © Copyright 2015 PTI.
