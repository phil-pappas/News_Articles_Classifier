VIDEO BY BILL ROSEMEIER/CORRESPONDENT/THE JOURNAL-STANDARD By Karen Patterson Posted Oct. 3, 2015 at 12:01 AM » RELATED CONTENT • Boylan's passing game brings new test for Pretzels' stout defense... FREEPORT -- The last time Freeport's football team defeated Boylan, Freeport senior Vance McShane was in first grade. Teammates Caleb Sellers and Ben Swords were in kindergarten. On Friday, the trio celebrated with teammates like kids on the playground as Freeport made one big play after another in a 33-10 home win against Boylan. The win marks the first Pretzels victory -- home or away -- against Boylan since 2004. \"There are some guys who have been around here on our staff that are Freeport alumn, and I know (the win) means a lot to them,\" Freeport coach Aaron Wichman said. McShane racked up 268 yards against the Titans on 30 carries with two second-half touchdowns, including the game's final score on a 72-yard run. \"I was just seeing open field and waiting for that moment,\" McShane said. \"Your eyes light up and you're like, oh yeah, 'End zone.'\" Freeport (4-2) used a balanced offense to disrupt a Boylan defense that struggled to stop big plays. Swords, Freeport's quarterback, was nearly flawless, completing 9 of 10 attempts for 105 yards with three touchdown passes. The first, a 29-yard arcing toss to Deion McShane on the far right side of the end zone, came late in the first quarter after the Pretzels struggled to gain first downs during their first two possessions. \"We just knew that we had our speed and opportunity over (Boylan),\" Swords said. \"We're so athletic and we got the opportunities.\" A sophomore, Deion McShane finished the game with three catches for 45 yards. Sellers led the receiving corps, catching four passes for 62 yards and a leaping third-quarter touchdown to give the Pretzels a 26-3 lead late in the third quarter. \"I've been doing that since I was little,\" Sellers said. \"Me and my dad used to be out in the back working on that all the time.\" Sellers dominated both sides of the ball, grabbing two interceptions off throws by Boylan quarterback Zach Couper. Sellers first struck with just 55 seconds left in the first half, ending a Titan drive that began deep in Freeport territory. The second interception sealed the Freeport win: Sellers grabbed a ball tipped by teammate Demetri Offard with about four minutes left. Offard also snagged an interception near midfield to stop Boylan's opening second-half drive. Wichman and Boylan coach John Cacciatore both credited Freeport's defense, which has found dominant success against the run game this season, for bending but not breaking during long Titan drives. \"I thought we were throwing the ball well and doing a good job of keeping them off balance,\" Cacciatore said. \"But too much of a good thing gets to be a bad thing. We just didn't execute (on offense) well. We have to be careful on what we do, and be a little unbalanced to off-balance the defense.\" Page 2 of 2 - Freeport's defense limited Boylan to 94 yards in the first, 54 of which came on the ground. Led by Micah Bruce, Micah Stacy and Jered Allison on the line, the Pretzels buckled down in the second half, allowing just 68 total offensive yards, despite Boylan scoring a late third quarter touchdown on a 28-yard run by Tyreese Washington. Washington finished the game with 52 yards on 12 carries. Teammate Dominic Dal Santo had nine carries for 43 yards. Couper, the NIC-10's leading passer, completed nine passes in 21 attempts for 51 yards. This game, Cacciatore said, will be used as a learning tool as Boylan (0-6) prepares to face East at home on Friday for homecoming. \"It's not coming from a place where we're not practicing those things. It's just game time, and we have to get better,\" he added. \"Kids are kids and they have to face the fact that they're looking uphill. Our attitude and effort have been great, we just have to coach them through it.\" Karen Patterson: 815-232-013; Karen.patterson@Journalstandard.com ; @KarenP_FJS By Karen Patterson", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T14:18:49.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
