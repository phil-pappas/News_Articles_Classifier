He returns to a track Sunday – the aforementioned, 2.66-mile superspeedway – that folks in his line of work have a reason to hate. This time, his team's NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship bid is on the line, and the same goes for a number of others in the 43-car field. \n\"This week will be the wildest one of the year,\" Eicher said. \nThe 34-year-old fuels up Matt Kenseth's No. 20 Toyota, which last time out looked on the verge of winning at Kansas Speedway and advancing to the next round of NASCAR's playoffs. But Joey Logano spun Kenseth late in the race, the two battling for the lead, and left Eicher's team in a tough spot. \nIt's win Talladega and advance, or lose and possibly end a championship chase. \n\"We didn't feel that Joey raced us fair, because there was a run before that when we couldn't get around Joey,\" Eicher said. \"It took us 10 laps, but we did it clean.\" \nLast year, a racing incident that cost Jeff Gordon a shot at winning in the postseason led to a brawl between pit crews. \n\"My response to that is always that the guys in the pits are not holding the steering wheel,\" Eicher said. \nAnd so Kenseth's team – Eicher included – left the feuding to their driver. \nOn Sunday, Kenseth will have to fend off drivers such as Dale Earnhardt Jr., who won earlier this year at Talladega, as well as Jeff Gordon and 2012 Cup Series champion Brad Keselowski. Only Logano, who went on to win at Kansas, is guaranteed one of eight advancing spots with four races to go in 2015. \nThe No. 20's good-luck charm could be Eicher, the pit crew member tasked with loading 110 pounds of fuel into the car four or five times each weekend. It takes two tanks, with a sub-two-second swap between, for him to get the job done. \nWhen Eicher broke into NASCAR in 2003, then working for Roush Racing, Kenseth won his first championship. The next year, he worked on cars driven by Kurt Busch, who won a title. Then he joined Gibbs' operation, and Tony Stewart made it three straight for Eicher. \n\"It's rewarding, but at the same time it's like, I can't do this forever,\" he said. \nTraveling to races meant 78 days away from family in 2014. Though Eicher often arrives to the track on race day, he also serves as gas man for Gibbs' No. 18 NASCAR Xfinity Series team, meaning double the time on the road. \nWinning keeps Eicher coming back. \n\"We get to go out and compete,\" he said. \"That's what coach Gibbs always says. He likes football and racing because it's competitive. It's not just going to work and turning a wrench at a shop.\" 1 CONNECT 6 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1S2TGl1 TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T22:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:55:48.391+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
