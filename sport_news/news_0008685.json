(OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The area’s Class 4 cross country teams kicked off the postseason on Saturday. In Lebanon, the Class 4 – District 5 meet was a mirror image of the Ozark Conference meet from two weeks ago with all of the same faces winning team and individual titles. Kickapoo senior Nathan Hall continued his strong season by posting a 15:43.74 to win the boys’ race by 25 seconds.\"It was just like (Ozark Conference). The same race plan,\" Hall said. \"Just get out front and take it from the start. I was just focusing on being very smooth and smooth translates to fast most of the time. It makes it pretty easy just thinking about being smooth.\" He pulled away early and never looked back. Jefferson City had the second and third place runners in times of 16:08.64 and 16:11.21. Behind them was the West Plains trio of Josh Ingalls, Jacob Mccrackin and Ben Stasney in fourth, fifth and sixth. Their strong pack finish was indicative of what the Zizzers have done all season.\"They have run as a team. They have taken any personal agenda and put it behind the team agenda,\" West Plains head coach Joe Bill Dixon said. \"If you watch them run, they really stick together in a pack a lot longer than most teams. They seem to have good timing to know when it is time to break up.\" That strong finish helped the Zizzers to a team title with 42 points in a season when there was some uncertainty coming in due to inexperience back in August.\"We really didn't predict it wrong. There was no experience and they were young, but they have done everything I have asked of them from the word go,\" Dixon said. Jefferson City finished as the runner-up with 55 points. Kickapoo and Glendale rounded out the top four teams that qualified for next Saturday’s sectional meet. CLICK HERE FOR FULL RESULTS OF THE BOYS RACE On the girls’ side, it was all West Plains. Hayley Baca, Kayli Brower, Theresa Harto and Sydney Sanders ran well early together before Baca and Brower broke away late to finish first and second. Harto and Sanders were seventh and eighth. Madison Brownrigg finished 13th for the Lady Zizzers to close out a dominant performance.\"With those four girls, I am not really ever sure who is going to pull ahead,\" West Plains girls coach Alisha Gunter said. \"We try to stick together and pull from the power of the pack as long as we can. She (Baca) has earned it by all means. She is a trackster and has that leg speed. I am not surprised (she won), but I wouldn't have been surprised at any one of those four.\" Baca broke the tape at 19:17.64. Brower finished in 19:35.83. COC Large champion Adeline Holder was third in 19:42.33. The Lady Zizzers posted 31 points, which was well ahead of runner-up Jefferson City’s 69. Branson and Ozark rounded out the top four team qualifiers. All of the qualifiers from this district will head to Camdenton next Saturday with the qualifiers from District 6 in Nixa with berths in the state meet on the line.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T06:13:11.745+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
