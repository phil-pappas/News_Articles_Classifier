Lester is 6-5 with a 2.66 ERA in 15 career postseason games, including 13 starts.\nThe Cubs will find out their opponent for the next round when the Dodgers host the New York Mets in Game 5 of their division series on Thursday night.\nRussell left Game 3 of the NLDS against the Cardinals due to tightness in his left hamstring. Maddon says it's a moderate strain, and the team will be pragmatic with the injury.\nJavier Baez, who replaced Russell after he left in the previous round, will be the starting shortstop in the NLCS.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
