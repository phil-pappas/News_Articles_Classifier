It was a light-hearted, fun gesture, and one that can help keep the Warriors loose and focused -- just like they were last season. \nSubjectively, the best part of the video was either Andre Iguodala 's inappropriate suggestion or David Lee -- who made a surprise cameo in the credits -- begging to rejoin the team by offering them Chipotle. \nThere are plenty of pressures that come with defending a title, and sometimes you just need to sit back, watch a cartoon of yourself and laugh. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:45:50.777+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
