(AP) - An early morning fight between two groups of students escalated into gunfire in the parking lot outside an Arizona university dormitory, leaving one person dead and three others wounded, authorities said Friday.\nThe suspected shooter, identified by police as 18-year-old Steven Jones, was in custody, said university police Chief JT Fowler.\nThe parking lot where the shooting happened is just outside Mountain View Hall dormitory at the northeast side of the Flagstaff campus, said school public relations director Cindy Brown.\nThe dorm is home to many of the campus' sororities and fraternities, according to the school's website.\n\"This is not going to be a normal day at NAU,\" said school president Rita Cheng. \"Our hearts are heavy.\"\nStudent Maria Gonzalez told The Associated Press that she at first suspected firecrackers.\n\"I was studying for an exam so I looked out the window and see two people running, and that's when I realized they weren't fireworks they were actually gunshots,\" she said.\nThe first police call about the gunfire came in at 1:20 a.m. PDT.\nOn its website, the university said that the campus was stabilized and the campus was not on lockdown.\n\"How am I supposed to feel safe where I'm learning,\" Gonzalez said.\nBrown said the wounded were taken to Flagstaff Medical Center, which said it couldn't release any information on conditions.\nBoth university and Flagstaff police are investigating.\nThe Flagstaff shooting comes on the same day that President Barack Obama is scheduled to visit Roseburg, Oregon, where eight students and a teacher were shot and killed last week at Umpqua Community College. The gunman in the Oregon shooting wounded nine others before turning the gun on himself.\nNAU plays a major role in the northern Arizona city of Flagstaff.\nThe 4-year public university has more than 25,000 total undergraduates.\nAP writers Bob Seavey in Phoenix and Bob Lentz in Philadelphia and AP Radio's Matt Small in Washington contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
