In this process, the apex court had rubbished five basic features of the Constitution — parliamentary democracy, elected government, council of ministers, elected Prime Minister and elected Leader of the Opposition, he said. “Indian democracy cannot be a tyranny of the unelected and if the elected are undermined, democracy itself would be in danger,” Jaitely said in a Facebook post, clarifying that these were his personal views. “Politician-bashing is the key to the judgment,” the BJP leader maintained. Though the SC’s opinion was final, the court was “not infallible,” he said. Admitting that independence of judiciary was a basic structure, he said this should not be ensured by “rubbishing all other basic structures by referring to them as politicians.” He questioned the SC’s logic behind citing BJP leader LK Advani’s remark (that return of Emergency could not be ruled out) to axe the proposed National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC). In fact, it was the SC “that caved in” in the 1970s when Emergency was declared, while politicians like him opposed it and went to prison. “Therefore, for the court to assume that it alone can defend the nation against Emergency is belied by history,” he said. The first error in the 4-1 majority ruling was the rationale that “India’s democracy has to be saved from its elected representatives” by striking down the 99th Constitution Amendment and NJAC Act, both being the products of democratic institutions and constitutional functionaries. The second flaw was in the interpretation of Articles 124 and 217 “to imply exclusivity of the Chief Justice in the matter of appointment of (SC and HC judges) excluding the role of the President almost entirely. No principle of interpretation of law anywhere in the world gives the judicial institutions the jurisdiction to interpret a constitutional provision to mean the opposite of what the Constituent Assembly had said. The court can only interpret.” Minister sees 4 ‘flaws’\nSC verdict It is immaterial that 99th amendment and NJAC were passed by Parliament and ratified by 28 state assemblies Articles 124 and 217 give primacy to CJI in judges’ appointment Striking down the amendment revives collegium We will improve collegium Jaitley’s take Parliament and its instruments can’t be undermined like this This is against universal principles of interpretation Only Parliament can restore repealed provisions of Articles 124 and 217 This again is job of Parliament", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:17:41.989+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
