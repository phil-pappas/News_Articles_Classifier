And so Sunday's biggest head-scratching moment at Ford Field didn't provide much closure on a hot-button issue.\nWith 53 seconds left in the first half, Bears linebacker Jonathan Anderson made an interception, snaring a ball in the end zone that had been stripped out of the hands of Lions receiver Golden Tate by cornerback Kyle Fuller.\nOfficials awarded the Bears possession until a replay review flipped the play into a touchdown and a 21-13 Lions lead.\nDean Blandino, the NFL's vice president of officiating, asserted that all of the tricky nuances within the definition of \"completing the process of a catch\" while going to the ground didn't really apply Sunday when an upright Tate got his hands on Matthew Stafford's 2-yard pass.\nOnce Tate had the ball inside the end zone and had, in Blandino's judgment, established himself as a runner, the play was over.\n\"When you watch the play, (as) the ball comes loose, he is taking his third step,\" Blandino said in a video explanation posted to NFL.com. \"The third step is almost on the ground when the ball comes out. He had demonstrated possession and had become a runner.\"\nStill, last week Bears coach John Fox had shown his team a Week 5 touchdown catch by Falcons running back Devonta Freeman that was later ruled incomplete because Freeman, who had two feet down before lunging for the end zone, lost control of the ball when he hit the ground.\nSo, yes, Bears players remain perplexed.\n\"Looked like the same kind of play,\" Matt Forte said. \"And they went the other way with the call. So I don't know what (a catch) is anymore.\"\nAdded Pernell McPhee: \"That's a crazy rule, man. I think we all know that was an interception.\"\n(c)2015 Chicago Tribune\nVisit the Chicago Tribune at www.chicagotribune.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739837", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739837&h=Bears+don%27t+catch+a+break+on+reversed+call+on+interception", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1739837&hashtags=ArcaMax"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:44:37.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
