That's what we need to do again. \n\"Losing 2-1 is not a nice feeling. We've got a second chance now, so we've got to pick ourselves up. \n\"We've lost two games in the group. We've got to take positives, we've got to look back at what we've done. I don't think we should fear anyone in the play-offs. \n\"We'll build our confidence back up. We've got a month now to re-focus.\" \nIreland will learn their fate in Sunday's draw, but, with seeding determined by UEFA co-efficients, are likely to find themselves playing a side ranked above them. \nTheir play-off record could be better - they have won only two of seven - but they did taste success in their last venture into the sudden death showdowns four years ago when they beat Estonia 5-1 on aggregate. \nThe opposition is almost certain to be significantly stronger this time around, but, having beaten world champions Germany 1-0 on Thursday evening to set up their big chance in Poland, Hendrick insists they should not be afraid of what lies ahead. \nHe said: \"We'll need to be confident. We can look back on some good stuff we've done in this group - beating the world champions, drawing with them away. \n\"We're a difficult team to play, we've got to remember that and bring that into the play-off.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T11:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:01:45.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
