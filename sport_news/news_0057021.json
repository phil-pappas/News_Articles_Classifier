New York needs just one more point from its remaining two games in the regular season to seal top spot in the East and an advantageous draw in the playoffs. The Red Bulls are three points ahead of the West’s top teams for the overall league lead. Vancouver was held to a scoreless draw at home by Dallas, staying a point behind the Texan club in the tight fight for top spot in the West, but the result was enough to clinch a playoff spot. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T07:27:30.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
