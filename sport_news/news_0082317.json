They know how hard it was this time. \nYet it could be argued that this Fever team, with new players and a new coach, was a year ahead of schedule anyway. It's plausible that the Fever could send Tamika Catchings into retirement with another championship in 2016, her final season. \nIn the aftermath of Wednesday's 69-52 loss to the Minnesota Lynx in the climactic Game 5 of the WNBA Finals, Catchings wasn't ready to forecast anything. Neither was her former teammate, coach Stephanie White. \n\"You look at who we have on our roster, and a young core, so to speak,\" White said. \"But we also realize how incredibly difficult it is.\" \nShe alluded to seeding, and the Fever were indeed at a disadvantage, not holding home-court advantage in any of the three playoff rounds. The No. 3-seeded Fever were bidding to become the first champion that wasn't a No. 1 or 2 seed. A tearful Briann January talks about the Fever's Game 5 defeat to Minnesota in the WNBA Finals. (David Woods / The Star) \nThe Fever were 5-0 in elimination games before the Lynx finally knocked them out. New York and Chicago will be contenders in the Eastern Conference again, as will Minnesota, Phoenix and perhaps Los Angeles in the West. \nThe Lynx have won three titles in five years. Otherwise, parity prevails. \nCatchings is 36, but the Fever's next-oldest players are Erlana Larkins and Shavonte Zellous, both 29. Excluding Catchings, the average age is 25.6. Players are either in the prime of their careers or on the rise. \nZellous is an unrestricted free agent, so the Fever could lose her to another team that will pay her more or play her more. Shenise Johnson, Lynetta Kizer and Jeanette Pohlen are restricted free agents, meaning the Fever can match other teams' offers to retain them. \nPoint guard Briann January has already signed a contract extension. She was as impactful as anyone on either team in the WBNA Finals, leading the Fever in scoring (15.4) and the series in assists (5.4). She could be in the mix to join Catchings on the USA Basketball team for the Rio Olympics. Tamika Catchings comes so close, but no 2nd title \nJanuary said the Fever \"have something special\" and that she hoped the team would stay intact. \n\"A game like this presents a huge growth opportunity for us, and more lessons,\" she said after Game 5. \"I believe we can get back to this moment and come out on top.\" \nJohnson, a guard playing her first season with the Fever, is a potential All-Star. With San Antonio, she totaled 10 points in four playoff games. In 11 playoff games for the Fever, she averaged 12.4, second only to Catchings (16.3). \nMarissa Coleman, a forward in her second year with the Fever, made her first All-Star team. She was third on the team in playoff scoring (11.9) and sank 21 3-pointers, second in the postseason only to the Lynx's Maya Moore (22). Tamika Catchings says the Indiana Fever played as if 'drained' in Game of the WNBA Finals. (David Woods / The Star) \n\"I think this is going to fuel everybody's fire for next season,\" Coleman said. \"Hopefully, everybody has a safe and healthy offseason and comes back and uses this feeling to propel us to a good season next year.\" \nTwo players positioned for greater roles are second-year forward Natasha Howard and rookie center Natalie Achonwa. \nHoward scored 19 points in 44 minutes off the bench in the Finals, shooting a perfect 8-of-8. The 6-4 Achonwa played in only six of 11 playoff games but averaged 8.0 points during the regular season, shot 55 percent and made the league all-rookie team. Achonwa twice left the Fever to play for the Canadian national team and is expected to do so again next year when the WNBA suspends play for a month. \nUntil then, the Fever can reflect on a season that brought more pleasure than pain. \n\"One thing that I told them in the huddle, there's nothing to hang your head down for,\" Catchings said. \"We played, and we fought, and we did every single thing that we possibly could.\" \nCall Star reporter David Woods at (317) 444-6195.
