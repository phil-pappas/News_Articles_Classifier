Now, Jerry Zgoda of the Minneapolis Star Tribune has some unfortunate news:\nAdChoices There’s no question things have changed dramatically since the team announced his diagnosis in August, back when it Quote: d his doctors saying the cancer was very treatable and curable. Since then there have been changes to the way his body handled the chemotherapy (and maybe how much cancer they’ve found) that have made it life threatening. Everyone involved has gone radio silent because of the family’s request for privacy and federal patient-privacy laws, etc., but between the complete silence, the lack of people visiting as far as I can tell apart from his immediate family and very inner circle while he remains hospitalized here in Minneapolis and the things I’m hearing second-hand, well, none of it is good. I’ll just say this, and this is just my own opinion, if he pulls through this: I doubt very much he’s back this year, it’s probably unlikely he coaches again just because of the stress inherent doing both those jobs and I think there’s a pretty good chance he doesn’t return full time to either job. As far as the franchise goes, that will put them in a holding pattern for some time. I can’t see Glen Taylor allowing Milt Newton and Sam to make a major decision until they know more about Flip’s future and Glen decides who will run his team for the long term. I wouldn’t assume it’ll be Milt and Sam going forward, that’s just for the short term until things become clearer. Sam Mitchell will run the Timberwolves until anything official happens with Saunders, but moments like this are always more about the human than the sport. Flip has had a great career. Let's just cross our fingers and hope there's some way he can continue it in some capacity.\n(h/t NBC Sports for the find)\nMORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you? Sign up for our NBA newsletters.
