I said I would tell you the facts. They are the facts. \n\"Honda have got an agreement with the FIA and myself that we allowed them into F1 supplying engines to one team for the first year, two teams the second, three teams the third. \n\"And they somehow got involved and made a commitment to Ron that he had a veto and he does not want Red Bull now. I think he believes they may be competitors . \n\"Ron has said definitely not as far as he is concerned so I don't know whether his veto will stand up legally. Red Bull could run Honda if Honda agree and they won't agree obviously. They will have an argument with Ron because Ron could sue them.\" \nEcclestone added that British manufacturer Cosworth will be one of two independent engine suppliers to be in Formula One in 2017. \nThe 84-year-old also said that he did not know whether Renault will be in the sport next term. \nThe French manufacturer have signed a letter of intent to purchase a controlling stake in Lotus, but when asked if Renault would be in Formula One beyond this season, Ecclestone said: \"I don't know. They have not made a decision. Lotus have got an entry and could be there without (Renault). They have got a deal with Mercedes actually so Lotus can be there no problem.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T23:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T20:19:59.741+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
