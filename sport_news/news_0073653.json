I can only take 44 (active players to the game), and I have to have all the bases covered.\n“When Tim Brown went down, it affected part of what we do, so we had to cover it other ways. Like I said, it’s unfortunate. It’s not because of his play, it’s because of the situation.”\nCLINCH PARTY\nThe Stampeders (10-3) can officially clinch a playoff spot — it was a foregone conclusion — with a win in Hamilton or a B.C. Lions loss to the Saskatchewan Roughriders.\nIt wasn’t a topic of conversation at McMahon Stadium this week, though.\n“That’s not talked about,” Hufnagel said. “The players understand the situation. They want to just prepare to win a big football game. We’ll count them up at the end of the year and find out where we fall.”\nWith the East Division-leading Ticats on the docket this week and a huge date with the Edmonton Eskimos (9-4) at home next weekend, Stamps defensive end Charleston Hughes knows it’s an important stretch.\n“We’re going to make a statement from here on out, man,” Hughes said. “We can’t slack off at all. The majority of these next couple games are away games, so we have to play the best games we can play, especially because we haven’t had the best away record. We have to play hard, man … at all costs.”\nEXTRA POINTS\nDue to his familiarity with the system from his stint in Calgary last year, it didn’t take long for CB Brandon McDonald to get up to speed, and he’ll step in for Joe Burnett (ankle, out for season) this week … X-rays on LT Garry Williams’ foot “were fine” according to Hufnagel, but Derek Dennis will start on QB Bo Levi Mitchell’s blind-side against the Ticats … WR Lemar Durant (hip flexor) is out this week, meaning veteran Jabari Arthur, who was cut in training camp and re-signed a few weeks later when Simon Charbonneau-Campeau broke his leg, will make his season debut.\nscott.mitchell@sunmedia.ca\nwww.twitter.com/SUNMitchell\nStampeders\nMatt Walter disappointed to be healthy scratch for Calgary Stampeders\nBy Scott Mitchell , Calgary Sun First posted: Wednesday, September 30, 2015 07:55 PM EDT | Updated: Friday, October 02, 2015 08:00 PM EDT\nThe bag of Doritos on Matt Walter’s shoulders continues to grow.\nTearing apart the CIS ranks with the University of Calgary Dinos a few years ago didn’t do much for his CFL draft stock, as the 5-foot-10, 217-pounder fell all the way to the fifth round, forcing the Calgary Stampeders running back to go about proving people wrong ever since.\nNow, a two-game stint as a healthy inactive has increased the size of the chip he’s carrying around.\n“You’ve gotta have trust that the coaches make decisions in the best interests of the team, and I’m a team guy, so that’s how it goes sometimes,” said Walter, at the same time expressing disappointment at not being able to contribute.\nWalter ran for a career-high 110 yards on 20 carries back on Aug. 22 against the Saskatchewan Roughriders but sprained his ankle late in the game.\nWhen Jon Cornish returned to the Stampeders backfield two weeks ago, it was at Walter’s expense.\nStamps GM/head coach John Hufnagel says\n ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://www.twitter.com/SUNMitchell", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-01T07:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T03:53:13.222+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
