Cox/Getty Images) \nATLANTA - Devonta Freeman scored three more touchdowns and the Atlanta Falcons remained unbeaten, romping to a 48-21 victory over the hapless Houston Texans on Sunday. \nFreeman, who took over as the starting running back after rookie Tevin Coleman sustained a rib injury in Week 2, has scored six TDs in the last two games. The Falcons improved to 4-0 for only the fourth time in franchise history. \nFreeman had touchdown runs of 16, 23 and 6 yards. He set up another score with a 44-yard reception. \nNothing went right for the Texans (1-3). Quarterback Ryan Mallett was yanked after the Falcons built a 42-0 lead. Running back Arian Foster made his season debut after tearing his groin early in training camp, but he couldn't find any room to run. \nIn fact, he had the ball knocked out of his hands by one of his own teammates, leading to a Falcons touchdown. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
