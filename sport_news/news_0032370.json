Sharp and Krysten Hall then combined for a block to take a 16-15 lead. \nAlma junior Alyssa Hoyle tied the game 16-16 with a kill, but Siloam Springs pulled back ahead 17-16 on a kill from Sharp to set up Wetzel's game-winning ace. \n\"These girls could have folded after game two,\" said Siloam Springs coach Rose Cheek-Willis. \"I give credit to the girls. They regrouped and laid down the hammer.\" \nSharp led the Lady Panthers with 18 kills, while freshman Ellie Lampton had 15 kills. Freshman setter Chloe Price had 31 assists and 12 digs, while junior Meg Gray had 18 assists. Senior Madisyn Fullerton had 30 digs, while Andrea Lowry had 12 digs. \nHoyle led Alma with 17 kills and 32 digs. Abbye Ostrander had 19 digs and 11 assists for the Airedalettes, while Jordyn Collyar had 30 digs and Madi Brown 17 assists. \n\"We knew we needed to win in three,\" said Alma coach Tiffaney Drinkwitz. \"I hate it for our kids. I'm disappointed for them, but not disappointed in them. They played hard and played with a lot of heart and energy.\" \nSports on 10/16/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:06:43.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
