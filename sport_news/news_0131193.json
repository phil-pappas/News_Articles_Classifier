Hawkins will undergo surgery Tuesday but is expected to return to practice in early November. \n\"Praying for my bro,\" teammate Alex Poythress tweeted. \nHawkins broke the bone in his right hand below the middle finger during Sunday's practice, said Feldhaus, who spoke with Hawkins Monday. \n\"He was reaching for a steal and he pulled his hand back,\" the Madison Central coach said. \"It was something like his hand got caught in the arm pit part of the jersey. It sounded like a freak thing to me.\" \nHawkins tried to play after trainers taped two of his fingers together, Feldhaus said. \n\"I'm tough, but I could tell something was wrong,\" Feldhaus said Hawkins told him. \nHawkins expected doctors to insert two screws in the affected area, Feldhaus said. \"I'm just hoping this won't set him back too much,\" the Madison Central coach added. \nA backup his first two seasons at UK, Hawkins came into preseason practice feeling like he could assume a more prominent role. UK Coach John Calipari had supported that belief. \n\"He's telling me next year (2015-16) I'll have a chance to get on the court,\" Hawkins said in early September. \"And hopefully, this is the year I'm able to get on the court a lot.\" \nIn a UK news release, Calipari said Hawkins had made a good start on gaining a bigger role. \n\"He was so much more confident, so much more skilled,\" Calipari said. \"There was no doubt he was in the rotation, and now he's just got to get back and stay in shape. We're looking forward to getting him back in November.\" Jerry Tipton: (859) 231-3227. Twitter: @JerryTipton.
