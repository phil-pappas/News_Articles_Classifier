(Photo: Joseph Maiorana, USA TODAY Sports)\n807 CONNECT 71 TWEET LINKEDIN 15 COMMENT EMAIL MORE PredictionMachine.com’s Director of Research and Analytics, John Ewing, takes a look at what the College Football Playoffs could look like through 50,000 simulations of Football Four’s most likely four-team playoff. Follow John on Twitter @JohnEwing for more notes from his analysis and to let him know what else you may like to see with these projections.\nHow this works The Predictalator uses current rosters and strength-of-schedule and efficiency-adjusted team and player stats (weighted slightly more toward recent games), to play every game 50,000 times before it's actually played. For this analysis, we are tracking how likely a team is to make it to any level of the College Football Playoff.\nFootball Four Playoff Summary What if Oregon isn’t good?\nThe Ducks have been one of the elite teams in the country over the last half decade, but a 42-point loss at home to Utah is cause for concern. Last year’s runner-up doesn’t play defense. Anyone can score on Oregon. The defense has yielded 40.8 points per game (117th in nation), and the offense is struggling, relative to past performance.\nThe Ducks do not have a championship-caliber team (29th in our Power Rankings ), and the wins banked by Michigan State and Utah should be weighted accordingly. The Spartans and Utes are currently in the four-team Playoff , but neither should get too comfortable.\nOhio State has already jumped Michigan State for the top seed in the Football Four panel's Playoff Projection. The Buckeyes square off against Utah in the first semifinal. The Utes are good, and their win against Oregon was one of the top story lines of Week 4 in college football, but against a true playoff team like the Buckeyes, Utah will be exposed.\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. Urban Meyer’s team is incredibly balanced. The Buckeyes have a top 20 offense and perhaps the best defense (allowing 8.3 points per game) in the country led by the potential first pick in next year’s NFL draft. Utah would lose to Ohio State 82.1% percent of the time by an average projected score of 30-20.\nWho will face the Buckeyes in the championship game?\nOle Miss didn’t have its A-game in a shaky win against Vanderbilt last week. The hangover after an emotional win against Alabama almost cost the Rebels their seat at the table. A focused Mississippi team is dangerous, and that is the squad Michigan State faces in the second semifinal.\nThe Spartans have been outgained in terms of total yards in three consecutive games. Michigan State is outside the top 10 in our Power Rankings . Against the best team from the SEC, the Spartans get rolled. Ole Miss wins 89.6% of the time with an average projected score of 37-23.\nIt’s Ohio State against Mississippi for the title. Ohio State’s offense hasn’t found its rhythm and Ole Miss ranks in the top 12 in every offensive and defensive efficiency category, the only team in the nation that can make that claim.\nAfter 50,000 simulations, the most likely national champion is the Mississippi. Mississippi wins 56.8% of all the simulated tournaments. In the most likely national championship game, Ole Miss defeats Ohio State 59.3% of the time by an average score of 29-27.\nLaquon Treadwell (1) and Mississippi project as the College Football Playoff winner in new simulations. (Photo: Rogelio V. Solis, AP)\nBased on the analysis, here is the projected College Football Playoff bracket:\nSemifinals No. 1 seed Ohio State vs. No. 4 seed Utah\nOhio State wins 82.1% of the time by an average score of 30-20.\nNo. 2 seed Michigan State vs. No. 3 seed Mississippi\nOle Miss wins 89.6% of the time by an average score of 37-23.\nNational Championship No. 1 seed Ohio State vs. No. 3 seed Mississippi\nOle Miss wins 59.3% of the time by an average score of 29-27.\nOdds for each team to advance to and win the championship: Ohio State 38.3%; Utah 3.2%; Michigan State 1.7%; Mississippi 56.8%.\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST Five games you can't miss in Week 5 of college football | 02:25 USA TODAY Sports' George Schroeder offers up the five games you can't miss this week.\n1 of 34 COLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST SEC Whip Around: Will Auburn bounce back? | 02:50 Reporters from around the nation look ahead to Week 5 in the SEC.\n2 of 34 COLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST College Football Week 4 Snap Judgments | 01:54 USA TODAY Sports' Nicole Auerbach offers perspective on the biggest story lines from Week 4.
