Nolito's sixth goal of the season left him level with Ronaldo and Benzema, and two goals behind Neymar. \nCelta's win left Madrid as leader on goal difference after its 3-0 victory over Levante on Saturday. Celta is second, followed by Barcelona in third after the defending champions routed Rayo Vallecano 5-2, also on Saturday. \n\"We think we can beat anyone, that we can go to any ground and show that we can win because we are a solid team that works hard and is dangerous,\" said coach Eduardo Berizzo, whose Celta side stunned Barcelona 4-1 last month. \nVillarreal, which entered the round in first place, fell all the way to fifth, two points off the pace. \nAtletico Madrid moved into fourth on goal difference with a 2-0 win at Real Sociedad, which has just one win this season. \nITALY \nFiorentina stayed top of Serie A despite losing 2-1 at Napoli after title rival Inter Milan was held to a 0-0 draw by Juventus. \nBoth Inter and Juventus hit the woodwork and had several other chances in an entertaining match at a packed San Siro. It was only the second match of the 80 games played in Serie A this season to finish goalless. \nIn Naples, Lorenzo Insigne's stellar start to the season continued as the forward opened the scoring in the first minute of the second half with his sixth goal of the campaign, setting a new personal record. \nInter is third, a point behind Fiorentina and below Roma on goal difference. \nNapoli moved into fourth place, three points behind Fiorentina, and above Lazio on goal difference after the capital side lost 2-1 at Sassuolo — which also now has 15 points. \nAtalanta was a point further back after easing past Carpi 3-0. \nENGLAND \nGeorginio Wijnaldum scored four goals as Newcastle recorded its first win of the Premier League season in style, crushing Norwich 6-2 at St. James' Park. \nThe Dutch international scored twice and Ayoze Perez added a third as Newcastle led 3-2 at the end of an action-packed first half, with Dieumerci Mbokani and Nathan Redmond replying for the visitors. \nWijnaldum followed up by scoring two more after the break, along with a 64th minute strike by Aleksandar Mitrovic. \nSteve McClaren's Newcastle remains in the relegation zone, but moves from last place to 18th in the standings — two points behind promoted Bournemouth. \nThe win also sets them up perfectly for next weekend's derby trip to fellow strugglers Sunderland. \nManchester City leads the Premier League standings, two points above Arsenal and Manchester United. \nFRANCE \nMarseille players were booed off the pitch after being held 1-1 at home by Lorient in the French league as the nine-time champions' dismal season continued. \nMarseille failed to hold its lead when Lorient striker Benjamin Moukandjo equalized for the visitors in the 37th minute at the Stade Velodrome. \nThe hosts dominated but lacked a cutting edge after Michy Batshuayi scored from the penalty spot in the 22nd to move to the top of the league scoring table with seven goals. Hatem Ben Arfa later joined the Belgium striker as the joint top scorer with a superb goal in Nice's 4-1 win at Rennes. \nMarseille has now failed to win its last six matches in all competitions and is just four points above the relegation zone — or some 17 points behind league leader Paris Saint-Germain. Marseille's last win came in September — a 3-0 victory at Groningen in the Europa League. \nGERMANY \nLeon Andreasen scored with his arm to give Hannover a controversial 1-0 win at Cologne, denying the home side the chance to go fourth. \nCologne had the better of the first half but the visitors went ahead in the 38th when Andreasen knocked the ball in with his right arm after a corner. The goal was given despite the home side's protests. \n\"It's annoying,\" Cologne general manager Joerg Schmadtke said. \"If 48,700 people can see it, the four match officials have to see it too.\" \nDaniel Didavi's second half-strike was enough for Stuttgart to climb off the bottom with a 1-0 win over promoted Ingolstadt in the late game. \nThat too was an irregular goal with TV replays showing Didavi was in an offside position before he deflected Florian Klein's shot in the 59th minute. \nIt was Stuttgart's first win at home after four defeats and it lifted the side to 15th, with Augsburg now bottom. \nBayern Munich leads by seven points after starting the season with a Bundesliga record nine victories. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:29:58.642+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
