(AP) - While many colleges bring dogs and puppies to campus to help students de-stress during finals, Keene State College is taking a different approach.\nThe college has a \"Paws 2 Play\" program designed to help freshmen make the transition to college. Every Thursday night through the fall semester, community volunteers bring dogs to various residence halls, where they interact with students, faculty members and staff.\nBrian Quigley, director of the college's counseling center, says the first eight weeks of school are \"make it or break it\" time for freshmen as they adjust to college life. Close to 350 students attended the sessions in the first three weeks.\nThe program's partners include Monadnock therapy Pets and the local Humane Society.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
