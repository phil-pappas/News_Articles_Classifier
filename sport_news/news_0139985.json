Brexit, Hollande said, was a \"serious hypothesis\" that could not be ignored.\nThe French leader promised, too, to stand by Greece as it grapples with rising numbers of migrants.\n\"Greece is our frontier,\" he added, pledging 60 French experts to reinforce EU border agency Frontex, helping it to staff emergency registration centres across the region.\n\"We must cooperate to protect our borders,\" Hollande said, adding that those who did not meet refugee criteria \"should be turned back.\"\nThe International Organisation for Migration said Greece had 48,000 migrants and refugees landing on its shores in the past five days, the highest number of weekly arrivals so far.\nHollande also vowed to support Greece in an address to the parliament, becoming the third French president to speak before the chamber after General Charles de Gaulle in 1963 and Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008.\nOn his arrival in Athens on Thursday, Hollande recalled the \"bold decisions\" taken by Tsipras, who in July agreed to more public spending cuts in return for a three-year, 86-billion-euro ($96-billion) EU bailout to prevent Greece crashing out of the eurozone.\n\"We did everything, France and Greece... for Greece to remain in Europe and that Europe show solidarity with Greece.\n\"And today, that is the message that I will continue to carry.\"\nTsipras on Friday acknowledged that Hollande \"was among those who persuaded me that I had to accept\" the July bailout.\nHollande has also pleaded for a renegotiation via an interest deferral of the soaring Greek public debt, which is equal to around 200 percent of the country's entire annual economic output.\nGreece is undergoing a review by EU-IMF auditors after pushing through parliament another round of unpopular tax measures.\nA dispute on home foreclosures arose with the creditors on Thursday, and Tsipras lashed out on Friday against \"absurd and extreme neo-liberal interventions\" that threatened to undermine the bailout agreement.\n\"Such interventions threaten social peace...Greece signed a deal that it will honour. It did not sign a pact to surrender its sovereignty and destroy its social cohesion,\" the Greek leader said.\nHollande said he supported a Greek request to the European Union for a credit extension of 330 million euros in 2016 to cope with the influx of migrants, with more than 500,000 people arriving in Greece since January.\nThe French president has also pledged to encourage the French to invest in Greece.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T18:27:14.965+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
