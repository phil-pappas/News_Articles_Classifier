Unveiled in 2013, the retention pond is part of the Southeast Atlanta Green Infrastructure Initiative , a $66 million dollar plan that also includes stormwater storage vaults and other flood control measures.\nThe vast majority of property owners, about 20, already have sold their homes to Atlanta, according to the Department of Watershed Management, but four or five property owners have yet to reach a deal with the city. Some of the hold-outs say the city hasn’t offered enough money for their property, or convinced them that there’s no other way forward.\nSep. 15, 2015 - Atlanta - 93 year old Mattie Jackson (left), who said she plans to stand her ground, is comforted by Tanya Washington (right). Tanya Washington, a law professor who lives on Atlanta Ave, hosted Peoplestown residents who have decided not to leave their homes for a rally and press conference. 93 year old Mattie Jackson and the remaining residents on her block held the press conference to declare that they will refuse to leave their homes despite the City’s threat to demolish their homes and build a park and a pond. BOB ANDRES / BANDRES@AJC.COM In recent months, much of the focus has turned to 93-year-old Mattie Jackson, a Summerhill resident who has lived in the neighborhood for decades. City officials have been in back-and-forth talks with Jackson’s family and a representative, but the elderly woman has made it clear that she doesn’t want to move.\nMonday, she was among about a dozen residents who descended on Reed’s office, following weeks of rallies and appearances at Atlanta council meetings to speak out on the issue.
