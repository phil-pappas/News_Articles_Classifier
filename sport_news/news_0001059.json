See the Winners here Related Tags WPTZ Top 5 Plays of the Week \nKEN: THIS WEEK'S TOP PLAYS OF THE WEEK GAVE US TWO FOOTBALL PLAYS THAT REVERSED SKATE. ONE OF THEM IN FAST FORWARD. IT HAD A CATAMOUNT LITERALLY ON SKATES AND A HEADS UP PLAY FROM ON THE PITCH, WHICH IS ALSO WHERE WE SAW A STATE RECORD FALL. HERE'S THIS WEEK'S TOP 5 PLAYS. WE START IN MINNESOTA. THAT'S WHERE MARIO PASKARICH WAS WHEN HE REDIRECT'S HIS OWN REBOUND SHOT IN FOR THE PRETTY GOAL. DEFENSE MAKES PLAYS TOO. WOODSTOCK'S DANIEL NORRIS IS GONNA JUMP THE ROUTE. RIGHT AFTER HE SCORED AN OFFENSIVE TD, HE TAKES THIS ONE ALL THE WAY BACK FOR THE PICK 6. UVM WOMEN'S SOCCER DID HAVE A GOOD GAME VERSE MAINE WHEN THEY GOT TWO GOALS FROM CAITE GREEN. THE HEADS UP GOAL THE FIRST OF TWO IN THE WIN. THE NUMBER TWO PLAY MADE ABBY MCKEARIN. NUMBER 1 IN THE VERMONT STATE RECORD BOOKS, THE STATE'S ALL-TIME SOCCER SCORER WITH A PLAY OF THE WEEK-TYPE SHOT. ONLY OUT DONE BY BELLOWS FALLS' CHRIS MCKEEN IS THERE WITH THE HOPS FOR THE PICK, NEARLY TAKING IT ALL THE WAY TO THE HOUSE, BUT CLINCHES THE PLAY OF THE WEEK. AN ENTIRE NEW SET OF FIVE PLAYS COMING UP ON MONDAY. METS PULL IT OUT AGAINST THE DODGERS. THEY WIN 3-2. BRING ON THE CUBS.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:39:22.264+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
