He's generally the only member of the nearly 100-member Stagg marching band wearing football pants.\nHe's also the lone member that plays tuba.\n\"I run over from the end zone to the band and take off my jersey and shoulder pads,\" Haack said of the process. \"Usually, another student is responsible for having my instrument ready. It's something I really enjoy doing.\"\nHaack spends approximately six minutes entertaining the crowd with the marching band before he has to throw back on his shoulder pads, jersey and helmet.\nFootball notes: Rich South coach Andre Morgan upset at Crete-Monee Pat Disabato Rich South coach Andre Morgan has been around the game long enough to figure out when an opposing coach is running up the score.\nMorgan insisted Crete-Monee coach John Konecki was guilty of doing that during an 80-6 win Friday over the Stars.\nThe Warriors led 66-0 at halftime.\n\"It was very unprofessional,\"...\nRich South coach Andre Morgan has been around the game long enough to figure out when an opposing coach is running up the score.\nMorgan insisted Crete-Monee coach John Konecki was guilty of doing that during an 80-6 win Friday over the Stars.\nThe Warriors led 66-0 at halftime.\n\"It was very unprofessional,\"...\n(Pat Disabato) So, how does it feel to have to carry a 45-pound tuba after spending 24 minutes blocking opposing defenders?\n\"It's my job,\" the 6-foot-1, 250-pound Haack said. \"I play football and I play an instrument. I love it. I do what I've got to do.\"\nWhat Haack also likes to do is hit the books. He boasts a 4.17 grade point average and scored 32 on the ACT. While the senior hasn't entirely given up on the prospects of playing college football, he's leaning heavily toward exclusively concentrating on academics. He's yet to decide where he'll attend college, though he has a preference for larger colleges such as Illinois, Indiana, Northern Illinois or UIC.\nHaack intends on majoring in biology.\n\"I might make the effort and apply at a few Ivy League schools,\" he said. \"Getting accepted to one of those schools is a whole other story.\"\nHaack has started on the varsity since his sophomore season. While he loves playing football, he also enjoys the bond forged between linemen.\nStagg senior Brian Haack shines on line and in marching band By Pat Disabato / Daily Southtown Stagg senior Brian Haack is a three-year starter on the school's football team offensive line and is a member of the school's marching band. Stagg senior Brian Haack is a three-year starter on the school's football team offensive line and is a member of the school's marching band. (By Pat Disabato / Daily Southtown) \"We don't get the glory of other positions, but we're brothers on the line,\" he said. \"It's something special.\"\nAccording to Stagg coach Mike Fahey, Haack is special in his own right.\n\"Brian has found a way to balance football and playing in the band,\" said Fahey, whose Chargers are 1-4. \"He's a smart kid and he's tough. He's one of our best linemen. He's a kid who likes to stay busy.\"\nWhen football practice wraps up on Tuesdays and Thursdays, Haack spends two additional hours practicing with the marching band.\nThen, of course, he has to find time to study and maintain his grades.\nIt's a process he's been committed to since his freshman year.\n\"I wouldn't change anything,\" said Haack, who started playing football as a 7-year-old with the Palos Stars youth program. \"I love my school. I appreciate the cooperation of my coaches to allow me to play in the marching band. My teammates are very encouraging. The directors of the marching band allow me to be late for practice. I'm grateful for all of that.\"\nOnce the football season ends, Haack shifts his attention to wrestling. He competes in the heavyweight class.\nHowever, he still practices the tuba in preparation for playing spring concerts at school.\nSo what makes a kid want to play the tuba?\n\"I really don't know the answer to that,\" said Haack, who began playing the instrument in sixth grade at Palos South School. \"Tuba isn't the most popular choice. I was dead set on playing percussion. My second choice was the tuba. It's big and loud. I tried it once and fell in love with it.\"\npdisabato@tribpub.com\nTwitter: @disabato\nCopyright Â© 2015, Daily Southtown Sports University of Illinois at Chicago", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-560b1df6/turbine/ct-sta-football-notes-st-0930-20150929", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c8084/turbine/ct-ct-sta-football-stagg-brian-haac-2-jpg-20150930", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560c8233/turbine/ct-sta-football-stagg-brian-haack-st-1001-20150930"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:57:40.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
