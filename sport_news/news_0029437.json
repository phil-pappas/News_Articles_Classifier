Anderson and Ronnie Hillman . \nBibbs has played in seven preseason games with the Broncos, rushing for 111 yards and three TDs on 25 carries. \nHe spent four weeks of his rookie season on Denver's active roster last year after signing as an undrafted free agent out of Colorado State. \nBibbs was also the fourth-string running back at CSU but when he got his chance there, he broke the school's single-season record for yards rushing (1,741), TDs (31) and points (186) in his lone season with the Rams in 2013 after playing in junior college. \nHis 31 TDs led the nation. \n\"I was fourth string there and I kept grinding away and grinding away. Then they gave me the opportunity and I took off with it,\" Bibbs said. \"This just reminds me a lot of that, you know, coming in fourth string and just grinding it out and grinding it out and grinding it out and once the opportunity comes just be ready for it. \n\"That's what I've always been my whole life is an opportunist, and when the opportunities came to me I've always made great of them.\" \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \nFollow AP Pro Football Writer Arnie Melendrez Stapleton on Twitter: http://twitter.com/arniestapleton \n   ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T20:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T21:05:09.653+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
