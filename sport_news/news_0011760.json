And for a brief second, the 18-year-old who made the Pittsburgh Penguins out of training camp with his energetic play decided to finally act his age. \nThe rookie forward raised his arms in triumph, saw the nearest pane of glass and did a vertical belly flop in celebration. \n“I didn’t know what I was going to do,” Sprong said. “I saw the glass close by and decided to jump on it.” \nSprong’s first NHL goal provided the emotional high point of a 2-0 win over the Senators on Thursday. Evgeni Malkin picked up his first goal in seven months and Marc-Andre Fleury stopped 22 shots for his 39th career shutout, as the Penguins put a decisive halt to the franchise’s worst start in a decade. \n“I don’t think we had a full consistent game and tonight it felt really good from the start until the end,” Fleury said. \nAnderson made 34 saves, but the Senators failed to muster significant momentum a night after dropping seven goals on Columbus. Ottawa went 0 for 3 on the power play and rarely tested Fleury over the final two periods, as the Senators lost on the road for the first time in four tries. \n“I thought we were a little flat,” Ottawa defenseman Marc Methot said. “There’s only so much you can do when you don’t have the legs beneath you.” \nThe Penguins came in scuffling after the franchise’s worst start in a decade, managing all of three goals during an 0-3 stretch that left their stars frustrated and head coach Mike Johnston imploring them — again — to shoot the puck more often. \nFor a night anyway, the message appeared to get through. \nFresh after being given a day off and facing a team that must have gotten weary celebrating so often during a 7-3 dismantling of the Blue Jackets the night before, Pittsburgh wasted little time, playing with the kind of tempo it lacked for much of the first week of the season. \nThe Penguins sent 16 pucks at Anderson during the opening 20 minutes. None found the back of the net but the string of consistently aggressive shifts built momentum that finally crested with the team’s first lead of the year. Malkin took a lead pass from Patric Hornqvist and beat Anderson with a wrist shot from just inside the right circle 23 seconds into the second period for his first goal since March 6.
