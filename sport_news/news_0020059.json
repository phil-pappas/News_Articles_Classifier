By Sandy Ringer The Seattle Times \nChris Leverenz believes her top-ranked Auburn Riverside volleyball team can win a second straight Class 3A state championship next month. \nOne key will be whether the players believe it, too. \n“All of the pieces are there,” she said. “It just depends on whether the pieces show up on the important dates. One difference between last year’s team and this year’s is their level of confidence…We’ll see how they play in the pressure moments.” \nLast year’s club played with a no-doubt kind of attitude. Even when the Ravens trailed Columbia River 2-0 in the championship match of the West Central/Southwest 3A District tournament last year, they knew they were capable of coming back and they did just that to preserve an unbeaten record and set the stage for a perfect run at state. Most Read Stories Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. \nRiverside lost two all-state players in setter Carson Heilborn (the Gatorade Player of the Year) and outside hitter Precious Atafua, both big reasons for that kind of swagger. Five others graduated as well. \n“We lost seven players, but a program is what makes your team,” said Leverenz, who has been the school’s only head volleyball coach. \nAnd this year’s team is more balanced with three players regularly posting double-digit kills – seniors Kasey Holand and Kiana Drumheller and sophomore Calley Heilborn, Carson’s sister. Each pounded 17 in the 3-1 victory over Enumclaw Tuesday night that raised the Ravens’ SPSL 3A record to 9-0 and their overall mark to 20-2, with both of those losses coming at the Linda Sheridan Classic in Spokane a couple of weeks ago. \nLeverenz said that tournament experience should pay dividends when post-season play rolls around, starting with a district tournament likely to include No. 2 Columbia River and No. 10 Kennedy Catholic, among other talented teams. \n“Spokane was really good for us,” she said. “It showed us what we needed to work on.” \nJunior Lauren Smith, the JV setter last year, has amply filled Carson Heilborn’s shoes after a lot of hard work over the summer, according to Leverenz. \n“She’s improved a ton,” the coach said. \nJunior Kaytlin Heaslip, a transfer from Bonney Lake, has also given the team a boost, especially on defense. \nLeverenz said her players realize they have a collective target on their backs as defending champs. As far as the No. 1 ranking goes, she knows it’s a sign of respect, but means nothing else. \n“The only ranking I care about is where we end up (at state),” she said. \nMOUNT RAINIER MAKING A CLIMB \nIt’s been a climb for Mount Rainier since moving from the 3A Seamount League to SPSL 4A in 2010. \nThe Rams didn’t win a league match until 2012. \nBut they are currently enjoying a view from the top of the North Division as the last of the unbeaten at 5-0. Mount Rainier beat Kentwood for the first time Tuesday to get there, 3-2, handing the Conquerors their first league loss. \nThat was a big boost of confidence for his players, coach Tom Well said. \n“They’re starting to believe,” he said. \nA nonleague victory over Lake Washington Wednesday stretched their winning streak to six matches. \nThe Rams have their eye on that first division title, but still have plenty of work to do with remaining matches again Kentridge, Beamer, Kent-Meridian and Tahoma. All but Kentridge are in the top half of the standings. Sandy Ringer : on Twitter: @sandyringer1 .
