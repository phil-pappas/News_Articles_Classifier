When the Varsity races began the sun was just high enough to dance through the trees, mimicking the runners as they made their way through the 5k course. College Park’s Adam Breaux led the boys out of the woods and finished first with a time of 15:16.18, but The Woodlands would take the district championship with a total score of 23 and a time of 1:18:07.99 (average time of 15:37.60). “I’m just always looking to streamline and improve, but anytime you can win a district championship that is great,” The Woodlands coach Juris Green said. “It’s always nice to be the big dog in the backyard. We had six in the top ten and I think we should have had seven, to be honest—not trying to be greedy, I think that’s a trait of any coach: yea, we ran well but where can we improve?” Every member of the Highlanders’ team finished in the top fifteen—Daniel Golden, Noah Wells, Matthew McClellan, William Hunsdale, Matthew Henderson, and Nicholas Enochs finished second, third, fifth, sixth, seventh, and ninth respectively. Nicholas Hawley rounded out the top runners, finishing in 15 th place. The Cavaliers finished second with 49 points and a total time of 1:19:29.80 (avg time of 15:53.96). Breaux finished first, while teammates Allessandro Topini, Robert Kraus, and Zackery Williams came in eight, 10th, and 13 th place (respectively). Oak Ridge came in third with 73 points and a total time of 1:21:13.37 (average time of 16:14.68). The War Eagles had three runners finish in the top 15—Theo Goff came in fourth with a time of 15:40.79, while Berry King came in 11 th (15:58.66) and Juan Alvarez came in 12 th (15:59.02). Atascocita’s Wothington Moore was the Eagle’s only top 15 finishes with a time of 16:07.18. As a team the Eagles were fourth with 103 points and a total time of 1:23:04.74 (avg time of 16:36.95). Kingwood came in fifth with 109 points and a time of 1:23:26.58 (avg time of 16:41.32), while Summer Creek was finished at the bottom with 185 points and a time of 1:30:28.40 (avg time of 18:05.68). While the King Wood boys finished at the bottom of the pack, the Lady Mustangs dominated the course—taking home their 27th district title and their fourth straight. “There is definitely pressure on us,: Kingwood coach Christie Burleson said. “I think in any sport pressure can be both good and bad. There definitely a lot of negatives, but there is also a lot of positives. The kids are just constantly reaching for that level of excellence and it pushes them.” The Kingwood’s Abby Guidry was the top finisher with a time of 18:19.84, while her teammate Erin Gallagher came in second with a time of 18:22.38. “I thought [Guidry] ran well,” Burleson said. “She is very dependable and she had a solid race. I think she has better races in front of her, but she was solid.” All seven Lady Mustangs finished in the top ten, with Olivia Thompson, Amy Berg, Jasmine Amo, Jessica Hergott, and McKenzie Clark finishing fourth, fifth, sixth, eighth, and ninth respectively. The Kingwood girls totaled 18 points with a time of 1:33:30.49 (avg time of 18:42.10). Five Lady Highlanders would finish in the top 15: Lourdes Vivas (third), Emily Mills (seventh), Emily Gonzales (12 th ), Adriana Iademarco (14 th ), Liz Davidson (15 th ). The Woodlands’ 51 point total was good enough for a second place team finish, with a total time of 1:36:45.79 (avg time of 19:21.16). The Lady Cavaliers would post the third highest point total with 70 and a total time of 1:38:25.34 (avg time of 19:41.07). Brittney Prince (10 th ), Sarah Batton (11 th ), and Georgia Burner (13 th ) finished in the top 15 for College Park. Top 15 (Boys) 1. Breaux, Adam CP………15:16.18 2.
