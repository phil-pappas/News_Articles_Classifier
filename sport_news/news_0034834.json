But when he discusses the race he focuses on the immense challenge the race presents.\n“Do you know what I find the most amazing stat of my Syracuse career is?” Hearn said. “I’ve started many times on the front row, including the poles, and I’ve got my wins. But when I ask people how many times I’ve finished on the lead lap in the 37 years I’ve raced there in the Super DIRT Week Big-Block Modified race at Syracuse, they usually guess around 26 or 27 or something like that. The truth is that I have finished on the lead lap just 12 times.\n“That stat doesn’t make me look too good but due to fuel mileage, running out of gas, tire wear, engine and other problems, the number of times I’ve finished on the lead lap is just 12. That’s amazing. That just goes to show how hard it is to win at Syracuse. It’s very hard for sure.”\nHearn arrives with his fellow DIRT.car Big Block Modified competitors at another NAPA Super DIRT Week this week. But this will not be like any of the other 43 previous editions of the autumn classic, held on the huge and fast one-mile New York State Fairgrounds oval known as the “Moody Mile.” This will be the final year that NAPA Super DIRT Week will be contested there.\nDue to a revamping of the state fairgrounds, the track and the grandstand will be eliminated. NAPA Super DIRT Week will move in 2016 to the still-to-be-constructed Central New York Raceway Park one-half mile oval located in Hastings, which is in Oswego county, north of Syracuse.\nHearn’s wins in the Syracuse 200 came in 1985, ’90, ’91, ’93, ’95 and 2012. He sat on the pole there in 1981, ’83, ’89, ’91, ’99 and 2002.\nHearn has been competing at Syracuse since 1978, when he was top rookie of the Big Block Modified race, finishing eighth. His success at Syracuse has stood the test of time.\n“The thing I’m most proud of and the most significant thing to me is after all these years, I’m still relevant at Syracuse,” said Hearn of Sussex, N.J. “Everyone still has me on their radar screens to be a strong contender going into this year’s Super DIRT Week.”\nHearn also has been successful in the DIRT.car 358 Modified “Salute to the Troops” 150 run at Super DIRT Week. He won in 1986, ’89, ’90, 2007, ’13 and ’14. His six wins tie him with Billy Decker for most career victories in the race.\n“I guess Billy and I will have one last chance to settle the tiebreaker,” Hearn said with a laugh.\nThis year’s event is bittersweet for Hearn and the Super DIRT Week community as they run the “Moody Mile” for the last time. It’s the only one-mile track these cars run on all year.\nCan NAPA Super DIRT Week keep its shine and luster in the post New York State Fairgrounds era?\n“It depends 100 percent on how well things go at the new venue,” Hearn said. “The state has pledged monetary support and will invest in Super DIRT Week going forward. We’ll see. But you can never duplicate the success of the mile. It will not be the same but we can still have a great event with the new venue and also the satellite races that we have always run at other tracks during Super DIRT Week. Those will still be big too.\nThis final race at the “Moody Mile” is bound to stir a mix of emotions.\n“As far as how I’ll feel when I’m leaving Syracuse after the race this Sunday, I don’t know how I’ll feel at that moment,” Hearn said. “A lot will depend on how Sunday’s race goes for me. I almost sense in a strange way that it will be a big relief. I’ve left Syracuse and driven home to New Jersey over the years with a lot more headaches than joy. It is very emotional, frustrating. You get the highest of highs at Syracuse and the lowest of lows.\n“I just guess that my thoughts are that throughout my entire career at the one-mile track at Syracuse, I’ve had consistency over a very long period of time. That shows how dedicated that I’ve been and how very hard I’ve tried to achieve success whenever I’ve gone to race at Syracuse. Winning at Syracuse does not make a career but it certainly puts the icing on the cake.”\nHearn will speak about the history of racing at the New York State Fairgrounds “Moody Mile” at 10:30 a.m. Nov. 14 as part of a daylong event to be hosted at the International Motor Racing Research Center at Watkins Glen. The event is free to the public. Hearn will be joined by Super DIRT Week founder Glenn Donnelly, veteran Super DIRT Week race announcer Joe Marotta, DIRT.car Northeast director Jeff Hachmann and race historian/author Dr. Gary George.\n“That will be very intriguing and interesting,” Hearn said. “When it first went down we didn’t yet know what the future would hold for the race at Syracuse. And as it now turns out the research center event will take place right after the last Syracuse race so that will be very interesting.”\nNAPA Super DIRT Week XLIV “The Finale at The Fairgrounds” runs Thursday through Sunday.
