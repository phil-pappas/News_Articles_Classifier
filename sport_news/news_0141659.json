Matthew Mercer takes the snap, sends the quick pass to Will Patton, who turns that short pass into a 20 yard gain before finally being brought down.On the goal line Mercer keeps this one for the sneak and a 1 yard touchdown to take a 8 nothing lead.Howard's on offense and the CCS defense looked like a brick wall most of the game stopping everything.CCS back on offense. Brandon Mason takes the direct snap, finds the corner, turns on the speed and dives in the end zone.That is 15 nothing CCS.More CCS TJ Smith getting the ball this time, and he takes it outside for the 15 yard touchdown run.That was 22 nothing all in the first quarter. CCS went on to win 57 to 0.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:56:24.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
