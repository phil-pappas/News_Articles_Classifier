While most are grape-based, this gem is distilled from the essence of fall: apple or pear juice, typically. And while the cider brandy dates to the 16th century, it wasn't until the 19th century, when the phylloxera pest destroyed most of France's vineyards that it was accepted as a beverage outside the farming communities.\nCognac and armagnac grab the attention in this category and are more broadly consumed globally, but the apple brandy Calvados produced in this tiny northwest region of France makes for a lovely fall sipper. Deep amber in color, it's aged for many years and comes in at about 40 to 45 percent alcohol. Some affectionately call it one of the best kept secrets in the spirit world, due its ability to soften and smooth out over time. French oak barrel aging lends nutty aromas and flavors of caramel and vanilla to the brandy while intensifying the essence of apple.\nYou can identify the length of aging by the brandy labeling system of symbols; in Calvados' case, there are tiny apples, with three representing the longest aged product. It can be enjoyed either as an aperitif or as a digestif, typically sipped from a large bulb-shaped glass.\nHaving a little fun with Calvados isn't difficult, especially when the weather cools down and it provides warmth from the inside. Rather than delegating it to a before or after meal beverage, try sipping it from a simple straight-sided white wine glass as a stand-alone drink. The glass distributes the aromas more broadly, toning down that strong hit of alcohol on the nose common while sipping from a snifter.\nA few top producers to consider:\nRoger Groult\nUp in the hills of the Pays d'Auge sits the Roger Groult family distillery. For five generations, the Groults have been producing their Calvados products in a number of bottlings of varied ages. Their Calvados Pays d'Auge ages for three years and tastes of ripe pears, golden honey, pine nuts and hot apple pie. $35-$45\nChristian Drouin Coeur de Lion Selection Calvados\nThis Calvados is smooth as silk. It's a wonderful aperitif or to sip, paired with a rich blue cheese or a fruit tart. The rich texture tempers the alcohol, making it inviting on its own, as well. Deep amber in color, this one is rich and satisfying. $35\nBerneroy Fine Calvados\nBerneroy presents with wonderful aromatics of fresh apples and caramel. It's made in a fresher style and can be enjoyed straight up or even on ice. Bright gold in color, it glistens and begs for another hearty and warming sip. $20\nLaura Levy Shatkin is a freelance writer.\nPrivacy Policy ", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-56257dbe/turbine/sc-drink-calvados-food-1023-20151019"], "published": "2015-10-20T02:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:04:16.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
