Brooks, Star Correspondent 11:32 p.m. EDT October 23, 2015 Bishop Chatard vs. Brebeuf high school football sectional (Photo: Varsity Views) 1 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nBrebeuf Jesuit had the ball at the Bishop Chatard 40-yard line with 90 seconds left. The Braves were trailing 20-14 but had just converted a first down and appeared to have momentum. \nBut as it did all night Friday, the Chatard defense stepped up. \nChatard’s Max McGinnis came up with his second sack of the night on first down, and teammate Charlie Gleaves followed by grabbing a tipped pass out of the air on the next play to secure the Class 3A No. 5 Trojans’ 20-14 win over the No. 9 Braves in the sectional opener for both teams. \n“I was just trying to go after (the ball), go get it,” Gleaves said. “It was a play that was going to change the game. I wanted to make it. We pride ourselves on bending but not breaking. We gave it all we got and came out with the win.” \nChatard was actually outgained 279-227 in total yards, in part because of a monster effort from Brebeuf quarterback Luke Iffert. The junior threw for 152 yards and two scores and continually scrambled around Trojans defenders for 106 rushing yards. \nBut when Chatard needed the stops, they got them. \n“That’s a pretty good team,” said Chatard coach Vince Lorenzano, whose team beat Brebeuf 27-17 in the season opener. “Beating them twice in one year is tough to do. They’re well-coached, a really physical team (with) really great quarterback play.” \nBishop Chatard vs. Brebeuf high school football sectional (Photo: Varsity Views) \nChatard punted on its first possession, but the Trojans defense immediately stepped up. With Brebeuf facing a third down at the Chatard 49, Patrick Sowinski stepped in front of an Iffert pass at his own 42 and returned the interception untouched 58 yards for the score. \nAfter forcing a Brebeuf punt, the Trojans got the ball back at their own 17. Gabe Coleman carried for 13 yards, and Jarrod Stiver then rushed twice for 8 yards. Facing a third and short, Stiver took the ball into the line, was briefly bottled up but managed to break through and race into the secondary. Sixty-two yards later, Chatard had a 13-0 lead with 12 seconds left in the first quarter. \nMidway through the second quarter, Chatard would attempt a fake punt just shy of midfield, but Stiver was stopped a yard short. Facing a similar situation three plays later, Brebeuf tried the same thing; this time, Dillon Howell went right up the gut for 6 yards to give the Braves a first down at the Chatard 40. \nIffert followed with connections of 10 and 19 yards to Jacob Pressler to set up a first down at the Chatard 8. Two plays later, Iffert connected with Sam Snyder on a slant pass for a 3-yard score, bringing the Braves within 13-7 by halftime. \nChatard’s Tommy Grote returned the second-half kickoff 50 yards to the Brebeuf 46. Teammate John Chavis followed with a 42-yard run that set up Coleman’s 3-yard score 28 seconds into the half. \nThe Braves responded with 71-yard drive – 68 of those coming from the arm and legs of Iffert – that was capped by Iffert’s 7-yard touchdown toss to Max Kucer for the final score of the night. \nChatard advances to face Guerin Catholic next Friday. The Golden Eagles defeated the Trojans for the first time ever Oct. 9. \nBrebeuf 0 7 7 0 — 14 \nChatard 13 0 7 0 — 20 \nBC — Patrick Sowinski 58 interception return (Caleb Kobets kick) \nBC — Jarrod Stiver 62 run (kick fail) \nBJ — Sam Snyder 3 pass from Luke Iffert (Drew Bevelhimer kick) \nBC — Gabe Coleman3 run (Kobets kick) \nBJ — Max Kucer 7 pass from Iffert (Bevelhimer kick) \nRushing —Brebeuf Jesuit: Iffert 17-106, Noah DeLumpa 9-15, Dillon Howell 1-6, Jeff McGowan 1-0.
