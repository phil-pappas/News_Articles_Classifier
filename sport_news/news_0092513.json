Pittsburgh can ensure the game is at PNC Park with a win in either of its two remaining games or one Cubs loss in Milwaukee. \nAndrew McCutchen had three hits for the Pirates, including a home run. \nGregory Polanco drew a one-out walk from Colin Balester (1-1) in the 12th. Marte hit the next pitch into the right-field stands for his 19th home run of the season and third career walk-off shot. He also hit a game-ending homer Aug. 22 against San Francisco. \nArquimedes Caminero (5-1) pitched a scoreless inning for the win. \nEugenio Suarez had two hits and three RBIs, including a two-run homer, for the Reds. \nBoth starting pitchers lasted five innings. \nPirates left-hander Francisco Liriano allowed four runs and seven hits with five strikeouts and no walks. Liriano raised his season strikeout total to 205, surpassing the 201 he had in 2010 with the Minnesota Twins. \nReds rookie Keyvius Sampson gave up four runs and three hits while striking out seven and walking two. The 24-year-old is winless in his last nine starts, going 0-5 in that span. \nThe Pirates tied it 4-all with a three-run sixth inning after loading the bases with none out to chase Sampson. \nTony Cingrani relieved and walked pinch-hitter Michael Morse to force in a run. Another run scored on Pedro Alvarez's fielder's choice grounder, then Jordy Mercer tied it with an RBI single. \nThe Reds took a 4-0 lead with a pair of runs in both the second and third. \nSuarez hit his 13th homer of the season in the second. An inning later, Jay Bruce hit an RBI double and Suarez followed with a run-scoring single. \nMcCutchen pulled the Pirates to 4-1 when he led the fourth inning with his 23rd homer. \nVOTTO TIES ROSE \nJoey Votto tied a Reds record by reaching base safely in his 48th consecutive game. Votto singled in the third inning off Liriano to match Pete Rose's mark set in 1978. \nRose's run included a 44-game hitting streak, the longest in National League history. \nVotto also reached base for the 316th time this season, equaling the club record he set in 2013. The first baseman entered the game hitting .317 with 29 home runs, 142 walks and an NL-leading .463 on-base percentage. \nUP NEXT \nReds: LHP Brandon Finnegan (4-2, 3.86 ERA) will make his fourth start for Cincinnati. He is 1-2 with a 6.00 ERA since moving into the rotation Sept. 18. \nPirates: RHP A.J. Burnett (9-6, 3.15) is 1-1 with a 3.68 ERA in four starts since being on the disabled list from July 31 to Sept. 9 with a strained flexor tendon in his right elbow. Burnett plans to retire at the end of this season, so this would likely be the last game of his 17-year career if the Pirates lose the wild-card game.
