The Ottawa-based foursome — which includes third Emma Miskew, second Joanne Courtney and lead Lisa Weagle — has already won two events and sits atop the WCT women’s money list with $42,254 in earnings. \nThat number would have been enough for Homan’s crew to finish fifth on the money list at the <italics> end <italics> of the 2014-15 season. \nBut with the Curlers Corner Autumn Gold Classic set to kick off Friday morning at the Calgary Curling Club, no one around the Homan camp is resting on her laurels. \n“I think this sport is always a game you’re constantly working at and (trying to) improve yourself,” said Homan, 26. “Everyone else is trying to do the same. The minute you think you’re No. 1, people are going to pass you.” \nThat’s the attitude that’s seen Homan’s team establish itself as one of the top women’s teams in the world over the past couple of curling seasons. They won the Scotties in both ’13 and ‘14 and went on to finish with a bronze at their first world championships and a silver at their second. \nBut with Olympic champion Jennifer Jones still at her peak and Valerie Sweeting’s Edmonton-based team emerging, Homan’s rink spent the summer hard at work both on and off the ice trying to gain whatever edge they can find heading into the season. \n“The off-season is a lot of dry-land training, getting stronger in the gym and taking care of injuries and anything that’s happened during curling season,” Courtney said. “We’ve played three events and we’ve had a start that we’re happy with and a lot of good things are happening on the ice process-wise, but there’s a lot to improve on and it’s still early.” \nThis weekend’s bonspiel in Calgary will present another big test. Both Jones and Sweeting are in town for the event, as well as perennial contender Shannon Kleibrink and Stefanie Lawton. Homan opens the event Friday morning at 9:30 a.m. against Edmonton-based Jessie Kaufman.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:03:43.297+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
