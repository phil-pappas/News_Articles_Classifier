Matthew Hageman, 29, left Presence Mercy Medical Center in Aurora around noon Wednesday and had not yet been found as of Wednesday evening, according to a news release from the Kane County sheriff's office. Lt. Pat Gengler said there was not a sheriff's office with Hageman at the hospital, but officers did check on him several times and kept in contact with hospital security. \"If you take him into custody before you leave him at the hospital, you may be on the hook to pay for his medical bills,\" Gengler said. Gengler said investigators believe Hageman, of the 300 block of Lincoln Highway, Hinckley, is known to frequent the Big Rock and Sugar Grove area and is likely somewhere nearby. Hageman first ran from deputies around 4:50 p.m. Tuesday Tuesday at around 4:50 p.m. after he was stopped at a Sugar Grove gas station, Gengler said. When the deputies tried to talk to him, Hageman drove away south on Route 47, eventually going off the road into a field south of the village, officials said. Deputies did not follow him into the field but remained in the area and spotted Hageman as he drove west and re-entered the roadway near a construction zone near Route 30 and Dugan Road, officials said. Hageman stuck several construction cones as he drove through the construction zone and continued west on Route 30 before pulling over and running away, Gengler said. Deputies tracked him to a corn field near Route 30 and Daubeman Road and captured him after about 20 minutes, Gengler added. Police said a small amount of heroin was found in Hageman's car, plus he was driving on a suspended license and was wanted on several arrest warrants. After deputies captured him, Hageman was taken to the hospital to be treated for minor injuries and was admitted overnight, officials said. However, he left the hospital before deputies could take him into custody, Gengler said. Anyone with information on Hageman's whereabouts is asked to call (630) 444-1182 or submit a tip anonymously through the Sheriff's Office tip411 program , which can be found on the office's Facebook page.
