MARY'S 0 Bulldogs come up aces in sweep Comment Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 10:22 PM Posted Oct. 21, 2015 at 12:01 AM Updated at 10:22 PM » Social News TRACY — After Tracy’s stunning 3-0 win over St. Mary’s on Wednesday in Tri-City Athletic League volleyball action, Bulldogs libero Chelsea Eddy Berry may have a new nickname: “Ace.” When Eddy Berry took the serve at match point, the junior charged the service line and jumped, sizzling an ace straight onto the St. Mary’s side of the court that brought the highly partisan Swenson Gymnasium crowd onto the floor after a 26-24, 25-23, 25-22 sweep. “My time and effort at practice paid off on the court,” Eddy Berry said. “I was really focused and wanting that point and I did it. It was awesome — like the best thing in my life.\" Eddy Berry finished with five aces and 11 digs. Her winning ace may have brought the crowd onto the floor, but it was the clutch play of Hannah Presley (14 assists, 10 kills, seven digs, three aces) that brought the first two sets to an end. In the first set with the score tied at 24-24 and the Rams (28-7 overall, 6-2 TCAL) with the serve, Presley hammered a kill to give Tracy (18-7, 6-2) the serve back. Presley stepped to the service line and deposited an ace, giving the Bulldogs a 26-24 win. In the second set, an ace by Karina Rodriguez (11 assists, four aces) gave Tracy a 24-22 lead with an ace. An error by the Bulldogs lowered their lead to 24-23, but Presley slammed a kill for the 25-23 win. “It was very exciting to know that what I did was not anything special,” Presley said. “It was just how I play my game. I am glad I can play with confidence in tight situations like that.\" The games were close throughout with 13 ties and eight lead changes. “It is fair to say that this is as big a win as I have had in my 13-year career,” Tracy coach Mahina McCamey said. “It was very exciting.\" St. Mary’s coach Jayne McHugh was frustrated with her team’s play. “They played really well and we didn’t,” McHugh said. “Our passing was completely inadequate to win a volleyball game. Generally, you want a pass between a two or a three — meaning your setter has a lot of options — and most of ours were below a one, meaning she had no options. Run, run, run all the time having to put balls up all the time as best as she could. When you can’t serve-receive, you are not going to win many games and our serve reception was very poor tonight. Grace Murphy had 13 kills, six digs and an ace for Tracy. Jasmine Childress added nine kills and five blocks and Ella Ditzenberger had two blocks. Ngozi Nwabuzoh led the Rams with 11 digs, 10 kills and an ace. Marisa Flores had 17 digs and two assists and Paris Sprague added 10 assists and two aces.
