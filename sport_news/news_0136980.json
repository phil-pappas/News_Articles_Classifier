Bill BaldowskiColumbia varsity head football coach David Edwards and senior linebacker Ra’Saan Johnson go over a defensive alignment the team plans to use against Grady. slideshow After a 12-6 loss to Southwest DeKalb to start the regular season, the Columbia varsity football team had reeled off four consecutive victories prior to last week’s region game with St. Pius X and looks to have righted its ship.However, Columbia head football coach David Edwards believes his Eagles will have a better view of what the remainder of his tough region schedule has to offer as, after St. Pius X, they visit Grady Friday.“Grady has great athletes and I know they will play us tough,” he said.However, the Eagles are facing a good and bad scenario this year, especially with the team having lost a good number of its veteran senior athletes to graduation and then saw a number of them go on to play division I college football.However, despite being pleased to see these veterans heightened their football skills at the college level, it left Edwards with numerous holes to fill on the team this year.“We are under going growing pains, as I like to call it,” he said.“Not only do we have a good many young, inexperienced players learning new positions, but I have asked some of our more experienced players from last year to also learn new positions due to the needs we have on this year’s team.”In last year’s game with Columbia, Grady carried a slim 22-21 lead over the Eagles entering the final two minutes of the game.It was at that point, the Eagles mounted a touchdown drive that resulted in an Eagle win.This year, the Eagles are using a powerful ground game to average 21 points per game while allowing an average of six points a game to opponents.This defensive effort has Columbia in the top 10 in the county in points allowed, Edwards said.Offensively, it is averaging 282 yards in total offense a game.Columbia’s potent ground attack is led by senior running back Michael Hector.In the Eagle’s first four games, Hector had 34 carries, totaling 328 yards, an 8.9 yards-per-carry average, and had scored two touchdowns.Columbia’s second leading round gainer through four games was senior running back Curtis Tucker who had amassed 30 carries for 197 yards, a 6.6 yards-per-carry average, and had scored twice.Although the Eagles’ aerial attack pales in comparison to its ground game, Columbia does go to the air, riding the arm of quarterback Will Tomlin.Through four games, the senior is eight-of-20 passing for 84 yards with one interception and has called his own number as a ball carrier, rushing 19 times for 143 yards in the same four-game period, a 7.5 yards-per-carry average.As an added offensive bonus, Columbia has one of the best kickers in the county in junior Joshua Jenkins.Not only is he nine-for-nine in connecting on points-after-touchdown but is three-for-three in field goal attempts of 30, 35 and 40 yards.In addition, he is averaging more than 38 yards per punt.“Joshua is as good as they come in punting and kicking,” Edwards said.“Our entire team has the confidence in Joshua that he will get the job done and if we can get within 40 yards of an opponent’s goal post, we have a great chance of coming away with at least a three-point field goal.”From a defensive perspective, the Eagles’ leading tackler is senior middle linebacker Ra’Saan Johnson who is averaging nine tackles a game.In addition, Hector, who also plays strong safety, is averaging about seven tackles a game.As to what his team will have to beat Grady, Edwards said that eliminating turnovers remains a big key.“The thing about Grady is they give you a lot of different formations and you have got to make sure you are not outflanked,” he said.“They try to spread you out offensively so our players are going to have to, as we like to say, stay at home and play their positions and concentrate on their assignments and responsibilities.”The Eagles are going to have to play as mistake-free a game as possible, the coach said.Columbia was setting the pace in region AAAA classification, region 6 play, with its 4-1 mark before the. St. Pius game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:43:53.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
