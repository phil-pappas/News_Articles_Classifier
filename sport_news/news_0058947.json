This morning at SEC Tipoff, Tyler Ulis was asked about The Loss again, and he told a group of reporters he’s still not over it. \n“It is still lingering for me,” Ulis said, according to Nicole Auerbach. “I still lose sleep over it.” \nUlis is clearly the leader of this squad, a role he has fully embraced. \n“There’s a lot on my shoulders and I’m ready to take it on,” he said, according to Kyle Tucker . Last year’s team was known for their strong post play, and while this year’s group is expected to be perimeter-oriented, Ulis says they don’t have an identity yet. \n“It’s early, we don’t have one.” \nPlenty of time ’til March. We’ll do our best to be patient.

Ullis is becoming one of my all-time faves. My nephew and sister ran into him briefly at a Cal camp in June/July. They were impressed – especially my nephew who is an undersized PG at 13 years. 8 god October 21, 2015 at 12:43 pm | Permalink | Reply \nI’m not convince that’s a good thing. Have to be able to shake off tough losses; Ulis hasn’t done much losing at the college level. There’s a fine line between having a chip on your shoulder and being haunted by a loss.
