Gibson was fouled on the play. Mandatory Credit: David Richard-USA TODAY Sports They say athletes want to be musicians, musicians want to be athletes and NBA bloggers want to get out of their mothers' basements. And if that's true, then former Cavalier Daniel \"Boobie\" Gibson is doing everything he can to hold true to that stereotype.\nHere's more from Troy L. Smith of Northeast Ohio Media Group :\nAdChoices Gibson joined Power 105's \"The Breakfast Club\" radio show in New York City Friday morning to announce he was leaving the NBA to pursue a career as a rapper.\nTo be clear, Gibson hasn't played in the NBA since a stint with the Cavs during the 2012-2013 season. Thus, some people on Twitter are suggesting the NBA actually quit Gibson before he could quit the NBA.\n\"I'm gonna give up my NBA career to start rapping,\" Gibson said on air. The response from \"The Breakfast Club\" host Charlamagne Tha God was somewhat comical:\n\"Who you think a better rapper, you or Birdman?\" Charlamagne asked Gibson.\nGibson then dropped some lyrics that were more of a spoken word: \"My biggest competition is reflection.\" Now, we turn to more important issues, like what the heck is Gibson's name going to be? Is he going to stick with Boobie? Is there going to be come kid out there who's going to get to say, \"You know, this new rapper, Boobie, is pretty good?\" Or maybe he'll go another route, completely detaching his rap self from his former basketball self.\nHe could also just combine them, go with something like \"3points\" or \"Point God\" and call it a day.\n\"Hey man, you hear about this new rapper, 3points?\"\nYeah, that'll work just fine.\nMORE NEWS: Want stories delivered to you?
