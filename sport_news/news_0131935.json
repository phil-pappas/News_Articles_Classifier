Except for Joey Logano, who was pumped after winning Sunday's race, this year's Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup is pumping up the pressure on drivers and crew chiefs.\nAdChoices In the first race of Round 2 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway, Chase contenders ran into one another, there were crashes on re-starts and crew chiefs made some seriously bad calls.\nMatt Kenseth, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Kyle Busch were all considered among the favorites to make it to the final one-race round at the Homestead-Miami Speedway. But each was involved in incidents, not necessarily of their own making, which will severely test their ability to advance.\nBut even those who had a good day still face a lot of pressure unless they advance by winning the race at the Kansas Speedway on Sunday. The third race in the Contender round is at the Talladega Superspeedway, where the draft and multi-car crashes can ruin a driver's day in a heartbeat. Only a victory guarantees a driver will advance to the next round.\n\"Logano's the only one is going to sleep for the next two weeks, you know what I mean?\" said Martin Truex Jr., who finished third in Charlotte behind runner-up Kevin Harvick.\nIs there too much pressure on drivers who earn hefty retainers and purse money in the millions? While they may not face any more pressure than Major League Baseball players in a Divisional Series, the Sprint Cup drivers do carry far more of a team's responsibility when it comes to the outcome. That pressure showed at Charlotte, the home track for the bulk of the Sprint Cup participants.\nCharlotte is also a 1.5-mile track where passing is difficult, which moved the pressure up another notch, especially after the planned Saturday night race was postponed until Sunday afternoon. With cars impounded by NASCAR overnight, teams had to scramble to adapt their chassis to warmer, sunny weather during the afternoon event.\nAfter leading 72 laps, Joe Gibbs Racing driver Kenseth got mired in traffic due to crew chief Jason Ratcliffe's decision to bring him into the pits while leading for four fresh tires on the day's third caution while the rest of the leaders stayed out or took just two tires. While struggling to get back to the clean air at the front, Kenseth couldn't get his car to handle in traffic and eventually tagged the rear of Chase contender Ryan Newman, hit the wall and was forced to retire, finishing 42nd.\nIf ever there was an inopportune call to take the time to put on four tires by a crew chief, this was it - although it was a move probably designed to stay ahead of changing track conditions. Kenseth will now have to win at Kansas or hope for a miracle at Talladega to make it to Round 3.\nEarnhardt Jr. ran afoul of an aggressive passing maneuver in Turn 1 as well - but not his own. Carl Edwards made a bid to the inside, Earnhardt Jr. turned in and was knocked up the banking.\nDespite a miraculous save, a cut tire eventually put him two laps down. During his comeback, he hit oil near the wall at Turn 1 and he eventually finished 28th.\nReplays showed Edwards' move to be overly aggressive and without much chance of success unless he forced Earnhardt Jr. to change his line, which didn't happen. Edwards said he had already been blocked once by the Hendrick Motorsports Chevy driver.\n\"I felt like he blocked me real hard the first time and so the second time I got up there when he came down I just held my ground and we got together,\" said Edwards. \"He did an amazing job saving it and I have a ton of respect for him so it stinks that it ruined his day. I have to hold my ground when I've got my nose in there.\"\nEarnhardt Jr. said he would wait to view a replay before commenting on Edwards' move. He remained upbeat about his chances after winning two restrictor plate races this year already at the Daytona International Speedway and Talladega.\n\"We don't have to go to Talladega and be nervous like those guys that are going to have to play it safe,\" he said. \"We can just go hard. So, we've got a great car that can win that race. We can go to Kansas and run great. I like that track and don't see why we can't run great there and maybe win the race there.\"\nFar less confident was Busch, who finished 20th and sarcastically thanked NASCAR for its clean-up efforts on the oil in Turn 1. While running third, Busch was hit by Kyle Larson's late entrance to the pit road. Subsequent repairs to the No. 18 Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota put Busch behind, before he too hit the oil in Turn 1 and got into the wall.\nThere wasn't much doubt that Larson caused the accident - although Busch got collected because he faked an entrance to the pit road before trying to return to the track. In this case, there was some confused signal calling by a crew chief. At the last second, Chris Heroy told Larson to pit even through the driver was nearly past the commitment cone.\n\"They told me to do what everybody around me was doing and the No. 22 (leader Logano) was staying out,\" said Larson. \"So I was committed to staying out and as soon as I turned right to stay out they said, ‘Pit, pit, pit.' I hung a left and Kyle was there. I feel really terrible to ruin their day and hopefully it didn't hurt their chances of transferring through this round.\"\nFor his part, Newman finished 15th. He didn't lose ground due to his contact with Kenseth in Turn 1. But he also finds himself to be one of the four drivers below the cut line simply by not finishing ahead of eight other contenders. Having advanced on points last year to runner-up in the championship, on this day Newman lost points primarily because his Richard Childress Racing Chevy just wasn't quick enough on restarts.\nAsked about so many contenders being involved in mistakes on this day, Truex Jr.'s answer was not surprising. The pressure, he said, keeps mounting.\n\"I think part of it is that they know that every spot is super important, and if they get that chance to get in there and take a position, they're going to go for it,\" he said. \"That's probably what it boils down to. I thought the restarts were as on edge as ever, guys just trying to get everything they possibly could. There was just so much on the line.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportsxchange.com/tsxfiles/topstories", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:56:19.446+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
