The Mustangs finished their regular season schedule with a 4-3 record. They are the #6 seed team in the Section V Class B Quarter-final bracket. The Orange and Blue 11 will travel to Geneva Friday night to play the #3 seed Geneva Panthers with the winner advancing to the semi-finals. Geneva defeated Penn Yan 29-18 two weeks ago in a Finger Lakes East game played in Penn Yan. The Mustangs will be looking to reverse the tables on the Panthers and move to the next round. The Dundee Scots qualified for the Section V Class D tournament with their win over Midlakes last Saturday in Dundee. The Scots finished the regular season with a 4-3 record and will be the #8 seed team in the tournament. Dundee will face the #1 seed Red Jacket team in Manchester Saturday afternoon. The Red Jacket Indians defeated Dundee in week number four 41-38. It was a wild game with Red Jacket scoring late to secure the win. The winner of this Class D quarter-final game will advance to the semi-finals next week. Marcus Whitman will probably play in the Connor-Ferris Bowl this weekend. The pairings for this consolation tournament will be announced later this week.
