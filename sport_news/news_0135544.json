(Photo: News file photo) \nCONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE This is the first in a series of profiles on former Michigan State players and their thoughts on the Michigan game. \nBlair White really, really wants a Michigan State win.\nHe really doesn’t want to tell his second son, Chase — born Sunday, the first day of Michigan-Michigan State week — that he came into this world during a week when the Wolverines won the big game.\n“That would be nice,” White said, laughing. “It’s getting tougher and tougher by the day.”\nMSU is scuffling, but winning. UM is dominating, and winning.\nBut when the teams meet, it’s anything goes.\nPrior to 2008, Michigan State hadn’t won at The Big House since 1990, but the Spartans snapped that streak with a convincing 35-21 victory — starting their string of winning six of seven in the series.\nAnd White got things started that day in 2008, catching a slant from quarterback Brian Hoyer and scampering 61 yards for a quick-strike touchdown that left Michigan fans stunned.\n“That’s probably one of my most fond memories,” White said. “The safety missed the tackle. I kept looking back over my shoulder. Didn’t think a white boy like me would be able to run past those guys.\n“It was fun. It gave us some good momentum.”\nIt was the banner play in the Michigan State career of White, 28, a Saginaw native who always knew just how important the MSU-UM game was to so many.\nHe grew up in an MSU family, and arrived in East Lansing in 2005 as a walk-on.\nWhite led the team in receptions and yards his junior year, and was all-Big Ten as a senior.\nBeating Michigan, and making the big play to do it, trumps all the stats and accolades, of course.\n“Pretty much everybody in my family was Michigan State,” he said. “You pick a side, right? When I got to Michigan State, Coach (Mark) Dantonio played it (the rivalry) up pretty significantly. That created a sense of desire to want to win the game even more.”\nWhite’s last year at MSU was 2009, a 26-20 overtime win for MSU in East Lansing.\nHe went undrafted, but caught on briefly with the Indianapolis Colts before calling it a career.\nHe’s now wrapping up dental school at University of Detroit-Mercy, and soon will move on to an orthodontist residency program. White and his wife, Karlie, live in Royal Oak with their two boys.\nSo, thoughts on Saturday’s game?\n“Michigan looks really good,” he said. “I don’t know how it’s possible in such a short time. I’ve certianly gotten more nervous as the year’s gone on.\n“I think, with any rivalry games, it’s gonna be close. I hope.”\nFor Chase’s sake.\ntpaul@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/tonypaul1984 \nBlair White’s record against Michigan \nMSU-UM games Blair White played in:\n2007: Michigan, 28-24\n2008: MSU, 35-21\n2009: MSU, 26-20", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:50:13.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
