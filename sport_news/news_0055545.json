He just keeps coming and coming and coming.” \nAnd that’s great news for the Cougars (4-2) as they continue their quest for a North 1, Group 1 playoff berth Friday night against NJIC Meadowlands Division rival Hasbrouck Heights (5-1). There’s little margin for error in one of North Jersey’s tightest playoff races, and the Cougars are going to need all the grit they can muster if they want to return to the championship game. \n“I would say we learned a lot from last season,” Coffey said. “A lot of the guys had varsity experience last year, so they know what it’s like to play a playoff game. There’s pressure now, but our guys can deal with it.” \nThat includes Coffey, who made one of the biggest plays of the season Friday night. The senior capped a remarkable 9-minute, 26-second drive with a 1-yard touchdown plunge with three seconds remaining, giving the Cougars a stirring, potential season-saving 18-15 victory over Park Ridge. \nBut that’s just another day at the office for Coffey, who is thriving as Cresskill’s go-to back. \nIn six games, he has carried 148 times for 1,032 yards and 14 touchdowns. He has done so in a league that features some tough defenses. \n“Our offensive line is doing a great job in front of me,” Coffey said. “I just do what I’m told in practice and work hard. I’m trying to hit the hole hard and fast, falling forward for a couple of extra yards.” \nThat has resulted in more than 100 rushing yards in every game, including two games where Coffey topped 200 yards. His best performance came on Sept. 25 against North Arlington, when he rushed 36 times for 297 yards and five touchdowns in a 55-20 victory. \n“He plays old school kind of football,” Quinn said. “He just grinds it out and kind of keeps going and going. \n“Three, four, five yards at a time. Pounding, pounding away. He always seems to be going forward.” \nQuinn said Coffey also isn’t afraid to do a lot of the dirty work, like blocking, for the Cougars. He’s also a very good wrestler, so that toughness and work ethic is well-engrained into Coffey’s athletic DNA. \n“He has always played with a little chip on his shoulder,” Quinn said. \nWhich leads to Friday night at Depken Field, another game that will have a distinct playoff feel. Heights is the best defensive team in the league, coming off a 42-28 victory over St. Mary. \nThe Aviators sit third in the North 1, Group 1 rankings, and last week’s victory over No. 2 Park Ridge jumped the Cougars up from the ninth spot to No. 7. That raises the stakes Friday night. \nThis promises to be another nail-biter, and that means the spotlight is on the Cresskill offense line and Coffey. \n“We just have to work with what we get,” said Coffey, who hasn’t figured out his college plans yet. “We have to see if we can find their weakness and figure out what we can run against them. \n“We’re treating this as a playoff game. There’s a lot of power points on the line, and we can’t afford to lose.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T09:04:52.617+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
