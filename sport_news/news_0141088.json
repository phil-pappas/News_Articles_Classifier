If there is no place to park, it will make access to the wider beaches much more difficult.\nThe Surfrider Foundation, The American Littoral Society and fishermen's groups such as the Asbury Park Fishing Club are asking interested individuals to attend a borough meeting where arguments on the ordinance will be heard this Friday, Oct. 9, at 9 a.m at the Borough Hall, 190 Norwood Ave. in Deal.\nTuna Stakes Invitational\nThe Tuna Stakes Invitational, which was postponed by the wind and rain of the past weekend's nor'easter and the threat from Hurricane Joaquin, has been rescheduled for later this week.\nTournament Director Len Strobel said the Captain's Meeting will take place Tuesday, Oct. 6 from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Reel Seat in Brielle, located at 707 Union Ave. (Route 71) in Brielle.\nThe format for the $50,000 winner-take-all allows each entrant to fish one of the 10 available fishing days which consists of an overnight trip with lines in at 8 a.m. and lines out at 10 a.m. the following day.\nFor tournament updates, visit www.tunastakesinvitational.com\nOn the water\nIt's going to take a few days for the ocean to calm down after the weekend's raging wind and theof the hurricane to what kind of shape the fishing is in.\nReports for anglers have been pretty much non existent with the only one coming form Bob Matthews at Fisherman's Den in Belmar.\nHe said one shop regular caught a number of short bass fishing bombers in back waters out of the wind. Matthews also reported that a lot of kingfish were being taken before the blow, along with spot and small porgies. It's anybody's guess if they're still around.\nJohn Oswald: joswald@gannettnj.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:55:19.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
