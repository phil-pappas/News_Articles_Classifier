McCarter finished in first with a time of 19:40. By Eric Turner The Capital-Journal \nIt was a foregone conclusion that the Seaman girls cross country team would repeat as city champs Saturday. \nWhat wasn’t clear was which Viking runner would take the individual title at the city meet at Washburn Rural. \nIn the end, it was junior Avery McCarter who edged senior teammate Kaylee Snell by five seconds as Seaman dominated the meet with five of the top-10 finishers. \n“It was exciting,” Seaman coach Rick Brading said. “I had no idea which way it was going to go, but they raced and today it was Avery.” \nMcCarter trailed Snell and early leader Abby Wagemaker of Topeka High — who placed third — before making her move at about the two-mile mark. \nMcCarter finished in 19 minutes, 40.1 seconds. \n“I was trying to stay up behind them within a foot,” McCarter said. “My goal was the last mile to try to get a little bit ahead of them. And also I wanted to break 20 (minutes). This was a good race to do it.” \nSnell placed second in the city meet for the second straight year. She finished in 19:45.1. Seaman cruised to the team title 24-67 over Washburn Rural. \n“Obviously, it was a really good day for our team, and I’m really proud of Avery for stepping up. I raced my best, and Avery’s a good runner. She deserved it. \n“It was good competition. It’s nice to run together so we can push each other get those PRs.” \nMcCarter and Snell each posted their personal-best times. McCarter was fifth last year. \n“Teammates running together is always a strong thing because they want to beat each other really bad, too,” Brading said. “There’s a good competition going there. \n“That’s a tough one for (Snell). I know she wanted to win it her senior year and all. (McCarter) can put her game face on and go. And that’s what she ended up doing today.” \nKaty Mulqueen placed fourth, Avery Bocquin seventh and Riley Fisher 10th to account for Seaman’s scoring. \nTianna Arreguin placed fifth for Shawnee Heights. Jaybe Shufelberger was sixth for Rural, which had six of the 20 medalists. \nTEAM SCORES \nSeaman 24, Washburn Rural 67, Shawnee Heights 75, Topeka High 103, Hayden 133, Topeka West 139. \nINDIVIDUAL RESULTS \n1.
