It will be the first final four appearance for St. Mary's.\n\"We came out ready to play and were very solid in the first (set),\" said Turkeys coach Kari Duncan. \"Then we started to play a little reactionary in the second and lost, but once we decided to just play our game, we got back on track. Our defense today was just great, but it was really a team effort.\"\n\"We know we're the underdogs; we've played fewer matches than the other teams. But I think we have a chance if we can execute and get the other teams out of their games.\"\nHarding, the top seed in the West Region, had no trouble with The King's Academy, winning 25-10, 25-10, 25-7. The Lions will take a 37-6 record into the tournament.\nSt. George's, which lost to Harding in last week's region title game, advanced with a 16-25, 25-6, 25-16, 25-10 victory over Friendship Christian. The Gryphons will be looking to win their first state title since 2011 when play begins on Wednesday.\nECS, the other local hopeful in Division 2-A, lost on the road against nationally ranked Knoxville Webb.\nBriarcrest surged into the Division 2-AA tournament and won its 42nd match of the season, defeating Brentwood Academy 25-14, 25-14, 25-11. The Saints (42-4-1) will be joined at state by St. Agnes, which qualified with a victory over Nashville Ensworth last week.\nHouston and White Station will represent Shelby County in the AAA tournament. The Mustangs will be making their ninth appearance in the last 10 years while the Spartans are at state for the first time since 1997.\nMR. FOOTBALL CHANGES\nThe Tennessee Titans Mr. Football awards will have a new look this year.\nThe awards — which recognize the best back and lineman in six Division 1 and two Division 2 classifications — will be presented on Nov. 30 at Nissan Stadium in Nashville. The state's top kicker will also be honored.\nFour semifinalists in each classification will be announced on Nov. 5. Those will be narrowed down to two finalists, which will be announced by Titans play-by-play voice Mike Keith on the Titans website (titansonline.com) on Nov. 16.\nThe two finalists will be invited to the luncheon on Nov. 30, which will be held at the West Club Level at Nissan Stadium.\nMIDDLE SCHOOL TITLE GAMES SET\nWhitehaven Stadium will play host to the SCIAA county championship football games Tuesday.\nGeeter (9-1) will take on Bellevue (10-0) in the small school division at 5:30 p.m., followed by White Station (10-0) vs. Havenview (10-0) in the large schools division.\nCoach Byron Harris' Bellevue team has won three of the last five title games, including a victory over Kevin Patterson's Geeter squad in the 2014 contest. Havenview, coached by Errol Harmon, boasts a county-long 22-game winning streak and is the defending county and state champion. They'll meet an explosive Spartans squad coached by Coley Thornton.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:10:50.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
