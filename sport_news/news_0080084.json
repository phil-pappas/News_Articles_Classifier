Who cares? All the talk as the Senators showed up for work Wednesday was about the fact Karlsson cut off his lengthy locks and then showed off his new look in the dressing room before the club's flight here.\nSo, what's up, Erik?\n\"Decided to cut it off (Tuesday),\" Karlsson told what was easily the largest media scrum of the day. \"I think it was a little bit overdue maybe. I had long hair for a long time. Even though it was kind of my thing. At the same time, I'm happy to get rid of it.\"\nKarlsson said he didn't consult anybody other than himself before making this massive decision.\n\"Myself, first. I've been thinking about it for a long time,\" he said. \"You know, haven't really been able to pull the plug. Decided to do it (Tuesday) for no other reason than at the time, it seemed like a good idea.\"\n✂️✂️✂️ pic.twitter.com/mDvW0qmrPK\n— Ottawa Senators (@Senators) October 7, 2015 Not all of his teammates were caught completely off guard. Karlsson sent blueline partner Marc Methot a shot from the barber's chair while it was happening so that he could get a look at exactly what was happening.\n\"I was on the couch and his hair was virtually all gone,\" Methot said with a smile. \"It's a good look. It works for him. I was worried because he tends to look really young and minuscule when his hair is cut off. No (kidding). In all seriousness, he looks good.\"\nMethot said he won't be following in Karlsson's footsteps.\n\"No chance,\" Methot said. \"I've had short hair for a long time. I'm growing it out a little bit and if I'm sick of it by Christmas, I'll chop it off.\"\nAll this comes only 24 hours after Bobby Ryan was named \"the newest hair ambassador\" for Head and Shoulders shampoo.\nWhat exactly that will entail, the Senators' winger isn't sure until he sits down with officials from Proctor and Gamble Friday in Toronto.\n\"It seems like good thing that came across for me. It made for a good partnership with Proctor and Gamble. We'll have some fun with it,\" Ryan said.\nHe's not the kind of guy who strikes you as someone who worries about their hair.\n\"I will never be able to do the flip. That's not in my repertoire,\" said Ryan. \"I just kind of run a comb through it and let it go. I think they have their stylist there that will dial me in.\"\nR.I.P #theflow\n— Erik Karlsson (@ErikKarlsson65) October 7, 2015 Asked if Karlsson thought it was sad he was answering questions about his hair, he said he knew they were coming and wanted to get them out of the way.\n\"I wanted to get rid of it today so that I didn't have to get rid of it tomorrow. I knew that you guys were going to be all over it. People are going to look at me different for a little bit. Then, it will pass,\" said Karlsson\nHe's right. Hair today. Gone tomorrow.\nTwitter: @ sungarrioch\nHair today. Gone tomorrow.
