South Alabama is also off the following Saturday, meaning the Arkansas State game will be the Jaguars' only one in a 22-day period. \nJaguars head coach Joey Jones said Monday he feels like the break is coming at a good time, following more than nine weeks of football including preseason camp. \n\"We've got a couple days break here,\" Jones said. \"I think it's good for our players to get a break. And it's good for the coaches to get somewhat of a break. We're watching film and working hard toward Arkansas State, but you're not in that hurry-up mode where you've got to get ready in a day and a half for Tuesday. We've got a couple of more days to get ready. So that's a good breath of fresh air for us.\" \nThe Jaguars rode an outstanding defensive effort to a six-point victory at Troy on Saturday. South Alabama recorded three interceptions and stuff the Trojans on fourth-and-1 in the final two minutes. \nIt was a festive atmosphere at Troy's Veterans Memorial Stadium in the first \"Battle for the Belt.\" Jones said it was everything an in-state, in-conference rivalry should be. \n\"It was a huge game for our program, I think we all know that,\" Jones said. \"They obviously made it a big deal, and rightfully so. It needs to be a big rivalry. The belt added something to it. The atmosphere was tremendous up there. Their fans really came out, our fans came out. It was a true rivalry the way you want it. It was a joy to be in and glad we came out on top.\" \nThe Jaguars won't hit the practice field again until Wednesday, then will work out every day through Sunday. The Arkansas State game is set for a 7 p.m. kickoff on ESPN2. \nArkansas State beat Idaho 49-35 on Saturday, and also owns a 70-7 victory over Missouri State this season. The Red Wolves — who have visited Mobile for the Go Daddy Bowl each of the last four years — played a close game against Missouri earlier this season, losing 27-20 after an injury to starting quarterback Freddie Knighten. \n\"They've got solid players, really good players at every position,\" Jones said. \"They've been doing well the last couple of years and been in the conference championship race pretty much every year — done a good job recruiting. They're well-coached, do a good job offensively. (Knighten) hasn't been playing the last couple of weeks. ... They haven't had as much production without him being in there, but they're still very good. Having him in there makes them a much better team. Defensively, they're very sound. Got good athletes running around. It's a big challenge for us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T22:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T00:10:00.636+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
