KING -- State Journal \nUW's Tanner McEvoy eludes Troy defensive end Sam Lebbie on his way to a touchdown during the third quarter of the Sept. 19 victory over Troy at Camp Randall Stadium. Buy Now M.P. KING -- State Journal \nUW safety Tanner McEvoy (3) and cornerback Derrick Tindal bring down Miami (Ohio) wide receiver Sam Martin earlier this season. \nTanner McEvoy stood helpless on the sideline, staring anxiously at head coach Nunzio Campanile. \nTrailing by four points, their team’s defense was struggling to force a stop in the final minutes of the 2010 New Jersey Non-Public, Group 4 state championship game. \nThe Bergen Catholic senior quarterback was about to end his high school career with a title-game loss to rival Don Bosco. Even worse, he was forced to watch it from afar. \n“What are you looking at?” Campanile finally asked McEvoy. \n“I want to play,” McEvoy replied. \nFor the first time since the season opener, McEvoy rushed onto the field to play safety. \n“It would have killed him to end his career on the sidelines,” said Campanile, whose team — despite McEvoy’s 400-yard performance and last-gasp defensive effort — still lost that day. “He needed to be on the field giving us a chance to win. That’s just the type of kid he is.” \nThat was McEvoy’s first season playing quarterback. He grew up as a running back/middle linebacker and played wide receiver/safety during his early high school years. \nSince that senior season, McEvoy had viewed himself as a quarterback until his role changed this year at the University of Wisconsin. He traveled to three different colleges in separate parts of the country to give himself a chance to play the position. \nThroughout his football career, though, there was no greater priority for McEvoy than seeing the field as often as he could. \nHe’s playing more snaps than anyone this season as a senior safety and wide receiver for UW, which opens Big Ten Conference play Saturday against Iowa. \nMcEvoy played every meaningful snap at safety the past three weeks, has caught three passes for 29 yards and scored on a 32-yard run from a direct snap against Troy in Week 3. \nHis days as a quarterback are likely over, but he couldn’t ask for a better chance to impact games for the Badgers. \n“It’s just plain fun (for him),” said Steve McEvoy, Tanner’s father. “The game has always been that to him, and to be able to be out there as much as he has been, he’s having a blast. \n“Work, perseverance — it pays off. … It really worked out well for him when at points you wondered if it would.” \nLife as a quarterback \nCampanile, who had just been hired as Bergen Catholic’s coach, approached McEvoy about switching to quarterback for his final year of high school. \nIt wasn’t the first time Campanile had pitched the idea, however. \nHe coached McEvoy at football camps during his middle school years when Campanile was the offensive coordinator at Don Bosco. Every summer, he’d suggest the same thing. \nHis pitch to McEvoy this time around was simple and especially appealing to McEvoy. \n“His good quote was, ‘Do you want to touch the ball six times or 60 times a game?’” McEvoy said. “I was like, ‘Well, crap, I guess I’m going for quarterback this year.’ That’s how that all started.” \nMcEvoy went on to break a number of school records, throwing for 2,264 yards and 32 touchdowns while rushing for 1,196 yards and 14 scores. \n“When the scout team would go in (during practice) and he’d be standing on the sideline, he’d want to jump in and play wide receiver,” Campanile said. “He just loves to compete. He loves to play.” \nStill, that one thrilling season as his team’s signal caller gave McEvoy the desire to become a quarterback at a major college program. \nHe wouldn’t even consider schools who were recruiting him to play another position, including Rutgers, where his brother Colin played defensive back and linebacker from 2007-10, and wound up with quarterback guru Steve Spurrier at South Carolina. \nEntering fall camp as a redshirt freshman, McEvoy realized playing time as the Gamecocks’ quarterback wasn’t going to come anytime soon. \nWith the season approaching and not much quarterbacking game tape to his name, he transferred to Arizona Western Junior College in an attempt to show what he was capable of. \nHe left a top-10 team in the SEC and showed up in Yuma, Ariz., six days before Arizona Western’s season opener — just in time for a 1,700-mile bus ride to Ellsworth College in Iowa Falls, Iowa. \nMcEvoy played the final series at quarterback that week and won the starting job by the Matadors’ second game. \n“As a freshman, the one thing that drove him crazy is that he wasn’t on the football field playing,” Steve McEvoy said. “Now all of a sudden he was getting to play quarterback every day. \n“Yuma, Arizona, is out there, but he enjoyed that experience because he was playing.” \nMcEvoy joined the Badgers a year later, where he played safety in 2013 after failing to win the starting quarterback job. \nHe finally got his chance to start under center the next season. While he presented a dual-threat option that challenged defenses, McEvoy struggled to throw the ball accurately. \nHe began the season by completing 57.3 percent of his passes and throwing five interceptions before being replaced by Joel Stave just before halftime in a loss to Northwestern in Week 5. \n“It was hard to get him out of that rift, but I honestly felt like he handled it really well for how tough a situation that was,” said UW outside linebacker Jesse Hayes, McEvoy’s roommate. “I don’t feel like he hung out down there too long. \n“He was sad, he was frustrated, but he dealt with it.” \nAnd he found a new way to become a difference-maker for the Badgers. \nStave started the remaining games, but McEvoy made a number of key plays as a change-of-pace quarterback, including a 45-yard touchdown run to give UW a lead in its 26-24 win over Iowa. \nMcEvoy also didn’t allow his disappointment to affect the rest of his teammates. That includes Stave — his roommate the night before games last season. \n“He didn’t sit there and dwell on it and be a bad teammate to the guy who beat him or other teammates,” UW wide receiver Alex Erickson said. “He embraced his new role, and he was still helping us win a lot of ball games. I think that just says a lot about Tanner as a teammate.” \nMcEvoy’s impressive play the rest of the season didn’t make his transition to a second-string player any easier. He simply made the best of his opportunities. \n“It was definitely difficult, but it’s kind of out of your control,” McEvoy said. “You can only control what’s in our hands, and that’s what I focused on. \n“I think it’s tough on anyone, going through that, but you’ve just got to roll with the punches.” \nA new role \nMcEvoy knew his days as a quarterback were coming to an end last season. \nEven before lining up at safety in UW’s Outback Bowl victory over Auburn, he wasn’t naive to the fact that he needed to accept a new role. \n“I kind of knew what was happening,” McEvoy said. “I saw it coming. \n“As the season went on last year, I knew if I wanted to keep playing this game, I was going to have to make some changes. So I was looking forward to the challenge.” \nCampanile told the State Journal in 2013 that McEvoy’s talent level as a quarterback was on par with former NFL draft picks Matt Simms and Mike Teel, who Campanile coached at Don Bosco. \nHe still believes McEvoy’s career at that position could have blossomed into something special if he had the stable coaching that he wasn’t able to receive by playing for three schools and four different coaching staffs. \n“If he had been playing for (UW coach Paul) Chryst the whole time they might have kept him at quarterback,” Campanile said. “The thing I thought with Tanner was, if you’re going to play him at quarterback with his experience level, you’ve kind of got to play through the growing pains, and it’s very hard to do that in college football. Everybody’s job is on the line every week.” \nIn a few games away from the position, however, he’s already become the most flexible and one of the most valuable players the Badgers have. \nHe was a starting wide receiver to begin the year. Since UW’s defense struggled against Alabama in the season opener, he’s played every first-team snap at safety while still making an impact on offense. \nThe 6-foot-6 McEvoy has the speed to cover major ground in the secondary and the size to present a tough matchup at wideout. \nHis physical makeup, though, only begins to describe what it takes to play both ways in the Big Ten. \n“It’s tough. I take my hat off to him,” UW defensive backs coach Daronte Jones said. “It’s not even the physical side of it. Just the mental aspect. It’s tough enough just learning one playbook. He has to learn two.” \nMcEvoy has split his practice and meeting time during the week as the only Badgers’ player preparing for both opposing offenses and defenses. \nJones said McEvoy has improved his on-field communication as a defensive back. UW wide receivers coach Ted Gilmore said McEvoy’s increase in endurance has helped him run more precise routes as a receiver. \nAfter years of chasing his dream as a quarterback, he’s found the perfect role elsewhere. \n“I’m definitely at ease,” McEvoy said. “Each week I’m getting more and more comfortable with it. \n“I’ve been around the block, you could say. I definitely learned a lot. I grew as a person on and off the field. (Crap's) gonna happen. You’ve just got to keep going.” +2", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T11:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:18:38.137+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
