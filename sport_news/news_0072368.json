Seton finished with a 17-0 record in dual meets this season. \nWith two matches being played in the late window, Horseheads evened the meet at 3-3 when unbeaten No. 1 singles player Meredith Braiman rolled to a 6-4, 6-0 victory over Alina Galyon after dropping the first three games. That left all eyes on the No. 2 doubles match. \n“I was just praying for them to do their best,” Seton senior Sophia Terry said of her teammates. “I know when they do their best, they’re going to win. I was so proud of them.” \nCrowley/Korchak took the final game on a deuce point, avoiding a 5-5 score that would have led to at least two more games against Jessica Fletcher and Alaina Strife. \n“The second doubles, I give them so much credit,” Seton head coach Katie Loughlin said. “They’ve never been under this much pressure before to have to win a match, and they really came through.” Buy Photo \nClaire Loughlin of Binghamton Seton Catholic Central returns a shot during her victory at No. 3 singles, helping the Saints to a 4-3 win over Horseheads in the STAC tournament final Tuesday at Horseheads.

Last season, the Saints fell to Horseheads in the STAC semifinals. \n“It was very nerve-racking because this was the last chance to get it right and to win everything, because we’ve been doing so well,” senior Maya Haykel said. “I’m just really proud of my team. It was really exciting when (Crowley and Korchak) won.” \nHorseheads, which won the Section 4 Class A title last week, ended up with a 16-1 record in its bid for a fourth consecutive STAC championship. The Blue Raiders had their own post-meet celebration, with the girls letting out a loud cheer to celebrate their accomplishments. \n“We won some close matches this year and stayed together as a team, supported each other,” Blue Raiders head coach Dan Palmer said. “Some disappointment, but you learn more from losing than you do winning. It’s hard to take, but I don’t think any of us felt like we didn’t do everything we could do to win the STAC.” Buy Photo Binghamton Seton Catholic at Horseheads in the STAC girls tennis championship meet Oct. 20 at Horseheads High School.
