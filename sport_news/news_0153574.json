He's very quiet by nature, but when the lights come on, he's scrappy and willing to mix it up.” At 5-5, 180 pounds, Temple doesn't look the part of a starting outside linebacker for the state's No. 1-ranked Class 2A team. Yet, he's been a fixture in the Panthers' starting lineup since late in his freshman year, ranking second on the team in tackles as a junior and fourth as a sophomore. “Luke fits the mold of a lot of our kids,” Thompson said. “He's not the biggest, but he has a heart of gold.” This season, Temple has accounted for 33 tackles, two sacks, four quarterback hurries and a 7-yard fumble return for a touchdown in helping the Panthers to a 4-0 start. “Without question, Luke is one of the most respected players on the team — among the coaching staff and players — because of his day-to-day work ethic,” Thompson said, noting that Temple is a team Captain. Temple has also gained the respect of opposing coaches as he was voted second team All-District 2-2A as a juniorand first-team All-District as a sophomore. “Luke's always going to be in the right spot,” Thompson said. “He's a real solid kid that you can count on day in and day out. He's a pleasure to have on your football team. He was here when I first came here (three years ago), and I'm going to hate to see him go. He will definitely be missed.” Temple and the Panthers take the field again Friday night at Shreveport Loyola. FIRST QUARTER NOWN: When did you start playing football? Temple: When I was in the third grade at OCS, we had a YMCA team. NOWN: What memory stands out from your first season? Temple: What I remember most is playing football in the Louisiana heat. NOWN: What are your favorite and least favorite aspects of football? Temple: My least favorite part is the conditioning. My favorite part is the feeling you get after winning a game on Friday night. SECOND QUARTER NOWN: What has been the key to the Panthers' success this season? Temple: Everybody has bought into what coach Thompson is trying to get us toward. Everybody's on the same page. Page 2 of 2 - NOWN: What is the biggest improvement you have made since last year? Temple: It's my second year in this defense, so I understand everything better this year. It's nice to be able to go out there and play without having to think about what I need to do. NOWN: Which teammate has been the most pleasant surprise this season? Temple: Dalton Daniels, our Bandit (safety). He's one of the hardest workers on the team, and he's a lot more bought in this year. NOWN: What do the Panthers need to improve on with district play approaching? Temple: We need to get a lot better on special teams and keep getting better in the other phases. THIRD QUARTER NOWN: The defense struggled some during the preseason, but has answered the bell for the regular season. What has been the difference? Temple: We've just gone back to the basics. All 11 guys are doing their job. We have everybody back from last year, so everybody's more experienced. NOWN: What is the hardest you have ever been hit? Temple: My eighth grade year, we were playing Lee (Neville's feeder school), and I was playing fullback. They had this guy they called Big Charles — he's probably playing in college now — and he kept hitting me as soon as I got the ball. It was that way all day. NOWN: What is the hardest hit you have ever delivered? Temple: I was blocking for Jaylan (King) on punt return against Winnfield my sophomore year. I don't want to say I blindsided him, but I hit their guy pretty hard. FOURTH QUARTER NOWN: Outside of football, what is something you hope to accomplish during your senior year? Temple: I want to maintain a good GPA and get my ACT score up. NOWN: Do you have a favorite fishing story? Temple: This past summer, I was fishing in an aluminum boat with my friend (Taylor Lofton) and little brother (Seth Temple). They were paddling and I just had my rod sitting in the water. I lifted it up, and there was a bass on it. NOWN: What are your future plans? Temple: I plan on going to Louisiana Tech and probably majoring in business. NOWN: Why business? Temple: It just seems interesting. I feel like a business degree would open the door for me in a lot of different fields.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:47:22.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
