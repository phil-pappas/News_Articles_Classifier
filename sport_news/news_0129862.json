Posted: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 11:59 pm BOYS' TENNIS: Charbonneau rolling into state finals By KEVIN HARRIS News and Tribune Posted on Oct 20, 2015 by Kevin Harris NEW ALBANY — When a coach selects a key game or match in reviewing a player’s successful season, he or she usually does not pick a loss. However, New Albany head coach Bob Dusch says a setback at the Jasper Invitational Sept. 11-12 was a significant moment in the season of his No. 1 singles player, Logan Charbonneau. The junior lost to Bloomington South senior and former All-State player Will Piekarsky despite a hard-fought performance. “From that stage on in the year, Logan’s mental focus has been so much better,” Dusch said. “I’m not saying that a loss sometimes can do you good. But it seemed like he amped up his game after that match.” Charbonneau has not fallen in a match since the loss to Piekarsky as he enters this week’s IHSAA individual singles state finals at Park Tudor High School in Indianapolis with plenty of momentum. It will be Charbonneau’s first appearance in the state finals. He is the first New Albany singles player to reach state since former standout Alex Stewart in 2011. “It’s huge. It’s been my main goal since I started,” Charbonneau said about getting to the state finals. “[A state championship] is my main goal for my high school career. I’ve been trying to do it for three years now.” The setback to Piekarsky is one of two losses Charbonneau (26-2) has suffered this year. The other loss came in New Albany’s regular-season dual match with Providence on Sept. 4 when Charbonneau had to forfeit his No. 1 singles meeting with Pioneer senior Landon Carrico because of heat exhaustion. Charbonneau has won all seven of his postseason matches, dropping just 15 games in that stretch. The 2013 News and Tribune Sports Performance Yearly Player of the Year won his second individual sectional title in three seasons Oct. 8 at Silver Creek, beating Carrico in the final 6-0, 6-2. Last Saturday, Charbonneau claimed his first-ever Bedford North Lawrence individual singles regional championship. He defeated Bloomfield junior Brennan Hughes in the semifinal, 6-0, 6-2. Then Charbonneau ousted Evansville Mater Dei freshman Aaron Thompson in the title match, 6-2, 6-2. “I didn’t talk to him once during the match,” Dusch said about the regional final. “I did say something to the official about the fact that [Thompson] was taking too long on change-overs. I didn’t want that simply because Logan had this kid eating out of his hand, and I didn’t want the momentum to switch by this kid getting calmed down. “When the match is on the line, I can count on him not panicking, staying focused and doing what he needs to do.” Charbonneau said losing the 2013 Bedford individual regional final against former Greensburg standout Colin Rigney, 6-1, 6-2, helped him get mentally ready for last weekend’s regional. “It gave me some comfort being at a new place with good players,” said Charbonneau, whose career high school singles record is 65-15. “The more you play those big tournaments, the better you get at them. I’ve learned how to handle losing the last few years.” Charbonneau will face a tough challenge in Friday’s state quarterfinals as he plays undefeated Richmond junior Eric Hollingsworth (27-0). “I haven’t heard much about him. I’ve heard he’s a big player with a big serve,” Charbonneau said. “I’ve definitely got to keep that mental fortitude. I can’t let the small stuff get to me.” Dusch has been talking to a few of his fellow coaches to get a scouting report on Hollingsworth. “A couple of coaches have said he’s a big server. His strength is in his serving and his big forehand,” Dusch said. “The other thing is that he likes to play quick points. He doesn’t like to drag them out, which I think is to Logan’s advantage because Logan can be extremely patient and he works the court well. [Charbonneau] figures out his opponent in the course of a match, and that goes back to that mental toughness.” If Charbonneau beats Hollingsworth, he will either play Indianapolis North Central senior Steve Christie (25-1) or Yorktown senior Ian Landwehr (23-1) in Saturday’s semifinals at Park Tudor. Christie helped the Panthers win their third consecutive team state championship last weekend. “I think Logan’s got a good chance,” Dusch said about Charbonneau winning a state title. “The way Logan is playing right now — at least the last third of the season — he can be competitive with a lot of players in Indiana.” Charbonneau’s late-season hot streak has already garnered him a couple of honors in 2015. He made both the All-Hoosier Hills Conference team and All-IHSAA District 8 squad. In fact last Wednesday, District 8 coaches voted Charbonneau as this year’s top player in the district. Charbonneau praises Dusch and his personal coach, Brent Kilray, for assisting him in reaching the state finals. “I credit Bob and Coach Kilray for helping me get there,” Charbonneau said. “I’m playing with the most confidence I’ve ever had. I’m playing at the top of my game.” \nkevin.harris@newsandtribune.com With your existing account from... {* loginWidget *}", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T06:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:14:05.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
