After Johnson was injured late in the first half of Tuesday's 38-35 loss to the Toronto Argos, former Arizona Cardinal William Powell stepped into the starting role and looked terrific -- rushing for 49 yards on seven carries, with another 56 yards on seven passes from Henry Burris.\n\"I don't know the specifics, but we hope (Johnson) is ready for next year, for camp,\" said RedBlacks GM Marcel Desjardins. \"We had a pretty good idea at halftime (that it was severe), but we didn't know how bad it was. He's obviously pretty disappointed.\"\nAnd now, next man up, Powell, will carry the load.\n\"He is very dynamic in not only kickoff returns - he can catch, he can run and he's got a knack,\" said Desjardins. \"He's a lot like Jeremiah. He's got a lot of ability. Right now, he's our option. We have Travon Van, who we really like, here as well. But in terms of an overall guy, William is a lot more similar to what Jeremiah is like so it's easier to put him in and let him go.\"\nOn Wednesday, the RedBlacks released punter Brett Maher and will bring Ronnie Pfeffer off the six-game injured list to take over the punting and kickoff duties.\n\"If we're going to have an American doing the punting and kickoff, he's got to be a difference maker,\" said Desjardins. \"He hit some good balls, but Brett proved to be very inconsistent in the games. We just feel Brett wasn't to the level he was at last year - Brett would be the first guy to admit that. That's why we kept Pfeffer around for the long term, now it's a bit more of the short term.\"\nOnce the RedBlacks pull Pfeffer off the injured list, there will be money coming off Ottawa's salary cap room.\nAfter playing three games in 10 days, the RedBlacks are off for the rest of the week before resuming practice on Monday in preparation for next Friday's home game against Winnipeg.\nTwitter: @ TimCBaines\nRedBlacks' Jeremiah Johnson out for season with dislocated foot\nBy Tim Baines , Ottawa Sun First posted: Thursday, October 08, 2015 04:53 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 08, 2015 05:36 PM EDT\nThe Ottawa RedBlacks got bad news late Wednesday when they found out running back Jeremiah Johnson will miss the rest of the CFL season with a dislocated foot.\nThe good news is the RedBlacks already have another Jeremiah Johnson-like guy on their roster.
