MONTREAL – A day after calling Carey Price the best goalie in the NHL, Henrik Lundqvist was nearly just as good – better according to his teammates – during Thursday night’s showcase of Vezina Trophy winners.\nBut it was the rest of the Rangers who did not match up and Price’s Canadiens held on at the Bell Centre in the thrilling goalies duel that was much closer than 3-0 indicates.\n“I thought Hank played better than Price but we gave them so many opportunities off the rush,” Rangers defenseman Marc Staal said.\n“We’ve just got to play smarter, more patient and just start playing together, start playing as five-man units.”\nSo now the Rangers (3-2-0), who could not tie the game despite five shots on a second-period five-on-three that lasted one minute, 42 seconds, have their first losing streak of the season.\nThe Canadiens (5-0-0) are off to the best start in their storied franchise’s history. And the Rangers were unable to spoil a third team’s home opener.\n“We got schooled tonight,” an angry Rangers coach Alain Vigneault said. “We only created five chances five-on-five. They outplayed us in every area. If it weren’t for our goalie, the score would have been a lot worse.”\nPrice – who earned four major NHL postseason awards this June when he won the Hart Trophy as the MVP, the Vezina as the top goalie, the Ted Lindsay Award as the most outstanding player as voted upon by the Players Association and shared the William Jennings Trophy for fewest goals allowed – stopped 25 shots for his first shutout of the season.\nIt was the 35th of his career and the seventh time he’s blanked the Rangers. He is now 9-1-1 in his past 11 starts against the Rangers, allowing just nine goals in that span.\n“For some reason, he likes to play us,” said Lundqvist, the 2012 Vezina winner who made 29 saves.\n“You just know you can’t afford too many mistakes,” Lundqvist said. “We didn’t have the big opportunities to try and score against Price. You need that. As a goalie, you just need to focus on your performance. You can’t control how your team plays or how the game is played. The only thing you can do is give your team a chance to win.”\nLundqvist kept it 1-0 through much of the third period, making a glove stop on a wide-open David Desharnais from 12 feet out at 8:46 after he easily turned aside Brian Flynn’s breakaway at 2:43. Then, at 16:27, he stopped Devante Smith-Pelly’s tip-in try at the left post off Flynn’s feed.\nBut the Canadiens clinched it on Dale Weise’s shot from the right through Lundqvist’s pads at 17:55 and Tomas Plekanec added an empty-netter.\nTomas Fleischmann had given the Canadiens a 1-0 lead at 8:46 of the second period after Jesper Fast couldn’t control Emerson Etem’s pass at the Rangers’ blue line.\nIn the first period, Lundqvist got his glove on Alex Galchenyuk’s lined-up shot off an odd-man rush at 12:36.\nOne save Price did not have to make came at 1:07 of the third period, when Rick Nash poked the puck away from Desharnais at the Rangers’ blue line shotbut wristed his short-handed breakaway try inches wide.\nOn the Rangers’ failed two-man advantage, Price robbed Derek Stepan from close in on sharp angle on the left, then stopped Stepan again on a hard shot from the left faceoff circle seconds later. He also swiped his glove to stop Nash’s shot off a rush.\n“I don’t think I’ve ever played in a game where both goalies played that well,” Nash said.\nEmail: grossa@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T01:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T07:35:01.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
