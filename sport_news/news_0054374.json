Whether it's true or not, I don't know. ... Everything else is absurd. I don't care about the legal issues. If he's done something wrong, he has to own up to it and do his penance.\"\nMcGee declined comment to ESPN as part of its Outside the Lines pre-taped segment with Powell which aired on Tuesday morning. The report didn't reveal much additional information, but did cite five former players and/or recruits who corroborated some of the allegations in Powell's book.\nDeCOURCY: Pitino will survive this scandal\nOn OTL, Powell detailed what she wrote in her book — that Louisville, through Andre McGee, paid upwards of $10,000 over a four-year span from 2010-2014 for her to provide women to have sex with recruits and players. She did not receive an advance for the book and will make 10 percent of the book's gross sales.\nIn a radio interview Tuesday with Dan LeBatard, she asserted that money was not the reason she came forward (despite first approaching the NCAA with her story), and that she had no control over whether Louisville would get in trouble.\n\"I have no control of that,\" she said. \"As far as do I want … I don’t want anyone to get in trouble, but I have no control of that.\"\nThat seems to be the antithesis of the theory that Pitino is selling — the idea that she came forward for money.\nMORE: Powell could face serious criminal charges\n\"This is all about money. People will say and do anything for money,\" Pitino told ESPN. \"If these things are not true, and I keep using the word if, there's only one person who can give solutions to these problems: It's Andre McGee.\n\"It's time to give back to his team, his university and coaches and tell the NCAA the truth and tell everyone else, who was one time very proud of him, the truth. He owes that to his parents, to his university, to his teammates and his coaches. This is not only an NCAA issue here. It's more than that; there's more to it — his teammates that believed in him, his coaches that believed in him, the community that believed in him, put our trust in him to do the right things.\"\nPitino told ESPN that he and McGee have spoken just once since the book's allegations were published.\n\"(After) screaming so loud at him, his only response was: 'I never got paid any money for anything.'\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball-news/4658253-katina-powell-breaking-cardinal-rules-criminal-charges-prostitution-louisville", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBkyIp2.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Blake", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;basketball_ncaa&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Li", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Boeheim", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BBmhgZD.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Syracuse", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball-news/4657359-louisville-scandal-escorts-prostitutes-recruits-rick-pitino", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657286-louisville-prostitutes-escorts-breaking-cardinal-rules-review-ncaa-investigation", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfy3BX.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BBkkIUP&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Blake", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA42Hq5.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Former", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfE64B.img&quot;}}", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball-news/4658733-louisville-basketball-sex-scandal-escorts-prostitutes-rick-pitino-breaking-cardinal-rules-book", "http://www.sportingnews.com/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfF37k.img&quot;}}", "http://www.sportingnews.com/list/4657689-sex-scandals-athletes-nfl-baseball-nba-arrests-suspensions-prostitutes-crimes", "http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-basketball-news/4657012-louisville-basketball-escorts-prostitutes-book-players-recruits", "http://feed.theplatform.com/f/BKQ29B/MSN-Prime&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:47:18.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
