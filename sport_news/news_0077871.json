The two short sentences said \"The children look delicious. May I have a taste?\"\nThe family has two elementary school students.\nTerrified, they called the Champlin Police Department and posted on a Champlin Community Facebook page, saying, in part, \"Opened our mail today to this letter. Obviously my stomach started doing somersaults.\"\nThen the family began to receive magazine subscriptions.\nTy Schmidt, the Champlin Deputy Police Chief: \"Instead of a name on the address label it said things like 'tasty children,' along those lines.\"\nChamplin police traced the magazines and last Friday arrested Carrie Pernula. Police say she admitted to the threats and was released from jail Monday.\n\"She was angry because the kids were leaving things in her yard and I think being a little noisy, being kids, the way kids are,\" the deputy police chief said.\nWord of the threats spread quickly through social media and families were terrified for their children.\nChamplin police say its disturbing someone would create such fear.\nCopyright 2015 WCCO and Champlin Police via CNN.
