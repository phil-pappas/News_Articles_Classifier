Clemson’s defense held running back C.J. Prosise in check – 15 carries for 50 yards – but Kizer was 19-of-34 for 321 yards and two touchowns. \nWatson was 11-for-22 for just 97 yards. \nClemson will host Georgia Tech next Saturday in Death Valley. The Yellow Jackets have lost three in a row after a 38-31 loss to North Carolina earlier Saturday. \nDeath Valley was loud and electric at kickoff, and the Irish won the toss and elected to kick. It cost them a score as Clemson marched down the field. Artavis Scott Artavis Scott #3 5-10, 191Oldsmar, FL View Full Profile returned the opening kickoff 32 yards to the Clemson 36, and the Tigers came out in a 5-wide look. Watson took the snap and sliced up the left sideline for 38 yards, and six plays later hit Jordan Leggett Jordan Leggett #16 6-5, 252Navarre, FL View Full Profile from six yards out for the 7-0 lead just over two minutes into the game. \nNotre Dame failed to gain any yards on its opening possession, and a 15-yard punt set up Clemson on the Irish side of the field at the 40-yard line. Four plays into the drive, Watson hit Scott on a quick slant and Scott bounced off of two Irish defenders – who both fell to the ground – to complete a 13-yard scoring toss and Clemson had a 14-0 lead with 8:43 remaining in the first quarter. \nA long kickoff return and a pass interference penalty helped Notre Dame cut into the lead with a 46-yard field goal by Justin Yoon. Clemson led 14-3 with 5:32 remaining in the quarter. \nThat was it as far as offense in the first half as both teams struggled to not only move the ball but to get first downs. The Tigers and Irish went to intermission with Clemson clinging to the 14-3 lead, needing a break to create some separation in the second half. \nThat break came on the opening kickoff of the second half. Ammon Lakip Ammon Lakip #36 5-11, 200Alpharetta, GA View Full Profile kicked off and Irish returner C.J. Sanders fumbled it to begin with before heading upfield. Upfield is where he ran into Lakip, who caused a fumble that was recoverd by C.J. Fuller C.J. Fuller #27 5-9, 211Easley, SC View Full Profile at the Irish 29-yard line. Three plays later, Watson sprinted untouched up the middle for a touchown and a 21-3 Clemson lead. \nClemson had a couple of opportunities to increase the lead, but a dropped pass in the endzone by Scott and an interception thrown by Watson – again into the endzone – kept the Irish within hailing distance heading into the fourth quarter. \nThe Irish finally got in the endzone early in the fourth quarter. Kizer dropped back to pass and hit a wide open C.J. Prosise on a wheel route to complete a 56-yard scoring play. The Irish went for the two-point conversion and failed an Clemson held a 21-9 lead with 14:13 remaining in the contest. \nThe Tigers managed to put a short drive together, and Greg Huegel Greg Huegel #92 5-11, 180Blythewood, SC View Full Profile ended the six-play, 54-yard drive with a 35-yard field goal in rainy and windy conditions to put Clemson up 24-9 with 10:56 to play. \nThe Tigers did the Irish a favor on the kickoff, however, pooching a short kick that gave Notre Dame excellent field position and the Irish took advantage. It took Notre Dame just four plays to go 64 yards with Kizer rumbling in from the three, and it was 24-16 Clemson with 9:03 to play. \nThe Tigers couldn’t muster a drive – even after a 42-yard return by Artavis Scott – and a punt put the Irish on their 18-yard line. Kizer dropped back to pass on the first play from scrimmage, and senior linebacker B.J. Goodson B.J. Goodson #44 6-0, 245Lamar, SC View Full Profile stepped into the passing lane for the interception as Clemson took over on the Irish 35-yard line. \nHowever, the Tigers had another three-and-out and Huegel’s 45-yard attempt went wide left, giving Notre Dame life at their own 28 with just over four minutes to play.The Irish offense once again began to gash the Clemson defense, and Kizer completed a pass to Chris Brown for a first down, but Brown attempted to get into the end zone and Jayron Kearse Jayron Kearse #1 6-4, 224Fort Myers, FL View Full Profile knocked the ball loose. Goodson recovered the fumble at the Clemson four, averting disaster for the moment. \nThe Tigers took over with 2:09 left to play, and two running plays netted five yards and left Notre Dame with just one timeout remaining. On third-and-five from the nine, Watson’s number was called but he didn’t get any yards and Notre Dame called its last timeout with 1:13 to play. Andy Teasdall Andy Teasdall #32 5-11, 188Winston-Salem, NC View Full Profile ’s punt was short – into the wind – and Notre Dame took over at the Clemson 32-yard line with 1:05 to play. \nKizer fumbled on the first play from scrimmage – losing five yards – and the second down pass was incomplete with 37 seconds remaining. However, Kizer hit a long pass to the Clemson 18 and the Irish had a final flurry with time running out. The Irish then got a first down at the two with 15 seconds left to play, and an illegal substitution penalty put the ball inside the one. \nKizer then threw an easy one-yard lob to Torii Hunter to make it 24-22 with seven seconds left on the clock, and the Irish needed the two-point conversion for the tie. Notre Dame called Kizer’s number on the keeper, but he was swarmed by the Clemson defense short of the goal line as Death Valley erupted. \nHowever, there was still the matter of the kickoff – Notre Dame would try the onside kick – but Clemson recovered to seal the victory.
