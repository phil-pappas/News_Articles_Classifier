I don’t think that’s the issue,” Reid said. “I think they’re playing hard and doing the things they’ve done before.” \nReid also acknowledged that the tape — and numbers — rarely lie. \nIn the case of Hali, the formerly feared pass rusher has just six tackles and one sack through four games. That puts Hali on pace for the fewest stops of his 10-year career, and the fewest sacks since he had three in 2008, his third season in the league. \nMore importantly, the fact that the four-time Pro Bowl selection has been less effective has had a spillover effect on the rest of the defense. \nTeams are more easily able to double-team Justin Houston on the other side, or help with nose tackle Dontari Poe. And if a quarterback has more time to throw, it puts additional strain on the defensive backfield. \nThe result is the league’s 29th-ranked defense, allowing nearly 400 yards per game, and one that is tied with this week’s opponent, the Chicago Bears, for most points allowed. \n“We’ve got a good group,” Chiefs defensive coordinator Bob Sutton said. “You have to be very careful not to let your emotion, the highs of winning and the lows of losing, affect you.” \nYet emotion is exactly what often forces coaches to leave unproductive players on the field too long. They remember what a player has done in the past rather than take stock of what he is capable of doing in the present, their image of him clouded by sentimentality and time. \nHali, who has not been available to reporters this week, has certainly made it difficult to view him as anything other than a star. He has 801⁄2 sacks in his career, trailing only Derrick Thomas and Neil Smith for most in franchise history. He had 141⁄2 during the 2010 season, which still stands as the fifth-best mark in the Chiefs record book. \nHe also has proven invaluable in tutoring Houston, now one of the NFL’s top pass rushers, and Dee Ford, a first-round pick who is being groomed as Hali’s successor. \n“One of the foundations of being successful is the", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:54:02.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
