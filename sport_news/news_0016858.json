The principals of different schools argued with the Chief Minister that the proposed Bill was not in public interest and would harm the interests of the state. The members of the delegation requested the Chief Minister to take back the decision. Harish Rawat assured the delegation that, “The state government will not interfere in the internal management and functioning of private schools”. He said anything that had a direct or indirect relation with the functioning of private schools would not be introduced without consulting the association. He advised the school heads to be transparent and open about the admission procedure, fee structure and selection of students so that no contradictions or conflicts arise. The delegation assured the Chief Minister that they would start working with immediate effect on formulating a self-regulatory mechanism in order to avoid any conflicts. Prem Kashyap, president of the PPSA, Chhaya Khanna, PS Kalra, Gopal Agarwal, Col AQ Hussain (retd), DS Mann, HS Mann, Dr Deepak Arora and Brother Dennis were part of the delegation that met the Chief Minister.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:15:50.000+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
