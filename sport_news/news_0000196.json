Worley, 41, of Verona, was charged in a two-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in Springfield, Mo.\nTodayâ€™s indictment alleges that Worley attempted to use a minor, identified as Jane Doe #1, to produce child pornography between Dec. 9, 2014, and April 16, 2015. Worley is also charged with receiving child pornography over the Internet.\nDickinson cautioned that the charges contained in this indictment are simply accusations, and not evidence of guilt.

It was investigated by the Southwest Missouri Cyber Crime Task Force and the Aurora, Mo., Police Department.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T01:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T14:30:55.689+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
