A lot of people say, 'Cheer up, I hope you can meet Novak',\" Zhang said.\n\"What I was focusing on was the first round. I'm really happy. I'll prepare for the next match. I know Novak is number one in the world. I will watch his videos and I will just enjoy this match.\"\nZhang added: \"I will try my best to prepare for the match. I will check his videos. Is he playing today or tomorrow?
