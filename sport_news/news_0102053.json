The noise and the predominance of green under the Millennium Stadium's closed roof made it feel like the game could have been in Dublin. \nIreland won all its pool games, justifying its pre-World Cup tag of Europe's leading contender. \nThe French were blown away after the break and their first loss in the pool stage set up a quarterfinal against New Zealand, back in Cardiff on Saturday. Eight years ago, the teams met at the same stage, in the same stadium and on the same night — and France won 20-18 in one of the most memorable wins at a World Cup. France also upstaged New Zealand in the 1999 World Cup semifinals, and had a narrow defeat in the final four years ago. \nFrance's points on Sunday came from three penalties, and the team didn't come close to scoring a try. \nMany pundits predicted that the Irish had been saving themselves for this game, and they produced easily their best performance of the World Cup. \nBut there was collateral damage from a bruising game. \nSexton had already been winded when he was smashed by a perfectly timed tackle from France No. 8 Louis Picamoles in the 24th minute. After receiving lengthy treatment, he was taken off with an apparent rib injury, although British broadcaster ITV said it was a groin problem. \nO'Connell's injury appeared worse. He clutched the back of his right leg, slammed his right hand against the ground and writhed in pain after getting hurt at a ruck in the final move of the first half. He was taken off on a motorized stretcher, long after the teams had disappeared down the tunnel, and it could be the end of the World Cup — and his international career — for the 35-year-old stalwart. \nO'Mahony, a first-choice flanker of growing influence, was taken off in the 55th after his knee appeared to buckle following Pascal Pape's tackle. \nIreland also could potentially lose flanker Sean O'Brien for the quarterfinals, as he appeared to strike Pape in the ribs after barely 30 seconds of the game and could now be cited. \nAn absorbing first half, short on running rugby but packed with brutal hits, finished with the Irish leading by three points. They should have been further ahead, with Keith Earls dropping the ball from Tommy Bowe's pass with the try-line seemingly open. Bowe's break was the only clean one of the first 40 minutes. \nIreland's players were rampant at the start of the second half and pinned France back. Robbie Henshaw left Mathieu Bastareaud clutching at thin air and ran 40 meters before being tackled near the line. After a series of phases, Kearney ran onto Conor Murray's pass, through Frederic Michalak and grounded. \nIan Madigan, Sexton's replacement, couldn't convert but Ireland was 14-6 ahead — a big lead in this type of game. \nMorgan Parra's penalty reduced the deficit but Murray touched down next to the posts in the 72nd after more relentless pressure. By the time Madigan's penalty wrapped up the scoring, France was well beaten. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T21:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:50:31.805+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
