It means I suppose that there would be regulation changes, which have already been anticipated for 2017 so there's nothing new,\" he added.\nThe sport switched from V8 engines to a complex V6 turbo hybrid power unit last year. The alternative is likely to be a 2.2 litre V6 twin turbo similar to those used in the US Indy Car series.\nIn the V8 era, Cosworth provided an alternative to the manufacturers but they couldn't afford the huge costs of developing the new power unit and withdrew. Ecclestone indicated Cosworth would be interested in returning with a less complicated option but others were also in the frame.\nHe said the introduction of a different engine would not turn the championship into a two-tier series and pointed out that decades ago teams had a choice of using turbo engines or normally-aspirated ones.\nAny rules change would have to be approved by the FIA's F1 commission and World Motor Sports Council but for 2017 it could be passed by a majority rather than requiring unanimity.\nEcclestone said the FIA and president Jean Todt were on board, and Ferrari's long-standing right to veto technical changes could be overcome. \"It depends what the veto rights are. Bit complicated actually,\" he said.\n\"If by chance the FIA and commercial rights holders agree, it doesn't make a lot of difference what other people vote. It's called democracy,\" he added.\nSainz crashes again\nAnother crash involving Spaniard Carlos Sainz brought the rescheduled qualifying session for the US GP to a halt after just five minutes in rain-hit Austin. Sainz lost control of his Toro Rosso at Turn Four, his car slamming into the barriers again, just two weeks after his high-speed crash in Russia. He was unhurt and returned to the pits on a scooter as rain continued to fall. Later, Nico Rosberg claimed the pole position. Organisers cancelled the third qualifying session as conditions worsened with the race grid based on results from the second qualifying session topped by Rosberg. Hamilton will start alongside him.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T11:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T05:26:52.725+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
