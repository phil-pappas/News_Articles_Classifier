Bergen Tech slumped to 9-1 and 5-1. \nWhat made Frascolla's golden goal, well, golden, was erasing a bit of painful history. Rewind back to Sept. 10 when the Mustangs trailed by a goal late at the Techsters. Frascolla smashed a penalty kick which goalkeeper Brandon Duffy blocked. Tech eventually won, 3-2. \n\"He made a great save that day,\" said the tall Uruguayan defender and primary penalty kick specialist. \nThat wasn't the case on Tuesday. \nFollowing a goalless 80 minutes, Clifton gained possession in the midfield with Facundo Frascolla—yes Bruno's freshman brother—hitting speedy sophomore Michael Algieri on the left wing. Algieri's cross clipped the arm of a Bergen Tech defender in the penalty area, allowing Bruno Frascolla to add a footnote to the his brilliant prep career. \nDuffy had no chance this time as Frascolla slammed a right-footed shot from the shot into the upper-left corner. \nRedemption for Frascolla but more importantly a sixth-consecutive win for the Mustangs. \n\"We're only one game back in the Liberty but I told the team that we can only take care of our games and will need some help from the rest of the league,\" said Clifton second-year boss Stan Lembryk, whose side played at rival Passaic on Thursday. \nClifton had the better of the run of play in the opening stanza. \nAfter a few tactical adjustments at the break, the Mustangs pushed for a breakthrough moment and nearly had it when Algieri slipped a pass in the area to Facundo Frascolla, who crushed a right-footed drive at Duffy (five saves). \nClifton's compact defending excelled, with right back Alex Guzman and Bruno Frascolla keeping things tidy. \n\"We played tight and didn't let them go through,\" Guzman said. \"We pressured them [Bergen Tech] all over the field and made sure their top goal scorers wouldn't get good looks. Most importantly we got the clean sheet.\" \nTech's Alex Whang delivered a hard shot from 30 yards that sophomore 'keeper Jake Padula handled easily midway through the second stanza, but that was it for the Knights. \nThe focus shifts back to a knockout match this weekend. \nThe Mustangs have the benefit of playing the Passaic County Coaches' Association Tournament at home in this Saturday's semifinal match with ninth-seeded Wayne Valley at 4 p.m. The opening match is Hawthorne Christian Academy and Wayne Hills at 2. \nThe regular season continues with El Clasico II on Tuesday when Passaic County Tech invades the Stadium at 5 o'clock. Then the Mustangs travel to Paterson for a league match with Kennedy at 4 in Paterson. \nLast Saturday, the Mustangs pushed through to the Passaic County Tournament semifinals, eliminating fourth-seeded Passaic County Tech, 2-1, in Wayne. The Bulldogs conceded both goals in the first half. \nSenior Frankie Salensky and Algieri staked the Mustangs to the insurmountable lead. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:28:39.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
