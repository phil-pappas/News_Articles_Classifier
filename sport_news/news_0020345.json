(AP Photo/Mike McCarn) more > By STEVE REED - Associated Press - Monday, October 26, 2015 \nCHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) - Mike Tolbert has heard the critics question the legitimacy of the Carolina Panthers’ unbeaten start to the season. \nThe veteran fullback laughs it off, saying he couldn’t care less. \n“You can doubt us all you want,” Tolbert said. “We’re just going to keep pounding, just like our motto says.” \nTolbert kept pounding Sunday night - right into the end zone. Tolbert scored two touchdowns - bulldozing over four players to get in on one pass play - and Cam Newton ran for one score and threw for another as the Panthers defeated the Philadelphia Eagles 27-16 on Sunday night to improve to 6-0 for the first time in franchise history. \n“That’s the motto of this franchise is to keep pounding and we showed a little bit of that,” Newton said. \nTolbert epitomized that motto. \nWith the Panthers lead 14-6, Tolbert caught a pass in the flat from Newton at the Eagles 2, got knocked 3 yards back by Malcolm Jenkins, regained his momentum and bulled his way into the end zone through four Eagles. \nWith the win, the Panthers became the fifth NFL team this season to reach 6-0, joining New England, Denver, Cincinnati and Green Bay. \nThe Panthers held Sam Bradford to 205 yards passing and sacked him five times, including two by Jared Allen to help seal the win. Ryan Mathews ran for 97 yards on just six carries, including a 63-yard touchdown, but the Eagles (3-4) were only able to convert three interceptions by Newton into six points. \n“We talk about responses to turnovers and we end up kicking two field goals,” Eagles coach Chip Kelly said. “Our defense did a good job of creating turnovers for us. We’ve got to turn those into seven and not three (points).” \nNewton finished 14 of 24 for 197 yards. Two of his picks hit off the hands of his wide receivers. \n“We didn’t play our best brand of football tonight,” Newton said. \nNewton took another step toward rewriting the NFL record book. \nIt marked the fourth time this season and 28th time in his career he has run and thrown for a touchdown in the same game - only three behind Hall of Famer Steve Young for the league record. \nJonathan Stewart ran for 119 yards for Carolina, which has won a franchise-record 10 straight regular-season games dating to last season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:34:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:05:31.231+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
