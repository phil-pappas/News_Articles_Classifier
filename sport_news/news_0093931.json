Lahiri and Thongchai will face American duo Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker.\n\nIn the past year, Lahiri has risen from being one of the upcoming prospects into one of the hottest players out of Asia, He has now in the Top-40 and has also made his PGA Tour card. But Lahiri also understands his role as an ambassador of Indian golf. And, a lot of his colleagues want to know more about India and Indian golf.\n\n\"Whether it's Jason (Day) or Adam (Scott) or Steven (Bowditch), all the guys I've played with this week, are curious to know what it is back home. How many courses do we have? How big is golf in India, how much is it watched or talked about? I keep getting asked. So it's been good. to be able to share that.\"\n\nLahiri called his pairing with Thongchai - who is one of Asian golf's legends and the oldest player on the International Team at 45 - as a natural one. \"I think it was quite natural for Thongchai and me to be teamed up.\n\nHonestly, I can't ask for a better partner. Even in a stellar lineup like we have, I think he's probably one of the most consistent players. After a breakthrough year for him, where he finished Tied-5th at the PGA Championship, Anirban believes he 'belongs here' and is confident of a good show. \"I think the way all of us are playing, we are all pretty confident with our games right now. It's just about gelling well tomorrow,\" Anirban added.\n\nHe also feels the rookies, including Sangmoon Bae of Korea, Danny Lee of New Zealand and Australian Steven Bowditch and himself, can provide the sparks for the International Team to rise to the occasion. \"We're all young and we're all fearless. We haven't experienced the low yet when it comes to the Presidents Cup, and I think that's going to work in our favour.\"\n\n\n\nThe Americans are spearheaded by World No. 1 Jordan Spieth and have in their midst Bubba Watson (World No. 4), Fowler (World No. 5), Dustin Johnson (World No. 8) and Zach Johnson (World No. 10). Between Spieth and Zach, they have three Majors in 2015.\n\nOn the International side, there is Jason Day (World No. 2), Oosthuizen (World No. 11), Adam Scot (World No. 12) and Hideki Matsuyama (World No. 13).
