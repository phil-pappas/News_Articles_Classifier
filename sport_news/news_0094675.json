After suffering a groin injury before a pre-season game on Oct. 1 againt the Montreal Canadiens, Senators goalie Andrew Hammond was hopeful he'd be able to scoff at the timeline by the club's medical staff that he wouldn't be able to return for at least two weeks.\n\"I've always been someone who doesn't like not practising and not being able to contribute in whatever my role is that day,\" Hammond said in an interview Saturday. \"When you're on the training table you're not able to do that as much.\n\"I've also been someone who feels like they heal a little bit quicker than others but with this one it was my first real groin injury and you don't know what to expect. When it initially happened I thought I'd be back a lot quicker than I was but from (the medical staff) said I guess I did come back a bit quicker.\n\"In my mind, you always want to make some superhero-like return and turn a two-week injury into a couple days. That didn't happen. I'm healthy now and that's all that's important.\"\nLast spring, it was hard to spend anytime alone with The Hamburglar.\nHammond couldn't go anywhere without attracting a crowd. He was the media darling with lights, cameras, tape recorders and notepads stuck in his face every time he entered the club's dressing room.\nBut as the Senators wrapped up their morning skate before facing the Nashville Predators in a 4-3 shootout loss at the Canadian Tire Centre, The Hamburglar sat alone at his locker and took off his equipment as No. 1 goalie Craig Anderson addressed a crowd of media across the room.\nTimes, they are a changing.\nNow, with a three-day break before the New Jersey Devils come to town Thursday, nobody is sure if we'll see Hammond then or Saturday against the Arizona Coyotes but he noted he's ready to go whenever he gets the call from coach Dave Cameron and goalie coach Rick Wamsley.\n\"I feel good,\" Hammond said. \"With the way the schedule has been, it's been tough to get a full practice with the team. But whenever there's been a practice or a morning skate I've felt good. I'm just continuing to work and be ready for when my name does get called.\n\"I feel healthy and my game is going in the right direction. All-in-all, I'm very happy with where my game is at right now.\"\nComing out of camp, Hammond was hoping to show that what happened last spring wasn't a fluke. The Senators clearly don't think so because they signed him to a new three-year, $4.05 million contract and sent top prospect Robin Lehner packing to the Buffalo Sabres.\nHammond felt good about the way he played until he got hurt.\n\"I felt like it was going well, with the exception of the Winnipeg (pre-season) game, I was pretty happy with my camp overall,\" said Hammond. \"I felt like I was going in the right direction and felt ready for the start of the season.\n\"It's just one of those things. (Injuries) happen all the time and often at the worst time but in the big picture this, I don't want to say a good thing, but it could be a lot worse timing-wise. It's one of those things you work through in practice. I'm just happy I'm healthy and I feel ready to help the team whenever they need me.\"\nWhether he plays next Thursday or not it will be over three weeks since he saw his last live action the next time he steps.\n\"That's part of the business. That's part of why injuries suck,\" Hammond said. \"I think I know what I need to do in practice to essentially make my practices into games and make sure I'm getting what I need out of them so when that does happen I kind of give myself the best opportunity to be successful.\"\nAfter losing the net to Anderson with the club in a 2-0 hole against the Montreal Canadiens last spring, Hammond is determined to get back in and show the club he worked hard during the summer to make improvements.\n\"The way the regular season ended, the post-season wasn't how I wanted it to end, and I think that gives you a little bit more motivation through the summer to make sure those things don't happen again,\" he said.\n\"It just makes you a little bit more eager to come back and get some redemption. It's the old adage: When you lose a game, you want to play the next night. When you have a whole summer, it allows you to build that burning desire inside and makes you want to play again.\"\nThe Hamburglar is ready to come off the shelf.\nTwitter: @sungarrioch\nSponsored\nGARRIOCH\nHammond back down to Earth\nBy Bruce Garrioch , Ottawa Sun First posted: Sunday, October 18, 2015 04:11 PM EDT | Updated: Sunday, October 18, 2015 08:35 PM EDT\nEven The Hamburglar has found out he's only human.
