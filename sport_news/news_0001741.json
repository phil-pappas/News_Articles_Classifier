The HCP administration, while talking to ‘The News’, confirmed that the blue turf project may face a delay as construction of the new baseline is in progress and its debris remains lying outside the HCP. According to sources, the construction will take some more time to complete with a period of one month also required for baseline to be strengthened. The project will then be finished by mid-December if everything goes smoothly. The contractor told this scribe that he is quite hopeful that the project would be completed before December. The blue turf project at HCP has been delayed for quite some time due to poor condition of its baseline. A source added that the Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) is itself keenly waiting for the completion of its blue turf project and wants to inaugurate the blue turf by organising the National Hockey Championship at HCP. If the blue turf project gets completed by December, the PHF will certainly look to organise the National Championship there, the source said. After completion of the HCP project, 13 astro turfs — blue and green — will be available for organising hockey events across the province. The facility of synthetic turf will be available in Karachi, Hyderabad, Mirpurkhas, Nawabshah, Thatta, Khairpur and Larkana. It is believed that the old green astro turf will be shifted to Karachi Hockey Association’s (KHA) complex in Gulshan- e-Iqbal. KHA secretary Farooq Khan said that all agreements and paper work regarding this had been completed and the Sindh government would do the job of installing the old turf at KHA complex. He hoped that the development work at KHA complex would be initiated soon.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T22:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T09:46:20.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
