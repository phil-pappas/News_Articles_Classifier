It’s our rivalry and it’s for the region championship.”\nSky View head coach Craig Andher\nSMITHFIELD — Save the playoffs, Friday night’s matchup between Mountain Crest and Sky View may be the biggest of the season in any region. For the first time in their history — 34 to be exact — the two teams head into it without a loss.\nThe winner of the contest will claim the Region 1 title outright, so both teams know what is at stake. Throw in the fact that these two schools are located close to one another within the confines of the Cache Valley, the rival teams will certainly be leaving it all out on the field.\nAll that said, the Bobcats are still sticking to their weekly routine.\n“It’s a big game. It’s our rivalry and it’s for the region championship,” Sky View head coach Craig Andher. “I don’t know if it’s any bigger than any other game, I just think there’s more excitement around this game. We haven’t prepared any different.”\nAnd if you are trying to pick out the most exciting high school game to go to this weekend, look no further than this contest. Postseason implications aside, the Mustangs and Bobcats have been romping through their schedules, averaging 39.3 and 39.8 points per game, respectively.\n\nWatch the game live \n\nBoth teams average scoring margin sit at 20-plus points per game, and it’s safe to say that this matchup has the potential of a shootout.\nSky View's Garrison Beach is one player Mountain Crest will have to key in on. The senior quarterback has played an integral part of the Bobcats' 2015 success. Not only is he a magician under center by passing the ball for 2,598 yards and 29 touchdowns thus far in the season, but Beach is a true dual-threat quarterback as well.\nBeach has seven rushing touchdowns to go with his 547 yards on the ground, and the Mustangs will have their hands full trying to contain the Sky View quarterback, who averages 8.29 yards per carry.\n“Beach has been stellar. He’s an amazing quarterback,” Andher said. “He’s kind of reestablished what hard work is. (His performance this season) is not by accident.”\nBut if there is a defense that can contain the senior signal-caller, who Mustang head coach Mark Wootton dubbed “extremely smart,” it’s Mountain Crest’s. The Mustangs have allowed just 76 points in eight games this season.\nWith 17 sacks and four interceptions to its name, Mountain Crest will be looking to swarm to the ball and make plays on the defensive end to stop a high-powered Bobcat attack.\n“Our (players) on the defense just fly to the ball,” Wootton said.\nThis 35th meeting between the schools will be the last before their district grows by one. Next year, Ridgeline High School in Millville, Utah, just north of Mountain Crest, will make its grand opening, raising the total of Cache Valley School District high schools to four.\nHowever, another school in the district, Cache High, doesn’t have a football team, leaving the Mustangs and Bobcats as the teams in the district for now.\nEven so, Andher believes the rivalry doesn’t need any added juice to get the players motivated and fans out to the games.\n“If we were two teams that had won zero games, it would still be a pretty exciting game,” he said. “It’s a great rivalry here that’s been here for many years.”\nMake sure you get to the game early, too. These two teams seem to always attract a crowd when they play, and even hold the state record for a state title game with 19,877 fans in attendance of their Class 3A title game back in 1987.\nKickoff is scheduled for 7 p.m. at Sky View High.\nTwitter: @GriffDoug", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T23:33:55.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
