(Photo: USA TODAY Sports) \nDon Mattingly won't return as manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers for the 2016 season. \nAfter five seasons at the helm, Mattingly and the Dodgers have reached a mutual agreement to part ways, according to a baseball official with direct knowledge of the decision. The person spoke to USA TODAY Sports on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the topic. \nCBS Sports first reported the story. \nMattingly, who had one more year remaining on his contract, won three straight Nationals League West division titles with the Dodgers and reached the postseason in each of the last for seasons. However, the Dodgers advanced beyond the NL Division Series just once under Mattingly. Indiana's Don Mattingly an All-Star again as coach \nAnd after another early exit from the postseason, Mattingly's future with the organization became uncertain. The Dodgers, whose -- $300 million payroll -- the largest in the majors, season ended abruptly in 2015 when they lost to the New York Mets in five games in the NLDS. \nWhen asked about his future with the organization after the Dodgers were eliminated, Mattingly was irate. \n\"Seriously, you're asking me that now?\" said Mattingly, who was in his first season under the new duo of president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman and general manager Farhan Zaidi. \n\"When you're playing, we all expect to be back. â€¦ Donnie he expects to be back and everyone here thinks he'll be back managing this club,\" said outfielder Andre Ethier, who was involved in a public argument with Mattingly in the dugout in Game 5. \nMattingly's managerial career began in 2011 when he was hand-picked by Joe Torre. He has a 446-363 (.551) record as manager, sixth all-time among winningest franchise history. \nAs they search for a replacement, the Dodgers will face significant competition, as four other clubs are also seeking new managers.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T20:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T05:05:23.258+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
