By KRISTIN SHARP- ksharp@shawmedia.com \nOSWEGO – While coaches would like to see a more disciplined team on the field by Week 7, mistakes and costly penalties continued to hinder the Plainfield East football team after a strong start Friday at Oswego. Related Links \nThe Bengals were able to answer Oswego’s first score, and Plainfield East trailed, 14-7, at intermission But the Panthers quickly took control in the second half en route to a 28-7 Southwest Prairie victory. \nOswego (6-1, 5-0) clinched a playoff bid. \nAfter a 21-yard touchdown pass from Oswego quarterback Steven Frank to Carter Turnquist, East’s second drive of the game stalled after two penalties and an incomplete pass. Oswego fumbled the ensuing punt, however, and the Bengals (2-5, 2-3) recovered at the Oswego 39. \nOn the first play from scrimmage, East quarterback Matt Mazurkiewicz connected with Jalen Hutt for the touchdown, and Kyle Hassert’s extra point tied the game, 7-7, with 25 seconds left in the first quarter. \n“We had a great game plan and the kids executed well in the first half. We left a few plays out on the field,” East coach Mike Romeli said. “We played really hard. They’re a great ball club, and to come here on their homecoming, that was our plan – to try and get some plays early.” \nEast struggled to get into the red zone the rest of the game. \nOswego took the lead with 2:41 to play in the first half, as Frank threw a 26-yard pass to Brice Robinson to lead, 14-7. \nOswego took the kickoff to start the second half and put together an eight-play, 88-yard drive highlighted by a 43-yard run by Eric Vargas Jr. Brennan Burdo caught an 11-yard touchdown pass from Burdo. \nThe Panthers’ defense held firm and stopped the Bengals again, as East drove to the Oswego 25. Mazurkiewicz was intercepted on the 3-yard line to end East’s best drive of the half with 6.3 seconds left in the third quarter. Oswego added its final score on a 60-yard drive that ended with a 3-yard dash by fullback Chad Marsh with 2:10 to play. \nMazurkiewicz finished 8 of 27 for 112 yards with one TD and one interception. Frank was 10 for 18 for 125 yards and three TDs. \nEast (2-5, 2-3) will close its season with two SPC opponents, Romeoville (1-6) and Plainfield Central (0-7. \n“We’ve got two really winnable games coming down and hopefully end the season 4-5,” Romeli said. “We knew this was a big game. Last week was a big game and we won, and unfortunately we’re not going to make the playoffs, but we still have a lot to play for.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T10:04:06.727+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
