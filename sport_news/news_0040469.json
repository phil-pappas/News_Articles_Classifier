Oh, sure, he was addressing a crowd at the school's Homecoming parade, so he was just telling the masses what they wanted to hear -- \"I guarantee you we're going to win tomorrow night!\" -- but that boast traveled at the speed of Twitter, so Arizona was sure to be aware of it at the team hotel in Boulder, with the likely reaction being, \"Oh realllly?\" \nWe'll grant that the Buffaloes have improved under MacIntyre, in his third season at Colorado, but that's some big talk for a guy who is 1-19 in conference games. But look at it from the Buffs' perspective. A home game against Arizona (4-2 overall, 1-2 Pac-12) looks like their best chance to end their league skid and go home happy. \nThe Buffs (3-3, 0-2) lost 48-23 at Arizona State last week and had a team meeting Sunday. \n\"I think that a lot of good things were said,\" Colorado quarterback Sefo Liufau said at the team's press conference this week. \n\"It was run by players, brought up by players. The coaches can only do so much for us -- they can give us all the right techniques, all the right plays -- but you know it's up to us to go out there and execute. And so, ultimately, we came out with a better feeling and better understanding of what needs to be done.\" \nOnce the game gets going, all the pregame posturing doesn't much matter. \nYou might remember another Colorado Buffalo making a bold prediction back in 2014, this one in basketball. After Arizona beat CU in McKale Center, Colorado forward Xavier Johnson looked ahead to the rematch in Boulder and said, \"That'll be a 20-point blowout.\" \nWell, kind of. It was 88-61 ... for Arizona. \nLet's take a look at Saturday's matchup: THREE WILDCATS TO WATCH \nQB Anu Solomon -- We wrote more about Solomon here -- check out why he's the chicken soup and mashed potatoes of this Arizona team -- but also know this about him: He has attempted 167 consecutive passes without an interception, dating back to the third quarter of last season's Fiesta Bowl. (Watch: Just mentioning this will be a jinx. The Buffaloes have an interception in every game this season.) \nS Will Parks -- Parks set the \"hard edge\" tone last week, possibly causing a sonic boom with his crushing and oh-so-legal hit on Oregon State wide receiver Jordan Villamin. Should give Colorado's standout receiver Nelson Spruce something to think about when he comes across the middle. Parks leads Arizona in tackles (41), pass break-ups (six) and forced fumbles (two). \nLB Jake Matthews -- The junior is in line to become the first Wildcat to start consecutive games at middle linebacker this season. Such has been the state of injuries at the position. Matthews, who hadn't played in the middle before last week, looked like he knew what he was doing, making five tackles and helping the rest of the defense get organized. THREE BUFFALOES TO WATCH \nQB Sefo Liufau - - The junior has been battling injuries and a sore body -- he was sacked eight times by Arizona State last week, although he still found time to throw for 389 yards. This will be Liufau's third crack at Arizona; he is a combined 41 of 65 for 464 yards, with two touchdown and three interceptions, against the Cats. \n\"It looks like he's getting bigger and stronger every year, and he's more confident in what they're doing,\" Rodriguez said of Liufau, who is listed at 6-foot-4, 240 pounds. \"He reminds you of (former Oregon quarterback Marcus) Mariota in that he's hard to bring down. He's a big guy.\" \nRB Phillip Lindsay -- The sophomore ran for 114 yards on 17 carries against the Wildcats last season, and he leads the Buffs this year with 331 yards and five touchdowns on 64 carries. Lindsay (5-8, 180) is quick and shifty. MacIntyre calls him the team's \"Tasmanian Devil.\" \nWR Nelson Spruce -- Colorado reports that he set or tied 31 school receiving records through his junior season. That's a lot. Arizona did a decent job against him last season; Spruce caught nine passes, but they went for just 89 yards and no scores. HE SAID IT \n\"They show up to work. Even when we were playing so badly those two weeks, they still showed up to work with a good attitude. They understood it. I didn't have to say anything. They understood it. I just didn't think we were as competitive and had an edge about us for a couple of weeks. We got a little of that back last week.\" -- Rich Rodriguez, on his team bouncing back last week after losses to UCLA and Stanford ARIZONA INJURY UPDATE \nProbable : WR Trey Griffey (foot), LB Haden Gregory (knee) \nQuestionable: CB DaVonteâ€™ Neal (hamstring), DL Jeff Worthy (concussion), RB Nick Wilson (foot) \nOut: LB Derrick Turituri (hip), LB Scooby Wright (foot) \nWhat it means: Wilson's foot injury is troubling. Trainers were looking at his shoulder when he left last week's game for a while in the first half. \nRodriguez likes his depth at running back, though, and backup Jared Baker rushed for a career-high 123 yards last week, including a 73-yard burst. True freshman Orlando Bradford is showing a good mix of size, speed and awareness. \nJonathan Haden and Tyrell Johnson -- hybrid slot receivers -- are others who could see carries Saturday. PREDICTION \nColorado is dealing with key injuries of its own, especially at linebacker, which isn't any way to go into a game against a team with a running attack like Arizona's (even if Nick Wilson can't play). The Buffaloes' rush defense ranks 10th in the conference. \nWe've seen Arizona's defense can get manhandled up front by UCLA and Stanford -- two teams with talented, veteran offensive lines, but those qualities don't apply to Colorado's offensive line, another injury-plagued unit. \nThe Cats don't have so much of an edge that they can afford to be knuckleheads with turnovers, but all things being equal ... \nArizona 38, Colorado 28.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:37:55.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
