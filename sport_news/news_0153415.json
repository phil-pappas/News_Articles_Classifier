Mandatory Credit: Mike Carter-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Mike Carter-USA TODAY Sports) \nEAST LANSING — A Big Ten championship – how quaint. \nIn the era of the College Football Playoff and its weekly projections from every corner of the internet, and in the Michigan State era of actually being a viable contender for that playoff, the pursuit of a conference championship seems lost in the noise at times. Mark Dantonio hears it, though. \n“It’s a really big deal to me,” said Dantonio, whose No. 2 Spartans (4-0) will start the race today at homecoming against Purdue (1-3). “We coach in the Big Ten so that’s what I’m concerned about. I think coaches basically put themselves in a bubble. I don’t care what conference you’re in, you sort of submerge yourself in that conference. You really don’t know too much what’s going on in other conferences, other than what you may read time to time or as it gets near the end of the season. I just think that’s the norm. \n“When I was at Cincinnati, I couldn’t have told you what was going on in the Big Ten. I was concerned with what was going on in the Big East. I think that’s just the norm for me. It’s all about what we do now. It’s the start of something special.” MSU wants more out of its blitz vs. Purdue \nAnd, well, it’s basically essential for the other stuff too. \n“You’ve got to get there to get to the next step,” MSU senior center Jack Allen said of the four-team playoff. “You’ve got to win the East, you’ve got to win the West. That’s the stepping stone to making it.” \nPurdue may be little more than a stepping stone toward bigger games, based on the Boilermakers’ performance so far. MSU then heads to Rutgers next week before things really heat up Oct. 17 at No. 22 Michigan – and potentially culminate Nov. 21 at No. 1 Ohio State. \nThen again, it’s uncertain exactly what kind of team MSU is going to put on the field today. It appears likely both starting offensive tackles, Jack Conklin and Kodi Kieler, will sit with knee injuries. Starting safety RJ Williamson (leg) and starting tight end Josiah Price (ankle) also hobbled off late in last week’s 30-10 win over Central Michigan. \nThe Spartans are still sorting out primary ball-carrying duties, with No. 3 back Gerald Holmes coming off the bench to provide a spark against CMU with a pair of fourth-quarter touchdowns. MSU tight ends show depth, ability to catch and block \nAnd they’re still sorting out the defensive backfield, with starting cornerback Demetrious Cox a candidate to be a starting safety, starting safety Montae Nicholson the focus of his coaches’ urgency this week after a rough start, and backup cornerback Darian Hicks looking to re-emerge as a starter after a bout with mononucleosis and an impressive second half against the Chippewas. The defense is the bigger question for the Spartans as they start league play. \n“I think we have ourself prepared for Big Ten play, I guess is the bottom line,” MSU co-defensive coordinator Mike Tressel said. “You know, if you look at statistics, you need to stay away from that. You need to look at wins and losses. You need to look at the areas we’ve done well and the areas we need to improve. Red zone is a big focus, we feel like we’ve done better in the red zone. Third down is always a big focus, we don’t feel like we’ve done as well there.” \nAnd Purdue has a talented-if-inexperienced quarterback in redshirt freshman David Blough. It has an upbeat third-year coach in Darrell Hazell who talked with confidence about this matchup and about the way his team has “inspired” him with its resilience. \nAnd it has a recent history of hanging right with MSU despite no indications that should be the case. \n“I don’t know, they just are,” MSU senior quarterback Connor Cook said when asked why these always seem to be competitive contests. “For whatever reason, it’s a tight game. We know they’re gonna be gunning for us.” Purdue writer: Final results deceiving for sloppy Boilers \nThe Spartans are gunning for much bigger things. They’ll play today in front of about 80 members of MSU’s 1965 national championship team, who will be honored on the field early in the game. That’s a reminder of the goal. \nBut then, so is MSU’s 1990 co-Big Ten championship team, which is in town for its 25th anniversary. The Big Ten race may involve 14 teams, two divisions and a title game now, but the traditionalists still love it. \n“It’s the start of something special every year when we get to the Big Ten Conference,” Dantonio reiterated, “and that’s the way it should be.” Read or Share this story: http://on.lsj.com/1L9FfdE TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T16:12:02.584+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
