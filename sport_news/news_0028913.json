(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel) KANSAS CITY, MO (FOOTBALLKC) - \nIf ever there were a must-win game this early in the NFL season, this is it for the 1-3 Kansas City Chiefs. \nThe Chiefs are coming off of three straight losses to three of the best teams in the NFL. Phrased like that it doesn’t seem so bad, but the fact that they looked over-matched for a good portion of the three games brings out the importance of week five. \nNow facing Chicago, Kansas City is a 10-point favorite and anything but over-matched on paper. \nEven without injuries the Chiefs would be the favorite, but the Bears have a staggering 13 players listed as questionable for the game. More than just backup players, Chicago lists key contributors like Jay Cutler, Alshon Jeffery, Eddie Royal, and multiple starting offensive linemen on the injury list. \nWith Kansas City remaining fairly healthy with exception to Phillip Gaines who’s out for the year, the Chiefs need to take advantages of the holes in the Chicago lineup. \nWhile it all starts with Andy Reid and Alex Smith on offense, the defense needs to have their best game of the season. Cutler is historically a turnover machine and without a strong line or receivers to throw to, Kansas City holds the major advantage. \nJustin Houston has been held in check of late, but this should be a game that he can handle and dominate like he did much of last year. Everyone on the front seven should face favorable match-ups opposite their 1-3 counterparts. \nThen in the secondary it will be a refreshing change not to face a top shelf quarterback, but that doesn’t mean they can sit back. Cutler gives you opportunities to take it away but also has the skill set to burn you if the defense is caught sleeping. \nThe thought to be vaunted Chiefs defense, has given up 30-plus points in three straight games for the first time since 1987. This is a big game to measure where this defense really is at. Regaining their swagger and turning in a strong overall performance will go a long way for the team’s confidence moving forward. \nThere are many players to watch for specifically on defense, as Derrick Johnson has looked slower at times, Tamba Hali very inconsistent, Dontari Poe non-existent, and the nickel corner rotation between Fleming, Parker, and Cooper have all been less than average. \nLack of speed and missed tackles has been the story for the defense of late, but the Bears don’t have many options that can expose such weaknesses. All the more important that the Chiefs capitalize on the Bears deficiencies and cover up their own. \nMarcus Peters was not physical enough in week four, and the Chiefs struggled stopping the Bengals on key third downs. To keep the team fresh it’s vital that when faced with third and long that Kansas City locks down and limits the damage. \nThe formula to topping the Chiefs defense is out there, as teams have began to rely on the quick throws, especially in the slot, to draw Kansas City corners in and limit the talented pass rush. Kansas City needs to press more and be physical when needed, to force the Bears be the better team. \nKansas City doesn’t need to be perfect to pull off a win, but they must show they have what it takes to beat a run down Bears team. With an easier schedule ahead, the Chiefs can put behind their struggles and view the Chicago game as a new beginning. \nIf Kansas City can apply pressure, sure up open tackles, and force a turnover from Cutler, they should have no problem bringing Arrowhead Stadium their first home victory of the season. \nKickoff at the Truman Sports Complex is set for noon on KCTV5 as the Chiefs look to snap their three game losing streak with a victory over the Bears. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
