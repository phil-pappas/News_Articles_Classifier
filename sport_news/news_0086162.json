It was this time just two seasons ago that Fenway was prepping for the World Series, the Red Sox having vanquished the Tigers to win the American League pennant on October 19 that season. But while the field may be empty, there's plenty going on in the offices along Yawkey Way. President of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski, having assembled his new front-office team, is at work trying to turn the Sox from a 78-84 outfit into one that will play deep into autumn. As the Red Sox sit on the sidelines, baseball's four semifinalists have certainly taken roundabout paths to get here. Over the next few days, we'll look at each team in the League Championship Series and see what Dombrowski and Boston can learn about team-building, and how it can be applied back home. We'll start in the American League, where the Blue Jays will look to bounce back from losses in the first two games when they host the Royals on Monday night at Rogers Centre. KANSAS CITY ROYALS 1. Patience, patience, patience. The Red Sox have learned the hard way that it's not easy to break a young player into the major leagues, especially in Boston. With the team planning on annual contention, there isn't much time for the kind of growing pains players such as Will Middlebrooks and Jackie Bradley, Jr. have endured the last few seasons. Even Xander Bogaerts was afforded the opportunity to work his problems out at the major-league level largely because Boston was out of it down the stretch in 2014. The Royals currently possess one of the best position player cores in all of baseball, with Eric Hosmer and Mike Moustakas on the corners, Alcides Escobar at short, Sal Perez behind the plate and Lorenzo Cain in center field. All five players are either still in arbitration or signed to team-friendly deals, Perez's being arguably the team-friendliest in the game. Looking at Kansas City's roster now, it looks like a great blueprint for success. It wasn’t that long ago, though, that this core looked potentially rotten. Of those five players, only Cain was an above-average offensive performer just last season. Hosmer hadn’t lived up to sky-high expectations, and before a postseason breakthrough, Moustakas looked like a bust. Over nearly 2,000 plate appearances before this season, Moustakas owned a .236 batting average with an on-base percentage below .300 and a slugging percentage below .400. Plus, he had gotten worse each season. This year, though, Moustakas carried over his October production over a full season, hitting .284 with a .348 on-base percentage and 22 home runs. Hosmer was even better at first base, Cain even better than that in center, emerging as a possible top-five finisher in MVP balloting. Years earlier, the same kind of patience had worked out with Alex Gordon and Zack Greinke. Page 2 of 5 - The Royals could afford to be patient with all of those players precisely because they couldn’t afford not to be. Kansas City wasn’t going to ditch Moustakas and sign Pablo Sandoval last winter, the way the Red Sox did with Middlebrooks. And that patience comes with a price. You’ve got to be willing to watch things not work out, and to run up against Einstein's definition of insanity in trying the same pieces and hoping they’ve improved. Boston won't be able to practice this kind of long-term patience, especially not after two last-place finishes. But the Sox should know that an unexpected step back for a talented prospect — and maybe even two or three — doesn’t necessarily mean the end. 2. No, you don’t NEED an ace. The day Kansas City acquired Johnny Cueto, it led the American League Central by 7.5 games, and its chances of making the playoffs stood at 97 percent. Cueto didn’t much help the Royals down the stretch of the regular season, pitching to an ERA just under 5.00 in 13 starts. This is to say that the Royals were going to make the playoffs even if they hadn’t acquired a purported ace in Cueto, and they in fact won the division going away and claimed home-field advantage throughout the postseason without receiving any semblance of ace-caliber performance from anyone in their starting rotation. They are this year's version of last year's Orioles, the team that won 95-plus games despite an underwhelming starting five. Now, this is the point where you bring up Cueto's Game Five ALDS start against Houston, and how in the one game the Royals needed him to be an ace, he answered the bell. This is true, and nobody is arguing that an ace isn't beneficial; there's a difference between wanting something and needing it. But Kansas City came within two runs of winning the World Series in 2014 without an ace, and they posted the best record in the American League this season without an ace. If the rest of the team is good enough, especially in the bullpen and with the gloves, you do not need an ace to win. Should the Red Sox fail in their efforts to land a frontline starter this winter in free agency or on the trade market, they better beef up their bullpen the way Kansas City did. 3. You can score runs in any number of ways. As offense dwindled in 2014, a common thread emerged in conversations about where baseball was going: Power is scarce, and you need it to win. Kansas City declares that conclusion piffle. The Royals hit 139 home runs this season — only the White Sox hit fewer in the American League. They finished sixth in the A.L. in runs, ahead of a Baltimore squad that clubbed 78 more home runs than Kansas City. Page 3 of 5 - They have justifiably earned a reputation for late-inning Lazarus acts in October that aren’t fueled by the long ball. Their four-run rally against Oakland in an elimination game last season, the four-run rally against Houston in an elimination game this season, their three-run rally against Toronto in Game Two on Saturday — all have been built off base hits and speed. It's supposed to be difficult to piece together two straight hits come October; the Royals have put four and five together for game- and series-changing rallies. That’s what makes Boston president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski's comparison last week so interesting. Asked about whether his offense did indeed have enough power to contend in 2016, Dombrowski talked about David Ortiz and Hanley Ramirez, then mentioned Kansas City. \"We don’t strike out in abundance. [It's] very similar to when we talk about how Kansas City's not a big power club,\" he said. \"I think [we're more] a Kansas City-type of club. The key is how many runs do you score, and I think that we can score enough runs with our club.\" Indeed, you don’t have to squint too hard to see a little of Cain in Mookie Betts, to see Xander Bogaerts developing power the way Hosmer and Moustakas did, to see Blake Swihart providing offensive value behind the plate much like Perez — even if all those guys don’t mature into 30-homer hitters. TORONTO BLUE JAYS 1. Winning in July means more than winning in November. In November of 2012, when the Yankees first entered a period of flux and the Red Sox were coming off a last-place finish, the Blue Jays went for it. They made a massive trade with the Marlins that saw them surrender several frontline prospects to bring Jose Reyes, Mark Buehrle, Josh Johnson and more to Toronto. Later that winter, they traded Noah Syndergaard and Travis d'Arnaud for the reigning Cy Young of the National League, R.A. Dickey. This was Toronto's moment. The Jays won only one more game than they had the year before, and they finished in last. The Red Sox won the World Series. For a year and a half after that, Toronto seemed gun-shy. Poised on the precipice of a breakthrough, the Jays never made that next step forward, perhaps out of fear of recreating 2013's disaster. After all, it wasn’t just that the major-leaguers they brought aboard had failed, but also that many of the minor-leaguers they had dealt away had started to flourish — Syndergaard and d'Arnaud for the Mets, Henderson Alvarez and Adeiny Hechavarria for the Marlins, even Jake Marisnick for the Astros. Plodding around .500 at the end of July, part of an uninspired division and wild-card race in the A.L. East, though, the Jays went for it again. They made one big splash to land Troy Tulowitzki from the Rockies followed by an even bigger one to nab David Price. As in 2012, the prospect cost could be significant. Daniel Norris and Matt Boyd were already members of the Tigers starting rotation late in the season, and Jeff Hoffman and Miguel Castro provide Colorado with some big, promising arms. Page 4 of 5 - But the acquisitions of Tulowitzki and Price were tailored to fit Toronto's needs in the here and now. Tulowitzki fortified the Jays' offensive strength and healed a defensive weakness at short; plus, he's under contract for years to come. Price gave the Jays what Dickey was supposed to: an ace at the top of the rotation. Price was at his best against the Yankees down the stretch, allowing Toronto to not only end a 22-year postseason drought, but to bypass the wild-card game by winning the division. Smaller moves, such as the inclusion of LaTroy Hawkins in the Tulowitzki deal and the pickup of Ben Revere, made the Jays' roster as well-rounded as any in baseball. They deserved to be the favorites entering October. What Toronto's midseason moves showed was that Ben Cherington's plan for the Red Sox this past year wasn’t so off-base. Cherington knew the A.L. East didn’t possess an intimidating frontrunner going into the season, so he figured that the Sox could afford to see what they had before forging ahead with improvements in July. After all, if Rick Porcello was as good as Cherington expected, a deal for Cole Hamels didn’t seem as necessary. Cherington was correct in his calculations about the rest of the division; his Red Sox, however, couldn’t even tread water into July, falling too far behind to make the kind of daring moves the Blue Jays made. The plan failed because Cherington misread his own roster, not the division. 2. You don’t ALWAYS have to play to your ballpark. During his time in Milwaukee, Marco Estrada had one main issue: The right-hander couldn’t keep the ball in the yard. After emerging as a productive starter for the Brewers in 2012 and 2013, Estrada lost his rotation spot last year because of a home-run rate that escalated at a frightening pace. He allowed 29 long balls in barely 150 innings, enough to lead the league. That’s what made Estrada a curious return for Toronto when they traded Adam Lind to Milwaukee. Estrada made sense as a buy-low reclamation project somewhere else — like San Diego or Kansas City, where the outfield is big and the ball doesn’t fly. But at Rogers Centre? Where it seems the longest home runs in the American League are hit year after year? What the Jays were hoping was that Estrada's astronomical home-run numbers in 2014 were a fluke — an aberration above and beyond what even someone prone to the home run should allow. They didn’t necessarily bank on him early in the season, starting him in the bullpen while Norris and Aaron Sanchez gave a go at the rotation. Estrada made his first start the first week of May, and he didn’t leave the rotation the rest of the way, pitching to a 3.13 ERA on the season. He gave up home runs — 24 of them, in fact — but at a rate more in line with his career norms than 2014's aberration. Estrada isn't as good as he's been this season, but he wasn’t as bad as he looked last season either. Page 5 of 5 - In attempting to discern good bounceback values on the open market, you don’t have to cater completely to your ballpark — even one as unique as Fenway Park. 3. The bullpen should be a meritocracy. Marcus Stroman's injury in spring training was a huge blow to Toronto's entire pitching staff, as it took away the guy who was supposed to front the Jays' rotation and forced them to make Sanchez — promising in a relief role as a rookie in 2014 — a starter again. That left Brett Cecil and a bunch of unknowns in the pen to start the season. For a while, the inadequacy of the bullpen threatened to undermine Toronto's season. But 20-year-old Roberto Osuna showed he was ready for the jump from High-A to the majors, and by the end of June the Jays trusted him enough to hand him the closer reins despite his relative inexperience. Osuna hasn’t looked back, compiling a dominant relief season for any age, let alone his own.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:22:29.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
