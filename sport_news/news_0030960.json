He threw a 17-yard scoring pass to Beckham late in the third quarter, prior to the receiver exiting the game with a hamstring injury, and the game-winner to Donnell, the tight end's second touchdown catch of the year.\nDonnell's game-winning catch was extra special for the Giants, who dedicated the win to tight end Daniel Fells, who is currently hospitalized due to a MRSA infection after being placed on season-ending injured reserve last week.\n\"Thank God we were able to give him the game ball,\" Coughlin said. \"To have a guy from his (tight end) room go up there and make that catch at the end of the game was just incredible.\"\nNew York (3-2) increased its grip on first place in the NFC East. The Giants will visit the Philadelphia Eagles a week from Monday with an eye toward avenging last year's embarrassing 27-0 loss, which also took place in front of a national television audience.\nThe 49ers (1-4) lost their fourth in a row. They head home to host the Baltimore Ravens next Sunday in desperate need of a win, and more determined than ever, according to their quarterback.\n\"To me, there's still 11 more games,\" Kaepernick said, \"We have an opportunity to go 12-4. We have to get on that path.\"\nThe Giants led 13-6 at halftime, with Beckham catching five passes for 89 yards. He finished with 121 yards on seven catches, the ninth time in his career that reached triple figures in receiving yards.\nBoldin made eight catches for 107 yards. Hyde gained 93 yards on 21 carries, and Kaepernick was 23-for-35 for 262 yards and two touchdowns with no interceptions.\nTwo of Beckham's longest receptions in the half were directly responsible for New York's first 10 points.\nHis first was a 49-yard grab that set up the first of kicker Josh Brown 's two field goals to knot the game at 3-3.\nBeckham made a 31-yard catch to set the stage for running back Shane Vereen's 2-yard touchdown reception, his first score as a Giant, to make it 10-3. Vereen wound up with eight catches for 86 yards and five carries for 24 yards.\nThe 49ers' only points of the half came on their opening and final drives of the half, both field goals by kicker Phil Dawson .\nOn the first drive, Kaepernick was 2-for-2 for 39 yards, including a 30-yard receiver screen to Bruce Ellington that pushed the ball deep into Giants territory.\nBrown added his second field goal of the half, a 41-yarder, to give the Giants a 13-3 lead with 4:02 left in the half. San Francisco responded with a 22-yard Dawson field goal.\nThe Giants came close to extending their lead in the final seconds of the half, but Manning tried to force a pass to Beckham in the corner of the end zone, and it was picked off by safety Antoine Bethea for a touchback.\nNOTES: Giants MLB Jon Beason was injured while tackling RB Carlos Hyde on the 49ers' opening possession. Beason was taken into the locker room, where he was diagnosed with a concussion. ... The 49ers had 115 passing yards in the first half, 66 of which came on three pass plays of 15 or more yards, including a 30-yard screen to WR Bruce Ellington, a 19-yard reception in the flat by FB Bruce Miller and a 17-yard catch by WR Torrey Smith. ... Giants TE Will Tye made his first NFL reception, a 12-yard gain that went for a first down late in the first quarter. ... With the win, his 167th in the regular season, Giants coach Tom Coughlin passed Hall of Famer Paul Brown for the 12th most regular-season victories in NFL history.\n  Donnell, Giants rout Redskins NFL Game Summary - NY Giants at Washington NFL: San Francisco 27, New York Giants 20 Giants try to play spoiler against rival Cowboys", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T05:39:03.740+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
