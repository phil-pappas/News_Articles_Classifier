We talked about that and we came out ready to play (in the second half).\" \nWithout a shot on goal in the opening forty, Township (7-1-1 Section One, 11-1-1 overall) wasted little time earning their one and only corner for the game, using the opportunity to setup their offense in the 43rd minute. \n\"I think we started transitioning a lot better in the second half so there were more people going up and being there, being able to finish, \" said Tubay, who subsequently headed home Alison Heckman's feed from the corner. Advertisement \nWith Conestoga Valley (7-2, 9-3) reeling, junior Aubrey Suydam corralled a loose ball near the front of the box and fired, the ball deflecting off a Buckskins' defender to a closing Bracero. \n\"I thought I was offsides, I was so paranoid,\" Bracero said. \"I was like be ready; if I'm offsides, at least I took the shot.\" \nConestoga Valley managed the only shot on goal in the first half as each team struggled to connect on sideline crosses. \nRepeating a Bucks' combination from early in the half, however, a give-and-go between CV's Emma Weirich and Gianna Yurchak in the 37th minute resulted in a cross to sophomore forward Emily Clapper on the right wing. \nClapper's shot went near-post, where it was gobbled-up by Township keeper Katy Hollinger (3 saves). \nWith eight minutes remaining, CV's fourth and final corner was serviced by Alana Dickson to Adalee Broadbent, her shot bouncing around between a Township defender and Buckskins' forward before it was cleared by defender Julia Mason. \nThe resulting shutout puts Township one points ahead of CV in the standings with three section games to play. Conestoga Valley hosts McCaskey Saturday morning while Township hosts an up-start Cedar Crest team fighting for third place in the section and coming off a 3-3 tie versus Section Two leader Etown. \n\"We were listening to some pump-up music in the locker room before this game,\" Tubay said, claiming it was music adults wouldn't like. \"So yea, it meant a lot to the team.\" \nMeaning, then, it was well worth the wait.
