The 10-4 Green Wave swept past Londonderry Wednesday, beating the Lancers, 25-16, 25-17, 25-14. Londonderry dropped to 8-7. After a 2-3 stretch in late September, capped with a disappointing 3-0 loss to rival Spaulding, Dover has come alive with four consecutive wins over teams with winning records — Londonderry, Bishop Guertin (10-3), Concord (11-2) and Exeter (7-6). \"The biggest thing is minimizing errors,\" said Dover coach Colleen Harte. \"We're finally managing to do that. They're realizing the success of your team when you don't make serving errors and hitting errors. They're focusing a bit more on keeping the ball in play.\" Against Londonderry, Dover was able to get its offense going early and keep the Lancers back on their heels. Senior middle Lisa Bean led the offense with 12 kills and six digs, while Anna Cartelli added six kills. Senior setter Mackenzie Geppert had 26 assists and seven digs. \"We're a good team and we're just starting to see what we can do,\" Bean said. \"We're becoming more confident in ourselves. We're more cohesive as a team.\" In each set, the Green Wave got going with a surge at roughly the midway point and forced Londonderry to play catch-up. In the opening set, Dover turned a 10-7 lead into a 22-12 advantage with a 12-5 run. Five kills from Bean sparked the surge. In the second set, the Green Wave were up 9-6, but Brynn Coleman served for eight straight points, three on aces, as Dover went up 17-6. Dover had a 10-6 lead in the third set, but again was able to surge to a comfortable lead. This time an 11-4 run widened the margin to 21-10, four points coming on Kate Murphy's serve. \"That is out game plan, to be aggressive,\" coach Harte said. \"Keep the pressure on them with the attacks.\" In all three sets, Dover remained in control once they built their leads and the Lancers were unable to mount a serious rally to challenge. \"They were just more aggressive from start to finish,\" said Londonderry coach David Starin. \"They had hitters that were able to terminate balls. They were consistently able to on our serve side us out immediately. We had no service runs. They were definitely aggressive. And not only that, having momentum they were able to swing harder and harder without any repercussion whatsoever.\" Dover plays at Nashua North Friday. Its final four matches are all against teams with records under .500. If they run the table, the Green Wave stand a good chance of moving into the top four, which means home matches in the first two rounds of the D-I tournament. \"We're playing more as a team, versus individual play,\" Geppert said. \"We just need to keep on improving. We don't want to peak. We just want to keep getting better and better.\" By Mike Whaley", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:19:55.391+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
