What does it mean? Not much, according to James himself.\n\"It's just a number of mine,\" James said, following the scrimmage. He scored six points on 2-of-7 shooting in 12 minutes.\n\"One of my two numbers â€“ 6, 23,\" James continued. \"There's nothing to it. It's my practice jersey. It's like Deion (Sanders) when he was at Florida State he wore like 2 in practice and when he went to the pros he wore 2 in practice but wore 21 on the playing field. It's like that.\"\nLeBron wore No. 6 in both the 2008 and 2012 Olympics, so both before and after his departure from the Cavaliers. We'll take him at his word that the change doesn't carry any additional significance.\n[ via Cleveland.com ]", "external_links": ["http://www.cleveland.com/cavs/index.ssf/2015/10/lebron_james_deion_sanders_cav.html"], "published": "2015-10-06T22:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T23:34:47.019+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
