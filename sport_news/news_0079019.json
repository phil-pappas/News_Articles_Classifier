By 1947, it was producing its own cars.\nSince then, the cars, both racing and road, that have emerged from the Maranello factory in northern Italy have gleamed and excited.\nThe Associated Press has followed Ferrari for decades. Here are some of the most memorable vehicles as captured by photographers from The AP.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
