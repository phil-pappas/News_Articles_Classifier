He added 32 yards on the ground to account for 452 of the Tigers staggering 532 yards of total offense on 72 plays with 24 first downs.\nThe Eagles defense, which had allowed 140.3 yards per game coming into the night, salvaged a measure of dignity by recording two interceptions that led to points. Clemson improved to 6-0 and 3-0 in the ACC, while BC fell to 3-4, 0-4. The Eagles will play at Louisville on Saturday.\n“The ball got over our head a little bit and down the field,” said BC coach Steve Addazio. “I thought Watson threw some pretty nice balls and he firmly had control of that game.\n“I thought he played like a big-time player and guys like that make plays. He was making plays with his feet and he threw some nice balls. He got behind us in the back end.”\nThe Tigers got some help by three devastating penalties committed by the Eagles. Two were on third-and-long, one on fourth down and all on the Clemson side of the field.\nBC was flagged for roughing the punter, roughing the passer and pass interference that extended Clemson drives and led to points. Watson proved too opportunistic a player to be granted three second chances.\n“We had two or three pass interference calls and we were playing real tight coverages,” Addazio said. “Those are huge plays when they happen and they are extending drives and give Watson credit.\n“You take away a few of those third-down penalties and I think we are right there at the end. There were three of them when we were off the field that led to three scores and I’m not trying to make lemonade out of it.”\nBC freshman quarterback Jeff Smith played well in spurts in his first career start and the offense appears to be in his hands for the rest of the run. Smith completed 7-of-22 passes for 87 yards and a touchdown. Smith also rushed for a touchdown at the end of the game.\nJunior tailback Myles Willis, who missed the last two games with a shoulder injury, led the Eagles with 88 yards on 15 carries with a long run of 45.\n“I felt Jeff Smith took a step forward tonight,” Addazio said. “He played fast and competitively and we hit some runs in that game which is tough to do against that defense.”\nBC scored first on a short field delivered by the defense. Free safety Justin Simmons picked off Watson at midfield and returned it to the Clemson 20. Smith made it 7-0 on a 4-yard pass to fullback Bobby Wolford with 8:13 to play.\nClemson scored the next 17 points on three sustained drives. Watson connected on a 40-yard pass to Artavis Scott to the BC 10. On third-and-goal from the 4 yard line, Watson scored on a keeper. Scott finished with 10 catches for 162 yards. The Tigers got a 42-yard field goal from Greg Huegel and a 21-yard touchdown catch by Zac Brooks to take a 17-10 lead at the half.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:12:17.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
