I am not stupid, I won’t change too much on Wednesday,” said Van Gaal, who left out fellow Dutchmen Danny Blind and Memphis Depay at the weekend following the Netherlands’ failure to qualify for Euro 2016. \nWhile United may have one eye on next Sunday’s local derby against Manchester City, they would do well not to underestimate a CSKA side who have been in excellent form domestically as well. \nCSKA are unbeaten in their last 19 matches in the Russian Premier League, equalling a club record set in 2001, and beat Ural 3-2 on Saturday to stay five points clear of second placed Lokomotiv Moscow. \nHowever, head coach Leonid Slutskiy has been critical of his team’s performance. \n“Unfortunately we are unable to fully control the whole match,” said the 44-year-old, who in August also started to coach the Russian national team. \nCSKA will be without Bibras Natcho who is suffering from a head injury, but fellow midfielder Roman Eremenko is expected to be fit following a groin strain. Experienced central defender Vasili Berezutski is also expected to return. \nRussian international goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev will be hoping for an upturn in fortunes. CSKA’s captain is looking to end an unwanted record, having failed to keep a clean sheet in 33 consecutive appearances in the Champions League.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T08:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:40:19.267+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
