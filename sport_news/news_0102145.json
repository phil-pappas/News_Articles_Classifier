Walker threw a late 23-yard touchdown pass to Robby Anderson, and Temple rallied to beat East Carolina. Walker finished 19-of-35 for 250 yards for the Owls (7-0, 4-0 American Athletic Conference). They ensured their first appearance in the Top 25 since 1979 — and the best start in school history — will last a little longer. East Carolina’s Blake Kemp was 31-of-48 for 272 yards with a 7-yard touchdown pass to Quay Johnson. Chris Hairston added a 1-yard scoring run for the Pirates (4-4, 2-2). Temple’s Jahad Thomas rushed for two touchdowns, of 2 and 14 yards, the last sealing it with 2:18 to play. The American’s leading rusher finished with just 66 yards — 60 fewer than his average. A Temple team that cracked the national rankings for the first time in 34 years on the strength of its defense and ground game needed Walker’s arm to win this one. The Owls gained 82 total yards while going scoreless on their first five possessions of the second half, before the passing game got hot just in time. Walker hit Anderson over the middle for 51 yards to the East Carolina 34 with about 5 1/2 minutes to go. Five plays later, they hooked up again, with Anderson slipping past a defender between the hash marks on his way across the goal line with 3:31 remaining. After Temple forced a three-and-out, Sharif Finch blocked Worth Gregory’s punt at the East Carolina 15. Two plays later, Thomas iced it with the longer of his two scoring runs.
