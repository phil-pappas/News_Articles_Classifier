Juliet Spies-Gans Editorial Fellow, HuffPost Sports Posted: 10/26/2015 01:55 PM EDT Andrew D. Bernstein via Getty Images \nOn Sunday, Kobe Bryant took it upon himself to usher his teammates into the new NBA season through his own unique initiation rite: Crushing the youngbloods who dare challenge him on the hardwood. \nDuring an intersquad preseason scrimmage -- where stakes are low, actually, where stakes could not be lower -- the Los Angeles Lakers’ never-reticent Nick Young and Lou Williams reportedly began to chirp at the really ( really ) competitive Bryant, with their \"w hite team\" in the lead over his \"purple team.\" \nYoung, who’s been with the Lakers for a couple years now, should’ve known better . For Williams, let’s just call it a learning experience. \nIt may’ve been during practice, it may’ve been during the preseason, but Bryant responded to the trash talk by going full on No. 8-Kobe on the opposing team. Per Lakers.com, Bryant proceeded to toss up his trademark turnaround jumper from his right shoulder -- swish -- and his left shoulder -- splash -- before converting on a four-point play -- game . \n“[S]omebody said something to Kobe … [and four threes] later, you can see the score now, ” rookie Larry Nance Jr. said after practice. “I think we’ve learned from that mistake: Don’t poke the bear .” \nThat “bear” is a 37-year-old, 17-time All-Star, who’s just days away from his 20th season in the league. He went on his historic 2006 offensive tear -- most notably tallying 81 points in a single game -- when most of his current teammates were in their adolescence: Nick Young was sitting at 20 years old, Lou Williams was a teenager and Larry Nance Jr. had just become a teenager, turning 13 a few weeks earlier. \nLakers veteran Metta World Peace -- who played with Bryant for four years during his first stint in Los Angeles -- confirmed the white team’s mistake. \n“[Provoking him] was the wrong thing to do, \" he told the media. Metta on Kobe's practice: \"He was scoring in people's faces, talking trash.\" Someone apparently talked trash to Kobe and it fired him up. — Mike Bresnahan (@Mike_Bresnahan) October 25, 2015 Turns out there were *two* players who fired up Kobe by talking trash to him at practice today: Lou Williams and, no surprise, Nick Young. — Mike Bresnahan (@Mike_Bresnahan) October 25, 2015 \nThis practice story is vintage Bryant -- and it’s exactly what Lakers fans want to see from their superstar on the brink of the new year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:55:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:31:59.749+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
