The Mets were leading 2-1 when the Dodgers put runners at the corners with one out against Noah Syndergaard. Second baseman Daniel Murphy flipped to Tejada, who took the throw awkwardly for an apparent force as Utley slid past the bag and slammed into him with Tejada's back turned to the play, causing him to flip over as the tying run scored from third.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T17:48:23.608+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
