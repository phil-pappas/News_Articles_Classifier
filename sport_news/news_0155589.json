You knew they were coming, but the fact of the matter is, could you stop it? Because they could execute them so well. And I think that there's something to be said about that as well.\"\nThe Lions (0-3) rank 27th in the NFL in offense and are averaging 14 points per game over the past two weeks entering Monday night's showdown with the Seahawks (1-2).\nThey've struggled to run the ball, they haven't been able to pass protect, and they're tied for second in the league with eight turnovers.\n\"You study tendencies, you get a sense of tendencies,\" Caldwell said. \"There's also audio nowadays where they're mic'ing your guards and centers and everybody hears your audibles. They hear different calls, they're going to pick up on something once in a while here and there. That kind of happens.\"\nStafford said his two interceptions last week came on plays the Lions had not run at any point this year.\nBruton told reporters in Denver on Monday that the Lions have a \"high tendency of showing a particular play\" and that he read Stafford's eyes after running back Ameer Abdullah chip-blocked a blitzer to make his game-clinching interception on a pass intended for Calvin Johnson in the fourth quarter.\n\"Legitimately, have not run that play, ever,\" Stafford said. \"It was a specialty third-down play put in for their defense. Guy made a heck of a play. I give him a lot of credit. Physical play. It was a great one. Made a great tip. And heard that. Heard that he was reading my eyes, too. I was looking right and he was running left, he just got to his spot and made a good play. So it happens.\n\"Guys, when you win a football game, you can say what you want and I understand that.\"\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nLions' Caldwell: We're close, even if you can't see it\nLions safety Glover Quin said he might know what play an opposing offense is trying to run \"about three or four times a game\" thanks to good film study. Typically, he said players know another team's tendencies and can whittle down what they're trying to accomplish on a given play to a few general concepts.\n\"Nine times out of 10, why do backs chip?\" Quin said. \"Backs don't chip to run a quick slant, 'cause you don't even have to have an offensive line there to run a quick slant because the quarterback throws the ball so fast. Nine times out of 10, if a back chips, it's probably a deeper route because they're trying to buy time for protection. So if he chips, you automatically know, 'OK, it's a deeper route.' It's not like it's rocket science.\"\nSeahawks coach Pete Carroll said in a teleconference with Detroit reporters that he hasn't seen any signs of the Lions giving away plays.\n\"I wish we could find the same things that they were talking about,\" Carroll said. \"This is a tough team now, and they've got a lot of stuff they do. I don't see what they're talking about. It looks very difficult and challenging, definitely, in all phases.\"\nStafford said poor execution has been the biggest problem with the offense through three weeks, and he said everyone shares in the blame.\n\"We have way more options, I feel like, at our disposal on offense out of a certain formation than defenses do just from being sound-wise,\" Stafford said. \"This is Football 202, and we're getting into some thought process stuff. But, yeah, for sure. It comes down to execution. It's been football for a long time and people run a lot of the same plays that they've always run, and it's just how you make them work.\"\nBeat writer Dave Birkett will answer your Lions questions in a live chat at 10 a.m. Friday at freep.com/sports.
