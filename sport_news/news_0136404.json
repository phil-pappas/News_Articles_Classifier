A team source said at this point, it’s all about conditioning for the 30-year-old Slovakian, now in his second season as the Isles’ No. 1 netminder.\n“You need to get some good practice in, full practices with the team,” Halak said. “I guess you need to do everything you can — on the ice, off the ice — to make yourself ready. Injuries happen, you just need to go through that and get healthy again.\n“Hopefully, I’ll be ready soon.”\nThat means it will likely be newly signed backup Thomas Greiss getting the go, while Jean-Francois Berube, just picked up off waivers from the Kings, will back up.\nThe team was publicly cautious about Halak’s status, with coach Jack Capuano saying he “didn’t know” if Halak would be available. But two periods of one preseason game Sept. 21 is not enough for him to be game-ready, at least not right now.\n“I feel better, better than what it was,” Halak said. “Getting there, that’s the main thing. It’s getting better every day. It’s just trying to work hard in practices and in the gym and doing everything I can.”\nSo this might slightly dampen the excitement for the first real game in the new building, as Greiss’ .913 save percentage — with a .908 last year with the Penguins — doesn’t exactly inspire confidence. Berube has had an excellent AHL career, with a 2.18 goals-against average last season with the Kings’ affiliate in Manchester. But the 24-year-old has never played a NHL game, and it sure would be throwing him to the fire if the first game was the second leg of this back-to-back, home-and-home, Saturday night in Chicago’s United Center — aka, the Madhouse on Madison.\n“Obviously going to be a great test for us, playing the defending champion,” Isles captain John Tavares said. “They’re the Stanley Cup champs for a reason.”\nReally, the focus of Tavares and his teammates can’t be on missing Halak, and it can’t be on the fanfare that will precede this inaugural game. This might be the beginning of a new era in Islanders’ hockey, but the game remains the same.\nWhich explains why Tavares made a testimonial to his teammates, making it clear that success in the building — not just this year, but in the years to come — is something that is reliant on no one but themselves.\n“I think the most important thing is to win, and make it a hard place to play — which is on us as a team,” Tavares said. “There’s no doubt our fans will be into it like they were at the Coliseum. The tradition they’re going to bring over and the passion they have for us.”\nOf course there are big differences between the Coliseum and Barclays Center, most notably the proximity to most of the Islanders’ fan base — as well as the proximity to where all of the players and coaches live out on Long Island. The three preseason games gave a glimpse at the daily routine, but the effect it has on the games that matter will be a curious study.\n“I think we want to bring the way we play over,” Tavares said. “We want to get our fans behind us again, that energy, that passion, that tough environment they make it to play in for another team and give us a lot of momentum, a lot of energy, and we want to feed off that.”\nAt least that’s the hope, and it comes with or without Halak in nets.\n  jaroslav halak ,  new york islanders", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T06:21:20.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
