So, let's go to work and see what we can do,\" said Kerry.\nThe two politicians, who have known each other for years, last held talks at the end of September in New York.\nThe current wave of protests and repression started in late July when 18-month old toddler Ali Dawabsha was burned to death and three other Palestinians severely injured after their house in the occupied West Bank was set on fire by Israeli settlers.\nThe parents of the toddler, Riham and Saad, and their other son Ahmad, later lost their lives after suffering serious injuries in the arson.\nPalestinians have also been protesting repeated illegal Israeli and Jewish settler attacks on Al-Aqsa Mosque and the closing of the Muslim holy site to worshippers on numerous occasions. Protests have taken place in occupied East Jerusalem, the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip.\nNetanyahu once again repeated his assertion that Abbas was to blame for fanning the violence.\n\"There is no question that this wave of attacks was driven directly by the incitement, the incitement of Hamas, the incitement of the Islamist movement in Israel and the incitement, I am sorry to say, from president Abbas and the Palestinian Authority,\" said Netanyahu.\n\"I think it is time for the international community to say clearly to president Abbas: stop spreading lies about the state of Israel,\" he added.\n*This story was edited by Ahram Online.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T13:32:11.241+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
