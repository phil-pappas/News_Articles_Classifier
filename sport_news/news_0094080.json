There were reports of widespread use of sexual violence, including more than 50 rape cases, said the Protection Cluster, representing 60 local and international organizations.\nKuong Kuony, the rebel's commissioner for Leer County, accused government troops of launching attacks on rebel positions, burning civilian houses, and looting livestock.\nSouth Sudan's military spokesman, Col. Philip Aguer, said Saturday that he had no reports of fighting in Leer County.\nThe U.N. and human rights groups have documented widespread abuses against civilians, including rapes and killings by government soldiers and their militia, in Unity state this year.\nFighting persists despite a peace deal signed in August.\nThe latest incidents took place following a brief takeover of Leer town by rebel forces on October 2. Government forces pushed the rebels out later that day, the Protection Cluster said. Government forces then attacked numerous locations across the county, chasing civilians into swamps, according to many survivors who spoke to AP in Unity state during and after the attacks.\n\"As a result of this new wave of violence, it is estimated that nearly 1,200 children are unaccompanied and separated in southern and central Unity State,\" the Protection Cluster said.\nSouth Sudan has been at war since December 2013 as government forces loyal to President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, battle rebels led by his former deputy, Riek Machar, a Nuer. The fighting has often been along ethnic lines.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T14:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T19:19:34.492+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
