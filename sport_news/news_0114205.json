(Dan Honda/Bay Area News Group) ( Dan Honda ) OAKLAND -- Stephen Curry, at the basketball complex Jamtown near Jack London Square, launched the newest version of his second signature shoe, The Dubnation Curry Two. Over 400 people showed up Saturday, excited for a basketball shoe from Under Armour, a sports apparel giant known for football. \nIt just goes to show we can't even fathom what's coming next from Curry, the Warriors' All-Star point guard. Will he lead the league in assists? Make 300 3-pointers? Win the scoring title? Capture a second MVP award? Make the NBA's All-Defensive team? \nIt's impossible to put a ceiling on him. It's hard to gauge how good he can be because he was never supposed to be this good. \nBut based on what has already happened, something even more spectacular is coming. Typical understanding keeps trying to limit him, and he keeps crossing over expectations, drilling 3-pointers over outstretched skepticism. \nCurry didn't need to be with a powerhouse such as Nike to sell shoes. \nAccording to Fortune.com , the Curry One's release in February boosted Under Armour shoe sales 40 percent that quarter. This after Nike lowballed Curry because it didn't think his signature shoe would sell. \nCurry didn't need to be on a legacy franchise to become a global icon. He has turned a doormat franchise into a trendy allegiance. There were 10,000 fans packed in Manila, Philippines, most of them wearing Golden State Warriors gear, for his promotional tour last month. Remember the days when you came across an East Coast sports fan who thought the Warriors played in Los Angeles? Advertisement \nCurry didn't need to be a physical specimen to revolutionize the game. \nLeBron James is a phenom because he has a shooting guard's athleticism with the mind of a point guard in a linebacker's body. \nAnthony Davis, who is already in the conversation for the league's best player, is a freak because he has guard skills and unusual defensive instincts with the kind of height and length that makes executives salivate. \nKevin Durant is a natural scorer who can shoot from distance. He also happens to be 6-foot-9, making him almost impossible to guard. \nCurry is 6-3, 180 pounds, and if he dunks, it's because no one is around him. Yet his impact is in the realm of the aforementioned once-in-a-generation players. He didn't win the genetic lottery, but there isn't a scarier player to face in the NBA. \nHe has changed the way coaches think. He has changed the way scouts evaluate. He has changed what fans value. \nTry this hat on: Curry is the best player in the NBA. \nA year ago, that statement would be a sign of clear Warriors bias. \nTwo years ago, it would have drawn a laugh. \nThree years ago, no one outside the Curry and Davidson College families would even think to possess such a thought. \nNow? The case is pretty strong. \nSince he has improved defensively, Curry has become one of the league's most complete players. He is the most dangerous offensive player in the NBA. Because his game is based on the 3-pointer, he does more damage with less. \nIn the NBA Finals, James was historic with his offensive output. And he still wasn't nearly as efficient as Curry, who struggled early in the series. \nThere just simply isn't a better offensive player in the NBA. There are higher scorers and better floor generals than Curry, but no one can put up points more efficiently and beat defenses in as many ways as he can. \nOh yeah, at 27, Curry is entering his prime. He has improved his game every season he has been healthy, and now he's entering the stage of his career where his physical attributes and mental acumen are at their highest levels. \nRemember when the debate was between Curry and Ty Lawson? Curry went out and destroyed Lawson and the Denver Nuggets in the playoffs, and now Lawson is talking trash about Curry while coming off the Houston Rockets bench. \nThat's how much Curry has changed the game. \nSomehow, this guy, in a sense, still is under the radar. The NBA general managers survey revealed Curry is still lagging behind the traditionally elite. The executives still hold a special place for height, athleticism and strength. \nThe NBA Players voted Houston's James Harden as their Real MVP, a sign Curry's peers still haven't fully grasped his dominance. \nThis is all good news for the Warriors. Because the same chip that drove Curry to take on the NBA and win is still there as this season begins. He has been driven by doubt his whole career, and he's still being doubted. \nIt's clear he will have to do something even more ridiculous to get the universal regard he deserves. And precedent suggests he just might.
