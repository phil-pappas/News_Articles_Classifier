Carter Stadium. TCU and SMU have been playing each other in football almost yearly for a century, first meeting on Oct. 18, 1915. The Horned Frogs have the series edge with a 47-40-7 record against the Mustangs and have been working to extend it with three straight wins. Coming off the biggest win in rivalry history, it would be a major disappointment for TCU to fall to SMU at home, about as disappointing as it was when they did just that in 2011.\nWhen TCU has the ball\nThe Horned Frogs opened things up offensively against a much weaker opponent in Stephen F. Austin, shaking off any remaining cobwebs coming out of the offseason. This should be another chance to flex for Trevone Boykin and company before starting conference play. Against a similar offense with comparable talent in Baylor, SMU struggled to get settled early and allowed four touchdowns in the first quarter. The Ponies held the Bears off in the second, but allowed four more scores after halftime. The Horned Frogs have scored a touchdown in the first quarter in each of their last 15 games. Another fast start will mean for the opponent will be tough for SMU to overcome, and the Frogs will go off yet again.\nWhen SMU has the ball\nChad Morris's offense has been a mixed bag thus far, but it's been a stark improvement over what the Ponies were doing last season. SMU couldn't buy a touchdown when these teams met last year, but it was able to largely make a game of it against Baylor. Matt Davis brings a dual-threat ability that this mismatched Frogs defense has yet to see this season, and a few big plays from the SMU quarterback could make things uneasy for Frogs fans.\nPrediction\nRivalries get weird, especially ones that have been around for this long. Last year's game didn't exactly have that rivalry feeling with a sparse crowd at Ford Stadium and two teams heading in different directions. This season's matchup will feel a bit more like it should, but the play on the field won't be all that close. A few long plays for Trevone Boykin both in the rushing and passing game will put the Mustangs away by half, keeping the Iron Skillet in Fort Worth and finishing an undefeated nonconference slate for the Horned Frogs.\nScore: TCU 53, SMU 10.\nOn Twitter:\n @RyanGerbosi", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/RyanGerbosi"], "published": "2015-09-17T21:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:01:30.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
