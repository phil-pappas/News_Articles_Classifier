To cite some, it is played in an oval shaped pitch,between two teams of eleven players each. One team bats while attempting to score runs and the other delivers and fields the ball, besides making an effort to limit the scoring and terminate the batsmen one by one.The game-play also requires both teams to be uniformly dressed in whites,consisting of flannel trousers, a polo shirt, a pullover, spiked shoes and a jockstrap with a box guard.In the past, cricket clothing was generally made up of flannel and linen like fabrics, whereas the modern uniforms have trousers made with an extra elastic and Lycra content to increase the comfort level while playing.

It consists of a cap like shell, but harder along with a grill and visor.
