I think he's got more to prove. Ancelotti is a great manager of course but he's gone to clubs where you would expect to win trophies. \n\"It's a difficult job now at Liverpool getting them back into the top four. Forget talking about the title. And I think it needs someone with that energy and drive to get Liverpool back to where it wants to be and I think Jurgen Klopp's that man.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T10:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:50:03.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
