While they were never in jeopardy of losing, it was the way they won that had them disappointed. \nIn fact, after a first half that saw the Bears leading by two touchdowns over Teaneck, Bergenfield coach Rob Violante was almost apologetic with regard to his team’s performance. \n\"That was tough to watch,\" he said after turnovers and penalties overshadowed the two-touchdown lead. \nThe second half was a bit of an improvement, but the Bears as a whole know that despite a 40-6 win over the Highwaymen, a similar performance going forward is likely to produce a much different result. \n\"It’s all up to us now,\" Violante said. \"If we can beat a very good Clifton team next week, we’re in [the North 1 Group 3 playoffs] no matter what, but it going to require a much better performance than we had today.\" \nBergenfield (4-3) entered this game seventh in the power point rankings and will probably remain there heading into next week. After stalling at the Teaneck 7-yard line on its first possession, the Bears came back with touchdowns on the next two. \nThe first was a 1-yard run by Carlos Macon that was set up by a 37-yard completion from Jorge Montoya to Jovani Haskins, the first reception of the season for Haskins. The second was a 42-yard run by Haskins out of the quarterback spot with 56 seconds left in the first quarter. \nThe second quarter went scoreless as \"we kind of relaxed,\" Violante said. \"Again, we can’t expect to be able to do that. We talked about that at halftime and I think we came out much better in the second half.\" \nThe Bears scored the first three times they had the ball, with Macon doing the honors from 7 and 78 yards. The junior finished with 24 carries for 226 yards as the Bears established the right side. \n\"That’s the play we’ve had the most success with,\" Violante said. \"We knew we could execute it. You want to go out and throw the ball and do all kinds of things, but we felt we had to go back to what is our foundation.\" \nJamal Williams scored on a 5-yard run to make it 34-0 a minute into the fourth quarter and the Bears began pulling the starters. Teaneck (0-6) did manage to break the shutout, converting two third downs and a fourth down before quarterback Jordan Gamble hit Corey Gordon for a 25-yard touchdown. Anthony Torres then ran the ensuing kickoff back 82 yards to close out the scoring. \nBergenfield registered five sacks of Gamble and Alejandro Alvarado topped the Bears with 8 tackles. Robert Torres added seven stops for the Bears. \nDavid Olamiju topped the Highwaymen with 11 tackles and Maximilian Rumble added 8 while Christian Ozorio had 6 tackles, a strip and fumble recovery and a team-high 77 rushing yards on 16 carries. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T07:20:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:19:49.702+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
