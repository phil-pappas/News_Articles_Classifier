(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky) \nIf you’ve been keeping up with the recent news surrounding daily fantasy sports , you’ll know the sharks are swimming. And while that may dull the interest for some casual users, it only reinforces the fact that information is the key to winning. \nHowever, those of us without access to player ownership rates and salaries prior to the contests need to be smart in constructing our lineups by using the best available data to us. \nThe advice you’ll find here is generated using point spreads and over/under lines to maximize the number of points scored by the recommended lineup each week. \nHere is a lineup for Week 6 that I believe will help give you an edge. \nQuarterback: Andy Dalton, Cincinnati Bengals \nAndy Dalton ranks second in ESPN’s Total Quarterback Rating and is second in yards gained on passes targeted 20 or more yards downfield . \nRunning back: Adrian Peterson, Minnesota Vikings \nPeterson has topped 15 FanDuel points in three of four weeks and should be able to play with a lead against a Kansas City Chiefs squad that lost Jamaal Charles. \nRunning back: Danny Woodhead, San Diego Chargers \nMelvin Gordon is getting more carries, but Woodhead is the goal-line option. \nWide receiver: Julian Edelman, New England Patriots \nEdelman has seen 10 or more targets in three of his four weeks, and Tom Brady has a 121.6 passer rating on throws to him. \nWide receiver: T.Y. Hilton, Indianapolis Colts \nHilton had seven catches on 13 targets for 67 yards on Sunday and faces the Patriots, who are in the top 10 for FanDuel points allowed to the position (30.6). \nWide receiver: Jordan Matthews, Philadelphia Eagles \nOnly Larry Fitzgerald (3.09) and Doug Baldwin (2.01) have averaged more yards per route run from the slot than Matthews (1.94). \nTight end: Martellus Bennett, Chicago Bears \nThe Lions’ defense has allowed the sixth-most points to tight ends (11.7 per game). \nDefense: New York Jets \nCornerback Darelle Revis has allowed a 23.8 passer rating against and has two interceptions. His opposing quarterback this week, the Redskins’ Kirk Cousins, has six interceptions in five games. \nKicker: Travis Coons, Cleveland Browns \nThe Browns have the second lowest red-zone touchdown scoring percentage, which means a lot of work for Coons on Sunday.
