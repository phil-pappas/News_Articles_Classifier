(AP Photo/Mary Schwalm) Comments \nEvan Turner could return to the Boston Celtics lineup Thursday when the team continues its preseason in Spain, according to the Boston Globe's Adam Himmelsbach. Evan Turner (knee) is listed as probable on a Celtics injury report for tomorrow's game against Real Madrid. â€” Adam Himmelsbach (@AdamHimmelsbach) October 7, 2015 \nTurner missed the preseason opener, a 124-91 win against Olimpia Milano, after straining his right knee during a recent practice. Jae Crowder started for his injured teammate, but it's not clear whether that change (or any other lineup development, really) will continue when Turner returns. Head coach Brad Stevens could go in plenty of directions with his rotation and has said he will experiment with lineups through the preseason. \nRookie R.J. Hunter may have benefited the most from Turner's absence with playing time in both halves. The first-round pick looked solid in his debut, but so did just about everyone on the Celtics.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T22:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:08:11.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
