And statistics from area school districts indicate that remains a problem in the Fox Valley and Naperville.\nIn Elgin School District U46, blacks make up only 6.8 percent of the student population but accounted for 26.5 percent of the out-of-school suspensions last school year and 17.5 percent of the in-school suspensions. But District U46 discipline chief Randal Ellison said the district is making progress in evening out those ratios. He said the percentage of the suspended students who are black dropped from 29.9 to 22.2 over the past two years. The percentage of suspended students who are Hispanic dropped from 58.2 to 51.9.\nA huge racial imbalance in suspensions has especially become a topic of controversy in Indian Prairie School District 204 though the number of out-of-school suspensions in District 204 decreased at the high school level across all racial/ethnic subgroups with the largest drop in the proportion of black students.\nIn 2013, 448 black high school students received out-of-school suspensions, which represent 44 percent of the black student population. By 2015, 170 black students were suspended, or 18 percent of the 971 black students enrolled in high school.\nSeveral District 204 School Board members this summer raised concerns over data in the report.\nBoard member Maria Curry said one in five black students given suspensions still is too high and called on the district to do something about that.\nLouis Lee, assistant superintendent of high schools, said schools will continue to combat discipline disparities. Not only will administrators at the high schools, as well as lower levels, continue to track discipline data, he said, but the deans this fall will look at policy infractions to determine if there needs to be a culture and climate change.\nAlso in 2013, nearly a quarter of high school students of two or more races were disciplined with out-of-school suspensions. Suspensions dropped to 6 percent for that racial group. The proportions for Hispanic/Latino high school students suspended fell from 18 percent in 2013 to 8 percent in 2015.\nThe proportion of white and Asian students disciplined were the lowest among the racial groups.\nIn 2013, 4 percent of Asian students and 8 percent of white students received out-of-school suspensions. That number fell to 1 percent and 3 present respectively in 2015.\ndgathman@tribpub.com\nsubaker@tribpub.com\nCopyright Â© 2015, Elgin Courier-News High Schools Arne Duncan", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-56194358/turbine/ct-ecn-school-discipline-sidebar-st-1011-2-20151010"], "published": "2015-10-10T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T21:14:01.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
