Aaron Rodgers turned the ball over an unthinkable three times, and the ball-carrying tandem of Eddie Lacy and James Starks was stopped cold.\nBut every coordinator has to change it up a few times, right?\nThe problem for the Rams was, when Williams did, the result was two long touchdown passes in the Green Bay Packers' 24-10 victory.\n\"Besides those two explosive plays I thought we played a good game on defense,\" said cornerback Trumaine Johnson. \"If we eliminate those two plays, that's 14 points.\"\nOn the Packers' first series, Williams ordered a six-man pressure on third and 6. Linebacker James Laurinaitis knocked Rodgers down but not before he released the pass to a wide-open Ty Montgomery, who turned the 10-yard throw into a 31-yard gimme touchdown.\n\"Aaron's difficult to play against because he can beat you in so many ways,\" said Rams offensive assistant Jeff Garcia, the former Pro Bowl quarterback whose 12-year playing career ended in 2011. \"He's one of the best in the league right now, if not one of the best all-time.\n\"The guy just has an unbelievable knowledge of the game … unbelievable presence on the field. He's so strong and tough, and he's got great physical tools.\"\nJohnson took the rap for letting Montgomery escape inside from a stack set with tight end Richard Rodgers.\n\"Guy (Montgomery) beat leverage – touchdown,\" said Lamarcus Joyner, the Rams' nickel back. \"It's the Green Bay Packers. That's one of the (best) offenses in the NFL right now. Guys are going to make plays.\"\nJoyner estimated that Williams sent all-out blitzes (six or more) just twice all day.\n\"That stuff doesn't fluster guys like that,\" said Joyner. \"He makes checks. He zips it. He's going to take what you give him. He's dinkin', he's dunkin'. You can't blitz guys like that.\"\nWhen Williams last coached in Lambeau Field, he was coordinating for the New Orleans Saints on opening night 2011. On that occasion, he kept bringing the house (55% blitz rate, including an unheard-of 32.5% with six or more) and the Packers beat him, 42-34, behind Rodgers' 131.1 passer rating.\n\"We felt like we could get after them with a four-man rush and play man versus a lot of quick game on first and second down,\" free safety Rodney McLeod said. \"That was the game plan.\n\"You notice on film, a lot of teams that blitz him, he just kind of throws quick … hot. Our plan was four-man rush. If they don't get there, get their hands up.\"\nThe Rams, in effect, were going strength against strength.\n\"We just believe in our talent versus theirs,\" Joyner said. \"They got their guy, Aaron Rodgers, but we have skilled guys on defense, too. We made it about winning your one-on-one matchups.\"\nSafety Mark Barron, who started at linebacker for injured Alec Ogletree, blitzed off the edge late in the first quarter but was blocked by tackle Bryan Bulaga.\n\"I had come a few times already and wasn't getting home,\" Barron said. \"So I said, 'The ball's coming out quick, get your hands up.'\"\nThe deflection was caught by a diving Laurinaitis, the middle linebacker, for an interception. Later in the first half, Johnson trusted his read and his speed, drove in front of James Jones and picked off a hitch.\n\"I felt like we did a great job today,\" said Barron. \"We picked him off, we caused some fumbles. We did all that here at this field. That hasn't been done in a long time.\"\nThe Rams' rush (two sacks) generally was adequate. Seldom was it intense.\n\"We're getting four to five sacks a game,\" Garcia said. \"But against a guy like Aaron, who knows how to get the ball out quickly, who can avoid and elude and feel pressure, you're lucky if you get one.\"\nWith the Rams trailing, 14-10, early in the third quarter, Williams committed five players to the rush on second and 10. One player dropped off when Richard Rodgers left the protection on a pass route.\nOn the left side, Jones ran a 17-yard crossing pattern with Joyner in one-on-one coverage.\nJones had little separation, so when Joyner saw Rodgers' slightly side-armed delivery he took a chance, left his feet and extended his body seeking either a deflection or interception.\nInstead, the pass was surgically placed and away went Jones from the sprawling Joyner. When McLeod took a too-sharp angle and missed the tackle, the completion ruptured into a 65-yard touchdown.\n\"Their plan, I think, was to really key on Randall (Cobb) at times in the slot and then say we'll make somebody else beat us,\" said Rodgers. \"We were fortunate enough to have a couple big plays for scores, but we didn't sustain drives like we usually do.\"\nRodgers finished with a passer rating of 82.8, preventing him from breaking the NFL record of 10 100-plus rating games at home that he shared with Kurt Warner (1999-'00).\n\"We were able to get some pressure on him without doing all those exotic things,\" said Barron. \"We were comfortable with that so that's what we kept doing.\"\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/331958621/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-12T12:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:20:38.234+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
