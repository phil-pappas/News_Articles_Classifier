The Bridgewomen are 5-0 in the American with three matches remaining, thanks to wins over fellow county tournament entries Cliffside Park and Dumont, as well as Ridgefield Park, which has dominated the division for several years. \n“I think we have an opportunity to win,” said senior hitter Stella Vaso, who came to Fort Lee from Italy as a sophomore and is the American Division’s top player. “I really hope we’re going to do well and win. It would be an honor for us to win after a long time.” \nZiemba credited two changes for the Bridgewomen enjoying their best season in several years. \n1. The introduction three years ago of a seventh/eighth-grade team. That middle-school experience allowed sophomores such as setter Brianna Forness and hitter Sophia Park to join Vaso and junior hitter Catherine Liapes this season on varsity. \n“They wouldn’t be playing varsity if we didn’t have the seventh/eighth-grade team,” said Ziemba, who this month earned his 200th career victory. \n2. The Bridgewomen participated in Tenafly’s summer camp, which helped avoid the slow starts that often paved the way for a losing season. \n“Everyone who went there improved a lot,” said the 5-foot-9 Vaso, “and that was really helpful.” \nFort Lee’s final goal is to earn a first-round home game in next month’s Group 2 tournament. Before that, though, the Bridgewomen will focus their attention on this week’s division rematch with Cliffside Park, then the Bergen tournament. \n“Bergen County volleyball is tough, it’s incredible,” said Ziemba, whose county has won 12 of the first 13 Tournament of Champions titles, with IHA winning the past four. “The bottom line is we’re happy where we are right now, and we want to finish the league off, and hopefully we can have a good game on Saturday.” \n\nBergen County girls volleyball tournament schedule \nFirst round by Saturday \n(32) Park Ridge at (1) NV/Old Tappan \n(17) Northern Highlands at (16) Becton \n(25) Lyndhurst at (8) Mahwah \n(24) Garfield at (9) Bogota \n(29) Wallington at (4) Paramus \n(20) Glen Rock at (13) Pascack Valley \n(28) Dumont at (5) NV/Demarest \n(21) Midland Park at (12) Fair Lawn \n(31) Hasbrouck Heights at (2) Immaculate Heart © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T13:35:06.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
