So did scoring goals.\nThe Ducks have just one goal in their first two games and Alex Burrows took the joy out of a festive sellout crowd at Honda Center by getting the difference-making goal in the shootout, lifting the Canucks to a 2-1 win.\nAn initial point was gained by the Ducks but not a win. It is the first time since 2010-11 that they’ve opened a season with consecutive losses. And they couldn’t make new defenseman Kevin Bieksa a winner in his first game against the team with which he played his first 10 seasons.\n“It’s not super frustrating,” Bieksa said. “I think you have to be patient and you have to know that it’s work in progress. There’s a lot of new guys coming in here and it’s not going to happen overnight.”\nIn the third round of the shootout, Burrows managed to sneak a shot between the pads of Ducks goalie Frederik Andersen that crawled over the goal line. Corey Perry ’s try to keep it going was denied on a sterling poke-check by Vancouver goalie Ryan Miller.\nIt capped an effective 28-save night for the veteran netminder, who’s in his second season with the Canucks. And it was another night of frustration for the Ducks, who’ve scored just one goal in six full periods and a five-minute overtime session.\n“We battled hard and it was one of those days that we didn’t win the hockey game,” said defenseman Sami Vatanen , who has that lone goal. “We had some chances. We just didn’t get the puck in the net.\n“The season is long and we’re going in the right way, so no worries.”\nA drama-free third period turned to overtime when the two teams couldn’t decide it in 60 minutes. Another five went by without a deciding marker as both teams made strong defensive plays while skating three skaters aside.\nThe Ducks gained an extra skater when Vancouver’s Alexander Edler was forced to hook Perry and deny a scoring chance. It was promptly frittered away, with captain Ryan Getzlaf turning the puck over twice and passing up chances to shoot on Miller.\nAs to their failed golden 4-on-3 chance, Ducks coach Bruce Boudreau said, “we got to get back to the drawing board.”\n“When you get those things, you can’t force plays,” Boudreau said. “I think we tried to force plays into areas that weren’t there. And when that happens and they get to clear it, it builds their momentum up and tears our down.\n“You get tired and you have to go back and get it all the time. It’s not a good thing.”\nShootout ace Jakob Silfverberg gave the Ducks a chance to grab their first two points of the young season when he snapped in a wrist shot. Canucks winger Radim Vrbata answered with a series of back-and-forth moves that ended with a successful backhand over Andersen.\nBurrows then gave Vancouver its second win in three games after Andersen appeared to have trapped the shot between his legs, only to watch it sneak in behind him.\nThe Ducks went the first 81 minutes, 56 seconds of their season without a goal until Vatanen delivered early in the second period. The defenseman got the puck from Andrew Cogliano at the point and uncorked a slap shot that snaked its way past a screened Miller.\nMike Santorelli got his first point with the Ducks, getting the second assist and providing the effective screen.\n“We need to score a goal,” Boudreau said. “We shoot from the point and you get traffic in front the net, that’s when things happen. We had opportunities but we didn’t get enough traffic in front of Ryan Miller, who is obviously playing pretty well right now.”\nThe term building block was used freely afterward in and around the Ducks dressing room. But they turned season-opening losses the past two seasons into seven-game winning streaks, which won’t be the case this time.\n“We played better tonight than we did in San Jose,” Bieksa said. “A lot better, I thought. If we keep a lid on this thing and build momentum, we have three more games at home here to get going.”\nContact the writer: estephens@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T14:38:19.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
