I watch how much work the kickers do on the park to get to that position,” said Wallabies vice-captain Michael Hooper. \n“It is no fluke they are out there kicking goals and kicking well. It is a lot of hard work. \n“They are the last guys out on the field often, so it’s good they get that praise and they deserve it because it is a job that is very difficult. \n“It’s pleasing because every team has a great kicker and it is hugely important to have one in your side.” \nTop five kickers left at the Rugby World Cup \n1.
