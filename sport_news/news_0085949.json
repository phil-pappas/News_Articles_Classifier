Here are a few numbers to get you ready for a big game in the Pac-12.\n6 \nThe Sun Devils have six different receivers with over 200 receiving yards on the season. Quarterback Mike Bercovici spreads the ball around the field quite a bit, but his favorite target so far has been D.J. Foster. Foster has caught a team-high 29 passes for 267 yards and three touchdowns.\n4 \nArizona State has never lost to Utah since the Utes joined the Pac-12. In four games against the Utes since 2011, Arizona State has won by an average score of 27.8-14, including a 19-16 overtime victory over the Utes in 2014.\n138.8 \nThe Sun Devils allow an average of 138.8 yards on the ground per game, making it very susceptible to the run. With a top-tier back like Devontae Booker (665 yards, six touchdowns) and a capable runner in quarterback Travis Wilson, Utah will need to be able to run the football and control the battle at the line of scrimmage as it has done for most of the year.\n15 \nArizona State began the 2015 season with very high expectations. The Sun Devils were ranked No. 15 in The AP Poll to begin the year and backed up after a 38-17 loss at the hands of Texas A&M in Week 1. Another big loss to USC dropped the Sun Devils out of the top 25. Since those pair of losses they knocked off then-unbeaten UCLA in the Rose Bowl and most recently beat Colorado 48-23.\n15 (again) \nArizona State quarterback Mike Bercovici is the 15th-best passer in the country so far this season. The senior has tossed for 1,604 yards, 14 touchdowns and just four interceptions, including a five-score performance last week against Colorado. The Utes just faced a top-tier quarterback in Cal's Jared Goff, and it will interesting to see if Utah will be able to rattle Bercovici as much as it was able to bother Goff.\n2 \nThe Utes are tied for second in the country with 12 interceptions on the season, already totaling their output from last season. Safety Marcus Williams has reeled on five of those INTs and has come on as a key player on the Utah defense. His play will be essential to a Utah win this Saturday.\nCJ Pronk is a Deseret Digital Media contributor and a Stansbury High School graduate.
