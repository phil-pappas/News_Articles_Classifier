The score helped punctuate a 17-7 Maroons win. \nRIDGEWOOD — All week leading up to last Friday’s game with Paramus, the Ridgewood High School football team was reminded of a year ago, when it came into that same game unbeaten and promptly got trounced. \nThat was the beginning of a season-ending, five-game losing streak that left a bitter taste in the mouths of the returning players. \nThe message got through. Thanks to a strong effort from the defense and an advantageous offense, the Maroons defeated the Spartans, 17-7, to improve to 5-1 and pretty much secure a spot in the North 1, Group 5 state playoffs. \nEntering tonight’s game with Hackensack, Ridgewood sits atop the sectional power point standings, making the game with the Comets a huge opportunity. \n\"This was a quality win, no doubt,\" RHS head coach Chuck Johnson said of the Paramus victory, \"but it is only one game. And we have to be prepared to play better if we’re going to win going forward.\" \nA victory over Hackensack (3-2) might be enough to secure home-field advantage in the first round of the playoffs. It also would be another step in the Ridgewood redemption tour, given that the team squandered an excellent first-half performance in last season’s meeting, and a second-half letdown resulted in a 20-17 loss. \n\"They present some matchup problems for us,\" Johnson said of the Comets. \"We’re going to have to play the same kind of defense we did against Paramus, maybe even better.\" \nIn last Friday’s game, the Maroon defense was led by the three down defensive linemen, who made enough key plays to keep Paramus (3-3) from breaking out in its running game. Derek De La Cruz racked up 177 rushing yards on 32 carries, but he was basically his team’s entire offense. \nPart of the reason was the exit of Spartans starting quarterback Christopher Gass due to an elbow injury in the second quarter. That left freshman Nick Tarabocchia at QB and De La Cruz as the focus of the offense. \nJunior nose guard Jack Simpson, senior defensive tackle Ken Ekert and junior defensive tackle Ted Murphy were the difference for RHS, combining for 16 tackles and creating enough havoc inside to keep the visitors from gaining any momentum. \n\"I wasn’t in the game last year, but I still felt the hurt, and all three of us knew what we had to do,\" Simpson said. \n\"We thought about 35-0 for a long time,\" Ekert said. \"This was our chance to do something about it, and as a group, we came into the game ready.\" \nRidgewood also got a boost from its passing game, something that will be essential to future success. \nWith the game scoreless in the second quarter, senior quarterback Griffin Peene lofted a deep pass to sophomore receiver Dan Romero, who caught it in stride and completed a 73-yard touchdown play, the longest reception for a Maroon since the 1990s. \nNext came a fortunate turn of events for Ridgewood, as a punt snap sailed over the Paramus kicker’s head. That put the ball at the Spartan 31-yard line and led to Wylie Sherman’s 36-yard field goal just before halftime, which made it 10-0. \nRHS then put together a six-minute, 11-play drive in the third quarter that all but closed out the game. There were two key moments, the first a 39-yard completion from sophomore QB Jack Barclay to Connor Krusac and a fourth-and-3 run of five yards for a red-zone first down by Jack Kiernan. \n\"That was a grinding drive,\" Johnson said. \"We set that fourth down up by running the reverse earlier. It softens the flank, and it was just enough.\" \nThe 79-yard march culminated with Zack Feagles’ five-yard touchdown run. The junior fullback finished with a team-high 62 yards on 15 rushes. \nParamus came back to score on its next possession with a De La Cruz 11-yard TD run but could get no closer. \nKiernan, who is emerging as a defensive force for the Maroons, made a few big plays. He snagged his third interception in two games and made perhaps the biggest defensive play on the series before the bad punt snap. \nThe Spartans ran a flea-flicker, a double-reverse pitch-back to Tarabocchia. Their receiver had slipped behind the secondary and was wide open, but Kiernan charged in from the left side and recorded the sack to preserve a 7-0 lead. The junior safety finished with nine tackles. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:58:31.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
