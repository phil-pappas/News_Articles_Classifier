I needed to be part of this. At the same time it's going again now and I am just looking forward to the next games. \n\"I play for my country and I am proud to do it. There are no small games. I have given everything I have, always, for City. I will carry on doing this and I will do the same for my country.\" \nKompany's return, despite the previous reservations of Pellegrini, gives City some positive news after a difficult international break. \nSergio Aguero, who scored five against Newcastle on his last City appearance, could be out for a month after suffering a hamstring injury playing for Argentina while David Silva injured his ankle on Spain duty. Left-back Aleksandar Kolarov also took a knock while away with Serbia. \nThe full extent of their injuries will become clear after City have carried out assessments. \nThese latest problems add to a number of issues City already had with Yaya Toure, Samir Nasri, Fabian Delph and Gael Clichy having also been sidelined.
