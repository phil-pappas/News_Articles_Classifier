Yet there he stood, hands on his thighs, staring dejectedly at the Nashua North 21-yard line. Concord had just scored to tie the game with 3:59 to play in the second quarter. On the first play of the Titans' next offensive series, the normally sure-handed senior running back fumbled the ball right back into Crimson Tide possession. Upset with himself, Leonard quickly regained his composure. So did the rest of the Titans (4-2), who despite trailing by a touchdown at the half managed to regroup and eventually score two fourth quarter touchdowns for a 28-21 win over the Crimson Tide (3-3) Saturday afternoon at Stellos Stadium. \"Honestly, our season this year, has kind of been the same thing - besides the Goffstown and Bedford games - we've had to come from behind and come together,\" said Leonard, who finished the day with 186 yards and four touchdowns (of 64, 3, 17, 5 yards) on 27 carries. \"We always seem to start off slow, which is exactly what happened today. But we came out with our adjustments, my line kept pounding - I never gave up on them and they never gave up on me. And we got it into the end zone.\" They did just that, scoring what many thought would be the game-tying touchdown on a 17-yard Leonard run. The point-after kick was blocked and Concord held a 21-20 lead with 5:49 to play. North's defense would bend but not break on the ensuing Concord offensive series, as the Titans allowed one first down before forcing a turnover on downs after the Crimson Tide attempted to go for it on fourth-and-2 from their own 42 with 2:28 to play. North's defense denied Concord quarterback Jacob Lewis ( 20 of 37 for 218 yards and three touchdowns) any room to run and set up Leonard for another score. The Titans, who rotated quarterbacks between Jeff Baldassari and Jared Levesque throughout the game, began their drive with Levesque finding Leonard on a screen for 15 yards. Leonard then carried the ball twice for 2 combined yards. Levesque then followed up an incomplete pass with a 39-yard strike to Dylan Salazar. With first-and-goal from the 5, Leonard took the handoff, twisted, spun and pushed his way into the end zone. He added a two-point run to close out the scoring with 1:28 remaining. \"I was hoping coach would give it to me,\" Leonard said. \"He trusted me. I trusted my line. We were not letting us not score there.\" Concord still had its chance to tie things up, and the Crimson Tide wouldn't go silently. They put together a 13-play drive that covered all but 24 seconds of the remaining time to lose on an incomplete pass in the back right corner of the end zone. Concord marched downfield as Lewis' scrambling ability allowed receivers to get behind the defensive backs for a couple of big gainers - the biggest being a 29-yard connection with Chandler Paradis down to the Titans' 11-yard line. Lewis spiked the ball on first down to stop the clock. His second and third down passes fell incomplete. He had three chances on fourth down with a pair of defensive pass interference calls against North, which moved the ball half the distance to the goal line each time but not enough to reach the 1 for a first down. With fourth-and-2 from the 3-yard line, Lewis looked right and fired. The ball was out of reach for his receiver and the Titans gained possession to take a knee with 24 seconds on the clock. This time Leonard had his hands in the air, celebrating with teammates as time ticked off the clock. \"That's a great game,\" North coach Dante Laurendi said. \"Both teams played their butts off and it came down to the wire. \"That's a good football team right there. They know how to win, and they aren't far removed from a state championship and being in the playoffs. That's a good football team and we had to catch up to them because they set the tone in the first half.\" The Titans actually struck first as Leonard went 64 yards for a touchdown on his third carry of the day, following a three-and-out for both teams in the opening quarter. With the addition of Jack Stone's point-after kick North took a 7-0 lead. Concord put together a 16-play drive that covered 76 yards and took just over six minutes off the clock to even things up on a Lewis 10-yard pass to Paradis. Dylan Thomson's kick tied the game at 7-7. North went ahead 14-7 as Leonard scored from 3 yards out after gobbling up 32 of his yards on eight carries along with a key 41-yard run by Jordan Buckmire to set up the Leonard touchdown. Stone's kick was good and the one-score advantage was back in place. At least for the next 2:24. Concord would knot things up again as Lewis found Gavin Moody for a 6-yard scoring strike and Thomson added the kick for a 14-14 score. The Crimson Tide would then grab that 21-14 lead heading into the break as Lewis connected with Paradis for 33 yards and a score as the clock struck 18.4 seconds left in the second quarter.
