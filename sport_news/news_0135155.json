Long, who is 6-foot-7 and 222 pounds, helped kids on to the Red Baron , the Tilt a Whirl and the Ferris wheel.\n\"At times, it was a little boring, if it was slow,\" Long said. \"Other times, it was really fun because the kids are energetic and happy to be there and the parents are happy. It was a good time.\"\nThey were probably more entertained than Siena fans who watched the Saints nosedive to an 11-20 record last season. It was an especially trying season for Long, who struggled through a sprained ankle and couldn't stay out of foul trouble for the second year in a row.\nHe averaged 10.4 points and a team-high 4.9 rebounds per game in an undermanned frontcourt that lost forward Brett Bisping and center Imoh Silas to season-ending injuries.\n\"It definitely was a difficult year just because there were a lot of situations where we could have used more bigs,\" Long said. \"It was a different team, basically, not the team I was used to playing with in practice and it made it more difficult. On top of that, I got hurt, so that even added to the difficult state we were in.\"\nLong is healthy again as the Saints try to recover from last season's disappointment. They just concluded their second full week of preseason practice with the season opener at defending national champion Duke looming on Nov. 13.\nMoreover, Long said he is in a different frame of mind. Like he assisted those children at the amusement park over the summer, Long said he's trying to aid his younger teammates.\n\"I think I'm more talkative,\" Long said. \"I'm a lot more energetic. I feel (like) more of a leader this year than prior. We've got a lot of new faces and people coming in. As a junior now, it's my responsibility to help the younger guys and that requires me to talk.\"\nSiena head coach Jimmy Patsos has noticed. Through 10 preseason practices, Patsos gave an 'A' grade to just two players, Long and sophomore guard Kadeem Smithen , relative to their ability. Smithen is sitting out this season as a transfer from Richmond.\n\"Because (Long) has been so consistent,\" Patsos explained. \"He looks good. He's making good plays and good passes.\"\nWhile the injuries to Bisping and Silas received a lot of attention, Patsos said Long's high-ankle sprain was just as damaging to the Saints. Long hurt his right ankle in an early-season practice. He returned after a few games but the pain lingered for most of the season.\n\"The injury that killed us last year was Lavon's,\" Patsos said. \"That middle was so bad because Lavon (was out). We had no chance to win those games.\"\nThough the injury couldn't keep Long off the court, repeated foul trouble did. He led the nation in personal fouls per game with 4.19 as a sophomore, according to teamrankings.com, after ranking fourth with 3.89 as a freshman.\nPatsos flirted with the idea of bringing Long off the bench so that he won't draw early fouls and become upset with the officials. \"I asked him and Lavon told me he'd like to start, but if it's going to be best for the team, coming off the bench, he'd do that,\" Patsos said. \"He asked if he could at least have a chance to prove that he's not going to foul. And that's fair. That's where we're at.\"\nLong said his fouls often came in the final few seconds of the shot clock after he'd had a solid defensive possession.\n\"That's probably my biggest thing, after going down the whole shot clock and getting them to take a tough shot, but still wanting to block it,\" he said. \"Contest them, but don't try to block. Just make it difficult.\"\nPatsos said Siena doesn't need Long \"to be a star.\" He needs Long on the court because of his passing ability, his knowledge and the matchup problems he creates for opponents.\n\"It's very important,\" Long agreed. \"It's probably the top priority. All the things I work on don't really matter if I'm on the bench.\"\nLong seated people at Huck Finn's Playland. He doesn't want to be seated next to his coach.\nmsingelais@timesunion.com • 518-454-5509 • @MarkSingelais", "external_links": ["http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803356/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803353/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803355/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803360/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803357/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803360/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803359/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803363/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803365/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803353/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803355/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803359/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803356/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803357/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803363/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803353/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803354/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803362/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803356/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803365/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803355/5/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803354/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803360/5/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803359/5/628x471.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803362/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803357/5/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803365/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803362/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803354/5/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/45/20/8803363/5/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T08:19:57.705+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
