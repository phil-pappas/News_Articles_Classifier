Blue of Montgomery, Alabama, announced on Twitter that he had decommitted from the University of South Carolina. \nSeveral of the Gamecocks’ other 16 commitments for the Class of 2016 have publically expressed reservations in the hours since. \nThe longer-term question that lingers for South Carolina fans, though, is if the midseason timing of Spurrier’s announcement could ultimately be beneficial for recruiting. Retirement speculation was going to continue, regardless, and the coaching change allows the remaining Gamecocks staff to move forward. \nSpurrier and Shawn Elliott, who’ll reportedly be named interim coach , are expected to address the topic at today’s noon news conference, which will be broadcast live at GreenvilleOnline.com . After talking it over with my family I have decided to decommit from the University of South Carolina. — P.J. BLUE... (@Ocho_Blu8) October 13, 2015 \nAccording to rankings compiled by national analysts, the Gamecocks’ recruiting efforts had already fallen in recent years, compared Spurrier-era highs when South Carolina landed the nation’s No. 1 prospect, Jadeveon Clowney, and others. \nSouth Carolina’s top commitment for 2016, four-star dual-threat quarterback Brandon McIlwain of Newtown, Pennsylvania, remains committed despite the change, according to reports from Rivals and 247Sports.com. \nMcIlwain, also a highly touted baseball prospect, has weighed offers from Ohio State, Florida, Auburn and others. \nFour-star safety Marlon Character of Atlanta, who committed to the Gamecocks over scholarship offers from about 20 schools, posted “No comment” on Twitter on Monday night, apparently in response to Spurrier’s retirement. \nFour-star receiver Bryan Edwards of Conway, who has had offers from Clemson and others, posted his feelings on Twitter Monday night: “As of now I am verbally committed to USC, South Carolina my home and I have tons of love for it and the University of South Carolina their program and fans. Obviously the timing of coach Spurrier's retirement is a surprise and sad thing to see, however at the same time I have to do what's best for me and my future as a student athlete. I will be contemplating my future in the next few weeks in light of recent events.\" What I have to say about the situation. pic.twitter.com/Qnor3RxoF6 — Bryan Edwards (@Edwards_Bryan4) October 13, 2015 \nAnother Gamecocks commitment, three-star running back C.J. Freeman of Greensboro, North Carolina, who has had offers from West Virginia and others, posted: “Smh,” as in “Shaking my head.” \nTwo-star offensive tackle Will Putnam of Harrisburg, North Carolina, who’s also considered an offer from Virginia Tech, posted: “Not the news I was expecting tonight.” \nFour-star receiver Kelvin Harmon of Palmyra, New Jersey, who has had offers from North Carolina and others, apparently will remain loyal. He posted: “I understand about coach Spurrier, all respect for him but I didn’t choose South Carolina for him, still content with my decision #WeCocky.” \n- Follow Michael Burns on Twitter @MikeNearGreer 7 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://grnol.co/1LsotXi TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T18:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:57:14.009+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
