It's a tax that football have had to pay.\"\nBlatter, who took the World Cup to Africa for the first time, was re-elected in May but then succumbed to an international outcry and is due to step down in February.\nEcclestone faced bribery allegations of his own in a German court last year, eventually paying a $100 million settlement to avoid a lengthy trial and preserve his innocence.\nThe diminutive billionaire is no stranger to controversial comments, causing a storm in 2009 when he told a newspaper interviewer that Adolf Hitler was someone who was \"able to get things done\".\nThe Briton, who subsequently apologized unreservedly for that comment, has compared himself to a dictator in his sport and expressed his admiration for 'strong leaders'.\nEcclestone told the Russian station, who published the interview on their website on Friday (www.rt.com/shows/sophieco/318842-sport-speed-formula-one/), that he did not \"think there's any place for democracy, full stop. Anywhere.\"\nAsked what he thought of Putin, who presented the winner's trophy to Britain's world champion Lewis Hamilton at last weekend's Russian Grand Prix in Sochi, Ecclestone said: \"Super. I'm his best supporter.\"\nTurning to America, Ecclestone said: \"We (Formula One) ought to try and beef up a little bit in America.\n\"It's hard for me. I'm not very enthusiastic about America,\" he added.\n\"The biggest problem with them is I think they believe they're the greatest sort of power in the world. Believe. Not in reality but in belief.\n\"And it's difficult, because, they are a big island so they are a bit isolated. They are slowly starting to learn about what other people in the world do.\"\nThe Russian station headlined the interview: \"Bernie Ecclestone: America falsely believes it's greatest superpower\".\n(Reporting by Alan Baldwin, editing by Martyn Herman)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T21:21:08.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
