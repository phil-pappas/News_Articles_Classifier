Chersi (40) converge on Clifton running back Hunter Halliburton to make a tackle in a Big North football game last Friday. Edwards also intercepted a pair of passes to help the Maroons pick off the Mustangs, 30-14. \nRIDGEWOOD — Now comes the hard part. \nSitting at 4-1 and atop the North 1, Group 5 power point table, Ridgewood High School would seem to be primed for a postseason run. It’s a position in which the Maroons found themselves one year ago, and RHS fans all know what happened after that. Buy this photo Senior halfback Erik Bachrach (4) looks to scoot through an opening as his Ridgewood teammate Jack Dougherty (73) prepares to block a Clifton defender in last Friday night’s football game. Bachrach ran for two touchdowns in the Maroons’ win. \nFrom 5-0 to 5-5, the 2014 season took a downhill slide, and it all began with a game against Paramus, which administered a 35-0 drubbing that served as the most embarrassing moment of last fall. \nFor the Ridgewood juniors and seniors who played in that game, they’ve had a year to digest it and understand how not to let it happen again. Their shot at redemption comes tonight, when Paramus visits RHS Stadium for a 7 p.m. kickoff. \nStill, the successes of the past month could be a powerful deterrent to the task at hand. \nSenior co-captain Zack Edwards disagrees. The senior cornerback said, \"We remember what that felt like, the embarrassment and the disappointment. We went in there thinking that we were much better than we really were. \n\"I, for one, am not going to let that happen,\" Edwards added. \"We came out last year with no energy. This year, we’re going to have to be more prepared and ready to play. If we don’t take care of business, the past four weeks mean nothing.\" \n\"We’re not going to let that happen again,\" cornerback/kicker Wylie Sherman said. \"We’ll come out as hard as we can and take nothing for granted.\" \nThe most recent of those four weeks to which Edwards alluded was a 30-14 win over vastly improved Clifton (2-1-1) last Friday. It was somewhat a tale of two games, as Ridgewood turned in a strong first-half performance to go up, 24-0. \nJunior safety Jack Kiernan had two interceptions on back-to-back Clifton possessions, while the Mustangs completed only 1-of-7 passes, and that ‘1’ went for no gain. The visitors gained only 72 total yards as the defense kept them outside the Ridgewood 45-yard line. \nAll this came after the game was held up for one hour and 19 minutes due to lightning. Ironically, the start time had been moved up to 6 p.m., only to end up being offset by the weather. \n\"I thought we handled the delay at the beginning pretty well,\" RHS head coach Chuck Johnson said. \"We didn’t handle the second one nearly as well.\" \nThe latter was a frustrating delay, as the stadium lights went out with 3:05 left in the third quarter and Ridgewood ahead, 30-6, and moving the ball. The 25-minute wait for the lights to come back on sapped the Maroons’ momentum. \nClifton had gotten its first touchdown just prior to the power outage, when receiver Delano Dixon got behind the defense to catch a 26-yard toss from quarterback Joe Santillo on fourth down. \nThe Mustangs added their only post-delay points on a four-yard Santillo-to-Dixon TD pass, after two key completions helped set it up. Clifton was 8-of-18 passing for 101 yards in the second half. \n\"That was really inexcusable,\" Johnson said. \"It was a basic breakdown, and something that just shouldn’t happen.\" \nIn some ways, it may just act as a bit of a wakeup call for Ridgewood as it welcomes in Paramus (3-2). The Spartans are coming off a bye, giving them the extra week to get sophomore quarterback Chris Gass indoctrinated into the offense. Gass stepped in to the role after starter Chris Regalbuto was sidelined for the season with a broken leg. \nParamus also is in a dogfight for a North 1, Group 3 playoff spot, making this contest almost a must-win for both teams. \nThe Maroons will need to keep the offensive balance in their running game. Last week, senior quarterback Griffin Peene rushed 10 times for 114 yards and two touchdowns, and senior halfback Erik Bachrach added 66 yards and two touchdowns on six carries. \nRidgewood also got 30 yards on seven carries from sophomore fullback Coleston Smith before an ankle injury forced him out. Mike Rabinowitz stepped in and ran 10 times for 40 yards. \n\"He answered the bell,\" Johnson said of Rabinowitz, who overcame a lost fumble on his first carry after a missed block left him hung out to dry on a smash-mouth hit. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:28:11.144+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
