Before last week's win over East Carolina, BYU had never come back from a 14-point deficit under head coach Bronco Mendenhall. Now, the resilient Cougars have done it two weeks in a row. That's a first in BYU history.\nAnd while the quarterback and running backs had solid games, the stars of this win were in the trenches. Here's BYU's grades in their win over Cincinnati\nQuarterback\nTanner Mangum had a slow start as he struggled with a hamstring injury he sustained last week against East Carolina. Regardless, he had more yards and touchdowns than Cincinnati's Hayden Moore by the end of the game. Mangum finished with 252 yards passing, two touchdowns and one interception on the night.\nRemember, Mangum is a true freshman. This week, he was a true freshman with a sore hamstring. It is incredible what Mangum has been able to accomplish despite all that.\nGrade: B+\nRunning back\nThis was by far the best game by BYU's running backs. Algie Brown added 88 yards and two more touchdowns against the Bearcats as he's settled into the feature back role. Francis Bernard and Riley Burt both had runs of more than 40 yards, although Burt's time was cut short due to a hamstring injury. All told, the Cougars rushed for 197 yards and three touchdowns. It was critical for the running backs to help take pressure off Mangum, and they delivered.\nGrade: A-\nWide receiver\nThe wide receivers had a few too many drops against the Bearcats. Mitch Mathews had a rough game with just three catches on the night. The star of the wide receivers was Nick Kurtz, who finished with 119 yards and his first two touchdowns as a Cougar. Kurtz also helped put the offense in a deep hole with a late unsportsmanlike penalty.\nPerhaps not the best night for the Cougar wide receivers, but they did have their moments against the Bearcats.\nGrade: C+\nOffensive line\nDespite losing two starters, the offensive line did not give up a sack and opened up wide holes for the running game. Mangum had plenty of time to throw despite not being as mobile in this game due to his hamstring injury. The Cougars dominated in the trenches, particularly late in the game.\nGrade: A\nFront seven\nThe Cougar front seven had an incredible game with eight sacks. Bronson Kaufusi led the team with three sacks, while Travis Tuiloma, Sae Tautu, Harvey Langi and Sione Takitaki all got to the quarterback on Friday night. And while they did give up 121 yards rushing, the Cougars shut down the high-powered Cincinnati offense late in the game. The Bearcats had given up just six sacks all season long coming into this game.\nBYU won this game in part because players like Kaufusi went into beast mode in the fourth quarter and stopped Cincinnati's Moore from getting anything done in the fourth quarter.\nGrade: A\nSecondary", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team33.html", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639261%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445108431", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639261%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445108430", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639261%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445108433", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639261%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=preroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445108432", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639261%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445108433", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639261%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445108432", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639261%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445108431", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ads?env=vp&gdfp_req=1&impl=s&sz=1x1000&output=xml_vast2&iu=/6686/ddm.dn/sports/main&cust_params=section%3Dsports%26subSection%3Dmain%26page-type%3Darticle%26article-id%3D865639261%26content-category%3Dbyu-cougars%2Csports%2Cbyu-football%26dev-location%3Ddesktop-content-video-template%26pos%3Dplayer&vpos=postroll&unviewed_position_start=1&url=http://www.deseretnews.com/&correlator=1445108430"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T22:07:20.569+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
