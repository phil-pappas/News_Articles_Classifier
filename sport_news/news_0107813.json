Will the Rebels bounce back from such a difficult loss? Coach Tony Sanchez is really good at keeping his team focused on what's ahead, and he had his players ready to play on Saturday just a week after the emotional high of beating UNR. UNLV gave San Jose State all it had, but the 33-27 overtime loss was a tough one for the Rebels. Sanchez, no doubt, will remind the Rebels that they have their goals in front of them.\n2. Speaking of those goals, how realistic are they? UNLV still hopes to compete for the Mountain West title, which means winning the West Division. The Rebels also hope to make a bowl, which means getting at least 6-6. Both goals took a hit with the loss to the Spartans, but the Rebels (2-4, 1-1 MW) still have a shot at them. The West is beyond horrid, so expect the divisional winner to have at least one loss. As for bowl eligibility, UNLV needs to win four of its final six games. The Rebels should have every opportunity to beat Fresno State, Hawaii and Wyoming. If UNLV wins all three games — and there is no guarantee the Rebels will sweep those opponents — then it comes down to finding a victory against Boise State, Colorado State or San Diego State. Not easy, but not impossible.\n3. Is Fresno State really that bad? Yes. It's incredible this is the same program that won the conference championship two seasons ago, but Derek Carr and Davante Adams aren't walking back in the Bulldogs' locker room.\n4. Is there any reason UNLV should lose? The Rebels can definitely lose at Fresno State, but if they want to be taken seriously as a contender this season, they need to go in there and win. And, frankly, win convincingly.\n5. What the deal with UNLV's quarterback situation? Kurt Palandech made the key plays down the stretch against San Jose State, but his struggles throughout much of the game allowed the Spartans to focus on shutting down the Rebels' running attack. UNLV needs Blake Decker back, and back healthy, to give the Rebels a threat of a consistent passing game. Having said that, Palandech's late play should be the confidence boost he needs going forward.\nContact Mark Anderson at manderson@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2914.
