(AP) — Tony Stewart will announce he’s retiring following the 2016 season at a news conference Wednesday, The Associated Press has learned. \nStewart-Haas Racing said Sunday night that Stewart and team co-owner Gene Haas will hold a news conference at the team shop this week. The topic was not disclosed, but a person familiar with Stewart’s plans told AP the three-time NASCAR champion will announce his planned retirement. \nThe person spoke to AP on condition of anonymity because Stewart hasn’t publicly disclosed his plans. \nStewart, who finished 11th on Sunday at New Hampshire, did not return a request for comment from AP. \nHis planned departure, first reported Sunday by Motorsport.com, is not a surprise. Stewart will be 45 next season, hasn’t won a race in more than two years and has been privately working on finding a successor all year. \nClint Bowyer, released from his contract with Michael Waltrip Racing because the team is folding at the end of the season, likely will replace Stewart in 2017. Bowyer has been looking for a one-year deal for next season as a stopgap while Stewart runs his 18th and final Cup season. SHR also field cars for reigning series champion Kevin Harvick, Kurt Busch and Danica Patrick. \nThe last three years have been trying for Stewart. He struck and killed a sprint car driver during a 2014 event in upstate New York, and the family has filed a civil suit against Stewart. He also missed the final third of the 2013 season with a broken leg suffered in a sprint car crash. \nHis passion for NASCAR racing has also waned in the last several seasons, in part because of an evolving rules package that he has struggled with. Stewart told AP in June that his confidence was shot and he was struggling to find any enjoyment in being in the race car. \nNot much has worked for him this season, as Stewart is 25th in the points standings and failed to qualify for the Chase for the Sprint Cup championship for the third consecutive year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T19:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:11:55.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
