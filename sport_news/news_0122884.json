They can simply head over to the Jepson Center on Telfair Square.\n“Monet and American Impressionism,” a stunning new exhibit filling the featured second-floor galleries at the Jepson Center, marks the first time Monet’s work has ever been shown locally.\n“This exhibit is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for many people who live in Savannah,” said Lisa Grove, director and CEO of Telfair Museums. “To be able to host an exhibit of this caliber is thrilling. Claude Monet is well known as the leader of French Impressionism, which continues to be one of the best-loved movements in art history.”\n“Monet and American Impressionism” is organized by the Harn Museum of Art in Gainesville, Fla., in partnership with Telfair Museums and the Hunter Museum of American Art in Chattanooga, Tenn. The exhibit includes six paintings from the Telfair’s permanent collection, including original work by Frederick Carl Frieseke, Childe Hassam, Gari Melchers and Willard Leroy Metcalf.\n“These paintings in the Telfair’s permanent collection have new life and new vibrancy when they’re contextualized and among their friends,” Grove explained. “We feel like we’re taking the museum to the next level.”\nThe Jepson Center serves as the third and final stop for this ambitious exhibit, which debuted at the Harn Museum of Art and continued at the Hunter Museum of American Art. “Monet and American Impressionism” features more than 45 paintings, many of which are on loan from the National Gallery of Art, Smithsonian American Art Museum, Terra Foundation for American Art and Brooklyn Museum. This impressive exhibit showcases a wide range of subject matter, from serene landscapes to intimate interiors.\nOrganized thematically, the exhibit hangs four Monet paintings alongside original work by American Impressionists like Mary Cassatt, Theodore Robinson, Gary Melchers and Childe Hassam. Themes include the Allure of Giverny, the Vibrance of Urbanism, A Country Retreat and The Comfort of Home.\nMonet, a key figure in the Impressionist movement who transformed French painting in the latter half of the 19th century, broke with the academic style of painting and the tendency toward realism that defined European art at the time. His freely brushed, unblended colors and asymmetrical compositions evoked the essence of the scene at hand, rather than slavishly reproducing it.\nIn his Impressionist work, which was often painted en plein air, Monet emphasized the changing qualities of natural light and the passage of time, including human perception as an important element of landscape painting.\nMonet’s 1890 oil painting, “Champ d’Avoine” (Oat Field), kicks off the exhibition, demonstrating the dramatic effects of light and atmosphere on this composition, painted on-site in Giverny, France. Rough, unblended brush strokes and late summer sunlight lend a sense of poetry to this radiant landscape painting.\nHis 1882 seaside reverie, “Maree Montant a Pourville” (Rising Tide at Pourville),” focuses on lilac and white waves cascading rhythmically toward the shore. In this charming scene of a lone cottage overlooking the sea, Monet seems to have a deeper, more existential focus, as he directs the viewer’s eye to the vast, mysterious surf offshore.\nTwo of Monet’s bridge paintings — “Waterloo Bridge,” a dreamy 1903 work painted in the artist’s signature pastel hues, and “Bridge at Argentenil on a Gray Day,” an early 1876 work revealing his growing interest in maritime scenes and village life — round out the French master’s contribution to this exhibit.\nInterestingly, many American artists traveled to Giverny to paint alongside Monet. The French Impressionist’s influence on American artists at the time is undeniable and is evident in throughout the exhibition. Frederick Carl Friseke’s 1910 painting “The Garden Umbrella,” which is part of the Telfair’s permanent collection, showcases a lush Victorian garden scene defined by dappled light, elegant hues and loose, impressionistic brushstrokes.\n“American artists adopted a lot of Monet’s style,” explained Courtney McNeil, the Telfair Museums’ curator of fine art and exhibitions. “They were interested in the effects of light, shadows and unblended brushstrokes.”\nThe exhibit also features seven prints by Mary Cassatt, an acclaimed American artist whose work reveals the influence of Japanese woodblock painting in her drypoint and aquatint compositions.\nHighlights of “Monet and American Impressionism” include stunning rural landscapes in New Hampshire, Maine, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, painted by a range of American artists, as well as more complex urban scenes depicting city life.\nJonas Lie’s “Dusk on Lower Broadway,” a moody 1910 street scene, captures the gravitas of the city at twilight. Gary Melchers’s “Unpretentious Garden” offers a sun-lit glimpse of Dutch garden, while Richard Emil Milan’s “La Toilette” provides a sensuous view of a woman engaged in a quiet moment of reflection.\n“We invite viewers to bask in the open landscapes and idyllic afternoons portrayed in this beautiful exhibition,” said Grove. “As viewers move through dozens of paintings, they will see how Monet inspired some of the greatest American Impressionists of all time.\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: “Monet and American Impressionism”\nWhere: Jepson Center, 207 W.
