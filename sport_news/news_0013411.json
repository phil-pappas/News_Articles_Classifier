Florida will remain in control of the East race with a loss, but a win in Tiger Stadium would do wonders for the Gators College Football Playoff hopes. \nKEY MATCHUP \nLSU’s SEC-best running game, which features Heisman Trophy candidate Leonard Fournette and averages a whopping 346.4 yards vs. the Gators’ defense, which ranks second in the SEC against the run, giving up an average of 99.2 yards. \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nFLORIDA: Jalen Tabor is having one of the best seasons of any defensive back in the country, with two interceptions for TDs and ranks first in the SEC with eight passes defended. With Florida likely stacking eight players close to the line of scrimmage to defend the run, Tabor’s coverage ability in one-on-one situations against LSU’s best receivers could become a key factor. \nLSU: Fournette leads the nation in yards rushing (1,022), yards rushing per game (204.4) and TDs rushing (12). \nFACTS & FIGURES \nFlorida is starting backup QB Treon Harris after starter Will Grier was suspended for failing a drug test. Harris, a sophomore, started seven times last season, going 5-2, including an upset win over then No. 9 Georgia in his first career start. … The Gators, who were plus-2 in turnover margin at Missouri, are an SEC-best plus-8 this season, which ranks eighth nationally. … Florida has recorded at least three sacks in every game this season. … The last time Florida won in Tiger Stadium (2009), they were an unbeaten, No. 1-ranked team and Tim Tebow was their QB. … LSU has scored 18 of its 22 offensive TDs on the ground. … K Trent Domingue has made all seven field goal attempts this season. … LSU has had at least one 100-yard rusher in 13 of 17 games in which offensive linemen Vadal Alexander, Jerald Hawkins and Ethan Pocic started together. Last week, LSU had two 100-yard rushers vs. South Carolina, Fournette (158) and Derrius Guice (161).
