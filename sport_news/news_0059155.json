That day, Justin Hammert came through with the game-tying goal and in what finished as a tie game — the only game Prep has not won this season. \nWith his team facing the same scenario Wednesday, Hammert came through again. But this time, he added two more. \nHammert’s second-half hat trick powered Scranton Prep to a 3-1 win and the Lackawanna League Division I championship — its first division title since 2003. \n“We know when we get down that it’s not the end of the world,” Hammert said. “We know we have the personnel to come back and we’re strong. We’re not going to give up just because we’re down one. We’re going to push on and do everything we can and just make sure we could give it our all to get the win.” \nIt didn’t take long for Scranton Prep (11-0-1) to get in an early deficit. In the fourth minute, Spencer Atkins delivered a pass that behind the Cavaliers defense in front of the net and John McGarry was there to clean it up and knock it in for a goal to give the Comets (10-3) a 1-0 lead. \nMcGarry nearly added his second goal in the 10th minute, but goalkeeper Blake Hammert made a diving save. \nBoth teams had their share of opportunities the rest of the half but neither converted. \nJustin Hammert almost tied it five minutes into the second half when he fired a shot from about 25 yards out, but goalkeeper Jackson Danzig made a diving save. Seven minutes later, the Comets were on the attack and Colin Klingman ripped a shot that deflected off the head of his defender. \nThe ball bounced to Noah Sirianni, who got off a good shot, but Blake Hammert made the save and the Cavaliers immediately went on the attack. \nCullen Myers took the through ball to the 18-yard box and boxed out his defender to create separation. When his defender fell to the turf, Myers got control of the ball and made a move toward the net and laid a pass off to Justin Hammert, who knocked it in from point-blank range to tie the match. \n“We’ve been doing that all year,” Justin Hammert said. “Cullen drives to the line and he cuts it back to me. As soon as I saw that he had the path, I just go for it and he knows that if he doesn’t have the shot, he has me trailing.” \nFour minutes later, Justin Hammert struck again. After Abington Heights was whistled for a foul, he lined up for a direct kick from 25 yards out and hooked his shot over the wall of defenders and toward the middle of the net. \nDanzig used his length, jumped up and appeared to make the save but he couldn’t maintain control. The ball fell behind him and his diving attempt to save it came up short, as the ball crossed the goal line to put the Cavaliers ahead, 2-1. \nScranton Prep clung to that lead but Justin Hammert iced it with four minutes left, when he ran up the middle of the field past his defenders and flipped a shot to the bottom right corner of the net. \n“This was a gut check for us,” Scranton Prep coach Sean Curry said. “(With the District 2 playoffs looming) nothing is going to be easy from this point on — not that it’s been easy. One of the things we talked about is that heart and hustle are going to create opportunities. I’m incredibly proud of the heart of these guys. Technique could only carry you so far but sometimes, heart trumps technique and it was great to see that.” \nContact the writer: \nScranton Prep 3 Abington Heights 1 \nAbington Heights (10-3) 1 0 — 1
