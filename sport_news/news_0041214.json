That was part of her message during a visit to South Dakota State University. Secretary Albright, who is the first female to hold the position, was part of the Daschle Dialogues. The forum brings in nationally relevant figures to campus for an appearance with former U.S. Senator Tom Daschle. \nWhen a Secretary of State visits your campus, it is serious business. However, a smiling Albright broke the ice with a joke about how her famous collection of brooches was born. \n\"The reporter said, 'Why are you wearing a snake pin?' I said, 'Because Saddam Hussein compared me to an unparalleled serpent.' And I thought, well, this is fun,\" Albright said, noting she has a pin for every occasion. \nShe wore a Jackrabbit on Tuesday, but her discussion with SDSU students is not about how to dress for success. Her advice to them to make the nation and world a better place is simple. \n\"Nothing can be done if you don't work really hard. You can't kind of fake it. So, I think students that really give it their full attention and dig and do research and talk to each other and do what I said, venting different ideas and defending them. If you have to defend what you think, then that is the most important aspect,\" Albright said. \nAlbright and Daschle spoke to a sold out crowd at Larson Memorial Concert Hall in the Performing Arts Center. Albright is the first former Cabinet member to visit Brookings since former Secretary of Agriculture Robert Bergland appeared at State in fall 1981. \nIn a time when it is easy to only be mindful of what is going on in your backyard, Albright is urging students to see the connection between domestic and foreign policy. Right now, she is very concerned with the turmoil between Russia and Syria. \n\"We have planes, our coalitions are flying there, that there will be some accident and then we'd really would have very bad problems in terms of what some have described as a proxy war, but also as a direct accident,\" Albright said. \nOn American soil, Albright and Daschle are both watching the current presidential race closely. They say many of today's politicians do not seem to cross party lines. \n\"That doesn't mean we should give up. We've got to keep forcing the issue and the Secretary said it so well. Compromise is not capitulation. Compromise is the only way to run the country,\" Albright said. \nIt is no joke the state of the world needs a bit of fixing. Albright says the only way to seriously do that is for all of us to break the ice and work together. \n\"We are a very powerful nation that can make a difference, but we don't have to do it ourselves. I've said it many times, but I'll repeat it. Americans don't like the word multilateralism. It has too many syllables and ends with an ism, but all it means is partnership,\" Albright said. \nAlbright was the 64th secretary of state, then the highest-ranking woman in the history of the U.S. government. She is currently a professor in the practice of diplomacy at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. She also serves as chair of Albright Stonebridge Group and chair of Albright Capital Management LLC, an investment advisory firm focused on emerging markets. \nShe chairs the National Democratic Institute for International Affairs, serves as the president of the Truman Scholarship Foundation and is a member of the U.S. Defense Department's Defense Policy Board. In May 2012, Albright was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in recognition of her contributions to international peace and democracy. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
