The nomination was announced by the Maxwell Football Club on Thursday.\nThe initial nominees were selected based on their performance during the 2014 season, but Harris was one of the 13 additional nominees selected due to their performance thus far in the 2015 season. Harris joins teammate Kentrell Brothers on the list.\nHarris leads the SEC in tackles for a loss with 11.5 and ranks seventh in the SEC with 4.0 sacks. The sophomore has played a large part in the Tigers leading the SEC and ranking third nationally in tackles for a loss, leading a young defensive line that lost Harold Brantley, arguably the team’s most talented defender, to a season ending injury before the season.\nSemifinalists for the Bednarik Award will be announced on Nov. 2 and three finalists will be announced Nov. 24.\nThe winner of the 2015 Bednarik Awards will be announced as part of the Home Depot College Football Awards Show which will be held on Dec 10 at the College Football Hall of Fame in Atlanta. The formal presentation of these awards will be made at the Maxwell Football Club Awards Gala hosted by Tropicana Hotel & Casino Atlantic City on March 11. \nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
