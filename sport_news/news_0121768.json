Posted: Saturday, October 17, 2015 4:30 am Hickey getting his opportunity BY ERIC DRENNAN | TELEGRAM STAFF Killeen Daily Herald | 0 comments \nBELTON — Raylon Hickey makes his first start today, and it comes against a team that has no qualms with throwing the ball all over the field. \nIt’s a safe bet that the Mary Hardin-Baylor freshman cornerback will be nervous, but don’t assume he’s in over his head. Remember this is the guy who made his college debut by snaring two interceptions in the season opener. \n“I’m very nervous but very excited at the same time,” said Hickey, who will start when No. 2 UMHB (5-0, 1-0 American Southwest Conference) faces Louisiana College (2-3, 1-1) at 1 p.m. today in Pineville, La. “(LC) has some pretty good athletes out there, but I think I’m ready for it.” \nThe Crusaders’ coaches certainly believe Hickey’s ready, inserting him into the lineup while sophomore Bryce Wilkerson serves a one-game suspension for violating team rules. \n“He’s smart enough and athletic enough that he played in the first ballgame of the year as a freshman,” UMHB coach Pete Fredenburg said of Hickey. “That tells you something about him.” \nThe 5-foot-11, 175-pound Giddings product found out Sunday that he would start this week and took it all in stride. \n“I had my hopes that I would start some this season,” he said. “I have speed.” \nThat’s an understatement. \nHickey broke the 48-second barrier in the 400 meters in high school, was part of two state champion relay teams in the 4x400 and was a dangerous running back during his days in Giddings. \nIt didn’t take long for the UMHB coaching staff to find a way to better maximize his speed. \n“I was a running back when I was recruited, but I was a cornerback from the first day I got here,” Hickey said. “I do miss running the ball some, but I don’t mind hitting some people.” \nHe has proven that with his performances. He has 17 tackles and a team-high three interceptions. \n“It has taken me some time to learn all of the techniques,” he admitted. “It’s tough in this defense because there’s a lot that goes into it. I have a safety over the top to help sometimes, but it’s a lot of pressure to cover a guy.” \nTo help alleviate some of the pressure, the Crusaders don’t plan on leaving Hickey on an island where he has to sink or swim. \n“We’ll protect him,” Fredenburg said. “He’ll have some help.” \nEven if the Wildcats manage to deploy their receivers in such a way that Hickey is forced to cover one all by himself, he believes the work he has done in practice will have him prepared. \n“The toughest thing has been the competition out here,” he said. “It may look like I’ve been able to handle it easily, but it’s tough out there. The one-on-one matchups in practice are tough, much less the games.” \nIf Hickey can secure another interception, he’ll be halfway to the program’s single-season record of eight — a mark set by linebacker Javicz Jones in 2012 — and the freshman doesn’t believe in setting low goals. \n“I put my expectations high,” he said. “If I can get three more picks on Saturday, that would be nice.” \nDon’t bet against it. \nNOTES: UMHB has won 59 consecutive regular-season games, a streak that dates to October of 2009. . . . Connolly Fuller, a 6-7, 315-pound offensive tackle, is back in the starting lineup for the Crusaders after missing two games because of injury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T12:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T01:58:24.970+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
