In that game, Coast Guard overcame a 14-0 deficit and came up with three interceptions in the fourth quarter — two by Behne — to remain unbeaten in the NEFC. Behne also had a career-high 14 tackles to earn the prestigious Gold Helmet award. ... The Bears continue to get a solid contribution from Victory at quarterback. The junior, who will make his 23rd consecutive start, set the CGA career-passing yards record in the win over Maine Maritime. He has 4,686, breaking the mark of 4,569 set by by Jon Resch (2009-12) ... Henning also set a career record for career extra points (89) with three in that game, eclipsing the old record of 87 by David Lieberman (2004-07). Henning is also just two shy of the school record for field goals (28) currently held by Jacob Shackleford (2008-11).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:10:14.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
