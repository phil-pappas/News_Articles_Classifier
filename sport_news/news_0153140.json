By JARED GREENLEAF sports@cheboygantribune.com CHEBOYGAN — When it’s homecoming week, it’s easy to get distracted, and it’s especially difficult for coaches to keep their players focused on the task at hand. For Cheboygan volleyball coach Laura Urlaub, she was hoping her team would would remain focused and come out with a solid showing against non-conference opponent Boyne City. And even after losing the first set, the Cheboygan players would not let their coach down the rest of the way. Thanks to another solid team effort, the Chiefs rebounded emphatically, winning the next three sets and claiming a 3-1 win over Boyne City (21-25, 25-19, 25-8, 25-22) during a non-conference contest on Thursday night. “They did bounce back,” said Urlaub, whose squad improved to 22-6-2 on the season “Even in the second set, how aggressive they were to hold them (Boyne City) under 10 was pretty good. I thought Boyne played pretty well, we got a lot of free balls from them, but the free balls they sent over were pretty aggressive free balls. That’s one of things we’ve been working on, too, is trying to capitalize on free balls when we are given them, and getting kills off of them.” Following the loss in the opener, the Chiefs — behind the powerful hitting of seniors Katie Swiderek (16 kills) and Brooke Beaubien (15 kills), as well as the serving from fellow senior Allie Porteous (six aces) — cruised to victory in each of the next two sets, taking a 2-1 lead in the match. “Katie (Swiderek) was swinging fantastically today, being very aggressive,” Urlaub added. “As a matter of fact, the last couple of games I’ve seen Katie hitting more than tipping, and that’s what I’d like to see from her, and I thought she did a great job tonight. She was very effective. “Brooke’s a very smart player that can come in aggressively and tip to get kills, so it doesn’t matter if it’s a hard hit, a kill is a kill. She made some smart plays for us tonight. “Allie has been serving very aggressive, and I’ve been trying to get her to serve aggressively, and then back off to her serving a little bit lighter, to not only keeping it in play but the make the other opposing players move forward and give them a hard one to back them up, push them back further.” However, the Ramblers gave Cheboygan all it could handle in the fourth, even taking a 20-18 lead at one point. With two of their three points coming off kills from Swiderek and Beaubien, the Chiefs retook the lead at 21-20, but the teams would then trade points until the set was tied at 22. From there, Beaubien delivered back-to-back kills, while a receiving error by the Ramblers gave Cheboygan the victory. Page 2 of 2 - Urlaub was pleased with her team’s winning performance in the end — even if there might have been a slight distraction with it being homecoming week. “Three of them (Swiderek, Porteous, Danielle Boyd) are on the homecoming court, so it’s definitely not easy,” Urlaub said. “The excitement of tomorrow and everything, yeah, it’s hard, but I thought they played well and stayed focused. “It was an important win for us tonight, and it was great to see them bounce back the way they did.” After tying the match with a six-point win in set two, the Chiefs played brilliantly in the third, opening up a 14-5 lead. The Chiefs then increased the lead up to 24-8 after an ace by sophomore Leah Charboneau (two aces), while a Boyne City serving error two rallies later gave the Chiefs the set. Beaubien and Swiderek both finished with 20 and 13 digs respectively, while Porteous tallied five kills and 11 digs. Sophomore Aleah Holmes (37 assists) and sophomore Autumn Tallman (five digs) also had strong nights for the Chiefs. With no invitational this weekend, Cheboygan’s next matchup will be a Straits Area Conference showdown with Sault Ste. Marie this Tuesday. “We’ve played them once and lost to them, so it’s going to be a key matchup,” Urlaub said of the Sault match. “Right now, we’re undefeated in conference, but it’s going to be a fight. The Sault has said that we’re their nemesis. I haven’t told the girls that yet, but it’ll be interesting to see if Cecelia (Werner) is back for the Sault, because she sprained her ankle at the St. Ignace tournament. We’ll see if she’s back and if it’ll impact them. “They do have a strong team, and I think they’re beatable, but we’ve gotta be on our game, too.” Cheboygan’s junior varsity volleyball team also claimed a victory over Boyne City on Thursday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T07:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:29:22.599+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
