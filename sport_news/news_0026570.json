Our poverty rate is 20.4 percent compared to the national rate of 15.4 percent. Almost 800,000 of the state’s 2 million people receive Medicaid benefits. And in the 2015 budget year, more than 493,000 New Mexicans received food assistance.\nIn addition, the state’s unemployment rate among youths age 14-26 was 23.7 percent in 2014, the eighth-highest among states, according to state Workforce Solutions Secretary Celina Bussey. The national average was 19.5 percent.\nOther than in the tech, education and health care sectors, jobs in New Mexico tend to be lower paying ones that require low skill levels. The average hourly wage in Albuquerque is $20.92, 8 percent below the national average.\nJournal UpFront columnist Winthrop Quigley recently pointed out that one reason New Mexico has a hard time attracting high paying jobs is that business and industry don’t think our workers have the skills they need.\nBut there is hope. Armed with $13.6 million in federal dollars, Workforce Solutions plans to train and educate New Mexico youths so they are better prepared for more challenging and better paying jobs.\nIn other words, to intervene before they succumb to a lifetime of low pay or minimum wage work.\nThe program will be a valuable safety net if the state Human Services Department follows through on its proposal to reinstitute the federal work requirements for some able-bodied recipients of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits.\nHaving an educated and trained workforce is a critical component of New Mexico’s economy. Targeting this age demographic as young people prepare to set a career path is the right thing to do.\nThis editorial first appeared in the Albuquerque Journal.
