They followed up a second placing in the first leg in Portsmouth with victory in Gothenburg in August to give them the overall advantage heading into the final regatta of the year in Bermuda this weekend. \nBurling also dominated the Moth World Championships earlier this year to comfortably take out the title, with Tuke following in sixth. \nThe ISAF World Sailor Awards were launched in 1994, and just five other New Zealanders feature in the previous winners list. They include Jo Aleh and Polly Powrie in 2013 (New Zealand's first ever winners in the women's category), Sir Russell Coutts, who has won ISAF Male Sailor of the Year twice, in 1995 and 2003, Mike Sanderson in 2006 and Sir Peter Blake in 1994. \nThe 2015 winners will be announced at an awards ceremony on November 10 in Sanya, China. \n* The New Zealand crews made a slow start to the 470 world championships in Haifa, Israel yesterday. Olympic champions Aleh and Powrie were placed seventh heading into day two after following up their second placing in race one with a poor 17th place finish in the second race. In the men's fleet, Paul Snow-Hansen and Daniel Willcox are 15th. \nISAF World Sailor of the Year nominations: \nMen: Peter Burling & Blair Tuke (NZL); Loick Peyron (FRA); Giles Scott (GBR); Ian Walker (GBR); Ian Williams (GBR). \nWomen: Sarah Ayton (GBR); Sam Davies (GBR); Elena Kalinina (RUS); Lotte Meldgaard Pedersen (DEN); Charline Picon (FRA).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T19:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:53:17.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
