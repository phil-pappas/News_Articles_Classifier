Related Ohio State to start Barrett over... \nGeneral Manager Jarmo Kekalainen said Tortorella signed a three-year contract through the 2017-18 season and will make his Blue Jackets debut on Thursday night when Columbus visits the Minnesota Wild. \n\"After much deliberation and discussion, we have made the very difficult decision late last night to remove Todd Richards as our head coach and we've reached an agreement with John Tortorella to join the Columbus Blue Jackets in that capacity,\" Kekalainen said in a statement. \n\"None of us saw our season unfolding the way it has and every one of us from management to coaches to players bears responsibility. There is still a lot of hockey to be played and we believe this change was necessary to give our team the best chance to accomplish the goals we've set for this season.\" \nThe Blue Jackets, who lost 4-0 at home to the New York Islanders on Tuesday night, plan to retain assistant coaches Craig Hartsburg and Brad Larsen, according to TSN. \nRichards, 49, was 127-112-21 with the Blue Jackets after taking over midway through the 2011-12 season. He has a career coaching record of 204-183-37 with the Minnesota Wild and Blue Jackets. After making the playoffs in the 2013-14 season for the second time in franchise history, the Blue Jackets fell to 11th in the conference last season. \nTortorella, 57, last coached in the NHL with the Vancouver Canucks in the 2013-14 season. The Canucks, who fired him after missing the Stanley Cup playoffs, will receive a third-round draft pick from the Blue Jackets as compensation since Tortorella remained under contract there. \nTortorella has compiled a 446-375-115 record (.538) in 936 games during his NHL coaching career with the Tampa Bay Lightning, New York Rangers and Canucks. His teams have qualified for the Stanley Cup playoffs eight times and he led the Lightning to the 2004 Stanley Cup championship and the Rangers to the 2012 Eastern Conference Final. \nTortorella leads American-born coaches with 446 wins. He is set to coach Team USA at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. \n\"John Tortorella is an experienced National Hockey League coach with a proven track record of success,\" Kekalainen said. \"He is a Stanley Cup winner and we believe the right person to lead our team at this time.\" Distributed by LAKANA and The Sports Xchange.
