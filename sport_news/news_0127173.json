Chuck Dailey’s response was perfect, too. The East Stroudsburg North football coach was asked what has made Stroudsburg’s football program so good the last four years. And right on cue, Dailey laughed and said matter-of-factly, “a lot of talent helps.” The Mounties have been the team to beat the last four years, and last year’s 10-1 record and Eastern Pennsylvania Conference North Division title, has been followed up in 2015 by a 3-1 start. Stroudsburg’s only setback was a 49-47 loss to Nazareth on opening night. Dailey’s team was in the path of Stroudsburg’s runaway train a year ago, falling 48-14. The Mounties ran and passed their way to 553 yards in that game, a memory Dailey hasn’t erased heading into Friday night's 6 p.m. game. “They’re very good at what they do,” Dailey said. “We didn’t play well against them last year. We did play well against their run game, but our secondary stunk. They ran by us.” The Mounties have a pretty good passing attack this year as well, led by quarterback Jake Jakobsen, who threw for 275 yards a week ago in a 54-13 victory over Dieruff. Marcello Riccardi has stepped up as Jakobsen’s favorite target. Stroudsburg’s run game has been pretty good, too. Junior back Jamaal Brome is the runaway leader in rushing yards, bolting for 124 and three touchdowns a week ago. “He’s deceivingly powerful and his balance and vision make him really good,” Dailey said. After an 0-2 start which included a frustrating 18-14 loss to the Huskies, North has rallied for a pair of wins over Allen (45-13) and Pocono East (39-13). Quarterback Thomas Melchiorre and the offense shined in each of those victories. Dailey said Melchiorre was, “a tremendous kid, a product of what we’re doing.” “Big plays we’re getting is because the guy blocking downfield and at the point of attack that’s making that occur,” Dailey said. The pick – Expect a high-scoring game, but North’s offense won’t keep pace tonight. Mounties 47-20. Here’s a look at the rest of tonight’s games. ES South (1-3) at Easton (3-1), 7 p.m. The Red Rovers suffered the surprising setback of the week when it fell to Allentown Central Catholic 26-24. Senior running back Nysir Minney-Gratz leads the team with 157 yards per game average and six touchdowns. Jared Alphonso and Jarrad Pope continue to share the workload in the East Stroudsburg backfield. The pick – Easton too good on this night. Red Rovers, 28-12. PM West (0-4) at Pleasant Valley (1-3), 7 p.m. West quarterback Dylan Della Valle has been enjoying a nice season for the Panthers, throwing for 195 yards and two touchdowns in a 63-20 loss to Parkland a week ago. PV senior Austyn Borre has been the best dual-threat running back in the area, running for 229 yards and receiving 178 yards. The pick – Panthers will wait one more week for their first victory. Bears, 35-19. PM East (1-3) at Allen (0-4), 6 p.m. The Cardinals suffered a big setback a week ago when starting quarterback Joel Wittel suffered a broken arm. Jacob Keane had some snaps under his belt, which is a good thing for Pocono East. Angel Aguila got the majority of the carries last week for winless Allen. He ran for 97 yards and a touchdown in a loss to Pleasant Valley. The pick – The Cardinals have better balance, but the defense should be wary of Aguila. PM East 21-13.
