I just thought, 'okay, well if I hit the wrong ball, no big deal, Zach will cover me this hole. I pick up, put the right ball in play the next hole'.\n\"But obviously that was not what happened.\"\nThe 45-year-old, who needed a captain's pick to make the Presidents Cup this year after an average season, was reluctant to blame anyone but himself for the infraction, which put the Americans on the back foot.\nThey fought back valiantly, however, to halve the match.\n\"It's the job of the player to know the rules, and it's not the committee's fault,\" he said.\n\"I know they made a mistake and it's disappointing, but they should not have been put in that situation. It wasn't a hard thing to just play the same ball throughout the round.\"\nMark Russell, Vice President of Rules and Competition for the PGA Tour, told reporters it had be a \"strange situation\" to deal with and shouldered the blame for making an incorrect call on Mickelson's disqualification.\n\"I accept total responsibility for that mistake,\" he said.\nMickelson, who has recaptured his best form in South Korea in the 11th edition of the Presidents Cup, took a swipe at his International opponents for failing to drive home their advantage.\n\"I feel like we spotted the Internationals' best team two holes and they still couldn't beat us,\" he quipped. \"Just saying.\"\n(Editing by Ed Osmond )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:27:17.132+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
