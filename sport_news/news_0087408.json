He was ranked as the No. 1 overall center in his class by both Rivals and Scout. Scout listed him as the No. 3 overall player in the class of 2015, while Rivals listed him at No. 4. Labissiere poured in 11 points and pulled down 12 rebounds in 19 minutes of action in the Jordan Brand Classic game to highlight his prep career. \nLabissiere joins Vanderbilt’s Damian Jones as the only players from the Southeastern Conference to earn recognition to the preseason watch list. \nAll of the preseason watch lists will be narrowed down to 10 in mid-February and then five finalists will be selected in March. The winners of the awards will be presented at the second annual ESPN College Basketball Awards Show in Los Angeles on April 8.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T07:46:32.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
