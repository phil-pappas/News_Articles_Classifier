Mike Rouches, a Hillsboro Police spokesman. They were being served in connection with a meth investigation, he said.\nVery few details have been released so far about the operation.\nAt least one search warrant was served in Hillsboro. The investigation involves both the Drug Enforcement Administration and Washington County's Westside Interagency Narcotics Team, Rouches said.\nThe Washington County drug team was the lead agency on the case, but worked with several law enforcement agencies to serve the warrants Thursday, said Sgt. Bob Ray, a sheriff's office spokesman. Investigators are finishing up their searches, interviews and evidence gathering Thursday afternoon.\nArrests were made, Ray said, but he didn't know how many.\nThis story will be updated as more information becomes available.\n-- Rebecca Woolington\nrwoolington@oregonian.com\n503-294-4049; @rwoolington", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/rwoolington"], "published": "2015-10-15T19:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:24:47.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
