Theo Walcott again leads the attack. 31 min 16:03 \nTEAM NEWS - Watford: Ikechi Anya, Valon Behrami and Allan Nyom all sat out the international break to recover from their injuries but this evening's game is likely to come too soon for them. They join Jose Manuel Jurado, Joel Ekstrand and Tommie Hoban on the absentee list. \nTEAM NEWS - Arsenal: Despite a niggling injury, Alexis Sanchez featured twice for Chile during the international break. The hip problem suffered in the 3-0 win over Manchester United could rule him out of tonight's game, with both he and Laurent Koscielny facing late fitness tests. The centre half has not played since the 3-2 Champions League defeat to Olympiakos. \nWenger told a press conference on Thursday: \"The only thing today is Koscielny has a definite test to see if he is available or not. I am not [comfortable that Sanchez played against Brazil and Peru] but there is not a lot I can do about it. He came off as you saw against Manchester United with a hip problem, a rotator muscle, and he wants to go. \n\"I have to check him. he played in the last two games, we have to see when he comes back but of course it is always a tricky situation that. They play official qualifiers of the World Cup and he is an important player for them and you know that they will use him if he can. He is a guy who wants always to play so I knew that it cold be a tricky situation for us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T18:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T18:50:07.828+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
