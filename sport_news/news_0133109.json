(Peter Casolino / Hartford Courant) Alec Bloom blossoms vs. UCF. \nSTORRS — Alec Bloom had a chance to make a few plays at Missouri but it didn't happen. \nHe dropped some passes, perhaps easier catches than the ones he made Saturday at Central Florida. \n\"I just didn't come up with those plays at Missouri and I was down a little bit, but you never stay down. You have to rise to the occasion every week,\" Bloom, a 257-pound sophomore, said. \"Having a guy like Tommy Myers there ... he's a year older than me, he's really encouraging, and he kind of helped me get back to where I wanted to play at. And both of us are performing well right now, which is good.\" \nLeague play is in, well, full bloom, and UConn is 1-1 in the American after its 40-13 win over the Knights Saturday at Bright House Networks Stadium. Bloom and the 6-5 sophomore Myers should be integral parts of the offense moving forward. Behind those two are 6-7 freshman Chris Lee, who played some in the blowout win over UCF. \nIf one of them doesn't hurt you, and 6-5 freshman Zordan Holman likely will fall into this category eventually, the other one will, somehow. That's the idea because they all can block and they all can catch. Toughness is a characteristic of the tight end position and they all have that, too. (DESMOND CONNER) \nUConn (3-3, 1-1) is going to host a tough South Florida team (0-1, 2-3) Saturday in its Homecoming game at Rentschler Field (noon, ESPNU). \nBloom, who had four receptions for 67 yards against UCF, caught one for 18 yards in traffic. He got crunched, his helmet went flying, but he held onto the ball. On the next play junior receiver Noel Thomas hauled in a 16-yard touchdown reception. \n\"Sometimes you cross the middle as a tight end, you have to expect that,\" said Bloom, who has 10 catches for 149 yards on the season. \"You've got to get your pads down, but the helmet flew off which was a little exaggeration. It didn't hurt.\" (DESMOND CONNER) \nHe bounced up pretty quickly. \nMyers (10 catches, 49 yards) is probably the most versatile of the group in that you could see him line up in the backfield at times. Lee saw his most extended action last week, on the field for 10 to 15 plays. \n\"It starts with me and Tommy, but the younger players are really doing well and Chris went out and had some good plays,\" Bloom said. \"It's exciting to see the young guys coming along.\" \nSpecial Team Aces \nBrice McAllister and Ellis Marder have been making their presence felt on special teams. \nMarder, a junior, recovered a fumbled punt that led to a touchdown. McAllister, a sophomore, was very active on kickoff and punt coverage teams. \n\"I take a lot of pride in it and doing whatever I can to help the team win,\" said McAllister, who is from East Longmeadow, Mass., and played at Suffield Academy. \"Especially last week, every week really, I watch a lot of film. I watch who is blocking me. It's about getting in the film room and seeing what players' tendencies are.\" \nMcAllister is a quick, 5-foot-11, 193-pound cornerback, so his knack to hit is embedded, but he's been taking it to another level lately. \n\"I'm just trying to help the team win,\" McAllister said. \"It's cool to hear your name called when you make a tackle. One of my friends, he's a defensive tackle at Clemson. He's like 'Brice, all you do is play special teams' I said 'Yeah, I make plays on special teams.' It's fun to get out there and make plays and help your team.\" \nThat's Marder's motivation, too. He made his big play in front of a hometown crowd. Marder is from Windermere, Fla. \n\"I just get out on the field and try to make the most out of all my opportunities,\" said Marder, also a 6-1, 199-pound strong safety who spells Andrew Adams. \"I give it all I got. I put in all the effort and it pays off, and the coaches see that and I get on the field.\" \nOnly One Man To Beat ... \nWhen asked about the 71-yard kickoff return to start the third quarter Arkeel Newsome, threw his head back and looked into the sky. \n\"Ahhh,\" he said. \"That hurt ... that hurt.\" \nNewsome, streaking in front of the UConn sideline, had one man to beat for a touchdown, but Tre Neal caught Newsome at the UCF 29. \n\"He had the angle, I think I had a little more juice in me,\" Newsome said. \"I don't know what happened, but that won't happen again.\" \nNewsome had 106 yards on three returns and was named the American Conference' special teams' player of the week. He had 257 all-purpose yards and two rushing touchdown, giving him three on the ground and two in the air this season. \nVechery's Indoctrination \nBrendan Vechery, elevated from preferred walk-on to a full scholarship player in January, had somewhat of a rough indoctrination this season, moving to center in place of Ryan Crozier (leg), who was lost for the season over the summer. He had issues with high snaps out of the shotgun and just regular duties being inexperienced. but the 6-6, 302-pound sophomore has settled down and played solid ball. \n\"Each game I've been gaining experience, learning what I'm doing right and wrong and it's been good for me,\" Vechery said. \"I've been watching a lot of film, just trying to get better every week. This is my first year playing center in a while, so as I keep working a few things will become routine for me.\"…UConn kicker Bobby Puyol (7 for 7) shares the national lead with 12 other kickers in the FBS who are perfect on field goals this season. Only three, Ross Martin of Duke (12), Aidan Schneider of Oregon (9) and Austin Seibert from Oklahoma (8), have made more. ... havon Williams is tied for 15th in the nation in interceptions with three. Andrew Adams is tied for 38th with two.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T18:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T19:31:38.531+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
