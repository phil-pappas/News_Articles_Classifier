(Photo by Jared Wickerham/Getty Images) United States women's national team goalkeeper Hope Solo will again face domestic violence charges after a Washington state appeals court reversed the January dismissal of a case against her.\nSolo, who was named the top goalkeeper at the Women's World Cup this past summer, faced two counts of domestic violence after a June 2014 incident in which she was accused of striking her half-sister and then-17-year-old nephew.\nAdChoices The case was dismissed on procedural grounds in January, but a document filed Friday to the state court's website confirmed the reversal of that decision, as reported by ESPN. A timetable for a new trial has not been announced.\n\"The court reverses the decision of the lower court and remands the case to Kirkland (Wash.) Municipal Court,\" the appeals court said in documents made available to public on Friday.\nSolo's attorney has said she acted in self defense after her nephew -- who stood at 6-foot-9 and 280 pounds -- hit her with a broomstick. The police report at the time said Solo \"appeared intoxicated and upset,\" and an article from ESPN earlier this year said she also was abusive to police who responded to the scene.\nThe 34-year-old logged every minute for the Americans as they won their third World Cup crown this summer. Asked before the tournament about her ongoing legal concerns, she said: \"What I can tell is that I'm in the best place in my life, both on the field and off the field.\"\nSolo started in goal as her Seattle Reign lost 1-0 to FC Kansas City in the National Women's Soccer League championship game Thursday night.\n“We are shocked and disappointed by the judge’s ruling this morning,\" Solo’s attorney, Todd Maybrown, said in statement. \"However, we maintain our position that the charges in this case should have never been filed, that the original trial court’s dismissal of the case was correct, and we plan to file an appeal of today’s decision with the Court of Appeals.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:38:47.607+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
