(Photo: Robert Mayer/USA TODAY Sports) \nVOORHEES Physically, Steve Mason was standing between the pipes last Saturday night, the last time he saw action in a game. \nMentally, he was far from Sunrise, Fla., where the Flyers lost 7-1 and he allowed four goals in 6:46. His mind was on other things. \n“I didn’t handle Saturday very well, didn’t play well,” said Mason, who left the team after Sunday’s practice for a family medical emergency that began last weekend. “I don’t want to get into details on it, but I definitely didn’t handle myself well enough to play well for the team.” \nThe goalie returned Friday, taking part in a full practice for the first time since last Sunday. He was in his regular starter’s net and looked sharp through drills. \n“It’s good to see him around the guys,” said R.J. Umberger, who was also a teammate in Columbus with Mason. “The things that’s going on with him in his personal life, to be around the group is a way that you can relieve that. When you’re at the rink you can just be a kid and play hockey and people aren’t going to know the full details of what’s going on with him, but we have a group of guys here, a team that’s supporting him. He’s one of our brothers.” \nIn Mason’s absence, Michal Neuvirth has been nearly perfect. He allowed three goals in relief of Mason last Saturday, but hasn’t allowed one to get by him in a game since. He’s riding a shutout streak of 132:05. \n“Excellent,” Mason said. “Watching both games, he looked confident out there. At the end of the day, he did his job and that’s all you can ask of him. He steps in, especially in the first game, not really finding out he was playing until short notice and he did everything you could have asked for him. He did great.” \nThe Flyers are in the midst of a five-day layoff between games, probably enough time for Neuvirth to cool off. Coach Dave Hakstol has an interesting decision to make as to who will start off in the first of back-to-back games against the Dallas Stars Tuesday and Boston Bruins Wednesday. \n“I don’t think it’s really changed for us,” Hakstol said. “We knew Michal was a good goaltender. He came in and he did a great job for us. We’ll now approach it going into practice Sunday, Monday and make our decision for who’s gonna start on Tuesday. I don’t think it changes our situation at all. I think Michal did a great job for us.” \nGetting Mason back in net immediately may be good for Mason’s confidence, especially putting him into a situation where he can get back to focusing on hockey after taking a few days away from the team. \n“There was definitely a mental hurdle that needed to be overcome,” Mason said. “It just takes time. That’s why I took the time to come out to the morning skate, just to be around the guys and also just to start working back at hockey and doing things that you love to do. Things will come with hard work, too.” \nGoing back to work, being with his teammates, is helpful for Mason and he knows his teammates are there to support him. \n“Mase is our backbone there,” Wayne Simmonds said. “He’s going through a lot right now and we’re just trying to support him. This is a family here and all the guys on the team know if you’re having problems or anything you can come to any one of us and get that support. We’ll be ready. When Mase is ready to play again, we’re all here and we’ve got his back, 100 percent.” Umberger nearing return \nBefore the Flyers began practice, Umberger was skating with assistant coach Ian Laperriere. He has missed the last two games with an upper-body injury, but is hoping to fully participate in Sunday’s practice and play Tuesday. \n“I’m feeling good,” Umberger said. “That’s a good step. It’s up to the trainers to make a decision.” \nIn two games, Umberger had a pair of assists on a line with Scott Laughton and Matt Read. Loose pucks \nThe Flyers will take off Saturday and practice both Sunday and Monday before playing the Stars Tuesday. … Vinny Lecavalier and Luke Schenn both skated in practice as extra players. \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com .
