A total, 48-minute domination of Hollister resulted in a 35-0 Eagle win and the sixth win of the season, guaranteeing the team's first winning season since 2011 and the senior class's first ever.\"Our seniors kept battling back,\" said Fair Grove head coach Bill Voorhis. \"We had a tough week of practice, and for those guys to see the reward and know that, put in the time and the effort, you'll get the reward, was huge. I'm just so proud of those guys.\" CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS Junior quarterback Brayden Lumley got the scoring started in the first. On a quarterback keeper near midfield, Lumley took the ball up the middle, squirted through the pile, and ran for the 52-yard score.\"My O-line did a great job,\" Lumley said. \"They made a huge block, and the rest was just-- even my receivers were blocking well.\" After a somewhat sluggish first quarter, the Eagles erupted for 21 points in the second, but it was a defensive play that turned the tide for good. With the score 7-0, Hollister had the ball on the Eagle one on fourth down. The Fair Grove defense stood up the ballcarrier, forced a turnover, and turned it into points when Austin Fodge plunged in from a yard out on the ensuing drive.\"After that goal line stand there in the first half, and then turning that into a 99-yard touchdown drive the other way, that was the momentum,\" Voorhis said. \"That was when I felt like, ok, we're going to be all right.\" Lumley threw for two more scores, one to Dalton Cloyd and another to Evan Fullerton just before halftime to make it 28-0 at the break. Cloyd ran for the final score in the third quarter to bring the score to its final. The win improves Fair Grove to 6-3 on the year, and keeps hope alive for a second seed out of Class 2, District 3. They trailed Diamond by a game going into play on Friday. Voorhis said once the coaches knew who they'd be playing, they would start breaking down film and go over the tape with the team on Saturday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T09:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:30:32.063+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
