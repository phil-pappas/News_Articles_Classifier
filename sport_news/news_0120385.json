(Jae C. Hong / Associated Press) \nWhen will Kobe Bryant play again? \nThat is the question Lakers Coach Byron Scott has had to mull over the last few days. \nScott said Bryant \"probably won't play\" Monday night and that there is \"a chance\" the guard could be shut down for the rest of the exhibition season. \nBecause Bryant still has \"a little soreness\" from a bruised knee, which prevented him from practicing Sunday, Scott is being cautious. \nScott said he'll make a final decision after the Lakers' shootaround Monday before deciding whether Bryant will play that night in an exhibition game against the Portland Trail Blazers at Staples Center. \n\"I'm saying questionable, but to be honest, he probably won't play,\" Scott said. \"I'd rather get him closer to 100% as possible. These games don't mean anything right now. It's really giving me a chance to look at some of these young guys anyway.\" \nBryant, who was injured Tuesday night, didn't play Saturday night against the Golden State Warriors and hasn't participated in the last three practices. \nWith only two exhibition games left before the Lakers open the regular season Oct. 28 against the Minnesota Timberwolves at home, Scott said he might keep Bryant out and wait to play him when the games count. \n\"There's a chance, but I'm not going to put a percentage on it,\" Scott said. \"But there's a chance.\" \nScott said there wasn't any concern \"whatsoever\" about Bryant sitting out the regular-season opener. \nScott said he needs to see Bryant run and not just jog like he has in the last few practices. \nBut Scott said he has seen improvement in Bryant. \n\"He did the same as he did two days ago, but he felt better today,\" Scott said. \"So that's obviously a good sign.\" \nScott also said Bryant did some shooting Sunday and is trying to maintain his conditioning that way. \n\"When him and I talked today, his only minor concern was getting his running in,\" Scott said. \"He worked too hard this summer to sit down for a week or two as far as conditioning goes. So that was the only thing he was really kind of thinking about.\" \nEtc. \nScott said reserve guard Lou Williams , who didn't play Saturday night because of a groin injury, is listed as probable for Monday's game.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T07:45:00.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
