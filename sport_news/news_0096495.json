He drove the lane hard, getting a defender to bite on a pump-fake before finding a wide-open Biggs for an easy layup.\n\"Kadeem has really taken on that role (of leader); he's working harder than ever, and he's communicating,\" said JFK coach Johnny Mathis. \"He's starting to get it. He's starting to see that he needs to get everyone involved for us to win games.\"\nSo far this season, the Knights have won plenty. They're 8-0 in Bronx 'AA' (12-1 overall) and sit atop the divisional standings, which has dominated recently by Wings, winners of three consecutive borough championships and PSAL semifinalists the past two years.\nNow, Nicholas is the one piloting the Knights' flight.\n\"Coach really pushed me. He was always reminding me that I have to be more vocal,\" Nicholas said. \"I got to show them the way. As long as we get the win, I don't care what kind of numbers I put up.\"\nNicholas' numbers are down slightly from last year, when he averaged 20 points per game and led the division in scoring, but the 6-2 shooting guard is still turning heads. He's averaging 18.6 points and finished Thursday's game against Wings with 17 points, 11 rebounds, eight assists and five steals.\nAs Nicholas focuses on leadership and getting others involved, the Knights are sharpening their focus on the postseason, hoping to take the next step. Last year, they finished second in Bronx 'AA' at 11-4 and fell to Wings in the borough championship before advancing to the city quarterfinals.\n\"That loss in the playoffs really stung,\" assistant coach Star Jones said of being clipped by Wings. \"Every time we played them, that was in the back of our mind. Wins like this really show that we're for real.\"\nWings, which graduated last year's entire starting lineup, also lost to Kennedy, 67-64, in the season opener on Nov. 27. Nicholas led the Knights with a game-high 25 points. Wings is 3-2 in the division.\nThe Knights now hold the edge in experience and the divisional standings, but Nicholas says they won't be happy with just a regular-season or borough title.\n\"Our only goal is to win a (city) championship, finishing first in the Bronx doesn't mean nothing if we don't bring home that championship,\" he said. \"We have enough talent to do it, but we all need to be involved. As long as we keep playing as a team, just like we've been doing, we'll win it all.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:28:28.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
