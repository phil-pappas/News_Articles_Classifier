Valcke denied the charges. \nMeanwhile, International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach has waded into the FIFA crisis, suggesting the body look outside football for an “external candidate” to succeed Blatter. \nIn a strongly worded, rare intervention into the FIFA affair, Bach placed pressure on the troubled soccer organization saying that change was long overdue. \n“They must do two things immediately: they must accelerate and deepen the reform process in order to comply with accountability, transparency and all the principles of good governance,” he said. \n“They should also be open for a credible external presidential candidate of high integrity, to accomplish the necessary reforms and bring back stability and credibility to FIFA.” \nFIFA’s rules state that to be a candidate for president an individual must have been involved in the game actively for two of the past five years, as well as presenting nominations from five national associations. \nThose rules severely limit the opportunities for a candidate from outside soccer organizations. \nThe only way those rules could be changed is through reform of FIFA’s statutes, which can only be done at a FIFA congress. \nThe next congress is scheduled to be held on February 26, when the next president will also be elected. Nominations for the post close on October 26. \nBach said in his statement, however, that FIFA needs to do much more than just elect a new president. \n“Enough is enough. We hope that now, finally, everyone at FIFA has at last understood that they cannot continue to remain passive. They must act swiftly to regain credibility because you cannot forever dissociate the credibility of FIFA from the credibility of football. \n“FIFA must realize that this is now about more than just a list of candidates. This is also a structural problem and will not be solved simply by the election of a new president,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T00:37:12.677+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
