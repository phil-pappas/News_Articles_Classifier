The former Etowah High School star suffered a head injury last Sunday against Washington and is going through the NFL’s concussion protocol.Skrine said he needed to pass two more tests Friday before being officially cleared.“I do feel fine to play,” he said after practice.Skrine would play an important role in the Jets’ scheme against the Patriots, particularly defending tight end Rob Gronkowski and wide receivers Danny Amendola and Julian Edelman on short pass plays.“This is a big game, a division game,” Skrine said, “so just being able to come back if I get to come back, I want to help the team any way I can.”Backup running back Bilal Powell (ankle) has been ruled out. That could create an opportunity for Stevan Ridley, who could make his season debut after tearing two knee ligaments more than a year ago while with the Patriots.Ridley is currently on the physically unable to perform list, and coach Todd Bowles said the team would make a decision on him either later Friday or Saturday.“He’s not going to get tested until he gets hit, until he makes cuts, makes blocks and those kinds of things and gets in football shape,” Bowles said. “It’s just a matter of how we see him in the game plan and what we think he can and can’t do.”Safety Jaiquawn Jarrett is doubtful with a knee injury that sidelined him for the game against the Redskins.Starting right guard Willie Colon is questionable, also with a sore knee, but will play.Wide receivers Brandon Marshall (calf) and Eric Decker (knee) were limited Friday, but there was no concern about their availability. Fellow receiver Chris Owusu is expected to make his return after missing the last three games following arthroscopic knee surgery.Also listed as probable: quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick (right elbow), nose tackle Damon Harrison (finger), cornerback Marcus Williams (hamstring), safety Dion Bailey (elbow) and linebacker Quinton Coples (elbow).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T10:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T20:13:45.426+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
