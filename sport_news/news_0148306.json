Lane also has battled a nagging hamstring problem. \nAnd last Saturday, Kentayvus Hopkins left the game in the first half with a knee injury. \nThomas was three-time all-state performer for Elizabethtown High School and finished with more than 6,400 career yards. He was the MVP of the Tennessee East-West All-Star Game and he ranks in the Top 10 all-time among Tennessee high school players in several categories — rushing yards (ninth), rushing touchdowns (77, ninth), career touchdowns (79, 10th), consecutive 100-yard rushing games (17, fourth) and 100-yard rushing games (35, second). \nKicking it up \nThe Colonels came into training camp with three kickers competing for playing time. \nAnd through three games, all of them have been able to make contributions in different roles. \nSophomore Lucas Williams emerged as the starting placekicker and has been perfect so far. The Russell Springs native has hit all four of his field goal attempts and is 12-for-12 on extra point attempts. \nWilliams hit three fields last week against Austin Peay — 28, 37 and 42 yards. \nBen Deighton and Zack Burgy-Vanhoose have split the kickoff duties. \nDeighton has eight touchbacks on 11 kicks for an average of 64.5 Vanhoose has kicked off nine times and has an average of 60.1 yards.
