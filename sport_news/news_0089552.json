The Chargers’ stadium advisor Mark Fabiani has said that the team is planning on relocating.\nAdChoices Fabiani told The Mighty 1090 AM radio show that the Chargers will be filing to relocate their franchise to Los Angeles. He said the decision was made because there haven’t been signs of other teams doing the same.\n\"As you know, 25 percent of our season-ticket business comes from those markets,\" Fabiani said. \"So we have to be able to protect those markets. That’s why as a last resort we went out and created the certain option we now have in Los Angeles. And if everything is moving ahead, we’re not going to be standing on the sidelines and watching everything go by. We’ve got to stay in the game to protect the future of the franchise.”\nHowever the Chargers, the Oakland Raiders, and the St. Louis Rams are all expected to file relocation papers in January, according to The Los Angeles Times .\nThe league currently has two Los Angeles proposals. In February, the Chargers and the Raiders proposed building a $1.7 billion stadium in Carson. In January, the Rams unveiled plans to build a $1.86 billion, 80,000-seat stadium in Inglewood.\nL.A. hasn’t had an NFL team since the Rams and Raiders relocated to St. Louis and Oakland in 1995.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.mighty1090.com/episode/mark-fabiani-if-theres-a-solution-here-in-san-diego-its-gonna-have-to-come-from-the-citizens-initiative-process/", "http://gamedayr.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:36:38.081+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
