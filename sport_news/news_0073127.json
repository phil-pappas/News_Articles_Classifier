This week? That’s not quite the case. Yes, Fournette maintained the top spot in our Heisman Watch after the Tigers’ 45-24 victory over South Carolina . But big-time performances by TCU quarterback Trevone Boykin (against Kansas State) and Florida State running back Dalvin Cook (against Miami) reminded voters that legit candidates exist outside Baton Rouge.\nThe second half of the season will be telling for Fournette’s Heisman campaign. LSU has yet to face Florida , Alabama , Ole Miss and Texas A&M . Each one of those teams boasts an imposing defensive front, which means we’ll get a better idea of exactly how dominant Fournette is when it counts.\nWeek 6 Heisman Watch 1.
