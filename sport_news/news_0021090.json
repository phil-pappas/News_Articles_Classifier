(Photo: Dale G. Young / Detroit News) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE East Lansing â€” When Michigan State arrived at Michigan Stadium on Saturday afternoon, coach Mark Dantonio had his players take 10 seconds to think about what was about to happen when they took the field against their archrival.\nFew could have expected what would transpire hours later on the final play of the game when Jalen Watts-Jackson scooped up a fumbled punt and raced 38 yards for the winning touchdown with no time left on the clock, giving the Spartans a 27-23 victory.\nThe amount of time left on the clock at the start of the final play?\nTen seconds.\n\"I don't believe in coincidences,\" Dantonio said Sunday. \"But as we got on that bus and got off that bus to come to the game, I had our players sit there for 10 seconds and think about what could happen. I actually counted it out. It was ironic that those 10 seconds came back to us at the end of the game.\"\nThose 10 seconds were what stood between Michigan State and what was almost certainly the end of its dream to win the Big Ten and have an opportunity to play for a national championship.\nBut as they have done often in the past five-plus seasons, the Spartans found a way to get it done. Dantonio thanked God after the game and said there \"was surely something else to it besides physical.\"\nMaybe it was divine intervention. Maybe it was coincidence.\nDETROIT NEWS\nWojo: MSU and UM both trending upward\nWhat it was, for sure, was the latest example of the culture Dantonio has created at Michigan State since taking over in 2007.\n\"When you're in it and you feel it and you're around your players, you understand whether there is truly a belief in what you're trying to do or if it's just words,\" Dantonio said. \"And our players truly believe that they have a shot to win at every turn.\"\nIt was hard to share that belief when Michigan led 23-14 in the fourth quarter. But when Connor Cook hit Trevon Pendleton for a 74-yard pass and LJ Scott scored on the next play, hope was rekindled.\nHowever, it was dashed again when Michigan State came up empty on fourth down from the Michigan 45 with 1:47 to play. But the defense answered by forcing a punt, and when defensive end Shilique Calhoun walked off the field, he had a message for the punt team.\n\"I just told them to believe,\" he said.\nThe resulting play will be etched in Michigan State lore, and it all went back to that belief.\n\"I think our players understand that you stretch a little here, you play with a little bit more effort there, that great things can happen,\" Dantonio said. \"It doesn't mean that it will happen, but it definitely won't happen if you don't have the belief.\"\nKeeping that same mindset moving forward will be key for No. 7 Michigan State (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten) as it continues its march in the East Division and its potential showdown at No. 1 Ohio State on Nov. 21.\nAnd as well as Cook has played the past two weeks, there are other issues that need to be addressed. Health is still a problem up front and in the secondary while the special teams units, outside of the final play Saturday, have hampered the Spartans all year.\nAgainst Michigan, backup quarterback Tyler O'Connor was the primary punter ahead of Jake Hartbarger. Both got a shot, but neither excelled. And the coverage teams struggled, allowing Michigan's Jabrill Peppers to rack up 129 return yards for the game and consistently give the Wolverines good field position.\n\"That's the underlying thing,\" Dantonio said. \"We gave up too much position on special teams. That's a reoccurring situation that we need to correct, but we made up for it on the last play. Sort of a day-to-day type situation where we need to continue to clean it up, but our specialists need to continue to punt better, kick better, and that's the bottom line.\"\nMichigan State hosts Indiana on Saturday before getting a week off. A trip to Nebraska comes next followed by a visit from Maryland then the matchup with Ohio State.\nAvoiding an emotional letdown will be the focus this week.\n\"We sort of pride ourselves in being very good after a big game,\" Dantonio said. \"In our recent history we've played well after big games whether we've won or lost. Our players understand the opportunities in front of them and they also understand what could happen if we don't play well and what could happen if we don't prepare well.\"\nmcharboneau@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/mattcharboneau\n\nBy Matt Charboneau\nThe Detroit News\nWhat went right\nConnor Cook was the difference for Michigan State once again, throwing for 328 yards and a touchdown while avoiding any turnovers. His completion percentage (18-for-39, .461) wasn't outstanding, but Cook was fitting the ball in tight windows against tight coverage from the outstanding Michigan secondary. Aaron Burbridge was again Cook's favorite target, catching nine passes for 132 yard, while Macgarrett Kings Jr. had a 30-yard touchdown and the 74-yard pass to fullback Trevon Pendleton was one of the biggest plays in the game. The running game struggled overall, but LJ Scott scored two touchdowns for the third straight week. Defensively, Michigan State had its best game of the season, allowing only 230 yards and giving up just 62 on the ground. Michigan was only 4-for-15 on third downs while Michigan State recorded three more sacks, two coming from defensive end Shilique Calhoun. The Spartans defense also forced Michigan to settle for field goals three times and came up with a three-and-out on the final series to set up the winning play on the botched punt.\nWhat went wrong\nThe running game had a hard time the whole game, gaining just 58 yards for an average of 1.8 yards a carry. The Spartans used three running backs but none could find any traction running behind a banged-up offensive line. The biggest problem, however, continues to be special teams. Michigan State continued to use backup quarterback Tyler O'Connor has its primary punter with redshirt freshman Jake Hartbarger kicking just once. The coverage teams struggled as Michigan's Jabrill Pepper had 129 total return yards and routinely gave the Wolverines solid field position. Kicker Michael Geiger did not attempt a field goal, but his problems this season led to the decision for Michigan State to go for it on fourth down in the first quarter from the Michigan 28. It was the end of a 16-play drive that produced no points, something that was a far bigger indictment of the special teams than the offense. The special teams did redeem itself with the punt return to win the game, but its long-term issues are far from being fixed.\nKey developments\nThe secondary has had its issues all season, but the Spartans started a pair of true freshmen at safety against Michigan and Khari Willis and Grayson Miller responded by playing a solid game. The big plays were limited and the tandem kept most plays in front of them while doing a good job in run support. They were both also in on the punt at the end of the game that resulted in the winning touchdown. Sophomore Montae Nicholson was the nickelback against the Wolverines and might still factor into a larger role, but the fact Miller and Willis played so well in a big game give the defense confidence moving forward.\nMost telling quotes\nCoach Mark Dantonio: \"I think we kept bouncing back and never got the lead and then at the end of day I guess we stormed back with an 11-man block. We put all 11 up there and things happen. Football is a crazy, crazy game. I can't really explain it, but we just had a belief. There was a belief in what went down.\"\nLB Riley Bullough: \"It was crazy. I truly didn't know what happened. I looked back and we're going the other way. I'm like, 'What the heck?' Then we scored, the next thought was, 'Did he get in?' Then it was insane. One of the best feelings, literally, ever.\"\nDantonio: \"I'm gonna play a little pool when we get home. I'll have Paul Bunyan right in the middle of the table. We'll invite the team and the coaches over and then decompress.\"\nDB Demetrious Cox on injury to Jalen Watts-Jackson: \"I feel for him. He was in the mix with the freshmen to play. I feel for him. It was a sacrifice I'm sure if he had to go back he would make again.\"\nDB Grayson Miller: \"Khari is my best friend on this team. We've been saying all year, once we're both playing ... we knew our time would be coming. They told Khari and I we needed to step up, and I think we did that to the best of our ability. I felt good going into the game. I feel really great now.\"\nWhat's next\nComing off the emotional victory will be a challenge for the Spartans as they return home after two weeks on the road to face Indiana. With big games on the road still to be played â€“ at Nebraska and at Ohio State â€“ avoiding the urge to look ahead will be the biggest task over the next few weeks. After the Indiana game, Michigan State gets a much-needed bye as it could use a week to try and get some players back before traveling to face Nebraska.\n\n\nBig Ten standings \nEast Division \nTeam; Big Ten; Overall \nOhio State; 3-0; 7-0\nMichigan State; 3-0; 7-0\nPenn State; 2-1; 5-2\nMichigan; 2-1; 5-2\nRutgers; 1-2; 3-3\nMaryland; 0-2; 2-4\nIndiana; 0-3; 4-3\nWest Division \nTeam; Big Ten; Overall \nIowa; 3-0; 7-0\nWisconsin; 2-1; 5-2\nIllinois; 1-1; 4-2\nNorthwestern; 1-2; 5-2\nMinnesota; 1-2; 4-3\nNebraska; 1-2; 3-4\nPurdue; 0-3; 1-6\n\n\nIndiana at MSU \nKickoff: 3:30 p.m. Saturday, Spartan Stadium, East Lansing\nTV/radio: ABC/WJR\nLine: Michigan State by 16 1 / 2 \nRecords: Indiana 4-3, 0-3 Big Ten; No. 7 Michigan State 7-0, 3-0\nSeries: Michigan State leads 44-15-2 (Last â€” Oct. 18, 2014: MSU 56, (at) Indiana 14", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:17:54.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
