The Seawolves (2-3, 1-3 Colonial Athletic Association) scored a pair of first-quarter touchdowns to take a 14-0 lead, but Towson (3-3, 1-2) kept them out of the end zone the rest of the way. Max Tejada sacked Conor Bednarski and forced a fumble that Donnell Lewis recovered for the Tigers first touchdown in the second quarter, sending the teams into halftime at 14-7. Victor scored from the 3 with 5:23 remaining in the third quarter to tie the game at 14-14, then capped a nine-play, 80-yard drive with his second touchdown of the game to secure the victory. Victor finished with 17 carries for 73 yards to lead Towson, which limited Stony Brook to just 224 yards of offense and just 74 rushing yards on 44 carries.
