Phil Mickelson made a rookie mistake. All that really mattered Friday in the Presidents Cup was that the International team was back in business.\nBae made a dynamic debut at home in his first Presidents Cup by making a 12-foot birdie putt on the 18th hole to win a crucial fourballs match that helped the International team win a team session for the first time in four years and pull within one point of the U.S.\n\"That putt Sang-moon made on No. 18 today was probably the highlight of the last two days for us,\" International captain Nick Price said.\nBae and Danny Lee topped Rickie Fowler and Jimmy Walker, 1-up. Branden Grace and Louis Oosthuizen set the tone with a 4-and-3 win over Jordan Spieth and Justin Johnson, while Charl Schwartzel and Thongchai Jaidee won the anchor match, 2 and 1, over Bill Haas and Chris Kirk.\nThe International team picked a half-point in another match and cut the American lead to 5 1/2-4 1/2 going into the eight matches today. That half-point involved Mickelson, and it led to confusion and a pair of mistakes at the Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea. Mickelson and Zach Johnson were all square with Jason Day and Adam Scott through six holes when Mickelson switched to a firmer golf ball for a better chance of reaching the green in two on the par-5 seventh.\nPlayers have to use the same model of golf ball for the entire match. The penalty for a fourballs match is called a one-hole adjustment in the match.\nThe second mistake was from the rules committee. Mickelson was told he was disqualified from the hole, so he picked up his ball from the fairway. He should have been allowed to finish the hole because the one-hole adjustment was already in effect. Day won the hole with a birdie, so along with the adjustment, the International team went from all square to 2-up.\nBIRDIE RUN FOR JANG: South Korea’s Ha Na Jang used a late three-hole birdie run to take a one-stroke lead in the LPGA Malaysia at Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia) Golf and Country Club. She shot a bogey-free 6-under 65 to reach 10-under 132. China’s Xi Yu Lin was second after her 68.\nLANGER TAMES WIND: Bernhard Langer shot a 7-under 65 in windy conditions to take a two-stroke lead in the Champions Tour’s SAS Championship at Prestonwood CC in Cary, N.C.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:20:32.312+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
