So, this year is was Calli Linse’s turn. \nThe senior ran blew away the field, both figuratively and literally, covering the windy 5,000-meter UW-Whitewater course in 19:52.50 to become the program’s first female conference champion. \nLinse’s time was over 8 seconds better than runner-up and defending RVC champion Brooke Lonigro of Beloit Turner (20:07.83), and close to 30 seconds ahead of Brodhead/Juda’s Taylor Bluemel (20:23.05), the other meet favorite who finished a distant fourth. \n“I was a little surprised,” said Linse, of both her time and becoming Jefferson first-ever female conference champion. “Brooke and Taylor are outstanding runners; it’s been fun to compete with them all year — they both push me to my limits. I couldn’t race like that without them pushing me.” \nLinse grabbed the lead going up the hill on the second loop, about halfway through the race. \n“I just said, ‘It’s my last time running this hill — I thought about all the hills we ran this season — I just figured, it’s my time to go.” \n“Calli executed a flawless race tonight,” said Jefferson coach Megan Carstens. “She didn't get caught up with the fast pace of the early leaders; she remained confident in her abilities and her pace through the first mile. \n“Going into the second mile, I knew she was feeling good, as she quietly made her way to second place and got on the heals of the leader — she was originally planning to stay with the pack until the last half mile of the race — (but) when I saw her come out of the woods with 1,200 meters to go, I knew she was not going to back down. She hammered the last half mile and gaped the next runner by 100 meters. \nLinse finished fifth as a junior. \n“She is an incredible athlete, both physically and mentally,” said Carstens. \nA two-time WIAA State qualifier, Linse is looking to make it three straight years to Wisconsin Rapids. \n“It’s not over yet,” she added. \nMeanwhile, the Whitewater girls earned their second RVC title in three years scoring a meet-best 59 points. In what was an absolutely intense race, the Whitewater girls were able to edge out a fierce McFarland team by three points to secure the victory. \nJefferson finished third with 77 points, followed by Brodhead/Juda (93) and Palmyra-Eagle (131). \n\"These girls clawed their way to the finish line and it is was truly inspirational.,” said Whippets coach Chad Carstens. “From top to bottom these girls laid it on the line. We talk about not living with regret, and I don't believe they have any tonight.” \nProviding a 1-2 punch for the Whippets were sophomore Allisan Barrett and senior Sarah Ziolkowski in sixth (20:28.88) and seventh (20:48.76), respectively, to earn first-team all-conference honors with their Top 8 finishes. \nEarning second-team All-RVC honors (Top 16) were seniors Abby King (15th, 21:34.05) and Andrea Sandoval (16th, 21:35.33). \nRounding out the fifth scorer for the team was freshman Nicole Tomomitsu, who ran a 21:53.76 (19th place) to honorable mention all-conference honors. \nCalli Linse wasn’t the only Linse to earn first-team All-RVC laurels as her sister, freshman Mariah, placed fifth in her first-ever RVC Meet. Mariah Linse’s time was 20:27.40. \n“Mariah competed fearlessly tonight. She is wise beyond her years when it comes to racing; she was so patient, and continually moved up throughout the race,” said Megan Carstens. \nAlso earning all-conference honors for the Lady Eagles Thursday were sophomore Jessica Jurcek (22nd, 22:03.39), and seniors Courtney Nash (24th, 22:04.61) and Makayla Kawleski (23:05.46). \nMiller settled for runner-up honors after running a 17:29.08 on the UW-W course, finishing second behind McFarland junior Christopher Pahnke who blew the field away with a 16:47.4 performance. \nMcFarland ran away with the team title as well, earning 28 points, well ahead of second-place Jefferson (82) and third-place Whitewater (105). \n“Our boys gave it their all, but McFarland's boys’ team is unstoppable right now,” said Megan Carstens. \nMiller finished ahead of Whitewater’s Brodie Runez (3rd, 17:30.06). \n“He has fought through so much adversity over the past six months, that for him to finish second at the conference meet is unbelievable,” said Carstens of Miller, who missed the first half of the season with a stress fracture. “I still feel that his strongest races are ahead of him.” \nMiller earned first-team All-RVC honors with his Top 8 performance. \nCollecting second-team honors were JHS’ seniors Jesse Paucek and Alex Anason. Paucek finished 10th in 18:01.68, while Anason was right on his heels in 11th crossing the finish line in 18:15.63. \nFreshman Alex Marin finished 24th (19:10.11) while sophomore Jaden Gallardo placed 35th (19:57.18). \n“Alex Marin stepped up big tonight as our fourth runner earning all-conference honors as just a freshman, and I was so proud of Jaden Gallardo tonight, as he moved up to our fifth runner tonight,” said Megan Carstens. \nAs mentioned, Runez led the Whitewater boys, earning first-team All-RVC honors with a Top 8 finish. \n“Brodie is such a tough racer and wants it really bad, he's a lot of fun to watch,” said Chad Carstens. \nReceiving second-team honors for the Whippets was junior Connor Laue (12th, 18:37.5), while Jimmy King (20th, 18:52.5), Jacob Korf (27th, 19:19.9) and sophomore Elliot McCulloch (43rd, 20:17.1) completed Whitewater’s scoring. \nThe WIAA Sectional meet is up next for the Eagles, Whippets and Panthers. \nJefferson and Whitewater will run in the Division 2 Pewaukee Sectional on Saturday, Oct. 24. The girls’ race begins at 10 a.m. while the boys’ race starts at 10:45 a.m. \nPalmyra-Eagle will compete in the Division 3 Lake Country Lutheran Sectional on Oct. 24. The girls’ race begins 1 p.m., with the boys’ race scheduled to start at 1:45 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T01:33:46.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
