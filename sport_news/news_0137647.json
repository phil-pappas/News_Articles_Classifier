Here are some highlights.\nDoes Charlie Strong survive to coach next year at UT if they finish with 4 or 5 wins this year, which looks to be a definite possibility?\nGosselin: \"Unless the new AD, whomever it is, decides he wants to bring in his own guy, I think Charlie is back. There was a strong financial commitment to him and I don't think you can judge him until after four years when he has overhauled the roster with his own recruits. Strong is a good football coach.
