Cavan Sieczkowski Senior Editor, News & Analytics, The Huffington Post Posted: 10/14/2015 10:31 AM EDT \nRonda Rousey doesn't let the scale or the numbers on it affect her. In a recent interview with Cosmopolitan she revealed how a few body-positive affirmations can make all the difference. \nI look at myself in the mirror before I step on the scale. I don't suddenly look different because a certain number popped up on the scale. I try to look at myself and be like, 'Looking awesome.' I say that to myself all the time ... I'm really proud of how I look. There are pluses and minuses to every phase of my body, and I've learned to appreciate all of them , you know? When I'm at the heaviest, that's when my butt looks great, and so I'm just like, 'You know what? Great butt day!' And if I'm really skinny, I'm like, 'You know what? Good ab day!' ​ \nThe UFC champion has been vocal about the purpose her body holds and why that is so meaningful to her. \n\"I grew up thinking that because my body type was uncommon [i.e., athletic], it was a bad thing,\" she said back in July. \"Now that I'm older, I've really begun to realize that I'm really proud that my body has developed for a purpose and not just to be looked at.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T17:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T17:53:36.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
