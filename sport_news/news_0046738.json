His previous worst was 12th in 2001. \nLowndes said he would find inspiration from Mostert’s last-to-first finish to win last year’s Bathurst 1000. \n“We knew there was the potential for showers,” Lowndes said. \n“Now I am very focused on what happened last year.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:24:40.610+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
