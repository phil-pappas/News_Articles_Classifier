Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports By Bill BradleyLas   \nWho to follow? Who to follow? \nThat's not an easy question as the PGA Tour's Shriners Open begins tournament play on Thursday at the TPC of Summelin. The event announced its pairings and tee times Tuesday morning for the first two rounds on Thursday and Friday. \nThe simple answer would be to follow Tour star Rickie Fowler. At 26, the two-time winner last year is a hot commodity with fans as they try to copy his outrageous Puma outfits. \nFowler tees off at 7:23 a.m. Thursday on the 10 th tee with Davis Love III and Jimmy Walker. Love has 21 tour wins since turning pro in 1985, including a victory last season, and Walker has won five tournaments in the past two seasons. \nWant an international group? Follow the colorful Argentine Angel Cabrera, known for smoking a stogie on the course, has won three times on Tour since 1996. He is is paired with Steven Bowditch of Australia and South Korean phenom Seung-Yul Noh. They tee off on the 1 st hole at 7:42 a.m. Thursday. \nIf you want to stay local, you can follow Las Vegas' Charley Hoffman and Ryan Moore. Hoffman is coming off his best season on the Tour and Moore has notched Tour victories three of the past four seasons. They will be joined by Argentina's Emiliano Grillo, who won the Frys.com Open last Sunday, on the first tee at 12:18 p.m. Thursday. \nThe rest of the field is filled with names you might know, like Boo Weekly, Rory Sabbatini, Vijay Singh, Stuart Appleby and Nick Watney. \nBut the most underrated group could be off at 12:08 p.m. Thursday. That's when Webb Simpson, Jason Dufner and Keegan Bradley hit off the first tee. The trio has 10 tournament wins combined and is worth watching. \nJust keep an eye out for the Fowler wannabees. \nSports Editor Bill Bradley can be reached at bbradley@reviewjournal.com or 702-387-2909. \nPGA TOUR SHRINERS HOSPITALS FOR CHILDRENS OPEN \nThursday and Friday tee times \nRound 1-first tee/Round 2-10th tee \n6:55 a.m./11:40 a.m.: Bryce Molder, Scottsdale, AZ; Spencer Levin, Elk Grove, CA; Patrick Rodgers, Avon, IN. \n7:04 /11:49: Jonas Blixt, Jacksonville, FL; Justin Hicks, West Palm Beach, FL; Jim Herman, Palm City, FL. \n7:14/11:59: Jason Bohn, Acworth, GA; Cameron Tringale, Laguna Niguel, CA; Daniel Summerhays, Farmington, UT. \n7:23/12:08 p.m.: J.J.
