TERRY PIERSON , TERRY PIERSON, FILE PHOTO Related article » IF YOU GO What: Hemet City Council meeting\nWhen: 7 p.m. today\nWhere: Council chambers, 450 E. Latham Ave.\nWhy go: Council will hear five-year spending plan to balance the budget\nHemet has struggled with its finances for the past decade, but the City Council will hear a plan today projected to save $34 million by 2020.\nMost of the savings will come from changes to the retiree health plan, according to a report from Deputy City Manager Jessica Hurst. Hemet also plans to keep other costs constant, with no employee raises or staff increases.\n“What it shows is that with keeping the status quo on services and employees, we’ll be OK in 2020,” Mayor Linda Krupa said. “It means status quo, it does not mean adding people to the Police Department, or adding to the Fire Department. These number are based on what we have today. We don’t have the money to increase numbers.”\nThe current $41 million fiscal year budget is only balanced because $5 million of reserve funds are being spent. It marks the seventh consecutive year of deficit spending in the city of more than 80,000 residents.\nDuring a budget workshop in January, the council was told without changes, the city could run out of money by 2018. Under the new proposal, Hemet will have more than $12.5 million in the reserve account by 2020.\nHemet blames most of its financial woes on a 25 percent drop in sales and property tax revenue at the height of the recession and the state’s dissolution of redevelopment agencies, which the city says hurt its ability to fight blight and encourage economic development.\nRising healthcare costs were the biggest threat to financial security before the council last month approved a plan to move some retirees to a less expensive plan, saving Hemet an estimated $1 million this year alone – and an expected $13 million over the next five years.\nOther money is expected from increased sales tax revenues, which are anticipated to be back to pre-recession rates by 2018, and rebounding property tax receipts.\nSales tax revenue is the largest source of general fund income for the city. Hemet collected $10.1 million in sales tax revenue in 2012-13, projects $12.1 million in the current year and $13.7 million in 2019-20.\nProperty taxes, at $4.9 million in ’12-13, are anticipated to reach $5.5 million in ’19-20.\nA renewed effort to secure grants and other money for specific projects is under way. The proposal also assumes that future major capital improvement projects will be paid for with money from outside the general fund.\n“Given the information currently available, a fully balanced budget will likely be achieved in the next five years without impacting current levels of service provided to the community,” Hurst wrote in her report.\nMayor Krupa praised the staff for the effort put into the plan.\n“There were many eyes looking at the numbers and projections,” she said. “It’s conservative, but yet realistic.”\nContact the writer: 951-368-9086 or cshultz@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nw4nct-b88535711z.120151012144831000gfdchq22.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nw4nct-b88535711z.120151012144831000gfdchq22.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:17:19.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
