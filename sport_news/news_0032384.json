Two years back, he was way ahead and I almost chased him down. Last year I managed to chase him down. He's probably been waiting for this for a full year. I think we'll both be ready for it,\" Lahiri said.\nLahiri's compatriots Chiragh Kumar and Rashid Khan were also on the tail of 42-year-old big-hitting Hend.\nKumar fired a three-under 69 to sit alone on third on 11-under with Khan a further shot back in a tie for fourth with Australian Sam Brazel after a 68.\nSouth Korea's Wang Jeung-hun, the overnight leader, fell down the leaderboard into sixth, some six back of Hend, after he could only muster a level par 71.\n(Writing by Patrick Johnston in Singapore; editing by Sudipto Ganguly )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T15:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T15:20:49.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
