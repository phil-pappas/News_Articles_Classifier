(AP) - A Hudson Valley dentist is scheduled to be arraigned on murder charges in what authorities say was the fatal poisoning of a 44-year-old man four years ago.\nThe Daily Freeman of Kingston reports ( http://bit.ly/1G9flqz ) 48-year-old Gilberto Nunez of Poughkeepsie is expected to be arraigned Friday morning in Ulster County Court in Kingston on charges of second-degree murder.\nAuthorities say the charges stem from the November 2011 death of Thomas Kolman, a married father of four from nearby Saugerties (SAW'-ger-teez). Officials say Nunez forced Kolman to ingest a substance that caused his death.\nAuthorities haven't identified the substance or publicly discussed a possible motive. They say Kolman was poisoned at a shopping plaza in the town of Ulster, outside Kingston, where Nunez's practice is located.\nNunez's attorney, Gerald Shargel, said his client didn't cause Kolman's death.\nInformation from: Daily Freeman, http://www.dailyfreeman.com/\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1G9flqz", "http://www.dailyfreeman.com/"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:52:27.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
