That stands in stark contrast to a 19-17 loss to North Dakota on Oct. 3 in which the Vikings gained 247 yards.\n\"I need the fans to want to come back, and we were so boring on offense against North Dakota,\" said PSU head coach Bruce Barnum , who was given a five-year contract earlier this week. \"Something had to be done. We have the tools, we just had to put it together.\"\nThe Vikings were far from boring Saturday, averaging 8.6 yards per play in gaining 682 yards of total offense. They needed it to keep pace with the Bobcats, who gained 440 yards overall but only 181 in the second half.\nPortland State went 11 for 14 on third down, and didn't punt until there were 23 seconds left in the game. Quarterback Alex Kuresa 's lost fumble on the Vikings' ninth possession was their first empty trip, but the defense responded by stopping Montana State (3-3, 2-2) on fourth down at the PSU 11-yard line.\n\"We have several different guys making plays, and we're doing it on big downs,\" said Kuresa, who completed 10 of 14 passes for 217 yards and a touchdown. \"Any time you get backed up and convert on third down, it's frustrating for a defense.\n\"Maybe the first few weeks we weren't making those plays, but it's contagious now.\"\nAfter MSU quarterback Dakota Prukop scored on a 61-yard run 1:21 into the game, Jones went 79 yards on PSU's first play to even the score. Prukop scored again on the Bobcats' next possession, but Nate Tago, Paris Penn and Thomas Carter scored consecutive touchdowns to give the Vikings a 28-14 lead.\n\"We left some points on the field against North Dakota, so that was a rude awakening,\" said Jones, whose 285-yard performance ranks fifth in a single game in school history. \"We realize we needed to score some points to help our defense out.\"\nKuresa's three-yard touchdown run after another Prukop score made it 35-21 Vikings at halftime. Jones ran for touchdowns of 26 and 56 yards in the first four minutes of the third quarter, sandwiched around a 100-yard kickoff return touchdown by MSU's Logan Jones.\nPenn's second touchdown helped the Vikings maintain a 56-42 lead through three, then PSU played a ball-control game in the fourth quarter. A 12-play, 77-yard drive resulting in a field goal ate up 6:42 on the clock and closed out the scoring.\n\"I liked the attitude, and I like how we are right now,\" Barnum said. \"The kids are where we want them. We play sandlot football, and we have fun playing the game.\"\nWith the win, Barnum had to make good on an offer to buy fans a beer after the game at a bar near Providence Park. He feigned despair when talking about paying the tab, commenting that \"my wife will have to have a couple or I'll be in trouble when I get home.\"\nBarnum reiterated, though, that he's trying to do whatever he can to help rebuild the PSU fanbase.\n\"I'd love to have people come out and watch these games,\" he said. \"They play the game the way it's supposed to be played. It's a clean game and they respect it, win or lose.\"\nNext week, the Vikings travel south to face Cal Poly, a program led by former PSU head coach Tim Walsh. The Mustangs are 2-4, but lost to conference power Eastern Washington by one point in their last game.\n\"Tim's the guy I picked to win the conference,\" Barnum said of his preseason coaches' poll vote. \"No week is easy. We earned another six days of glory, but we'll get ready for next week.\"\n-- Scott Sepich for The Oregonian/OregonLive", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T01:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:24:32.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
