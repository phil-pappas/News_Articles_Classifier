But it is the meeting with Mount Cricket Club from Batley, Yorkshire, on Oct. 17 that is likely to attract the most attention, with the Church hoping it will make a small contribution to global inter-faith understanding. — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:29:36.442+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
