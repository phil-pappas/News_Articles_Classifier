(AP) — Paul Aguilar ripped his volley into the far corner of Brad Guzan's net in an instant, setting off a delirious celebration for the majority of the Rose Bowl crowd. \nAfter four winless years in the rivalry, Mexico had finally beaten \n\"Everybody was very confident after Bobby scored that goal,\" U.S. defender Matt Besler said. \"The entire Rose Bowl erupted. It's a feeling that I'll never forget. I think we had eight minutes left. I knew we were going to get a couple more chances, and on the other end, I was confident we weren't going to allow Mexico to score. Unfortunately that didn't work out.\" \nInstead, El Tri won the one-game playoff between the last two Gold Cup winners to earn CONCACAF's berth in the eight-team Confederations Cup tournament in Russia, a prelude to the 2018 World Cup. \n\"It's a result that was earned,\" Mexico interim coach Ricardo Perretti said. \"Over 120 minutes, we did more to earn that third goal.\" \nA crowd of 93,723 created a crackling atmosphere under the lights at the 93-year-old stadium. It was the second-largest attendance to watch the U.S. team at home, barely surpassed by the 1994 Rose Bowl turnout for a World Cup game against Romania. \nGeoff Cameron scored in the 15th minute for the U.S., but Saturday was a double downer for the United States: A few hours earlier, the under-23 team lost 2-0 to Hondura \nAguilar's goal was a crackerjack display of skill and athleticism — \nMexico beat the U.S. 4-2 in the 2011 Gold Cup final that day, a loss that led to coach Bob Bradley's departure and Klinsmann's arrival. \nLandon Donovan was among the U.S. observers who considered this game to be a referendum on Klinsmann's four-year tenure. His team has endured an unsettling summer with its semifinal loss to Jamaica in the Gold Cup and two friendly losses, and Mexico controlled play before getting the late result. \n\"Everybody can express his opinion, but not everybody likes you, and that's totally fine,\" Klinsmann said. \"I am not here to be liked. I'm trying to do a good job, and privileged to have that role and represent the U.S. soccer program.\" \nThe U.S. and Mexico played overtime for just the second time in the rivalry's 65-game history. Mexico won 1-0 in a Confederations Cup semifinal at Azteca Stadium in 1999. \nCopyright © The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
