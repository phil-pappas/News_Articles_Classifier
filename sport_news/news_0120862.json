Susana Martinez and other top-ranking state officials as both a convenience for state workers and a potential savings for taxpayers, since pricey visits to the emergency room and outside specialty care doctors could decrease as a result.\n“It’s great news for the taxpayers, but it’s better news for our employees,” Martinez said during a news conference.\nNew Mexico state government has faced rising employee health insurance premiums in recent years, an increase that has affected both workers’ take-home pay and the state budget.\nThe state currently covers roughly 80,000 individuals through various private insurance plans, a figure that includes state government workers, their family members and some local government employees.\nThe new health clinic actually opened last month and has already seen roughly 400 patients. It’s run and staffed by Cerner, a Kansas City-based company, under a four-year contract with the state that will pay the company a total of nearly $7 million.\nBut Martinez administration officials say the investment will pay off to state taxpayers in the long run, claiming the clinic could bring cost savings of between $3.5 million to $5.5 million per year.\nGeneral Services Secretary Ed Burckle said the clinic has already proved beneficial, citing the case of one GSD employee who received preventive treatment after suffering from asthma-related complications stemming from a recent controlled burn in the Santa Fe area.\nHe also described the model as unique, saying, “At the time we embarked on this, no one else had opened a state-provided health care clinic.”\nCurrently, the only other state with a state-provided health center is Missouri, according to Cerner executives.\nStay Well New Mexico will offer primary and occupational care during the week, with urgent care services also available on Saturdays. In addition, the clinic also allows patients to contact its health care practitioners online.\nMeanwhile, Martinez told reporters it made sense to open the first clinic in Santa Fe, but said a similar health center could be opened in Albuquerque, and possibly in other parts of the state, in the future.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T08:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:09:24.015+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
