(Brant Sanderlin/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP) MARIETTA DAILY OUT; GWINNETT DAILY POST OUT; LOCAL TELEVISION OUT; WXIA-TV OUT; WGCL-TV OUT; MANDATORY CREDIT Sponsored Links The Associated Press KNOXVILLE, Tenn. â€” \nGeorgia running back Nick Chubb has left Saturday's game with Tennessee after injuring his left knee on the first play from scrimmage. \nChubb was running toward the sideline when he was hit by cornerback Emmanuel Moseley and later by linebacker Jalen Reeves-Maybin. He was helped off the field and remained on the sideline surrounded by a crowd of players and team officials as the 19th-ranked Bulldogs began their second offensive series. He later was carted away. \nGeorgia officials said he wasn't expected to return to the game. \nThis marks the second straight time Georgia has lost a running back to a potentially serious injury during a trip to Tennessee. In the Bulldogs' 34-31 overtime victory at Tennessee in 2013, Georgia running back Keith Marshall and wide receiver Justin Scott-Wesley tore their anterior cruciate ligaments in their right knees to knock them out for the remainder of that season. \nChubb had rushed for at least 100 yards rushing in 13 straight games and was leading all active Football Bowl Subdivision players with a career average of 127.3 yards rushing per game. He entered Saturday ranked third nationally with 801 yards rushing on 91 carries. \n___ \nAP college football website: collegefootball.ap.org Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WPXI-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:41:17.717+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
