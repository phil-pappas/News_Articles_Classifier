You see it on TV all the time at the Under Armour All-American games and everything like, man, that could be me one day and today was my day.” \nNoland signed with Appalachian State, where he’ll enroll early in January. Noland, who has thrown for 790 yards and eight touchdowns through six games for Oconee County, verbally committed in June over a handful of other schools. \n“That’s been his plan for a lot of years and we’d been tracking it because for quarterbacks, it gives them an extra whole semester to just learn with no expectations, no pressure and he’ll go through the extra spring and get acclimated to college life,” said Oconee County coach and Zeb’s father, Travis Noland. “We think it’ll be a win-win for him, though he’ll have some shock when he gets there in the middle of January, how cold it is in Boone.” \nTravis Noland knows all about the weather in Boone. He played there in the 1980s, and Zeb’s been making the trek there since he was young. \n“We’re excited for him,” Travis Noland said. “It’s one of those things where he’ll make his own way and find his own path and as a parent, that’s all you can want for your child.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:15:01.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
