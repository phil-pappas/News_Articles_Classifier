It is perhaps the hardest trophy in sport to win. In its 165-year history, only four countries have managed to win the America's Cup.\nThe America's Cup is currently held by the Golden Gate Yacht Club in San Francisco , U.S.A. On September 25, 2013 , its team, ORACLE TEAM USA , completed the biggest comeback in sports to retain the trophy it had first won in 2010.\nOn December 2, 2014 , Bermuda was named as the home of the 35th America's Cup, with the iconic Great Sound as the race course area where the new America's Cup Class boats (15-meter, foiling, wing-sailed catamarans) from each competing nation will race for the America's Cup in May/June 2017.\nThe America's Cup is honored to partner with Louis Vuitton as the title partner of the Louis Vuitton America's Cup World Series, the Louis Vuitton America's Cup Qualifiers and the Louis Vuitton America's Cup Challenger Playoffs. Louis Vuitton is also the presenting partner of the 35th America's Cup Match, presented by Louis Vuitton .\nThe America's Cup is also proud to be supported by BMW, Bremont, ORACLE, the Bermuda Tourism Authority, and Gosling's as well as: Appleby, BF&M, Butterfield, Butterfield & Vallis, Moët & Chandon, the Hamilton Princess & Beach Club, PwC and Sail Racing.\nAmerica's Cup updates are also available on your mobile device.
