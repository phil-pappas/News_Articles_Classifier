(AP) - Police in Syracuse have released the name of the 15-year-old boy who was killed in a shooting that also left a 17-year-old with a gunshot wound in the leg.\nOfficials say Thursday that Zavion Escobar of Syracuse was fatally shot around 7:20 p.m. Wednesday while sitting on a porch at a home on Hope Avenue. Police said later Wednesday night that the other teen's injuries aren't life-threatening.\nPolice searched the 160-acre Oakwood Cemetery after the suspects fled into it when they ditched their vehicle. A helicopter and K-9 units were then brought in to search, but the suspects remain at large Thursday.\nThe cemetery is located near Syracuse University, which was placed in a two-hour lockdown late Wednesday night as a precaution.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:22:34.321+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
