Their few successful plays last week were on trick plays that got the ball to the outside. With the size and strength of Blair Oaks, their best bet is to catch them off-guard and makes plays on the edges. \nThat being said, they can’t become dependent on those plays, or they’ll start to see huge losses. \n‘If you try to run a reverse and they get penetration on the backside, you’re dead in the water. We don’t have time to run a double pass or anything like that unless we get protection. The double handoffs and things can confuse people, but it’s going to come down to execution and if we can get movement or not and last week we did not.” \nThat movement will be hard to come by with the defensive front of Blair Oaks. \nEven in the midst of a blowout, Versailles failed to move the football. The Tigers didn’t have a first down until just before the end of the first half. Outside of their inability to run, the Tigers struggled to throw the football. According to Silvers, Duane Danner struggled to get comfortable in the pocket, even if he had time. This led to Danner throwing several balls over the heads of his receivers. \n“He’s got to be able to trust his offensive line and the pass protection he’s gonna be getting,” Silvers said. “As a quarterback, once you’ve been hit once blindsided, when you didn’t feel any pressure, at that point you just become skiddish and obviously as good as their defensive line is, and linebackers they can overwhelm us and Duane’s gotta get the ball out quicker…he wasn’t stepping into his throws and it caused the ball to sail on him a little bit…he didn’t have that much trouble protection-wise, he just didn’t trust it.” \nWith all of their offensive struggles, the defense didn’t look great either. \nBlair Oaks had 423 yards on the ground and 113 through the air as they moved the ball at will. Starters found their way to the bench pretty quickly, but Blair Oaks kept putting up points. It’s hard to see Versailles doing much to slow down this devastating attack. \n“With the option game, (quarterback) Jordan Hair does the best job I’ve ever seen of a high school kid of reading whoever you’re taking away,” Silvers said. “Pretty much whoever we had a defensive back assigned to ended up with the ball. He did a really good job, he didn’t have one missed read that I can think of.” \nWhile Versailles will lose this week in all likelihood, the Tigers will use this game to try to find some things to build on. They will also try to make sure that their seniors can have one more highlight to end their season. \n“The biggest thing is making sure we get the seniors out with some type of success,” Silvers said. “Whether it’s getting them a touchdown or turnover or something like that. We wanna do that. We gonna work as hard as we can to make sure they can have some glimmer of success before they leave. \nWith the deck stacked against them, the Tigers know they have nothing to lose tonight. \nThis is David versus Goliath. Even if David can’t win, they want to sling a rock or two Goliath’s way. \n“We can’t perform any worse than we did Friday, obviously, there’s no way,” said Silvers. “There’s a zero percent chance that we have a worse score or offensive turnout. Everything is looking up for us.” \nVersailles at Blair Oaks - Updates on Twitter: @tony_hawley \nPodcast", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T14:38:50.389+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
