Behind his running, the Broncos are 6-1 heading into a key game Friday night against Great Falls CMR. \nSam Sparks has a passion for fishing. \nThe Billings Senior running back will fly fish and spin fish for trout. He also enjoys angling for catfish. Sparks prefers fishing on creeks and rivers to lakes. He has not been \"deep-sea fishing, but would like to get some of those big-old suckers.\" The largest fish Sparks ever caught was a catfish that was \"like a tree trunk. It was huge,\" in Wyoming. \n\"I love fishing. My dad is a fisherman and his dad is a fisherman,\" Sparks said. \"I come from a family of hardcore fishermen. Not just lake fishermen.\" \nEven so, nothing comes close to his love of football. \n\"I love football to death,\" the 6-foot, 180-pounder. \"I wouldn't trade it for anything. It's a sport to get away and get loose. When you put that helmet on, you are locked in. You have to be locked in 100 percent of the time.\" \nThis year, Sparks has charged his way to 846 yards on 129 carries, for an average of 6.6 yards per carry. His long run is for 47 yards and he has scored seven times. \nLast year, Sparks rushed 117 times for 582 yards. \nSenior coach Chris Murdock said when he thinks of Sparks, he thinks of the running back's love of football. \n\"This year, we all think his vision has improved dramatically,\" Murdock said. \"He runs so hard, he only has one speed, he's full-go. \n\"He's just a huge part of our offense with the velocity he plays with and the tackles he breaks. There's not a ton of kids who can play that hard, stay healthy and carry the load.\" \nSparks said the Broncs' offensive line, \"kept sturdy\" by seniors Mac Bartsch and Devin Maua, makes his job easy. \n\"I just get the ball and try to get as many yards as I can get,\" he said. \"I get the ball and follow those big guys up front. They keep me safe. \n\"I love running the ball in that offense. Especially when I follow those guys. They open huge holes.\" \nBroncs offensive line coach Brandon Quesenberry said of Sparks: \"He's tough. There's not too often he loses yards. He's a guy the line loves to block for. He'll go 100 miles per hour, or until he breaks.\" \nPlaying in the Broncs' spread offense is fun Sparks said. Senior has averaged nearly 32 points per game in compiling a 6-1 record. \nJunior quarterback Nate Dick has passed for 1,172 yards with 10 touchdowns and two interceptions and a 66-percent completion percentage. Sophomore receiver Gabe Sulser has 32 catches for 554 yards and seven scores, while senior wide receiver Tyger Frye has snagged 38 receptions for 420 yards and three touchdowns. \nLed by Sparks, the Broncs have rushed for 1,390 yards. Dick has chipped in 359 yards. \n\"Playing with Gabe and Tyger and Nate is awesome,\" Sparks said. \"We are the most explosive bunch in the state.\" \nWhat helps the Broncs be a cohesive unit is none of the skill players are selfish and each knows they will get their calls said Sparks. \n\"There are always opportunities to make plays in a spread offense,\" he said. \nSparks was voted a captain by his teammates. Murdock said Sparks is a true teammate, who is always there with words of encouragement. \nSenior is coming off a 20-19 loss to Bozeman as the Hawks blocked a Broncs field-goal attempt on the final play of the game. A win would have clinched a playoff berth for the Broncs. \nNow, the Broncs are fishing for a victory against Great Falls CMR (4-3) at 7 p.m. Friday at Wendy's Field at Daylis Stadium. \n\"Our tempo is really high,\" Sparks said. \"We've had a great two days of practice so far and will keep the momentum and are really excited to bounce back. \n\"We will come out really excited because of the loss to Bozeman. All our guys are ready. We are in a playoff attitude and will keep it that way through the playoffs.\" Friday Night Lights \nGreat Falls CMR (4-3) at Billings Senior (6-1), 7 p.m., Wendy's Field at Daylis Stadium \nBillings Central (3-0, 5-1) at Miles City (3-0, 7-0), 7 p.m. \nHardin (0-3, 1-5) at Laurel (1-2, 4-2), 7 p.m. Tags", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:40:29.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
