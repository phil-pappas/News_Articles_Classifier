But offense? The Wolf Pack knows offense. Murray's MW rankings: Big slip for Pack \nHowever, since longtime coach Chris Ault stepped down following the 2012 season, the Nevada offense hasn’t been so powerful. The trend was illuminated during Nevada’s 23-17 loss to UNLV on Saturday, its latest offensive struggle of the season. As it prepares to host New Mexico on Saturday, the Wolf Pack’s 360.8 yards per game are its fewest since 2000 and its 23.8 points per game are its fewest since 2003. \nThose two years (2000 and 2003) marked the beginning and the end of Chris Tormey’s run as Nevada’s head coach. Ault took over in 2004 and quickly made Nevada’s offense one of the nation’s most powerful. During his nine years on the job, the Wolf Pack averaged 35 points and 472 yards per game. Since he’s left, Nevada has averaged 26.6 points and 395.9 yards per game, both substantial decreases. \nA conference change was mixed in there – Nevada moved from the WAC to the Mountain West before Ault’s final year – but the Wolf Pack’s offense has clearly struggled since Ault resigned. \nThird-year coach Brian Polian said Nevada’s offense inconsistency this year is a combination of things leading to too many missed opportunities. \n“We’ve had chances to make big plays,” Polian said. “We haven’t made enough of them yet. Think of the chances we’ve had the last few games with plays down the field with balls in our hands and we haven’t brought the ball down or the receivers have been open and we just haven’t gotten it to them. We have to make plays. This is not unique to us. This happens in football all over the place.” \nThe biggest change this season was the loss of four-year starting quarterback Cody Fajardo, but it’s the guys standing in front of the quarterback that’s the biggest difference from the Ault era to the Polian era. In 2012, when Nevada averaged 37.9 points per game, the Pack’s offensive line included two NFL players (Joel Bitonio and Chris Barker) and two guys who reached NFL camp (Jeff Nady and Matt Galas). \nUnder Polian, the Wolf Pack offensive line has been patched together after a deluge of issues. Nevada has lost players to injuries (Mat McDermand; Chad Specht; Taylor Evans), grades (Sebastian Tretola); retirement (Connor Talbott); or watched them quit (Braxton Isaac; Derrick Stom; Abel De Haro). \nThe Union has turned from a strength – Nevada had at least one all-conference lineman nine years in a decade-long period – to a major issue, and a lack of depth at other positions (receiver and tight end) hasn’t helped, either. While Nevada has struggled offensively this season – it ranks 98th out of 127 teams in scoring – the Wolf Pack coaches and players feel close to a breakthrough. \n“It sounds cliché, but it’s the details,” running back Don Jackson said. “The smallest things: a half a second, a half a step, a shoelace, an inch of reading a block, a ball that’s on the tip of your fingers, a throw that’s five inches off. That’s the thing. When you watch the film, it’s just the smallest things.” \nPolian and offensive coordinator Nick Rolovich will stay the course with its run-first attack. Polian said he never thought of a quarterback change after Nevada was shutout in the first half against UNLV – “It’s not Tyler’s fault,” he said of quarterback Tyler Stewart – and drastic changes aren’t in the future. \n“I think a drastic change in the middle of the season when you haven’t been built that way is a recipe for disaster,” said Rolovich, who has been at Nevada since 2012. “We have the ability to run and throw and we threw more the other night than we have the past few games. But I think a drastic change doesn’t send the right message. I don’t think we’d be efficient or very good at it if that was the move right now.” \nRolovich said no position group played well enough for Nevada to beat UNLV. The goal is turning three-yard gains into four-yard gains and 13-yard gains into 14-yard gains as a building block for improvement. The game plan at the beginning of the season won’t change. Nevada is hopeful the execution changes. \n“We have a plan,” Rolovich said. “We’re not executing at a high enough level to consistently be a factor in the games in a positive manner. The word is consistency. We have a plan to run the ball and that’s what we want to do and we have to find ways to be more and more consistent with it.” Wolf Pack's focus: Don't let UNLV beat us twice \nRolovich said a big-game output could give his offensive players a nice boost of confidence. That could come against New Mexico, a risk-reward defense that blitzes on 61 percent of its plays. That’s led to some big plays for New Mexico (10 turnovers created, 43 tackles for loss, 19 sacks) and some big plays for the opponent (the Lobos have allowed 32.3 points per games in its four contests against FBS teams). \n“It is a little bit of feast or famine,” Polian said. “They will get tackles for losses but occasionally when their front is moving and a guy doesn’t get all the way to the gap he needs to and the ball is run there they get split. We’re going to have a couple of plays where we’re hit on the line of scrimmage or a yard or two in the backfield, but our hope is we can hit some creases too and get the ball north and south.” \nThe good news for Nevada is it has taken good care of the ball, with only three turnovers in five games. But dropped passes, missed blocks, off-target throws, ill-time penalties and a variety of other maladies have held the Nevada offense to its worst output in more than a decade. Seven games remain to change that trend and while many of the offensive players are frustrated, Jackson sees that as a good sign. \n“It’s frustrating, but I’m happy I’m not the only one frustrated,” Jackson said. “We have a bunch of frustrated guys on offense. Nobody is pointing fingers. We’re all looking at ourselves in the mirror.” \nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
