For those of you who missed it, this is what happened: \nThat being said, I am a little unhappy about the Vols doing their usual bit and choking away a fourth-quarter advantage. Give up two touchdowns in the final five minutes to lose, two weeks after blowing a 17-point edge against Oklahoma? Brutal. Equally brutal: That bad weekend of football has me sitting in last place. But while I stunk it up, Mick nearly posted our first-ever perfect record. His lone misfire came compliments of the Saints, who couldn't finish off Cam Newton and the Panthers in Carolina. Nonetheless, his 9-1 performance pushed him into a tie with David for first place at 23-7 overall. \nThe two leaders in our UPickEm contest, Rusty and bliss, both went a perfect 10-for-10 last week, and now have 18 points overall. \nNow, it's your turn! Follow this here link to our UPickEm.com page and make your picks by 11 a.m. on Saturday for the chance to win a $75 gift card. At the end of the NFL season, the person with the best record will receive a $75 gift card to Buffalo Wild Wings. The second place finisher will receive a $25 gift card.
