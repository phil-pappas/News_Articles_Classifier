AFP PHOTO / MARCO BERTORELLO (Photo credit should read MARCO BERTORELLO/AFP/Getty Images)\nJuventus are reportedly hoping to strike a deal with Chelsea to make Juan Cuadrado's season-long loan into a permanent £14million deal.\nAdChoices Cuadradro joined the Serie A champions on a season-long loan deal over the summer after failing to establish himself under Jose Mourinho at Chelsea, and has made a seamless transition back into Italian football.\nThe loan deal for the Colombian winger did not include an option to buy, but Juve are keen to seal a permanent deal for the player once the transfer window reopens in January.\nReports in Italy suggest Juventus will make a 20million euros (£14m) offer for the player, though Chelsea may be looking to get nearer to the 25million euros mark for a player they signed for 32million euros (£23million) in January 2015.\nChelsea, however, are in no hurry to enter negotiations with Juventus with a number of more pressing issues – such as their woeful start to the season – to deal with.\nThe former Fiorentina player is reportedly unwilling to return to Chelsea, where in 15 appearances for the club, he managed no goals and just one assist.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:18:10.621+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
