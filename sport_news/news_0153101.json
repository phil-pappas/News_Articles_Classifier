Unfortunately, the Americans spent much of the rest of Thursday's Olympic qualifying opener against Canada struggling to consistently muster that same magic.\nAdChoices The U.S. played well enough to win, and was never really in danger of losing at any point during its 3-1 victory, but the overall performance left plenty for Andi Herzog's team to work on.\nThe positives were plenty, starting with the play of Jordan Morris, who continued to dazzle on every level he plays. Morris scored the first two U.S. goals to help keep his team from stumbling in its first group stage qualifying match.\nThere were also strong showings from some of the handful of U-20 national team players who were given the nod in the opener. A total of five players from the U.S. Under-20 World Cup team started on Thursday, and Matt Miazga, Zack Steffen and Emerson Hyndman all were instrumental in the victory.\nThe U.S. didn't play to its full potential Thursday, but for a first match of the tournament, the win against Canada had more positives than negatives, as well as plenty to work on heading into Saturday's match against Cuba.\nHere is a look at five key takeaways from the U.S. Olympic qualifying win against Canada:\nMORRIS REMINDS US HE'S INDISPENSABLE\nFor all the promising young talent in the U.S. Under-23 team, Jordan Morris provided a reminder of why he is still considered the most important player on the U.S. Olympic Qualifying team. It isn't just his goals, which are crucial, but it is his presence in the attack, and his speed, which keeps defenses on their toes and consistently gives teammates an outlet to look to.\nWhat was very clear on Thursday was just how confident Morris is now. Having already played several times for the senior team, in matches against the likes of Mexico, Germany and the Netherlands, Morris should feel very comfortable playing against CONCACAF defenses on the U-23 level.\nIf Thursday's display did anything, it should have shown Jurgen Klinsmann just how important Morris is to the Olympic qualifying campaign. That should keep Klinsmann from including Morris in the U.S. CONCACAF Cup squad for the Oct. 10 match against Mexico, which would then force Morris to miss the decisive Olympic Qualifying match on the same date.\nHYNDMAN LOOKS POISED FOR A BIG TOURNAMENT\nIt could have been down to unrealistic expectations, or the impressive showings of some of his teammates, but Emerson Hyndman didn't draw as many plaudits after the Under-20 World Cup as would have been expected of the Fulham midfielder before that tournament began. He had some good games, but didn't shine the way some thought he might.\nHis first match in Olympic qualifying showed us a player who looks ready to have a much better tournament in Olympic Qualifying than he had at the U-20 World Cup. Part of the reason for that is the stronger supporting cast he has on the U-23 team, with Wil Trapp serving as the ideal conduit in central midfield, and Fatai Alashe also helping out with defensive responsibilities that frees up Hyndman to create and find more of the ball.\nThe result was a match that saw Hyndman deliver some pinpoint passes into dangerous spots, and though his teammates didn't convert those opportunities, his ability to deliver the killer pass was clear to see.\nZELALEM STRUGGLES TO MAKE HIS MARK\nWhen Gedion Zelalem was announced as a starter on Thursday, the sense was that maybe, just maybe, he was ready to make his mark despite being the second-youngest player on the team. By night's end, it was clear we shouldn't expect the 18-year-old midfielder to work wonders.\nÂ© Provided by Goal.com Zelalem endured a mostly tepid showing playing on the left wing in the U.S. midfield. Herzog preferred to stick with Hyndman in central midfield, and chose to let Zelalem try and find success on the flank, where he might be able to take people on, cut inside and combine. Unfortunately for Zelalem, he wasn't really able to find much of the game, though part of the reason for that was the U.S. team's heavy use of Jerome Kiesewetter on the right wing.\nYou could see flashes of skill from Zelalem, and he did appear to be stronger than he looked at the Under-20 World Cup. That is probably a product of the playing time he's earning in the Scottish second division with Glasgow Rangers. Unfortunately for Zelalem, he really didn't make much of an impression, and you wonder if Herzog might choose someone else for that starting role against Cuba.\nDoes Zelalem's performance mean he's not worthy of the considerable hype surrounding him? Absolutely not. It's easy to forget that he, like defender Cameron Carter-Vickers, is age eligible for the next Olympic cycle, for the 2020 Olympics, but he's good enough to earn playing time now. He has some maturing and improving to do, but there is no denying he is a real talent.\nKIESEWETTER BOOSTS HIS STOCK\nWhen Rubio Rubin was left off the U.S. qualifying roster the immediate fear was that there would be nobody to help alleviate the pressure on Jordan Morris in the attack. Jerome Kiesewetter helped ease those fears with an outstanding showing against Canada. He set up Morris' first goal with a perfect cross, then he drew the penalty that led to the third U.S. goal.\nDeployed mainly on the right wing, Kiesewetter moved all over the field in search of the ball and opportunities to take on defenders, and he looked dangerous even more often than Morris did. Unfortunately, his finish did let him down on a few occasions, but there is no denying he looks like a real threat in the attack and he should help keep some of the pressure on Morris to carry the attack.\nMIAZGA SHOWS MATURITY\nAfter having Herzog say he has a national team future on the horizon, center back Matt Miazga went out and showed what the fuss was about. He helped hold the defense together with a steady showing and was the most impressive of the four American defenders. He broke up a plethora of Canadian attacking sequences and never looked troubled defensively at any point in the match.\nAt first, it seemed like playing three U-20s at the heart of the defense (Miazga, Cameron Carter-Vickers and goalkeeper Zack Steffen) might be risky in a U-23 tournament, but there had to be a benefit to the fact that the same trio played in the Under-20 World Cup together this past summer. Carter-Vickers may have had some nervy moments, as did Steffen, but overall they all looked capable of helping the team qualify for the Olympics.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:31:23.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
