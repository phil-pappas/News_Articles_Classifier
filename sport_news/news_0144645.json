The competition's first phase also saw 21 centuries scored and 14 five-wicket hauls then, with Punjab's 30-year-old Varun Khanna returning the best innings figures (8/97) and Services' debutant Diwesh Pathania (13/83) the best match figures of the season.\nRead on for a recap of the highs and lows and in-betweens of round one.\nJadeja runs over Tripura\nDropped from all formats for the Indian team, Ravindra Jadeja marked his return to domestic cricket with an emphatic all-round performance that helped Saurashtra drub Tripura by an innings and 118 runs at Rajkot. With the bat, he first made 91 to help the hosts to 307, but it was his left-arm spin that really crippled Tripura. Jadeja's exceptional figures of 27.1-13-27-6 bowled Tripura out for 103, and following on the visitors slumped to 86 in 53 overs with Jadeja adding five more wickets to end with match figures of 11/72.\nPunjab trample over Railways\nJust days after he was named for the first time in an Indian squad, Punjab allrounder Gurkeerat Singh Mann stroked the first double-century of the season, a superb unbeaten 201 to help set up his team's innings victory over Railways in Mohali. Gurkeerat's bullish 207-ball innings came after centuries from Uday Kaul (112) and Mandeep Singh (109) and with Gitansh Khera (102*) he put on 306 for the sixth wicket. A total of 604/5 declared saw Railways wilt for 196 and 282, with Man-of-the-Match Brainder Sran claiming 6/61 in the first innings and spinner Khanna taking 8/97 in the second.\nSpin dominates at Chepauk\nArguably the most engaging match of the round was between Tamil Nadu and Baroda, a low-scorer in Chennai that the hosts won by seven runs. Baroda's spinners bowled Tamil Nadu out for 125 on day one, but the home team's tweakers did well to restrict Baroda to 159. Another poor batting effort of 155 left Tamil Nadu to defend 121, which they did in enthralling manner. Rahil Shah backed his four first-innings wickets with 5/43 as Baroda ended on 114.\nPathania's stunning debut\nAt their home ground in Palam, Services marked their campaign opener with a nine-wicket win over Jharkhand. This win marked a remarkable debut for 26-year-old seam bowler Diwesh Pathania, who claimed 13/83. His 6/19 ran sent Jharkhand crashing to 45 all out on day one, which surpassed their previous lowest total of 81 by some distance. Seven more wickets in Jharkhand's second innings consigned the visitors to a huge defeat.\nKarnataka stay unbeaten but concede points\nAt the Barsapara Cricket Stadium in Guwahati, hosts Assam gave defending champions Karnataka a tough fight to take three first-innings lead points over them. Leading the way was former Karnataka spinner J Syed Mohammad with 7/44 to bowl out Karnataka for 187, after which Assam eked out a narrow lead in making 194. Karnataka rallied in their second innings, led by opener Ravikumar Samarth's 131. Set a target of 388, Assam were carried to 259/6 by J Arun Kartik's unbeaten 115. While they didn't win, Karnataka extended their unbeaten streak to 31.\nKerala almost pull it off\nIn Srinagar, Kerala came close to an improbable victory over Jammu & Kashmir but ultimately had to settle for three first-innings points. Having made 485 in reply to J&K's 330, with Sachin Baby (151) and skipper Sanju Samson (101) the chief contributors, Kerala bowled out the hosts for 225 to leave themselves a target of 71 in eight overs. But once they slipped to 28.3 in 5.4 overs, the route taken was one of safety and the match was drawn with Kerala 44/4 in eight overs.\nAnd then some ...\nIn Nagpur, India fast bowler Umesh Yadav struck his maiden first-class century off 106 balls, the second quickest by a Vidarbha player.\nIn his 100th first-class match, Tamil Nadu opener Abhinav Mukund made twin scores of 0.\nYoung Sarfaraz Khan marked his first appearance for his home state of Uttar Pradesh with 155 from 164 balls out of a total of 686/7.
