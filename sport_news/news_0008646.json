Earnhardt led a race-high 61 laps, but had to settle for second in a race he had to win when the Harvick-triggered crash ended the race under caution. \nNASCAR's most popular driver did not question his fate. \n\"When the race is over, I can live with the result as long as everyone else is going by the same rules,\" Earnhardt said. \"I felt like per the rule book, it sorted out and I finished second. I'm OK with that.\" \nNASCAR said this week it would make just one attempt at Talladega to finish the race under green instead of the usual three tries in a nod toward creating a safer racing environment. Drivers were almost unanimous in their support of the change, even when it came into play in a race that cut four drivers from the Chase field. \nEliminated Sunday were Earnhardt, Ryan Newman — the runner-up to Harvick last year — and Joe Gibbs Racing drivers Matt Kenseth and Denny Hamlin. JGR was considered a heavy favorite in this Chase after a dominating regular season, but had two of four drivers eliminated Sunday and both were furious with Harvick. \nHarvick had radioed to his crew under caution that a mechanical issue was preventing him from accelerating. But if he moved out of the way, he risked falling to the back of the field and potentially being knocked out of the Chase. \nSo he instead stayed put, and when his car failed to take off on the restart, he hit Trevor Bayne as Bayne tried to dart around him and it triggered a wreck that brought out the caution to end the race. Earnhardt was unable to race Logano for the win once the caution was called. \n\"It was a pretty tough ending. [He] knew he was blowing up and told everybody he was going to stay in his lane,\" Kenseth said. \"It just feels like we kind of lost control of the situation.\" \nDenny Hamlin echoed the sentiments of his Joe Gibbs Racing teammate. He was caught in the accident and had to climb from his flaming car, and said after that Harvick caused the wreck rather than risk losing positions on the track that would knock him out of the Chase. \n\"The 4 could only run about 30 miles an hour, I think he saw people coming and he knew he was probably going to be 30th, the last car on the lead lap, so he caused the wreck,\" said Hamlin. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T07:21:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T17:48:11.442+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
