THE ASSOCIATED PRESS   7:33   7:33   \nOrganizations: \nLouisiana (850) \nNEW ORLEANS â€” Police say they've concluded an investigation of a night club incident involving New Orleans Saints defensive end Cameron Jordan and do not plan to file any charges \"at this time.\" \nNew Orleans Police spokesman Tyler Gamble says detectives have forwarded their findings to the Orleans Parish District Attorney's office for review. \nIn early September, police released a report in which a woman stated that Jordan patted her on the backside and later lifted her boyfriend off his feet when he confronted the player in a bathroom. The couple also said Jordan sprayed them with champagne after the confrontation. \nThe NFL is looking into whether Jordan violated the league's code of conduct. \nJordan has started the Saints' first three games, recording one sack. He missed Wednesday's practice with a back injury. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitterfeed: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T02:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T03:55:08.949+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
