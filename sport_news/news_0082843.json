Browning was hurt a few plays before the touchdown pass.\n\"That was probably one time he didn't need to escape out of the pocket. We had somebody open who he was trying to find, he just couldn't see him. And so he flushed out of there and got knocked to the turf,\" Petersen said. \"Maybe down the road he does find that guy, but he does a great job of finding guys. Things like that are going to happen.\"\nWhen Washington got the ball back with 1:11 remaining, K.J. Carta-Samuels was in at quarterback while Browning was having his shoulder tended to on the sideline. Petersen said after the game that he didn't believe it was a significant injury but did not elaborate Monday.\nCarta-Samuels and Jeff Lindquist would both get significant reps in practice this week if Browning is slowed, Petersen said. The decision to go with Carta-Samuels for the final drive against Oregon — which ended with an interception by Ugo Amadi with 24 seconds left.— was an indication that Carta-Samuels was Washington's No. 2 quarterback.\nBrowning has started all six games for the Huskies and had big games the first month of the season against Sacramento State and Utah State, throwing for more than 300 yards against both.\nBut since the start of conference play, the Huskies pass game has been mostly grounded.\nBrowning threw for 152 yards and had two interceptions against California. He passed for 137 yards in the upset victory at USC and finished with 199 yards passing against Oregon.\nIt's the second time in Petersen's two seasons that the Huskies have had a stretch of at least three straight games without a 200-yard passer. The Huskies went the first five games last season without a quarterback throwing for 200 yards.\nBut Petersen is adamant Washington needs to get more from its pass game. The Huskies' longest pass play in the past three games is 31 yards. That won't be easy against Stanford's defense, which has allowed less than 200 yards passing in three of six games this season.\n\"It's not any one thing. It's just we're seeing some teams that play a little bit better defense,\" Petersen said. \"And so we would like to be more explosive there without question.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:14:46.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
