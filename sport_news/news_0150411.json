Wayne Hills' Luca Grave had nothing but open field between him and a touchdown. \n\"I was playing backside safety, I was trying to take an angle to cut him off and I got chipped off by a blocker and he ran past me,\" said Woetzel, The Record Male Athlete of the Week. \n\"All I remember is him being 5 or 7 yards ahead of me. I remember putting my head down and running. From there, I just caught up to him and tackled him at the 10.\" \nIt took Woetzel 70 or so yards to catch Grave, but it turned out to be a huge play because Wayne Hills would not score on that possession. The Green Raiders went on to win, 34-7. \n\"I don't remember much,\" Woetzel said, \"but I remember thinking, 'I'm going to do this for my team. I know everyone else on the team would do this, so I have to do this for my team.'\" \nWoetzel, who had been weighing his college options, committed to Lehigh on Monday night. \nWherever he ends up next fall, he's considering studying business or finance. \nArchitecture has also caught his interest. In fact, it's one of his favorite classes. \n\"Last year when I was taking a prerequisite for the class, we were looking at building structures and how it supports weight and how to disperse the weight and how to successfully build a structure that is strong,\" Woetzel said. \nAlso nominated: Brett Waller of Tenafly, Ryan VanderWerf of Hawthorne, Pete Guerriero of Lyndhurst, Jojo Robinson of Palisades Park/Leonia, Josh Paez of Wood-Ridge, Donald Stewart of Paramus Catholic and Mike Pimpinella of Pascack Valley for football.
