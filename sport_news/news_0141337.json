The Board of Directors voted 26-4 in favor of moving from four to six football classes. The change will be implemented beginning next season. \nThe movement has been on the table for some time, but there were questions whether it had enough support. Clearly, that's not a question anymore, even with opposition from the WPIAL. \nThis move allows the season to be reduced by one week. It also means more state champions, which has its own positives and negatives.
