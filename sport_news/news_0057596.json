COLTS 28, TEXANS 16, Dec. 30, 2012: The day began with coach Chuck Pagano’s emotional return. It ended with a celebratory locker room do-si-do. Deji Karim scored on a 101-yard kickoff return, Andrew Luck threw a 70-yard TD pass to T.Y. Hilton, and Pagano won in his first game back on the sideline after missing 12 games to battle leukemia. Texans running back Arian Foster showed his support for Pagano by tapping the #Chuckstrong sign in the back of the end zone after a scoring run. \n2. COLTS 37, JAGUARS 3, Sept. 29, 2013: Luck threw interceptions on Indy’s first two possessions, but rebounded to throw two TD passes for an easy win in Jacksonville. Outside linebacker Robert Mathis finished with three sacks and Indy’s defense held Maurice Jones-Drew, an old nemesis, to 23 yards on 13 carries. Trent Richardson ran for 60 yards and one TD in his second game with Indy. \n3. COLTS 27, TEXANS 24, Nov. 3, 2013: Houston took a 21-3 lead but couldn’t hang on after coach Gary Kubiak collapsed at halftime. T.Y. Hilton caught three second-half TD passes and Luck pulled off his 10th career comeback win. Kubiak fell to the turf while walking toward the locker room and was taken by ambulance to the hospital. Wade Phillips replaced Kubiak on the sideline, but the Texans still lost their sixth straight. \n4. COLTS 30, TITANS 27, Nov. 14, 2013: The Comeback Kid did it again. After Tennessee took a 17-6 halftime lead, the Colts opened the second half with 20 straight points and held on to complete a road sweep of the division. Luck scored on one TD run, Donald Brown added two more TD runs, and Indy beat the Titans for the fourth straight time. Adam Vinatieri tied a career high with his fourth 50-yard field goal of the season. \n5. COLTS 22, TITANS 14, Dec. 1, 2013: Pagano shook up the offensive lineup and it got the Colts back in sync. Vinatieri made a career-high five field goals and tied an NFL record with four in one game from at least 40 yards. Brown scored the clinching touchdown on a late 4-yard run. The win put Indy on the verge of clinching its eighth division crown in 11 years. \n6. COLTS 25, TEXANS 3, Dec. 15, 2013: Indianapolis finally broke out of a two-month funk and got back in playoff form. Luck threw two TD passes, Mathis broke the Colts’ single season and franchise sacks records, and Houston fell to 0-12 all-time in Indianapolis. It was the Colts’ best offensive performance since Reggie Wayne injured his knee in October. \n7. COLTS 30, JAGUARS 10, Dec. 29, 2013: The surging Colts closed the regular season with a third straight blowout, and Luck became the first player in league history to top 8,000 yards passing in his first two NFL seasons. Hilton caught 11 passes for 155 yards, Mathis clinched the league’s sacks title, and Vinatieri passed George Blanda and Matt Stover for No. 5 on the NFL’s scoring list. \n8. COLTS 44, JAGUARS 17, Sept. 21, 2014: Luck threw three touchdown passes in the first half and four overall as the Colts dominated Jacksonville. The third-year quarterback was 22 of 27 for 244 yards in the first two quarters and never gave the Jags a chance. Indy led 20-0 before Jacksonville even had a first down. Jags coach Gus Bradley benched veteran quarterback Chad Henne at halftime in favor of rookie Blake Bortles. \n9. COLTS 41, TITANS 17, Sept. 28, 2014: Wayne re-emerged with a spectacular, spinning 28-yard TD catch, Luck threw for 393 yards and the Colts evened their record at 2-2 with another rout. Wayne had seven catches for 119 yards, the 43rd and final 100-yard game of his Indy career. The Colts kept the ball for more than 42 minutes after Charlie Whitehurst replaced the injured Jake Locker as Tennessee’s starting quarterback. \n10. COLTS 33, TEXANS 28, Oct. 9, 2014: Indy’s offense scored 24 points in the first 15 minutes, and the defense recovered two late fumbles to seal the win. Luck returned to his hometown and topped the 300-yard mark for the fourth consecutive game. He wasn’t perfect, though, and J.J. Watt made the Colts pay with a fourth-quarter fumble return for a TD that gave the Texans a chance. Hilton had a career-best 233 yards receiving. \n11. COLTS 23, JAGUARS 3, Nov. 23, 2014: Hilton raced from an Indianapolis hospital to the game after his daughter was born, made it to the stadium 75 minutes before kickoff, then caught a 73-yard TD pass in the third quarter in another easy win. Hilton celebrated his big play by rocking the football like a baby. Hilton called Pagano early Sunday morning to let him know he might be late to the stadium. \n12. COLTS 17, TEXANS 10, Dec. 14, 2014: Wayne broke Indy’s franchise records for games played and wins on the same day the Colts clinched their second straight AFC South title. By making his 209th appearance and winning for the 142nd time in Indy, Wayne broke both of Peyton Manning’s records. Luck threw two TD passes and Vinatieri made a late field goal to clinch the win - and a home game in the playoffs. \n13. COLTS 27, TITANS 10, Dec. 28, 2014: Still perfect. Luck played one half and threw two touchdown passes as Indianapolis completed its second straight spotless season against the division. Wayne’s 80-yard catch allowed Luck to break Manning’s single-season franchise record for yards passing. Pagano joined Jim Harbaugh as the only NFL coaches to win 11 games in each of their first three seasons. \n14. COLTS 35, TITANS 33, Sept. 27, 2015: Luck got the first win of the season with a 98-yard touchdown drive, then threw for the go-ahead score 56 seconds later for Indy’s first win of the season. Indy was teetering after Tennessee rallied from a 14-0 deficit to take a 27-14 lead. But the Colts scored three TDs in the final 12 ½ minutes and the defense stopped a 2-point conversion run in the final minute to keep the streak intact. \n15. COLTS 16, JAGUARS 13 (OT), Oct. 4, 2015: The Colts didn’t need Luck in this one. With Luck on the sideline for the first time in his career, 40-year-old Matt Hasselbeck led the Colts on a 53-yard drive in overtime to set up Vinatieri’s 27-yard field goal with 4:36 to play. It was Hasselbeck’s first NFL start since November 2012 and he managed the game deftly. Vinatieri made three field goals, broke the Colts’ career scoring record and became the first player in league history to score 1,000 points with two teams.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T00:28:27.409+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
