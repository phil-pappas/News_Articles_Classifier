And then he actually praised Greg Hardy for his ... leadership?\nYou mean the same Greg Hardy who, in the decisive moments of a 27-20 loss to the Giants, seemed to scream in the face of anyone who got near him on the Dallas Cowboys sideline? The same Hardy who the Cowboys owner signed despite his history as a serial and unapologetic abuser?\nThe same Hardy who, not 15 minutes after Jones held him up as some great leader of men, addressed the media in a boorish, childish way ... which had the effect of forcing his teammates to explain his behavior that, on nearly every level, appeared inexplicable?\nBut here is what Jones said about his defensive end as he stood in a hallway outside the Cowboys locker room:\n\"He's, of course, one of the real leaders on this team and he earns it and he earns it with respect from all of his teammates and that's the kind of thing that inspires a football team.\"\nRELATED: Dallas DE Greg Hardy gives childish press conference after loss\nReal leaders. Inspires a football team. It sure looked as if Hardy was dressing down the Cowboys' special teams players after Dwayne Harris returned a kickoff for a Giants touchdown in the fourth quarter, not firing them up. Was Hardy also \"inspiring\" injured receiver Dez Bryant, who appeared to be trying to calm him down moments later?\nWhat a disaster. And, that this all unfolded at MetLife Stadium as the Giants threw a few more cans of gasoline on the fiery wreckage of this Cowboys season, made it easily the sweetest victory for this team in 2015.\nThe Giants, now 4-3 and back on top of the NFC East, still have their own problems. The Cowboys rushed for 233 yards against their porous defense and, had it not been for the quarterbacking incompetence of new Dallas starter Matt Cassel, the outcome might have been much different.\nStill: How could a Giants fan not delight in the unraveling in Dallas? This was the fourth straight loss since quarterback Tony Romo was sidelined with a fractured collarbone, and given the level of desperation, by far the worst. The Cowboys (2-4) play the Seahawks and the Eagles in the next two weeks before he is scheduled to return, which means a team with Super Bowl expectations could be D.O.A. before their real franchise leader throws another pass.\nBryant, at least, is expected to return next week, and that will help a team that still has one of the best offensive lines in the NFL. It isn't quite over yet for the Cowboys, but even Jones is realistic of their overcoming a challenge he called \"daunting.\"\n\"Well, I know that I was more confident that we could reach those goals when the season started than I am today,\" Jones said when asked if the high expectations were still attainable. \"We don't have much margin at all, and so we can't make mistakes with the make up of our roster right now. We're making mistakes, and it's beating us.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T07:53:51.700+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
