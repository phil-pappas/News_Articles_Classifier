It's time to see if Budweiser's parent company can get MillerCoors' parent to play ball.\nNothing to worry about. When it comes to courtship, the combination of desire, a lot of beer and closing time always works out for the best, right?\nBelgium-based Anheuser-Busch InBev, already the world's biggest brewer, faces a Wednesday deadline, per United Kingdom takeover rules.\nEither it makes a firm offer for its biggest global rival, London-based SABMiller allows it more time or it goes home alone, unable to make another pass for six months.\nSo, naturally, AB InBev is waving around some big bills, upping its offer to $108.2 billion a little more than two days ahead of the zero hour.\nThat's because for all the attention, and slavish devotion, accorded microbrews, the macro brands are macro for a reason. And it's not just to add more variety to the ads during sports shows touting erectile dysfunction cures, gambling sweepstakes you'll never win and 2016 model-year cars and trucks that will be recalled in 2017.\nAB InBev's arsenal includes Bud, Stella Artois, Michelob, Labatt, Rolling Rock, St. Pauli Girl and Goose Island. But it figures it can corner about a third of the planet's beer market and around half the profits if it can acquire SABMiller, home of brands such as Miller, Coors, Hamm's, Henry Weinhard's, Leinenkugel's, Pilsner Urquell and Blue Moon.\nSo its latest offer represents about a 48 percent premium on what SABMiller's share price was right before news broke of AB InBev's interest in mid-September.\nThat would go down smooth with a lot of investors, some of whom have been vexed that earlier bids were deemed too weak by the majority of SABMiller's board.\nAmong those eager to see SABMiller negotiate with AB InBev is Altria, the maker of Marlboro cigarettes, its largest stakeholder with 27 percent of the company. But many are looking at Colombia's Santo Domingo family, which has almost 14 percent of SABMiller, as a swing vote to get a deal in motion.\nThere are provisions for both the family and Altria in the latest AB InBev proposal to lessen the tax ramifications of the transactions, but it remains to be seen if the angled pour strikes the right balance.\nEven if SABMiller decides it's open to a deal, or at least to continuing the conversation a little longer, there will be plenty of unanswered questions.\nWhat gets sold off to make this rich, potentially overpowering blend palatable to regulators, not to mention paying down the debt run up?\nWill bigger truly be bigger in the years to come?\nIf the parent of St. Louis' Budweiser and the parent of Chicago-based MillerCoors get married, can all their brands live happily under one roof, like a brewery Brady Bunch?\nOr will someone's nose get bent out of shape before the big date, again like a brewery Brady Bunch?\nIf it can't turn SABMiller's head, it's not clear whether AB InBev should pop for another round.\nIt's not clear whether it's already offering too much, and anyone who says they know how, say, Anheuser-Busch's culture in St. Louis will mesh with that of MillerCoors is guessing at best.\nMaybe Anheuser-Busch InBev will realize it doesn't need any more beer and instead shops around for a hard liquor chaser. Maybe it will sit tight and not try to swallow more than it can handle.\nPlenty of businesses have been swept up in the excitement of romancing a potential acquisition only to wake up later to reality, regrets and a throbbing headache.\nMargin call: \"Junior Jamboree\" debuted on Chicago's WBKB-TV 68 years ago Tuesday, showcasing the genius of puppeteer Burr Tillstrom. The show's great virtue, the Tribune reported, was enabling a mother \"to prepare dinner without being interrupted.\" After going national as \"Kukla, Fran and Ollie,\" devotees would include James Thurber, Orson Welles and John Steinbeck.\nphilrosenthal@tribpub.com\nTwitter @phil_rosenthal\nCopyright Â© 2015, Chicago Tribune Anheuser-Busch InBev SABMiller Business Phil Rosenthal", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561c2752/turbine/ct-rosenthal-anheuser-busch-sabmiller-1013-biz-20151012"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:01:06.818+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
