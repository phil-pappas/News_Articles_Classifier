Umberger . \nUmberger didn't seem to be taking his probable first healthy scratch well. He definitely looked upset changing out of his hockey gear in silence. \nSchenn seemed to be in an OK mood, which is status quo for the easy going blueliner. \nLecavalier? \nHe looked and sounded bewildered about his predicament as a benched former star with a high cap hit who seemingly is untradeable. \nHis current mindset? \n\"It hasn't changed from the first game I got scratched, so there's nothing really to add,\" Lecavalier said. \"It is what it is. I'm doing everything I can to be ready. I'm in the same place as I was before the first game when he told me, so ...\" \nLecavalier was referring to new Flyers head coach Dave Hakstol. If you remember, Lecavalier was so upset about being a healthy scratch for 17 games last season — the first 17 of his career — that he admitted afterward that it was best if the Flyers get rid of him or Craig Berube. \nGM Ron Hextall fired Berube as head coach a week after the Flyers' non-playoff ended, then he spent another offseason trying hard to trade Lecavalier, who went into the 2015-16 season with three years to go on a five-year, $22.5 million contract that carries a $4.5 million cap hit. \nLecavalier seemed optimistic early in training camp that he'd get a chance to rebound from a career-worst 2014-15 season in which he scored just eight goals and 20 points in 57 games. \nAfter playing a lot last season as a fourth-line right wing, Lecavalier started this season back at his natural center spot and on a line with skilled forwards. \nIt didn't last even though Lecavalier scored a goal in his first preseason game. By late into camp, he was out of the mix with Hakstol deciding his team had a better shot of winning with others in the lineup. \n\" I thought my camp started off really well,\" Lecavalier said. \"I don't know what to say. It's the same thing as it was. It's frustrating. You want to play.\" \nAt this point, it appears Lecavalier won't have a shot to play unless the Flyers lose two forwards to injuries. Even then, it's possible Hextall would place someone on the IR and call up a forward from the AHL. \nLecavalier is miffed. He says he doesn't know what he needs to show Hakstol in practice to get a shot. \n\"No, we really haven't discussed that,\" he said. \"I don't know what to say, man. As a veteran guy, you want to start the year in the lineup and go from there. Hopefully soon.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T22:59:30.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
