So now, I’m asking for prayers. – A few months ago, after I was optioned to AAA, I found out I had a growth on my thyroid. Flying back & forth from Toronto to Buffalo after pitching to have more and more tests done it was finally concluded that the growth is considered malignant.. Meaning it contained the C word.. cancer. Hearing this was alarming, yea. Weird, yea, that too. I was given the option to shut my year down & get it removed immediately. However, seeing another doctor that determined I could wait until the end of the season reassured my gut feeling. Just Keep Playing. Baseball kept me sane. Regardless of results on the field, I forgot about it when I was between the lines. Afterall, I was just trying to get the heck out of AAA. & I did. I was revived with an opportunity, a blessing from God, with the Tigers back in the Big Leagues. So yea, the power of prayer.. It got me through this season. Now that it’s over it’s time to get this thing out, so please keep me in your thoughts & prayers as I undergo surgery & come out 100% cancer free! As always,,, #justkeeplivin\" A photo posted by Daniel Norris (@danielnorris18) on Oct 19, 2015 at 1:59pm PDT \nTigers general manager Al Avila told reporters that the team knew about Norris' cancer before trading for him and that the team expects him to make a full recovery and return by spring training. \nNorris pitched in 8 starts with the Tigers, posting a 3.68 ERA and 1.01 WHIP in 36.2 innings. He struck out 27 batters and walked seven. \nHe spent time on the disabled list with an oblique strain after he came to Detroit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T00:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:59:02.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
