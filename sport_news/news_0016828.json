Ron Kind is stepping up his pursuit of accountability for railroad companies that leave trains parked at crossings for hours on end. \nThe La Crosse Democrat fired off a letter Thursday asking for an official investigation of the practice by the U.S. Government Accountability Office. \nSuch a study could produce proof that parked trains have become a safety risk across the nation and provide the basis for federal officials to take action against railways or for Congress to pass legislation if needed allowing them to crack down. \n“Wisconsin has recently experienced a dramatic rise in rail traffic through our communities, and this has resulted in increased incidences of blocked grade crossings by trains,” Kind wrote in his letter. \n“These prolonged blocked crossings not only present a quality-of-life issue for people in the community due to impediments in the flow of basic traffic and commerce, but when emergency response vehicles are unable to pass, they turn into a serious public safety issue.” Buy Photo \nU.S. Rep.

They are often left sitting during crew shift changes. \nA Gannett Wisconsin Media investigation in August detailed the extent of the problem , including instances when residents resorted to hopping over stopped trains, crawling under them, handing children between rail cars and driving relatives on alternate roads to emergency rooms for fear ambulances would not get around a train in time to provide life-saving treatment. \nKind has sought help from the Federal Railroad Administration and Canadian National Railway, the dominant railroad in Wisconsin, but so far to no avail. His office said he has not received a reply to a letter he sent the company Sept. 10 asking how the railway plans to reduce the number of road-blockage incidences. \n“It is vital that Canadian National work with our communities and local authorities to reduce the serious public health risks posed by blocking grade crossings for extended periods of time,” he wrote. “I look forward to a timely response from you.” Buy Photo \nCars stopped on Main Street wait for a train to cross in Junction City on Thursday, Aug. 20, 2015.
