Comment Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 8:58 PM Updated at 10:38 PM Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 8:58 PM Updated at 10:38 PM UTICA Joe Cannata has his first American Hockey League shutout. Cannata stopped 30 shots and Brendan Gaunce, Blair Jones, Linden Vey and Hunter Shinkaruk each scored and the Utica Comets cruised past the Syracuse Crunch 4-0 on Saturday before 3,835 fans at Utica Memorial Auditorium. The Comets, who have sold out 18 consecutive home games, improved to 2-3-0-0 this season. \"(Cannata) played well right from the beginning and gave us confidence to take some chances and make some plays,\" said Jordan Subban, who had two assists. Jones and Vey each scored on the power play, giving the Comets four on the season. The Comets were perfect on the penalty kill, stopping six Crunch opportunities. Utica has allowed one goal on 22 power plays this season. \"This was exactly what we needed after (Friday's 1-0 loss),\" said Comets' head coach Travis Green. \"I can't say enough (about Cannata). He's been great.\" First period The Comets took a 2-0 into the first intermission on goals by Gaunce and Jones. Gaunce put the Comets up 1-0 about 4 minutes into the game off a rebound from an odd angle at the bottom of the left circle after Subban’s shot bounced off of Crunch goaltender Allen York. Jones added to the lead more than 7 minutes later. With the Comets on the power play, Jones scored from his knees off of Subban’s shot from the point. Second period Vey put Utica ahead 3-0 with about 5 minutes left in the period. With the Comets on the power play, Vey skated through the right circle and punched it past York for his first goal of the season. The Comets led 19-17 in shots after two periods. Third period Shinkaruk scored his fourth goal of the season less than 2 minutes into the period. Shinkaruk broke free on the left side, took a long pass from Wacey Hamilton on the right to beat York, who finished with 22 saves for the Crunch (2-3-0-0). The Comets have a three-game road trip next weekend. On Friday, they take on Binghamton. They play Albany on Saturday and Bridgeport on Sunday, Nov. 1.
