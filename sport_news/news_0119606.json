Brackett previously missed time with a knee injury. \nAccording to coach Mark Whipple, who's been predictably mum on his team's injury situations unless they involve season-ending consequences, said it's \"too early\" to know if either player will be ready to suit up against the Rockets. \nWhipple did, however, reiterate that he's not the type of coach that'll set a deadline for practice time and hold a player out of a game if he misses too many reps. If either Brackett or Seals can give the team even just a few snaps Saturday, Whipple will have them ready to contribute in limited roles. \nWhipple also touched on a number of other topics in his post-practice interview Wednesday, including Toledo's super-efficient running game and his own defense's lack of turnovers. \nCheck out the above video for Whipple's complete commentary. \nFollow MassLive.com UMass beat writer @Daniel_Malone on Twitter or reach him via email .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T01:54:21.686+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
