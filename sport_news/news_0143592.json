Ryan also said wide receiver Percy Harvin (hip/personal), defensive tackle Kyle Williams (knee), running back Karlos Williams (concussion) and offensive tackle Seantrel Henderson (concussion) will not play against the Jaguars. That means the Bills will need only one more inactive player for the game Sunday.\nIt also means EJ Manuel will be the Bills' starting quarterback Sunday. It will be his second-straight start for the Bills. Taylor is dealing with a sprained MCL but will have the Week 8 bye week to get healthy heading into the second half of the season. Bills coach Rex Ryan said Taylor was sore after practice Wednesday, so the Bills decided it was best to shut him down.\n\"I'm not going to force him out there when he's not fully healed,\" Ryan said.\nSo the Bills will have to wait until at least Week 9 to get their starting quarterback back in the lineup.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T21:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:40:27.166+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
