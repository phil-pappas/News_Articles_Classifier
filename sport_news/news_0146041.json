Join the Conversation Flyer Files Dave Isaac , @davegisaac 1:28 p.m. EDT October 8, 2015 \nT AMPA After parts of nine seasons with the Flyers, Tampa Bay Lightning defenseman Braydon Coburn couldn't help but to keep half an eye on what his old team was doing even as his new one is becoming a powerhouse in the NHL's Eastern Conference. \n\"I still have friends and buddies and people that I care about over there, but it’s a lot of fun when you get a chance to play your old team,\" Coburn said. \"I’m excited. I was at Luke Schenn’s wedding over the summer and I was telling the guys how excited I am to be able to play against those guys. This will be fun.\" \nCoburn admitted he wasn't surprised when the Flyers canned Craig Berube at the end of last season, hiring Dave Hakstol from the NCAA ranks to move the team forward. That's just the way things are in Philadelphia. Coburn saw it in his near decade with the Flyers. \n\"You hear all the chatter and you guys (in the media) talking and everything like that, but I was really lucky,\" Coburn said. \"My stretch in Philly, we had great coaches. From (John) Stevens, (Peter) Laviolette, Chief, I've got nothing but great things to say about those men.\" 5 things to watch in Game 1: Flyers at Tampa Bay \nHe also has great things to say about Tampa. The Flyers traded him there on the eve of last season's trading deadline, getting Radko Gudas and a first-round pick (that was traded up to Toronto to select Travis Konecny) in return. \nCoburn had some time to get adjusted right off the bat, breaking his foot in his fourth game with the Lightning. He returned for the Lightning's 26 playoff games, ultimately losing in Game 6. After a summer to adjust, and selling his Haddonfield home, Coburn feels like a Floridian. \n\"I guess. As much as a Saskatchewan kid can get adjusted,\" he joked. \"It’s been a good adjustment for me. Wife and kids and everybody have enjoyed their time down here.\" \nPlus, no tough winters. \n\"From where I grew up,\" he quipped, \"Philly’s not much of a winter either.\" \nTouchè. \nBut he's happy to see his old team in the first game of the season. \n\"It will be a little weird I think,\" Coburn said. \"It’s kind of always a weird feeling. I don’t know, it’s the first game of the year, the home opener. I thought it was just perfect that we were playing the Flyers.\" \nHis coach, Jon Cooper, doesn't see it as a walk in the park against a Flyers club that didn't make the playoffs last season for the second time in three years. \n\"The one thing is…they’ve got a boatload of skill,\" Cooper said. \"Claude Giroux, to me, is a top-five player in the league. He’s just a threat all over the ice. They’ve got grit. (Wayne) Simmonds is a really hard player to play against. (Jake) Voracek is one of those where he’s always been a really good player and now he’s a great player. Their power play is dazzling. You have to make sure you can’t put them on the power play. if we want a chance to win, we’ve got to limit our penalties. We found that out last year when we went into their building and they did a good number on us.\" \nIn that last year, Coburn and the Lightning have become somewhat of the team to beat. It's one of the tougher hands the Flyers could have been dealt on opening night, but Tampa isn't acting like it already has its ticket punched to the Stanley Cup finals again. \n\"Two years ago, it was a little bit more of ‘us against the world’ type attitude where no one really cared about us,\" Cooper said. \"Now it’s a little different because it’s eyes wide open now. We’re not sneaking up on anybody. It ultimately is a different type of feeling for us, but one that we’re embracing and are excited about.\" \nDave Isaac; (856) 486-2479; disaac@gannettnj.com.
