The program had been cut in the schools budget for the 2014-2015 academic year, officials said. School officials reinstated the program this week using savings from other budget line items, School Committee Vice Chairman Thomas J. Minichiello Jr. said. “We reorganized the elementary schools, the Raymond was no longer K-8, there was funding available from the savings from that program,” Minichiello said. “We also shortened the sport schedule from 10 games to eight games per sport and in doing so, the stipends for the coaches were correspondingly lowered.” Minichiello said he and other city officials heard from several parents and constituents after the program was cut last year. He’s glad the program has been reinstated. “It really brings about school spirit and it’s also a great tool for teachers, principals, assistant principals to motivate students,’ Minichiello said. About 700 Brockton students in sixth, seventh and eighth grades take part in middle school sports, said Nick Lee, director of physical education, K-12, for Brockton Public Schools. The program has an annual budget of between $150,000 to $200,000 per school year that includes referee and coach salaries, equipment, buses, and any training, Lee said. The program includes girls and boys soccer and cross-country in the fall; girls and boys basketball in the winter, and volleyball, baseball and softball in the spring. Lee, a Brockton native, remembers when the program was cut when he was in seventh grade at the former Whitman Elementary School – and he’s glad the program is back this year. “It does mean a lot and it meant a lot when I was there, so I can understand how these kids feel,” said Lee, 37.
