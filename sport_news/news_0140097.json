The biggest thing is he has gotten back healthy. He missed just about all of camp and came back right before the first game. He's just been gaining confidence. I think Tony (Elliott) has been gaining confidence in him as well. He got a little bit more action yesterday and did a great job. Right now, he's definitely the first guy in (behind Gallman). It's hard to play five. We have confidence in all of them, but with where we are right now with Wayne, we're kind of feeding him. Zac is the next man up, and we go from there, but all those guys, we feel like can win for us and will win for us before this year is out.\" \nHow important was it to play well in all three phases? \n\"It's not just Notre Dame. It was Louisville, too. We had a 20-10 lead with nine minutes and something to go in the fourth quarter, and the crowd is out of it, and we gave up a kickoff return. One play changes everything, and they got back in it. Same thing last week - we had a 21-3 lead with a great defense and next thing you know, you're fighting for your life. So that was good to see. We had opportunities against Notre Dame in all three phases to put the game away, and nobody did it. That was a big part of what we wanted to improve. We knew we were in control, and we said, 'Let's get in the left lane and let it eat. Let's not let up here. Let's put somebody away.' It doesn't matter where it comes from but we have to take advantage of opportunities and we did that. Every time they would make a little spark play we would answer. That was good to see yesterday.\" \nThird down efficiency is great. How big is that? \n\"It's huge when you can stop people. When you can keep people out of the end zone, it's a higher percentage of winning. A great defense never goes into a slump. It's always there. If you show up and play great defense, you always have a chance. Offensively you can have some good days and bad days, but if you play great defense, you always have a chance. And we pride ourselves on the type of defense that we play. What y'all are seeing is what we expected as far as the production of our first group. We're still a growing team, and we're still developing other guys. You may not see it on game day just yet, but we see it on the practice field. We're a different makeup on the defensive side, but we're still a really good group and we felt like we would. We'll see how it all plays out.\" \nCan running game and defense carry you? \n\"I think that just speaks to the core of what we want to be. We want to always run the ball effectively and be a great defense. That is something that was a huge emphasis coming into this year - we wanted to be better and we felt we would be better. It allows you to create explosive plays when you can dictate the run. It allows you to dictate to the opponent. When you're averaging five yards a carry, you're dictating to them. That's one of the key reasons we had so many explosive plays. They took some chances. It's really the first game where we've had opportunities to win a lot of one-on-one coverage. It was good to see a lot of guys make plays and win their matchup. For Deshaun to make some good throws, we had some really good protection. It was great to get a lot of people involved like we want to and do it with the balance that we want.\" \nWhat is basis of one-game season mentality? \n\"Yes. That's just a mentality we try to incorporate with all our guys here. Everybody wants to talk about the next game or last week's game. For us, it's just a mentality we subscribe to. We go back and prepare each and every week. It's all hands on board. Everyone puts everything they've got into that game. We just try to do that each and every week. They're all huge. Some games have more juice to them as far the media, but for us coaches and us players we all understand the margin for error is so small. You don't get mulligans. Every week. We can be beaten by anybody. We think we can beat anybody but can be beaten by anybody. We just keep the mentality the same, and we prepare the same. You create the mentality the same. We build consistency in preparation. It's not coach-speak. We try to walk the walk. There is not a bigger game on our schedule than Boston College. All we have to do is try to be better than them this week. That is what our focus is on.\" \nHave you ever been involved in a game where you were this dominant on both lines of scrimmage? \n\"No. That might be the lowest total ever for Paul Johnson. I just can't overstate that. 71 yards rushing against a triple option team; it's just amazing the way our guys played and handled the line of scrimmage. We leveraged the football. There was just nowhere to go. Our speed showed up. They couldn't run at us and couldn't get around us. They tried everything. When they can't block you, it's hard to be effective. That was the story of the day. We just won in the trenches. And we have all the respect in the world for Georgia Tech. Those guys know what they are doing. The discipline, the precision in execution, the effort, the toughness and the physicality that our defense displayed was a thing of beauty. It was spectacular.\" \nWhat about Boston College's defense? \n\"Not real hard to see that they're very good. Just turn the tape on. Our guys know ball, and they know good players. Watch BC, it's the same. Everyone on our team in that game last year, they know we were fortunate to win that game. We made a big play late in that game. And they missed a couple of plays. That game was a tight ballgame. They did some things to our defense not a lot of people did. They're as physical a group as we've seen. They've given up just one offensive touchdown in the ACC. This is a tough, tough challenge for us. It might be 2-0. Who knows? They just played in a 3-0 game. It's a big challenge for both our offense and defense.\" \nDid it feel good to finally address the Clemsoning thing? \n\"I don't have any more to say about all that stuff. I am not getting into that stuff anymore because it's just ridiculous. We're just going to keep doing what we do and graduate our players. We'll let everybody else push whatever agenda they want.\" Rate this Story: Send Feedback to Nikki Hood: Email | Comment", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:01:13.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
