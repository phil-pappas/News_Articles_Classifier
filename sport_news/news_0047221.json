The freshman defensive lineman caught the ball after teammate John Dunkerton tipped the pass. The next turning point for the Eastern Alamance football team came in the fourth quarter when Mark Law blocked a punt on fourth-and-41 from midfield. Quarterback John Lamot eventually finished the ensuing possession with one of his four touchdown runs. On the kickoff, Western Alamance’s Preston Tootle waited for the ball to roll out of bounds. It never did, and Eastern Alamance’s Tra Boseman recovered at the 1-yard line. Lamot scored on a 6-yard run, giving the Eagles their first lead since the first quarter. Then for some cushion, Eastern Alamance’s Bryce Ballard — victimized by a few vicious stiff-arms in the first half — picked off a pass and returned it 37 yard for a touchdown. Eastern Alamance’s defense forced a turnover on downs, and Lamot ran in his final touchdown. Phew. Five straight touchdowns in 12 minutes, 41 seconds of wildness to give host Eastern Alamance a 48-37 victory Friday night against cross-county rival Western Alamance and put the Eagles (8-0 overall, 5-0 Mid-State 3-A Conference) in the driver’s seat for a second straight league crown. “Big-time teams, we don’t give up. Last week we were beating Northern (Guilford) and they would not give up. That’s a state-championship type team, we just found the fire behind us and wouldn’t give up,” said Lamot, who ran for 184 yards. “We had a homecoming, so we couldn’t give up. And that’s not what Eastern does.” Forgive Lamot for forgetting that the victory against Northern Guilford came Monday night. But it might feel like a week passed just in Friday night’s game alone, with these evenly matched programs trading blows. And perhaps that’s truer for Lamot than anyone else, because the senior quarterback and reigning Times-News Offensive Player of the Year made his debut on defense as a safety, and provided a game-changing element there, too. Western Alamance (5-2, 3-1) built a 23-13 lead by halftime, led by McCollum’s 33- and 30-yard passing touchdowns to Darius Pinnix and an 11-yard run by McCollum. Pinnix had eight catches for 181 yards and 10 carries for 66 yards, while McCollum threw for 290 yards and rushed for 74, scoring three times on the ground. The lead grew to 30-13 when Eastern Alamance’s Mack Miles fumbled the second-half kickoff. Lamot was picked off for the third time on the next drive — for the second time by Perry Greeson, with Keonte Anilus snagging the other — and the Warriors drove to the Eagles’ 4-yard line before Kingsley’s momentus snag. Page 2 of 2 - “Felt great, felt great when I just saw the end zone. If the pass wasn’t blocked, I wouldn’t have caught the ball,” said Kingsley, the 14-year-old from Nigeria who relished the first time this year he has been able to run with the ball by scorching down the home sideline. Western Alamance moved backward after reaching the 19-yard line on the ensuing possession, the result of a bad snap and a 17-yard holding penalty. “We killed ourselves. We made mistakes. I’m not discrediting them, but I feel like we score there (before Kingsley’s interception) it’s a whole different ballgame. We know that and they know that,” Western Alamance coach Jeff Snuffer said. “But at the same time, they made plays while we kept making mistakes. We’ve got to correct our mistakes.” Lamot’s 1-yard sneak brought the score to 30-27 with 7:13 left. Then came the strangest play of the night. Tootle stood on the goal line while the ball rolled at least 10 yards, the oblong object stubbornly refusing to hop onto the out-of-bounds line. Boseman recovered, sending the home crowd further into pandemonium. “That ball was tailing to go out of bounds,” Eastern Alamance coach John Kirby said. “I was thinking, ‘Don’t go out of bounds.’ If that goes out of bounds, who knows what happens.” It didn’t, and Lamot charged into the front corner of the end zone for the Eagles’ first lead since 7-6. Ballard’s interception on the next possession provided cushion, and was redeeming for the senior. He was matched up against Pinnix for much of the first half before moving to safety in the second half. “They were picking on me a little bit in the first half, but we came back out in the second half and responded,” Ballard said. “John (Lamot) was on (Pinnix), (defensive backs) Coach (Patrick) Stokes had me playing safety, so I just read the ball in the air, read the quarterback’s eyes and jumped the route.” Lamot’s last touchdown made it 48-30 with 1:54 left, all but preserving Eastern Alamance’s unbeaten season. McCollum scored with 42 seconds left. “I felt like we needed to get that fourth down, and we got it. I’m proud of the team,” Kingsley said.
