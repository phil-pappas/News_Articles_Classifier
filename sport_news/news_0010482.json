(Tim Ireland | The Associated Press) Comments \nLondon â€” Rex Ryan was at it again on Sunday. Ryan likes to get creative with his choices for captain, and when the Buffalo Bills got set for the coin toss at Wembley Stadium in London for their Week 7 game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Ryan took it to a new level. \nBack in January, Doug Marrone opted out of his contract as head coach of the Bills and became the Jacksonville Jaguars' offensive line coach. So in typical Ryan fashion, he had his five starting offensive lineman head to midfield for the con toss as the Bills' captains. \nMost Bills players tried to pretend that playing against their old coach was a non-factor in this game. However, some admitted to using Marrone as bulletin board material throughout the week, and the smile on quarterback EJ Manuel's face when asked about the coach who benched him made it clear it was on his mind. \nAs for Marrone, he was the field during pre-game warmups for only about 10 minutes. He didn't do much catching up with old Bills players or coaches and kept a relatively low profile.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T16:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T21:20:32.962+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
