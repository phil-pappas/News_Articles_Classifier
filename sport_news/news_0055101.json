Comment By Bethany College Athletic Information McPhersonSentinel - McPherson, KS By Bethany College Athletic Information Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 7:00 AM By Bethany College Athletic Information Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 7:00 AM LINDSBORG — It took a long time for the Bethany College men's soccer team to convert a quality chance Wednesday evening against Friends University. But, as the old saying goes, \"It's better late than never.\" Head men's soccer coach Shane Taylor would agree with that saying and apply it to the Swedes 1-0 win over the Falcons. For all but seven minutes the Swedes and Friends University were locked in a 0-0 tie. But, in the 83rd minute of the contest, Luis Fernando Pinto dribbled up the right side of the field, was able to stop and allow defenders to go by, and pass the ball to the middle to Alex Clark. Clark settled it off his chest and put a good shot past the Falcons goalkeeper. The goal was all Bethany needed as the Swedes back line was up to the task all night. \"We are proud of the way we played tonight and how we stuck together,\" Taylor said. \"Our entire back line led by Angelo Alessi played extremely well and deserves credit for the win. Pinto made a tremendous play to assist Alex (Clark) on a clinical finish. It was great team effort today leading to our team win.\" Bethany Women get 3-0 Shutout The Bethany College women's soccer team continued their strong play as of late, by beating Friends University 3-0. The win over the Falcons was the third in four games for the Swedes, the only other game was a 1-1 tie against (RV) Kansas Wesleyan University. The Swedes started fast and wouldn't let the Falcons back in it. Sarah Henderson added to her team leading goal total with a blast past the goalie within the first 15 minutes of the contest. Christina Noonan played a great ball to Henderson and Henderson put the Swedes up 1-0. Late in the first half, Nichole Washburn played a ball to the middle of the field, Katie Snyder ran it down, and extended the Swedes lead to 2-0 with a lob just over the Friends goalkeeper's head. The goal was not only Snyder's first of the season, but also the first goal of her career. Just 15 minutes into the second half, Arianna Anaya found Henderson again and she put another ball past the Friends goalkeeper, for her second goal of the night. The goal was the Swedes third of the game and they led 3-0. \"I am very proud of the team today,” head coach John Markey said. “They stepped up in an important game and beat a very good KCAC opponent. Hats off to Coach Hobson, he and his team are having a good season so far. The win needs to be credited a lot to the leadership and consistency from Sarah Henderson who continues to create goal scoring chances for herself and her teammates. Also, of course our defense and goalkeeper need to get recognition for getting another shut out today.\" By Bethany College Athletic Information McPhersonSentinel - McPherson, KS By Bethany College Athletic Information Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 7:00 AM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:59:43.560+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
