And Lacy still believes he's the same player who set Green Bay Packers records for most total touchdowns (24) and rushing yards (2,317) in his first two NFL seasons. \nFor whatever reason, though, Packers head coach Mike McCarthy feels differently. And week-by-week, the mystery of Lacy's playing time grows. \nLacy had just four carries for three yards Sunday in Green Bay's 27-20 win over San Diego. Prior to Sunday, the fewest carries Lacy has had when playing a full game was 10. \nLacy is now averaging 43.3 yards per game, which would amount to 693 for the season. During Lacy's first two seasons, he averaged 74.7 rushing yards per game and 1,159 rushing yards per year. \n\"I'm here to contribute, whether its 43 yards per game or 100 yards a game,\" said Lacy, who also had a fumble that could have been deadly had teammate T.J. Lang not recovered. \n\"At the end of the game, as long as we have a 'W' and we continue to move forward winning the game, that's the main goal.\" \nPackers No. 2 running back James Starks had 10 carries for 112 yards, highlighted by a dazzling 65-yard touchdown run and the first two-touchdown game of his career. While Starks sizzled, Lacy fizzled in what's becoming a bigger story by the week. \nLacy left Green Bay's Week 2 win over Seattle after spraining his ankle in the first quarter. But Lacy returned for the Packers' Week 3 game against Kansas City, and had 41 carries for 156 yards over the next three games (3.8). \nThe possibility exists that Lacy's ankle is far worse than he and the Packers are letting on. \nAfter the Chargers game, few people had answers about what is going on with Green Bay's standout running back. \n\"I have no idea, man,\" Packers left guard Josh Sitton said. \n\"You can't expect a guy like Eddie every single time to do what he's done,\" center Corey Linsley said. \"People want to hold him to the expectation that he's always going to play to his highest level every game. \n\"You know what, maybe something is bugging him. There's all kinds of things it could be. There could be distractions. The greatest thing about that is he can have games like this and that's motivation for him to perform even better and kind of re-establish the level he's always been at.\" \nAgainst San Diego, though, Starks opened with the No. 1 offense and played 30 snaps. Lacy had just 21 snaps. \nPrior to Sunday, Lacy was averaging 39.0 snaps and Starks was at 26.3 in games they both played the entire way. \n\"It's really that we're a one-two punch team,\" Packers coach Mike McCarthy said. \"It's really no different than the way we've operated. We went with James first frankly because he's been playing extremely well and Eddie's been a little banged up.\" \nLacy's role as a pass catcher has also been reduced. Lacy averaged 2.63 receptions last season and is averaging just 1.5 catches per game in 2015. He also has just one total touchdown in 2015 after scoring 13 touchdowns in 2014 and 11 in 2013. \n\"It's the NFL,\" Lacy said. \"Every game's not going to be a hundred yards. It's just the way it is. \n\"Starks started off and he comes out with a big run right out of the gate, it's hard to shut that down. You want to keep going and get what you can get out of it, and he kept rolling.\" \nThe Packers are fortunate to have a No. 2 running back like Starks. \nStarks was a Super Bowl hero in 2010 and Green Bay's leading rusher in 2011. There are also just nine players on the active roster that have been Packers longer than Starks. \nStarks' 65-yard touchdown run Sunday was a thing of beauty. Starks ran into a wall off left tackle, spun back to the right, picked up a huge block from Jeff Janis and outraced a bevy of Chargers to the end zone. \nThat was Green Bay's longest touchdown run in nearly seven years. And Starks' average of 11.2 yards per carry Sunday is the highest by an NFL back with at least 10 carries this season. \n\"When I spun, I felt like there was no one over there,\" Starks said. \"I saw daylight and I ran to daylight. The next thing you know, it's more open than I thought it would be.\" \nAfterward, many wondered if Starks had supplanted Lacy as the Packers' No. 1 back. None of the Packers were saying that, but carries tell the true story. And when Green Bay returns from the bye week, all eyes will be on the running backs and their respective workloads. \n\"That's my little brother,\" Starks said of Lacy. \"We only wish the best for each other and we grind together. It's a long season. We're going to try to make the most out of it.\" \nThis story appeared in Packer Plus Magazine.
