When the fan asks, \"Can I talk to you,\" the officer puts one arm around the back of his neck and walks him away, prompting the fan to yell, \"Stop it!\" and try to pry away the officer's arm.\nSomeone appears to grab the phone being used to record the incident, yelling, \"Put the phone down!\" The video then cuts to another angle, which shows the officer picking up the fan and then body-slamming him to the ground before sitting on his back and cuffing his hands. The officer then pulls the fan to his feet and walks him away.\nA police spokeswoman, Sonya Toler, declined to offer further details, including the name of the officer and whether the fan involved was arrested.\n\"This was just brought to our attention,\" she said. \"We must investigate before anything is determined.\"\nThe Chicago website Sports Mockery posted a message from the alleged fan, named Dmitri, who claimed the incident occurred after he was ushered away from his seat following a verbal confrontation with a Pittsburgh fan.\nThe statement claimed the officer grabbed him in the concourse and attempted to put him in a chokehold. The fan said he was not arrested but suffered some injuries and is considering pressing charges against the officer, according to the website.\nThe Pirates lost the one-game wild card matchup against the Cubs, who moved on and are now tied 1-1 in their five-game division series with the St. Louis Cardinals.\n Baseball Live:\nPittsburgh officer's body slam of Cubs fan prompts investigation 0\nConfident\nInside ", "external_links": ["http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/9DzlWSGTkYg", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T23:31:55.981+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
