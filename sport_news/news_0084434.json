It's something we bring a lot of energy to,\" Parkland junior midfielder Rachel Medlar said. \"Then with our friends and family that came out, it really just got us ready to play.\" \nThe Trojans proved they were prepared on Wednesday as they opened up a one-goal halftime lead into a convincing 5-0 road victory. \nRELATED: Parkland doesn't need top scorer to handle Whitehall \nWithout top scorer Brooke Schutter in the lineup, Parkland spread around the scoring with junior forward Chelsea Hudson getting two goals and Medlar tallying the game's first goal. The Trojans also got goals from Ava Hanna and Jenn Guetzlaff . \n\"We've known that Whitehall's really be doing well this season,\" Medlar said. \"We knew they would be our toughest competition so far. We just worked really well together up top today. We were very unselfish so that was the best thing that we did. We don't care who scores as long as we get the job done.\" \nThe impressive victory sent a message to the Lehigh Valley soccer scene that most everybody already knew. Like usual, Parkland is very good. \n\"I think we just came out with our heads on straight, looking to just dominate and really send a message to the rest of the teams. We wanted to show them that we're serious about being in this and we have high goals for our team,\" Hudson said. \nBut as the Trojans found out last season, beating Whitehall in the regular season doesn't always guarantee titles. \n\"We beat Whitehall three times last year and then lost a very critical one. One was for a championship that we won but then getting knocked out of the districts,\" Parkland coach Al Haddad said. \"This one means something right now but tomorrow it doesn't.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T10:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:35:54.124+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
