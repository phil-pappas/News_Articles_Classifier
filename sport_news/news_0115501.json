Gutierrez helps boost Bucs By JIM FRANZ Sports editor beloitdailynews.com | 0 comments BELOIT — Jose Gutierrez buried a shot into the net Saturday to boost his Beloit College soccer team to a 1-0 overtime victory over Illinois College. It was a moment the former Beloit Memorial High School standout cherished, but frankly expected to experience a lot more during his freshman season. “The biggest adjustment I had to make was coming from a team that was used to winning to a team that still has a lot of improving to do,” Gutierrez said. That improving has already started to take place. While better days are definitely ahead for Gutierrez and the young Buccaneers, they have already made some significant strides in 2015. The past two seasons, Beloit was only 2-29-2 overall and 3-16-1 in the Midwest Conference. With three league games yet to play, the Bucs are 4-8-1 overall and 3-4 in the MWC. What’s more, they’ve been extremely competitive. They’ve lost by a single goal five times. “We’ve been down the past few years, but this recruiting class has made a huge step in the right direction and Jose is a big part of that,” Beloit head coach Tim Schmiechen said, “We’re competitive with all the teams in the league and again Jose is a big factor. He has started most of the games and having watched him a lot in high school, he’s doing for us what he did for the Knights. He’s very exciting on offense. His speed and his soccer ability are outstanding.” Even with Gutierrez around, scoring has still been an issue, but the team has already surpassed last season’s total of 11 goals. The Bucs have 13 this fall, while allowing 21. They’ve lost 1-0 twice and been shut out four times. Gutierrez vows that trend will end soon. “We had our last home game Sunday and we honored our seniors and we only have a handful,” Gutierrez said. “We have a good core of younger players returning with a lot of offensive potential. I’m confident about our future.” It has been a little frustrating at times. Gutierrez’s prep team scored goals in bunches and he was often the one putting it in the net or making the pass that produced the goal. With the Bucs, he has scored only two goals and assisted on two others. A terrific finisher for the Purple Knights, his shooting percentage is just .077 (2-26) as a collegiate. “It’s been a transition for me and for a lot of the other younger guys,” Gutierrez said. “The defenders are quicker and more athletic. It’s not like you can just dribble between five guys and get a shot off like in high school. Everything in college is contested. I was used to seeing five or six goals a game in high school. Now it’s so intense you’re lucky to see a couple.” Schmiechen said Gutierrez isn’t alone making the transition. “Freshmen like Jose are playing against guys three or four years older,” he said. “They’re bigger and stronger than the guys they’re used to facing. Jose was one of the best high school players in (Wisconsin) last year, but he can’t blow by defenders like in high school and he doesn’t have the space to operate he used to have. He has to play quicker and learn where his opportunities are. He’s staying optimistic and he’s very positive. “I’m very confident he and his teammates will learn from this season and will continue to grown and improve next year.” That’s certainly Gutierrez’s plan. He said he’ll help out with soccer recruiting as much as he can once the season ends, but he also has another sport he plans on competing in for the Bucs. “I’m looking forward to indoor and outdoor track,” said Gutierrez, who was a standout sprinter and hurdler for the Knights.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T00:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T09:39:28.105+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
