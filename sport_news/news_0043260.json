(WVUE) - Mayor Mitch Landrieu and New Orleans Police Department Superintendent Michael Harrison are in Washington, D.C. Thursday for a violent crime summit.\nThe mayor and the chief were invited by U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. It is a summit being hosted by the U.S. Justice Department.\nWhile in the nation's capital, the New Orleans city leaders will strategize with other law enforcement officials, as well as federal, state and local government leaders, hoping to come up with ways to help prevent violent crimes from happening back home.\nThis summit comes after several armed robberies at popular Uptown businesses, followed by two more at a Mid-City school, and a Subway restaurant.\nIn a statement the mayor released on the summit he said, \"Violent crime is a senseless epidemic in this country and it is senselessly taking too many loved ones from their families.\"\nThose are sentiments shared by people who were affected by the recent violence.\nPolice have ramped up efforts to keep citizens safe after the string of crimes.\n\"We had had few guests in the restaurant. The guys came in came out, really quick, took everybody's money, and the little bit of money that we had in the restaurant,\" said Chef Chris Lynch of Atchafalaya restaurant The police were here quickly and were here for the next few hours.\"\nHarrison said the NOPD is taking a \"daily, relentless\" to making the city safer for the people who live here and the thousands of annual visitors.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE .
