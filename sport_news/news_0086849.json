Pic/Getty Images \nThe former England captain's phones were hacked \"all the time, over and over again\" as part of investigations around stories about the star, former News of the World news editor Greg Miskiw told Channel 4 News.\nMiskiw, 65, was jailed for six months last year when, along with others, he admitted one general count of conspiring together and with others to illegally access voicemails between October 2000 and August 2006.\nHe told the broadcaster: \"We hacked David Beckham's phones routinely, all the time, over and over again.\"\nNo major proof found \nReferring to an alleged affair by the footballer, which Beckham has denied, Miskiw added: \"The David Beckham story, we had to track all these phones. From recollection (on that particular story) I don't think we got anything of any significance from doing Beckham's phones.\"\nIt is the first public admission that the star's phones were hacked by journalists. Miskiw told the programme he was deeply sorry for damaging the lives of hacking victims. \"If I'm a prince of darkness then I'm one of several princes.\nI'm more of a duke,\" he said. Media reform campaigners Hacked Off said what victims of phone hacking and \"other forms of press abuse\" have always wanted is not journalists going to jail or newspapers closing, but \"the full truth to come out\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:56:20.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
