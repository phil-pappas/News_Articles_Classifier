Grace puts pressure on Americans 1 / 1 Back to Gallery Incheon, South Korea\nBranden Grace delivered two big shots in gathering darkness Saturday that kept the International team within one point of the Americans going into a final day at the Presidents Cup that finally has some drama.\nThe Americans have a 91/2-81/2 lead with 12 singles matches remaining, the smallest margin going into Sunday in 10 years at this event.\nThat's what the International team wanted — and needed — in the Presidents Cup. The Americans have won the gold trophy five straight times, and the lone International victory was in 1998 in Australia.\nThe duo of Grace and Louis Oosthuizen have been the driving force for captain Nick Price . They became the first International tandem to go 4-0 in team matches.\nJordan Spieth also won two matches Saturday, making two clutch putts in morning foursomes, and holing a bunker shot in the afternoon fourballs. Spieth was 8 under on his own ball. Phil Mickelson and Zach Johnson never trailed in their fourballs victory at Jack Nicklaus Golf Club Korea .\nBae Sang-moon and Hideki Matsuyama , who earned a key half-point in the morning, had the shortest match of the week when they beat Jimmy Walker and Chris Kirk , 6 and 5, in fourballs.\nChampions: Kenny Perry shot a 4-under 68 in the rain to take a one-stroke lead after two rounds in the SAS Championship. Joe Durant was second after a 68, and first-round leader Bernhard Langer (73) was another stroke back along with Lee Janzen (68).\nLPGA: Jessica Korda took a two-stroke lead in the LPGA Malaysia, shooting a bogey-free 6-under 65 in sweltering conditions.\nEuropean: Matthew Fitzpatrick shot a 3-under 68 to maintain a share of the lead after the third round of the British Masters.", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/52/8772245/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/35/52/8772245/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-11T06:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:06:44.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
