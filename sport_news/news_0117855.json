(Photo: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports) Story Highlights The Bills played two preseason games in Europe back in the early 1990s, one in London, one in Berlin. It has taken one air freight, one ocean freight, and two chartered planes to get the Bills set up in London. 185 CONNECT 17 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nLONDON - There's a good chance that you've never heard of Kevin Meganck, but this week, he's one of the most valuable people in the Buffalo Bills organization. \nLeSean McCoy may rush for 100 yards and a couple of touchdowns when the Bills take on Jacksonville Sunday at Wembley Stadium. And if Mario Williams is allowed to pass rush, perhaps he'll ring up a sack or two against Jaguars quarterback Blake Bortles. But no one wearing Bills gear will have done more to make sure this trip is a success than Meganck, the team's director of football operations. \nAs you might imagine, moving an entire football operation overseas for a full week is a bit more complicated than flying down to the Meadowlands to play the Jets. The amount of game-planning, and then the ultimate execution of that game plan, makes what Rex Ryan and his coaches do all week seem like third-grade math for an eighth-grader. Postcards from London: You're going the wrong way! \nTeam president Russ Brandon assembled a group from One Bills Drive to pull off this monumental task, and many had a major role including chief administrator officer David Wheat, Sara Petrone (project coordinator for business development), Erica Muhleman (vice president, corporate sales), Greg Estes (video director) and Dan Evans (vice president, information technology) to name a few. But Meganck has been the point person since late last year when the Bills first learned they had been selected to play in one of the three London games being staged by the NFL in 2015. \n\"He was in on many things; Kevin did a great job, he was awesome, but this was the true definition of a team effort,\" Brandon said Tuesday night while dining at a sponsors dinner. \"It was an unbelievable undertaking and a true testament to the great work of all our people.\" \nThe level of detail and planning is astounding, and it included two early shipments of supplies — one via ocean freight, one via air freight — and two chartered jets. The first charter departed Sunday night following the Bills' 34-21 loss to Cincinnati and was populated by players, coaches, and key personnel. The second plane leaves Buffalo Wednesday and will carry anyone else in the organization who is coming — the entire work force was invited by Terry and Kim Pegula — and sponsors and guests of the team. \nGeneral view of billboard at Wembley Stadium promoting three games in this year's NFL International Series. (Photo: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports) \n\"I like to consider myself a fairly detailed person so I enjoy a challenge, but it definitely was quite a project,\" said Meganck, who has worked for the Bills for 12 years in a variety of roles. \"Early in my career when I was a scouting assistant I ran our training camp for two or three years, so I have experience with that and I had an idea of what some of the departments were looking for and how something like this should run.\" “I like to consider myself a fairly detailed person so I enjoy a challenge, but it definitely was quite a project.” Kevin Meganck, Bills director of football operations \nThe first step was to figure out where the Bills would be staying, and of course practicing. There was a trip to London early this year to scout out all of the facilities that the NFL offers as options, and after visiting four, the Bills settled on a spectacular venue called The Grove, which was formerly a mansion on an estate in the rolling countryside hills of Chandlers Cross, Watford, Hertfordshire. \nThe Grove was home base for England's national soccer team for its workouts prior to the World Cup in 2014, and that was one of the selling points for the Bills, the fact that the practice field was right on the premises. \nTeams that don't spend the entire week here, such as the Jaguars who are arriving in London Thursday, don't necessarily need a practice field at their lodging site because they'd only need transportation to conduct one practice. The Bills are treating this like a normal work week and will practice three times in London, so they wanted everything in one place. — Yahoo Sports (@YahooSports) October 20, 2015 \nMeganck said the league has set up a makeshift locker room inside a heated tent, and it includes a weight room. Team meetings will be held in the hotel. \nOnce the Bills had a place to stay and work, Meganck had to coordinate the transportation of all the supplies that the team would need. You name it, it's on the list, and everything had to be meticulously cataloged right down to brand and description, model numbers, serial numbers, value and country of origin code, with each box's weight, length, width, and height measurements. \n\"We started with an ocean freight shipment after training camp in August,\" Meganck said. \"In conjunction with starting camp (at St. John Fisher College) we were already thinking about London and shipping over supplies.\" \nThis shipment was for consumables, meaning anything that was going to London and not coming back to Buffalo, and it covered a wide spectrum. There were office supplies right down to the simplest things such as paper, laminator pouches, pens, highlighters, and markers. There was bottled water and sports drinks like Gatorade, Pedialite and Red Bull, condiments such as mustard, ketchup, barbecue and steak sauce, and other food like cereal, protein bars, chips, and cookies. Maiorana: Rex is overthinking Bills' defensive plan \nFrom the training room, there were things like workout clothes, scarves, jackets, hats, duffel bags, rain jackets, rubbing alcohol, ammonia inhalants, athletic tape remover, Gatorade pumps with batteries, towels, coolers, and cups. And there were gifts for sponsors and for the Play 60 youth event some of the players participated in on Tuesday where Hall of Fame quarterback Jim Kelly was also on hand. \nInside Wembley Stadium for the Jets-Dolphins game on Oct. 4. (Photo: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports) \nThe air freight, which departed Buffalo a couple weeks ago, was for carnet, meaning items that were going to be returning with the team. This transport was largely for video and computer equipment, power adaptors, iPads, and chargers. \nOnce all that was coordinated, so began the process of making sure everyone in the traveling party had valid passports and paperwork, and helping those who didn't to get it. “I don't know if headache is the right word, but it was definitely time-consuming.” Kevin Meganck, Bills director of football operations \n\"I don't know if headache is the right word, but it was definitely time-consuming,\" Meganck said of that chore. \"We tried to be as thorough as we could as an organization and get copies of everybody's passports just to make sure we have a backup if something goes wrong over there with a lost passport. Collecting them, it's been a lot of time tracking people down to make sure we get everything.\" \nOnce in London — Meganck and the advance team arrived last Thursday — everything had to be organized and set up for the players' arrival, including one of the most vital aspects: The food operation. \nThe team chef worked with the hotel's head chef to order the mainstay cuisine — meat, chicken, pasta, vegetables, etc. — that they will prepare every day for a group that numbers approximately 150 counting all team personnel. \n\"We basically take over the kitchen at our hotel,\" said Meganck. \"We try to make things as close to home as possible, comfort items for our players, our team. It's like a mini training camp for us and we were lucky enough that we found a place where we can operate out of and do everything at one facility.\" \nAt some point, Meganck and the others who spent nearly a year engulfed in this endeavor may get to sit down and relax while in the United Kingdom, but what he's looking forward to most is, \"When we come back with a victory, it'll be a great feeling coming back on that long flight.\" \nMAIORANA@Gannett.com Sal's in London to cover the Bills vs. Jaguars game, but is London ready for Sal?
