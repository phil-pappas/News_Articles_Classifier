Overall reactions were mixed, but the person who is directly affected by “Bones’” reinstatement seems thrilled. Daniel Cormier , the current UFC 205-pound champ and bitter rival to Jones, posted a positive message on his official Facebook page, congratulating his former and future opponent on getting his job back: “Congrats to Jon \"Bones\" Jones on his reinstatement to the UFC. For MMA fans this is a good day. A guy that has shown to be one of the greatest fighters of all time is back. As a competitor there could be no other outcome and this is the best news I've heard in a long time. Jon has said the right things and his actions are backing his words up. We all hope this is the last time we have to deal with anything like that. And lastly as a fan u get to see 2 of the best fighters compete against each other. With that being said I can't wait to compete against him again. –DC” Cormier and Jones had a highly publicized brawl at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas that resulted in penalties from the Nevada Athletic Commission in September 2014. The two nemeses finally locked horns on Jan. 3 in the main event of UFC 182, which was won by then-champ Jones via unanimous decision. In the weeks and months following his conquest of Cormier, the Jackson-Wink MMA standout’s career and personal life spiraled out of control. Jones wound up testing positive for cocaine during urinalyses for his UFC 182 bout and admitted himself into a rehabilitation center. Shortly thereafter, Jones then was involved in a hit-and-run where a pregnant woman suffered a broken arm and a wrist injury. After Jones fled the scene of the crash, police on the scene discovered a marijuana pipe with marijuana inside of it. He eventually turned himself in and was stripped of his title by the UFC and suspended indefinitely by the promotion. He eventually entered a plea agreement and received probation without jail time. Cormier went on to topple Anthony Johnson in May at UFC 187 to capture the vacant light heavyweight crown and then successfully defended in a thrilling battle with Alexander Gustafsson at UFC 192 in October. There is no timetable on when Jones and Cormier will next climb into the Octagon but the general belief in the MMA world is that Cormier’s next defense will most likely be against Jones.
