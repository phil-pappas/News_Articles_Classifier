That’s not a prediction, or a hunch, or a guess. It’s a guarantee.\nAnd it’s not for the reasons you might think. It means nothing, for instance, that the playing-out-the-string 2015 Red Sox played decent (28-20) baseball with Lovullo subbing for manager John Farrell, who is being treated for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.\nIn the last weeks of this lost season, the Red Sox performed like white-collar, 9-5ers moonlighting in the Greater Boston Men’s Senior Baseball League. They played recreational, carefree baseball, and, sure, it was fun to watch Xander Bogaerts pile up the hits, fun to watch Mookie Betts and Jackie Bradley Jr. make great catches, fun to watch David Ortiz crack home run No. 500.\nBut it wasn’t gut-wrenching, the-fate-of-the-world-hanging-in-the-balance Boston Red Sox baseball.\nSo, no, Lovullo winning games with this bunch doesn’t make him the next hot managerial prospect.\nWhat does set him apart is the manner in which he conducted himself in Farrell’s absence. And, again, it’s not for the reasons you might think. While it was nice that Lovullo refused to use Farrell’s managerial digs at Fenway Park and beyond, that’s fairly standard practice: The late Don Zimmer did the same thing in 1999 when, in his role as Yankees bench coach, he minded the shop as manager Joe Torre was recovering from prostate cancer.\nBut as teams begin their offseason manager shopping, it’s logical that some of them would have been interested in Lovullo. He’s a well-traveled former big league player who put in nearly a decade as a minor league manager, winning a pair of championships with Indians farm clubs.\nLovullo is a good communicator who reportedly meshes well with all types of players. And it doesn’t hurt that he has a sense of humor. Former Red Sox utility man Lou Merloni, who in 2006 was playing in Triple A and trying to make a comeback with the Indians after missing most of 2005 with an ankle injury, can attest to this. Lovullo, who was managing the Bisons, had received a message from the Indians: After today’s game, Merloni’s getting called up. During the game, Merloni hit a liner to the gap for a triple, and when he slid into the bag, Lovullo, who was coaching third base, leaned into him and said, “Nice job, and, oh, after the game you’re going to Cleveland.”\nHa ha. Good one. As Merloni remembers, “For the rest of that game all I could think about is that I better not get drilled or taken out at second base.”\nWhile this brand of in-the-trenches humor is not a reason to hire Torey Lovullo to be your manager, it does speak to the larger issue of making the clubhouse a place where players can breathe. You think maybe the uptight, underachieving Nationals could have used a Torey Lovullo this season?\nBut Mr. Lovullo is not going to Washington, or anywhere else. Not now, anyway. And that’s why there will be a bidding war the moment he’s prepared to field offers. Professional sports is a cutthroat business, a business of big money, and, sometimes, a business of big phonies. Choosing to be above all that, Lovullo will return as bench coach because he truly likes the organization and believes he needs to be there to assist Farrell.\nThat’s why the whole it’s-going-to-be-awkward angle has a whiff of Chicken Little to it. Had Lovullo somehow been forced to remain with the Red Sox as bench coach, it would have been awkward, sure, but he seems to have signed on for this enthusiastically and unhesitatingly.\nThere won’t be any intrigue next season. If the Sox get off to another lousy start, Farrell will get fired. End of discussion. This dynamic would have been in place with or without Lovullo in the dugout.\nNone of this means you should rush down to Fenway and gobble up tickets for 2016. After two straight last-place finishes, the Red Sox need to regain your trust. Big time.\nAnd you should be asking questions. Will the Sox be acquiring an ace? Are any of the new kids on the (trading) block? And the biggest question of all: Are the Red Sox going to unload the laughably inept Hanley Ramirez? No Sox fan should invest hard-earned entertainment dollars in this team until Ramirez is gone.\nBut that’s all later on. This is today, and John Farrell is manager of the 2016 Red Sox, with Torey Lovullo as his bench coach.\nIf a big league managing job is heaven to Torey Lovullo, then heaven can wait. Tell me you wouldn’t want this guy in your fox hole.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T21:23:43.511+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
