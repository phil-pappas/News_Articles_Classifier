The Vikings come into the game as the 28th ranked scoring defense in Division III competition, giving up 14.8 points per game. That average is best in the SAA. \n“This may be the best defense we play against this season,” Buchanan said. “They have some outstanding linebackers and their defensive line plays laterally, so it’s going to be crucial to our \nrunning game to get going.” One of those linebackers is junior Preston Stewart, who has 5.5 sacks, which is second in the conference. To compare Hendrix’s defense to Berry, the Warriors are eighth out of nine teams in the conference in scoring defense, giving up 32 points per game. \nHowever, Buchanan has been pleased with the defense that last two games and thinks it will continue to improve. The Warriors come into the game with the SAA’s best scoring offense and D3’s 30th ranked scoring offense, scoring 40 points per game. Just like the opposites of the two defenses, the two offenses are polar opposites. While Hendrix puts up 40 points per game, Berry scores just 19.2 points per game, which is eighth in the conference. \nThe Warriors boast one of the best rushing attacks in the nation behind junior running back Dayton Winn. Winn is second in the nation in rushing yards with 885 and tied for second in rushing touchdowns with 12. \nHowever, Winn credits the offensive line for his success. “Our game plan is similar to what we had against Centre,” Buchanan said. “We have to be physical and limit our mistakes. Last year, we got beat up on special teams and lost the turnover battle, so we’ve got to clean that up this year.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:25:00.304+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
