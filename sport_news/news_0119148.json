I’ve been in systems where we did not audible at all. In the Jet game, Ryan changed the play by words. Some people would call that an audible, by hand signal.”\nIn a read-option offense, which the Dolphins utilize, the quarterback often has control of determining when the team is running or passing, and that decision is usually predicated on the opposition’s defense.\n“He had plays where a run was called and without having to change anything, he decided to throw the ball,” Lazor said. “So if people don’t think he makes those decisions, then we’ve done a heck of a job with our disguises.”\nHyde: For all the changes they've made, can Dolphins let Ryan Tannehill audible?
