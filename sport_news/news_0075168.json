Villamin had dropped the pass on the exact same play a few minutes earlier.\nThree observations (and a bonus)\n1. This was Andersen's first group media appearance since Monday's strong comments about the overall state of the program. While gathering the team at the end of Thursday's workout, he stressed players continuing to study on their own before heading to class. After this week's practices, Andersen said the group responded \"very well.\"\n\"Like I've always said, we're gonna tell them exactly where we're at and how we feel about things, and they're not gonna expect anything different,\" Andersen said. \"They've responded well. I think they're well-prepared.\n\"I think these kids really understand that the fight that we're in is a big-boy fight, (and there's) a serious opportunity every day to get better. And we need to get better. And the only way you get better is if you accept the challenge that's in front of you. For the most part, we're in a good spot. We'll see how we play.\"\n2. We saw the same defensive changes -- lots of four-man fronts, cornerback Dwayne Williams running with the first unit, Sumner Houston as a first-team tackle -- as yesterday, though Kalani Vakameilalo (who was wearing a red no-contact jersey) also took some first-team reps inside. Andersen also added that Devin Chappell will play more safety this week, while Cyril Noland-Lewis will shift more to nickelback as the Beavers' secondary attempts to correct multiple assignment errors from last week debacle in Tucson and slow down Washington State's potent Air Raid attack.\n\"It's game-by-game. It's week by week,\" Andersen said. \"But it also is matching kids in certain spots to play.\"\n3. Thursday's workout was light, with only scout-team portions that were not run at full-speed open to the media. We saw some goal-line drills, then drives that started backed up against the offense's goal line, then a bunch of plays run from the offense's 30-yard line.\n4. Several players were wearing their orange game helmets. So the uniform combination will be orange-white-?\nQuotable\n\"I hope they're foaming at the mouth to wake up and practice and lift weights and do all the things that come with it. Because as we know and this group of kids needs to continue to understand, it's how you prepare that allows you to win games in an elite conference.\" -- Andersen responding to Collins' comment that the Beavers are \"foaming at the mouth\" to get back on the field Saturday\nComing up\nI will have more on how the Beavers have responded this week, and if Saturday represents a crucial moment in OSU's season. Additionally, we are recording Beaver Banter later this afternoon, so feel free to tweet questions, bold predictions and over/under topics to @ginamizell and @DannyJMoran.\n-- Gina Mizell | @ginamizell", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ginamizell"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:23:46.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
