But before Roy Hibbert ever played in a game wearing a purple and gold uniform, the 7-foot-2, 270-pound center showcased his presence in the paint without swatting away a shot or posting up inside.\nInstead, Hibbert rounded up the majority of his Lakers teammates and took them out for paintballing.\n“I wanted to get to know the guys,” said Hibbert, who also organized a paintball outing every season of his seven-year NBA career in Indiana. “I don’t know if that translates into productivity on the court. But it was fun to do that.”\nThe Lakers entered Monday’s game against Portland at Staples Center with only a 2-4 preseason record. But with Hibbert averaging 6.5 points, 9.7 rebounds and 1.67 blocks through five preseason appearances, Lakers coach Byron Scott said Hibbert has “done everything we’ve asked him to do” as a defensive-minded center.\nBut there marks another area Hibbert made an impact that remains hard to quantify. The Lakers credit Hibbert’s initiative to foster team chemistry, something they lacked last season amid a flush of injuries and players on one-year contracts.\n“Once we left here, we didn’t see each other after that,” Lakers guard Jordan Clarkson said. “Now we actually put in the time to learn each other. This team is closer together. We hang out off the court. It makes it easier to gel on the court.”\nHibbert reported that all but four of his teammates joined him for the offseason paintball excursion, noting those absences stemmed from pre-planned summer vacations. Hibbert declined to name who played with and against him. But he shared that he teamed up with Clarkson and rookie point guard D’Angelo Russell, his team won six of the eight paintball contests.\n“He’s a funny dude. We just click on and off the court,” Russell said of Hibbert. “Paintballing as a team, that’s something I wanted to do and he called it out right before I could even say it. We think alike.”\nHibbert plans to schedule another paintball outing before the Lakers’ season opener Oct. 28. He hopes the Lakers’ coaching staff joins.\n“I might take him up on the invitation,” Scott said. “But I’ll have the biggest sweatsuit. I don’t want to get hit with those things. Those things hurt. I’ve been there and shot a couple of times with those things. They’re not fun.”\nAdvertisement\nMoving on\nThe Lakers wanted to retain Ed Davis. He wanted to stay with the Lakers, too.\nBut the Lakers wanted to devote their cap space to marquee free agents. Davis did not want to wait, so he signed a three-year deal worth $20 million with Portland.\n“We miss Ed in the locker room more than anything,” Scott said. “He was a great guy to be around.”\nScott also praised the 6-foot-10, 240-pound Davis for his work ethic and defense after he averaged 8.3 points on 60.1 percent shooting, 7.6 rebounds and 1.2 blocks in his lone season with the Lakers.\nThe Lakers then acquired free-agent power forward Brandon Bass. But Scott noted that he will depend more on Hibbert to fill Davis’ absence.\n“We didn’t look at Ed as a guy we would throw the ball to a ton of times in the post and look for him to score,” Scott said. “He was more of a defensive presence for us. That is Roy’s role. He has a four- or five-inch difference to him as well.”\n mark.medina@dailynews.com or follow Mark on Twitter: @MarkG_Medina Mark Medina Back to top", "external_links": ["http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=35", "http://twitter.com/MarkG_Medina", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:06:43.932+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
