But who likes waiting? \nThe one-man crew for all things boys soccer at The Journal News has been tracking the records for all of the teams in the section throughout the season. The spreadsheets have been omnipresent on my computer since early September. With access to this information, we have a good idea of how many teams will qualify in each class, and where they’ll land in the highly-anticipated seeds. \nOnce the playoffs begin with the outbracket games on Wednesday, all of those records will go out the window and the real fun will start. Whether your team has 16 wins or two, the next step is as simple as it gets: Win or go home. \nAs we brace ourselves for one of the most exciting and unpredictable times of the year, we’ll get the hype going with a look at what we can expect in each class. \nClass AA \nProjected No. 1 seed: Arlington \nOutlook: Before a single game was played this season, coaches around Section 1 were buzzing about the Admirals, who have been the top-ranked team in the Lohud Boys Soccer rankings for seven consecutive weeks . In almost every way, they’ve lived up to the hype. \nArlington finished the regular season at 15-1, the best record of any team in the section. The Admirals have shown tremendous depth and have All-Section players at every position. They’re the clear favorite, but let’s not talk ourselves into thinking that this will be a cakewalk. Class AA is loaded with quality teams and there will be plenty of competition. \n“They have been the top team since Day 1, so if anyone is going to win the section, they are probably going to need to beat them,” Port Chester coach John Cafaldo said. “(But) it is going to take a complete team effort in every game. It is a deep and extremely talented field where all of the games are going to be very tough.” \nCafaldo’s Rams (13-3) are the likely No. 2 seed behind Arlington, with fellow Westchester teams Scarsdale (13-2-1) and Horace Greeley (13-3) projected as the top four seeds. Scarsdale lost head-to-head against Arlington this season, 2-0, while Port Chester and Greeley have yet to play the Admirals. It’s also worth noting that Scarsdale routed Greeley, 5-0, in the season-opener for both teams. \nBeyond the top four, next in line should be Mamaroneck (11-4-1), Ketcham (11-5) and John Jay-East Fishkill (10-4-2), the only other teams in the class to finish with double-digit wins. John Jay-EF and Mamaroneck met in the championship game last season, a 2-1 overtime for the Patriots . The defending champs are also the only team to beat Arlington this season, splitting two games with the Admirals. \nThe consensus is that any of those seven teams could make a run, but sleepers such as Fox Lane, Yorktown, North Rockland and Suffern are not to be taken lightly. In total, there should be at least 19 teams that qualify in Class AA. \nClass A \nProjected No. 1 seed: Pearl River \nOutlook : With a win over Nanuet on Monday, the Pirates set themselves up for the top seed for the second year in a row. Last year, they entered the playoffs undefeated, only to be upset by Eastchester in the quarterfinals. \nThat heartbreaking loss has certainly not been forgotten. \n“We learned how much it hurts to lose your last game,” Pearl River coach Damon O’Keefe said. “They know how bad it felt emotionally last year, and now that the majority of our players are seniors, they definitely want to advance further.” \nEven though Pearl River (14-2) is the likely No. 1 seed, a case can be made for Byram Hills (13-2-1) as the favorite. After all, it’s the Bobcats who are the defending champs and have spent the entire season ranked No. 1 in Class A. Many are expecting a Byram vs. Pearl River final, but there are others who could crash the party. \nTappan Zee (12-2-2) is lined up to grab the No. 3 seed and has played both Byram and Pearl River tough. The Dutchmen split in two games with Pearl River and took Byram to overtime. And we can’t forget about Rye (12-4), which is the only team to beat Byram this season. In fact, the Garnets swept both games, so you can be sure that’s a team that the Bobcats do not want to see. \nLakeland (11-4-1) and Riverside (13-2-1) also figure to land in the top six. \nThe Hornets have been reeling since a scary car accident involving starters Matias Prando, Nick Foci and Jordan Fein on Friday night. The most important thing is that the boys have been released from the hospital and are recovering from their injuries , but all three are expected to miss the playoffs. \nThe Rams are at the point where they have to be taken seriously. They’ve fatten up by going undefeated in the Yonkers City league, but they also beat Eastchester, tied Tappan Zee and will enter the playoffs on an 11-game winning streak. \nFurther down in the bracket, Somers, Sleepy Hollow, John Jay, Pelham and Eastchester represent teams that no one will feel comfortable playing. At least 22 teams should qualify. \nClass B \nProjected No. 1 seed: Valhalla \nOutlook: While there are notable favorites in Class AA and Class A, it’s difficult to pinpoint one team in Class B. \nValhalla (14-1-1) has clinched the No. 1 seed, but the Vikings are 0-1-1 against league rival Pleasantville (11-3-2), which figures to get a top five seed. Bronxville (14-2) should get the No. 2 seed after losing to Rye Neck in the championship game last season , but the Broncos have losses to Valhalla and Edgemont. \nEdgemont (12-2-1) and Hastings (11-2-2) should round out the top five. \n“What makes Class B so deep is that there are so many great teams and no clear-cut favorite,” Valhalla coach Sandro Prosperino said. “Winning it will require having a game plan, executing that game plan and four mistake-free soccer games in nine days.” \nRye Neck, Putnam Valley, Briarcliff, Blind Brook and Albertus Magnus also have winning records and figure to crack the top 10. There should be a total of 15 teams in the Class B field. \nClass C \nProjected top seed: Solomon Schechter \nOutlook: The defending champs are the only team in the class with a winning record, but it’s being viewed as a three-team race along with Hamilton and North Salem. \nSchechter beat Hamilton in the title game last season , while North Salem is in its first year in Class C after spending previous seasons as a Class B team. Schechter and Hamilton split in two meetings this season, while North Salem has yet to play either team. 18 CONNECT 7 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://lohud.us/1RT5NkJ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:39:25.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
