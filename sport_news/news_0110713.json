We’re going to go to Dallas, work on some business for a few days, and then we’re going to go to Miami and hang out with Ricky [Jean-Francois] and his fiancée. \n[ Best and worst moments from the Redskins’ comeback win ] \n“We’re just going to kind of get away and, you know, get some me-and-her time, because she be busy with the business and I be playing football, so we barely see each other. It’s going to be good to get away and kind of, you know… make some magic.” This was the look on Hatcher’s face after he talked about making some magic.
