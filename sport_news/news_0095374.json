There's the trash talk back and forth, the stake-planting incident last year, and continuing vandalism on both campuses. But on the field at least, this year's matchup is resembling a real rivalry , with both teams back in the top 25 and in the picture for Big Ten and national championships. \n• Sure Michigan State comes into the game at 6-0 and ranked in the top 10. But Spartans fans aren't exactly jumping for joy with how the team has gotten to that 6-0 record, with plenty of closer-than-expected calls. Mike Griffith gave some straight talk this week about where things stand with the Spartans. \n• Jim Harbaugh was expected to turn a floundering Michigan program into a contender eventually. But it wasn't expected to happen this fast, with a 5-1 record and a top-15 ranking halfway through his first season. Players say that success has come through trusting the coach's process. \n• Before Michigan State players could participate in their first weightlifting session of the week, they had to first wait through a 35-minute traditional Michigan week speech from longtime strength and conditioning coach Ken Mannie. It's one of the many ways this week has a different vibe than the others in East Lansing. \n• Michigan has one of the best defenses in the country this year, after posting three straight shutouts. Michigan State's defense has been one of the best in the country in recent years, but hasn't been up to that level so far this year. But Michigan is still preparing for the same old Spartans defense. \nCOMMENT OF THE WEEK \"Both teams, true to their character, will try, try, try to establish the run. Highly unlikely either team rushes for more than 100 yards. In Michigan's case, #1 back is hampered a bit, and MSU D Line, other than two long runs due to errors in gap assignments, have been extremely difficult to run against. And they are 2 deep at every position and one of the few position groups on MSU without significant injuries. IN MSU's case, their offensive line is down three starters and banged up. Starting running back is out. They will counter with two tight end sets, but not realistic to assume they will move the ball effectively all game on the ground.\" — aagreen \n2015 STAT LEADERS • Passing: Connor Cook 98-163, 1,344 yards, 12 TD, 2 INT• Rushing: LJ Scott 70 carries, 418 yards, 6 TD• Receiving: Aaron Burbridge 35 catches, 570 yards 4 TD• Tackles: Riley Bullough 55• Interceptions: RJ Williamson, Montae Nicholson 2 \nMichigan • Passing: Jake Rudock 106-171, 1,135 yards, 5 TD, 6 INT• Rushing: De'Veon Smith 77 carries, 390 yards, 4 TD• Receiving: Amara Darboh 25 catches, 280 yards, 2 TD• Tackles: Joe Bolden 38", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T13:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T14:12:50.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
