County Chair Deborah Kafoury even talked about it during her state of the county address in June. Citing an employee survey that \"found that women were taking an average of six weeks of unpaid leave to stay home with a new baby,\" Kafoury announced that she was \"developing a plan to provide our employees – both men and women – with paid family leave so that all parents can spend those precious early days with their new baby.\"\nWhile taxpayers shouldn't be surprised by the county's adoption of the new benefit, many probably would be surprised by the actual family-leave scenario Kafoury described so darkly. Are county employees really unable, as a result of stingy benefits, to \"spend those precious early days\" with a new child? And did the unpaid leave figure offered by Kafoury (six weeks) tell the whole story? No and No.\nOregonian editorials Editorials reflect the collective opinion of The Oregonian editorial board, which operates independently of the newsroom.

Under state and federal law, public agencies and all but the smallest private-sector employers must allow workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to care for a new child. While some employers choose to pay for some of this time off, they make up a small minority. Unpaid parental leave is the norm. There are good arguments in favor of offering paid parental leave in a fiscally responsible fashion. Doing so, for instance, can be a good way to attract and retain high-value employees. Still, declining to break out the company – or taxpayer – checkbook to support such time off is not exactly an act of cruelty.\nDeclining to offer paid parental leave in Multnomah County, in particular, has not been an act of cruelty. Consider how eligible employees used parental leave last year. Of the 104 employees who qualified to take parental leave in 2014, 93 took it. The average leave duration was nine weeks, and most of that time off was ... paid. Just over half of these employees, 49, used some unpaid time, but they also took, on average, the most time off – 11 weeks. Meanwhile, 44 employees used only paid time while on parental leave. Their average time off? Six weeks.\nEmployees could take so much paid time off even without a paid parental leave policy because Multnomah County's benefits were already remarkably generous. For instance, new employees are allowed 12 sick days per year, which they may accrue without limit. They also receive a dozen vacation days after one year of employment, though the number quickly jumps as determined by various union contracts. Five-year employees represented by the county's largest union, AFSCME Local 88, receive 18 days of vacation, which, if unused, also may be accrued.\nThe result of such policies and contracts, in Multnomah County and elsewhere in the public sector, is a fairly sophisticated accrued-leave economy. Whether the goal is to save up sick time in anticipation of a serious illness; to accrue sick and vacation time in expectation of a big payout upon separation or retirement; or to use accrued sick time to \"spike\" a pension, as older PERS members may, public employees have every incentive to bank as much leave as possible.\nAnd that's where unpaid parental leave has presented a problem in Multnomah County: Employees taking family leave are required to use paid time before using unpaid time. In some instances, then, the county's new policy will allow employees to take longer leaves without sacrificing any pay. In others, however, it will simply allow employees to retain their store of accrued vacation and sick leave, which they otherwise would have used (appropriately) to cover parental leave.\nWhen voting in favor of paid parental leave last week, Kafoury said, \"it is incumbent upon us to set the bar so that other jurisdictions and other businesses around the county will follow.\" Before elected elsewhere follow suit (ahem, Portland), they should consider the actual need for the new policy given existing benefits and weigh them against its cost. Multnomah County estimates that its paid leave policy will cost about $1 million per year, yet commissioners adopted it even though, as Kafoury said of the county budget in her June address, \"We must recognize that our costs will increase and our resources will fail to keep pace.\"\nIt's interesting, finally, that Kafoury mentions businesses, which must negotiate an economic landscape very different from that in which government entities exist. While some companies do offer paid parental leave, and while others may follow, the notion that private-sector benefits must always come to resemble comparatively generous public-sector benefits is limited. Oregon's public sector would be much easier to support, in fact, if its benefits moved closer to those typically offered in the private sector, where, for instance, sick time is generally seen as a contingency rather than as a form of compensation.", "external_links": ["https://multco.us/multnomah-county/news/state-county-2015-prepared-remarks"], "published": "2015-10-15T21:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:24:26.964+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
