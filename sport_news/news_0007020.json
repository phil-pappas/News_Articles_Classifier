Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 6:00 am Hornets defeat previously-unbeaten Greenville, 28-9 By ED FARRELL | Herald Assistant Sports Editor The Herald GREENVILLE – This year – at least, thus far this season, with a playoff rematch a possibility – there was no dramatic rally for Greenville High’s football team. Friday night, Hickory had all the 2nd-half heroics. After being trumped by the Trojans during the 1st half, Charles Carr carried 14 times for 128 yards after intermission, as Hickory handed Greenville a 28-9 Region 3-AA setback at Stewart Field’s Snyder-Stone Stadium. Although Hickory is the reigning 4-time District 10 Class AA champion, Greenville had gotten the best of the Hornets with back-to-back regular-season rallies in Hermitage the past 2 seasons. However Hickory (4-1, 5-1) harvested a 14-3 halftime lead, then led by Carr, consumed the clock after halftime. Ultimately, Carr carried a game-high 24 times for 151 yards – in the process, surpassing the 1,000-yard mark for the season – including the game’s initial TD, a 17-yard scoring sprint. “We had to find a way to run the football; we had to find a way to stop the run, and we also have some kids who can make some big plays,” summarized Hickory Head Coach Bill Brest. Including 7 Carr carries – his longest was 28 yards – Hickory had 14 plays that gained 10 yards or more. Luke Brennan, despite being picked off twice, completed passes of 45 yards to Will Gruber, 42- and 31-yarders to Joey DeJulia (the latter, on 4th-and-7, hoisted the Hornets to a 21-3 lead with 8:04 left in the 3rd quarter), and a 37-yarder to Andrew Pryts. Pryts also pilfered a pass. Those splash plays spoiled Greenville’s comeback bid. Also, the Trojans were 1-for-8 on 3rd-down conversion attempts during the 1st half, then couldn’t get Hickory’s offense off the field during the final 24 minutes. “We have to be better in the ‘Red Zone.’ It was the same situation last year in the playoff game (a 12-7 loss for the D-10 title) when we couldn’t get out of our own end, which really hurt us,” assessed Trojans’ taskmaster Brian Herrick. “This year, we just didn’t finish in the ‘Red Zone.’ “ ... Against a good team like this, you can’t be one-dimensional, and we were (Friday) night. I mean, (the Hornets) literally had eleven within five yards of the line of scrimmage,” Herrick continued. “Against some teams, you can win, but not against a good team.” Greenville (4-1, 5-1) gained only 190 total yards, 147 on the ground. The Trojans, trailing 21-3, embarked on their lone sustained scoring drive, a 15-play, 70-yarder that consumed 5:52 and culminated in Matt Crawford’s 3-yard TD run. But after failing to convert a 2-point PAT pass, Greenville got as close as it would come (21-9) with 6 minutes left. Hickory’s ensuing 9-play, 64-yard drive took 5 minutes and 7 seconds, with Pryts posting his 2nd rushing TD of the night, a 6-yarder. Jacob Scarton’s 4th consecutive conversion kick concluded the contest. The Hornets halved their offense, equally dividing 399 total yards (199 rushing; 200 passing), even though Brennan completed only 9 of 23 attempts and had passes pilfered by Hunter Hause and Gage Gladsyz. Brest said the Penn State University-bound Pryts was employed as a decoy early in the game, but “ ... we had to get the ball in Andrew Pryts’ hands more. The receivers did a great job, and once we got Luke settled down, he bounced back and did a great job. I just thought we found a way. “ .. We finally found a way to run the football, and I think we stopped the run – decently – (Friday) night. But we made too many mistakes,” admitted Brest, referencing 4 turnovers. “(The Trojans) did a good job against the run,” Brest said regarding Carr’s 23-yard 1st-half output. “They took away the run, so we had to go to the pass, and we started to loosen them up. We made a couple adjustments at halftime. ... It was just a total team effort –– not the coaches, not the players –– just a total team effort.” Brest was buoyed by the return of his son, Kendall, who had been hospitalized for a week-and-half, but was discharged earlier in the day on Friday. The younger Brest wasn’t unable to don a uniform, but teammate Caleb Gagliardi wore his number 42 as a tribute. Also, the younger Brest, while hospitalized, took a page out of TCU’s playbook that features Heisman hopefully Trevonne Boykin. The Hornets ran it on their 1st play from scrimmage, resulting in the 45-yard Brennan-to-Gruber connection that set up Carr’s score. “When I found out (Gagliardi) was going to wear number forty-two, it touched my heart a little bit, and it made me feel really happy that one of my best friends wanted to do that for me,” the younger Brest related. “It felt great to be back on the sideline. It hurt last week, but it feels great to be back now.” Hickory the satisfaction of turning the tables on the Trojans last year, avenging the regular-season setback in the game that counted most –– the District 10 championship. Now Herrick hopes his club can duplicate that to their benefit. “A sign of a champion is, it’s easy to be up after you win every week, it’s easy to come in and lift weights Saturday morning after a win, it’s easy to watch film and easy to get started on the next (opponent). But you find out how tough kids are after a loss,” Herrick reasoned. “How are you gonna approach it the next week? “I’m not giving them a choice – they’re gonna approach it the right way – but they have to bring some of that attitude with them. And I have a lot of faith in our leaders – Matt Crawford, Gage Gladysz – will get us in the right frame of mind,” Herrick concluded. ——— HICKORY 7 7 7 7 28 GREENVILLE 3 0 0 6 9 Scoring plays H — Carr, 17 run (Scarton kick) G — Casey Eells, 20 field goal H — Pryts, 1 run (Scarton kick) H — DeJulia, 31 pass from Brennan (Scarton kick) G — Crawford, 3 run (pass failed) H — Pryts, 6 run (Scarton kick) Team stats", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:36:02.059+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
