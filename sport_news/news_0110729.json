Pakistan has won the second test against England by 178 runs. Yasir Shah has emerged as one of the star player for Pakistan. He took four wickets in both innings taking Pakistan towards victory. Wahab Riaz also showed an amazing performance which irked English players. England face an unlikely mission to save the second Test against Pakistan in Dubai after being set a Test record 491 to win. With 39 balls left of the day, Yasir Shah took the last wicket of Adil Rashid. By winning the second test against England, Pakistan has now gone up to the second place in the ICC Test ranking. With the new and energetic squad, Pakistan is showing its great form to perform in an upcoming Asia Cup and World T20 in India. However, unstable political situation in India can create trouble for Pakistani team to participate in the series.
