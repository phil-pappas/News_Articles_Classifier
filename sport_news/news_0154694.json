It's time to take the necessary steps to ensure people's safety.\"\nCallahan said he'd like to see Winnipeg adopt a program similar to one in Staten Island, New York, where undercover police ride buses and also keep an eye out for distracted drivers and street crime.\nThe proposal was discussed at this morning's police board meeting with full support from St. Boniface councillor Matt Allard and Daniel McIntyre councillor Cindy Gilroy, who said the plan could go a long way toward helping women, in particular, feel safe taking transit.\nAs part of the U.N. Safe Cities iinitiative, Gilroy said she's spoken to groups of women who fear waiting at bus stops at night, being attacked on buses or being followed home from their stop.\n\"They really go out of their way to make sure that they're going on specific routes, or they think twice before taking transit more than, say, men,\" Gilroy said. \"I think having police on the buses will just add that level of security that women need to feel confident about taking our public transportation.\"\nPolice Board chairman councillor Scott Gillingham said if the police board's strategic planning steering committee supports the plan, the board will ask the police service to conduct a review of how the program would work.\n\"If it was the will of the committee to take it that far, to ask the service to do a review, I would not be opposed to that,\" he said.\nWhen the city's transit bylaw was introduced last year, there were discussions about having cadets ride buses, but the plan didn't go ahead.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:01:14.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
