TUCSON, AZ (Tucson News Now) - \nSunnyside’s Nick O’Hagin did what Nick O’Hagin does on Friday night at Doherty Stadium in Tucson. \nHe ran and passed the Blue Devils to another win. \nThe senior rushed for a pair of touchdowns and threw for another as #10 Sunnyside beat Salpointe Catholic 21-16 ending a five-game losing streak to the Lancers that dated back to 2007. \nO’Hagin scored on a three-yard run and found junior receiver Gabe Soto on a 20-yard touchdown pass to give the Blue Devils (4-2) a 14-3 lead at the break. \nAfter a power outage extended halftime for several extra minutes, the Lancers defense forced a quick three and out. \nSalpointe Catholic’s offense then found some traction, marching 71 yards in eight plays. Trevor Volpe busted a 22-yard run and then scored from nine yards out to make it 14-10 Sunnyside. \nThe Blue Devils though were able to answer right back. A big kick return set-up Sunnyside at the Lancers 38. \nO’Hagin hit Ruben Figueroa on a flat route for 16 yards, and then converted a 4th and nine with a ten-yard run. \nHe scored on the next play to push Sunnyside’s lead back to a comfortable 11 points. \nThe Blue Devils travel to Cienega next Friday night to face a Bobcats team they have never beaten in four meetings. \nSalpointe Catholic (2-4) saw their playoffs hopes all but disappear with a third straight loss. The Lancers travel to winless Buena in Week Seven.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T09:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:31:20.251+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
