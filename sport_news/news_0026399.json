It's possible, maybe even likely, that he will be returning kickoffs Saturday in Winnipeg, in the second game of a back-to-back series with the Blue Bombers.\n\"It's like I'm right back at home,\" said Smith after his first practice. \"I was driving through when I got off my flight (Monday night) and it was like, 'Man, it looks different, but it feels like home.' It feels like I'm good here.\"\nThe 24-year-old Smith is listed at 5-foot-6, 155 lbs. Both the height and weight might err on the high side.\n\"I don't think he's gotten bigger and I don't think he's going to get bigger,\" said RedBlacks coach Rick Campbell. \"You can feed him all you want, but I think what you see is what you get. The guys are very excited to see him back. As you know, he's got a big heart and competes his butt off all the time.\"\nDon't tell Smith he can't do this, that he can't play football. He believes in himself, always has, even after he didn't get any calls from the CFL or NFL after wrapping up an excellent college career at Ball State University.\n\"People telling me I can't do this, it's one of my biggest motivators,\" said Smith, who, as a kid, had posters of his favourite players -- guys like Michael Vick, Brett Favre, Walter Payton, Emmitt Smith, Deion Sanders and Barry Sanders -- on his wall. \"I had one chip on my shoulder, now it's a bag of chips.\"\nThere's an Aristotle Quote: he's grown attached to: \"To lead an orchestra, you must turn your back on the crowd.\"\nAs a RedBlack in 2014, his main contributions were in the punt and kick return game. He returned 30 kickoffs for 626 yards and 58 punts for 498 yards. He caught seven passes for 77 yards and a touchdown. On Tuesday, Smith, who wore No. 15 in 2014, was wearing No. 84.\nThe RedBlacks have stayed in touch with Smith, who was back home in Muncie, Ind., where he was coaching receivers at Muncie Central High School and spending precious time with his 2 1/2-year-old son, Jamill Jr.\n\"I got a call Week 6,\" said Smith. \"They said when they had a spot open I'd be the first person they'd call. It got to about Week 13, then I thought if anything was going to happen, it'd be next year. After the game (on Friday, a 27-24 win for the RedBlacks over the Bombers), they called me and said, 'Can you come tomorrow?' I'm happy to be here. I'm so happy.\"\nAnd that happiness and emotion flowed out early Tuesday morning as Smith walked back into a locker room he hadn't seen in four months.\n\"I wanted to cry tears of joy. Shoot, I wanted to let it all out,\" said Smith. \"It hurt my heart when I was done (in Ottawa). Football was hard to watch. It was a letdown, but it gave me more motivation. I have faith in myself. I know I can compete with anybody. I can go out there and play. It's always (about proving myself).\n\"(Being back on a team that's going to the playoffs), it's the same mindset, but a different feel. I'm ready to be here and be an extra piece.\"\nIt wasn't easy for the RedBlacks to send the always-smiling Smith packing after training camp. He is one of the team's most popular players, staying in Ottawa through the winter months and doing several community appearances.\n\"We kept in touch with him,\" said Campbell. \"We like him because of his attitude, his ball security and all the things he can bring to the table. We'll see how he does the next few days and go from there.\"\nWhile the team isn't committing to using Smith, how soon he gets into the lineup could be dictated by the health of kick returner Reggie Dunn, who was injured on the opening kickoff against Winnipeg.\n\"The report we got was (Dunn) wasn't 100%, but that doesn't mean he can't play this week,\" said Campbell. \"We're going to leave no stone unturned as far as the home stretch goes. Whatever we need to do or whatever people we need around here to have all our bases covered, we're going to make sure we do that.\"\nTwitter: @TimCBaines\nBAINES\nRedBlacks' Smith feels 'right back at home'\nBy Tim Baines , Ottawa Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 05:25 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 20, 2015 06:02 PM EDT\nFor Jamill Smith, returning to Ottawa on Monday was emotional.\nFor an undersized guy who for many years has been told he's too small for a big man's game, for a player who's heart was as valuable to the RedBlacks as what he did with a football in his hands, it was sweet to be back on the football field at TD Place on Tuesday.\nReleased in mid-June by the RedBlacks, he's been added to their practice roster.
