We go back a long way. We've had weeks like this before, but it's been a while.\"\nAs Keeneland's Fall Meet came to a close -- races run Breeders' Cup week in Lexington don't count toward the totals -- Motion and the veteran jockey Prado teamed for their third major victory in October.\nTiger Ride came from off the pace to challenge Include Betty, a winner of Belmont Park's Mother Goose earlier this summer, and move away for a length win on the dirt -- not the turf as originally carded after rains fell at Keeneland.\n\"I was right behind the speed, and when I swung her outside, she had a nice kick,\" said Prado, who guided the daughter of Candy Ride to 1 1/16 miles in 1:43.88.\nTiger Ride returned $15.80 to win.\nMrs McDougal ran third despite a rough trip up the back stretch and Prado's Sweet Ride fourth in the field of 10 3-year-old fillies, scratched down from the full 14 when Keeneland decided to switch surfaces Saturday afternoon. The race's Grade III status will be reviewed and potentially downgraded because it didn't run on grass.\nTiger Ride improved her career record to 5-0-1 in 9 starts. Her previous best finish in a graded stakes race was fourth.\nMotion called his horse, owned by Dixiana Farms, \"pretty unique,\" saying that while she has strong dirt form, he expects her to develop into a better runner on grass.\nHe and Prado also took Keeneland's Oct. 15 Grade Sycamore and Oct. 18 Rood & Riddle Dowager, both of those races also Grade III tests.\n\"We've known each other a long, long time,\" Prado said. \"We're lucky together.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:13:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:45:30.774+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
