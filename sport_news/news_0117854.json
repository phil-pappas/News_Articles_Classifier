The Hurricanes have forced 15 turnovers while losing just two. \n“It’s important,” Miami head coach Al Golden said. “Those are the two areas that we set out to fix – our turnover ratio and our penalties. We’re making progress with our turnover ratio, and obviously, we have to continue to make progress with our penalties. We’re going to get challenged. The ball is going to get challenged this weekend, both up front and down the field. They have an excellent defense. We’re going to have to protect the ball on offense and try to take it away on defense.” \nAfter dropping back-to-back games to Cincinnati and Florida State, the Hurricanes forced four turnovers in a 30-20 win over Virginia Tech last week. \n“I don’t know,” Golden said, when asked how much luck is involved in turnovers. “Sometimes like the fumble the other day (against Virginia Tech), deep in their own end, ripping it out wasn’t luck, but the fact that we couldn’t get it, you do have to be fortuitous there in terms of the ball bouncing the right way or you having population around the ball. Here’s what we do believe in, we believe in tilting the odds in our favor by finishing plays, by having population around the ball, those types of things. \n“On the other side of the ball, are we protecting the ball? Are we doing the little things you have to do? Is the quarterback protecting the ball? Those are all factors involved. But definitely you have to be fortunate, as well.” \nGolden expects Miami quarterback Brad Kaaya and the Hurricanes’ offense to be tested by the Clemson defense. Kaaya leads the ACC with 299.2 yards passing per game, but the Hurricanes’ rushing attack is 12th in the conference with 136.3 yards per game. \nClemson allows 114.2 yards rushing and 167.5 yards passing to rank fourth in the conference in total defense. \n“We have to run the ball better,” Golden said. “There’s no question about it. Every game is different. There are a lot of things they do where they try to outnumber the box. We’re going to have to run the ball effectively against them. There are other times where they’re pressuring, and Ben Boulware Ben Boulware", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T17:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:46:38.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
