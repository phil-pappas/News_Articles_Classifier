(AP) - The Tangipahoa Parish School Board's finance committee is discussing whether to reduce the starting salary for noncertified teachers and provide one-time salary supplements for them.\nThe proposal calls for reducing noncertified teachers' starting pay by $3,000 and freezing it at that level until they receive certification.\nIt also calls for reducing the salaries of teachers with practitioner's licenses by $1,000. They would be eligible for raises for three years but would then have their salaries frozen until they earn full certification.\nFinance officer Bret Schnadelbach says noncertified and certified teachers currently have the same starting salary of $41,000. However, noncertified teachers are not eligible for raises.\nSuperintendent Mark Kolwe tells The Daily Star ( http://bit.ly/1QSpnwy ) a decision will be made by the end of the school year.\nInformation from: The Daily Star, http://www.hammondstar.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
