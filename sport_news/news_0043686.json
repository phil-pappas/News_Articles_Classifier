They said Miller called her mother Elizabeth Sparkman and asked her to find some way to get her drugs.\nOfficials said back in March, Sparkman had stuffed prescription drugs into two tampon applicators and taped them to the back of a toilet bowl at the East County Health Center in Gresham. Miller was later set to visit that health center.\nInvestigators said Miller asked for a bathroom break and found the drugs her mother had put there earlier. Officials said they discovered the prescription drugs shortly after.\nInvestigators said there was also a second attempt with prescription drugs and meth made by Sparkman at a different Multnomah County Health Center.\nOfficials said they had been listening to Sparkman and Millerâ€™s jail phone conversations and were able to stop the second attempt.\nSparkman later pleaded guilty to smuggling the drugs.\nCopyright 2015 KPTV-KPDX Broadcasting Corporation.
