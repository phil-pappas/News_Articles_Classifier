(AP Photo/John Raoux) \nKNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) â€” Tennessee wide receiver Alton \"Pig\" Howard has been dismissed from the team for a violation of unspecified team rules. \nVolunteers coach Butch Jones announced Howard's dismissal on Wednesday. \nHoward had 54 catches for 618 yards last season to lead Tennessee in both categories, but he had only one reception for eight yards this year while playing in just two games. \nHoward was suspended from a season-opening victory over Bowling Green due to a violation of team rules. He missed the Vols' last two games because of a concussion. \nThe senior from Orlando, Florida, had 112 career catches for 1,068 yards and five touchdowns. He also had 49 carries for 246 yards and two touchdowns. \nTennessee (2-3, 0-2 SEC) hosts No. 19 Georgia (4-1, 1-1) on Saturday. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
