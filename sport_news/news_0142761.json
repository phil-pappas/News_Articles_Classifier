Both sides are working overtime to move the pieces with German Ambassador Martin Ney emphasising to expect \"path-breaking results\" and \"signing of substantial agreements\". While preferring to hold details of agreements in the works, the German envoy indicated the broad sweep of areas include security, environment, development cooperation, clean energy, climate, infrastructure, urban mobility, innovation, higher education, skill development, culture and food security. Trade and investment does remain on top of the agenda and the German Chancellor is also expected to take up problems being faced by investors from her country such as measures to indicate the ease of doing business, taxation, intellectual property rights and graft. \"The government says they are doing [takings steps] but the industry says they need progress [on the above mentioned problems] in order to implement the planned investment\",\" Ney told the media here. Merkel arrives here on Sunday evening and on her three-day visit, she will also travel to Bengaluru to attend a business forum. She will be accompanied by six Cabinet ministers as well as a high-profile business delegation. Ney said bilateral economic relations were becoming closer and the Indo-German Chamber of Commerce was the biggest German bi-national chamber outside Germany with more than 7,000 German and Indian member companies across many sectors. As for volume of Germany's development cooperation programme with India, he said it increased by 260 per cent since the first IGC in 2011. In a statement, the External Affairs Ministry said the consultation was \"a unique summit-level dialogue with Cabinet participation of both governments that helps advance the bilateral partnership across the whole range of priority areas of mutual interest between the two countries\". Modi and Merkel will also exchange views on regional and global issues of common concern, it said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:04:21.261+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
