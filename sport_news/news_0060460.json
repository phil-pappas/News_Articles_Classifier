Mandatory Credit: Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports Most Popular By Dylan Montz, correspondent October 9, 2015 | 5:23 pm \nAMES — Iowa State defensive coordinator Wally Burnham sat and studied film of the high-powered Texas Tech offense and couldn’t help being reminded of a board game from his childhood. \nBurnham remembered an electronic football board game where players would set 11 game pieces on offense and 11 on defense. When the electricity was turned on, the pieces began jumping and moving all over the board unpredictably. \n“That’s kind of what this is,” Burnham said of today’s game in Lubbock, Texas. “There’s people everywhere. It’s a challenge and our kids are looking forward to it. We’ll see what we can do.” \nIowa State made the switch to a 3-4 defensive scheme in the off-season specifically to combat the up-tempo, air-raid offenses of the Big 12. \nTexas Tech will be the first squad to put the revamped ISU defense to the test. \nThe Red Raiders possess the No. 3 scoring offense and No. 3 total offense in the Big 12 behind Baylor and TCU. They have only missed one scoring opportunity in the red zone in 21 tries, so the Cyclones must have leverage on defense to combat the five wide receiver looks. \n“(We’ll) try to have enough guys on the perimeter for that passing game and enough guys close to the interior to defend the run game,” said Iowa State Coach Paul Rhoads. “I’m in a 60-minute effort to try to stay in that type of position and then running and pursuing and giving great effort to finish the plays as quickly as possible.” \nOne of Texas Tech’s biggest strengths is the ability to move the ball quickly. The Red Raiders average 50 points per game, but are second-to-last in the Big 12 in time of possession at an average of 25:03. \nTTU sophomore quarterback Patrick Mahomes is third in the nation in passing yards (1,836) and total offense and is forth in completions per game (26.8). \nIn its 3-4 defense, Iowa State has had marked success in getting pressure to opposing quarterbacks. Through four games, the Cyclones have 14 sacks — 10th in the NCAA — which is one less than they had all of last season. Senior Dale Pierson has six sacks — second in the Big 12 — and said he’s tried to combat the quick release of Mahomes’ passes with extra work on the pass-rush sled and more running in practice. \n“They get it out pretty quick,” Pierson said. “I think their offensive line is a pretty good offensive line also, so I just know I’ve got to do extra stuff this week. I always do extra stuff at practice, but if I want to go out there and get (a sack) and do my best, I’ve got to do extra.” \nl Comments: montzdylan@gmail.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:49:17.256+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
