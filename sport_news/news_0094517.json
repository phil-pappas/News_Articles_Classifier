If he happens to be more than that, that would be a bonus. I think it’s better to plan on him being less mobile.”\nBYU coach Bronco Mendenhall, on Tanner Mangum\nPROVO — BYU has grown accustomed to dramatic finishes this season with four fourth-quarter victories — and three of those four wins came on a game-winning touchdown drive on its final possession.\nThe Cougars (4-2) could find themselves in a similar situation Friday (6 p.m., MT, ESPN) when they entertain high-scoring Cincinnati (3-2), which averages 39 points per game.\nBut BYU’s ability to score points in bunches, and keep up in a shootout, could depend on the availability and effectiveness of freshman quarterback Tanner Mangum. Mangum injured his hamstring in the Cougars’ 45-38 win over East Carolina last Saturday. He missed much of the fourth quarter before returning and leading a game-winning drive.\nMangum has been listed as “probable” and he said this week he expects to play.\nOne of Mangum’s strengths is being able to scramble and throw on the run. If his mobility is limited, it will impact BYU's game plan.\n“We’ll have to plan on him probably being less mobile and try to build a plan around that,” said coach Bronco Mendenhall. “If he happens to be more than that, that would be a bonus. I think it’s better to plan on him being less mobile.”\nIf Mangum is unable to play, true freshman Beau Hoge, who completed 1 of 5 passes for nine yards and an interception in relief of Mangum last week, will get the nod.\nFinishing drives will be important against Cincinnati. The Cougars hurt themselves with three turnovers against Connecticut and they turned the ball over on their opening possession against ECU.\n“We kind of repeated what we did against UConn that first drive, turning it over. But throughout the game we got going (against ECU),” Mangum said. “We got into a rhythm and we were able to finish more drives and get more touchdowns on the board. It was a good step forward. There’s a lot of room to improve. There are things we can work on to do that even better.”\nIf Friday’s game turns out to be another shootout, Mangum said his team is prepared to do “whatever it takes to win. That’s what we want to do as an offense. Every time we get on the field, we want to score  We just want to score every time we go on the field. That’s the mentality we have to have. As an offense, we’re developing that mindset. We’re developing that attitude that when we get out on the field we want to get the ball in the end zone.”\nWide receiver Mitch Mathews said the offense will be simplified if Hoge plays. He added that the team has spent the week boosting him up.\n“He’s five or six years younger than most of us receivers,” Mathews said. “He’s your little brother on the team and you want to make sure you’re looking out for him and giving him some confidence.”\nOffensive lineman Ryker Mathews said his team is confident in both Mangum and Hoge, but obviously Mangum has a track record for pulling out victories, including a game-winning final drive last Saturday.\n“We had a couple of series where we kind of struggled (when Mangum was out). We figured it out and we knew we would. I don’t think there were any doubts, we knew we deserved to win that game,” Ryker Mathews explained. \"(Mangum is) an awesome player. We want our starting quarterback in. It’s nice to know he’s behind us. He knows what he’s doing and he makes the plays he needs to make.”\nMangum is glad, and grateful, to have so many playmakers that he can rely on, including running back Algernon Brown, who scored four touchdowns last week.\n“We’re doing the best we can to take advantage of the weapons we have. A good offense is able to do multiple things well,” he said. “It makes us tougher to stop. If we were just using one guy, it’s easy to key on that. When we distribute the ball like we’re doing and we establish a strong running game like we’ve been able to do, it makes our offense more dynamic and helps us win. It’s fun to see the progress and growth that’s come throughout the season. We still have a long ways to go. We’re still working hard to fine-tune things and be even more effective as an offense.”\nEMAIL: jeffc@deseretnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T02:59:26.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
