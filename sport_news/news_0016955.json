The focus here, second base. STATS THAT MATTER \n20: Jace Peterson finished his rookie season with 20 weighted runs created after the All-Star break, the second-lowest mark among all qualified MLB second basemen. \n1.1: Peterson wrapped up the '15 season with a 1.1 WAR, making him the first Braves second baseman to be worth more than one win above replacement since Dan Uggla's 19-homer 2012 season. \n186: The Atlanta Braves led the majors with 186 total double plays this season. Though Peterson was not among MLB's top fielding second basemen, in terms of defensive runs saved, he and shortstop Andrelton Simmons were a formidable combo up the middle for most of the season. THREE KEY QUESTIONS \n1. Has Jace Peterson ended the franchise's revolving door at second base? \nElliot Johnson, Tyler Pastornicky, Phil Gosselin , Tommy La Stella , Ramiro Pena ... the list continues. Over the past two seasons, the Braves second-base spot has experienced constant turnover — an overflow of near-replacement level production in the aftermath of Dan Uggla's late-career decline. \nAtlanta attempted to plug this hole by handing Alberto Callaspo a stop-gap $3 million contract at last year's Winter Meetings, but it was the acquisition of unheralded rookie Jace Peterson — a secondary piece in the Justin Upton trade, behind top prospect Max Fried — that did the trick. For a while, at least. \nPeterson stole the show in spring training and stormed out of the gate for the Braves, even filling the leadoff spot at times. By the time the All-Star break rolled around, his bat had cooled off, but he was still tied with outfielder Nick Markakis in WAR (0.9) and was holding his own in his first full season. The good times faded in the second half, though. The 25-year-old ended his campaign hitting .221/.293/.319 after the break, watching as fellow rookie Daniel Castro began stealing starts down the team's forgettable stretch. \nSo what does Peterson's quiet second half mean? \nAll told, he's the most promising second-base option the team has had since Uggla's bat was producing. He hasn't even reached arbitration and the physical tools are present and accounted for. And with the Braves sending former top prospect Jose Peraza to the Dodgers in the Hector Olivera trade, the farm system isn't exactly overflowing with challengers. Peterson is the Braves' best option at the moment, and there are bigger issues plaguing the team. \nIf the team elects to devote its money and attention elsewhere this offseason, leaving the job to Peterson (or another player within the organization if necessary) in the short term, it would be understandable. As the 2014 season can attest, it could be much worse.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T00:57:29.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
