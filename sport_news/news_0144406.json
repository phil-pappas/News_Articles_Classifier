By Holly Vanorse Spicer | Oct 02, 2015 Courtesy of: Justin Spicer Holly Vanorse Spicer and her son, Carter. \nSpending the better half of a decade in sports, covering events and games, I've seen a great many types of athletes from young to old. I spend equal parts of my time at these events and games I cover being reminded of moments in my own life when I was competing in a sport, and finding myself in awe of the talent around me. \nI tend to find myself in admiration and awe a lot in this job. One repeating moment is seeing parents run road races with their children in tow. Especially in a double stroller. Or better yet, not just running that race with a double stroller, with toddler-aged children, once, but twice because their other half was still out on the course. \nHow on earth? \nWhile I knew then, before having a child of my own, that stroller running was serious business, a part of me, after seeing these runners locally, thought it would still be easy. \nBecause those runners made it look easy. \nJust because it looks easy, doesn't mean that it is. Words of wisdom for us all to live by. \nIn the days before we found out we were expecting in June of last year, I was just 35-pounds under my 200-pound goal for back squatting. I was also just two-dozen pounds shy of my old personal best deadlift of 350 pounds. I got my younger sister to run her first 5K road race. And, on my own, I was scooting through three-mile runs around 23-minutes overall. \nI was strong, and I was fast — for me. However, in no way, did I expect after it was all said and done, to start right back where I left off. \nI, however, did make the mistake of thinking that getting back into the running game would be easier. Not easy, but easier. \nAs in: I can start working out again, where do I start? Let's pick running. We'll go light on weights, do some body weight stuff, but we'll really dig in with the running. The easiest of the options to pick because it just involves moving my body and no weights. As a personal trainer, I should know better. Proof that sometimes our minds are excellent at tricking us. \nOn Feb. 14, my husband, Justin, and I welcomed our first child, Carter, into the world. A beautiful and perfect Valentine's present to both of us. Settling into motherhood kept my mind occupied enough that working out and running were on a different planet. Which was perfect, because right up until that point, I had thought, given how active I was up to my son's birth, not being able to do all of the things I was doing, for six weeks, would be nearly impossible. \nBut after six weeks? It was like someone left the gate open to the pasture and Buddy, the herding dog, was feeling a bit mischievous. \nMy first stroller run was like a jump in the ocean in May. Thinking because it's almost summer, it'd be warm. Instead, it ends up feeling like swimming in ice cubes. Getting back into weight lifting proved to be far easier. \nFirst, it took probably around 20 minutes to even get going. It was the end of March, so spring had sort of sprung and it was starting to warm up. Kind of. We needed blanket, burp cloth, binkie, phone, water bottle, house keys, and about a million other small, easily losable items. With a newborn, you can't just hope you have it all and go, you've got to run through that check list a dozen times. Even then, as you're heading down the driveway, it still feels like you forgot something. \nSecond, even if you splurge on the five-star rated, highly-recommended jogging stroller, you have to remember, it's loaded with all of those 100 things, and a 10-pound baby in a snow suit that'd make an Eskimo envious. So guess what? Now you're pushing a weighted sled. \nWalks were easy breezy. By that point in my postpartum days, I was frequently walking around three miles with the baby and a friend of mine. Naturally, I started with a walk, and easing into the rest of it through intervals was the plan of attack. \nFive minutes in, the interval timer that I had set on my phone beeped, telling me that I now had to lightly jog for a half-minute. \nA half-minute, when you haven't run in nine months, is a long time. Even longer when, for the last two months of pregnancy, your baby had his head shoved up by your lungs, making it so even thinking about anything that might get your heart pumping, had you out of breath. \nSo, let's just say, I made it halfway to 30 seconds. And it was certainly more of a speed-walk than a really light jog. \nNext came the hills. Or should I say, hill. It was a small one, maybe it was more of a bump in the road. It still did not stop that hill from looking like, or feeling like, Mount Everest. \nTo keep in time with how I had planned my intervals, my next 30 seconds started at the bottom of this hill/bump. At only a little more than a mile into my excursion, I felt like I could walk/jog it, with little difficulty. Five seconds in, I forfeited my turn. Much like my nephew did as a toddler when we'd play Don't Break the Ice and he knew his turn was going to break the ice. \n\"You go next,\" he'd say. \nHere I was, the woman who was doing 300 kettlebell swings and 300 goblet squats every day the last week of pregnancy, right up to the day the baby came — now was cheating and skipping her turn. \nI marched right up that hill like it was nobody's business though. \nComing to the flat stretches of road, my brain fooled me into thinking it was a piece of cake. By now, we're inching to two miles (and getting closer to home thankfully), mom (me) is hot and sweaty, her water supply is dwindling, and those legs that once were incredibly strong for their small size, were tired. \nI had gone from pushing what felt like a 75-pound sled to one that was about to top out at 300 pounds. Those straight stretches became just as much of a challenge as even the smallest bump in the road. \nThe greatest thing about that first run with the stroller (and keep in mind, run is used very lightly in this instance), is the stroller itself. It wasn't the fresh air, seeing the snow melting, hearing that one bird that didn't realize spring wasn't actually here yet. That last quarter-mile stretch of my road was spent half laying on the top of the stroller, telling my son through the plastic \"sunroof,\" that mommy was silly and we were never doing that again. \nAfter a little break, and focusing more on getting my strength back through weight training, I saddled up that stroller and we set off again. There was a significant improvement, and every time I have run after that, and will run from here on out, will be more improving. Now, the only walking is the warm up and cool down, the miles between are all run. Albeit, a slower run than I once could complete, but it's still solid. \nThe next task on the to-do list? Adding a dog to the stroller running.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T16:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:25:01.670+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
