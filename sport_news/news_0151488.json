But we’re working for another spot.”\nAnd while their sights are firmly set on that end goal, there is no denying the significance of being able to outperform their past selves along the way.\nThough they’d need to win on Saturday and have the B.C Lions lose to the visiting Saskatchewan Roughriders the following day in order to secure a home playoff game for the second year in a row.\n“That’s huge for us,” said defensive halfback Aaron Grymes. “As easy as it is to say we take every game the same, once you get to this point in the season, down this stretch, games mean that much more.\n“Every game means a little bit more. If we win this one, the next game’s going to mean that much more. If we win that one, the next game. So as easy as it would be to say, ‘Oh, it’s just another game, we just want to win.’ No, we know what’s on the line.”\nThey already have one win over the Calgary Stampeders this year, which is something the Eskimos weren’t able to say in 2014, and have this year’s season-series decider scheduled for McMahon Stadium the next weekend with first-place implications.\n“We want that No. 1 spot in the West,” Willis said. “That’s more what we’re worried about. We’re not overlooking Winnipeg by any means because you’ve got to take it one game at a time.”\nAfter all, the first-place Stampeders are two points ahead of the Eskimos, who sit second at 9-4.\nBut it’s not always how many wins a team gets so much as when they get them.\n“When you make it to the playoffs, it’s not really about records,” Grymes said. “I think it’s the team with the momentum.\n“So if we can keep winning games and we go to the playoffs with the momentum, then we’re going to be a dangerous group.”\nSome would argue they already are.\n“Last year was last year, but this season there’s a better feeling about it,” said team-leading receiver Adarius Bowman. “I really can’t hit it right and I don’t know the correct word to use, I just know the feeling we have around here.”\nThe job now is to continue translating that feeling into a return trip to Winnipeg at the end of November.\n“Hopefully it will be a good audition for us,” Grymes said. “Let us get used to the city, let us get used to the field and get used to the locker-room.”\ngerry.moddejonge@sunmedia.ca\ntwitter.com/SunModdejonge\nEskimos can secure playoff spot with win Saturday, but players aiming higher\nBy Gerry Moddejonge , Edmonton Sun First posted: Thursday, October 01, 2015 06:33 PM EDT | Updated: Thursday, October 01, 2015 07:07 PM EDT\nA year ago, the Edmonton Eskimos clinched a playoff spot in Week 16 with a win over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers.\nThis year, they can get the job done one week sooner as they find themselves back in Winnipeg, where it just so happens the 2015 Grey Cup championship will be held at the end of November.\n“Oh, we can get a playoff spot this week?” Eskimos defensive end Odell Willis said. “That’s cool, but that ain’t the spot I want, you know?\n“It’s always good to know that you’re going to be around for an extra week after the season’s over, I feel that anybody would want to know that news.
