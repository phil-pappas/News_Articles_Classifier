We have played Poland and Ireland and not been beaten....\" \nA defeat in Georgia and Polish and Irish successes against Germany - the world champions only won one of their four matches against Scotland's qualification rivals - conspired to send Strachan's men out but the boss was in no mood to reflect on the campaign or his own future. \nAnd he disagreed with one assessment that a win over Poland would have been \"pointless\" anyway because of the Irish triumph - Martin O'Neill's side would then have needed to win in Warsaw on Sunday to have allowed Scotland third place. \n\"Whatever (there is) in life - points, money - pride is much more than anything else,\" Strachan said. \n\"If you have to deal with something like that, pride and a sense of achievement, whether it be a draw or good goals, you are always going to get that. \n\"Pointless is probably the game on Sunday. That will be a hard one, that will be a hard one to take. \n\"But over the year, a couple of offside goals, a couple of horrendous deflections, we have had to put up with a lot really. \n\"And to overcome that, then we will probably have to be more clinical over the next couple of years.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:52:17.996+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
