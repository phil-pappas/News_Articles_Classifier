Dominique Hawkins will undergo surgery tomorrow after breaking his right hand in practice. He is expected to return in early November. \nJohn Calipari said in a statement: \n“I really feel bad to have to report this because Dom was playing so well. He was so much more confident, so much more skilled. There was no doubt he was in the rotation , and now he’s just got to get back and stay in shape. We’re looking forward to getting him back in November.” \nThe prayers of the BBN are with you D-Hawk.
