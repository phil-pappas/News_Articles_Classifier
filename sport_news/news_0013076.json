The Richland School Board will consider options Oct. 13 for replacing the “C” at Carmichael Middle School. It was removed in early 2014 amid public outcry along with an “R” and “H,” representing Richland and Hanford high schools. Bob Brawdy Tri-City Herald file i Order Reprint of this Story \nThe large “C” removed from the hillside behind Richland’s Carmichael Middle School is closer to returning, though it may have a new home. \nThe Richland School Board will consider options Oct. 13 for the letter’s replacement. It was removed in early 2014 amid public outcry along with an “R” and “H,” representing Richland and Hanford high schools at neighboring Fran Rish Stadium. \nReplacing the large concrete letter was an option considered by the school’s parent-teacher organization and other stakeholders. But in a memo to the board from district and school administrators, those at the school prefer putting the letter on the building to make it easier to see and to minimize issues with safety and graffiti. \nThe letters were in place for decades, with the “R” poured by students in 1967. \nSchool officials said the letters were removed partially because they were a safety hazard but also so improvements could be made to the visitor side of Fran Rish. But the letters’ removal created a firestorm among district residents, with some calling for those responsible for the decision to be fired or board members to resign. The district has since said that there was a breakdown in communication and has taken steps to avoid a similar problem in the future. \nThe stadium improvements were finished this summer and the “R” and “H” returned to Fran Rish in time for football season this fall. \nAssistant Superintendent Todd Baddley said the preference of those at Carmichael is to see the “C” on the east outer wall of the middle school’s gym, which is near the location of the old “C.” It could be made of metal or painted in Carmichael’s signature blue color. The addition of lighting on the letter also would help make it easier to see and discourage vandalism. \nThe board’s decision on the location will allow district officials to collect quotes for the work, but Baddley said there is an effort to get cost estimates to see how the different options compare. \nThe board meets at 6:30 p.m. Oct. 13 at the district’s Administrative Service Center, 615 Snow Ave., Richland. \nTy Beaver: 509-582-1402; tbeaver@tricityherald.com ; Twitter: @_tybeaver Related content", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T07:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T08:52:28.493+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
