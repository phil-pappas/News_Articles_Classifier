According to media reports Stewart said, “They have done their punishment. That’s what we expected which is that once you have completed your ban, you are entitled to come back into the game and play again”. Stewart added that more players will now be cautious before thinking about breaking rules. Pakistan and England are gearing up for an exciting Test series with the first match of the series starting from October 13. Reportedly, Stewart said Amir’s presence in the Pakistan side for the upcoming series against England would have made things interesting. He also believes that Pakistan will start as favourites in the upcoming series against his nation’s side in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
