He is shaking, yet resolute. He’s rehearsed this conversation in his head dozens of times. But that’s just practice. This is game time. \nChris Burns is the only openly gay assistant or head coach among the roughly 3,000 coaches in men's and women's Division I basketball. (Photo: Stew Milne, USA TODAY Sports) \n“There are parts of this business that lead me to believe what I’m about to tell you is not acceptable here,” the assistant coach says. “This is something I struggle with. It’s made me consider giving up coaching. It’s made me think I’m not supposed to be here.” Players are wide-eyed. Burns takes a deep breath. “I’m a gay man,” he says, at last. \nHe goes on to say he hopes none of this will affect the players negatively, that he wants it to unite them. Bryant’s players surround him with hugs. They tell him they love him. He can exhale. \n“There was an initial shock factor,” senior forward Curtis Oakley tells USA TODAY Sports. “But everyone was, like, ‘Yo, Burns, we rockin’ with you.’ It was all love.” \nIn recent years, athletes such as Michael Sam, a college linebacker who hasn't made an NFL roster, Jason Collins, a former NBA center, Derrick Gordon, a basketball player at UMass and now Seton Hall, and many others have come out. But Burns is now the only openly gay assistant or head coach among the roughly 3,000 coaches in men's and women's Division I basketball. His Bulldogs will open their season next month at defending national champion Duke. \nChris Burns starred at Bryant University as a player and returned to the school in 2012.

The ripples he’s creating are huge. To me, it’s a huge step in the right direction for our sport because it can allow others who don’t feel like they can be who they are to do the same.” \nThe story of how Burns came to be in that locker room, tentatively telling his truth, is one of freedom won by small steps. He opened up to his family first. He told head coach Tim O’Shea more than a year ago. In recent weeks he informed the rest of the coaching staff and key members of the Bryant athletics department. He confided in the team’s three captains and then, days later, stood before the team. \n“Before he went in, he was sick nervous,” Bryant assistant coach Frankie Dobbs says. “You could tell he’s been planning the speech for the last 15 years.” Duke’s Mike Krzyzewski applauds first openly gay hoops coach Chris Burns \nTruth begat relief. “I can’t say enough about believing in the good in people, the good in human beings,” Burns says, eyes moist. “They can surprise you, energize you, give you a reason to believe in the good in the world.” \nBurns, 31, is largely unknown to the wider world but he’s a pillar of Bryant basketball. The sharpshooting point guard led the Bulldogs to Division II’s 2005 national championship game and the banner for that runner-up finish hangs in the Chace Athletic Center. Behind it is a blown-up photo of Burns dribbling around Syracuse’s Eric Devendorf in 2006. Burns scored 33 points that night — six three-pointers, six assists — in a 92-86 road loss. Why haven't more coaches come out as gay? \n“I think it helps a lot that he can hoop because it brings the respect factor,” says Oakley, nephew of former NBA star Charles Oakley. The revelation also upped the trust factor. “We’re all like, ‘Yo, what else can he keep from us if tells us this?’ ” Oakley says. “You feel like you can go to him for anything.” \nO’Shea arrived as head coach in 2008 as Bryant began its transition to Division I and the Bulldogs will be striving for their first trip to D-1’s Big Dance this season. That’ll take teamwork. \nChris Burns, middle, with his support group, friend Lauren Tebsherany, left, Tristan Hobbes, middle right and Mike MacDonald. (Photo: Bryant Athletics) \n“I thought the pope had a great statement, saying we need to see people as individuals,” O’Shea says. “To me, this issue is very similar. All gay people are not the same. It’s really about the individual. Knowing Chris, his heart, and that he’s a great coach and has the players’ best interest in mind, that’s a big reason why I feel comfortable giving him my full support. He’s not trying to become a celebrity here. My biggest thing is, ‘Team first.’ ” \nBurns has another team, too. He had the support of his family and friends as well as advocates in the close-knit LGBT community. Crucially, if he was to be his authentic self publicly, he felt he’d need the backing of an inner circle where he felt most authentic — a trio of best friends, all members of the athletics department. \nBurns counted on compliance coordinator Mike MacDonald to hold him accountable and Tristan Hobbes of athletic communications for good humor and director of women’s basketball operations Lauren Tebsherany to pick up his spirit when depression left him crippled in bed; she once wrote him a six-page letter expressing everything she loved about him. “He's doing this to be authentic to them, to take off the mask. He's doing this so a 15-year-old can be himself. He's 31 and done hiding, so others don't have to.” Mike Macdonald, friend of Chris Burns \nMacDonald and Hobbes are his housemates and they waited in the hallway on the late September day when Burns told the captains. That morning, Tebsherany tweeted a quote from an author, Laurell K. Hamilton: Before I knew you, I thought brave was not being afraid. You’ve taught me that bravery is being terrified & doing it anyway. \n“Without them being there, I could have found an excuse not to do it,” Burns says. “Those three carried me.” \nMacDonald says, \"Chris' job is all about relationships — when he's recruiting or spending time with players. He's doing this to be authentic to them, to take off the mask. He's doing this so a 15-year-old can be himself. He's 31 and done hiding, so others don't have to.\" USA TODAY Sports' Scott Gleeson with the exclusive story of Bryant University's Chris Burns, the first openly gay Division I men’s basketball coach. USA TODAY Sports Love and basketball The game becomes a best friend \nHalf a lifetime ago, Burns was that 15-year-old. He grew up as a typical basketball junkie: Posters, SLAM Magazine, growing collection of basketball shoes. (He's up to 140 pairs now, including every Jordan.) \nBurns torched Syracuse for 33 points in a near-upset when Bryant was still Division II. (Photo: Bryant Athletics) \n\"He used to play with the Little Tikes hoop\" as a toddler, \"then as he grew he got the Nerf hoop in the basement,\" his mother, Susan Marchesano, recalls. \"My husband and I would be in bed at night and hear him playing. He'd be emulating Michael Jordan down there. It was basketball 24/7.\" \nBurns didn't crack the roster of his eighth-grade basketball team. He made the freshman team in high school, but as a 4-11 guard didn't play much. Then he sprouted 12 inches his sophomore year — and as his stature grew, so did his playing time. By his senior year, Burns was named Mr. Basketball in New Hampshire. \nAnd all the while, he started to sense his attraction to men. The basketball court had always been Burns' safe haven. But as he grew older he felt the game he fell in love with as a child was holding him hostage. \nA letter Chris Burns, 31, says he would write to a 14-year-old Chris Burns.

It gave me purpose and an identity at a very young age. But as time passed I felt trapped in that identity, like I had to choose one or the other.” \nHis mother feels her son's pain. \"He's loved basketball since he was four years old,\" she says. \"He took to it like a fish to water. It truly is his best friend. Coming out to everyone is risking losing that.\" \nShe cries softly as she speaks to USA TODAY Sports in an emotional conversation before her son went public. \"If I could talk to his best friend, I'd beg him to let my son be free,\" she says of basketball. \"And I'd say, 'Thank you for being his best friend. Thank you for keeping his secret, for holding him up when I couldn't, when no one could understand his pain.' \n\"Being gay isn't who Chris is. It's a part of him. He's more than a gay man. He's more than a basketball player. He's more than a basketball coach. I hate this pain he's gone through, but it's made him someone I'm so proud of.\" A double life 'I’ve been in survival mode since I was 14' \nAs a player, Burns steered Bryant to four consecutive Division II NCAA tournaments, including a 63-58 loss to Virginia Union in 2005's national championship in which he was named player of the game. Then Burns spent three years in New Hampshire with the semipro Manchester Millrats, two as a player and the last as a coach. From there he was an assistant coach at Rhode Island College for two seasons and returned to Bryant in 2012. \nChris Burns spent two years as an assistant coach at Rhode Island College.

But as a coach there, he knew he was hiding it. \n“There was me as a dedicated basketball coach,” he says, “and me as a gay guy where I’d find myself in another world.” \nBurns had started this double life in high school and college, dating girls and \"doing enough\" to fit in and maintain a heterosexual image for his teammates and friends. \n“I’ve been in survival mode since I was 14,” he says. \nDuring the emotional chaos that accompanied his hidden life, Burns met Anthony Nicodemo. \n\"From the moment I saw him, I was attracted to him and interested in him,\" Burns says. \"And then he turned out to be a basketball coach. We ended up in the same place a lot and connected. After a while, it just kind of happened. We didn't grasp what it meant at the time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:22:33.803+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
