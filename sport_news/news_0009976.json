Prosise ran for 143 yards and two touchdowns, and DeShone Kizer threw two scoring passes, the second the 10-yarder to Robinson that made it 38-31. The Irish (6-1) also added a touchdown by former USC player Amir Carlisle on a blocked punt. \nSouthern California played for the first time since firing coach Steve Sarkisian on Monday. Clay Helton directed the Trojans as interim coach. Helton said he was proud of the fight the Trojans showed. \n\"We had great momentum going into the second half. And then, at the end of the day, mistakes hurt us, whether it was penalties, special teams, some missed tackles and some turnovers on offense,\" Helton said. \"You can't have those mistakes.\" \nThe victory looked in doubt when the Trojans (3-3) scored three straight touchdowns to take a 31-24 lead as the Trojans scored on a 75-yard catch by JuJu Smith-Schuster and Adoree Jackson scored on an 83-yard pass. But the Irish rallied to win the Jeweled Shillelagh for the third time in four seasons. \n\"If you miss a tackle, those kids are gone,\" Kelly said. \"They make you pay dearly, and we missed some tackles.\" \nIt marked the first time in seven tries the Irish beat the Trojans after losing by 30 or more the season before. \nCody Kessler threw two touchdown passes and ran for another score for USC, but the Irish picked him off two passes in the fourth quarter to put the game away. \nIn a game of shifting momentum, the Irish scored 40 points against the Trojans for the first time since 1977 when Norte Dame warmed up in blue jerseys, then came out in green jerseys and beat USC 49-19 en route to the national championship. \nThe Trojans lost consecutive games for the first time since losing three straight to end the 2012 season. USC has three losses this early in the season for the first time since starting 1-4 in Pete Carroll's first year as coach in 2001. \nThe loss also adds to the mounting troubles the Trojans are facing with a game next week against No. 4 Utah followed by a game at No. 23 California. USC athletic director Pat Haden, who spent 12 years as a color analyst on Notre Dame television broadcasts, was feeling lightheaded just before kickoff and was taken to the locker room. Haden made a stop at the hospital, then headed back to Los Angeles on a private plane. \nHaden has been under scrutiny for his hiring of Sarkisian and for allowing Sarkisian to continue to coach after slurring his words and using inappropriate language during an event in August and other struggles by the football team. \nProsise started the go-ahead drive with runs of 17 and 25 yards, then Notre Dame, burned by a double-pass by USC earlier in the game, responded when Torii Hunter Jr. took a backward pass from Kizer and threw a 35-yard pass to Alize Jones at the 12-yard line. The pass by Hunter made up for a fumble into the end zone earlier in the game. Corey Robinson then made a diving catch in the end zone on a pass from Kizer for 10-yard score. It was the first touchdown catch of the season for Robinson. \nKessler, coming off on of the worst performances in his college career, being sacked five times and being held to 156 yards passing with no touchdowns and two interceptions, was 30-of-46 passing for 365 yards. He had passed for six touchdowns against the Irish a season ago. The Trojans amassed 590 yards total offense. \n\"Any time that you go out there and you get almost 600 yards, something is going right,\" Helton said. \"I really thought the difference in the game was you have the two turnovers in the fourth quarter which you can't have.\" \nKizer was 15 of 24 for 227 yards and Notre Dame compiled 476 yards of offense. \nAP College Football website: http://www.collegefootball.ap.org \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T07:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:31:05.625+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
