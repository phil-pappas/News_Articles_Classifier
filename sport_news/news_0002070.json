Coaches kind of said, ‘We have to establish our running game,’” Holmes said. “We’ve kind of been soft in the running game the past couple weeks. So coming out that second half, that’s when we wanted to make a statement. … At the end of the day, we gotta run the ball — that’s the statement that Michigan State brings.” \nOn a day that belonged to Connor Cook and the passing attack, which paced the season-high 540 yards of total offense, the Spartans’ running game didn’t pick up much traction until an 85-yard fourth quarter to finish with 142 for the game. Cook stellar as MSU routs Indiana, 52-26 \n\"I want to run the ball more effectively than we did the first half,\" Dantonio said of the 31 ground yards through two quarters, 20 of them coming from Cook. \"Really, we didn't run it until the fourth quarter effectively.\" \nScott ran 11 times in the game for 68 yards, with 26 coming on his late fourth-quarter scoring run. Holmes got his first career start and ran for 39 yards on 10 carries, one of them his 22-yard score moments after Scott’s. Holmes also caught two passes for 28 yards, one of them a 20-yarder on a route readjustment. \nDelton Williams also had his first touchdown of the season, one of six carries for 5 yards. Madre London missed his second straight game with an injury. \n“I think there are three or four guys who make plays for us,” Dantonio said. “You could make a case for Gerald Holmes to be the No. 1 guy. You could say Madre London is the No. 1, and you could certainly say LJ Scott is No. 1. Delton Williams, because of his past, too, you could sit there and say he deserves the opportunity to play and get back in. \n“We're going to always ride the hot guy.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T22:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T04:09:41.591+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
