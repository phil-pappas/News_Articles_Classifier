While both Terry Collins and Harvey clearly believe Harvey will start more than once, here’s how GM Sandy Alderson addressed that issue:\n“As we’ve said all along, it’s a matter of appearance to appearance and how he feels. So that’s a determination we’ll make after his first start. We’ll see. But certainly starting him in Game 1 creates a certain presumption that he’ll pitch more than once in the series, but that’s not a decision we’ve made.\nLIVE BLOG: FOLLOW THE NLCS BETWEEN THE METS AND CUBS\n“We’re comfortable with running any one of four guys out there, so you know, it’s not a decision that we have to make immediately, but certainly he’s lined up for Game 1, and we’ll see how he comes out of that.”\nThat’s a bit different than Collins’ answer to this question: Do you plan on pitching Matt more than Game 1 this series?\n“Absolutely,” Collins replied.\nWhatever happens, one thing is certain. Harvey, who missed all of last year recovering from Tommy John surgery and has endured innings-limits controversy this season, is eager for another postseason opportunity. And he loves the idea of potentially having more of an impact on this best-of-seven series than he did with a single start in the five-game first round.\nFOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \"LIKE\" US HERE\n“I think that was part of the reason why I wanted to get in Game 5,” said Harvey, who had told Collins he wanted to be available in relief. “Obviously, now going into a seven-game series and having the opportunity to line up for two games, I couldn’t be happier and more ready for it.”\nIn his first taste of postseason pitching, Harvey beat the Dodgers in Game 3 of the NLDS. But he lasted only five innings, giving up three runs (two earned). Certainly not the stuff of boyhood dreams, which makes him hungrier to shine now.\nBoth he and Collins were buoyed by the idea that Harvey will be on a more regular routine heading into his matchup with the Cubs’ Jon Lester. Down the stretch and before his NLDS outing, rest was more irregular as the Mets tried to limit his workload, though he still threw 189.1 innings in compiling a 13-8 record and 2.71 ERA.\nMETS - CUBS MATCHUPS: POSITION-BY-POSITION LOOK AT NLCS\n“I’m not using 10 days off as an excuse,” Harvey said. But, he added, “As a starting pitcher, to get into a routine with that going on, it’s a little bit difficult.\n“I think I was mostly excited to get a chance to get back out there again and have a normal routine, normal rest period, and I’m definitely looking forward to (Game 1).”\nIf he thrives, he perhaps can steer the conversation away from innings limits and his Tommy John recovery. He’d like that.\n“I think everybody kind of had enough talk and discussion about that whole ordeal,” Harvey said. “I’ll be the last person to ever bring that one up again.”\nStill, it’s part of his season. At the very least, how he’s handled it all got him some praise from Alderson Friday.\n“I have a tremendous amount of respect for Matt and what he has accomplished this year, and coming back from that surgery, pitching as much as he has, as well as he has, and his determination to pitch in the postseason.\nThere was a little tumult along the way, and I think he’s learned a lot from the experience, and he’s probably a much better pitcher and person as a result.\n“But it wasn’t going to be smooth throughout — that’s what seasons are about. They’re long and involve ups and downs. I can understand a certain reservation on his part as he got closer to what some people felt was a large number, and he got through that, and I think he has confidence now in his physical capacity, which is important for his mental approach. So I think he’s come through it really well, and I’m very proud of what he’s been able to accomplish this season.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports", "http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/mets/mets-cubs-matchups-position-by-position-nlcs-article-1.2401017", "http://www.nydailynews.com/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://liveblog.nydailynews.com/Event/New_York_Mets_vs_Chicago_Cubs_NL_Championship_Series"], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T16:48:07.914+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
