Through six games they have not only lived up to it, but have surpassed it. The Cougars defense is only allowing 18 points per game, while their offense is racking up nearly 46. With numbers like that it's no wonder they are 6-0. \n\"I think we have done a really good job executing our assignments every game. We have the mentality that we want to be 1-0 and to take care of the next opponent that is coming up on our schedule. I think we have done a really good job both offensively and defensively of executing our assignments and doing what our coaches coach us up to do,\" USF Junior WR Josh Angulo said. \nWhile the players give the credit to their coaching staff, Head Coach Jed Stugart, gives it to his players. Luke Papilion leads the NSIC in yards per game with 342 and touchdowns with 23, 18 through the air. With stats like that it's no wonder the junior quarterback is up for the Harlon Hill award, which is the DII equivalent to the Heisman Trophy. \n\"The kids rally behind him. He considers himself one of the guys and they respect that, because he works so hard,\" Stugart said. \"He knows he has a lot of talent around him and he will be the first to acknowledge that,\" he added. \n\"Our offensive line has been playing great and they give me a ton of time in the backfield. My personal success has really come from everything that the team has been doing. My teammates have put me in this position,\" Papilion said. \nPapilion and his Cougars will once again be tested this weekend when they travel to take on a 5-1 SMSU team. However, as is every week in the tough Northern Sun, could this week be a trap game knowing they host their rivals from Augie the following week? \n\"Absolutely not,\" Paplion exclaimed. \"SMSU is a great football team and we know that. We know that they are going to show up and be ready to go Saturday night. We have to prepare and take care of business this week. We'll focus on Augie next week,\" he added. \n\"We have to focus on SMSU, they are no joke. If we don't come focused and ready to go they are going jump all over us. We have to be ready to go and we are definitely not looking past them,\" Angulo said. \nThe Cougars and Mustangs will kick off this Saturday in Marshall, Minnesota at 6 o'clock inside Mattke Field. The Augie USF matchup will air live on My-UTV Saturday, October 24th at 2:30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T07:03:43.196+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
