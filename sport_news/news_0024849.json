Ann Heisenfelt/Associated Press FOX Sports North James Carlton Share This Story Updated Oct 18, 2015 at 5:08p ET \nWhen the 2015 season started, Minnesota was considered one of the favorites to win the Big Ten West. \nAfter going 3-1 in the nonconference slate and splitting its first two league games, Minnesota's matchup at home on Saturday against struggling Nebraska was a huge one. \nBut despite an unexpectedly impressive passing performance from quarterback Mitch Leidner , the Gophers couldn't run the ball or stop the Cornhuskers on defense, ultimately losing in a rout, 48-25. It was Nebraska's first conference win of the season. \nNow, Minnesota embarks on the most difficult three-game stretch of its season and has almost surely taken itself out of the Big Ten West race. \nLet's take a look back at Saturday's game at TCF Bank Stadium and see what went wrong. CLASS LESSONS \n-- Before moving on to the bad and ugly, let's start with the good. Leidner had one of his best games with the Gophers, and certainly his best first half. On the opening possession, he was 4 for 5 passing on a nine-play, 75-yard drive that ended with a touchdown pass to wide receiver Eric Carter for an early lead. In the first half, Leidner completed 16 of 17 passes for 156 yards. He eventually finished 26 of 40 for a career-high 301 yards with the touchdown and two interceptions, though the pair of picks both came late in the fourth quarter and were situational -- desperation passes forced downfield late. It was an encouraging game for the junior, but it's troubling for the Gophers that even in one of Leidner's best performances, they still lost. \n-- Piggybacking a bit on the end of the previous point, the Gophers clearly lost the turnover battle, 3-0, but it wasn't as sloppy as that statistic makes it look. Besides a first-quarter lost fumble on a run by Shannon Brooks , Minnesota took care of the ball until the end of the game, when Leidner was trying to make something happen. Unfortunately, Nebraska didn't give the ball away at all, and the Cornhuskers are 12-0 since 2012 when they win the turnover battle. \n-- Minnesota's defense may not be good, after all. In three Big Ten games, the Gophers have given up 27 points to a Northwestern team that hasn't really scored on anyone else, held Purdue to only 13, and then allowed a season-high 48 to Nebraska. They were beaten through the air (261 yards) and on the ground (203), as the Cornhuskers' superb offensive balance kept the Gophers on their toes and guessing. For most of the game, Nebraska looked and played more physical than Minnesota. DULY NOTED \n-- Eric Carter is a playmaker. The 5-foot-11 sophomore had the best game of his collegiate career, catching four passes for 91 yards and a score. He had the touchdown reception on the opening drive and then later showed great speed, vision and elusiveness on a 31-yard catch-and-run. With nine minutes left in the fourth quarter, with the Gophers down 16 points and needing a big play, he delivered, leaping up to make a catch along the left sideline for a 29-yard gain. His 22.8-yard average on four receptions showed he needs to be getting the ball more often. \n-- All-Big Ten cornerback Briean Boddy-Calhoun returned from his knee injury Saturday and played for the first time in three weeks. The results were mixed; he didn't appear limited and was targeted too often, but he was the victim of one of the top plays of the season. Early in the fourth quarter, Boddy-Calhoun was defending Nebraska receiver De'Mornay Pierson-El in the end zone. As the ball came down, Pierson-El tipped it to himself between two Gophers defenders and caught it for a touchdown that put the Cornhuskers up 38-14.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T01:09:11.866+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
