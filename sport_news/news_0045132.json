As wins accumulate for Ohio State, their bandwagon gets smaller. The Buckeyes were the first unanimous No. 1 pick in the history of the Associated Press preseason poll with 61 votes. But after narrowly escaping Indiana 34-27 on Oct. 3, the Buckeyes were first on 38 ballots, seven fewer than the previous week. Meanwhile, Maryland's second season in the Big Ten got off to a rough start when the Terrapins had 105 yards of total offense in a 28-0 loss to Michigan last week. \nKEY MATCHUP \nMaryland defensive back William Likely vs. Ohio State punter Cameron Johnston. If the Terrapins can stymie the Buckeyes' offense then Likely becomes a weapon. He leads the nation in punt return touchdowns with two and ranks fourth in punt return average (24.0 yards). \nPLAYERS TO WATCH \nMaryland: Running back Brandon Ross. The Terrapins quarterbacks have been spotty at best but if they are to upset Ohio State, controlling the clock with Ross could be the key. He has 402 yards on a 5.5 yards average with two touchdowns. \nOhio State: Hybrid back Curtis Samuel. He had 104 total yards from scrimmage and a rushing TD against Western Michigan on Sept. 26 but just one carry for four yards vs. Indiana. Expect that to change Saturday. \nFACTS & FIGURES \nMaryland will play at Ohio Stadium for the first time. . Ohio State has fumbled 14 times and lost six this season. Last season the Buckeyes lost 14 of 24 in 15 games. . The Terrapins are 2-3 all-time against top-ranked teams. . Ohio State has won 18 straight games and 25 regular season conference games in a row. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T23:45:12.695+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
