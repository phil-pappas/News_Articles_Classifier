Posted: Thursday, October 8, 2015 8:19 am Wildcats fall to host Panthers Friday All the scoring in the Anna-Jonesboro Community High School football game was saved for the final quarter last Friday night, Oct. 2. But the Wildcats could only manage one touchdown in that eventful quarter and lost to host Pinckneyville 14-7. “I don’t know if we played our best game,” A-J coach Brett Detering said. “Our defense gave up 14 points and we kind of feel we should have won.” Pinckneyville improved to 4-2 overall and A-J fell to 2-4. The Panthers opened the final quarter at the end of a 10-play drive that was capped by a 6-yard run by Alex Howard. Dylan Carns’ extra point kick boosted Pinckneyville to a 7-0 lead with 9:13 remaining in the final period. The drive was centered around a 26-yard pass from quarterback Clayton Hougland to Carns. “We had a chance to make a defensive stop on third and goal from the six and we didn’t do it,” Detering said. “It does change the outlook.” The Wildcats further shot themselves in the foot on the next drive when they were forced to punt deep in their own territory. “We didn’t finish drives and special teams hurt us,” Detering added. “We had some mistakes on offense.” A bad center snap allowed the Panthers to recover the ball deep in A-J territory. Two plays later, Hougland scored on a 1-yard plunge. Carns’ extra point kick boosted the Panthers to a 14-0 lead with 6:44 remaining in the game. The Wildcats next drive was thwarted midfield and after the Panthers were forced to punt, A-J’s offense finally got rolling. Quarterback Jake Stark connected with Collin Prather for a 65-yard touchdown strike on the first play. Dakota Earnhart’s extra point kick pulled A-J to 14-7 with 4:20 remaining in the game. “Collin found a seam in the middle and cut it to 14-7,” Detering noted. However, Pinckneyville held the ball the rest of the game when time expired. Neither team could mount much offensive threat in the first half. However, the second half was completely different. The Wildcats opened the second half with a lengthy drive that stalled when Trenton Turner was halted on a fourth down play at the 4-yard line. “We started the drive on the 30 and went all the way down to the 4,” Detering said. “That should have been a big score and we didn’t put it on the board. It was a big momentum shift.” A-J’s lengthy drive consumed 7:22 of the third quarter. The Panthers first score came following that crucial stop at the goal line. The Wildcats were hit with a rash of injuries in the game to Ryan Hileman, Nick Jimenez and Clover. All their status was unknown for this weekend’s game. “We have a lot of guys sidelined with injuries,” said Detering, who noted with a lack of depth on the team that has created problems with some players never leaving the field. Pinckneyville had 159 yards rushing and 89 yards passing. A-J was held to 135 yards rushing with Alec Gold leading the way with 114 yards in 27 carries. Quarterback Stark was limited to 1 of 9 for 65 yards passing with two interceptions. “We’re much better moving on the ground,” Detering said. “It seems to fit our personnel better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T16:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:37:37.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
