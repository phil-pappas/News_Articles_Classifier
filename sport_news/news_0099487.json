Here are three observations:\nThe Bulls’ defense has been inconsistent\nThe Bulls put the Pelicans on the free-throw line 37 times. They allowed 48.3 percent shooting, including 44 percent from beyond the arc. That’s how a 20-point lead disappears.\n“We have to somehow take a stand and stay in front of our man,” coach Fred Hoiberg said. “You can say what you want about our offense, but defensively we could not stay in front.”\nObviously, getting Taj Gibson and Joakim Noah in the lineup can help. And the Bulls are adjusting to a new system. But one thing Hoiberg has talked about is maintaining the defensive identity in place when he took over while establishing his offensive system.\n“We rely too much on our offense rather than our defense. That can’t happen,” Jimmy Butler said. “It’s preseason. Everybody’s learning. It’s all very new to us. When we’re scoring well like we were in the first half, we think we’re going to continue to make shots and we don’t have to guard. And then it happens. We take our foot off that pedal and stop guarding.”\nButler has struggled from the field since the first game\nThat’s now 5-for-28 shooting since his efficient 23-points-in-25-minutes exhibition opener against the Bucks. Butler isn’t getting many isolation plays called for him and isn’t getting much in transition either. Worse, he has attempted just 11 free throws over his last three games after getting to the line 12 times in the opener.\nButler ranked sixth in free-throw attempts per game last season at 7.1.\n“Just gotta continue to take the right shots,” Butler said. “It will turn around. I know I put in the work. Keep taking the shots and they’ll fall. Keep getting in the paint. But more than anything, I have to keep making the right play.”\nBobby Portis likes referring to himself as Bobby Portis\nThe first-round pick also can play a bit. And he could be making some rotation decisions difficult for Hoiberg.\nPortis dropped 20 points and 11 rebounds on the Pelicans in 30 minutes, taking advantage of early foul trouble by Nikola Mirotic to deliver strong first-quarter minutes.\n“I’m just trying to be Bobby Portis and bring positive energy,” said Portis, who often refers to himself in the third person. “I’m picking things up well.”\nHoiberg agreed. And that’s why he admitted the rotation could be in flux.\n“He gave us such a lift. He was hitting shots, banging around, getting offensive rebounds. I thought he battled defensively,” Hoiberg said. “He had a tough matchup with Anthony Davis but it was a great learning experience for him. I’ve been really happy with the overall energy he has given us every time he has stepped on the floor.\n“We still haven’t had one of our key guys in Taj. It may be an evolving thing. It may not be the final rotation right at the beginning of the season. Everybody will have to be ready to play. Everybody is going to have to be ready to sacrifice for us to get where we wanted to be.”\nPrivacy Policy Copyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Chicago Bulls Fred Hoiberg Jimmy Butler New Orleans Pelicans Anthony Davis Taj Gibson", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d0cb2/turbine/ct-3-pointers-bulls-exhibition-loss-pelicans-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-13T16:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:18:46.201+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
