It was a game of sloppy tackling, inspired running and key turnovers from both sides. The Demons wasted no time getting started. After forcing the Tigers to a quick four and out on the first drive, Demons running back Matt Osier broke free from his own 40 yard line for a 60-yard touchdown run down the Glenwood sideline with less than 2 minutes off the clock. The Tigers managed to get a hand on the point after to keep the game at 6-0. But the Tigers couldn’t keep momentum on their side and were forced to punt again from their own 35 yard line. On the Demons’ second drive, Osier and quarterback Jake Townsley put on a show, each running for 15 yards on clutch third downs to stay deep in Tigers territory. Osier barreled through defenders again just outside of the red zone for another touchdown, only to see his team fail to find the endzone on the two-point conversion. It was another clutch stop for the Tigers defense, but with six minutes still remaining in the first quarter they were already down by 12. Then came the turnovers. The Tigers finally found their feet in the running game, with sophomore quarterback Vale Hildebrand squeezing through defenders on failed run plays to keep the drive alive. The Demons snatched up a fumble on their 45 yard line — the first of four in the game — but struggled to find anything with the passing game. Both teams failed to do much of anything through the air in the first half. After getting stuffed for a loss, the Demons went for a run on third and long. The run led to a scrum, and after a bit of confusion in the pile Summit sophomore Jason Tilley emerged with the ball and sped down the line for a 40-yard touchdown as the clock expired on the first quarter. Summit also failed the two-point, but the defensive TD quickly injected fire into the cold and discouraged line. It was the first time Summit had scored in the first 12 minutes since the home opener against Skyview. On the first play of the second quarter, the Demons had another fumble on a run play that was snatched up by the Summit line. The Tigers took over on the Demons’ 30 yard line and finally completed the first pass of the game, this time with senior Riley Beck at quarterback and Hilderbrand at receiver. The Demons line held strong after, forcing the Tigers to go for the first down on fourth and three at the Glenwood 18. Yet another running back came into the mix in the red zone, senior Drew Chastain, and he soon powered through missed tackles and a glaring gap to give the Tigers the lead, 13-12. With plenty of time left in the second quarter, the Demons put together a string of big runs and their first passing plays of the game. Osier and Townsley set the pace again, with the QB sneaking through the middle to get the ball close enough for his running back to get an easy touchdown. This time they completed the two-point conversion to jump past And that was the end of the Tigers’ night. They failed to find the endzone after taking over with four minutes left in the first half, then returned to the field in the second for a war of attrition. Both teams failed to do much on offense or defense until the Demons forced another touchdown deep in Tigers territory. Townsely held onto the ball for the next three plays, picking up 10 and 15 yards on two keepers for the final touchdown of the game. The Tigers spent nearly eight minutes trying for another score early in the fourth — Hildebrand even had not one, but two fake punts for first downs — but penalties and a key interception by Glenwood’s Connor Wall killed their momentum. The Tigers head to Steamboat Springs (2-6) on Oct. 30 and then to Rifle (7-1) On Nov. 6 for the season finale.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:00:39.507+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
