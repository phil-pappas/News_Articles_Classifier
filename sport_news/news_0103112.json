He's still not going to take it. \nWith his team behind 0-2 in the best-of-7 series, Maddon said at a press conference on Monday that right-hander Jason Hammel will be his man for Game 4 at Wrigley Field on Tuesday night. Lester, who pitched the series opener at Citi Field, presumably would be available for Game 5 the next day, if the series continues that long. \n(USATSI) \nDuring the regular season, Hammel posted a 3.74 ERA in 31 starts with a 172 strikeouts in 170 2/3 innings, but in the second half he had a 5.10 ERA and allowed an .856 on-base plus slugging. The other rested option for the Cubs would be Kyle Hendricks -- who allowed three home runs in Game 2 of the NLDS against the Cardinals -- but he also wasn't as good a Hammel in the regular season. \nLester posted a 3.34 ERA in 32 starts during the regular season, his first with Cubs after signing a $155 million free-agent contract in the offseason. Lester came to the Cubs having earned a highly respected postseason reputation, but he has allowed 13 earned runs over his past 21 1/3 innings in the playoffs covering three starts -- reminding us that no one is a sure thing. Lester's career 2.85 ERA in 98 playoff innings remains sterling, but he's also never started a playoff game on fewer than four days of rest. \nIf the Cubs used him that way in this series, Lester probably would have to make it a short outing, and it just might not be worth it to try. \nHammel started the deciding Game 4 of the NLDS against the Cardinals, which the Cubs won 6-4 with Hammel throwing the first three innings. He allowed two runs, three hits and three walks before seven Cubs relievers finished. Hammel's overall results in the playoffs -- a 5.00 ERA in 18 innings over five outings with the Cubs, Athletics and Rays -- are a bit misleading. In 2012, he made a pair of starts for the Rays against the Yankees in the ALDS in which he allowed two runs over 5 2/3 innings. The Rays lost both of those games, but if Hammel gives the Cubs that against the Mets, they'll take it and run. \n(USATSI)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T23:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T00:16:33.573+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
