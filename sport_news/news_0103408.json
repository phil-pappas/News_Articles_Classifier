Derrik Pouliot then corralled the puck and advanced it to Oskar Sundqvist, who raced down and found Wilson alone in front of the net. \n“As a goalie, I think you can have a huge impact on 3-on-3 if you’re able to make kind of a highlight-reel save at one end,” said Murray, who had 40 saves. “You can give your team a lot of momentum heading the other way, and that’s what happened tonight.” \nSullivan said earlier in the week he’d wished his team had more time to work on its special teams. On Friday, eight Penguins penalties led to six Bruins power plays — all of which Wilkes-Barre/Scranton managed to kill off. \n“The upside was that we got a lot of practice at (our penalty kill),” Sullivan said. “I thought (the PK) got a lot better as the game went on, but we’ve got to do a better job with our discipline overall if we’re going to have success on a consistent basis.” \nWilson netted the Pens’ first goal of the season in the second period when he took a feed in the slot from Conor Sheary, spun around, and flung it passed Zane McIntyre, who had 38 saves. \nIt wasn’t until Providence’s 38th shot of the night that Murray proved to be human. \nMoments after turning away a shot by Providence’s Alexander Khokhachev, the puck found its way to rookie Frank Valtrano on the sideboards. Valtrano gathered it and sent it past Murray for the Bruins’ lone goal. \n“We just had to shake it off,” Wilson said. “Murray played great all game, so we knew that was probably the only one that was going to go in tonight.” \nContact the writer: \nslakso@timesshamrock.com We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.
