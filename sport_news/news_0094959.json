The right-hander had a 1.29 ERA in two starts against the Mets this season, allowing eight hits in 14 innings. Greinke is scheduled to pitch Game 2 on Saturday.\n“We have got to find a way to scratch and claw out runs,” Mets hitting coach Kevin Long said. “They are guys who don’t historically walk people and don’t give up a whole lot of hits. The good thing is we’ve got the same guys on our side.”\nIn Jacob deGrom, Noah Syndergaard and Matt Harvey, the Mets have pitchers with explosive stuff and command, just not the deep résumés.\nThe Dodgers don’t have the Mets’ rotation depth, but the fact they can use Kershaw on short rest if needed for a potential Game 4 before returning Greinke on full rest for a Game 5, makes the task formidable for the NL East champions.\nThe Mets won a game Greinke started at Citi Field on July 26, scoring twice off Grienke and then getting the winning run in the 10th off Juan Nicasio. Earlier in the month at Dodger Stadium, they had won a game Kershaw started when Syndergaard matched Kershaw’s one run allowed and the Mets scored in the ninth off Kenley Jensen.\n“We all know they are two of the best pitchers in the game and the other guys they’ve got following aren’t terrible either,” Michael Cuddyer said.\n“But you’re facing Kershaw and Greinke, it does help to have faced them before. Whether you win or lose, I don’t think that really plays into it, but the fact that you have faced them before, the fact that guys have had at-bats against them, they know the arm angle, they know what the pitches look like, they know the shapes of the pitches, that all helps. As a hitter, the more times you face a guy the more comfortable you feel.”\nLong, who was a regular visitor to the postseason as the Yankees’ hitting coach, said this kind of competition is business as usual in October.\n“It’s the playoffs and in the playoffs you expect to face the best pitchers in baseball,” Long said. “The [Justin] Verlanders, [Anibal] Sanchezes, [Max] Scherzers, I remember facing a very good, talented pitcher every time.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under clayton kershaw ,  kevin long ,  los angeles dodgers ,  michael cuddyer ,  new york mets ,  ruben tejada ,  zack greinke", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T11:39:04.718+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
