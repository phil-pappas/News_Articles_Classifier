But I would say, in retrospect, it's tough to look at 2015 as anything but a tremendous success for the Texas Rangers. It was one of the most enjoyable seasons I've had working here where we came from in 2014 and then even in April in 2015. And I think you look back at the season, there's just so many positives, so many building blocks for the futures. And certainly the ALDS didn't end exactly the way we had hoped, but the reality is there were just so many positives form this season and I think it puts us, heading into the offseason, very optimistic.\"\nOn making three big trading-deadline acquisitions -- Cole Hamels, Jake Diekman and Sam Dyson -- and where this team has to go this winter to complete the roster:\nLevine: \"I think your point is exactly right. When we entered the trade-deadline season in 2015, we were really looking at only making moves that we felt could impact our team in 2016 and beyond. We also had an eye toward the 2015 season just because we didn't view the American League West as a division that was going to get away from us. And we knew we were going to get healthier, and that if we added some of those arms, in addition to the guys coming off the disabled list, we had a chance to really remake our pitching staff as a whole and we thought we could make a late surge. So we did get a lot of our shopping done at the deadline. But I think we still go into the offseason with (Yovani) Gallardo and (Colby) Lewis, two starting pitchers who gave us close to 400 innings combined. That leaves us with a big hole.\n\"We're going to try to be a little bit aggressive on the starting-pitching front. I think if 2014 taught us nothing else, is that you can't be too deep in starting pitching. So we're looking to advantageously add starting pitching, whether it's through the free-agent/trade markets or, quite frankly, just giving guys within opportunities to matriculate to the big leagues. The other thing that I think we saw throughout the course of the second half is just that our team is pretty left handed, and we were exposed, at times, by left-handed pitching. The acquisition of Mike Napoli really helped us out immeasurably and also some of our younger hitters starting to hit left-handed pitching as the second half progressed. But I think that's something that we're aware of this offseason as something that we're probably going to need to balance out the lineup a little bit more with a right-handed presence -- ideally someone who can hit somewhere two through six in the order and balance out our otherwise very left-handed lineup.\"\nOn where the Rangers could wedge a legitimate right-handed hitter into this left-handed lineup:\nLevine: \"I think (corner outfield, 1B/DH or catcher) are the right spots. I think we're very open from an outfield perspective to add one guy there. And then the other spots, catching there's just a lack of true options out there. Although I think Pudge would argue he could still give us a year or two. At the end of the day, we can get creative in the outfield and Delino DeShields did a great job in center field or us. We also are open to having Leonys (Martin) come back and be a lock-down centerfielder and having Delino potentially move to a corner and give us plus defense in the outfield. Now that's not necessarily the right-handed back in which we were speaking -- in fact its adding another left-handed bat -- but I think it's probably most likely going to occur through a creative trade that could open a spot on our existing team and we could then ultimately fill with a right-handed bat.\nOn how he would describe the environment in the Rangers' front office right now:\nLevine: \"JD has us drink 16 ounces of Kool-Aid every morning that he prepares specially for us. I think it all starts with the dynamic between owner, general manager and manager. And I think at this stage in our franchise's development, that relationship could not be better. Our ownership group, to Jon Daniels, to Jeff Banister is really very cohesive, very transparent, very open in communication, and I think that's really at the heart and foundation of every successful franchise in professional sports. But we've worked together for quite some time now. And as a result, we have some terrific chemistry in our front-office group. But I think you can't underestimate the infusion of new voices last year that we had join our group, headlined by Jeff Banister. We also added a number of other coaches to the coaching staff. We've elevated some of our professional scouts to the decision-making table, so as a result we've kind of intermixed that chemistry with a lot of new voices.\n\"So I think, as a front-office group, we really were challenged in a different way this year because we had so many opinions coming to the table. And I think what you saw, as the season progressed, is we started gaining some traction and some chemistry with the new group, such that now we really were clicking on a lot of cylinders. And I think we head into this offseason, feeling extremely comfortable with one another, but also comfortable that we're learning from one another and that we're going to get pushed by the group to really excel. And what we accomplished in 2015 I think was terrific, but I think we're looking to 2016 and beyond as a chance to really open this window again that our fans got to enjoy starting in 2010. Unfortunately it closed a little bit in '14, but our hope and goal is we're hoping we can open up another window where we can enjoy a successful run for years to come.\"\nCan't see the podcast?
