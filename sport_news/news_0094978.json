(Gary Walts | GWalts@Syracuse.com) Comments \nThe magnetic pull of Eric Neilson's personality makes him a player not easily forgotten \nAny Syracuse Crunch fans who make short drives to catch up with the popular ex-enforcer this season will likely experience some more of his legendary good will. \nNeilson signed an ECHL deal with the Manchester Monarchs on Thursday. The Monarchs schedule takes them to both Glens Falls and Elmira this season. \nNeilson promised a warm greeting for any Crunch fans he sees in the stands at those contests. \nEspecially for those who might be wearing his old Syracuse No. 29 sweater. \n\"They can come see me now and then,'' he said Friday while driving to a yoga class in Fredericton, New Brunswick. \"They'll be getting a puck over the glass if I see that, and a big hug after the game.'' \nNeilson always was the gift that keeps giving. He just won't be giving heavyweight bouts to hometown Crunch fans any more like he did for the past three seasons. \nIt was a long summer for Neilson, whose specialty is getting rapidly shoved out of the sport. He said he had talks with teams in both Europe and the AHL, but no offers from either level. \nNeilson said he stayed relaxed by getting ready for the upcoming season and working at his skate sharpening and golf club repair business in Fredericton. Despite the lack of concrete interest, Neilson said he fretted not a bit about perhaps being out of a job. \nWhen Manchester finally came through win an ECHL offer, Neilson's eternal optimism was rewarded. \n\"I wasn't worried,'' he said. \"I just looked at it as, I'm 31. If I get a contract and can play somewhere, great. If not, there's no doors that open, it's time to try something else. There's no point in hanging your head like that. Life's too short. You can't live your life like that. \n\"I would have rather (had) an AHL contract. But given the circumstances, I'm taking it as a positive. It's a pro contract.. \nNeilson's community work makes him a no-brainer hire for a minor league front office someday. He figured that option might have been out there at some point this season, but it's also one that should be available down the road as well. \nThe same won't always be true for his playing career, and considering the ever-tightening market for minor-league free agents that reality could be just a season or two away for Neilson. \n\"Development wise, that (surplus of young players) is really good,'' he said. \"It kind of (stinks) for the old guys. But that's part of the game. That's the business.'' \nContact Lindsay Kramer anytime: Email | Twitter | 315-470-2151", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:41:56.973+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
