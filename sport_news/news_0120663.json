And then I say, ‘What’s going on?’ She says, ‘We better get out of here. They’re going to kill you. They’re bad people. They do nasty things to people.’\n“Then they’re yelling at me, ‘We’re going to kill you.’ …It’s just stuck in my head and I’m trying to deal with it. It’s not an easy thing to deal with.’’\nAllenby says the alleged handicap led him to seek psychiatric help. He said he decided to go not just because of the recurring nightmares, but also because the incident has undermined his game.\n“I can hit the ball absolutely perfect on the driving range,’’ he said. “I can hit every shot I want. I can do everything I need to do.’’\nBut once he’s on the course, everything has unraveled.\nAllenby, who has won four times on the PGA Tour and amassed $27 million in earnings, has missed the cut or withdrawn in 13 of 18 tournaments since January and finished no better than tied for 51st.\n“Mentally, I have so much fear inside me,’’ he said.\nUntil he recently started seeing a psychiatrist, Allenby said, he had confided only in his fiancee. He said they are set to be married Oct. 11 in Napa Valley, Calif.\n“So there is something amazing at the end of such tragedy,’’ he said.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T20:36:00.279+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
