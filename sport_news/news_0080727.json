Nadolny equalized after a South Shore Christian goal in the 23rd minute, scoring an individual effort goal. Bass got her first, off an assist from Sarah Walman, to knot the game at 2-all just before the break, five minutes after the Warriors earned a 2-1 lead. Sturgis West (5-3-2) found its scoring touch in the second half, netting four goals after the break to pull away. Nadolny, off a Sinead Dolan assist, and Bass, off Nadolny’s assist, upped the Navigators lead to 4-2. Belle Lower then added a blast from 25 yards out and Claire Mely added a breakaway tally with 21 seconds to play to ice the game. Nikki Gardner was strong in goal for Sturgis West. Mashpee 1, Falmouth Academy 0: Freshman Emily Franks’ goal midway through the second half, along with strong defensive play from the Falcons, led Mashpee over the Mariners in Falmouth. Franks knocked home a ball from Emma McNally for the game’s lone goal. Mashpee (4-4-2) held the edge in opportunities, only sneaking one past Falmouth Academy goalie Charlotte Van Voorhis. McNally was key in the midfield for the Falcons while goalie Amanda Soroka earned her sixth shutout of the season. Jane Earley and Coralee Larue were key defensively for Falmouth Academy (5-2-1). Bourne 3, Wareham 0: Madelyn Leach scored two goals and Molly Neil earned her second shutout in a win for the Canalmen over the Vikings in Wareham. Leach, off a Tess McCabe pass, gave Bourne (3-7) a 1-0 lead just before the half. The Canalmen fired off close to 20 shots in the opening half, but didn’t break it open until 15 minutes after the break, with Leach netting her second off another McCabe assist. Rhyan Ullo finished scoring for Bourne, off an assist from Megan Ladner, in the 62nd minute and Neil made it stand. Nauset 6, Dennis-Yarmouth 1: Emily McGrath scored once and had two assists to lead the Warriors over the Dolphins in South Yarmouth.

DiBona tied things at 1-all with 7:30 to play on a direct kick from roughly 18 yards out of the Monomoy goal. DiBona repeated the feet nearly six minutes later for the game winner, improving Upper Cape to 5-6-1. Tara Barry got Monomoy (1-7) going with a late first half goal. Danielle Mueller notched 15 stops in the win for the Rams and got strong defensive support from Alexis Desrosiers. Marshfield 3, Falmouth 0: The Clippers played the Rams to a scoreless tie in Falmouth but Marshfield found the back of the net in the second half en route to a win. Senior Caroline Raposo made a pair of “incredible” saves, according to coach Greg Gilbert, in the opening half. Junior Savannah Jensen aided Raposo defensively with strong play at sweeper, her first game back since suffering a concussion during a game two weeks ago. Freshman Victoria Roulston and senior captain Rachel Gilbert were key up front for Falmouth (5-5, 2-3 Atlantic Coast League) while sophomore Chloe McLean and sophomore Olivia Ferraro were strong in the midfield.
