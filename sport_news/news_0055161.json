We’ll move on from this and it’s likely that we’ll see them again down the road at state.” \nTrinity (28-4, 4-2) won the first set 25-23 before Oak Mountain (24-3, 10-0) responded for consecutive 25-12, 25-23 and 25-17 deci- sions to clinch this year’s region title. \nThe Lady Lions have region matches left on Monday at Weber School and Thursday at home against Dominion Christian where the team will honor junior Cheyenne Hayes for posting the 1,000th kill of her career. \nHayes added 14 more kills and seniors Katie Jones and Chasey Mitchell added six and four, respectively against Oak Moun- tain. Among Trinity’s 32 digs, Hayes had 10 while Jones and Senior Kelsey Richards added eight and six, respectively. \nSeniors Regan Lohlein, Libby Rogers and Mitchell each had a team-high two blocks and Lohlein finished with 28 assists from her setter position.
