His shooting percentage plummeted as the top scoring threat off the bench. Part was shot selection, part was Burke being left with the ball in his hands late in the shot clock. \nGoing into his third year, many expect the ninth player taken in the 2013 draft to come into his own soon. \n“It’s just a matter of getting better every day,” said Burke, who acknowledged there’s more responsibility with the roster as is. “By nature I’m a scorer, but I think the game’s opening up so much for me that I’m realizing I can get others involved and just let the game come to me. \n“I’m going to get shots throughout the game. Guys finding me, me coming off the screen, transition. But I think the more I’m able to get in the paint, find other guys for open shots, the easier it makes my job.” \nNeto’s minutes as the third guard were likely to be limited at best beforehand. No Exum and no fourth point guard shows the trust the Brazilian rookie has gained in a short time. \nNeto said he’s been prepared for whatever role and however many minutes are sent his way. He brings a different dynamic than Burke as a pass-first point guard who needs to continue to work on his jump shot. \nCoach Quin Snyder even started Neto in the final preseason game Thursday. \n“The thing I like is they play defense,” Snyder said. “From that position, if we defend, they’re going to improve. Trey’s playing the position different than he played it his first year, that’s because our team is different. He’s being asked to do certain things as our team evolves. We feel like both those guys are making progress. And we’ve got some other guys that handle the ball. They’re obviously not point guards, but we can figure it out.” \nThose other guys are the wings. \nSnyder has experimented with a variety of lineups during preseason - most notably rotations without a point guard on the floor. That leaves Gordon Hayward, Alec Burks and Rodney Hood initiating a lot of offense. Hayward has done plenty of that in the past and Hood showed that ability late last season. Burks has always been a playmaker with the ball in his hands. \nThe Golden State Warriors garnered a lot of attention last season with positionless-type rotations en route to a NBA championship. \nThe Jazz aren’t as extreme, but they have the capability to roll out bigger lineups with Rudy Gobert and Derrick Favors on the floor without a point guard. They can also go small with Favors at the five and Hayward at the four. \nRookie Trey Lyles is a long 6-foot-10 who can play multiple positions and general manager Dennis Lindsey added two more 7-footers in Jeff Withey and Tibor Pleiss during the offseason.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:45:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:29:36.272+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
