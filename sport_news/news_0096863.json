Investigators said the victim, identified only as a 14-year-old female, was raped on multiple occasions over the course of a year.\nAttempts to locate Clifton have been unsuccessful. The sheriff said his only known address, which is where the crimes occurred, was on East Claiborne Parkway.\n“Investigators have been unable to determine whether or not Clifton owns a vehicle, nor where he is currently residing. Clifton was last seen fleeing the residence on East Claiborne around 6:30 am this morning. Clifton held a knife to himself and stated that he would commit suicide if law enforcement were notified,” the sheriff said in a news release.\nAnyone with information is asked to call the Sheriff’s Office or Crimestoppers at (504) 822-1111.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
