After an evenly matched first period, Nantucket found the back of the net early in the second. Less than two minutes later, Quirino DoCanto tied the game with a goal for the Gladiators, assisted by Ty Lovendale and Bethany Davis. \nDespite stellar goaltending by Zachary Pateakos, Gateway struggled to kill 15 minutes in penalties. Nantucket took advantage, scoring three more goals as the Gladiators simply couldnâ€™t keep their legs fresh. The non-conference loss marks the first defeat of the season for the Gateway Bantam team.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:56:27.962+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
