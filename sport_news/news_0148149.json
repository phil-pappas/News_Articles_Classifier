Mike Carter-USA TODAY Sports (Photo: Mike Carter-USA TODAY Sports) \nEAST LANSING – It’s not Ron Burton’s area of expertise or concern, but he did say Wednesday that Rutgers wanted to throw the ball deep to Leonte Carroo last year and that “we should expect that if he is in the game.” \nCarroo was reinstated to the team Wednesday after having a simple assault charge under domestic violence dropped Tuesday. Carroo, suspended for the past two games, is an NFL prospect and the program’s all-time leader in touchdown catches (22), though MSU did hold him to one catch for 6 yards in last season’s 45-3 home win over Rutgers. \nOf more pressing concern to Burton, MSU’s defensive line coach, is getting his group to return to “A” level play when the No. 4 Spartans (5-0, 1-0 Big Ten) travel to face the Scarlet Knights (2-2, 0-1). Though Burton didn’t agree Saturday’s 24-21 win over Purdue was a “down game” for the defensive line, it was not as dominant as usual in a game that saw the Boilermakers run for 165 yards. \n“I think we didn’t play as well as we wanted to, but that’s the game of football,” MSU senior defensive end Shilique Calhoun said. “There’s always gonna be ups and downs.” \nBurton said MSU’s defensive line graded “80% as a group,” a “B” grade in a season he said has included multiple “A” grades for the unit. \nSenior defensive end Lawrence Thomas didn’t get to his correct gap on a 68-yard touchdown run for Purdue’s Markell Jones and “he needed to get there,” Burton said. \n“We will do better next time,” Burton said, “that’s for sure.” \nAlong with a deep threat in Carroo and a quarterback in Chris Laviano completing 72% of his passes, Rutgers has three backs with nearly 800 yards between them and the Big Ten’s No. 4 rushing offense with 211 yards per game. \n“They do a tremendous job with it,” Burton said. “It starts with their captain, (Paul James), up front. But they have two backs behind him that are pretty good with (Josh) Hicks and (Robert Martin). They do a tremendous job. I think them being able to keep backs fresh as they do has been a plus for them. Very active, can break some big ones and they do a good job in executing their game plan.” \nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @joerexrode .
