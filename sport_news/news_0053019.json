Speaking after his side’s 4-0 home win over Luxembourg on Friday, which saw defending champions Spain assure a 2016 Euro berth when he will be 66 years old, Del Bosque avoided questions over whether or not he would sign a new contract, reports Xinhua. “This is not the time to talk about whether I’ll continue. There’s a long way to go before the Euros and I have time to think it through,” he said on Saturday. Del Bosque took over as Spain coach in 2008 and his eight years in charge saw them win the 2010 World Cup, as well as retain the European Championship in 2012. Now they travel to France after winning eight of their nine qualifying matches. “We have won a lot of points but it hasn’t been easy. The defeat to Slovakia (in the opening qualifying game) complicated things for us. We’ve had our difficulties along the way,” he said. Spain controlled Friday night’s game, but only sealed the win in the closing minutes. “All we need is for our forwards to start scoring on a regular basis, for them to connect and feel comfortable,” Del Bosque commented, adding that his team was “complete.” Related Posts", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T16:49:05.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
