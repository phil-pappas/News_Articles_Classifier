It said the ban was \"proportionate in so far as it takes into account the nature and gravity of the criminal offense.\"\nBritain is currently debating its position within the European Union and has been extremely sensitive to any move than could undermine national decision-making on vital issues. Britain does not allow prisoners to vote.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
