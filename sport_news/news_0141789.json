He has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder, armed robbery and two counts of rape.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below Defense attorney Denise Regan asked prospective jurors whether, if they find that Chism did commit the crimes he’s accused of, they could “keep an open mind about a lack of criminal responsibility.”\n“If you found he committed these offenses, and found he was not sane, would you have trouble returning a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity?” she asked.\nRegan also asked whether the “interracial aspect” of the crime – Chism is black and Ritzer was white—would have any impact on jurors.\nEssex County Assistant District Attorney Kate MacDougall asked whether Chism’s age at the time of the crime would have any affect on them. He is now 16.\nThere are 45 prospective jurors under questioning today. Eighteen jurors will be selected, with two dismissed, for an eventual panel of 16 for the projected four-week trial.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T20:05:40.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
