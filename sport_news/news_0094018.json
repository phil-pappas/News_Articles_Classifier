Jim Tomsula said that big changes were in store after his 49ers were embarrassed at home Thursday night by the Seattle Seahawks 20-3. Many thought that might mean a change at quarterback, but Tomsula says that will not be happening.\nAdChoices “Colin’s our quarterback. No controversies,” Tomsula told the media Friday via The Sacramento Bee’s Matt Barrows.\nTomsula also said the changes will not involve his coaching staff.\nSo what are the 2-5 49ers planning to change? They’re going to look at their scheme and personnel, according to Barrows. Some changes they’ve made include fewer blitzes from the defense and having Kaepernick take more snaps from under center instead of shotgun.\nWhatever Tomsula seems to do doesn’t really improve the team.\nThough they fought the Giants in a close one two weeks ago and beat the Ravens last week, Thursday was a disaster. Kaepernick went 13/24 for a paltry 124 yards, while the team rushed for just 61 yards. It was a pathetic effort that saw them punt nine times.\nWhy would Tomsula be hesitant to make a quarterback change after that? For starters, Kaepernick has historically struggled against Seattle’s defense, regardless of the Niners’ personnel or scheme. Two, he showed great improvement in Weeks 5 and 6 when he threw for four touchdowns and no interceptions while boasting his highest passing averages of the season. Lastly, their backup option is Blaine Gabbert, who most agree is not very good.\nTomsula may be insisting that his team will fix its problems, but I don’t see that happening. They have four tough games ahead that they will probably lose, resulting in them being 2-9. I think they’re headed for a 4-12 season — 5-11 in a good scenario. Sorry, 49ers fans, but your team just isn’t very good, and the front office made a huge mistake letting Jim Harbaugh go in favor of Tomsula.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.yardbarker.com/", "http://www.sacbee.com/sports/nfl/san-francisco-49ers/article41205699.html", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:24:54.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
