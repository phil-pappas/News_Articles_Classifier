(AP Photo/Joel Auerbach) more > By STEVEN WINE - Associated Press   \nDAVIE, Fla. (AP) - Dan Campbell needed only two weeks to get the Miami Dolphins out of last place. \nReaching first place will take a lot longer, but a win Thursday at New England would be a big step in that direction. \nThe Dolphins (3-3) have saved their season with back-to-back blowout wins since interim coach Campbell replaced Joe Philbin, raising the stakes for Thursday’s game at AFC East leader New England (6-0). \nWith only three days between games, it’s a quick turnaround for a team staging a quick turnaround. \n“We really need this win,” Campbell said. “We’re capable of beating this team. They’re not going to be easy. They never are. You’ve got Tom Brady, you’ve got the great Bill Belichick.” \nPhilbin went 0-3 in Foxborough, losing by a combined score of 96-30. But the Dolphins have been different under Campbell, who said he took over a team of sleeping giants and promptly roused them. \nMiami built a 41-0 lead Sunday and went on to beat Houston 44-26. A week earlier, in Campbell’s debut as a head coach, the Dolphins won at Tennessee, 38-10. \n“The Dolphins have played great the last two weeks in all areas of the game,” Belichick said Monday. “They’ve got plays coming from everywhere.” \nBuried two weeks ago, Miami is now back in the playoff mix. Only five AFC teams have a better record. \nIt’s heady stuff for a franchise that hasn’t been to the postseason since 2008, and hasn’t won a playoff game since 2000. The resurgence had fans Sunday chanting “Dan! Dan!” \n“I thought that Marino had walked out,” Campbell joked. \nThe Dolphins began the season with playoff hopes, and the past two weeks suggest they sorely underachieved under Philbin. Now that they’re winning, can they keep it up? \nAn upset victory at New England would represent a breakthrough in more ways than one. There have been 21 other interim coaches in the NFL since 2001, and none won his first three games, according to STATS. \nThe Dolphins believe Campbell is the man for the job. \n“With the changes that happened, we honestly feel like it was a new season,” linebacker Kelvin Sheppard said. “That’s from the top down. That’s what our head man stands before us and says. We’ve all bought into that, and that’s we truly what we believe.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T20:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:29:37.826+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
