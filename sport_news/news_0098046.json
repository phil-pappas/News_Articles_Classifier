Cutler practiced Thursday on a limited basis for the second consecutive day after sitting out last week's 26-0 loss at Seattle because of a pulled hamstring. He responded \"we'll see\" when asked if he will play against the Raiders. Cutler was injured trying to tackle Arizona's Tony Jefferson on a 26-yard interception return for a touchdown in the first half of a 48-23 loss at Soldier Field on Sept. 20. Clausen struggled in last week's 26-0 loss at Seattle -- the first shutout against Chicago since 2002.
