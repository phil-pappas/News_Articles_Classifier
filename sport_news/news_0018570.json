He'll enroll at Utah in January.\nMore Coverage Morning links: Utah Utes football edition “ I think kind of in our hearts we always knew (it was Utah).”\nJay Johnson\nUniversity of Utah head men's basketball coach Larry Krystkowiak has said that he and his coaching staff are in the position to win major recruiting battles thanks to the Runnin' Utes ' recent success.\nThey won one Monday, as 7-foot center Jayce Johnson of Santa Monica, California, widely considered one of the Top 100 prospects in the nation, committed to Utah.\nScout.com's Josh Gershon was the first to report the news.\nRanked as the 59th-best prospect in the 2016 class by Scout, 67th by Rivals and 81st by ESPN, Johnson chose the Runnin' Utes over the Cal Golden Bears and the Colorado Buffaloes.\n“I think kind of in our hearts we always knew (it was Utah),\" Johnson's dad Jay told the Deseret News by phone on Tuesday. \"We’ve been talking to Larry and (associate head coach) Tommy (Connor) since April of 2014 when Tommy first reached out to Jayce.”\nIn recent days, reports surfaced that Johnson will actually reclassify to 2015. Many thought that meant Johnson was set on going to Cal, as it was the only one of Johnson's final three schools to have a scholarship available for 2015.\nInstead, Johnson will graduate in December, and his family will pay his way at Utah before his scholarship kicks in next fall, Jay Johnson confirmed.\n“I think he was sitting there thinking, ‘Do I go back to high school for a year and play that game and work out and try to get better, or do I go to the program where I want to be and spend six months making myself better than all the incoming freshmen?,’” Jay Johnson said.\nJohnson's commitment came two days after Krystkowiak got a commitment from guard Jojo Zamora of Yuba College.\nThe Runnin' Utes are also still in the race for Lauri Markkanen, a big man from Finland, who is also considering Arizona and North Carolina. He visited Salt Lake City last weekend, along with Johnson and Zamora.\nRyan McDonald is a sports reporter at DeseretNews.com .
