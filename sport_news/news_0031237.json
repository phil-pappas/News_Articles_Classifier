First of all, we don’t need to grill the candidates, we need to grill our elected officials, including our president. They are the ones that are at fault. Second, guns are not violent, people are violent. President Obama was quick to push for gun control. He said nothing about people control.\nThe reason our society has become ever more violent is a result of our liberal, permissive society. This falls squarely on the shoulders of Obama and Democrats. We are now reaping what their policies have sewn.\nWhen I went to school our civics class taught good citizenship and respect for your neighbor and law enforcement. That has been declared all bunk by the liberals. Today, all we get is ethnic studies and taught that anything you want to do is OK without punishment. Accountability is a dirty word. If you fail a class, you are socially promoted. If you tell your teacher to “F-off” the teacher is fired for objecting and you are forgiven.\nThis is why we have so many crazy people today. They have been taught that it is OK to be crazy. So don’t blame guns. We need guns to protect ourselves from them. Blame our leaders that have created this madness with their insane policies.\nThe most important thing that should be taught in school today is the golden rule. “Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” I was taught that in school, it has been the center piece of my life.\nThere is no way to completely eliminate violence in our society. But if we really want to stem it, we need to return to teaching our children love and respect for our fellow human beings, government officials and law enforcement.\nHowever, government officials must first earn that respect. They could do that by emphasizing the golden rule in our schools.\nH.G. Chaffin\nCorona\nWRITE A LETTER TO THE EDITOR: Letters to the Editor: E-mail to letters@pe.com .
