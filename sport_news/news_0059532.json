What a difference a change in season can bring.\nDuring the winter, Charles Richardson might prefer not to see Ben Chobhaphand , whose basketball team at Forest Hills HS has gone 6-0 against Richardson's Flushing squad over the past three seasons.\nBut, come springtime, the rivalry thaws. When basketball season wraps up, Chobhaphand and Richardson join forces to coach Flushing 's baseball team.\nThis is the third season that Richardson is heading up the Red Devils baseball program with Chobhaphand's assistance.\n\"(Forest Hills basketball team) lost in the playoffs and days later we started baseball,\" Chobhaphand said. \"I had to get over (losing to Curtis in the second round). ...But our relationship is easy. We work well together.\"\nThe players agree.\n\"They tell you when you're wrong, and that's how they make players better,\" said senior Billy Marte Veras, who pitches for the Red Devils.\nWhen Chobhaphand began teaching Phys. Ed at Flushing in 2003, he also worked as a basketball assistant at Forest Hills. A year later, he became the Rangers head coach. In 2007, he accepted the head baseball coaching position at Flushing.\nRichardson was coaching girls handball at the time, but in 2008 he took over the baseball program and retained Chobhaphand as his assistant.\nAlthough the two coaches are focused on the diamond, their minds occasionally drift onto the court.\n\"Sometimes you slip up and say buckets instead of runs,\" Richardson said, laughing. \"The mindset is different, anyway. Basketball is such a fast sport; baseball is a thinking man's game, if anything. You have to change persona so to speak.\n\"In basketball, it's 'Let's go, let's go, we got to push it,'\" he added. \"Sometimes in baseball, you got to tell them to slow down, relax and focus.\"\nThe Red Devils had better be focused: this week, they'll begin their final push to be one of three teams to reach the playoffs in the heated Queens 'B' North.\nFlushing (7-4) began the week in third place, trailing Queens Vocational (9-3), HS for Construction (8-4) and a half game ahead of Bowne (7-5). The Frank Sinatra School of the Arts (6-3) is also trying to earn a spot.\n\"The teams that make it can all be a threat,\" said Construction coach Marcus Ortiz .\nThe Red Devils hurt their chances on Wednesday, when they lost to Construction, 5-4, but they rebounded with a 9-7 win over Hillcrest on Friday.\nThey're scheduled to play a home-and-home series against last-place Academy of American Studies (2-10) today and Thursday, and end their season next week with a home-and-home set against Frank Sinatra .\n\"We expect to win,\" Veras said. \"We're working hard to make the playoffs.\"\nAs Veras said, the Red Devils know it's time to put up or flush the season goodbye.\n\"Every game is like a playoff game,\" Richardson said. \"If you lose, it sets you back. If you win, it brings you one step closer to what we want to do. We want to make the playoffs. We want to go for a championship. We're not playing just to play ... we want to win.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:45:40.433+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
