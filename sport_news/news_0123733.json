Ramos-Vinolas then broke Federer in the eighth game of the third set with a forehand winner down the line and held the next game to close it out. \nThe last time Federer and Ramos-Vinolas played, at Wimbledon in 2012, the Spaniard won only three games. Ramos-Vinolas also came into the match with a 0-15 record against top-10 players. \n“I’m always cautious,” Federer said. “I don’t underestimate or lack respect for anybody out there. These guys are all touring professionals, they know what they’re doing.” \nIt was the second straight year Federer was tested in his opening match at the tournament. Last year, he saved five match points before edging Leonardo Mayer of Argentina and going on to win the title. \n“I just think the first round here in Shanghai has always been historically quite difficult, getting used to the conditions and the surface and the balls,” Federer said. “Last year I got lucky. This year I didn’t. So it’s a pity.” \nFederer hasn’t played since helping Switzerland win a Davis Cup match the week after losing to Novak Djokovic in the U.S. Open final. \nIn other matches, former U.S. Open champion Marin Cilic defeated Borna Coric 6-1, 6-2, a day after saving a match point to win his first-round match. \nAlso, ninth-seeded Milos Raonic of Canada beat Thomaz Bellucci of Brazil 7-6 (5), 7-6 (2); No. 10 Gilles Simon of France beat Georgian qualifier Nikoloz Basilashvili 6-3, 4-6, 6-0; No. 11 Richard Gasquet defeated Gilles Muller of Luxembourg 7-6 (4), 6-2; and No. 12 Kevin Anderson of South Africa eliminated 37-year-old Tommy Haas of Germany 6-3, 7-5. \nHaas, a former second-ranked player, has won only two matches in eight tournaments since returning from arthroscopic surgery on his right shoulder earlier this year.
