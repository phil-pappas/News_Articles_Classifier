(AP) - Under scrutiny by the state Department of Education for the past two years, the Greenwood School District has now been put on probation for failing to meet some accreditation standards.\nThe Greenwood Commonwealth reports ( http://bit.ly/1PuLn2Q ) the state took the action last week after an audit by the Mississippi Office of Accreditation found the district failed to comply with state regulations.\nDuring the next two months, the district must develop a plan to address deficiencies. The plan must include a timeline for specific improvement measures. If the district fails to adhere to that timeline, its accreditation could be withdrawn.\nIn 2014, the district's accreditation status was downgraded to \"pending\" and it faced a possible state takeover before satisfying state officials and having its accreditation restored.\nInformation from: The Greenwood Commonwealth, http://www.gwcommonwealth.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
