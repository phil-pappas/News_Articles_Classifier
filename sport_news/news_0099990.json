Wonder if Andrew Luck ever did that? Or Peyton Manning? \nBut that can happen when a guy has just turned 40, and his career is at twilight, and he had not been sure if he would ever get a chance like this again, or hear these cheers. \n``Ironically, my family wasn't here today’’ Matt Hasselbeck was saying after he seized the day on Sunday, having come out of the Indianapolis bullpen to replace an injured Luck. ``My girls had a lacrosse game in Connecticut. So they're a little mad at me, but I promised them I'd tape it and we could watch it. It was really special.’’ \nLet’s pause for the big picture. It was a 16-13 overtime win over Jacksonville. Neither pretty nor particularly impressive, though it certainly beat the alternative. A home loss to the Jaguars and a 1-3 record would have had the smoke alarms going off in Lucas Oil Stadium. This was finding a way, like a No. 3 seed surviving and advancing in the NCAA Tournament. \n``It’s hard to win a game in the NFL,’’ tackle Joe Reitz said. \nYeah, we've noticed. Especially lately. They escaped with 282 passing yards from a 40-year old quarterback who hadn’t started a game in three years, and the game-winning field goal from a 42-year old kicker. It was AARP Sunday at Lucas Oil. \nSo nothing is easy right now for these Colts, and maybe never will be. They are not dominating the AFC South as much as eking by. They needed the Jaguars to miss two potential winning field goals Sunday. Plus, Luck is hurt, a bum shoulder forcing an end to 57 consecutive starts in the NFL. \nSo the question stands: What happens when the beefy opponents start popping up soon? When it’s New England and Denver? \nFor now, here are a few things we should know about Hasselbeck. \nHe has been named to as many Pro Bowls as Luck — three — and played in one more Super Bowl, all with Seattle. \nHe was once struck by lightning. \nHe has a wit. For his bio in the Colts media guide, he was asked the one thing he could not live without. His answer: ``A balance between nitrogen and oxygen.” \nWhen he was drafted in 1998 — 186 spots behind the Colts taking Manning — Luck was 8 years old. \nOn Sunday, he wasn’t even sure he was starting until he came back in the locker room from a pregame jog. \n``Andrew kind of in his own way gave me the confirmation,’’ he said. \nWhich was? \n``He was wearing workout clothes and not pants with pads in them.’’ \nSo Hasselbeck had a job to do, that he hadn’t done since his Tennessee days in 2012. \n``I got way too excited coming out of the tunnel. I couldn’t hit Frank Gore to save my life on two of the easiest Pop Warner passes you could ever have,\" he said. ``I already know the lesson. Chill out, you’re a quarterback.’’ \nHe’s also 40. He wasn’t throwing deep lasers out there. He was so exhausted at the end, he didn’t even think he watched Adam Vinatieri’s winning kick. But he passed 47 times, and none of them were intercepted. He led. He won. And suddenly, he was a kid again. \n``It was fun to watch him,’’ Vinatieri mentioned, one game-winning geezer commenting on another. \n``He’s played 18 years and seen every defense and been through every ringer,’’ Reitz said. ``He prepares and he comes to work every day. Just a true pro.’’ \nHasselbeck was sure he’d get text messages from retired former teammates who now spend Sundays in their La-Z-Boys. \n``That really brightens my day, just hearing from those guys and how fired up they get from the fact that one of us is still going,’’ he said. \nWhen Hasselbeck started his career, there was no such thing as text messaging, or the Colts winning division titles. Now they do, by plugging away, just like he did Sunday. \n``I’m not a huge fan of coaching clichés. I don’t think many players are,’’ he said. ``But our thing, our motto, our identity — one play at a time, all you got, 60 minutes, don’t judge — is legit. It works and it wins.’’ \nThe Colts yearn for a healthy Luck, starting Thursday night in Houston. But Hasselbeck will always have Sunday, and never mind the style points. \n``I don’t care how you get it, you get a win in this league, we’ll take it,’’ Robert Mathis said. \nStill, they have to get better, and quickly. No matter who’s playing quarterback.  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:25:57.190+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
