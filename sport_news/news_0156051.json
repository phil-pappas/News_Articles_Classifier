You just want to see the growth and maturity.” \nThomas plans to try out different combinations on the court to see what the chemistry is like. He will also reward players who worked hard in the off-season and in training camp and are picking up on what he’s preaching with more court time. \nThe Bobcats are also inviting past players and supporters of the program to come to the inaugural Alumni, Family and Friends celebration, which will take place immediately after Saturday’s game. It will have a meet and greet with the players, a live band, hot appetizers and door prizes. Tickets cost $30. \n“It’s a celebration of the past, present and future,” Thomas said. “We want to engage the alumni and keep them involved in BU women’s basketball. We want them to invite their friends and families. I’m big on positive experiences for the players. \n“The future extends to Junior Bobcats and the Bobcats Academy. Hopefully they’ll attend because it’s all under the same umbrella. The future of our program depends on the Junior Bobcats and the Academy. I think we all benefit when we have the youth in the region.” \nMeanwhile, the men’s volleyball team is in Regina today for a tournament. The Bobcats take on the MacEwan University Griffins today and the Cougars and Bisons on Saturday. \nThe women’s volleyball team is at the University of Winnipeg for the Unruh Realty Invitational. The Bobcats play the host Wesmen and the University of Toronto Varsity Blues today and the Bisons tomorrow. \nThe men’s basketball team begins its pre-season next Thursday when it hosts the Brock University Badgers. \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:25:39.375+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
