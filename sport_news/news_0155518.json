(Photo: John T. Greilick, Detroit News) \nCONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Angelique S. Chengelis, Matt Charboneau, Bob Wojnowski and John Niyo predict the outcome of Saturday's Michigan-Maryland game.\nAngelique S. Chengelis: \nMichigan and Maryland has the makings of a slop-fest. At the very least, it will be a run-the-ball fest if the rain and wind are as challenging as predicted because of Hurricane Joaquin. Michigan 21-3 \nMatt Charboneau: The Wolverines are coming off an impressive victory over BYU and will need to guard against a letdown, but Maryland offers very little to be concerned about. Maryland is fresh off a beat-down at the hands of West Virginia. It won’t be long into this one before Michigan has next week’s matchup with Northwestern on its mind. Michigan 35-17 \nBob Wojnowski: Maryland is a sloppy mess, and we’re not just talking about the treacherous weather. QB Caleb Rowe has nine INTs his last three games, which should tantalize Michigan’s stellar secondary. The Wolverines have been a horrible road team for a while, so this is a chance to see if Jim Harbaugh’s run-oriented, defense-dominated style travels well. Michigan 34-13 \nJohn Niyo : A monsoon might not be such bad news for Maryland, because the Terrapins can’t throw the ball, anyway. But if they can’t stop the run — and they haven’t the last three weeks — Michigan won’t have to throw, either.
