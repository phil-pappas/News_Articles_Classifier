Shower or two. Sport Cowboys to receive a specially crafted key to the city of Cairns by: What are these? HAND-CRAFTED: Metalwork craftsman Gus Petersen of Elefantus Iron Works with the 4.5kg, 75cm recycled steel Key to the City of Cairns, which will be presented to the North Queensland Cowboys by Mayor Bob Manning at a special public reception on Sunday. PICTURE: MARC MCCORMACK Source: News Limited \nTHE city of Cairns will present the victorious North Queensland Cowboys with a symbol of the team’s steely determination when they arrive at a fan day this Sunday . \nMayor Bob Manning will present the Key to the City to co-captains Johnathan Thurston and Matt Scott. \n“The Cowboys have proven themselves to be the premier team in the NRL,” Mr Manning said. \n“We thought it was appropriate to enshrine this achievement in local history by awarding the club the Key to the City. But it won’t be just any key.” \nHot metal worker Gus Petersen from Elefantus has used his 25 years of experience to forge one of the most important jobs of his career. \nThe 75cm key, forged from recycled steel, weighs 4.5kg and will be mounted on a block of varnished kwila timber. \nWhile the act of presenting a “key to the city” is purely symbolic in the modern age, the practice evokes medieval walled cities, the gates of which would be guarded during the day and locked at night. \nThe key symbolised the freedom of the recipient to enter and leave the city at will as a trusted friend of the city.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:10:11.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
