So far this year, a 37-year wait for a Triple Crown in horse racing and a 16-year wait for a World Cup for the U.S. women’s national soccer team both gloriously ended. Jordan Spieth had us all going for a while for an unprecedented Grand Slam in golf, while Serena Williams nearly became the first player in 27 years to win the Grand Slam in tennis. \nIt was impressive and it was fun, all of it. But none of it, by itself or even added together, comes close to matching what generations of us have gone through watching, following and suffering with the Cubs for the past 107 years. \nThe last time they won the World Series, it was 1908. The last time they were even in the World Series was 1945. \nSo who among us won’t be watching when the Cubs play either the New York Mets or the Los Angeles Dodgers for the National League pennant starting Saturday? \nA lot of us, actually. Cubs KO Cardinals, advance to NLCS with Wrigley party \nTake Monday night. The Cubs played a game for the ages, hitting a postseason record six home runs at 101-year-old Wrigley Field to defeat arch rival St. Louis 8-6 and take a 2-1 lead in a series they won the next day. \nOne would have imagined the TV ratings would have gone through the roof. \nThey did nothing of the sort. \nThe game, which began at 6 p.m. ET but didn’t end until 9:30, well into prime time, received a 3.5 rating on TBS. Up against this classic was a midseason NFL game between two teams with 2-2 records at the time, Pittsburgh and San Diego. \nThe NFL game drew a 7.7 rating on ESPN. \nIt’s true. The Cubs at their historic best were pounded in the ratings by run-of-the-mill pro football. (They were more popular than the game that followed between the Mets and Dodgers, who despite coming from the only metropolitan areas in the country bigger than Chicago, received just a 2.4 rating against the last half of the NFL game.) \nChicago Cubs fans including Joe Downs (right) celebrate outside of Wrigley Field after game four of the NLDS against the St. Louis Cardinals. (Photo: Jerry Lai-USA TODAY Sports) \nEvery time playoff baseball clashes with the regular-season NFL and loses, we’re surprised, but we shouldn’t be. ESPN is a comfortable old shoe compared with the scavenger hunt that’s necessary to find the Turner stations that show sports. Monday Night Football is a part of our viewing culture the way no other sporting event ever has been. And it’s the NFL, for heaven’s sake. The more controversy there is, the better it does with the public. \nBut this was the Cubs! And it was important! \nI got a little excited there because the Cubs and I go back a long way. My father grew up on the South Side of Chicago but cheered for the North Side Cubs because his father never forgave Shoeless Joe Jackson and the White Sox for throwing the 1919 World Series. \nAs a young girl, I decided to cheer for the Cubs too. I made this decision early in the 1969 season. In hindsight, that was not the best year to start rooting for this team. \nWhen I went to camp in Michigan for a week that June, my dad folded up the local sports section and sent it to me in the mail each day so I could keep up with the Cubs, who were in first place by six games in the NL East at the time. By September, they were falling apart. When the season was over, they had finished eight games behind the Miracle Mets. \nIt was the first time I had ever followed the excruciating demise of a sports team over the course of a season. I’ve seen just about everything in sports since, but I’ve never forgotten that. \nSo bring on the Dodgers in the NLCS, or better yet, the Mets. It doesn't matter to me that we’re in the middle of America’s football season. I’ll be watching. 5 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/1LvqHoQ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:59:45.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
