Boras, who openly accused the ball club of knowingly putting Harvey's health and potentially lucrative career in \"peril,\" placed a wedge between the star pitcher and the other 24 players in the dugout. Then, when initially given the forum to throw sand on the road and regain traction, Harvey instead sprayed it with water. \nHarvey was vague, even non-committal about his role moving forward in terms of his availability to pitch during the closing weeks of the season – or the postseason – in light of the somewhat arbitrary innings limitations placed on a pitcher who was completing his first full season after reconstructive surgery on his pitching elbow. All year long, Harvey had acted the role of super hero, much like his persona \"The Dark Knight\" that he's so embraced as a brand in the nation's largest media market. He spoke openly about wanting the ball, wanting to pitch, being there for his teammates, being the ace of the staff, especially when it matters most – in October. \nWell, that's what lies ahead for Harvey and the New York Mets. By virtue of a spectacular final two months of the season, the Mets caught, passed and put away the heavily-favored Washington Nationals to win the division with more than a week to go and were cruising towards their NL Division Series opener in Los Angeles against the Dodgers. \nThen Matt Harvey missed a mandatory team workout. He wasn't a little late to the two-hour session. He showed up when it was ending. Baseball workouts in October are not physically demanding. Players aren't scrimmaging, running gassers or going offense vs defense in helmets and shoulder pads. The sport doesn't work that way. Anything strenuous in terms of weight training or running or extra work is done individually. But, it was mandatory for Harvey to be there and on the field, in Queens, by noon. \nDepending on which story you choose to believe, the former UNC star was either stuck in tunnel traffic at 11:45 a.m. or \"doing stuff\" before he realized it was 1 in the afternoon. Both of those excuses – sorry, explanations – have been offered as reasons for the absence. Not by him, of course, because at his media briefing yesterday, while he was taking full responsibility for screwing up, he was – again – not willing to explain why he disrespected manager Terry Collins, the organization and his 24 teammates, who all understood the meaning of the word \"mandatory.\" \nKeep in mind, Harvey will still get the ball for Game 3 of this series, because, as Collins noted yesterday through clenched teeth, this isn't high school where you miss the first quarter of a game. Harvey will be fined by the team for his absence and take the ball Monday night at Citi Field. \nOf course, there's another story altogether about the ace of a staff not pitching until the third game of a best-of-five series, but we'll leave that as a logical concession to putting the player's health ahead of the team's ultimate goal. It is worth noting that this is another example of the delicate balance ball clubs tightrope when it comes to \"caring\" for an individual while trying to win as a team. \nThat brings us back to \"team.\" And, as a part of the 2015 New York Mets, Harvey has a responsibility to the teammates he has repeatedly said were his priority. A hundred times since the controversy of late August, Harvey noted how he would always be there for his teammates and the last thing he wanted to do was cause anyone to think otherwise. \nWell, from his home in lower Manhattan, it takes anywhere from 30 minutes to an hour to make the drive to Citi Field. So, conservatively, Harvey would have had to be on the road by 11:00 (or, preferably, a bit earlier) in order to know he'd be on the field by noon. \nHarvey wasn't. \nIn fact, no one really knows where he was or what he was doing other than him, and he's not saying. But, I'll tell you who is talking: the team's veteran third baseman, David Wright. \n\"I'm concerned about the guys who were here and the guys that are had a great workout, so you'll have to ask Matt...\" was Wright's response to Harvey's absence. \"The guys who were here today took care of business and got ready for Friday,\" he said. \nWright has had his own health battle over the last few years, including this season as he was diagnosed with spinal stenosis and missed about four months rehabilitating something that began as a strained hamstring. \nHe is also the only member of the organization, let alone the team, who was around when the Mets last played a postseason game and understands that there are no guarantees at all that you'll ever have this chance again. \nThe sad part about this saga is that it appeared that Harvey had put the late-August, me-first episode in everyone's rearview mirror. When Collins, the manager whom Harvey disrespected by not showing up on time Tuesday, spoke openly two weeks ago about how the pitcher came to him and said \"give me the ball,\" it appeared as though he'd turned back into the Dark Knight of Gotham. \nNot so fast, fans. In missing Tuesday's workout, Harvey personally put that wedge back between himself and his teammates. \nNow, when he takes the ball for Game 3, regardless of the status of the series, Harvey has no choice but to perform like an ace. Because the only way for him to avoid being a goat is to be a horse. His teammates are angry. His manager is frustrated. Matt's reputation is, justifiably, taking a beating. \nMonday is a long way away, and based on what happens Friday and Saturday in Los Angeles, there could be an enormous amount of pressure on Harvey to perform like the hero he so desperately desires to be. \nIf he doesn't, tunnel traffic will be the least of his worries.
