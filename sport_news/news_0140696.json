Eliot said. “He’s taken a very serious attitude which is good. He’s come to work every day. He’s paying attention and doing what we ask.” Eliot said the key for Elam taking on a bigger role will be mastering his technique and playing through fatigue.\nInjury update: Freshman backup linebacker Jordan Jones has returned to practice after missing the Auburn game with an ankle injury. With senior nose guard Melvin Lewis lost for the rest of the season (fractured fibula), redshirt freshmen Adrian Middleton and Tymere Dubose have seen additional reps in relief of Elam. \"We don’t have a lot of guys out,” Eliot said. “Obviously losing Melvin is going to hurt us, not only with his play but with his leadership too. But I think we’re in good shape.”\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nUK players brace for Starkville cowbells\nExplaining the third-down woes: Kentucky’s defense struggled mightily on third down for much of the Auburn game, allowing the Tigers to convert 11 of 18 third downs in the game. Auburn converted 8 of 11 third downs in the first half and converted each of its first six third downs in the game.\nWhile the UK coaches worried about how the fast-paced tempo of the Auburn offense would affect the defense, Eliot said that concern was not the cause of the third-down woes.\n“Good thing is we were able to get lined up to their tempo,” Eliot said. “We reviewed the film and there weren’t any plays that we didn’t get lined up. We were prepared for that, but we didn’t execute as well on third down defense in the last game as we had in previous SEC games.”\nEliot said the defense accomplished its goal of holding Auburn to less than 3.9 yards per run, but the passing game hurt it.\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nUK WR Thaddeus Snodgrass to transfer\n“Then we got into a lot of third and long situations, which I would have thought that if we got into a lot of third and long situations in that game with them being a running team, we would be in good shape,” Eliot said. “After reviewing the film, I think it was a combination of pass rush on third down and then tackling. We had them in position a couple of times and we didn't get them on the ground. And then you just got to win some one-on-one in coverage, too.”\nPick Problem : Kentucky has not recorded an interception since Sept. 19 against Florida, but the drought is not because of a lack of opportunities.\n“We've dropped a lot,” Eliot said. “We've had our opportunities and we haven't been able to pull them in. We've got to make those plays.”\nTHE COURIER-JOURNAL\nQ&A: UK's Eliot talks replacing Lewis\nMississippi State quarterback Dak Prescott is one of two starting quarterbacks in the Southeastern Conference who has yet to throw an interception this season. That impressive ball security would make a Kentucky pick in Starkville all the more important.\n“Yes, I think there is motivation to play against Dak Prescott,” Eliot said. “He's such a great quarterback that when we have success I think that'll be a good accomplishment.”\nEmail Jon Hale at jahale@courier-journal.com .
