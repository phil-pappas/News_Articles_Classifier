A muscle strain caused the Richmond High School standout to miss time, and he played through the postseason at less than 100 percent. \nHe still helped the Red Devils reach semistate, though, a destination his team returned to earlier this month. \nThis year Hollingsworth is healthy -- and still playing. He'll make his state finals singles debut this Friday at Park Tudor. \nHollingsworth will play at 2 p.m. vs. Logan Charbonneau, a fellow junior from New Albany who is 26-2. \n\"I can't take anybody for granted,\" Hollingsworth said. \"I have to come out and I have to play my normal game and play the way I have been.\" \nHollingsworth's \"normal game\" this season has netted the Red Devil standout a 27-0 record. He was also instrumental in netting the Red Devils sectional and regional championship repeats. \nHollingsworth advanced to the state finals by going a perfect 6-0 through the postseason. He didn't lose during that stretch last season until semistate, despite battling pain he described as \"excruciating\" at times. \n\"When I was injured I would have to almost half serve,\" Hollingsworth said. \"I wasn't really able to stretch that muscle hardly at all. I've been doing exercises. I'm back to 100 percent now.\" \nThere are eight players still left in the state singles tournament. North Central's Steven Christie (25-1) plays Yorktown's Ian Landwehr (23-1), Culver Academies' Sam Concannon (25-0) meets Crown Point's Bryce Bonin (21-1) and Leo's Eli Steiner (24-3) faces Franklin's Noah Roberts (24-2) in Friday's other quarterfinal matches. \nThe four winners advances to Saturday's semifinal round at 10 a.m. The championship will be played at 2 p.m. \n\"He's really excited to get to this point, just to be able to play with the final eight kids in Indiana,\" said RHS coach Randy Hollingsworth, who is Eric's father. \"He's worked hard all year. \n\"It's going to be a lot of fun. It's something you dream about. I always dreamed about it as a player. To have your son there, it's very exciting.\" \nConcannon and Landwehr played at last year's state finals, with Concannon advancing to the championship match before falling to Danny Rayl of Park Tudor. \nRandy Hollingsworth said there was no clear favorite among this year's state contenders. \n\"It's pretty even,\" he said. \n\"He (Eric) just has to do what he's done all year, and that's play good, smart tennis. He has not beat himself. He's played pretty error-free tennis. He's gotten off to a pretty good start in all of his matches and I think that's key this weekend. Against good players, it's hard to come back after you're down.\" \nHollingsworth played one of the other seven finalists earlier this year, defeating Landwehr 6-7, 7-6, 10-7 during the Delta Invitational in late September. \nHollingsworth pointed to groundstrokes as a big part of his game, as his well as his ability to have a high first-serve percentage. \n\"I'm playing with a ton of confidence,\" Eric Hollingsworth said. \"I've been playing really well lately. I'm ready for Friday.\" \nJosh Chapin: (765) 973-4463 jchapin@pal-item.com or twitter.com/JoshChapinPI \nAt a Glance \nWhat: IHSAA boys tennis singles state tournament \nWhen/where: 2 p.m. Friday and Saturday at Park Tudor \nFriday's matches: Steven Christie (North Central, 25-1) vs. Ian Landwehr (Yorktown, 23-1); Eric Hollingsworth (Richmond, 27-0) vs. Logan Charbonneau (New Albany, 26-2); Sam Concannon (Culver Academies, 25-0) vs. Bryce Bonin (Crown Point, 21-1); Eli Steiner (Leo, 24-3) vs. Noah Roberts (Franklin Community, 24-2) \nNext: Friday's winners advance to play in semifinals at 10 a.m. Saturday; Championship is 2 p.m. Read or Share this story: http://pinews.co/1RXdMwZ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T08:07:19.006+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
