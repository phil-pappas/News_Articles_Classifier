The governing body soon issued an official communique to announce that the 79-year-old Blatter had been \"relieved of all his duties.\"\nBlatter's job title was even wiped from his Twitter profile and the presidential page expunged, with a site for acting president Issa Hayatou uploaded in its place.\nBoth Platini and Blatter were suspended after becoming embroiled in a Swiss criminal investigation into financial wrongdoing at FIFA. If Platini does appeal and it is denied, it would effectively rule him out of the running to succeed Blatter as FIFA president in the election on Feb. 26.\nSince a criminal case was opened against Blatter two weeks ago, he has been communicating in public through his lawyers, rather than through official FIFA channels. But Platini's statement attacking allegations that are \"astonishingly vague\" is the lead item on UEFA's corporate website.\nAnd despite the actions of FIFA in Zurich, UEFA has not elevated Angel Maria Villar - the body's most senior vice president - to the top job at its headquarters in Nyon.\nVillar, the head of the Spanish soccer federation, is also at risk of sanctions from a separate investigation into soccer corruption.\n\"It seems to me that UEFA is trying to fudge it by saying they are not appointing someone in (Platini's) place,\" British lawyer Nick De Marco, a specialist in sports law, told The Associated Press. \"Under the rules, they have to have someone in his place chairing meetings.\"\nIt is likely that Villar will chair Thursday's hastily-organized meeting of both UEFA's 54 members and the executive committee - despite not being appointed acting president as statutes dictate.\nLast month, Platini was questioned by Swiss investigators about a payment of 2 million Swiss francs (about $2 million) he received from FIFA in 2011 for work carried out up to 2002. Blatter is being investigated as a suspect in the case, while Platini is being treated \"between a witness and an accused person,\" according to Swiss attorney general Michael Lauber.\n___\nRob Harris can be followed at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
