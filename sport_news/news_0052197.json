The U.S. men's national team, which has failed to qualify for two of the past three Olympic Games, is 90 minutes — possibly more — from stamping its ticket to Rio de Janeiro next summer.\nA win over Honduras on Saturday afternoon at Rio Tinto Stadium qualifies the U.S. U-23s, a dominant albeit untested group so far in the CONCACAF Olympic qualifying tournament, for Brazil. On top of that, it would get the Americans to the Olympic qualifying final Tuesday evening in Sandy, where they would face the winner of Saturday's second semifinal between Mexico and Canada.\n  Scoring a tournament-high 13 goals and dominating the group stage at 3-0-0, the U.S. has been led by a distinctive pair, both up top and in the back. Forwards Jordan Morris and Jerome Kiesewetter each have three goals thus far in the tournament. Morris is a 20-year-old junior at Stanford while Kiesewetter, a striker for Bundesliga side VfB Stuttgart, is one of the many German-Americans introduced into the fray under national team coach Jurgen Klinsmann.\nThe duo in the back is unique in its own right.\nTalented towering New York Red Bulls center back Matt Miazga is paired with Cameron Carter-Vickers, a hulking presence who is 17 years old. Carter-Vickers is the son of former NBA player Howard Carter, who was drafted No. 15 overall by the Denver Nuggets in 1983. He grew up in England and is currently in the Tottenham Hotspurs youth system. Both American center backs scored in the 6-1 rout of Cuba on Saturday.\nReal Salt Lake's Luis Gil and RSL rookie defender Boyd Okwuonu provide local intrigue, too. Gil had two goals and three assists in group play and will likely be tasked to connect the dots in the midfield to help the U.S. generate its attack. Okwuonu started in wins against Cuba and Panama.\nBy defeating Honduras, the U.S. would also eradicate the nightmares of the past three years. The Americans failed to advance out of group play in the 2012 Olympic qualifiers in a 3-3 draw against Honduras. In 2004, they failed to qualify for the Athens Games after losing to Mexico in the semifinals.\nThe Hondurans will pose issues. The quick-striking and physical counterattacking team features two talented goal-scorers in Alberth Elis and Antony Lozano, each with two goals in the group stage. Honduras is considered an up-and-coming group in the region, having qualified for the London Games in 2012.\n\"We kind of know that they're a very physical team, which [is] a lot of [what] CONCACAF is,\" Morris said. \"It's a battle. It's a fight.\"\nA loss Saturday does not eliminate any country from qualifying. The winner of Tuesday's third-place game is placed into a one-game playoff in March 2016 against CONMEBOL (South America) representative Colombia for one final shot at Rio.\n\"It's not just going to Rio,\" Gil said. \"You're being part of history. Being part of the Olympics, not every soccer player gets to do that.\"\nckamrani@sltrib.com \nTwitter: @chriskamrani", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:55:13.107+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
