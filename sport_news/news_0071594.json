(Photo: William Woody / wwoody@citizen-times.com, William Woody / wwoody@citizen-times.com) \nUnless noted, all kickoffs at 7:30 p.m. \nMountain Athletic 3-A/4-A \nROBERSON (2-6, 1-2) at ASHEVILLE (7-1, 2-1) \nLast week: Roberson lost to Erwin, 35-31; Asheville beat McDowell, 54-7. \nLast year: Asheville beat Roberson, 49-7. \nNotes: Let's make a Deal. Second-year Roberson coach Chris Deal decided to take his offense in a new direction last week, giving son Luke Deal (95 rushing yards, 75 passing yards and two combined touchdowns) his first varsity start at quarterback. The freshman rewarded that confidence by running for two early touchdowns to help give the Rams a 28-7 first-half lead. Otherwise, Dezmond Moorman (552 yards, eight touchdowns) has been the team's chief rushing threat while Denzel Summey (14 receptions for 282 yards and two touchdowns) is the only Rams player with double-digit catches. Roberson's defense is strengthened by Seth Griswold (12.4 tackles per game), Logan Wells (10.0), Robert Balcom (6.3), Greg Johnston (4.5), Gilbert Whiteside (4.5) and Ian McAdoo (4.3). The Asheville offense feeds off of Devon Davidson (902 yards and 10 touchdowns with six interceptions), Reggie Battle (1,125 yards, 14 touchdowns), Ahmad Shivers (324 yards, five touchdowns), Aquila Smith (306 yards, six touchdowns) and Isaiah Drummond (15 receptions for 314 yards and five touchdowns). On the other side of the ball, the Cougars depend on Christian Green (11.4 tackles per game), Jose Daniels (8.0), Makaius Brewer (6.5) and Kanaje Allen (4.6). Longtime Asheville assistant coach Charlie Metcalf has recently returned to practices after receiving aggressive chemotherapy at Duke University. Metcalf, who has been on the team's staff for 12 years, is batting cancer for the second time. The Cougars lead this all-time series, 19-5, with the last Roberson victory coming in 2012. \nPick: Asheville by 14. Erwin defeated Roberson 35-31 Thursday at Roberson High School.

Others are lethal on any given night. And then some are both like Erwin junior Damien Ferguson (2,197 yards and 20 touchdowns with seven interceptions). The Warriors signal-caller passed for a single-game school record 449 yards in last week's live TV win over Roberson. Ferguson has now strung together a dozen consecutive games with 200-plus yards and has 4,794 career yards in the past two seasons as a starter. He is the latest winner of the Mission Health Spotlight Performance of the Week Award. Ferguson's receiving corps is a steadfast group, headed up by C.J. Thompson (57 receptions for 632 yards and nine touchdowns), Chase Austin (49 receptions for 743 yards and three touchdowns) and Kealin Goode (46 receptions for 436 yards and three touchdowns). Rushing-wise, Erwin depends on Isaiah Poore (470 yards, five touchdowns), Quentin Smith (273 yards, two touchdowns) and Ferguson (253 yards, three touchdowns). As far as defense goes, Cameron Connors (9.9 tackles per game), Rayonte Mills (8.1), Lucas Towles (7.3), Trey Martin (6.1) and Thompson (6.1) are noteworthy. That unit's biggest concern Friday will be a North Buncombe passing game that features Chase Parker (1,277 yards and 10 touchdowns with five interceptions), Ricky Thrash (44 receptions for 429 yards) and Blake Mathews (22 receptions for 668 yards and nine touchdowns). Colby Maltry (517 yards, five touchdowns) and Nick Lisenbee (374 yards, five touchdowns) are the primary rushers and leading tacklers are Logan Anderson (7.8 a game), Peter Simonovich (6.9), Sammy MacDonald (5.8) and Dmitryi Simonovich (5.1). Erwin leads this all-time series, 31-22-1. \nPick: Erwin by 1. \nMCDOWELL (3-6, 0-4) at REYNOLDS (7-1, 3-0) \nLast week: McDowell lost to Asheville, 54-7; Reynolds beat Enka, 64-3. \nLast year: Reynolds beat McDowell, 72-41. \nNotes: Five touchdowns in one game? Just another day at the office for Rico Dowdle (1,567 rushing yards, 791 passing yards). The Reynolds senior now has 38 combined touchdowns (31 rushing, seven passing) and remains on track to challenge the WNC single-season record for touchdown responsibility (55) set by former Erwin quarterback Garrett Brown in 2010. As of Tuesday night, N.C. State has joined fellow ACC programs Boston College and Wake Forest in offering Dowdle a scholarship. Someone has to be there to catch Dowdle's passes and those players for the Rockets have been Keyal Talbert (19 receptions for 190 yards and two touchdowns), who is currently out with an injury, along with A.J. Logan (785 rushing yards, 176 receiving yards and eight combined touchdowns) and Eunique Waters (14 receptions for 129 yards and three touchdowns) who are both healthy at the moment. Aundreas Hill (12.1 tackles per game) is only three stops away from the 100-mark for the season. Other stalwarts on that side of the ball for the Rockets are Najae Buchanan (8.9), Deshawn Finley (7.1), Austin McCurry (6.5), Noah Eberhardt (6.1), Talon James (5.6) and Malik Long (5.5). Reynolds hasn't lost to McDowell since 1995 and leads the all-time series, 17-3. Titans senior Casey Ray increased his school career records for passing yardage (4,117) and passing touchdowns (33) last Friday with a fourth-quarter strike to Andruw Randolph. Tackling leaders for McDowell are Devon Patton (6.0), Chase Campbell (6.0), Kaali Tobe (5.6), Isaiah Smith (5.2), Damon McNeely (5.1) and Adam Randolph (4.8). \nPick: Reynolds by 21. \nSMOKY MOUNTAIN (4-4, 2-2) at BREVARD (2-6, 0-4) \nLast week: Smoky Mountain beat East Henderson, 28-0; Brevard lost to West Henderson, 12-7. \nLast year: Smoky Mountain beat Brevard, 48-14. \nNotes: Are there more than one of you? Smoky Mountain opponents must be wondering with senior Carlos Pantoja's ability to cover a football field. Pantoja is averaging a Western North Carolina-best 12.6 tackles per game and cracked the 100-mark for the season last Friday. As a team, the Mustangs have now recorded two shutout wins in one season (East Henderson and Swain County) for the first time since 1997. Other leading tacklers are Jace Milkey (6.2 tackles per game) and Jacob Gass (5.5). Milkey and Matthew Ridley (422 yards, four touchdowns) ran for a pair of touchdowns apiece last Friday and the team rolled up 385 rushing yards. Carson Shuler (523 yards, four touchdowns) enjoyed his third 100-yard game of the season with handoffs coming from Chase Fisher (465 yards and two touchdowns with four interceptions). Brevard got its only touchdown a week ago from Tanner Pettit, who leads the Blue Devils in rushing (677 yards, seven touchdowns), receiving and tackles (12.5 per game). Pettit (23 receptions for 225 yards and two touchdowns), Nick Cabe (24 receptions for 365 yards and five touchdowns and Hamilton Lopez (17 receptions for 201 yards and one touchdown) are a formidable receiving trio for Tanner Ellenberger (1,082 yards and nine touchdowns with five interceptions). Other key tacklers for Brevard are Kyle Williams (11.1 tackles a game), Earon Wilkes (9.5) and Lopez (6.4). \nPick: Smoky Mountain by 14. \nFRANKLIN (6-2, 4-0) at EAST HENDERSON (1-7, 1-3) \nLast week: Franklin beat North Henderson, 28-12; East Henderson lost to Smoky Mountain, 28-0. \nLast year: Franklin beat East Henderson, 44-6. \nNotes: Where is the dividing line in WNC Athletic Conference football? Somewhere between Franklin and everybody else. The Panthers and Kelton Lowry (982 yards, 14 touchdowns) have now won 20 straight conference games dating back to 2012. Lowry is one good carry away from his first 1,000-yard season. Jackson Perone (621 yards and two touchdowns with five interceptions), Hunter Gibbs (497 yards, two touchdowns) and Jordin Nugent (16 receptions for 238 yards and two touchdowns) are other big threats. Gibbs sets the pace in tackles with 11.9 a night, followed by Dillon Daves (6.5), Lowry (6.1), Clayton Phillips (5.9), Kendrick Bryson (5.3) and Blake Raymond (4.8). East Henderson will look to counter with offensive players like Trace Goldsmith (661 yards and eight touchdowns with six interceptions), Cole Revis (295 yards, two touchdowns), Nick Lyons (251 rushing yards, 161 receiving yards and four combined touchdowns) and Josh Glynn (21 receptions for 338 yards and four touchdowns). Tackling-wise, Revis (8.0), Lyons (6.1) and Coal Webb (5.9) have distinguished themselves. \nPick: Franklin by 21. \nPISGAH (5-3, 2-2) at NORTH HENDERSON (5-3, 2-2) \nLast week: Pisgah beat Tuscola, 20-17; North Henderson lost to Franklin, 28-12. \nLast year: Pisgah beat North Henderson, 35-10. \nNotes: Brett Chappell has put his own stamp on the Pisgah football program in three years as coach. Going 3-0 against Tuscola will do that. Black Bears senior Daniel VanVaerenbergh (1,106 yards, nine touchdowns) went over the 1,000-yard mark for the first time in his career last Friday in Waynesville. Michael Parrott (227 yards, four touchdowns) has been a good complimentary piece to the Pisgah running game which is balanced out by Houston Rogers (777 yards and nine touchdowns with five interceptions) and receivers such as Trey Morgan (29 receptions for 376 yards and six touchdowns) and Jesse Martinez (22 receptions for 279 yards and two touchdowns). The defense gets its strength from Jeff Albritton (5.4 tackles per game), Garrett Jones (5.0) and Isaiah Fisher (4.3). North Henderson senior Trevor Craft (950 passing yards, 738 rushing yards and 18 combined touchdowns), Ashton Woodring (22 receptions for 308 yards and three touchdowns), Darren Lammons (20 receptions for 386 yards and five touchdowns) and the rest of the Knights are seeking their first-ever win over Pisgah (the Black Bears have won the previous 14 meetings since 2001). North Henderson's defense is buoyed by Cole McCarson (11.1 tackles per game), Austin Vanhoy (10.6), Brandon Johnson (7.0), Cameron Bumgarner (6.9) and Drew Mitchell (6.6). \nPick: Pisgah by 3.
