Toyota just can’t catch a break this season in the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series. \nHayley, who qualified sixth for Saturday night’s Rhino Linings 350, moved up the track to take the lead on lap 69 of the 146 lap race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. \nAt one point he had built up a five second lead before a misstep on pit road during a green flag stop put him back to 14th position. \nThe 19 year-old Calgary native fought his way back to what looked like a top-five finish when his truck ran low on fuel. \nA stop for a splash of gas ended any chance for a win and resulted in a 10th-place finish. \nIt was Hayley’s second fuel issue on a 1.5 mile oval this season. \n“We ran among the leaders the entire race, led some laps, and had a really fast Tundra,” he said in a team release. “I’m not a fan of fuel mileage races but it’s a part of the sport. \n“This is the second fuel mileage race we’ve lost and hopefully our luck can turn around for the rest of the season.” \nBIG SPENDERS \nMercedes may have won both the Formula 1 constructors’ championship and the world driving championship last season but records released this week show the German auto giant’s racing team lost a whopping $117 million US in 2014. \nMost of the loss, the company said in a statement, came from increased payroll and bonus costs that were a direct result of winning both titles. \n“Operating costs rose by £49.5m ($75 M) due to significantly higher performance bonuses payable as a consequence of the record-breaking level of sporting performance, and also increased costs arising from regulation change,” the report said. \nMercedes bosses, however, were not concerned about the huge loss saying its was “within the pre-defined parameters set by the shareholders”. \nFINISH LINES \nAfter tons of speculation that Richard Petty Motorsports might move to Toyota or Chevrolet for engine support in 2016, the team will announce on Tuesday it is staying with Ford for the No. 43 and No. 9 Sprint Cup team according to Motorsport.com.
