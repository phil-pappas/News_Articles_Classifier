If the companies got too aggressive with their advertising in daily fantasy sports, they could face some harsh blowback from those who might want to crack down on them.\n“Everybody needs to really think about who’s listening when you speak,” the lobbyist, Tom Walls, told the convention crowd. “We speak in advertisements. We speak in the press. Use good language. Avoid language that could lead to this further confusion of fantasy sports and betting. This is the stuff that will be weapons for people who want to pass unwelcome legislation about fantasy sports.”\nIt was a hard line to walk for companies that are offering big cash prizes to customers who want to risk money on sports.\nFor starters, Walls made his remarks at a fantasy sports industry conference in Las Vegas — on the same floor where gamblers were making legal sports bets at the Bellagio hotel-casino.\nSeveral months later, daily fantasy companies DraftKings and FanDuel started blitzing the airwaves with advertisements bragging about how much money they pay out to winners.\nUSA TODAY\nDraftKings, FanDuel each seek third-party reviews\nNeither company is profitable yet. So they were making a gamble of their own, hoping that big spending on advertising now will bring in more revenue later. But now it’s backfired. The commercials got too much attention, including from lawmakers who want more oversight over this booming new industry.\nAmong them was a state Assemblyman from California, Adam Gray, who has introduced a bill to oversee the industry. His bill seeks to make sure the state is not subject to an unnecessary and unprecedented expansion of gambling and that the state is “not deprived of revenues to which it would otherwise be entitled from these activities.”\n“Like everyone else, Assemblyman Gray noted that almost every other ad during the opening weekend of football promoted fantasy gaming online,” Gray’s chief of staff, Mike Lynch, told USA TODAY Sports. “His interest is to insure a level of consumer and law enforcement protection.”\nIt’s exactly what these companies were trying to avoid. After operating largely without regulation, now they face possible fees, taxation and rules they didn’t have to deal with previously, if not some sort of ban.\nThe heat intensified this week when it was learned that an employee for DraftKings had won $350,000 in a contest on FanDuel. The same employee had inadvertently leaked insider data about which players were the hottest to own that week — information that could be used to identify market inefficiencies and improve one’s chances of success against the field.\nThe companies said there was no evidence of wrongdoing or insider trading, but New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman has launched an inquiry in response.\n“What happened in over the last few days is probably the single greatest engine towards regulation that we’re going to have,” said attorney Daniel Wallach, an expert in sports and gaming law.\nFederal law allows paid fantasy sports under certain conditions, including having it reflect the skill of the participants, instead of pure luck like traditional gambling. In exchange for an entry fee, daily fantasy sports companies generally offer fans a chance to win daily cash payouts based on the statistical performance of athletes in games that day or week.\nBut the explosive growth of daily fantasy sports wasn’t foreseen at the time this law passed in 2006. FanDuel alone is valued at more than $1 billion and reported 1.2 million users in 2014.\nUSA TODAY\nArmour: Long-overdue, changes coming to daily fantasy sports industry\nAnd now that growth is in jeopardy. Both companies scrambled to answer questions this week about insider access to data that could easily be used to gain an advantage over the public. They even hired outside law firms to review their internal controls against fraud.\n“DraftKings’ explosive growth is a testament to our ability to deepen our fans’ engagement with the sports they love,” the company said in a statement Wednesday. “We are committed to reinforcing the trust and security of our millions of loyal customers.”\nA research analyst who studies the industry predicted something like this would happen at the same conference in January. Speaking about the future of daily fantasy sports, Adam Krejcik forecast that “within the next 18 months the (daily fantasy) industry will likely face one major PR fiasco.”\nHe said it might be a data breach, a cheating scandal or a political attack. He said then that the industry’s ability to overcome this will be key.\nThat could mean accepting or welcoming regulation instead of fighting it and trying to avoid it by using careful word choices, which has gotten somewhat exhausting.\nAt the conference in January, for example, Paul Charchian, president of the Fantasy Sports Trade Assocation, ripped fantasy companies that used the term “rake” — a word that describes how a cardroom makes money in poker. They generally “rake” around 10% of the pool, much like daily fantasy sports companies.\nBut Krejcik apparently didn’t get the message about what to call it. During his presentation about daily fantasy companies later that day, he said, “The operator collects a rake, and that’s more or less how they make money.”\nListening in the crowd was a FanDuel employee, who shook his head at this statement — either a mistake or a truth, depending on the viewpoint.\nFollow sports reporter Brent Schrotenboer on Twitter @Schrotenboer .
