McCann or Murphy?", "locations": [], "entities": {"persons": [], "locations": [], "organizations": []}, "highlightText": "", "language": "english", "persons": [], "text": "Joe Girardi has put together two lineups to face Houston’s Dallas Keuchel, and neither one worked out very well.\nSo it’s no surprise the Yankees manager is going to wait until the last minute to set a final roster for Tuesday’s wild-card game, but one of the most important moves he figures to have to make will be in left field, where the right-handed Chris Young may be a better option than lefty-swinging Brett Gardner against a southpaw that dominated the Yankees in each game.\n“I’ll have a lineup [Tuesday],” is all Girardi would say after the Yankees worked out at the Stadium on Monday.\nHe put Young in the lineup on June 25 in Houston and again on Aug. 25 in The Bronx. Young went 2-for-4 in the first game, but 0-for-3 the second time around.\n“I don’t have that many at-bats off of [Keuchel],” said Young, who feasted on left-handers for much of the season. “A lot of things can be coincidence. Some guys you see good and you hit the ball hard and it finds a hole. … It’s such a small sample size that I really don’t think about it. I just try to prepare for [Tuesday] if I’m in there and be ready.”\nGardner said he also expected to be in the lineup, but he would likely be the outfielder to sit, since Carlos Beltran is a switch hitter and Jacoby Ellsbury had a hit in three at-bats against Keuchel in August.\nMany of the Yankees’ recent issues offensively can be attributed to Ellsbury and Gardner.\n“Listen, that’s our job, to get on base, and he and I would be the first people to say we haven’t done a really good job of that lately,” Gardner said. “There would be no better time to get on a roll [than] starting [Tuesday].”\nIn each of the first two matchups against Keuchel, John Ryan Murphy was behind the plate, while Brian McCann sat. But a pair of games during the regular season is vastly different from a decisive wild-card game.\nSo even though Murphy went a combined 2-for-6 in those two games, it’s hard to see McCann sitting in the most important game of the Yankees’ season.\n“We have a lineup that’s hard to get through,” said McCann, who also expects to start Tuesday.\nHe also has experience playing in a one-game playoff and understands the rules are different.\n“Anything can happen,” McCann said. “You’re one bad hop away from losing, one big hit away from winning. It’s like a Game 7. You’re going to see things you wouldn’t see during the course of the season and we’ve got the pieces to shorten the game.\nAnd though McCann closed the regular season in a 1-for-22 slide, he is confident that won’t play a role in Tuesday’s game.\n“I feel good,” McCann said. “It comes down to executing four or five at-bats.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brett gardner ,  brian mccann ,  chris young ,  dallas keuchel ,  houston astros ,  john ryan murphy ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york yankees", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:44:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:34:41.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
