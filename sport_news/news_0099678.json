Pat Connaughton collected 11 rebounds and starting center Mason Plumlee went scoreless in 22 minutes. A sore left hip has prevented veteran guard Gerald Henderson from playing any preseason games. \nKINGS: Marco Bellinelli had 11 points and Omri Casspi had 10. Reserve Seth Curry played point guard the entire final quarter and scored all six of his points in the fourth. Rookie Willie Cauley-Stein had seven points and nine rebounds. \nSTAR WATCH: Rudy Gay, the Kings' second-leading scorer in the preseason, was given the night off. Portland played without all-star point guard Damian Lillard, who sprained his left ankle Thursday in a win over Golden State. Lillard has never missed a regular season game in three seasons. \nBALL CONTROL: The Kings had a season-low 13 turnovers after committing 21 or more in their first three games. The Blazers were sloppy for much of the game and had 21 turnovers, including six by Aminu and four by Plumlee. \nUP NEXT: The Blazers visit Utah on Monday. The Kings face the Lakers on Tuesday in Las Vegas. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:13:56.008+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
