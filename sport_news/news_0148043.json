He echoed that sentiment Friday. \n\"I thought we had a great conversation that day, and I thought his attitude was great that day,\" Girardi said. \"He had the right attitude. No player wants to sit there. Even the guys who knew they didn't have a chance to start don't want to sit, they want to be out there, but that's the way you want it.\" \nEllsbury also said he respected Girardi's decision just before the game. But, while each member of the Yankees was in the clubhouse postgame to speak with reporters and teammates, Ellsbury was nowhere to be found, perhaps unwilling to answer questions about either his standing with the club or his performance. \nGirardi said he speaks with players throughout the offseason and that he may have to talk with Ellsbury, whose contract keeps him in the Bronx the next five years at $21-million a season. \nGirardi said Ellsbury's contract didn't play a role in his benching, adding that Carlos Beltran (three years, $45 million) and Gardner (four years, $52 million) each have \"substantial\" contracts, too. Gardner's contract was an extension that kicked in this season. Beltran will enter the final year of his deal in 2016. \n\"Did it work out? No,\" Girardi said. \"But the question I'm going to get is, if you played Ells would it have been better? Would it have been three runs better? I don't know that. None of us knows that. If I would have played this guy, would it have been better? That sort of thing. Only time will tell.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T19:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T22:13:52.068+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
