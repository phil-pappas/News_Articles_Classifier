The Blue Jays clinched their first trip to the American League Championship Series since 1993, overcoming one of the most bizarre plays in playoff history by taking advantage of three Rangers errors for a 6-3 victory.

BATTER INTERFERES WITH CATCHER'S THROW BACK TO PITCHER \nRule 6.03(a)(3) (former Rule 6.06(c)): \nIf the batter interferes with the catcher's throw back to the pitcher by stepping out of the batter's box while at bat (no runners attempting to advance), it shall not be considered interference under Official Baseball Rule 6.03(a)(3) (former OBR 6.06(c)). In such cases, the umpire shall call \"Time\" only (no interference).

If the batter becomes a runner on ball four and the catcher's throw strikes him or his bat, the ball remains alive and in play (provided no intentional interference by the batter-runner). \nIf the batter interferes with the catcher's throw to retire a runner by stepping out of the batter's box, interference shall be called on the batter under Official Baseball Rule 6.03(a)(3) (former OBR 6.06(c)).
