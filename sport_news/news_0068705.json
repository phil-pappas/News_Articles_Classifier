On Wednesday, Kenworthy tweeted a photo of the magazine's cover with the simple and clear message: \"I am gay.\" \n— Gus Kenworthy (@guskenworthy) October 22, 2015 \nAccording to the interview , Kenworthy began coming out to friends and family about two years ago. He has since won a silver medal in the Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. In the interview, Kenworthy acknowledges his doubts about whether friends and fans would continue to support him if they knew about his sexuality, and to having had suicidal thoughts. \"I never got to be proud of what I did in Sochi,\" he explained to the magazine, \"because I felt so horrible about what I didn't do. I didn't want to come out as the silver medalist from Sochi, I wanted to come out as the best freeskier in the world.\"Kenworthy said he knew he was gay by the age of five.The piece touches on the use of anti-gay slurs used by an array of people in Kenworthy's life, as well as the experiences he had hiding his sexuality while competing in Olympic events and the X-Games. \nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
