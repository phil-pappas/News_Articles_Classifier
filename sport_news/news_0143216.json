St. @ Utah Rice-Eccles Stadium, Salt Lake City Oct. 31, 5:00 p.m. 6  Days   16  Hrs   51  Mins   58  Secs More Coverage Utah's unbeaten season crumbles in L.A. as USC overpowers third-ranked Utes 42-24 “ It’s tough to essentially give three touchdowns on turnovers against a team of that caliber and hope to have a chance to win.”\nUtah coach Kyle Whitingham\nLOS ANGELES — On fourth-and-two, late in the second quarter, with his team down a touchdown, Travis Wilson was trying to hit Devontae Booker coming out of the backfield. Except he didn’t see USC's Cameron Smith right there in front of Booker.\nHe should have, because Smith had already intercepted one of Wilson’s passes on the same side of the field earlier in the quarter and returned it 41 yards to set up a USC touchdown that tied the game.\nThis second pick was a killer, however, as Smith, a 6-foot-2, 245-pound freshman, went all the way — 54 yards — for a touchdown that pretty much put the game away for the Trojans as things turned out.\nThen just to make it a hat trick and add insult to injury, Smith picked off Wilson a third time in the fourth quarter and returned it 27 yards into Utah territory.\nUSC was certainly the better team Saturday, but Ute mistakes, particularly Wilson’s interceptions, were the difference in the 42-24 Trojan victory at the L.A. Coliseum.\n“It’s tough to essentially give three touchdowns on turnovers against a team of that caliber and hope to have a chance to win,’’ said Utah coach Kyle Whitingham. “If you’re minus-three in turnovers (not counting the long interception at the end of the game) and have zero takeaways you’re not going to win.’’\nWhittingham tried to be positive about Wilson afterward, saying he completed 70 percent of his passes for 250 yards. But he also couldn’t hide the fact that Wilson’s picks probably cost the Utes ’ their undefeated season.\n“But you can’t take the interceptions, I don’t want to paint that picture, because they were what they were,’’ he said.\nWhittingham said one of the interceptions was because of a mistake by a Ute player who stayed in to block when he should have been on a route occupying the USC linebacker. Another one came on a tipped pass and he didn’t know what happnened on the third.\nOn the key pick just before the half with the Utes down 21-14 and in Trojan territory, Whittingham said his team was trying to score right before the half.\n“We were trying to be aggressive — we were not going to get the ball back in the second half on the kickoff,’’ he said. “It was fourth and less than two, we probably have a 75 to 80 percent chance of converting that and that was a huge deal to convert that going into halftime. That was a huge play in retrospect.’’\nWilson had no reasons for his picks.\n“They played good defense and they have a lot of great athletes,’’ he said. “I have to make smarter decisions. I’ve got to make better throws.’’\nAnother big mistake came early in the third quarter, when the Utes had apparently stopped the Trojans on downs after Cody Kessler threw an incomplete pass on third down. But hold everything. The Utes’ Stevie Tu’ikolovatu was whistled for a personal foul for “hands to the face” — actually Tu’ikolovatu pushed the helmet right off of his opponent's head.\nSo instead of getting the ball back, the Utes gave the Trojans life and they kept a time-consuming 17-play drive alive and scored to make it 35-17.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T08:08:58.459+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
