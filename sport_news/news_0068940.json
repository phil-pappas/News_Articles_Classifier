But these days it's likely that guests will enjoy what's on the menu at both places.\nThe cafeteria at Anderson School is now the Tavern of the Square, as part of the conversion of the old school grounds in Bothell, Wash., to an upscale entertainment venue by the McMenamin brothers of Portland.\nThe former junior high's woodshop is now the Woodshop with capital \"W,\" being a place to watch the game on TV, play tavern games, dine and imbibe.\nMcMenamins Anderson School celebrated its grand opening last weekend, in the suburban community on the northeast outskirts of Seattle. The third large restaurant on the grounds , North Shore Lagoon Bar, was previously described on this website.\nThe Tavern on the Square is the main dining room at McMenamins Anderson School, serving meals morning through night seven days a week. Its farm-to-table fare is similar to the Black Rabbit restaurant at McMenamins' signature property in Oregon, the Edgefield Manor at Troutdale. The well-stocked bar has a drink menu with 179 types of whiskeys, scotches and bourbons on the menu. Tavern on the Square is open daily 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., with 1 a.m. closings on Fridays and Saturdays.\nIt's also the place to celebrate the major seasonal events, including Thanksgiving Day dinner on Nov. 26, followed by breakfast with Santa Claus on Dec. 5.\nTavern on the Square also has the gift shop, hotel registration desk, a room for private dinners, fireplace sitting area while waiting for restaurant seating and covered outdoor dining.\nThe Woodshop also has outdoor seating that blends into much more hospitality space outside designed to be served from the Shed, a small bar that is the only new ground-up construction in the converted school grounds.\nThe Woodshop has a pub atmosphere, with sports on television, pool tables and shuffleboard tables. Dining capacity is 185, making it the complex's second largest restaurant behind the 205 capacity for Tavern on the Square. Woodshop is open 11 a.m. to 1:30 a.m. daily.\nMcMenamins Anderson School is at 18603 Bothell Way N.E., Bothell; 425-398-0122; mcmenamins.com .\nStay tuned to this website for more on McMenamins Anderson School.\nEarlier reports about the opening of Anderson School entertainment complex:\nMcMenamins opens Anderson School with huge Bothell party\nMcMenamins North Shore Lagoon blends tiki bar , swimming pool\n-- Terry Richard\ntrichard@oregonian.com\n503-221-8222; @trichardpdx", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:21:59.622+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
