Make sure it fits properly and is not in the way of his breathing, eyesight or hearing. If your dog swallows any elastic or decorative items, it could cause intestinal obstructions or choking.\nChocolate and sweets can be dangerous for dogs. A dog's digestive system is not adapted for sweets, and chocolate contains theobromine, which can be harmful and sometimes fatal to your dog. Baking chocolate is especially high in this chemical.\n•Walk your dog early on Halloween, while it is still light outside and the ground is visible. Your dog may find candy, wrappers and broken eggs on lawns and streets. Make sure that these \"tempting treats\" stay out of reach.\nChildren in costumes can frighten dogs — especially when they're excited and loud. Make sure pets are in a safe and secure room when you answer the door to prevent them from running out, getting hurt and frightening your visitors.\nIf you want your dog to greet trick-or-treaters, keep him on a leash. Your dog may be stressed by the noise, activity or simply the interruption of his normal routine.\nDon't leave your dog unattended outside on Halloween, even if he is behind a fence. Pranksters may target your dog with eggs, and passers-by may be tempted to give your dog treats and candy that can harm him.\nIf you are having a Halloween party, consider confining your dog securely in one area of the house. Leave a radio or TV and lights on for the dog, and check on him regularly.\nBe careful about where you place candles and jack-o'-lanterns. They can easily be knocked over by your dog's wagging tail and burn your dog or even start a fire.\nFor more tips on dog ownership, visit the AKC website .\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency.\nCopyright © 2015, Chicago Tribune Halloween American Kennel Club Family", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561d1ea2/turbine/ct-pets-halloween-safety-20151013"], "published": "2015-10-13T21:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T23:22:31.207+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
