(AP) Om won the $200,000 Twilight Derby by 2 1/4 lengths Saturday at Santa Anita. \nRidden by Gary Stevens, Om ran 1 1/8 miles on turf in 1:45.90 and paid $3, $2.40 and $2.20 as the 1-2 favorite. \nIreland-bred Mister Brightside returned $6.40 and $4.40 in his U.S. debut for his owner, retired rider Walter Swinburn. \nRoyal Albert Hall was another half-length back in third and paid $3.40 to show. \nThe victory, worth $120,000, increased Om's career earnings to $394,500, with four wins in eight starts. \nIt was an emotional victory for Om's owner, the Sareen Family Trust. U.S. Marine Major Taj Sareen, the son of K.B. Sareen, was killed this week when his FA-18 fighter jet crashed shortly after takeoff from a British air base. \n''They lost their son and he's a hero for real, not pretend,'' winning trainer Dan Hendricks said. ''A fighter jet pilot who gave his life for our country.'' \nBaseball Hall of Fame manager Tom Lasorda presented the trophy to the winner of the Grade 2 race. \nIn the $70,000 Big Bear Stakes, Dortmund won by 1 3/4 lengths in his first start since finishing fourth in the Preakness on May 16 and first against older horses. \nRidden by Martin Garcia, Dortmund ran one mile in 1:36.42 and paid $2.60, $2.10 and $2.10 for trainer Bob Baffert. \n''I knew he was going to come back strong,'' Garcia said. ''It was a morning workout for him and I'm really excited about the future.'' \nThe victory, worth $43,080, increased Dortmund's career earnings to $1,622,480, with seven wins in nine starts. He was undefeated in six starts before finishing third in the Kentucky Derby. \nPoint Piper returned $3.20 and $2.40, while Motown Men was another 5 3/4 lengths back in third and paid $2.40 to show. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:51:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T04:58:03.254+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
