To follow was a procession of tanks and other military might rolling past the square.\nImpoverished North Korea and rich, democratic South Korea remain technically at war after their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a treaty. The North, slapped with UN and US sanctions for its nuclear weapons and rocket programmes, often threatens to destroy the South, and its major ally the United States, in a sea of flames.\nIn a letter delivered by Liu, the most senior Chinese official to visit Pyongyang since leader Kim came to power following his father’s death in 2011, Xi said China attached vital importance to its relationship with North Korea, China’s official Xinhua news agency said.\nChina is North Korea’s chief ally and its main trading partner, although ties have been strained over the North’s nuclear programme.\nXi said in the letter that China had “been striving to treat the bilateral relations from a strategic and long-term perspective”. Liu reiterated China’s position that it wanted an early resumption of the so-called six-party talks aimed at reining in North Korea’s nuclear ambitions.\n“The Chinese side is willing to seek closer communication and deepen cooperation, pushing for a long-term, healthy and stable development of the Sino-DPRK ties,” Xi said in the letter cited by Xinhua, referring to North Korea by its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\nKim, who is in his early thirties, told the visiting Chinese delegation on Friday that North Korea was also keen to bolster ties, the North’s official KCNA news agency said on Saturday.\nLiu is the fifth-ranked member on China’s ruling Communist Party’s elite Politburo Standing Committee.\nOn Wednesday, a high-level US military official said Washington believed North Korea had the capability to launch a nuclear weapon against the US mainland and stood ready to defend against any such attacks. — Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T12:02:30.070+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
