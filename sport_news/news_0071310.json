By the end of the night, the Eagles had made a huge statement grounding the Ravens 42-0 to take the division lead while handing Tech their first loss of the season. Will Knight opened the scoring Saturday night, breaking multiple Tech tackles for a 72-yard touchdown. A Smyrna two-point conversion made it 8-0 Eagles, a lead they would hold through the first quarter. Smyrna grew their lead near the mid-way point of the second quarter on another Knight score, this one from 19-yards out; a two-point Smyrna try failed and the Eagles led 14-0. After blocking a Sussex Tech punt late in the first half, Smyrna quarterback Nolan Henderson connected with Charlie Taylor for an 11-yard touchdown, a Will Knight two-point conversion run gave Smyrna a 22-0 advantage at the break. Early in the third, Henderson found Donte Ritchie on a 61-yard pass and catch for a score and Smyrna increased their lead to 28-0. On their very next possession, Henderson stayed hot finding Taylor again for another score through the air and the Eagles began to run away with things, 34-0. Henderson threw his fourth and final touchdown of the evening just before the fourth quarter, finding Brandon Bishop for a 46-yard score to put the final nail in the game. It was a tough night for a Sussex Tech defense coming in that had allowed only 55 total points on the year before watching the Eagles light up the scoreboard for 42 points on Saturday night. The Ravens look to bounce back Friday night when they travel to take on the win-less Polytech Panthers. Meanwhile, the Eagles have now won three in a row and now lead the Henlopen North at 5-1 holding the tie-breaker over the Ravens with the head-to-head win. Smyrna looks to continue their winning ways on Friday when they host Sussex Central.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:15:37.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
