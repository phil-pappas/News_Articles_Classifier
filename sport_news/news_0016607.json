He had a linebacker running with him and he put the ball right in his hands.” \nMohave linebacker/running back Takory Brown said it was disappointing because the T-birds really want to win. \n“We were making tackles, we were sprinting to the ball,” said Brown about Mohave’s early success defensively. \nRuckle said RVHS co-head coach and offensive coordinator Paul Ducchaineau was looking at what Mohave was doing defensively. \n“Then we were trying some different things we were putting together while the game was being played, a game plan where we could attack,” Ruckle said. “Once we saw where their weakness \nwas, that’s just where we just kept coming at them.” \nGalvez’s 67-yard TD run, Fohs’ PAT, made it 23-0 with 8:07 to go in the second period. \n“They broke a couple of tackles,” Olvera said. “We just have to tackle better.” \nGalvez suffered a hamstring injury and was removed from the game in the third period. \n“I hope Galvez is OK,” Olvera said. “He’s a great football player. \n“I hate to see a kid go down.” \nEconomou’s 31-yard catch-and-run TD pass to wide receiver David Larrabee, Foh’s PAT, made it 30-0 at 3:53. \n“We did a very good job defensively,” T-birds lineman Dom Larocque said. “But once we give up a couple of scores, (we) put our heads down.” \nThe T-birds broke the Dust Devils’ 4 1 / 2 game shutout streak when quarterback Oliver Syme tossed a 10-yard TD pass to tight end Matt McKee, McKee PAT, which made it 30-7 at 30.7 seconds. \nWhen McKee was asked how he felt about breaking River Valley’s shutout streak, he said, “It felt pretty good. \n“Our passing was pretty good at the end of the first half.” \nLee, who was at fullback periodically on offense, scored on an 11-yard TD run, Fohs’ PAT, made it 37-7 with 7:21 left in the third period. \nDust Devils fullback Devin Anderson’s 22-yard TD run made it 43-7 at 2:31. \n“I think we’ve got a great stable of backs, they’re a bunch of kids who’ve got speed and are tough,” Ruckle said. “Galvez would’ve had 300 yards if there weren’t some issues. \n“I think all of those guys came out tonight with the intention of taking it to them and running hard.” \nAnderson gained 112 yards on 11 carries and Fohs gained 127 yards on nine carries. \nFohs ran for 71 yards one play after Galvez’s 90-yard TD run was called back. \nThe victory improved River Valley’s record to 6-1 overall, 4-0 in section. \n“I can’t say enough about what they’re doing,” said Olvera about the Dust Devils. “They play hard; Ruckle always has a good scheme.” \nThe Dust Devils’ defense held Mohave running backs Jason Urquiza to 30 yards on 19 carries and Brown to 29 yards on six carries. \n“I think we did well,” RVHS defensive lineman Tyler Garringer said. “We stopped the run; it was hard work and preparaton all week.” \nOlvera said he told his T-birds “let’s get back to work — that’s our mantra” during his postgame speech. \nHe added: “Let’s sweep the city of Kingman.” \nThe loss dropped the AIA Division IV, Section III T-birds’ record to 2-5 overall, 2-2 in section. \nThe T-birds will play the Volunteers at Lee Wiliams High School on Friday, the Bulldogs of Kingman High School at Mohave on Oct. 23, and the Tigers at Kingman Academy on Oct. 30. \nThe Dust Devils play the Wranglers at Wickenburg High School on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T10:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:21:04.102+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
