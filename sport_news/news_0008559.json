Black is scheduled to interview on Thursday, with Gardenhire to interview next week, according to Wagner. \nDiamondbacks Triple-A manager Phil Nevin interviewed on Monday, according to the Post and other candidates include Giants bench coach Ron Wotus and former big-leaguer Alex Cora. \nBaker, 66, was fired by the Reds after the team lost in the 2013 Wild Card Game in Pittsburgh. In six seasons as the Reds’ manager, Baker went 509-463 with three playoff trips. In the two years since Baker was fired, the Reds have gone 140-184 under Bryan Price, who served as Baker’s pitching coach from 2010 to 2013.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T12:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T14:38:19.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
