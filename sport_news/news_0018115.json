But Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany and other administrators have been pushing the idea of freeing time for athletes so they could pursue more opportunities as students.\nIzzo said coaches are smart enough not to “beat a kid to death” with practice, and the NCAA limits practice time anyway. His question on trying to discourage individual time spent on sports is how that time actually would be used.\n“I don’t see surgeons worrying about their time,” Izzo said. “I don’t see musicians worrying about theirs. We give them more time, they get in trouble and then we get in trouble.”\nIzzo also said college basketball should take a few more pages from the NBA rulebook.\n>> Follow Rob Oller on Twitter during the games, become a part of  Scarlet & Gray Matter  in  The Dispatch \n“If I was the czar for the day, I’d try to get every rule like the NBA, personally,” he said.\nThe NCAA is instituting several rules changes and issued a directive to officials in an effort to speed up the pace of play.\nOne of the most notable rules changes is the reduction of the shot clock from 35 seconds to 30, a move Izzo applauds. He would not mind playing four quarters instead of two halves.\nHe just wants to see more similarities between the NCAA and NBA rules.\n“You know, I get disappointed on the committees I’m on,” Izzo said. “I think you always hear, ‘Well, you don’t want to be like the NBA.’ Why not? That’s what the kids want.”\n>> Got a question about Ohio State football?

Two months later, he left the door open to staying on beyond that — and he is keeping it there for now.\n“I haven’t made up my mind on anything other than coaching these guys,” Ryan said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T14:29:35.574+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
