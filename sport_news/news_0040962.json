The weather outlook in Amherst right now is 50 and sunny with just enough of a breeze to remind fans that we're mid-way through October. \nUMass, looking to bounce back from its bad loss to Bowling Green last week, is hoping to remind fans that their team can still win a few games here. \nKickoff is set for 3:30 p.m. There's no traditional television option this week, so I'm hoping many of you will decide to join us right here for all the action. \nBelow, you can follow along with our updating live blog as we take you through the afternoon with my real-time Twitter updates that will appear in the comment section below. \nBe sure to join in on the discussion!
