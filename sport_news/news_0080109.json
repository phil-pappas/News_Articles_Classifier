I really thought the offensive line's performance would be a key factor in the outcome because Cincinnati's defense, while pretty good, is still prone to giving up yardage, sometimes in big chunks. The thinking was that if the line could win up front, meaning open holes for LeSean McCoy, and protect EJ Manuel, the Bills might be able to extend drives, keep the Bengals offense off the field, and perhaps score enough points to win the game. However, poor field position limited what offensive coordinator Greg Roman could do as Buffalo's average drive start was it's own 15, and not once did it start a drive beyond its own 20. Further, once Sammy Watkins went down, joining Percy Harvin who didn't even dress, the passing game, already dealing with EJ Manuel's typical inaccuracy, was really hampered. \nReport card: Your turn to grade the Bills \n2. Will the Bills defense continue on an ascending path? No. In fact, it took a big step backward. This was a highly troubling performance by a unit that, no matter what Rex Ryan says, is just not very good right now. Ryan admitted he made a tactical error by not blitzing Andy Dalton more, but once upon a time, this front four used to sack quarterbacks with regularity and didn't need blitzes. Dalton is having a very nice year, but he's no Tom Brady, and the Bills should have been able to disrupt him more than they did. The secondary played very well, especially corners Stephon Gilmore and Ronald Darby. They did an outstanding job shutting down A.J. Green and Tyler Eifert, but the front seven, which was supposed to be the strength of this defense, was nowhere to be found. Did Mario Williams even play? I know Jerry Hughes did because he had another penalty. I know Kyle Williams was out there, but only because he suffered a knee injury and I saw him lying on the ground. \nUSA Today: Bills, Bengals box score \n3. What can the Bills get from their walking wounded? LeSean McCoy returned to action and had a pretty good game with 90 yards rushing and a touchdown. Sammy Watkins also scored a touchdown. And that's pretty much where the contributions ended. Watkins suffered an ankle injury while catching that touchdown pass at the end of the first half and now it looks like he'll be sidelined again. We also learned before the game that Percy Harvin's ongoing hip issue flared up and he was unable to play. He could miss more time, just like Watkins. As expected, Tyrod Taylor did not play due to his sprained knee, and his status for next week in London against Jacksonville is iffy at best. And what would a Bills game be without an injury to Marquise Goodwin, who reinjured his ribcage. Ryan admitted afterward that he's flabbergasted by the injury bug and how it has ravaged his offense, and now the epidemic is spreading. Seantrel Henderson went out with a concussion, and defensive tackle Kyle Williams suffered a knee injury. Buy Photo \nBills running back LeSean McCoy ran for 90 yards and a touchdown.

There was a new and respected coach leading the way; a raw but exciting and potentially useful quarterback taking over an offense designed by a creative coordinator; new and dynamic weapons at running back, receiver, and tight end; and a defense returning mostly intact that was coming off one of the best seasons in recent Bills history. But six weeks into 2015, nothing looks different to me. The Bills are the same old Bills that we've become accustomed to over the past 15 non-playoff seasons, a team that just can't get out of its own way. Just when you want to believe fortunes are going to change, they lose three homes games by a combined 35 points, and the point differential probably shouldn't have been that close. Buffalo's offense has been overrun by injuries, the defense is vastly underperforming, particularly the defensive line, and the special teams are downright horrible. Between the injuries, the penalties, the inconsistent play at quarterback, and a defense that suddenly can't sack a quarterback, it adds up to 3-3, and unless there's a drastic change, this team isn't going anywhere in January. Rex Ryan and the Bills players talk after their 34-21 loss to the Bengals. Video by Jeff DiVeronica. \nNumbers … \n30 - Minutes in time of possession for both teams, the first time since 1977 that has happened in a Bills game. \n12 - Times in Bills history they have played a team with a 5-0 record or better, and they are now 3-9 in those games. \n61 - Players in NFL history with 7,000 or more rushing yards, a milestone LeSean McCoy reached Sunday. Video replay: Bills, Bengals highlights \nTalking points … \nBengals coach Marvin Lewis on scoring to start the second half: \"It was good to get the ball in the third quarter and drive down. It put back the seven points after they got seven at the end of the second, so we kind of answered them right out of the locker room.\" \nBengals WR A.J. Green on the play of WR Marvin Jones: \"(Rex) didn't have an answer for him. It's good, Marvin plays his butt off and he had a great game today. We had some big plays from (Mohamed Sanu), I had a big catch for us, and we are all just clicking and Andy spreads the ball around to a lot of different guys making plays.\" \nBengals QB Andy Dalton on being 6-0: \"You look at the schedule and see the start week and the bye and this is exactly what you want to be, undefeated into the bye. We can't look back to what we've done, we have to keep doing exactly what we have been doing and keep pushing to be the best we can be.\" Sal Maiorana and Leo Roth break down the 34-21 loss to the Bengals.

Sponsored by Bengals 34, Bills 21 Oct. 18, Ralph Wilson Stadium With several injuries to the offense, the Bills (3-3) defense needed to step up. It got stepped on. Bengals (6-0) QB Andy Dalton passed for three touchdowns against a Buffalo defense that failed to sack him. EJ Manuel started for the injured Tyrod Taylor and was serviceable, throwing for 263 yards and a touchdown and rushing for another score. Buffalo is 1-3 at Ralph Wilson Stadium. The Bills should have an easier matchup next week against the 1-5 Jacksonville Jaguars in London. Bills 14, Titans 13 Oct. 11, Nissan Stadium, Nashville, Tenn. This was a laughable performance for the Bills for most of the game, but luckily, Tyrod Taylor came to the rescue. Taylor engineered two late scoring drives with the help of his running prowess and a 46-yard bomb to Chris Hogan to give Buffalo its first victory over the Titans since 2000. An ugly win if there ever was one, but a win nonetheless. Up next, the undefeated Bengals. Giants 24, Bills 10 Oct. 4, Ralph Wilson Stadium Flags, flags and more flags. The Bills couldn't stay out of trouble against Eli Manning and the Giants and sunk to .500 in defeat. Without stars LeSean McCoy and Sammy Watkins -- both sidelined with injuries -- the Bills' offense was mostly lifeless. Buffalo ran for just 55 yards (2.3 average) on 24 attempts. Bills 41, Dolphins 14 Sept. 27, Sun Life Stadium Tyrod Taylor played like a seasoned veteran, Buffalo's defense looked like the one Rex Ryan has been bragging about, and the Miami Dolphins were, well, an absolute train wreck. Add it up and the Bills embarrassed their AFC East rivals 41-14 at muggy Sun Life Stadium. Patriots 40, Bills 32 Sept. 20, Ralph Wilson Stadium The Ralph was rockin'. Then it wasn't. Then it was again. But in the end, the Patriots did what they always seem to do ... beat the Bills. Tom Brady threw for 466 yards and 3 TDs as New England dominated much of the game before allowing three fourth-quarter scores to make things interesting. Alas, on the Bills' final drive, Tyrod Taylor threw his third interception to end hopes of a miraculous comeback. Despite a lot of talk all week, the Pats proved they are still tops in the division. Bills 27, Colts 14 Sept. 13, Ralph Wilson Stadium They say it's not how you start, but how you finish. Well, \"they\" would still be quite impressed with what the Bills did in Week 1 against Andrew Luck and the Colts. Buffalo put on a show and QB Tyrod Taylor made his coaches look smart with an efficient stat line and an impressive 51-yard TD bomb to Percy Harvin to ignite the crowd. After the Bills scored on their opening drive of the second half to open up a 24-0 lead, the party was on. What's next for the Bills? Scroll ahead to look at the rest of the Bills schedule this season. Week 7 Oct. 25, 9:30 a.m. Wembley Stadium, London (Insert corny English phrase in a terrible accent.) Luckily for the Bills, they aren't the \"home\" team for this one. The Jags are regulars in England, committing to a game each year at Wembley from 2013 to 2016. Week 8 Nov. 8, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium Coming off the bye, this is the first of three key AFC East games in a row for Buffalo. The Bills have defeated the Dolphins three straight years at home and will look to extend it to four for the first time in the series' history. Week 10 Nov. 12, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday night) Met Life Stadium The Bills visit Rex Ryan's former home in their first of two primtetime games this season. They also begin a stretch of five games on the road in six weeks -- something they haven't done since 1991. Week 11 Nov. 23, 8:30 p.m. (Monday night) Gillette Stadium The Bills finally won in Foxborough last season -- the first time in 13 tries -- in the final game of the year. This game will be a Monday nighter and not since 2009 have the Bills played two prime-time games in one season. Week 12 Nov. 29, 1 p.m. Arrowhead Stadium After the Patriots game, the Bills have to turn around on short rest and travel to Kansas City. That's just as tough a task as playing a team coming off extra rest. The NFL did the Bills no favors with that one. Week 13 Dec. 6, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium J.J. Watt, arguably the best defensive player in the NFL, has a new buddy in Houston and someone with which the Bills are quite familiar. Former Patriot Vince Wilfork joined the team this offseason, signing a two-year contract. Houston defeated Buffalo, 23-17, last season. Week 14 Dec. 13, 1 p.m. Lincoln Financial Field Of course Rex returning to Met Life is a big deal. But another new Bill has this one circled on his calendar. Running back LeSean McCoy was traded to the Bills for young linebacker Kiko Alonso in the offseason and most likely wants to put on a good show for his former fans. Week 15 Dec. 20, 1 p.m. FedExField The Bills have struggled mightily in recent years, but they have had Washington's number. The Bills are 6-0 against the Redskins since 1993. Week 16 Dec. 27, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium Tony Romo is clearly among one of the better QBs the Bills face in 2015. Interestingly, Buffalo is at home in most cases where it faces an elite (or near-elite) quarterback (Brady, Romo, Luck, Manning). Week 17 Jan. 3, 1 p.m. Ralph Wilson Stadium A fitting end to the season with Rex Ryan hosting his former team at the Ralph. In the 55 years the Bills have been playing in the AFL and NFL, they have never played a slate where they start with two games at home and finish with their last two at home.
