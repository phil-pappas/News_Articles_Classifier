Up a man with moments to play. Opposition corner kick. \nThe mission: Find the opponent’s biggest heading threat and blanket him with defenders. \nMission for the Jacksonville Armada: Failed. \nNow, it’s official: 0-for-2015. \nFC Edmonton defender Mallan Roberts headed the tying goal in stoppage time, denying the Armada a first-ever road victory just before the final whistle in Sunday’s 1-1 draw at Clarke Field. \nThe draw guaranteed a winless road campaign for the Armada (5-10-4), which posted an away record of 0-12-3 in its inaugural North American Soccer League season. \nFor the Armada, the long trip home from Alberta will sting. \n“We didn’t finish off what we wanted to finish off,” interim coach Eric Dade said. “We should’ve been able to manage this one.” \nEverything was in place: A goal advantage, a man advantage and an opponent that looked lifeless and dispirited. \nJacksonville had taken a 77th-minute lead when Jemal Johnson’s low shot deflected off the knee of Edmonton captain Albert Watson, the first own goal in favor of the Armada. \nEdmonton had played 25 minutes down a man after a red card to midfielder Ritchie Jones, and had managed just one shot on target against Armada keeper David Sierra before Roberts’ goal. \nIt wasn’t enough. \n“You think you’ve got the game in hand at that point,” Dade said. \nWinter had come early for both teams’ playoff hopes — both the Armada and Edmonton (7-8-5) had been eliminated from playoff contention last week. \nThe first half was a grim defensive struggle largely devoid of scoring chances, apart from a pair of shots by Johnson, one saved by Edmonton goalkeeper Tyson Farago and one over the crossbar, and a long-range effort from Shawn Nicklaw. \nAfter halftime, the Armada picked up the pace but stayed scoreless. Jaime Castrillon forced Farago into a save with a close-range header just after halftime, and Tommy Krizanovic volleyed narrowly high from Johnson’s second-half cross. \n“We created some chances that I wish we could have gone back and put away,” Dade said. \nThe game seemed to turn with the ejection of Jones for a wild kick into the midsection of Akeil Barrett. \nTwelve minutes later, Johnson streaked up the left side into the penalty area, and his acute-angle shot ricocheted off the knee of Edmonton captain Watson and past Farago. \nBut after earning its lead, the Armada couldn’t hold it.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:28:06.943+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
