The next thing you know, the state tournament will be here and anything can happen.\" \nBoth teams turned to big hits and traded point for point at the outset. Elleson Dunigan's fifth kill pulled Heritage (14-10-1, 5-8) into a 12-12 tie, but that's when Bentonville decided to switch things around and try to find holes in the Lady War Eagles' defense. \nThe strategy worked as Emma Palasak's kill broke the tie and led to an 8-1 Lady Tiger run. Back-to-back errors on Heritage gave Bentonville a 20-13 cushion, which was good enough to hold on to win the first set. \n\"That first game, Heritage definitely came out with a lot more energy and intensity than when we were at their place,\" Smith said. \"I congratulated our girls after that first set for keeping their cool and plugging away, point after point. \n\"We could have became flustered early on, but we didn't. Once we started playing smarter and finding the holes, it became a lot easier and less work. It was playing smarter: changing the speed of the ball, then putting the heat on again. Usually it's one or two players leading, but everybody was hitting very well with high percentages.\" \nBentonville took control of the second set with eight straight points, and another Palasak tip for a kill gave the Lady Tigers a 13-5 lead which eventually grew into a double-digit margin. The Lady Tigers did it again in the third set as they went on a 12-2 run and owned a 15-5 cushion after Emma Bruce's ace. \n\"The second and third games, in particularly, is where we got down in serve receive,\" Heritage coach Sarah Miser said. \"Bentonville serves so aggressively, and our girls were passing the ball straight up in the back row. All you can do with that is set up the back row or free-ball it over. \n\"We were definitely running more out-of-system plays, and that makes a huge difference for our offense. Our hitters are having to hit sets over their shoulder.\" \nPalasak had 13 kills to lead Bentonville, while Sadie Pate had 12 kills, 11 digs and 4 aces and Tymber Riley added eight kills. Kayton Coffee contributed 45 assists, while Savannah King chipped in 30 digs. \nDunigan paced Heritage with 17 kills and 12 digs, while CJ Landrum had eight kills. Ally Darter and Lindsay Glynn chipped in 12 and 11 digs, respectively. \nSports on 10/16/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:08:10.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
