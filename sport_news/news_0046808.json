Two potent offences and a hitter-friendly park in the Rogers Centre could make for some excitement when the Toronto Blue Jays host the Texas Rangers in the American League Division Series. THE CANADIAN PRESS/AP/LM Otero \nBoth teams rode second-half surges to the playoffs, with Toronto reloading at the trade deadline.\nToronto (93-69) was 45-46 at the all-star-break then kicked in the after-burners to go 48-23. That includes a 1-4 end to the season after clinching its division.\nTexas (88-74) won 14 of its last 21 games, and went 46-28 after the all-star break.\nToronto and Texas boasted the most potent offences after the all-streak break, with the Jays topping the majors at 405 runs and the Rangers second at 381.\nUnlike the Jays, the Rangers have plenty of recent post-season experience having won the AL West three of the last six years. But Texas ranked last in the American League with a 67-95 record in 2014.\nThe Rangers are the fifth team in MLB history and the second AL team to make the playoffs after finishing in the league basement the previous year.\nThe Jays bring a big bat to the post-season.\nToronto led the majors in runs scored (891), home runs (232), on-base percentage (.340) and slugging percentage (.457) and ranked second in batting average (.270).\nTexas ranked third in runs (751), 11th in home runs (172), sixth in on-base percentage (.325), ninth in slugging percentage (.413) and 10th in batting average (.257).\nPrince Fielder, Mitch Moreland, and Shin-Soo Choo led the Texas attack with a combined 68 homers and 265 RBIs. Josh Donaldson, Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion powered the Toronto offence with a combined 120 home runs and 348 RBIs.\nBoth teams were farther down the pitching stats.\nToronto was 12th in the majors in earned-run average (3.80) and 11th in opponents' batting average (.248)\nTexas was 23rd in ERA (4.24) and 24th in opponents' batting average (.262).\nHome-field advantage helps the Jays, who were 53-28 at the Rogers Centre this year and 40-41 on the road. But the Rangers fared well away from home with a 45-36 mark while they were 43-38 at Globe Life Park.\nFollow @NeilMDavidson on Twitter\nReport Error Submit a Tip Refund Refund", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T13:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T19:36:27.790+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
