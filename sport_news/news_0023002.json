That leaves more of the onus on edge rushing on Leonard Floyd, Davin Bellamy, Lorenzo Carter and Chuks Amaechi. \nSanders on Monday called his sack “pretty fun. I actually felt like Floyd when I came up. It was a good play.” \nThe sophomore nearly had another sack late in the second quarter but jumped and grazed Josh Dobbs on the helmet instead. \n“I kind of felt like he was going to pump fake me, but I adjusted wrong and jumped up in the air,” he said. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T02:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T06:54:42.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
