(Richard Skinner) -- A change in attitude toward playing rival Washington & Jefferson and perhaps a change in venue helped the Thomas More College football team take a huge step toward ending a three-year NCAA Division III playoff drought and maybe setting up a special season. \nThomas More rallied from two first-quarter deficits after not allowing a single first-half point in its first four games to defeat W & J, 38-20, on Saturday afternoon at BB&T Field. \nThe win improved Thomas More to 5-0 overall and 3-0 in the Presidents' Athletic Conference and gave it a leg up toward earning the league's automatic bid to the NCAA Division III playoffs. It also improved the Saints' record to 37-2 at BB&T Field since beginning play there in 2008. \nBoth teams entered the game ranked in the top 14 of the two NCAA Division III national polls: Thomas More was 12th in the D3football.com Top 25 and W & J was 13th, while W & J (now 3-1, 1-1 PAC) was 13th in the American Football Coaches Association top 25 and Thomas More was 14th. \nThomas More tied W & J for the league title each of the last two seasons, but lost the automatic bid in a tiebreaker, because the Saints' lone league loss each season came at W & J. \nFirst-year Thomas More head coach Regis Scaife said he heard about the importance of the W & J game from the first day he was hired on Feb. 17, and after embracing that conversation for awhile made sure it all stopped when practice began in August. \n\"I have to be honest, we thought about it from day one,\" said Scaife, who brought 19 seasons of experience as a head coach with him when he was hired, including leading John Carroll to the 2002 NCAA Division III semifinals. \"When I got here this winter that's all they talked about, so we marked it on the calendar, but once we got going we didn't even talk about it. We knew the stakes. The winner of this game is in good shape. You have to win out, but you have to win this game to have a shot at postseason.\" \nSenior safety Kyle Fuller, who had a fourth-quarter interception, one of four by Thomas More in the game, said the players put a lot of pressure on themselves the last couple of years heading into the W & J game. \n\"Playing at their place is hard, just like it is playing at our place, and we put a lot of pressure on ourselves focusing on that game that we went in there thinking we had to be perfect instead of going out and doing what we do,\" said Fuller. \"It's a rival game. and the past couple of years we put a lot of focus on this game, probably too much.\" \nMaybe that's why the Saints were minus-two in turnover differential in the 45-21 loss in 2013 and minus-five last season when they lost 51-28. \nThomas More hasn't been to the playoffs since 2011, which marked the third time in a four-year span it had done so under former head coach Jim Hilvert, who left after the 2014 season to become head coach at LaSalle High School. The Saints compiled a 24-6 record over the last three seasons, including a 9-1 mark in 2013 and 8-2 record last season, but failed to earn an at-large playoff bid in that span. \n\"This is a huge step,\" said senior wide receiver Goose Cohorn, who had two touchdown receptions, both in the first half, and finished with five catches for 90 yards. \"This is first year since I've been here we've started 5-0. We've always suffered a loss that kind of set us back.\" \nIt now has two wins over teams that were ranked in the top 25 at the time they played. A season-opening 48-0 thumping of then No. 19 St. John Fisher was the other. \nSaturday's win actually Thomas More's smallest margin of victory and it has now won its first five games by an average score of 55.0 to 10.6. This is a team that appears to have it all: a rock-solid defense that bent, but didn't break against an offense that entered the game averaging 43.0 points per game; a passing game that compiled 219 yards and three touchdowns and a running attack that had 220 yards and averaged 5.0 yards per carry. \nIt has also shown plenty of depth throughout the season with seven different players having rushed for a touchdown and nine different players with a receiving touchdown. It also survived losing starting quarterback Jensen Gebhardt to an injury early in the third quarter that knocked him out of the game. He had thrown three touchdown passes in the first half, but replacement Brenan Kuntz came off the bench to throw a couple of key completions and run for 32 yards on four carries. Kuntz started the second game of the season in place of an injured Gebhardt and completed 13 of 16 passes for 228 yards and three touchdowns in an 84-7 win at Hanover. \n\"It's definitely fun for me,\" said offensive coordinator Trevor Stellman, who was a standout quarterback for Thomas More from 2005-09. \"We can do multiple things and that's crucial for us. In the past we've been a little hamstrung with what we were capable of doing. We were a run first team and this year it's been nice to be able to throw the ball around a little. We have so many weapons. I think a lot of D3 schools struggle when you have your second quarterback in, because you have to tailor it more to what he's good at. The nice thing is we have two quarterbacks that are both really good at running our offense. It's scary for opposing defenses and a nice hidden gem for us.\" \nThomas More still has five conference games remaining, including at Saint Vincent (3-2 overall, 2-1 PAC) and the regular-season finale at Case Western Reserve (3-1, 3-0) on Nov. 7, but Saturday's win sets this season up to be a special one after it started in a tragic way with the death of player Mitch Kramer in an ATV accident on Aug. 17. \n\"We know he's with us and he's looking down on us,\" said Cohorn. \"I think it's going to be a special year for us. I felt that way before today and feel that way even more now.\" \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
