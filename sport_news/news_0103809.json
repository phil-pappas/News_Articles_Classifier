Then Emmaus superstar Meredith Sholder finally settled the issue with a goal 2:30 into the overtime period to give the Green Hornets the EPC title with a 1-0 victory. \nA large crowd – by field hockey standards anyway – gathered at Whitehall High School to witness the matchup between the two top teams in District 11 and two of the best in the state. \nRELATED : Emmaus' Meredith Sholder makes the most of second opportunity \nFans from both schools were vocal the entire game, frequently stomping their feet on the metal bleachers whenever their respective team did something positive. \n“It was a great game, back and forth,” Emmaus coach Sue Butz-Stavin said. “Both teams battled and worked hard. This game could have gone either way.” \nStroudsburg coach Jennifer Lobasso said it was unfortunate the teams didn’t play each other during the regular season. \n“We learned a lot from this game,” Lobasso said. “You can watch film all you want but, unfortunately, if you don’t actually play somebody you don’t know exactly what to expect. I’m excited to play them again (in the District 11 playoffs) because now that we’ve seen them I think we’ll come up with a really good game plan.” \nEmmaus and Stroudsburg will be the top two seeds in the District 11 Class AAA tournament. Of course, there’s no guarantee the two teams will advance all the way to the title game. \n“Anything can happen in districts,” Butz-Stavin said, “but it would be great to play Stroudsburg again.” \nEmmaus and Stroudsburg played two tight games last season. The Mountaineers won 1-0 in the EPC title game before Emmaus bounced back to win 2-0 in the District 11 championship contest. \nSholder, a University of North Carolina recruit, expected another great battle from the Mountaineers on Thursday. \n“(Stroudsburg) was really good last year,” Sholder said, “and I’m pretty sure they have nine starters back from that team. I knew it would be a great game. They’ve definitely improved but we’re a better team, too.” \nLobasso was apprehensive when the game went into the 7-on-7 overtime. \n“Seven-on-7 is tricky,” Lobasso said. “Anything can happen when you’re playing in space.” \nRegardless of the outcome, it was a great effort by both teams and the crowd’s enthusiasm only made the play on the field even more breathtaking. \n“I think we put up a great fight,” Strodsburg goalkeeper Morgan Dempsey said. “It was a great game, just like last year. It’s one of the best games I’ve ever played in. I think the teams are evenly matched, and we could wind up seeing them in districts again.” \nTom Hinkel may be reached at thinkel@lehighvalleylive.com . Follow him on Twitter @TomHinkelLV .
