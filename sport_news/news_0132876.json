His franchise-record home winning streak is actually 16 games after he won his last home start of 2014, and his ERA in Houston is the lowest home ERA in the AL since former Astro Nolan Ryan had a 1.07 ERA in 1972. \nRoyals manager Ned Yost is well acquainted with Keuchel and his work. He must think a lot of him, since as manager of the AL All-Star Game he named the 27-year-old his starter. Yost was also asked why he thinks Keuchel has been so dominant in Houston. \n\"He’s just good,\" Yost said. \"I mean, he’s just good. But you look at his home and away record, there’s quite a big difference in that. But ... he just pitches good here. And sometimes there’s just no reason for it.\" \nThough the Astros have already played three postseason games, suiting up for the first one at home adds a little something extra to Sunday’s game. \n\"That means a lot to me not only because I’m trying to get myself better, but the Astros as a whole and the city of Houston mean the world to me,\" Keuchel said. \"I was drafted by them and I was in the minor leagues with them. So I give everything I possibly can, and I know they are appreciative of that. And anything we can do to bring the city together, we’ll do.\" © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T18:23:25.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
