A 53-year-old Oregon mom will spend a month in custody for stuffing tampons with meth and oxycodone to give to her jailed daughter, according to reports.\nElizabeth Kay Sparkman pleaded guilty last month to contraband charges after she was busted trying to handoff the care package to her daughter, Brandi Lynn Miller, in March.\nThe Oregonian reported that the two conspired over a series of phone calls before Sparkman packed the drugs into two tampon applicators and taped them to the back of the toilet in a Gresham dental office, where her daughter was to be transported for an appointment.\nFate foiled the duo’s plans, though, when the care package came unraveled and sheriff’s deputies discovered the drugs on the bathroom floor.\nThe mother-daughter smuggling team planned to do it again three days later, but when Sparkman arrived at the drop spot — another dental office — deputies were ready and waiting.\nSparkman fessed up and was arrested with a one-tampon care package containing a gram of meth and 18 oxycodone pills.\nDavid Paul Morris/Bloomberg The mother and daughter smuggling team tried used tampon applicators to hide drugs. Deputy District Attorney for Multnomah County Glen Banfield told the paper he’d never seen a parent smuggle in drugs to their kids.\n\"I've seen boyfriends and girlfriends, and husbands and wives, but even that wasn't that frequent,” he said.\nSparkman’s plea deal included a 30-day sentence that she’ll be allowed to serve in an inpatient substance abuse program.\nFor her part, Miller was sentenced to eight months for both the smuggling scheme with her mom and a separate incident in which she was caught with a cup of meth hidden in her crotch.\nMiller was also hit with four years in prison for the original identity theft charges.\nkblakinger@nydailynews.com\nRelated Stories High on dust cleaner, Conn. man arrested for biting cop Pa. mom accused of shooting up daughter, friend with heroin High on spice, Alaska woman strips naked and destroys Subway D.C. mayor staffer arrested after coke found in toilet", "external_links": ["http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2015/10/gresham_mom_leaves_care_packag.html"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T21:41:51.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
