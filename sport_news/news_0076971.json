(Photo: Stephen Hayne) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nSeahawks coach Pete Carroll said the team will lift the suspension on player Derrick Coleman. \n\"We really don't have a lot of information - or any information - about what's going on or the issues. We've not received stuff other than to know the basics and the fundamentals of it. So we will do that and move from there,\" Carroll said during a Monday Seahawks news conference. \nCarroll said Coleman still has to clear the doctors' reports. \n\"He still has not been able to see our doctors because he's been on suspension. He's seen other doctors,\" said Carroll. \nColeman was arrested last week following a crash in Bellevue that injured a man. Coleman is being investigated for vehicular assault and felony hit-and-run. The investigation into the incident, including full toxicology test results, was expected to take at least a month.
