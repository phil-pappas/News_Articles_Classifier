The hospital follows the globally accepted Tanner Whithouse 3 (TW-3) method which apparently has an accuracy rate of around plus or minus six months. \n\nAsked whether this would be the norm in future, SAI director-general Injeti Srinivas replied in the affirmative. \"We plan to extend such tests o all sports as soon as possible,\" he said. SAI was emboldened by a recent ruling by the Delhi High Court, which refused to interfere with the bone age determination method adopted by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) to ascertain age of players in the U-16 category. \n\nThe court had pointed out on September 22 that BCCI couldn't be expected to have a method to verify the genuineness of documents given as proof of age by players and said the tests were conducted to \"avoid discrimination between players and to ensure a level playing field in age group tournaments\".
