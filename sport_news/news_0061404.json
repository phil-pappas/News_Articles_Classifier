(AP Photo) Comments \nCHICAGO -- The \"magic\" number for the Detroit Tigers to finish the season in last place is down to one. \nAlfredo Simon pitched a complete game Friday night, but the Tigers struggled to string hits together against left-hander Chris Sale on their way to a 2-1 loss to the Chicago White Sox. \nThe Tigers now trail the White Sox by 1 1/2 games with two games remaining. A loss Saturday or Sunday would give the Tigers their first last-place finish in the Central Division since 2008. The Tigers went 74-88 in 2008. They are 73-86 with two games remaining this season. \nJefry Marte homered off Sale in the second inning to give the Tigers an early lead, but that's all the offense the Tigers mustered against Sale and a pair of relievers. \nSimon (13-12) scattered five hits and one walk in eight innings of work in what likely was his final appearance with the Tigers. He will be a free agent this offseason. \nTigers' highlights • Marte put the Tigers on top early when he smacked a 1-1 fastball from Sale over the wall in left field to lead off the second inning. That gave the Tigers a 1-0 lead. \n• Simon got out of a jam in the sixth inning with his team still trailing by one. Simon hit Adam Eaton with a pitch, then allowed an Alexei Ramirez single to put two on with nobody out. But he then got the 3-4-5 hitters in order to strand the two runners. \n• Shortstop Dixon Machado made a very nice defensive play on a ball hit to the hole by Melky Cabrera for the final out of the eighth inning. \nTigers' lowlights • The White Sox took the lead in the third. Simon surrendered a single to Carlos Sanchez, then hit Tyler Saladino with a pitch before Eaton doubled home both runs. That gave the White Sox a 2-1 lead. \n• White Sox right fielder J.B. Shuck made a spectacular diving catch on the warning track to steal an extra-base hit from Machado in the seventh inning. \n• The Tigers had two on and nobody out and then runners at first and third with one out in the eighth but could not capitalize. \nGame notes • Sale entered the game two strikeouts short of tying the franchise record for strikeouts in a season. It didn't take him long to pass Ed Walsh, who previously held the record with 269 strikeouts in 1908. Sale struck out two in the first inning to tie the record. He recorded his 270th strikeout when he got James McCann to look at a called third strike for the first out of the second inning. \n• Sale finished with seven strikeouts in the game and 274 for the season. His line: 7IP, 5H, 1R, 1ER, 1BB, 7SO. Sale threw 95 pitches, 60 for strikes. \n• Simon's line: 8IP, 5H, 2R, 2ER, 1BB, 1SO. He hit two batters with pitches and was charged with two wild pitches. \n• The Tigers did not have Victor Martinez, Miguel Cabrera or Ian Kinsler in the starting lineup. Martinez is still battling a left quad issue and was not available to play. Cabrera and Kinsler were simply given a day off.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T07:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T07:52:25.257+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
