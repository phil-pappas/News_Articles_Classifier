That's good. (Video via ESPN )\nSo good, in fact, some people think he should go straight to the NFL. The only problem â€” the NFL won't draft players until after their junior year. (Video via Sports Illustrated )\nSome have suggested Fournette should sit out his junior year to avoid injury and ensure a high draft pick, while others think he should challenge the NFL's rule and try and enter the draft early. But those might not be such good ideas.\nThere was similar talk about South Carolina's All-American defensive end Jadaveon Clowney. He played his junior year and was drafted first overall by the Houston Texans.\nHe couldn't avoid injury for long, though. Once he got to the pros, he played less than half a game in his first season after undergoing knee surgery.\nAs for the legal route, Fournette wouldn't be the first high profile running back to try to get to the pros early.\nOhio State's Maurice Clarett attempt to sue his way into the league in 2004 but lost his case. After showing up to the 2005 combine slower and overweight, he fell to the third round of the draft and fizzled out of the league.\nBut LSU head coach Les Miles isn't worried about the speculation about Fournette and said he's confident his workhorse running back will return for his junior year. (Video via Sports Illustrated )\n\"To me, there's a lot of people out there stirring the pot... I can't imagine that Leonard would be sitting anywhere inactive for a fall,\" Miles said.\nAnd don't worry Tiger fans. Fournette himself tweeted, \"I will never jump ship... I'm drowning with my brothers.\"\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRR7myrZDwE", "https://twitter.com/_fournette/status/649055804700667907", "http://espn.go.com/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9-xoHJI0Qg", "http://www.si.com/"], "published": "2015-10-02T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:29:43.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
