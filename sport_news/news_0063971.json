(Peter Schmuck) \n“We really wanted to win this one, so it's going to be tough to swallow,” said running back Brandon Ross, who rushed for 58 yards and a touchdown. “Definitely no moral victories. Frustration, knowing we let one get away. They were trying to give us the game, ever since the first quarter. They were just making mistake after mistake — or we were forcing mistakes — but we didn't capitalize on them.” \nThe Maryland defense clamped down on a Penn State rushing attack that had been the engine of the Nittany Lions offense over the previous few weeks. Running back Saquon Barkley had three 100-yard games entering Saturday, but the Terps (2-5, 0-3 Big Ten) held him to 65 yards and a score on 20 carries and forced him to fumble twice. The Nittany Lions (6-2, 3-1) finished the game with 48 yards rushing on 31 attempts. \nThe Terps also took advantage of Penn State's porous pass protection, to accumulate four sacks . Hackenberg completed only 13 of 29 passes, but he passed for 315 yards and three touchdowns. The Maryland secondary was unable to lock down wide receivers Chris Godwin (four catches, 135 yards, one touchdown) and DaeSean Hamilton (five catches, 96 yards, one touchdown). \nPhotos of the Maryland football team during the 2015 season. \nSo the Terps trudged into the locker room knowing they'd been so close to locking down a win over the Nittany Lions. \n“It was just a dull, dull moment because a lot of guys, we just went out and played our butts off,” said defensive end Yannick Ngakoue, who had two sacks. “Unfortunately, the score was what it was, so there's a lot of disappointment.” \nWhat was expected to be a defensive battle turned into a seesaw contest down the stretch, with each team countering the other's blows. Penn State took a 17-13 lead into halftime, but the Terps came out in the second half and took the lead back on a 10-yard touchdown run by Ross. Hackenberg hit Hamilton for a 20-yard score before Maryland took the lead back late in the third quarter on Hills' 10-yard pass to wide receiver DeAndre Lane (Catonsville), his first career score. \nAgain, Hackenberg responded, this time with a 27-yard pass to wide receiver Geno Lewis. Maryland kicker Brad Craddock kicked his third field goal of the game to cut the lead to 31-30 with 10 minutes, 15 seconds remaining in the game. \nThere was plenty of time for Maryland to put together one last drive for a score, but the Penn State defense held fast. The Terps' final four drives ended in a fumble, an interception, on downs and, finally, an interception. \n“The mark of a good team is a team that doesn't beat itself,” Locksley said. \nIn his less than two weeks at the helm, Locksley worked at getting the Terps past both the emotional and physical struggles of the season's first six games. He has installed an offense that plays to Hills' strengths and has been effective against Penn State and Ohio State in consecutive games. But most of all, he got Maryland to a point where it's playing free and loose. He has rejuvenated the Terps for the season's home stretch. \nBut it wasn't enough against Penn State. \n“We were all riled up,” Hills said. “We were ready to go. Everyone had a lot of energy, a lot of passion for this game. Just let it slip away.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T15:18:42.836+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
