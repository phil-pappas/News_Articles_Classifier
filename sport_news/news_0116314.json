It will be fair to take a look at them,” he told the Joy Sports Track on Monday, \n“Fameyeh’s exploits have informed us there are a lot of talents in the first division. Yes, take a look at the Premier Division but it will be fair to take a look at the Division One League as well.” \nAkunnour led his side to top Zone 3 of the Division One League to ensure that they gained promotion to the Premier Division. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
