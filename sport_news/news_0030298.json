The Rebels (6-1) have lost two running backs to season-ending knee injuries — Christian Romines in the offseason and Devante Patrick in Week 5.\nStill, the reigning Class 5A state champions took their only lead when it mattered most on Friday, overcoming a start delayed 1 hours, 45 minutes because of inclement weather to hand No. 3 Farragut (6-1) its first loss of the season.\n“Our kids persevered,” Harig said. “They showed toughness. It wasn’t the best of conditions. We did just enough on offense, and our defense was lights out. It just goes to prove that this staff and this program, it ain’t going anywhere.”\nFarragut led 7-6 at halftime, but threatened to take a commanding lead early.\nTanner Thomas (28 carries, 131 yards) broke an 18-yard TD run on the game’s opening possession, and West’s first offensive play from scrimmage was intercepted by Justin Kirkendall at midfield. The Admirals rolled up 173 yards in the first half, and outgained West 260-194 overall, but 86 came on their first two drives. K.J. Jefferson scored West’s lone touchdown on a 2-yard TD run in the second quarter, and Decosio Clark, Juan Davis and Hayden Shymlock each intercepted Farragut quarterback Jacob Naumoff to help the Rebels stay in contention.\nFarragut also doomed itself with late penalties.\nThe Admirals jumped offside to give West a first down on fourth-and-three on the game-defining drive, and a pass interference penalty gave the Rebels the ball at the Farragut 10-yard line during the final minute.\nBergstroem’s kick came three plays later.\n“I was shaking, but I know my guys on the line, they had me,” he said. “I knew I was going to make it.”\nStill, a pair of West penalties gave Farragut a last-ditch and untimed try at a field goal to win it, but Carter Phillipy’s 45-yard attempt fell short.\n“We couldn’t get much push the second half,” Farragut coach Eddie Courtney said. “Too many holding penalties. We even had a chance to kick a field goal and win it at the end. But we’ll be all right.”\nChris Thomas covers high school sports.
