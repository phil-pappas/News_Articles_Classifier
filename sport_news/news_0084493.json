Indiana is 5-0 in elimination games this postseason and 9-2 since the 2012 playoffs, when it beat Minnesota for its lone title. \nGame 5 is Wednesday night in Minnesota. \nTrailing, 38-36, early in the third quarter, Indiana took control with a 13-2 run. Johnson scored the final four points of the burst. \nIndiana led, 51-44, before Coleman scored five straight, including a three-pointer that gave the Fever the biggest lead of the series for either team at 58-44. That was the Fever’s only basket in a nine-minute stretch. Indiana had just one basket in the final quarter allowing Minnesota to rally within four behind Maya Moore, but the Lynx could get no closer. \nThe Fever had just one basket in the fourth quarter: a jumper by Johnson with 2:39 left that ended the long field goal drought and gave them some breathing room. They hit 15 free throws in the quarter to maintain their lead. \nMoore, who hit the buzzer-beater to win Game 3, led Minnesota with 20 points. Lindsay Whalen added 16. \nThis is the first WNBA Finals to go five games since 2009, when the Fever lost to Phoenix. Minnesota is trying to win its third title in five seasons. Only the Houston Comets won more in a similar stretch as they took the first four WNBA championships. \nThe Lynx won their previous two titles on the road in Atlanta in 2011 and 2013. Now they’ll have a chance to win one in front of their home fans. \nIndiana was able to take advantage of foul trouble to Minnesota center Sylvia Fowles. She only played five minutes in the first half because of three fouls. She picked up her fourth early in the third and that’s when the Fever went on their game-changing run. \nThe series had been tight through the first three games with neither team building more than a 10-point lead since early in the first quarter of Game 2. Only 15 points total separated the teams in the first three games. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T11:27:40.053+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
