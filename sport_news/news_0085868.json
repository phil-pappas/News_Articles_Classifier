The results will be available in several months.\nSash was found dead in his Oskaloosa, Iowa home Sept. 8 . The autopsy determined the death was from an “accidental mixed drug toxicity involving methadone and hydrocordone.”\nSash was a standout safety at Iowa and won a Super Bowl with the New York Giants in 2012.\n  new york giants ,  overdoses ,  tyler sash", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T14:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:27:34.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
