He'll start again this week against Florida. (Source: AP/ L.G. Patterson) \n(RNN) - We all need some ball to watch on TV this weekend after a week packed with awful news. Don't you wish you could invite poor John Boehner and Kevin McCarthy and Steve Spurrier over to the house to have a few barley pops and chicken wings so they could just chill and forget for a while the daunting challenges of this cruel, uncaring world? \nBut Boehner and McCarthy are probably working, since the House of Representatives is a bigger mess than my house after that New Year's Eve party the year Mike Tankersley set the piano on fire then dropped the chain saw. \nAnd Spurrier has to fly to Baton Rouge, LA, to directly confront the daunting cares of his cruel world, which this week take the form of Leonard Fournette and his band of trained killers. \nBe glad you're you, turn on the TV and fade away into the soothing forgetfulness that a day of ball can bring. New Mexico State at Ole Miss Noon, ET, SECN \nNew Mexico, 0-4, is to be sacrificed on the altar of Rebel rage after last week’s humiliation at Florida. Good viewing if you’re in the mood to see somebody get hurt. South Carolina at LSU 3:30 p.m., ESPN \nSteve Spurrier can’t catch a break. \nSouth Carolina was at least going to get to play at home against the all-destroying Leonard Fournette and his swarm of murderous Swamp Tigers. \nThen there came a terrible flood, more awful news from this week that just makes you sick. \nSo now the Gamecocks have to go to Baton Rouge and play in Death Valley, which is called that for a reason. At least it’s not at night. 10 ways LSU is making South Carolina feel at home http://t.co/jgSadJT550 pic.twitter.com/OY61ZczCzK — The LSU Logo (@LSU_Logo) October 9, 2015 \nLSU has been really great about all this - they sent the team plane to Columbia to pick the Gamecocks up, the LSU band's going to play the USC fight song before the game and they're going to play that same crazy techno music they blast over the PA before kickoff at Williams-Brice Stadium. They're going to give all the money after expenses to the visitors, since it was supposed to be their home game. \nPlease, Coach Miles, in the spirit of brotherhood, go the extra mile and pull Leonard the second you have a comfortable lead. Troy at Mississippi State 3 p.m. ET, SECN \nThrow some Sun Belt Conference meat to the furious Bulldogs, who got throttled last week by Texas A&M and looked pitiful doing it. \nYou might want to pass on this one. Dak Prescott will on Troy. Georgia at Tennessee 3:30 p.m. ET, CBS \nAh, at last we get some some real drama, desperation, pain and bitter struggle: The Hot Seat Bowl, live from Rocky Top. \nThe “rebuilding” card is no longer in Butch Jones’ deck since he played the ink off it the last three years. After three appalling losses caused by three incomprehensible fourth-quarter collapses, it would be a good idea to win a few or Butch'll be a good trivia question in 10 years or so. Geez, can the #utvols please just not collapse n every 2nd half to win a game?? #utvsark Do they need a new coach? New players?? — Dr. Norwood (@doc_norwood) October 4, 2015 \nBut now here comes Georgia, dragging week-old shame into Neyland Stadium like a ball and chain. \nGeorgia’s Mark Richt assumed his usual position under the gun after another big-game catastrophe. This time, it was Alabama starring as the rider on the pale horse galloping into Athens to deliver an Armageddon-level shipment of pain. At this point I seriously think that #MarkRicht & the #Bulldogs have the \"wah wah\" horn guy on retainer. — Harold Woodley (@HHW3) October 3, 2015 \nA win against Tennessee could keep alive the Dawg hope of avoiding yet another trip to the Citrus Bowl. A loss, and Twitter #MarkRicht will burn like Gen. William T. Sherman was back on the job. Arkansas at Alabama 7 p.m. ET, ESPN \nThis clash makes excellent TV that presents a conundrum for the multitude of Bama and Hog hate watchers out there. \nWho do you hate more, haters? Alabama for perpetual winning and gloating fans, or Arkansas coach Bret Bielema's snarky smack talk? \nThese two teams operate under the same business model – run and stop the run. Which team does it better? You tell me. \nAlabama last week victimized Georgia as a savage reminder that it’s still Alabama, destroyer of worlds, loaded with more talent than anybody, and now with a competent quarterback – maybe, we’ll see. \nMeanwhile, Arkansas got out-choked by Tennessee, and now with an SEC road win, those Hogs are again riding high, with their power running game, giant OL and big, tough defense. Alex Collins has 150 yards in each of the last three games and he's The Man. I wonder which team will out-lose the other. #Tennessee #Arkansas #Bielema — Ryan P. Sweeney (@Pblah_Cweehebl) October 4, 2015 \nBut Alabama’s good at stopping power running games, as Nick Chubb learned last week, even with that decorative 83-yard run for a meaningless touchdown to preserve his 13-game streak of running for 100 yards. \nMaybe Arkansas is capable of putting up a fight, and maybe even capable of an upset. \nBut imagine Bielema’s woofing if he did beat Bama in Tuscaloosa. Would it be worth it? \nDiscuss. 7:30 p.m. ET, ESPN \nBest game this week: \nMissouri got a fresh performance last week out of fresh-faced freshman quarterback Drew Lock, who threw for 136 yards and a couple of touchdowns in a 24-10 rout of poor South Carolina. \nHe replaced the flaky Maty Mauk, whose absence was not felt during his indefinite suspension, which continues into this week. And why not keep him suspended for as long as you like? \nThe offense was awful with him and looked right sparky without him. The defense was pretty good anyhow. \nMuch will depend on the accuracy of young Lock’s passing. Because running against Florida is no easy thing, especially considering Russell Hansborough’s gimpy ankle. \nThe undefeated Gator horde looked SEC contender-ish as it maliciously dismantled No. 3 Ole Miss, conqueror of Alabama in an early season fluke. \nQuarterback Will Grier is smoothing out after early bumps, and the defense befuddled Mississippi’s usually explosive offense, which let's face it is better than Missouri’s. A lot better. \nAt first glance, you might think the Gators are the sexy turnaround team right now and have that fever, are hot and can’t be stopped. #Gators Have Ample Motivation for SEC East Showdown at Missouri STORY: http://t.co/qEfBoP2ikF pic.twitter.com/En2bkm5yyD — Gators Football (@GatorsFB) October 9, 2015 \nThen again, Missouri almost always wins at home and has sidled its way into two straight SEC East championships by winning games exactly like this one. \nCopyright 2015 RNN.
