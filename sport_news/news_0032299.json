Showing off the coveted #1 plate for the first time on home ground in Japan since winning both World Championships in 2014, the team had a busy day on a track where it is unbeaten since WEC returned to Fuji Speedway in 2012. The #1 TS040 HYBRID of Anthony Davidson, Sébastien Buemi and Kazuki Nakajima finished both sessions in fifth place, with a best lap time 0.23seconds faster than their pole position time of last year. Alex Wurz, Stéphane Sarrazin and Mike Conway were close behind, recording the sixth fastest time in each session as the TS040 HYBRIDs clocked up 168 laps for a combined total of 766km. The track action began shortly before lunchtime with the first of two 90-minute practice sessions, giving all drivers the chance to reacquaint themselves with the 4.563km Fuji Speedway. While the weather forecast hints at rain during the weekend, practice began under blue skies with air temperatures of 21°C; perfect conditions to work on set-up comparisons. The Fuji lay-out is familiar to all six TOYOTA drivers, although Mikes only previous visit came in 2013 when he finished second in the LMP2 category. Mike got his chance at the wheel of a TS040 HYBRID in the final 20 minutes of the session. Fuji features the longest straight in WEC, at 1.475km, along with a mix of high and low speed corners, which makes finding the correct set-up particularly challenging, so the team had a busy day to analyse mechanical and aerodynamic set-ups. Along with comparisons of the two compounds of Michelin dry tyre, that set-up work continued in the afternoon session, which was interrupted briefly by a red flag. Tomorrow sees final practice (09.50) and qualifying (14.10) while the race starts on Sunday at 11.00 local time. TS040 HYBRID #1 (Anthony Davidson, Sébastien Buemi, Kazuki Nakajima) Free practice 1: 5th (1min 26.633secs), 32 laps Free practice 2: 5th (1min 26.242secs), 45 laps Anthony Davidson: It was quite an encouraging day in terms of how we worked through the programme and ended up with a fairly decent balance on the car. Kazuki seemed quite happy with the long run pace and balance so we have done a good job with honing the car so far and we are pretty close to where we want it to be. Free practice 1: 6th (1min 26.724secs), 38 laps Free practice 2: 6th (1min 27.149secs), 53 laps ations of this press release will be available shortly on www.toyotahybridracing.com, where copyright-free photos are also available for editorial use.
