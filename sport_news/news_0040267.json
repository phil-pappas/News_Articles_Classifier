The Panthers have allowed just one goal in each of their four games.\nIt helps that goalie Roberto Luongo's eyes practically bulge out of his mask when he sees those clashing swords coming at him as he made 24 saves to improve to 15-6-2 with a sub-2.00 goals-against-average against the Sabres. He has won seven straight against Buffalo, including four shutouts. Luongo's 403rd victory ties him with Grant Fuhr for ninth on the all-time wins list.\nAll preseason the Panthers emphasized how critical it was to get off to a fast start this season after falling short of the playoffs last year. Thanks to the schedule-makers as well as a blossoming young team on the upswing they improved to 3-1 to match their best start since the 2011-12 season which also happens to be the last time they made the playoffs.\nAlso off to a sensational start is Jagr, who has four goals in the first four games, including two multiple-goal outings (124 career). Jagr didn't score his fourth goal last season with the Devils until Nov. 28 in his 23rd game.\nThe Panthers, who scored on their first two power-play chances in the season opener, had converted just 1 of 14 since and none over their last two games. That dubious streak ended at 8:42 of the first period when Aleksander Barkov -- who's evolving into an elite playmaker in his third season -- set up Jagr in front of the right circle for a snapper past goalie Chad Johnson.\nJohnson, the Sabres' 10th goalie in net since last February, has replaced injured starter Robin Lehner. Jagr's 205th power-play goal tied him with Joe Sakic for 13th place all-time. It was Jagr's first goal against the Sabres since Dec. 7, 2011.\nIn a bizarre (near) end to the first period, a couple of players crashed into the boards and dislodged a portion of the glass in the Panthers' zone. Instead of waiting for the maintenance crew to repair the glass, the on-ice officials resorted to Rule 17:07 and signaled for an early intermission with 2:53 left on the clock.\nWhen the players came out of the dressing room they remained on the same side of the ice, and just 27 seconds into the continuation of the first period, Jagr strolled in before smoking a riser past Johnson. It was Jagr's 44th goal against the 1-3 Sabres and 100th point in his 84th game against them.\nWhen the 2:53 elapsed the players switched sides, but the Panthers now led 2-0 after one. From there the Panthers seem to doze off, but despite three consecutive power plays they wouldn't score until they were at even strength at 7:10 when rookie defenseman Jake McCabe crashed the net to bury Nick Foligno's pass. It was McCabe's first NHL goal in his 11th game.\nLeading 2-1 after two, Jagr set up the insurance goal on another power-play goal as his blast off Johnson's pads went to Barkov for the rebound at 4:24 of the third.\nThe Panthers special teams were dominating after killing off Buffalo's first five power-play goals but finally Tyler Ennis' slapper from the point made it 3-2 at 12:35 to create a nervous ending.\n(c)2015 Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)\nVisit the Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) at www.sun-sentinel.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738499&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738499&h=Jagr+scores+twice+to+lead+Panthers+to+3%2D2+victory+over+Sabres", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/hockey/s-1738499"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:14:11.037+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
