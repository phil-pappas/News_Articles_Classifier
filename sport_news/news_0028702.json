They could practise with Toronto some morning and be force-fed D-League minutes later that night. The others on D-League deals won’t be able to join the parent club without signing an NBA contract until January when the 10-day contract period begins.\nBut having the non-roster guys close by and keeping them in the family, so to speak, provides the consistency the Raptors want.\n“They understand what we’re doing, they know the terminology, they have a great feel for our offensive system, our defensive system,” said Casey.\nTV time: The Raptors are splitting all of their broadcasts right down the middle, the team announced Wednesday. TSN and Sportsnet will each have 41 TV and 41 radio games with no change to the crews. Matt Devlin will once again be the sole TV play-by-play voice with Jack Armstrong (TSN) and Leo Rautins (Sportsnet) providing commentary. On radio, Eric Smith and Paul Jones will handle the Sportsnet games with Jones, Armstrong and Sherman Hamilton handling the TSN radio broadcasts.\n ", "external_links": ["http://static.freeskreen.com/publisher/52/freeskreen.min.js", "http://raptors905.dleague.nba.com/"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T22:55:24.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
