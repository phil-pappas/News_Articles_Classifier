The Falcons were eliminated from postseason contention with the loss. Gregory Broome/Stars and Stripes Vilseck page \nRAMSTEIN AIR BASE, Germany -- The defending Division I champion Ramstein Royals completed an undefeated regular season Saturday with a rugged 20-7 defeat of the visiting Vilseck Falcons, an outcome that left the hard-luck Falcons holding the short straw in a furious final-weekend scramble for the postseason. \nThe Royals entered the game already locked in as the No. 1 seed in next weekend's semifinals as Lakenheath, Stuttgart, Vilseck and Wiesbaden battled to claim the three available spots below them. As it turned out, Ramstein will host fourth-seeded Stuttgart; the 2-3 Panthers, despite Friday night's loss to Wiesbaden, advance to the playoffs ahead of 2-3 Vilseck on the strength of their 41-20 defeat of the Falcons in the regular season. \nLakenheath will travel to Wiesbaden in the other Division I semifinal. \nRunning back Sid Boggs, pushed into heavy duty by an injury, answered the call with 109 yards and a touchdown on 18 carries. Connor Davey and Kyle Glenn also rushed for touchdowns. \nThe Royal defense, meanwhile, made its share of impact plays as well. Damon White had a pair of interceptions and Kyle Glenn, Trevor Miller and Andy Short picked off one Vilseck pass apiece to short-circuit the Falcon attack. \nDrew Pinckney carried 11 times for 46 yards and posted a team-high six tackles to lead Vilseck on both sides of the ball. \nThe game was a rematch of a season-opening 7-7 tie that didn't count towards playoff seeding.
