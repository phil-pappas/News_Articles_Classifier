Senior Tristan Cornell-Roberts and junior Phyo Htet scored two goals apiece to lead Ithaca (10-0), which is ranked third in this week's New York State Sportswriters Association Class AA poll. \nSince giving up two first-half goals to Elmira on Sept. 23, the Little Red has scored 18 unanswered goals in wins over the Express (5-2), Maine-Endwell on Friday (3-0) and the Blue Raiders.

That game is set for 7 p.m. at Moresco Stadium; in the teams' first meeting, on Sept. 12 in Vestal, the Little Red escaped with a 1-0 victory on a goal by senior Andrew Araneo with 5:48 left in the first half. \nElmira Notre Dame 11, Waverly 1: On Wednesday night in Elmira, the host Crusaders scored in double figures for the fourth straight game to extend their overall record to 11-0. \nNotre Dame, ranked third in the latest state Class C poll, has outscored its opponents by a whopping 106-3. \nMike Woglom and Rocco Coulibaly had three goals apiece, with Junior Coulibaly adding two goals.
