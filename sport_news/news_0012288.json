At Einstein High School this morning, aerobics outfits, flash dance costumes….even a ‘90s-repping Bill Clinton mask made that clear. \nMaintaining a tradition that’s decorated the Titans mid-October walkways for decades, students filled the hall they call “Main Street” early Thursday morning. All present were dressed appropriately for the theme chosen for this year’s extravaganza: decades. \n“Main Street” was broken up into four quadrants: the seniors filled theirs with 1920's garb and collectibles; the juniors sported ‘90s attire; the sophomores frizzed their hair and threw on some neon for a 1980's throwback; and the freshmen represented the ‘60s. \n“They do grand displays based on the themes and then they have students that dress up in character. The band plays music and they go all out…it’s just the craziest thing!” said Leslie Copeland-Tune, PTSA president. Albert Einstein PTSA on Thursday, October 15, 2015 \nThe students have spent many extra hours at school preparing decorations, outfits and music to make the event as festive as possible. Wednesday night, some didn’t leave the building at 10PM, only to arrive at 6:30 Thursday morning for an early kick off to the celebration. \n“At 6:30am, there were probably already 100 people there. By 7:45, the hallway was jampacked. Music was playing, the seniors were chanting “2016!” and the seniors even distributed fake money with the principals’ faces on it,” Leslie said. \nThough all of this hype surrounds the football team’s meeting with Kennedy High Friday night, the Thursday morning festivities were an opportunity for the bands to go head-to-head against each other in a “Battle of the Bands.” \nWhile there’s always a lot of learning to be done, these are often the moments that make the high school experience so memorable, enriching and inviting. Leslie, the mother of two Titans, learned that this morning from someone who's watched the celebration evolve over the years. \n“I talked to someone today who told me her first of these experiences was at Einstein in the '90s…she said she wondered sometimes if all the pomp and circumstance was a waste of time in some ways but, it’s just the best tradition.” Read or Share this story: http://on.wusa9.com/1Lw9I5S TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T22:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T22:46:10.852+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
