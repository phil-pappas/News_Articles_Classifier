A year ago, it caused their season to go into a long, slow spiral. The season-long effect of Monday night's 27-7 loss remains to be seen, but if it is a harbinger of things to come, it will be a miserable rest of the season for the Giants. \nAs for the short term, the Giants lost sole possession of first place in the NFC East and are locked in a tie with the Eagles at 3-3, with the Cowboys at 2-3 and heading to MetLife Stadium on Sunday off their bye. Latest Giants stories Battered Giants' win streak on line in Philly \nTechnically, this wasn't as debilitating a loss as the 2014 version. In that game, the Giants were shut out -- they at least scored a touchdown Monday night, although they were held scoreless for the final 55:23 -- and lost Victor Cruz for the season with a torn patellar tendon. They followed with six straight losses. Stats Giants vs. Eagles boxscore \nEach of the three Eagles touchdowns Monday night could be traced directly to a Giants error that either extended a drive or resulted in a turnover. The Giants were unable to take advantage of four Eagles turnovers. \n\"Very disappointed in the outcome,'' Tom Coughlin said. \"I thought from the second drive when we should have had 14 points on the board . . . the offense showed nothing. We're going to have to get our chins off the floor real quick.'' \nThe sliver of good news for the Giants: If these teams falling over themselves truly represent the best the division has to offer, there should be plenty of time left to regroup and make a run. \nadvertisement | advertise on newsday \nThe Eagles led 17-7 after a first half that the Giants started out controlling completely before giving it away with a series of gaffes and mistakes. \nThe Giants opened the game with an easy 80-yard drive in which they never even faced a third down and scored on a 13-yard pass to Odell Beckham Jr. After a three-and-out by the Eagles, the Giants again were driving and Eli Manning had completed his first 10 passes. But then a pass to last week's hero, Larry Donnell, was ripped from the tight end's arms by DeMeco Ryans for an interception. Giants Monday Night Football: Giants vs. Eagles \nStill, the Giants seemed to be in command and appeared to have held the Eagles to another quick punt. Damontre Moore changed all of that with a boneheaded penalty, picking up and body-slamming Sam Bradford after he released a third-down pass. \"It was a bad penalty,'' Coughlin said, \"and we had a few of them.'' \nThat gave the Eagles a fresh set of downs and they took advantage, scoring on a 32-yard pass to Riley Cooper. \nThe Giants were unable to convert on third-and-1 on their next possession and punted it away. After getting the ball back, Manning threw a not-so-quick wide receiver screen for Dwayne Harris that Nolan Carroll intercepted and returned 17 yards for a touchdown. The Giants had outgained the Eagles 137 yards to 66 but trailed 14-7. \nThings got worse for the Giants. Rashad Jennings fumbled. Manning was under duress. Cullen Jenkins was flagged for an illegal hit on Bradford that gave the Eagles a first down. Then Caleb Sturgis kicked a 37-yard field goal to make it 17-7 with three seconds left. \nThe Giants committed only three turnovers in their first five games and had three in the first half against the Eagles. They had allowed four sacks this season but allowed three in the first three quarters. There also were two intentional-grounding penalties in which Manning nearly was brought down.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:48:39.403+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
