Youth-only weekends are set for duck and deer hunting. These early seasons were created so mentors can give their full attention to the kids they guide. Texas children are routinely introduced to hunting at early ages and often without the preparatory work necessary to ensure success.\nYou wouldn't put a kid who'd never swung a baseball bat into a pivotal game to hit with the bases loaded, two outs and the game on the line. A first hunting experience can be just as intense, for both the parent and the child, and all aspects should be considered well in advance.\nTexas deer hunting can be pretty easy because of laws that allow for baiting of the game. You can use corn sprinkled from a sack to lure deer into close range of a hunting blind. It's then just a matter of waiting for a standing, broadside shot and getting the hunter into position to take the shot.\nYou have put your youth hunters in the blind, and let them practice getting a good rest, right? Deer blinds are built by and for adults. Most of the seats are too low and the windows too high for young kids. These things should be determined before you ask a kid to shoot a deer. Otherwise, the kid is being set up for failure.\nI know kids who've taken a first deer at age 5. Age 7 is not an uncommon age for deer hunting to begin. It all depends on the child and his or her interest in pursuing an adult's hunting hobbies.\nMake sure the kid has an adequate rifle (.222 caliber is the smallest legal caliber allowed for deer hunting) but not so powerful that the recoil hurts the child. Any shooter afraid of what happens when the trigger is squeezed will not shoot accurately.\nAmmunition manufacturers are now making reduced recoil ammunition for many popular calibers. Through smaller bullets and lighter powder charges, recoil is cut by as much as 50 percent. This makes a light-recoil caliber like a .243 or a .260 a good choice for most youth hunters.\nAlso make sure the kid has practiced finding a target through the tunnel vision of a telescopic sight. That's often the toughest chore for newcomers. Use photos of deer to point out the heart/lung area behind the shoulder. It affords the highest percentage shot for a humane result.\nYouth duck hunters have a much different challenge because they shoot at fast-moving targets. You can stack the odds in their favor through practice on the skeet field and by placing decoys closer than normal to the blind. Ducks are calmer when they haven't been hunted much and are more likely to decoy within close range.\nA 20-gauge autoloading shotgun is a good choice for a beginning youth duck hunter. Put an improved cylinder or skeet choke tube in the barrel, and do not call the shot until the ducks are close.\nUse face paint on yourself and your youth hunter. Kids like face paint. In fact, do whatever it takes to have a good time. Hunting should be fun, but it can be boring, especially for young novices.\nWhen the deer don't show up, and the ducks refuse to fly, look for animal tracks in the mud, throw rocks in the water, roast marshmallows on the campfire or do whatever the kids want to do. Youth hunting weekends are for the youth, after all.\nDuck hunters should remember that Texas defines \"youth\" as 16 or younger for deer season, but the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service defines youth as 15 or younger for duck season, and the feds' definition overrules state regulations.\nYOUTH-ONLY HUNTING WEEKENDS White-tailed deer and Rio Grande turkeys: Oct. 31-Nov. 1.\nHigh Plains and South Zone Ducks: Oct. 24-25.\nNorth Zone Ducks: Oct. 31-Nov. 1.\nCALENDAR MONDAY, OCT. 5 : Dallas Fly Fishers monthly meeting with casual dinner and social hour, 7 p.m. at the Wyndham Hotel, 7800 Alpha Road, Dallas.
