He played just 13.9 minutes per game on a team that also has Jarrett Jack, Shane Larkin and Donald Sloan on the roster at point guard. \nMiller was acquired from Detroit later in July for Steve Blake, and Daniels was signed in September. \nRosters must be at 15 by Monday afternoon. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:49:10.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
