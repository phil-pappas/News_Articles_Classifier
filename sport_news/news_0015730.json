He said Bradford is “always in my ear, telling me things.” \nIt’s just that Bradford might not have been comfortable doing that before. After all, he’s in his first season with the Eagles and didn’t participate in team drills during the spring organized team activities as he recovered from his second ACL surgery. \n“I think for anybody coming in new to an organization or a team, you’ve got to establish yourself before you can start to say [something],” Eagles coach Chip Kelly said. “Sam was a little bit more quiet in April in May because he wasn’t really full-go in terms of what we were doing … But you could start to see him assert himself a little bit more. I think it’s a process.” \nBradford is still going through that process. He started slowly this season. But over the last two games, Bradford has thrown for 603 yards, with five touchdowns and two interceptions. \nThe two interceptions came in the first half against the Saints, both on passes into the end zone. It continues a disturbing trend for Bradford, who has been much better in the second half than in the first this season. \nBradford has completed 56.3 percent of his passes in the first half, for 524 yards, with two touchdowns and three interceptions. His quarterback rating is 65.6. In the second half, Bradford has completed 70.2 percent of his passes, for 753 yards, with 6 TDs and 3 INTs. His QB rating is 102.0. \n“I don’t know [why], to be honest,” Bradford said. “There have been some times this year where we’ve just gotten into a rhythm in the second half. Not just myself, but the offense as a whole. Obviously, we’re looking to start that way in the first half. You take away the turnovers last week, and we started fast. We had 300 yards of offense in the first half, which is exactly what we wanted to do.” \nKelly joked this week that the Eagles should play a scrimmage before the game so Bradford could treat the real game as a second half. But both Kelly and Matthews said Thursday that it’s the offense as a whole that has started off slowly. \n“I think he’s been doing fine the whole time,” Matthews said. “At the end of the day, it’s the guys around him. It’s all of us, the skill players, to go out there and make those extra plays for him. It’s not like something Sam is doing now is surprising me. I feel like Sam has always been at a high level. It’s just that we have got to continue to help him out.” \nThe emergence of the running game should help, too, especially against the Giants, whom the Eagles play Monday night. The Eagles had 186 rushing yards against the Saints. But the Giants have the NFL’s stingiest run defense, allowing only 80.6 yards per game. \nThat is offset by the Giants’ NFL-worst pass defense, which allows 304 yards per game. If the Eagles can run on the Giants, it will be easier for Bradford to pass. \nOpponents, however, can pick up on the Eagles’ tendencies. One of them, at least this season, is that the Eagles will run the ball when Bradford is lined up under center. They did so all 17 times against the Saints. In fact, the Eagles have thrown just twice all season when the QB is under center. \nBradford was asked if it’s important to mix that up. \n“No, I think we’re just going to continue to run it every time we’re under center,” he said. \nThen he laughed, adding: “Obviously, it’s important for us to maintain balance. It just so happened that we’ve run the ball when we’ve been under center. But that doesn’t mean we don’t have passes from under center. We just haven’t gotten to those.” \nMaybe he'll mention those in the next shower speech. \nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com .
