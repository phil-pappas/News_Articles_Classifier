But he is a smart, intelligent football player that we have all the confidence in the world of putting him in there if we thought that was best for the team and he was ready to roll.\"\nThe Chargers (2-3), who have lost three of their past four games, can use all the help possible against the undefeated Packers (5-0).\nTe'o, who remains in a walking boot, said he won't know until later if he's available.\n\"We'll see,\" Te'o said. \"But I've prepared mentally as best as I could and that is all you can ask for at the end of the day. Obviously, I'm not as comfortable as if I had been practicing for a week. There isn't any substitution for preparation.\"\nTe'o, a third-year veteran, missed six games last year and three in 2013 with foot injuries.\n___\nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T04:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T03:55:51.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
