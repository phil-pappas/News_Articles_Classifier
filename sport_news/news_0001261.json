(Photo by Bob Levey/Getty Images) Rookie Lance McCullers pitched well for the Houston Astros on Monday in their ALDS Game 4 matchup with the Kansas City Royals. His six strong innings would have put him in line for a win were it not for the Houston bullpen's eighth inning meltdown .\nAdChoices After the game, an interesting claim was suggested by a few Royals players regarding McCullers' celebratory gesture after finishing the sixth inning: They said he made a 'throat-slash' gesture upon finishing the frame. As Quote: d on Twitter by Andy McCullough of the Kansas City Star:\nVolquez and others in Royals dugout said they saw McCullers do a throat-slash gesture after he came off the mound after the sixth.\n— Andy McCullough (@McCulloughStar) October 12, 2015 Volquez on the gesture: \"C'mon, man. You've got to get 27 outs. Not 17.\"\n— Andy McCullough (@McCulloughStar) October 12, 2015 McCullers didn't stay quiet about the claims made against him, though. He took to Twitter to issue a response:\nObviously I didn't do that, everyone needs to chill... Wasn't even looking that way, wasn't directed to them at all. https://t.co/xohwnfOa1o\n— Lance McCullers Jr. (@LMcCullers43) October 12, 2015 Whether McCullers made the gesture, of course, doesn't matter considering the series is now tied and will be decided with a Game 5 at Kauffman Stadium on Wednesday. Still, it serves as a demonstration of the emotional highs that go along with pressure-packed October baseball.\n( h/t Houston Chronicle )\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/LMcCullers43/status/653710546131271680", "http://www.foxsports.com/", "https://twitter.com/McCulloughStar/status/653694463030640640", "http://blog.chron.com/ultimateastros/2015/10/12/royals-say-astros-pitcher-lance-mccullers-made-throat-slash-gesture/", "http://www.foxsports.com/mlb/just-a-bit-outside/story/houston-astros-double-play-ball-that-wasn-t-ruins-the-party-vs-kansas-city-royals-101215", "https://t.co/xohwnfOa1o", "https://twitter.com/McCulloughStar/status/653694347708227584", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:48:37.457+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
