Bhui's 91 came off 183 deliveries and was studded with 12 boundaries and two sixes.\nFor the visitors, Shardul Thakur (1/23) and Balwinder Sandhu (1/24) took wicket apiece.\nBrief scores:\nAndhra 1st innings: 170 for two in 80 overs (Mohammad Kaif batting 66, Ricky Bhui batting 91; Shardul Thakur 1/23) vs Mumbai.
