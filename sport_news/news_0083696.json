(AP) - Steven Stamkos scored his first goal of the season Saturday, helping the Tampa Bay Lightning defeat the Buffalo Sabres 4-1. \nErik Condra, Nikita Kucherov and J.T. Brown also scored for Tampa Bay (2-0) and goaltender Ben Bishop had 24 saves in the victory. \nNicolas Deslauriers scored Buffalo's only goal. Sabres goaltender Chad Johnson was beaten for all four goals while filling in for injured starter Robin Lehner. \nThe Sabres (0-2) started well, getting off two shots on goal in the first minute. Tampa Bay didn't get a shot on Johnson until 8:35, and moments later forced the goalie into a sprawling rebound save on J.T. Brown.
