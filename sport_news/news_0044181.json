Puskar / AP) Teddy Greenstein Contact Reporter News flash: Point spreads are not that complicated \nI learned how point spreads work from the Friday edition of the New York Post, which ran a giant grid each week containing NFL picks. I was about 12. \nJames Franklin is 43 and has spent his life in football. But the Penn State coach says he still doesn't know what it means if the Chiefs are favored by nine points over the Bears. \n\"Point spreads and those things, I don't even understand them,\" he said. \"I lost $20 in Atlantic City when I was 24 after college and I almost threw up. That was the last time I gambled.\" \nCall me a cynic, but I think a more genuine statement came from Michigan State coach Mark Dantonio, whose Spartans are 5-0 but 0-5 against the number that matters in Las Vegas: \"You can't promise people that you'll cover the spread.\" \nOn to the games: \nMinnesota (minus 3.5) at Purdue: The team that's on the rise and playing at home also is getting points. Take the Boilersmakers. \nIndiana (plus 6.5) at Penn State: Would help if we knew who would suit up. Indiana quarterback Nate Sudfeld and top tailback Jordan Howard are game-time decisions, and who knows about Penn State tailback Saquon Barkley? Take the Hoosiers and don't forget the ankle tape. \nIllinois (plus 11) at Iowa: No Josh Ferguson (shoulder) could mean a long day for quarterback Wes Lunt. Iowa, it is. \nMaryland (plus 33) at Ohio State: Seems that Randy Edsall's players have checked out. Now it might be time for him to say goodbye. The Buckeyes will roll. \nNorthwestern (plus 7) at Michigan: When the line opened at 12, I thought it was a misprint. Then I remembered that the Internet can't have misprints. The number has shrunk to 7, which is what Northwestern's defense allows each game. Take the Wildcats. \nMichigan State (minus 14) at Rutgers: It must be time for the Spartans to beat a spread, right? Maybe, but I'll roll the dice on a Rutgers \"black-out\" crowd and receiver Leonte Carroo's fresh legs. \nWisconsin (plus 1) at Nebraska: This series is really not the same without Melvin Gordon rushing for the rough equivalent of three marathons. Even without him, the Badgers will triumph. \nLast week: 4-3", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T19:28:27.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
