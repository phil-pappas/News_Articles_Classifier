(Photo: Jon Durr, Getty Images) \nChicago – And so it ends.\nEven with a 6-0 win over the White Sox Sunday, the Tigers finished with their worst record since 2008 – 74-87. That was also the last time they finished in the basement of the American League Central.\nFile it, forget it and move forward.\nTyler Collins, who will be vying for a spot in the Tigers outfield next season, delivered a bases-loaded triple in the fifth inning to blow the game open. Anthony Gose, who could be the every day center fielder next season, had a single, triple and scored two runs.\nNick Castellanos doubled in a run, Josh Wilson singled in a run and J.D. Martinez, though he didn't get to 40 home runs (38), got his 102nd RBI on a sacrifice fly.\nBOX SCORE: Tigers 6, White Sox 0 \nBut the best advertisement for a brighter 2016 – at least from the season finale -- was the performance of left-hander Daniel Norris.\nManager Brad Ausmus said before the game that he wouldn't handicap the contestants for the 2016 starting rotation in October. Understandable. But Norris' odds continue to improve.\nHe was dominant in his final pitch-controlled start of the season, limiting the White Sox to one hit in five innings.\nHe threw 71 pitches in his previous start and got only five outs. He threw 71 again Sunday, and got 18 outs.\nThe only trouble he faced was in the fourth. Trayce Thompson laced a triple with one out. Norris walked Avisail Garcia, then calmly got Alexis Ramirez to bounce one back to him – 1-4-3 double play.\nJustin Verlander and Anibal Sanchez are expected to be at the top of the rotation next season and general manager Al Avila has said he will be shopping for two free-agent starters this offseason.\nThat would leave one spot and Norris has staked his claim. The Tigers were 5-2 in his eight starts since he was acquired from Toronto in the David Price deal. Take away two bad starts (against Boston and the Rangers, where he gave up 11 runs), Norris has allowed nine runs in 41.2 innings.\nRandy Wolf pitched a scoreless sixth in what could be his last big-league outing. The 39-year-old has said there was a chance he could retire.\nJeff Ferrell, Ian Krol and Kyle Ryan, all contestants for bullpen jobs next season, each pitched a scoreless inning. Combined the Tigers limited the White Sox to three hits total.\nTwitter @cmccosky", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T21:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:40:22.525+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
