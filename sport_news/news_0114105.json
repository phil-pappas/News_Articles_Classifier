A congenital amputee with no arm below his left elbow, the 29-year-old from Connecticut had exceeded all expectations, except his own.\n“My decision isn’t based around record or anything, it’s just I just can’t take it anymore,” Newell told the Herald last week before setting off for a Costa Rica vacation with his girlfriend. “It’s just overbearing for me to have to push through constant injury after injury, and do rehab for my fight camp instead of actually training for a fight.”\nNewell (13-1) said he felt as though he underperformed in his last two fights — both wins — and wasn’t showcasing his true potential.\n“I’m not the killer that I used to be,” he said. “I used to go out and rip peoples’ heads off, go out swinging like a maniac, and I’m not the same.”\nBecause of his physical limitations, Newell grew accustomed to working harder than the average fighter. He found brilliant ways to leverage his missing hand to hit tricky chokes and slams opponents couldn’t always counter in traditional ways. That coupled with one of the sport’s most pronounced aggressive streaks made Newell a marvel to watch.\nIn 2013, he signed with World Series of Fighting, which broadcasts nationally on NBC Sports Network, and last July he was showcased on NBC against lethal lightweight Jusitn Gaethje in a title fight. After a competitive first round, Newell found himself in peril as Gaethje unloaded right hands Newell struggled to deflect.\nIt’s tempting to read the Gaethje fight as a fork in the road for Newell, but he says it was the opposite.\n“If anything I was mad, and I was more motivated once it was over,” Newell said. “But I had a bunch of injuries that I needed to heal.”\nFor the next two fight camps, Newell battled mightily to avoid aggravating worsening injuries. The main culprit was his back.\n“My back constantly gives out, all the time, I’m walking around like I’m a 100-year-old man,” he said. “I do all the rehab to get it better, I do everything I possibly can, and then I sleep wrong and then I’m back at square one. I can’t yawn in the morning. I have to hold it in because I’ll blow out my back. It’s going to be a problem for a while.”\nThat may sound like a heavy price to pay, but Newell took advantage of his time in the spotlight. He saved a lot of his money, living rent-free with his mother until he was 28. He boosted a charity called The Lucky Fin Project for kids born without fully formed limbs, and in retirement wants to meet with more children like him and show them what’s possible, much like his boyhood hero Jim Abbott, a one-handed major league pitcher.\n“I feel good, I’m at peace with my decision,” Newell said. “Starting when I first stepped on a wrestling mat when I was 14, I never stopped. . . . It was always one fight at a time. I never set any goals for myself. My only real goal was to be the best version of myself that I could possibly be.”\nOne of the big questions about Newell’s career was if the UFC would ever give him a shot. Newell feels as though he got his answer.\nAs a 4-0 fighter gaining notice on the Northeast scene, Newell tried out for Season 13 of UFC’s “The Ultimate Fighter” reality show as a 170-pounder. He tapped out a fellow hopeful in grappling tryouts, but was told he was too small for 170. He was invited to come back at 145 for the next season, and got to work shedding the weight and getting licensed to fight in Nevada, where the show is taped.\n“They told me I was on, they told me I was good to go, and then like maybe a couple days before I was supposed to leave, they called and said, ‘Oh, I’m sorry, we’re not going to use you,’ ” Newell said.\nThat, and something about other fighters on the show having more experience, was the extent of the explanation Newell received. Looking back, he can’t help but think his condition was the reason.\n“It wasn’t my skills, it’s that they didn’t want to take the risk with a guy with one hand,” Newell said. “It upset me, but it’s their company and it’s their call, so they can do whatever they want. I don’t need anyone’s approval. I know that I’m good enough.”\nHawn calls it quits, too\nRick Hawn , who represented the United States in judo in the 2004 Olympics and trained for the 2008 Games under elite coach Jimmy Pedro in Wakefield alongside Ronda Rousey , announced his retirement Sept. 19 after winning the Titan FC lightweight title.\nThe 39-year-old, who moved to New England from Oregon to train judo, said he could sense diminishing returns ahead in his MMA career.\n“I know I could probably do more with it, but it just doesn’t really make sense at the moment,” Hawn said. “I have bills like everyone else, I pay taxes like everybody, and for me right now, fighting doesn’t pay the bills. I have to think long-term.”\nHawn’s purse took a hit after he was released last fall from Bellator MMA, in which he’d racked up a pair of six-figure paydays for winning tournaments and climbed the salary scale.\nAnd as much as he took to MMA, Hawn, who retires at 21-4, said the sport was first and foremost a way to monetize the skills he’d acquired in a lifetime of judo.\n“That’s what Jimmy said, go make a little bit of money, see what you could do,” Hawn said of Pedro. “I don’t think we expected me to go as far as I did.”", "external_links": ["http://player.mediabong.net/se/56.js?url=", "https://twitter.com/share?text=Fight+over+for+Newell+"], "published": "2015-10-25T13:48:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:26:01.801+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
