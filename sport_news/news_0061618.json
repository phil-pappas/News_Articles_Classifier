The level of compensation for losing our vice-captain is totally inadequate.” \nNisbett called for a thorough review of the entire free agency system, with his displeasure at the perceived compensation snub leading him to take aim at key AFL decision makers. \n“I believe that Andrew Dillon (AFL legal counsel) and Ken Wood (total player payments manager) have got this totally wrong and we are extremely disappointed,” he said. \nIn other trade news, the Eagles sent their first-round pick (currently No.17) to Brisbane in exchange for midfielder Jack Redden.
