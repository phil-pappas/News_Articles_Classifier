(Photo: David Guralnick, Detroit News) \nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Two weeks ago, it was unclear what Michigan tailback De'Veon Smith's status would be after he suffered a sprained ankle, and now backup tailback Drake Johnson's status for the Michigan State game on Saturday is uncertain.\nJohnson had two carries and scored a touchdown in the first half of the Wolverines' 38-0 defeat of Northwestern last Saturday but did not play the rest of the game. Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh later said Johnson is \"working through something.\"\nHarbaugh said on the Big Ten conference call on Tuesday there was no update on Johnson.\n\"We'll see today,\" Harbaugh said.\nJohnson moved into the backup spot on the depth chart behind Smith after a breakout performance at Maryland in the Big Ten opener. Smith did not make the trip for that game while he healed his injury.\nJohnson is fourth on the team in rushing with 128 yards on 26 carries and two touchdowns. He also has a receiving touchdown.\nHe is coming off his second torn knee ligament and said after the Maryland game he is close to 100 percent. Johnson suffered the second torn anterior cruciate ligament of his career during the season finale at Ohio State last November.\nLewis 'blossoming' \nMichigan cornerback Jourdan Lewis is having an outstanding season and has had an interception in each of the last two games.\nLewis was the Big Ten Defensive Player of the Week for his performance in the Northwestern game, which included a 37-yard interception return for a TD.\nHarbaugh praised Lewis' \"exceptional\" quickness, foot speed and the physical nature with which he plays.\n\"He's really a football player,\" Harbaugh said. \"He's got a great demeanor as a football player. Quiet but confident in all aspects. You can see him blossoming, and it's really a great experience. There's just so much he can do and I think he's finding out right now all the ways he can help a football team. He can do that as a corner, he can do that as a nickel, he could be a heckuva safety. He has return ability. I think it's just the tip of the iceberg right now.\"\nDETROIT NEWS\nJourdan Lewis doing 'spectacular things' for Michigan\nPossibilities for Ojemudia? \nHarbaugh told the BTN crew that worked the game last week that he's interested In finding out if there's a possibility to petition the NCAA for another year for defensive lineman Mario Ojemudia.\nOjemudia had surgery last week for a torn Achilles tendon suffered In the Maryland game. It was a season-ending surgery, but Harbaugh wants to know if there's an option to get another year for him, according to BTN sideline reporter Lisa Byington's blog on Tuesday.\nDETROIT NEWS\nRivalry 'definitely personal' for UM's Desmond Morgan", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T21:04:15.946+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
