All I’m trying to do is go out here and support my teammates and do everything I can, and hope that what I’ve done here in the past is enough.”\nReed is out for another several weeks after undergoing surgery to repair the ulnar collateral ligament in his right thumb last week, further impacting the Nets’ big man depth.\nWhile Andrea Bargnani practiced fully Friday, there was no contact during practice, so it’s unclear if he would have participated in any scrimmaging if there had been.\nWith Bargnani’s status for the opener unclear — and with Reed and rookie Chris McCullough, who remains out rehabbing his surgically repaired right knee definitively out — the Nets could only have three healthy big men on the roster for Wednesday’s home opener.\nCoach Lionel Hollins said that could factor into how the team decides to get its roster from 17 players down to 15 by Monday.\n“We’ve got a few days to see,” Hollins said, “and it puts us in a position of having to delay a decision or change a decision we may not have made if [Reed] was healthy.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brooklyn nets ,  willie reed", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T14:22:55.356+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
