(Photo: ~File) 49 CONNECT 12 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nPISCATAWAY Leonte Carroo's attorney plans to ask Rutgers to reassess its position on the indefinitely suspended football star following the latest round of legal proceedings Thursday in municipal court. \nAt an arraignment and status confirmation hearing, attorney Peter Gilbreth asked for Carroo's case on charges of simple assault under domestic violence to be moved along as quickly as possible. He previously entered a not guilty plea. \n\"We're very pleased with the way it's going judicially,\" Gilbreth said, \"but now we have to encourage Rutgers University to see if they can reassess this position that they have that until it's over he's suspended. We have to get him back on the team.\" \nIt appears a mid-November trial date is the earliest possible option for Carroo, according to Gilbreth. Rutgers will play its final regular-season game Nov. 28, with a game every Saturday from Oct. 10 until then. \nGilbreth said Rutgers coach Kyle Flood \"indicated from the beginning that the case would have to be resolved\" before Carroo's status with the team changed . Flood is serving his own university-issued suspension of three games for impermissible contact with a faculty member . \nRutgers declined comment when asked for a response to Gilbreth's intentions. \n\"Otherwise the season could be over for Leonte, which is not, in my mind and in our minds, fair,\" Gilbreth said. \"That's another argument that has to be made to a different body of people.\" Leonte Carroo attorney: Video, witnesses indicate no assault \nCarroo's next court date is Tuesday in the Family Division of state Superior Court, New Brunswick, on a temporary restraining order filed by the woman who accused Carroo of slamming her into the concrete during an altercation that happened after a football game outside the Hale Center on Sept. 12. \nGilbreth said he \"will probably await the resolution\" of that hearing, at which eyewitnesses and evidence including two cellphone videos are expected to be presented, before contacting Rutgers officials. \nA highly regarded NFL prospect , Carroo already has missed two games. The Edison native's next criminal court date is Oct. 15, at which point Judge Dennis Fackelman is hopeful that all discovery material will be exchanged and a trial date will be set. \nCarroo's defense team maintains he did not touch the woman. \n\"He just wants to get this resolved as soon as possible,\" Gilbreth said of his client. \"He just wants his day in court because he has a lot to say.\" \nCarroo, who was surrounded by family, left court without making a comment. He wore a scarlet red pocket square in the jacket pocket of his beige suit. Could Rutgers become one-dimensional without Leonte Carroo? \nThere is precedent for Rutgers football allowing players facing legal charges to participate. \nTejay Johnson played in all 13 games during the 2013 season while facing charges of robbery, aggravated assault and criminal restraint stemming from an incident that happened in June 2013. The charges were dropped before the bowl game. \nMore recently, Ruhann Peele rehabilitated from an injury last season while facing a simple-assault charge . Once healthy, Peele was suspended for the rest of the season and the charge later was dropped. \n\"We wanted to wait until the judge's decision today. Now we can clarify our position with the university,\" Gilbreth said. \"We're moving quickly, but not as quick as we can in terms of his athletic status. \n\"The (temporary restraining order) hearing in a couple days, I think, will be further reason for the university to assess its position. I'm hopeful to either meet directly with or communicate directly with the university at this point and ask them to reassess the position.\" \nGilbreth also asked that Carroo's case be severed from five other criminal complaints stemming from a separate altercation attached to the same incident. Carroo's girlfriend Maria Vega and his mother, Lavern Carroo, were charged with simple assault by Rutgers University police. \nCarroo allegedly intervened in a confrontation between Vega and another woman with whom he previously was romantically involved. The second woman, whose name is being withheld, worked for Rutgers athletics as a recruiting ambassador at the time but no longer does. \nVega also filed a criminal complaint against the woman Carroo is accused of assaulting. \nFackelman explained that the case can only be moved along so quickly because of its complex nature, with \"so many people involved\" that it has \"mushroomed into six complaints.\" Photographs, videos and eyewitness accounts are expected to be part of evidence. \nRutgers dismissed six players from the program in September following arrests in incidents unrelated to Carroo's. In all,three one-time Rutgers players, including Johnson, face armed robbery charges and five others, including Peele, face aggravated assault charges. \n\"I can only compare it to what's going on with some of the other athletes,\" Gilbreth said. \"Home invasions, very high bail, an alleged confession. I understand their position with that case. But here is municipal court, disorderly person, not-guilty plea, eyewitnesses who support his position. It's just not fair that he be held in limbo in his academic and athletic status. I'm hoping they will reassess that in light of what's going on.\" \nStaff Writer Ryan Dunleavy: rdunleavy@gannettnj.com 49 CONNECT 12 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1KOY4BD TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T01:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:15:55.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
