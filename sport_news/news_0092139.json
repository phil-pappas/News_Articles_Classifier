The two courts are open from 9 a.m. to sundown and are located on Algiers St., across from the Murphys Community Park. The courts are first-come, first-served but players may sign in at the reception desk at the Murphys Historic Hotel to ensure availability. Players may use their own set of bocce balls, or a set may be rented at the hotel for $12 per court. Groups may reserve in advance by calling 728-8183. A court rental fee will apply. All rental-fee proceeds benefit Murphys Park.“This has very much been a community effort,” said Sue Friedman, president of the Murphys Community Club which spearheaded funding for the project, in a press release. “The Angels-Murphys Rotary Club stepped up as a major sponsor from the very start. The Murphys Business Association (MBA) and the Native Daughters have made generous donations along with local businesses and craftsmen. County government has been very helpful. The courts would not have been possible without everyone’s contribution.” The Murphys Community Club is comprised of an all-volunteer Board of Directors and relies solely on membership dues, park rental fees, revenue from our summer concert series and donations to maintain and improve Murphys Park. The club welcomes any monetary donations to complete the project. The wish list for phases two and three include amenities such as shade structures, lighting and landscaping. Donations may be sent to Murphys Community Club, P.O. Box 394, Murphys, CA., 95247. For more information, call 728-8183.
