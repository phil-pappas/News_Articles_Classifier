I will give them to him.” \nAsked if he would consider resignation, Mihajlovic added: “I’ve never resigned from a job, and I never will.” \nMilan hosted Napoli looking to bounce back from last week’s 0-1 defeat away to Genoa. \nInstead, the Rossoneri were handed a football lesson that has underlined the gulf in class between their side and a Napoli team that is beginning to underline its scudetto potential. After a shaky start under new coach Maurizio Sarri, Napoli has been banging in goals for fun, routing Lazio 5-0 two weeks ago and, after the blip of a scoreless home draw with Carpi, beating champion Juventus 2-1 in Naples. \nIt was Napoli’s biggest ever win against Milan on Sunday at the San Siro, but Mihajlovic refused to gloss over his side’s deficiencies. \nFiorentina eased to a 3-0 win over 10-man Atalanta to move into sole possession of top spot in Serie A after Inter Milan drew 1-1 at Sampdoria. \nLazio beat Frosinone 2-0 and Roma won 4-2 at Palermo. \nSami Khedira marked his Serie A debut with a goal to help four-time defending champion Juventus to only its second league win of the season as it came from behind to beat bottom side Bologna 3-1. \nIn Germany, Robert Lewandowski scored twice as Bayern Munich routed previously unbeaten Borussia Dortmund 5-1 to open up a seven-point lead after eight Bundesliga matches. \nThomas Mueller also scored twice after Dortmund had started brightly. Bayern’s attacking midfielder opened the scoring in the 26th minute when Jerome Boateng sent him through with a long ball over the top, and he claimed his second from the penalty spot in the 35th, after Henrikh Mkhitaryan brought down Thiago Alcantara. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang pulled one back a minute later but Lewandowski scored seconds after the break to kill any hopes his former side had of a comeback. \nBayer Leverkusen drew 1-1 with visiting Augsburg, which took the lead in the 12th when goalkeeper Bernd Leno misjudged a simple back pass, kicked air and let the ball roll into the net. \nIn France, Zlatan Ibrahimovic became the leading goalscorer in Paris Saint-Germain history as the reigning Ligue 1 champion extended its lead at the top following a 2-1 victory over arch-rival Marseille. \nA minute’s silence was observed prior to kick-off for the victims of Saturday’s heavy flooding on the French Riviera that claimed 17 lives, with four people still missing.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:21:12.719+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
