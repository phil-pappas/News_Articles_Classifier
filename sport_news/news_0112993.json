(Mark D. Smith-USA TODAY Sports) Reuters \nNORMAN, Okla. — Samaje Perine and Joe Mixon combined for 355 yards rushing and six touchdowns Saturday as No. 17 Oklahoma beat Texas Tech 63-27 at Gaylord Family-Oklahoma Memorial Stadium. \nThere was plenty of talk going into the game about the matchup of Sooners quarterback Baker Mayfield with his former team, but that storyline took a backseat to Oklahoma’s running game. \nOklahoma had struggled to move the ball on the ground with any consistency for much of the season but had little problem against the Red Raiders. \nPerine, a sophomore, ran for 201 yards and four scores while Mixon, a redshirt freshman, ran for 154 yards and two scores. \nIt was the fourth 200-yard performance of Perine’s career and the first 100-yard rushing day for Mixon. \nPerine hit the mark with 8:18 remaining, on his fourth touchdown run of the game. \nMixon hit the 100-yard mark on the second play after halftime when he ran around defender after defender. He was finally brought down 45 yards later. \nThe Sooners came out on the second drive and mostly kept the ball on the ground, running on seven of eight plays and marching right down the field. Only one play on the drive — a 3-yard loss by Mayfield — went for fewer than four yards. \nOklahoma got on the board on Mixon’s 11-yard touchdown run. \nJust three plays later, Oklahoma linebacker Eric Striker, blitzing from the edge, leaped up two yards behind the line of scrimmage and picked off Patrick Mahomes’ pass. Striker returned the pick — the first of his career — to the Texas Tech 3-yard line. \nThe interception was one of four in the game for the Sooners. \nOn the first play of the next drive, Perine was hit by two defensive players in the backfield but broke free and fell across the goal line to put Oklahoma up 14-0. \nThe Sooners were up 21-3 and driving, looking like they were about to turn the game into a rout, but they turned the ball over twice in succession and Texas Tech took advantage. \nFirst, Sooners wide receiver Jarvis Baxter fumbled after an 18-yard gain and Tech safety Jah’Shawn Johnson picked it up and returned it 50 yards to set up the Red Raiders’ first touchdown. \nOn the next drive, Oklahoma quickly gained 32 yards on three running plays before Mayfield was intercepted by Justis Nelson, who returned it 45 yards. \nIt took Texas Tech just four plays to score another touchdown — a 13-yard run by DeAndre Washington — pulling the Red Raiders to within 21-17. \nMayfield, who transferred from Texas Tech after the 2013 season, completed 15 of 22 passes for 212 yards and a pair of touchdowns. \nNOTES : Oklahoma CB Zack Sanchez suffered an injury to his right leg on the game’s first play and was taken off in a wheelchair. Sanchez did not return and was replaced by Dakota Austin, who intercepted a pass in the end zone in the final moments of the first half. … Oklahoma LB Jordan Evans and RB Daniel Brooks missed the game with injury. Evans was replaced in the starting lineup by Frank Shannon, who made his first start since the Sugar Bowl following the 2013 season. Shannon was suspended from the school for the 2014 season. … Texas Tech OT Le’Raven Clark, who was injured early in the win over Kansas a week earlier, returned to the lineup. … Oklahoma freshman K/P Austin Seibert missed his first career field goal late in the first half. Seibert had made 10 consecutive field goal tries to begin his career. … There was a pregame moment of silence for the tragedy in Stillwater, Okla., where at least three people were killed by an alleged drunk driver during Oklahoma State’s homecoming parade. … Oklahoma travels to Kansas on Saturday while Texas Tech hosts Oklahoma State.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T14:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T14:16:39.078+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
