The Rangers entered Tuesday night’s home game against the Winnipeg Jets undefeated but clearly flawed.\n“We are winning games and we are not playing our best,” alternate captain Marc Staal said, despite the Rangers’ outscoring opponents a combined 12-6 through their 3-0-0 start.\nStaal’s assessment after Saturday night’s 5-2 win over Columbus at the Garden was as accurate as it was honest. Henrik Lundqvist has been incredible to start the season and the offense has provided outbursts, but overall the Blueshirts’ early record doesn’t reflect their quality of play.\nPerhaps that is why coach Alain Vigneault fielded his third different lineup in his team’s fourth game Tuesday night against Winnipeg (2-1-0), which was concluding a back-to-back and vulnerable perhaps on tired legs.\n“Well, our goaltender is where we want him to be, there’s no doubt there. He’s played extremely well,” Vigneualt said of the state of his Rangers. “I would say that we haven’t been able to put a 60-minute game together the way I think this group can. And when we haven’t, Hank has been there.”\nRELATED: VIGNEAULT FASTEST TO 100 WINS IN RANGERS HISTORY\nVigneault cited a strong first period in the Rangers’ season-opener in Chicago, better second and third periods in Columbus on Friday, and a 5-0 lead to open Saturday’s victory over the Jackets as encouraging stretches of play. Then there have been long lulls, and the good news is at times the Rangers’ defense has done well to keep shooters to the outside, and at others Lundqvist has just been absolutely out of his mind.\n“We’re (getting better at) keeping it tight. The first game in Chicago we were running around and everyone was all over the place,” alternate captain Dan Girardi said. “When things are going wrong or you’re tired, just stay in the middle. The puck’s gonna come to you.\n“It’s funny to say – a 5-0 game is actually a hard game to play I think,” Girardi said of Saturday night’s late slippage in puck possession. “You’re focused and you want to play, but it’s a weird feeling out there: You really don’t need any more goals but you don’t wanna give up any, so you’re not on your toes as much as you should be. We should be staying up and keeping up on the forecheck, but we’re kind of just sitting back, waiting, and that’s why they kept coming.”\nTuesday night, Vigneault took the uncommon but necessary and overdue step to scratch defenseman Dan Boyle, an offensively skilled veteran who doesn’t play the system well and is a defensive liability. Putting in Dylan McIlrath hopefully added more defense and size and simple, first-pass plays.\nThe upside of the Rangers’ search for improvement and consistency, though, is that they’ve been winning while they’re figuring it out. Lundqvist said the team’s leadership has made a concerted effort to start fast.\n“I think the core group from last year is helping the new guys, and together I think we understand what needs to be done here early on,” he said. “Two years ago we changed our system (and struggled early). Last year we tried to recover a little bit from the Finals (and started slow), but now this year I feel like we all understand what needs to be done. It’s important that we set the tone early and build something positive.”\nRelated Stories Rangers' line of Hayes-Stepan-Kreider showing chemistry Sean Avery marries Hilary Rhoda in Southampton Adam Graves lays wreath at gravesite of Rangers founder Tags: henrik lundqvist", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:00:23.460+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
