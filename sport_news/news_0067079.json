That doesn't begin to explain Miami's 58-0 loss to Clemson \nIt was the ugliest day in Miami football history, the absolute pits, as the scoreboard said. Miami athletic director Blake James looked at it one final time from an end-zone tunnel as the final seconds ticked away in Saturday's loss and Al Golden's era. \nJames said, no, that second part wasn't true. No coaching change would be made in the immediate aftermath of Miami's 58-0 loss to Clemson, the largest margin of defeat in school history. \n\"Disappointing,\" James called it. Then he said before walking to Miami's locker room, \"We'll go and get ready to play Duke.\" \nThey can go play Duke, and somehow beat Duke, and beat Virginia after that. But the moment of truth has come and gone for Miami. We're down to a timing issue with Golden's firing rather than an actual decision. \nNext loss? After the final game? When's the best time for everyone to move on and Miami to find the next coach? \nThey cannot go on with him, just as they could not go on with Randy Shannon after he lost 48-0 to Virginia to close out the Orange Bowl. Losing is one thing. Losing in double digits, as Golden has 10 of the past 25 games, is another. \nClemson routs Miami at Sun Life Stadium. (Michael Laughlin) \nLosing like Saturday was the saddest state of affairs, suggesting the coach had lost the team again. That was the case with Golden at the end of last season, and it looked to repeat itself Saturday. \nEveryone asked Saturday if Golden could get a signature win. \nHe got a signature loss instead. \n\"Got beat top to bottom,\" were Golden's first words after the game. \nHe then used the following words over the next 10 minutes: Outplayed. Outcoached. Inexcusable. Intolerable. Selfish. Unacceptable. And terrible. \n\"I don't think I've beat anyone 58-0,\" Clemson defensive tackle Shaq Lawson said. \"Maybe in high school.\" Golden: 'we got beat from top to bottom' \nMiami suffers worst loss in school history \nMiami suffers worst loss in school history See more videos \nClemson led 21-0 in the first quarter. It rushed two players in the second quarter, as if to increase the degree of difficulty, and one of them, Lawson, knocked Miami quarterback Brad Kaaya out of the game. \nLeading 42-0 at half, Clemson coach Dabo Swinney held a team meeting for several minutes on his sideline rather than just go into the locker room. What, no halftime adjustments were necessary? \nActually, it was something equally telling. \n\"He told us to play with class,\" Lawson said. He then added: \"They were the ones doing the talking. We were doing the playing.\" \nWe're becoming experts on the ins and outs of mid-season firings and interim hires in South Florida. When the obituary to this season gets written, the Hurricanes story will be the same as the Dolphins in 2015. \nThey stayed with the wrong coach a year too long. That cost them some add-on misery this season. The Dolphins can hope for a miracle run under interim coach Dan Campbell that pulls them into the playoffs, considering there's no cost to that. \nBut the Hurricanes can't even do that. There's no benefit in firing Golden now as opposed to five games from now. There's no voice to change a collegiate culture overnight. No interim name they'd like to see. \nMiami can have back-channel conversations with coaches who are out of work right now like friends-of-the-program in Rob Chudzinski and Greg Schiano. But anyone with a coaching job would be tied up until when the Hurricanes are done. \nTiming is everything, of course, and this offseason looks to be one with a lot of competition for coaching. Look at the teams with interim coaches: Southern Cal. South Carolina. Maryland. Illinois. \nIt's still October, too. There's a lot of football left to play. That was Golden's message, too. What else can he say after that game? \n\"We need to get ready for Duke,\" he said. \"As I've said, we've played one division game. We need to go out and play well against Duke.\" \nAh, yes, the Coastal Division is still there for the taking. But so was this Saturday against sixth-ranked Clemson to change perceptions. Instead, Golden didn't just suffer a beat down of historic proportions at the midpoint of his fifth season. \nHe wrote his Hurricanes obituary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:47:57.788+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
