Kris Commons doubled their advantage four minutes later to leave the Celtic faithful eyeing their first Europa League win of the season. \nHowever, the Turkish side were handed a lifeline just before the break as substitute Fernandao, on in the 40th minute for the injured Volkan Sen, raced onto Efe Ambrose's poor header, before finishing past goalkeeper Craig Gordon. \nNapoli made it three wins out of three for Italian sides with a 2-0 victory at Legia Warsaw. \nNapoli and FC Midtjylland are both sitting pretty on six points at the top of Group D after making it two wins in two matches, Dries Mertens and Gonzalo Higuain scoring for Napoli, while Midtjylland were comfortable 3-1 victors at Club Brugge. \nAfter Liverpool's draw, the other game in Group B also finished all square as Rubin Kazan and Bordeaux contested a goalless stalemate in Russia. \nBoth matches in Group A also saw the points shared as Molde and Ajax drew 1-1, as Celtic drew with Fenerbahce. \nCompetition favourites Borussia Dortmund again had to come from behind as they too drew 1-1 in Greece with PAOK thanks to a strike from Gonzalo Castro. Also in that group, Krasnodar defeated Qabala 2-1. \nSporting Braga and Rapid Vienna also have 100% records after 1-0 successes - Braga at home to FC Groningen and Vienna away at Dinamo Minsk. \nThe other game in Group J threw up a surprise as FK Qarabag defeated Anderlecht 1-0.
