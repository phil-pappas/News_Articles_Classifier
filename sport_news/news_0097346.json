But that's not going to happen anytime soon, according to ESPN.com. \nAccording to the report from ESPN's Joe Schad , \"There is nowhere near the pressure to remove him at this time that there was with Steve Patterson or even Mack Brown,\" a source said. Another source told ESPN that Strong has the support of everyone he needs right now and the last thing the athletic department wants is \"to make a change.\" \nStrong inherited a program rapidly on the decline form former head coach Mack Brown. Strong held the team together last season after taking over for Brown, getting the team to a bowl game, but ultimately lost the bowl game to finish 6-7. \nThis season started horribly with the Longhorns getting mauled by Notre Dame before turning it around in a bounce-back game against Rice. The Longhorns then lost two heartbreaking games in two weeks after special teams miscues cost the team in the final minutes of both games. \nThe Longhorns had been competitive against Cal and Oklahoma State in the last two losses and appeared to be ready to turn a corner. But last Saturday, TCU exploded out of the gates to a 30-0 lead at the end of the first quarter en route to the 50-7 demolition of Texas. The game showed a large talent gap between the two schools and marked the first time TCU had beat Texas in two straight games in decades. Overall, TCU outscored Texas 98-17 in the last two meetings. \nWhile Strong has the support of key people and boosters, an embarrassing loss to Oklahoma on Saturday could start to generate a little more heat on Strong. \nIf Texas loses to Oklahoma and drops to 1-5 on the season, the first winnable game for the Longhorns may not come until Halloween when Texas travels to Iowa State. Strong will likely need victories over Iowa State, Kansas, and possibly West Virginia and others to keep his job for another season. \nESPN reported that multiple sources with the program said the key for Strong at this point is for his team to show progress this season with all of the young players on the field. \n\"They understand there are growing pains,\" a source told ESPN. \"Barring something catastrophic, he is on solid ground to return next season.\" Read or Share this story: http://kvue.tv/1Le7Ezd TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:38:59.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
