The party workers alleged that the BJP-led Union Government had failed to control rising prices of essential commodities. The agitated activists gathered at Rajeev Bhavan and took out a protest march, which was led by Uttarakhand Pradesh Congress Committee (UPCC) chief Kishore Upadhyay. The workers raised slogans and burnt an effigy of the Union Government at Clock Tower. The Congress leaders also set up a stall to sell pulses and vegetables at cheap rates. Expressing his views, Upadhyay said the BJP-led NDA Government had failed to check the increasing prices of essential commodities since it was voted to power in the country. Prices of pulses, vegetables, condiments etc had increased manifolds in the past one year. Modi has befooled people of the country by promising to check the rising prices but since taking over the office, he had done nothing. In stead, the prices of essential commodities had sky rocketed, making it impossible for the common people to manage two meals for their families, Upadhyay alleged. Jot Singh Bisht, Lal Chand Sharma, Bala Sharma, Mahesh Pratap Singh along with hundreds of Congress workers took part in the protest.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:10:14.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
