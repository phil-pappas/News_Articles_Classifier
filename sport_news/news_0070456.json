Madonna finished the game 2 for 4 for 116 yards -- the two touchdowns giving North Hall a 15-0 lead midway through the second quarter. \nMeanwhile, the Trojans run game did much of the rest, grinding its way to 111 yards -- led by 62 from Kyle Bacus, who also had a three-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. \nPlacekicker Chris Dennis also helped North Hall pull away, drilling three field goals -- 23, 22 and 26 yards -- all in a row, as the Trojans sealed their first shutout victory since the 2011 campaign. \nNorth Hall will play host to Buford next week at The Brickyard in Gainesville.
