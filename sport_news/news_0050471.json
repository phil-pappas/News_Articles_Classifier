The leave is standard in officer-involved shootings.\nThe deputies responded to the 18000 block of Southwest Shaw Street to investigate an attempted suicide and encountered Jepsen holding a knife, the sheriff's office said.\nAt some point, one of the deputies fired non-lethal rounds at Jepsen, the sheriff's office said. When that didn't work, at least one of the deputies fired his gun and hit Jepsen with at least one lethal round, the sheriff's office said in a statement.\nJepsen died later at an area hospital.\nSgt. Bob Ray, a sheriff's office spokesman, declined to release further details pending the outcome of the county district attorney's office investigation.\n-- Everton Bailey Jr.\nebailey@oregonian.com\n503-221-8343; @EvertonBailey", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/evertonbailey"], "published": "2015-10-09T22:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T02:12:42.877+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
