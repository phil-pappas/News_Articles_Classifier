But such remains the aspiration of the Carolina RailHawks, who entered their match against the Jacksonville Armada Saturday night at WakeMed Soccer Park at the bottom of the NASL table but still mathematically alive for postseason play. \nThe RailHawks did their part, swamping the Armada 3-0 thanks to a brace plus assist from Nazmi Albadawi, the assertive attack of Tiyi Shipalane and RailHawks returnee Daniel Jackson, and uncharacteristically stout defending. \nOne win out of 11 matches brought long-awaited alterations to the RailHawks’ starting XI. Steven Miller, a loanee late of the Tulsa Roughnecks of USL, got the start at right back. Alex Perez, a 24-year-old Spaniard, earned the nod at holding midfield for his RailHawks debut. And with leading scorer Nacho Novo serving a red card suspension, Daniel Jackson—hero of the RailHawks’ 2014 U.S. Open Cup win over the LA Galaxy—returned to Carolina after completing his 2015 campaign with the Charlotte Independence. \nA back-and-forth first half broke open in the 35th minute. After driving into the box, midfielder Albadawi played over to Shipalane stationed just outside the area. Shipalane took a touch before skimming a right-footer past Armada goalkeeper Miguel Gallardo to put Carolina ahead 1-0. The goal is Shipalane’s sixth this season to go with eight assists. \n“I thought I played it a little behind Tiyi, but he’s a big-time player,” Albadawi said. “He took a touch and banged it in.” \nThe RailHawks doubled their advantage in the 41st minute. Shipalane played a pass ahead to the streaking Jackson, who got behind his Armada defender before crossing to a sliding Albadawi in the goalmouth. Ball found boot for a 2-0 lead. \n“The ball got out wide, and I took a risk,” Albadawi said. “It was a great ball by DJ across the goal, and it was good tap in.” \n“I always look to make hard runs in the box,” he continued. “Coach talks to me about emulating Frank Lampard … and one thing I always notice about him is every time the ball is out wide, he’s bombing into the box. That’s one thing I’ve been trying to improve, getting into the box every time.” \nCarolina added one for good measure in the waning minutes of regulation. Accepting a ball up the left flank from Kupono Low, Albadawi drove past the shipwrecked Armada defenders before burying his brace to account for the final tally. \nWhile Albadawi earned Man of the Match. the pacey combination of Shipalane and Jackson gave Jacksonville fits all match. \nRailHawks manager Colin Clarke was effusive in his praise for all three newcomers. \n“[Miller] looked like he had been playing [right back] for six months ,,, Alex is a very, very good player. I thought he controlled the game tonight, and he’s someone we’ve been [needing] for a while. He makes people around him better. DJ stretches defenses and runs in behind, and some of his play was very good tonight.” \nThe RailHawks (7-8-11, 29 pts.) earn their first victory since September 4, and in the process dig themselves out of the basement of the NASL fall and combined standings. Meanwhile, the Armada (7-6-13, 27 pts.)—playing without starters Pascal Millien, Shawn Nicklaw and Mechack Jerome, all away on international duty—remain winless on the road for their 2015 season. \nCarolina has a short turnaround before its next game this Wednesday, a vital match against fifth-place FC Edmonton in Cary. The RailHawks sit four teams and five points behind the final NASL playoff berth with four games to play. \nFor Albadawi, the RailHawks are still have one particular aim in mind. \n“Playoffs,” he flatly states. “If we win every game, why not?” \nBOX SCORE \nLINEUPS CAR: Fitzgerald; Miller, Scott, Tobin, Low, Pérez (Anderson, 90’), Albadawi, Hlavaty (Osaki, 75’), Shipalane, da Luz (Engel, 76’), Jackson JAX: Gallardo; Ortiz (Krizanovic, 74’), Hrustic (Flores, 62’), Bahner, Trejo, Perea, Scaglia, Castrillón (Hoyos, 70’); Barrett, Johnson, Keita \nGOALS CAR: Shipalane, 35’ (Albadawi); Albadawi, 42’ (Jackson); Albadawi, 90’ (Low) JAX: -- \nCAR: Perez (67’); Fitzgerald (88’) JAX: Johnson (83’); Flores (90’) \nEJECTIONS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:53:58.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
