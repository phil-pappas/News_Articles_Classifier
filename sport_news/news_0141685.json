I hope my alma mater UK stomps UofL by 50 in basketball and in football this year. Those will be great days. This news is not worth celebrating though- mostly because of the misguided young women and young men involved. LMAO October 2, 2015 at 7:36 pm | Permalink \nYeah, its only the LEAD STORY on ESPN…… LOL intheshadow October 2, 2015 at 9:12 pm | Permalink \nThank you Ed. This is NOT funny or a laughing matter, except to children that do not understand the consequences. We should all hope that there is not an ounce of truth in any of it. For those of you that do not know or understand the word ‘compassion’, you need to look it up.

Please Be True October 2, 2015 at 5:14   \nThe Communists over at UofL’s State Run Media will try to have you taken off the air now. Guess the players were worried more about getting the D’s up instead of their L’s. Appomattox Troy October 2, 2015 at 5:16   \nI don’t like Louisville but, I hope it’s not true.

Please Be True October 2, 2015 at 5:20   \nHopefully Man-Boobs Jurich with his Moe Howard haircut will have to climb up a ladder and take down a banner or two. \n“Destination Job” Historian October 2, 2015 at 5:22   \nThis shaping up to one of the best stories to ever break out of Louisville or at least since the Sypher episode Please Be True October 2, 2015 at 5:27   \nYes, let us not forget. Ricky convinced a woman to have an abortion (murdered a human life). But it’s okay Ricky. It was only a 15 second mistake. Lol October 2, 2015 at 5:29   \nUofl only gets 4 star kids. This chick must have been bad at her job. Every top recruit that visits uofl ends up at Puke, Kansas or here. Makes me wonder if they are swinging and missing on good players, what are the elite schools doing to get these kids. Uncle B.S.

Hhahahahahahahalolololololololo Reality October 2, 2015 at 5:49 pm | Permalink \nCould it be that there are no U of L trolls on here? Could it be that homers just accuse someone of being a troll if they something the homer disagrees with? No, never happens! What’s funny is that the homers never have anything good to post about their own program but break records posting when UL is mentioned! Must suck to get your only positives from another program.

If the story is true I’m pretty sure the person cheering and hoping that it did indeed happen is actually a notch below the folks who carried it out.

Ricky Three Stacks here for a new invention that will revolutionize the art of vacating wins and Final Four appearances. Velcro Banners. Velcro Banners are easy to apply, just take off the protective covering, stick to the back of the banner and to the front of the surface to hang the banner, and wallah! You have an easy to remove piece of history in case of NCAA sanctions meaning that Andre McGee, the prostitute loving director of basketball operations self were guilty as sin but Tom Jurich, wink wink, decided you were too good for business. \nNo more cherry pickers, no more having to get the janitor to walk the cat walk. Just use the include free pole to grasp the bottom of the banner and gently tug to allow the vacated piece of cheating lore fall to the arena floor. \nVelcro Banners. Get yours today!

Track Record October 2, 2015 at 6:00   \nListening to the press conference and Turtleneck Tom just said that Ricky wouldn’t condone this type of thing. AND….that Ricky has a terrific track record. Holy smokes folks! KT October 2, 2015 at 6:24 pm | Permalink \nBy “track record” he probably was referring to his taste in classier girls like Ms. Sypher. Oh wait, saw her picture again, never-mind. That’s a ludicrous statement all around. UncleRon October 2, 2015 at 6:06   \nI hate to say it, but nothing will come of this… Consider the source. LMAO October 2, 2015 at 6:08 pm | Permalink \nWho?

WithinReason October 2, 2015 at 6:27   \nThis is clearly not true. The University of Louisville would never condone such behavior and stands behind its long standing tradition of protecting women and common decency.

Sad thing is I think I’m going to buy that crap just to check it out. mark w October 2, 2015 at 10:05   \nL’ville will probably get busted real quick on this one and yet with all the stuff in North Carolina program had going on with fake classes has quietly disappeared from media and they will get off with no punishment.
