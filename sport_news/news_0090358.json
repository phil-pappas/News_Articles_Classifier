The Skyhawks, under former NFL great Randall Cunningham, are 3-1 this season. So are the Wolves, and both teams have beat Palo Verde.Silverado beat the Panthers 13-7 in overtime, while Basic won 31-23 in regulation.Not having to go to overtime leads Basic cornerback and wide receiver Deondre Ishman to believe his Wolves will win tonight’s matchup.“It's a good game, but I feel like we're the better team,” said Ishman. “We're the dominant team, because I've seen the stats, they went to overtime, we're not going to overtime, so we're going to have to show them that we're really the team to beat this year.”The Wolves are coming off their first loss of the season and are hungry to get back on track, especially before opening league play next week against Green Valley.“Once you get a win, then your team is on a streak, then everybody is hot, then you feel like you're on fire, can't nobody beat you,” said Ishman.Highlights from this game and several more from across the Las Vegas Valley will be on Operation Football on News 3 starting at 11:20 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T05:47:42.326+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
