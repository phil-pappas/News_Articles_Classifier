But he said it might make more sense to go with Las Vegas because the Western Conference already has two fewer teams. \nJacobs says he doesn't \"know if there's a will\" among the existing owners to expand. \nThe NHL took applications for expansion franchises this summer and got two bidders. The Quebec Nordiques moved to Denver in 1995 and became the Colorado Avalanche. A team in Las Vegas would be the gambling city's first major pro sports team. \nBoth cities have already built areas in the hopes of landing a team. NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman has said there is no definite timeline for expansion. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
