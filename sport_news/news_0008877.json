Puskar, AP Gene J. Puskar, AP As much as Ben Roethlisberger might want to strap it up against his former coach, it doesn't appear likely the Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback will return from an injured knee Sunday.\nAdChoices Big Ben has been out since suffering a sprained medial collateral ligament and bone bruise Sept. 27. He did participate in some seven-on-seven drills Wednesday, but CBS Sports' Jason La Canfora reported Thursday that the team has \"no expectation he plays this weekend at this point. Oct. 25 remains possible.\"\nThe Steelers will host the Arizona Cardinals and coach Bruce Arians, Roethlisberger's offensive coordinator from 2007-11, this weekend. The Steelers said Arians had retired following the 2011 season, an account he still disputes. He was hired by the Indianapolis Colts as offensive coordinator in 2012, won coach of the year honors while filling in for Chuck Pagano and was named to the Cards' top job in 2013.\nSunday's game will clearly be meaningful to all parties.\n“It’s hard to watch when you really want to be out there,” Roethlisberger said Wednesday. “I’m just trying to be the best on-the-sideline guy I can be. I don’t want to be overbearing because Mike’s been doing this for a long time and he’s a real pro. I’m just here to help him in any way I can.”\nNFL Network reported that Roethlisberger's injured battery mate, sidelined center Maurkice Pouncey, needs additional surgery on his ankle.\nMore injury news from Thursday:\n— Atlanta Falcons wideout Julio Jones (hamstring/toe) is probable for tonight's game at the New Orleans Saints.\n— Indianapolis Colts quarterback Andrew Luck (shoulder) continues to throw without restrictions according to The Indianapolis Star's Zak Keefer .\n— New York Giants wideout Odell Beckham was held out of practice as he continues recovering from a hamstring issue. His teammate, cornerback Prince Amukamara, could miss a month with a pectoral injury.\n— It appears as if Oakland Raiders defensive end Justin Tuck's season is over (chest).\n— A groin injury kept Jacksonville Jaguars RB T.J. Yeldon out of practice.\nPHOTOS: Week 6 games ranked by watchability\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "https://twitter.com/zkeefer/status/654683143975243776", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/JasonLaCanfora/status/654696660358983680"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:50:01.160+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
