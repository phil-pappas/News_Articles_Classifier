The kids all believed that on any play we could score.” \nCaney Valley opened its point-letting on a 60-yard touchdown pass play from Hines to Troy Gagan. \nThe Trojans would own the lead the rest of the way. \n“Troy made a good catch and run,” said Fogle. “From then on, our offense pretty much controlled the ball.” \nHunt scored twice on aerials from Hines, and finished with 73 yards receiving on four catches. \nCooper Eden also snared a touchdown toss from Hines. Hines also scored Caney Valley’s only rushing touchdown. \n“Right now, we’re kind of running by committee,” said Fogle. \nZane Calvert gained 32 yards on two carries and Garreth Nichols powered to nine yards on the ground. \nBut, the Trojans did most their damage through the friendly skies. \nAlthough Gagan — who gained 112 yards on 10 receptions — drew some special attention from the Cougar defense, Fogle praised the work of all his receivers. \n“We found other kids that stepped up and made plays,” he said. “I was pretty pleased that we’re not one-dimensional.” \nBrandon Fogle hauled in eight catches, Eden fingered five receptions and Hunt made four snags to broaden the Trojans’ passing threat. \nOn the defensive side, the Trojans “stepped up and played the run well,” said Fogle. “We started tackling better this week.” \nCaney Valley also turned to its special teams for a big play — a 42-yard return by Gagan, which set up a short touchdown drive. \nNext up, Caney Valley plays host Thursday to Chelsea, which is coming off a loss to Nowata. \nCaney Valley 38, Oklahoma Union 14 \nCaney Valley 6 24 0 8 — 38 \nOklahoma Union 2 0 12 0 — 14 \nCaney Valley stats \nHunter Hines 16-57 (1 TD), Zane Calvert 2-32, Troy Gagan 1 -9, Garreth Nichols 6-9. \nPassing \nHunter Hines 21-31-0-262. \nReceiving \nTroy Gagan 10-112 (1 TD), Logan Hunt 4-73 (2 TDs), Brandon Fogle 8-32, A.J.
