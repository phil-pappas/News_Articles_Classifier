Its starting price was EUR 10.000.\nThis stamp was issued in 1858, at the same time with the Bull’s Head stamp with the face value of 54 parale. These stamps are extremely rare. Only 6,016 stamps were issued, of which 3,691 were sold.\nThe Bull’s Head stamps are so valuable because they were the first stamps to be issued in the Romanian principalities, and thus represented an important step towards Moldova’s independence from the Ottoman Empire. The bull’s head was the Principality of Moldavia’s coat of arms.\nThe Bull’s Head stamp with the face value of 54 parale was also sold at the auction for EUR 4,750. It had a starting price of EUR 3,500.\nThe auction had total sales of EUR 47,000, the awarding rate reaching some 80%.\nOne of the most valuable Romanian stamps, on sale at auction.\nIrina Popescu, irina.popescu@romania-insider.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:17:57.580+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
