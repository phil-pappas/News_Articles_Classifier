I was very proud of what I accomplished.” \nTo put the feat in perspective: Never in the history of the WIAA state tournament — girls or boys — has an individual from central Wisconsin won a Division 1 state title in singles or doubles. \nUntil now. \nThrow in the fact she didn’t lose a set the entire season, and Luetschwager, daughter of Mark and Jean, put together one of the all-time individual seasons in state history. \nMany of her teammates who witnessed Luetschwager put up one straight set win after another all season, were on hand to celebrate the state title with her. \n“It’s really kind of mind-boggling to go through the entire season, especially with the schedule we played against a lot of top players, to not lose a set is unbelievable,” SPASH coach Gary Baier said. \n“I had tears in my eyes at the end,” the coach added. “It was an exuberant time for all the players and coaches, and very emotional. It builds on itself with each match and when it finally happened, there was a huge outburst of emotion.” \nThe first time Luetschwager heard she was a bright-eyes, pony-tailed sixth-grader just being her career. \nThe information left an immediate impression on the future SPASH standout. Luetschwager let her intentions be known to whomever would listen that she wanted to win one of those some day. \n“I didn’t know if I was thinking realistically or if it was ever going to happen, but ever since then my goal was to win a state championship,” Luetschwager said. \nBefore she could think about the championship match, Luetschwager had to get past Homestead’s Katya Mikhailenko, who was part of a state champion doubles team a year ago. \nIn keeping with her performance all season, Luetschwager strolled into the title match with a 6-2, 6-1 win. \n“(Emily) was to girls tennis what Aaron Rodgers is to football,” Baier said. “Everything about her game (at the state tournament) was outstanding. She played extremely smart and controlled the tempo.” \nBy the time she reached the title match, instead of being nervous, Luetschwager found a comfort level, helped along by a friendship and a familiarity with Sysouvanh. \nHaving faced and beaten the Sun Prairie player several times on the USTA Junior summer circuit, Luetschwager knew what her game plan needed to be in order to continue that success. \nShe followed the blueprint to a tee and can now call herself a state champion five years after first learning about the possibility. \nAnd she will be back to defend that title. \n“I’m just going to enjoy this one,” Luetschwager said. “It’s amazing, I can’t even explain what I’m feeling. It’s just very exciting and I’m glad I had the opportunity (to play for a state championship).” \nIn Division 2, Newman Catholic sophomore Laura Larrain also had a day to remember. \nLarrain officially took her place on the state podium for the first time after grabbing a fifth-place state finish in singles. \nShowing grit and determination, Larrain battled back from losing the opening set to claim a thrilling 3-6, 6-0, 6-1 comeback win over Kenosha St. Joesph Catholic Academy’s Olivia Czerwonka. \nLarrain, who concluded her season at 23-5, opened the day with a convincing 6-1, 6-4 victory against Rachel Anderson of Racine Saint Catherine’s in the consolation bracket. \nScott A.
