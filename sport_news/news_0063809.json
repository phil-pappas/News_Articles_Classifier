(Photo: Christopher Hanewinckel, USA TODAY)\nColts quarterback Andrew Luck will miss his second consecutive start when Indianapolis faces the Houston Texans on Thursday night, according to a report from ESPN's Adam Shefter .\nLuck sat out last week's game against the Jacksonville Jaguars with an injured shoulder. He had not missed a game in his four-year career before the injury.\nLuck has not participated in a legitimate practice since suffering the injury even though he was listed as a limited participant in the Colts' two workouts earlier this week. Those two practices were more or less walkthroughs, with the team giving players a chance to recover physically before the quick turnaround against the Texans.\nThe Colts beat the Jaguars in overtime Sunday with Matt Hasselbeck starting. He completed 30 of 47 passes for 282 yards and a touchdown in the victory. Hasselbeck is expected to start against the Texas, though he has been hospitalized with an illness this week.\nSitting Luck could be the best long-term decision for the Colts. The team will have 10 days before their next game against the New England Patriots at home on Oct. 18.\nBow Wow makes his NFL Week 5 picks.
