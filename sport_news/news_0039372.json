I’m pretty lucky. It makes my life easier when I know we have a bullpen that’s capable of doing something like they did today. That’s a damn good (Jays) team. That’s the best offence in baseball and to be able to keep them in check a little bit like that is a big, big plus for us.”\nSlugger Adrian Beltre, who didn’t play again due to his back injury, sang the praises of his teammates, as well.\n“That’s something that we’re used to,” Beltre said.\n“Those guys in the bullpen, they’ve been lights-out all of the second half (of the season). They are a big part of what we have right now and a big part of what we want to do.”\nRoss Ohlendorf struck out the side in the 14th after Texas had taken the lead, Jake Diekman and Shawn Tolleson each fanned a pair in their two innings, Sam Dyson was strong again and the only minor concern was maybe with young Keone Kela, who gave up a monster home run to Jose Bautista, then got crushed by Josh Donaldson, though the ball went foul. He also walked a batter. He hasn’t been as dominant as he was down the stretch, when he failed to surrender an earned run for a couple of months.\nBut, overall, the bullpen has now pitched nine of this series’ 23 innings, surrendering only a single run in that time. That’s a major reason why the Rangers find themselves in a great spot.\n“Each one of those guys comes in and is willing to go multiple innings,” said Game 1 starter Yovani Gallardo.\n“I think it’s very important for us to have those guys come in here and be able to throw up those zeros. We felt confident with each and every guy coming in.”\nBut the Rangers refuse to get over-confident, where the big picture is concerned.\n“By all means, it’s not over, just because we’re up 2-0. It really doesn’t mean anything,” Gimenez said.\n“They can strike and strike quick ... It’s nice to be able to go home and have the crowd on our side and be in a bit more of a friendly environment for us. But still, it’s one game at a time. It’s no time to stop. We need to continue to press and put the pressure on these guys.”\n“It’s not over, for sure,” added Beltre.\n“Those guys have a great offence on the other side.”\nBLUE JAYS, TOO\nToronto’s relief pitchers had nothing to be ashamed of, either.\nWhile starter Marcus Stroman was superb, youngsters Roberto Osuna and Aaron Sanchez were effective out of the bullpen, Brett Cecil (now lost for the season) was strong and Aaron Loup delivered.\nMark Lowe wasn’t great, but didn’t allow any runs, while LaTroy Hawkins gave up the winning runs but had some bad luck and an unfavourable instant replay call hurt him.\nToronto’s bullpen allowed six hits and two earned runs in its seven innings.\nGimenez was impressed.\n“You have to give a lot of credit to both teams’ bullpens,” he said.\n“They came in and shut the door. Two of the better bullpens, I feel, in baseball right now.”\nHAMILTON’S HORROR\nOne-time superstar Josh Hamilton has been having a brutal time of it for Texas.\nHe went 0-for-6 on Friday and is now 0-for-27 in the post-season since 2012.\nSince rushing back from injury, Hamilton has hit just .184 (not including the playoffs), with two home runs and four RBIs. It’s a significant drop in play for Hamilton, who clearly is still not 100% after missing most of August with a bad left knee.\n“I wouldn’t have (rushed back) if we weren’t making a push for it,” Hamilton said earlier this week.\n“If it were May or April, I probably would have taken a little longer. It’s still pretty sore.”\nHamilton is playing though, in part because the sting of two World Series losses — one with Texas down to its final out to win it all — still burns.\n“It fuels the fire. That close a couple of times some players aren’t fortunate to even get to the playoffs, much less the World Series. It does fuel the fire, unfinished business,” he said.\nBELTRE HELD OUT\nStar Rangers third baseman Adrian Beltre was once again unable to play due to a sore back, but his fill-in, rookie Hanser Alberto, came through in a major way on Friday as Texas won Game 2 of the ALDS 6-4.\nWith the game squared at four in the top of the 14th inning, Alberto — who only had 99 at-bats all-season and is playing out of position — singled home Rougned Odor with what turned out to be the winning run.\n“Alberto hasn’t been given a lot of chances, but when he gets out there, he gives you good at-bats and he is one of those guys where you feel confident,” Beltre said after the game in a happy Texas locker room.\nBeltre said he was giving Alberto tips from the dugout. The rookie would glance over throughout the game.\nWhat did Beltre, a four-time Gold Glove winner, tell him after an early error gifted the Jays a run?\n“It’s the game, it happens.”\nCatcher Chris Gimenez was impressed with Alberto’s composure.\n“Obviously, this offence, you can’t give them any extra outs and, thankfully, we were able to kind of stop the bleeding from there (after the error) and keep it a tie game as long as we did, before he was able to get a big, big hit for us,” Gimenez said.\nIt is unclear whether Beltre will return to the lineup in Game 3 in Arlington on Sunday night.\n“I don’t have status right now,” was Beltre’s response when asked about his status.\nHe said his back was “all right,” but couldn’t say whether he would be good to go.\nBefore Game 2, Texas manager Jeff Banister said he could see Beltre playing soon.\n“He’s going to continue to get worked on and I’m never going to count Adrian out of anything,” Banister had said.\n“Toughest guy I’ve ever been around on a baseball field, so can’t count him out of anything.”\nBeltre took swings off of a tee during the game and looked ready to enter as a pinch hitter at one point, which was also the case in the opener, though Banister opted to leave him out.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nMLB PLAYOFFS\nRed-hot Rangers bullpen shuts down Blue Jays batters\nBy Ryan Wolstat , Toronto Sun First posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 12:44 AM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 10, 2015 01:14 AM EDT\nIn large part, the Rangers can thank the team’s scorching-hot bullpen for Friday’s 6-4, Game 2 win over the Blue Jays.\nStarter Cole Hamels was decent, allowing four runs in his seven innings, but once he left the game, the relievers were brilliant, giving up only two more hits the rest of the way, with nine strikeouts and only a couple of walks allowed.\n“I have to give our pitching staff credit,” catcher Chris Gimenez said.\n“They did a phenomenal job of making big pitches in big situations and they’ve really been doing that for the last couple of months.
