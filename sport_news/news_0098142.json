(By: Andy Shupe) (Credit: NWA Democrat-Gazette) \nTonightâ€™s game \nWHERE Wildcat Stadium, Springdale \nRECORDS Fayetteville 6-0, 3-0 7A-West; Springdale Har-Ber 5-1, 3-0 \nRANKINGS Fayetteville No. 1 overall, No. 1 Class 7A; Springdale Har-Ber No. 4 overall, No. 3 Class 7A \nKEY PLAYERS Fayetteville: QB Taylor Powell, Jr., 6-2, 200; RB Luke Rapert, Sr., 5-9, 170; WR Tyson Morris, Sr., 6-2, 193. Springdale Har-Ber: QB Fuller Chandler, Sr., 6-1, 205, RB Luke Hannon, Sr., 5-10, 190, WR Trey Smith, Jr., 5-7, 155. \nThat's life in the 7A-West Conference, where even a victory against the two-time defending Class 7A state champions has to be put on the back burner by Springdale Har-Ber (5-1) in order to prepare for the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette 's overall No. 1 team. \nFayetteville (6-0, 3-0 7A-West) has averaged 61.0 points in its three 7A-West victories against Fort Smith Northside, Fort Smith Southside and Springdale. The Bulldogs are led by junior quarterback Taylor Powell. Powell, 6-2, 200 pounds, has passed for 1,681 yards and 24 touchdowns in 6 games. \n\"They're one of the top offenses in the state,\" Wood said. \"You'll have to go with them and Pulaski Academy. Greenwood is right there.\" \nFayetteville Coach Daryl Patton said his team's mentality is to play hard and fast, and the Bulldogs have done that through six games. \n\"The kids have been playing really well,\" Patton said. \"We don't have a lot of time to sit there and dwell. We're on to the next game.\" \nSpringdale Har-Ber senior quarterback Fuller Chandler, 6-1, 205, has guided the Wildcats to their own 3-0 start in the 7A-West and has passed for 1,138 yards and 14 touchdowns. \n\"He's a very talented kid,\" Patton said. \"He's got a live arm. He can make all the throws.\" \nWildcats senior running back Luke Hannon, 5-10, 190, has rushed for at least 100 yards in all three of his team's conference games, including 185 yards and two touchdowns Friday against Bentonville. \n\"He's a talented kid,\" Wood said. \"He does all the stuff from the tailback position, then we put him in the slot. He creates matchup problems. He understands the principles of what we want to do.\" \nFayetteville owns a 6-4 edge in the series and won 44-14 at home last season. Patton expects another tough game tonight. \n\"Har-Ber is a very good football team,\" Patton said. \"They're well-coached. We've had some battles over the years. It should be a great game. \n\"If I wasn't coaching, I'd buy a ticket to go watch. It will be a fantastic atmosphere.\" \nSports on 10/16/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:08:09.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
