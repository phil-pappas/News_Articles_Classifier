(He has played in only 46 April games but has 14 goals.) \nLast year, he had no goals but four assists in his first four games. Voracek finished with 81 points, tied for fourth in the NHL. \nIn 2013-14, Voracek had no goals and three assists through the first nine games. \nThe slow start hasn't seemed to bother Dave Hakstol, the Flyers' first-year coach. \n\"Jake and his linemates are playing the right way and the points will come - they are great players,\" Hakstol said. \nVoracek was candid when asked to grade his performance through the first four games. \"I would say C-plus,\" he said. \nHe doesn't feel that teams are keying any more on him than in the past. \"It is hard every game, no matter who you play against,\" he said. \"I know if I am on top of my game, I can dominate. That is the bottom line.\" \nAnd he feels it can happen at any time, even in October. Breakaways \nHakstol wasn't ready to announce who will be his goaltender on Tuesday. Steve Mason missed the last two games because of a medical issue involving his family and Michael Neuvirth has stepped in and recorded consecutive shutouts, by 1-0 against Florida and 3-0 against Chicago. \"It's a little early,\" Hakstol said about the decision.. . . \nForward R.J. Umberger, who missed the last two games with an upper-body injury, practiced full-tilt on Sunday but said he hasn't been told whether he would be in the lineup on Tuesday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:40:10.227+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
