The game was back and forth, where each goalie made key saves to keep the game even under some very wet conditions. The Knights were still without several starters who were out with injuries, had a few playing with injuries and managed to take the draw. The Knights faced an out-of-area opponent from Canisius, a state-ranked team. As with the Brighton game, the Knights failed to score any goals after the seven-goal outburst against Batavia. This game offered some good midfield play from both teams, and senior Matt Kaiser nearly gave Sutherland the lead with a powerful free kick from just outside the Canisius box, which rattled off the crossbar with just a few minutes remaining in regulation time. Both teams had their opportunities, but neither was able to get the game winning goal. After 100 minutes of play for the second game in a row, the Knights finished 0-0. The Knights will face Aquinas at 7 p.m. Oct. 3 at the Sutherland Turf field.
