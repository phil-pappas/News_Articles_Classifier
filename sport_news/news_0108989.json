(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- Saturday morning's Class 4, District 6 cross country meet featured a Kansas City Invasion. Raymore-Peculiar topped Lee's Summit West to win the girls' team title, and the two swapped spots to finish second and third in the boys' division. Only the Webb City boys managed to break through the logjam at the top of the standings. The Cardinals, paced by second-place finisher Bristol Hargis (15:53.18), slotted four runners in the top ten to best Lee's Summit West 25-31. Hargis and overall winner Tyler Musgrave of Raymore-Peculiar were no more than a stride apart down the final 200-meter stretch; however, the Webb City senior couldn't make up the deficit. CLICK HERE FOR PHOTOS OF THE MEET While Musgrave had planned to stick with Hargis and the other lead runners, the win and finishing time came somewhat as a surprise for the junior. Musgrave's 15:51.46 was nearly 28 seconds better than his previous best of 16:19\"I was just going to stay with the top pack and try to hang on as long as possible,\" Musgrave said. \"I started kicking on the downhill leading to the finish and was able to hold him off.\" For Hargis, the faster pace at the start may have siphoned away a typically strong kick.\"The plan was to chill in fourth-ish or fifth-ish until the mile, then make a move and win it,\" Hargis said. \"But I didn't have the move in me. We went back-and-forth basically the entire time and just stayed shoulder to shoulder all the way to the finish. That last mile was cooking.\" Webb City coach Dustin Miller wasn't surprised by the outcome and hoped it would fuel Hargis in the meets yet to come.\"At two miles, I thought Bristol would win,\" Miller said. \"I knew, coming in, Musgrave ran really well in track season, and I knew Lee's Summit had two or three guys capable of running up there. I'd say that's probably a blessing in disguise today and a little motivation for him.\" As for the team title, Miller was a bit surprised, given the stiff competition presented by the Kansas City schools.\"Our plan today was just run our race,\" Miller said. \"This is basically a home course for us and they had to come in to our turn this year. I knew that if Ryan Riddle got where he should today, and our pack just did its job, then we'd have a good chance to come out on top.\" Hargis (2), Ryan Riddle (4), Grant Miller (7) and Tadd Capron (9) joined Nixa runners Mitchell Dotson (5) and Blake Procell (10) to litter the top ten with Southwest Missouri runners. The area girls, on the other hand, weren't quite as fortunate. Runners from Kansas City schools shut the Ozarks out of the top 12 spots, and were it not for Joplin's Estrella Arreola and Meggi Augustosky, the rout would have extended to 15. Raymore-Peculiar's Kami Tabor and Kiley Deain finished one-two in 18:31.75 and 18:36.18, respectively. Despite not running on the Nixa course this season, the two seemed right at home.\"The plan was just to go out and have fun, run our race and do our best,\" Tabor said. \" We ran the course yesterday, so we knew what was coming up, which direction to go and where to turn. We helped each other out during most of the race and talked through it, so it was really a lot of fun out there. \" The duo, along with fourth-place finisher Miranda Dick, highlighted the Panthers' push for the title. Raymore-Peculiar head coach Jay Johnson cited a loose, low-pressure atmosphere and senior leadership as key characteristics driving his team's win.\"Our plan today was to surge coming out of each of the curves,\" Johnson said. \"I've got four seniors out of my top seven that have done this before, so I really didn't have to tell them a lot. They know this is the last three meets of the season; time to giddy-up and go.\" The area team qualifiers were highlighted by Joplin's third-place finish in the girls' division, and fourth-place results from both Nixa squads. CLICK HERE FOR FULL RESULTS OF THE GIRLS RACE Eagles head coach Lance Brumley was pleased with Nixa's results, highlighted by Amanda Parker's effort in the girls race. Parker was caught in a tie-up at the start and lost one of her shoes. Rather than stop, The Eagles senior pushed on and completed the course in 20:39.64 ... all with only one shoe.\"Everybody ran about the race that we thought,\" Brumley said. \"One of our boys, a sophomore boy, ran a fantastic race. Brendan Fusco really stepped up ... and then the courage of Amanda Parker to run virtually the whole race with one shoe. That was pretty impressive. We knew we would have to run well, but we practiced this week with the idea of moving on so we can peek next week at sectionals.\" The Class 4 Sectional race for the area will be held next Saturday in Camdenton. Team and individual qualifiers from District 6 will compete with the District 5 qualifiers for a shot at the state championships. Boys Overall - Sectional Qualifiers 1.
