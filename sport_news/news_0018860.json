Tyrod Taylor and LeSean McCoy both practiced for the second consecutive day Thursday, increasing the speculation, if not the possibility, that the two offensive stars could play in Sunday’s match-up with the Cincinnati Bengals.\nAdChoices Both players, listed as limited, reportedly took part in warm-up drills with the first-team offense during the portion of practice when reporters were present. Taylor later broke off with the quarterbacks to work on position-specific drills.\nIt was reported that Taylor suffered a sprained MCL during last week’s game as a result of a horse-collar tackle, so if he were able to play it would be an arguably incredible development. McCoy, meanwhile, has missed the past two games with a nagging hamstring injury, so his return would be less of a surprise.\nBills head coach Rex Ryan, either in an act of gamesmanship or an expression of his actual belief, said he wouldn’t rule out Taylor starting Sunday, praising his quarterback for having “heart” and “toughness.”\nTaylor, after practicing Wednesday, followed his coach’s lead and acted as if he fully expects to play Sunday.\n“That’s the plan,” he said, via the Buffalo News . “Working hard to get back out there and taking it day by day.”\nTaylor, wearing a brace during Wednesday’s practice, insisted any lack of mobility won’t prevent him from being productive, although it might limit him to being more of a pocket passer.\n“Yes, I believe I can complete any pass from the pocket,” he said. “And I’ve only taken off a couple times this year. I’m confident in moving the ball from the pocket. That doesn’t change.”\nWhen asked Wednesday if he’s going to play, Taylor deferred to the decision-makers who presumably will have the final say.\n“That’s up to the coaches.”\nThe return of McCoy to the lineup obviously would be a huge boost for the Bills in a showdown with the undefeated Bengals. And if Taylor could somehow start Sunday? Given the bleak nature of his reported injury, it would definitely be a surprise, no matter what Ryan or Taylor are saying.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://bills.buffalonews.com/2015/10/14/will-tyrod-taylor-play-on-sunday-thats-the-plan/", "http://espn.go.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/183857/bills-tyrod-taylor-lesean-mccoy-practice-again-thursday", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.sportressofblogitude.com/2015/10/14/rex-ryan-i-would-not-rule-out-tyrod-taylor-starting-this-week/"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:45:13.182+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
