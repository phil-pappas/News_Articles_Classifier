He'll be joined by fellow seniors Isaiah Cousins and Ryan Spangler, who also started all 35 games for Oklahoma a year ago. \nIowa State may have a new coach in Steve Prohm, but Georges Niang, Jameel McKay and Naz Long are seniors with high expectations. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T21:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T21:52:53.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
