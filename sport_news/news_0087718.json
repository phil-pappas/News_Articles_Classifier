Terry asked tough questions, and Pitino answered (most of) them firmly. Pitino doesn’t plan on stepping down, and he didn’t sound like he was planning on missing any games. It was a strange interview, but a MUST LISTEN. It’s one of those interviews that will be talked about for years to come. Almost Midseason Grades and Miscellaneous Rankings , Freddie Maggard Quarterback: B Overall, the junior has been an offensive catalyst. Kentucky has scored 16 touchdowns. Patrick Towles has directly contributed for 11 of those. For some, this grade will be too high. But his 68 percent total touchdown contribution rate is too high for a C, and his sporadic play doesn’t warrant an A. Strip the name, read above stats and assign a grade. That may help. Enjoy your bye weekend, guys. \nArticle written by Mrs. Tyler Thompson No, I will not make you a sandwich, but you can follow me on Twitter @MrsTylerKSR or email me . 8 responses to “UK Fans of the Day Want The Week’s Best Posts” WeareBBN October 9, 2015 at 11:13 pm | Permalink | Reply \nVerbal RB commit Benny Snell had 16 carries for 182 yards and 3 touchdowns. Also caught a td pass of 18 yards. Really hope Stoops can keep this kid. Think Gunner Hoak had a good game although his team lost, will try to get his stats. WeareBBN October 9, 2015 at 11:47 pm | Permalink \nDon’t have all of his stats but Gunner threw three 1st half touchdowns, one from 34 yards, one from 24 yards and ones from 23 yards. His team was up 35-16 starting the 4th quarter and lost 48-42 in overtime. WeareBBN October 10, 2015 at 12:09 am | Permalink \nGunner Hoak completed 19 of 30 passes for 302 yards and three TDs with no picks. His team was up 42-24 with 6:38 left and gave up 18 points then lost in OT. WOW. QB for other team had 5 touchdowns and completed 33 of 49 passes for 388 yards with 1 pick. Sounds like a fun High School game to watch.
