Below are the highlights from Aggies' head coach Kevin Sumlin.\nOn Kliff Kingsbury/Bret Bielema feud...\nSumlin: I talk to Kliff, shouldn't surprise anybody since we spent five years together. Did a great job for us here and at Houston. What is going on between those two guys is going on between those two guys.\nWhat to expect from Arkansas...\nSumlin: For us, this is the beginning of conference play. That's the reality of it. Nothing has changed from our point of view of how we feel about or view Arkansas. As the first game of the SEC and playing where we play, it is going to be a big time atmosphere and a game that both of us need to win.\nState of SEC West...\nSumlin: It's not for me. I go through everything week to week, [media] told us who would win at the beginning of the year. We weren't in that conversation; all we are doing is play every week. I don't set up a board and rank the SEC West every week.\nHas anything changed since playing Arkansas last year...\nSumlin: We made some changes defensively, schematically, and philosophically. Our approach in the offseason has been different and our approach to what we do during the season has been different.\nWhen you go through what we went through last year. Starting the season 5-0, have the drop off we had in the middle, come back and win a couple big ball games, my job is to be assessing where the program is all the time. The things that aren't working, we need to figure out what the issue is. We did some research and looked at where we were at depth wise. We feel better about where we are from a depth standpoint defensive line and linebacker wise. Offensive line is the same way.\nRight or wrong, what you have to do is look at where you are and be honest. Whatever we did last year... I think our guys feel better and feel fresher, we will see going forward.\nProgression of Arkansas QB Brandon Allen...\nSumlin: Brandon has been a good quarterback. He's one of the few guys last year that really had a low interception to touchdown ratio. He's been efficient as a quarterback. A lot of what they do comes off a great running game and a big offensive line. In my opinion they have one of the best tight ends in the country, he's been fabulous the last couple years.\nThey have weapons. They've had some issues in the red zone the last couple weeks but he isn't turning the ball over. He was good last year and he's better this year.\nA&M Kicker Taylor Bertolet...\nSumlin: Over the course of the last two or three years, he's worked and had the chance to mature both physically and mentally which is to be expected. You'd hope he's not the same as he was when he was a freshman. Same with [punter] Drew Kaser. He was a guy who redshirted and had a hamstring problem, now he's leading the country.\nHe was three of three on field goals, five extra points, and seven touchbacks. That's not a good performance, that's a great performance. Outstanding effort by him last week.\nNew Adidas Commercial...\nSumlin: It was an opportunity with Adidas who has been a great partner with us and the athletic department. They called and asked if I wanted to do it, they said Sammy Watkins, Jimmy Graham, DeMarco Murray and myself would be in it, and I said okay.\nIt was during the Summer in LA. When you have a chance to expose and promote the Texas A&M brand, it does nothing but help us. Adidas has been a great partner with us and hopefully continues to be.\nFor the entire press conference video, click here\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://youtu.be/_Qyw1WQGt4w?t=157", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Qyw1WQGt4w", "https://youtu.be/_Qyw1WQGt4w?t=4", "https://youtu.be/_Qyw1WQGt4w?t=413", "https://youtu.be/_Qyw1WQGt4w?t=64", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland", "https://youtu.be/_Qyw1WQGt4w?t=534", "https://youtu.be/_Qyw1WQGt4w?t=118", "https://youtu.be/_Qyw1WQGt4w?t=787"], "published": "2015-09-23T03:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:51:50.392+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
