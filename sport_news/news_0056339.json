Brian can win because the style favors him. Chocolatito’s style is perfect for Brian and that’s his advantage. There will be no running, it will be all face-to-face action.” \nTeam Viloria will leave for New York on Sunday, one week before the showdown at Madison Square Garden on October 17, the same day that Nietes defends his title for the 8th time against Mexican champion Juan “Pinky” Alejo at the StubHub Center in Carson City, California in the inaugural US presentation of ALA Promotions, also starring undefeated IBF Intercontinental super bantamweight champion Prince Albert Pagara, his elder brother WBO No. 2 light welterweight Jason and unbeaten IBF Youth champion Magsayo. \nThe “Pinoy Pride 33” fight card will be telecast on Oct. 18 over ABS-CBN Channel 2 with five-division world champion Nonito Donaire doing the commentary with Dyan Castillejo.
