(what they're saying) Calvin Pace, Tom Brady New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady passes over New York Jets outside linebacker Calvin Pace during the second half of a game Sunday in Foxborough, Mass. (Charles Krupa | The Associated Press) \nThe New York Jets have a new head coach and fresh talent. \nThe New England Patriots have the old Tom Brady. \nThat's still a bad matchup for Gang Green. \nThe Jets played well enough to beat the Patriots on Sunday, but they didn't. \nAnd the reason for that is almost exclusively Brady. \nSteve Serby of the New York Post calls him New York's S.O.B. As in, Same Old Brady. You can steal Darrelle Revis away from Bill Belichick, you can bring in a bright defensive mind for a head coach and admire how he has instilled discipline, you can add the best player in the draft to your would-be New York Sack Exchange II...and Tom Brady simply does not give a damn. So, if you are going to turn into the Same Old Jets in the final 15 seconds after recovering an onside kick and have the game end on a Brandon Marshall false start without getting to clock the ball to attempt a Hail Mary, if Marshall is going to drop a touchdown pass early in the fourth quarter and cost you four points, you may insist on believing you've closed the endless gap between you and the Evil Empire, but there is still a gap, and there will forever be one until Tom Brady grows old. If he ever does. \nHere's a sampling of some of the other buzz from the game: The final indignity came on the final play of a game that the Jets should have won. A penalty and subsequent 10-second runoff capped a series of fourth-quarter mistakes and questionable clock-management decisions in the Jets' 30-23 loss to the Patriots Sunday. The divide between the undefeated reigning Super Bowl champions and Todd Bowles' team isn't cavernous, but the Jets made Bill Belichick's and Tom Brady's jobs a lot easier with a few late assists on a day when it appeared that the Jets would topple their division rivals. — Manish Mehta, New York Daily News The Jets replaced Rex Ryan with Todd Bowles, and they exchanged Ryan's hyperbolic pregame bluster for Bowles' blunt, businesslike approach. But they were up against the same old Bill Belichick and Tom Brady, whose grip on the AFC East is timeless. For three quarters, the Jets did almost everything right on their way to taking a four-point lead. The Patriots' No. 1 offense didn't even attempt to run against the Jets' No. 1 defense, and quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick played as if he went to Harvard for a PhD in game management, controlling the clock, scrambling for first downs and converting big third-down passes. But when the clock rolled over to the fourth quarter, Brady again made the plays that beat the Jets, 30-23. — Greg Logan, Newsday In his first season as coach of the Jets, Todd Bowles continually suggests an intriguing philosophical question about survival in the N.F.L.: When does just another game became more than just another game? Answer: in Foxborough, against the defending champions. The Jets failed an important midterm exam Sunday, becoming the undefeated Patriots' sixth victim with a 30-23 loss. Sticking to the \"another day, another game\" line he frequently invokes, Bowles said he was frustrated by Sunday's loss, but not because his team lost to New England. — William C. Rhoden, The New York Times Revis' return to the Jets has helped them close the talent gap on the Patriots. In fact, the Jets' overall roster from top to bottom is just as good as New England's — except, of course, at quarterback. The Jets have tried to compete against Brady for the last 15 years with Vinny Testaverde, Chad Pennington, Brett Favre, Mark Sanchez, Geno Smith and now journeyman Ryan Fitzpatrick. It just doesn't work. The gap between Brady and all those Jets QBs is too huge. — Gary Myers, New York Daily News But make no mistake: These Jets have the Patriots' attention. They had it before the game and they had it for 60 minutes Sunday while they were dictating so much of the play, leading 20-16 halfway through the fourth quarter....Though they did not talk publicly about it, because that is not the Bowles way, the Jets quietly believed they were ready for prime time, that they have closed the gap between themselves and the Patriots to the point they are ready to finally wrest the AFC East title away from them. — Mark Cannizzaro, New York Post", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:23:04.988+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
