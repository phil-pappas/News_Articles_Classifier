The proposal next goes to the full City Council.\n\"There's a lot of language that exists already,\" Tokowitz told the committee, \"but not a lot of people know how to use it.\"\nTokowitz, on behalf of Design for America (DFA) — an award-winning nationwide network of interdisciplinary student teams and community members — approached officials earlier in the year with the group's idea.\n12-year-old Glencoe activist pushes for, gets change Daniel I.

Dorfman) Knowing that bicycle safety is an important issue in Evanston, the students proposed a pilot program to enhance communication.\nThe program would test the use of custom road signage that displays to cyclists and automotive drivers the cycling hand signals, Tokowitz said, bringing a sample sign to the committee's September meeting.\nTokowitz told the committee that the student group's research indicates that miscommunication between cyclists and automobile drivers at intersections result in collisions.\nHe said research by his group of 100 cyclists in Chicago and Evanston showed as many as half of the cyclists in some cases failed to use the cycling hand signals to convey their intentions at intersections.\n\"Automobile drivers who rarely cycle are even less likely to know what these signals mean,\" he said in his presentation.\nOne computer rendering of one of the group's signs shows a cyclist with hands in different positions, denoting left and right turns, along with a hand gesture, indicating the cyclist was slowing down.\nCity officials are definitely interested in teaming with students on the project, Ylda Capriccioso, the city's bike programs coordinator, told the committee.\nCity promotes bike safety, theft prevention at Evanston event Bob Seidenberg Judging by the number of cyclists lined up outside the Robert Crown Community Center on Thursday, the coming of shorter days won't dim their bike habits.\nBike owners formed a line in the parking lot outside the community center, 1701 Main St., to take part in the city's \"Pedal Bright\" bike light...\nJudging by the number of cyclists lined up outside the Robert Crown Community Center on Thursday, the coming of shorter days won't dim their bike habits.\nBike owners formed a line in the parking lot outside the community center, 1701 Main St., to take part in the city's \"Pedal Bright\" bike light...\n(Bob Seidenberg) Since the passage of a bike plan update earlier in the year, she said, city staff has been using numerous education and outreach techniques to improve road etiquette, she said.\n\"The pilot is a simple and unique idea that would support the city's efforts and provide valuable information about effective ways to communicate to the community,\" she said in a memo to the committee.\nTo coordinate, she said, staff would need to determine the best locations along one route near campus, where a temporary sign could located.\nCosts associated with the program would run less than $200 for the sheet metal to print the signs, she said.\nbseidenberg@pioneerlocal.com\nTwitter: @evanstonscribe\n Northwestern University Evanston", "external_links": ["http://www.trbimg.com/img-561429d9/turbine/ct-evr-bike-safety-tl-1008-20151006", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561a6c06/turbine/ct-evr-bike-pilot-tl-1015-20151009", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-560a9956/turbine/ct-gln-green-bay-trail-tl-1001-20150928"], "published": "2015-10-10T01:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:16:44.646+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
