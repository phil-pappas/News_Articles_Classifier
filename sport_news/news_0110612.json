He called the incident ''degrading.'' \nSchwanke-Kasten Jewelers owner Thomas Dixon told WISN-TV the incident was a misunderstanding over Henson's vehicle. Police had asked employees to be on the lookout for certain types of cars, he said. \nWhitefish Bay Police issued a two-page statement detailing the department's recent interactions with the store and Henson. It said the department had advised the store to call police if a Red Tahoe like Henson's arrived after one parked outside the store days earlier raised suspicions that its plates were stolen. \nHenson said in his post that the car was part of an endorsement deal with a Chevrolet dealer. \nThe statement said the officers were dispatched to the store Monday afternoon ''as the Red Tahoe had returned.'' The officers talked to Henson then requested that the employees open the door, it said. \nThe officers who questioned Henson never asked for his ID and left the area after the store reopened, according to the statement. \nThe Bucks released a statement Monday afternoon calling the incident ''very troubling.'' \n''Nobody should be treated that way. We are trying to contact the store directly,'' the statement said. \nHenson was the 14th overall pick out of North Carolina in 2012. He signed a four-year contract extension with the Bucks earlier this month. 0", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T06:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:11:14.906+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
