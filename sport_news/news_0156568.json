(Curtis Compton/Atlanta Journal-Constitution/TNS) Check out Doug’s Week 5 College Picks \nBy DOUG GUNDLACH College/Pro Football Analyst By DOUG GUNDLACHCollege/Pro Football Analyst \nHeart breakers, big scores and blowouts were the theme of last weekend in college football. The Pac 12- blew out everyone else in the Pac- 12. TCU and Texas Tech are still scoring! \nAnd the Tennessee Vols once again blew a double digit lead in the fourth quarter. And once again they failed to come out on top in “the biggest game of the Butch Jones Era.” What a difference a month makes. Remember four weeks ago when I said that this was the season that the Vols and Jones made leaps and bounds and made a push for the SEC title? Remember in that same paragraph I told you to hold off on the parade and set the glass of Butch Jones Kool-Aid down for just a moment? Well now you can take that glass and all but dump it out. At least, for this season. I feel like if the Vols can manage to win 8 games, which is still a strong possibility, that Butch will keep his job and get one more chance to build a powerhouse. \nWith Georgia and Alabama still on their schedule, I’m going to take my chances, after what I’ve seen in the fourth quarter against Oklahoma and Florida, and pencil those in as losses. Can you blame me? Tennessee has scored 17 points in 2 second halves and an overtime in those two losses. And the last couple of drives that the Vols had against Florida with the lead were hard to watch. \nThe Vols have run into a problem that I don’t think anyone thought about at the beginning of the season. Josh Dobbs can’t throw the ball very well. And worse yet, his receiver can’t catch the ball very well. The Leading receiver for the Vols has 98 yards. Total! In 4 games. The leading receiver in last week’s game, was Josh Dobbs! The Vols have lost all confidence in themselves. Especially in the fourth quarter. \nI think Butch Jones is safe, for at least this year, but a collapse of epic proportions, i.e. losing to Kentucky and Vanderbilt or Missouri and Arkansas. As well as my penciled in losses to Georgia and Alabama. Basically losing more than four games this year is going to be an even bigger disappointment than it already has been. That kind of sloppy finish can make the Knoxville brass maybe think about going in another direction. I don’t think it happens. Now on to this weekend. \nAlabama at Georgia -2 \nThis game is historic on a couple fronts. First, it’s the first game, as of right now, which the Crimson Tide will be underdogs in a game since 2009. 72 games if you’re scoring at home. So that is a pretty big deal. But on a much bigger front, this game may be the biggest of Mark Richt’s career. (I’m throwing a lot of “biggest games” around these days. Oh well.) \nAnd if you have read my articles over the last couple of years, you know how I feel about Mr. Richt and big games. But I have a funny feeling about this team, and this game in particular. Although, it gives me pause for anyone playing a Nick Saban led underdog team. \nThe Georgia offense, even though they haven’t played the stoutest competition, has looked pretty much as close to perfect as you can get. Grayson Lambert has miss two passes in the last two games. That’s impressive no matter who you are playing. The Alabama Crimson Tide have a soft secondary and their defense as a whole has been good, but they haven’t been as good as I once thought before the season started. So the Bulldogs have a chance to get on top at home and really make a statement. \nAlabama are the measuring stick for the SEC. No matter their rank, if you beat Alabama, you have made it in the SEC and the Bulldogs have already made it, but they have a chance to ascend all the way to the top. The Alabama offense has been hit or miss and Coker has looked rather pedestrian against Wisconsin and Ole Miss. \nThe Georgia defense hasn’t been the most dominating defense, but it’s a bend but don’t break defense starting with their linebackers, Leonard Floyd and Lorenzo Carter, who will have to play a big role in stopping that vaunted Alabama running game. \nThe same can be said for the Alabama defense, who have only allowed 56 yards a game on the ground. Expect that number to go up, win or lose with Nick Chubb and company on the field. For most people predicting the outcome of this game, it will be close and a slugfest till the final seconds. That’s not how I am going to call this one. I’m going against the grain, as bad as I may look come Sunday. \nI think the game is a good game for almost three full quarters. I think the lead changes hands two or three times throughout the three quarters. Then the flood gates open, a costly turnover, a huge special teams play and some clutch offense, and the Georgia Bulldogs open up a lead and hold on to it in the fourth quarter for a huge win for the program and Mark Richt. I expect a lot of offense and some giant exciting plays from both teams. \nGeorgia 38 Alabama 27 \nThe Rest: (14-13-2 against the spread this year) \nTennessee bounces back nicely against a reeling Razorbacks squad 27-20 (Tenn -6.5) \nFlorida shows grit and guts as they upend/upset Ole Miss in the Swamp 24-21 (Florida +7) \nTCU scoring continues against a punch less Texas team 55-21 (TCU -15) \nBaylor beats Texas Tech in the biggest over under number in Vegas History 62-49 (Over 90.5) \nLSU pounds Eastern Michigan, I take another sip of the Fournette Kool-Aid 52-3 (LSU –A LOT) \nMTSU beats Vanderbilt at home, Derek Mason’s seat is boiling! 34-28 (MTSU -2) \nClemson gets signature win, as injuries finally catch up to Notre Dame 42-24 (Clemson Pick) \nUpset of the week: Hawaii takes down Boise State on the blue turf 34-31 (Hawaii +24.5) \nCheck back next week, I’ll have my first College football playoff rankings as well as my first Heisman picks.
