As well as Rodgers departure, Sunderland manager Dick Advocaat announced he was stepping down in the same role at the Stadium Of Light... Two managers in one day, the Premier League is nothing without it's drama! \nA section of Liverpool supporters and football fans in general slated the decision as the timing seemed a little harsh after gaining a hard-fought point at Goodison Park. However, in all honesty, many could see the writing had been on the wall for Rodgers for quite some time. \nRodgers joined the Reds in the summer of 2012 taking the reigns from club legend Kenny Dalglish, which is a task in itself! And ever since Liverpool's consistency has gone through a yo-yo effect. \nThe 2013-2014 season typified this effect under Rodgers. He had guided them towards virtual touching distance of winning their first ever Premier League trophy, a feat which would have put him in Kop folklore, and maybe even in contention for a bronze statue. \nThe amazing form of Luis Suarez coupled with his devastating partnership with Daniel Sturridge, alongside the emerging Raheem Sterling, had propelled Liverpool to the summit of the league. It was the fairytale season the fans had been dreaming of for so many years and everything was in place. Cue then captain and Liverpudlian hero Steven Gerrard eating his very words (literally) by slipping at a crucial moment and a allowing Chelsea's then striker Demba Ba to put the early celebrations on hold. The resulting 2-0 loss had suddenly sent very cold shivers down Anfield spines. \nThey then faced the task of keeping their advantage at the top by beating a sturdy Crystal Palace. Things were going swimmingly until palace decided to give title-rivals Manchester City some hope by staging one of the best and most dramatic comebacks in recent history by rallying back from 3-0 down to draw 3-3. The scene that all 'Pool fans can sympathise with was the image of Luis Suarez crying devastated tears under his shirt while being cradled by Gerrard. \nTaking that almost teasing season away, Rodgers has virtually nothing to boast about looking back at his Anfield career. A style of play that plenty of times left supporters feeling frustrated (given that was mainly due to a lack of killer instinct in front of goal and a seemingly at times vacant defensive structure, but nevertheless), no silverware and failed signings, expensive at that! \nMany people will point out that he did lead Liverpool to a successful season during the aforementioned 2013-2014 season. However, others will also say that Suarez was showing his true quality and looked to have almost carried the team to the top and within touching distance of the league trophy. Since that season the Uruguayan has been sold to Barcelona for £75 Million, as well Sterling sold to Manchester City (rather ironically) for a British record fee of £49 Million, and Sturridge is only just resuming his full fitness. So, that's a lot of money made, but not much to show for it. \nSome state that a lot of the blame lies with the current owners. Continually criticised for failing to tie players down to fair and decent contracts highlights that maybe there is a problem deep within the club and not just stemming straight from the manager's hot seat. \nSpeaking of managers, the same board will be looking to appoint Rodgers successor and the media have already chosen their favourite in former Borussia Dortmund coach Jurgen Klopp. \nThe German is currently a free agent after leaving the Signal Iduna Park at the end of last season. A firm fans favourite while at Dortmund he guarantees you at least one thing, charisma...or should I say, character, perhaps? \nMuch like Jose Mourinho was in his first stint as Chelsea manager (just without the arrogance), he is a media darling. The press love him and even if he was to come under fire at any point, he could just smile and tell one of his quirky jokes and they would be putty in his hands again. \nYou could say Liverpool have a missed a truly energetic manager since the days of Bill Shankly and would welcome someone with same fire as the man that help lay the foundations for the club we see today. \nA great admirer of English football, he was once quoted speaking on Arsenal and their free flowing style of play under Arsene Wenger, stating they were like an orchestra and he was their conductor whereas his dortmund side were more like a heavy metal band. \nHe takes great pride in being the underdog. At Borussia he had a limited budget, but that didn't stop him guiding his team to two Bundesliga titles in three years and a Champions League final, where they were beaten by the team that stripped them of Mario Gotze and Robert Lewandowski. \nHe loves the sheer power and grit determination English football possesses, despite it not maybe being shown over recent years. He does not hold back from less than admirable conditions and would chose a gritty goal fest on a mud-laden pitch than a 3-0 drubbing on a hot summer's day on a carpet-like pitch. \nThere is something that every English football fan with love about that sentiment and even the most stubborn Liverpool fan could shed a tear of respect for Klopp's views. \nWhatever happens, Liverpool are sure for a rocky ride this season with possibly more thrills and spills along the way!
