Terming the raids on the CM’s residences on the day of her daughter’s wedding as “political vendetta of the worst order”, the Congress leaders sought the protection of the President for the safeguarding of a democratically elected Congress government in the state. Led by Himachal Congress president Sukhwinder Singh Sukhu on behalf of the party organisation and minister Vidya Stokes on behalf of the legislators, the delegation told the President, “This is the first time in the history of the country that both the CBI and the ED raised a sitting CM’s residences on the same day. That the CBI rushed to register an FIR in an inconsequential case pertaining to the income tax returns of the CM and later even raided his residences clearly shows that the government misused the CBI for their political vendetta.” The delegation comprising all 36 Congress MLAs (minus CM Virbhadra) including 12 ministers, four independent MLAs, 17 district Congress Presidents and all Congress general secretaries and vice presidents, got together in a rare show of unity today to “condemn the misuse of central investigation agencies by the ruling BJP and its politics of vendetta and vengeance”. The delegation submitted a four-page memorandum to the President accusing the BJP of exhibiting “undue haste in sending the CBI after the six-term Congress CM”. The memorandum questioned the CBI case on Virbhadra at a time when his IT return case was sub judice and was pending before the Delhi High Court, several IT appellate tribunals and even the Supreme Court of India. The memorandum further recalled that this case was first raked up on the eve of 2012 Assembly elections in Himachal by senior BJP leader Arun jaitley “with the sole objective of preventing the Congress from coming to power in the state”. “Earlier also, false and fabricated cases have been made out against Virbhadra Singh but he has come out clean,” the memorandum states, and adds, “The action of the Central investigation agencies besides being inhuman and uncalled for is designed to defame and disgrace the CM and to destabilise the democratically elected government in Himachal.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:02:34.027+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
