Image 23 of 23 Amity edges Shelton in girls soccer 1 / 23 Back to Gallery \nSHELTON — Shelton had more scoring chances, but Amity had more goals. \nTuesday’s big SCC girls soccer match boiled down to that simple fact, as two second-half goals by senior Alexa Gibbs made the difference in the Spartans’ 2-1 victory over the Gaels at Finn Stadium. \nGibbs scored with 25:59 left to break a scoreless tie and netted her second goal just over two minutes later, making it 2-0. Shelton answered with 12:18 remaining thanks to a perfectly placed header by junior Sarah Skoronski, but the Spartans’ defense didn’t budge down the stretch. \n“Once we got the first goal, we didn’t give up,” said Gibbs, who won a one-on-one battle with a defender and buried a shot past goalkeeper Shelby Offord for the match’s first goal. “We just kept going.” \nAmity improved to 5-1-5 (3-0-2) and took over sole possession of first place in the SCC’s Housatonic Division, while Shelton dropped to 5-2-3 (2-1-2). \n“It’s a big statement for us tonight,” Amity coach Owen Quigley said. “This is one of our biggest rivals. Tonight was probably the best we’ve played this year. … There’s never many goals against each other, but tonight we took our chances. \n“We got tired in the end and they came at us hard, but it’s a huge, huge win for us tonight.” \nAlthough the Gaels controlled the possession for significant stretches in each half and finished with a 13-7 edge in shots, the Spartans’ defense was quite unforgiving. Sophomore Abby Allen made several big stops in goal and finished with seven saves. \n“I think we executed our game plan fairly well,” Shelton coach Marvin Miller said. “We played a pretty solid 80 minutes, and in the end we gave up a couple of mistakes that cost us goals in the second half.” \nAlready trailing 1-0 in the 57th minute, the Gaels turned over the ball deep in their end and watched Gibbs unleash a shot that skipped along the damp turf. As Offord reached down to corral the shot, the ball snuck past her for much-needed insurance goal. \n“It was like outside the 18 (-yard box). I just used the turf to my advantage,” Gibbs said. “It’s a wet surface, and if the ball’s on the ground, it’s going to skip. It just skipped under her.” \nThe Gaels aggressively pushed forward with hopes of knotting the score following Skoronski’s goal off a cross from Kathryn Arena, but time and again they came up empty. One potential equalizer sailed just inches over the crossbar, and a few other quality shots were snared by Allen. \n“We didn’t finish our chances,” Miller said. “We had plenty of chances. We had more chances than them, and we just didn’t finish them. That’s really the story of this game.” \ndbonjour@ctpost.com; @DougBonjour \nSHELTON 0 1 — 1 \nRecords: Amity 5-1-5; Shelton 5-2-3. \nScoring: A — Alexa Gibbs 2g , Kaitlyn Price 1a, Emma Gehr 1a; S — Sarah Skoronski 1g, Kathryn Arena 1a.
