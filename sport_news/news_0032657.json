(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The Pleasant Hope Lady Pirates advanced to the Class 2, District 6 Championship with a 10-7 win over Richland in Pleasant Hope on Thursday.“As a team, we had a rough start but we were able to pull together as a team and were able to pull out a good win,” Pleasant Hope pitcher Ellie Lane said. “It took a little while to get started, but overall I think we did well against a good opponent.” The Pleasant Hope offense produced two big middle innings to push the Lady Pirates into the title game. The team put up four runs in the bottom of the third and three in the fourth to put them on top for good. It was Lane in the circle for the Lady Pirates, allowing seven runs on seven hits with seven strikeouts and seven walks. Offensively, Lane went 2-for-3 with a double and one run.

Defensively we need to step it up; we had five errors and only five hits.” Shelby Richardson led the Pleasant Hope offense, scoring all four times she reached base. She hit 1-for-1 with two walks and one hit by pitch. Nichole Mosley went 1-for-3 with a triple and a walk, scoring twice. Richland got things kicked off with a double by Brittany Latham in the top of the first inning. A single up the middle by Jessi Whittle scored Latham and put the Lady Bears on the board. But Whittle struggled early on the mound, walking the two leadoff hitters for Pleasant Hope on eight straight balls. A costly error scored Mosely and one more run put the Lady Pirates up 2-1 after one inning. After Pleasant Hope got up 6-3 in the bottom of the third, Richland responded by loading the bases. Whittle put one on the ground toward third base, but Taylor Pepe scored on an overthrow to home plate. A Lane strikeout stranded three batters and got the Lady Pirates out of the inning with minimal damage. The Lady Bears were able to make another run at the lead in the fifth, putting up three runs to come within two, but Pleasant Hope blanked the Bears in the final two innings and took the victory, 10-7.“We played with a lot of heart and a lot of passion,” said Richland coach Mark Schneider. “I feel like the girls came and played like I knew they could.” Richland squared off with Pleasant Hope after defeating Lamar 8-7 in the first round of the tournament. With the loss, the Lady Bears finished their season 8-14, but will begin next season with more confidence and all nine returning starters.“You want to end the season on a high note and I feel like we did that this year,” Schneider said. “Looking to the future, our girls will remember these games and that they did well and that will give them confidence going forward, just knowing they can do it.” Pleasant Hope, now 15-11, will move on to the District Championship 1 p.m. on Saturday. As last year’s State runner up, the Lady Pirate team hopes to repeat their District title and bring home State gold.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T09:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T10:54:46.968+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
