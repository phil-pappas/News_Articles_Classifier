We stay competitive. Even though the score might be, like, 7-0, we still play our hearts out. We play to the whistle.\"\nDon't misunderstand Osoria. He does not take kindly to losing.\nBut he also understands the situation, and respects the way the young, inexperienced Pirates have responded.\nMerrillville graduated 16 seniors from last season's team, its best in recent years. And everyone associated with the program anticipated a rough 2015, if not this extreme record-wise.\nThrough the trials and tribulations, Osoria has endured, staying upbeat and encouraging teammates.\n\"The big thing I've been happy with him, knowing that he was going to go from having such an experienced group to play with to such an inexperienced group, his attitude has remained the same,\" said 19-year coach Brian Past, who guided the Pirates to back-to-back state finals appearances in 2001 and '02. \"He still comes out every day and practices hard. We've had some lopsided games, but he's still out there like it's a tie ballgame.\n\"Instead of hanging his head, or mailing it in, he shows up every game and practice, and tries to persevere.\"\nThat's one of the reasons Osoria, the team's two-time top scorer, is Merrillville's lone captain. His task was made even more challenging when the two other varsity holdovers each missed five straight games with a concussion, before returning in Saturday's tie against Hobart.\n\"It's a difficult role, my first year as captain, trying to adjust,\" Osoria said. \"I just try to keep everybody's heads up, and push them as hard as I can. I make sure they do everything correctly, and they know what they're doing wrong, and I try to help them fix it.\"\nOsoria wants the Pirates to see the results of their work, ideally this season. But he also realizes he might have graduated by the time they reap the benefits in the next season or two.\nOsoria knows what it's like to be an underclassmen learning at this level. He earned significant minutes as a sophomore, then became a starter last season, when Merrillville lost in sectionals to Crown Point in penalty kicks on the sixth shooter.\nAs a junior, Osoria led the Pirates with seven goals. This season, he has increased his production to 14 goals and five assists, surrounded by that new cast of players.\n\"I worked more on my individual skill and endurance,\" Osoria said. \"I knew I'd have to play the whole game this year, so I prepared myself for that. Just doing the little things like running extra after practice, shooting after practice, and making sure I took summer conditioning and weights seriously.\"\nSaid Past: \"You throw it around a lot, 'Leads by example.' But he sincerely leads by example on the field and off.\"\nOsoria hopes to spend at least a little more time on the field in a Merrillville uniform. Sectionals represent a fresh start for teams, including the Pirates, who open with Kankakee Valley on Wednesday.\n\"Since the first game, we've just looked for improvement from one game to the next,\" Osoria said. \"We work on the simple things.\n\"We have to keep our heads up. Soccer doesn't create character, it reveals character, and we don't want to give up.\"\nmosipoff@post-trib.com\nTwitter: @MichaelOsipoff\nBOYS SOCCER TOP 5\nResults through Friday.
