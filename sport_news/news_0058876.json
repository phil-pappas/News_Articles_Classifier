Related Links Montalvo scores 5 TDs to lead Lincoln-Way West \nOn Friday night, the Griffins’ streak continued with a 48-6 SouthWest Suburban Conference Blue victory. \nEast (5-1, 4-0) jumped to a 28-6 first-half lead on the legs and arm of quarterback Brandon Bauer. \nBauer had 18 carries for 115 yards and was 6 of 9 passing for another 90 yards in the first half. He ended with 27 carries for 176 yards and was 13 of 22 passing for 164 yards. He added two rushing touchdowns and two through the air. \n“Our game plan was designed to get me running the ball a little more tonight,” Bauer said. “If I see an opening, I’m going to take it, and our offensive line really opened up some great opportunities. All the credit goes to our ‘O’ line. We executed very well tonight.” \nAfter East started the game with a three-and-out, Lockport (1-5, 1-3) drove to the East 6-yard line, but two penalties and an incomplete pass forced the Porters into a fourth down. A fumble on the subsequent fake field goal gave East the ball. \nBauer then ran on four consecutive plays and gained 31 yards. After a 6-yard sack, Nigel Muhammad ran 53 yards for the first East touchdown with 5:24 left in the opening quarter. \nLockport scored on the next possession, as Ben Davis hit Deiondre Taylor with a 60-yard pass. The Porters’ missed the extra point but had pulled to within 7-6. \nEast came right back with a 13-play, 80-yard drive. Running back Brody Bolsoni capped it off with a 12-yard touchdown on the first play of the second quarter to put the Griffins up, 14-6. \nOn the Griffins’ next possession, Bauer hit receiver Logan Winkler with a 26-yard touchdown on the 10th play of the drive to lead, 21-6. \nAfter a Porter punt, the Griffins put together a 12-play drive, covering 66 yards, as Bauer ran the final 3 yards for the touchdown. \nEast scored on its first two possessions of the second half. Bauer had a 7-yard touchdown run and then hit Ken Anderson with a 22-yard touchdown pass. \n“We had a great effort tonight in all three phases of the game,” Griffins coach Rob Zvonar said. “We weathered the storm early and they [Lockport] are a much better team than the score indicates. I’m pleased with the effort going into next week.” \nThe Griffins travel to Homewood-Flossmoor on Friday to take on the No. 1-ranked team in Class 8A. \n“We will prepare like we normally do. We know they are who we think they are,” Zvonar said with a laugh. \nLockport quarterback Davis was 18 of 27 for 241 yards with three interceptions and the touchdown pass to Taylor. \n“Ben Davis is going to be a good quarterback,” Porters coach Dan Starkey said. “He threw the ball well tonight. East is a very physical football team and a great program. Their offensive line really took control. We just have to keep working to get better.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:43:59.469+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
