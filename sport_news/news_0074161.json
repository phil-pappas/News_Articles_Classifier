(Photo: CHRIST SCHOOL) \nFor the second consecutive Saturday, the Christ School soccer team left no doubt in a pivotal Carolinas Athletic Association game. \nCal Jansen's scored his 12th goal of the season and Riley Smith added two in the second half of a 3-0 shutout at Asheville Christian Academy. \nThe Greenies (11-0-4) are not only the outright CAA champions by virtue of the win, but the sport's last undefeated team left in Western North Carolina. Will Iorio was the goalkeeper responsible for the shutout â€” he was also in the net Oct. 13 when Christ School beat ACA at home, 3-0. \nChrist School plays Monday at Greensboro Day and then wraps up the regular season Tuesday at home against Rabun Gap (Ga.). The Greenies are the third-ranked team in NCISAA 3-A soccer. \n- Follow the HS Huddle on Facebook: www.facebook.com/hshuddle or Twitter : www.twitter.com/acthshuddle Read or Share this story: http://avlne.ws/1LD5YzG Most Popular", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T16:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T09:55:41.357+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
