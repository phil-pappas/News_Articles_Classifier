Owner Brendan Kelly and president Dave Cottle promoted Brian Reese to head coach, and one of the first discussions the braintrust had was about Mariano. \nChesapeake announced the hiring of Mariano as an assistant coach on Wednesdays. Mariano comes to the Bayhawks after spending 2Â½ seasons as assistant head coach and director of player personnel for the Ohio Machine of Major League Lacrosse. \n\"I've had long-standing relationships with Dave Cottle and Brian Reese, and I got to spend some time with Brendan Kelly during the interview process. I like what those three men stand for and their vision for the Chesapeake Bayhawks,\" Mariano said. \"Chesapeake is a franchise with great pedigree in winning three championships in six years. They understand how to win, and the opportunity to come aboard and help the Bayhawks get back to that championship level was enticing.\" \n\"Tom Mariano was one of the first people I thought of when I began the process of putting together a staff. It was kind of a priority of mine to get Tom onboard with the Bayhawks,\" Reese said. \nMariano served as defensive coordinator during his time in Ohio and Reese was impressed with how the Machine played on that end of the field. \nChesapeake is still pursuing another assistant coach and Reese said he will take into consideration that individual's strengths before determining what duties to assign Mariano.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:24:29.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
