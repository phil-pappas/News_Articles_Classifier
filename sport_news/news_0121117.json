Alvina Alston, publicist for Odom's aunt JaNean Mercer, said Tuesday that the former NBA star was transported by helicopter from Sunrise Hospital and Medical Center in Las Vegas around 5 p.m. Monday. The family statement thanks the hospital and Odom's fans and says he's making \"miraculous\" progress. The statement says he took a few steps in Los Angeles. Alston says Odom's estranged wife, Khloe Kardashian, his father and his two children from a previous relationship are with him. Odom was found in critical condition at the Love Ranch brothel in Crystal, Nevada, on Oct. 13. He regained consciousness Friday.
