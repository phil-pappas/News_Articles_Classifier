Philly put up 34 first downs and 519 total yards. Two interceptions in the end zone in the first half kept the Saints in it until the third quarter. But once the offense started turning it over, the defense had no hope. New Orleans finished minus-2 in turnover ratio in a game where they had to be plus-2 or perhaps even plus-3 to have a chance to win. \nTHE GOOD STUFF \nWell, in many ways they were two efforts that were wasted on a longshot game, but Delvin Breaux and Brandon Browner actually did intercept passes. So we’ll chalk that up as progress. I guess we can say Willie Snead and Brandin Cooks receiving numbers, but I’m not really buying that. Yes, Snead had six catches for 141 yards, but he was targeted 11 times and dropped two. With the exception of one nice deep ball, the vast majority of Cooks’ numbers were useless numbers in mop-up time. \nThe one statistic that continues to impress is the fact that the defense still hasn’t allowed an offense over 50 percent on third down. Philly was actually a combined 4 of 14 on third and fourth downs today. If that trend continues against offenses the Saints match up better with, that’ll pay dividends down the road. \nTHE BAD STUFF \nSean Payton continues to struggle mightily. While he did defer, his play-calling remains frustrating. He had plenty of chances to run the ball in the first two and half quarters and continued to test the offensive line instead. The play in which Drew Brees was sacked to get out of field goal range with the game tied in the second quarter was all on Payton. Then when he got a big pass play to get into the red zone in desperation time, he threw underneath instead of going to the end zone. He no longer has a plus-offense. He’s got to start coaching like he realizes that. \nWith that said, the offensive line continues to struggle and the defensive front doesn’t get nearly enough pressure. The Eagles also got five more first downs on penalties. It’s getting to be an epidemic. \nTURNING POINT \nIt’s awfully hard to point to a turning point in a game like that. The awful instant replay ruling that officially resulted in a fumble and gave Philly the 10-7 halftime lead was a start. Then after Philly responded with a touchdown drive for a 17-10 lead, Brees suffered another sack/fumble to make it 23-10 and the rout was on. \nLAGNIAPPE \nWith his first quarter touchdown completion to Ben Watson, Brees extended his streak of at least one touchdown pass to 40 games, good for the fifth-best streak in NFL history ... Willie Snead with 141 and Brandin Cooks with 107 yards was the first time two Saints receivers each recorded 100-yard or more receiving days since Kenny Stills and Marques Colston did it on Oct. 19, 2014 at Detroit ... Vaccaro led the team with 11 tackles (nine solo), including one tackle for loss ... registered a career-high nine tackles, including one stop for a loss. 2 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.theadvertiser.com/story/sports/nfl/saints/2015/10/11/kevin-footes-analysis-saints-loss/73797702/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:20:56.709+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
