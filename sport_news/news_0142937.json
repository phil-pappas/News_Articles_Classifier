With the catchers, we did a good job of making adjustments throughout the game whenever we had to. Just being aggressive in the zone and getting the guys to swing the bat. \n“It’s a matter of executing pitches, hitting your spots and putting it where you want to throw it. Going into those games, I had faced a lot of those guys during my career. It’s just moving the ball around. Being aggressive in the zone throwing strikes.” \nToronto has a lineup stacked with right-handed pitchers that punish lefties, which is part of the reason why the big righty drew the opening start. \n“He’s just got good pitches that break away from the big righty bats,” Texas closer Shawn Tolleson said in trying to explain Gallardo’s earlier success. \n“He’s got a deceptive angle for them. He’s got a good overhand curveball and a cutter and it keeps them off-balance.” \nAt times, Gallardo can get himself into trouble by walking too many batters, but Texas manager Jeff Banister said the righty’s ability to keep hitters guessing is also a major strength. \n“He works around the edges, he throws just enough strikes to get you in swing mode and then he can go inside on you. Or he can go away and he can also work the vertical game as well,” Banister said. \n“The one thing that you can’t do really, is sit on any one pitch.” \nGallardo also has experience on his side, having pitched in five previous playoff games, all with Milwaukee. \nBut this is a new honour for him. \n“Not very many get this opportunity to pitch Game 1 of the post-season for a team they grew up watching,” he said. \n“I’m from Fort Worth. I lived there all my life. To put that uniform on and start Game 1, it’s going to be a lot of excitement and adrenalin going on.” \nTHE USUAL \nGallardo’s counterpart on the hill Thursday will be David Price. \nPrince Fielder was asked what makes Price so tough to hit against. \n“You know, he throws 98 (miles per hour), a couple of off-speed pitches, he hits his spots. You know, the usual Cy Young stuff,” Fielder said. \nPrice will be in the running for another Cy Young Award this season, thanks to his 18-5 record (9-1 with the Blue Jays) and American League-leading 2.45 ERA. \n“He doesn’t mess around too much,” said Josh Hamilton. \n“He’s not afraid of contact. That can be good for you sometimes, or not ... He’s a tough pitcher, you want to do your best to make him work extra hard on the mound. Get some guys on base, cause a little havoc, grind out at-bats.” \nNO OVER-THINKING \nThe experienced players and managers all had a similar message ahead of Game 1: Don’t get too worked up about playing in the post-season. \n“We’ll treat this game just like all the rest of them. It’s one game, one game at a time,” Banister said. \n“It’s a statement (Pirates manager Clint Hurdle) says all the time: ‘The game doesn’t know that the game is important.’ It really doesn’t, it’s still a game. You go out and meet the demands of the game.” \nPrice told his teammates: “Don’t let it change you. Go out there and do the same stuff you always do. Post-season baseball is definitely different, but you’ve got to go out there and treat it the same. If you get caught up that this is the playoffs, you can kind of get overwhelmed with it.” \nAROUND THE HORN \nYoung Rangers standout second baseman Rougned Odor keeps a creepy-looking mask in his locker. Kind of an old, mad scientist-looking thing. Why? “I just take it everywhere,” Odor said. “It’s called the Old Man” ... Centre fielder Delino DeShields is battling the flu, but says he will play ... Gallardo on playing in a city that has experienced a long playoff drought like Toronto: “I had the opportunity to participate in the post-season in Milwaukee in 2008 (ending a span of 26 years without a post-season berth for the franchise). It’s going to be electric. I think the fans will be on every pitch. It’s going to be pretty loud in here,” Gallardo said. “The fans are excited, the players are excited. The whole country. I think it’s going to be one of the things that everyone is going to be watching. It’s going to be a fun series.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T05:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:53:37.359+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
