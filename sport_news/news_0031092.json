By Jeff Potrykus of the Journal Sentinel Oct. 9, 2015 11:03 a.m. \nLincoln, Neb. — Paul Chryst entered the interview room relaxed and confident to give a final briefing on Wisconsin's next Big Ten Conference game against Nebraska. \nAfter some friendly banter, the questions came: \nDid Chryst sense the players were suffering a hangover from the 10-6 loss to Iowa? \nIs there anything more the coaches can do to jump-start a sluggish offense? \nIs Chryst worried about the confidence of quarterback Joel Stave, who had four turnovers against the Hawkeyes? \nThe epitome of unflappable, Chryst handled the Q&A deftly and made it clear UW (3-2, 0-1 Big Ten Conference) was adequately prepared to face host Nebraska (2-3, 0-1) at 2:30 p.m. Saturday. \n\"I think they took away the lessons to be learned,\" he said, \"and we've had good energy at practice....I like where they're at mentally.\" \nAnd Stave? \n\"Joel is like a lot of guys on our team,\" Chryst said. \"He's got a great opportunity to learn from that game. And you hope as a coach you've helped him and he gets a chance this week and further down to apply it. That is the beauty of sport.\" \nThe importance of the game to both teams is undeniable. The loser will fall to 0-2 in the league and will be all but eliminated in the race for the West Division title. The winner can exhale knowing that just about anything can happen in a division that still appears to be wide open. \n\"Not every game is going to be perfect,\" Stave said. \"Not every game is going to go exactly how you want. \n\"So when it doesn't you've just got to make sure you learn from it. I thought last year's team did a great job of responding to a tough loss on the road the first week of Big Ten play. I think this team will do the same.\" \nSo much will be learned Saturday in Memorial Stadium about this UW team. \nHow will the UW players respond to the Iowa loss, a game in which the Badgers had the ball in Hawkeyes' territory eight times in 12 possessions but managed only two field goals? \n\"I think guys already got that picture,\" senior safety Michael Caputo said. \"No one is looking around, waiting for somebody to tell them that it is going to be OK. \n\"We lost to Iowa in a bit of a dogfight, and now we're going to go back to the drawing board and prepare for the next game. \n\"I feel that is how upperclassmen do it and younger guys see that. No one is looking around at each other, waiting for somebody to make a move or something like that. \n\"So I think we're on the right path.\" \nWas Stave's performance, which included eight errant throws that were out of the reach of the intended receiver, an aberration after a solid first month? Or was it the start of a slide? \n\"I think that is one of the strengths of Joel, his temperament,\" Chryst said. \"It is not different than the games we've won. There were plays he wished he would have thrown a better ball. \n\"We didn't cash in on every opportunity....Joel knows that. \n\"He knows who he is. He is poised. Even when things go bad in a game he is even.\" \nWill UW's offense be able to overcome another injury? Wide receiver Alex Erickson, who suffered a concussion in the loss to Iowa, practiced on Thursday and appears poised to play against Nebraska. But tight end Austin Traylor is out four to eight weeks after suffering a broken arm against Iowa. He has 10 catches for 156 yards and three touchdowns. \n\"Here is a guy that did everything he could to have his best season in his last season,\" Chryst said of Traylor, \"and I thought was playing at a good level and was enjoying it. That's the part you feel bad about.\" \nThroughout the week the UW players said all the things one would expect in the wake of the difficult loss. \nStave talked about learning from the mistakes made on offense. Chryst talked about everyone accepting responsibility for the miscues — missed blocks, misreads by the running backs and errant throws by the quarterback. \nListening to the players talking about preparing for Nebraska, it was difficult to detect any loss of confidence. \nAnd hearing Chryst talk Thursday night, it was easy to detect a coach eager for the challenge. \n\"I don't know when it started but what I've enjoyed about the coaching is that each week is a new opportunity,\" Chryst said. \"Even when you're rolling: 'Can you do it again?' \n\"And if you're struggling: 'Can you bounce back?' \n\"It is our job to try to help them do that. I think that is what is fun about the game.\" © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved.
