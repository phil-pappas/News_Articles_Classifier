Richard W. Rodriguez Star-Telegram i Order Reprint of this Story IRVING \nDez Bryant didn’t make the trip on the team charter to New Jersey on Friday, and it’s unlikely he plays against the New York Giants on Sunday. \nThe Cowboys left a sliver of hope that their star receiver will return to the lineup this week by listing him as doubtful, but after not practicing all week, Bryant is expected to miss his fifth game. \n“He’s got some work to do if he’s going to be able to play,” Cowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones said on his weekly radio show on KRLD/105.3 FM The Fan. “We’ll probably take a look at him when we get to the Meadowlands and make our final decision. But at the same time, we want to make sure we make the right call and know that we still have a long season ahead of us.” \nBryant worked on the side during practice this week, rehabbing his fractured right foot. He has never practiced with new starting quarterback Matt Cassel, acquired in a Sept. 22 trade with the Bills. \nHe’s got some work to do if he’s going to be able to play. We’ll probably take a look at him when we get to the Meadowlands and make our final decision. \nCowboys executive vice president Stephen Jones on Dez Bryant \nThe Cowboys list Bryant as doubtful for Sunday’s game, officially giving him only a 25 percent chance of playing. \nBryant fractured the fifth metatarsal in his right foot during the season opener against the Giants. He had surgery, which included a bone graft, on Sept. 14. \nThe Cowboys gave a six-to-eight-week timeline for his return. \nTwo weeks ago, Bryant traveled to Colorado for a procedure in which bone marrow stem cells from his hip were injected into his ankle to speed his recovery. \nNike, with the Cowboys’ consultation, fitted Bryant with a new right cleat designed to protect his surgically repaired foot. \nCowboys coach Jason Garrett said earlier in the week that Bryant is running and cutting. But Bryant has yet to return to practice. \nWhile the Cowboys, who are on a three-game losing streak, need Bryant, they also want to make sure Bryant is fully healed and in football shape. He missed all of the off-season while seeking a new contract and missed much of training camp and all of the preseason games with a hamstring injury. \nTight end James Hanna, who was limited in practice all week, is questionable with an ankle injury. He has been inactive because of injuries for two games this season. \nThe other five players on the team’s injury report, including defensive ends Randy Gregory and Greg Hardy, are probable. Hardy returned to practice Friday and was a full participant after an illness kept him out Thursday. Gregory, who has missed the past four games with a high right ankle sprain, practiced in full all week. Busy Friday \nRain forced the Cowboys indoors Friday. \nThey traveled to Coppell High School’s indoor facility, their first practice moved this year and the 16th since their indoor practice facility collapsed in a severe thunderstorm in 2009. \nAfter practice, the Cowboys left for the airport for an early departure to New Jersey. \nThe team took a chartered ferry from their team hotel in Jersey City to One World Observatory in Manhattan. They toured ground zero and enjoyed a team dinner at the top of One World Trade Center. Desperate team? \nThe Cowboys are on a three-game losing streak, but veteran tight end Jason Witten stops short of calling them a “desperate” football team. \n“Yeah, we need to get a win,” Witten said. “I feel like you’re tricking me with the desperate, but, yeah, we need to get a win.” \nWell, desperate times lead to desperate measures. \nThe Cowboys have made three lineup changes on offense: Cassel will start at quarterback, replacing Brandon Weeden: La’el Collins will replace Ron Leary at left guard; and Christine Michael will get the bulk of the carries over Joseph Randle at running back. \nYet, Witten said the mindset in the locker room is about winning one game against a division opponent, not desperation. \n“We need to go win a football game,” Witten said. “It’s a division game. To get to 3-0 in the division would be big. There’s no question it’s an important game.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T02:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T03:27:41.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
