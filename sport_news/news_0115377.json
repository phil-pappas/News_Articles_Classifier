I've shot 60 around here before,\" said Poulter, 12-times a winner on the European Tour.\n\"So albeit that I had not played a practice round but I've got good memories on this golf course. I've had a couple of top fives in the last five years around here as well. So I know the place, I like it, and hopefully I can have a good weekend.\"\nIndia's Anirban Lahiri was at six-under after a second 67 left him tied fifth alongside 2009 U.S. PGA Champion Yang Yong-eun (66), British Masters winner Matthew Fitzpatrick (67), Australian Nathan Holman (66) and England's Matt Ford (65).\nIt wasn't such a good day for world number eight Dustin Johnson, who could only muster a two-over 74 which left the American at one-over and outside the cut mark.\n(Writing by Patrick Johnston in Singapore; editing by Sudipto Ganguly )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T14:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:56:44.851+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
