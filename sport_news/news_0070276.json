I said he was unquestionable in the past and his merit is what he has done in far less time than the rest. That adds more value to what he has achieved.\"\nRonaldo's return to goal scoring form was a relief for the Portuguese and Benitez after a frustrating 0-0 draw at home to Malaga on Saturday in which Ronaldo had 14 attempts on goal.\nMadrid were far from their best in Sweden as Benitez took the chance to rotate his squad ahead of Sunday's Madrid derby away to Atletico.\nRonaldo opened the scoring just before the half hour mark with a cool finish, but the visitors had to wait until the final minute to secure the three points when Ronaldo prodded home Lucas Vazquez's cross.\nHowever, Benitez was pleased to get the three points which allowed Madrid to join Paris Saint-Germain atop Group A with maximum points from two games.\n\"The team was a lot better than against Malaga. We had 75 percent possession. We could have avoided some occasions where we gave the ball away, but those are the words of a coach that will never be happy,\" said Benitez.\n\"They started to press high and sent a lot of long balls. Anything could have happened, so it was important to get the second goal.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:26:32.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
