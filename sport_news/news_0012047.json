So it's probably worth noting his pick to win the Calder is Max Domi of the Arizona Coyotes.\nNot Connor McDavid. Not Jack Eichel.\nMax Domi.\nTo be fair, Domi's father, Tie, is one of Selanne's best friends so there may be a hint of bias in his selection. But it's hard to argue with his choice. Along with Anthony Duclair, the 20-year-old forward has been the driving force behind Arizona's thrilling, and thoroughly unexpected, 3-1 start.\n\"He's catching people off guard with his speed,\" a scout told SI.com. \"He's got that extra gear. When he turns it on, he's going to make someone look silly.\"\nDomi has used that speed to great effect in the early going, including one memorable rush where he blew past Anaheim's Kevin Bieksa to create an easy tap in for Duclair. Those wheels were on display again Thursday night, along with some of the sickest mitts in the game, as Domi crafted a likely Goal of the Year candidate.\nThe 'Yotes suffered their first lost of the season in that one, 4–3 to the Wild, but it was perfectly predictable result. Arizona was coming off a 4–0 shellacking of the Ducks the night before in Anaheim. Meanwhile, Minnesota came in off of five days of rest.\nBut it was noteworthy how much fight the Coyotes had in them, especially after twice going down by two goals. That kind of deficit would have been an ender last season when they finished 29th in goal scoring. This year, Arizona ranks ninth, thanks in large part to the seven goals that Duclair and Domi have between them. And though they couldn't quite erase the lead, there was a real sense that it was possible.\nThat's not just skill, although The Killer D's bring plenty of that. It's will. Take a look again at that Domi goal. There's so much desire in his game, and you can say the same about the other kids on their roster. That's an element that was missing from this team on too many nights last season.\nNHL Hunt for the NHL Stanley Cup infographic by Allen Kim", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@almuirSI"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:04:06.673+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
