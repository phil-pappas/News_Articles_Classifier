Comment Follow @@kyleR_sports Posted Oct. 9, 2015 at 10:00 AM After two straight uneven performances against non-conference opponents, LSU is ready to step back into SEC play this Saturday as they host South Carolina. The Tigers will bring in a 4-0 overall record and 2-0 mark in conference play. The location of the game was changed on Wednesday. The game was supposed to take place in Columbia, but due to the aftermath of Hurricane Joaquin, the game has been moved to Baton Rouge. It's similar to what happened to LSU in 2005. Their home game against Arizona State was moved to Tempe due to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. LSU will be seeking improvements. In the 34-24 win over Syracuse, the Tigers committed a whopping 14 penalties. One of those infractions negated an 87-yard touchdown run by Leonard Fournette. And in a lackluster victory over Eastern Michigan last Saturday night, the Tigers only completed four passes. Quarterback Brandon Harris and his receivers were out of sync the entire game. There were multiple dropped passes--including two that most likely would have resulted in touchdowns. The Tiger rushing attack continued its dominance against an Eagle defense ranked dead last in the country. They chewed up 399 rushing yards, with Fournette getting 233 yards and three scores on his own. He became the first SEC running back to ever run for 200 yards in three straight games. Darrel Williams added 89 yards, and Derrius Guice contributed with 34. The Tigers are now set for their second in-conference road test of the season as they visit South Carolina. The Gamecocks have struggled this year. They currently sit at just 2-3 and 0-3 in SEC play. One of the leading factors in their early-season woes has been the quarterback position. Lorenzo Nunez, Perry Orth and Connor Mitch have all seen action this year under center. Nunez has had the most snaps. The freshman is completing 61 percent of his passes with three touchdowns and three interceptions. Nunez is also South Carolina's leading rusher with 299 yards. The Gamecocks do have one of the best receivers in the SEC in Pharoh Cooper. Cooper has 26 catches for 322 yards and two scores through five games. Overall, South Carolina ranks 48th in rushing offense and just 109th in passing. LSU is not far behind at No. 123. If Harris and his receivers can turn that around on Saturday, it could mean big points for the Tiger offense. The Gamecocks are only ranked 68th against the pass as they give up 219 yards per game. Of course, the LSU rushing attack will be trying to test that 75th-ranked South Carolina rushing defense. Fournette leads the country in rushing yards with 864 through just four games. He also leads the country in yards per game with 216. Page 2 of 2 - Behind Fournette's monster open to 2015, LSU ranks fourth in the nation in rushing offense with 336 yards per game. The Tigers will attempt to maintain their undefeated record against the Gamecocks since Steve Spurrier took over as head coach. Since Spurrier took the helm, LSU is 3-0 against the Gamecocks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T20:04:42.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
