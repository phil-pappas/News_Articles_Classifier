The junior from Brooksville, Florida, is ninth individually in rushing so far in 2015 with 738 yards, and he’s averaging an FBS-best 10.3 yards per carry but has the fewest carries of any of the nation’s top 20 rushers.\nThat’s because Breida has a dexterity for the big play, perhaps more so than any other running back in college football. Breida had eight runs of 50 or more yards last season and has four such carries this season. Of his 12 career runs of 50-plus yards, 11 of them have finished in the end zone, accounting for 41 percent of his career total of 27 rushing touchdowns.\nAgainst Western Michigan, for example, the offensive line got an early push, Roscoe Byrd sealed off the linebacker closing in on the play with a combo-block, and all Breida needed to do was see the hole.\nAgainst Idaho, Breida took a step forward and almost seemed to pause, knowing the hole up the middle was about to open. When it did, he ran through it untouched and raced 83 yards to the end zone.\nMost of Breida’s 12 career runs of 50 or more yards happen like this. When you talk to Breida about these plays, he credits his patience, his ability to see the hole, and his speed that leaves defenders catching their breaths. But all the hard work comes from the offensive line.\n“You just have to trust your offensive line; that every man is going to do their job,” Breida said. “I trust my offensive line a great deal and also the tight ends and receivers that they’re going to get their blocks on the edge. If not for them, I wouldn’t have a lot of the big runs that I have.”\nBut Breida can still burn you, even when plays don’t go according to how they’re drawn up.\nSometimes, like with all offensive lines, the men up front for the Eagles will miss an assignment. Sometimes that makes no difference for Breida.\nSometimes the defense will stack the side of the field Breida is running to. That makes no difference, either.\nSometimes the wrong play is called. Forget it. He still can make six points out of nothing.\nThat was the scenario early in the third quarter against the Idaho Vandals on Sept. 26. The Eagles led 16-13, their only touchdown coming from Breida’s 83-yard dash in the first quarter.\nThe Vandals had the right formation defensively as they stacked the far side, ready for the option that was about to come. In hindsight, GSU offensive coordinator Doug Ruse said he should have had quarterback Kevin Ellison change the play at the line of scrimmage. But Breida knew what was coming.\n“They definitely had us outnumbered on that side,” Breida said. “I looked on the pre-snap and said, ‘This might be tough.’”\nReceiver BJ Johnson, who was lined up on the far side, motioned toward Ellison as he took the snap, then turned up field to throw a block. Idaho outside linebacker Chris Edwards took a step toward Ellison to force the pitch to Breida, but Edwards couldn’t recover in time to catch Breida before he turned up the field. Breida slipped through two defenders, one taking an angle from the left side, the other pursuing from behind, and nearly caused them to run into each other.\nHe used a downfield block to get to the sideline and was 30 yards up the field by the time five Idaho defenders surrounded him. The play appeared to be over.\nNot for Breida.\nWhat happened next turned a great effort into maybe the most memorable play in GSU folklore since Adrian Peterson’s “The Run” in 1999. Where Peterson plowed four Youngstown State players on his way to 58 yards, Breida eluded seven Vandals who looked surprised when he switched directions and ran the length of the field, falling into the left corner of the end zone on his last gasp. Breida made two cuts that sent him backward before he was able to turn the corner on the Idaho pursuers.\n“This is just natural ability,” McGee remarked as Breida made his trek from sideline to sideline. “Nothing I can coach.”\nThe little things\nMcGee has grown somewhat accustomed to Breida dazzling spectators with the big play. At this point, McGee just expects it to happen. Instead, he’s focused on the things that he can coach — the things that don’t come naturally to Breida. You can find Breida’s picture hanging on the window of the film room alongside pictures of dozens of his teammates, mug shots all arrayed like a list of suspects in a crime drama. Any simple mistake at practice, ranging from dropping a routine pass to missing a blocking assignment, will land a player on this wall.\n“Pass protection was probably his biggest weakness,” McGee said. “He’s gotten much better at that. I’m just trying to get him to see the bigger picture. We stress to all our backs, you have to be a complete back.”\nAnd sometimes it’s the little runs — the ones that pick up crucial first downs on third-and-2 and shrink Breida’s gaudy yards-per-carry average — that really stand out to a coach like McGee. Scarcely are those runs easy.\nAn 80-yard touchdown run can wow the fans, but to put your head forward and muscle your way 2 yards for a first down when the defense knows what’s coming?\n“That’s the kind of run you appreciate as a coach,” McGee said.\nHaving a knack\nBreida has been making the big plays since youth football, and he carried it over into high school and now the college level.\n“\nI remember my coaches told me in little league to make one cut and go, so I try to make as few cuts as possible and get vertical,” Breida said.\n“After so many years, you just get a feeling and you just get a vibe for when things are about to happen. It may not be there at first, but you just have to feel it and trust it, and it’ll open up.”\nIt came as no surprise to Breida, an unknown commodity for GSU at the time, when he took his first handoff in the 2014 season opener against North Carolina State. He lined up in a two-back formation next to Devin Scott, who was supposed to get the carry before an audible was called for Breida, who burst through the hole on the left side and raced 69 yards for a score.\nTwo weeks later against Georgia Tech, he did it again, ripping off a 69-yard TD in the first quarter. In the next two games, he added a 64-yarder against South Alabama and a 56-yarder against Appalachian State.\nHe made his career-long effort of 88 yards against Navy in the second-to-last game of the 2014 season, and he’s had runs of 87 yards against The Citadel and 83 yards against Idaho this season, giving him three runs of 80-plus yards for his career.\n“He’s one of those guys who has a knack for seeing things develop early so he can anticipate the cuts and breaks,” Ruse said. “A lot of people when they talk about Matt, they think it’s just speed, but it’s really not. He’s got the vision and he’s got the power to break arm tackles at the line of scrimmage, and then he’s got the speed to finish those runs. I think he’s the total package.\nBreida quickly showed after the North Carolina State game that his touchdown run was no fluke, and he’s showing this season that last year wasn’t a one-hit wonder.\nHe’s a specialist, and maybe even on some occasions, an artist.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/whitelabel/images/blank.gif", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14812160.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/14811912.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14811912.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/14812160.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-15T15:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T10:09:25.892+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
