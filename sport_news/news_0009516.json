Cars are supposed to be difficult to drive and those who can wheel a sliding, near out-of-control vehicle the best should deservedly excel.\nThat is the exact kind of racing that unfolded when NASCAR gave the low downforce a trial run in July at Kentucky Speedway and in September at Darlington Raceway. Drivers struggled with a lack of grip, needed to deaccelerate when corning and the result saw a considerable increase in passing and side-by-side racing. The configuration featuring a rear spoiler reduced by 3-inches among other changes, produced a Kentucky track-record 22 green-flag passes for the lead and more than doubled the amount of green-flag passes throughout the field.\nInitially, there was pushback by executives, most notably NASCAR CEO and chairman Brian France, who preferred a high-drag package that, in theory, was supposed to stimulate pack racing on intermediate tracks, of which the bulk of the Sprint Cup schedule is made up. Except when that package produced a pair of processional races where passing was largely absent , the tide turned even more so towards the low downforce rules package.\nRarely do drivers agree on much of anything, yet when it came to the direction NASCAR should go with its rule package almost universally they lobbied officials to employ the low-downforce aerodynamic package configuration as its base.\nAdamant in their belief, drivers lobbied officials publically and privately, and when Kentucky and Darlington provided substantial evidence to support their claims, NASCAR was left with little choice but to scrap the high-drag package and embrace its low-downforce counterpart.\nIf there's any downside to Wednesday's announcement it's that the lower downforce package won't be integrated until 2016 and the remainder of this season -- save for the Oct. 25 race at Talladega -- will continue to run a package that continually generated lethargic races devoid much in the way of on-track excitement and has caused a virtual revolt among NASCAR's fan base.\nBut hope is coming next year by way of a rules package that justifiably is better than any NASCAR has seen in some time. And with it is the expectation the term \"dirty air\" will become a thing of the past replaced by a package that allows a driver's talent to shine.\nYou know, how NASCAR is supposed to be.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sbnation.com/nascar/2015/7/13/8956451/brian-france-kentucky-rules-package-pack-racing", "http://www.sbnation.com/nascar/2015/7/27/9045075/brickyard-400-nascar-2015-high-drag-rules-package-indianapolis", "http://www.sbnation.com/nascar/2015/7/12/8939683/2015-nascar-kentucky-speedway-quaker-state-400-results-recap-new-rules-package", "http://www.sbnation.com/nascar/2015/10/14/9533327/nascar-low-downforce-rules-package-2016-season", "http://sbnation.com?utm_source=MSNbanner/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T17:26:43.876+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
