Dehradun Municipal Corporation (DMC) workers were protesting manhandling of five sanitary workers by some anti-social elements while collecting garbage in the Kargi area yesterday. The workers were irked at the clumsy attitude of the police on the issue. They alleged that one of the accused, who was arrested yesterday, was set free by the police. However, Mayor Vinod Chamoli assured the striking workers of taking a legal action against the culprits. Meanwhile, piles of garbage were lying unattended in several areas of the city. The DMC is already facing a management crisis due to lack of resources. On the other hand, Mayor Vinod Chamoli said, “The assault might have been at the behest of the land mafia, which is trying to capture the DMC land by threatening the employees.” However, he has appealed to the workers to return to work.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T10:22:18.054+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
