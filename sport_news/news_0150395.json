Would it be great to intercept Peyton? No doubt about it. But this is about wins and losses.\"\n--Raiders outside linebacker Aldon Smith, having played four games without a training camp, appeared to be hitting his stride against the Chicago Bears , registering a sack and playing well against the run.\nSmith, along with DE Khalil Mack, and Denver edge rushers Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware , will give quarterbacks Manning and Derek Carr plenty to think about this week.\n\"Just the competitive nature of us, we all want to compete and prove who is the best out of all of us,\" Smith said. \"We'll all be out there trying to make our mark.\"\n--Kicker Sebastian Janikowski stands alone when he takes the field Sunday as he plays his 241st consecutive game, breaking the franchise record set by Tim Brown .\n\"It means a lot,\" Janikowski said. \"It means I'm doing something right, right?\"\nJanikowski has converted all seven if his field goal attempts this season at age 37 and shows no signs of decline.\n\"I never thought I would play this long, but I feel great, and I'm going to keep playing as long as I can.\"\nIn past years, Janikowski has missed all but the mandatory parts of the Raiders offeseason program, and eight previous head coaches were OK with it. Jack Del Rio , Janikowski's ninth head coach, wanted more of a commitment.\n\"I thought it was imperative he was around so we could get our special teams up to speed,\" Del Rio said. \"He complied and made that happen. Once he understood the why, he embraced it and he was here.\"\n--The numbers say rookie first-round draft pick Amari Cooper is on his way to a standout rookie season and a contender for NFL offensive rookie of the year. His 24 receptions for 339 yards lead all rookies, and he has caught two touchdown passes.\nCooper, however also has at least one drop in each of his first four games and has maintained a professional, even keel throughout the first quarter of his rookie year, as evidenced by his self-assessment.\n\"I'm not really pleased with my first four games,\" Cooper said. \"There's always room for improvement. It's why I'm here today. It's why I'm here tomorrow. To get better.\"\nCooper is the only player from the Raiders draft class through four games to put his stamp and style on the team. Second-round pick Mario Edwards Jr. has been a rotational player on the defensive line and third-round pick Clive Walford a third tight end.\n--There was considerable second-guessing among the Oakland fan base regarding a third-and-two run late in the 22-20 loss to the Bears that was stuffed for a one-yard loss by Pernell McPhee.\nIt forced a Sebastian Janikowski field goal with 2:05 left and gave the Bears and quarterback Jay Cutler time to drive for a game-winning 49-yard field goal.\nRoy Helu Jr., in for Latavius Murray, had gained three, three and four yards on consecutive carries before the ill-fated run. Del Rio had no problem with the decision to run the ball, rather than give quarterback Derek Carr a chance to make a short throw, only with the way it turned out.\n\"You can always second-guess the call, whether it was run or pass,\" Del Rio said. \"It was definitely there, if we executed the play. But you have to give (McPhee) credit. He's a game-wrecker kind of guy. He ended up spoiling that play.\"\nMcPhee instantly got inside rookie tight end Walford at the snap, blowing up a call that looked as if it might get more than only the two yards needed for a first down.\n\"Bad play by me,\" Walford said. \"I've just got to be better. I can't dwell on it. Just try and be ready the next time and look for a different outcome.\"\n--Quarterback Derek Carr is reaping the benefits of having played a full season as a rookie, even if he finished with a 3-13 record last season in Oakland.\nThat comes from an expert none other than Peyton Manning, who had his own 3-13 season as a rookie in 1998 under coach Jim Mora . The Colts jumped to 13-3 in Manning's second season and were a perennial contender from then on.\n\"I've always been a proponent of playing early,\" Manning told Bay Area reporters by conference call. \"There's nothing quite like getting game experience. It looks like he's certainly using last year's experience to his advantage and he's off to a really good start this year.\"\nNOTES: Defensive end Justin Tuck (knee) of the Raiders was limited in practice but is expected to face Denver. ...
