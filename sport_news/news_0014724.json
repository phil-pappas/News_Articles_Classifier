It certainly is locally, where both NC State and Duke have a bye. But North Carolina and Wake kick off Stage 1 of the State Championship. Frisky Louisville travels to Florida State. Boston College’s excellent defense and barf-on-self offense goes to Clemson. The Eagles always play good teams tough and bad teams for that matter. Virginia Tech and Miami will try to continue to puzzle us, and Pitt will try to avoid a colossal Pitt-ing against a Georgia Tech team that is on fire. \nYou tell me that doesn’t sound like fun. I don’t believe you. WAKE FOREST (3-3, 1-2 ACC) AT NORTH CAROLINA (4-1, 1-0 ACC) Time: 7:00 p.m. TV: RSN #ANALYSIS \nNorth Carolina gets a night game against an ACC opponent? AND WAKE FOREST? WHAT IS THIS SORCERY?! Oh, right, there’s an actual game to be played here. \nFor all the talk about Wake’s 3-0 win against Boston College being bereft of offense – and make no mistake, it was – Boston College still had 18 first downs to just five for Wake Forest. FIVE! So I’m going to go out on a limb here and say that if North Carolina doesn’t go 0-for-4 in the red zone, doesn’t turn it over and makes field goals, the Tar Heels should be fine. \nAll UNC’s defense needs to do is let Wake score a touchdown since Wake is 2-1 when it doesn’t score a touchdown in ACC play and 2-8 when they do. Yeah, I don’t know either. \nUNC’s offense is going to need to continue to get better and be more consistent against a Wake defense that is good, but not quite as good as last year’s version. Wake’s going to play hard. The Deacs have nothing to use, except yardage, which they did on 11 plays last week (and gained zero on 16, so that’s 27 plays for zero or negative yardage, which, oof). THIS GUY \nDuke Ejiofor. Boston College’s offense hasn’t been good all season, but one of the reasons Wake was able to win a 3-0 game is because its defense is good, and getting better. One reason is Ejifor’s return. The senior defensive end helped Wake shore up a pass rush that hadn’t been as good as previous years, getting in for 44 plays and finishing with six tackles and a sack. North Carolina’s offensive line has been pretty good this season, but they’ll need to account for Ejiofor, which could free up other Wake defenders. HERE’S A GUY \nJalen Dalton. Speaking of defensive linemen, North Carolina is going to burn the redshirt of the No. 1 player in North Carolina in freshman Jalen Dalton on Saturday. Starter Nazair Jones got hurt against Georgia Tech and there’s no telling the extent of the injury. Dalton is 6-6, 280 pounds and is listed as a defensive tackle, which is a position where North Carolina lacks some depth right now – and not just with Jones’ injury. Wake’s offensive line is improved but still awful; maybe Dalton can make an impact. NARRATIVES \nWake Forest Win: A win while scoring a touchdown? None of us can feel our face \nWake Forest Loss: Exclusive footage of Wake Forest’s offense \nNorth Carolina Win: Good job but we’ll still be waiting to see with you guys \nNorth Carolina Loss: Oh fudge. PREDICTION \nNorth Carolina, 33-18. Because six field goals = 18 points. LOUISVILLE (2-3, 1-1 ACC) AT NO. 11 FLORIDA STATE (5-0, 3-0 ACC) Time: 12:00 p.m. TV: ESPN #ANALYSIS \nLouisville has always been frisky against the ACC’s best, and with the exception of the Louisville hiccup (and even Virginia last year), they’ve avoided some of the more head-scratching moments that other mid-to-upper-mid-tier teams seem to stumble into. And don’t look now, but Florida State might actually be a contender. \nEverett Golson has been underwhelming at times at QB, but he’s not turning it over (a huge problem for the Seminoles last year), the defense is better, and Dalvin Cook is a beast at running back. Louisville, though, is likely feeling very good about itself after beating NC State and finding a real gem in freshman dual-threat QB Lamar Jackson. But are the Cardinals, as battle-tested as they are, enough for FSU on the road? I’m just not seeing it. It will be a good, close game though. NARRATIVES \nLouisville Win: You really are kind of adorable Louisville, but you’re also new here \nLouisville Loss: Let me guess. You played them close, but lost. Again. \nFlorida State Win: COME AT THEM AT YOUR OWN PERIL, REST OF ACC! WHERE’S YOUR TOP 11 NOW SPORTSCENTER \nFlorida State Loss: Wait. Are we sure FSU is still allowed to lose an ACC game? PREDICTION \nFlorida State, 31-22. This one should be fun. PITTSBURGH (4-1, 2-0 ACC) AT GEORGIA TECH (2-4, 0-3 ACC) Time: 12:30 p.m. TV: ACC Network #ANALYSIS \nGeorgia Tech can’t be this bad….right? And is Pitt….good? I’m afraid of believing either of those things. Georgia Tech, though, is up to 30 injuries. That seems bad. Georgia Tech might have blown out Pitt on the road last year – obviously, this is not last year – but even in that game, Pitt had like eight billion turnovers in the opening minutes. \nWhat I’m sort of getting at here is: Based on Georgia Tech’s current situation and the way Pitt has played, Pitt only needs to take care of the ball and play fundamentally sound defense. Easier said than done against a Georgia Tech team that, while hurting, is going to be playing with nothing to lose here. Since, you know, they’ve already lost every other game vs. FBS foes. NARRATIVES \nPittsburgh Win: Pitt might be ... good! \nPittsburgh Loss: Pitt when anyone starts to believe in them \nGeorgia Tech Win: Maybe you could’ve had a nice year, Georgia Tech. Oh well. \nGeorgia Tech Loss: What is happening to you Georgia Tech? PREDICTION \nPitt, 34-27. Both Pitt and Georgia Tech will find a way to make this close. Take that how you will. VIRGINIA TECH (3-3, 1-1 ACC) AT MIAMI (3-2, 0-1 ACC) Time: 3:30 p.m. TV: ESPNU #ANALYSIS \nMiami, we need to have a talk. You need to stop doing this thing where you play well against FSU and no one else. I’m already very, very afraid that you are going to try to ruin everything yet again when you play Clemson in a few weeks. In the last two years, against FSU you’ve converted 18 of 34 third downs against FSU and 63 of 198 in the other 16 games against teams that were not FSU. Just stop it. HOW ABOUT CONVERTING SOME OF THOSE AGAINST VIRGINIA OR CINCINNATI ONCE OR TWICE, YOU JERKS?! \nOkay. That’s out of the way. It’s almost impossible for me to get a good read on Virginia Tech ever. I’d love to believe that they’ve turned it all around and they’re ready to be good again. Or at least good enough to beat a team like Miami. But I just don’t know that. I do think that they can exploit some things in Miami’s secondary, but Miami’s talent level is going to be the second-best the Hokies have seen all year (behind only Ohio State). Can they keep positive momentum rolling? Will Miami temporarily forget they are capable of being good until they play Clemson? Probably. Ugh. Wish the league had kept its receipt. NARRATIVES \nVirginia Tech Win: Oh hey, you lost all your important non-conference games only to beat ACC teams. That seems familiar \nVirginia Tech Loss: One step forward, two steps back \nMiami Win: Whatever. \nMiami Loss: I’m on to you, Miami. I know what you’re going to do when you play Clemson. Just stop it. PREDICTION \nMiami, 34-23. Miami still has one more ACC team on its schedule whose playoff hopes it can ruin, so I think the Hurricanes will stay engaged for now. And as we know, they’re plenty talented. SYRACUSE (3-2, 1-0 ACC) AT VIRGINIA (1-4, 0-1 ACC) Time: 3:30 p.m. TV: RSN #ANALYSIS \nJust as we all thought, Virginia is an overwhelming favorite in a game against a Power 5 opponent with a winning record. Wait. What? \nLook, I doubted Vegas last week when Syracuse was an underdog at South Florida. And look what Syracuse did to me. If anything, Vegas OVERestimated Syracuse as they got blown out. Gross. \nVirginia has plenty of grossness of its own, but one thing is for sure – the Cavaliers have some talent, and they’ve played an absolutely brutal schedule. And if last week at Pitt was any indication, they’re still trying. If there’s an issue here, it’s that Virginia’s offensive line has become ... patchwork might be too nice a word. And Syracuse was supposed to have a good defensive front. But I don’t know anything anymore, clearly. Syracuse plays LSU tough and then goes out and does THAT? HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO FIGURE ANY OF YOU OUT? NARRATIVES \nSyracuse Loss: Something like this \nVirginia Win: Oh wow a Power 5 win imagine that \nVirginia Loss: Virginia can’t even win a game as a touchdown favorite at home, shocking no one until they beat Miami which will also shock no one PREDICTION BOSTON COLLEGE (3-3, 0-3 ACC) AT NO. 5 CLEMSON (5-0, 2-0 ACC) Time: 7:00 p.m. TV: ESPNU #ANALYSIS \nBoston College found a magical way to lose last week’s game in spite of getting the ball back deep in Wake territory – like, basically on the goal line – with the score just 3-0. And lost. Because of bad clock management. \nClemson is coming off an emotional win and could be prime for a letdown, and Boston College has pushed the Tigers (and FSU, for that matter) before. But here’s the thing – that was mostly when Boston College had a competent quarterback and/or the Eagles were facing an offense that’s good but not great. This will not be the case this week, and Clemson’s defense is going to be more than a handful. As long as Clemson takes care of the football and establishes the run, the Tigers will be just fine. NARRATIVES \nBoston College Win: Well your fans will be happy \nBoston College Loss: You gave it a valiant effort, Boston College \nClemson Win: Let’s not go overboard with the praise here but look you guys are doing a really good job this year \nClemson Loss: Welp. PREDICTION \nClemson, 23-3. Hey, at least Boston College’s struggling kicker will make one this week. Maybe.
