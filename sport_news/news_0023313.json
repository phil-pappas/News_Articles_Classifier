Others might see it as desperation. Either way, the Cardinals have opted to start John Lackey on three-days rest for Game 4 of the NLDS against the Cubs on Tuesday.\nDown 2-1 in the series, it makes sense the Cards would hand the ball to their most consistent, playoff-tested pitcher in a win-or-go-home game. Or does it?\nSLIDESHOW: 10 most-asked Google questions about Cubs, Cardinals\nThe 36-year-old has pitched just four games on three days rest in his 14-year career, the last coming in the 2005 playoffs.\nFrom Gordon Wittenmyer of the Chicago Sun-Times:\nLackey, who missed 2012 because of Tommy John surgery, has pitched on three days’ rest only four times in his career, including twice in the postseason. He’s 2-1 with a 3.15 ERA in those four starts (including a Game 7 World Series start as a rookie in 2002). But he hasn’t done it since the 2005 playoffs against the Yankees.", "external_links": ["http://www.foxsports.com/midwest/video/matheny-announces-john-lackey-as-game-4-starter-101215"], "published": "2015-10-13T21:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T22:08:36.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
