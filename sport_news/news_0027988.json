That's not a bad thing, according to assistant coach Greg Manning .\n\"When he gets hot, he likes to talk trash and stuff like that,\" Manning said. \"Some of the guys don't like it. He's new. He hasn't scored a point for us yet. But we're such a quiet group that it's good for us.\"\nThe Saints expect Clareth, a 6-foot-5, 192-pound native of Baltimore, to make some noise in his first season. Siena head coach Jimmy Patsos compared Clareth to one of the talented, raw, young colts that Patsos enjoys watching at Saratoga Race Course during the summer.\n\"I'm not going to rein him in,\" Patsos said. \"I love his energy and enthusiasm. I think he's going to do some interesting things. He's going to take some interesting shots, but that's OK. He's a MAAC player. He's athletic and can score and he's like a 2-year-old running through the field, horse-wise.\"\nClareth said that unbridled enthusiasm is a cornerstone of his game and that's what he hopes to bring to the Saints.\n\"Energy, that's just my thing,\" he said. \"Just feeling the team, making sure everybody's going, nobody's down. Pick up anybody I can. I'll help in any way, defense, scoring. The energy's the foundation of it all.\"\nJunior point guard Marquis Wright said he's been impressed in the preseason with Clareth's ability to score both with his jumper and driving to the basket. Clareth averaged 15 points a game as a high school senior while leading Calvert Hall to the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association A Conference championship.\nWhat Clareth has to learn is self-restraint, according to Wright.\n\"He's just got to stay under control and just do it not trying so hard,\" Wright said. \"Just let it come to him. But he can score the ball well.\"\nAlthough Clareth might get under some teammates' skin with his talk on the court, Wright said he has also found the freshman to be willing to listen. Wright said he loves that Clareth approaches him for tips.\n\"My whole thing is learning and getting accustomed to the college game and playing for a college coach,\" Clareth said. \"Just listening to any advice I can get from players and coaches, staff, anybody who's been here longer than I have.\"\nClareth said the best advice he has heard came from Patsos, who told him, \"We don't care about what you know, we want to know how much you care.\"\nTo which Clareth responded, \"I care more than anything.\"\nBesides that passion, Siena recruited Clareth because he's a high-level athlete whom Manning said received interest from major programs such as Tennessee, Virginia Tech and Nevada-Las Vegas when he was a high school junior.\nThose schools wanted Clareth to attend a year of prep school, according to Manning, while Clareth wanted to play right away. He chose Siena partly because of his relationship with Patsos, who has strong Baltimore connections due to his time as a Maryland assistant and Loyola (Md.) head coach.\nClareth is a different type of shooting guard from 5-foot-9 Evan Hymes or 6-6 Rob Poole, last year's seniors who played the position but didn't have Clareth's combination of size and explosiveness.\n\"He brings us something we didn't have last year,\" Manning said. \"Obviously, we want to run and press. He's the type of kid Jimmy likes because he can be on the ball, he can trap. He's athletic. He can chase from behind and block it. If a guy gets past him, he can recover. He can really shoot, too. He's streaky, but when he's hot, he's hot.\"\nClareth committed to Siena last February before he ever visited the campus. Patsos told Clareth back then Siena was going to renovate the Alumni Recreation Center practice facility and put new furniture in the locker room. The Saints did both.\n\"I love it,\" Clareth said. \"The weather's definitely something to get used to, but (Siena) is nothing less than I expected. Coach Patsos kept his word. Everything he said was going to happen has happened.\"\nNow Clareth gets the chance to make things happen.\nmsingelais@timesunion.com • 518-454-5509 • @MarkSingelais", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813374/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813375/3/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813374/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813375/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813374/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813373/3/920x920.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813373/3/628x471.jpg", "http://timesunion.mycapture.com/mycapture/remoteimage.asp?backtext=Back%20to%20Times%20Union&image=http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813375/3/628x471.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/47/54/8813373/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-19T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T13:55:41.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
