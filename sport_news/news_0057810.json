As for not using the whip, Contreras actually didn’t have a choice. \nPartway through the 11/16 mile battle for two-year-old fillies, Contreras had his whip knocked out of his hands by Da Silva, though he acknowledged that it was an accident. \n“He tried to hit his horse and instead hit my whip,” said Contreras, who has 122 wins so far this season (second to Da Silva with 133). “But the damage was done already. My filly was already flying.” \nThe victory for the Ivan Dalos-owned dark bay broke a three-year win streak for jockey Patrick Husbands and trainer Mark Casse. The last three Mazarine Stakes were won by the dynamic duo, last year with Conquest Harlanate. \nIn Sunday’s race, Husbands rode the Casse-trained Conquest Soprano to fifth. Gamble’s Ghost settled near the back of the pack early, making a move on the far turn but found herself behind a wall of horses. But once the two-year-old daughter of Ghostzapper found room, she took off, clocking 1:453/5 on a cool and overcast afternoon at Woodbine. \n“A little bit before the quarter pole I got a little bit stuck in traffic,” said Contreras, a native of Mexico City. “But had so much horse and I know my filly really, really well, so I know when I ask her to go, she’s going to give me everything no matter what.” \nGamble’s Ghost’s trainer wasn’t as relaxed about the trip as her jockey was. \n“We had some anxious moments today,” said Carroll. “Luis might have been pretty confident, but when I saw her trapped in there I was pretty concerned. But she is a very brave filly and she went through and pricked her ears and had fun.” \nCarroll is having a very good year at Woodbine. Sunday’s triumph marked her 26th win of the season in 93 starts at the west end Toronto track, including three stakes victories. Dalos is also hot this year, the victory marking the fourth stakes for the Hungary-born horseman who captured the Simcoe and Bull Page with talented juvenile colt Amis Gizmo and the Etobicoke with Elusive Collection. The Mazarine score for Gamble’s Ghost, out of 1996 La Prevoyante champ Gambling Girl, was particularly emotional for Dalos. \n“This one is special because her dam passed away this year (and) I have some special memories of her,” he said. \nGamble’s Ghost earned her first stakes win in the Mazarine after finishing second to Catch a Glimpse in the G2 Natalma on turf Sept. 12. \nIn the afternoon’s co-feature, the Nicholas Gonzalez-trained dark bay colt Riker captured the $150,000 Grade 3 Grey Stakes for two-year-olds. Riker is now a perfect 4-0. \nRidden by Jesse Campbell, Riker was fastest out of the gate and commanded an early lead, which he quickened in the stretch for a convincing win over the U.K-bred Kasseopia and show finisher Tizzarunner. The final time for the 11/16-mile trek was 1:441/5. Three of Riker’s career wins have come in stakes races. Riker was bred in Kentucky by Turner Breeders and is by Include out of Desviacion (Unreal Zeal). Riker’s next start could come in the Grade 1 $2-million Breeders’ Cup Juvenile on Oct. 31 at Keeneland Racecourse in Kentucky. \n“That will be our plan now. We’ll see how he comes out of the race, but we’re dreaming the dream,” said Gonzalez. \nSent to post as the even-money favourite, Riker opened up a four-length lead in the opening quarter-mile and took the compact five-horse field through splits of :24.18, :48.92 and 1:14.29. Kasseopia, an impressive maiden winner at Kempton in England, broke outward but was keen to stalk Riker’s early foot, chasing the leader through the final turn and stayed on determinedly to the wire. \n“I wanted to be in front and it worked out that way,” said Campbell. “He was very relaxed going into the first turn and at about seven-eighths he grabbed me pretty good. It wasn’t rank, he just surprised me a bit ... he was ready to run today.” Sponsored Links", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T03:11:30.786+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
