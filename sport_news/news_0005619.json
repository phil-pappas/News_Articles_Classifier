Photo by Thearon W. Henderson/Getty Images The Oakland Raiders are finally having a good start to a season in a while, and it has been nothing but good news for a franchise that has been struggling for a little more than a decade. However, one issue is still not solved and it is a huge one. The issue is that the Raiders are having a hard time finding a new stadium for the team.\nIt was mentioned on Tuesday that team owner Mark Davis is considering selling a large part of the team to a “mystery billionaire.” This investor would then help the Raiders get the ball rolling and get a stadium built in Los Angeles .\nThis report on Davis was made by Jason Cole with the Bleacher Report, and it states that Davis might not have the money to finance relocation for the Oakland Raiders. Of course, the Raiders being a traditional team with many followers is something that can attract billionaires for an investment.\nAdditionally, with the Raiders not being able to find a new home or a stadium, is making huge waves that the franchise is more than willing to make changes in order to get a nice, brand new stadium. This is partly due to the fact that the City of Oakland and Alameda County are not coming up with viable plans to keep the team.\nWith the old, dilapidated O.co Coliseum that the Raiders play in and have to share with baseball team, the Oakland A’s, the Raiders are likely to leave. They are the only team in the NFL that has to play over a baseball diamond during most of the season, and that is if the A’s do not make the playoffs and extent the Raiders' playing time over the diamond even longer.\nThen again, Davis has been offered to move to Los Angeles into a modern stadium that has been approved for construction. The downside to this is that he might have to share the stadium with his AFC West rivals the San Diego Chargers .\nAnyway, Cole is only implying that the only way out for the Silver and Black, as a last resort, is to sell the team or sell a majority of it to get a new stadium. This could easily be seen as a far-fetched idea, and it is most likely that Davis will not break an NFL tradition, like making the Oakland Raiders go through major changes. Changing cities within California is about the most the Raiders are willing to change, and that is pretty much about the most that will happen.", "external_links": ["http://t.co/rz0PBRMicl", "http://justblogbaby.com/2015/09/29/oakland-raiders-could-be-sold-to-billionaire-br-reports/"], "published": "2015-09-30T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T00:23:32.849+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
