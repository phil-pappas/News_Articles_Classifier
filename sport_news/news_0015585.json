(Mark Humphrey / Associated Press) Associated Press \nMEMPHIS, Tenn. -- Paxton Lynch threw for 384 yards and three touchdowns as Memphis stunned No. 13 Mississippi, 37-24, on Saturday. \nMemphis (6-0) has won 13 straight games dating back to last season, which is the third longest streak in the nation. It was the first win for the Tigers over a ranked opponent since 1996. \nOle Miss (5-2) jumped out to a 14-0 lead less than six minutes into the game — partly thanks to a 68-yard touchdown pass by receiver Laquon Treadwell on a trick play — but Memphis responded with 31 unanswered points to take a 31-14 lead early in the third quarter. \nLynch was superb, completing 39 of 53 passes. Anthony Miller caught 10 passes for 132 yards and a touchdown. \nThe Rebels were able to pull within 31-24 later in the third quarter, but could get no closer. Treadwell caught a school-record 14 passes for 144 yards and a touchdown. \nIt was an impressive performance for the Tigers, who now have a legitimate claim at being the best team in the country that's not in a Power Five conference. \nThe 6-foot-7, 245-pound Lynch did whatever he wanted against the Rebels' secondary for most of the afternoon, helping the Tigers regroup following the rough start. \nOle Miss' Chad Kelly completed 33 of 47 passes for 372 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions. \nNo. 2 Baylor 62, West Virginia 38 \nWACO, Texas -- Corey Coleman caught three more touchdowns and second-ranked Baylor won its FBS-best 19th consecutive home game, getting some measure of revenge with the win. \nColeman matched and then broke the single-season school record for TD catches, his nation-leading 16 coming halfway through the regular season for the Bears (6-0, 3-0 Big 12). \nSeth Russell became the only Baylor quarterback other than Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III in 2011 to throw for 300 yards and run for 100 yards in the same game. Russell had five TD passes and ran 14 times for 160 yards with another score. \nBaylor's only regular-season loss last year was 41-27 at West Virginia, and the Bears wound up the first team left out of the initial College Football Playoff. \nSkyler Howard, from Fort Worth, Texas, less than 100 miles from the Baylor campus, threw four TD passes for West Virginia (3-3, 0-3). \nNo. 3 TCU 45, Iowa State 21 \nAMES, Iowa -- Trevone Boykin threw for 436 yards and four touchdowns for TCU. \nJosh Doctson had 190 yards receiving and two TDs for the Horned Frogs (7-0, 4-0 Big 12). \nBoykin's 3-yard scoring run with 14:36 left put TCU ahead 38-21. Doctson made it a rout with a 42-yard touchdown catch 6 minutes later. \nSam Richardson had 251 yards passing for Iowa State (2-4, 1-2). \nNo. 5 Clemson 34, Boston College 17 \nCLEMSON, S.C. -- Deshaun Watson threw for three touchdowns and a season-best 420 yards and Clemson rolled against Boston College's top-ranked defense. \nWatson added a rushing touchdown and the Tigers improved to 6-0 (3-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) for the third time in five seasons. Watson finished 27 of 41, including touchdowns throws of 21 yards to Zac Brooks, 51 yards to Artavis Scott and 6 yards to Jordan Leggett. \nScott had 10 catches for 162 yards and Clemson put up 532 yards against a defense that was only allowing 140 a game coming in to lead the Football Bowl Subdivision. Boston College (3-4, 0-4) hadn't allowed so many yards since losing the Independence Bowl to Arizona State after the 2013 season. \nNo. 6 LSU 35, No. 8 Florida 28 \nBATON ROUGE, La. -- Leonard Fournette ran for 180 yards and two touchdowns, and LSU coach Les Miles victimized Florida with a fake field goal for the second time in five years. \nKicker Trent Domingue's 16-yard touchdown run on the fake was LSU's only scoring play of the second half, breaking a 28-all tie in the fourth quarter. \nThe Tigers' defense held from there — barely. Florida receiver Antonio Callaway, who had a 72-yard punt return for a score, also had his hands on a long pass to the end zone from Treon Harris in the middle of the fourth quarter, but LSU's Dwyane Thomas punched it out to prevent a tying touchdown. \nHarris, starting for the suspended Will Grier, passed for 271 yards and two touchdowns for Florida (6-1, 4-1 SEC). Brandon Harris threw for 202 yards and two scores for LSU (6-0, 4-0). \nNo. 7 Michigan State 27, No. 12 Michigan 23 \nANN ARBOR, Mich. -- Jalen Watts-Jackson grabbed a flubbed punt and lumbered 38 yards into the end zone for a touchdown on the final play of the game, giving No. 7 Michigan State a shocking 27-23 win over No. 12 Michigan in one of college football's most unlikely endings. \nWith the Wolverines ahead 23-21 and 10 seconds left, Michigan punter Blake O'Neill bobbled a low snap, and spun around to try and make the kick. But he was hit, the ball popped free and Watts-Jackson caught it, broke a few tackles in the final yards and made it into the end zone. \nMichigan State improved to 7-0, 3-0 in the Big Ten. Michigan fell to 5-2, 2-1. \nNo. 10 Alabama 41, No. 9 Texas A&M 23 \nCOLLEGE STATION, Texas -- Derrick Henry ran for a career-high 236 yards and two scores and No. 10 Alabama added a school record three touchdowns on interception returns to best Texas A&M. \nAlabama (6-1, 3-1 SEC) built a 28-6 lead in the second quarter thanks to 55- and 6-yard touchdown runs by Henry and interception returns of 33 and 93 yards. \nChristian Kirk returned a punt 68 yards for a score just before halftime and Texas A&M (5-1, 2-1) added another touchdown on a 3-yard reception by Ricky Seals-Jones after a fumble early in the third to cut it to 28-20. But Alabama kicked two field goals before Minkah Fitzpatrick's 55-yard interception return for a score — his second of the day — made it 41-23 and sealed the victory. \nNo. 11 Florida State 41, Louisville 21 \nTALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Everett Golson threw for 372 yards and three touchdowns as No. 11 Florida State rallied in the second half to secure the victory. \nIt is the eighth 300-yard game of Golson's career and his second since transferring earlier this summer. A 70-yard touchdown pass to Kermit Whitfield, who had nine receptions for 172 yards, gave the Seminoles a 20-14 lead with 8:05 remaining. \nThe win gives Florida State a 6-0 record for the third straight season. The Seminoles are 4-0 in the Atlantic Coast Conference. The Cardinals drop to 2-4 and 1-2 in the ACC. \nDalvin Cook had his fourth 100-yard game of the season, gaining 163 yards on 22 carries. \nLouisville's Lamar Jackson passed for a career-high 307 yards and James Quick had five receptions for 130 yards and three touchdowns. \nNo. 14 Notre Dame 41, USC 31 \nSOUTH BEND, Ind. -- Corey Robinson made a diving catch in the end zone midway through the fourth quarter and Notre Dame rebounded to beat USC after squandering a two-touchdown lead. \nC.J. Prosise ran for 143 yards and two touchdowns, and DeShone Kizer threw two scoring passes, the second the 10-yarder to Robinson that made it 38-31. \nUSC played for the first time since firing coach Steve Sarkisian, with interim Coach Clay Helton directing the Trojans. \nThe Fighting Irish (6-1) bounced back from an embarrassing 35-point loss to USC in the regular-season finale last year. The victory looked in doubt when the Trojans (3-3) scored three straight touchdowns to take a 31-24 lead. But the Irish rallied to win the Jeweled Shillelagh for the third time in four seasons. \nNo. 17 Iowa 40, No. 20 Northwestern 10 \nEVANSTON, Ill. -- Reserve running back Akrum Wadley ran for 192 yards and tied Iowa's school record with four rushing touchdowns. \nWith leading rusher Jordan Canzeri sidelined in the first quarter with an ankle injury, Wadley took over for Iowa (7-0, 3-0 Big Ten). The injury occurred following a short run when linebacker Jaylen Prater landed on Canzeri, folding his ankle under a pile of players. \nWadley, who had only eight carries coming into the game, scored his third touchdown on a 2-yard run with 6:42 remaining in the third quarter, extending Iowa's lead to 23-10. His record-tying fourth scoring run, which followed a Northwestern fumble on the Wildcats ensuing drive, came on a 4-yard run that. \nNorthwestern (5-2, 1-2) lost for the second straight week after five consecutive victories. \nNo. 19 Oklahoma 55, Kansas State 0 \nMANHATTAN, Kan. -- Baker Mayfield threw for five touchdowns and No. 19 Oklahoma bounced back from its Red River upset to hand the Wildcats their first shutout 1996. \nKansas State had delivered serious scares to Top 25 opponents each of the last two weeks but the Wildcats (3-3, 0-3 Big 12) were helpless against the Sooners (5-1, 2-1). Oklahoma set the tone early, taking only 1:04 to score on its opening drive on a 22-yard pass from Mayfield to Sterling Shepard. \nThe Sooners took a 35-0 lead into halftime and just kept rolling in the second half. \nGoing into Saturday's game, Kansas State had scored in 234 straight games. The loss to Oklahoma marked the first time the Wildcats have been shut out at home since 1991. \nNo. 22 Toledo 63, Eastern Michigan 20 \nTOLEDO, Ohio -- Phillip Ely threw for 327 yards and four touchdowns as No. 22 Toledo improved to 6-0 for the first time since 1997. \nThe Rockets (6-0, 2-0 Mid-American Conference) led 28-6 at halftime, and then Ely really warmed up. He threw touchdown passes on Toledo's first two possessions of the second half, connecting with Corey Jones for a 55-yard score and then with Cody Thompson on an 88-yarder four minutes later. \nThe touchdown to Thompson was the fourth longest completion in school history, and it wasn't the only record book-worthy play of the game against an Eastern Michigan (1-6, 0-3) defense that entered the game ranked 118th in scoring defense (40.7 points) and 116th in total defense (495.3 yards). \nWisconsin 24, Purdue 7 \nMADISON, Wis. -- Alec Ingold ran for two short scores, Joel Stave threw for 322 yards and Wisconsin's stifling defense held Purdue to a season-low 191 yards. \nThe Badgers (5-2, 2-1 Big Ten) overcame several penalties and other mistakes in the red zone to win on homecoming weekend at Camp Randall Stadium. \nWisconsin led just 10-7 late in the third quarter until two rushing touchdowns in an eight-minute span between the third and fourth quarters. \nT.J. Edwards then forced the Boilermakers' Markell Jones to fumble at the Purdue 43. Safety Tanner McEvoy pounced on the ball to seal the win for the Badgers. \nEdwards, one of two freshmen starting at inside linebacker for Wisconsin, finished with 16 tackles. \nThe only score for Purdue (1-6, 0-3) came on David Blough's 2-yard quarterback keeper in the second quarter. \nPittsburgh 31, Georgia Tech 28 \nATLANTA -- Nate Peterman threw three touchdown passes and Chris Blewitt kicked a 56-yard field goal in the closing minutes to help Pittsburgh win. \nPeterman completed 14 of 21 passes for 162 yards. \nTyler Boyd had eight catches with two touchdowns to become Pitt's career leading receiver, and the Panthers burned all but 1 minute, 4 seconds of the final 8:13 with a 14-play drive that ended on Blewitt's school record-long kick. \nPitt (5-1, 3-0 Atlantic Coast Conference) is unbeaten in its first three conference games for the first time since 2010. \nGeorgia Tech (2-5, 0-4 ACC) has lost five straight, its longest single-season skid since it went 1-10 in 1996. The Jackets, who began the season as favorites to win the league's Coastal Division, must regroup before hosting No. 11 Florida State next weekend. \nArmy 21, Bucknell 14 \nWEST POINT, N.Y. -- A.J. Schurr came off the bench to run for two touchdowns and threw for the winning score. \nSchurr connected with Edgar Poe, who won a jump ball over Nick O'Brien and ran all the way to the end zone for a 68-yard score, to put Army up with 4:44 left. Chris Carnegie intercepted R.J. Nitti on Bucknell's ensuing drive to clinch it. \nFollowing a 44-3 rout by Duke last week, Army (2-5) won at home for the first time this season despite trailing at halftime 14-7. The Black Knights came back from a halftime deficit for the first time under second-year coach Jeff Monken, improving to 1-9 when down at the break. Nitti finished 17 for 33 for 186 yards and Matt DelMauro added 105 on the ground for the Bison (3-3).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T20:01:47.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
