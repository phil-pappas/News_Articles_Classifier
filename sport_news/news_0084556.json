Wolf Pack football fans are learning the same lesson about Chris Ault – yet again. When Ault resigned after the 2012 season, the reaction was mostly positive. People were pleased he was stepping down. Some thought he was actually holding the program back. Season-ticket sales went up. The future would be better without the Little General, many thought, despite previous evidence that the non-Ault years were always miseries. But here’s what one of Ault’s long-time assistant coaches told me the day he resigned: “So many people here have taken him for granted and when he’s gone they’re going to realize how much he did with so little.” That coach has been proven correct. Murray's Sunday List: 10 most cursed fan bases \n* AULT ARRIVED AT NEVADA IN 1965 to quarterback the Wolf Pack. He ended up staying in Reno for the rest of his life, putting in more than 40 years of service at the school. Ault spent 32 years as the team’s quarterback or its coach. During those years, Nevada posted a 252-126-3 record, a winning percentage of 66.1 percent. In the 19 seasons in which Ault hasn’t been the team’s quarterback or coach since 1965, the Wolf Pack is 97-111-1, a winning percent of 46.4 percent. That’s a 19.7 percent difference, which is basically the difference between a 6-7 season and a 9-4 season. Big difference. \n* DURING AULT’S 28 SEASONS AS NEVADA’S coach, the Wolf Pack posted 25 winning seasons and won 10 league titles. During his 12 seasons coaching at the Division I level, he led the team to 10 bowl games in 12 seasons (and one of the years Nevada didn’t make a bowl it went 9-2 and was a co-conference champion). During the 19 non-Ault seasons since he came to Nevada, the Wolf Pack has just seven winning seasons, two league titles (the two years after Ault resigned in 1995 when he left a stocked team) and two bowls (again with mostly Ault leftovers). Simply put, when Ault has been Nevada’s coach, the Wolf Pack has had a proud football program. When he hasn’t been the team’s coach, it’s been ugly. \n* THIS IS A TOPIC OF DISCUSSION, of course, because Nevada has had an ugly month, first losing to UNLV at home (for the second straight time at Mackay) before losing to a winless Wyoming team. Some fans have turned on the Brian Polian era, calling for his job. He’ll almost certainly get (and deserves) a fourth season as head football coach. Some have asked for Ault to return, those pleas likely coming from the same people who were happy to see him leave. Ault’s not coming back. It’s almost like the (figurative) ghost of Chris Ault haunts Nevada every time he leaves as punishment for not appreciating him when he was here. This isn’t to say Ault was perfect. He rubbed many the wrong way. His teams rarely played good defense, they rarely won bowl game and they often had late-game collapses, but they always were exciting, competitive and tough. They were teams you could be proud of. \n* AULT TOOK HIS MEAGER BUDGET, his below-average facilities, his tepid fan base, his two-star recruits and continuously churned out potent offenses, winning seasons, bowl berths and pro players. That’s not easy to do. It’s nearly impossible to do every season. But Ault did it. It’s not easy to win at Nevada given the financial and facilities issues. It’s even harder now that the Wolf Pack has moved to the Mountain West, where the financial and facility gaps have grown. The future of Wolf Pack football will be interesting to track now that Ault is gone for good. Can Nevada win regularly without Ault? It could happen, but history indicates the path will be rough. Lesson learned: Appreciate what you have when you have it. Nevada fans should have done that with Ault. As for my hair? That’s never coming back. Picking the 25 Legends of Wolf Pack athletics \n* I’M FED UP WITH RICK PITINO. The Louisville basketball coach who oversaw a program that allegedly used escorts to woo recruits wrote this on his website: “I will not resign and let you down.” Did he ever think by not resigning he’s letting the college basketball world down? If these allegations, that Louisville paid escort queen Katina Powell for strippers and sex with recruits, guardians and Louisville players, allegations corroborated by five players, are true, one of two things happened: (1) Pitino knew about this, which is more likely; (2) Pitino didn’t know about it and had no control of his program. Both options are bad. A more thorough investigation needs to be completed before a decision in Pitino is made, but for him to say he’d be letting people down by resigning is an attempt to turn himself into the victim. \n* THE NCAA HAS BEEN SILENT on this issue despite Powell telling ESPN she reached out to the NCAA about the alleged sex-related recruiting violations in March before signing a book deal (Powell said the NCAA rebuffed her). The NCAA doesn’t comment on investigations until penalties are handed down, but this warrants some comment, in part because Louisville won the NCAA title in 2013, which sits in the middle of the alleged stripper and sex parties, which ran from 2010-14. How seriously will the NCAA take these allegations if it allegedly ignored Powell the first time around? And, at the very least, Louisville should give Powell a 2013 championship ring since she appeared to be Louisville’s best recruiter. \n* THE NBA REGULAR SEASON begins Tuesday. Here are my predictions. Western Conference champions: Oklahoma City Thunder. Eastern Conference champions: Cleveland Cavaliers. NBA champions: Cavs over Thunder in six. LeBron James and company will finally bring a title to Cleveland, the city’s first pro sports championship since 1964. After the season, LeBron will opt out of his contract to sign with the Cleveland Browns so he can save that franchise, too. \nColumnist Chris Murray provides insight on Northern Nevada sports.
