Craig is one of our top referees, a good man and he will have had his reasons,\" Gosper said. \n\"We don't know what was in his head. We are in the process of working that through.\" \nJoubert had made a hugely unpopular call by penalising Scotland for accidental offside, a decision that was later proved to be incorrect. \nAustralia scrum-half Nick Phipps admitted after the match he had deliberately attempted to win the loose ball that then struck Scotland openside John Hardie, his intent clearing Hardie of accidental offside. \n\"I think everyone was trying to win the ball. We were all going for it,\" Phipps said. \nJoubert's judgement and rapid departure from the field provoked a furious response from former players of all nationalities. \nScotland great Gavin Hastings said: \"If I see referee Craig Joubert again, I am going to tell him how disgusted I am. It was disgraceful that he ran straight off the pitch at the end like that.\" \nAlso among the many outraged voices was former England scrum-half Matt Dawson, who said on Twitter: \"Craig Joubert you are a disgrace and should never referee again!! How dare you sprint off the pitch after that decision!!!\" \nWorld Rugby responded to dismay over why the TMO was not consulted by stating that the technology can only be used for the act of scoring a try or an act of foul play.
