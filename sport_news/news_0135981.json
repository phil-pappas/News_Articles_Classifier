The court ordered their release after taking into account the time they served since their arrest in 2011.\nMubarak and his sons were charged of acquiring almost 126 million Egyptian pound from the Presidential Palace budget and using them for construction and development of family-owned assets. The duo were also convicted of forging official documents and damaging public property.\nCollectively, they were fined £125 million and were required to repay £21 million. In May last year, Mubarak and his sons were sentenced to three years in a maximum security prison for the embezzlement.\nThe two were first detained in April 2011 — two months after their father was ousted. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:18:34.916+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
