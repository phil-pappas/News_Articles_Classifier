The poor family of Akhlaq, who bore the brunt of the attack and will take a lifetime to recover, is now not even a point of concern. Instead, their tragedy has provided every politician, writer, activist and news commentator with a perfect peg to hang a personal little flag of protest. Whether such concern is genuine or not is not my problem here. What angers me is this style of slash-and-move behaviour. (I have taken this analogy from what is called ‘jhuming cultivation’ to describe tribal methods of traditional farming by destroying pristine forest land in the North-East to clear agricultural land. Tribals burn the forest to clear a small patch of cultivable land and move on when it is exhausted to do the same elsewhere.) I see similar behaviour now among this band of morally upright people who sniff out wrongdoing and then hunt victims in angry packs. Often, they do not even pause to think for themselves but simply put their name on petitions by seeing who the other signatures belong to. It is as if they have no individual opinion and dare not be different from those whom they cannot displease by remaining silent. Certainly, public protest must be allowed its legitimate space in order for a healthy democracy to grow. The irony is that in the name of tolerance and bhaichara, we have nearly succeeded in destroying the very space we wish to protect. The time has come, I think, to seriously debate whether there is something wrong with our understanding of the word ‘secular’, as today every Indian community — Hindus, Muslims, Sikhs, Jains, Christians, Parsis — feels insecure and considers itself a victim of state persecution. In such a situation, naturally, the only debate that takes place is one of competing victimhood (I am more persecuted than you, the Congress did this, the BJP does that). The daily spectacle of shouting matches on our screens (just as voyeuristic as ancient Romans viewed lions and gladiators), once the signature of a well-known TV channel, has now become the preferred mode of debate everywhere. Matters are not helped when the anchors themselves start to ask leading questions to stoke the fires. What on earth has happened to us in the last few years? Or was the veneer of public civility so thin that it has been erased so fast? One does not know whether to laugh or cry when politicians describe each other as ‘shaitan’ and ‘brahma-pishach’. I thought such terminology existed only in our epics and mythology. But here we are, proudly declaring to the outside world that we are the country that will lead it in this century while we have still not come out of our caveman mentality. Lynch mobs, rapists, khap panchayats, rampaging thugs who paint people’s faces black and burn effigies — what about these dinosaurs from our Jurassic Park interiors? Who are we fooling when we say India has entered the 21st century? I would say we are regressing to a time when women were considered chattel and slaves were treated like animals. Why do the pitiful condition of villages, doomed to live in perpetual darkness and ignorance, not move the collective conscience of the nation? Does it not outrage a Hindu that women are still forced to defecate in the open, that they are not allowed to marry outside their caste, that they have no right to choose their own spouses and that they are often deprived of property? Or does a Hindu only get outraged when someone eats beef? Do writers not see riots everywhere as a blot on their landscape but react only when it suits their ideological creed and in response to the actions of other writers? I am appalled (as no doubt, many others who consider themselves liberal and apolitical) by the fact that we are being forced to think in blocks. Remember George Bush’s famous cry — if you are not with us, then you are with them. So all of us who have not surrendered our awards to the Sahitya Akademi are moral cowards, those of us who eat beef have no right to call ourselves Hindus and so on. Throughout the last few decades, there have been horrific attacks on minorities and creative writers and artists. Educational institutions and research academies have had to face the ire of fundamentalists and animal right activists. Passionate speeches have been delivered by the champions of human rights and upholders of gender justice but after a few candles have been lit, moving speeches given to like-minded listeners and the mandatory resolution handed over to the relevant authority, we have gone back to our own lives and felt that we have done our bit for the human race. How wrong we are! The fight against prejudice and injustice is not fought at Jantar Mantar but in our daily lives and in the small domestic arenas of local colonies and bastis.
