In a special search operation launched near border outpost DT Mal along the Indo-Pakistan border in this sector yesterday, the BSF troops recovered five Pakistani SIM cards besides 2 kg heroin buried in sand amidst thick “sirkanda” growth. Already 19 such SIMs have been seized by the BSF during various recoveries this year, which indicates that drug smugglers continue to use Pakistani SIMs for their sinister designs, which poses a threat to the national security. BSF officials admitted that Pakistani SIMs were still being used on the Indian territory. However, no solution has been evolved to combat the same. Sources said Pakistani mobile signals have presence in more than 20 pockets along the Indo-Pakistan border in Punjab though their range may vary from 500 metre or more depending upon the locations. On the contrary, the Indian service providers have been barred from providing connectivity in the border areas, and more than often, the agencies curtail their signals using high frequency jammers. However, that is not the case with Pakistani SIMs. Pakistani service provider Mobilink, which leads the market share with nearly 31.35 million subscribers, has connectivity up to 1 km in Mamdot, Khemkaran and Ferozepur areas while “U” Fone has its signals reaching Mamdot and Amarkot areas across the fencing. Even SIM cards of Telenor (Norwegian), Zong (Chinese) and UAE’s Wahid, which also enjoy large a subscriber base in Pakistan, are being used in this belt. Intelligence sources said in the absence of any stringent telecom regulatory laws in Pakistan, a large number of unregistered SIM cards were in circulation and more often than not they made their way into India, sometimes through legal interface like the Wagha trade route or through grey channels too. Ferozepur SSP HS Mann said cross-border agents not only used Pakistani SIMs to avoid interception (by Intelligence agencies) but also kept changing their numbers to ensure that their communication is not tracked down by agencies. “In these circumstances, it becomes really cumbersome for the security agencies to monitor the movement of these agents/couriers and extract their call details,” he said. “Earlier, drug smugglers and spies were using satellite phones and the agencies were able to intercept wireless link between the phone and the satellite. But, intercepting these SIMs is an uphill task,” said Kaustubh Sharma, Director, Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB). Sources said the state agencies in Pakistan also encouraged mobile service providers to make signals available across the border deep inside the Indian territory. “We have raised this matter during various meetings with the BSNL and other authorities but a permanent solution is yet to be worked out,” said an intelligence official.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:07:51.568+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
