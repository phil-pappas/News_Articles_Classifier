Here are some Texas Tech highlights.\nWill Patrick Mahomes be fit to play Saturday? Do you think the current 17 pnt spread is assuming he will or will not play?\nCarlton: \"Baylor is certainly planning on him playing based on what Art Briles said this week. Mahomes managed to finish the TCU game, albeit with a large brace on his left knee. Unless Tech folks found something wrong medically and aren't saying, I would expect to see him out there. A bigger question is how effective he'll be. His running threat was great curtailed against TCU. And despite a gutsy performance, he did have trouble stepping into throws.\"\nIs there any way we could get more information from Kliff Kingsbury about Patrick Mahomes or do you think he really doesn't know if he can go until Saturday?\nCarlton: \"If he's practicing, then there's a good expectation he's playing, unless that's a smoke screen. Until conferences mandate an injury policy like the NFL, coaches will be as vague as possible because it suits their own self-interest.\"\nDoes Texas Tech have a chance against Baylor if Patrick Mahomes doesn't play? Davis Webb has a nice arm, but he doesn't seem to have the killer instinct Patty has.\nCarlton: \"It would probably be difficult for Webb, who is a quality quarterback. He'll put points on the board. Mahomes has brought the dimension of mobility and avoided turnovers. Tech simply can't afford too many empty possessions against the nation's No. 1 offensive team.\"\nSo have the murmurs about Kliff Kingsbury subside a bit with their strong start to the season?\nCarlton: \"I just don't know how serious the murmurs were about Kliff Kingsbury to begin with. He has a massive buyout in his contract if he's let go. So no matter what happened this season short of a meltdown, he was going to be back for 2016. And Tech has shown considerable progress and looks to have a good chance to make a bowl.\"\nBaylor-TTU has an over/under of 89.5. That's laughable five years ago. Is it too low today?\nCarlton: \"Consider: TCU at Tech had an over-under of 83.5. Look what happened with 107 points. So is it too low? If I was a betting man, I'd take the over.\"\nHad Jakeem Grant switched the field last weekend and wound up in the end zone, where would Texas Tech's final play have ranked among the all-time great endings?\nCarlton: \"It certainly would have a strong claim for the best finish in Tech history, even over Harrell-to-Crabtree to beat Texas. I don't now if it would have matched any of these compiled by USA Today among the top finishes in history. But yeah, Tech's three-lateral score would have in the discussion for the next group of 10 or 15 just below those five. It came amazingly close as is.\"\nCLICK HERE FOR FULL CHAT.\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/2013/11/30/ranking-the-five-best-college-football-finishes-of-all-time/3792641/", "https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:30:48.552+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
