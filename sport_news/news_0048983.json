During the first round of district Sept. 19, Brownsville Veterans prevailed 28-26, 25-22, 25-22 on its home court over Hanna. \nThe Lady Chargers (9-1) remain within striking distance of 32-6A leader Los Fresnos (10-0). Each team has clinched a playoff spot. Hanna (7-3) stays in sole possession of third place, and San Benito (5-5) is alone in fourth. \nBrownsville Veterans and Los Fresnos shared district titles the past two seasons. They play each other one more time in district on Oct. 24 at Los Fresnos. \nLady Chargers coach Lisa Mares was pleased to see her girls get off to a fast start during each of the first two games by taking leads of 6-1 and 5-1, respectively. \nMegan Sanchez was a standout for the Lady Chargers with 12 kills and four aces. Teammates Sarah Sandoval and Ashley Tumlinson added seven and six kills, respectively, and Sandoval also had 14 digs and two aces. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T03:01:10.215+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
