They have grown the team. They have brought in some experienced players but are relying a lot on youth, some local people coming through, keeping them together, building a team. \n\"It is going to be difficult. They are together, they are a strong group and we will have to play at our very best.\" \nSaints will hand full debuts to three forwards in Kieran Brookes, Michael Paterson and Jamie Gibson while the Warriors will have even more of a new look with Donncha O'Callaghan, Phil Dowson, Wynand Olivier, Tom Heathcote and Darren Barry all set for Sixways bows. \nDirector of rugby Dean Ryan said: \"This is our opportunity to play here and represent the club in the top flight of rugby. We are genuinely excited about seeing Northampton here. This is exactly where we want to be.\" \nElsewhere, Harlequins will host Wasps while Gloucester travel to Newcastle. \nWasps and Harlequins are among the sides being tipped to challenge for the title along with the likes of Northampton, champions Saracens, last year's beaten finalists Bath and Leicester. \nWasps director of rugby Dai Young said: \"Quins versus Wasps games are always nail-biting, nervy encounters, which tend to go down to the wire. Both teams like to play attractive, ball in hand, attacking rugby. \n\"For the neutral supporter, they are normally great games to watch. For Wasps and Quins fans, it's probably a little bit more nerve-racking, but it's a really good game for the opening night of the season.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:13:03.332+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
