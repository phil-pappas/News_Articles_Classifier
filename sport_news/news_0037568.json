Along with a loss, the Indians received bad news this week in the form of a season-ending knee injury to senior linebacker Alec Jimerson, who as much the heart of a defense that had allowed just six points combined in three games prior to last week. Jimerson’s response this week through his Twitter feed was “My Boys will still get the Job done.” We’ll definitely take his word for it on Homecoming Night at Garland Shoemake. INDIANS 42, FALCONS 7. \nCAMPBELL SPARTANS (2-4, 0-3 IN REGION 3- ) AT NEWNAN COUGARS (4-2, 2-1): Newnan also suffered its first region defeat last week despite starting strong against Westlake. Unlike the Lions, though, there doesn’t expect to be any surprise starters at quarterback when Campbell comes to Drake Stadium for Homecoming Night. In order for Newnan’s final two games of the regular season against East Coweta and Hughes to make a difference, it will have to get back to busi- ness as usual tonight. Considering how Newnan played in its last home appearance (a 49-21 blowout of Douglas County), having three dates at Drake over the final four games is a defi- nite plus. COUGARS 38, SPARTANS 6. \nFOREST PARK PANTHERS (0-6, 0-3 IN REGION 4A- ) AT NORTHGATE VIKINGS (6-0, 3-0): Things Forest Park needs to upset Northgate this week would start with swine flu in the Vikings locker room. Northgate fans need to take a good hard look tonight on Homecoming at Henry Seldon Field and see just how far the Vikings have come as a program the past five years when compared to the struggles that a one-proud Forest Park program now face. Hard to believe that Super Bowl MVP Hines Ward carried the Panthers to prominence not so long ago. And who knows, maybe Northgate has one on this year’s roster considering just how well things have gone. VIKINGS 56, PANTHERS 0. \nHOLY SPIRIT COUGARS (3-4, 2-2 IN GISA REGION 1-AAA) AT HERITAGE SCHOOL HAWKS (3-4, 2-1): Heritage welcomed a week off, especially after being hampered by injuries that have played a role in all four losses so far, two of which by less than a field goal. The good news on Homecoming night is that the Hawks will not only be well rested, but have had plenty of time to work on Holy Spirit’s option offense. The Cougars managed an early score in their last appearance against Trinity Christian before being held in check. Expect the same tonight from Heritage while jumping back into the thick of the playoff race in 1-AAA. HAWKS 28, COUGARS 7. \nTRINITY CHRISTIAN LIONS (4-2, 3-0 IN GISA REGION 1-AAA) AT BETHLEHEM CHRISTIAN KNIGHTS (2-5, 1-2): Trin- ity takes a four-game win streak into tonight’s game and faces another imposing quarterback in Knights’ 6-foot-6 senior Jacob Parker, who has committed to play baseball at Georgia Southern. Unlike Dominion, which carried less than 20 players in last week’s trip to Sharpsburg, Bethlehem has the numbers to match up with Trinity. The Lions haven’t let adversity get in their way despite giving up big plays in each of its last three victories. Trinity gets the job done again tonight before getting a chance to focus on showdowns with Loganville and Heritage to decide first, second and third in the region. LIONS 42, KNIGHTS 21.
