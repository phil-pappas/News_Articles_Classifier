The Turkish ace pounced after a Conor Washington shot had been saved and a Lee Angol follow-up blocked.And Posh completed the comeback courtesy of an inspired substitution as Souleymayne Coulibaly tucked away an Oztumer pass in the 81st minute - only two minutes after he had arrived from the bench.But Posh were quickly hit by a sucker punch as Power raced onto a Grant Holt pass to earn Wigan all three points.
