(Photo: Kim Klement-USA TODAY Sports) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nMultiple reports are stating that Will Grier will be suspected the rest of the 2015 season for NCAA violation. \nThis is being reported by GridironNow.com's Mike Huguenin and another from ESPN's Brett McMurphy. \nSince taking over the starting job against Tennessee, Grier has emerged as a steady option for the Gators under center and was already on pace to have the best statistical season for a Florida quarterback since Tim Tebow. Through six games Grier has totaled 1,204 yards and 10 touchdowns on 65.8 percent passing at 7.5 yards per attempt. \nSophomore Treon Harris, who has been suspended already this season as well, will likely take over the quarterbacking duties with Grier sidelined. Harris will be tasked with continuing the development of this offense, which has far exceeded expectations during the Gators' 6-0 start to the season. If Florida is going to continue its chase of an SEC East title, the entire offense must raise its level of play to make up for the loss of Grier.
