Louisville vs. Florida State football team | 3 keys and a prediction \n“They have been the premier team in our league with the national championship (two years ago) and a trip to the playoffs last year,” Louisville coach Bobby Petrino said. “So it's a great challenge for us, and you certainly get excited. Our guys have a lot of energy and a lot of focus.” \nAfter losing 11 NFL draft selections, including No. 1 pick and former Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback Jameis Winston, the Seminoles, who are favored by a touchdown Saturday, aren’t seen as quite the juggernaut of years past. FSU, which was picked second behind Clemson in the ACC Atlantic Division in the preseason media poll, is averaging just 22.3 points in its three ACC games after averaging 33.7 against power-conference teams last year and 47.9 against BCS-conference opponents in 2013. \nNow with Notre Dame graduate transfer Everett Golson playing quarterback instead of Winston, FSU is averaging 229 yards passing, about 74 fewer than in 2014. A homecoming for U of L players and coaches \nBut the Noles have a new superstar in electric running back Dalvin Cook. \nThe sophomore is coming off a 222-yard rushing game against Miami, and his average of 158 yards per game is second-best in the Football Bowl Subdivision. He’s helped FSU average 203 yards per game on the ground in all, about 65 more than in 2014. \n“They don't get a lot better (than Cook),” FSU coach Jimbo Fisher said. “He's a very special guy. And ability, we get caught up in that, it's phenomenal. But it's the intangibles, man. I mean, it's just the ability to compete, the ability to learn, the mental toughness, the fortitude, and his drive to be great.” \nFSU’s defense is improved, too. The Seminoles are allowing just 14 points per game and have the nation’s No. 22 total defense after ranking No. 63 in 2014. \nLouisville offensive coordinator Garrick McGee said the Seminoles feature a fast defense that usually has at least five defensive backs on the field at all times. \n“Most of the games we’ve studied, they have forced the offense to not play very well,” McGee said. 5 questions | Breaking down Florida State \nLouisville will try to get another big game from freshman quarterback Lamar Jackson, a Floridian who was recruited by the Seminoles. He’ll be seeking his third consecutive – and fourth overall – 100-yard rushing game while the Cards also try to jump-start their passing and get more of their backs rolling in the run game. \nThat endeavor includes another week in Louisville’s seemingly never-ending search to find its best mix of five offensive linemen. U of L has started nine different O-linemen so far this season. \nTrue freshman offensive tackle Kenny Thomas made his debut as a starter against NC State on Oct. 3, and it’s possible U of L will tweak the lineup again if it brings back former starter Tobijah Hughley as the No. 1 center or tries junior-college transfer Kiola Mahoni – “a very, very powerful run-blocker,” Petrino said – as a No. 1 guard for the first time. \nThe coach said his team worked hard on shoring up the overall running game during its off week, and Petrino’s teams tend to do well following a break. He is 15-5 as a head coach in regular season games in which he had at least eight days to prepare. U of L alternate uniforms back for FSU game \nU of L put a scare into FSU in 2014, leading 21-0 in the second quarter before succumbing to a Winston-led rally and losing 42-31. \nEven though Louisville started 0-3 this season, a victory Saturday would position the Cards still to reach just about any preseason expectations. The second half of their schedule looks more manageable on paper, and a U of L team that could defeat FSU on the road could very well be favored to win each of its remaining games. \n“It would mean everything (to beat FSU),” receiver James Quick said. \nU of L linebacker James Burgess said winning Saturday would provide some payback after the Noles won in the Cards’ stadium last year, and it would boost U of L’s chances in the ACC. \n“We know we’re on the road right now,” he said. “Our defense is playing with confidence. Our offense is playing with confidence. We’re studying a lot of film. We’re very confident and doing a good week of preparing. I think we’re ready.\" 11 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cjky.it/1LyvdDc TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T06:39:11.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
