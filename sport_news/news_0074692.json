Two solid outings against the best in the west, both wins if not for rotten luck, were topped by a victory at B.C . that put Winnipeg back in the playoff hunt. The Bombers were pushed around in the first half on the Left Coast, but pushed right back in the second as they came from 23-9 down to win on a Sergio Castillo field goal at 0.0. Castillo was brought in after Lirim Hajrullahu (still the punter) missed four three-pointers the week before. Lots happening here, including a blocked punt TD, a superb fake punt late to keep a drive going, a third and seven major at desperation time by Matt Nichols.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T04:01:23.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
