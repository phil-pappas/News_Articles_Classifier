The win ensures the Italians qualify automatically for the 2019 showpiece in Japan. The match started with strong counter-rucking from the Azzurri which saw them winning a penalty but they missed touch. The Romanians had the first scrum in the fourth minute and won a penalty that Florin Vlaicu slotted over for a 3-0 lead. The men in blue nearly scored a try in the seventh minute after Edoardo Gori chipped over the Oaks’ defence, but the Italian scrumhalf could not gather over the line as he lost it forward. Jacques Brunel’s boys scored their first try in the tenth minute after Leonardo Sarto finished off a well-worked backline move and the right wing found himself on the left side of the field. The conversion was missed. Brunel’s boys won a penalty after stretching the eastern Europeans’ defence which resulted in a high tackle from Paula Kinikinilau. The yellow jerseys shoved off their own ball in the 23rd minute and Italy received the scrum five metres out which resulted in a try by Gori, and Tomasso Allan converted. Romania lost the ball after getting the backline involved giving the Italians a penalty for holding on in the 33rd minute. The home side scored a try after a beautiful run from Allan, who sliced through the Romanian defence and had the pace to round the last defender with ease. The flyhalf was was accurate with the conversion to hand his country a 22-3 lead going into half-time. Both sides started the second half slowly with aimless kicking but the Azzurri had a try in the 46th minute after Alessandro Zanni powered over from the base of the scrum and Allan’s conversion was good. The Oaks got a break after referee Romain Poite missed a clear offside in the 65th minute. A minute after, Adrian Apostol scored a try which came from a good scrum and the eastern Europeans finally had something to show for their efforts. Vlaicu added the extra two to become Romania’s all-time leading points scorer at World Cups. Allan kicked over a penalty for Italy in the 70th minute to put the result beyond doubt at 32-10. However a late TMO decision awarded Romania a try in the 75 minute courtesy of Valentin Poparlan and for good measure they were over the line again with a minute to go. This time Apostol went over to bring some respectability to the scoreline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T18:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T19:32:56.891+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
