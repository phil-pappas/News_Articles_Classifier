It wasn't a lack of effort. There's not many teams on Cabot's level right now.\" \nThe Panthers finished with 385 total yards, all rushing. \nJunior halfback Austin Morse ran 6 times for 88 yards and 2 first-half touchdowns. Junior quarterback Jarrod Barnes ran 14 times for 87 yards, including a 12-yard touchdown with 8:52 left in the first quarter to give Cabot a 7-0 lead. \nRoberts followed with a 13-yard touchdown run with 7:42 left in the first quarter. \nAfter Morse ran 9 yards for a touchdown at 2:36, he capped the early scoring flurry by taking an option pitch 63 yards with eight seconds left in the first quarter. \nCabot led 35-7 at halftime after Roberts ran 8 yards for a touchdown with 2:18 left in the second quarter. \nThe Panthers finished the first half with 302 total yards. Senior Caleb Schulte finished the game 6 of 6 on extra-point attempts. \n\"We did what we needed to do,\" Cabot Coach Mike Malham said following his 279th career victory. \"Got the win; got a conference win. They're really much improved over last year.\" \nMarion junior quarterback Tyler Holmes completed 10 of 30 passes for 224 yards and 2 touchdowns. \nHolmes completed an 80-yard touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Collin Chambers on the final play of the first quarter and a 55-yard touchdown pass to junior wide receiver Devin Blakely with 5:37 left in the third quarter. \nMarion's other touchdown came against reserves in the fourth quarter - a 7-yard run by junior tailback Tom Young at 1:34. \nYoung finished with 89 yards on 13 carries. The Patriots finished with 313 total yards. \nCabot won last year's meeting 42-6. \nSports on 10/03/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T10:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T05:35:54.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
