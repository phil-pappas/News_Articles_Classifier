And when the gunman moved to Mintz's classroom, he was shot several times as he charged and tried to block a door to keep the shooter from coming in. Then, he hit the floor, looked up at the gunman, and told him it was his son's birthday, at which point the gunman shot two more times.\nSomehow, Mintz survived seven gunshots, although he has two broken bones and a lot of rehabilitation ahead of him.\nSmiling from his hospital bed, the Army vet who charged the OR shooter sends thanks.

His brother told a news website Mintz had been stationed at both Fort Bragg and Joint Base Lewis-McChord.\nHis family members in North Carolina, where the 30-year-old is from, said they weren't surprised in the least that Mintz charged at the shooter Thursday.\nOne simply said, \"Sounds like something he'd do.\"\nThursday was Mintz’s 6-year-old son’s birthday.", "external_links": ["http://t.co/3JsnXUQdjm", "https://twitter.com/JeffKIRO7/status/649942143541211136", "http://t.co/YjB088pV1t"], "published": "2015-10-02T13:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:08:49.958+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
