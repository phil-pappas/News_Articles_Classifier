Crystal Whitten made sure her return to Pittsburg State ended well. The former Gorilla, who was named All-MIAA Honorable Mention as a freshman in 2012 before transferring after her sophomore year, helped the Fort Hays State Tigers to a 3-0 win over PSU volleyball team. Whitten had eight kills and 11 digs as the Tigers won 26-24, 25-13 and 25-21 at John Lance Arena on Saturday night. “It was exciting to come back and see all of my friends,” Whitten said. “It’s no hard feelings. It’s always good to be back in Pittsburg.” She added that there was no extra weight on her playing against her former team. “There was a little bit added pressure, but it was all good,” she said. Whitten had a total of eight points for the Tigers. “It’s always tough to come back to the school that you left and not be nervous or pressed too much,” said Fort Hays State head coach Kurt Kohler. “I thought she stayed really relax and did her job well. We just didn’t play around her very well. She’s a good kid. She’s been working hard.” The Gorillas were prepared for Whitten. “Crystal is such a tough player,” said PSU head coach Jenny Muller. “She’s got a great powerful arm swing. She’s very dynamic. We were ready to face her because we knew how hard it was going to be. Block-wise, we did a good job of giving her a big wall in front of her so she had to move the ball around. She had to use her role shot, and move the ball around instead of having that power shot available. I felt like we did a good job against her. We didn’t let her put the ball on the floor too many times without a body falling over or the ball coming back up.” Maggie Highberger had seven kills for the Gorillas while Noelle Dooley and Lana DaSilva had five each. Taylyn Schwartz had two aces while Erin Wolford recorded six blocks. Hayley Hansford had 14 assists and Ashlen Schwartz had 19 digs. For the Tigers, Mallory Flagor had 11 kills while putting up eight digs. Rebekah Spainhour had nine kills. The Gorillas (1-19, 1-8 in MIAA) started off with a 4-3 run after an attack error placed PSU ahead. Their lead wouldn’t last as the Tigers (12-10, 4-6) responded in the form of a kill by Megan Anderson to start a 12-7 run by Fort Hays State. Page 2 of 3 - PSU still kept it close, coming to within five points after a kill by Taylor Unke. Pittsburg State used a 4-0 run to narrow the Tigers’ lead to 22-19 before FHSU called a timeout. The Gorillas came out of the timeout firing, with three more points, and the Tigers took another timeout. Two attack errors and a kill by DaSilva tied the set at 22. But the Tigers went right back up after a kill by Spainhour. The Gorillas answered back with a kill by Unke, tying the set at 23. But the Gorillas could not finish the first set as the Tigers used a kill by Crystal Whitten and an attack error by Unke to take the 26-24 win in set one. “First set was tight,” Muller said. “A lot of great plays by both teams. We had a few mistakes that put us over the top. The mistakes were by us making great shot selections, but we were missing by six or eight inches. If the ball had been inside the courts (on those shots) that would’ve fallen. Those choices were correct, we just have to find a way to keep it inside the court. Second set was slow. We dug a hole and it was tough to get out of that hole. We had a little bit of a discussion in a timeout and they came back and played together. We had a big rally on momentum from aggressive serving. My libero, Ashlen Schwartz, was great tonight. She picked up a ton of balls.” Fort Hays State began the second set on a 10-4 run. The Tigers had little trouble staying in control of the second match, cruising to an 18-8 lead after an attack error by Maggie Highberger before PSU called a timeout. Fort Hays State came out of the break with a 7-5 run to close out the second, 25-13. “I didn’t think we played very good defense,” Kohls said. “PSU is a scrappy team and I thought they were going to come out and hit strong. They had a bunch of hitting errors to open the match, but our kids weren’t playing great defense. Once we picked that up, I thought the match swung our way.” Both teams were neck-and-neck in the third set, when a Tigers’ error allowed the Gorillas to tie the set at 13. Fort Hays State responded with a 3-0 run with kills by Mallory Flaggor, Megan Anderson and Spainhour. FHSU made it 19-14 after DaSilva’s attack error. Soon after, an attack error by Ashlen Schwartz gave the Tigers a 22-16 advantage. Page 3 of 3 - Then, PSU used a quick 4-0 run that began with a kill by Lauren Regier and ended with a service ace by Taylyn Schwartz. After a FHSU timeout, the Gorillas responded with a kill by Regier to narrow the deficit to one point. However, the Tigers closed out with a 3-0 run for the 25-21 win and the 3-0 victory. “We haven’t had any 3-0 wins this year, but I thought PSU did a great job of staying with us and fighting until the end,” Kohler said. “That’s the sign of a team that’s on the verge of winning a lot of games. They have some talent. Coach Muller does a great job with her players.” Muller spoke highly of her team’s ability to come back in all sets. “The fact that our record is what it is right now and that we can still comeback and have confidence in ourselves, that says good things about our team and the character of our team,” Muller said. “Yes, we’re frustrated because we’re not winning, but that’s expected, but we haven’t given up and that’s the biggest positive thing for us.” For the Tigers, the win ended a two-game losing streak with losses to Washburn and Central Oklahoma. “This win was so important to turn our season around,” Whitten said. “It felt really good and we played very well as a team.” By Michael Bauer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:55:04.003+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
