In Ryan’s six seasons, the Jets were 1-5 coming off byes, and new coach Todd Bowles took a similar approach to Ryan by not working his team hard during the bye week. He did so because they were banged-up and coming off an overseas trip. The Jets are trying to keep pace with New England before next week’s showdown at the Pats. \nRedskins: Washington has alternated wins and losses this season and is coming off a defeat, but there’s not much in the way of tangible signs to suggest an upset. The Redskins will be missing six starters due to injury, including WR DeSean Jackson (hamstring), downgraded Saturday from questionable to out. Washington is 0-2 on the road. \nKEY MATCHUP \nJets WR Brandon Marshall vs. Redskins CB Bashaud Breeland or CB Will Blackmon. With starting corners DeAngelo Hall (toe) and Chris Culliver (knee) ruled out for this game, Washington figures to have a tough time covering standout receiver Marshall, who has developed a rapport with QB Ryan Fitzpatrick in their first season together. Breeland was a fourth-round draft pick in 2014 and Blackmon is a journeyman who was signed last month. Neither figures to be able to cover Marshall effectively. \nHOW THEY’LL WIN \nJets: The offense needs to take full advantage of Washington’s patchwork secondary. Of course, the game plan still will include heavy doses of RB Chris Ivory, which should set up the play-action game for Fitzpatrick. The defense, which gets back the formerly suspended Sheldon Richardson, should have its way against a offensive line missing C Kory Lichtensteiger and LT Trent Williams because of injury. \nRedskins: Washington is averaging 4.1 yards per rush and will try to run the ball behind a makeshift O-line. QB Kirk Cousins’ best option in an also-depleted receiving corps is veteran WR Pierre Garcon, who leads the team with 22 receptions and two TDs. The defense has recorded 12 sacks, but figures to have its hands full against the Jets, who have allowed only two sacks of Fitzpatrick. Special teamer Rashad Ross had a 101-yard kickoff return for a TD against the Giants. \n— J.P.
