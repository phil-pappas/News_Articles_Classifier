(AP) - An elderly man whose body was found in a trash can behind his home had been dead several weeks before he was discovered.\nThe Sun Herald reports ( http://bit.ly/1LrZd28 ) Harrison County Coroner Gary Hargrove released autopsy details Friday involving 87-year-old Edward A. Miller. Hargrove says the autopsy confirmed Miller's identity, but the cause of death remains under investigation.\nPolice say the woman arrested Thursday was Miller's live-in girlfriend, 63-year-old Christy Lee Zarrella. She faces a felony charge of tampering with evidence and a misdemeanor charge of failing to report a death. She's being held on $250,000 bond. Online jail records do not list an attorney for Zarrella.\nMiller's friends reported him missing about 3:30 p.m. Monday. On Thursday, investigating officers noticed a suspicious odor that led them to his remains.\nInformation from: The Sun Herald, http://www.sunherald.com\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
