There was confusion with the lane striping that designates where drivers are supposed to get in and out of the new express toll lanes.\nAnd there were two crashes there Wednesday, one in the afternoon, and one just before 11 p.m.\nBut numbers from the State Patrol are on track for fewer crashes this October than last October.\nIn 2014, there were 285 collisions in October. This year, there have only been 189 crashes so far with nine days left in the month, which would be on track for an estimated 265 for October -- 20 fewer than last year.\nMeanwhile, the State Patrol said it has issued 372 tickets and has warned more than 1,200 drivers about violations since the tolls started late last month.\nMost of those were for people illegally crossing the double lines and illegally driving in the HOV lane.\nForty-three other drivers have been cited for avoiding the tolling stations. Troopers say they get out of the toll lanes just before the payment sensors and then get back into the toll lanes.\nTroopers said soon, they're going to switch from giving warnings to issuing more tickets.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T15:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:50:39.453+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
