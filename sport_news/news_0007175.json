We have been instructed that the information must be kept confidential and therefore we cannot go into specifics. \n\"As a result of learning this information, the FA board has this morning concluded that it must suspend its support for Mr Platini's candidature for the FIFA presidency until the legal process has been concluded and the position is clear. \n\"A decision can then be taken on who to support in the Presidential election on February 26 2016.\" \nThe FA said it supported UEFA's statement that Platini, who remains president of the European governing body, had a right to a fair process and for it to be carried out by mid-November. \nIt added: \"The FA supports the statement issued by UEFA on Thursday concerning the ethics case against Michel Platini. \n\"This statement expressed respect for the significant work performed by Mr Platini at UEFA, requested that he be afforded due process in contesting the charges, and encouraged the relevant bodies involved to reach a final decision on the merits of the case by mid-November. \n\"The FA wishes Mr Platini every success in fighting these charges and clearing his name, and has no interest in taking any action that jeopardises this process.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:10:51.078+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
