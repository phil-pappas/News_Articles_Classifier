His freshman brother, Sam, placed second with a time of 16:55.8. The Affolders also finished first and second, respectively, in their debut at the league meet last year. \n“It’s always a pleasure when we can finish first and second, whether it’s in a dual meet or a big invitational,” Noah Affolder said. “That’s something that him and I take a lot of pride in, and we enjoy it when we can do it.” \nSam Affolder finished nearly a minute ahead of the third-place runner, South Lewis senior Grant Domagala, who finished in 17:52. \n“That’s always a goal. Having (Noah) there, he’s such a good pace-setter and I wouldn’t be able to do it without him,” Sam Affolder said. “From the start, I was trying to keep up with Noah as much as I could through that first mile knowing it would be flat and fast, and I knew I couldn’t hold that pace going through the hills, but it got me a good lead on the next group and I was able to maintain that and build on that.” \nNoah Affolder’s victory was made all the more impressive by the fact that he forgot to insert the spikes into his racing shoes. \nAffolder said that Carthage coach Bryan Zevotek, who anticipated a muddy track after the area received rain on Tuesday, told the team to remove their spikes and he would provide bigger replacements to improve their traction. \n“When I saw the size of the spikes he wanted us to put in, I told myself that there’s no way I can wear those,” said Affolder, who improved his winning time from last year’s league meet by 23 seconds. “And I just forgot to put the other spikes back in, which was a dumb mistake, but it happens. I slipped a little bit on some wet grass and again on some leaves, but I’m just thankful I didn’t get hurt.” \nBrian Lamonica and Kurt Naumann finished fifth and seventh, respectively, as Carthage took its second straight team title with 26 points. The Comets also went unbeaten in league dual meets for the second consecutive season. \n“This year, we had the mind-set that we needed to prove ourselves again and not just remember how good we were last year but try to give all we can this year as well,” Noah Affolder said. \nSophomore Connor Demo (17:55) finished fourth to pace Beaver River, which placed second in the team standings with 52 points. The Beavers were missing on of their top runners, senior Brett Neddo, who couldn’t run due to injury. South Lewis scored 92 points, good for a third-place finish. \nGIRLS RACE \nMoore crossed the finish line 16 seconds ahead of classmate Shauna Rice (21:21) to pace the Beavers, who won their third straight league championship with a score of 17. \nSophomore Sierra Kempney (21:30) and freshman Rylee Campeau (21:36) were close behind to place third and fourth, respectively, while senior Victoria Rollin (22:10) and sophomore Emily Lighthall (22:19) each added a top-10 finish. \n“We definitely worked hard for this all season and we’re really happy to get the win,” Moore said. “We’re just really happy to win this as a team and win it together.” \nMoore and Rice finished second and third last season and were the highest returning finishers among this year’s field. \nLast year, Rice led for much of the race until she collapsed about 50 yards in front of the finish-line. \n“I think they were both very determined,” Beaver River coach Cheryl Steiner said. “(Moore) knew she was ranked first coming in so she was really focused to keep that place, and (Rice), because of what happened last year, she also wanted some revenge for that. So they both wanted it badly.” \nSouth Lewis senior Christina Platt (21:38), who finished fifth behind the Beaver River foursome, led for about the first half of the race but was passed by Moore and Rice entering a hilly portion of the course in the second mile. \n“The first part of the race was easy because it was flat, but it became a little more challenging to catch her when we hit the hills,” Rice said. “I kept telling myself to power through the hills, and I brought the power.” \nPlatt’s teammate, junior Morgan Burd, came in at sixth to help the Falcons to a second-place team finish with 49 points. Taylor Lamonica, a 7th-grader, finished ninth to pace Carthage, which finished third in the team standings with 82 points.
