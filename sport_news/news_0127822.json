He's been joining the group and from a medical point of view I don't think there is a concern or worry.\" \nEverton are also set to have Seamus Coleman returning to their team on Saturday. \nThe full-back, sidelined recently by a hamstring complaint, played his first match in a month when he turned out for the Republic of Ireland against Poland on Sunday.
