The Red Raiders continue to get gashed on the ground -- freshman Iowa State running back Mike Warren ran for 245 yards on 23 carries -- and early penalties could have taken a much worse toll against a more talented team.\nHere's a look at how some national and regional members of the media saw the game:\nDon Williams, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal : \"Tech's three interceptions were one of the many positives to be taken from Saturday. Sophomore corner Tevin Madison picked off Iowa State quarterback Sam Richardson on the Cyclones' first play from scrimmage, setting up a touchdown three plays later that got Tech off to a 10-0 lead. The Red Raiders need all the takeaways they can get at this point, because their generous yield remains alarming. Iowa State receiver Quenton Bundrage caught passes for 33 and 36 yards. Running back Mike Warren ripped off runs of 46, 51, 17 and 47 yards.\"\nNic Shimonek now in at QB for Tech. Has the most impressive arm tattoo of the Red Raiders' QBs.\n— Don Williams (@AJ_DonWilliams) October 10, 2015\nTech finishes with 776 yards. modern era Tech record. Had 775 vs Iowa State in 2003.\n— Don Williams (@AJ_DonWilliams) October 10, 2015 Nicholas Talbot, Lubbock Avalanche-Journal : \"One thing is certain, though. Texas Tech needs big plays to make its offense work. In its three wins to start the season, the Red Raiders' offense had 10 touchdowns of more than 25 yards. It had three against TCU as it gave the No. 2 team in the nation all it could handle in a 55-52 loss. Against Baylor, in Tech's worst game of the season, it had two early (21-14 early) in the 63-35 loss. Saturday it had six -- from five different players -- in a complete demolishing of Iowa State.\"\nMax Olsen, ESPN : \"Texas Tech got back to doing what it does best: scoring a ton of points in all sorts of ways. Patrick Mahomes was unstoppable, throwing for 428 yards and five touchdowns in three quarters of work, and seven different Red Raiders found the end zone on the day. Some pundits were putting Texas Tech up on upset alert Saturday morning, but this team is playing up to its big potential and looks like a lock to go back to a bowl game -- and possibly achieve a lot more.\"\nPatrick Mahomes threw for 371 yards, 4 TDs in first half vs. ISU. Kliff was asked how he did it. \"Yeah, that's...all coaching.\"\n— Max Olson (@max_olson) October 10, 2015 Bonus: Olsen's ESPN colleague Jake Trotter has Texas Tech going back to a bowl in his latest projections with an appearance in the Advocare V100 Texas Bowl.\nJeremy Krakowsy, The Daily Toreador : \"Mahomes is one of the best quarterbacks in the country: Sophomore quarterback Patrick Mahomes II is in the top-10 in the country in almost all passing categories, despite barely playing in the fourth quarter this season. Through the third quarter against Iowa State, after which he was taken out, Mahomes was 33 of 46 for 428 yards and five touchdowns with no interceptions. The sophomore quarterback's knee still did not look 100 percent, but he was still able to extend numerous plays and make accurate throws on the run. Once again, Mahomes was not sacked for an entire game.\"\nBobby La Gesse, Ames Tribune : \"There is a lot of impressive offensive numbers from this game. Not all are from Texas Tech. A 7.0 rushing yard average would be cause for ISU celebration back in the preseason when the ground game was still a big question mark. The biggest takeaway, at least from a numerical standpoint, is the importance of explosive plays. ISU had a decent number. But Texas Tech had a great one. The Cyclones learned, not for the first time in recent years, that it's extremely hard for them to win without limiting the big plays of the Air Raid offenses that populate the Big 12.\"\nOn Twitter:\n @TommyMagelssen", "external_links": ["http://redraiders.com/filed-online/2015-10-10/williams-its-all-about-takeaways-texas-tech-defense-giving-big-yards#.VhrlAflVhBc", "https://twitter.com/AJ_DonWilliams/status/652985809176432640", "http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/104864/big-12-week-6-bowl-projections-tcu-holds-on-to-playoff-spot", "https://twitter.com/TommyMagelssen", "http://amestrib.com/sports/stats-101-isu-texas-tech-provided-lesson-explosive-plays", "http://www.dailytoreador.com/sports/five-takeaways-from-tech-s-first-big-win-of/article_c4d7c0ba-6faf-11e5-baf8-8bef29438c76.html", "https://twitter.com/AJ_DonWilliams/status/652981692156653568", "http://espn.go.com/blog/big12/post/_/id/104826/texas-tech-offense-back-on-fire-with-66-31-blowout-of-iowa-state", "https://twitter.com/max_olson/status/652958148001595392", "http://redraiders.com/filed-online/2015-10-10/wide-open-texas-techs-big-play-offense-putting-it-position-big-season#.VhrlZvlVhBc"], "published": "2015-10-12T01:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:40:20.737+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
