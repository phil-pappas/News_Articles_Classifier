But we can’t really look that far ahead yet. We still have games left to play and we’ll take them one at a time, playing hard all the way.” \nDespite the loss, their second in a row, the Lady Greyhounds (8-13, 4-5) remain in playoff contention and coach Ruby Medina said she wanted to make sure her team remained upbeat. \n“They just have to keep on working hard, and due to whatever happened we can’t focus on that because we have to keep on playing as a team and play as hard as they can go,” she said. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:51:53.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
