After Tuesday, he said he felt good on some things but didn’t feel like he could truly open it up yet. I think a lot of that is the confidence to let it go to open it up. \n“I’m anxious to see what he does (Thursday) and how he feels after that. As long as he keeps making progress, that makes you feel good.” \nUW said Clement would miss four to six weeks following surgery, which was performed the week of the Badgers’ loss to Iowa. \nHowever, Clement’s surgeon, world-renowned sports hernia specialist Ulrike Muschaweck, told the State Journal that the general timetable for the Minimal Repair technique that she uses is typically two to three weeks. \n“Four to six weeks is very long,” Muschaweck told the State Journal earlier this month. “I think they didn’t know about the fast recovery. Sometimes the patients, because of abductor pain, can take four weeks, but four to six weeks is very long. Normally it’s between two to three weeks. \n“But only depending on the pain. If the pain is still present, then (the patient) would perhaps wait one or two weeks longer, but the maximum wait is (typically) three weeks.” \nClement originally thought he suffered a groin injury Sept. 1 and attempted to play through it four days later in the Badgers’ season opener against Alabama. \nThat made the injury worse, and after Clement’s rehab did not progress, UW discovered through an MRI on Sept. 23 that he needed sports hernia surgery. \nClement said Sept. 24 that he regrets not being more forthright with how he was feeling during his pre-surgery rehab, and Muschaweck said it takes a specialist to detect a sports hernia without an MRI. \nMuschaweck also said patients cannot re-injure the area or destroy the surgical repair. She said returning to the field is only a matter of pain management. \n“There was a procedure done, which should take away that doubt,” Chryst said Thursday. “(Returning) is not going to hurt it more, and that’s where I think the medical staff has and will help him. This is where you’re at, and then he can feel free to go. \n“As he (continues to practice), we’ll get a feel, and I think it’ll be a group decision. It has to be.” Jason Galloway bio \nJason Galloway covers the Badgers football program for the Wisconsin State Journal.
