Dismal showing from the line. Eli Manning was sacked three times, tossed a terrible pick-six interception, Rashad Jennings lost a fumble and short-yardage again a nightmare. Putrid 4 of 13 in third-down conversions. Gained only 55 total yards in second half, which is embarrassing. Odell Beckham Jr. (7-61, 1 TD) battled through hamstring issue, but was shut out in second half.\nGrade : F\nDefense Three interceptions of Sam Bradford and one forced fumble for four turnovers — that ought to be enough to win most games. Too many big pass plays allowed and DeMarco Murray (22-109, 1 TD) erupted for 97 yards after halftime. Damontre Moore with an inexcusable (and dumb) roughing the passer penalty on third down — will the guy ever learn? Moore got a sack late in the first half with the Giants down 14-7 and deemed it the right time for a hideous dance. Really?\nGrade : B-minus\nSpecial teams Running into the punter penalty on Nikita Whitlock extended an Eagles’ offensive series. Punter Brad Wing had some rough moments, including kicks of 37 and 27 yards in the first half. Rough going for Dwayne Harris on punt returns. Jennings called for two penalties on one punt return, which is not easy to do.\nGrade : C\nCoaching Could Tom Coughlin have challenged the spot on key fourth down late in the first quarter? Sure he could have. Giants could have had a safety in the third quarter but were called for 12-men on the field when a defensive player was late running to the sideline. That’s a bad look. Picture-perfect opening drive for Ben McAdoo’s offense, almost nothing thereafter.\nGrade : C\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under new york giants ,  philadelphia eagles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:11:25.555+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
