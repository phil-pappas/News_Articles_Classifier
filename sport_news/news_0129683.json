Notre Dame hits the road for the second time this season after blowing out UMass last week. In the Irish's last road game, quarterback Malik Zaire was lost for the season after suffering a broken ankle. \nSwinney joked Monday in his press conference that the Irish have a secret weapon at their disposal. None other than Pope Francis, who visited the U.S. for the first time last week. \n\"I do think it's a little unfair that they brought the Pope into town just in time for the Clemson game, that's kind of a low blow,\" laughed Swinney. \"I said I couldn't get Jesus tickets, so I do think that's a low blow.\" \nBoth coaches know this week's game will present the biggest challenge of the young season. Brian Kelly complimented Clemson's defense during Wednesday's ACC teleconference, saying the Tigers have one of the most athletic defenses in the country. \n\"The entire secondary concerns you because of their ability to come down and support the run, but yet they play man coverage,\" said Kelly. \"I just think that they're a very athletic defense, from the defensive end position all the way back to cornerback. It will be the most talented and athletic defense that we've played this year.\" \nClemson's Swinney echoed those comments, touting Notre Dame's experience and athleticism. Swinney said as he and his staff study more film on the Irish, their players mirror a lot of what they see on their own roster. \n\"It's almost like were getting ready to go play Clemson,\" Swinney said. \"They pressure you, and they're effective at that. We have great skill and length, and speed on the back end, whether we are in man or zone. And their defense is exactly the same way.\" \nThe stats back up both coaches' claim. Clemson is ninth in the nation on total defense, surrendering an average of 260 yards per game. Notre Dame is 42 nd , allowing 341 yards per game. The Tigers have picked off opposing quarterbacks five times this season, ahead of last season's pace, when the Tigers collected 11 total interceptions. \nSep 26, 2015; South Bend, IN, USA; Notre Dame Fighting Irish running back Josh Adams (33) runs for a touchdown in the fourth quarter against the Massachusetts Minutemen at Notre Dame Stadium. Notre Dame won 62-27.

Notre Dame is 15 th in the nation on total offense. Notre Dame's rushing offense has racked up 1139 yards and 12 scores in four games. Kelly is hopeful the offensive line and ground game will challenge Clemson and take some of the pressure off of freshman quarterback Deshone Kizer, who is making his first career road start. \n\"With a freshman quarterback, you certainly want to lean on the five guys up front in this kind of game,\" Kelly told the media. \"I think he's going to have to get acclimated as the game wears on. You have to trust in his own poise. We can't take a quarterback that can't stand up to these kinds of environments because it will be raucous and it's very, very difficult to simulate that at practice.\" \nClemson quarterback Deshaun Watson was considered a favorite by many in the preseason to garner Heisman candidacy. Through three games, Watson has been inconsistent at times, with the talented sophomore tossing two interceptions at Louisville. It was the first time Watson has thrown multiple picks in a game. Kelly isn't worried about stats after watching film on the young passer. \n\"He's a game wrecker. He keeps you in a position where you've got to defend him as a runner and a thrower. He's got arm talent as a runner, which is a unique skill set,\" said Kelly, praising Watson's dual-threat capabilities. \nWith over 85,000 expected to fill Memorial Stadium on Saturday night, Kizer and the Irish will have to come out and set the tone early, or it could be a long night for the visitors from South Bend. ESPN's \"College Gameday\" will also be on hand, giving Clemson an opportunity to prove a worthy playoff contender. Swinney says while games like Saturday's are important to fans and the media, his team can't get wrapped up in the hype. \n\"It doesn't do anything if you don't win, it's just that simple. The last time they [Gameday] were here, we got waxed,\" said Swinney. \"We've been in a lot of these games, a lot of these games where we're playing a great opponent and we've just got to stay focused on what we do. That's why I think it's important that you are consistent with how you talk to your team, with how you prepare, regardless of who you play.\" Read or Share this story: http://www.wcnc.com/story/sports/2015/09/30/clemson-notre-dame-gearing-up-for-gigantic-matchup/73125248/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:48:01.157+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
