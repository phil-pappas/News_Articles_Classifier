Wouldn't seem normal any other way. With the Mets still steamed about a late slide by Chase Utley that broke Ruben Tejada's right leg, Harvey is set to start a pivotal Game 3 on Monday night against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the first playoff contest at Citi Field. Utley has been suspended two playoff games by Major League Baseball for his takeout slide. The natural question is, will Harvey retaliate against another Dodgers hitter? \"I think the most important thing is going out and doing my job and doing what's best for the team. For me, in my mind, that's going out and pitching a long game and being out there as long as I can, and keeping zeros on the board,\" Harvey said Sunday. \"But you know, as far as sticking up for your teammates, I think being out there and doing what's right is exactly what I'm going to do,\" he said. The best-of-five NL division series is tied 1-all after Utley's takeout slide swung Game 2 in Los Angeles, keying a four-run rally in the seventh inning Saturday night that sent the Dodgers to a 5-2 victory. \"Obviously the replay, everybody saw that it was more of a tackle than anything,\" Harvey said. \"We're all feeling for Ruben. We're going to pick him up, and we're excited to be back at home.\" Dodgers manager Don Mattingly said Utley tried to reach out and apologize to Tejada, who will be replaced at shortstop by Wilmer Flores. Matt Reynolds, a Triple-A infielder who has never played in the majors, was on his way to New York as a potential addition to the roster. With retaliation on everyone's mind, there is some thought Major League Baseball might instruct umpires to warn the Mets and Dodgers before Monday's game about throwing inside. \"I would personally hope that there wouldn't be such an issue, only because the impact it would have on the entire game itself, would change the way the game's supposed to be played,\" Mets manager Terry Collins said. \"And I'm not saying we're trying to protect anybody, but in the game of baseball, we do ask our pitchers to pitch inside once in a while, and the last thing we need is an umpire to take the games into his hands where he thinks it was on purpose. It is the purpose; that's why you pitch inside. And all of a sudden to create a mess that certainly wasn't intended.\" Mattingly sees it the same way. \"You do want it to be about back to the field,\" he said. \"I know it's fun to talk about all this stuff, and you hear about it all, and it gets a lot of attention, but I'm sure it won't go away. \"I don't think there needs to be any kind of warnings. Just let the game play,\" he added. By The Associated Press", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T18:43:26.733+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
