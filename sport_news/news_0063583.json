I'm excited for the opportunities that lie ahead. \n\"I'm really grateful that Hampshire are letting me leave early. I'd like to thank all the playing staff and the coaches that I've worked with at the club for all their support over the years.\" \nBriggs has taken 191 first-class wickets in 67 matches with his career-best of six for 45 coming for the England Lions in 2011. \nHis best form has often been in the shortest format, with his club-record 31 wickets inspiring Hampshire to domestic T20 glory five years ago.
