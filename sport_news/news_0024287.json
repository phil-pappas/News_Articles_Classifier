Throw in a 31-1 season as a freshman in doubles and Piaskowski has won over 100 varsity tennis matches over her career. \nThere’s just one win which has alluded her, a state title. \nTwice Piaskowski has entered the championships as the No. 1 seed and undefeated, her freshman and junior years, only to settle for silver instead of gold. \nWhen the WIAA Girls Individual State Tennis Tournament begins Thursday, she’ll once again be the top seed in Division 2 singles with a 24-1 mark. There’s simply no hiding what is on Piaskowski’s mind, a championship. \n“That’s my main goal,” Piaskowski said of bringing a title home Saturday. “...I would say I have a lot more experience there. I’m used to the surroundings. I’m a lot more prepared this year. Since I’ve taken second twice and third I really would like to win State this year.” \nThere’s also little bit of revenge on Piaskowski’s mind, with her opponent in last year’s championship match, Claire Czerwonka from Kenosha St. Joes, the No. 2 seed. State tennis preview \n“Yeah, actually I do,” Piaskowski said of wanting to face Czerwonka again should the seeds hold. “I beat her this year but I’d like to beat her again. It was a really good feeling because after a loss at State I played her first match of the year I was like this decides seeding right away.” \nThe Roncalli standout isn’t the only one making a fourth consecutive trip to the Nielsen Tennis Stadium in Madison. \nManitowoc Lincoln’s Bailey Budnik has also been to State every year of her career. She’s won at least one match every time, including a pair in each of the past two seasons at D1 singles. \n“It’s just amazing knowing all I’ve worked for these last four years and all while I was younger has finally paid off,” Budnik said. “You always dream because that’s your main goal in high school sports and it’s so surreal to be able to accomplish it.” \nLike Piaskowski, Budnik has unfinished business before she calls it a career. \n”I’d really like to get to Saturday which means you get to stand on the podium,” Budnik said. “That’d mean I’d have to win my first four matches which I’ve never done before but that’s been my goal all four years.” \nJoining Budnik in the D1 singles bracket is freshman teammate Halimae Laurino. Laurino, the Ships’ No. 2 behind Budnik, won her sectional flight to automatically qualify. \nLaurino says she’s relying heavily on what Budnik can tell her along with Lincoln’s No. 1 doubles tandem in senior Sydney Verbauwhede and junior Jen Belisle. \n“They have told me a lot about what it’s going to be like and the rooms and being together and all the experience on and off the court,” Laurino said. “I look forward to the next few years at Lincoln on the tennis team.” \nThe Ships duo reached State last season and knocked off the No. 15 seeded team in their opening match so reaching as a special qualifier for a second straight season doesn’t delude their confidence. \n“It’s a different experience, were not too nervous because we were there last year,” Belisle said. \n“We beat a seeded team last year so I’m taking away we can do just about anything if we focus hard enough,” Verbauwhede said. \nFor Roncalli, their No. 1 doubles pairing of seniors Maddie Salutz and Abby Welnetz has one returner in Salutz and Welnetz who is making her State debut. \nSalutz made she to pass along some pointers to her teammate. \n“I think a little bit of the pressure is off me because I know where I’m going, what it’s like and how tough the opponents are,” Salutz said. “I think I can tell (Abby) some of my experiences and really try to make her a little less nervous.” \n“I think my teammates have prepared me well,” Welnetz said of Salutz and Piaskowski. “We’re preparing like it’d be any other match. It’s a new experience for me but hopefully it’ll be a good one.” \nRoncalli coach Phil Kuenzi knows what it’s like to compete at doubles, having done so in doubles for the Jets from 2007-2010. \n“The Nielsen Tennis Stadium is a weird place, it can be kind of echoey,” Kuenzi said. “Just because it’s the state tournament you get nervous. Having been there myself you get ideas of just how to keep them from being nervous. I was lucky enough because I went as part of a doubles team. Singles players have it a little tougher because they don’t have someone backing them up.” \nWhether it’s for the fourth or first time, the one thing everyone agreed is each trip to State is special. \n“The experience will help,” Lincoln coach Jacques Verbauwhede said. “It’s a bigger building, it’s indoors. They’ve been there, there’s a crowd there. There’s people cheering. If you haven’t been there it can be intimidating but the girls have been there the last few years. They know what the building and experience is like although I’m sure they’ll still have nerves.” \nWIAA GIRLS TENNIS STATE TOURNAMENT SCHEDULE \nTHURSDAY", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T03:57:34.150+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
