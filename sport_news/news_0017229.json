The Houston game completes what should've been a relatively easier start to the season than what follows. At home, with some momentum, the Dolphins should pull to 3-3. \n\nDolphins Writer/Columnist Prediction: Dolphins 27, Texans 17 Comment: Despite last week's impressive win over the Titans, the Dolphins still have plenty of work to do to become respectable. They need better play at left guard, linebacker, safety and at the cornerback spot opposite Brent Grimes. Fortunately for the Dolphins, the Texans are banged up and on the road. \n\nDolphins Writer Prediction: Dolphins 24, Texans 20 Comment: The emotional high from routing the Titans did wonders for the Dolphins' confidence. Protecting their home field adds extra motivation. I’m not sure which is the better team, but the Dolphins should be the more confident team. \n\nSports Editor Prediction: Dolphins 24, Texans 20 Comment: Like the Dolphins, the Texans have a little more talent than their record suggests. And Houston is a perfect 2-0 against teams from the Sunshine State. But I’m riding the Dan Campbell wave for one more week. \n\nOnline Sports Editor Prediction: Dolphins 23, Texans 16 Comment: Dolphins fans are optimistic that Dan Campbell's inspired win in his first game as interim coach will be just the start of the team's turnaround. With a brutal stretch of games starting Thursday night at New England, beating the struggling Texans is a must. After playing the Patriots, the Dolphins have back-to-back road games against the Bills and Eagles, followed by games against the Cowboys (home) and Jets (road). \nMultimedia Reporter Prediction: Dolphins 31, Texans 16 Comment: The Dolphins likely will give Lamar Miller more touches and have Ryan Tannehill use his legs again. Tannehill has a streak of four straight games with multiple touchdown passes, the first Dolphins quarterback to do that in 20 years. Unfortunately, if Tannehill throws three interceptions, he would tie a Dolphins mark for most interceptions over a four-game stretch (10). The defense will continue to dominate (especially against a career journeyman such as Brian Hoyer) if Cameron Wake and Olivier Vernon pick up where they left off last week. \nCBS12 Sports Director Prediction: Dolphins 31, Texans 13 Comment: The Texans have some players that scare you: Arian Foster, DeAndre Hopkins and J.J. Watt. But beyond those three stars, this is a subpar team with a subpar quarterback. Dan Campbell keeps Dolphins aggressive and intense for a second straight week, leading to another lopsided win. \n\nHow do you think the Dolphins will fare this week?
