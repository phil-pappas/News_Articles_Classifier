Last week, investigators arrested a suspect. They say Tre Spadoni, 20, held up three students in the student center on Oct. 10. Investigators believe he also forced a 19-year-old to stop at three ATM's and attempt to withdraw money and held up four people while they sat in a car on Cleveland Avenue. At tonight's town hall, Tulane Police Superintendent Jon Barnwell will talk about the crimes and general campus safety. The meeting starts at 7 p.m. in Jones Hall, room 102. It is open to the entire Tulane community.\nLa. State Police, New Orleans City Council to discuss underage dancers\nNew Orleans Councilman Jason Williams will join Louisiana State Police and Covenant House today to talk about underage dancers and human trafficking in the city of New Orleans. They'll make a presentation to the city's Alcoholic Beverage Control Board. Leaders of Covenant House have asked the city to enforce existing laws that prohibit clubs from hiring anyone under 21 to dance. Some say it's a pipeline to human trafficking. They also called for tougher laws that would lead to businesses that violate the law being closed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T15:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T15:14:47.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
