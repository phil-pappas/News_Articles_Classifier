Image 12 of 12 Root Sports apologizes for on-air profanity as Astros celebrate first playoff berth in 10 years 1 / 12 Back to Gallery Root Sports Southwest apologized Sunday to viewers for on-air profanities used by the Astros during live coverage of the team's post-game celebration after clinching a berth in the American League wild card game.\nThe language took place as Astros manager A.J. Hinch spoke to players about 30 minutes into the clubhouse celebration.\n\"We got together in February and we talked about bringing our best every night. Nobody outside this clubhouse thought we had a chance and now look at us,\" Hinch said to players.\n\"Bleep 'em,\" said one player who was out of range of the network camera, which was stationed behind Hinch.\n\"They can say a lot of things about this team, right, but one thing they're going to say forever is we're a bleeping playoff team,\" Hinch continued. \"We'll have to earn a home game, and it will take a few more wins, but I'll bet on this team. I love you (censored).\"\nA few minutes after the comments, Root Southwest studio host Bart Enis said, \"We want to apologize to all of you for some of the language you heard in the clubhouse during the celebration. We know a lot of you were watching and we're seeing some of it on Twitter. You know, you go into the clubhouse with a live camera, that's just the way it goes.\"\ndavid.barron@chron.com\ntwitter.com/dfbarron", "external_links": ["http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725238/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725228/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725229/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725233/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725239/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725231/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725236/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725233/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725231/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725232/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725227/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725229/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725239/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww3.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725238/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725228/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725232/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725235/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725227/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725237/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww1.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725236/9/920x920.jpg", "http://ww4.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725235/9/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/22/13/8725237/9/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-05T06:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T09:09:11.077+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
