(Thomas Johnson/The Washington Post) \nCardinals vs. Steelers \nPeople who have been waiting all this time for Martavis Bryant to make his season debut will likely get it, but they shouldn’t expect much, particularly if Roethlisberger doesn’t play. Still, it will be nice to see the rangy WR out there, and his deep-ball skills could be put to use right away if Pittsburgh finds itself in catch-up mode. In 2014, Bryant averaged 21.1 yards per reception. \nChiefs vs. Vikings Will Charcandrick West become the lead back in Kansas City? (Charlie Riedel/AP Photo) \nHere’s hoping some readers took heed of my warning in this space last week that Knile Davis might not actually be the handcuff for Charles. Charcandrick West was the subject of frantic waiver claims and massive FAAB bids from coast to coast, and now his new owners will get a chance to see if the RB was worth it. Or will this be more of a committee, with Davis getting valuable goal-line looks? \nRedskins vs. Jets \nA lot of people picked up the Jets’ defense this week to play against the Redskins, and just as many will drop it next week, with New York set to visit New England. But for those who can spare an extra roster spot, the Jets would be a sneaky add at that point, because after the Pats, a unit that just got Sheldon Richardson back will have a mouth-watering slate through Week 14 (Raiders, Jags, Bills, Texans, Dolphins, Giants, Titans). \n[ Week 6 Start/Sit: Best bets to score big ] \nBears vs. Lions \nThe Bears are hoping Alshon Jeffery gets back on the field for the first time since Week 1, but Marquess Wilson owners could hardly be blamed for wanting Jeffery to take his sweet time and make sure that calf is fully healed. All Wilson has done in the past two weeks as Chicago’s default No. 1 WR is grab 12 balls for 165 yards and a score. His moment in the sun, though, may be brief. \nBroncos vs. Browns \nC.J. Anderson got his shot last year when the two guys above him on the depth chart proved unable, either by ineffectiveness or injury, to get the job done. Ronnie Hillman was one of those guys, and now both he and Anderson are struggling. That should make No. 3 RB Juwan Thompson a name worth knowing, except that a hamstring injury could be costing him a huge opportunity. \nTexans vs. Jaguars \nPricey free-agent acquisition Julius Thomas made his long-awaited debut for the Jags last week after a preseason hand injury, but he didn’t do much. With a game under his belt, though, Thomas can be expected to start contributing to fantasy lineups as the team’s pass-catching TE. As it happens, Bortles’s injury may have him looking to hit underneath routes more than usual. \n[ Stock Watch: Dump your Detroit Lions ] \nDolphins vs. Titans \nCampbell is a former TE, so Jordan Cameron owners can hope that the Dolphins’ new head coach has better ideas on how to wring some more production from that position. Cameron has seen his share of targets, averaging seven per game, but he’s turned them into just 12 catches for 170 yards and zero TDs. There’s still time for the athletic player to blossom into a TE1. \nPanthers vs. Seahawks \nIt’s probably too much to expect Carolina to run the ball well at Seattle, but the division of labor among its RBs could be interesting. Setting aside Cam Newton’s extensive usage in the ground game, Jonathan Stewart dominated the work in the first three games, but in the team’s most recent contest, rookie backup Cameron Artis-Payne got eight carries to Stewart’s 10. \nChargers vs. Packers \nAntonio Gates is now 19th among TEs in standard-league scoring, which is kind of amazing, considering he has played all of one game. That game, in which he emerged from a four-game suspension to snag nine catches for 92 yards and two TDs on the Steelers, did come against the second-most generous defense to TEs, so we’ll see if he can keep it up versus the Pack’s stingier unit. \n[ Trade talk: Make a sneaky deal for Sammy Watkins ] \nBengals vs. Bills \nJeremy Hill began last season as Giovani Bernard’s backup and then literally ran away with the starting job, so that could happen again, right? Well, sort of the opposite has happened this year, except that Hill is still starting games. But Bernard has been easily the more effective RB, averaging 5.5 yards per carry to Hill’s 3.0. If Bernard (one TD) starts getting work near the goal line, Hill’s value will really dry up. \nRavens vs. 49ers \nBaltimore placed Lorenzo Taliaferro on injured reserve with a foot injury, meaning that Javorius “Buck” Allen moves up to the backup RB spot. Allen may actually be more than that right away, as Justin Forsett is dealing with his own foot injury. Even if Forsett plays, it’s a reminder that Allen is worth consideration for a roster spot, especially given that Taliaferro was getting some usage in the red zone. \nPatriots vs. Colts \nAhmad Bradshaw is 29, which sounds ancient for an RB until you consider that Frank Gore is 32. Now Bradshaw is the young pup nipping at Gore’s heels, having been signed by the Colts this week after proving that the leg he broke last November is fully healed. Bradshaw was a useful player for Indy the past couple of seasons, averaging 4.7 yards per carry, and he might turn into a useful flex play in PPR leagues. \nGiants vs. Eagles \nIsn’t Philadelphia supposed to have a high-tempo offense? So far, Chip Kelly’s squad is 18th in plays run per game (64.0), meaning that there isn’t as big of a pie for DeMarco Murray and Ryan Mathews to share. While Murray is pretty much assured of a solid workload, Mathews owners are hoping his fine play (5.0 YPC) lets him carve out a respectable role, and it’s even possible he becomes the goal-line back.
