It’s also the second week in a row that the offense has struggled in many areas.\nAlex Smith turned in a better outing than his previous two starts, as he did show the ability to make some plays downfield. Jamaal Charles continues to perform at an extremely high level as he totaled 145 yards on the day. Jeremy Maclin picked up where he left off from last week’s second half performance, as he hauled in 11 catches for 148 yards.\nSmith’s 386 yard passing performance is the highest yardage total of his career. It turned out to be not enough in the end, as none of those yards resulted in a touchdown.\nCairo Santos was the only form of points all game, as the second year kicker produced a franchise record seven field goals, including two from over 50 yards.\nThe offensive line at times played better than last week, but also much worse. Inconsistent play was the story all game as Eric Fisher would set a nice block on an outside run for Charles, and then follow that up by allowing Geno Atkins to blow by and sack Smith. Zach Fulton and Ben Grubbs also were beat up front, and Donald Stephenson had a costly holding penalty.\nSmith showed a better ability to throw on the run than in previous performances, where multiple times he avoided pressure, flushed outside, and either completed a short pass or threw it out of bounds to avoid the sack.\nMaclin was the primary target in the passing game, and didn’t have much help. Albert Wilson was out with injury and rookie Chris Conley started his first game. The receiver out of Georgia promptly dropped a pass just a few yards outside of the goal line in the first quarter.\nTravis Kelce also turned in a rough game, as the tight end had a costly fumble on 3rd and 30 in Chiefs territory that lead to a Bengals touchdown.\nMistakes like that are what led to Kansas City’s demise. The offense showed signs of potential but couldn’t put it all together, especially on third down.\nThe Chiefs ranked last in third down efficiency going into the game, and didn’t do enough to dispose of that trend against the Bengals. They went 6 for 17 on 3rd downs Sunday, many of which came in the Cincinnati territory. If the Chiefs convert any one of their seven field goals to touchdowns early in the game, they might have had a chance at the end.\nThere were also some questionable mistakes that Andy Reid contributed to, including play-calling and time management. Reid’s red-zone decisions like sweeps to De’Anthony Thomas or screens to Charcandrick West, really costly the team.\nKansas City also had an inexcusable delay of game penalty that followed a timeout, extending a 3rd and 7 to a 3rd and 12. Then at the end of the first half Reid played it conservative running the ball in the final two minutes and taking all forty seconds of the play clock, leaving enough time for a field goal but not a touchdown.\nThat kind of strategy might work against lesser teams, but when facing contenders like Cincinnati, the Chiefs need to be more aggressive. It’ll have to start up front if they want to accomplish better production, as the offensive line needs to perform more consistently across the board.\nThe stars of the offense again showed signs of potential, but potential doesn’t win you games against top teams.\nIf the line plays better and they eliminate the mistakes, the Chiefs face a very winnable matchup in week five. Kansas City hosts Jay Cutler and the 1-3 Chicago Bears Sunday at noon.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
