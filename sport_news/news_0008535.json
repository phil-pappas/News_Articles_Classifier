Only Pizza Pit would do. \nWith his wife wanting the wings, Marcus Fizer got in the car about eight years ago. The drive from Chicago to Ames can be six hours, but it didn’t matter. \nThe former Iowa State basketball All-American was headed to Welch Avenue. \n“Caught a football game and just snuck out as best as we could,” Fizer said. \nIt will be harder for him to go undetected this week. Fizer returned to Ames on Wednesday for his induction into the Iowa State athletic hall of fame this weekend. \n“I know I’m going to be in tears,” Fizer said. \nFizer spent three years as a Cyclone, earning consensus All-American and Big 12 player of the year honors. He led the Cyclones to the Elite Eight as well as the Big 12 regular season and conference tournament championships in 2000. \nHe is fifth on ISU’s all-time scoring list with 1,830 points and was the No. 4 overall pick by the Chicago Bulls in the 2000 NBA draft. \n“It turned into something more magical than I could have imagined,” Fizer said. “It just continued to grow, and that’s the most memorable and proud part of being a Cyclone.” \nThis is his first trip back since that trip to Pizza Pit. The memories of his ISU days hit him as he approached campus on Wednesday. \n“We saw 16th Street and started coming around and I said, ‘I remember this when the guys were playing flag football,’” Fizer said. “Just to see Hilton Coliseum and see across the street to Larch Hall where it all began for me on the eighth floor. I can still see the little small window.” \nThe induction is Friday night. Fizer is getting inducted alongside women’s basketball player Stacy Frese, runner Jeff Myers, football/baseball player Tim Van Galder and wrestlers Dale Bahr and George Martin. \nAfter leaving ISU, Fizer played in four NBA seasons with Chicago, Milwaukee and New Orleans/Oklahoma City. He won’t say he’s retired, but he’s spending this year helping coach his son, Aamondae, and his high school basketball team in Las Vegas. \nFizer doesn’t tell many stories about his playing days at home. So this trip serves as a chance for his family to see what Fizer did in Hilton Coliseum. \n“It’s kind of like, ‘Dad, why you never told us?” Fizer said. “It’s not about me to tell. If there’s a story to be told then you guys will definitely put it out there to be told. I just try to help them get to the place I was able to get to and to be better than I was.” \nOdds are they’ll hear plenty of stories about their pops this weekend, possibly over some Pizza Pit wings. \n“You know I just gave an endorsement for Pizza Pit,” Fizer said. “You know we’ll be there.” Rules for posting comments \nComments posted below are from readers.
