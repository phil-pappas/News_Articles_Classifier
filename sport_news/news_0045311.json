Scotland's hopes were ended when Robert Lewandowski salvaged a 2-2 draw for Poland in Glasgow. \nOne hundred miles to the south in Belfast, Steven Davis scored twice for Northern Ireland to qualify for its first European Championship tournament with a 3-1 victory over Greece in Group F. \nJoao Moutinho struck for Portugal to beat Denmark 1-0 and secure its place by winning Group I. \nHere's a roundup of action from Thursday's Euro 2016 qualifying games: \nGROUP D \nShane Long's strike earned Ireland at least a playoff place with a famous 1-0 win over Germany. Ireland had never before beaten Germany in a competitive game. \nGermany had missed a host of chances through Jerome Boateng, Ilkay Gundogan and Mesut Ozil, with Ireland forced to chase the game for long periods before Long struck in the 70th minute. \nThomas Mueller missed the chance to equalize eight minutes later - a draw would have been enough for Germany - when he fired wide with the goal at his mercy. \n\"It's bitter for me and worse for the team,\" Mueller said. \nWith one game in qualifying remaining, Germany tops Group D on 19 points, one ahead of Poland and Ireland, which meet in Warsaw on Sunday. \nPoland captain Lewandowski's second goal deep in injury time ended Scotland's hopes of a playoff. \nBecause of its superior goal difference, a draw on Sunday would be enough for Poland to qualify directly, while Ireland needs to win to avoid the playoffs. \nGermany hosts already eliminated Georgia in Leipzig on Sunday, when a draw would be enough. \nEarlier Thursday, Georgia defeated Gibraltar 4-0 in Tbilisi. \nGROUP I \nCristiano Ronaldo's Portugal will be playing at Euro 2016 after beating Denmark 1-0, and Albania could still make it after a tense but violence-free 2-0 defeat against Serbia. \nThe match in Elbasan, central Albania, was watched over by more than 2,000 police, with extensive security checks and snipers on rooftops. A match last year between the countries was interrupted by violence after a drone carrying a nationalist Albanian banner hovered over the pitch. \nIn the end, Thursday's drama came on the pitch as Serbia captured a late win with injury time goals from Aleksandar Kolarov and Adem Ljajic. \nPortugal ensured the group's top spot thanks to Joao Moutinho's 66th-minute strike in northern Portugal. \nDenmark stayed second on 12 points, six behind Portugal, and could still advance, though the Albanians on 11 points have one game left to play while the Danes have completed their eight group matches. \nGROUP F \nTwo goals from captain Steven Davis and another from Josh Magennis guaranteed Northern Ireland a place in France in June with victory over Greece. \n\"It's a dream come true. We really wanted to get it done tonight and there is no better place than to do it in front of your home fans,\" Davis said. \"It's a huge achievement for the squad and the entire nation. \nDavis opened the scoring from close range in the 35th minute, with Magennis doubling the hosts' lead shortly after the interval. \nDavis added a third in the 58th when he sent a header into the far corner following a corner to send Windsor Park into raptures. Hristos Aravidis netted a consolation for Greece with four minutes remaining. \nThe win moves Northern Ireland onto 20 points, three ahead of second-placed Romania following its 1-1 draw against Finland in Bucharest. \nHungary came from behind to beat the Faroe Islands 2-1 in Budapest courtesy of two second-half goals from substitute Daniel Bode. \nThat win secures at least a third-placed finish for the Hungarians, now on 16 points, one adrift of Romania. \nAssociated Press writers Barry Hatton contributed from Lisbon, David Gerges from London. \nThis story has been corrected to show that Belfast is south of Glasgow, not north. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:32:47.575+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
