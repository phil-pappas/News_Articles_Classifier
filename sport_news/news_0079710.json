The Bills (3-4) were playing in the British capital for the first time. \nEJ Manuel started at quarterback for the Bills for the second straight game in the absence of the injured Tyrod Taylor. \nManuel's early struggles allowed Jacksonville to take a big lead, but Manuel led the rally until the Jaguars took the lead for good in the final minutes. \nPhotos by The Associated Press Matthew Fairburn's observations \nEJ Manuel, the quarterback the Bills felt strongly enough about to trade away backup quarterback Matt Cassel just over a month ago, had the worst quarter any quarterback has had this season. ... Needless to say, the Bills could use Tyrod Taylor back after the bye week. \nMore from Matthew Fairburn MVP: Allen Hurns \nBlake Bortles deserves credit for leading the touchdown drive that won the Jaguars the game, but wide receiver Allen Hurns made an outstanding play on the diving grab. In a game that was filled with mistakes and sloppy play, no single player had a banner performance. Hurns made the critical play and gets the game ball by default. Biggest disappointment: EJ Manuel \nEJ Manuel turned the ball over like a mad man in the first half. He may have finished with 298 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions, but all three of his first-half turnovers led to touchdowns. Two of them were directly returned for touchdowns. The Bills almost overcame it, but Manuel dug too much of a hole. Thought the @jaguars were done? This Bortles/Hurns TD would like a word with you.
