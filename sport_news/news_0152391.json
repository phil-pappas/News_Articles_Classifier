Pic/Suresh KK \n\nWhile the Punjab team arrived for their pre-match training rituals for their Ranji Trophy match against Mumbai, their skipper made his way to the Wankhede Stadium turf just when his teammates were about to wrap up their session.\nAlso Read:  Ranji Trophy: Mumbai hope to improve their record at Wankhede \nYuvraj stretched a bit before taking a few throw downs. That was his preparation before taking on the 40-time Ranji champions. \"I just want to play and enjoy my cricket. If I get an opportunity to come back and play for India, I will look forward to that. \n\nThese are games (domestic cricket) which will give me an opportunity to come back. I am trying my best. I had six weeks of good off season training, so hopefully it comes through in the games,\" said Yuvraj on match eve yesterday.\n\nIt was none other than legendary Sachin Tendulkar, who reminded Yuvraj not to ignore the basic factor of enjoying the game in his pursuit to wear India colours again.\n\nSachin Tendulkar's advice \n\"I was speaking to Sachin last year and he said, obviously the most important thing is to play for India, but don't forget to enjoy the game. As kids, we always played the game to enjoy it. We did not know we were going to play for India. So, as long as I am enjoying it, I want to play,\" said the Player of the tournament for the 2011 World Cup.\n\nDid he decide to quit at any moment? \"You have your moments in life where games are disappointing and things don't go your way, but as I said, what do you play cricket for? You play your cricket to enjoy,\" he stressed.\n\nThe Wankhede Stadium, where Yuvraj played a crucial role in helping India win the 2011 World Cup, could be the perfect stage for him to relaunch his career. \"I have great memories of 2011 World Cup. I don't know what will happen tomorrow, but as long as I am positive and prepared to do well, I will get results in one of the games,\" said Yuvraj, who hopes to make the cut for next year's World T20.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:41:25.816+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
