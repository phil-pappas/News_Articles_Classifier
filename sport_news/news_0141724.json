Fryar's mom, Allene McGee, was sentenced to three years probation for the role she played in the same scam. \nThe 53-year-old was originally indicted on the charges in October 2013 . \nThe scam involved a situation where Fryar and his mom would apply for multiple mortgage loans in a small period of time and then use the same property as collateral. The loan applications also included false information that said Fryar's mom was making thousands of dollars that she wasn't actually making as an event coordinator at Fryar's church. \nAccording to the Associated Press , the Fryar and his mom barely made any payments on their four loans and each loan was eventually written off as a loss by the bank that made it. \nThe state of New Jersey alleges that Fryar and his mom defrauded the banks out \"hundreds of thousands of dollars.\"\n\"The fact that Fryar had the means to succeed and do good things and instead chose this criminal path makes his actions all the more reprehensible,\" New Jersey Attorney General John Hoffman said in a statement Friday.\nAfter being drafted No. 1 overall by the Patriots, Fryar spent nine seasons in New England before moving on to Miami (1993-95), Philadelphia (1996-98) and Washington (1999-2000). The five-time Pro Bowler finished his career with 12,785 receiving yards. \n\nIrving Fryar will be spending the next five years in prison.
