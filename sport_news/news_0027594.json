One final spot was available to play for last year’s district champs and it went to senior Jordan Ray, who is also finishing up her swim season. \n“Good athlete, great attitude, the works,” said seventh-year Leon coach Tony Kidd. “She earned a spot by continuing to improve throughout the tryouts and catching everyone's attention.” Buy Photo \nLeon coach Tony Kidd was the 2014 All-Big Bend Coach of the Year last year.

Ray stood out the most and the coaches took notice. She got the last spot. \nAs Kidd bagged up equipment, everyone else gone, Ray approached the coaches. She offered her roster spot to the senior let go because she already had a primary sport, but the other girl’s dream was to play soccer for Leon. \nKidd had Ray tell her classmate she was on the team. As a show of support for Ray, the soccer team swarmed Leon’s swim meet against Lincoln last week. \n“You don't often see teenage kids perform such a selfless act,” Kidd said, “and this one will not be forgotten.” Buy Photo \nLeon’s Lily Henkel (20) and Lincoln’s Catherine Pratt (5) race after the ball during a 2014 game.

He’s also parenting seven children, two which he adopted. \nOn the field, the Jaguars have a talented team according to Stephens, but he wants them to grasp a different concept than just winning. \n“East and West Gadsden are bitter rivals,” Stephens said. “I happened to hear that they were needing soccer goals, but did not have the money.” \nSoccer goals cost approximately $2,500 a pair, not exactly an easy cost for a school in one of the lowest financial districts in the state. \nSo Stephens has his Jaguars helping raise the money for the Panthers through and alumni game this coming Saturday at 2:30 p.m. and 4 at Mt. Pleasant Field. The players and their families are also kicking in to help make up for the lack of business donors in Gadsden County. \n“I wanted my boys to have a bigger perspective than just rivalry,” Stephens said. “I wanted them to understand about what it is to give and help.” \nSoccer goals can cost $2,500 per pair, not an easy cost for an athletics department to absorb. East Gadsden is fundraising for rival West Gadsden so it can have goals.
