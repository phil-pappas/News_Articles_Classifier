One was a 2-yard plunge last week at Boston College by RB Joel Bouagnon, whose six rushing TDs is tied for 11th nationally.\nGetting defensive: Chippewas QB Cooper Rush is 12th nationally with 317 passing yards per game. The Huskies have eight interceptions, four by CB Shawun Lurry.\nThe number: 50. Previous meetings in a series that dates to 1939, the most for the Huskies against an FBS team. Central Michigan leads 26-23-1.\nThe talk: After close losses to No. 1 Ohio State and Boston College, the Huskies need to reignite a sluggish offense to avoid their first three-game losing streak since 2009.\nJack McCarthy's pick: The Huskies will get revenge for last year's loss that snapped a 28-game home winning streak.
