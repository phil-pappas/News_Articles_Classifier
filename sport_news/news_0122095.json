They replaced the roof, repaired the windows and installed new heating, plumbing and electrical systems. Then they hired artisans to painstakingly replace the arms and legs of plaster cherubs in the formal rooms. They even took paint samples to replicate the color Mr. Codman had used in the dining room—a pale green called Eau De Nile. Now, the house is back on the market for $7.9 million—more than five times what they paid for it six years ago.\nRelated Reading\nThe Mansion Bedroom Boom How a New York DJ Revived an English Manor Wine-Tasting Rooms Move Out of the Cellar Once the summer retreat of wealthy Gilded Age industrialists, Newport saw its fortunes decline after World War II. The seaport’s sprawling, Victorian-era manses had become impractical and hopelessly out of style by the 1950s and 1960s. Many were converted to schools or condos, while others were neglected, razed or simply abandoned.\nThen, the preservationists arrived. They were followed by history-loving house hunters in search of bargains and happy to painstakingly restore old homes. Now, vacationing billionaires are buying here—and Newport prices reflect the shift.\nIn 2006, retired Goldman Sachs GS 1.55 % partner David B. Ford bought the roughly 30,000-square-foot neoclassical mansion Miramar for $17.2 million. Oracle ORCL 1.96 % ’s Larry Ellison purchased the Astor family’s Beechwood for $10.5 million in 2010, and has since paid nearly $10 million for two adjacent properties. Currently on the market for $19 million is a nearly 16,000-square-foot spread at Seafair, a crescent-shaped oceanfront house on almost 9 acres. Built in the 1930s, the Louis XVI-style mansion was at one point divided into about five condo units, but most have now been recombined into one eight-bedroom home.\nThis summer saw the $15 million sale of Fairholme, a 15-bedroom, Tudor Revival home built in the 1870s on Newport’s popular oceanfront path, the Cliff Walk.\nStill, Newport’s prices remain a relative bargain compared with vacation spots like Nantucket and New York’s Hamptons, according to Melanie Delman of the Lila Delman Real Estate International, the listing agent for Seafair and Fairholme. She estimates that Fairholme, which measures roughly 24,000 square feet and includes a ballroom, would have listed for over $50 million in the Hamptons . Among those making an offer on the home was a Taiwanese buyer—one of a number of international house hunters now shopping in Newport, she said.\nAlso listed is the Orchard, a 16-bedroom estate built in the 1870s. Modeled after a French château, the property was last sold in 1993 to Gloria Nagy and Richard Saul Wurman, 80, who paid $2.2 million for the property and renovated it. The asking price is now $8.5 million, down from $11 million.\n“There’s a lot of new money, new energy, new blood coming in here,” said Ms. Nagy.\nIt is a stark reversal of fortune for the seaside town. “When I was a kid, most people thought Victorian houses were old and ugly,” recalled Pieter Roos, executive director of the Newport Restoration Foundation, a nonprofit group founded by heiress Doris Duke in 1968. Newport homes “that are so beautifully maintained now—many were abandoned properties” in the 1950s and 1960s, he added.\n“You could buy these houses for overdue taxes,” said James Moore, president of Newport’s Bellevue Ochre Point Neighborhood Association.\nInside the Restored Mansions of Newport, R.I.

Julie Bidwell for The Wall Street Journal … of SHOW CAPTION HIDE CAPTION fullscreen In the 1960s, the Preservation Society of Newport County began buying Gilded Age mansions and opening to them to the public as museums. The society now owns about 10 historic houses in Newport, including the Breakers, the 70-room former Vanderbilt family summer home . Ms. Duke’s oceanfront estate, Rough Point, is now a museum owned by the Newport Restoration Foundation.\nThe current wave of mansion restoration has been driven by wealthy second-home buyers from large cities like New York or Boston. “The new technology economy and Wall Street money has flowed into these great historic summer home locations,” Mr. Moore said. “Newport has had the benefit of that.”\nMr. Ellison is one of the most high-profile examples. He declined to comment for this article, but plans filed with the city indicate that he is restoring the main mansion as a museum for his 19th-century art collection; another house on the roughly 9-acre parcel will serve as a part-time residence.\nIn 2012 Carolyn Rafaelian, 49, founder of the jewelry and lifestyle brand Alex and Ani, paid about $4 million for Belcourt, a roughly 44,000-square-foot house built in the 1890s. Ms. Rafaelian, a Rhode Island native, said she often visited Newport’s house museums growing up. “My childhood dream was to own one of these mansions,” she said.\nBelcourt has a Gothic-style ballroom with massive stained glass windows and a balcony for musicians. Ms. Rafaelian bought the house, which was in disrepair, after going on a “ghost tour” being held there. “I became fascinated by the house, and a little heartbroken because I realized it needed so much attention,” she said.\nHer first priority after buying Belcourt was to stabilize the structure, which had been badly damaged by moisture. Since then she has focused on restoring the house to the way it appeared in its Gilded Age heyday.\nThe restoration will likely be completed in the next two years, said Ms. Rafaelian, who is considering using the mansion as a gallery, a museum or other event space. “I don’t think I want to know” how much the total cost will be, she laughed.\nRestorations of these large, ornate houses can be both costly and time consuming.\nIn 2006, Alice Ross and her husband, James, paid for $3.025 million for the seven-bedroom Berkeley House, an 1880s redbrick home designed by McKim, Mead & White. They then spent two years restoring it to its original appearance.\nMs. Ross, a 54-year-old interior designer, said the restoration involved recreating a widow’s walk perched atop the house that had been destroyed in a hurricane. She and her husband, a 62-year-old real-estate investor, also had white paint removed from the elaborate woodwork in the home’s foyer, dining room and staircase, a project that was “very labor intensive,” Ms. Ross said. “At one point we had 32 people in our foyer, and some of them were using dental equipment to get it out.”\nMs. Ross she couldn’t give an estimate of how much the restoration cost. Now that it’s done, “I get to step into my own little Edith Wharton novel,” Ms. Ross said.\nRonald Lee Fleming, 74, an urban planner and designer who lives primarily in Cambridge, Mass., bought 12-bedroom Bellevue House in 1999, both as a summer home for his family and to prevent the 1910 structure from being turned into a boutique hotel.\nThe white-clapboard, Federal revival-style house had “a lot of deferred maintenance,” he said, recalling that the glass at the top of a 44-foot-high rotunda had been cracked by seagulls dropping shells, and delicate plasterwork had fallen to the floor. Since finishing the house, he has turned his attention to the gardens, restoring an art deco fountain and adding pools, pergolas and an orchard, among other things.

An Ocean Avenue home built in 2008 is listed at $45 million, the state’s highest-ever asking price, according to co-listing agent Kate Kirby Greenman of Gustave White Sotheby’s International Realty. On a rolling green lawn overlooking the ocean, the roughly 45-acre estate includes a six-bedroom house with an infinity pool and pizza oven, a roughly 3,500-square-foot guesthouse and a private boat mooring.\n“It’s really a second Gilded Age,” said Mr. Moore, of the neighborhood association. “An enormous amount of money has been invested in our city and in our neighborhood.”", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV162_1022NE_M_20151019171055.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV174_1022NE_H_20151019171130.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV180_1022NE_H_20151019171147.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV200_1024NE_H_20151019175325.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV170_1022NE_M_20151019171113.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV165_1022NE_M_20151019171055.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV181_1022NE_M_20151019171148.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV165_1022NE_H_20151019171055.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV166_1022NE_H_20151019171055.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV169_1022NE_M_20151019171112.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV174_1022NE_M_20151019171130.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV164_1022NE_H_20151019171055.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV172_1022NE_H_20151019171113.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV164_1022NE_M_20151019171055.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV163_1022NE_M_20151019171055.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV169_1022NE_H_20151019171112.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV171_1022NE_H_20151019171113.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV179_1022NE_M_20151019171131.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV172_1022NE_M_20151019171113.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV187_1023NE_M_20151019172041.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV166_1022NE_M_20151019171055.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV163_1022NE_H_20151019171055.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV175_1022NE_M_20151019171133.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV173_1022NE_M_20151019171112.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV200_1024NE_M_20151019175325.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV177_1022NE_M_20151019171129.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV170_1022NE_H_20151019171113.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV179_1022NE_H_20151019171131.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV176_1022NE_M_20151019171130.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV168_1022NE_M_20151019171112.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV161_1022NE_M_20151019171055.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV177_1022NE_H_20151019171129.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV180_1022NE_M_20151019171147.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV173_1022NE_H_20151019171112.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV175_1022NE_H_20151019171133.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV187_1023NE_H_20151019172041.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV171_1022NE_M_20151019171113.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV176_1022NE_H_20151019171130.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV181_1022NE_H_20151019171148.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV161_1022NE_H_20151019171055.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KV162_1022NE_H_20151019171055.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T17:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:04:44.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
