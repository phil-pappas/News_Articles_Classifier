With Marcus Smart (illness) not making the first part of this two-game New York swing, and Avery Bradley being held out for rest, Turner is expected to start in the backcourt with Isaiah Thomas .\nIf that sounds like an unlikely backcourt combination to you, you’re not alone.\n“Really? Wow, that’s fun,” Turner said. “We played a little bit together last year, a lot of pretty close games together.”\nThe key now is getting into game shape.\n“I felt pretty good. The biggest thing was to get into a rhythm and get my conditioning right,” he said. “I strained it, but it feels better. I’m anxious to play for sure — not overly anxious, excited really. I have to get a little better at my conditioning, but other than that, it felt good.”\nThere’s one aspect of Turner’s game Brad Stevens doesn’t have any desire to change — the part that puts the ball in Turner’s hands as much as possible.\n“When the clock is running down and we need a shot, I know who I want out there,” the Celtics coach said.\nMixing it up\nThe combinations taking form in Stevens’ mind aren’t necessarily as tangible to the players in the preseason rotation.\nTonight’s exhibition game against the Nets, the Celtics’ first real NBA opposition so far, will further define these combos. But Smart believes he’s starting to develop a good idea of where this is going.\n“I definitely can tell that the groups are coming together,” the point guard said. “I don’t know any of the rotations, none of us do. But the groups are coming along very well. We’re putting anyone with anyone right now. That’s a good feeling to have with a lot of guys on this team.”\nOn the move\nAsked to name one outstanding trait this early in training camp, Thomas singled out the Celtics’ ability to find open shooters.\n“Our ball movement,” Thomas said. “The teams I’ve been with, when preseason starts, they’re like, ‘Man, we have to move the ball a lot better.’ On this team, that hasn’t even been a question. Instead it’s more, ‘You guys pass a little too much, you guys are passing up some good shots to be a little too unselfish.’\n“I guess that’s a good problem to have. That stood out to me when we watched film, how good we move the ball, and we haven’t been together that long. That’s a good sign. Guys are just playing for each other, trying to make the game easier for each other.”\nHe needs his space\nOne primary goal this month is to find the right shooters who can space the floor for Thomas. The process is ongoing, but the Celtics have several good options among their big men, including facilitators David Lee and Kelly Olynyk .\n“Coach talked to me about it — that he would like at least one shooting big with me to space the floor, give me more room to work,” Thomas said. “Honestly, whatever he wants, I have to figure out how to do it at a high level. With that scenario, it’s just spacing the floor. I just have to go out there and make plays, not only for myself but for my teammates.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:54:58.338+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
