(Photo: Mickey Welsh/Montgomery Advertiser) \nNick Saban felt the need to come to Shaun Hamilton's defense. \nThe Montgomery native was called for targeting in the first half of Alabama's 41-23 win Saturday at Texas A&M, but Saban said Hamilton didn't intentionally target Sam Moeller helmet-to-helmet on a punt return. \n\"All you can do is learn from it,\" Saban said Monday. \"It was not intentional. He's not that kind of person. The guy has played well for us on special teams and he's played well for us when he's had to play. He's a good person.\" Alabama coach Nick Saban and senior linebacker Reggie Ragland talk about Montgomery native Shaun Hamilton's target penalty in last week's win at Texas A&M. Duane Rankin/Montgomery Advertiser \nOn Cyrus Jones' return, Hamilton leaped into the air and launched himself into Moeller at nearly the exact same time freshman defensive back Shawn Burgess-Becker nailed the A&M player, but Hamilton, a sophomore linebacker, was the only one ejected. \n\"You've got to see what you hit,\" Saban said. \"I don't think he intentionally hit the guy helmet-to-helmet. He was playing with toughness and he was being aggressive, but I think especially an unprotected player in a situation like that? What we tell the players is you've got to see what you hit and you have to lower your target.\" \nAlabama senior linebacker Reggie Ragland began his answer to the question of what did he said to Hamilton after the play by saying, \"man, come on.\" He later defended the former G.W. Carver High star, too. \n\"It happens,\" Ragland said. \"He wasn't trying to do it intentionally.\" \nHamilton sat out the second half at A&M, but is eligible to play the entire game Saturday against Tennessee. If a player is ejected in the second half, he must sit the first half of the next game.
