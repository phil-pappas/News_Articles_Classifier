(AP) -- Prosecutors say former Michigan State University basketball star and television analyst Mateen Cleaves is the subject of a sexual assault investigation but has not been charged.\nWayne County prosecutor's office spokesman Maria Miller told The Flint Journal Friday (http://bit.ly/1R2ovpc ) that the investigation was transferred to Detroit from Genesee County.\nGenesee County Prosecutor David Leyton says he decided not to investigate because his ''family has a relationship with a witness.''\nDetails of the case were not released Friday.\nCleaves' attorney Frank J. Manley says his client is aware of the complaint. ''We would ask that people reserve judgment until all the facts come to light,'' Manley told The Associated Press.\nCleaves attended Flint Northern High School, led Michigan State to the NCAA championship in 2000 and played in the NBA.\nSociety & Culture Crime & Justice Michigan State University Maria Miller   29826/73864  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T09:27:15.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
