Vaughn knocked away the 2-point conversion pass, and Marianna Lee led 14-0.The Trojans made it 20-0 with 3:43 to go on a 2-yard run, but Vaughn intercepted the 2-point conversion pass attempt.Nick Gray recovered a fumble that set up the Red Devils’ first touchdown in the second quarter. Devon Dollar later hauled in Seth Haney’s 10-yard scoring strike, and Atkins trailed 20-6 with 7:35 left in the first half after the failed PAT.Marianna Lee looked to score again, but was stopped inside the 1-yard line on third and fourth down, and the Red Devils took over on downs. The Trojans got the ball back, but Atkins stopped Marianna Lee again.Seth Haney connected with Devin Dollar on a first-down pass to the 4-yard line. Brandon Haney didn’t get in on his first try, but he scored from 2 yards out by going over the line for the touchdown.Atkins went to the “swinging gate” 2-point conversion formation, then Gray snapped the ball to Dollar, who went across the goal line and cut the Red Devils deficit to 20-14 with less than a minute left in the first half.Dollar opened the third quarter by returning the kickoff 55 yards near the Trojans 35-yard line. Haney crossed the goal line from 2-yards out with 9:43 to go, then Dollar took the shovel pass and got the 2-point conversion and gave the Red Devils their first lead, 22-20.Weems escaped from the Atkins defense to give Marianna Lee a 26-22 lead. Arnold scored his fourth touchdown with 1:49 to go in the third quarter, and the Trojans led 32-22 after the 2-point try was no good.The Red Devils took over on downs again with 10:57 to go in the fourth quarter, but their next pass was intercepted by Weems to give Marianna Lee the ball again.Tarrike Turner scored on a 28-yard touchdown run, then Arnold’s 2-point conversion run gave the Trojans a 38-22 lead with 10 minutes remaining.Marianna intercepted another Atkins pass and added a 2-point conversion for a 48-22 lead with under nine minutes to go in the fourth quarter. Weems threw a long touchdown pass at the 5:22 mark to give the Trojans a 54-22 margin.But the Red Devils never give up, and they proved it on the ensuing kickoff. Gray caught the ball and outran the Marianna Lee defenders to the end zone for the touchdown. Pestel hit the PAT to make the score 54-29.Atkins will host Bald Knob next week.
