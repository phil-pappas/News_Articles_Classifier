Sorry to anyone who spent $ coming to this circus.”\nUSA TODAY\nKevin Harvick's faltering car brings accusations over Talladega finish\nHarvick made the cut for Round 3 after the field was frozen under caution and he had enough points to advance. Hamlin and Joe Gibbs Racing teammate Matt Kenseth, who were among those caught up in the crash, did not and claimed Harvick turned Trevor Bayne on purpose.\n“He clipped him and caused a wreck because he knew he’d make the Chase that way,” Kenseth said.\nUSA TODAY\nDale Earnhardt Jr. 'totally OK' with G-W-C finish at Talladega\n“That’s a crappy way for Harvick to have to get in the Chase, is to wreck somebody -- what I believe to be on purpose,” Bayne said.\nIf that’s the case, then NASCAR could have another Richmond 2013 on its hands. In that race, Clint Bowyer intentionally caused a caution to help get a teammate into the Chase – but NASCAR ended up changing the results after the evidence came to light the following week.\nThis time, the sanctioning body did not find any wrongdoing, as NASCAR vice chairman Mike Helton said officials reviewed the video and saw “no evidence right now that there’s anything (Harvick) did that was questionable.”\n“We don’t see anything there that is suspect so far,” Helton said.\nThe “so far,” he added, was because he’s been around long enough to know “something could crawl out of the woodwork in the next 24 hours.”\nUSA TODAY\nTalladega's controversial finish leaves drivers eliminated and outraged\nBut Harvick crew chief Rodney Childers said the explanation was simple: The No. 4 car’s engine was blowing up, and his driver was attempting to move up when he hit Bayne and caused the wreck.\n“He’s trying to get out of the way but not lose too many spots,” Childers said. “We’re not the ones who invented this (stuff).”\nHarvick had said before the restart he thought his motor was blowing up and also complained of a broken exhaust pipe earlier in the race. He said he didn’t know “if I clipped the 6 or if he came across as I was coming up.”\nRegardless of intent, the result left Logano as the winner when it seemed Earnhardt would make an unlikely comeback from a late-race penalty in a must-win situation for the 41-year-old, still seeking his first Cup title.\nUSA TODAY\nDale Earnhardt Jr., Denny Hamlin, Matt Kenseth, Ryan Newman eliminated at Talladega\nBut the caution came out just moments after the restart, and suddenly the race was over under NASCAR’s revised overtime rule – which made its debut Sunday.\nPreviously, NASCAR had allowed for three “green-white-checkered” overtime attempts in order to give fans a better chance at a real finish. But after a series of nasty wrecks at restrictor-plate races lately, capped by Austin Dillon’s flip into the catchfence at the end of the July race at Daytona International Speedway - in which Dillon and five fans suffered minor injuries - the rule was amended for Talladega only.\n“Everybody is going to ask me 100 times how I feel about the green-white-checkered rule now,” Earnhardt Jr. said. “I feel good about it. It was a good, safe call. The race ended per the rules and I’m totally OK with that.”\nUSA TODAY\nNASCAR could be at crossroads on 'GWC' rule for plate races\nWould another attempt at a G-W-C finish left Earnhardt Jr. the winner? We’ll never know for sure, but he and his fans certainly will say yes.\nAdding to the confusion in the closing laps: On the first attempt to start overtime, a spin in the middle of the pack forced NASCAR to wave off the start – which hadn’t happened anytime in recent memory.\nOfficials ruled the restart did not count, and then reset the field for another G-W-C.\nThen came the crash that left some fans outraged, some crying foul and most upset about a race that turned memorable for all the wrong reasons.\nFollow Gluck on Twitter @jeff_gluck", "external_links": ["http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/index.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash", "http://imgur.com/7C8gxny.png", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/10/25/talladega-campingworld-500-matt-kenseth-denny-hamlin-ryan-newman-dale-earnhardt-jr-kevin-harvick-joey-logano-chase-sprint-cup/74603996/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/10/25/kevin-harvick-controversial-final-restart-talladega-chase-sprint-cup/74602968/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/10/25/dale-earnhardt-jr-eliminated-talladega-finish-chase-for-sprint-cup/74604504/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e6ba3ba23c4565cfcb599b059c9795656b25f08a/c=0-292-2156-2448/local/-/media/2015/10/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635813930808489271-logano-victory.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6117d99c702fa01c7f37808e619bd4f9d9a4d29a/c=0-277-4926-3060&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/10/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814029308600963-GTY-494241994-77031510-1-.JPG", "http://twitter.com/jeff_gluck", "http://c.brightcove.com/services/viewer/federated_f9?isVid=1&isUI=1", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/10/23/talladega-nascar-gwc-rule-change-drivers-fans-chase/74483716/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/463098d90dd8fe3589ec3720c4f7d82871e49636/c=228-197-1488-1457/local/-/media/2015/10/23/USATODAY/USATODAY/635812193887566095-USP-NASCAR--Geico-500.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1ecdedf4be3b08504f81c4dba2d060e3f0b6a1e2/c=0-0-2700-2700/local/-/media/2015/10/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635813997488932707-GTY-494241818.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6059b2f814d03be5e15d2edcd94c75f2c5d67590/c=0-178-3342-3520/local/-/media/2015/10/25/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814024758843513-USATSI-8881486.jpg", "http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,47,0", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/10/25/joey-logano-wins-talladega-chase-sprint-cup-race/74595168/"], "published": "2015-10-26T04:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T13:23:54.120+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
