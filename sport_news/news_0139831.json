Speaking on ‘Political environment in the state, country and our role’ on the concluding day of the two-day training camp for workers, he accused the Congress government of making false promises and fooling people to win the elections and backtracking on all poll promises. Asking the government to name a single work done for the welfare of people, Dhumal said the government had betrayed the unemployed youth and instead of providing employment allowance, it was following wrong policies. The previous BJP government had given financial benefits of 4-9-14 (increments after 4,9 and 14 years of service) from 2006 but the present government had failed to give the benefit even from 2012 and was following the policy of ‘transfer and revenge’ against its political opponents. “About 10.37 lakh schoolchildren were given free uniform only once in the past three years. They should have been provided uniform six times,” he said. Accusing the police of registering false cases against the BJP workers and overlooking illegal acts of Congress workers, Dhumal said the police did not do anything when the Congress workers burnt the effigy of Narendra Modi. “But when the BJP workers burn the effigy of the Chief Minister, they are booked in false cases,” he said. “The BJP workers will prepare a list of officers targeting the BJP workers and sparing the erring Congress workers,” Dhumal said, adding that the Chief Minister had no faith in his ministers and the police. “The administration and the ministers are busy getting a clean chit for the Chief Minister in corruption cases while the development works have come to a halt,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:04:48.728+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
