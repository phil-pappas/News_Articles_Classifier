I will be moving to World Superbikes next year with Honda and the Ten Kate team,\" a teary-eyed Hayden told a press conference. \"That's about all there is to it, not a lot more and nothing too dramatic.\"\nHayden said his bike performance has not been what he wanted it to be during the past two seasons, when he finished 16th in 2014 and ninth in 2013 on a Ducati.\n\"I've always thought superbikes might be something I want to try. I have liked the racing there. The opportunity felt like a good fit,\" he said.\n\"I'm obviously getting a bit older but I still enjoy the sport and the game. It'll be a fresh challenge and a new opportunity to go there and have some good more fun.\"\nHayden won just three grands prix in MotoGP -- all in 2005-06 -- but he famously took the world title that season after fighting tooth-and-nail with Valentino Rossi's Yamaha.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T21:03:29.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
