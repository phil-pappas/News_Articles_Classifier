It urges businesses to fire any female employees, and says that working outside of the home is a \"punishable offense\" according to Shariah, or Islamic law. It does not elaborate what would constitute appropriate punishment.\nThe letter is signed by the group Ansarullah Bangla Team, which is allegedly linked with several other groups that claimed responsibility for killing four atheist bloggers this year.\nIt threatens to kill more atheist bloggers, naming six in Bangladesh and nine others living abroad to be targeted as soon as they returned to the South Asian country. It said the list of 15 names is not final, warning that anyone who attempts to degrade Islam would face serious consequences and anyone supporting the atheist bloggers will not \"be spared.\"\nAuthorities said they are taking the threat seriously and are investigating. \"Higher authorities have been informed,\" Dhaka police spokesman Muntasirul Islam told reporters.\nThe email, received Monday by many Bangladeshi media outlets but not the AP, has renewed concerns about radical forces within Bangladesh.\nSince late September, two foreigners — an Italian aid worker and a Japanese agricultural worker — have been gunned down in daylight attacks. Responsibility for both attacks was claimed by the Sunni radical group ISIS, but the Bangladesh government rejected those claims along with any suggestion that ISIS was active in the country.\nThe email was signed with the name Abdullah bin Salim, who said he is an Ansarullah spokesman. Authorities determined it had been sent from a computer in the southeastern district of Chittagong, according to local media that received the email including online news service bdnews24.com and the Dhaka Tribune newspaper. Ansarullah also allegedly has ties with al-Qaida's branch in South Asia, launched last year in India.\n\"Our directives will be the law for you from today,\" the email says, according to Bangladeshi news service bdnews24.com. \"The consequences will be severe if you do not walk the path of Islam. Towering buildings will crumble to the ground, your heads will roll at the feet of the soldiers of Islam.\"\nIt warns the media, \"If your freedom of expression breaks the limit we have set, every news media unit should be prepared to face (the consequences) of our freedom to vent our anger,\" according to bdnews24.com.\nIt also says anyone working for a media organization that publishes reports condemning the \"jihadis\" for attacks \"will be considered to be abettors of atheists and atheism, and they would be fully uprooted.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:23:03.335+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
