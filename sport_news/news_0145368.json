That's when Gould came on and drilled the game-winning 49-yard field goal. \nChicago got off to a 6-0 lead on a TD pass from Cutler to Eddie Royal. From there, Oakland answered back with two touchdowns for a 14-6 lead. Another Cutler TD to Martellus Bennett cut that lead, down to 14-13. \nThe two teams then traded two field goals apiece, after that, with the last Sebastian Janikowski field goal, giving the Raiders a 20-19 lead, with two minutes left. That set the stage, for the Bears game-winning drive. \nCutler finished the game with 281 yards passing, two touchdowns, and one interception. \nCopyright 2015, WFIE.
