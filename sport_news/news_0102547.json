GRAVESAP Sports Writer \nAn independent Louisville affiliate has hired a law firm to review an escort's allegations that former men's basketball staffer Andre McGee hired dancers to strip and have sex with recruits and players. \nThe University of Louisville Foundation announced the hiring Thursday of the Stites & Harbison law firm. The foundation does fundraising for the university. \nLouisville President James Ramsey also said Thursday he \"fully\" supports athletic director Tom Jurich \"as we work to identify the facts in this situation.\" Ramsey reiterated the school has hired former NCAA enforcement official Chuck Smrt to lead the athletic department's investigation. \nMen's basketball spokesman Kenny Klein had no comment on a CBS Sports report that former Cardinals recruit JaQuan Lyle, now an Ohio State freshman, confirmed the \"gist of allegations\" detailed in Katina Powell's book during a meeting Tuesday with the NCAA.
