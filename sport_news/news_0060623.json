The loser of that game will face the 1995 and 2007 champions. \nThe Boks were challenged by the USA in the opening exchanges, but dominance at the set piece - which led to a penalty try during one period of attack - gave the South Africans a 14-0 lead at the break from which they built a stunning victory. \nIt was Damian de Allende who got the scoring under way for the Boks at the Olympic Stadium. South Africa set up the driving maul from a poor clearance kick from the Americans before they attacked blind. They knocked on, but the referee was playing advantage for an infringement at the maul. \nFourie du Preez took it quickly and offloaded. Schalk Burger guided it wide, and it was picked up by De Allende, who ghosted through the midfield for the opening try. \nUSA had an attempt at goal from far range to reduce the deficit, but Kruger's kick was short and Du Preez cleared his line with a kick. \nThe Boks enjoyed dominance in the scrum and were rewarded with a penalty try when a series of scrums ended in penalties to the South Africans, the last of which sent the referee under the poles to award South Africa five points. With the conversion from Pollard, the score was 14-0 at the break. \nThe Springboks then enjoyed the perfect start to the second half. Francois Louw ripped the ball from the opposition at the breakdown and Fourie du Preez broke blind from the ruck. He put in a deft kick that bounced perfectly for Bryan Habana to latch onto it and get his team under way after the break with his first try. The Pollard conversion made it 21-0 to Heyneke Meyer's men. \nBismarck du Plessis was on hand shortly thereafter to collect the ball from a Duane Vermeulen break from the scrum, and the hooker crashed over for his side's bonus point try. \nThe game then opened up for the Springboks, who added tries through Jesse Kriel, a double from Francois Louw and two more from Habana before Lwazi Mvovo rounded the victory up with a score after the final hooter. \nHabana's third try meant he equals Jonah Lomu for tries scored in World Cups, and will look to break the record when his side face the runners up of Pool A on 17 October.
