The midfielder, who spent two loan periods with Orient, sent in a shot from 20 yards that deflected off Connor Essam and sent goalkeeper Alex Cisak the wrong way.Orient improved following a double substitution at the interval and Simpson notched his 10th goal of the season in the 64th minute after substitute Ollie Palmer nodded a cross into his path.Three minutes later Graham, who had earlier been booked for a foul, was sent off when he kicked the ball away after conceding a free-kick.Orient pressed forward and were rewarded for their efforts in the first minute of the four added minutes when Kashket scored his first league goal after collecting a header from Palmer.
