Join the Conversation Alabama: Copeland's Corner John Copeland 8:07 p.m. CDT October 11, 2015 \nAnytime you win a game like this, coming from behind at first and then putting an SEC team away late, it builds some confidence as a team. Unfortunately, you still don’t see as much of that confidence on the offensive side of the ball, and the schedule doesn’t get any easier for Alabama from here on. Buy Photo \nJohn Copeland in Tuscaloosa, Ala. on Tuesday July 28, 2015. Copeland, an Alabama and Cincinnati Bengals football standout, will blog about Alabama football games this season. (Photo: Mickey Welsh / Advertiser) \nI see a team that’s grown and matured some, one that is settling into an identity and one that might be starting to understand what it takes to be champions. But the offense continues to be a serious concern. It was inconsistent for about three quarters of the game. The running game was up and down, the offensive line play was up and down, and the quarterback play was up and down. They kept trying to grind it out, and the long touchdown pass to Calvin Ridley really helped seal the game. But it was sealed because of the way the defense was playing more than anything else. You like to see explosive pass plays like the Ridley touchdown as a coach, but I don’t know how much confidence that necessarily builds within the offense. A 12-play drive that takes six minutes off the clock for a touchdown, where everyone is doing their job down after down, is what builds confidence. I don’t think one big play inspires as much confidence for the offense as a long drive does. \nI thought the offense was very good against Georgia, but I still wasn’t sure that it had arrived. The Arkansas game suggests it hasn’t yet. And with this schedule and this football team, I’m not sure we’ll ever know what we’ll see from week to week offensively. \nI think the biggest play of the game was definitely Arkansas’ failed fake punt. They ran one against Texas A&M too, and the Alabama staff saw that on film and was ready for it. Nick Saban even mentioned they were aware the fake punt was a possibility. I just don’t understand what Bret Bielema was thinking with that call. If you’re going to fake it, why not just line up in the offense and run a play? That way you have more control over the situation. A fake is rolling the dice and counting completely on the element of surprise. It wasn’t smart coaching on Arkansas’ part, given the situation and how well Bielema’s team had played up to that point. It wasn’t a very well-calculated risk. \nI still don’t believe Alabama should pull the plug on Adam Griffith as the kicker. If there was a better kicker on the roster, we would have seen him by now. Griffith missed a couple of kicks again, but it’s all mental with kickers. He obviously has the leg to do the job. He’s shown he can do it in the past. If I were Nick Saban, I would stay with the kid and believe that eventually, he will believe, too. But it does make play-calling a little tougher that you have a kicker you can’t always count on. It puts some more pressure on the offense to take a chance here and there, and it changes the way you look at things offensively when you get into field-goal range. \nDefensively, what can be said after giving up 44 rushing yards on a great rushing team like Arkansas? The defensive line is proving itself as the best defensive line in the country, and maybe the best defensive line Alabama has ever assembled. They are making the linebackers’ job easy at times. \nReggie Ragland played a great game, but the line did a lot to help him have a great game. There is nowhere to run, and even the biggest guys can play hash to hash and cause problems for the offense. \nAlabama completely dominated the line of scrimmage when Arkansas had the ball. I really look forward to seeing Alabama’s defensive line play against LSU’s offensive line, which is very, very good, in a few weeks.
