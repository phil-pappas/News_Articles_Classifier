Trevor Patel became the champion jockey for the first time at Pune, whereas for the veteran trainer this was the seventh championship crown.\nTrevor Patel, displaying incredible riding skill all through the season, also broke former jockey (now trainer) Malesh Narredu's record of 49 wins as he finished the season with 51 wins from 138 mounts. \n\nSuch was Trevor's incredible success run that his nearest rival, Dashrath Singh, despite a purple patch that saw him notching up 13 wins from 20 rides earlier this month, managed to finish a street behind, with only 24 wins from 108 mounts. Suraj Narredu, who rode as a retainer for Shapoor Mistry of Manjri stud farms, left his stamp in the third place, riding at an excellent clip of almost 40 percent, winning astride 19 horses from 49 rides.\nTrainer Lagad picked up the champion trainer's title with 28 winners 215 runners, scoring a decisive 7-point lead over runner up Pesi Shroff who managed to win 21 races from only 63 runners.\nThe race club's move of wasting no time in instituting a trophy in the memory of former ace jockey Shamu Chavan who passed away last month in Pune at the age of 91 received all round appreciation. Chavan's family members personally graced the occasion and gave away trophies to the winning connections of Alectar and Sindbaad who won the upper and lower divisions of the memorial race.\nIn a special ceremony, club chairman Zavaray Poonawalla felicitated legendary horse owner Dr MAM Ramaswamy in absentia for having won more than 600 Classics through his long association with the sport as a horse owner. Dr Ramaswamy watched the proceedings from Chennai through the live relay facility even as his trainer Ganapathy received the honours on his behalf.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:53:49.903+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
