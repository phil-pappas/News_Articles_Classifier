IndiaToday.in | New Delhi, October 15, 2015 | UPDATED 18:57 IST Mail A+ A- FC Goa players celebrate after scoring a goal. (ISL Image) \nHello and welcome to the LIVE updates from Match 12 of the Indian Super League between NorthEast United FC and FC Goa in Guwahati. \nFC Goa XI: Roy, Bikramjit, Luciano, Moura, Reinaldo, Joffre, Keenan, Arnolin, Kattimani, Sabeeth, Lucca \nNorthEast United XI: Bracigliano, Ralte, Hengbart, Raju, Silas, Reagan, Velez, Hanghal, Dadzie, Kamara \nPreview: Having stumbled to a defeat in their previous encounter, FC Goa need to pull up their socks as they clash with a lacklustre NorthEast United in an Indian Super League clash. \nThe Goans, who began the league with a smooth 2-0 win over Delhi Dynamos, held defending champions Atletico de Kolkata (ATK) to a 1-1 draw in another home tie, before finishing on the wrong side of a 4-0 scoreline against heavyweights Chennaiyin FC. \nArriving in this northeast Indian city for their first away clash, Brazilian legend Zico's charges need to overcome the absence of his compatriot and marquee Lucio - benched following a muscle strain. Spanish midfielder Jofre Mateu is also doubtful for the encounter as he limped off the field against Chennaiyin. \nUp against a team which is yet to open their points kitty, the Goans would rely on the likes Brazilian Leonardo Moura, Mandar Rao Desai and Romeo Fernandez to put it across NorthEast United who have lost both their matches. \nNorthEast United, wooden spooners in the previous edition of the tournament, crashed to a 1-3 defeat against Kerala Blasters before finishing with a 0-1 loss opposite FC Pune City. \nCesar Farais will be hoping against hope for a turnaround in his fortune so as to get off the mark on the points table at their own backyard. Leading the charge for the men-in-white will be Argentine forward Nicolas Velez alongwith local talent Holicharan Narzary.
