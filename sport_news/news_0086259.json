This proverb is not in use, and is unlikely to have been popular at any time, due to its slow rhythm and meandering style. It may have been a popular saying by a religious scholar, but due to its awkward phrasing, it couldn’t have made it far into popular usage. If you’re willing to try it on friends, brace yourself for a puzzled reaction.\nSource: Egyptian Proverbs, (Al-Ahram Center for Translation and Publishing, 1986) by Ahmed Taymour Pasha\nTranslated by: Nabil Shawkat", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:12:29.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
