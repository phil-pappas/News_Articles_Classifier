She served three points, but otherwise stood stationary at the end of a blowout win a month later. She also checked in at the end of the sectional championship game, but left before the team clinched the title. \nThat season, then-sophomore Clara Kaufman emerged in the middle and then-freshman Becca Schlechte on the outside to replace the senior hitter. \nIt was enough, and Stew-Stras ended up holding the state second-place trophy for Class 1A inside Redbird Arena in Normal. \nThis season, it's Schlechte who is hurt -- a concussion is keeping her on the bench -- and a busload of underclassmen are filling in. \nIt'd be nice to get as far as Stew-Stras did in 2013 despite the injury, but Windsor/Stew-Stras wants its junior setter back. \n\"We're not pushing it, but of course the coach in me, I need her out there,\" said W/SS coach Ronda Schlechte, Becca's mom. \"I'd like to see some of these matches with her, especially against Shelbyville.\" \nBecca said the original plan was to be back for the Sept. 28 game against Shelbyville, but she hasn't gone long enough without headaches. Next, she wanted to be back for the National Trail Conference Tournament this week. \n\"That probably won't happen,\" said Becca, who's instead hopeful for the week of Oct. 26. \"I really want to be back for regionals. \n\"I'm really getting antsy about getting back.\" \nThe Hatchets lost to Shelbyville in three sets Sept. 28, and then again in two sets this weekend at the Pana/Shelbyville Invite. \nStill, the Hatchets (16-6, 7-0 NTC) haven't lost to a 1A opponent. \nIn that respect, the underclassmen are getting along just fine without her. Freshmen Kenzi Tabbert, Jocelyn Schultz, Calla Roney and Megan Schlechte have stepped into the setter position this season. \nMegan, Becca's sister, is more often used outside. Schultz and Tabbert, who had 46 and 35 total assists respectively this past weekend, get the most work. \n\"We've been throwing girls into different positions if the consistency is not there,\" Ronda Schlechte said. \"We don't have a truly trained setter like Becca was. She spent so many hours with the setting training, and we haven't had time to do that right now. Setting has been pretty basic until this week.\" \nThis week the coach started pushing the envelope with her setters. They've started working on more advanced techniques, whereas during much of Becca's absence, they've merely put the ball in the air and counted on the hitters. \n\"We're working more quickly -- trying to think about where the blockers are at,\" Ronda Schlechte said. \"It's not just putting the ball up there to hit. There's a lot of thinking involved as a setter.\" \nIt's the kind of skill Becca brings to the offense. \n\"When I set, I like to run a lot of quicker stuff because it throws off the other team's blockers,\" Becca said. \nRonda Schlechte knew she had a lot of versatile underclassmen coming in this season, but is really counting on them now -- and that's OK. She's done it before, but now it's her daughter sidelined. \n\"It takes a strong kid to come back from these,\" Ronda Schlechte said. Becca has also had a broken ankle and suffered a shoulder injury in a car accident. \"It's hard on me seeing her not be out there because I know what she wants to do. She wants to be out there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T12:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:32:50.323+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
