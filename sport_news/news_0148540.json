It’s going to be important to start with a cushion of points that will give us tranquillity,” he added.\nCoach Gerardo Martino is hoping Messi, who also misses the trip to Paraguay next Tuesday, will recover quickly enough to become available for next month’s home match against arch-rivals Brazil and trip to Colombia.\nBanned Uruguayans\nBack in July, Chile lifted the Copa America for the first time in Santiago after Brazil, without the suspended Neymar, went home early following their penalty-shootout defeat to Paraguay in the quarter-finals.\nNeymar was sent off in a group match defeat to Colombia and banned for four matches after insulting Chilean referee Enrique Osses.\nHe has to sit out two of Brazil’s qualifiers, the second one at home to Venezuela next week.\nSuarez is still serving a nine-match FIFA ban for biting Italy’s Giorgio Chiellini at the 2014 finals in Brazil.\nHe missed the Copa America and will not become available again to coach Oscar Tabarez until March after sitting out Thursday’s visit to Bolivia and next week’s home clash with Colombia. Cavani is serving a two-match ban after being sent off in Uruguay’s quarter-final defeat at the Copa for hitting Chile’s Gonzalo Jara, who had infamously poked his finger up the forward’s backside.\nReal Madrid’s Rodriguez has suffered a relapse of a thigh injury and misses Colombia’s home match against Peru on Thursday and Tuesday’s trip to Montevideo.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T02:52:57.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
