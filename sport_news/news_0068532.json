(PATRICK SEMANSKY / AP) Mark Wogenrich Contact Reporter Of The Morning Call Penn State wins wild game over Maryland. \nBALTIMORE â€” Quarterback Christian Hackenberg set two career passing records, and was spared from a potentially crushing late fumble, and Penn State outlasted Maryland 31-30 in the team's most entertaining game of the season. \nThe Lions (6-2) overcame a day of lapsed tackles, inefficient running and difficult mistakes to become bowl-eligible for the second consecutive year. They also edged a game Maryland team that total plenty of offensive yards but turned the ball over five times. \nHackenberg threw three touchdown passes and set school records for completions and passing yards. But he also fumbled a third-down shotgun snap late in the fourth quarter, giving Maryland possession near midfield. \nA defensive stop, highlighted by Carl Nassib's third-down sack, saved the Lions from giving up another game-winning field goal to the Terps, who won last year's game on Brad Craddock's last-minute field goal. \nPenn State sealed the victory when Malik Golden intercepted a tipped pass with 1:15 remaining. \nThere were multiple lead changes in the second half as the two teams traded big plays and defensive miscues. Hackenberg threw second-half touchdown passes to DaeSean Hamilton and Geno Lewis, while Terps quarterback Perry Hills gashed Penn State with the draw and threw a touchdown pass of his own. \nMaryland, playing its first game under interim coach Mike Locksley, looked lively in the first half, taking a 10-7 lead. Quarterback Perry Hills ran for 51 yards, including a 12-yard touchdown sprint, but also had two turnovers. Another fumble, which the Terps recovered, halted a potential touchdown drive as well. \nAs a result, Penn State's defense, which spent nearly 20 minutes on the field in the first half, fared well in giving up just 13 points. Despite gaining 239 yards in the first half, Maryland settled for two Craddock field goals in the first half. \nThe Lions maintained so little time of possession because its offense consisted primarily of splash plays and little rushing. Penn State's run game was ineffective against stacked Maryland fronts in the first half, gaining just 15 total yards. Freshman Saquon Barkley, making his first career start, also fumbled twice, losing one. \nWith Maryland determined to stop Penn State's run game in the first half, Hackenberg took advantage of his one-on-one opportunities deep. The quarterback completed four passes of 37 yards or longer, including one for a touchdown. \nReceivers Chris Godwin and DaeSean Hamilton made Hackenberg look good with a series of tough catches. Godwin, who has developed into Penn State's best receiver, was central to two of those plays. \nThe sophomore made two contested catches, the second a one-handed grab, through a pass-interference penalty, that went for a 37-yard touchdown that gave the Lions a 14-13 lead. Hamilton had a similar catch downfield that set up Barkley's 6-yard touchdown run. \nWith the deep throws, Hackenberg became Penn State's career leader in passing yards, topping Zack Mills' former mark of 7,212 \nThe Lions' next series might have been among its oddest of the season. Hackenberg twisted a knee on a botched toss play, stepped off the field and returned to complete a 24-yard pass to Hamilton on 3 r d -and-15. \nOn the drive, Penn State lined up Barkley in the backfield with Akeel Lynch, went with a five-wide formation (with left tackle Paris Palmer lined as a receiver decoy) and ran an ill-fated play with backup quarterback Trace McSorley. The drive ended with a Joey Julius field goal, which gave the Lions a 17-13 lead at halftime.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T01:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:37:21.099+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
