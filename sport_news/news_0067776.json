One-handed Batman catch! #goutes #ASUvsUTAH https://t.co/3659J7LCc2 \n— Utah Athletics (@utahathletics) October 18, 2015 SALT LAKE CITY — Fourth-ranked Utah continued its best start since 2010 with a 34-  at Rice-Eccles Stadium. The Utes also snapped an 11-game losing streak to the Sun Devils and gained bowl eligibility for the second consecutive season in the process.\n\"I'm proud of our guys,\" said Utah coach Kyle Whittingham, who praised his team for being physical, determined and warriors. \"What more can I say? They weren't going to be denied tonight.\nAlthough it came on a mostly rainy night at Rice-Eccles Stadium, Utah’s Pac-12 South Division title hopes were anything but dampened. The Utes (6-0 3-0), who remain the only undefeated team left in the conference, hold a two-game lead or more in the loss column over every other squad in the division — putting them firmly in the driver’s seat for a berth in the Pac-12 Championship Game with six games left to play.\nThe Sun Devils, meanwhile, dropped back into the pack with the loss — falling to 4-3 overall and 2-2 in Pac-12 play.\nUtah running back Devontae Booker scored the game-winning touchdown on a 25-yard run with 10:41 left to play. Kicker Andy Phillips contributed a 43-yard field goal just over four minutes later as the Utes extended their edge.\nFor good measure, safety Tevin Carter recovered a fumble on the next play from scrimmage to help seal the deal for the Utes. The takeaway by the senior gave them possession on the ASU 23-yard line. Phillips eventually added a 35-yard field goal.\nUtah wasn’t done scoring, however. Booker later ran 62 yards for a TD. He finished with 118 yards on 21 carries.\nASU led 10-7 after one quarter despite having only 5 yards of total offense. The Sun Devils ran only nine plays and failed to get a single first down. Even so, they pulled ahead thanks to some special play on special teams.\nAfter the Utes scored on a 2-yard touchdown pass from Travis Wilson to Harrison Handley, ASU fired right back. Tim White returned the ensuing kickoff 100 yards, shifting to the right sideline and across the far goal line.\nTied at 7-7, the Sun Devils used a 48-yard punt return by De’Chavon Hayes to pull ahead late in the quarter. It set up a 39-yard field goal by Zane Gonzalez.\nUtah regained the lead early in the second when Wilson and Kenneth Scott teamed up for consecutive completions. The first was a 42-yard connection and the second was an 11-yard scoring strike. Phillips added the PAT to make it 14-10 with 13:49 remaining in the opening half.\nIt stayed that way for the balance of the quarter. Despite having a slight lead at the break, Utah held big statistical advantages in total offense (218-91), time of possession (18:29-11:31) and first downs (10-3). The Utes had an early touchdown off a fumble return by defensive end Pita Taumoepenu overturned by replay. Officials ruled that ASU quarterback Mike Bercovici threw an incomplete pass on the play and did not turn it over when he was hit by Utah defensive lineman Lowell Lotulelei.\nTrailing by four, ASU pull ahead 15-14 with 5:04 to go in the third quarter. The lead changed hands on a wild sequence that began with a 28-yard field goal by Gonzalez. The Sun Devils added a safety on the kickoff that followed when the Utes were flagged for an illegal forward pass. Britain Covey fielded the ball in the end zone and completed a throw to Bubba Poole, who was tackled in the end zone.\nBefore the quarter was complete, the Sun Devils added a 44-yard field goal by Gonzalez to make it 18-14.\nUtah responded with the fourth-quarter scores to prevail, extending its winning streak over the past two seasons to eight games.\nThe Utes return to action next Saturday at USC. The Trojans (3-3, 1-2) dropped a 41-31 decision at Notre Dame on Saturday. It’ll be their first game at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum since the firing of head coach Steve Sarkisian.\nEmail: dirk@desnews.com \nTwitter: @DIrkFacer", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:40:43.280+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
