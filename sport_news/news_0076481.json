(Image Source: Tom Pennington/Getty Images) \nYesterday we took a look at the undefeated teams in the AFC . The NFC also has three teams that have yet to lose a game, the Green Bay Packers, Atlanta Falcons and Carolina Panthers. Here’s a look at how they got there. \n-The Atlanta Falcons (4-0): Behind rookie HC Dan Quinn , the Falcons are 4-0 for the first time since 2012, a season that saw them win the NFC South and earn the No. 1 seed in the conference with a 13-3 record on the way to the NFC Championship Game. \nPivotal Pieces: Dan Quinn is a defensive-minded HC, but Atlanta is winning with offense. With QB Matt Ryan pulling the trigger their 137 points are second in the NFL thanks in large part to NFC Offensive Player of the Month Julio Jones . \n“It’s the exact same feeling now,” says Atlanta wide receiver Roddy White . “Guys are just anxious to be out there. And that’s what you want as a team. Everybody’s waiting for the next Sunday. Everybody’s preparing and getting themselves and their minds ready for Sunday. If we can keep that edge going, we’ll be good. We’re taking this thing one game at a time. It’s the NFL. You’ve got to be consistent. You can’t think that we can just show up and beat people.” \nAtlanta has the NFL’s second-leading passer in Ryan, who has thrown for 1,202 yards, and the league’s top receiver, as Jones has caught 38 passes for 478 yards and four scores. Neither is that surprising. What is, is RB Devonta Freeman leading the NFL with seven rushing TDs, the first player since LaDainian Tomlinson in his prime to have that many at the quarter pole. \n-The Carolina Panthers (4-0): Joining the Falcons atop the NFC South with a perfect record are the Panthers. They’ve only started 4-0 once before, that was in 2003, and they made it all the way to the Super Bowl that season. \nPivotal Pieces: While Atlanta is doing it with offense, Carolina is winning with defense. Their 17.8 points per game allowed is tied for the best in the NFC. Part of their formula is taking the football away. The Panthers lead the league with their eight interceptions, as well as their plus-eight turnover differential. Carolina has 11 takeaways (three fumble recoveries) to three turnovers. \n“It feels real good to be 4-0,” says Carolina linebacker Thomas Davis (team-high 36 tackles). “It’s definitely exciting but we can’t just be happy with that. We have to understand that we have tough opponents coming up and we have to be ready for that.” \nHalf of Carolina’s eight picks have come courtesy of CB Josh Norman , who has intercepted four balls this season, including two pick sixes, both of which lead the NFL. He is the first player in franchise history with four INTs at the quarter-pole and the first player with two INT-TDs four games in since Charles Woodson did so in 2008. So, it should be no surprise he was named the NFC Defensive Player of the Month. \n-The Green Bay Packers (4-0): The third undefeated club in the conference are the Packers who were last 4-0 in 2011, when they finished the season with an NFL-best 15-1 mark. \nPivotal Pieces: Is it even a question? QB Aaron Rodgers is so damn good. In that 2011 season, Rodgers set an NFL record with a passer rating of 122.5 on his way to the MVP. Through four games this season, he’s been as good, if not better. Rodgers has a passer rating of 125.9 to lead the league and is just the third QB ever ( Peyton Manning and Don Meredith were the first two) to throw 11 TD passes to no INTs four games into a season. WR’s Randall Cobb and James Jones each have four TD catches, tied for second in the league. \n“We’re 4-0 and in first place in the division,” says Rodgers. “We’re playing the kind of ball we want to play in most phases of the game. But there are peaks and valleys throughout the season and there are ups and downs.” \nIt would be a mistake to only give the offense credit for their 4-0 start, as the defense has been as good as Carolina’s, allowing just 17.8 PPG. They also have 17 sacks, which is second in the NFL, tied with the St. Louis Rams for the most in the conference. They are the only team with three players to have three sacks in linebackers Clay Matthews , Julius Peppers and Nick Perry . \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
