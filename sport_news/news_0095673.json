Three defendants in the sprawling FIFA corruption case have already made their way to the U.S. District Courthouse in Brooklyn, and more are expected in the near future, an assistant U.S. Attorney said Friday.\nProsecutors have been in talks with attorneys for overseas defendants in the case, AUSA Evan Norris told U.S. District Court Judge Raymond Dearie during a brief status conference for indicted former official Jeffrey Webb.\n\"We're in discussions with counsel for a number of other defendants,\" Norris said. \"We're hopeful we'll continue to see progress.\"\nTONY MEOLA: TIME TO CLEAN UP FIFA\nWebb and two other defendants in the investigation into international soccer corruption — American marketing executive Aaron Davidson and Argentinian businessman Alejandro Burzaco — have entered not guilty pleas but the remaining 11 defendants have not yet been extradited to the United States for arraignment.\nWebb, a resident of the Cayman Islands who was the president of the North American and Caribbean soccer federation known as CONCACAF and was a FIFA vice president, is accused of absconding with millions of dollars from kickbacks and bribes arising from marketing deals and rights fees.\nHe is free on a $10 million bond package he posted last month.\nEND ZONE: WEBB, SANZ TOOK OVER CONCACAF WITH SAME MAFIA WAYS\nNorris told the judge the government has begun turning over evidence to Webb's attorneys and that the case is proceeding. Webb is scheduled to return to court on Oct. 9 for another status conference. Davidson and Burzaco will again appear in court on Sept. 18.\nWebb, wearing a dark suit and accompanied by his wife, Kendra Gamble-Webb, and other family members, did not speak during the hearing. His attorney, Ed O'Callaghan, declined comment outside the courtroom.\nBRENDAN MCDERMID/REUTERS Jeffrey Webb (r.) and his lawyer Edward O'Callaghan exit court after Friday's status hearing. RELATED: KENDRA GAMBLE-WEBB PUTS UP DIAMONDS FOR HUSBAND'S BOND\nDearie okayed the two-month delay until Webb returns to court but he reminded Norris that Webb has a right to a speedy trial.\n\"I have no problem with the 60 days but at some point we're going to have to move forward,\" Dearie said.\nMeanwhile, the Washington-based law firm Quinn Emmanuel Urquhart & Sullivan has been retained by FIFA to conduct an internal probe that would include current and former FIFA officials. The firm will seek testimony and examine documents and electronic records from executive committee members in an attempt to keep FIFA itself out of the clutches of the U.S. prosecution, according to the Wall Street Journal.\nThe executives could face expulsion if they refuse to cooperate with the U.S. lawyers, as well as further investigation by U.S. prosecutors.\nAmong those from whom FIFA lawyers will seek testimony are two candidates for FIFA’s presidency: UEFA president Michel Platini and Korean industrialist Chung Mong-Joon, a former executive committee member.\nWhen U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced the indictment of 14 international soccer officials and executives, she promised more indictments to come. Fourteen officials were indicted in addition to four who have already pleaded guilty.\nRelated Stories FIFA hires François Carrard as chairman of reform committee Alejandro Burzaco pleads not guilty to FIFA scandal charges Ex-FIFA vice president Warner begins extradition fight Tags: jeffrey webb , fifa", "external_links": ["https://www.facebook.com/NYDNSports"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T18:40:17.131+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
