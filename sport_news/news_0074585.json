Lucia \nLeague-leading Caida Tiles tries to continue its winning streak when it shoots for its third straight win against sister team Racal Kama Motors in the PCBL Founders Cup at the Filoil Flying V Arena. \nThe two teams square off at 4 p.m. in this tournament being supported by Spalding, Accel, Aquabest and Ambucore. \nFresh from their 94-82 win over Jumbo Plastic, the Tile Masters are favored to win against Kama. \nSta. Lucia and Foton Toplander collide in the main game at 6 p.m. The Realtors finally barged their way to the win column, but not after another endgame collapse that nearly cost them the game against Supremo Lex. \n“It’s something we need to address. We have a tendency to celebrate early and that nearly cost us the match. It goes to show that despite our talented team, we still lack maturity,” said Sta. Lucia coach Bonni Garcia.
