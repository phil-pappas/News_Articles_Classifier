Newton found Olsen wide open down the seam as All-Pros Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman looked at each other in confusion. \nNewton was 12 of 15 for 169 yards in the fourth quarter and threw for 269 yards overall. He led the Panthers on a pair of 80-yard touchdown drives in the final period. \nThe Panthers improved to 5-0 for the second time in franchise history. \nIt was the second straight week the Seahawks (2-4) suffered a late defensive meltdown. \nRussell Wilson threw for 239 yards and found Jimmy Graham eight times for 140 yards, but the Seahawks lost at home for just the second time in the past two seasons. \nCarolina was unbeaten but unproven, with victories over lesser competition. A win in Seattle immediately added validity to the strong start. \nAn early wake-up call certain didn’t help Carolina’s cause. A fire alarm was pulled in the Panthers’ hotel around 5:40 a.m. PDT on Sunday morning, causing the players and staff to briefly evacuate some 7 ½ hours before kickoff. \nCarolina trailed 20-7 midway through the third quarter and by nine with less than 12 minutes remaining. But Newton overcame a poor first half and two interceptions to lead the late rally. \nJonathan Stewart had a second 1-yard touchdown run with 3:55 left to cut Seattle’s lead to 23-20, but Graham Gano pulled the extra point wide left. \nSeattle got one big play with Wilson finding Graham for 20 yards, but the drive stalled. After using two timeouts, the Panthers got the ball at their 20 with 2:20 remaining. \nNewton completed two quick passes and at the two-minute warning the Panthers were at their 46. He hit Ed Dickson to the Seattle 40 before but Bruce Irvin sacked Newton back near midfield, forcing them to use their final timeout with 1:20 remaining. \nNewton rebounded to hit Devin Funchess for 16 yards, Jerricho Cotchery caught a contested 7-yard pass, and after spiking the ball and moving quickly to the line, Newton saw the confusion in Seattle’s secondary, hitting Olsen for the winning score.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:34:26.067+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
