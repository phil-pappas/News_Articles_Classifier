Complete crap. Sorry to anyone who spent $ coming to this circus\n— Denny Hamlin (@dennyhamlin) October 25, 2015\n@NASCARonNBC Mike Helton and the other NASCAR \"suits\" want to keep Budweiser happy. All about the money, as usual. So they turn a blind eye.\n— Nelson H Bartlett (@nelsonhbartlett) October 26, 2015\nMike Helton = liar. \"What we saw, there is no evidence...4 car [of Harvick] did that was questionable other than moving out of line\". LOL\n— G. Brock (@mickeysooner) October 26, 2015\n@NASCARonNBC Mike Helton hasn't had a lucid thought since Dale Sr. crash.\n— Gregg Chapman (@shanksalot65) October 26, 2015\n@NASCAR #Harvick . He came on the radio and referred to a crash. Mike Helton you are gutless. Resign and let someone else lead. You're not!\n— American Dad (@FMartin1952) October 26, 2015\nIt seems to me this NASCAR point system rewards dirty tricks & disrespect. Remember that in coming weeks @KevinHarvick & @joeylogano fans.\n— Tom Beltz (@TomBeltz) October 26, 2015\n@TheOrangeCone Here's a never before seen angle of @KevinHarvick on the last lap today... pic.twitter.com/lIZMph4dcM\n— Dennis Riggs (@Riggler18) October 26, 2015\n@NASCAR @joeylogano The end of that race was BS Dale Jr didn't even get a chance to race his way to the finish, 4 car screwed that up\n— Mike Bretzing (@mbretz88) October 26, 2015\n@KevinHarvick classless move. Worse is NASCAR and the people of @NBCSN for pretending it didn't happen.
