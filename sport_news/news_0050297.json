Ding would continue rolling and take the second frame, but Craigie shows some life and opens his account by winning the third with a break of 75.The Chinese would claim the fourth with a top break of 98 for a 3-2 lead, but Craigie is in control in the sixth frame and manages to level the match 3-3.Not exactly the easy match that Ding had hoped for. They would exhcange the next two frames and the biggest battle of the night would play out in the ninth where Ding's experience would shine through as he splits the reds and takes control for a 5-4 lead.From there China's number one would end any hopes of a comeback as he safely takes the frame to eliminate Craigie in the qualification round by a score of 6-4.The other notable match of the night saw China's Tian Pengfei stun the defending champion Ricky Walden, with a top break of 106 in the fourth frame the youngster eliminated the title holder 6-4.
