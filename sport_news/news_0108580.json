Drivers who recently changed their address online and requested an updated license from the state may be receiving a new license but with their old address because of a computer problem. Lynne Sladky AP i Order Reprint of this Story TALLAHASSEE \nThousands of Florida motorists paid the state $27 to update the address on their driver’s licenses, only to be sent replacement licenses with the old address. \nThe problem happened to 8,576 people over five days, from Sept. 27 to Oct. 1. Some may not be aware of it because their new licenses haven’t arrived. \n“I went online to add my new address,” said Nicole Johnsen of Port Richey, whose license arrived at her new address days later. “But when I looked at it, it still had the old address on it.” \nThe Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles blames a hardware problem in its 30-year-old computer system. It has apologized to all affected drivers and will mail corrected licenses or state-issued IDs for free. The agency acknowledged the glitch after the Herald/Times asked questions about it. \nThe agency said it began making legislatively-mandated updates to its system Sept. 27, which led to a “synchronization delay” between the driver’s license system and the motor vehicle system, which are two different databases. The mailing address and the driver’s license address are separate fields in the computer system. \n“That delay meant that we were printing the licenses and ID cards faster than they were being updated in the system,” the agency said. \nJohnsen, 32, who works for an ambulance billing company, told Pasco County Tax Collector Mike Fasano about the problem and he fixed it, but she’s still waiting for the state to send her the right license. \n“What a mess,” Fasano said. “If they had just been transparent about it and notified the tax collectors immediately, we would have been prepared. The biggest mistake they made was trying to keep it secret.” \nTo add to the confusion, Johnsen could not fix the problem herself online without being charged another $27 ($25 for the card and a $2 fee to a credit card company). \nThe highway safety agency, under the direction of Gov. Rick Scott and three elected Cabinet members, is asking the Legislature for $7.4 million next year as part of its so-called motorist modernization project. \nThat includes nearly $700,000 for synchronization hardware. \n“This modernization will ensure that things like this don’t happen,” agency spokeswoman Alexis Bakofsky said. \nSome Florida drivers may not be aware of an often-overlooked state law that requires people to update the address on their driver’s license within 10 calendar days of moving or risk facing a $30 fine. \nResidents moving to Florida from another state have 30 days to apply for their initial Florida license. \nOn Thursday, the agency sent a notice to county tax collectors across the state, who issue most licenses, saying every affected driver would be mailed the right license by the close of business Friday. \n“The customer should destroy the outdated license,” the notice said. “A letter with instructions will be sent to the customer along with the corrected license.” \nThe state has declined to identify affected drivers by name and claims the information is confidential under federal law. \nContact Steve Bousquet at bousquet@tampabay.com or (850) 224-7263 .
