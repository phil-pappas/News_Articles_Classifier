Their paths to Kona's coveted starting line varied.\nFive qualified in their respective age groups, two earned slots vying against fellow corporate execs, three were lottery winners, two won Legacy lottery slots after years of participation and a national charity picked another as one its five race representatives.\nWhat follows is a brief description of these 13 athletes, who will be among the 2,300 starters attempting to complete the 2.4-mile swim, 112-mile bike ride and 26.2-mile run in Kona's hot, steamy, windy conditions.\nThe Repeaters : Consistency and passion describe Arlington's Tom Rodgers and Plano's David Jones.\n\"You have to love what you're doing,\" said Jones, a longtime Richardson Bike Mart salesperson, who is making his seventh Kona appearance.\nJones, 52, aspires to improve upon his 10th place age group finish at the 2013 Ironman World Championships.\n\"I fell apart in the last 10K,\" he recalled.\" That's the worst part in Hawaii. That's the make or break point for most people.\"\nRodgers, 55, is making his 9th trip to the Ironman World Championships. He's also done three Ultraman Championships at Kona. At 55, he's now the young guy in a new age group. He'd hoped to perform well this year, but a pesky hamstring pull curtailed his running.\nHe considered pulling out but instead plans to race competitively in the swim and bike and then walk the marathon.\n\"Instead of having a 10 hour time and placing 4th or 5th in my age group, I'll have a 13:30 time and finish in the dark.\"\nOther qualifiers: Coppell's Ellen Conley, 25, won her age group at Ironman Chattanooga to become a first-time qualifier. Fort Worth's husband and wife Brian and Alison Miller qualified at Ironman Brazil. Brian, 43, won his age group to earn his second Kona slot. Alison, 36, placed second to secure her spot at Kona after 10 tries.\nFund-Racer: Fort Worth's chef Jon Bonnell lost a childhood friend to leukemia. Years later, a high school friend's son died from the disease. Those losses inspired Bonnell to apply for and secure one of the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society's five Kona slots. Bonnell, 44, diligently trained to ensure a respectable finish and surpassed his original goal of raising $75,000. He's now attempting to raise $100,000 in research funds to eradicate the deadly disease.\nThe Executives: Mark Crouser, the vice president of finance for Balfour Beatty Construction, and Wyman Roberts, Brinker International CEO and president, qualified by racing against executive at designated Ironman Executive Challenge races.\n\"There's nothing like Kona, the environment, the atmosphere, the quality of athletes, excluding myself, is impressive,\" said Roberts, 56, a surfer, who grew up in Hawaii. \"It's surreal to compete on that course (with the pros). It all comes together for me in a special way.\"\nFor Crouser, 50, Kona is the culmination of four years of going from \"interested to fully invested in a sport that has transformed my life.\"\nThe race distance presents challenges, expected and unexpected, that push him to test his personal limits, physically and mentally, he said.\n\"Pushing past that moment and finding more in my tank to continue is a moment of both self-discovery and success that I haven't found anywhere else in life.\"\nLegacy Winners: Dallas' Phillip Jones and Jim Linck have raced more than a dozen full Ironman events but weren't able to qualify for Kona.\nBoth secured slots this year through Ironman's Legacy Program.\nTo be eligible, each had to complete at least 12 full Ironman-branded events, have never started the Ironman World Championships and have completed at least one Ironman event in 2013, 2014 and 2015.\nThey're among 100 Ironman Legacy winners this year including 64 Americans, 18 Australians, seven Canadians and four athletes from Great Britain. Other Legacy winners are from Singapore, Germany, New Zealand, Panama, Brazil and France\nLottery Winners: Parker City Councilman Scott Levine, 48, Dallas' Kyle Smialek, 31, and Justin's Clinton Peak, 25, were among the lucky few, whose names were chosen to race out of the tens of thousands who applied.\nBriefly : Sunday's Chicago Marathon will be broadcast live at Universal Sports Network, at 7:30 a.m. CST ... Fort Worth's Elizabeth Eder Northern placed seventh overall at the Twin Cities Marathon Sunday. She ran a personal best time of 2 hours, 40 minutes, 47 seconds ... Former UT and Flower Mound Marcus standout Craig Lutz had rough pro debut at the USA 10-mile championships, but he rebounded Wednesday with an online AMA (Ask Me Anything). He shared that his top goal in 2016 is to secure an Olympic Trials standard in the 10K. In five years, he sees himself as a marathoner.\nNorth Texas' Ironman participants\nName Age City Jon Bonnell 44 Fort Worth Ellen Conley 25 Coppell Mark Crouser 50 Colleyville David Jones 52 Plano Phillip Jones 53 Dallas Scott Levine 48 Parker Jim Linck 50 Dallas Brian Allan Miller 43 Fort Worth Alison Peters Miller 36 Fort Worth Clinton Peak 25 Justin Wyman Roberts 56 Colleyville Tom Rodgers 55 Arlington Kyle Smialek 31 Dallas CALENDAR\nSATURDAY'S RACES\nAga Khan Foundation Walk/Run 5K, Irving Convention Center, 500 W.
