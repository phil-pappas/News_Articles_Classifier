The St. Louis Rams will try to do just that this weekend in Glendale. It won't be easy. Just ask the Saints, Bears and 49ers. Through the first three games of the NFL season the Cardinals lead the league in points scored (126) and total touchdowns (17). Compare the Cardinals scoreboard exploits to that of the Rams, who have scored 50 total points through three games. \nIn fact, Larry Fitzgerald has more touchdown catches (5) than the Rams entire offense has delivered (4). The Cardinals have generated all of their offensive success without running their projected starting line-up out on the field. But by all accounts that should change this weekend. The Cardinals expect to have starting guard Mike Iupati on the field for the first time Sunday afternoon. They also anticipate having starting running back Andre Ellington in uniform for the first time in two weeks. \nNow the Rams have one of the best defensive units in football. Their defensive line, spearheaded by sack specialist Robert Quinn, is arguably the best in the game. The Cardinals offensive line, which has allowed only two sacks while producing three straight 100 plus yard rushing games, will face its biggest test thus far. But Quinn and company can't sack what it can't get its hands on. I'm not necessarily speaking in reference to the Cardinals offensive line in this regard, rather the surprising mobility Carson Palmer has displayed to date. \nPalmer doesn't come close to looking like a 35-year old quarterback coming off an ACL injury. He has dropped the jaws open of more than a few by running out of the pocket firing darts down field to his talented corp of receivers. Where did that come from? No doubt, it figures to be a long day for the Rams secondary. With that said it's prediction time. \nPREDICTION: \nThe Cardinals have too much offense for the Rams defense to bottle up and contain. The Cardinals defense is stout against the run and has returned three interceptions for touchdowns last two weeks. Just too much for a struggling Rams offense to match and keep up with. \nCardinals 34 Rams 13 Read or Share this story: http://12ne.ws/1KQnRZW TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:46:00.763+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
