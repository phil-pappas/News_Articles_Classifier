Shutting down the Lobos’ triple-option offense was not among them.\nMartin is of the opinion that offense rules the day in college football, and he knows NMSU’s defense is not currently stout enough to buck the trend.\nSo if the Aggies (0-3) are to snap a three-game losing streak to their northern rivals and end a 13-game skid overall, they’ll have to:\nAvoid giving up long plays on defense. Shut down the kick returns and trick plays UNM has burned them with in recent years. Score points early and often. The latter requirement could easily be underlined and repeated. Martin has often said his team needs to score at least 30 points to have a legitimate chance to win. But coming off a 50-47 overtime loss to UTEP and facing a potent UNM offense, he realizes 30 points might not be enough this week.\n“Good Lord,” Martin said with chuckle when asked how many points NMSU would need against the Lobos. “I don’t know. Just give me one more than they score, whatever that number is.”\nMartin and his players are thankful to be coming off a bye week that allowed extra time to prepare for UNM’s offense. They also understand two weeks of preparation may not be enough.\n“(The Lobos) have a solid O-line,” junior defensive end Noah Brown said. “Their pad level is great; they move well. We have our work cut out for us.”\nMartin is confident his defense will have its moments tonight and says getting to UNM’s quarterback, on run and pass plays, is essential.\n“When you go against an option offense, you’ve got to punish the quarterback,” Martin said. “You’ve got to hit him and make it a long night for him. If you don’t, he’ll make it a long night for you.”\nNew Mexico State’s defense has come up with some big plays in its first three games, forcing six turnovers to give the Aggies a plus-3 differential. But Martin concedes his unit is young and vulnerable when left on the field too long.\n“Our defense is getting better but we have to score points to help them out,” he said. “… We can’t give up scores on trick plays or special teams, either. We’re not good enough on defense to do that. That’s just the way it is.”\nThe Aggies would be more than happy to engage in a shootout similar to last season’s Rio Grande Rivalry game. UNM prevailed 38-35, scoring the winning touchdown with 27 seconds left and narrowly holding off a last-gasp NMSU drive.\nMartin expects the Lobos (2-2) to come after his offense with blitzes and pressure packages, but believes his talented skill-position players can win in one-on-one matchups.\n“We have to get some explosion plays,” Martin said. “Our receivers have to win and get open, (quarterback Tyler Rogers) has to make quick decisions, and we have to get (running back) Larry Rose to the second level.”\nOn defense, Martin does not want to see the “explosion plays” that cost NMSU dearly against UTEP.\n“We have to make (the Lobos) drive the ball,” he said.\nBut if it comes down to making a fourth-quarter stop, Brown said his unit will relish the opportunity. The Los Lunas native said he would love nothing better than getting a chance to make a key play in the longtime series.\n“This is a big game for the state of New Mexico, and it’s going to be a great time,” Brown said. “If it comes down to the fourth quarter, we’ll be confident and ready to make a play. That’s our mindset.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T09:42:04.172+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
