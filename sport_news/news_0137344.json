It's a privilege to be here as their manager, (I'm) proud to stand here as their manager.\" \nPortugal were the only other team to seal their place with their victory guaranteeing them top spot in Group I. \nAlbania, who lost 2-0 at home to two late goals in a politically-charged match against Serbia in the same group, can still pip Denmark to the automatic qualifying spot and a first ever place in any finals, if they win in Armenia on Sunday. \nPortugal have 18 points, Denmark, who have finished their programme have 12 and Albania have 11. \nIreland scored one of their greatest ever results by beating world champions Germany 1-0 in Dublin to keep their qualifying hopes alive in Group D. \nGermany top the group on 19 points, followed by Poland and Ireland both on 18. Poland drew 2-2 in Scotland, which ended Scottish hopes of qualifying, as they are cut adrift on 12. \nGeorgia beat Gibraltar 4-0 in the match between the two lowest ranked teams in the group. \nWith Northern Ireland assured of going through from Group F, Hungary remained in contention to finish in the top three with a 2-1 win over the Faroe Islands as do Romania, who drew 1-1 with Finland who are out. \nWith one match to play Northern Ireland have 20 points, Romania 17 and Hungary 16. \nThe top two teams in each of the nine groups qualify automatically along with the best-placed third team and four playoff winners from the remaining third-placed teams. \nHosts France, Austria, Czech Republic, England and Iceland had already qualified. \n(Reporting by Mike Collett; editing by Toby Davis ) \nOur top photos from the past 24 hours.
