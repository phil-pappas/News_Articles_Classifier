(Frank Gunn/The Canadian Press via AP) MANDATORY CREDIT By   (0) Comments \nTORONTO (AP) - Blue Jays third baseman Josh Donaldson left Thursday's AL Division Series opener against Texas after he was kneed in the head while breaking up a double play. \nEzequiel Carrera pinch hit for Donaldson with two outs and a runner at third base in the fifth, grounding out to end the inning. \nIn the fourth, Donaldson slid into the left knee of second baseman Rougned Odor and stayed down briefly before walking off the field. Donaldson played defense in the top of the fifth. \nToronto said Donaldson was removed as a precaution. The Blue Jays did not specify the severity of his injury. \nCliff Pennington took over at third base in the sixth. \nDonaldson hit .297 with a career-high 41 homers this season and led the AL with 123 RBIs. \nEarlier, Texas lost third baseman Adrian Beltre to back soreness after he landed heavily sliding into second base.
