Actually, they’re a lot better than that. \nWhen the Hamilton Tiger-Cats play host to the men in green on Friday night at Tim Hortons Field, the defence will keep in mind that Saskatchewan has averaged 380.8 yards a game on offence, the second-most in the CFL, and leads all teams with an average of 122.9 yards a game on the ground. \n“As a team, they have not got it done,” Ticats defensive co-ordinator Orlondo Steinauer said. “(But) they’re good, they are. That’s not something to say because it is the right thing to say. They’re a professional team. On film, offensively, I see them playing hard, I see their guys running routes, I see receivers trying to make blocks. We’re not taking them lightly.” \nAmong the Ticats’ concerns is the return to form of running back Jerome Messam, who is closing in on his second 1,000-yard rushing season in the CFL. The 6-foot-3, 245-pound Messam has 818 yards on the ground, one fewer than league leader Andrew Harris of the B.C. Lions. \nMessam had 1,057 rushing yards with the Edmonton Eskimos in 2011, but didn’t come close to that total in the following three seasons. What has to be done to contain the power of Messam? \n“Gang tackling and staying gap-assigned,” Ticats linebacker Simoni Lawrence said. “He is hard to tackle. They are going to give us a challenge, you know. \n“They are not one of those teams where you think you can just come out here and play and not pay attention to detail and win the game. If you do that, they will put up 40 points before you know it.” \nHamilton had success keeping Messam in check during a meeting between the clubs on July 26, a 31-21 Ticats win. Messam carried the football five times for 23 yards, the second-fewest he has had in a game this season. \nOverall, the Tiger-Cats defence has allowed an average of 90.5 yards a game on the ground, placing them in the middle of the nine-team league in that category. \nAnd if Roughriders interim head coach Bob Dyce thinks his team will catch a break because they won’t face injured Ticats quarterback Zach Collaros, he isn’t saying as much. \n“It doesn’t make a difference who is at quarterback with this Hamilton team,” Dyce said this week, “(because) you know they have a dynamic defence.” \nRESPECTING THE BOATMEN \nNaturally, Ticats head coach Kent Austin was tuned in when the Toronto Argonauts beat the Ottawa RedBlacks 38-35 on Tuesday night, a victory determined by a stunning one-handed catch by the Argos’ Chad Owens in the final minute. \n“Pretty spectacular, especially given that situation,” Austin said of Owens’ eye-popping grab for the game-winning score. “It’s what great players do. Great players make great plays at the right time and he is certainly one of them.” \nLawrence also was watching at home as Toronto won for the eighth time, putting it in a three-way tie (based on points) for first place in the East Division. \n“That was a hell of a catch,” Lawrence said. “Chad Owens is a great player. All those (Argos) receivers are good — (Tori) Gurley, (Vidal) Hazelton and (Kevin) Elliott. I love watching those guys play. When we play against them, I hate them, but they are one of my favourite groups of receivers to watch play.” \nThe Ticats, settled in Tim Hortons Field for 13 months after living a nomadic existence with their departure from Ivor Wynne Stadium in 2012, can sympathize with the Argos. Once the Argos move into BMO Field next season, it will put an end to playing home games on the road, as they did Tuesday in Ottawa and likely will on Oct. 17 in Hamilton against the Calgary Stampeders. \n“I’ve got a lot of respect for (Argos head coach) Scott (Milanovich), as I have mentioned before,” Austin said. “He is a really good coach and gets his team ready to play, his staff does. \n“Sometimes, when you have been in that environment, it becomes more familiar as opposed to a radical change. Players are adaptable and coaches are adaptable and just focus on the things that are important, and Scott and his staff have been able to do that for those guys. Good for them.” \nEXTRA POINTS \nThe Ticats are hopeful that defensive end Eric Norwood, activated off the six-game injured list, will play. “Norwood looks good (in practice), but the nature of these things is if there is any kind of setback we have to be careful,” Austin said ... Centre Mike Filer, who has been banged up, appears to be ready to play ... Receiver Andy Fantuz and running back C.J. Gable, both dealing with an elbow injury, are improving. “I would say they are close but they are not there yet,” Austin said. “I know that’s about as vague as it gets, but that’s the only way I know how to couch it because there hasn’t been a definitive turning point.” \nterry.koshan@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:52:23.917+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
