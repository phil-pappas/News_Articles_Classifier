(Photo: Mickey Welsh / Advertiser) \nTexas A&M has had this game circled on its calendar for the entire year, not only because it was a 59-0 blowout last year, but also because it’s Alabama. \nAlabama has been on top for a long time, and it gets everyone's best shot, but Texas A&M has something to prove here after what happened last year. Losing that game will give it extra motivation. \nSome people think a beatdown like 59-0 would give Alabama a mental advantage this year, because the Aggies should have some doubts in their mind about whether they've improved enough to even stay on the field. But I don't agree with that — it's not like a prize fighter in boxing who gets knocked out in the first round and can't get in the ring with the same guy again without having doubts. \nIn college football, you have a lot of turnover every year, so this is a different Texas A&M team. The Aggies have a different quarterback (Kyle Allen) than they had against Alabama last year (Kenny Hill), they have a lot of different players like Christian Kirk at receiver, so they should be ready to play. I would expect that Texas A&M had a great week of practice, as well. It's undefeated, so it has too much to play for against Alabama. \nThere is no question the teams that have a spread offense give Alabama the most trouble. Quarterbacks don't necessarily have to be able to run, but the ones that can extend pass plays make a big difference, too. Texas A&M is going to try to make sure Alabama can’t get the subs it wants on the field while the offense is going uptempo. \nAlabama has to know that the nickel or even the dime defense is going to be like the regular defense in this game, because you want to have enough speed on the field and enough defensive backs to cover four-receiver sets. Texas A&M can also take Alabama's defensive line out of the game a little bit by throwing a lot and getting the ball out so quickly the pass rush can't get to the quarterback. These are the kinds of teams that Nick Saban's defense has struggled with most. \nAlabama is basically already in a playoff situation, because if the Crimson Tide loses one more game, they're pretty much out of the hunt. That means the mental focus and preparation has to be strong every week, and I've seen some signs of maturity on this team that tells me Alabama might be getting there. \nThe receivers have definitely improved and exceeded expectations in some ways. Jake Coker has improved a little bit, but still has his up and down moments. He's got to learn to throw the ball away at the right time, but you can see he's getting a little more comfortable out there. \nThe defensive line has dominated like we knew it would, and the linebacker corps has exceeded expectations. \nThe secondary is still working out some kinks, but Eddie Jackson is playing really well at safety right now, and Marlon Humphrey is getting a ton of experience at one corner spot. \nThe offensive line is holding its own, but I thought it would be a little better at this point in the season. Too many of the rushing yards seem to come from one or two big plays, but what the line needs more than that is consistency. \nDerrick Henry hasn't had a lot of drives where he's just taken over for six or seven yards a carry down after down. Part of that is Lane Kiffin's playcalling, but another part of that is that the offensive line hasn't been consistent enough to allow that to happen. \nThe kicking game has been disappointing, of course. Before the season, I thought that after the defensive front seven, the kicking game might be the next best thing about this team. That hasn't happened yet. \nBut the team is beginning to show an ability to get through adversity. It's a more confident team today than it was when Alabama first took the field against Ole Miss. It struggled against Arkansas, but it stayed the course. Even when the kicking game faltered, it handled what it was faced with and put the game away at the end. A lot of guys on this team are young, but they’re showing championship character.
