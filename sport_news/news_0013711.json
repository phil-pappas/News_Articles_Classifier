(Photo: PTI) Mumbai: Wicketkeeper-batsman Dinesh Karthik hit a strokeful 167 to help Tamil Nadu (TN) post a mammoth 434 on day two against Ranji giants Mumbai in the Group A league encounter here on Friday.\nStarting on their overnight score of 249 for six at the Bandra Kurla Complex, TN rode on Karthik's 24th first-class century, which was laced with 19 fours and a six, to overshadow Mumbai left-arm spinner Vishal Dabholkar's five-wicket haul. The Aditya Tare-led Mumbai were 45 for two at the end of day's play to trail by 389 runs.\nTN medium-pacers Mohammed and Jagatheesan Kousik picked up a wicket each to put the hosts on the backfoot early on. For the Baba Indrajith-led side, opener Baba Aparajith (62) and Malolan Rangarajan (61) were the other contributers even as Karthik's innings stood apart.\nIt was Karthik's seventh wicket 182-run stand with Rangarahan that did the trick for the visitors as the Mumbai bowlers were made to toil hard.\nDabholkar, who had pocketed 4 wickets yesterday, took one more today to record his second first-class fifer as he was ably helped by Dhawal Kulkarni and Shardul Thakur, who bagged two wickets apiece.\nBrief scores: Tamil Nadu 434 all out in 144.4 overs (B Aparajith 62, D Karthik 167, M Rangarajan 61; V Dabholkar 5-122) against Mumbai 45/2 in 29 overs (S Mangela 20*; Mohammed 1-13, J Kousik 1-4)\n Dinesh Karthik Ranji Trophy Tamil Nadu sports Also Read Commonwealth Games 2014: Vikas Thakur bags silver in weightlifting MSD comfortable in shorter formats: Sunil Gavaskar Pregnant cow rescued from deep pit at Pammal Jayalalithaa verdict: No celebrations, orders DMK", "external_links": ["http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/Dinesh%20Karthik%20IPL%20auction_0.jpg", "http://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js", "http://static.ak.fbcdn.net/connect.php/js/FB.Share", "http://campaign.bharatmatrimony.com/track/clicktrack.php?trackid=00100326114361", "https://apis.google.com/js/plusone.js", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/151016/sports-cricket/article/ranji-trophy-dinesh-karthik-ton-puts-tamil-nadu-command", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/BharatMatrimony_texlink_banner_620x40px.gif", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php", "http://vuukle.com/js/vuukle.js", "http://dd508hmafkqws.cloudfront.net/sites/default/files/styles/article_node_view/public/Dinesh%20Karthik%20IPL%20auction_0.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-17T09:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T22:33:46.501+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
