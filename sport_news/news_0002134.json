Greg Engle, Getty Images Of all the races that comprise NASCAR ’s 10-race playoff, this week’s stop at Talladega Superspeedway is perhaps the wildest wild card of them all. At 2.66 miles Talladega may not have the highest average speeds, but thanks to restrictor plates the racing here is fast, close and furious with drivers one small mistake away from total disaster in not only the race but their entire season. Many dread Sunday’s race and hope to simply survive and more onto the next round. Four drivers Sunday will see their hopes of advancing in the Chase end as they will be eliminated from championship contention. Those drivers currently outside the top eight are in desperation mode and should be the most aggressive in the field. Here are the odds , current as of Thursday morning, for your NASCAR betting or your fantasy racing leagues as the NASCAR Sprint Cup series heads to Talladega Superspeedway. The Driver Ratings, a stat that combines other stats to determine the top drivers, was compiled from 2005-2015 races (21 total) among active drivers at Talladega.\nDale Earnhardt Jr . (9-2) is the odds on favorite this week. And rightly so. He has the highest driver rating, 92.8, but is 11th on the Chase grid with a seemingly insurmountable 31 points to make up if he hopes to advance to the next round. However, he is tied with Jeff Gordon for the most wins at Dega, 6, and won two of the three previous restrictor-plate races this season. If he can avoid trouble and pull off a win Sunday he would be the first driver to win three restrictor-plate races since his father Dale Earnhardt Senior did it in 1990. Of the drivers who must win to advance it seems that Earnhardt, who won here in May, has the best shot.\nJimmie Johnson (7-1)isn’t in the Chase but has the stated goal of finishing as high as fifth in the points. He has the third best driver rating in the field, 89.0. He has two wins here, the last coming in the spring of 2011. He was second this past May and if he can shake the gremlins that have plagued him recently, Johnson could go all the way.\nMatt Kenseth (10-1) is just as desperate as Earnhardt for a win. Kenseth was well inside the top eight last week but in the closing laps was bumped by Joey Logano and spun after leading a race-high 153 laps. He is now at the bottom of the Chase grid, 35 points out of the cutoff. But his stats bode well for him here; he has the second highest driver rating, 89.2, has a win here fall 2012). He was a mediocre 25th here in May, but given the performances he has staged lately, Kenseth could be the driver to beat Sunday.\nBrad Keselowski (15-1) sits just about the cut line for the next round. He’s the defending winner of this race however and will be looking to make a strong statement. He has the sixth best driver rating, 83.2 in the field but was 22nd here in May. However, all of Keselowski’s wins at Talladega have been big; he won last year on green-white-checkered flag pass, won his first career race at Talladega in spring of 2009 as a complete dark horse running for James Finch and also took the checkered flag in the spring of his 2012 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series championship season. A win Sunday would be big for Keselowski again as it could propel him to be one of the favorites to go all the way this year.\nKevin Harvick (12-1) is also pretty safe sitting fifth in the Chase. However he has also shown a great deal of strength since the Chase began, despite not winning. He has a driver rating of 79.9, 10th in the field was eighth here in May and won the spring race in 2010. Harvick has shown that you can’t count him out and if the mechanical issues stay away he should be right in the mix to win it all Sunday.\nOthers: Jeff Gordon (12-1) has six wins here, tied with Earnhardt and led 47 laps in the spring before mechanical issues left him with a 31st place. His last win here came in this race in 2007 however and he has a driver rating of 79.2, 15th best. If he puts it all together Sunday he could go all the way, but it would be a surprise. Kurt Busch (15-1) wouldn’t be a surprise winner however. He has the fifth best driver rating, 88.3, along with six top fives and 14 top 10s. In fact, it’s kind of surprising that the eldest Busch brother has never won at Talladega, that however could all change Sunday.\nHere are the clinch scenarios for Sunday as eleven drivers are looking to fill seven spots (Joey Logano by virtue of his two wins in the round is already guaranteed to move on):\nDenny Hamlin: 14th and no laps led; 15th and at least one lap led; 16th and most laps led\nKurt Busch: 8th and no laps led; 9th and at least one lap led; 10th and most laps led\nCarl Edwards: 7th and no laps led; 8th and at least one lap led; 9th and most laps led\nKevin Harvick : 3rd and no laps led; 4th with a lap led\nJeff Gordon and Brad Keselowski: 2nd or better; 3rd and at least one lap led; 4th and most laps led\nMartin Truex Jr.: 2nd and no laps led; 3rd and the most laps led\nKyle Busch, Ryan Newman, Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Matt Kenseth only control their own destiny with a win .\nSunday’s NASCAR Sprint Cup CampingWorld.com 500 will take the green flag just after 2:30 p.m. ET Sunday. Live coverage will be on the NBC Sports Network.", "external_links": ["http://www.racing-reference.info/tracks/Talladega_Superspeedway", "http://www.vegasinsider.com/auto-racing/odds/futures/", "http://fantasygames.nascar.com/"], "published": "2015-10-22T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T03:14:16.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
