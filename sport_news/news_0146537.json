South Africa took an unassailable 2-0 lead by winning the second Twenty20 International of the three-match series at the Barabati Stadium here on Monday, the last of which will be played at the Eden Gardens on October 8. Chasing India’s total of 92, South Africa crossed the line with six wickets in hand. J.P. Duminy top-scored with an unbeaten knock of 30, while Morkel returned with figures of 4-0-12-3. “I think couple of months ago, I thought I would never get the opportunity to play for South Africa again, this is my 50th cap. I’m just happy to have played a small part in the series win. Fielding plays a massive role in T20 cricket,” Morkel said at the post match presentation ceremony. “I arrived on Friday, during the first T20. One practice session, but it’s nice, it often works out that way, not too much thinking, just come in and play,” he said. The 34-year-old all-rounder added: “We got two of their big guns with two fantastic run-outs. We got wickets anyway, but throw in those run-outs, and that really put us on top.” Morkel said he expects India to come back strong in the last T20 match in Kolkata. “They are a world-class unit, we know what they can do. The series is done now, but I expect them to bounce back in Kolkata,” Morkel said.
