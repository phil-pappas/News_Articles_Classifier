Championship Series. Tweeted the governor, \"Congrats to the @astros on advancing to the ALCS!. Hoping for an all-Texas #ALCS. Looking at you @Rangers.\" \nSeemed safe enough to send the tweet with the Astros ahead 6-2. It's just that the Royals then scored seven unanswered runs and won 9-6. The series is now tied 2-2, with the fifth and deciding game Wednesday in Kansas City. \nAh, but wait a minute. The tweet, which eventually was deleted, apparently was sent by a staffer. Abbott advised Astros fans to unfollow him at @GovAbbott and switch to his personal account.
