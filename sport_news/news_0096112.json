He joined Todd Helton (twice), Ellis Burks and Larry Walker. \nThat was it for Colorado, which failed on its three chances with runners in scoring position and lost for the seventh time in 10 games. \n“Anderson did a good job fastball, changeup mix,” Rockies manager Walt Weiss said. “We had hard time putting anything on the barrel.” \nIn his last outing, Anderson struck out a career-high 10 and allowed a run in six innings, but ended up with a no- decision in the 4-1 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. \nThe right-hander didn’t pile up the strikeouts against the Rockies, but worked around traffic to end the season with his team winning. Anderson fanned four. \nDJ LeMahieu drove in the lone run against Anderson in the second inning with a sacrifice fly after Justin Morneau hit his third triple of the season. \n“There was some pretty good contact early and our ballpark is not a very good fly ball ballpark, but he settled down and started locating better” Hale said. “He finished strong, which is good to see.” \nBettis had been solid since coming off the DL with elbow inflammation on Aug. 24, going 3-1 with a 3.24 ERA in six starts. \nBettis escaped a bases-loaded jam in the second and stranded a runner at third in the third before giving up a sacrifice fly to Gosselin in the fifth. \nHe allowed two runs — one earned — on six hits with six strikeouts and three walks. \n“You always want to walk away on top,” Bettis said. “There were about three pitches that I wished I had located a little bit better. \n“Like I said, there is still some progress to be made.” \nPeralta put Arizona up 3-1 with a sacrifice fly in the seventh. \nTRAINER’S ROOM \nDiamondbacks: Brito replaced Ender Inciarte (bruised shin) in right field. \nUP NEXT \nRockies: RHP David Hale, today’s starter against the Diamondbacks, is 0-1 with an 8.71 ERA in three career games vs. Arizona. \nDiamondbacks: LHP Patrick Corbin is 3-2 with a 2.27 ERA heading in his final start of the season, today against Colorado.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T09:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T04:47:17.959+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
