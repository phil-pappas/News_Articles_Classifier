In previous seasons, the Central District was represented by two boys teams and two individuals in Divisions II and III and two girls teams and two individuals in Division II.\nWhen the tournament begins today, Greater Columbus will have only the Bexley boys and Fairbanks girls in Division II and the Fisher Catholic boys in Division III. Chris Williard of Hartley and Liza Weisman of Bexley will play as individuals in the Division II boys and girls tournaments.\nThe Division II boys play at NorthStar Golf Club in Sunbury, and the Division III boys and Division II girls at the Ohio State Golf Club’s Scarlet and Gray courses, respectively.\nAssistant commissioner Bob Goldring of the OHSAA said the organization is conforming to guidelines of state tournaments in other sports.\n“Not necessarily the best teams make it to the state tournament,” Goldring said. “It’s about equal representation based on the number of schools in a district. The golf coaches got used to the previous system, but we don’t know if that (system) was fair. We see both sides of it.”\nColumbus area coaches and players are upset.\n“This is terrible, an insult,” veteran Bexley coach Jim Ryan said. “Do they want the best teams or do they want participation? It’s almost as if they are saying that everybody gets a trophy. They are going to have to revisit this.’’\nThe system was changed because of complaints from schools in the East and Southeast districts.\nThe biggest losers were the Hartley boys in Division II and Wellington boys in Division III. They were runners-up in the district tournaments at Denison Golf Club. Hartley’s district score of 311 and Wellington’s 313 were lower than nine of the 12 teams in their respective divisions in the state tournament.\n“This doesn’t necessarily make sense to me,” Hartley coach David Liskowiak said. “But we did know Bexley was the team to beat and we didn’t get it done.”\nFisher Catholic coach Trevor Saffeld agrees with Ryan.\n“The state tournament is for the best teams playing for the trophy,” he said. “What happened was done in an arrogant fashion. They said, ‘This is the way it’s going to happen, so deal with it.’ I’m having a hard time with this.”\nBexley and Fisher Catholic think they can bring home championships.\n“I told our team that we’re going to the tournament to win it, and I don’t want anyone just being happy to be there,” Ryan said.\nWilliard shot 71 in the district tournament but needed a 20-foot birdie putt on the first hole of a playoff to defeat Caden Orewiler of River Valley to advance. Among the girls, Weisman, a senior, will play in her third straight state tournament. She shot 74 to win by nine strokes in the district.\n“It’s exhilarating making it here again,” she said. “What a way to end my senior year. I like this pressure.”\n@MarkZnidar", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/markznidar/"], "published": "2015-10-16T13:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:39:53.041+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
