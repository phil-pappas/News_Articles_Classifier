So when Pine View made the drive up from St. George to take on Murray on Wednesday night, no one would have blamed them for having somewhat of a letdown game.\nBut the opposite happened, as the Panthers overcame two first-half interceptions from quarterback Riley Livingston to come out on top over the Spartans 20-10.\nThose interceptions almost proved to be costly for Livingston and company. One of them, specifically, came in the red zone when the Panthers were looking to put some distance in between themselves and the Spartans early on.\nLuckily for Pine View, Murray couldn’t capitalize on said turnovers. This kept the game close, but with the help of 100-plus yards on the ground from running back Kobe Topalain, the Panthers stayed afloat until the end of the third quarter when they really turned things on.\nShortly after Livingston dropped a 35-yard beauty of a pass to receiver Steve Bangerter that put Pine View up 17-7, the defense stepped up in a big way by forcing a fumble. A Panther quickly pounced on it, forcing another turnover and giving Pine View the ball right before the third quarter ended.\nA field goal from both sides filled the fourth quarter to push the score to the final of 20-10.\nTwitter: @GriffDoug", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:14:51.018+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
