The Cardinals allowed a 14-6 halftime lead to slip away and battled back to within six points against visiting Ballard. \nColtin Whitten scored a touchdown with 8:16 left in the fourth quarter and Thomas Cox tacked on the two-point conversion run to pull the Cardinals to within six points, 28-22. Cox and Josh Miller scored touchdowns in the first half for Newton. \nThe Newton defense held and regained possession of the football late in the fourth period. Newton drove down the field where it had a first-and-goal at the Ballard 1-yard line. \nA five-yard penalty pushed the Cardinals back, and then on a fourth-down play, the Bombers were penalized for pass interference with 9.2 seconds remaining in the game. The Bombers stopped the Cardinals at the 1-yard line as time expired. \nReece Caves had 10 tackles and a fumble recovery for Newton’s defense. Aaron Bartles, Miller and Cox each had five tackles. Bartles and Ty Arguello each had an interception. \nNewton plays at Pella Friday. \nContact Jocelyn Sheets at 641-792-3121 ext. 6535 or jsheets@newtondailynews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:57:45.417+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
