But do not expect the San Diego quarterback to have that on his thoughts Sunday when the Chargers play at Cincinnati.\nRivers completed his final 20 passes against Detroit in the opener, however did not realize until the following day that he had that robust streak going. The league record for consecutive completions is 24, set by former Philadelphia quarterback Donovan McNabb.\n&quotWe had been in a pretty good groove,&quot Rivers told reporters this week.\nCompared with the significance of winning, a private record is not even a blip on Rivers’ radar screen. And the Bengals present quite a challenge, possessing beaten the Chargers 3 of the four occasions they’ve played considering that 2010.\nSan Diego’s lone victory in these meetings came in a 2013 initially-round playoff game at Cincinnati, when the Chargers feasted on three second-half turnovers by Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton and cruised to a 27-ten victory.\nThe Chargers had 12 receptions in that postseason game. They are now coming off an opener in which third-year receiver Keenan Allen had 15 catches on his own, tying a club record set by Hall of Fame tight end Kellen Winslow.\nAllen this week stated that coming off that monster game his private objectives are clear: &quotBuilding. Stacking. Becoming consistent.\n&quotIt’s about going back to work, like we ain’t played a game yet, like the stats are nonetheless zero-zero.&quot\nAttention to detail has been an issue in the past for Allen, who is tremendously talented but was acquiring a reputation for inconsistent preparation in his initial two seasons. If the Chargers handed out a most-enhanced-player award in instruction camp, Allen may have won it. By all accounts, he has come to be far more of a pro in the way he eats, hones his craft, and approaches the game in basic.\nThere is still some reluctance by teammates to heap as well much praise on him, although, for fear that he could take his foot off the gas.\n&quotHe had a fantastic game,&quot All-Pro security Eric Weddle said. &quotLet’s just retain him level-headed proper now. We want Keenan fantastic just about every week, and he knows that. We want consistency week in and week out. That is what separates the superior and wonderful ones.&quot\nAnd as Chargers receivers have come to know, when they produce that separation &#8230 Rivers will uncover them.\nBy the book\nSunday’s New England-Buffalo game will mark the 14th time in his career as a head coach that Rex Ryan has game-planned against quarterback Tom Brady.\nRyan, who coached the New York Jets for six seasons prior to taking over in Buffalo this off-season, is three-9 against Brady-led teams in the regular season, and 1- in the playoffs.\nIn the new book &quotBrady vs. Manning,&quot which delves into the illustrious careers and friendship of the Patriots star and Peyton Manning, Ryan stated he feels a bit of apprehension when facing either quarterback with a game on the line.\n&quotI worry no one&#8230 possibly a little bit,&quot Ryan told author Gary Myers, whose book will be in stores this week. &quotI’ve been beaten by each of them in those situations. It’s like, Oh&#8230, this guy is going to do it to me again. They are deadly. It is impossible to opt for amongst the two.&quot\nLongtime NFL executive Ernie Accorsi told Myers he hates generating comparisons, but if he did&#8230\n&quotI’m talking about style. Brady is far more like [Joe] Montana. Peyton is extra like [Johnny] Unitas.&quot\nYouth is served\nBecause Atlanta’s Matt Ryan and Baltimore’s Joe Flacco opened their careers as very first-stringers in 2008, the NFL has had at least a single rookie quarterback begin in Week 1. That eight-year streak is the league’s longest considering that at least 1950.\nThinking about the achievement they had &#8212 each Flacco and Ryan quarterbacked 11-5 teams and made the playoffs &#8212 it’s no wonder they sparked a trend.\nThe largest bumper crop of Day 1 starters through that span came in 2012, when rookies Andrew Luck of Indianapolis, Robert Griffin III of Washington, Ryan Tannehill of Miami, Russell Wilson of Seattle, and Brandon Weeden, then of Cleveland, all started their career openers.\nThe two rookies who created that list this fall are Tampa Bay’s Jameis Winston and Tennessee’s Marcus Mariota.\nWish you have been right here\nSeattle defensive end Michael Bennett, whose -1 group plays at Green Bay on Sunday evening, stated the Seahawks are feeling the effects of All-Pro safety Kam Chancellor’s contract holdout.\n&quotI feel we miss Kam Chancellor not just mainly because of the way that he plays, but because of the way that he approaches the game and his leadership,&quot Bennett mentioned.\nHe added: &quotHe’s our brother, we fight for him, we really feel for him, we fully grasp his pain&#8230 We want him to come back and recognize that there is no really hard feelings to what he’s going through or what he’s dealing with.&quot\nAsked no matter whether he can see himself in Chancellor’s cleats, potentially as a future holdout, Bennett mentioned he would have to answer to a larger authority than the Seahawks or Coach Pete Carroll.\n&quotAt the end of the day, my situation is different than his,&quot Bennett said, referring to Chancellor. &quotI’ve got 3 youngsters, I’ve got a wife. My wife would not let me hold out, so I had to come to perform.&quot\nWords of wisdom\nBennett said he has a lot of respect for Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers and just how physically difficult he is. But he also mentioned the Packers quarterback does a lot of speaking on the field.\nAsked by reporters what Rodgers says when he gets hit, Bennett didn’t have to assume as well hard to recall.\n&quot’Ehhh&#8230′ Stuff like that,&quot he said. &quotMoaning sounds.&quot\nChatterbox.\nAdhere to Sam Farmer on Twitter @LATimesfarmer\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-nfl-week-2-farmer-20150920-column.html"], "published": "2015-09-20T06:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T10:06:17.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
