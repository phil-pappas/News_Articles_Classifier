(AP) — New York Giants cornerback Prince Amukamara is going to miss two to four weeks because of a chest injury. \nGiants coach Tom Coughlin disclosed the pectoral injury before Thursday’s practice for Monday night’s game at Philadelphia. Amukamara was hurt in the victory over the San Francisco 49ers on Sunday night. \nJayron Hosley is expected to replace Amukamara, who leads the team with seven passes defended. Hosley started against Washington when Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie was out with a concussion. \nThe Giants also signed cornerback Brandon McGee and offensive lineman Xavier Proctor to their practice squad. To make room, the team terminated the contracts of offensive lineman Adam Gettis and tight end Dominique Jones.
