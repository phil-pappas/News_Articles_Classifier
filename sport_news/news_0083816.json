The Cubs win the Division Series! Oh, my God, the Cubs win the Division Series! OK, not quite the same ring to it as radio announcer Russ Hodges —“The Giants win the pennant!”— broadcasting Bobby Thomson’s “Shot Heard Round the World” for the New York Giants in 1951. But in Chicago, a city without a National League pennant since 1945, it’ll do. The Cubs beat the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4 Tuesday night and set off a celebration that looked like a World Series party you’d see in any other city. Long-suffering fans were in bedlam mode throughout the final three innings, and when the final out was recorded and the victory safe, they went crazy. Grown men and women wept. They fell to their knees on the steps of the grandstand and raised their arms to the sky. They kissed their seats. They kissed each other; even total strangers. They ran around with no particular place to go except into the arms of fellow Cubs fans. And they refused to start leaving the ballpark for at least 20 minutes, as they stood there jumping up and down and making the place shake as they sang their favorite anthem: “Go, Cubs, Go!” Over and over, they sang. The players ran into the clubhouse, sprayed champagne all over each other for a few minutes, then returned to the field to commune with their fans. They climbed atop both dugouts and danced about, slapping fives with the faithful. And after all these years, these decades, this century of futility, there are no more faithful fans in all of sport than diehard Cubs fans. “This is what it’s all about,” said rookie slugger Kyle Schwarber, who blasted another gigantic home run in the seventh inning. Circling the bases as the crowd roared and swayed and seemed to threaten Wrigley’s structural integrity, Schwarber was temporarily overwhelmed. “You run around the bases and the place is going nuts, and that’s when it hits you,” he said. “This is what you live to play baseball for, is to play in front of your home crowd in the playoffs.” When the players came out to join the fans in postgame partying, they were wearing black T-shirts with big, bold, red letters carrying a simple message: “CHICAGO WANTS IT MORE.” Who can possibly argue with that? Only a Division Series? For sure. But the elusive pennant could come in the next 10-12 days. And then the World Series, infamously uncrowned on the North Side since 1908. Page 2 of 3 - Yes, infamy might be about to take a permanent holiday. Proving themselves Only a fool would predict the future in a sport as crazy as baseball. But these Cubs are the real deal. Once they got rolling in the second half of the season, no team in baseball had a better record. And other than one hiccup, when they were shut out by the Cardinals in Game One of this series, they’ve been invincible in postseason. Certainly, they had an answer for everything the Cardinals did. The St. Louis team, which won 100 games during the regular season, scored first in all but one of the four games and had the lead in all four. But after Game 1, the Cubs struck back and doubled down. Monday night in Game Three, when Cubs ace pitcher Jake Arrieta faltered, the offense picked him up with a record six home runs by six different players. The Cardinals took a lead, the Cubs took it back, and then every time the Cardinals challenged, the Cubs held them off with more power. Tuesday saw more of the same. The Cardinals took a 2-0 lead in the first on a homer by Stephen Piscotty, but the Cubs responded in the second with four runs, including a three-run blast by reserve shortstop Javier Baez. The only reasons Baez was playing were that starting shortstop Addison Russell got hurt Monday night — and manager Joe Maddon had faith in him. Maddon was questioned about the decision before the game. After all, Baez was 0-for-8 in his career against Cardinals starter John Lackey. But Maddon had a hunch. “I asked him to own the game tonight, just own the game,” Maddon said. “I’ve seen him play winter ball in San Juan and saw how comfortable he was and how well he played, with that kind of confidence. My advice to him tonight was just to own the game. “And he kind of did.” The Cardinals were able to tie the score at 4 in the top of the sixth. But the Cubs came right back with an Anthony Rizzo homer in the bottom half of the inning, and it was obvious the Cardinals were simply not going to work their playoff magic this time. The Cardinals and Giants have owned the National League pennant, trading trips to the World Series the past four years. The Giants failed to make the postseason this time, and now the Cardinals have been bounced out of it. Somebody new is going to the Series from the National League. And the way everything else in the MLB postseason is shaping up, it looks like the World Series will be won by a franchise that hasn’t done it in a long time.
