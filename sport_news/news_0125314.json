DraftKings alone expects to pay out close to $2 billion in prizes this year. \nThe statement released by the companies says there is \"no evidence\" internal data at DraftKings or FanDuel was misused. \nBillion-dollar business \nDraftKings and FanDuel are the largest players in the fantasy sports industry behind three big names: ESPN, Yahoo and CBS. \nFanDuel was started in 2009, and DraftKings in 2012. They have achieved multi-billion dollar valuations from investors. \nEach firm recently raised about $300 million in financing, which they're using to blanket stadiums with ads. \nBetween them, the two companies have sponsorship deals with 28 of the 32 NFL teams, worth an estimated $6 million to $7 million to the teams, according to research firm IEG. \nSports leagues, team owners and media companies have invested in the growing fantasy sports business. \nFor example, Major League Baseball and the National Hockey League have equity stakes in DraftKings, and the National Basketball Association has equity in FanDuel. Time Warner, the parent company of CNN, has made an investment in FanDuel. \nAlthough the National Football League itself has not taken a stake in either company, a number of NFL and NBA team owners have invested in FanDuel. \nAnd DraftKings recently signed a deal with the NFL Players Association to use current players in broadcast, print, social media, digital and mobile ads. The NFLPA declined to comment Monday. \nLittle regulation \nFantasy sports has been criticized by some for getting close to the line of illegal sports gambling. Though federal law permits fantasy sports, some say it should be regulated. \nDraftKings and FanDuel say they're willing to work with competitors on self-policing. \n\"We also plan to work with the entire fantasy sports industry on this specific issue so that fans everywhere can continue to enjoy and trust the games they love,\" their statement said. \n--CNNMoney's Chris Isidore and CNN's Dave Alsup and Kevin Dotson contributed to this report. \nCopyright 2015 by CNN NewSource .
