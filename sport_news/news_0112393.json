(AP) -- Kentucky coach John Calipari says if any of an escort's allegations that a former Louisville men's basketball staff member hired strippers are true, \"it's not good for college basketball.\" \nCalipari added that he hopes the allegations \"aren't true\" and \"can't believe\" Cardinals coach Rick Pitino \"would know anything about it.\" \nCalipari said during the Wildcats' annual media day Wednesday that he hasn't reached out to his in-state counterpart and fellow Hall of Famer about allegations in Katina Powell's book, \"Breaking Cardinal Rules: Basketball and the Escort Queen.\" \nPowell alleges former Louisville staff member Andre McGee paid her and other dancers to strip and have sex with recruits and players. \nPitino has denied knowledge of the activities in the book. Four separate investigations have been launched to review the allegations. \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
