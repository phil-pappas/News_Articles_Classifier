At least not right now.\nMost punished the Seahawks for their fourth-quarter foibles by dropping them four or five spots in the rankings.\n“This isn’t funny anymore,” wrote Elliot Harrison of NFL.com, who dropped Seattle from No. 7 to No. 16. “That is to say, the Seahawks deserve the freefall here. We’ve held fast to the notion that the defense is still a top-three unit, while the offense would come around with Marshawn Lynch back in the fold. Couple that with the tremendous home-field advantage … ah, whatever — Seattle is getting flat beat right now, and there isn’t a damn fluky thing about it, regardless of what you can blame on miscommunication in the secondary.”\nMost Read Stories Pair split; now can she divorce nickname?

Most peg the Seahawks between Nos. 12 and 16. But Seattle is as high as No. 10 (Business Insider), and as low as No. 19 ( FOXSPORTS.COM ).\nMeanwhile, the San Francisco 49ers, Seattle’s next opponent on Thursday night, made one of the biggest jumps in the media rankings. FOXSPORTS.COM was the only ranking I saw that had the Seahawks ranked below the 49ers, though. It rated San Francisco at No. 18, one higher than Seattle.\nThe Panthers moved up after beating the Hawks. Carolina is No. 4 or 5 in most rankings, rounding out a consensus top five of the New England Patriots, Green Bay Packers, Cincinnati Bengals and the Denver Broncos.\nHere are this week’s NFL power rankings from the national media and major newspapers. We’ll update later in the week.\nESPN.COM \nSeahawks rank: No. 12 (down 4)\nSeahawks comment: The Seahawks have blown a fourth-quarter lead in all four of their losses this season. Their minus-28 point differential in the fourth is second worst in the NFL (Titans, minus-40).\n49ers rank: No. 19 (up 6)\n49ers comment: Since losing 17-3 to the Packers, the 49ers have averaged 26 points per game and committed zero turnovers. They’re 1-1 in those games, but at least the offense has improved.\nTop 5: 1, Patriots; 2, Packers; 3, Broncos; 4, Cardinals; 5, Bengals.\nNFL.COM \nSeahawks rank: No. 16 (down 9)\nSeahawks comment: This isn’t funny anymore. That is to say, the Seahawks deserve the freefall here. We’ve held fast to the notion that the defense is still a top-three unit, while the offense would come around with Marshawn Lynch back in the fold. Couple that with the tremendous home-field advantage … ah, whatever — Seattle is getting flat beat right now, and there isn’t a damn fluky thing about it, regardless of what you can blame on miscommunication in the secondary. That’s the game. The Seahawks can’t just roll the football out there, to use a Sean Payton expression, and expect to win.\n49ers rank: No. 23 (up 6)\n49ers comment: Direct some of your football love toward Colin Kaepernick , who threw for 340 yards and two touchdowns in the 49ers’ win over the Ravens . Two weeks since calmly telling reporters he doesn’t walk into the team facility worried about job security , Kap has provided back-to-back strong outings. That, my friends, is called walking the walk. Of import: two deep balls uncorked by No. 7. The first, a 76-yard scoring strike to Torrey Smith . That sucker was a beaut. And then the running heave to Anquan Boldin — which set up Quinton Patton’s fourth-quarter touchdown — was both lovely and the play of the game.\nTop 5: No. 1, Patriots; 2, Packers; 3, Bengals; 4, Panthers; 5, Broncos.\nSI.COM (Peter King)\n\nSeahawks rank: No. 14\nSeahawks comment: I keep think we’ll wake up one of these mornings, and the Seahawks will an have an offensive line that doesn’t look like it just got plucked out of the Patriot League.\n49ers rank: Not ranked in top 20\nTop 5: 1, Patriots; 2, Packers; 3, Bengals; 4, Panthers; 5, Jets.\nFOXSPORTS.COM \nSeahawks rank: No. 19 (down 6)\nSeahawks comment: The Seahawks defense is giving up big plays and their offense has lost its identity. This team can’t be counted out, but they don’t look like a title contender right now. \n49ers rank: No. 18 (up 6)\n49ers comment: When Colin Kaepernick has time in the pocket, he is delivering the ball accurately and with zip, while working in several different skill position players. The 49ers still need to find a way to stop the pass on defense. \nTop 5: No. 1, Patriots; 2, Bengals; 3, Packers; 4, Panthers; 5, Broncos.\nPRO FOOTBALL TALK (NBC.COM) \nSeahawks rank: No. 16 (down 5)\nSeahawks comment: The Legion of Boom is about to become the Legion of Booed.\n49ers rank: No. 26 (up 1)\n49ers comment: If you’d told 49ers fans before the season that the team would have the same record as the Seahawks heading into their Week Seven showdown, 49ers fans would have been very excited.\nTop 5: 1, Patriots; 2, Bengals; 3, Packers; 4, Panthers; 5, Broncos.\nCBSSPORTS.COM \nSeahawks rank: No. 14 (down 2)\nSeahawks comment: What has happened to that defense? It used to be a calling card. That unit is struggling.\n49ers rank: No. 22 (up 4)\n49ers comment: If Colin Kaepernick can play like he did against the Ravens, they can be a .500 team. They have a short week with a game against division rival Seattle Thursday night.\nTop 5: 1, Patriots; 2, Bengals; 3, Packers; 4, Broncos; 5, Panthers.\nCBSSPORTS.COM (Pat Kirwan) \nSeahawks rank: No. 18 (down 5)\nSeahawks comment: Three coordinators in three years, and some personnel issues can change a defense. While this team has leaned on the defense in recent years, the offense needs to run the ball and win the time of possession battle to help this unit out while it works through those issues.\n49ers rank: No. 23 down 6)\n49ers comment: I’m sure it felt good in that locker room to get the win, but the Niners escaped at home against a team decimated by injuries. Hopefully they can build on a few of the positives from this game.\nTop 5: 1, Patriots; 2, Bengals; 3, Panthers; 4, Packers; 5, Jets.\nYAHOO.COM \nSeahawks rank: No. 16 (down 3)\nSeahawks comment: I never thought this defense would become a poster child for blowing fourth quarter leads. Going back to last season’s Super Bowl, the Seahawks have blown a fourth-quarter lead and lost in five of their last seven games. It would have been six of seven if Calvin Johnson gained another foot or so. Unbelievable.\n49ers rank: No. 28 (up 2)\n49ers comment: I don’t know if it was Colin Kaepernick breaking a slump or the Ravens being awful, but Kaepernick had a nice game on Sunday. He gets Seattle next, which isn’t as intimidating as it has been in years past. Another positive game could get him going in a nice direction.\nTop 5: No. 1, Patriots; 2, Packers; 3, Bengals; 4, Broncos; 5, Panthers.\nUSA TODAY \nSeahawks rank: No. 13 (down 6)\nSeahawks comment: If we’re learning anything, it’s the danger of sacrificing depth to tie up so much money into the upper tier of a roster.\n49ers rank: No. 20 (up 10)\n49ers comment: Is Colin Kaepernick turning a corner? He hadn’t had consecutive games with 100-plus passer rating since the end of 2013.\nTop 5: No. 1, Patriots; 2, Packers; 3, Bengals; 4, Packers; 5, Broncos.\nMICHIGAN LIVE \nSeahawks rank: No. 16 (down 5)\nSeahawks comment: The Seahawks’ two wins came against a Bears team sans Cutler and Detroit, in a game they should have lost had the officials not blown a late call. This is not what you’d expect after two straight trips to the Super Bowl.\n49ers rank: No. 23 (up 3)\n49ers comment: Colin Kaepernick has stacked a pair of good performances on top of each other as he looks to get the 49ers on track.\nTop 5: No. 1, Patriots; 2, Bengals; 3, Packers; 4, Panthers; 5, Broncos.\nPRO FOOTBALL FOCUS \nSeahawks rank: No. 13\nSeahawks comment: On 42.6 percent of Marshawn Lynch’ carries, the first defender to contact him is not the man to tackle Lynch. That is the highest rate in the league.\n49ers rank: No. 28\n49ers comment: Carlos Hyde has run with the ball four times within 5 yards to go for a touchdown. One of those went for a touchdown, but the other three were for a loss, for a combined minus-12 yards.\nTop 5: 1, Packers; 2, Patriots; 3, Bengals; 4, Panthers; 5, Broncos.\nWASHINGTON POST \nSeahawks rank: No. 16 (down 3)\nSeahawks comment: Even the emergence of TE Jimmy Graham as a force in the offense didn’t stop the downward spiral. The defense can’t hold leads. The offensive line can’t keep QB Russell Wilson from having to improvise on practically every drop-back to pass. Will the Seahawks turn it around? For now, it’s fair to still consider that possible. But it won’t be early in the season for too much longer.\n49ers rank: No. 25 (up 6)\n49ers comment: The 49ers continued their anti-Harbaugh campaign Sunday by beating John and the Ravens, essentially ending any hopes of a turnaround this season by Baltimore.\nTop 5: 1, Patriots; 2, Packers; 3, Bengals; 4, Panthers; 5, Broncos.\nARIZONA REPUBLIC \nSeahawks rank: No. 18 (down 5)\nSeahawks comment: Yes, the two-time defending NFC champions really are 2-4 after six games. Yes, I would thoroughly expect them to beat the pants of the 49ers in San Francisco this Thursday night. Not that we need to see anybody going pants-less or anything, of course. \n49ers rank: No. 26 (down 5)\n49ers comment: No way. Colin Kaepernick passed for 340 yards and two touchdowns without an interception in a 25-20 victory over the Ravens? It’s true. Please tell me you have more of that in you, Kap, when you face your NFC West-rival Seahawks this Thursday night at home. \nTop 5: 1, Packers; 2, Patriots; 3, Bengals; 4, Panthers; 5, Broncos.\nNEWSDAY \nSeahawks rank: No. 11 (down 2)\nSeahawks comment: The Super Bowl hangover continues in Seattle, where the Seahawks continue to stumble months after their stunning loss to the Patriots in last season’s title game. Legion of Boom? It’s more like the Legion of Gloom as the Seahawks’ defense suffers a second straight second-half meltdown, this time at home against the Panthers.\n49ers rank: No. 19 (up 6)\n49ers comment: After a much-improved performance in a losing effort against the Giants the week before, the Niners put it all together against the Ravens and get back into the NFC West race.\nTop 5: 1, Patriots; 2, Packers; 3, Bengals; 4, Panthers; 5, Broncos.\nTAMPA TIMES \nSeahawks rank: No. 16\nSeahawks comment: Fourth-quarter defense has been woeful.\n49ers rank: No. 26\n49ers comment: Showed some rare resolve in beating the Ravens.\nTop 5: No. 1, Patriots; 2, Bengals; 3, Packers; 4, Broncos; 5, Panthers.\nBUSINESS INSIDER \nSeahawks rank: No. 10\nSeahawks comment: Week 6 MVP: Big offseason addition Jimmy Graham came through with his best game yet, with 140 yards on eight catches.\nOne thing to know: The Seahawks’ four losses have all come after they’ve been leading going into the fourth quarter. Closing games remains a problem for this team.\n49ers rank: No. 26\n49ers comment: Week 6 MVP: Colin Kaepernick had a career-high 225 passing yards in the first half, and helped snap San Francisco’s four-game losing streak.\nOne thing to know: The field at Levi’s Stadium played a big role in helping the 49ers win on Sunday.\nBLEACHER REPORT \nSeahawks rank: No. 14 (down 2)\nSeahawks comment: When Seattle Seahawks safety Kam Chancellor was missing games during his contract holdout, it seemed like a pretty logical assumption that upon his return the Legion of Boom would start hammering opposing tight ends again.\nThat assumption felt so safe I cited it as a reason why the Seahawks should take a big gulp, swallow some pride and get Chancellor back on the field promptly.\nThe Seahawks’ secondary is no doubt much better with Chancellor than without him. But they’re continually getting roasted by tight ends, showing there’s a deep-rooted problem even Chancellor can’t fix.\nThe Bengals’ Tyler Eifert and the Panthers’ Greg Olsen have now combined for 221 receiving yards and three touchdowns against Seattle over the past two weeks. Worse, Olsen beat coverage deep Sunday for a game-winning 26-yard TD.\nSuddenly the Seahawks defense is looking vulnerable, and a team that lost only four games in 2014 has already equaled that number six weeks into 2015.\n49ers rank: No. 27 (up 4)\n49ers comment: If the San Francisco 49ers passing offense we saw Sunday shows up even sporadically, their season could turn around fast.\nThat won’t happen, but it’s nice to think about because the NFL has a much-better product when 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick is launching balls deep downfield. He connected on three 50-plus yard passes during a win over the Baltimore Ravens and incredibly averaged 12.6 yards per attempt.\nTop 5: 1, Patriots; 2, Bengals; 3, Broncos; 4, Panthers; 5, Broncos.\nSB NATION \nSeahawks rank: No. 18 (down 3)\nSeahawks comment: They (Seahawks) blew yet another fourth-quarter lead, fell on their face when they needed to give their best punch and dropped to 2-4 on the year. They don’t look like the Seahawks of the past three years yet and are in real danger of a lost season. There’s time to right the ship, but there’s an awful lot to address in a short amount of time.\n49ers rank: No. 20 (up 8)\n49ers comment: The Niners look rejuvenated after beating the Ravens at home, and head into a Thursday Night Football matchup against the hated Seahawks this week with renewed confidence. Colin Kaepernick has passed for 602 yards at 9.7 yards per attempt with four touchdowns and no picks in his last two games. If Kaepernick can continue to thrive, he’ll have a chance to send the Seahawks to the NFC West cellar.\nTop 5: No. 1, Patriots; 2, Bengals; 3, Packers; 4, Panthers; 5, Broncos.\nDon Shelton : 206-464-8284 or dshelton@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @STdonshelton .
