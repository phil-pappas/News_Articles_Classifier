From the horrendous grammar, spelling, and lack of punctuation, to the actual message he attempted to convey (from what I could decipher, anyway).

What a complete moron, the more the Loserville fans, parents, and players talk, the dumber they sound. Maybe they need to teach and English 101 class at lville for students and parents.
