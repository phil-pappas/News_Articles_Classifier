Then Matthew Wyman missed a 34-yard try just as the first-half clock expired, allowing Texas Tech (5-2, 2-2) to enter the break with a 20-0 lead. Wyman had also missed a 52-yard field goal early in the first quarter. \nWhat’s more, Wyman actually missed an extra point in the third quarter after KU finally got on the scoreboard with a 10-yard Darious Crawley touchdown from Willis.

The drive covered 80 yards in nine plays and 1:18. (Texas Tech 20, KU 0). \nThird Quarter \n5:39 — Darious Crawley 10 pass from Ryan Willis. Kick failed. KU's freshman quarterback completed all six of his pass attempts on the drive and Ke'aun Kinner handled all of the carries as the Jayhawks drove 69 yards in 11 plays and 4:30 to get on the scoreboard. Both Crawley and Jeremiah Booker hauled in two catches on the drive. (Texas Tech 20, KU 6). \n1:17 — Hatfield 25 field goal. Texas Tech answered KU's first score of the day with a 14-play, 68-yard drive that ate 4:22 off the clock and pushed the Red Raiders' lead back to three scores.

Nick Bartolotta kick. The Jayhawks pulled to within 10 points early in the fourth when Derrick Neal forced a fumble that Fish Smithson took all the way back for a touchdown on yet another defensive stand by Kansas.

(Texas Tech 23, KU 13). \n6:26 — Taylor Cox 1 run. Bartolotta kick. After another big stop by the Kansas defense, the Jayhawks marched 45 yards in nine plays and 2:56 to pull to within three points. Ke'aun Kinner ran three times for 14 yards and De'Andre Mann ran once for 17. Willis and Cox handled the rest, with the QB hooking up with Crawley and Parmalee to set the stage for Cox to plow into the end zone on two carries from four yards out. (Texas Tech 23, KU 20). \n4:07 — Jah'Shawn Johnson 27 interception return. Hatfield kick. After a wild play in which Willis fumbled in the end zone and watched two Red Raiders fight over the loose ball, allowing De'Andre Mann to scoop it up and save the day for Kansas, the freshman QB tossed an interception by telegraphing a pas to Booker that was returned for a touchdown that put the game out of reach.
