Eleven Republicans led by Chris Gibson, NY, submitted a House Resolution calling for Congress to act on climate. Polls show a majority of even conservative Republicans now favor growing clean energy “so that America can lead on addressing global environmental issues.” But they want to do so without expanding government and regulations. A gradually increasing revenue-neutral carbon tax could fill the bill. It is much cheaper to implement than regulations. An independent study confirms that if proceeds are returned to the public, it will actually improve the economy; creating 2.8 million jobs. And if we do nothing? Citigroup predicts the cost of inaction will be 44 trillion dollars. The Gibson resolution could be the tipping point that snowballs into action on climate change.
