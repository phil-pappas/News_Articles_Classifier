Then he couldn’t help himself. The time when the former Baltimore Ravens defensive line coach brought his father, Buddy, to a practice and gave him grief for pointing out that Peter Boulware was a good player. \nOr that, no matter the shot, Rex would never lose his golf ball. \n“That’s a classic – I’m a terrible player,” Ryan said. “I heard he’s pretty decent now in golf. Back in the day we were both horrible but we were a tough team to beat because we had a tendency to find my ball about 300 yards away from the tee box.” \nThey were relatively tame stories, especially by Ryan standards, but then again Lewis doesn’t possess the same kind of public-facing personality that his former position coach has. \n“We handle some situations a little differently,” Lewis said with a laugh. “Unfortunately, sometimes people take some of the things he does or says the wrong way. He’s a good person. And he’s a fun person. And he’s an excellent coach. He does a great job getting the guys to play hard for him and do the things he wants them to do. That part of it, he’s so genuine, which is cool.” Marvin Lewis’ long-term game plan for football and life \nLewis and Ryan worked together from 1999 through 2001 in Baltimore, with Lewis as the defensive coordinator and Ryan as the defensive line coach. Since going their separate ways, the pair have stood on opposite sidelines as head coaches four times – all when Ryan was the head coach of the New York Jets – and Lewis has been on losing the side three times. \nThis includes the 2009 AFC playoffs, in which the Jets beat the AFC North champion 24-14 at Paul Brown Stadium. \n“We just have a lot of fun,” Lewis said. “It was fun times. He did a tremendous job as a coach and has been a good, close friend. I enjoy seeing him when we get together.” \nAnd Lewis said that he enjoys watching Ryan’s defenses, largely because the base concepts are the same as they ran in Baltimore – but that Ryan has taken that to a new level in the way he gets after the quarterback. \nFor his part, Ryan said he has maintained some of the principles Lewis imparted back then and tried to pass them on to his staffs as a head coach. \n“He allowed you to coach,” Ryan said. “No matter how different your style might have been than his or whatever, he made it that every coach under him felt you were a major contributor. I think that’s a great thing. That’s what I’ve always tried to do since my time with Marvin.” \nDalton foundation receives grant \nThe UPS Foundation awarded a $10,000 grant to the Andy & Jordan Dalton Foundation , which the Bengals quarterback and his wife started to help the families of seriously ill and physically challenged children. According to the foundation, the grant will help expand the impact of events such as Andy & Jordan’s Hub, Date Night , King for a Day, Holiday Hearts and the Pass It On Fund. \nNugent wins honor \nOh, how the NFL cycle spins. Almost as fast the Earth’s rotation. \nOne week after Mike Nugent said his coaching staff showed patience as he worked through two field goal misses in his first five attempts he walks away with the honor of AFC special teams player of the week. \nNugent hit two field goals, one to force overtime at the end of regulation and another that hit the left upright and bounced through to beat the Seattle Seahawks. \nThe special teams player of the week award is Nugent’s second as a Bengal. He was named previously in Week 2 of 2010, when his five field goals provided all of Cincinnati’s points in 15-10 win over Baltimore. \nThe most recent Bengal to win the AFC special teams award was punter Kevin Huber, who averaged 55.5 yards on four punts in a 2013 win at San Diego (Week 13). \nInjury report \nThe Bengals continue to stay relatively healthy as Week 6 of the season begins. Only four players did not participate in the first practice of the week. \nAndrew Whitworth took a veteran’s day off and wide receiver Brandon Tate battled an illness. Adam Jones sat out for the third straight Wednesday with a groin injury and Leon Hall surfaced with a back injury. Hall’s injury is the most serious of the four, he was pulled out of Sunday’s game due to the ailment. \nElsewhere, WR Marvin Jones (foot), CB Dre Kirkpatrick (hip), OL Andre Smith (elbow) and OL Kevin Zeitler (elbow) practiced, but were limited. \nBills QB undecided \nReports surfaced early this week that Buffalo QB Tyrod Taylor would miss several weeks with an MCL spain, including Sunday’s meeting with the Bengals. Buffalo coach Rex Ryan doesn’t know where those reports come from but said Taylor still has a shot to play this weekend. \nBackup E.J. Manuel took the majority of snaps at Wednesday’s practice, but Ryan wouldn’t pronounce him the starter. \nAs for if that matters to Marvin Lewis, he balked at there being a major difference. \n\"It's Manuel's first year in a new offense, both of them really,” Lewis said. “A little bit of change from what they were doing. E.J. ran some of the same things in the past in Buffalo; at Florida State. I don't think it will be a huge change. Obviously Tyrod Taylor's foot speed is a little bit of a difference. Both are good athletes. E.J. is a big guy, a big man, stands tall in that pocket, steps up into that pocket a lot, so we have to do a great job of squeezing this pocket down around him.\" 31 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN 1 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://cin.ci/1LutC1b TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T21:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T06:56:25.766+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
