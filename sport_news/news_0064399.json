For now, this was a satisfying enough appetizer. \nBurr and Burton outlasted Bellows Falls Saturday night at Applejack Field, putting up just enough points before digging in for a 19-14 win. \nOn a night where the high-flying Bulldog offense couldn't quite get going for stretches, it was the play of the defense that helped BBA (8-0) gut out a win over a worthy Terrier (7-1) team. \n\"I'm very proud of our defense,\" BBA coach Jason Thomas said. \"They really stepped up. Our offense wasn't getting it done, and that's not usual for us.\" \nWhile quarterback Griff Stalcup still managed to go for 300 yards passing on 18 of 27 passing, him and his offense had to shake off early fumbles and rely on the defense to hold strong. \nBBA lost a fumble on its opening possession, then punted on its second. When the Terriers got the ball back, they initially went three-and-out and went to punt. Only, in a strange twist befitting BBA's slow start, the Bulldogs blocked the punt only to have it bounce off a player down the field, allowing Bellows Falls to recover. \nThe defense, though, showed up big after that. Bellows Falls drove the ball after the recovery down to within a foot of scoring. That final foot, though, proved evasive. Advertisement \nBBA stuffed Zac Streeter runs on third and fourth down to force a turnover. The Terriers appealed after the third-down play that Streeter crossed, but Lockerby chalked the decision up as one that happens in a game. \n\"Yeah, and I said, I'm not going to cry sour grapes on that,\" Lockerby said. \"I'm not so sure we weren't in. I don't know. It seemed like Streeter felt he was across the line.\" \nBBA's offense still didn't quite click, though, after the turnover. The team managed to get away from its end zone, but fumbled the ball away again through Stalcup, allowing Sawyer Reis to hop on the ball. \nThe turnover bug wasn't done hitting the game, though, as Carter Vickers intercepted Streeter (6 of 13, 135 yards) at BBA's three-yard line. During the drive, Stalcup went down with a knee injury while playing safety. When he came back onto the field, things finally changed. \nThe junior took a third-and-eight play at his own 19 and turned it into a touchdown pass to Jay McCoy (6 receptions, 201 yards) to make it 6-0 with 2:50 to go in the half. The score stayed that way through the break, as Bellows Falls turned it over on the fourth down and BBA then fumbled the ball away on a halfback pass. \nThe next score didn't come until the fourth quarter. That last period, though, was a roller coaster. \nOn BBA's first play of the fourth, Stalcup stepped up again and hit McCoy on a long seam rout down the right – this one for 46 yards – then capped the drive with an eight-yard screen pass to Vickers. After a failed two-point try, BBA led 12-0. \n\"What we did was, we said we'll go short, short, short and once they are looking at the short pass, we are going to go long on them,\" Stalcup said of his big passes to McCoy. \"They bit, Jay was wide open.\" \nBellows Falls answered with its first touchdown. The big play on the drive was a Streeter pass of 43 yards to Chris McKeen that put Bellows Falls inside the 10, and Jahyde Bullard capped the drive off from a yard out to make it 12-7 after the extra point. \nWith both offenses finally flowing, BBA answered Bellows Falls' touchdown with another. Stalcup again led the drive, and hit McCoy on a 43-yard score. \n\"That kid is a war daddy,\" Thomas said of his gunslinger. It changes the offense when he can't run the ball, but he made enough plays with his arm to get us in the end zone enough.\" \nThe scoring still wasn't over, though, as Bellows Falls made things interesting with 1:03 to go when Streeter capped off a touchdown drive from a yard out. \nThe pressure was finally relieved on the kickoff as Bellows Falls failed to convert the onside kick to regain possession. \nRay Gormley led BBA on the ground with 65 yards on eight carries. BBA struggled to get the run game (95 yards) going as consistently as it would have liked, but for Thomas it all went back to his defense on the night. \n\"I was really proud of the way the defense stepped up, and we made enough plays on offense to get enough points to win the game.\" \nBullard led the Terriers with 91 yards on the ground. Both teams now enter the final week of the regular season. BBA travels to Pembroke Academy in New Hampshire on Saturday, while Bellows Falls hosts Fair Haven on Friday night. BBA is guaranteed the top spot in Division II now, but Thomas was quick to put that aside. \n\"I don't care about seeding, I don't care about when we play, where we play, who we play, I just want to make sure we take care of Pembroke Academy next week.\" \nLockerby left Manchester proud of his team despite the loss, and while he too acknowledged that there is a long road ahead before the D-II title game, he wouldn't mind seeing a rematch. \n\"We just wanted to get a little respect, and I'm proud of those guys,\" Lockerby said. \"We're looking forward to playing them again – I hope it all works out and we get to play one more time.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T08:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:04:10.595+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
