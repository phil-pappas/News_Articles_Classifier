Utah received 16 first-place votes — the most by a Utah team in the regular season and tied for the most in school history following the 2008 Sugar Bowl run. \nUtah State (3-2, 2-0 MWC) continues to impress after it went on the road and put up 56 points at Fresno State. It was a season high for the Aggies and the most points scored on the road by USU since a 63-17 win at Idaho in 1997. The win snapped a six-game losing streak to the Bulldogs. BYU (4-2) won its second consecutive game for the second time this season with another last-second victory in a 45-38 win over East Carolina at home. The Cougars nearly blew a 38-21 lead late in the third quarter when freshman sensation Tanner Mangum left the game with an injury. But with the game tied, Mangum came back into the game to lead BYU to another last-second game-winning drive. With another set of big weekend games this week, here is all the information you need for the upcoming in-state games. \nUtah running back Devontae Booker (23) looks on after carrying the ball in the first half during an NCAA college football game against California Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015, in Salt Lake City.

Booker might need another outing just like that again if the Utes passing attack can’t get going. \nArizona State (4-2, 1-1) is in town this week and looks to extend its winning streak against the Utes to 12 following last year’s overtime victory. Saturday’s game will certainly be a big one as a Sun Devil loss will likely take them out of contention for the Pac-12 South title. A win for the Utes will put them squarely in the driver’s seat with at least a two-game cushion over ASU, USC and Arizona. Winning the turnover has been key to the success this season as the Utes rank second in the nation at +10 overall. Utah already has 17 takeaways this year, including forcing six turnovers by the Bears last week. \nTurnover margin has always correlated to high levels of success over the years in college football and if the Utes can keep it up, they should be sitting pretty come Saturday night. \nUtah State's Kent Myers pitches back past Fresno State's Tyquwan Glass for a touchdown during the first half of an NCAA college football game in Fresno, Calif., Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015.

The last time Utah State lost a home game was back in 2013 against Boise State. \nIronically enough, the Aggies are welcoming the Broncos to town this week in a pivotal Mountain West showdown. Friday’s winner will undoubtedly have the inside track in the Mountain division to play in the MWC championship game on Dec. 5. \nBoise State comes in on a four-game winning streak and has outscored its opponents 204-24 for an average margin of victory of more than 45 points. \nBut the Aggie defense should be up to the challenge as they rank in the Top 25 in several defensive categories. \nBroncos freshman quarterback Brett Rypien has played terrific so far this season – posting the fifth-best passer rating (175.9) in the nation to go along with seven touchdowns and one interception – but will face his toughest test of the season against a physical Aggie defense. \nBYU's Terenn Houk (11), Algernon Brown (24) and other players celebrate after Brown ran the ball in for the game-winning touchdown during the second half in an NCAA college football game against East Carolina, Saturday, Oct. 10, 2015 in Provo, Utah. BYU won 45-38.

Like Mangum, the freshman was thrown into the fire and came out a bit charred. In his debut, Hoge completed just one pass and had an interception to go along with multiple three-and-outs. \nFortunately for the BYU offense, Cincinnati is just what the doctor ordered. The Bearcats, just like the Cougars, are giving up nearly 400 yards of offense to opponents this year. If both defenses don't make any adjustments, fans should be ready for a good old-fashioned shootout. \nLike ECU, Cincinnati has two solid quarterbacks who will likely get playing time on Friday. Junior quarterback Gunner Kiel is returning from an injury, and freshman Hayden Moore has picked up right where he left off. Both quarterbacks are very similar who both like to throw the football. \nIf BYU can get pressure early on the quarterback by rushing just four or five players, the Cougars should cover the spread and remain undefeated at home in ESPN’s prime-time game. \nFollow Justin Giles on Twitter @Justingiles22 or on Facebook at www.facebook.com/JustinGilesSportsWriter \nRelated Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T02:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T04:17:13.354+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
