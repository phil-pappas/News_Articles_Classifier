But he should have. Because he was. Badly.\nYes, Giants fans, it looks like your team is not in such incompetent hands after all.\nIt looks like the calamity that ensued the first two weeks of the season, with the clock-management gaffes and miscommunication in Dallas and the soft endgame defense against Atlanta, were aberrations. It looks like your 69-year-old head coach is not ready to retire to the rocker on the front porch just yet.\nSure, the Giants were the first team in NFL history to blow double-digit fourth-quarter leads to lose their first two games. Sure, it looked bad. But the seasoned head coach never flinched.\nInstead of hammering his players with negative reinforcement at 0-2, Coughlin kept them positive in the face of the negativity surrounding the poor start, reminding them about the good things they were doing and pointing out the “little things’’ that were keeping them from winning.\nCall it Coughlin’s version of the old “Saturday Night Live’’ skit: “Daily Affirmations with Stuart Smalley.” But with an edge.\n“I would say he’s come in with more energy, more enthusiasm,’’ linebacker Jon Beason said Monday. “The guy is 69 years old and he’s doing jumping jacks in the meetings. It’s a joy to see how much he loves to do what he does and how much of a competitor he is. It’s easy to go out and fight for a guy like that.’’\nSaid Coughlin: “Whether the energy level came up from whatever level it was, I don’t know about that, but I do know that it put some fire in our belly to be 0-2. I didn’t think we were an 0-2 team and we needed to do something about it.\n“We tried to inspire our guys to believe in themselves and come together as a team, to play the four quarters and forget about the score … and don’t let any of the circumstances get into your head.’’\nAs much as his game plan worked Sunday, Coughlin’s psychological tactics leading up to the last two games might have been even craftier.\n“At 0-2, the way we lost, I don’t think guys really felt like they lost … so we feel like we should be 4-0,’’ cornerback Prince Amukamara said.\nWell, the Giants are what their record says they are — 2-2 — and nothing is going to take away those losses to Dallas and Atlanta. But, Amukamara’s point is understandable in that the Giants are not the bumbling operation many made them out to be after those two losses.\nAnd Coughlin remains the same excellent tactician and motivator he’s always been — even if his age (he’s the oldest coach in the NFL) begs you to believe he’s lost a step or three.\nThis is what I saw Sunday:\n Coughlin’s Giants were sharper and appeared more intense and ready to play at the beginning of the game than Ryan’s Bills.  Coughlin’s Giants were, by far, the more disciplined team. The Bills had two touchdowns called back because of penalties — two of the 17 they were called for in the game, and they lost their composure in the end. The Giants’ offensive plan, using the no-huddle for the entire game, kept Ryan’s defense off-balance and prevented him from making the situational substitutions he likes to make. While some teams — even the Patriots — enter the game fearing they cannot run against the Bills’ talented defensive front, Coughlin and his offensive staff never wavered from their plan to run the ball on Buffalo, and so they did. Coughlin and his defensive staff confused Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor, a first-year starter, with looks that rendered him tentative in the first half, during which he threw for only 36 yards.\nAll of these things lead to this conclusion: Coughlin’s still got it.   buffalo bills ,  new york giants ,  rex ryan ,  tom coughlin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T11:09:35.535+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
