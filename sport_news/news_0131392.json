Whatever happens, we are going to fight and stay united. Whatever happens.\" \nIt could be a good weekend for Barca if they can beat Sevilla and arch rivals Real Madrid fail to win at city neighbours Atletico on Sunday. \nWith six matches played, Villarreal, who play at Levante on Sunday, are the surprise leaders on 16 points, with Barca second on 15 and Real and Celta Vigo level on 14 points in third and fourth respectively. Atletico, the 2014 champions, are fifth on 12 points. \n\"It's always interesting when direct rivals play each other but the only important thing for us is to win in Seville,\" Luis Enrique said. \nAfter this weekend's action, there is a two-week break for internationals before Barca host Rayo Vallecano on Oct. 17. \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
