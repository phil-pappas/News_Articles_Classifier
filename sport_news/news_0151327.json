In fact, had Rachel stuck with her original commitment to play soccer at USC, the sisters already had a plan. \n\"We were like, okay at half time we're going to give each other shirts,\" said older sister and Wildcat senior midfielder Hayley. \"I'll give you an Arizona shirt. You're going to give me a USC shirt.\" She pauses. \"But, I mean, it's better that it worked out this way.\" \nSure is. One could argue that with out Hayley and younger sister/red shirt freshman goalie Rachel, Arizona wouldn't be where they are now. Namely ranked 17th in the nation. \nTo date, Hayley has played in all 9 games. She has three goals to her name second behind only Gabi Stoian. Meanwhile Rachel has split time in the goal with the other freshman star Lainey Burdett. In 5 games, Rachel has made 8 saves including 2 shutouts. But their relationship isn't defined by their soccer success. It's defined by their closeness. After all, the Estopare sisters admit they're close to inseparable. \n\"For the past 20 years we've living together,\" said Hayley. \"We've always been together. We actually have bunk beds.\" \nBunk beds? As in, you still sleep in the same room? \n\"Oh yeah. Because we're pretty much best friends.\" \nAnd best teammates. They've been playing together since their club days. They led the Summit High School Storm for two seasons in Bend, Oregon. The same year Rachel made the team as a freshman goal keeper, Hayley won 5A player of the year honors. By the time Rachel was a senior, she too had earned all-state accolades while helping to lead the team to back to back state championships. When Rachel backed out of her commitment to the Trojans (a decision she called a personal change), it only made sense to go back to familiar territory even if she says Hayley didn't ultimately play a role in her coming to Arizona. \n\"I had USC in mind,\" said Rachel. \"I was never like 'Oh where Hayley's going, I want to.' I always knew what Arizona was about because of Hayley but she was never that big of a factor in it?\" \nIf not Hayley, then what? \n\"I really liked how (Wildcat goal keeper coach ) Paul Nagy coaches and (head coach) Tony Amato's aspect of the game.\" \nBut having Hayley here didn't hurt. \n\"I was so happy,\" said the elder Estopare. \"I was actually really sad after high school because I was like 'We're not going to play with each other', but now we finally do get to play again.\" \nWhile they might be sisters, head coach Tony Amato says each handles her business in a different manner. \n\"One's a grinder, a header and one's a goal keeper. Right there will say enough.\" \n\"She's quieter than I am,\" said Rachel. \"If she gets angry it's kind of under the table.\" \nBut... \n\"She's kind of the same as me,\" said Hayley. \"She's not going to let anybody see it if she gets mad. She'll keep it down low and won't spread it to the team.\" \n\"They both push each other to work very hard,\" said Amato. \"Hayley Estopare has set the tone for our work rate for the last few years. Her sister came in and this year got the highest level we've seen a goal keeper get on our fitness test. We give their parents a lot of credit.\" \nSpeaking of which... \n\"Our parents love it,\" said Rachel. \"They're like, 'We only have to go to one game. We don't have to focus on splitting colleges or anything.'\" \nThank goodness for that. \n#17 Arizona hosts #23 Cal Friday at 7:00pm.
