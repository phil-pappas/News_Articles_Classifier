This comes 20 years after another monkey hung out in the Cowboys locker room.\nLiterally.\nOronde Gadsden played for the Cowboys for just one season in 1995. But his pet monkey, Malik, was often seen at the club's Valley Ranch facility wearing a diaper and waving a bottle.\n\"He would sit on Oronde's shoulder with his tail wrapped around his neck,'' remembers Nate Newton, a Pro Bowl left guard on that team. \"He was really well behaved. It's not like he would be running around the locker room and stuff.\n\"A lot of the guys really liked him.''\nNot all of them did. Malik would hang from the side of Gadsden's stall, located at the walkway from the dining room to the locker room, and would startle players as they walked to their lockers.\nNewton was one of the players that never warmed to Malik.\n\"He asked me once if I wanted to hold his monkey,'' Newton said of Gadsden. \"I didn't want any part of that.''\nIt's unclear if Dallas Bryant has made an appearance in the Cowboys locker room. But one of the songs played during Thursday's practice was \"Shake Me Like A Monkey'' by the Dave Matthews Band.\nLatest Cowboys analysis\nSherrington: Kool-Aid drinker Jerry Jones hasn't learned important football lesson\nBob Sturm: Examining the 2016 NFL draft from the Cowboys' perspective\nSabin: Dez not being counted out, but several factors make return vs. NYG unlikely for Cowboys star WR\nLaufenberg: Is Michael the answer?
