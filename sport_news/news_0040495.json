Becher, 87, received the Victory Medal for his service in World War II. By Kevin Haskin kevin.haskin@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. — The decorated war veteran who threw out the first pitch Friday to begin the American League Championship Series wanted to convey one message before his delivery. \n“Be sure and warn (Salvador) Perez I might throw him a spitball,” cautioned Tom Becher of Topeka. \nBecher was understandably anxious about his appearance, which actually included Drew Butera as the catcher representing the Kansas City Royals before Game 1 of their series against the Toronto Blue Jays. \n“I hope I’ll be able to throw it four feet,” Becher said. \nHe did fine before the sellout throng in Kauffman Stadium, especially for never playing organized baseball. \n“My brothers were all really good,” Becher said. “I worked in the mill after school and could not participate. I did, I guess, in the service, but it was really just part of the calisthenics we did each day.” \nBecher, 87, is a retired Command Sgt., Ranger Division, who was sent to Japan two months after joining the service in 1946 as part of an occupation force. He received the World War II Victory Medal. \nBecher then served in the Korean War, and was awarded the Purple Heart after he was hit with shrapnel in his chest following a grenade explosion. Becher was part of the 187th Airborne Infantry Regiment. \nAt each home game, the Royals show a video segment, Honoring Our Heroes. \nIn the case of Becher, he also got to throw out the first pitch after his daughter, Judy Lykins, joined her husband, Dan, in relaying the story of Becher’s distinguished military record to Royals officials. \n“Dan has taken me to several games already. Other than that, I watch them on TV,” Becher said. “I remember in 1985. Dan and my daughter called me from the stadium during the World Series and said, ‘Wish you were here.’ I said, ‘Me too.’” \nThe impression Becher has formed while following the Royals as they attempt to repeat as AL champs is favorable. \n“You know, I think (Ned) Yost is like other coaches who have been so successful around here,” Becher said. “He knows how to put the right people in spots, just like Bill Snyder and Bill Self, and that makes them good leaders.” \nKevin Haskin can be reached at (785) 295-1159 or kevin.haskin@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T10:37:58.036+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
