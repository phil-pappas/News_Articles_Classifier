The Centre has already finalised a mega package more than the Bihar package of Rs 1.25 lakh crore as a show of its concern and magnanimity towards Jammu and Kashmir despite the fact that accounts have not been made available by the state government on how the money was spent. Sources said the Prime Minister had been more than magnanimous in approving a big package for the state. He was expected to announce the package soon after the Bihar elections. The sources said Mufti would highlight the plight of flood victims of the Valley during the meeting and how non-payment of humanitarian aid in full had created a vacuum. He would call for reclaiming of political space. The Chief Minister might discuss the beef controversy, in which PDP had taken a stand against the beef ban stand and made Deputy Chief Minister Nirmal Singh apologise in the Assembly for a clash between members in the House. The sources said the Chief Minister would lay stress on seeking more money from the Centre to show results on governance.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T15:12:40.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
