Kung lalamang kami sana dire-diretso na,” said Dela Cruz who may have vengeance in his mind against NU. \n“Sila yung talo namin na isa; gagawin lang namin i-correct yung mistakes namin against them and we will prepare.” One guy who was hurt deeply by that loss was UST center Karim Abdul. \nAbdul got thoroughly outplayed by his foreign counterpart in Alfred Aroga in the fourth period. This included the go-ahead fade-away jumper byt Aroga as the Bulldogs scored their first victory in the tournament. \n“That shot hurt me so much. I’m gonna make sure he doesn’t do that again. I’m gonna correct my mistakes and I’m gonna get myself ready this week,” Abdul said. \nIn the first game, Ateneo looks to keep hold of the fourth spot as it takes on league-doormat Adamson. \nThis will be the first game of Ateneo after Blue Eagles coach Bo Perasol publicly stated that he won’t be returning next year – regardless of what happens. \nBoth teams are coming off losses: the Eagles against Far Eastern U, 66-61, and Adamson against UP, 89-84.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:08:46.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
