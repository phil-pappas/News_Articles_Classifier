So who is No. 1 as we head into the postseason? \nThe flip-flop at the top continues, with Essex jumping over the Rebels. It was hard to pick 1-5 this week — and the last few weeks — because the top teams are just so, so close. \nSo, who you do you think should be in the top 10? Does it look the same as mine? \nThis week's rankings (through Oct. 18): \n1. Essex (9-2-3): The defending D-I champs will finish the regular season in the same place as last year: At the top. But the road to another title will be much tougher this season. Last week: 2 \n2. South Burlington (10-3-1): South Burlington didn't finish exactly the way they wanted with two losses. But, unofficially, the Rebels will enter the postseason as the top seed in the D-I playoffs. Last week: 2 \n3. Mount Mansfield (9-4-1): MMU won three games to wrap up the season, including a 1-0 win over Essex. That makes the Cougars a serious contender. Last week: 5 \n4. Rice (12-2): The Green Knights lost twice in the first four games and haven't lost since, including a statement victory over U-32 last week . Last week: 3 \n5. Champlain Valley (9-3-2): The Redhawks had a dominating performance to end the regular season, downing South Burlington 2-0. It was the eighth shutout of the season for CVU. Last week : 6 \n6. U-32 (13-1): U-32 lost only once this season — an 8-2 loss to Rice — and are the favorites heading into the D-II playoffs. Last week: 4 \n7. Stowe (11-3): Three straight shutouts to end the season have the Raiders looking like they are in their usual postseason form. Last week: 8 \n8. Otter Valley (9-2-3): The Otters drop a spot this week because of a loss in the final game of the regular season. But all of the losses and ties Otter Valley have suffered this season have come to D-I teams, save one: Bellows Falls. Last week: 7 \n9. Bellows Falls (10-2-2): The Terriers will be the top seed and the team to beat in D-III. Can they make it back to UVM this season? Last week: 10 \n10. Burr and Burton (8-3-2): The Bulldogs make an appearance in the last week courtesy of a six-game winning streak. Last week: Unranked \nOn the bubble: Hartford (6-4-4); Rutland (6-6-2); Mount Abraham (4-6-4) TOP PERFORMERS \nAbby Ladd, Colchester: The goalie made 12 saves to help the Lakers win their first game of the season, a 2-0 triumph over Burlington in the final game of the regular season. \nJasmine Moody, U-32 : The forward scored five goals in U-32's last two wins, supplying the offensive power for the 13-1 Raiders. \nThis story was originally published Oct. 18, 2015.
