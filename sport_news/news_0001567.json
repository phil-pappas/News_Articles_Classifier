Updated October 15, 2015 10:22AM SHARE Tech News The new mobile Mail app from Yahoo not only lets users integrate their inboxes with other e-mail services but also gives them the option of eliminating the use of passwords to sign in. The company is offering an alternative method via Yahoo Account Key, which lets users tap a yes-or-no visual interface on their smartphones to log in to Mail. \nLaunched in a month that marks Yahoo's 18th birthday, the new Mail app is also designed to be faster, more search-savvy and visually appealing. Rather than saddling profile-image-free users with bland pictures or a generic gray person icon, for instance, the app offers users a choice of \"gorgeous\" Flickr images depicting their initials. \nThe new mobile Mail app is available today in iOS or Android via the Apple App Store or Google Play. Desktop support for integrated inboxes is also available today for users in the U.S., and will roll out soon for users elsewhere, Yahoo said. \n'More Secure than a Traditional Password' \nYahoo's latest move to help users avoid the need for passwords builds on a service it launched in March, which lets users request access via one-time, on-demand passwords sent via SMS to their smartphones. \n\"It was the first step toward a password-free future,\" vice president of product management Dylan Casey said in a blog post today. The new Yahoo Account Key takes another step in that direction, he added. \nUsers who activate the Yahoo Account Key option will receive a push notification on their smartphones that asks, \"Are you trying to sign in?\" with the choice of tapping either a \"yes\" or \"no\" button. With a tap of \"yes,\" users are immediately taken to their Yahoo Mail inboxes. \nNot only does Yahoo Account Key eliminate the need to remember an e-mail password or worry about password security -- it also provides greater security, Casey said. \n\"It's also more secure than a traditional password because once you activate Account Key -- even if someone gets access to your account info -- they can't sign in,\" he said, adding that Yahoo also plans to roll out the Account Key option for other mobile apps later this year. \nPowered by Behind-the-Scenes Tech Investment \nYahoo's \"fully redesigned\" Mail app also features a variety of improvements in design and usability, according to senior vice president of communication products Jeffrey Bonforte. Beyond giving the app a new look, \"we've made a significant investment in the technology that powers the app, so it's fast and responsive,\" he said. \nOther look-and-feel changes include contact cards that enable users to tap on any messages in their inboxes to get more details on any information that people have shared with them including names, companies, titles, recent tweets and more. The search function has also been improved to offer suggestions on the most likely contact after a user types in just a few letters of a person's name. \nThe updated Mail app also adds several new touch controls. Messages can be marked read or unread, for example, by swiping right, or they can be deleted by swiping left. Tapping and holding any one message also puts users into multi-select mode if they want to move or delete a number of messages at once. \nYahoo Mail users who install the new app will also be able to add other e-mail accounts such as Outlook.com, Hotmail and AOL Mail. This allows them to view and even search messages from all of their services at once via the Yahoo Mail interface. \n\"Mobile use requires a faster and smarter inbox,\" Bonforte said. \"Both of these needs are at the center of our new app.\" Tell Us What You Think Comment:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T10:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:09:01.979+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
