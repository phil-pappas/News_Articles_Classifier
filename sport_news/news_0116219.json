It will be a very difficult game,” said Fiorentina defender Davide Astori. \nRoma sit in second place at only one point behind but although leading the league with 20 goals, Rudi Garcia's men have defensive flaws. \nRoma were on their way to a 4-2 win over Bayer Leverkusen in the Champions League on Tuesday, having fought back from a two-goal deficit, but somehow surrendered to finish 4-4. \n“When you concede four times, it's not only the fault of the defence but of the entire team,” said Garcia, who reports say could be tempted to rest former Fiorentina star Mohamed Salah in favour of Bosnian Edin Dzeko. \nAnything less than a draw for either side would be embraced by Inter, who would regain top spot if they account for Palermo in Sicily. \nRoberto Mancini's men sit in third place on 17 points, below Roma only on goal difference, and, on paper, are considered the title favourites. \nInter failed to qualify for Europe this season, meaning they spent their midweek beating AC Milan in the annual Berlusconi Trophy played to honour the father of AC Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi. \nInter sent out a second string team, which beat Milan's Serie A stars 1-0 thanks to Geoffrey Kondogbia's first goal since he scored for Monaco to send the Ligue 1 side into the Champions League quarter-finals last February. \nMilan host high-flying Sassuolo in a fixture that could realistically turn in the visitors' favour. \nOn-form Napoli, who sit in fourth at three points off the pace, travel to Chievo looking to replicate the form that saw them run out 4-1 winners over Midtjylland in the Europa League yesterday. \nArgentinian striker Gonzalo Higuain scored the fourth goal and come Sunday, he could have a goals appetite fit to see him go clear of Sampdoria's Eder and teammate Lorenzo Insigne, who have also scored six times in the league. \nFixtures (times GMT) — tomorrow \nEmpoli v Genoa (1300), Carpi v Bologna (1600), Palermo v Inter Milan (1845) \nSunday \nSampdoria v Verona (1030), Juventus v Atalanta, AC Milan v Sassuolo, Udinese v Frosinone (all 1300), Fiorentina v Roma, Lazio v Torino (both 1600), Chievo v Napoli (1845) — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:50:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T09:54:11.045+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
