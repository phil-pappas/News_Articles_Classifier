The Seminoles are 11th in the AP and the Demon Deacons have lost 11 straight games to ranked opponents by an average of 29 points per game. While it’s easy to point out that running back Dalvin Cook will have a huge game, look for Seminoles quarterback Everett Golson to shred an overrated Wake Forest pass defense that is 11th in the FBS, allowing just 145 pass yards per game. \nAir Force (+5½) over NAVY: This rivalry that usually determines the winner of the Commanderr-In-Chief’s Trophy has been dominated by the underdog. There have been eight outright upsets in the last 12 meetings, and the ’dog is 10-1-1 against the spread! Navy has won five of the last six encounters in Annapolis, but the Midshipmen did lose outright as the favorites in 2011. The Falcons are actually outrushing and allowing fewer rushing yards than the Midshipmen this season. \nLast week (NCAA): 1-1\nSeason: 4-4\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under bettor's guide ,  steele trap", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T07:20:48.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
