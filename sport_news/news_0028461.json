Tom Brady threw for 312 yards and three touchdowns and New England took advantage of a botched fake punt in the Patriots' 34-27 victory over the Colts on Sunday night at Indianapolis.\nThe Patriots improved to 5-0 for the first time since 2007. It was the first meeting between the rivals since the \"Deflategate\" storm erupted after the AFC title game in January.\nFor a half, the teams traded jabs. But New England seized control in the second half.\nBrady's 25-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowksi gave New England a 27-21 lead. And when the Patriots stopped the Colts (3-3) on an odd-looking and ill-advised fake punt, the scrambling Brady eventually found LeGarrette Blount for an 11-yard scoring pass that made it 34-21.\nAndrew Luck was 30-of-50 for 312 yards and three touchdowns in his first game back from an injured right shoulder.\nPACKERS 27, CHARGERS 20 (at Green Bay, Wis.) — Green Bay (6-0) stopped the Chargers on fourth-and-goal from the 3 with 15 seconds left and overcame a career day by Philip Rivers, 27-20.\nRivers set career highs with 43 completions, 65 attempts and 503 yards passing. He threw for two TDs for the Chargers. \nRookie CB Damarious Randall lunged to poke away Rivers' short pass to Danny Woodhead near the front right pylon in the final seconds.\nPackers RB James Starks had touchdowns on a 65-yard run and a 5-yard pass in the first quarter.\nBRONCOS 26, BROWNS 23, OT (at Cleveland) — Peyton Manning shook off three interceptions and drove Denver in range for Brandon McManus' 34-yard field goal with 4:56 left in overtime.\nManning took the Broncos from their own 12 to Cleveland's 16 before McManus kicked his game-winner to make Denver 6-0 for the seventh time in franchise history.\nThe Broncos defense came up big in overtime. After Manning's third pick, Denver recorded two sacks to push the Browns out of field-goal range.\nLIONS 37, BEARS 34, OT (at Detroit) — Matt Prater kicked a 27-yard field goal with 2:29 left in overtime, and Detroit won for the first time this season.\nMatthew Stafford heaved a 57-yard pass to Calvin Johnson to set up the kick for the Lions. Johnson finished with six receptions for 166 yards.\nChicago's Robbie Gould kicked a 29-yard field goal as time expired in regulation. \nBENGALS 34, BILLS 21 (at Orchard Park, N.Y.) — Andy Dalton threw three TD passes and unbeaten Cincinnati won its sixth straight to match the team's best start.\nDalton completed TD passes to Marvin Jones, Tyler Eifert and Jeremy Hill. Dalton finished 22 of 33 for 243 yards.\nThe Bengals broke open the game for good by scoring 17 points on their first three second-half possessions to build a 34-14 lead.\nSTEELERS 25, CARDINALS 13 (at Pittsburgh) — Landry Jones threw two TD passes to Martavis Bryant in relief of Michael Vick and Pittsburgh rallied for the win.\nVick (hamstring) left in the third quarter and Pittsburgh's offense took off. Jones hit Bryant for an 8-yard score to give the Steelers the lead. The two hooked up later for an 88-yard strike.\nJones went 8-of-12 for 168 yards and the two scores. Bryant caught six passes for 137 yards in his first action of the season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:38:37.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
