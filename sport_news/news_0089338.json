Mattingly said Thursday in a statement distributed by the team that it's \"the right time and right move for both parties.\" Los Angeles was 446-363 in five years under Mattingly, finishing with a winning record in every season and claiming the last three NL West titles. But the Dodgers have not reached the World Series since winning the championship in 1988. The 54-year-old former Yankees star ranks sixth in wins among Dodgers managers.
