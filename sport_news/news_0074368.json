Joe Donnelly and U.S. Rep. André Carson addressed Congress on Thursday to recognize the 1955 Crispus Attucks High School basketball team, the first all-black athletic team to win a state championship in the United States. \nDuring his speech, Donnelly said the team has continued to be a source of inspiration over the past six decades. Carson said the team’s win was “a major step” for black athletes nationwide. \nCrispus Attucks was founded as a segregated school for black students in 1927. It wasn’t allowed to play in the state basketball tournament until 1942. \nThe Flying Tigers won the state championship with a 97-74 victory on March 19, 1955. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T15:32:27.407+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
