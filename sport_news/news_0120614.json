They played in a rage, they played smart, they played together. They played relentlessly over 60 minutes, they played with the kind of pride Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson and Michael Strahan would recognize in a heartbeat.\nThey were Giants when it mattered: A classic Steve Spagnuolo goal-line stand early in the fourth quarter, and then Eli Manning and Rashad Jennings were Giants when it mattered with a 51-yard catch-and-run touchdown on which he broke three tackles that finished — yes, finished — the Bills. The final was Giants 24, Bills 10, and it means this division is officially up for grabs, and the Giants are grabbing for it.\nThere were times when it must have seemed to Tyrod Taylor as if there were 12 Angry Men standing tall and defiant in front of him, shadowing him, caging him, suffocating him, swarming him, making him one-dimensional and daring him to beat them.\nBully for the Giants.\nIt made John Mara, who remembers what a Big Blue Wrecking Crew is supposed to look like, smile.\n“It was nice to see,” Mara said.\nThe Giants made a loud statement Sunday, took the bully’s lunch, stepped on his glasses and left feeling like giants. And hell hath no fury than a Giants defense scorns.\n“It gives you a little extra grit when you’re hearing people doubting us or saying, ‘We’re atrocious or we’re the weak point of the team,’ ” Damontre Moore said. “We had a meeting by ourselves, we talked about it, and we just said let’s go out here and handle what we can control.\n“We’ve been answering the call and we’ve been proving a point and letting people know that we are no weak link. I get tired of getting looked down on. We wanted to go out and make a statement, and define our purpose.”\nIt was 16-6 for the Giants when Taylor found tight end Charles Clay for 27 yards. First-and-goal at the 9.\nThe collective mindset: “Don’t let the ball cross the goal-line,” Landon Collins said.\nAnd: “So what, now what?” Kerry Wynn said.\nNow what: Jon Beason and Brandon Meriweather stop Karlos Williams after a four-yard gain. Robert Woods catches a pass in the right flat and Collins stops him at the 2. Taylor rolls right and Wynn corrals him at the 1. Williams catches a pass in the right flat and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and J.T. Thomas stop him for no gain.\n“To be honest, when we were in that goal-line, one thing I can think of was back when Coach Spags had showed us a video like two weeks ago, I think it was when the Giants were 0-2 back in the ’07 season, and they came up with that big goal line stand and it kinda helped spark that team to get going,” Cullen Jenkins said. “I was just thinking, ‘Hey, whatever we need to do to get that spark going and get it back to the old ways and the traditions, make it happen.’ ”\nThis is a No-Name defense without Jason Pierre-Paul pushing to make a name for itself.\n“We don’t have one star,” Moore said. “We got 11 stars out there.”\nDevon Kennard made a beautiful interception on a wheel route down the sideline.\n“We know who we are. We believe in our coach, in our coaches, and the players we have in that room,” Kennard said.\nPrince Amukamara recovered a fumble that he forced.\n“We always come in with an Us-Against-the-World mentality. Coach Coughlin likes to call it Road Warriors,” Amukamara said.\nThe World lost.\n“We got a bunch of ballers out there,” Moore said. “It’s just a matter of implementing the plan.”\nCoughlin was practically giddy over how hard his players, particularly on defense, are playing. Taylor (28-42, 274 yards, one touchdown, one interception, 15 yards rushing) never had a chance.\n“For the most part, he never felt fully comfortable,” Kennard said.\nJenkins was asked if he thinks outsiders will take notice of Giants defense.\n“I hope not,” he said, and smiled. “Keep flying under the radar.”\nMoore’s ears perked up from the neighboring locker: “They better take notice,” he said.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under devon kennard ,  eli manning ,  new york giants ,  prince amukamara ,  rashad jennings", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T02:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T10:46:00.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
