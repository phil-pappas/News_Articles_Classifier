Alex Briggs scored at the 37-minute mark for ACS but the damage had already been done as Friendship Christian went to the half with a 6-1 advantage. “Friendship is a very good team, they are very deserving of being state champs” ACS coach Bob LaTour said. “I was very proud of how our boys did not give up. Friendship is an experienced team starting nine seniors and two juniors. We are much younger so hopefully this experience will work for us in the future.” Briggs and Jonathan Brann added second-half goals and goalkeeper Ben Rorrer finished with seven saves for the Warriors (15-3-1). Tyler Nelson had three goals and Will Moy added two for the Falcons (19-2).
