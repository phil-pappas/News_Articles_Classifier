But within the editorial is the reason this cannot be done: Bartlett STEM, Savannah Arts, Oglethorpe Middle and the others all get to choose their student body from among those who already have good academic and behavior records. If all the schools in Chatham County could only admit students with proven success records, then all schools would be successful.\nThe problem is to figure out what to do with “many of the 35,000 students in public schools who don’t know how to behave in school and aren’t excelling in their studies.” These kids are an aggravation to have in class, but I can’t help feeling sorry for them. What a torment it must be to have to go into a place day after day where you don’t really have any interest or expectation in doing well. We can’t just “put them out” as my students suggest; we need to have a place for them to go.\nThe truth is not everyone wants to or needs to be a scholar in the typical academic sense. This is not an insult! Our society needs people who know how to do things that cannot be accomplished at a desk. A fulfilling and successful life can be built around making things and making things work.\nWoodville-Thompkins is a start in this direction, but so much more needs to be done to provide places for non-academically inclined students to find a home.\nAnd as for “stellar” teachers? They are everywhere, including in the schools with bad reputations. It takes a lot more teaching talent to work with students who are resentful and have a history of failure than it does to teach those who are already success stories when they walk into the classroom.\nKATHRYN TANNER\nSavannah\nGod, restore our sanity and compassion\nLots of luck in trying to raise awareness of the cruel slaughter of baby chicks. For a moment there, reading Steven Meisenbach’s letter of Sept. 18 (“McDonald’s egg pledge is a small step”), I thought he was talking about abortion clinics.\nSoon the Christmas season will be upon us and congregations will hear sermons about King Herod and the slaughter of the Innocents. King Herod was a piker when compared to what America is doing. How can Hillary Clinton cuddle her grandchild while at the same time pushing for late term (and beyond) abortions and the sale of body parts?\nGod have mercy on us and restore our sanity and compassion.\nJEAN BROWN\nSavannah\nThe power of three taking away our rights\nThe three powers of the United States are the president, Congress and the judicial branch.\n“Continuance of our government depends on its pure principles; if the three powers maintain their mutual independence from each other it may last long, but not so if either can assume the authorities of the other.” (Thomas Jefferson, Sept. 28, 1820).\nAll three powers of government are servants of we the people who own the nation.\nThere is one right totally owned by the people — not government — it is property, which includes one’s body, home, auto, animals, land, etc. Recently, the president and government have intruded upon the private rights of individual health with Obamacare. It should be removed away from property.\nWALTER F. HEYDT\nSpringfield\nThis nation needs\na time machine\nThe jobs report on Oct. 2 shows the failure of the Obama Administration’s economic policy. The Russian planes and troops deployed to Syria are the latest chapter in failed foreign policy.\nObama’s presidency is a fiasco. It will take years for our country to undo the damage done by this naive, misguided administration.\nObama’s reaction is to talk gun control and politicize a massacre to divert the public’s attention from these failures.\nWhat this country needs is a time machine to fast forward us to 2017.\nGUY RANDOLPH\nSavannah\nOur problems extend way beyond guns\nTwo-hundred and sixty four: The number of mass shootings (defined as when four or more people were injured or killed by a gun) in 2015. Forty-five: The number of school shootings in 2015.\nWe spend millions on seven, soon to be eight, hearings on Benghazi for political reasons (as former House speaker wanna be, Kevin McCarthy, admitted) but collectively shrug our shoulders over these ever too common mass shootings.\nJeb Bush’s comment about Oregon shooting: “Stuff happens.” His statement seems to be the general attitude. I’m not against guns (indifferent at best).\nI hope a hunter bags the deer destined to crush the front of my car. If there is a solution, it will have to come from shifting our cultural attitudes about guns and how we relate to them. My point is to illustrate that our priorities seem to be slightly out of whack. This extends way beyond guns.\nRUSSELL KEEVY\nSavannah\nElect leaders who support gun control\nSo it happened again, in spite of all our prayers, hopes, community gatherings and elegant speeches after Columbine and Sandy Hook, and the rest so numerous and frequent we forget.\nWhy? Because prayers and dreams are not enough.\nWe need Congress to act on the will of the people. But instead they act on the will of the large donations that keep them in their congressional seats. Prayers are lovely, but I think God is already on the side of life. We need a Congress that votes in the best interest of the nation, not the NRA or a corporate sponsor.\nI think the start of a fix for these terrible mass killings is reasonable gun control, and the way to get it is to vote for candidates who support reasonable gun control, as well as to change campaign finance laws so every elected official owes his seat to only the people in his district.\nIf we don’t elect leadership that reflects our mindset about gun control, the next mass killing will be on us.\nPEPI STREIFF\nSavannah", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-09T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:14:08.827+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
