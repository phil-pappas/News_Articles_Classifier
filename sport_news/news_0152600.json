McKinney North’s defense was made a fool in a 72-43 defeat against Wylie East last week, ceding 620 yards and 10 touchdowns. The Bulldogs were no joke Thursday night. The North defense was stout from the outset against Prosper at Ron Poe Stadium, holding the Eagles to negative rush yards through the first quarter, while creating a takeway. The 21-0 lead after the first 12 minutes would plume to a 46-18 victory, as the North offense was swift and incisive as per usual, while the defense all over Prosper’s edge and speed option rushing plays. “I was very proud of our defense,” said Mike Fecci, North head coach. “We won the coin toss and 99.9 percent of the time I want the ball to start but I deferred because I wanted to find out right now – are we ready to perform as a defense?” Previous to Thursday’s limited production, the Eagle offense had scored 35, 29, 28 and 47 points in its first four games. The North defense had given up 102 points in its last two outings, so Thursday’s game was set up to be a points race. Only one team got out of the blocks. By halftime, North had run to a 24-3 lead by encircling the rush attempts from Prosper running back Robert Mahone and quarterback Ryan Davis. The duo averaged only 2.5 yards-per-carry in the first two quarters. By game’s end, the Bulldogs had three interceptions and a fumble recovery and held Prosper to 65 pass yards. “When the defense plays like that, the offense can just roll because they don’t have to feel like they have to score every single possession,” Fecci said. “Our field position was excellent.” The offense was setup nicely by the defense on its first few drives of the night, via two 3-and-outs and an interception. Junior running back Micah Baulicex scored on a 10-yard rush, senior Sam Ashun kicked a 28-yard field goal and senior quarterback Christian Files walked across the goal line from one yard out. In the second quarter, sophomore receiver Brett Hartland caught a fade pass from Files for a 19-yard touchdown. Prosper scored a 22-yard field goal with 6:39 left in the half and was able to keep North out of the end zone despite a lengthy drive just before the break. North grinded to another touchdown to start the second half, going 75 yards in 11 plays. Senior KJ Hart rumbled in from 10 yards out to move the score to 30-3. Prosper benefited from a muffed punt by the Bulldogs and was able score its first touchdown with 4:14 to go in the third quarter. The dropped punts were contagious, as Prosper had one of their own near the 50 yard line. North took advantage, driving for another touchdown run – a 6-yarder by Hart. Prosper got back to the endzone on a corner route early in the fourth quarter, moving the score to 37-18. An intentional grounding call awarded North a safety with 9:01 left in the game. Hart added a goal line plunge before the night was over. \nThe Bulldogs are back in action at Lovejoy Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T05:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T13:38:26.486+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
