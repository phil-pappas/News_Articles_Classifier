(AP Photo/Tim Ireland) Sponsored Links The Associated Press MIAMI â€” \nJoe Philbin has been fired four games into his fourth season as coach of the Miami Dolphins, and one day after a flop on an international stage that helped to seal his fate. \nTight ends coach Dan Campbell, who has been with the Dolphins since 2010, was promoted to interim coach Monday. He has no previous head coaching experience. \nThe Dolphins (1-3) lost their third game in a row and turned in their fourth consecutive lackluster performance when they were beaten Sunday in London by the archrival New York Jets, 27-14. \nMidseason head coaching changes are unusual in the NFL, but few will accuse owner Stephen Ross of impatience. He ignored calls to fire Philbin in December after the Dolphins faded to finish 8-8 for a second successive season. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and http://twitter.com/AP_NFL \n___ \nFollow Steven Wine on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Steve_Wine Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WSOC-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T21:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T21:43:45.596+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
