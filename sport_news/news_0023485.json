N. Goswamy\nQuilt: n. many forms including cowlte , qwylte , quylt ; from Anglo-French quilte , Old French cuilte , coute ; from Latin culcita “ mattress, bolster,” early meaning: stuffed sack; mattress; cushion. Article of bed furniture consisting essentially of two large pieces of woven material having a layer of some substance (such as wool, flock, or down), placed between them, esp. one in which lining is kept in place by stitches or lines of stitching passing through the material. — Oxford English Dictionary\nFor most of us, at least up here in the north, a quilt is a quilt: razaai is how we would simply call it, or lihaaf , thinking at once of wintry nights and of that celebrated famous/infamous story by Ismat Chughtai. But I became aware of the aesthetic and historical aspect of quilts when I saw a great big poster, brilliantly designed and coloured, in the San Diego Museum of Art years ago, announcing an exhibition of quilts. I do not recall whether the show was on loan from the Quilt Museum somewhere in Kentucky, or from the National Quilting Association of the United States, but I remember being fascinated by the dimensions and the history of that rural, folksy craft. How in the US, it began with settlers who came into the ‘New World’ from across the seas, how in those colonial days quilts were made from fabric ‘salvaged from its previous use’, how each group of settlers brought with them their own patterns and feeling for colour, how in the 19th century, it was slave women who took to the craft and used to embroider or patched on to their masters’ fabric their own native symbols or patterns: it was all there. Historic quilts were spoken of in that show, their dating was discussed, quilting parties or associations — ‘Quilt Bees’ — were described at length, attention was drawn to the national campaign for quilt-making during the Great War, inspired by the idea that making quilts at home would save blankets for the ‘boys in the trenches’. It was as if one was being guided through the history of the country through the history of this essentially ‘women’s craft’. There was much to see and much to learn: all from objects that one almost takes for granted in our daily lives. I have not quite forgotten it. This in part is the reason why I was drawn to a recently published book: Quilts of India: Timeless Textiles . Interestingly, but somehow not unexpectedly, it is authored by an ‘outsider’ — Patrick J. Finn, an American scholar — who has spent years studying, analysing, perhaps even collecting, quilts from all parts of India, from north to south, and from east to west. “India is half-a-world away from my grandmother’s house in Iowa where I saw my first quilt’, he writes in the afterword of this book of his. “I have now seen enough quilts, which if placed end-to-end would traverse the distance from New Delhi to Granma’s home in Belmond.” And then adds. “Nonetheless, my head still whips around to catch a passing clothesline, just in case another gem is hanging there among the pants, shirts and saris. I’m insatiable, so I remain in India where the array of quilts is endless, as are the adventures of uncovering them.” To go through this book is to be drenched in colour for it ‘seeps’, as it were, from virtually every page. From Bengal and Bihar and Jharkhand to Rajasthan and Gujarat, and then on to Madhya Pradesh, Goa and Karnataka, one travels: now with a kantha from Bengal, now with a sujani from Bihar; gudris from Gujarat stay draped over the shoulders or hang from walls, and koudis serve both to adorn and to protect a newly bought motor-bike in Karnataka. There are opulent images and a plethora of technical detail. Suddenly, one finds oneself in the world of rallis and rukhdis , of chaklas and jajams . One may not always agree with the author over his grouping of objects, or even about everything in the book falling strictly into the category of’ ‘quilts’, but one cannot fault the selection of objects. For there is a dazzling range of things here and what makes things come often to life in the book is the human context in which they are placed. ‘Who has stolen my gudri with the priceless tassels and bells?’ one can hear a Rabari woman from Gujarat at one place as she sits sewing her piece. “ Angrezi are the words that I embroider”, a bride-to-be from Bihar states with authority. And so on. One hears voices and whispers, and can catch oneself inching close to sights of eyes that are unaware of anything other than the work immediately in hand. Stella Kramrisch, as ever so often, said it well, speaking of the kanthas of Bengal: “The kantha is a work that gives wholeness to things that were of no use any more, to fragments without any significance”. These ‘fragments without significance’ fill the pages of this volume, in which one not only sees some splendid examples of those, but also very often the women — and at places men — who imparted significance to them. And, occasionally, one comes upon unexpected vignettes of life. Like when one sees a sadhu from Vrindavana wearing different pieces of cloth for, in the sect to which he belongs, the belief is that ‘seven different colours of cloth sewn together to form a patchwork transform the cloth and make it new”. Or when one comes upon a sacred tree on the Anjaneya Hill in Karnataka round the trunk of which an astonishing range of pieces of cloth are wrapped by the devotees of Hanumana: Anjaneya in other words. One can go on endlessly on this theme. But I am tempted to conclude with two snippets of verse: coming from different sources, but both on the theme of the connection between life and fabric. First the last stanza of a poem by Douglas Malloch: And what is life? A crazy quilt;/ Sorrow and joy, and grace and guilt, With here and there a square of blue / For some old happiness we knew; And so the hand of time will take/The fragments of our lives and make, Out of life's remnants, as they fall/A thing of beauty, after all. And then that ringing, probing couplet of Faiz: Zindagi kyaa kisi muflis ki qaba hai, jis mein Har ghari dard key paiwand lage jaate hain?\nRoughly, in translation:\n[Is life then nothing but the garment of a beggarly man: a mere patchwork ofmoments of relentless pain?]\nill.
