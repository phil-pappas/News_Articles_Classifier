He was 62.\n“Chris Legeros served KIRO TV and the viewers of Western Washington for 31 years,” General Manager Jay O’Connor said. “As you would expect from a man of his caliber he gave all of us his greatest gift at the end: He modeled for us the ability to keep a great attitude and a big smile even in the face of unthinkable adversity. Chris was clearly a man with great faith, courage and humility. He truly possessed the heart of a servant.\n“May we all remember Chris that way and allow his greatest gift to serve as a reminder in our daily walk.”\nIn his career at KIRO 7, Chris received some of the highest broadcasting honors, including awards from The Associated Press, the Society of Professional Journalists, Best of the West and the Washington Education Association. He also won three Emmy awards and was an honorary member of the Army Reserve’s 50th General Hospital Unit after reporting on it during the Persian Gulf War.\nGrowing up in Edina, Minnesota, Chris had a love for animals and enrolled in pre-veterinary school at the University of Minnesota. But then Watergate came along and the news business seemed fascinating. Chris wanted the chance to tell great stories.\nThe oldest of four children in a proud Greek family, Chris landed an internship at WTCN TV and WWTC radio before his 1974 graduation. He moved to KCMT-TV, a station serving west-central Minnesota, and battled equipment that sometimes failed in the 20-below-zero temperatures.\nChris was there until 1977 when he moved to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where he reported and anchored as Chris George for KGAN-TV. It also was in Cedar Rapids where he met the former Julie Dowd, who was attending nursing school. They were married in 1981 at St. John the Baptist Greek Orthodox Church.\nLess than two years later, a friend told him about a reporting job at KIRO 7 in Seattle, a place he and Julie had never been. In January 1983, he called with the good news: He'd been offered a job and could start the next month.\nChris’ most memorable assignments included covering a cruise ship grounding in Ketchikan, a deadly airline accident in Hawaii, devastating tornadoes in Oklahoma, and dozens of forest fires and floods in Washington state.\n\"I realized that if I listened to the advice of my co-workers, the end result was invariably better,\" Chris said earlier this year. \"If I treated the people I interviewed with dignity and respect, they generally responded in a positive way.\"\nBut the moments he loved most came with Julie and their daughters, Elena and Anna.\nOne of his favorite news broadcasts was the one where Elena joined him on Take Your Daughter to Work Day. In 2013, he walked Anna down the aisle at her wedding to Alex Fleet. After his diagnosis, Chris had relatives from across the country come to visit.\nWhen Chris was inducted into the Silver Circle by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences earlier this year, his family was among the 300-plus crowd that gave him a standing ovation.\n\"After my diagnosis of pancreatic cancer last August, one of my daughters asked me if I was 'scared' and 'afraid' to die,\" Chris wrote in March. \"I kind of surprised myself with how quickly I answered 'no.'\n\"One of my earliest memories of going to church was attending kindergarten Sunday School at St. Mary's Greek Orthodox Church in Minneapolis. We sang 'Jesus Loves Me' over and over again in English and Greek.\n\"I believed the words then as I do now.\"\nWhenever St. Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church needed someone to emcee an event, Chis was there. Whenever they needed an auctioneer, Chris volunteered. He served espresso at the annual Greek festival, and often shared the fun of the event on KIRO 7 Eyewitness News.\n\"The world would be such a better place,” Father Photios Dumont said, “if we had more Chris Legeroses.”\nBelow are remembrances from Chris’ friends and co-workers at KIRO 7. If you would like to share a remembrance about Chris, please send us an e-mail . Also, this is a link to pancreatic cancer resources . The website has information on symptoms, resources for people recently diagnosed, and notes on how you can help research efforts.\nSam Argier\nThe world lost a great man and beautiful soul today. Whenever you worked with Chris, it was a good day at the office. He would always put a smile on your face. RIP my friend, you left an incredible legacy.\nDavid Baumann\nI worked at KIRO as Marketing Director from 1986 until 1994. Chris Legeros was not just my friend back then. He was my best friend.\nWhen I first met Chris, I didn't know anyone in Seattle, and hardly anyone at the station. We got to chatting one day, and immediately hit upon common ground. Same age? Check. Both Minnesotans? Check. Two kids the same age as each others? Check. Same neighborhood? Check. In fact, we found out that we lived across the street from one another!\nAnd that was the start of a beautiful friendship. I could only afford one car then, and Chris was working the dayside reporting shift. So we carpooled back and forth to Bothell every day for about 3 years. Great conversations, jokes, anecdotes, wishes and dreams…we covered it all.\nOur daughters Rose and Elena grew to be best friends. We both eventually moved away from that neighborhood, but the friendship remained. I remember hitting the Seattle Auto Show for a few years with Chris, both fantasizing about the hot sports cars we wanted, but knew we would never get while we had families. But we certainly were legends in our own minds as we sat in those cars!\nI can’t think of anyone who didn’t like Chris. He never had a bad word to say about anybody. He was admired, respected and loved by all who knew him…and even those just watched him on the newscasts. We stayed in touch over the years as I moved away, first to Minneapolis, then to Detroit. There was always a Christmas card (he had the GREATEST cards!), a note, an email, and finally connecting on Facebook. And whenever I visited Seattle, Chris and Julie were tops on my list to visit. I feel so lucky that I got a chance to talk with him just a few days before he passed. We said the things we always wanted to say; how much we loved each other, and how grateful we were for being friends. I’ll never forget it.\nI know my life is better for having known him. His laughter and smile will remain with me forever.\nRuth Bayang\nChris Legeros was a producer's dream... a stellar storyteller and an even more stellar human being. He brought laughter, kindness and humanity back into a business that be harsh and cold-hearted.\nDiane Bowers\nChris was a bright light when I first walked in to KIRO nearly 25 years ago, greeting me with his trademark smile and a warm handshake. Nervous to the core, he quickly explained that he too had moved from Iowa to Seattle and I would love it here. He was right of course - as he was about so many things. When we visited a month ago, we swapped old war stories about the way the TV biz used to be -- racing back to the station in time to get film processed for air, pounding out stories on a manual typewriter - and using pay phones to stay in touch with the desk! We laughed a lot that day - as one always did with Chris. It has been an honor to know him, and a privilege to call him friend. He is always in my heart. One of the very best of the very best.\nEd Carlos\nChris Legeros was one of the first people I met at KIRO. I ran into him while I was interviewing for a job. Chris came up, hand extended and said, “Welcome to KIRO-TV, I’m Chris Legeros. Who are you?” By the end of that conversation, Chris pretty much knew everything about me.\nA few days after I started at KIRO, Chris congratulated me and said something like, \"you're going to like it here. We're like family. Aloha!\"\nChris not only became my co-worker, but also a friend. He welcomed me into his family of friends - seeing his wife Julie as my nurse just before surgery made me feel that everything was going to be ok. We celebrated birthdays, weddings together - just like family.\nOne of the lasting images I have of Chris is from his daughter’s Anna’s wedding reception. Chris was gathering as many people he could to participate in a traditional Greek dance. Chris was in a circle, one arm around his new son-in-law, the other arm on his daughter’s shoulder. Laughing, the Silver Fox throwing his head back, enjoying the moment.\nIn the years since that job interview, I have seen Chris extend that same welcoming hand to people coming through the newsroom, saying, “Welcome to KIRO TV. I’m Chris Legeros.” It always brought me back to our meeting.\nIt will be hard not seeing Chris or knowing that he’s a phone call away. It will be hard not hear his laugh echo through the newsroom. And it will be hard saying goodbye to such a close family member.\nNatasha Chen\nA lot of people knew Chris better than I did. But in the short time I got to work with him, we shared a lot of weekend shifts. He never complained. He loved sharing other people’s stories and had a way of making the day fun. I visited him last December, and he showed me these incredible gingerbread houses he and his family made – an annual tradition. He had also just gotten a drone for Christmas. He told me promptly flew it into a tree and got it stuck there. Sure, I’ll remember his professionalism and his knack for storytelling, but what I admired most was his ability to have fun, to see the good and to love his family.\nScott Crueger\nI grieve for Chris, whose life was too short.\nI grieve for his family and friends, who have lost the comfort of his companionship.\nLast, I grieve for myself and his other colleagues, particularly the photographers at KIRO, who may find that the adventures we went on with Chris in pursuit of our stories were some of the best times and most fun we may ever have on the job.\nI am profoundly saddened by the loss of this good man.\nNatalia Dotto\nI remember when one of Chris’ daughters went off to college and how proudly he spoke about her. His smile was always so contagious, and his sense of humor was the best. The last time I saw him was outside a Seattle Sounders game … he wasn’t going to the game he was covering it with photographer Peter Frerichs.One of the kindest people ever. His loss is heart-breaking. Silver Fox you will be missed.\nCharmin Flojo\nWe lost a truly great person. Chris Legeros was caring, kind and genuine, and it was such a blessing to work with him. Whenever you entered the newsroom, Chris made you feel so welcomed with his smile and the way he greeted you. I will miss you, Silver Fox.\nAlison Grande\nI am thankful to have had a chance to work with Chris. He was a class act in everything he did. He was a talented journalist and dedicated friend. More than a decade ago a news director gave me the chance to choose where I wanted to sit in the newsroom. I quickly asked to sit by Chris and Essex. Chris taught me how to be a better reporter -- he taught me more about how to live a good life.\nTerry Griffin\nOur KIRO family lost, and heaven gained, one of its brightest stars at 7am today. My dear friend Chris Legeros has \"passed away\" from the pain of this corporal world, and \"passed into\" the light of a new day in the presence of the God he believed in, had great faith in until the end, and that we share.\nI will miss you my friend. I will think of you daily and I cherish your memory always. I'm at a loss for better words\nMaria Guerrero\nChris was warm and genuine.\nNo matter what he was doing or how stressful the day was, he would always help you.\nI sought him out for advice a couple of times. He always gave it with a smile. I will miss that smile.\nChris was not only proud to be Greek, he also celebrated diversity in our newsroom. When he anchored a newscast that I was reporting in, I remember him tossing to me in the field and saying my last name in Spanish. It made me smile. He loved and respected all of us.\nHelen Holter\nHe empathized. He encouraged. Chris truly leaned into life. Sorrowfully missed.\nElisa Jaffe\nWe lost a thoughtful, classy, compassionate, and talented colleague today.\nWhen Chris Legeros popped out of the competition's car, it was always a welcome sight. His warm smile felt like home and his news chops made me us all up our game.\nThe Greek Festival this weekend won't be the same without Chris but we shall celebrate him. He set the bar high as a reporter, a father, and a person of integrity.\nMay he rest in peace.\nDoug Keith\nI was a graphic artist at KIRO TV and often covered arraignments and trials as a courtroom artist. In fact, my first flight in Chopper 7 was with Chris to cover a trial. We shared a few nervous moments of turbulence that day... and a few laughs! Great guy to work with, very professional and always had a positive attitude. We lost touch over the years but I will always remember his smile. Safe travels my friend.\nMargaret Larson\nChris was easily one of the most talented, caring, and fun “teammates” I've ever had the pleasure to know. No one could duplicate his infectious enthusiasm for life's blessings big and small or his wicked sense of humor. May God rest his soul and comfort his family. He remains one of a kind.\nDaniel Maynor\nMy heart is deeply saddened of the news today for Chris but joyful knowing that he is no longer in pain. I met Chris 20 years ago when I was homeless on the streets of Seattle and frequently eating meals at the Millionaires Club over the past two decades. I had become homeless on and off and would encounter Chris on the streets of Seattle. He always had a beautiful smile and encouraging words for me and offered me assistance which I could not accept due to my pride. I wanted to get word to him that I am in transitional housing and trying to save money for a permanent place and an automobile, and for him to know that my encounters with him brought so much hope and peace when I met him. God bless his family, God bless KIRO TV for a beautiful man with a beautiful heart. Lord Jesus, he's one of your angels now. Amen\nMarty Medak\nEvery time I worked with Chris he was always upbeat and kept me laughing even when things got super hectic as it often does in the business. He was real pro and a great co-worker. It was a privilege to have worked with him.\nMonique Ming Laven\nIf there was ever a man who should have lived to be a grandfather, it was Chris Legeros. Such a big man to be so gentle. And kind. And tender-hearted.\nWe lost a deeply good person today. It was far too soon, though, to be honest, there would never be the right time to lose his light. The tears come quickly right now, but anyone who knows Chris undoubtedly has some laughter to share too. He brought so much happiness to our lives.\nHe wrote the best stories, he asked the best questions, and he said the most hilarious things. Just ask any Greek to explain why he asked not to mention the Malaka Islands by name during a newscast.\nWe have lost \"The Spirit of the Northwest.\" Chris jokingly referred to that old tagline for KIRO, and so we called him that (along with Silver Fox, which he embraced with a smile and often accompanied with a slightly ridiculous red hat with earflaps). We would be so lucky if there were more spirits like his in the Northwest and everywhere else. Chris, I love you.\nAnd to Julie and the girls, thank you for sharing your wonderful man with us for so many years.\nJay O’Connor\nChris Legeros served KIRO TV and the viewers of Western Washington for 31 years. As you would expect from a man of his caliber he gave all of us his greatest gift at the end: He modeled for us the ability to keep a great attitude and a big smile even in the face of unthinkable adversity. Chris was clearly a man with great faith, courage and humility. He truly possessed the heart of a servant. May we all remember Chris that way and allow his greatest gift to serve as a reminder in our daily walk.\nMorgan Palmer\nIt's a cliche -- usually -- when people say that someone \"always had a smile.\" From the day I arrived at KIRO, Chris always had a spirit of cheer, even when stress levels were high. He always walked into the studio when he'd anchor a newscast and tell me in a low, shushed voice,\n\"Hello Mr. Palmer. May the spirit of the Northwest be upon you.\" Chris would repeat it every time we saw each other for the first time that day, like he was bestowing some sort of Northwest blessing! He knew that made me chuckle. What Chris grew to know over the time he was battling cancer is how much of a blessing he was to US.\nSteve Raible\nThis morning we lost one of the truly “good guys.” Chris Legeros was as gentle a soul as he was a dogged reporter. The thought of KIRO 7 without him pains us to the point of tears. But Chris would be the first person to make us smile. The memories of the devoted husband, father, and friend to all will comfort us. And he'll remain our very own Spirit of the Northwest. God keep you my friend\nRay Redick\nChris Legeros, My dear friend, I also have Terminal Cancer and you and I fought the tough fight together. When you had your good days and the bad days, we got it!!! So many things we shared were the same, reactions to chemo, losing hair, sick, hard to get away from the restroom, but when we had good days it made it all worth it!!! We devoted everyday of our life to help others, make people laugh, to be strong for family and friends. You always knew we were okay, we knew our destiny and what lies ahead for us. It is really toughest for the loved ones we leave behind!! But they know you are still always with them. Whenever they want to talk to you they just talk, you are always there to hear them. You did great with your time on this earth. All anybody can ask for is to leave a mark on peoples’ life. Yeah, you did that to me and s many others!!! I was honored to go thru this journey with you, now your next journey begins, I look forward to joining you on the next journey too!!! I will miss you my friend and look forward to talking to you tonight in my prayers and dreams, you did good buddy! We could not be more proud! Until we see each other again, all my love.\nHenry Rosoff\nChris was the guy in the newsroom who gave every new person a smile, a handshake, a tour and a few extra quarters for the vending machine when he walked you through the cafeteria. Unlike so many in our business who grew downtrodden and jaded, after decades of service he still came in enthusiastic and always reminded us to smile and believe in what we were doing. You were taken so soon, and we are all better for knowing you.\nJames Schugel\nHe was such a warm, gentle person who deeply cared about others and his work.\nNick Walker\nChris was someone who was always on your side. How is that possible? It's because he had the uncanny ability to put himself in your shoes, to see your point of view. He would ask, \"How are you doing?\" and want to know the real answer. And so for him, living out the Golden Rule of \"Do unto others as you would have them do unto you\" seemed to come natural to him. And in most cases, what he did for others was a lot more than what he would have others do for him. He was a giver, an encourager, an advocate, a friend.\nWhen I left KIRO-TV, Chris was the one who said, \"I'm giving you a party -- and it's at my house.\" And what a party he gave! His hospitality knew no bounds, and he went out of his way to give me an unforgettable going-away bash, and a memory I will always cherish.\nI have lived in Atlanta, GA for the past 16 years and haven't seen Chris in awhile. But every Christmas I always looked forward to his creative Christmas card -- a picture of his family in some zany setting with a clever caption. The one that sticks out in my mind is from several years ago--a photo of him and his wife at a fruit and vegetable stand, holding a wooden fruit box with their two little daughters inside, sticking their heads out and smiling radiantly. The big sign behind them revealed the name of the establishment --\"Chris's Produce.\" Get it? His produce? In the box? The pride he felt in his family was obvious, and you could feel the love in those annual holiday photographs.\nChris is also in an old video my family digs out and plays now and then. It was taken in the hospital the morning my daughter was born. The video pans over from our newborn baby to the TV set tuned to Channel 7 where we see Chris in the anchor chair beaming, \"We have some good news to bring you this morning, the birth of a new baby girl to our friend and colleague Nick Walker, just ...(looking at his watch) ... 22 minutes ago.\" Chris is a show stealer.\nChris was there for me, as he was for so many others, in the beginnings and in the ends. I am confident that for him, today's \"end\" is only a new beginning.\nAndy Wappler\nThank you, Chris, for always being a friend to me, Harry and the Wappler family. I have had many friends who knew you only though watching TV ask me today if the person they saw on the screen was really as warm, witty and kind as you appeared. All I can tell them is yes, and more.\nYou were so generous to me when I was starting my career in TV and so supportive of my father during my mother's own fight with cancer.\nWe will miss you and will always remember how you made the day brighter for everyone who had the honor of knowing you.\nColleen West\nChris would often greet me each morning with “Welcome to work!” Or “Spirit of the Northwest to you!” He always had a smile, quick wit and really knew how to tell a story, in person, and of course on air, where it was second nature to him. And he was fun – we posed together while I was wearing my ugly Christmas sweater and he was happy to wear a rainbow wig so I could get a picture of him. I feel lucky to have known him.\nNerissa Williams\nMorning, noon and night, Chris Legeros served the KIRO News Team so well. He was a true team player. It was a pleasure to work with him. Chris brought a sharp eye for news, a quick wit, and that handsome head of salt-and-pepper hair! He will be remembered … long, and well.\nJohn Arthur Wilson\nA pause from work and campaigning to honor a former broadcasting compatriot, Chris Legeros. We were both native sons of Minnesota, and we spent time together, while working for competing stations, on news stories around the region. I admired Chris for what he was, and what he wasn't. Chris was a people person, he understood that was at the core of any decent TV story, and he was a storyteller who could tell his tale with elegant economy of words. (I'm still trying to learn that!) But there were some equally important things Chris was not: star struck with himself, pompous, callous to those he worked with. As he so embodied in his long, tenacious battle with cancer, he was human, caring and quietly courageous. I can only imagine the loss to his family and the many fine folks at KIRO. May we hold them all is our prayers as Chris awaits his queue from the director of the Big Newscast in the Sky. Rest in peace, my friend.\nJake Wiederrich\nChris Legeros was simply one of the best reporters ever to tell a story.\nI loved his zeal to crisscross the Pacific Northwest in search of a great story. He was always first to volunteer to venture out of town to cover a story. By the time he returned, his assignment had become an adventure. After all these years, Chris Legeros has friends and admirers in every corner of Washington.\nChris never met a stranger. He could talk to anyone. From the homeless to the high and mighty, his interview questions were always fair and his reporting was always honest.\n.\ncomment (19)", "external_links": ["http://w.sharethis.com/button/buttons.js", "https://www.pancan.org/"], "published": "2015-10-09T23:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:15:10.630+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
