They are treated as undesirables except for the great revenue they pay. The proudest companies in India refuse to carry them in their fast mail trains.

In the beginning open trucks were considered good enough for him. But for many years past enterprising managers, realising that third class is the backbone of their passenger revenue, have gone on improving it until now there is little to choose in point of equipment between third and first class carriages\".", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:13:49.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
