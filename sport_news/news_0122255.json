Noonan Stadium. \nRinghoff relieved Fisher after the junior was intercepted midway into the second quarter. Using mainly a short passing game, Ringhoff connected with five different receivers during his initial drive that was capped by tight end Zach Troxell’s 12-yard TD reception. The play gave P’burg (4-1) a 14-7 lead with 26 seconds left in the first half. \nThe game served as a complete role reversal from the opener at Union, when Fisher relieved Ringhoff in the third quarter and sparked the Stateliners to a 33-12 win. Fisher took most of the snaps over the next three games against Bridgewater, Watchung Hills and Franklin. \n“I always hear the coaches say ‘Be ready,’ because you never know when your number is going to be called,” Ringhoff said. “When coach (Ryan Ditze) called my number, I was ready.” Zach Ringhoff (lehighvalleylive.com file photo) \nRinghoff completed passes to Kyle Santini, Garrett Boures, Yusef Shelton, Ja’Quan Jones and Troxell in that opening drive. The 14-play series included two successful fourth down conversions. \n“We just take what the defense gives us,” Ringhoff said. \nIt was essential for P’burg to go to the air more than usual because its typically stellar running game contributed just 77 yards on 41 carries. \n“The running game wasn’t working but the passing game brought it,” Ringhoff said. \nJones led the Stateliners on the ground with 35 yards on 15 carries followed by Manny Romero with 31 yards and a touchdown on 15 attempts. \nRinghoff carried the momentum over into the second half. His 53-yard pass to Shelton set up Romero’s 1-yard TD run, extending P’burg’s lead to 21-7 with 3:10 left in the third quarter. \nAfter Hillsborough (1-4) closed within 21-14 on a touchdown pass from Joe Schultz to Jackson Parhham, Ringhoff went to work again. On second-and-7, he hit Romero with a screen pass. Romero proceeded to break six tackles in yet another highlight reel play that took him into the end zone for a 58-yard TD. \nThe spectacular play gave P’burg a 28-14 lead with 11:05 remaining and turned out to be the winning points. \n“It’s great having a teammate like Manny,” Ringhoff said. “He’s a great player in space. We’re very fortunate to have No. 13. He’s our go-to guy.” \nOn Friday night, the Stateliners also were very fortunate to have Ringhoff.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:22:15.931+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
