With the victory, the Indians clinched its first winning record since 2009 and, in all likelihood, its first playoff berth since 2010. \nWayne Valley coaches acknowledged the two feats after the game. The players smiled, let out a little cheer and doled out a few back slaps. The enthusiasm, though, was tempered and short-lived. \nAs expected, head coach Roger Kotlarz asked a follow up question. \n\"Are we still hungry?\" he hollered. \n\"Starving!\" the team shouted back in unison. \nThe message was clear - Wayne Valley's mission very clearly is not yet accomplished. \n\"Stay hungry - that's been our mantra all year,\" the coach said. \"A winning record and a playoff berth are huge steps in the right direction. But we're far from done. Our long-term goals are to advance in the playoffs and win the championship and there's no reason we can't do that. We just have to keep focusing on our upcoming opponent.\" \nThat was Northern Highlands last week. Any question of the team's focus was answered right off the bat when junior Joe Scancarella returned the opening kickoff for a 90-yard touchdown. \n\"I've been involved with high school football for a long time,\" Kotlarz said. \"I've never seen a kickoff where all 11 men executed perfectly. Everyone made their block and Joe just blew through. What a way to start game - especially an away game.\" \n\"The blockers opened up a huge hole for me,\" Scancarella added. \"I just had to run through.\" \nFrom that point on, Wayne Valley's offense was in complete control. Junior Grant Ferrauilo picked the Highlanders apart with 13 completions for 142 yards and two touchdowns. He also rushed for a 12-yard score. His touchdown tosses went to junior Elijah Beard (4 yards) and senior Ryan Monteyne (12 yards). \nSenior Will Kearney added a 33-yard touchdown run and junior Nick Gould scored on a 4-yard rush. Kearney led the way on the ground with 138 rushing yards. Gould tacked on yards 61 rushing yards. \nJunior Jordan Montero had a team-high 5 receptions. Senior Vinny Tedesco, Monteyne, Scancarella, Gould and Beard had two receptions apiece. \nKotlarz was pleased with the way \"everyone picked up their game\" in the absence of his injured (foot) quarterback Nick Goodwin, who is still listed as week-to-week after suffering an injury in Week 5 against Teaneck. \n\"We have a lot of weapons on offense and it showed tonight,\" the coach said. \"Six guys caught passes. We also ran the ball very well.\" \nWayne Valley's defense, meanwhile, registered another dominant performance. As a unit, they have surrendered just 53 points in six games. \nSenior Tyler Andreas had two sacks. Senior linebackers Adam Lounsbery, Kearney and Tedesco had 8 tackles apiece. Junior Joe Monsen added 7 tackles. \nWayne Valley now turns its attention to hosting powerful Lakeland (4-2) tomorrow. If Wayne Valley wins, they will most likely lock into the No. 4 vs. No. 5 game in upcoming Section I, Group IV playoffs. There's still a chance that the Indians can get the No. 3 seed. \n\"We want a home game in the playoffs,\" Kotlarz said. \"Beating a good team like Lakeland will give us a lot of power points and that may enable us to stay home in the first round. That's not going to be easy, though. Lakeland will be our biggest challenge of the season this far.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T18:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T20:08:33.759+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
