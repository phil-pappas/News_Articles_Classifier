Coal-fired power plants account for about 60 per cent of India’s installed power capacity.\nBy 2030, the government said its installed capacity from “non-fossil fuel based energy resources” would grow to 40 per cent. It wasn’t immediately clear whether that would also include nuclear power.\nIndia said boosting its renewables to that level would require help with transfer of clean technology and financing — two of the crunch issues before the Paris deal, which is supposed to apply to all countries but also include provisions for rich countries to help poor countries fight climate change and adapt to its consequences.\nScientists say the heat-trapping carbon emissions released by the burning of fossil fuels — coal, oil and gas — are a key driver of rising temperatures that could lead to potentially catastrophic impacts, including flooding of island nations and intensifying droughts.\nChina and the U.S. are the only countries with higher emissions than India. As a bloc, the 28-nation European Union’s emissions are also higher.\nLike other developed countries, the U.S. and the EU committed to absolute reduction targets, while China pledged that its emissions would stop growing by 2030. India, with more than 300 million people living in poverty, wasn’t expected to offer a peak year because its emissions are projected to increase for decades as energy demand rises along with economic growth.\nIndian Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar last week told The Associated Press that developed countries should “vacate the carbon space” to allow India’s emissions to increase. “That carbon space demand is climate justice,” he said.\nTwo climate research groups this week said that the pledges put forth before the Paris conference would slow down global warming but projected that temperatures would still rise by 2.7 and 3.5 degrees C (4.9 and 6.3 degrees F), respectively.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:47:05.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
