It has not come at the Broncos' expense since Peyton Manning arrived in Denver. The Broncos sauntered across the Bay Bridge with a perfect record as an imperfect team. \nThis is no longer Peyton Manning's team. But unlike in the three previous seasons, it no longer matters. \nFor the 14th consecutive time, the Broncos jumped into a boiling caldron and climbed out with an AFC West road victory, choking out the Raiders 16-10 on Sunday with a stifling defense. \nOakland tapped out when Chris Harris took off. The Broncos cornerback secured the 5-0 start with a 74-yard interception return for a touchdown with 6:53 remaining in the fourth quarter. \n\"I saw the crossing routes, and I looked up and saw Chris just running down the field. If I was mic'd up you would have heard me laughing,\" said cornerback Aqib Talib. \"They were driving and he just took their soul.\" Advertisement \nThis wasn't a bare-knuckle win. It was white-knuckle. The Broncos once again committed forgettable penalties and made maddening mistakes, among them a pair of interceptions. Manning has thrown seven interceptions in the season's first five games for the first time since 1998 and 1999. The transgressions provided a window of opportunity for the Raiders, but the Broncos' championship-caliber defense slammed it on their fingers. \n\"We have the best secondary in the league, I am telling you,\" Harris said. \"And we treat these division games like championship games. That's why we win them all.\" \nA Manning-led team won for only the fourth time without scoring an offensive touchdown. However, it's the second time this season, joining the season-opening triumph over the Baltimore Ravens. This didn't come down to the last play, only a recovery of the Raiders' onside kick attempt by receiver Demaryius Thomas. \n\"To win two games without scoring an offensive touchdown, that doesn't happen in the National Football League,\" Broncos coach Gary Kubiak said. \"The defense has been tremendous.\" \nIt begins with pressure up front, creating panic. And it finishes with a secondary that possesses tentacles to produce turnovers. \nThree words sum up the Broncos' victory, which moved them to 5-0 and in command in their division: No-fly zone. Harris adopted the slogan as a warning for quarterbacks not to test the Broncos' secondary last season. As they have for a month, the Broncos delivered their biggest play of the game when it mattered most. They received some good fortune with a pair of missed field goals by Oakland's Sebastian Janikowski, but there's nothing lucky about the defense. Or Harris. \nWith the Raiders driving for a potential go-ahead a score, Raiders quarterback Derek Carr tapped his feet, looking for an open target 5 yards downfield. Receiver Seth Roberts streaked across the middle, appearing open. Carr threw behind Roberts. \n\"They brought pressure. I was throwing to my hot receiver, and I didn't execute,\" Carr said. \nRoberts hails from West Alabama, the same school as New England Patriots Super Bowl savior Malcolm Butler. Roberts failed to deliver a miracle finish, watching helplessly as Harris snared the errant pass and created a vapor trail to the end zone. \n\"I have never played on a defense like this, and I have never played in a secondary like this. We expect to shut the other team out every week,\" safety T.J. Ward said. \"A lot of teams say that. But we believe it. We are looking to shut you down and score.\" \nThe Orange Rush's fingerprints — the team is on pace for a franchise record 70 sacks — remain smudged all over the Broncos' season. Harris' interception return represented the defense's third touchdown this season, more than running backs Ronnie Hillman and C.J. Anderson combined. The Broncos' offense ran for only 43 yards, and compromised the defense with Manning's two interceptions to Charles Woodson. \n\"We have to play a (heck) of a lot better,\" Kubiak said. \"It starts with me, the offensive coach. The sad thing is that we do some stuff, but we don't finish anything.\" \nWithout the defense, the division winning streak ends in Oakland. The unit, which welcomed back defensive end Derek Wolfe from suspension, but lost defensive end DeMarcus Ware to a back injury, proved the difference in the second half. \nThe Broncos secured their first lead on back-to-back possessions. Von Miller set up the first of Brandon McManus' second-half field goals with a strip sack. Manning, who was intercepted in the end zone in the first half on arguably his worst throw of the season, zipped a pass through Thomas' hands in the back of the end zone. \nThe next possession shoved Denver ahead 9-7 as McManus nailed a 52-yarder. Woodson celebrated \"veteran's day,\" providing the raucous crowd hope with the second interception of Manning moments later. \nThe Raiders played just well enough to lose. They have dropped eight straight to the Broncos. Manning never has lost to Oakland. But more salient on this sun-bleached afternoon, Harris never has lost a division road game. He received the only game ball from the coaching staff. \nAfter all, he scored the only touchdown. \n\"Oh my God! What a defense we have. Everyone can make plays,\" Ware said. \"What you are seeing is real.\" The quarters First quarter \nFoes are still scoreless against the Broncos' defense in the first 15 minutes. The Broncos preserved the streak when Sylvester Williams blocked Sebastian Janikowski's 38-yard field-goal attempt. Second quarter \nTrailing 3-0 after Brandon McManus' field goal, the Raiders responded with an eight play, 80-yard TD drive. It featured two big passing plays - 21 yards to Amari Cooper and a 33-yarder to Clive Walford on a blown coverage. Third quarter \nThe Broncos secured their first lead on back-to-back possessions. Given a short field after Von Miller's strip sack, the Broncos settled for a 20-yard field goal. The next possession shoved Denver ahead 9-7 when McManus nailed a 52-yarder. Fourth quarter \nThe Broncos extended their NFL record of divisional road wins to 14. Cornerback Chris Harris delivered the Broncos' third defensive TD on a 74-yard interception return. The Broncos won without an offensive TD for the second time this season. Massive sack attack \nDenver made four sacks Sunday, giving it 22 for the season. The team record is 57 (1984). The league record is 72 (1984 Chicago Bears). The Broncos are on pace for 70. \nWeek 1 win over Ravens — Two sacks. Brandon Marshall and DeMarcus Ware made key third-down sacks to force punts. \nWeek 2 win over Chiefs — Five sacks. Five players got on the board harassing Kansas City quarterback Alex Smith all game. \nWeek 3 win over Lions — Four sacks. DeMarcus Ware made 1.5 sacks giving Matt Stafford nightmares. \nWeek 4 win over Vikings — Seven sacks. T.J. Ward made two sacks including a strip sack to end the game. \nWeek 5 win over Raiders — Four sacks. Von Miller's strip sack turned around Oakland's momentum and led to the go-ahead Broncos field goal. \n— Cameron Wolfe, The Denver Post Get sports news and updates right in your inbox \nSign up to receive news alerts and a daily roundup of all things Colorado sports delivered to your inbox.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T08:12:27.861+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
