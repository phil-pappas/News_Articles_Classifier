Coleman had two tackles and keyed a Portland State secondary that limited North Dakota to 136 yards passing.\nHere's the sixth installment of Coleman's 2015 Portland State football diary:\nThis one hurts.\nWe knew it was going to be an absolute battle. North Dakota is an extremely tough and disciplined team. We could only make very minimal mistakes if we wanted to come out on top, and we just made one too many. It is tough to come up with words after a loss, but this will only make us stronger.\nAs the game got going, it became apparent it was going to be a defensive battle. We caught them off guard the first play of the game with a long touchdown pass to snag the momentum. But as both defenses got settled in, the overall offense slowed down. They were not very pass heavy, but they executed the run very well. It was a hard hitting, helmet to helmet type of game.\nThere is not much we can do but move on. I have full faith in our guys that we will keep working harder and harder. Every week I touch on how our mindset does not change. And I will stay true to those words even after a loss. We put ourselves in position to win the game, but some of the plays did not go our way.\nAfter the game, our quarterback Alex Kuresa told us to remember how this feels, and to let that feeling drive us and make sure it does not happen again. Personally, I have not felt like that in a while, and that feeling will definitely drive me to be better then I ever have before.\nThe worst thing about losing is seeing your brothers down. You go through the week and compete with every ounce of energy during practice, watch hours of film, and talk through strategy until it is no longer possible. And to see all of this work not result the way we wanted, it makes it sting that much more.\nAs week 5 arrives, our excitement and motivation will not die down. We are in a very tough conference, and every game from here on out will be a war. We have one day to sit and think about the loss, then it is on to the next week. We have another chance to show what we are made of. And this will be a defining moment in our season. People will be able to see how we bounce back from a loss. Another week means another opportunity, and that is all we need.\nWe get to travel down to Denton, Texas, where we will face the North Texas Mean Green on Saturday . They are a tough team who is looking for a win on their home field. It is a team we are not very familiar with, but we will do nothing other than play our tough, blue-collar, fundamental football.\nIt was a rough day (Saturday), but I would not want to go though that with anyone else. I love my brothers and I cannot wait to see how we respond next week.\n-- Check back every Monday for the latest installment of Xavier Coleman's Portland State football diary", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T22:43:12.229+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
