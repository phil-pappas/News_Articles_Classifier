(AP) â€” Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump is denouncing the outside political action committees supporting his candidacy, demanding they return the money they've collected, and calling on his opponents to do the same.\nTrump's campaign announced Friday that its counsel had sent legal notices to a handful of what they describe as \"unauthorized\" super PACs supporting his bid, demanding they return any money they've raised in support of his candidacy.\n\"I am self-funding my campaign and therefore I will not be controlled by the donors, special interests and lobbyists who have corrupted our politics and politicians for far too long,\" Trump said in a statement announcing the effort. \"I have disavowed all super PAC's, requested the return of all donations made to said PAC's, and I am calling on all Presidential candidates to do the same.\"\nThe announcement comes after a series of negative reports by The Washington Post pointing to connections between Mike Ciletti, who was running the super PAC Make America Great Again, and Trump's campaign. Ciletti confirmed in an email Friday the PAC is planning to cease operations following the scrutiny.\nThe paper reported that the PAC appeared to have used contact information provided by a Trump aide to contact potential donors.\nTrump's campaign has also been working with two companies associated with Ciletti, according to campaign finance and business records, the paper reported. And Trump appeared at several of the PACs events, including what the campaign described at the time as a meet-and-greet at Trump's daughter's in-laws home over the summer.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T17:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:04:44.833+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
