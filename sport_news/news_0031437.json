The rating was not immediately available. \nExcluding games on MLB Network, the Rangers’ win ranks as the least-watched MLB playoff telecast since Game 2 of the 2012 Reds/Giants NLDS (1.5M) — a game on TNT that overlapped with Yankees/Orioles on TBS (4.2M). Keep in mind the game had only one home market, as Toronto does not factor into U.S. television ratings. Dallas-Ft. Worth drew a 6.6 for the game, a local record on FS1. \nLast year’s Division Series openers on FS1, which took place on a Friday, drew a 1.3 and 2.0 million (Giants/Nationals) and a 2.2 and 3.6 million (Cardinals/Dodgers).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:04:53.987+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
