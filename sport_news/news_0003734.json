Comment Posted Oct. 23, 2015 at 2:00 PM Updated Oct 23, 2015 at 2:29   23, 2015 at 2:00 PM Updated Oct 23, 2015 at 2:29 PM As the 2015 high school volleyball campaign enters the post-season, this year's format has made a return to the past. There are still four classes this season, that part has not changed. However for the first time since 2007, the first year of the four class system, subsectionals are being used. Instead of being divided into four regionals for seeding, teams are divided into two subsectionals and seeded before being separated into two regionals. Teams in The Voice area will be taking part in regional play at three locations next week (records through Thursday): CLASS 3A Area team: Macomb (18-16). Other teams: Limestone (29-5-1), Dunlap (12-17), Monmouth-Roseville (13-18) and Illinois Valley Central (4-20). The Lady Bombers will make the 90-mile trip to Chillicothe Tuesday for a 7 p.m. semifinal contest against Dunlap. Macomb is seeded fourth with Dunlap fifth. Sixth-seeded Monmouth-Roseville will face eighth-seeded and host IVC Monday at 6 p.m. with the winner facing top-seeded Limestone Tuesday in a 6 p.m. semifinal. The title match is set for Thursday at 6 p.m. “Everyone's record right now is 0-0,” said Macomb coach Briana Rexroat. “We've got a whole new start now. We've got to come in at practice, be ready to go and bring that intensity with us, even though we are at the end of the year, because anything is possible in the post-season.” Macomb has won four of its last five matches, including   win against Mendon Unity in the regular season finale Wednesday. “We needed this win to head into post-season with some confidence,” said Rexroat. It is the fourth season in Class 3A for Macomb, which reached the final in 2012. MHS has a 3-3 record in regional play, losing to the eventual regional champ all three previous years. The winner advances to sectional play at Bartonville (Limestone). CLASS 2A Area team: Rushville-Industry (16-14). Other teams: Deer Creek-Mackinaw (21-8), Tremont (16-11), Midwest Central, Havana and Illini Central. After falling short in a regional final a year ago, the Lady Rockets carry a four seed into this year's regional that will be played in Manito. Defending Class 2A state champion Deer Creek-Mackinaw is the top seed. Monday's opening round matches will have No. 7 seed and host Midwest Central playing No. 10 seed Havana at 6 p.m. No. 5 seed Tremont will then face No. 11 seed Illini Central. Tuesday's semifinal will have Deer Creek-Mackinaw facing the Midwest Central/Havana winner at 6 p.m. Rushville-Industry will then play the Tremont/Illini Central winner at 7 p.m. The title contest is slated for Thursday at 7 p.m. “Our regional is not going to be easy for us to get out of,” said RIHS coach Leigh Bickerman. “But I think if everybody is healthy and we show up ready to play each and every night, no matter who's on the other side (of the net), we've got a chance.” Rushville-Industry has posted a 7-4 record so far in October. Losses to West Prairie and Beardstown came this past week with middle hitter Erin Rittenhouse sidelined with an ankle injury. She is expected to be back in the lineup for Tuesday's semifinal. “Even though it's not going to be an easy task, I think they're going to be ready for it,” said Bickerman. “We'll see what happens. “That's one thing about this group, they are not going to give up,” she added. “They're not going to back down.” The winner of the Manito regional will advances to sectional play at Pleasant Plains. CLASS 1A Area teams: West Prairie (22-7), Bushnell-Prairie City (8-23) and South Fulton (4-25). Other teams: Southeastern (30-3), Lewistown (20-9-2) and Triopia/Virginia. At Astoria, Southeastern and West Prairie are the top two seeds in a potential rematch for a regional title. Southeastern and West Prairie have squared off for regional championships each of the last two years. West Prairie won 25-18, 26-24 in 2013 at Astoria. The Lady Suns won 25-18, 23-25, 25-19 last year at Augusta. This season, the two teams played back on October 7 at Sciota with Southeastern winning 25-19, 16-25, 25-17. “I'm cautiously optimistic,” said West Prairie coach Teri Paul. “I think we've got a great shot at it if we have a high-level match. “It's going to be a game of inches,” she added. “You can't bring a 'B' game, you have to bring a great one. That's the way it should be in the post-season. The best teams should, hopefully, play well.” The Lady Cyclones have played in a regional final every season since the four-class system began in 2007, posting a 3-4 record in those contests. Meanwhile, four other teams that look to play spoiler open regional action Monday. No. 7 seed Triopia/Virginia will face No. 8 seed B-PC to start regional play at 6 p.m. Despite dropping its last six matches entering regional play, B-PC coach Stephanie Harrison has been pleased with the team's effort. “I am very pleased with and proud of our level of play at this point in the season,” she said. “This group has worked extremely hard all season long, and it definitely shows. Our game has improved a great deal since we began in August. “In order for us to be successful in the post-season, we need to make sure that we continue to work together and play as a team,” Harrison added. “In addition, we must remain positive, while being intense. When those things happen, success follows.” The winner of Monday's match will face top-seeded Southeastern in Tuesday's 6 p.m. semifinal. “From day one, I have told the girls to play our game every time we step on the court,” said Harrison. “I also encourage them to 'play to win' as opposed to 'playing not to lose,' regardless of the seed or the opponent.” Meanwhile, No. 10 seed and host South Fulton will face No. 5 seed Lewistown in Monday's second match at 7 p.m. It will be the third meeting between the two teams with Lewistown winning the first two contests. “If we handle it well, we can put ourselves in a position to be real competitive with them,” said South Fulton coach Greg Gaither. “I'm not unrealistic. We need to take this at a very simple pace,” he added. “We've got to fight them for every single point and try to get ahead and get on them. If we can get on them, get them rattled a little bit, take them out of their hitting game, which I think we can, then we have a chance to beat them.” The winner gets to face No. 4 seed West Prairie in a 7 p.m. semifinal Tuesday. The Lady Cyclones beat both teams in Prairieland Conference contests during the season. “It's not like we have anything to lose,” said Gaither. The semifinal winners will play for the title Thursday at 6 p.m. The winner of the Astoria regional will advance to sectional play at Lewistown.
