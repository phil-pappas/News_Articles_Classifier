Mrunmayi Saoji seems to be following this golden secret of success this season. \n\nAfter achieving outstanding success in the state tournament, Mrunmayi did well in the West Zone Inter-State Badminton Championship which concluded at the DY Patil Indoor Stadium in Mumbai on Friday. \n\nFirst Mrunmayi helped Maharashtra finish runners-up in the team championship where the hosts narrowly lost to Madhya Pradesh 2-3. Later in the individual event, Mrunmayi excelled too. \n\nThe pair of Mrunmayi and Akshaya Warang secured second place in the U-19 girls doubles category. The second seeded duo of Nagpur-Greater Mumbai went down fighting against the top seeds Emilia Silveira and Pranjal Chimulkar of Goa. State U-19 girls doubles champions Mrunmayi and Akshaya fought hard but lost the close match 20-22, 17-21 in 27 minutes. \n\nEarlier in the semifinal on Thursday, Mrunmayi and Akshay dismissed Dipti Kuity and Salvi Shah of Gujarat 21-13, 21-20 to storm into the final. \n\nAlthough, Mrunmayi and Akshaya failed to cross the last hurdle, they clinched the berth for the forthcoming Junior National Badminton Championship which will be held at Jaipur from November 30 to December 6. Both the finalists will be eligible to play in the junior nationals from the West Zone quota. \n\nMrunmayi has already qualified to play in the U-19 girls singles at Jaipur as the state singles champion. The eighteen-year-old had triumphed at Karad and Latur earlier this season. \n\n\"I am happy to seal doubles berth for Jaipur but equally disappointed for not winning the West Zone crown. We did not play well in the final, otherwise we would have definitely emerged champions. In the team event final too, we missed the title by a whisker,\" Mrunmayi told TOI on Friday. \n\nA Standard XII student of Shivaji Science College will be skipping the Krishna Khaitan memorial All India Junior Ranking tournament scheduled to begin at Chandigarh from October 12 and will instead practice hard for the Jaipur junior nationals.
