The junior was expected to see a hand specialist Thursday.\nGroce said he wasn't sure about the extent of the injury or whether Nunn had broken a bone. It wasn't clear how long Nunn will be out.\nSophomore forward Leron Black had knee surgery earlier this month that is expected to keep him out up to six weeks. Freshman guard Jalen Coleman-Lands is out with a stress fracture but expected back by the Nov. 13 opener against North Florida.
