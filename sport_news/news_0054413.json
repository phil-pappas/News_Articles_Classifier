Gurkeerat Singh made an unbeaten 201, while wicketkeeper Gitansh Khera (102*), Uday Kaul (112) and Mandeep Singh (109 also recorded centuries in Punjab's first innings.\nBy virtue of this win, Punjab pocketed seven points, including two bonus points from the match while Raiways returned empty-handed.\nBrief Scores: Punjab 604/5d in 171.1 overs beat Railways 196 & 282 all out in 68 overs (f/o) (Arindam Ghosh 98*; Varun Khanna 8/97) by an innings & 126 runs.\nPoints: Punjab 7, Railways 0 ", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-05T01:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T13:02:53.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
