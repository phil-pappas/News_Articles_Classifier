We’re happy to have him.” \nFreeman earned first-team all-Midwest Conference North Division honors as a pitcher in the spring. \nWhenever he could, Freeman would swing by spring football practices to watch. \nThe former Fox River Classic Conference linebacker of the year wasn’t sure what position he would play when August rolled around. He just knew he wasn’t going to take the opportunity to play football again for granted. \n“The first time putting on pads was a little different,” Freeman said. “But I’d say after one practice it just came back to me. It felt normal.” \nFreeman initially was thinking about going to the University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh and playing football after high school. However, he decided to attend UW-Stevens Point as a freshman and play baseball. \nThe right-handed pitcher transferred to St. Norbert as a sophomore. He went 13-8 with 135 strikeouts over 189 ⅔ innings pitched in three seasons, which included helping the Green Knights advance to the NCAA Division III Midwest Regional in 2014. \n“With his age and maturity comes a sense of calmness,” McCarty said. “He’s still learning our offense. But he sees the big picture. He doesn’t get frazzled if he has a bad play or a bad practice. I think you get that with maturity.” \nFreeman has played on special teams in addition to making three catches for 45 yards during the football team’s 3-0 start. \nTrailing 31-28 at North Park (Ill.) University on Sept. 12, Freeman caught a 20-yard pass from Jack Becker on a fourth-and-9 in the final minute to help extend a drive. \n“That was a huge play for us to go in then and score the go-ahead touchdown,” McCarty said about the conversion in a 41-31 road victory. “He’s been a tremendous asset. \n“I kind of think of him as a freshman because this is his first season playing college football. You can see each game he’s getting more comfortable out there.” \nFreeman doesn’t think he would have been comfortable on campus this fall had he not decided to play football. \n“When I was thinking about coming back to play football, I talked to my parents about it because they’re definitely a big influence in my life,” Freeman said. “They said, ‘You’re only in college once. If you look back 20 years from now, you’re not going to regret playing football. You’d regret not playing football.’ That’s how I looked at it.” \napekarek@pressgazettemedia.com and follow him on Twitter @andrewpekarek. 135 CONNECT 4 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://gbpg.net/1KPDAbQ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T17:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:24:16.328+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
