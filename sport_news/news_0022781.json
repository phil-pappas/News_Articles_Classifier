(Dopey, grimacing smile) \nClemson hands The U its worse loss ever and stays undefeated -- the ACC's best looks even better: Hot stuff! \nMiami's Al Golden's job status? Stinks, much like his team's performance this week: Scent-sational (says the steaming skunk) \nThe Yellow Jackets' block-six gave Florida State its first ACC loss in 1113 days. That's sure to leave a sting on the Seminoles but for Georgia Tech: Bee-utiful! \nPitt leads the Coastal Division at 4-0 but the 6-1 start isn't too surprising: Ex-squeeze me?! \nLouisville held on to beat Boston College 17-14. Bobby Petrino's rebuild?: Go for it! (motorcycle to for a smoother ride, coach?) \nPerhaps next week we'll do football analysis with Lisa Frank rainbows and unicorns.
