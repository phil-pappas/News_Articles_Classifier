Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 6:07 pm Late Hits: Notes from Friday night's high school football games \nTerry Sanford \nAndrew Jayne approached Terry Sanford coach Bryan Till during Friday night's game at Lee County and alerted him to a quirk in the Yellow Jackets' pass coverage that might pay off at some point for the Bulldogs. \nOn the first play of the fourth quarter, Till decided to take advantage of it. On fourth-and-24 from the Yellow Jackets' 34, Andrew's twin brother, Terry Sanford quarterback Christian Jayne, threw a perfectly placed outside-shoulder pass on the sideline for a touchdown that proved to be the difference in the Bulldogs' 28-21 win. \nIt was the second time this season that the brothers have connected for a score. But this one was easily the biggest. \n\"That was a clutch play,\" Till said. \"No doubt, that was probably one of the biggest plays of the night.\" \nGray's Creek \nThe last of Calvin Boyd's three touchdowns in the Bears' 35-14 win over Southern Lee was a 96-yard breakaway that pulled the Bears out of a dangerous spot. \nSouthern Lee had just scored on its previous drive, and the Cavs' kickoff left the Bears to start their drive at their own 10-yard line. After a false start and a pair of ineffective run plays, the Bears faced third-and-16 from the 4. \nQuarterback Trent Agee handed the ball off to Boyd, who found a clearing through the middle of the offensive line and room through the Southern Lee secondary. \nHis touchdown put the Bears ahead by three touchdowns with 5:27 left to play. \nCape Fear \nWhile defense took center stage for Cape Fear in its 14-13 win over defending Mid-South 4-A Conference champion Seventy-First, quarterback Justice Galloway-Velazquez had another solid game for the Colts. \nHis rushing numbers were a little down as he was held to 93 yards, but he hurt the Falcons through the air, completing 9 of 19 passes for 154 yards. \nHis passing yards were spread among five receivers with Montell Moore catching three for 47 yards. \nSeventy-First \nWith Friday's 14-13 loss to Cape Fear, the Falcons continued a recent history of frustration against the Colts. \nOver the last four years, Seventy-First's only win against Cape Fear was in 2014, when it played at Cape Fear and won 21-11. \nThe other three times, Cape Fear won, twice by the same score of 14-13. The other Colt win was 15-12 in 2012. \nDouglas Byrd \nThe Eagles needed something to provide a spark to their offense and for the last two weeks they've definitely found it in the form of running back Kevin Sparks. \nFor the first time in the head coaching tenure of Scott Barbour, Byrd has a winning streak of two games after beating Union Pines 35-28. \nIn his last two contests, Sparks has rushed for 390 yards and five touchdowns. \nThe Eagles are 3-5, their most wins in Barbour's two years as coach, and with a 2-1 Cape Fear Valley 3-A Conference record have a shot at earning a state playoff berth if they can win at least one more game. \nSouth View \nPassing has been the main source of offense for South View much of this season, but running back Keyonis Hopkins stepped back into the limelight with a solid performance against Pine Forest in a 21-18 loss. \nHopkins rushed for 98 yards in 17 attempts and got all three of the Tiger touchdowns, two rushing and one receiving. \nHe contributed to the passing game as well with three catches for 53 yards. \nPine Forest \nWith starting quarterback Julian Hill out for the season with a torn ACL, Pine Forest needed someone to step up and take charge at quarterback against South View. \nReserve quarterback Earl Gaddis delivered, leading the Trojans to a 21-18 win. He completed 9 of 21 passes for 121 yards, throwing one interception. He scored Pine Forest's second touchdown on a 1-yard run. \nThe Trojans got some help from an 85-yard kickoff return by Raymond Owens and a Ford Davenport 35-yard interception return for a touchdown. \nTrinity Christian \nTrinity Christian's three-game winning streak came to an end with a tough 12-8 loss to visiting High Point Christian. \nTrinity had trouble moving the ball, rushing and passing. Malik Brown, who got Trinity's only touchdown, had 94 yards rushing while Rafe Morian passed for 74 yards and threw three interceptions. \nTrinity visits city rival Village Christian this week. \nFayetteville Christian \nFayetteville Christian coach Greg Bryant said the Grace Crossing school his team faced Friday was much like Fayetteville Christian, short on numbers and dealing with a tough season. The result was the biggest win of the year for Fayetteville, 42-0. \n\"It feels great,'' Bryant said. \"We've won three games and we have a legitimate chance of having a winning season.'' \nBryant said Fayetteville has ditched the spread offense for an old-school wishbone attack. \"We ran a lot of option and everything seemed to work,'' he said. \nBryant praised the play of Desmond Jones and Malik Grady. \"They both had great games, offensively and defensively,'' he said. \nJack Britt \nThe 42-12 final score might seem like a dominating wipeout. The way Jack Britt silenced E.E. Smith's potent 1-2 running attack of Vaughn Covington and Unique Johnson might turn some heads in Cumberland County, as well. \nDid the Buccaneers expect to hold the Golden Bulls to 12 points? \n\"No, sir,\" said Bucs defensive lineman Bryan \"Biscuit\" Bryant. \"We weren't expecting them to score at all.\" \nSo, Jack Britt will go into a bye week licking its wounds after allowing Covington to run for a whopping 19 yards in the second half while Johnson ran roughshod for 35. \nGood problem to have, right? \n\"They were pretty disappointed to give up 12 points in the first half,\" Britt coach Brian Rimpf said. \"But they came out and responded.\" \nE.E. Smith \nIt was a disappointing outcome for E.E. Smith, but Golden Bulls coach Ernest King found Friday's 42-12 loss to Jack Britt informative. \n\"(Britt) loaded the box and said, 'Hey, throw the ball,'\" King said. \"That's something we need to get better at.\" \nBulls quarterback Vaughn Covington ran for 129 yards, but only 19 came in the second half. With the run game smothered, the Bulls turned to the air, but mustered just 16 passing yards after halftime. Overall, Covington completed 4 of 16 passes and was intercepted twice. \n\"We're going to go back to the drawing board,\" King said. \"We need to get healthy, but when all things are said and done, I still have a good ball club and we can still make some noise in the conference.\" \n- A staff report", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T07:48:50.017+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
