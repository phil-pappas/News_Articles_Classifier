(Photo by Vyto Starinskas) Greg MacAfee Reporter COTTONWOOD - It was listed as one of the top games to watch going into Friday by azcentral.com. The Mingus Union Marauders (#22) were set to take on the Bradshaw Mountain Bears (#9). The freshman game earlier in the week set the tone, and the varsity game on Friday lived up to the hype. With 5:27 left in the fourth quarter the final Marauder points came off the foot of junior kicker Trey Meyer when he booted a 29-yard field goal to put the Marauders up 20-9. It wasn't over yet though. The Bears marched down the field, and with 3-minutes left, they put six more points on the board. BMHS quarterback Gunner Bundrick found his senior wideout David Otero for a 20-yard pass-and-catch. After a failed two-point conversion for the Bears, the Marauders went home with the win and the upset.The game was scoreless through the first quarter, both teams battling to get on the scoreboard first. At the 10:30 mark of the second quarter, senior Anthony Accurso answered the call for the Marauders. Accurso, who ran for 99-yards Friday night, broke off a 45-yard run that ended with him in the endzone and six points on the board. The Marauders had struck first in the Division III matchup. Trey Meyer tacked on the extra point and the Marauders were up 7-0. The Bears struck back though. With 44-seconds to go in the half, Bradshaw kicker Matt Tomayo booted a 25-yard field goal to get the Bears on the board before half time. Mingus came out strong in the second half, scoring twice and not allowing the Bears to put any more points on the board until there was 3:15 left in the third quarter. With 10:55 left in the third, Trey Meyer booted his first field goal of the night from 31-yards out to put the Marauders up 10-3. It was Alec Phyfer who extended the Marauders lead even more, when he bullied his way into the endzone from 3-yards out. Meyer tacked on the extra point and the Marauders took a 17-3 lead. The Bears answered when Bundrick found wide out Brandon Comeno for a 75-yard touchdown pass that put the score at 17-9, after a missed PAT attempt by the Bears.It was an all-around team win for the Marauders as they continue to prove that they belong in the Division III playoff picture. Phyfer led the way on the ground for the Marauders, carrying the ball 20 times for a game-high 118 yards. Accurso continues to excel for the Marauders offense. He carried the ball six times against the Bears and tallied 99 yards. Accurso also had the only reception of the game for the Marauders, hauling in a 21-yard pass. The Marauders carried the ball 59 times throughout the game on Friday splitting the carries between six runners. Senior quarterback Jordan Upham carried the ball 13 times for 27 yards and senior Tristan Clark added 6 carries for 41 yards for the Marauders. It was another great performance by the Marauders on the defensive side of the ball as well, as they had 65 total tackles, three sacks, forced two fumbles, and deflected 11 passes. Sophomore Tyler Kelly acted as the Bears worst nightmare Friday night. The younger of the Kelly brothers got to the quarterback twice, forced two fumbles, and had nine total tackles. The older Kelly brother, Pete, finished with two more tackles than his kin, and also carried the ball five times for ten yards on the offensive side of the ball. Jordan Vincent tallied up the third sack of the game for the Marauders, bringing down the Bears quarterback for a 28-yard loss. Jordan Upham added eight tackles for the Marauders and led the Mingus pass defense with three deflections. Jose Pacheco, Josh Scalf, Alejandro Stabreff, Accurso and Clark all broke up passes for the Marauders as well. After defeating the #9 Bradshaw Mountain Bears the Marauders will more than likely move up in the AIA Division III rankings this week as they get set to take on the Coconino Panthers. The Panthers were ranked #39 in the first rankings of the year last week. The Panthers suffered a 61-12 loss to Prescott (#27) on Friday. Kickoff is set for approximately 7 p.m. on Friday. -- Follow Greg Macafee on Twitter @greg_macafee and Instagram @VerdeValleyNews", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T23:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T21:35:09.956+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
