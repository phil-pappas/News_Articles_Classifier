(Photo: Austin Humphreys/The Coloradoan) \nTime to get back on track. \nThe Fort Collins High School football team is off to a disappointing 1-3 start to the season. \nKey injuries have set back the Lambkins and the offense has sputtered. Coming to town for a nonconference game Thursday is an inconsistent Loveland (2-2) team. \nHere are keys to Thursday’s 6 p.m. game at French Field. \nTo win, Loveland must: Unleash Eberhardt. It’s not complicated, but having your best player play great is a good way to win. Senior quarterback Ayden Eberhardt completes 60 percent of his passes for 135 yards a game. He also runs for 112 per game. \nHe also has a great complimentary piece in Charles Dunkelman , who runs for 85 yards a game and leads the Indians in tackles. If those two have big games, it will lead Loveland to a road win. \nTo win, Fort Collins must: Just find a way. The Lambkins path to the playoffs is to win the Northern Conference, with league play starting next week. But a nonconference win Thursday is necessary for the Lambkins. In the big picture, this game doesn’t mean much for the Lambkins. Fort Collins likely won’t be able to earn an at-large berth into the 16-team Class 4A playoff field. \nThey need to get back on track and gain the confidence a win brings. So run the offense through Kielar Harpham in the wildcat. Sling it around with Cory Lange . Run 30 times with Sam Bostak and Luke Weaver . Run exotic defenses at Loveland. Whatever the method is, just find a way back into the win column. \nFollow sports reporter Kevin Lytle at twitter.com/Kevin_Lytle and at facebook.com/KevinSLytle. \nWeek 5 local football schedule \nThursday: Loveland at Fort Collins, 6 p.m. at French Field.
