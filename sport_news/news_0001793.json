He's done a nice job. He's been dialed in, and it's really good,” Swinney said. Greg (Huegel) has earned the trust and has been very consistent. Now, you've got another guy in there who's been there and done that. I'm glad that he's going to do the kickoffs. I think that takes a little bit of pressure off of Greg. Then, as far as the field goals, we'll keep rolling. Hopefully, it will be the Wally Pip story, but who knows. Hopefully, he'll keep performing, but if not we feel good about Ammon and what he's done in practice.” \nSwinney said Wednesday’s practice was more of what he likes to see after a lethargic Tuesday practice. \n“Today was very, very good. Yesterday was a little lethargic, especially offensively,” he said. “ I thought we were kind of sloshing around. A lot of that goes to the scout team as well. Today was a completely different mentality on both sides. We got better today. Practice was really good. It starts with the scouts. Those guys were dialed in, and gave us a good look. I thought they came with the right mentality today.” \nOTHER NOTES \nHow do you make sure the team hasn’t peaked early this week? \n“It's not different than any other game. They're not ready to play because we're not finished with our preparation. If we were finished with our preparation today and we had to sit around and wait til Saturday, that might be difficult. Tomorrow is a big work day for us. Friday is a big work day. Saturday is critical. We have a schedule for night games. We have a schedule for afternoon games. A schedule for morning games as far as how we get them ready. We don't vary from that. It's just business as usual for us. There's nothing wrong with being excited to play. They're excited to play if nothing else than we haven't played in two Saturdays. They're anxious to get back to work and so are we as coaches.” \nInjury report \n“We're going to cut him ( Dane Rogers Dane Rogers #85 6-3, 269Shelby, NC View Full Profile ) loose on Monday. We're not going to have him available this weekend. The plan is to put him back at practice at Monday. Ryan Norton Ryan Norton #58 6-3, 284Simpsonville, SC View Full Profile is much better. We're encouraged with him. He's responding well. Everybody responds differently to rehab, but Danny (Poole) is very encouraged with what he's seen. He's still not ready to play this week. We'll see where he is next week, but my guess is he's probably not going to be ready next week. I think he's got a pretty good chance for Boston College. Joe Gore and Jake Fruhmorgen have practiced all week.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T08:14:56.022+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
