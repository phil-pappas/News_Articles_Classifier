Saturday’s game is sold out. \n“I’ve never been in an environment that was that loud,” outside linebacker Jordan Jenkins said. “You could feel the vibrations, you could feel the bass. They had just got the Lil Jon and the third down for what thing. They were playing that constantly. I had never been in a venue like that and played in a game like that.” \nThe offense has to contend with the crowd noise more because it affects verbal communication, but the defense notices it, too. \n“It was loud,” nose guard Chris Mayes remembered. “I looked around. I’ve never seen so much orange in my life. I was actually hating it. It was so bright.” \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:13:58.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
