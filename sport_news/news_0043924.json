We wanted to make sure he got to the game if we could.\"\nThe last-minute audible allowed McClain to play in a 49-14 loss and continue recovering from a tough time in his life, a process that will continue this weekend when UNT faces Portland State in its 4 p.m. homecoming game.\n\"It was a big conference game, and I wanted to be there for my teammates,\" McClain said. \"I had a death in the family, but I couldn't let that stop me. If I had a chance to get to the game, I was going to do what it I could to make that work.\"\nA private flight was the only option UNT had to get one of its top players to the game in time. UNT worked with the NCAA to make sure that no rules were broken and reimbursed the Featherstones for helping out one of its players in need.\nThe Featherstones were planning on taking a two-seat Grumman before upgrading to a Cessna 421, a twin engine, eight-seat plane, to make sure they had enough room for McClain to be comfortable.\nThe couple brought lunch and picked McClain up about 2 p.m. in Lockhart, a quick 15-mile drive from Luling.\n\"He didn't seem nervous about the flight,\" Tony Featherstone said. \"He seemed preoccupied with the funeral and was focused on getting ready for the game. He was really quiet.\"\nMcClain was focused on the game and remembering his grandfather, who played a key role in his life after his father died in a car accident when he was in the second grade.\nIra McClain made his grandson egg sandwiches every morning -- one of the small memories Kishawn McClain cherishes -- and was sure to teach him about life.\n\"He was a good man who I respected,\" McClain said. \"He taught me a lot, including how to be a great young man, and was always there for me. He showed me how to go down the right road in life and to be respectful of my elders and those around me.\"\nHonoring his grandfather and being at the funeral with his family were important to McClain.\nThanks to the Featherstones, McClain had a chance to play against Southern Miss as well and finished with seven tackles, pushing his total to a team-high 42.\n\"None of us can imagine the roller-coaster of emotions and how hard it must have been to go out there and play hard for his teammates,\" UNT coach Dan McCarney said. \"I'm really proud of him.\"\nMargaret Featherstone felt the same way after lending a hand to one of the Victory Hall residents she has helped care for.\n\"This is Kishawn's second year here, so I feel really close to him,\" Margaret Featherstone said. \"They are all my kiddos. I care about them all very much.\"\nTwitter: @brettvito\nOn Twitter:\n @brettvito", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/brettvito"], "published": "2015-10-09T02:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:07:01.514+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
