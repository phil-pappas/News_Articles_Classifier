Police did not rule out arrest or further summons.\nDigvijaya was quizzed for close to five hours from 11 am to 4 pm. Police were ready to fire 272 questions on fraudulent recruitments and undue benefits provided to 17 people in assembly during his tenure as chief minister between 1993 and 2003. However, they could ask only 94 questions on record.\nSome questions were prepared in written, while rest were shot randomly. The entire inquiry proceedings were video-graphed. Police said during the marathon interrogation, Singh was shown signed note-sheets and documents for making appointments as chief minister. Digvijaya, however, failed to give specific answers to most questions. Police sources said Singh maintained that appointments were legally done through cabinet approval.\nHis supporters burnt effigies of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and shouted slogans \"gali gali me chor hai mama mami chor hai\" outside the police control room. Congress workers were lathicharged by police when they jostled to meet Singh while he was moving out in the evening.\nSingh was accompanied by a Member of Parliament and former ministers, Congress legislators, including his son Jaivardhan Singh, apart from local Congress leaders. They were inside the police control room while questioning continued in chamber of city superintendent of police.\nSingh's advocate, Ajay Gupta, said this is first time a cabinet decision was being investigated as criminal case and that too against a former chief minister. There was no criminal conspiracy or malicious intent and all recruitments were done according to rules, he said.\nThe police control room was sealed to media and visitors. Police ensured Singh and his entourage inside control room were made comfortable.\nTalking to TOI, a senior official said \"Digivijaya tried not to display nervousness, but nobody feels comfortable during interrogation. Police said they would cross-check points given by Singh to decide on further action.\nEarlier, Singh was summoned by police on September 30, seven months after a complaint was lodged against him. But he did not turn up due to his daughter's illness and sought another date after which he was asked to appear on Thursday.\nSingh and former MP Assembly Speaker Sriniwas Tiwari are accused of fraudulently appointing 17 people in Assembly secretariat by \"misusing\" their official position between 1993 and 2003. Altogether, 24 people are accused in the case. Police submitted charge-sheet against 19 accused, including former speaker Sriniwas Tiwari.\nFIR on fraudulent appointments against Digvijaya Singh, Tiwari and others were registered at Jehangirabad police station on February 27 on a complaint filed by Shyam Lal Maithil, deputy secretary in state Assembly.\nHe had submitted a 14-page complaint with police on basis of which a case was lodged. The complaint was based on report of Justice Sachindra Dwivedi Committee which probed irregularities in appointments when Digvijaya Singh was chief minister.\nFormer principal secretary of state Assembly, AK Pyasi, Satya Narayan Sharma, Kamalkant Sharma, Pradeep Mishra, Abha Chaturvedi, Amit Awasthi, Brahmachari Tiwari, Ramesh Dwivedi, Arun Tiwari, Shukramani Mishra, Sharad Dwivedi, Sudhir Tiwari, Anil Mishra, Kuldeep Pandey, Davendra Tiwari, Ramesh Tiwari, Yagya Narayan Sharma, additional secretary, Ramesh Chandra Upadhyay, undersecretary, Shyam Lal Chaturvedi and, Badri Prasad among others have been made accused in the case.\nIn some cases, those appointed became senior officials from daily wagers. Appointments were also made on plain paper without following procedure, the complaint stated.\nFormer speaker Sriniwas Tiwari applied for anticipatory bail, which was granted by court. Police said none of the accused has been in jail as even the ones arrested have got bail.
