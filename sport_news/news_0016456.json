(AP Photo/Frank Augstein) \nLONDON (AP) — Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has criticized the English Football Association after he was fined over comments made towards match officials. \nMourinho used his book launch on Thursday to respond to the FA’s decision on Wednesday to hand him a 50,000 pounds ($77,400) fine and a suspended one-match stadium ban. \nHe claimed that officials were “afraid” to award his side a penalty following a 3-1 home defeat to Southampton in the Premier League at the start of October. \n“50,000 (pounds) is a disgrace. The possibility of getting a stadium ban is astonishing,” Mourinho said at his book signing. \nThe Blues boss was aggrieved after referee Robert Madley refused to point to the spot following a challenge by Saints goalkeeper Martin Stekelenburg on striker Radamel Falcao in the penalty area. \n“He was afraid to give it like everyone else is afraid to give it,” Mourinho said in a post-match interview. \nDefending champion Chelsea has endured a difficult start to the season, losing four of its opening eight matches and languishing in 16th place, 10 points adrift of leaders Manchester City.
