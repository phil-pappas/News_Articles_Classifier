(AP) — A student has apologized for playing a song riddled with racial slurs over the public address system ahead of a Virginia high school football game. \nNajee Lawrence said Thursday night he mistakenly downloaded a song that contained the offensive lyrics, according to media reports. The song was played over the PA system at Glen Allen High School’s football stadium before the suburban school played a Richmond team, Marshall High School, one week ago. \nMarshall is a predominantly black school. \nLawrence is a senior and a member of the Glen Allen football team. He apologized during a Henrico County School Board meeting, saying he was “deeply sorry” for playing the offensive song. \nPrincipal Gwen E. Miller shifted blame for the incident to administrators, who are responsible for reviewing the songs.
