The IAAF said at the time it \"strongly rejects\" the allegations and that it had been long been at the forefront of drug testing. The association pledged earlier this month to ensure more independence in its testing systems and said it was striving to introduce blood passports and new anti-doping measures.\n\"If someone is guilty, this will be proven and the athlete will be punished,\" said Bubka, the 51-year Ukrainian pole vaulting legend. One of the key points in the manifesto by IAAF president Sebastian Coe -- the British track and field star who was elected to head the body in August -- was his desire to establish an independent anti-doping agency, moving away from links with the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:46:29.485+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
