Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 12:36 am Pewitt pounds Bears in Homecoming win By LANCE LUTRELL Tribune corresponder dailytribune.net | 0 comments Pewitt hosted the Dekalb Bears for the 2015 Pewitt Homecoming game and the start of district play. Newly crowned homecoming king Lamon Hillis didn’t disappoint the large crowd as he helped lead the Bulls to a 37-18 win. Hillis had 188 yards on 10 carries with touchdown runs of 69.53 yards and had an interception return of 45 yards for a touchdown. Pewitt started the scoring with 6:28 to go in the first quarter on a 69 yard run by Hillis, and Kolby Slatton ran in the conversion to make the score 8-0 Bulls. Both teams traded punts and LaBrandon Webster scored on an untouched 11 yard run, but conversion failed to make the score 14-0 Brahmas. On the Bears second play of the drive, Pewitt’s Trey Hillis put great pressure on the quarterback and his brother Lamon intercepted the pass and returned it 45 yards for the score. Tyran Betts ran in the point after to make the score 22-0 Bulls with 4:20 to go in the half. The Bears got on the scoreboard right before half on a 13 yard run to end the first half with the score 22-8. Lamon Hillis got the scoring started in the 3rd period with 4:15 left on a nice 53 yard touchdown run and Betts adds run making the score 30-6 Pewitt. Lucas Hungerford finished the scoring with a 36 yard pick six and Lamon Hillis kicked the extra point. Tyran Betts also added 73 yards on 18 carries as the Bulls offense pounded out 330 yards on the ground. Trey Hillis had seven tackles and John Terrell had an interception to lead a stingy Bulls defense. The win brings Pewitt to 3-3 for the year, and 1-0 in district play. Pewitt travels to Queen City next Friday to take on the Bulldogs.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T17:44:45.139+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
