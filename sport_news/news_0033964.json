He has denied wrongdoing and filed an appeal to try to reverse the ban.\nThe paper cited him as saying the ethics committee had forbidden him to speak about FIFA. While surprised by the ban, \"I am doing well and I feel good,\" he told the paper from his flat in Zurich.\nSwiss prosecutors last month opened a criminal investigation of Blatter on suspicions of mismanagement and misappropriation of funds over a television rights contract he signed in 2005 and a 2 million Swiss franc ($2.1 million) payment in 2011 to Michel Platini, president of the UEFA soccer confederation.\nPlatini has also denied any wrongdoing and is fighting to reverse his provisional suspension as well.\n football Sepp Blatter Michel Platini FIFA UEFA President Who after Sepp Blatter? 7 men in race for FIFAâ€™s top job, Indian-American amongst them Loading... Please Wait 1/7 Sunil Gulati, India/USA, 55: Allahabad-born Gulati, who has played a key role in the development of soccer in the United States in the past few decades, could be a potentially strong contender to replace Blatter, should the US have an interest in the position of FIFA chief.

Platini is considered one of the greatest footballers ever, playing 72 times for France and leading them to victory in the 1984 European championships.

Prince Ali may take another shot at the position but he is unlikely to run if his mentor Platini does.

He was the first to declare his candidacy for the 2015 race but had to pull out because he did not get the required five nominations.

He also made no secret that he supported Ali in the recent vote.

In 2004, he was named \"Young Global Leader\" by the World Economic Forum (WEF).

He is seen as too close to Blatter to be a credible alternative.
