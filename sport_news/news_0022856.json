He has described the Dadri incident and opposition to the Ghulam Ali concert as “sad and unwelcome” but added that these have nothing to do with the Central Government. Technically, he is right. Maintaining law and order is a state's duty and not the Centre's responsibility. But the ink attack, the attempts to stop a Pakistani leader's book launch and the forced cancellation of a Pakistani singer's concert are not just state-level concerns. Murder of a writer, a dissenter or a rationalist is not a state-level problem. These incidents have tarnished the image of India as a tolerant society and a liberal, vibrant democracy. However, Prime Minister Modi has chosen to misread the situation at the ground level to suit his politics. Earlier, at an election rally in Bihar, he had advised Hindus and Muslims to fight poverty, not each other. Fortunately, despite provocations from the lunatic fringe, ordinary Hindus and Muslims are not fighting each other. The lynching of Mohammad Akhlaq was not a result of communal tension. It was a result of a mob attack engineered by a BJP worker's son and relatives. BJP leaders made inflammatory statements day after day as the Prime Minister watched in silence. Modi is too shrewd a politician to be unaware of what is expected of a Prime Minister of the country at such a critical juncture. He knows what the threats to the idea of India signify. If he refuses to condemn a Muslim’s lynching or stop the Shiv Sena and Sangh Parivar hardliners from spreading a culture of intolerance, there is a reason for it. Winning elections is more important to him than standing up for the basic values of plurality, tolerance, free speech, secularism and liberalism. Mob attacks on dissent and established social norms and the short-sighted pursuit of politics of communalism have forced writers to surrender their awards. Modi cannot afford to ignore what that means.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:32:30.559+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
