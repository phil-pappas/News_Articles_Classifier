He injured his foot against the Giants. Jeff Haynes AP i \nmbarrows@sacbee.com \nSANTA CLARA -- You can breathe easier, 49ers fans ... and fantasy football players. \nJim Tomsula said today that Carlos Hyde took part in the team portion of Thursday's practice and that he \"fully expects\" him to play Sunday against the Ravens. Hyde was listed as limited on the Thursday practice participation report. He did not practice Wednesday. \nHyde, the 49ers' top runner and the seventh-leading rusher in the NFL, injured his foot against the Giants. He's wearing what Tomsula described as an \"orthopedic\" in his shoe. The second-year runner has absorbed -- and dished out -- plenty of hits already this season and Tomsula echoed what offensive coordinator Geep Chryst said Thursday: That the team will monitor and manage Hyde's practices and carries this season. \nOther items from Tomsula: \n* Reggie Bush will test his sore calf today after sitting out the last two practices. Bush is unlikely to play against Baltimore, but Tomsula noted the veteran tailback avoided a serious injury. \n* Bruce Ellington felt his calf tighten on Thursday and was added to the injury list. Ellington has dealt with an array of injuries since the offseason and the receiver has played just seven offensive snaps. \"We're just trying to get Bruce healthy and he's had a string of bad luck with things,\" Tomsula said. \"And he's trying.\" \n* Ahmad Brooks returned to practice Thursday after attending his sister's funeral. He was limited in Thursday's session but is expected to play against Baltimore. \n* Finally, Tomsula said he didn't notice anything dirty about the play on which Giants linebacker Jon Beason suffered a concussion. Beason told the New York media that Boone pushed him in the back into Hyde, that it was a \"coward\" maneuver and that he wouldn't have been concussed had he not been shoved. \n“I don’t think so,” Tomsula said when asked if he saw anything dirty. “We were blocking and tackling and then running.” \nThe 49ers players will be available to speak with reporters around 2:30 p.m. today. \nMatt Barrows: @mattbarrows , read more about the team at sacbee.com/sf49ers .
