There were some good parts, just not enough of them in a 4-2 loss to the St. Louis Blues.\n“It was another good game, but a game where we’re just not good enough to beat them,” said Oilers centre Ryan Nugent-Hopkins.\n“We had a lot of chances, we just couldn’t find ways to score. And on the defensive side we played solid for the most part, but there were little breakdowns that led to big breakdowns and good teams find a way to take advantage of that.”\nThe Blues have been taking advantage of Edmonton forever. They are now 19-2-1 against the Oilers in their last 22 meetings.\n“We’ve been losing to St. Louis for five years now,” sighed Taylor Hall. “We’re going to have to find a way to beat the St. Louis’s, the LAs. It’s fine if we can beat some of the bottom feeders, that’s great, but if we’re going to make up any ground we have to beat these teams.”\nThey now head to Calgary and Vancouver for a back-to-back set on Saturday and Sunday, hoping to stop their bleeding before 0-4 turns into something that can’t be fixed.\n“If we let it, it can get into our heads,” Nugent-Hopkins said of the pressure to get a win. “But we have to use it as motivation right now.\n“We had a really good pre-season, we were feeling good coming into the season, I thought our first two games were really good. Same with tonight, we just weren’t good enough to win the games, but we can’t get frustrated with ourselves.\n“We have to find ways to score and limit the big mistakes and try to stay positive.”\nAfter a lukewarm and underwhelming opening ceremony, the Oilers scored first, on Lauri Korpikoski’s first as an Oiler at 1:36, but St. Louis scored the next three — Jori Lehtera in the first, Vladimir Tarasenko in the second and Paul Stastny to make it 3-1 early in the third.\nEdmonton rallied from 3-1 in the third when Hall scored his first of the season at 13:23, but Blues winger Alex Steen put it away for good with 2:09 left in regulation.\nEdmonton’s power play finished 0-for-5 for the second time in three games and has become an obvious area of concern. It’s doing more to lose momentum than create it.\n“Sometimes the other team kills your power play, sometimes you kill your own,” said head coach Todd McLellan. “We had a combination of both.”\nThe Oilers might be 0-4, but Matt Hendricks says this isn’t like any of the four-game losing streaks he’s seen here in the past.\n“Dallas was a real stinker, the type of game we played was like a lot of our hockey last season, unprepared, not ready to play,” he said. “Tonight wasn’t like that. We brought our energy. That’s a tough hockey team over there and we fought with them for the whole night.\n“Three out of four games were pretty good hockey. We didn’t get the wins, but at the end of the day that’s the type of hockey that’s going to win more games than lose.”\nFollow me on twitter.com/sun_tychkowski\nrobert.tychkowski@sunmedia.ca\nGAME REVIEW\nBlues 4, Oilers 2\nThree Stars\n1.
