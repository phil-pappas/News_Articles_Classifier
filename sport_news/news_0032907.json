And he'll stop and he'll do the little (shakes his shoulders). And I'll know what he's talking about.\" \nThen, in case Briscoe doesn't understand, Calipari will typically add, \"We're not doing this here, Isaiah,\" the player said Wednesday. \nCalipari used directions of a compass to explain to the media what he wanted from Briscoe and all UK players. \n\"I'm making him play North-South and get in the lane,\" the UK coach said. \nBriscoe explained. \n\"Playing in straight lines,\" he said. \"When I came here, I was playing North-South-East-West. Playing with the ball. I had to get all the bad habits out of my game.\" \nWhen asked if he believed the North-South-East-West would not work at the college level or Calipari simply did not find such moves appealing, Briscoe said, \"I'm not going to say it won't work. But he feels I'm a better basketball player playing North-South.\" \nAfter a pause, Briscoe added, \"With his résumé, he knows exactly what he's taking about. So I better listen.\" \nDuring UK's Pro Day workout Sunday, ESPNU broadcaster Seth Greenberg described Briscoe's playing style as a \"city game.\" This was a mystery to Briscoe, who is from Union, N.J. \n\"I don't really know what that means, honestly,\" he said. \"That's the first time I ever heard that.\" \nBriscoe nodded in agreement when it was suggested this meant a more creative style based on improvisation. But he said freedom has its limits. \n\"He coaches me,\" he said of Calipari, \"and that's one thing I've been missing in my game. Being coached.\" \nPoythress 75 percent \nAlex Poythress' recovery from the anterior cruciate ligament he tore in mid-December is not complete. \n\"He's about 75 percent,\" Calipari said. \"We need him to be something like he's got to be a beast.\" \nPart of the remaining 25 percent is getting over the mental hurdle of knowing the knee is sound, Calipari said. \n\"It's that he's confident that 'I can come down hard and I'm going to be fine,'\" the UK coach said. \"But he's big for us.\" \nPoythress reminded reporters that patience is required in returning from a torn ACL. \n\"Taking it day by day,\" he said. \"It's a process. ACLs don't heal overnight.\" \n'Very frustrated' \nDominique Hawkins acknowledged the frustration that came with breaking a bone in his right hand during a practice this preseason. \n\"Very frustrated,\" he said, \"because Coach (Calipari) was bragging about how good I was playing and stuff. \n\"I feel like in my three years, this has been my best year in practice and I've been more confident.\" \nHawkins, a junior from Richmond and a Kentucky Mr. Basketball, described the injury. He was defending against a fast-breaking Briscoe in transition. As he reached to swipe the ball away, his hand got caught in Briscoe's jersey \"as he did a Euro step,\" Hawkins said. \"It just happened. \n\"I didn't even know I broke it. I thought I just sprained a finger.\" \nThe surgical repair involved three pins. Hawkins said he was unsure when he could return. But he downplayed the significance of the time he will be sidelined. \n\"I'll be fine,\" he said. \"I'm watching practice. (Calipari) put in all these plays I already ran last year.\" \nCalipari spoke of the disappointment in seeing Hawkins and teammate Derek Willis sidelined with injuries. Both enter their third year seeking a more prominent role. \n\"Neither one of them really had a chance to play until now,\" Calipari said. \"The other players were just better than them. They were good, too. The other guys were way better.\" \nWhen asked if the same applied to this season's \"other players,\" Calipari used his hands to explain why not. \n\"If they're better, it's not like this,\" he said separating his hands by about 2 feet. \"It's like this (about a 6-inch separation).\" Jerry Tipton: (859) 231-3227.
