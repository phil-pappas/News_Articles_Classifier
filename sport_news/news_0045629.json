He approached Yankees manager Joe Girardi before Sunday’s game in Baltimore, at which point a conference call was placed to Cashman. Both of those men expressed surprise by the news. Sabathia is expected to rejoin the club next season.\nUSA TODAY\nYankees' CC Sabathia enters alcohol rehab center, to miss playoffs\n“I love baseball and I love my teammates like brothers, and I am also fully aware that I am leaving at a time when we should all be coming together for one last push toward the World Series,” Sabathia said in a statement. “It hurts me deeply to do this now, but I owe it to myself and to my family to get myself right. I want to take control of my disease, and I want to be a better man, father and player.”\nAdditionally, Sabathia said that “being an adult means being accountable” and that he disclosed this publicly because he didn’t want to “run and hide.”\n“I was more proud of the inner strength that he showed yesterday than any day I’ve had him as a manager,” Girardi said.\n“I applaud him for his courage,” Cashman said. “It’s tougher when people are in the public arena to have to deal with something like this.”\nHis teammates rallied around Sabathia. Leftfielder Brett Gardner praised his leadership by example, adding that, whether it’s Oct. 1, April 1 or the middle of the offseason, “That’s the right time” to seek help.\nFOR THE WIN\n5 things to watch in the Astros-Yankees AL Wild Card game\nCatcher Brian McCann called his teammate not only “one of the best pitchers of this generation” but also “the best” type of guy.\n“He’s a big brother to me,” reliever Dellin Betances said. “I’ll pray for him and his family as well.”\nCashman said decisions on who will replace Sabathia in the rotation — the veteran won last week’s playoff berth clincher and went 6-10 with a 4.73 ERA in 29 starts — would be addressed at a later day. Girardi did not yet reveal the wild card roster, which is not due until Tuesday morning.\n“Now it’s time for him to rely on all of us in his time of need,” Cashman said. “He’s carried this franchise on his back in the past and led us to places we wanted to go.”\nThe players expressed support for their teammate on and off the field.\nAs designated hitter Alex Rodriguez said, “We play for CC now.”\nGALLERY: CC SABATHIA\nSabathia pitches against the Tigers in the 2011 ALDS.
