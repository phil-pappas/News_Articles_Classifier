The Wizards won a low-scoring game in wet conditions, 6-0. ( Trevor L Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \nThe Indians only needed a single fourth- down conversion to keep their comeback hopes alive. \nOut of eight fourth downs Loveland faced against Windsor on Thursday night, it only had to go for it on one. \nThe attempted conversion came late in a comeback attempt versus the No. 4 team in the 4A CHSAA poll. Down 6-0 with 2:38 remaining in the game, senior quarterback Ayden Eberhardt dropped back from the 50-yard line, hoping he could put his team in a position to score after trailing the Wizards by just a touchdown since early in the first quarter. \nBut he was late to find the open man, instead throwing his second interception of the game to Windsor defensive back Landon Schmidt. \nFrom there, Windsor (7-1, 2-1 Long's Peak) picked up two more first downs to run out the clock and take home a 6-0 win to stay in second place behind Longmont. Loveland drops to 3-5 on the year with the loss, and 1-2 in the league. \nThough offense was hard to come by for the Indians, the chances to tie and take the lead with a successful extra-point attempt were there. Just before halftime, Eberhardt had the Indians marching, completing two passes in a row to senior tight end Alex Hannaford for 38 total yards. But on his following drop back, Eberhardt surrendered possession with his initial interception, again by Schmidt, with just :36 seconds before halftime. \n\"It's definitely frustrating for sure to see 6-0 up on the board as a quarterback and know your guys put up the goose egg,\" Eberhardt said. \"At 6-0, that's a great, great defensive effort; just really frustrating as an offense.\" \nThe senior finished 7-for-12 passing for 102 yards with two interceptions, but Loveland was only able to move the ball for 25 yards on the ground, partly because five sacks helped leave Eberhardt with negative-12 yards rushing. \nOn several plays, though, the quarterback failed to get rid of the ball while scrambling for seconds at a time, an added issue. \n\"Sometimes I think he doesn't see the open guy or the guys aren't open, so it goes both ways,\" Loveland coach Wayne McGinn said. \"Sometimes he's having trouble maybe seeing or whatever it is, but he's a great athlete and he does some great things for us. We need to step up with our O-line, and everybody on our offense needs to step up and get it done.\" \nDefense was a definite bright spot for the Indians, though, as the Wizards came into Thursday averaging 345 yards on the ground, but notched just 195 against Loveland.

( Trevor L Davis / Loveland Reporter-Herald ) \n\"Our defense stepped up time and time again, I'm telling you it was the best defense I've seen since I've come to Loveland High School,\" third-year coach McGinn said. \nBut it wasn't enough to keep the Wizards off the scoreboard completely. \nWindsor's normal starter at fullback Jake Shields was out with an injury, but the Wizards didn't lose much of a step with his replacement, sophomore Brandon Ramirez. The back notched 76 yards on 10 carries, including a crucial one for 47 yards in the first quarter. On Windsor's first possession of the game, Ramirez took a handoff from the 50 down to the 3, setting up the lone score of the game, quarterback Brad Peeples' 3-yard run the next play. \n\"It's pretty great to see that we could just hold them to six points, but also frustrating knowing we couldn't hold them off just that one drive,\" Loveland running back and defensive lineman Charles Dunkelman said. \nMoving the ball into enemy territory on the wet field at Ray Patterson Stadium proved difficult for both teams after Ramirez's sole score, though. The second half opened with two three-and-outs for Windsor, and Loveland had its own later in the third. Combined, the teams punted 14 times. \n\"Offensively, we have some work to do,\" McGinn said. \"We have to get the offense going to where the defense is, and then we'll be dangerous. I think we can do that in the next two weeks, and hopefully get a nudge into the playoffs from there. We have Adams City coming up and then a really good Greeley West team that will be challenging.\" \nThe Indians' chance to bounce back against Adams City comes next Friday at Patterson Stadium at 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:49:01.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
