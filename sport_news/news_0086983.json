Posted: Friday, October 23, 2015 11:51 pm Mount Pleasant defeated by Longview By JORDAN MOSS Tribune sports writer dailytribune.net | 0 comments The Mount Pleasant Tigers failed to get on the scoreboard for the first time all season on Friday night. The Longview Lobos rolled into Sam Parker Field and dominated the game from the start en route to a 51-0 victory. The Lobos rushing attack appeared unstoppable, racking up 322 yards and accounting for five touchdowns. Longview’s ground game was led by Braylan Anthony with 92 yards on 13 attempts. Even the Longview defense got in on the scoring action, putting 14 points on the board when Mount Pleasant fumbled the ball on two consecutive offensive plays that were returned for scores. The Tigers offense was led by Zack Dean with 35 yards on 16 carries. JK Lee added 22 yards on 7 attempts and quarterback Kyle Reynolds completed 2-out-of-3 passes for 2 yards. Mount Pleasant had a difficult time moving the ball on a rainy night at Sam Parker Field. The Longview defensive line controlled the line of scrimmage, forcing the Tigers into several three-and-out possessions. On the defensive side, Mount Pleasant could not slow down the Lobos ground game, struggling to get penetration against the Lobos offensive line. The Lobos got the scoring started on their first offensive possession, driving 64 yards in just five plays. Wide receiver Jon Sorey finished off the drive with a 4-yard rushing touchdown to put Longview up 7-0 with 10:11 to go in the first quarter. Mount Pleasant moved the ball well on its first possession, using a ground game led by Travion Holloman and Zack Dean to get into field goal range. The snap on the attempted field goal sailed over kicker Sammy Puente’s head, leading to the Lobos taking over on the 49 yard line. Longview drove 51 yards in seven plays this time, capped off by a 5-yard rushing TD by fullback Austin Moore to take a 14-0 lead with 55 seconds left in the first. The Tigers went three-and-out on their next possession and gave Longview the ball inside the red zone on the Tigers 20 yard line. Even worse for Mount Pleasant, Holloman was injured on the series and did not return for the remainder of the game. It took Longview five plays before they once again crossed the goal line. This time it was running back Tylan Miller with a 5-yard rushing touchdown putting Longview up 21-0 with 9:28 left in the half. The Longview defense again forced a Tiger punt on the next Mount Pleasant possession. The Lobos drove down the field, but the Tigers caught a break when Anthony fumbled the ball near the goal line and it rolled into the end zone and out of bounds, giving Mount Pleasant possession of the ball. The Tigers were forced to punt again however, allowing Longview to take back over and drive down the field for a 32-yard field goal by Cody Jenkins, giving the Lobos a 24-0 lead with 2:05 to go before the break. A fumble by Dean on the Tigers next series was returned 44-yards for a touchdown, putting Longview up 31-0 with just over 35 seconds in the half. On the Tigers next offensive play, Ladarrius Patterson’s fumble was returned 15 yards to give the Lobos a 38-0 heading into the break. Anthony added his second rushing score in the third quarter to put Longview up 45-0 and Tyler Buchanan Anderson broke the plane in the fourth quarter. A failed 2-point conversion led to the final score of 51-0. The Tigers will be hoping to bounce back next weekend when they travel to Marshall to take on the Mavericks at 7:30 p.m. at Maverick Stadium.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T10:36:17.484+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
