The Cavos roared back, however, scoring two goals in a seven-minute stretch and taking home a 2-1 win. \n\"I am very proud of the girls,\" said Emerson coach Matt Lachman. \"They played extremely hard.\" \nSCORING CHANCES \nThe two sides played quite evenly in the first half. Emerson had a great chance early in the half when sophomore Jaden Mason received a pass right in front of the net. Unfortunately for the Cavos, Mason's shot went high over the crossbar. \nThe middle portion of the first half was mostly controlled by Tenafly. Sofia Levinson fired a long shot that went wide left, followed shortly afterward by a shot on goal from Sabrina Jayson that was saved by Emerson goalkeeper Lysa Cangialosi. \nA few minutes later Laura Roland of Tenafly took a long shot that was saved easily by Cangialosi. \nThe Tigers' best opportunity of the half came on a run down the right side by Jackie Brocco. Brocco, who was the fastest player on the pitch for either side, got past several defenders and fired a shot that was blocked by an Emerson defender. After regaining the ball immediately, Brocco took another shot that went just wide right of the goal. \nThe Cavos had two more chances to take the lead late in the first half. Junior Devin Riker had a shot blocked from close range by Tenafly defender Rachel Murphy. Fellow junior Melanie Whited had a free kick from 20 yards out with less than two minutes left, but the shot was saved by Tigers' keeper Maia Katz. \nBREAKING THROUGH \nKatz started the second half with two early saves, one off a shot from Riker and the other on a long shot from Jaden Mason. \nBrocco also found herself involved in several quality scoring chances. After a long Tenafly possession, Brocco took a shot from short range that was saved by Cangialosi. Not long after that, Brocco made a run down the right side and fired a shot that hit off the outside of the goal. \nThe best opportunity was a pass from Brocco that crossed the box and was ripped onto goal by Emma Bergman, once again ending in a save. \nAfter a quiet few minutes, Tenafly was finally able to break the scoreless tie. With 19:13 remaining in the game, Jordan Mayo hit a low shot on goal that went right through Cangialosi's legs for an unlikely goal. \nThe urgency of being down a goal in the second half seemed to spark the Emerson squad in the final minutes, as they immediately began to control the pace of the game. \nA few minutes later a Tenafly foul from about 20 yards away from the goal set the Cavos up with a free kick. Whited once again took the kick but this time the shot was a beauty that sailed high over Katz's arms and into the top of the goal. \nWhited's goal was her third of the season and reinvigorated the home crowd. \nA STUNNER \nThe Tigers were still reeling from the goal when the Cavos stunned the crowd by scoring again to take the lead with just 6:22 remaining. Erin Bartel received a pass from Riker and ran down the right side of the field, taking a running shot that once again was just a few inches too high for Katz to reach and the ball hit the back of the net to give the Cavos a 2-1 lead. \nThe goal was Bartel's fourth of the year, coming off the fifth assist for Riker. Despite Tenafly's best efforts, they were unable to score an equalizer in the final minutes, which gave Emerson the hard-fought victory. \nCangialosi made five saves for the Cavos, continuing an impressive season for the senior playing her first year of soccer. Aside from a 5-0 loss against Park Ridge in the season opener, Cangialosi has given up just nine goals total in the other 10 games played. \n\"She's been our savior all year; she's played amazing,\" said Lachman. \"She's bound to let in a goal that she probably shouldn't and she knows that, but I thought the team came back and picked her up, which is the sign of a good team.\"  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:29:36.248+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
