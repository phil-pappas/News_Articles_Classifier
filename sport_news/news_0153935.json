Five weeks into the season, the brunt of his ire is now focused on his defensive line.\nWhen asked about Auburn's struggles in the secondary, Muschamp instead reverted attention to the front seven.\n\"Hell, ain't nobody got to throw it,\" he said. \"I wouldn't.\"\nAuburn is allowing 221.8 yards on the ground in four games against FBS opponents, including a seven-year best performance against Mississippi State, which amassed only 56 rushing yards on Sept. 26.\nThere are big issues along the defensive line and at linebacker, where the Tigers rank 107th nationally in rush defense.\n\"It is what it is,\" Muschamp said. \"You turn the tape on. You've got to play blocks. You've got to play double teams. You've got to play to keep people off the linebackers. Linebacker has to take on blocks in the core of the formation. You've got to leverage the formation. There are so many things that we need to improve. That's something we have to continue to strive and get the right combination of guys that can do that.\"\nAuburn's pass defense has been suspect at times, though the Tigers did step up late against San Jose State last week. Freshman Carlton Davis picked off a pass to help seal the 35-21 victory. The Tigers rank 29th nationally against FBS opponents in pass defense (183.8 yards).\nThe lack of a pass rush has also hurt the Tigers. Carl Lawson's injury in the season opener has hurt Auburn at its hybrid Buck position, where Cassanova McKinzy started his first game last week.\n\"We need to continue to improve on playing blocks up front in our front seven,\" Muschamp said. \"That's something we've been very poor at to this point of the year. I'm disappointed with our progress as far as that is concerned. It's been very inconsistent across the board.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:33:53.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
