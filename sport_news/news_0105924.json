Both teams have three to play - Chicago in Milwaukee and the Pirates against the Reds in Pittsburgh. \nJoey Votto's seventh-inning RBI single extended to 47 his streak of consecutive games in which he's reached base at least once, the longest since Kevin Millar's 52-game stretch in 2007. \nThe Reds finished 0-7 on their last home stand of the season. They have lost 12 straight overall, matching the 1993 team for the franchise's longest losing streak in 70 years.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T22:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T14:50:09.806+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
