The Cowboys have not won a game since losing Tony Romo to a broken collarbone during their Week 2 triumph at Philadelphia. These teams met in the season opener in Arlington, Texas, and the Giants coughed up a double-digit fourth-quarter lead on their way to a stunning loss with seven seconds left.\nIn the spotlight \nCowboys QB Matt Cassel. The Giants acknowledged after the season opener, when Romo beat them with a TD pass to Jason Witten, that Romo brings an intimidation factor. But Romo’s replacement – Brandon Weeden – now has been benched for Cassel because \"we want to see if we can get our offense going a little bit more,\" Cowboys coach Jason Garrett said. Cassel is 35-38 as a starting QB, 24-33 after leaving New England, where he filled in for Tom Brady and led the Patriots to an 11-5 record in 2008. He inherits a team on a losing streak fighting to stay in contention until Romo can return. \nGame plan \nThe Giants were an offensive machine on two drives against the Eagles before the floor caved in. Targeting Odell Beckham Jr. just once in the second half is unacceptable, so expect Eli Manning to look his way often to get the big plays going. Defensively, the Giants could end up welcoming back DE Robert Ayers and LB Devon Kennard, both of whom practiced Wednesday after missing action with hamstring issues. Kennard’s presence could be huge against Witten, who has exploited the Giants’ defense for years. The Cowboys are likely to be without star WR Dez Bryant, who did not practice Wednesday and has been out since breaking his foot in the season opener.\n— Art Stapleton", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T09:01:00.396+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
