Nowhere to be found. The young receivers guessed he planned to enroll elsewhere. But Carter showed up a few days later, calm as could be, without any explanation. \n  \"Like nothing ever happened,\" Clay laughed. \"That's Tevin. ... He's so cool and so chill in every moment that sometimes you begin to ask yourself, 'Is anything ever wrong with this kid?' \"\nAs has been documented , their paths continued to intertwine. Both left Cal for junior colleges. Both transferred to Utah with one year of eligibility remaining. Both had played major roles four games into Utah's breakthrough 9-4 season when Carter injured his groin against No. 8 UCLA.\nThat night at the Rose Bowl, Carter watched the dramatic finish while nursing himself with an ice pack. Earlier, he'd anticipated a Brett Hundley screen pass and picked it off with the momentum of a freight train, plowing through Hundley's outstretched arms for the game's first touchdown. When Clay noticed something was ailing his old friend, Carter told him, simply, \"My groin just hurts.\"\nHe was still sidelined a couple of weeks later when Clay prodded him further, and Carter's description scared him.\nHe doesn't think Carter knows this, but Clay went home that night and cried. \n\"I didn't want to see one of my friends not be able to chase after one of their dreams,\" he said.\nIt wasn't an irrational fear, either.\nAlthough coaches and compliance staff assured Carter that he'd have a slam-dunk case to play a sixth year, the NCAA repeatedly denied his application for an extension of his eligibility clock.\n\"I had to appeal it like three times,\" he said. \"... That whole time, I was just unclear about what was going on.\"\nUtah had argued that there were nontraditional reasons that Carter had been unable to compete the required two seasons. Staff compiled documents from the four schools he attended — L.A. Southwest and El Camino junior colleges were the others — and painstakingly detailed his medical and family history.\nTo no avail. \nBut they kept trying.\n\"We truly believe that he deserved this last year of competition and hoped the NCAA would look at the totality of it,\" said Utah compliance director Kate Charipar.\nMeanwhile, Carter watched as teammates such as Clay, Nate Orchard and Eric Rowe were courted by NFL scouts at the NFL Combine and Utah's pro day.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:08:08.771+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
