Sourav Nayak scored the third goal for the Colaba outfit in the 36th minute. \nAnish, who started playing football only in June this year, was delighted to score for his team when they needed it. \n\"I used to watch other kids play football, but I was not confident of playing it. In June, my coach Dinesh Yadav asked me if I would like to come for school practice. \nThat's when I learnt to play the sport. Little did I realise I would became an integral part of the team,\" said 12-year-old Anish, who has scored five goals in as many matches. \nKey player \"During a Physical Training (PT) period, I saw Anish take quick strides while running. Later, I asked him if he would be interested to come for football practice. \nThough he had never played the sport, he adapted quickly and now is a key member of the team,\" said coach Yadav.
