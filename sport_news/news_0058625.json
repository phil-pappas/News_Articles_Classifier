You have to congratulate him, I don't know how he did it,\" said Nolito, who scored his seventh goal in the league to match Ronaldo's haul. \"I take away our effort with only 10 men. We have to be happy despite the loss.\"\nStill without injured stars Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema, replacement forwards Lucas Vazquez and Jese Rodriguez both made contributions by providing the passes for others to score from Madrid's only two shots on target in the first half.\nRonaldo ensured Madrid got off to a great start in the eighth when he passed to Vazquez before making a clever run to slip behind Celta defender Jonathan Castro and receive Vazquez's return pass before slotting home.\nCelta searched for an equalizer during a promising 10-minute stretch that included several chances, the best of which was a powerful shot from Orellana that Navas palmed away in the 18th.\nBut Castro left Celta's left side of the area completely undefended for Rodriguez to find Danilo, and the right back had all the time he needed to size up goalie Sergio Alvarez and double the lead.\nUnfazed, Celta surged forward with the same attacking verve that had produced a stunning 4-1 win over Barcelona last month before Lionel Messi injured his knee.\nThe difference was Navas, who made three more superb interventions before halftime to block Daniel Wass' free kick before saving efforts from Aspas and Pablo Hernandez after they were set up by Nolito.\nOther than Madrid substitute Francisco \"Isco\" Alarcon hitting the woodwork in the 69th, Celta dominated possession and the flow of play even after Cabral was sent off for protesting.\nNolito took it on himself to draw Navas to the ground and squeeze a shot past him, only for Marcelo to clear off the line in the 72nd.\nNolito finally beat Navas with a pinpoint strike just inside the top corner, sparking a determined rally by Celta that came up just short of a second goal when substitute John Guidetti missed from close range â€” before Marcelo made sure of Madrid's win.\nSevilla hosts Getafe later, while Deportivo La Coruna visits Malaga and Real Betis is at Granada.\n ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:50:28.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
