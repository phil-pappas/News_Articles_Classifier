He had been on paid administrative leave since Oct. 2, when the allegations surfaced. \nEscort Katrina Powell has told ESPN that McGee paid $10,000 for 22 shows that took place in a Louisville dormitory from 2010 to 2014. Louisville coach Rick Pitino has denied any knowledge of such parties and said he will not resign. \nMcGee played at Louisville before becoming a graduate assistant coach and director of men's basketball operations. He left the university last year to become an assistant at UMKC.
