He switched off the engine and everything, he did all the procedures as he normally does when he stops the car.\"\nReplays showed the car snapping left and hitting a concrete wall, then skidding along in a cloud of debris at turn 13 with the front left wheel dangling on tethers in front of the driver.\n\"Is he OK? Because it looks like a big one,\" Verstappen had asked over the team radio as the medical car sped to the scene of the impact and the paddock collectively held its breath.\nTost said the fact that the car went under the barriers was worrying.\n\"We must find a solution because that's quite dangerous,\" said the Austrian. \"It reminds me of the (Luciano) Burti accident at Blanchimont at Spa.\"\nThat 2001 crash, with Burti's Prost penetrating the tyre wall at speed, left the Brazilian with serious bruising and concussion and ended his F1 racing career.\n\"I think the barriers should be more fixed or whatever,\" said Tost. \"I am not an expert in this but I am convinced the FIA will find a good solution for this.\"\nVerstappen, who crashed into similar barriers earlier in the season in Monaco, agreed.\n\"It was not good. It (the barrier) went up and it shouldn't go up. In my crash in Monaco it all stayed flat and that's how it should be because if it goes up it can hit your head so that's a bit unsafe,\" he said.\n\"Luckily nothing happened with it but for next time for sure they need to fix them.\"\nIn an indication of the severity of the accident, race officials decided not to restart the practice session.\nThe red flags meant drivers had little time to set their cars up for the track after Friday's two sessions were hit by a morning diesel spillage and afternoon bad weather.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:36:35.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
