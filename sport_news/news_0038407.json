The people, in general, tend to perceive economists as enlightened technocrats, who alone are qualified in providing essential inputs in the building of governance structures and formulation of public policies. This, however, is nothing but an indulgent myth constructed by economists themselves, to claim a status superior to that of practitioners of other disciplines.\nThis tendency to set Economics apart from other subjects can be corroborated by the way public discourse is conducted in media. For instance, most Indians can or do participate in debates around history textbooks or the curriculum. They do not always qualify themselves as experts in history, pedagogy or linguistics. But when the same people have to question trade-agreements, interest rate cuts, tax decisions, minimum wage laws, they usually begin with this succinct qualifier: “I am no economist, but…”.\nEvery Amar, Akbar and Antony can air an opinion on whether or not caste Hindus did eat beef in the ancient past or whether women should wear jeans. But nobody likes to mess with the import policy that brings home branded jeans, or the export policy that makes India the world’s largest exporter of beef. On the other hand, any insight into our economic/development/financial policies that dominate the public discourse, are provided solely by trained economists. As if they are our only saviours in these matters. So, their technocratic blueprint for “Make in India” is accepted without interrogation, but the farmers’ resistance to land acquisition is constantly critiqued and interrogated.\nPartly, the discipline of Economics itself is to blame for this skewed prioritisation. The rite of passage into Economics, for every budding economist includes the need to sharply differentiate between ‘what is’ and ‘what ought to be’. In other words, this means a rigid separation of all questions of morality from empiric data. At a broader level, such dissociation is considered to be an essential requirement in any discipline of “science”.\nThe clinical separation of facts from values is extolled and propagated all through the study of economics: from the beginning of microeconomics 101, through the teaching of econometric techniques, and even in development economics. The notion that economists are “scientists,” and must maintain full “objective” value-neutrality, is hammered into the students of economics. As good Baconians, economists adopt a language that is bereft of everyday vocabulary: consider that companies are called ‘firms’, homes ‘households’, loans ‘finance’, price-rise ‘inflation’, corruption ‘rent-seeking’, and unionisation ‘collective bargaining’.\nWhat many economists, however, tend to overlook in their zeal, is that unlike them scientists do not drive such a rigid wedge between “what is” and “what ought to be.” From Thomas Kuhn’s The Structure of Scientific Revolutions to the blitzkrieg of Science and Technology Studies, the conclusions point to one thing: science is not a mere collection of facts. It is layered with cultural and moral values. Science emerges in a community that engages in the social production of knowledge by means of preexisting knowledge.\nFrom personal bias to macro-level determinations of class and caste, science is affected by assumptions of what ought to be. No serious historian of science will hold on to the rigid fact-value dichotomy. There is far too much evidence against it. The ship of positivism has surely sunk by now, and those who don’t jump ship, are likely to drown.\nHowever, it would not be fair to say that the discipline of economics has not had debates on moral values; or for that matter, methodological debates, concerning its value-loaded assumptions. There have been writers, both in India and abroad who have worked on the philosophy of economic science. But these valuable and self-reflexive exercises do not seem to have proliferated to the media or the universities. And since economics also delineates a path into the spheres of finance and analytics, the corporate world too has an interest in ensuring that economists do not “stray” into the other debate.\nThe whole procedure has left us with a large pool of elite English speaking students who claim to know absolute truths, and who reiterate standard discursive “facts” even before entering a normative debate. Analysts and experts are often heard advocating that ‘good economics’ must take precedence over ‘bad politics’.\nIn this context, we also need to remember that the discipline of economics has been deeply influenced by Western values. This should not be taken as a derogatory comment about Western values. However, like every discipline managed by and popularised in the West, the discipline of economics too has maintained the myth that ‘economic science’ could only be arrived at with the help of Europe’s “enlightenment”. As if after a brief period of anticipation ushered by the Greek civilisation, the world had awaited Adam Smith to unravel in the 18th century. The disciplinary oedipus complex roped in more ‘father’ figures from European theology and philosophy to cast the “history of economics as a science”. This history of Europe and its ‘secular’ or ‘provincial’ values are embedded in the history of economics. The theory of choice in economics, for example, banks upon the validity of Western consumerism in affirming that a consumer will always prefer more of consumption, and not less of it.\nThat economic science in India has not seriously critiqued Western categories, is evident from the way the Indian Economy is explained, mostly in the language of exceptions and hyperboles. For instance, the definition of organised employment makes sense mainly in the Western context. When we describe 92% of our labour force as “un-organised”, we are defining about 400 million people in terms of what rights and benefits they lack. These include regular contracts, maternity benefits, pensions, etc. The persistent use of such negative definitions alienates theory from reality.\nIdentities like caste do not make sense in the West. But they are hugely relevant in explaining the Indian economy. Marxian economics had provoked a frantic search for “feudalism” in Indian history and for the wage-labourer in Indian politics. However, the fact remains that a large chunk of our workforce is self-employed, and/or fall in the category of unorganised labour. Reports suggest that this may have been the case even in the past.\nAlso, Indian markets have developed around regional and national values. Economic theory cannot jettison this reality in its ‘preference’ for and its belief in ‘superstructure’. How else do we explain the low participation of women in the workforce? How is it possible to maintain a boundary between a society guided by communal and familial values and an economy that is guided by rational, ‘secular’ action? Maybe it is time to move beyond this narrow analytical framework and see economics as a value-loaded state-craft rather than a discipline brazenly used to lay claims to ‘absolute truth’.\nThe author is a student of Economics at Presidency University in Kolkata", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T14:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T05:59:03.639+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
