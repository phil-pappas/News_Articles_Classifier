She didn’t. She lost to Roberta Vinci in the semi-finals, and missed the chance to become only the fourth woman in history to complete a calendar slam. And now her coach has said the world No 1 may not play again this year, so disappointed is she with her loss at Flushing Meadows. Patrick Mouratoglou, who has coached Williams since 2012, questioned whether she was in the right frame of mind, and told ESPN W: “When Serena lost in Toronto [in August], she was very disappointed, but we went back to practice the morning after because she wanted to win the US Open. “But after this year and the three grand slams [she won in 2015], the question is how high her motivation is to play those tournaments. I don’t think she should play if the motivation is not really high.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-30T06:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:09:19.180+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
