The first will take place this Sunday when the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins square off. \nAnd the the Jets don’t intend to leave home without proper bathroom supplies. \nIn a lengthy feature that explains everything that goes into packing up and heading to London for an American football game, Ben Shpigel of the New York Times wrote about the roughly 5,000 items the team needs to load onto a shipping container for the six teams who will play in London this year. Among those items are hundreds of rolls of toilet paper. Why? Because the British apparently have a thing for single-ply. \nThey would not have needed to list the value and country of origin for the contents in every trunk or bag. Or find an industrial launderer to pick up soiled practice clothing at one location and deliver it clean to another. Or fly in the chef at their London hotel to observe how food is cooked and served at team headquarters. \nOr order 350 rolls of toilet paper to replace the thinner version used in England. \n“Some may say that’s a little over the top or whatnot, but it didn’t really cost that much, so why not?” Degerness said. “We’re basically trying to replicate everything that we’re doing here over there.” \nProfessional athletes like things a certain way. If the toilet paper that is used is London is an issue, you can imagine the other obstacles there are that are standing in the way of starting an NFL franchise there — despite what one local politician recently said . With six teams traveling to England this season, we can only hope we don’t have anymore incidents with smoke detectors in hotel rooms .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T20:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:57:33.056+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
