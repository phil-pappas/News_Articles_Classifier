A late goal got the P-Bruins a point in Friday night’s opener. Then they hung six goals on veteran AHL goalie Mike McKenna on Sunday. It was a promising and entertaining beginning. Here’s the good, bad and ugly: Good *** What a start for Frankie Vatrano. The free agent from UMass-Amherst tied the game late on Friday night, then exploded for four goals on Sunday. His first goal came just seven seconds in. As of Monday morning, Vatrano leads the AHL in scoring. Don’t blink when he gets the puck near the net; you’re liable to miss a goal. His release is that quick. *** Gotta love it when a plan comes together. On Sunday, with Brian Ferlin out, coach Bruce Cassidy moved Alex Khokhlachev to wing with Austin Czarnik and Vatrano. The Vatrano-Czarnik-Koko troika was involved in all the Providence goals in a 6-4 win. Now that’s coaching. *** Khokhlachev was a standout in both games. It seemed like he was on the ice with the puck on his stick for a good part of the night on Friday, when he assisted on Vatrano’s late goal. Then he set up Vatrano’s first and fourth goals on Sunday. *** Good start for Zane McIntyre, stopping 65 of 71 shots in two games and posting his first win as a pro on Sunday. *** Czarnik scored his first goal as a pro and added two assists on Sunday. *** Justin Hickman was physical and put five shots on the Penguins goal on Friday night. *** The power play went 3 for 3 on Sunday. *** The penalty kill is 4 for 4 so far. Bad *** Malcolm Subban and Andrew Cherniwchan missed the weekend with lower-body injuries. *** Ferlin missed Sunday’s game with an upper-body injury. *** Colby Cave was minus-3 on Sunday. Ugly *** The P-Bruins were outshot 21-4 and gave up three goals in the second period on Sunday. *** The power play was 0 for 6 on Friday night. *** Zack Phillips was minus-2 on Friday and minus-3 on Sunday.
