The blitzing Colts repeatedly stymied Seventy-First’s powerful running game, holding Paul Underwood, Cumberland County’s leading rusher, to 91 yards. \nSLIDE SHOW: Photos from Friday night's game \nMeanwhile, they got two touchdowns from quarterback Justice Galloway-Velazquez and handed the reigning Mid-South 4-A Conference champions a 14-13 defeat. \nCape Fear remained in contention for the regular-season title as it climbed to 2-0 in the league and 6-1 overall. It was the Falcons’ second league loss in three games, dropping them to 6-2, 1-2. \nColts coach Jake Thomas said it was important to convince his team that it belonged on the top rung of the conference ladder and deserving to be mentioned with other teams chasing the regular-season crown. \n“Just getting better fundamentally, week to week, I think we’ve progressed throughout the season,’’ he said. “Tackling, alignment, leverage, the little things you work on. Defensively we have improved there.’’ \nFAN CAM: See if you were spotted during the game \nIn addition to keeping Underwood under wraps, the Colts outgained the Falcons 324-246. \n“We just had to figure out how to stop that counter trey,’’ said Cape Fear defensive back Colten Thibeault, who had a hand in a blocked field goal in the third quarter that preserved the Colts lead. He also made an interception late that helped clinch the win. \n“We just had to mix up our blitzes and get them guessing, not knowing who was coming,’’ Thibeault said. “At the end, we just had to make the play, and we did.’’ \nCape Fear took the lead for good with 5:57 left in the third period on Galloway-Velaquez’s second touchdown, a 31-yard run. Chris Williams scored a crucial two-point conversion as Cape Fear nosed ahead, 14-13. \nThe Colts followed that score with their biggest defensive stand of the game after Seventy-First’s Leon Rogers returned the kickoff 81 yards to the Cape Fear 9-yard line. \nUnderwood could manage only 4 yards on three carries, and coach Duran McLaurin sent Larry Armour in on for a 22-yard field-goal try that was blocked by Thibeault. \n“We had some opportunities we did not cash in on,’’ McLaurin said. “I figured Larry was one of the best kickers in the league and didn’t feel like it would get blocked. They got a hand up. They played well.’’ \nThibeault blunted another Falcon drive with an interception at the Colt 19 in the fourth quarter. Seventy-First got the ball back in time to run five plays in the final minute, but time ran out with the end zone 60 yards away. \nMcLaurin felt his team hurt itself with procedure penalties. Some of them he felt were caused by his team trying to alter its snap count to disrupt the Cape Fear blitz. \n“We played like a young team tonight,’’ McLaurin said. “That’s not what we need to be doing at this time of the season.’’ \nCape Fear hosts Pine Forest next week while the Falcons try to get back on track at home against Overhills. \nScholastic sports editor Earl Vaughan Jr. can be reached at vaughane@fayobserver.com or 486-3519. \nCape Fear 14, Seventy-First 13 \nCape Fear 6 0 8 0—14 \nSeventy-First 0 6 7 0—13 \nCF — Justice Galloway-Velazquez 1 run (kick failed) \nSF — Paul Underwood 3 run (kick failed) \nCF — Galloway-Velazquez 31 run (Chris Williams run) \nSF — Nyjel Manuel 14 pass from Deiontae Jones (Larry Armour kick) \nINDIVIDUAL STATISTICS \nRushing: CF — Galloway-Velazquez 16-93, Williams 13-66.
