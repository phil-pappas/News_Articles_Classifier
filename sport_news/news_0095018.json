(Photo: Submitted) \nREYNOLDSBURG - Clutching the fourth-place plaque and smiling for the cameras with her teammates was the easy part. Coming to grips with the finality of the moment is what hit Lexington tennis player Maya Ahmed like a volley from close range. \nIn the grand scheme, Lex's losses Sunday to second-ranked Cincinnnati Indian Hill (3-0) and No. 8 Columbus Academy (3-1) in the Ohio Tennis Coaches Association state team tournament were inconsequential. With three freshmen and two sophomores in the lineup, some would say seventh-ranked Lex overachieved by simply getting to the Division II Final Four at Reynoldsburg High School. \nIt's the espirit de corps that Ahmed hates losing as the book closes on her career. \n\"It was a great season where we saw a lot of goals reached,\" said the team's lone senior, fighting back tears, \"including getting to state (four years in the OTCA tournament) and getting a lot of girls to state (for the OHSAA tournament) as individuals.\" \nThe highlight of the weekend for her was competing with her teammates one last time, but she also earned All-Ohio honors in the OHSAA individual tournament, held in greater Cincinnati, by reaching the DII quarterfinals in doubles with Jordyn Traxler. \n\"I think what I'll remember most is just the fact we got this far because of every single player on the team; we had a great time together,\" Ahmed said. \"Everybody can take something away from these matches to look forward to next year. \n\"This year everybody was a little bit green and it's harder to perform under pressure without experience. I think it got to us, but the next couple of years the team should be super strong.\" \nTraxler, the lone junior, has a lot to build on from this season. In addition to her first-round win Friday with Ahmed in the individual state tourney, she paired with sophomore Madi Mueller to claim Lex's only win Sunday — a 6-4, 6-1 win over Indian Hill's Sarah Price and Amalia Guzman in the semifinal round. \n\"I'm excited about working hard and getting back down here next year,\" Traxler said. \"I feel blessed to make it to state and I'm not going to let it get to my head.\" \nTraxler played No. 2 singles behind freshman Sylvia Goldsmith, but proved quite strong once she switched to doubles for the three-week tournament run. \n\"I like playing singles because I like the pace and doing it myself,\" Traxler said, \"but I think I'm better at doubles because I'm good with other players and can calm their nerves.\" \nGoldsmith, one of only two freshman in the 16-girl draw in Cincy, came within a third-set tiebreaker in her first round match of advancing to the quarters and becoming All-Ohio. On Sunday, she put up a good battle before losing 6-4, 6-1 to Indian Hill's state doubles champion Caroline Andersen. In her match against Academy's Georgia Tuckerman in the consolation finals, she let a 4-1 lead in the opening set get away, falling 5-7. They were a few games into the second set when Academy clinched third place by winning No. 2 and No. 3 singles and No. 2 doubles. \nGoldsmith knows that inconsistency is her Achilles heel right now. In addition to faltering after her fast start against Tuckerman, she couldn't build on the momentum of a 6-2 first set win over Carrollton's Taylor Fair on Friday. She fell behind 0-5 in the second, rallied to 4-5 before letting a game point get away at 5-5 and then traded service breaks with Fair (10 between them) in the third set before losing the tiebreaker. \n\"I have to be more consistent with my serve, ground strokes, all of my shots,\" Goldsmith said. \"I tend to go for shots with all power, but I need to focus more on topspin and accuracy. \n\"I think I'll be able to use all of this (weekend) as inspiration and motivation. The atmosphere's totally different and the pressure is definitely on. It's all these different factors you have to play through, but I think we did a great job.\" \nGoldsmith also swims and runs track and, before this winter, played basketball. But she knows if she's going to reach her goal of playing college tennis she has to ramp up her game outside of the season. \n\"This helps me gauge how much I need to prepare,\" she said. \"There are definite changes I need to make before next season. I was running track in May and that only left me two months to prepare (for tennis) after I had already done basketball and swimming, too. I wasn't in a (tennis) routine like everybody else at state.\" \nReturning with Goldsmith, Traxler and Mueller next season will be freshmen Hayliegh Tucker and Katie Volz and sophomore Kirstyn Geyer. Along with Ahmed they made up the youngest team coach Ron Schaub can ever remember advancing to the Final Four — and Lex has now done it 11 straight years. His girls program has won five titles and been runner-up four times. \n\"For years we've always had two or three seniors, so I didn't think state was a given this year,\" Schaub said. \"At the district tournament, we weren't even on the top or bottom of the bracket (reserved for the top two seeds), so whoever did the district draw must not have thought we were all that. But it worked out great. This was a great experience for the girls.\" \njspencer@nncogannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T04:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T12:28:37.497+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
