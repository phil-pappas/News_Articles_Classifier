With cooler, wetter weather expected as autumn arrives, fire restrictions were lifted Friday in the Stanislaus National Forest, and fire managers in Yosemite National Park announced plans to begin prescribed burns later this month with a 111-acre project across the valley from El Capitan. People can now build campfires outside established administrative sites in the forest for the purpose of warming. A statewide ban on debris burning remains in effect, forest officials said. Anyone who lights a warming fire must ensure it is completely out before leaving the fire pit. Rangers and other personnel are finding an unspecified number of unattended campfires that are not extinguished and have to put them out, forest officials said. Natural causes account for more than 50 percent of wildfires in the Stanislaus National Forest. Human causes are also responsible for wildfires in the forest. Longer nights and shorter days have lowered fire danger in the Stanislaus National Forest, said Robert Laeng, deputy fire management officer for the forest. Though fire restrictions are being lifted, forest conditions remain dry, and visitors should continue to be vigilant and practice fire safety, Laeng said. Fire permits and fire safety information are available free at any Forest Service Visitor Information Office.

Taft Toe burn In Yosemite later this month, the first prescribed fire is planned in the area of Taft Toe, next to Southside Drive between El Capitan Bridge and Sentinel Beach picnic area, said Gary Wuchner, fire education and information manager for the park. The total burn area covers 111 acres, and it’s expected to last two to three days, Wuchner said. The primary objective is to reduce excessive fuel build-up. Fuel-reduction steps including mechanical thinning will take place before the Taft Toe burn. “Most likely we’ll start around the end of next week or the week of the 19th,” Wuchner said. “We want to try to burn into a storm, so that we can take advantage of cooler weather and precipitation to temper the burn at the end of it. “We want it warm and dry enough to get good consumption,” Wuchner said. “Take a day and half initially, and four to five days of burn down time. There will be residual smoke. Then we put it on patrol status at that point.” Park visitors are tired of smoke, and fire personnel in Yosemite are, too, Wuchner said. “But if we don’t continue doing prescribed fire and other methods of reducing fuels, we have the potential for larger fires,” Wuchner said. Other prescribed burns are planned after the Taft Toe burn, dependent on weather and fuel conditions, Wuchner said. Shorter days and cooler temperatures are setting up optimal prescribed-burn conditions. The other burns are proposed in Mariposa Grove in October, Ahwahnee Meadow in late October, Soupbowl near Wawona beginning in November, Yosemite West maintenance burning in November, and Crane Flat and Merced Grove once winter sets in. Fire is a natural part of the Sierra Nevada ecosystem, and reducing fuel build-up helps ensure the longevity of mature trees and saplings, Wuchner said.
