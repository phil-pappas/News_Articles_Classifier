Cubs fan Steve Bartman remains a scapegoat for the 2003 Chicago Cubs’ NLCS collapse as a result of his interference with what may have been a foul fly-ball catch by outfielder Moises Alou late in Game 6.\nFor a refresher on the play, watch the video above. If you’re a Cubs fan, well, you’re probably not reading.\nIn what does not outwardly appear to be a joke, one self-proclaimed lifelong Cubs fan is seeking to orchestrate an offering to Bartman: forgiveness and a sweet accommodations package worth $5,000, including the cost of his attendance at the NL Wild Card Game between the Pirates and Cubs, which will likely take place in Pittsburgh.\nWrites Cubs fan Keque Escobedo on GoFundMe: \nLifelong Cubs fan wants to make amends for 2003, lets make it happen. First we need to find him to get him to the big game. If anyone knows where he is at, tell him we are looking for him. The money would pay for his expenses including his ticket, hotel room, flights and a little spending money. \nIf he cannot be found by time of the big game all the proceeds raised will be donated to the Alzheimer’s Association. \nAfter three days, 156 people had raised $1,853. No word if any of them were renegade Pirates fans.\n\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email This article originally appeared on Fox Sports .\nFiled under chicago cubs ,  mlb playoffs ,  pittsburgh pirates", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:07:03.912+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
