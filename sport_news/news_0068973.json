Brown, details the 13 character \"Traits of an Elite Competitor.\" For example, there is \"strengthening your will\" or \"living in the moment.\"\nOregon lost to Auburn in the title game, and Huff had a limited role as a freshman, but he still refers to Compete on a regular basis. The Eagles wide receiver recently pulled it from his locker to show to a reporter, and the pamphlet-sized book was worn with three creases from often being folded and placed in Huff's back pocket.\n\"Every thing you see here,\" Huff said, pointing to the book, \"I am. It's helped me when I've had some mistakes. Even last year, when I was having a tough time, I go back to this. Never give up, and my time will come.\"\nMore coverage VOTE: Who will win Giants-Eagles game? Download FREE Philly Sports Now app for iPhone! FORUMS: Will the Eagles make the playoffs?

The second-year receiver caught four passes for 78 yards - both career highs - and scored his first offensive touchdown in the NFL. He also returned a kick 40 yards.\nAfter Huff flipped into the end zone in celebration and ran to the sideline, Kelly embraced him. The Eagles coach doesn't normally hug his players during games, but there appeared to be a message in the display of affection.\n\"I guess that message was, 'Patience,' \" Huff said. \"I know the previous week I only played four snaps, and I haven't gotten off to the fast enough start that I thought I would this season. Yeah, I probably wouldn't have scored if the two [Saints defenders] hadn't collided. But just for me to score, it's like all the hard work from Year 1 to 2, and it finally came to light.\n\"But I can't be satisfied with four catches, 78 yards. I got to want more. I do want more. I want to be successful. I want to prove to myself that I belong.\"\nHuff certainly belongs, but he remains a work in progress, even though the Eagles drafted him in the third round a year ago, when there were receivers chosen after him that have had bigger impacts in the NFL.\nAn early-season shoulder injury slowed his growth as a rookie, but he had more negative plays than positive last year. He opened training camp this summer as one of the starting outside receivers, but was supplanted by rookie Nelson Agholor.\nBut Agholor has had growing pains, as well, and is unlikely to play on Monday night against the New York Giants. Aside from the Redskins game when Huff was returning from a hamstring injury, he has played about 50 percent of the snaps. But his role is sure to increase after breaking out last week and with Agholor's ankle sprain.\n\"Josh . . . is an extremely dynamic player,\" Kelly said. \"I think he's got the ability to change directions, stop and start. He's really good with the football in his hands, that's why he's doing a great job of returning for us. . . . But the other thing with Josh is he's extremely tough. He's one of the better blockers in this league.\"\nKelly has clearly been one of Huff's biggest supporters. He lured the running back from Houston to Oregon, converted him to receiver as a sophomore, and watched him overcome a difficult childhood that involved a mother who had been in and out of prison. Huff wouldn't go as far as to say that Kelly has been a father figure, but there is an obvious bond.\n\"I think that he understands me and understands where I come from and how much I want to succeed,\" Huff said. \"He just knows the type of competitor I am. Of course, when things aren't going well, I'm going to talk about it. I'm going to wear my emotions on my sleeve. I'm a competitor.\n\"When I see other guys on the field and they make a similar play, I'm like: 'OK, I know I can make that play or I can do something better than that.' When a receiver has the ball in his hands and he goes down, I'm like: 'OK, you've got to stay up. There's more green. There's more yards to be had.' \"\nHuff caught a pass at the 5-yard line vs. the Saints. He was driven back a few yards, but he wouldn't go down, kept his feet churning, and advanced to the 2. When he has had success in the NFL, it has often involved breaking tackles.\n\"I feel like I'm one of the better receivers in the league once I get the ball in my hands,\" Huff said. \"I'm working on turning that raw receiver that can do everything into being one of those guys like Julio Jones or Odell Beckham, especially with the skill-set that I have.\"\nBefore the season, Huff listed his goals: 50 catches for 800 yards and six touchdowns and no more than 10 drops. He's got a lot of ground to make up - he has eight catches for 117 yards and a score - if he's to hit those numbers. But Huff, who dropped four of 17 targets last season, doesn't have a drop yet.\n\"Catching the ball naturally and being an outside receiver - that's something I had to adjust to,\" Huff said. \"I'm still learning things every day. I think that's what makes me unique. I'm able to adjust.\"\nHuff knows he has a ways to go, but he isn't lacking in confidence. \"I feel like I run some of the best routes on the team,\" he also said. He said that working on controlling emotions remains a constant battle. There's a chapter in Compete - Controlling the Controllable - that addresses that subject.\n\"You're going to have times when you let the game get the best of you, or you let your emotions get the best of you,\" Huff said. \"Your body language, for instance, may give off something way worse than what you're feeling.\"\nThere was nothing to misinterpret about Huff's flip over the goal line. He was excited. It was the kind of flip you might have seen DeSean Jackson try in his heyday with the Eagles. Huff said Kelly told him after the game to remain safe and protect the ball when celebrating.\nWould he do it again?\n\"Without a -\" Huff started to say. \"I'd have to think about that. But I would love to do it again. That's just me being myself. I love the game. I love to have fun. I could care less what people think about me.\"\njmclane@phillynews.com\n@Jeff_McLane", "external_links": ["http://polls.clickability.com/polls", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=TrainingCamp&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNFL_Philadelphia_Eagles_NFL_Training_Camp"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:07:55.365+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
