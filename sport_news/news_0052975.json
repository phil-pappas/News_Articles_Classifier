Junior tailback Corey Clement, out since the opener because of a sports hernia, went through a full week of practice. He told reporters Tuesday, his first public comments since Sept. 24, that his plan was to travel with the team and gauge in warm-ups how he felt. Clement, who had surgery Oct. 1, would prefer to play sooner than later. However, Clement acknowledged he still hadn't been able to accelerate to full speed in the open field. \"This team means something to him,\" coach Paul Chryst said. \"Playing means something to him. I like what he's done. We'll know when it all comes together. I'm really good with let's take each day for what it is.\"\nVOLTZ SHOULD PROVIDE LEADERSHIP: When center Dan Voltz sat out the Purdue game last week, offensive coordinator Joe Rudolph was forced to use his fifth starting combination on the offensive line in seven games. Voltz, who suffered a sprained left elbow at Nebraska, should return to the starting lineup against the Illini. Redshirt freshman Michael Deiter shifted from left guard to center to fill in for Voltz, and the line play wasn't as good as it had been the previous week. Voltz, who has 26 starts, should be able to solidify the line and make the in-game adjustments necessary to combat Illinois' aggressive front.\nENCORE PERFORMANCE? Joel Stave improved his record to 4-0 against Purdue last week, becoming the first UW quarterback to win all four meetings against a Big Ten foe. The fifth-year senior can finish 4-0 against Illinois with a victory Saturday. Stave has completed 39 of 60 passes (65.0%) for 516 yards with four touchdowns and one interception against the Illini. He faced the Illini in his first Big Ten home start in 2012 and passed for 254 yards and two touchdowns in a 31-14 victory; completed 76.2% of his passes for 189 yards and two scores in a 56-32 road victory in 2013; and last season had a quiet day, going just 7 of 14 for 73 yards as UW rushed for 401 yards in a 38-28 victory in Madison. \"I think it is pretty cool I've gotten a chance to start as many games as I have against some of these teams,\" Stave said.\nCONTAINING BENTLEY: Illinois senior V'Angelo Bentley is a solid cornerback and a dual threat on returns. He's third in the Big Ten on punt returns (11.6-yard average) and would be third on kickoff returns (24.6) if he had enough returns to qualify. UW has been outstanding covering punts and has limited teams to 3.4 yards per return. Kickoffs could be problematic. UW limits foes to 15.6 yards per return, but kickoff specialist Andrew Endicott (leg) isn't healthy and Jack Russell likely will take his place. Russell will have to try to put the ball high and deep to give the coverage unit a chance to corral Bentley.\nHISTORY LESSON UW has won nine of the last 10 meetings. The last Illinois victory came in 2007 in Champaign. UW entered the game No. 5 in the polls, 2-0 in the Big Ten, 5-0 overall and with a 13-game winning streak dating to the 2006 season.\nLed by tailback Rashard Mendenhall (19 carries, 160 yards and two TDs) and quarterback Juice Williams (14-92) the Illini rushed for 289 yards and three touchdowns in a 31-26 victory. Williams also completed 12 of 19 passes for 121 yards and a touchdown.\nUW tailback P.J. Hill was limited to 83 yards and a touchdown on 21 carries. The Badgers, who saw Illinois build a 17-0 lead 22 minutes, 56 seconds into the game, finished the day with 49 passes and 31 runs.\nTyler Donovan (27 of 49 for 392 yards) found tight end Garrett Graham for a 9-yard score with 1:31 left to help UW pull within 31-26, but the Illini recovered the onside kick and picked up a first down to burn off the final time.\nDID YOU KNOW? UW inside linebacker T.J. Edwards, a redshirt freshman who played quarterback in high school, has a team-high 54 tackles through seven games. Former UW linebacker Chris Borland had 54 tackles — in 13 games — during his freshman season in 2009. \"I think T.J is a good athlete, competitive,\" UW coach Paul Chryst said. \"He wants to learn, wants to grow....You've got a guy who loves playing the game and has the right amount of confidence and also the desire to continue to work and be the best he can.\"\nJEFF POTRYKUS' PREDICTION UW has won its last five meetings with Illinois, all by double digits and by an average of 14.4 points per game. The going won't be easy this time as interim head coach Bill Cubit has the Illini playing inspired football. Both teams likely will struggle to run the ball consistently, so the outcome should come down to which quarterback is more efficient and which defense can generate a critical turnover.\nWisconsin 17, Illinois 14\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/336451911/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-24T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T04:54:55.814+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
