HILLSDALE — In a season filled with immense promise for the Pascack Valley football team, Friday night could turn out to be a major defining moment.\nThe Indians, No. 2 in The Record public football Top 20, faced their most physical opponent of the season under awful weather conditions, and wound up outlasting No. 6 Wayne Hills, 23-20, in a Big North crossover showdown for their eighth straight victory.\n“We beat a tough team tonight,” said PV senior quarterback Colin Dedrick, who threw for 183 yards and two touchdowns. “Wayne Hills is back, and this is a good win for us.”\nThis game was chock full of twists and turns with momentum shifting as if it were blown by the heavy winds whipping the field. The Indians (4-0) looked as if they were in control for most of the first half, opening a 14-0 lead on a 16-yard run by senior running back Andrew Flores in the first quarter and a 34-yard touchdown pass from Dedrick to senior wide receiver Mike Pimpinella in the second quarter.\nThe Patriots (4-1) began to show a little offensive juice late in the first half, cutting the lead to 14-7 on a 23-yard touchdown pass from junior quarterback Brendan Devera to senior tight end Joey Kenny with 2:03 remaining in the second quarter.\nDedrick and Pimpinella, however, had a nifty trick up their sleeves. It looked as if the Indians were content to run out the clock on their final possession before the half, but Dedrick wound up tossing a 67-yard touchdown pass to Pimpinella as time expired to make it 20-7.\n“At first, we were just going to run out the clock,” Dedrick said. “Then Mike said, ‘Colin, give me a look.’ We had nothing to lose, and Mike made a great play.”\n“We just played it perfectly,” Pimpinella said.\nThat play could’ve broken the Patriots, but they came out in the second half rejuvenated. They did a much better job on defense, stopping the Indians on their first two possessions of the second half. In between, the Patriots cut the lead to 20-14 on a 2-yard run by Devera.\nThe Indians made it 23-14 on a 27-yard field goal by junior Matt Urrea on the first play of the fourth quarter. But even that was a victory for the Patriots’ defense, which stopped PV’s drive on the 5-yard line.\nDevera scored on a 1-yard run with 7:54 remaining to make it a three-point game, but that was as close as the Patriots would get. Their final drive ended with 42 seconds remaining as Pimpinella swatted away a Devera pass from a Wayne Hills receiver on the 4-yard line.\n“I knew it was coming,” Pimpinella said.\n “They scored against me the first time, and that really [made me angry]. I knew they would try to do it again.”\nPimpinella caught five passes for 165 yards and two touchdowns. Flores had to work hard on the slick track, carrying 32 times for 147 yards (103 in the first half).\n“This was a good win against a tough team,” Pimpinella said. “We’re always getting better, and we have to keep doing that if we want to get back to where we want to be.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:10:28.768+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
