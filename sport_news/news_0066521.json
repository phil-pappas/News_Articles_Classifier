(AP Photo/Jon Super) more > By DAVID GERGES   \nLiverpool was applauded off the field following its 1-1 draw against 10-man Rubin Kazan in the Europa League on Thursday but it’s hard to imagine new manager Juergen Klopp offering his players the same sort of praise. \nElsewhere, Italian league leader Fiorentina lost 2-1 at home to Lech Poznan, and Lazio strengthened its hold at the top of Group G following a 3-1 win over Rosenborg. \nIt was a frustrating night for Klopp in his first match at Anfield as his side toiled in vain. \n“The team is not full of self-confidence,” Klopp said. \nKlopp saw his side fall behind early to striker Marko Devic’s impressive half-volley. However, the Russian side lost captain Oleg Kuzmin to a second yellow card in the 36th minute, and within seconds Emre Can equalized. \nDespite the man advantage, wayward passes and poor finishing meant Liverpool had to settle for its third successive draw in Group B. \n“We our still in the group. We have a situation that we can come back in and cold Kazan is the next challenge,” Klopp added. \nSecond-half goals from Dawid Kownacki and Maciej Gajos secured victory for Lech Poznan, leaving Fiorentina bottom of Group I. \nStriker Giuseppe Rossi scored a last-minute consolation for the Viola, whose midfielder Ante Rebic was sent off in second-half stoppage time. \nLazio’s win was all the more impressive after defender Mauricio’s red-card dismissal in the sixth minute. Even a man down, goals from Alessandro Matri, Felipe Anderson and Antonio Candreva moved the Italian side three points clear at the top of its group. \nSaint-Etienne moved up to second behind the Rome-based club after a surprise 1-0 away win over Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk. Romain Hamouma scored shortly before the interval as the French side secured its first win of the group stage against last season’s runner-up. \nIn Group K, substitute Leroy Sane salvaged a 2-2 draw for Schalke at home to Sparta Prague. His strike canceled out another replacement, David Lafata’s effort, which gave the Czech side a second-half lead shortly after his introduction. \nAnderlecht came from behind to beat Tottenham 2-1 in Group J. Christian Eriksen gave the English Premier League side a fourth-minute lead, then Guillaume Gillet leveled with a well-taken volley. Stefano Okaka - on loan from Fulham - won it for the Belgian side with 15 minutes remaining. \nIn Group E, Villarreal thrashed Dinamo Minsk 4-0 with Cedric Bakambu’s scoring a first-half brace, and Roberto Soldado and Eric Bailly were on target for the Spanish club after the restart. \nPortugal midfielder Alan scored the winner two minutes from time as Sporting Braga beat Marseille 3-2 in Group F.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T02:39:44.626+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
