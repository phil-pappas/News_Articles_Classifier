In the first meeting between the two teams in Danville, Kentucky, in 2013, the Warriors fell, 49-20. Centre defeated the Warriors last year at Young-Wise Memorial Stadium, 35-26. Hendrix coach Buck Buchanan hoprd the Warriors can change things this year. \n“We have to start well,” he said. “Last year, we traded field goals for touchdowns in the first half, and then re-established ourselves in the second half. This year, we have to put ourselves in a position to succeed and not get in a hole.” \nOne major area Hendrix is going to have to concentrate on is Centre’s rushing attack. The Colonels duo of junior running backs Nolan Coulter and Amoh Kumengisa are averaging a combined 199.5 rushing yards per game. \nCoulter and Kumengisa come into the game as the South \nern Athletic Association’s No. 3 and No. 4 rushers with 101.3 and 98.5 rushing yards per game, respectively. \n“In order to counter their rushing attack, we have to win first downs on the defensive side of the ball,” Buchanan said. “They do a great job with their offensive line and are committed to running the football. They also have a fifth-year senior who can be trouble on third downs, so we’ll have to be careful with him.” \nThe Warriors know all too well about establishing the running game. \nJunior running back Dayton Winn ranks second in the conference in rushing, averaging 142.0 yards per game. Winn is fresh off a game (against Millsaps, where he set a career high in rushing yards with 226, and tied a career high with four rushing touchdowns. \n“We will continue to do what we have been doing and establish the run and put the ball where they aren’t,” Buchanan said. “They have a couple safeties who are good at run coverage and we will have to make sure we are big in the box.” \nWinn may be a pest for the Colonels’ defense because conference rushing leader Chandler Carroll from Chicago College ran for 311 yards on 30 carries against Centre in a victory last week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:57:13.589+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
