It is a learning curve and we have to fight through it.\" \nThe Cardinals first drive of the game could not have been more effective. The nine play, 61-yard drive was keyed by a perfect 5-for-5 performance by Pompton Lakes quarterback Kevin Cotter who capped the drive with a nine yard scoring pass to Nick Posimato. \nThe Knights quickly quieted the home fans though as they answered right back with a scoring drive of their own to tie the game at 7-7 just eight minutes into the game. \nAfter a high flying first four minutes the defenses then took over as neither team could mount much of a threat on their second drive. \nThe Cardinals lost possession on an interception on their third drive but it looked like they would get the ball right back as New Milford lined up for a punt on a fourth and 15 from their own 46-yard line but the Knights ran a fake punt and converted a 39-yard completion from Justice Witowski to Josh Burger to maintain possession. \nThree plays later the Knights were back in the endzone and the Cardinals trailed 14-7 with 4:28 left in the half. \nPompton Lakes methodically drove down the field and had a first and goal from the New Milford seven yard line but a pair of sacks stalled the drive and knocked the Cardinals out of field goal range so the teams went to half with the Knights leading 14-7. \nAfter a first half that featured only one penalty flag between the two teams a barrage of flags kept both offenses from gaining much steam in the second half. \n\"We have to fight through it and make our plays. They made their plays and we didn't make ours,\" said Mahoney who's team was called for seven of the games 16 second half penalties. \nMidway through the fourth quarter Pompton Lakes sophomore Kyle Shafer gave the Cardinals and their fans a huge lift when he intercepted a pass near midfield giving the Cardinals new life. \nA 14-yard completion from Cotter to Cruise Turner and a pair of Ronnie Campos runs in addition to a pair of personal foul calls against New Milford brought the ball down to the New Milford two-yard line. \nFrom there Shafer came in and dove into the endzone and with Chris Hester's extra point the game was tied at 14 all. \nThe Knights then went on a ten-play 76 yard drive that ended with a Christian Correa touchdown that gave New Milford a lead that they would not relinquish. \nPosimato returned the ensuing kick off to the Pompton Lakes 35-yard line but two plays later the Cotter was intercepted and Pompton Lakes fell to 3-3 on the season. \nWhile the outlook is not bright for the Cardinals making the North 1, Group 2 playoffs, Mahoney knows that his team needs to keep fighting because anything can happen. \n\"It won't get any easier next week. We just have to get to work and try to win a game next week, that is all that we can do,\" said Mahoney. \"We have lost three tight games so we do not control anything but it is a strange world out there so we have to go out there and try to win a game.\" \nThe Cardinals will travel to Lyndhurst to take on the Bears (3-4) Friday night at 7:00 p.m. \nEmail: costelloj@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T06:15:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:46:07.737+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
