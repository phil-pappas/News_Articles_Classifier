Receiving an historic and prestigious honor and award for outstanding academic achievement was senior Hope Bobcat football player Xavier McDonald, named the Arkansas Air National Guard Scholar of the Week. McDonald had a surprised visit on Tuesday afternoon during practice by media personnel of Hooten's Arkansas High School Football and National Guard representative to present and recognize him for excelling on and off the football field. McDonald has been known to be an overall model student in the classroom and a major contributor as a great athlete in athletics. Bobcat football head coach Jay Turley was thrilled for McDonald to be recognized for this special honor. Turley wasn't surprised McDonald would be considered for this award, due to being a exceptional student, athlete and young man. Since the beginning of Turley's coaching career, McDonald is the first student-athlete to receive this award. “Xavier is an exceptional student. He's always a pleasure to be around. He's helped us win football games the last two years. I always like to see kids achieve big things in life. He'll be successful in life. He takes academics very seriously. This award is a great credit to him,” said Turley. McDonald was more than honored and privileged to received this award. He's always wanted to strive for the best academically. Seeking encouragement since a child from his mother Alicia Williams, and his late grandmother and uncle urged him to work hard and one day it will pay off. McDonald believes this award is also a tribute to his family by the influence they've provided of being supportive throughout his life. “I feel very blessed. I never would have expected to win something like this. I was real surprised. It's just an honor to receive this award,” said McDonald. He currently holds a 4.0 grade point average, National Honor Society member and a three-sport athlete (football, basketball and baseball) for Hope Athletic programs. He plays linebacker and fullback for the Bobcats football team. He displays a big role for Bobcat defensive unit, which is considered one of the top defenses in the conference and state for class 5A. For basketball, he's been a key player and starter on the team last year. McDonald helped the Cats finish with a plus .500 season and apart of one the most over achieving teams in the senior boys basketball program at Hope High School. He was named the Outstanding Defensive Player for the Bobcats basketball team for 2014-15 season. During the 2013-14 basketball season, McDonald is apart of the Bobcats team that qualified for boys class 5A state tournament in Alma and helped them capture the first place tournament title for the Gold Division in the 4th Annual Paris Guaranty Bond Holiday Tourney in Paris, Texas.
