They notched their most lopsided win since blowing out the Jayhawks 34-0 in 2013. \nIowa State stretched its lead to 24-0 early in the second half on Warren’s 62-yard touchdown run, the longest of his career. Warren’s 7-yard score with 11:34 left made it 38-13. \nWarren needed just 18 carries to match the best day by an Iowa State back since Ryan Koch had 175 yards against Missouri in 2006. \nMontell Cozart was 15-of-21 passing for 150 yards before leaving with a sprained left shoulder. \nMarcquis Roberts had an 83-yard interception return for a score for Kansas (0-4, 0-1). \nKansas finally got on the board when Cozart found Tre Parmelee for a 47-yard touchdown pass. The point-after try bounced off the upright. \nKansas also ran for just 38 yards.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T19:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:56:47.480+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
