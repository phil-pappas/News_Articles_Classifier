On GEAR UP Transfer October 9, 2015, 11:15 AM by Angela Kennecke PIERRE, SD - \nWhile the U.S. Department of Education has not received a formal request from South Dakota to transfer the administration of the GEAR UP grant from Mid Central Education Cooperative's administration to the Board of Regents, the state says it is working with the federal government to make that change. \nAccording to Tony Venhuizen with the Governor's Office, the South Dakota Department of Education has told the U.S. Department of Education of its intention to transfer administration to the Board of Regents \n\"The South Dakota Department of Education is working with the U.S. Department of Education to understand the formal process to make that happen,\" Venhuizen said. \"Once that process is finalized, the South Dakota Department of Education will file a formal request.\" \nSouth Dakota Education Secretary Melody Schopp told the Native American Student Achievement Advisory Council this week that the state is waiting for word from the U.S. Department of Education about the future of a Native American college-readiness program. \nThe U.S. Department of Education confirms to KELOLAND News that South Dakota has not yet submitted an official request to replace Mid-Central. But as as soon as an official request is made, it will respond in no more than two business days. \nThe South Dakota Department of Education pulled the GEAR UP grant from Mid Central on September 16, after troubling audits.
