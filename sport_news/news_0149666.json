However, the U-17 group that kicks off its 2015 World Cup this weekend playing in one of the toughest groups might have a chance to win the whole tournament, at least if you believe the players. “We have a chance,” center back Danny Barbir told SI.com in a phone interview. “Our team is that good, I feel.” Christian Pulišić, the team’s primary playmaker who recently got time for Borussia Dortmund’s first team in a friendly, was a little more cautious in his prediction. The U.S. has been drawn into the tournament’s second-toughest group with host nation Chile, Nigeria and Croatia. (The only tougher one contains Australia, Germany, Mexico and Argentina.)\n“We’re going to take on the challenge,” Pulišić told SI.com, “and I think we’re going to be successful.”\nCoached by Richie Williams, the U.S. U-17s did put up some impressive results over the past year, beating England in the 2014 Nike International Friendlies series and splitting two games with Mexico in Mexico City last month despite traveling without two of their best players in Pulišić and Barbir.\nPlanet Futbol U.S. U-23s have final chance at Olympics after disappointing finish by Liviu Bird", "external_links": ["http://facebook.com/liviubird", "http://twitter.com/liviubird"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T12:10:27.395+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
