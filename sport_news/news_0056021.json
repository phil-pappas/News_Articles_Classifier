It was an intense game and the win didn't come easily.\"\nHe added: \"Obviously we're doing well, but there is so long to go and we have to simply focus on developing as a team.\"\nPaulo Sousa's Fiorentina have been described as one of the most stylish teams in the league and were unlucky not to snatch a share of the points.\nFiorentina bossed the opening half but the deadlock was finally broken two minutes after the restart when Insigne beat Ciprian Tatarusanu at his far post after running on to Marek Hamsik's superb defence-splitting pass down the left.\nMinutes later Higuain spurned the chance to double Napoli's lead when he bundled just over from close range.\nFiorentina appeared to be on their way to a share of the spoils after Croatia international Kalinic, who hit a hat-trick in a recent 4-1 romp over Inter, ran on to Josip Ilicic's delivery to slot the ball past Pepe Reina down low.\nBut minutes later the stadium erupted when Higuain dispossessed Ilicic deep in Fiorentina territory, played a one-two with Dries Mertens and held off his marker to beat Tatarusanu down low.\nSousa applauded his side's display and, like Sarri, refused to be drawn on La Viola's title-winning potential.\n\"You can never be satisfied, we're always working to improve, but I'm proud of the lads and their attitude to this game and a team that is technically and physically strong,\" said Sousa.\n\"We hope to be competitive, today as in every other game. For me, creating this winning culture is (equivalent to) winning the scudetto.\"\nElsewhere, Sampdoria's promising start came to a shuddering halt with a 2-0 defeat at Frosinone, while Lazio were stunned 2-1 away to Sassuolo.\nFrosinone grabbed just their second win of the campaign thanks to second-half goals in the space of a minute from Luca Paganini and Federico Dionisi.\nSassuolo were 2-0 up by the hour mark thanks to a Domenico Berardi penalty on seven minutes and Simone Missiroli's 60th minute strike.\nFelipe Anderson hit a consolation for Lazio on 67 minutes, but Stefano Pioli's men were well beaten.\nAtalanta, meanwhile, romped to 3-0 win over Carpi in Bergamo that came complete with a stunning corner kick goal from Alejandro Gomez.\nMauricio Pinilla gave the hosts a welcome eighth-minute opener after meeting Maxi Moralez's curling delivery from the right to head past Carpi 'keeper Vid Belec at his near post.\nBelec was beaten again on the stroke of half-time in more spectacular fashion, Gomez hitting a superb corner that sneaked over the entire Carpi defence and into the far top corner.\nAtalanta wrapped up the points when Luca Cigarini fired past Belec from the penalty spot on 63 minutes after Pinilla was fouled by Igor Bubnjic.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T22:24:04.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
