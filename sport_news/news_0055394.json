He was the only player to start all 34 games for the Eagles a season ago and ranked second on the team with 11.1 points per game. He ranked third in the OVC in steals (1.9/game), while averaging 11.1 points and 3.9 rebounds per contest. \n\"I think it's well deserved. He's paid his dues and he's been a consistent performer for us,\" said Woods. \"I don't think there is a player in our league that is as versatile, and he is one of the best on-ball defenders in the country. He's one of the top two or three players in our league. We're going to go as far as he goes.\" \nThe Eagles open play this season with an exhibition against Asbury (Ky.) on Nov. 3. They open the regular season at home against Cincinnati Christian on Friday, Nov. 13 at 7 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:54:42.661+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
