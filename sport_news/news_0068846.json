Despite having no experience of World Cup qualifying, and little experience of international soccer, South Sudan was boosted by its first win in a competitive international last month in African Cup qualifying.\nSouthampton's Wayamba didn't score but captained Kenya to a big win in Mauritius to put the Kenyans in a strong position in their tie ahead of the return leg on Sunday.\nOf all the 26 teams starting qualifying in Africa this week, South Sudan is not even the biggest outsider.\nSomalia and Djibouti, both among the six lowest-ranked in world soccer, will start their World Cup quests on Friday.
