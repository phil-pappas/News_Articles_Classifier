I can't think of a tee shot he missed all day. Maybe there was one. Maybe.\" \n\nThe highlight of the day was Mickelson holing a 45-foot trademark bunker blast for a birdie at the 13th after a rare wayward approach from the British Open champion Johnson. \n\n\"He hit exactly the shot he was talking about,\" said Johnson. \"I don't want to say he's the best, but he's as good as I've ever seen when it comes to wedges around the green and specifically out of the sand traps. Just awesome. \n\n\"What do you say when someone does that? He just gave me a handshake and said 'wow'.\" \n\nUS Captain Jay Haas said he was really happy for the five-time Major winner Mickelson, who has not won since the 2013 British Open two years ago. \n\n\"I was just real proud of him. I told him so,\" said Haas. \n\n\"He's dealt with pressure before, obviously, in many situations. Being a pick this time probably added to it a little bit. I'm happy the way he responded.\" \n\nWith a slender one-hole lead on 18 and Jason Day already safely in the fairway, Mickelson capped a stirring performance by launching an adrenalin-filled 350-yard drive down the par-five to leave Johnson just 186 yards from the pin. \n\n\"I thought Phil's drive at 18 was a big statement for him personally,\" said Haas. \n\n\"I thought they played extremely well. To beat that team was quite an accomplishment.\" Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T03:06:54.744+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
