Jimmy Howard faced 36 shots for Detroit (3-1). \nIt didn't take long for Carolina to take the lead, as McGinn scored just 55 seconds into his first game. \nThe 21-year-old picked up a neutral-zone turnover, broke in on goal and let go a shot that Howard barely deflected with his blocker. McGinn was able to put the rebound just inside the post for a memorable finish to his first shift. \nThis story has been corrected to show that Eric Staal scored, not Jordan Staal. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T05:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T05:50:18.086+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
