Regular-season basketball starts Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. against, once again, the Sixers. \nBoston's starting lineup appears to be settled: Tyler Zeller, David Lee, Jae Crowder, Avery Bradley and Marcus Smart. That backcourt will be lethal defensively, while Lee and Zeller will contribute quite a bit offensively. After struggling in the opening minutes of many games last season, Boston's starters should be able to tread water much more capably in 2015-16 if the preseason has been any indicator. \nMeanwhile, Jordan Mickey once again put together a promising performance in the fourth quarter, notching 10 points on 5-for-7 shooting to go with four rebounds and two loud blocks. The rookie will likely spend much of the first part of the season in Maine with the Red Claws, but the Celtics may need to take a real look at creating enough roster space to bring the springy forward up to the NBA level. \nMassLive Celtics reporter Jay King and sports producer Tom Westerholm discuss the starting unit's impact and Jordan Mickey's impressive preseason, in addition to what impressions may have changed about this team based on the 6-1 preseason performance. \nWatch the video above for more.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:04:00.857+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
