He said mere transfer of bureaucrats was not enough. “Now that Agriculture Minister Tota Singh has said that Chief Agriculture Officer Mangal Singh Sandhu had been directly corresponding with the Chief Minister’s office on the matter, it was up to the CM to clarify the role of Tota Singh. If found guilty, the CM has to act against him the minister,” he said. He said he was surprised at the BJP’s silence on the whole issue. “Even if Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had lost elections from Punjab, he was morally bound to visit the state which is reeling under severe agrarian crisis.” Smells another scam\nThe CLP leader said Rs32.65 crore was released by the Centre under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojna. “Under the scheme, the state was supposed to set up 3,950 demonstration plots for cotton crop of 10 hectares each. I checked up in most areas, no demonstration module of the sort was taken up. Where have the funds gone?” he questioned, claiming that at least half of the amount of Rs3,536 received by the state from the Centre had been embezzled. Flays tax on millers\nOn the imposition of 7 per cent tax re-imposed on rice millers, the CLPleader said it was another attempt of the state government to divide the farming community and the businessmen.

TNS ‘Cong shedding crocodile tears over farmers’ plight’ Ropar: Chief Minister Parkash Singh Badal on Friday said the SAD-BJP government always stood by the farmers in their difficult times and lashed out at the Congress for shedding crocodile tears over peasants suffering losses to their cotton crop.
