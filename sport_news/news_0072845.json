Thibodeau became the fastest coach in NBA history to 100 regular-season victories and could never fully be judged by postseason failures because of widespread injuries.\nIt's merely to say it's definitely a different era.\n\"There are a lot of differences,\" veteran guard Kirk Hinrich said. \"Fred's really calm. He's a very good teacher, makes his points. It's been a very enjoyable camp.\"\nLast season's constant simmering-below-the-surface enmity between Thibodeau and management was anything but enjoyable for all involved. And while Hoiberg's first camp already has been marred by injuries to Derrick Rose and Mike Dunleavy, teaching and absorbing a new system has been smooth sailing.\n\"The guys that have needed extra work, we've had them in here early,\" Hoiberg said. \"Some we've kept after late if they don't understand a certain set we're trying to do. But it's coming.\"\nPhotos of the 19th coach in franchise history (and former Bulls player)\nThe Bulls begin exhibition play Tuesday at home against the Bucks. Exhibition openers typically are sloppy, foul-filled affairs, but it at least will offer a sneak peak of Hoiberg's touted offensive schemes.\nTwo constant themes players mention are more freedom and more instinctive reads.\n\"There's a lot of motion,\" Gasol said. \"It's very dynamic. There's a lot of pace. It's more freedom, more reads. It should be effective and hard to guard.\"\nAdded Hinrich: \"It's a lot more reads, more free-flowing. It's all predicated on pace. Get stops and get into the right sets offensively.\"\nOptimism abounds for most teams this time of year. The Bulls are no exception. Hoiberg's personality has played a part.\n\"We have a very talented team and Fred has a good staff,\" Hinrich said. \"We have a long way to go to get on the same page and fully figure out what we're doing on offense and defense because it's different. But that's what camp's all about. And everybody seems like they came in in pretty good shape. We're excited to get after it.\"\nBulls' Kirk Hinrich on Fred Hoiberg's system Kirk Hinrich discusses adjusting to new coach Fred Hoiberg's system.\nKirk Hinrich discusses adjusting to new coach Fred Hoiberg's system.\nSee more videos Layups: Rose turned 27 Sunday.
