Coming Sunday: Jamal Murray \nIn the summer of 2010, Kentucky played exhibition games in Windsor, Ontario, which UK fans will remember is across the river from Detroit. A teenager in the stands pointed his iPhone at the UK players gathered at the bench. \n\"I remember having the worst zoomed-in picture of the Kentucky team,\" the photographer said. \"I remember snapping the picture, but I don't know if I ever imagined being in that group.\" \nThe photographer was Mychal Mulder, a junior-college transfer who arrives billed as a good shooter (of basketballs, if not photographs). \n\"I always had aspirations of playing at a high level of college basketball, and my goal was to play at Division I,\" he said. \"But I don't know if back then I thought I'd end up at such a high level.\" \nAfter leading Windsor's Catholic Central High to a Provincial championship, Mulder decided to attend Vincennes University. He turned down Detroit Mercy's scholarship offer. He wanted to improve his basketball profile. \n\"Also, I wanted to be a better student and get my body right,\" Mulder said. \"I was a little bit skinny.\" \nAs a sophomore for Vincennes, Mulder averaged 15.7 points and 6.4 rebounds. He made 46.3 percent of his three-point shots. He wanted to take a scholarship offer from either Creighton or Wichita State. \n\"Kentucky was pretty late to the party,\" he said. \nWhen asked how late, Mulder smiled and said, \"Like they were 'laaaa-te.' My coach (at Vincennes) wanted us to wait till after the season to commit. At first, I didn't want to do that. I wanted to take something when I had it.\" \nOf course, Kentucky's interest commanded Mulder's attention. \n\"I was just hyped,\" he said. \"I just wanted to get the process started. I was just really excited.\" \nPatience was rewarded as Mulder joins a Kentucky team expected to compete for a national championship. \nUK Coach John Calipari noted Mulder's shooting. The player made 38.3 percent of his three-point attempts for Vincennes as a freshman. \n\"What he does (is) he can shoot the ball,\" Calipari said. \"He's a catch-and-shoot guy.\" \nMulder attributed his shooting ability to self-esteem. \n\"It's probably a lot of confidence,\" he said. \"So I think I have a high level of confidence. That's probably why.\" \nWith Kentucky blessed with several talented guards, Calipari suggested that shooting alone is not enough to ensure playing time. \n\"He's a good athlete,\" the UK coach said before adding, \"and he has to find his way.\" \nIn explaining how he might weigh playing time for guards, Calipari contrasted Mulder with another newcomer, Charles Matthews. \n\"He's an athlete,\" the UK coach said of Mulder, who also played high school football and competed in track and field. \"Quick jumper. Not great with the ball, making plays and all that. Charles is probably a better finisher, but not as good a shooter. Charles (is) a little better defender. He may be a little faster than Charles. \n\"You carve your way. ... You've got to say I'm going to make sure you need my strengths on this team.\" \nMulder, who was born and raised in Windsor, said that he can be more than a shooter. \n\"I can shoot the three a little bit,\" he said. \"I shoot the ball from outside. But I like to do a little bit more than that. I like to provide as much as I can for the team. Be an all-around player. Penetrate. Try to be a little bit bouncy. Play above the rim. Grab some rebounds. Try to do it all.\" \nAnd, if necessary, shoot a photograph. Jerry Tipton: (859) 231-3227. Twitter: @JerryTipton.
