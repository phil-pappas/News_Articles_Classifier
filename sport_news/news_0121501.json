It all added up to a 41-21 victory by No. 11 Florida State that put the Cardinals in their place and sent them tumbling to a 2-4 overall record and a 1-2 ACC mark. \nThe third quarter was largely a meltdown for the Cards, who’d seized a 7-6 halftime lead by holding Florida State without a first-half touchdown for the first time in 16 games as well as surrendering zero first-half rushing yards. \nLouisville coach Bobby Petrino and Florida State coach Jimbo Fisher borrowed from Charles Dickens, both calling the game “a tale of two halves,” and it turned into the worst of times for Louisville. Sullivan | Effort lagging in Louisville loss \nAfter intermission, Heisman Trophy candidate Dalvin Cook, who’d run only seven times for 28 yards in the first half, humbled the Cards and started a Seminole snowball. His 54-yard touchdown run less than two minutes into the half was equal parts brilliance by Cook and comedy of errors for Louisville. \n“As a defense, we lost a little focus in the second half,” outside linebacker Trevon Young said. “Obviously we didn’t expect to come out and for that to happen to us.” \nCook took a handoff at FSU’s 46-yard line and darted toward the right. He beat outside linebacker DeVonte Fields to the edge, and Fields didn’t sprint to try catch up to him once he got by. \nCook then veered back inside before he got to cornerback Trumaine Washington, shook safety Josh Harvey-Clemons, then shook in rapid succession linebacker Keith Kelsey, safety Chucky Williams and Washington. Shaq Wiggins couldn’t shed a block coming in from the far side to catch him before he got to the end zone. \n“I had probably the same as everyone else’s thought, ‘Why didn’t we tackle him?’” said Young, who was not in the game on that play. “There were five or six guys on him, but he got away from us.” \nIt continued a trend that bothered Petrino early in the season of Louisville giving up scores on the first possessions of halves, and he said “we didn’t get it done” as far as tackling.

Jackson was intercepted on a deep pass in which James Quick looked open but tripped - a play the Cards thought could have drawn an interference flag - and FSU positioned itself for another TD to start the fourth. \nGame over. \n“I saw some guys out there that didn’t play hard all the time, and if you are not playing hard and going full speed against (Cook) he’s going to make you pay, and he sure did,” Petrino said. \nCook had 95 yards rushing in the third quarter – the biggest chunk of a 163-yard day – and Golson piled up 142 of his 372 passing yards. In all, FSU gained 236 total yards and outscored Louisville 21-7 in the third quarter. Instant Analysis | FSU rolls by U of L \nPetrino said FSU made a conscious effort to get Cook more involved in the third quarter and used run-heavy formations that U of L had practiced against. The Noles also converted 6 of 7 third downs in the second half after making only 2 of 7 in the first. \n“They did a good job blocking the front,” Petrino said. “We were out of position at safety a number of times, both against the run and the pass, and they really took advantage of it.” \nSo the midway point of the season has come with Louisville sitting not-so-pretty at two games under .500. \nThe good news for the Cards? After this game, the difficulty of their schedule in an unimposing ACC decreases markedly, and the path to six wins and bowl eligibility is still easy to see. \nLouisville’s next four opponents – Boston College, Wake Forest, Syracuse and Virginia – are arguably the weakest teams in the ACC, and the Cards will have three of those games at home. \nWin them all, and U of L is at six wins, with two winnable road games to go at Pittsburgh and Kentucky. \nSo as bad as 2-4 sounds, that record figures to get better soon. \n“We’ve lost to four pretty good teams, teams that are ranked in the top 10 right now, (some) teams that are still undefeated,” receiver Jaylen Smith said. “So it’s tough when you know you still could have beaten these teams, but at the same time, we feel as if we’ve put ourselves in a situation to move ahead and win these last six or seven games.” \nSteve Jones can be reached at (502) 582-7176 and swjones1@courier-journal.com.
