Kubiak quickly dismissed the idea. \n“I don’t think we’re through,” Kubiak said. “We all have to get better, and if we all get better, we’ll help him from that standpoint.” \nThe 39-year-old Manning has been bailed out by Denver’s top-ranked, intimidating defense, which has 22 sacks and 17 takeaways. These busting Broncos have Pettine’s attention. \n“We have not gone against a defense like this, one that rushes the passer like they do, get off the ball, very good in the secondary,” Pettine said. “They are No. 1 ... overall defensively. It is for a good reason.” \nWith an overtime win at Baltimore last week, the Browns exorcised a few demons inside their division. Now they’ve got a chance to help Pettine erase a piece of his past with Manning, who beat him in 2006 when he was on Baltimore’s coaching staff. \n“We held him to five field goals,” Pettine recalled. “They didn’t score a touchdown. But just the way the game went, we ended up losing 15-6, and it was a crusher.” \nHere are some other things to look for as the Broncos try to improve to 6-0 for the seventh time: \nWARD’S HOMECOMING \nBroncos safety T.J. Ward expects to have “some feelings” in his first game back in Cleveland since leaving as a free agent in 2014. \nWard was drafted by the Browns in 2010 and spent four seasons in Cleveland, making the Pro Bowl in his final year. \nWard hoped to stay with the Browns, but said he was never offered a contract. \n“I didn’t feel like I was welcomed back,” he said. “I never wanted to leave.” \nDYNAMIC DUO \nManning’s issues have not affected wide receivers Demaryius Thomas and Emmanuel Sanders, who rank first in the league with 72 combined receptions. They have also accounted for 834 yards receiving, also tops for any offensive tandem. \nDenver’s ground game, however, ranks 30th overall. \nSTILL THE MANNING \nBrowns linebacker Paul Kruger isn’t buying the talk that Manning is washed up. \n“There’s always going to be speculation with some of those older guys,” Kruger said. “‘When are they going to start deteriorating?’ or, ‘What plays can they make versus what they could’ve made back in the day?’ He looks pretty good to me.” \nKICKER CONNECTION \nBroncos kicker Brandon McManus attended North Penn High School in Lansdale, Pa, where Pettine once coached. \nMcManus has made all 12 of his field-goal attempts, including four over 50 yards. Pettine said he spoke with Dick Beck, who coached McManus. \n“He was quick to remind me he was 12 for 12 and 4 for 4 over 50 yards,” Pettine said. \nPERFECT VIEW \nKubiak has a deep background with the Browns. A backup quarterback behind John Elway, he was the holder on Rich Karlis’ winning field goal in overtime of the 1986 AFC championship, a game forever marked by “The Drive” that Elway led Denver on to tie the game in the final moments. \nCleveland fans have long contested the kick was wide left, and Kubiak attested it was close.
