The Rennes forward was expelled too, in the 84th minute for a dangerous tackle. \nSeventh-place Rennes remains one point ahead of Lorient and nine points behind leader Paris Saint-Germain, which hosts Saint-Etienne on Sunday. \nPortuguese left back Guerreiro put the hosts in front in the 24th minute from Stevem Moreira's assist with his first goal this season. \nLorient had two more good chances to extend its lead through captain Yann Jouffre and Vincent Le Goff before Sio was fouled by Kone as he raced toward the goal. \nThe momentum switched to Rennes and Grosicki put the teams level. He came close of adding a second goal with a chip just wide in the 89th minute. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T20:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:47:57.776+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
