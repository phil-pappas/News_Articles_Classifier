The trolley is no more than a two-man show always run by Nadim and Diana Kiwan, and it’s also the only dig on campus that serves Lebanese food. Corner of Commonwealth Avenue and Granby Street. Ashli Molina / Boston.com Previous -- of -- Next Limoo Tea Bar offers what almost no other tea spots have: alcohol-infused bubble tea, a loud game of Jenga, plus truffle fries. The two-floor bar works well for a date night or a board game with friends. 1032 Commonwealth Ave. Matthew J. Lee / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Tatte Bakery and Cafe has five locations, but its Beacon Street cafe right off BU’s south campus was where it all began. Though the sweets and pastries reel customers in, we also suggest the Shakshuka for breakfast, a traditional North African dish with poached eggs and feta cheese in a hot pan. 1003 Beacon St. Joanne Rathe / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Otto’s Pizza sits on BU’s west campus. It’s a go-to for large pizzas with unusual toppings that make for a flavorful experience—for fall, try the butternut squash, ricotta, and cranberry pizza paired with a cold glass of Downeast cider. 888 Commonwealth Ave. Michele McDonald / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next The Lower Depths Tap Room prides itself on serving very rare and limited beers, such as the Weigenstephaner Comet Weiss. They currently have 16 rotating draft beers, over 150 bottles of beer, and offer pub grub. Beer lovers celebrate brews at their Beer Socials or through the Mug Club. 476 Commonwealth Ave. Yoon S. Byun / The Boston Globe Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next Scoozi has a reputation among BU students for its pitchers of sangria and truffle mac-n-cheese. It also offers an extensive menu of paninis, pizza, pasta, salads, and burgers. 580 Commonwealth Ave. Photo courtesy of Scoozi Previous -- of -- Next Fin’s Sushi & Grill is your classic Japanese sushi hub, but the signature rolls set its sushi apart. Go with the Snow Mountain Maki (crab meat mixed with mayo, shrimp tempura, and avocado topped with coconut flakes) or the Christmas Maki (shrimp tempura roll topped with tuna, avocado, tempura flakes, and sauce). 636 Beacon St. Photo courtesy of Fin’s Sushi & Grill Previous -- of -- Next T. Anthony’s was opened in 1976 due to the lack of late night eats around BU, and since then, it’s carried a long rich history with the university. Dozens of BU sports photos hang on one of its walls, taking visitors back to momentous victories. But the real reasons to visit are the very large, cheesy, and greasy pies and the long-time staff that gives the eatery a homey feel. 1016 Comm. Ave. Photo courtesy of T. Anthony’s Previous -- of -- Next Live Noodles provides an authentic dining experience: the menu is in Mandarin (with photos to help you figure out what to order) and an opportunity to see the chefs hand-pull the long noodles through the kitchen window. Any dish is worthy, but make sure to pair it with the pork soup dumplings. 1026 Comm. Ave. Photo courtesy of Live Noodles Previous -- of -- Next Brown Sugar is a cozy restaurant that offers great Thai fare. They celebrate birthdays like no other restaurant: with colorful disco lights and a clubby version of the Happy Birthday song. 1033 Comm. Ave. Photo courtesy of Elisha Machado Previous -- of -- Next Advertisement Previous -- of -- Next Gyu-Kaku’s social atmosphere is only half the appeal. The personal grill for each table completes the experience—cook what you want, when you want it. At the Japanese barbeque restaurant you can cook a Japanese skirt steak over a flaming charcoal grill and sip on sake after. 1002 Beacon St. Photo courtesy of Gyu-Kaku\nBy Ashli Molina @MolinaAshli Share 0 Tweet 0 Advertisement Ben & Jerry’s now has beer, ice cream, AND beer-flavored ice cream 10.22.15 | 12:37 PM Getting ready for Halloween with Tito’s 10.22.15 | 12:19 PM 11 restaurants to try near BU 10.22.15 | 11:28 AM Road kill will be served at a wild game dinner in Vermont 10.22.15 | 9:56 AM A Boston pizza place is trying something unusual.
