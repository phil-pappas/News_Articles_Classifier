Outside linebacker, wide receiver, safety; wherever coach Mike Sheridan has put him, Stone has thrived. \nYet he waited for his opportunity to be the Gaels’ featured running back. That chance arrived this season, and Stone has torn up defenses through St. Mary’s first five games. \nHis latest performance came Saturday when he ran for 325 yards on 28 carries in the No. 6 Gaels’ 35-6 win over Weehawken. He ran for four touchdowns and added a 36-yard scoring pass in the second quarter to Shawayn Gresham. \n“He’s the heartbeat,” Sheridan said. “He’s a leader, and he loves the game so much, tell him what to do and he believes he can do it better than anybody else.” \nBecause of his athleticism and play-making ability, Stone gives Sheridan options within St. Mary’s offensive system. That’s especially critical after quarterback Richard Marques suffered a hairline fracture in his left shoulder during last week’s game against Wallington. \nSheridan moved Pat Taylor in from wide receiver to fill in for Marques, who’s out four to six weeks. Taylor ran the Gaels’ offense well, and showed a strong arm with a 29-yard pass to Ryan Watson in the first quarter. \nBut St. Mary also began having Stone run the Wildcat and that’s quickly become another threat for defenses. \n“In a way it’s made us better, now that both packages are getting developed,” Sheridan said. \nStill, Stone did some of his best work at tailback Saturday. He had touchdown runs of 71 and 68 yards, shedding tacklers the entire way down the field. Stone almost had a 65-yard touchdown run, but it was called back because of a penalty against the Gaels. \nWeehawken put together a scoring drive late in the first quarter. Isaiah Abreu had 18- and 36-yard runs to help the Indians get down to the Gaels’ 3-yard line. Joan Andujar finished off the drive with a TD run. \nThe Indians just couldn’t find a way to stop Stone, although few teams have. \nSheridan has coached plenty of great running backs, but said Stone is “as good or better than anyone I’ve ever had or seen.” \nSheridan said Stone’s leadership in the locker room is just as important as anything he’s done on the field. \nLast season, Stone backed up tailback Keon Banks. He said during that time, he watched and learned, focus on improving. All the studying Stone put in has paid off this season. \nBut he’s not ready to declare this season a total success just yet. \n“Right now, it’s nothing because I want a championship,” Stone said. “This stuff right here, it’s a good win. It’s great to have. But it won’t mean nothing to me or the team if we don’t win a championship.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T07:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T00:19:52.184+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
