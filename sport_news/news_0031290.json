The No. 1 job a free safety has is to not let any offensive players get behind him, and Aikens has failed to do that three times this season. All three occasions led to touchdowns that he’s at least partly responsible for. He’s been splitting the safety workload with Michael Thomas, but the coaches might want to consider opening up that competition again to determine who is the better fit to play alongside strong safety Reshad Jones. \nA fourth-round pick last year, Aikens has been a major disappointment as Louis Delmas’ replacement at free safety.

Wake, who has 63 sacks in his seven-year career with the Dolphins, has contributed just one tackle in his 147 snaps this season. While it’s important to point out that he’s nursing a hamstring injury, it’s obvious that he’s become a liability against the run, which explains why the Dolphins are primarily using him as a situational pass rusher. Considering Wake is slated to earn $8.4 million next season, his future with the team is clearly on shaky ground. \nIt’s never easy to watch a Pro Bowl player age, but that’s clearly what’s happening to Wake, who turns 34 in January.
