In Week 2, it was Patriots coach Bill Belichick, then the Giants' defensive coordinator. On Sunday, Giants coach Tom Coughlin, who coached wide receivers under Bill Parcells back in 1990, will face the team he helped beat 20-19 in that Super Bowl.\nCoughlin, who was up in the press box for the kick, recalls that season vividly all these years later.\n\"I remember how the Bills beat us going down the stretch at home here,\" Coughlin said on a conference call with Buffalo media Wednesday. \"We had come off the win in San Francisco to play another just outstanding offensive football team. I remember what we tried to do in terms of how we attempted to play and try as best we could to keep the ball away from them.\n\"I remember how close a football game it was ... It came right down to what most people didn't recognize the fact that that was not an easy field goal. Forty-seven yards is not an easy field goal. It was just barely wide right, and obviously I was in the press box at the time, ecstatic. In the Desert Storm Super Bowl, a short week, we were able to come in from San Francisco after another incredible win and have an opportunity to play in the Super Bowl and win it.\"\nCoughlin, a Waterloo, N.Y., native and Syracuse University grad, is right about the kick being a tough one for Norwood, who was just 1-for-5 in his career on kicks of 40-plus yards on grass. Either way, it's a miss that defines Norwood's legacy in Buffalo.\nThe loss was the first of four consecutive Super Bowl losses for the Bills. Meanwhile, Parcells' Giants staff had numerous coaches go on to be head coaches, including Coughlin, Belichick, Romeo Crennel and Al Groh.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T02:16:20.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
