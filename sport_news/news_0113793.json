So I don’t know where that came from.”\nIn any event, Peterson was affected more by the Lions defense than by any lingering effects from the episode with his stomach.\nWith the exception of a 75-yard jaunt in the third quarter, the Lions contained Peterson, allowing him just 23 yards on the 18 carries beyond his big run.\nAnd even on the long run, Detroit forced Minnesota to settle for a field goal as Ziggy Ansah caught up with Peterson before he could cross the goal line.\n“I take my hat off to him,” Peterson said of Ansah. “I got tackled at the 3-yard line.”\nAfter the game, Peterson searched for Ansah but couldn’t find him as players mingled on the field.\n“Because that effort he put in, not to give up on a play, it saved a touchdown,” Peterson said, “and kept their hopes of coming back alive.”\nFollow Jarrett Bell on Twitter @JarrettBell .\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://www.twitter.com/JarrettBell", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T03:03:59.979+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
