It guided him not to Madison or East Lansing or Columbus but to Atlanta, San Antonio and the current mecca of basketball virtuosos, the Bay Area. \nJordan had been a longtime proponent of the Princeton offense, which he implemented successfully at multiple stops as an NBA coach. But times change, and with a bona fide basketball renaissance afoot in the NBA, Jordan sensed the trickle-down effect it would have and the pull it would have on players coming into the college game. Jerry Carino's Big East, Big Ten hoops forecast \n“I like what the 3-point line has done, and what Golden State does, what Atlanta does and what the Spurs do,” Jordan said Thursday during Big Ten men's basketball media day. “I like that sort of basketball — and look, those are all successful programs and franchises. So I copied a little bit off of that. \n“Kids look up to a James Harden and Steph Curry — they do it already. I have a 17-year-old son, and that’s all he talks about. That’s all they look at. They want to see the 3-ball.” \nBishop Daniels said everyone has the green light this winter for Rutgers. (Photo: Patricia Banks/Rutgers Athletics) \nBut seeing it and finding players to actually do it are two very different things, and Jordan’s luck in pulling off the latter last season was atrocious. A year ago, the Scarlet Knights scored fewer 3-pointers (4.8 per game) than any other Big Ten team, shooting them at an icy 29.5 percent clip. \n“Of course we have a lot of players on the team who can actually shoot the 3,” senior guard Bishop Daniels said. “They were recruited out of high school to knock down the 3. Coach is giving everybody the green light to shoot it. It’s just us needing to knock it down.” \nDaniels said the Scarlet Knights are in the gym working, literally, night and day on that very skill, but the truth is, elevating the team’s outside game is just one brick in the Rutgers rebuild. \nJordan believes the program has already bolstered its talent base — “We have eight guys who could possibly start,” he says — which has led to more competitive practices and a deeper bench that might soon allow Rutgers to start picking up full court and hounding ball-handlers more often. And the newcomers — prized freshman point guard Corey Sanders and juco transfer Deshawn Freeman, in particular — are expected not only to help pave a path for future next-level recruits to follow to New Brunswick but also to fit into Jordan’s new offensive system and help pick up the slack for departed Rutgers scorers Kadeem Jack and Myles Mack from the jump. The night Springsteen played the Barn at Rutgers \nThe Scarlet Knights are no one’s favorite to win the Big Ten this season, but every masterwork began as a lump of clay. Jordan already sees the faint outlines of something special. \n“I was taught, you either sell winning or hope,” Jordan says. “And if you aren’t winning, have a future in front of you. Develop your future. And we’ve got a great future.” 1 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.app.com/1Lws46R TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T02:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T16:25:04.038+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
