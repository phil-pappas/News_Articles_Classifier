(AP Photo/Paul Sancya) \nWe’ve seen position players pitch before, usually when their teams have fallen way behind late in games, but we’ve never seen it before at this point in the season. In the ninth inning of Tuesday’s Game 4 of the ALCS, with his Blue Jays on the wrong end of a 14-2 deficit to the Royals, Cliff Pennington took the mound and made history. \nIt was the first time a non-pitcher had thrown to a batter in an MLB playoff game. Pennington, 31-year-old utilityman, had never pitched before at the major league level. Cliff Pennington is warming up in the bullpen. Is it raining frogs where you are and, if so, can you close my windows? \n— Baseball Tonight (@BBTN) October 20, 2015 I don't like using Pennington to pitch here, mainly because at this point he's a candidate to start game six. \n— Down Goes Brown (@DownGoesBrown) October 20, 2015 \nSo how did Pennington fare? Well, he did the job, needing to get just one out to end the top of the ninth. Pennington did give up two singles, allowing a run that was charged to reliever Mark Lowe, before retiring Ben Zobrist on a foul-out. \nThe former Diamondback, who was traded to the Blue Jays in August, now adds pitcher to the positions he has played this season, including second base, third base, shortstop and outfield. Pennington also showed off an arm capable of hitting over 90 on the radar gun. Pennington just threw 90. Oddly the crowd here is going NUTS. #bluejays \n— Britt McHenry (@BrittMcHenry) October 20, 2015 If only we would've known Cliff Pennington could pitch too… \n— Arizona Diamondbacks (@Dbacks) October 20, 2015 91mph 2-Seamer, a slider, and a change up?? Pennington might need to move to the bullpen full time. \n— kraft (@KonCra) October 20, 2015 \nThe fans in Toronto — or what was left of them — may have enjoyed the sight of an infielder taking the mound, but the reality is that their team is now on the precipice of seeing its season end, having fallen behind the Royals 3-1 in the series. But if they do fall short of the World Series, at least the Blue Jays can say they made history in the ALCS. Des writes for the Early Lead and the D.C.
