Central will not be in the same conference as Mountain Home next season, leaving the Bombers winless in school history against the Tigers. \nAfter the Bombers failed to put points on the board with a 62-yard drive on their first possession, Central – which improved to 2-4 overall and 2-1 in league play – struck with 63 yards on one play. Richard Hayes jaunted for the long touchdown run, making it 7-0 with 6:53 left in the first quarter. \nThe Bombers put together another long drive, this time gaining points, to even the score. Mountain Home went 69 yards in 12 plays, capped by a 6-yard touchdown pass from Zane Walker to Payton Parker, who made the catch with the defender holding the senior receiver. \nCentral began to give the ball to 6-foot-1, 205-pound freshman phenom Oscar Adaway III on its next drive, and Adaway plunged in from 4 yards out with 8:08 left in the half to give the Tigers a 14-7 lead. \nAdaway added another touchdown from 1 yard out on Central's next drive to make it 21-7. \nAfter the teams traded punts, Mountain Home took over with 41 seconds remaining and threw three incomplete passes, leaving 21 seconds on the clock for Central. \nThe big play bit the Bombers again as senior receiver Zachary McFadden made his second catch of 40 yards or more, taking a 73-yard reception to the house after his defender slipped going for the ball. The PAT kick failed, but the Bombers trailed 27-7 going into halftime. \nAdaway added a 9-yard touchdown to open the second half, pushing the lead to four scores. Mountain Home took its first possession of the half and drove 66 yards, but once again failed to put points on the board, driving down to the Central 1-yard line before fumbling the ball away.

McFadden totaled 116 yards on just two catches for the Tigers. \nWalker was 10 of 19 passing for 68 yards for the Bombers. Parker caught five passes for 24 yards, Drew Strope caught three for 26 yards, and Marcus May and Isaac McKay each caught one pass for 9 yards. \nCord Smith led Mountain Home's rushing attack with 68 yards on nine carries, while Walker kept 13 times for 54 yards, McKay netted 19 yards on five carries and Riley Peters notched 18 yards on six totes. \nFor local sports updates, follow Neal Denton on Twitter @BBSportsNeal and Like his Facebook page at facebook.com/BBSportsNeal 5 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://www.baxterbulletin.com/story/sports/2015/10/09/central-topples-mhhs/73698226/ TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T06:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T07:53:00.118+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
