Austin Lumberjacks in a 70-7 thrashing.\nHere are a few thoughts from the Horned Frogs' victory.\n1. Doing what works. Doug Meacham and Sonny Cumbie wanted Trevone Boykin to focus on his short-to-mid-range passes early this season, plays Boykin called 'layups' at Big 12 media days earlier this season. He did that against Minnesota with mixed results, and again early against Stephen F. Austin, ignoring Kolby Listenbee on streaks down the side in favor of check downs. But on TCU's second drive, one play changed the whole dynamic of TCU's offense early in 2015. Boykin found a sprinting Listenbee down the left side of the field for a 51-yard diving grab, opening up the offense and bringing back some of the big play ability that gave the Frogs a massive boost a year ago. The Frogs had just three passes of more than 15 yards against Minnesota. Against SFA, they had five in the first half alone, including a 60-yard touchdown to Listenbee later in the first quarter.\n2. Boykin blossoming. TCU's Heisman Trophy candidate had his world rocked a bit against Minnesota. In the opener, Boykin needed to make a ton of plays happen with his feet. Between dancing out of the pocket to set up a throw and running downfield, he took a beating against Minnesota. Against the Lumberjacks, Boykin didn't have to put nearly as much of a toll on his body. He ran a few times and scrambled when necessary, but he made most of his biggest plays with his arm. He displayed impressive strength with long those long throws to Listenbee, but also showed some nice touch with floaters in the corner to Josh Doctson and Ja'Juan Story. Boykin finished his day throwing 18-of-27 for 285 yards and four touchdowns, his lone blemish being a deflected interception late in the second quarter.\n3. Turpin is legit. The loss of Cameron Echols-Luper is becoming more and more irrelevant by the day. That's not a shot at Echols-Luper, who is now a quarterback at Arkansas State, but a testament to the player KaVontae Turpin is becoming. The true freshman has been explosive in the punt return game and seems poised to break one for a score each time touches the ball. He made a few appearances in the receiving game against SFA, scoring his first touchdown on a six-yard catch-and-run in which his second effort after contact was the difference. He made guys miss with fancy footwork, including a step back to make a defender miss that sent the crowd into a frenzy. Turpin is turning into a must-watch athlete in Fort Worth that Frogs fans should get used to seeing.\n4. Winning the battle, losing the war. Despite wining the game on the field, the Horned Frogs were dealt a huge loss early in this one. After a week in which both starting linebackers from a week ago were ruled out for the foreseeable future, TCU needed to stay as healthy as possible with the lowly Lumberjacks in town. It didn't exactly work out as Kenny Iloka was removed from the game with an injury in the first quarter. Iloka, the starting weak safety, went down clutching his knee before being helped off the field by athletic department personnel and eventually walking to the locker room under his own power. He was seen in street clothes on crutches in the fourth quarter, and any extended absence would be another blow to a TCU defense already dealing with a ton of injuries.\n5. Finding the right fit. Gary Patterson has never had much trouble putting together a defense, even with the type of personnel issues TCU is dealing with this season. That was evident against Stephen F. Austin. True, it was just SFA, but the TCU defense was a swarming animal against the Lumberjacks. The defensive line continues to be a huge asset in stopping the run, and the mix-and-match group of linebackers and defensive back held its own once again. Freshmen Ty Summers and Montrel Wilson teamed up for a solid game as starters at linebacker, while safety Denzel Johnson was all over the place delivering powerful hits. Once again, it's only SFA, but the signs are encouraging for this TCU defense trying to find a good mix of guys.\nMORE TCU-STEPHEN F.
