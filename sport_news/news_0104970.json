The Giants may not be great or dominant, but they're good enough to beat inferior competition.\nPOLITI: It's time for Beckham to stop the nonsense\nAfter opening the season with meltdown losses to the Cowboys and Falcons, the Giants dominated the Washington Redskins, 32-21, at home in Week 3, took care of a sloppy Bills team, 24-10, in Week 4 and did enough to beat the 49ers.\nThese are your 2015 Giants. They could have been 5-0, but they have heart. They never give up. And they make things interesting.\nThe Good\nThe Giants moved the ball up and down the field all evening, even with a depleted receiving corps. Manning threw for over 441 yards and three touchdowns. The Giants punted just twice.\nAnd when they needed it most, Manning -- who threw an end zone interception with five seconds remaining in the first half -- drove the Giants for the winning score. The Giants went 81 yards in 1:20, with Donnell making a leaping touchdown grab over two defenders with 21 seconds remaining.\nThe Giants' offense (minus red zone stumbles) was in sync.\nThe Bad\nThe Giants defense yielded 27 points to a struggling offense, mostly because the pass rush couldn't get near San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick most of the evening. If Kaepernick and the 49ers weren't ranked No. 32 in passing offense, the Giants would've been in trouble. Still, Kaepernick threw for 250 yards and two touchdowns.\nThe Giants best pass rusher again appeared to be 245-pound fullback/defensive tackle Nikita Whitlock. He forced a holding penalty on a third-quarter play. That may have been the closest the Giants came to Kaepernick in the second half.\nThe Ugly\nThe Giants had a chance for points at the end of the first half. With a chance to take a commanding lead, they were at the San Francisco 11-yard line with 11 seconds remaining and a 13-6 edge. The only thing the Giants couldn't afford was a turnover. What did they do? The NFL's No. 31-ranked red zone offense turned it over when Manning threw a poor pass in the right corner of the end zone to a Beckham, who was covered, and the pass was intercepted by 49ers cornerback Tramaine Brock.\nJordan Raanan may be reached at jraanan@njadvancemedia.com .
