But the energetic — if small — crowd grew concerned with just over eight minutes remaining in the third when Jets defenseman Dustin Byfuglien — who didn’t take long to make himself a villain in another arena — scored on a long power-play shot to cut the Isles lead to 3-2.\nBut urban transplant Isles weathered that storm, and after a Josh Bailey empty-netter with 18.1 remaining, are off the schneid.\n“We need to score some goals,” coach Jack Capuano said before the game, and his team immediately listened.\nBy the end of the second period, the Isles were up 3-1 and had outshot the previously undefeated Jets (2-1-0) by a wide margin of 36-15. If it wasn’t for Winnipeg net minder Andrej Pavelec — who stopped John Tavares on a third-period penalty shot with 2:15 remaining that would have put the game away — the score could’ve been quite worse.\nThe Jets began the game by taking five first-period penalties, and with the Islanders having gone 0-for-4 in the two games against the Blackhawks, Capuano was looking for more from his man-advantage.\n“Special team is always a factor, and it’s proved to be a factor in both games,” said Capuano, whose team had hung with the speed and skill of the Blackhawks during the first ever Brooklyn home opener on Friday night, a 3-2 overtime loss decided by a Patrick Kane game-winner on a 4-on-3 power play.\n“Shots in that game in Chicago [on Saturday], 5-on-5, were 24-23 for the New York Islanders,” Capuano said, referring to the 4-1 loss. “[The advantage was] 11-1 in shots [for the Blackhawks] on their power play. So when we get the puck on our power play — obviously entries have been a problem for us — but once we get in, we have to find a way to get pucks to the net.”\nThat’s just what Capuano got, even if it did take four fruitless opportunities to start the first. On the fifth, with under a minute remaining in the period, Ryan Strome got one off the backboards and netted it for a 1-0 lead. Brock Nelson made it 2-0 with an accurate wrist shot off the rush at 6:46 of the second, and Tavares got his second of the season on a second-period power play.\nMark Scheifele managed to cut the lead to 3-1 going into the third when he netted a wrist shot from the slot passed Thomas Greiss, who is the de facto starter while Jaroslav Halak remains out with an upper-body injury.\nHalak has not played this season, still trying to get into game shape after the injury undercut his training camp routine. Capuano called him “day-to-day” as he continued to skate with the goaltending coaches back on Long Island.\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under brock nelson ,  jaroslav halak ,  john tavares ,  new york islanders ,  ryan strome ,  thomas greiss ,  winnipeg jets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T18:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:32:36.506+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
