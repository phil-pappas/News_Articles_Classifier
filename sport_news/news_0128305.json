Lonny Haschel said Tuesday that the trooper, whose name wasn't released, has apologized for the judgment error. \nThe trooper on Sunday stopped a Bentley on a Dallas-area turnpike because the car appeared to violate window tint laws. Haschel says the occupant, later identified as Michael, discussed the tint with the trooper. No citation was issued. \nThe trooper then had Michael step out for a picture. DPS didn't say who took the photo, which Michael posted on Instagram with the caption: \"Got stopped just to take a picture.\" \nMichael later Sunday played in the 30-6 loss to New England. \nThe Cowboys declined comment Tuesday. \nOnline: \nMichael's Instagram account: https://instagram.com/chrismike33/?hl=en Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
