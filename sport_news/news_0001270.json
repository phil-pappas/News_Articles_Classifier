The team has since fallen to 0-5, but the players still fully support coach Jim Caldwell.\n\"I think Coach Caldwell is far from losing us,\" wide receiver Golden Tate said Monday. \"I know he still has my attention and the respect that we give him in the meeting today and last week and the week before and all year.\n\"We trust in Coach Caldwell. We know that we're going to get out of this slump. It's just tough right now.\"\nWith an embarrassing — a word used by Caldwell and players — 42-17 loss to the Arizona Cardinals, the Lions now probably need to win out for a repeat trip to the postseason — they were the sixth seed at 11-5 last year.\nDETROIT NEWS\nNiyo: Lions have trouble at the top\nOn Monday, Bleacher Report reported that anonymous players are concerned that Caldwell is starting to lose the locker room, but the players who spoke Monday denied the idea.\n\"That's BS,\" Ihedigbo said. \"If someone is going to put something like, 'Anonymous player said X,Y, Z,' give me a break. You could write whatever you want and try to throw anonymous player at the end to try to get some credibility.\n\"He's our head coach. We stand by him. We believe in everything that he's doing and how he's leading us. We owe it to him to play our best football come Sunday, and to each other.\"\nThe confidence in Caldwell extends to the rest of his staff, too. Tate used an analogy from offensive coordinator Joe Lombardi Monday before explaining where he heard it. Effectively, the Lions need to hit the reset button as if they're playing a video game, Tate said.\nDefensive coordinator Teryl Austin's message, via Ihedigbo, was that the players have to be the ones to turn this season around.\n\"It won't change until we win,\" Ihedigbo said of the mood in the locker room. \"No different than where we were last week. We're still without a win, and we've got to go back to the drawing board to get it. So, it's kind of the exact same position. Nothing will change until we change it.\"\nLions players are taking responsibility for their poor play thus far, and when the coaches pulled quarterback Matthew Stafford in favor of Dan Orlovsky in the third quarter Sunday, it was a reminder that the coaches will hold players responsible for their errors.\n\"It's definitely not something that you like to see, but we definitely have to be held accountable,\" wide receiver Lance Moore said. \"This is football at its highest level. Don't like to see it happen, but it happens and guys got to continue to play.\n\"Just because Dan was in there doesn't mean there should be any drop-off. He's been in the league a long time, and we've just got to get right.\"\nIhedigbo said guys still showing up for work is one sign that players still have faith in the coaches. But, after starting 0-5, the players are still searching for ways to win.\n\"It's tough on us right now,\" Tate said. \"It's tough on this city; it's tough on this organization. But, we've got to find a way out, and we will find a way out. And I'm going to make it my duty to be a big part of that. I'm hungry, I'm passionate, I'm emotional about this. I love this game, and I'm ready to win.\"\njkatzenstein@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/jkatzenstein \nLions coach Jim Caldwell on why he benched QB Matthew Stafford and how the team is capable of playing better.
