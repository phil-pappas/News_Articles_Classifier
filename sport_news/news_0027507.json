The rookie lefty takes the mound Wednesday in Game 4 of the NLCS with the Mets one win away from the World Series.\n“I think it’s going to be a lot of fun,” Matz said before Tuesday’s 5-2 Mets victory in Game 3. “I’ve never been here before or played here before. Never even seen a game here. I’m really excited. I’ve heard these fans are great. It’s a great ballpark, lot of history here, so it’s going to be fun.”\nAt least some of that will be up to Matz and how he performs.\nUnlike the Dodgers, who Matz had success against during the regular season, the young left-hander never has faced the Cubs inexperienced lineup.\n“I don’t really have any history with them,” Matz said. “They look like a tough lineup. They’re a bunch of young, fiery guys. Matt [Harvey] and Noah [Syndergaard] have done a great job the first two games, so I’m just going to watch Jacob [deGrom], see how he attacks them, and try to just build off those guys.”\nAnother challenge will be pitching on irregular rest, something Matz has grown accustomed to while dealing with injuries — and waiting his turn in the postseason. He last pitched in Game 4 of the NLDS on Oct. 13, a 3-1 loss against Clayton Kershaw.\n“Really, it hasn’t been too challenging,” Matz said. “I’m still able to get my work in in between starts. You know, you’re not on necessarily a routine as much … as I was during the regular season. But I’m still able to get my work in and I still feel fresh for each start.”\nThough this game will be taking place halfway across the country, Matz still will have a cheering section, as his family opted to go to Chicago instead of attending the first two games of the series at Citi Field.\n“I was going to leave a bunch [of tickets] for some family, but when I found out that I’d be pitching here, they just kind of canceled so they could spend some money on their flights and stuff versus all the tickets,” Matz said.\nHe has done his best to familiarize himself with Wrigley, joining teammates on a tour of the scoreboard on Monday.\n“I just think [of] how old it is,” Matz said of his thoughts on the park. “I just think it’s really cool. So we just wanted to check it out and soak it in as much as we can.”\n  chicago cubs ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets ,  nlcs ,  steven matz", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T07:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:01:55.685+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
