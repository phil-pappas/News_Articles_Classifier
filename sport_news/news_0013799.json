However, just before the international break, the Portuguese boss ruled that out after claiming the Ghana international is yet to adapt to the Premier League pace. \nIt looked like Ivanovic's injury was going to force Mourinho to reconsider his plans ahead of the Aston Villa game. However, the Portuguese boss has claimed he may use Aina instead, or the versatile Ramires or Kurt Zouma. \n\"We have only Ivanovic's injury and Courtois recovering, everybody else is available,\" Mourinho said in the press conference ahead of the game against Aston Villa. \n\"I have four solutions: I have Azpilicueta, I have the adaptation of Zouma or Ramires and I have Ola Aina, an 18-year-old who has never played a Premier League game but he's a boy with lots of potential. He's also an option. It depends on matches, opponents, the moment, but we have solutions.\" \nThe Chelsea manager, meanwhile, has also lavished praise on Ruben Loftus-Cheek while suggesting the 19-year-old midfielder could make his first Premier League start of the campaign. He said: \"Ruben has been with us since January, working with us every day, having the opportunity to play some matches, having an evolution physically, mentally, tactically. I think he's going to be a really top player. He's ready.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T17:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:07:06.858+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
