Ali, UEFA president Michel Platini and former FIFA vice president Chung Mong-joon were the only declared candidates.\n• WAHL: Hunger and humility: It’s time USA, Klinsmann go back to the basics\nLast week, FIFA announced it was suspending Blatter and Platini for 90 days each and Chung for six years as a result of ongoing investigations into their professional conduct by the ethics committee. FIFA’s executive committee then scheduled a meeting for Oct. 20, at which it could decide to postpone the election in the wake of the recent turbulence.\nBlatter and Platini are appealing their bans, and delaying the election could benefit Platini if he is cleared of wrongdoing before the election date.\nAli, a former FIFA vice president, said the committee “should not interfere with an ongoing process that was put in place by the ad hoc electoral committee.”\n“The election date of February 26 was set three months ago with a clear procedure that meets all of FIFA’s statutory requirements,” he said. “Candidates have had plenty of time to declare and still do. The rules should not be changed after the game has started.”\n• USA falls to Costa Rica 1-0 in Tim Howard's return to goal\n- Erin Flynn\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/soccer/2015/10/14/prince-ali-says-election-delay-would-further-discredit-fifa/73913060/", "http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2015/10/08/fifa-suspends-sepp-blatter-michel-platini-chung-mong-joon", "http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2015/10/12/usa-costa-rica-live-blog-analysis-usmnt-recap", "http://www.si.com/", "http://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2015/10/13/jurgen-klinsmann-struggles-how-to-fix-usa-soccer-usmnt-mexico", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T16:58:49.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
