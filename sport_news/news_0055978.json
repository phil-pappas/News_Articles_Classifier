However, he failed to reciprocate such form which made him lose the Hearts job in the second round of last season. \nHerbert will have another chance with Inter Allies and the Tema side are expected to be a force to reckon with next season under his guidance. \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
