(Joe Robbins/Getty Images) \nThe Washington Redskins face the Philadelphia Eagles on Sunday in a matchup of 1-2 teams slated to kick off at 1 p.m. at FedEx Field, Hurricane Joaquin permitting. Philadelphia opened the season with back-to-back losses to Atlanta and Dallas and then rebounded with a win over the New York Jets last week. \nDespite playing on the road, the Eagles are three-point favorites. \nHere are some key matchups for Sunday’s game: \nWashington LG Spencer Long vs. Philadelphia DE Fletcher Cox \nShawn Lauvao’s strong start to the season came to an end last week when he tore ligaments in his ankle against the Giants and then wound up on injured reserve. Second-year pro Spencer Long is expected to slide into Lauvao’s spot at left guard, and he will receive a tough test right off the bat as he faces Cox, one of the better defensive linemen in the league. Long has focused on improving his start off the line, both with his first step and with quick hands. Long must stay disciplined and can’t become disoriented by the stunts the Eagles like to run. Lauvao proved instrumental on some of Washington’s biggest runs of the season as he served as a pulling guard. Long must prove he too can be effective on the move as well as in tight quarters, and in pass protection. \nWashington ILB Keenan Robinson vs. Philadelphia RB Darren Sproles \nThe Eagles lost a key weapon in LeSean McCoy, but Sproles returns as a key weapon. Sproles isn’t the feature back, but he still “makes that offense go” because of the variety of ways that the Eagles use him. Sproles’ speed and shiftiness make it hard for defenders to get their hands on him, and his small stature gives him a low center of gravity, which makes it hard to bring him down. Robinson leads Washington with an average of eight tackles. He and his teammates must swarm to Sproles and attempt to keep his gains to a minimum. \nWashington RB Alfred Morris vs. Philadelphia SS Malcolm Jenkins \nJay Gruden insists Morris is still the lead back despite the fact that Matt Jones has received the bulk of the carries the past two games. Morris is coming off of a six-carry, 19-yard outing against the Giants and has to get more opportunities and also produce more. A big day from Morris will go a long way to ensuring the Redskins stick to their proven recipe for success. However, Morris found it hard to muster much production last week against the Giants and their then-third-ranked rushing attack. This week, the challenge only intensifies. Jenkins leads a Philly defense that ranks first in the NFL, limiting foes to 3.1 yards per carry. \nWashington CB Bashaud Breeland vs. Philadelphia WR Jordan Matthews \nBreeland, who had a rough outing against the Giants, said he has flushed that game from his memory and is eager for the challenge at hand. More pressure rests on his shoulders this week with the cornerback unit decimated by injuries. Chris Culliver hasn’t practiced the last two days, and his status is in doubt because of a left leg injury. Matthews is Sam Bradford’s favorite target, entering the game with 22 catches for 231 yards and a touchdown. He also boasts a team-high 11 receptions for first downs. Matthews had a productive day in his first game against Washington last season with eight catches for 59 yards and two touchdowns. \nWashington QB Kirk Cousins vs. Philadelphia FS Walter Thurmond III \nBadly in need of a bounce-back game following last week’s two-interception performance against the Giants, Kirk Cousins must do a good job of taking care of the football on what likely will be a nasty day. He’s not going up against the strongest passing defense. The Eagles rank 22nd in the NFL, surrendering 282 passing yards a game. However, the Eagles don’t surrender big plays. They have held opponents to an average of 6.7 yards per attempt, which ranks 10 th . Thurmond leads the secondary with a pair of interceptions, a total that is tied for first in the NFL. \nWashington DE Stephen Paea vs. Philadelphia RG Matt Tobin \nLike the Redskins, the Eagles are dealing with injuries along the offensive line. Third-year pro Matt Tobin slides into the starting lineup with Andre Gardner injured. This could prove to be a favorable matchup for Paea, who has a sack and forced fumble, but still hasn’t had the type of consistent impact that he wants and his team needs. The Redskins have to get more disruption from their front four. They should have success Sunday. The Eagles haven’t had much success running the ball, averaging just 2.7 yards per carry, and 64.3 rushing yards a game. \nMore from The Post :", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T20:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T20:42:53.380+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
