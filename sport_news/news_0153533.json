Martens, 76, was sleeping in suddenly pulled away from the wall and struck her in the head and upper torso, according to a lawsuit filed this week in Jackson County Circuit Court.\n\"(T)he frame and mattress assembly locked in the closed position, trapping (Martens) inside and causing her death,\" states the suit.\nMurphy beds, also known as wall beds, can be lifted to be stored vertically with a wall to save space. Deaths associated with them are not unheard of.\nIn 2005, two sisters, ages 62 and 68, died when the wall unit of side-by-side Murphy beds fell onto them while they vacationed in Spain. In 2012, a 33-year-old New York man died when a bed he was installing suddenly snapped up on him, crushing his skull and severing his spine.\nThis week's lawsuit lists Westcott Designs of California as a defendant, claiming it is at fault for the bed's poor design. The suit also lists Beds For Less as a defendant, claiming it is liable for improperly installing the bed in Martens' home. The suit states that the bed frame was fastened to drywall, not wall studs.\nNeither company returned requests seeking comment Wednesday.\nMartens' family seeks $7,500 for memorial expenses, and $850,000 for loss of society, companionship and services.\nMartens' obituary in the Medford Mail Tribune described her as a \"pianist, harpist, singer ... (w)riter, speaker, teacher, spiritual consultant and minister.\nPortland attorney Michael Gutzler and Ashland attorney Jeffrey McCollum are representing the estate.\nRead the lawsuit here.\n-- Aimee Green\nagreen@oregonian.com\n503-294-5119\no_aimee", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/o_aimee"], "published": "2015-10-08T13:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T17:47:38.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
