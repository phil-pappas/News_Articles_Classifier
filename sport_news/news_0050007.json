Even the slightest thing might be helpful. If you have land, go out there and take a perimeter walk. If you know someone who might know something, let us know. If you have any thoughts or ideas or suggestions, just call.\" \nThe State Police took over the investigation into Craig's disappearance 18 months after he last was seen, and until she retired this past summer, major crimes investigator Gloria Coppola worked the case. It was, she says, one of the hardest for her to turn over to a new investigator, in part because she believes the answer always has been so close. She doesn't think Craig got far on the day of his disappearance. \nCraig was last seen at his girlfriend's apartment in Cambridge Manor on June 27, 2004. His mother and father had been trying to track him down that day, because they wanted to know why he'd quit his job at Price Chopper. (To this day, the police and his family remain unsure why.) \nWhen Craig left the apartment sometime early in the afternoon, he appeared to be sneaking around the building. Two children playing nearby waved to him, then saw him walk into the woods. No one knows where Craig was headed. \nPolice have believed some kind of harm — foul play, an accident, suicide — came to Craig soon thereafter. That's why Coppola asks those who own land anywhere from Glenville to Pattersonville to search their property. \n\"We need the public's help,\" she says. \"I really believe that's how we're going to break this case.\" \nThere are roughly 100,000 active missing persons cases in the United States, according to the National Institute of Justice . Some offer a clear line of investigation — the child taken in a custody dispute, or the teenager who runs away. Other disappearances, like Craig's, can seem as though the person simply vanished. \n\"Something happened to my son,\" Veronica said. \"He didn't just fall off the face of the earth. Aliens didn't come and take him. Something happened, and somebody might know what. That's why we have to keep looking.\" \nThough she understands the evidence — Craig's social security number never has been used, and he had no money — suggests her son didn't leave town and start a new life, Veronica can't bring herself to say she agrees with the police theory. She's traveled as far as California to search when sightings have been reported. \nShe also now helps the police train new officers in how to deal with families who are missing loved ones. She wants everyone to understand that even as leads dry up, the missing don't simply fade from their loved ones' lives, even if they do from public consciousness. They remain more than just a photo on a poster, or by the dinner table. \n\"My family and I miss Craig every single day,\" his mother says. \"And we will never, ever stop looking for him.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T15:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:36:17.508+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
