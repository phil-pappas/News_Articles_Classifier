((Jim Middlekauff | lehighvalleylive.com contributor)) \nNazareth almost reverted back to 2014 in football on Friday. \nThe Blue Eagles didn’t look like this fall’s high-flying Eastern Pennsylvania Conference South Division contender against struggling Northampton. \nInstead, the 19-13 win over the 1-4 Konkrete Kids, not secured by Nazareth (4-1, 3-1 EPC South) until the final minute, reminded players such as junior quarterback Travis Stefanik too much of 2014’s 2-8 team. \n“Last year we got blown out in almost every game,” Stefanik said. “This year is definitely much more fun. We’re not used to winning games like we are.” \nAnd this year’s team isn’t used to struggling to win; its only loss is to unbeaten Freedom and it owns wins over Stroudsburg and Liberty. \n“This team has been finding ways to win,” Nazareth coach Tom Falzone said. “They grind it out every week in these back-and-forth games. Every week’s been close and I don’t think we have a comfortable lead yet. But I have to give the kids credit, they keep finding a way to get a win.” \nStefanik said he thinks last week’s disappointing effort was a one-off for the Blue Eagles as they prepare to take on Central Catholic (3-2, 3-1) in an EPC South game Saturday afternoon (2:30 p.m.) at J. Birney Crum Stadium in Allentown. \n“We didn’t have a good week of practice last week,” Stefanik said. “We came out a lot stronger in this week. We learned a real lesson last week dodging a bullet – we can’t take anybody lightly. That’s what we did last wrong. All of these teams are good.” \nCertainly the Vikings, who own an upset win over Easton, are just that. \n“I honestly thought Central would be a good team before the season,” Stefanik said. “I thought they’d have a tough time with Easton but we went to the game and we could see right away Central was a good team. Their line was tough and I didn’t think their defense would stay with Easton like it did.” \nOf course, not many people thought Nazareth would be 4-1 with a win over Liberty either. Even the Blue Eagles may be a bit surprised at how far they have come. \n“Yes and no,” Stefanik said, “I thought we’d come in with the same high-powered offense we had last season, but then when we played Freedom and Liberty we realized we could play with those top-tier teams. You start to get a feeling when you play well, even when nobody is believing in you, that you can do whatever you need to do to help the team win. With us that’s been the case every week.” \nFew players have done more to help their team win games than Stefanik, who has passed for 1,228 yards and 14 touchdowns with a 66.1 completion percentage, and ran for 449 yards (5.8 yards per carry) and five more touchdowns. \n“I have the best receivers in then league (such as Jahan Dotson , Julian Liaci , Jared Henn , and Tim Hutchison ) and they make me look really good; I am lucky to have them,” said Stefanik, who was a state-qualifying wrestler for Nazareth last winter and came up one win shy of a state medal. “And the line has given me really good blocking and allows me to exploit the matchups we have and get the ball to where we can have success.” \nAfter 2014’s debacle, Stefanik said he worked in three specific areas to get better. \n“I threw some interceptions last year and I wanted to limit those a lot (he has three this season), but I still make mistakes,” Stefanik said. “I want to get better on my fakes to my running backs and I wanted to be more of a leader. Quarterbacks always have to be leaders and I try and lead by example, If I make a bad mistake I keep my head held high and wait for the next play to make up for it.” \nOr, in this case of a whole bad game like Northampton, Stefanik and the Blue Eagles have had to wait a whole week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T17:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T02:11:20.322+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
