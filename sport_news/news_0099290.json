Maybe I had not too much energy. I didn’t push a lot like I always do.” \nPennetta only found out last week that she qualified for her first singles appearance at the WTA Finals. She played two tournaments after the U.S. Open — Beijing and Moscow — in her quest to make it to Singapore. \n“The road to Singapore was pretty hard in the last month, but I’m really enjoying … this event,” Pennetta said. “I would love to play a little bit better, but I still have my chance.” \nMaria Sharapova beat Agnieszka Radwanska 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in a nearly three-hour opening round-robin match later on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T23:23:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:38:09.507+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
