Cincinnati Bengals offensive coordinator Hue Jackson credits how Andy Dalton was booed at a charity softball game in the city where he plays as something that has motivated the quarterback to silence all the naysayers.\nAdChoices The embarrassing reception from the local fans clearly demonstrated their antipathy for the Bengals franchise quarterback occurred at the celebrity softball game ahead of the 2015 All-Star Game at Cincinnati’s Great American Ball Park. While no local sports personality probably is deserving of such treatment, Dalton hasn’t proven himself capable of taking the team to the next step, looking at times horrible while going 0-4 in the postseason.\n“I truly believe that was a turning point for Andy,” Jackson said, via MMQB . “I’m not going to tell you it didn’t bother him. It did. When you have the success he has had — four seasons in the league, four times in the playoffs — getting booed in your own city, that has to hurt a bit. But he was able to hit one over the fence for a home run. And he flipped the bat. His message was sort of, ‘You might not like me now, but you’re going to love me later.’”\nJackson added that Dalton, through it all, has remained focused upon improving.\n“There are things about him that people do not see,” he said. “They say he doesn’t have passion. They say he doesn’t have the work ethic. All totally untrue. He has the burning desire to be the best. I see it every day. I’ve really seen it this week.”\nDalton is off to a phenomenal start this season — garnering early MVP consideration — leading the Bengals to a 4-0 record while completing 67.2 percent of his passes while throwing nine touchdowns and only one interception. The fifth-year quarterback showing flashes of brilliance during the regular season of course is nothing new, so it will be up to him to actually lead the team to a win in the postseason, should the Bengals continue their solid play and reach the playoff promised land for the fifth straight season.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://mmqb.si.com/mmqb/2015/10/08/hue-jackson-cincinnati-bengals-nfl-offense-andy-dalton", "http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nfl-shutdown-corner/bengals-oc--andy-dalton-s-turning-point-was-getting-booed-at-softball-game-182608481.html", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T03:28:47.211+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
