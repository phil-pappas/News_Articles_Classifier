The findings were released in the Oct. 13 edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nScientists say without severe cuts to carbon emissions, the sea level could increase at least 14 feet. That would affect about 20 million people who live along the coast.\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
