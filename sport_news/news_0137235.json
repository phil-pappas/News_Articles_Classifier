Historic? Bears-Packers, of course. For pure ferocity, Pro Picks will take Ravens-Steelers. There's a caveat with Thursday night's meeting, though: no Big Ben. Roethlisberger's absence has a huge impact on the point spread. Although the Ravens (tied for No. 22 in AP Pro32) are 0-3 and the Steelers (tied for No. 9) are 2-1, Baltimore is favored by 2 1-2 points. Guess the oddsmakers figure Baltimore is as desperate as a team could be after three tight defeats, and that Michael Vick can't provide the spark Pittsburgh's offense will need. Vick believes otherwise. \"I feel like I have a chance to go out and play freely and enjoy the game, enjoy this moment and be out there with my teammates,\" Vick said. The Ravens haven't lost their faith despite their fruitless start to the season. \"Win one game and we're 1-3. Big deal, we're 1-3,\" quarterback Joe Flacco said. \"So, I think that the biggest thing for us is going to be to keep our attitude right. Because if we don't do that, then we're going to have no chance. If we do it, man, the fact that we're 0-3 right now doesn't mean anything.\" Pro Picks agrees, somewhat. Expect it to be close.
