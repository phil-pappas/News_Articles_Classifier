We both played good tennis.\n\"I was really aggressive. I served really, really well today. I moved well. I'm just really happy to win today. It come at the good moment. It's good to play like this.\"\n(Reporting by Sudipto Ganguly in Mumbai; editing by xx)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T15:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T15:32:05.648+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
