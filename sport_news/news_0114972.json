You look at the managers available now, it's a merry-go-round. \n\"In the 30 years I've been involved in football it's been the same people getting job after job, so why are young managers doing all their coaching badges but not getting that opportunity?\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:16:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:22:32.722+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
