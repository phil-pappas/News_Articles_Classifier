Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 7:10 PM Updated Oct 22, 2015 at 7:36 PM Posted Oct. 22, 2015 at 7:10 PM Updated Oct 22, 2015 at 7:36 PM Football recruiting of high school players rarely stays the same. In the distant past, it was a big deal just to get a letter from a university well-known in the sport asking high school coaches for film of a prospect. Often the only way you knew who was after a prospect was the number of times coaches from a various schools came in to watch a young man practice, or if said player told a media outlet directly who was on his list of potential destinations. When a player signed, they would often mention the other schools who made a push for them but generally you didn’t know the day-by-day timeline of that specific recruiting battle. When the internet first came along, specific recruiting sites emerged – many tied directly to a particular school or conference – telling you which way a blue-chip player was leaning. Some weren’t very sophisticated -- I remember one standout linebacker in the 1990s sought by major powers and one web site mentioned along the lines of “the player’s next-door neighbor’s former co-worker said he had heard…” Those days are long gone. Now you can directly to the source. The advent of social media, especially through Twitter or Instagram – not to mention Facebook -- makes it an instantaneous process. Actually, there’s so much information out there now it’s hard to keep up with it all. And any report that a Clemson, Wake Forest, Stanford, LSU or Oklahoma is offering someone nearby gets repeated 100 times. But it's fun to see the latest school offering Crest’s Justin Foster or Shelby’s Dax Hollifield or one of the many talented players Cleveland County will send on to the next level very soon. Also, you can see the players as they travel to specific campuses, as when Crest’s Tre Harbison attended a Duke/Virginia game on a visit to Charlottesville, Va., during his recruiting process. Athletes and families let their friends in on the news immediately and traditional media is forced to pay attention. Our local folks are embracing the recruiting revolution. Shelby Football tweeted out last week that quarterback Darquez Lee had received an offer from Southern University. And there’s a Crest recruiting handle on Twitter staying abreast of all things related to where Charger players may go, and the college coaches that have passed through the campus checking out possible signees. That’s a far cry from the days when it was all played so close to the vest. Technology at the fingertips of teenage athletes, their families, coaching staffs, media, fans and recruiters has altered the process for good. We’re all going to ride the wave to see where it takes us … and you can bet 5-to-10 years down the road recruiting could even have another major makeover.
