After that, the Bears were the ones who cooked up an appetite for the end zone, scoring 28 unanswered points. The outburst helped PV run away with a 50-20 Eastern Pennsylvania Conference victory over the Cavaliers. \n“Our defense came out and I told them, ‘You got to overcome adversity,’ and that’s what they did,” Pleasant Valley Dave Pacchioni said. “They faced adversity in the first drive. We had plenty of chances to get them off the field and we didn’t. Next week, we get off the field. But offensively, they picked us up. “When you have Austyn Borre and Trent Thomas running the ball, it’s a great thing to have in the backfield, especially with these coordinators. I don’t know how I would match-up with these guys. ‘So, who do you cover?’ It gives them match-up problems.” \nThe Bears’ coaching staff mixed up the right ingredients for success after the Cavaliers’ early score. \nDanny Hunter started the scoring off for PV with a 29-yard touchdown reception from Mikey Brown and then Mike Mitchell scampered for a 59 yard touchdown run as time expired in the opening quarter. \nIt was the Bears’ double trouble of a backfield, with Borre and Thomas, scoring the next two touchdowns before the Cavaliers got another Changa Hodge touchdown reception right before half. \nIt only took Borre 18-seconds to find pay dirt to open up the second half, which gave the Bears a comfortable 34-14 lead. Borre hit the 100-yard plateau once again with 129 yards on 10 carries, while Thomas chunked out 84 yards on 12 carries. Mitchell was 10 yards shy of the century mark with four carries for 90 yards. \nDean Krcic stole the spotlight on the next three Pleasant Valley drives with three straight field goals. \nWith the win, the Bears move to an even 3-3 on the season and extended their win streak to three games. \n“We preach every week, ‘It’s step by step, week by week,” Pacchioni said. “You can’t look ahead. Dieruff is our next opponent. So, we’re looking forward to the challenge of being home next week with our PV Blue Crew and getting after it.” \nFLAG HAPPY ... ES South finished with 14 penalties for 105 yards while PV ended up with seven for 46 yards. The worse part was a string of seven straight penalties late in the opening quarter. \nGET A KICK OUT OF IT ... Krcic contributed to the Bears’ victory with his right foot. On nine kickoff attempts, the senior recorded six touchbacks. In the second half, when the Bears couldn’t finish drives, Krcic was the one putting points on the board by nailing three field goals, covering 28, 29 and 36 yards. \nSINGLED OUT ... ES South’s quarterback Jacob Cirillo accounted for the majority of his team’s offense. He recorded 64 percent of ES South’s 181 rushing yard (115) and 85 percent of the host’s 444 yards total offense (378).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:43:45.499+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
