Upon further glance into the rearview mirror, some may recall the Washington Bullets were the first NBA team to play a Global Games contest in China in Aug. 1979, according to NBA.com’s Global Games webpage. The Bullets’ second of those two exhibition games was against a Shanghai team that featured none other than Yao Zhiyuan — Ming’s father. The league has a long, consistent history of playing overseas, but while the Bullets played those two games in 1979, the NBA Global Games didn’t return to China until Ming’s Rockets and the Kings made the trek 11 years ago. Recently, NBA teams have ventured to China every year since 2007, except for 2011 when the lockout lasted into that regular season. On Wednesday, the Charlotte Hornets begin their approximately 18-hour trip to China to continue the modern tradition — an eight-day tour that includes two games against the L.A. Clippers (who also played in China in 2012), on Oct. 11 in Shenzhen and Oct. 14 in Shanghai, as well as off-court events sandwiched between two long travel days. Charlotte players will be given welcome receptions in both cities, participate in an NBA Cares Reading and Learning Center dedication, hold an open-practice Fan Appreciation Night in Shanghai and make appearances in the communities. One of the team’s newest additions, Jeremy Lin, may be the leader of the pack during the trip. Lin, who was born in Palo Alto, Calif., of Asian descent, is no stranger to the area. “This will be my third time in China in four months,” Lin said. “I’ll definitely be walking through the airports like, ‘Yeah, I’ve definitely seen these terminals.’” Lin, who made a YouTube video in Taiwan this summer disguised as an obnoxious, overweight trainer at a gym — a stunt the Internet savvy star recognized as his favorite prank — said this trip will be slightly different than his previous two. “Most of the time you go back there in the summer, you have promotional things,” he said. “But to actually play games there is going to be sweet.” Other newcomers also said they’re looking forward to the trip. “Any time you have an experience like that where everyone goes away and everyone’s together kind of away from some of the distractions, that can really behoove a team,” said forward/center Spencer Hawes, who was acquired from the Clippers in the Lance Stephenson trade in June. “This is my first time going to China,” said guard Jeremy Lamb, who was brought over in a trade from Oklahoma City in June. “It’ll be cool — get to play a few games over there, work on some things, have a few practices, so I think it’ll be good for us.” That’s a sentiment Hornets coach Steven Clifford shared. “It’s just a chance for them to spend time together away from home,” said Clifford, who also traveled to China with the Rockets and Orlando Magic as an assistant coach. “They’re excited to get the experience.” So, as a team building exercise, Clifford and his players agree on the values. The sport as a whole benefits from these trips as well. “The league, for some time now, has been working hard in all parts of the world,” Clifford said. “The Chinese people love basketball. From that standpoint, the games are well attended and there’s a lot of enthusiasm in the crowd. “It’s another chance where our players get to go and showcase their talents.” Members of the team have taken to Twitter to build buzz around the trip. Forward Michael Kidd-Gilchrist tweeted, “Extremely excited about heading to China #2015NBAglobalgames #HornetsChina.” And forward/center Cody Zeller tweeted, “Anyone speak Chinese? #NBAGlobalGames.” The Hornets fly home after their Oct. 14 game and return to Charlotte on Oct. 15 to continue the preseason. Their first regular-season game is Oct. 28 at Miami. MORE ON THE NBA GLOBAL GAMES — The first and only trip the Charlotte franchise took overseas as part of the league’s Global Games was way back in 1994. The Hornets played preseason games in Paris, France, where they lost to Chris Mullen and the Warriors, and Bologna, Italy, where they beat Buckler Bologna as Robert Parish and Muggsy Bogues combined for 49 points. — Heading into this season, there have been 154 contests played in the 36-year history of the NBA Global Games, according to NBA.com . — First to kick of this season’s Global Games play is the Boston Celtics, who pay Olimpia Milano in Milan, Italy, today, then Real Madrid in Madrid, Spain, on Thursday. — Hornets majority owner Michael Jordan has a lengthy, storied history in international basketball, but his NBA Global Games debut didn’t come until 1997. His Chicago Bulls, without Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman, snuck by PSG Racing, 89-82, before beating Olympiakos, 104-78, for the McDonalds Championship title. Jordan had 55 points between the two games. KIDD-GILCHRIST HAS TORN LABRUM Kidd-Gilchrist injured his shoulder during the Hornets’ preseason game Saturday. The team’s public relations Twitter account posted an injury update for Kidd-Gilchrist on Monday that read: “... Kidd-Gilchrist underwent an MRI today that revealed a torn labrum in his right shoulder,” and continued, “MKG will meet with team orthopedist Dr. Marcus Cook (today) to determine next steps for recovery & rehabilitation.” Yahoo Sports NBA insider Adrian Wojnarowski tweeted, “Charlotte’s Michael Kidd-Gilchrist will need shoulder surgery and be sidelined six months, league source tells Yahoo Sports,” regarding injury. Wojnarowski later reported Kidd-Gilchrist will “likely miss the entire season.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:08:43.930+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
