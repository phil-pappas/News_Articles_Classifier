(Photo: Michael Zamora/The Register) \nChris McLeod felt like he had something to prove to Southeast Polk football coach Brad Zelenovich. \nThe rest of his Ankeny teammates did, too. \nThe sixth-ranked Hawks captured their second consecutive Class 4A District 1 title with a dominating 30-10 victory at Southeast Polk on Friday. The win came against Zelenovich, who guided Ankeny to last year’s crown before returning to Pleasant Hill to take over the Rams’ program, where he previously served as an assistant. \n“It feels amazing, especially knowing that coach Z left,” said McLeod, who ran for a touchdown and accounted for 159 total yards. “We came out and showed him what we had. The offense did their thing, and the defense came out and stopped them. It’s just a great feeling.” \nNate Champagne ran for two touchdowns and Taylor Parrish kicked three field goals as Ankeny (8-1) rolled to its seventh consecutive victory. The loss ended a five-game winning streak for the Rams (5-4). \n“We all wanted this win bad after coach Z left us like that,” Parrish said. “It sort of gave us an extra push.” \nAnkeny racked up 396 yards of total offense while limiting the Rams to just 205. Zelenovich said his team was simply outplayed. \n“It was a tough one because they’re good,” Zelenovich said of the Hawks. “They did a great job; they’re well-coached and they got after us and beat us in all three phases of the game. They deserved to win.” \nSoutheast Polk grabbed the early momentum when Gunner Jorgensen picked up a fumble by McLeod and returned it 97 yards for a touchdown with 1 minute left in the first quarter. Jorgensen also had an interception to stop the Hawks’ opening drive of the game. \n“We just had to get it back,” McLeod said. “I couldn’t let it get me down.” \nAnkeny needed just one play to tie the score. Champagne took a handoff to the left side, cut upfield and raced 82 yards to the end zone. Take Five: Frantic Friday shapes Iowa playoff field \nMcLeod atoned for his fumble when he made a nice move at the line of scrimmage to avoid a tackler, then dashed 11 yards for the go-ahead touchdown midway through the second quarter. It capped a nine-play, 61-yard drive by the Hawks, who outgained Southeast Polk by a 248-106 margin in the first half. \nMcLeod caught a 28-yard pass from Blaine Hawkins on Ankeny’s next possession, then recovered a fumble by Hawkins on the ensuing play to keep the drive alive. Parrish eventually kicked a 35-yard field goal with 3 minutes left to give Ankeny a 17-7 lead at the half. \nThe Rams’ six first-half possessions resulted in four punts, an interception and a turnover on downs. \n“We had a good game plan,” said Ankeny defensive end Jack Buttjer. “They’re a great team. We just played well, and we got the win.” \nMcLeod took over at quarterback late in the game after Hawkins suffered a broken collarbone in the third quarter. Hawkins completed all five of his passes for 70 yards in the second half before leaving with the injury. \n“I felt really good until I walked out with my injured quarterback,” said Ankeny coach Rick Nelson. “He’s a real special kid, but we’ll figure things out. I’m just so proud of these kids. We’ve just gotten better and better and better, and I think tonight it showed.” \n**** \nIndividual Leaders \nRushing— Ankeny: Champagne 10-96, McLeod 19-90, Hawkins 12-62, Quigley 1-11; SEP: Hauser 16-59, McLaughlin 5-30, Cole 2-6. \nPassing— Ankeny: Hawkins 8-11-1 131; SEP: McLaughlin 13-33-1 110. \nReceiving— Ankeny: McLeod 3-69, Hill 3-43, Faeth 2-19; SEP: Hauser 6-30, Cole 3-27, Jennings 2-12, Gulick 1-35. 3 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/1S1QtSH TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T11:55:11.203+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
