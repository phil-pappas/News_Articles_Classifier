The 26-year-old Fenninger was transported by helicopter to a clinic in nearby Innsbruck after the incident. \n\"Anna has seriously damaged ligaments in the right knee, which requires surgery,\" Austrian team doctor Christian Hoser said. \"She's got a tear of the medial collateral and of the cruciate ligament. Also, she has torn the patellar tendon in the right knee, which also needs surgery.\" \nIt was not immediately clear how long Fenninger will be sidelined for, but athletes often need more than six months to recover from torn knee ligaments. \n\"It's a tough injury,\" Fenninger's personal coach, Meinhard Tatschl, told the Austria Press Agency. \"We'll have to wait until after the operation to make a prognosis.\" \nTatschl said the crash initially looked harmless. \n\"It was a normal training run, the course was perfect, not bumpy,\" the coach said. \"It was an unlucky crash, nothing unusual. This kind of crashes happens all the time. She slipped away on the inner ski. Her knee hurt a bit ... but only later the pain increased.\" \nFenninger, who is the GS world champion, won the season-opening giant slalom last year, sharing victory with Mikaela Shiffrin of the United States. She went on the win her second straight overall title, coming from behind to beat closest rival Tina Maze of Slovenia. Maze has taken a break from racing and won't compete this season. \nThe injury comes after a turbulent off-season preparation time for Fenninger, who struggled with another knee injury and off-piste troubles. \nThe patella, which connects knee cap and tibia, has been causing her problems for years. The pain forced her to quit a practice session as a precautionary measure last month. She missed several weeks of training on snow but said last week on Austrian TV she was ready to race the season-opener. \nFenninger's preparations were also disturbed as she quarreled for months with the Austrian ski federation about her manager, Klaus Kaercher, and about her wish to have one of the team physicians working exclusively for her. Fenninger quit a national training camp in Cyprus in May, and even threatened to leave the federation. \nThe conflict erupted when Fenninger appeared in an advertising campaign for Mercedes, a rival brand of one of the governing body's main sponsors, Audi. \nMercedes later retracted the campaign and Fenninger parted ways with her manager. \nFenninger, who is the Olympic super-G champion, has won four gold medals and eight in total at Olympics and world championships. She has won 14 World Cup races. \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T17:15:15.334+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
