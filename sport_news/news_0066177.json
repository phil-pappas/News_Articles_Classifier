Meanwhile, Mali and Nigeria are through. \nThe young Syli Nationale managed just one point from their opening draw with England, before losses to Korea Republic and Brazil. \nIt was a comfortable win for the South Americans who took the lead from the spot in the 15th minute after Guinea goalkeeper fouled striker Leandro in the box and midfielder Lincoln converted. Both players switched roles to double Brazil's advantage on 33 minutes, with Lincoln finding Leandro with a free kick and the later heading home. \nGuinea had a chance to take charge of the game after Lincoln was sent off before the break and stepped things up at the restart, but it was the Brazilians that scored again, with striker Arthur slotting into an empty net after a defensive mistake by Moussa Soumah on 67 minutes. \nMorlaye Sylla scored a fine consolation goal for Guinea from the edge of the box, but it was too late to rescue their campaign. \nGREEN AGENDAMeanwhile, after two wins on the bounce and securing a place in the Round of 16, holders Nigeria suffered their first loss of the tournament, going down 2-1 to Croatia. \nNigeria coach Emmanuel Amuneke fielded his strongest squad in a bid to tame the Europeans who beat the Golden Eaglets at a friendly pre-tournament tourney in Korea Republic, but it was the Croats that deservedly came out on top despite having to come from behind. \nMoments after being denied by the posts, Victor Osimhen moved clear as the tournament's current top scorer with four goals when he rounded the goalkeeper to put Nigeria ahead in the 20th minute. \nNeeding a win to ensure progress, the Croats had looked the better side for much of the opening half, but they had to wait until the 50th minute to find their equaliser when Josip Brekalo scored at the back post. \nKarlo Majic made it 2-1 four minutes later, curling superbly beyond Akpan Udoh in the Nigeria goal. \nThe Golden Eaglets will play the third-placed finishers from Groups C, D or E next Wednesday for a place in the quarter-finals. \nSTORMY MALIAfrican champions Mali became the second team from the continent through to the Round of 16 after defeating Honduras 3-0 at the Estadio Nelson Oyarzun Arenas on Saturday. \nGoals from Amadou Haidara, captain Abdoul Dante and Aly Malle ensure the Eaglets march on as the winners of Group D, and join Nigeria in the next round. \nMali boss Baye Ba (above, pictured) was left delighted with his side's win and revealed that they were keen to emulate their compatriots who finished third at the U-20 World Cup earlier in the year. \n\"I'm very happy with the result. My team dominated during the game and I'm very satisfied with the attitude and effort of my players. This is a long journey that began a while ago in the African qualifying and now we have finished in the first position in our group,\" Baye said after the game. \nHe added: \"Mali finished in third position in U-20 (World Cup) finals that took place some months ago in New Zealand and this is our goal too: be in the four best teams of this tournament.\" \nMali will now face the third-placed team from Groups B, E or F for a place in the quarter-finals. \nAMAJIMBO FATEThe last of the African teams have their fates to be determined from 10pm Ghana time on Sunday. South Africa, with one point in Group E, face group leaders Russia. The Amajimbo must win to have any chance of advancing. \nQuotes, photos from Fifa, Premium Times, Safa, and AP.
