Since Gang Green’s shocking upset of New England in the 2010 AFC divisional playoffs, the Patriots have won seven of eight games in this series. Of course, all of that occurred under previous coach Rex Ryan. First-year coach Todd Bowles’ club can claim a share of first place today and get a leg up on a possible tiebreaker advantage against the perennial AFC East powerhouse. \nPatriots: New England coach Bill Belichick likely has more of a kinship with fellow Bill Parcells coaching-tree product Bowles than he did with the bombastic Ryan, but Belichick enjoys defeating the Jets no matter who is on the opposing sideline. More importantly, his team can take a two-game lead on its closest AFC East pursuer before the calendar turns to November. \nKey matchup \nJets WR Brandon Marshall vs. Patriots CB Malcolm Butler. Marshall took advantage a week ago of a depleted Washington secondary with seven receptions for 111 yards, including an incredible 35-yard TD catch on which he adjusted to grab an underthrown Ryan Fitzpatrick pass that seemed destined to be picked off. Butler, the last-second hero of New England’s Super Bowl win last season, has taken on a bigger role with the departures of CBs Darrelle Revis and Brandon Browner via free agency. Marshall said Friday that he was \"shocked\" at how good Butler was when he faced him briefly during garbage time in the Pats’ blowout win over Chicago last season. \nHow they’ll win \nJets: Fitzpatrick (nine TD passes, seven interceptions) hasn’t put up the gaudy numbers of counterpart Tom Brady, but he has been an efficient game manager. He’ll need to do that again as the Jets likely will run Chris Ivory often against a New England defense that has surrendered 4.9 yards per carry this season. The defense doesn’t necessarily need to sack Brady, but must pressure him just enough to make him uncomfortable in the pocket and disrupt his usually impeccable timing with his talented receiving corps. \nPatriots: Brady seems to have been rejuvenated by the tumultuous off-season he endured because of his alleged involvement in Deflategate, and it helps that his receivers are playing at a high level, too. TE Rob Gronkowski (five) and WR Julian Edelman have totaled nine TD catches. Brandon LaFell, who had been sidelined with a foot injury, has also been added to the mix. The Pats’ defense has 19 sacks but may have trouble getting to Fitzpatrick, who has been trapped for a loss while trying to pass only twice this season. \n— J.P.
