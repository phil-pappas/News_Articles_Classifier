The Silver Streaks made a goal-line stand, recovered a fumble, blocked a punt, intercepted a pass had a 57-yard TD pass erased by a penalty and a one-yard dive for an apparent TD ruled a fumble all in the first half. After all that, Galesburg found itself tied 0-0 at the half before storming back to claim a 21-0 victory over Alleman in a crucial Western Big 6 Conference game. \"I'm so proud of our guys after the way the game started,\" said GHS coach Tim Dougherty of the Streaks, 3-0 the WB6 and 4-2 overall. \"We were in two different lockerrooms and had to overcome the officials. \"We showed great resiliency, didn't flinch and shut them out.\" Again displaying an impressive defensive performance, the Streaks posted their second straight shutout. It took a 9-yard touchdown pass from Jacob Ross to Nick Miyler - the first of three Miyler TDs - with 5:39 left in the third quarter to put Galesburg ahead 6-0. The Ross-Miyler combo connected for a 57-yard TD at the 6:52 mark of the four quarter - the exact distance a first-half TD produced by the pair was called back - and Ross's pass to DeAndre Moren for the conversion was good for a 14-0 lead. Essentially that ended the game but Galesburg got a 5-yard TD with 3:42 left and capped the contest with another defensive stand. As Alleman drove to try to ruin the shutout, the Streaks' defense - led by lineman Mike Velazquez - forced a fumble on a fourth-and 1 play by the Pioneers with about a minute to go. Miyler and Fernando Diaz intercepted passes for Galesburg. Caleb Clay blocked his second punt of the season. The game started an hour late due to a pregame power outage reportedly caused by a cut power line a few blocks from the stadium. The Galesburg-Alleman sophomores played in fading daylight with the game called at the end of the third quarter and Alleman ahead 16-7. After the teams dressed at Alleman High School where they had lights, they returned to Augustana which had been vacated in their absence. But overcoming the bizarre beginning, Galesburg improved its first-place hold on the WB6 lead with a home game against Rock Island and a road trip to Quincy remaining.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T08:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T10:12:06.064+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
