But interim coach Clay Helton decided to slow things down against Utah on Saturday, and it worked to the Trojans’ advantage.\nUSC possessed the ball for a season-high 34 minutes, 50 seconds in its 42-24 victory over Utah, which came into the game undefeated and ranked third in the AP Top 25. That total included more than 20 minutes of possession in the second half, when the Trojans expertly protected a double-digit lead.\n“When you get a little bit ahead, obviously time management becomes an issue,” Helton said Sunday. “There were some deliberate attempts to be able to slow the game down.”\nHelton had an ulterior motive for applying the brakes to USC’s normally up-tempo offense: The Trojans were operating behind a makeshift, injury-riddled offensive line that had to change during the course of the game.\nOnly twice this season has USC possessed the ball more than its opponent – the past two games under Helton. Likewise, those are the only two games in which the Trojans have run more plays than the other team.\nLOBENDAHN OUT FOR SEASON \nFor the second time in three games, USC lost its starting center to a season-ending knee injury.\nSophomore Toa Lobendahn (La Habra High) suffered a torn ACL in his left knee in the first half against Utah. Two games earlier against Washington, senior Max Tuerk (Santa Margarita) suffered a torn ACL.\nRedshirt sophomore Khaliel Rodgers filled in admirably for Lobendahn; Helton dubbed Rodgers “the second-biggest star of the game” for the way he came in and handled a difficult assignment.\nRodgers, who started three games last season at left guard, will be the starting center moving forward, beginning with this Saturday’s game at Cal (noon, Fox/11).\nOffensive line coach Bob Connelly will train redshirt sophomore Nico Falah and freshman Cole Smith (Mission Viejo) to be Rodgers’ backups. Falah has practiced at several positions, including center. Smith has yet to play in a game and in an ideal world will redshirt.\nFLIPPING IT AROUND \nUSC won the coin toss Saturday for the sixth time in seven games. But for the first time this year, the Trojans elected to defer.\nThe switch was the brainchild of senior quarterback and team captain Cody Kessler, who told Helton: “Coach, let’s make a statement with our defense. Let’s go out and get a stop.”\nHelton agreed with the call and put the defense out on the field first. USC allowed two first downs before forcing Utah to punt. The Trojans scored on their first possession to take a 7-0 lead.\nHelton credited the defense for winning USC the game. Aside from freshman linebacker Cameron Smith’s three interceptions – including one he returned for a touchdown – the defense generally played its soundest, most consistent game. Helton said the defensive front had only one busted assignment after making several errors the previous week against Notre Dame.\n“We had 11 guys playing on the field and just doing their jobs, and doing it at a high level,” Helton said. “The kids really bought into, I’m going to do my job, do my assignment and trust my brothers.”\nQUICK HITS \nTight end Taylor McNamara has a dislocated shoulder. An MRI revealed no tears. He will be held out of contact this week, and his availability will be determined as the week goes on. … Freshman tight end Tyler Petite has a bruised foot, but tests showed no break. His availability will be based on pain tolerance. … Freshman safety Marvell Tell III has a broken right clavicle. He will be out a minimum of six weeks. … An MRI came back clean on defensive end Rasheem Green’s knee. His availability also will be based on pain tolerance. … Helton said Adoree’ Jackson’s role will be a game-to-game decision. He is expected to play more on defense against Cal, which has a strong quarterback in Jared Goff and a deep receiving corps. … Asked how USC has managed to lose three games, Helton said: “Last night we played our most consistent game. Consistency is the key both on and off the field.”\nContact the writer: mlev@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T08:11:57.022+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
