He not only offered the final tweet in the above sequence, he even has a table: true — Sam HawkBadger (@hwkbgr) October 1, 2015 \nAgain, I don't know where he got that from, and I'm not looking it up. But if he's actually below Mike Glennon and Jay Cutler , then I can't defend that. \nI'm no Luck hater. I think the man is talented, has excellent facial hair game and has had to carry a franchise on his shoulders from Day 1 in the NFL. That's not easy. And yeah, the Colts are sitting at 1-2 at the moment, but he's coming off a season that saw him throw 40 touchdown passes. \nIs he a lock for the Hall of Fame? No, I can't say that yet. But he's been in the playoffs every season. That has to count for something. \nWHO ELSE IS OVERRATED? \nBarry, true @RealSidSaraf @NFLonFOX #FoxMailbag I would have to say the most overrated would be @DeMarcoMurray , all seeing what a great OLINE does. — Barry Croll (@RockNRollCroll) October 1, 2015 \nIs that a tad harsh? Yes, it is. DeMarco Murray ran for 1,845 yards in 2014. And yes, it was behind a great offensive line in Dallas, but Murray was spectacular in open space and always seemed to make the first man miss. \nHe had a lot to do with his big numbers last season, so don't sell him short. \nThat being said, he's gone from flying high to this in 2015: true \nYou've seen the stat by now, but it bears repeating: DeMarco Murray has 21 carries for 11 yards this season and he missed Week 3 with an injury. Eli Manning has more rushing yards at this point and that's disgraceful. \nI'm not going to call him overrated, because he's been great (when healthy) up until this point in his career. But he -- and the Eagles offense as a whole -- needs to get it together. \nFull disclosure: I have a personal stake in this as Murray is currently on three of my four (way too many) fantasy teams this year. \nBrian,", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T18:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:09:59.282+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
