The 11-year veteran hasn’t missed a game since his 2003 rookie season, a span of 135 consecutive games heading into Sunday's matchup. With Dez Bryant and Tony Romo out with injuries, stopping the 33-year-old will be one of the keys for the Patriots. “Smart guy. He can do everything — pass, block, get open,” strong safety Patrick Chung said. “He’s a smart, savvy guy who can make plays. The goal is to just limit him as much as possible. He’s going to have his plays. He’s a good player, but limit him as much as possible and that should help us out.” This season, through three games, the Patriots have been up-and-down when trying to cover tight ends, allowing 49.3 yards a game against the position. Heath Miller of the Steelers had the most success, in Week One, catching eight of 11 targets for 84 yards. Buffalo's Charles Clay caught three passes for 19 yards and a score. Jacksonville's Clay Harbor caught three passes for 43 yards and a touchdown. Witten has become the top target for Brandon Weeden, the quarterback who has taken over for Romo. Witten leads the team in receptions, targets and receiving yards, and is tied for the team lead with two receiving touchdowns. “He does it all,\" said Patriots coach Bill Belichick. \"They use him really to do everything. I don’t think there are any limitations. I don’t think they’re sitting there saying, ‘Well, we don’t want to run this play with Jason in there.’ He run-blocks, he catches the ball over the middle, he catches the ball in the red area, third down, inside, outside, seams, man coverage, zone coverage, pass protects. I mean, whatever they need him to do, he does it and does a good job of it.” The last time the Patriots faced Witten, the tight end caught four passes for 48 yards and a touchdown. On the score, the Cowboys were on the goal line and ran a play-action fake. The tight end started at the end of the line on the right side but ran across the field where Romo hit him. In that game, the Patriots defended Witten with a mix of linebackers and safeties. They’d have a linebacker — at the time Rob Ninkovich — try and jam the tight end at the line of scrimmage and let a safety pick up the coverage after that. “He just does everything for them,” said Devin McCourty. “I think obviously what stands out is, he’s got great hands. When you’ve got a tight end like that who’s big and (has) quickness in and out of routes that really can catch the ball wherever the quarterback throws it, it’s tough as a defender just because if you don’t get there before the ball gets into his hands, he’s usually catching it. “You see a lot of times guys draped all over and he still makes the catch so he’s definitely a tough matchup. He’s been a tough matchup for years now. So we’ll have our work cut out for us and I think that all starts with knowing where he’s at and knowing on each play how we’re defending him and what we’re doing to try to take him away.” It’s likely that Witten will see a mix of safeties and linebackers from the Patriots. Chung will definitely be in that mix. He’s played against Witten twice — once with the Patriots in 2011 and once with Philadelphia in 2013. The Eagles tried to cover Witten mostly with linebackers, but the results were disastrous as he caught 12 passes from Kyle Orton for 135 yards. With Chung covering Witten, the tight end caught just one of three passes that were thrown to him for 11 yards. When facing a talented tight end such as Witten, Chung said it comes down to technique. “It’s all about you and your technique and being able to play whatever leverage you need to play in, and just go out there and compete,” he said. Chung added it's a battle he's looking forward to. “It’s a challenge,” Chung said. “Got to go out there and accept the challenge and see the best you can do.” By Mark Daniels", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T04:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T04:22:15.293+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
