(AP Photo/Duane Burleson) more > By NOAH TRISTER - Associated Press   \nDETROIT (AP) - After losing on a field goal in the final minutes of overtime, Chicago quarterback Jay Cutler looked back on a handful of plays from earlier that could have swung the outcome in his team’s favor. \nAnd many of them were right near the goal line. \n“We’ve got to get better in the red zone,” he said. \nCutler was intercepted in the end zone in the third quarter, and although he led the Bears on a desperate last-minute drive to force overtime, the Detroit Lions eventually prevailed 37-34 on Sunday when Matt Prater kicked a 27-yard field goal with 2:29 remaining in the extra session. \nChicago (2-4) managed only three touchdowns on eight trips to the red zone. There was also a play the Bears nearly made on defense in their own end zone. Near the end of the first half, with the Lions (1-5) at the Chicago 2-yard line, Matthew Stafford threw over the middle to Golden Tate, who hauled the pass in while crossing the goal line, then had it quickly pried loose by defensive back Kyle Fuller. \nThe ball bounced to Chicago’s Jonathan Anderson, and the initial ruling was an interception, but the play was changed to a touchdown after a replay review. \nDean Blandino, the NFL’s head of officiating, said Tate had demonstrated possession and become a runner. \n“He was upright, so they deemed that he had possession,” Bears coach John Fox said. \nAside from that explanation, Fox had little interest in discussing the officiating or the rules. \n“In this league, you’ve got to overcome everything, every week,” he said. \nThe Bears led by four late in regulation and appeared to have forced the Lions into a fourth-and-goal situation from the 12, but Pernell McPhee was called for roughing the passer, and Stafford eventually found Calvin Johnson for a 6-yard touchdown pass with 21 seconds left. \nDown 34-31, Cutler completed passes of 25 and 24 yards to Alshon Jeffery. Then a pass interference call put the Bears in position to tie it on Robbie Gould’s 29-yard field goal. \n“They kind of manned up Al a little bit,” Cutler said. “It was good to see him out there today. I thought he played his tail off.” \nJeffery, who had been out since Week 1 with a hamstring injury, caught eight passes for 147 yards and a TD. \nChicago went three-and-out on each of its two overtime possessions. Then Stafford found Johnson for a 57-yard pass when Bears rookie Harold Jones Quartey was left trying to cover the star receiver with no help from anyone else in the secondary.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T04:35:36.669+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
