Georgia Bulldogs against the Southern University Jaguars in Athens Saturday September 26, 20015. BRANT SANDERLIN/BSANDERLIN@AJC.COM \nOne of this weekend's biggest college football games takes place in Athens, Ga., Saturday. \nThe slightly down Alabama Crimson Tide visit the undefeated Georgia Bulldogs in what could likely be an instant classic. (The last time Alabama came into town , it wasn't quite so.) \n>> Read more trending stories \nThe pregame chatter includes Georgia running back Nick Chubb's streak of 12 straight games with 100+ yards rushing (tied with former Heisman winner Herschel Walker for the school record) vs. Alabama's streak of not giving up 100 rushing yards to an SEC opponent in 10 straight games, according to SEC Network. \nThere's also big talk about the lack of parking spots available in Athens . \nOne reporter caught up with a Georgia fan, a bulldog named Sugar, before the big showdown to ask some tough questions.
