Blake O’Neill quickly went from being the G.O.A.T. to the scapeGOAT with Michigan fans Saturday night. \nMichigan fans upset over the loss to in-state rivals Michigan State, who were praising their punter Blake O’Neill for a amazing 80-yard-bomb in the first quarter, quickly turned into an angry mob on Twitter telling the student-athlete to kill himself and making death threats. \nAnd we thought the shots at Patrick Towles’ hair were bad… sheesh. \nThe spewing of hate towards O’Neill got so bad that Michigan athletic director condemned fans in a open letter Sunday and calling for a ceasefire on the hate against O’Neill. \n“Today I awake to the shocking reality that our community who care so much about this program would send hurtful, spiteful and vicious comments to one of our students.” \nThings started off well enough for O’Neill… \nThe drama began when Michigan State stunned everyone with a come-from-behind victory over Michigan on the final play of the game Saturday night. Michigan fans were already celebrating in the stands when O’Neill, a senior from Australia, fumbled the ball which landed in the hands of Michigan State’s sophmore defensive back Jalen Watts-Jackson who quickly dashed 38 yards for a touchdown with no time left. \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KpxswFxqxqc \nOpen letter from Michigan AD Jim Hackett: \n\n— Max Cohen (@MaxACohen) October 18, 2015 \nAmong some of the brutal tweets, fans asked O’Neill to drink bleach, return to Australia and leave the state permanently. \n— Michael® (@stilltheman2010) October 18, 2015 \nSome people were quick to defend the punter, including some Michigan State fans: No one complained about the 80 yard punt though. Cowards kick a man while he is down. #BlakeONeill \nMichigan fans just need to hold hands and sing a round of kumbaya. \nArticle written by Ricki Barker Writer of things. Watcher of sports.

O’Neill is responsible and should be held accountable… Priceless October 18, 2015 at 4:13 pm | Permalink \nwish someone could hold you accountable for all of the stupid comments you make.

These type of plays is what makes college football the greatest game, shit happens. The cats have been on both ends of plays such as this, but my favorite is, Stevie gets loose against the tards of stripperville. Now beat it losers.
