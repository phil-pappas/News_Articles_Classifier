What does that mean? You can't talk about Russia like that,\" Juncker told a conference in the southern German town of Passau.\n\"We must, I say frankly, treat Russia properly,\" he said, \"Russia should be treated as an equal.\"\nRussia began a bombing campaign in Syria last week, radically changing the course of the four-and-a-half-year conflict and providing a massive boost to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad.\nMoscow's relations with the West were already at a post-Cold War low after last year's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and its subsequent support of rebels in eastern Ukraine.\nJuncker, while urging a new stance to Moscow, stressed that Russia must also \"make huge advances\", adding that its role in Crimea and east Ukraine was unacceptable.\nEurope and the US have imposed sanctions on Russia as a result of its annexation of Crimea early last year.\nWestern nations have also been highly critical of Russia's military intervention in Syria, accusing Moscow of seeking to prop up the regime of President Bashar al-Assad more than tackling the Islamic State jihadists operating there.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T01:46:32.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
