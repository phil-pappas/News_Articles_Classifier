When it has to defend, let’s just say the unit remains very much a work in progress.\nThat was clear in the season-opening 6-2 loss to the Winnipeg Jets on Thursday night. In the first period in which the Bruins dominated, the Hayes-Spooner-Connolly trio was very much a part of that, spending time on the offense and creating chances. The line fired 15 shots (four on net). It didn’t score, and, yes, that was part of the problem. But it was very much involved in the attack.\nThe line was also on the ice for a pair of goals against, the tough one being the goal that put the Jets up 3-1. The problems were both physical (Spooner failed to defend against goalscorer Drew Stafford and against pinching defenseman Ben Chiarot) and mental (Connolly and defenseman Matt Irwin had a miscommunication in coverage). That goal put the B’s in full chase mode that they would never escape.\n“I think as a whole when we were on the ice, there were some missed assignments. Whether it was on the (defense) or the forwards, I think everyone’s to blame,” Connolly said yesterday. “We’ve got to communicate and sort out our checks a little better. But I think for the most part, those are things that are pretty fixable. We’re not too worried about it. We’ll look at some tape and fix what we need to fix.”\nSpooner didn’t think the line had a bad night overall.\n“I think for the most part, we weren’t stuck in our own end, just on that (Stafford) goal,” said Spooner. “I thought as a line we didn’t play bad. We had some chances to score. We just didn’t really bear down on the chances we had. As a whole I don’t think we were bad in our end, just on that one goal and that one shift where we kind of got caught. That’s going to happen. For us it’s just going to be a matter of sorting it out and going from there.”\nThe 5-foot-10, 184-pound Spooner conceded he can be challenged defending against larger opponents.\n“I’m not a huge guy, so I’m not going to be able to go against a guy who’s 6-5 and knock him around. I think for me, it’s just about being hard on my stick and getting in there and trying to learn some tricks,” said Spooner, then referencing Patrice Bergeron. “He’s got a good stick, he’s smart, he’s efficient, he knows where to be. He gets his body in the right position, which is a huge part of it, too.”\nCoach Claude Julien does have options. He could take David Pastrnak off the David Krejci line, which had its own defensive miscue, and put him with Spooner and bump Connolly up with Krejci. That would reunite Spooner and Pastrnak, who played well together last year. While they had troubles in the defensive zone, Pastrnak and Spooner, with Milan Lucic as the left winger, was one of the more dangerous lines last year when the B’s were pushing for a playoff spot.\nThat could be a thought for another day. However, Julien didn’t dismiss the idea of line changes for tonight’s game against the Canadiens, but it didn’t sound like he was ready to break up the Spooner line just yet.\n“It’s communication and it’s reading off each other here. It’s also about being better in that area,” said Julien. “I think we had a lot of breakdowns that were related to the group as opposed to one individual. We definitely have to get better there and it’s what we talked about today. But you’ve got three guys who haven’t played with each other until training camp and you’ve got to hope that they can get better.\n“We’d like to see them spend more time in the offensive zone because that’s where they obviously excel, so hopefully they’ll get better as we move forward.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T11:43:34.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
