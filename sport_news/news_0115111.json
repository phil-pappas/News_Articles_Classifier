He finished with a staggering 271 yards on just 16 carries. His 94-yard touchdown run late in the first quarter helped propel the Huskies to the 20-0 lead at the break. \nThe Lions were outgained 549-137 in total yardage. \nBryant, a sophomore who has played with poise and sharp command of the offense, was under constant pressure. He completed just 7-of-25 passes for 97 yards. He also threw two interceptions, one returned for a touchdown by the Huskies' Evan Bell. \nBryant had little support. His receivers dropped six passes. Lyons failed to take advantage of strong early field position, having two drives inside OPRF territory. \n\"We had a lot of chances, but we were just not taking advantage of them,\" sophomore Brandon Fischer said. \"We weren't catching the ball and we weren't blocking.\" \nThe lone offensive bright spot occurred in the third quarter with the team down 28-0. Bryant orchestrated a six-play, 70-yard scoring drive featuring a 37-yard pass to wide receiver Hasahn Austin and a beautiful 29-yard dart to Fischer. Junior running back Riley Kloes punched in the score on a 1-yard dive. \nLyons' defense played better than the statistics suggest. Despite playing with a cast on his right arm, strong safety Jack Walton nearly intercepted OPRF quarterback Keegan Smith and also recorded a spectacular fourth down stop that deprived the Huskies of another scoring chance. \nLyons (5-3, 2-3) travels to York on Oct. 23. A win automatically puts LT in the Class 8A playoffs. A loss muddles the picture but the team's 41 playoff points puts them in good position for a postseason berth. \n\"We have to let [the OPRF] game go and just focus on the next game and pretend as if it's the last game we're ever going to play,\" Fischer said. \nYork (3-5, 1-4) will be playing for pride. \n\"We still have five wins and another game to play,\" Weinberg said. \"It's an important game, and another West Suburban [Silver] game. \n\"And none of them are easy.\" \nâ€“ \nWho: Lyons Township at York \nWhen: 7: 30 p.m. Oct. 23 \nWhere: 355 St. Charles Road, Elmhurst \nRecords: LT 5-3 (2-3), York 3-5 (1-4) \nOutlook: The Dukes suffered their fifth loss to be knocked from playoff contention, but the Lions should be prepared for a tough test against a solid defense and team with nothing to lose.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T20:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T03:38:07.230+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
