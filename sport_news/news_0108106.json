While the BJP was quick to denounce the visit as a “photo opportunity” as it has done with several Rahul’s appearances in the past, Rahul hit back at his detractors for the first time daring them to say what they want and adding: “I will visit weak and poor victims of violence again and again and again.” The Congress too went on an offensive against the BJP accusing it of “insulting” the deceased Dalit children with its caustic, casual remarks. Party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said, “In what category does Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Mann ki Baat” fall? Is that not a photo opportunity? Whenever the Congress tries to offer a healing touch to victims of hate and violence, the BJP accuses it of seeking photo ops. This is an insult to the victims. The ruling party should show some respect to the bereaved.” Rahul himself attacked the BJP for its charge of hankering after photo opportunities with his office tweeting the leader’s anguish, “It’s not an insult to me but to the people here. What do you mean by a photo op? People are dying left, right and centre in this country. People are being beaten up in this country. Absolutely, I will visit again and again and again.” This is the first time the BJP’s photo-op charge has invited rebuttals from Rahul who had faced similar accusations recently when he visited Jantar Mantar to express solidarity with the protesting veterans over their “One Rank, One Pension” demand. So far as the BJP’s latest attack on Rahul goes, it followed social media posts of two contrasting Rahul’s images in a matter of few hours – one showing Rahul enjoying “chaat” at Ram Lila Ground last night and another showing him with the Sunped victims sharing their anguish. Rahul’s office put out both pictures which social media trolls were quick to latch on and the BJP quicker to exploit to level familiar charges. Singhvi, however, said party chief Sonia Gandhi and Rahul had in the past too visited victims of natural calamities and violence irrespective of the political dispensation in the states where such events occur. “The Congress leadership visited Mirchpur in Haryana and recently Rahul Gandhi visited the Congress-ruled Karnataka to meet farmers. They will continue to do so,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:16:24.558+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
