He could be out several weeks and miss the start of the NBA regular season, The Charlotte Observer reported.\nKidd-Gilchrist spent Saturday night in Orlando, Fla., after hitting the court hard in the first half of a preseason win over the Magic. He was fouled on the play by Orlando forward Tobias Harris.\nThe Hornets didn’t estimate how long the fourth-year pro might be out, but typically a dislocation takes three to 12 weeks of recovery time before a patient can return to normal activity. \nIn the off-season, the team signed him to a four-year, $52 million contract extension. He averaged 10.9 points and 7.6 rebounds last season.\nLeBron: Get it done \nLeBron James was done talking about Tristan Thompson’s contract situation. Then he saw his teammate at a wedding Saturday and changed his mind.\nIn his most candid comments yet, James on Sunday called Thompson’s stalemate with the Cavaliers \"a distraction\" and urged both sides to get a deal done.\n\"The last thing you need is a distraction when you try to make a championship run. And we have that right now,\" James said after practice at the team’s facility in Independence, Ohio. \"It’s unfortunate for both sides that we’re going through it right now as a team.\"\nThompson, who played a major role in Cleveland’s run to the NBA Finals last season, has not reported to training camp as he remains in a holdout for a long-term deal. His agent, Rich Paul, and the Cavs have not been able to reach an agreement over the past few months.\n— News service reports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T08:42:54.504+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
