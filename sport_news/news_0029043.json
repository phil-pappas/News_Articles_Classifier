The limit will be two hatchery fish. Something new this year is the ability to keep five rainbow trout of less than 20 inches.\nThis will help remove the triploids that have entered the Columbia below Chief Joseph Dam from net pens on Rufus Woods. It is hoped that the Wenatchee River will open later this month.\nMost Read Stories Seahawks’ Derrick Coleman arrested for investigation of hit, run Boom times in Bothell as McMenamins hotel, entertainment complex opens 7 Juanita football players told police of hazing, attacks Zomato shuts Seattle office, lays off employees across U.S. Can’t sleep?
