I hit it really nice and scrambled well when I needed to.\n\"I had a tough start to the season. I missed quite a few cuts in a row even though I thought I was playing alright,\" said Fitzpatrick.\n\"Now I'm playing decently and getting the results I've been looking for.\"\nFREE TICKETS\nThe British Masters is back on the European Tour schedule for the first time in seven years and 14,625 fans turned up for the opening round, helped by free tickets being handed out.\n\"It doesn't get any better than that,\" said Fitzpatrick. \"The crowd have been absolutely fantastic.\"\nFormer European number one Karlsson would have joined him on 64 but for a bogey five at the last hole.\nTriple major winner Padraig Harrington and fellow Irishman Shane Lowry were among six players to start with a 66 while former world number one Luke Donald went round in 67.\nTournament host Ian Poulter was also well placed after shooting a 68. Lee Westwood, winner of the event in 2007, had a 69 and 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell returned a 70.\n\"To win a British Masters would be very special,\" said Northern Irishman McDowell. \"Outside of my Scottish Open win in 2008 and Wales Open win in 2010, I haven't won here in the United Kingdom.\n\"There is a special element of winning in front of the home fans. I'd dearly love a (British Open) Claret Jug of course but an event like the British Masters would come a close second.\"\n(Editing by Toby Davis )", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T22:30:46.383+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
