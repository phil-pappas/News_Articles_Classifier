Mr. Fry was 82.\nWhile sad, Waymon said he takes solace in that he was able to thank his coach when he did, not realizing Fry would not live much longer.\n\"I can't say what triggered (telling the story) other than something motivated me to reflect back on the people who were instrumental in shaping my life,\" said Waymon, who integrated the KIL during his sophomore year of 1963-64. \"Bob Fry was a great coach, but much more importantly, he was a good man whose true character always shined through, even in the most difficult times.\"\nWhile Waymon remembered his coach's ability to respect others and look past skin color when he allowed him to be a member of the team without hesitation, other former players remembered that Fry was held in high respect.\n\"He had a way of commanding respect, not demanding respect,\" said Bill Justus, who played for Mr. Fry before graduating in 1965 and becoming a standout Tennessee Vol basketball player under coach Ray Mears.\n\"For young men 16 to 18 years of age, his command of respect was outstanding. He didn't force it on his players. It just came naturally.\"\nMr. Fry coached basketball at Fulton for 19 seasons beginning in the 1958-59 school year. With such players as Justus and Ron Widby, who went on to become a multi-sport standout at UT, his teams usually were among the best in Knoxville. His 1961-62 team was state runner-up.\nA 1951 graduate of Knoxville High, Mr. Fry had played and lettered on Tennessee's football team before attending Fuller Theological Seminary in California. He first taught at Tyson Junior High before moving to Fulton. In later years after retiring from local schools, he served as a bailiff.\nMr. Fry's daughter, Jennifer Morrell, said the positive attention her father received after the newspaper story appeared and during his subsequent hospitalization for multiple health complications touched the family greatly. Widby, who has always admired Mr. Fry, was one of those who stopped by the hospital while visiting from Texas, she said.\n\"We got to see a lot of sweet things that were comforting,\" she said.\nFor Justus, the accolades were well deserved.\n\"You can never have enough of a person like Coach Bob Fry in your life, but weren't we fortunate to have him for as long as we did,\" said Justus, who now lives in the Nashville area.\nA funeral service for Mr. Fry will be held Sunday at 3 p.m. at Fountain City United Methodist Church, with visitation following the service.\nJohn Shearer is a freelance contributor.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T16:09:56.530+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
