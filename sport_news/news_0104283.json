That's the rule.\n\"So how about my guy being heads-up and scoring on that play and not keeping his head down, because that's who we are.\"\nThat focus vanished in the bottom half of the seventh inning as the Rangers self-destructed and committed three consecutive errors on routine hits to allow Toronto to load the bases.\nAfter Josh Donaldson hit a single into center to score Dalton Pompey to tie the game, Bautista slammed a three-run homer into the second deck, tossing the bat with added flair that prompted another benches-clearing confrontation.\n\" \"I know crazy things happen in this game, especially this time of year ...I'm still not certain what happened, what was going on what the ruling is,\" said Gibbons.\n\"Really it came down to the rules are what they are and I'm still a bit in the fog about that.\n\"But you didn't want something like that to be the deciding run in a game of this magnitude, so that was kind of my beef. But the umpire crew did a great job, they really did.\"\n(Editing by Greg Stutchbury)", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T05:24:18.400+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
