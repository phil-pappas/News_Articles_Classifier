Bowles said he didn't know about the injury until Monday.\nWilkerson was limited in practice Monday and is expected to undergo an X-ray but Bowles said he expected him to play against the Washington Redskins on Sunday.\nTight end Jeff Cumberland, who suffered a concussion Sept. 27 and missed the game against the Dolphins, practiced, albeit in the red non-contact jersey. Guard Willie Colon, who missed the game against the Dolphins with a knee injury, didn't practice Monday. Nor did running back Bilal Powell, who suffered a groin injury in the win over the Dolphins.\n--Count quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick a fan of the Jets beginning their game preparations a day early this week.\n\"It was good just to get a sweat in and get some work,\" Fitzpatrick said following the Jets' first post-bye practice. \"It's always good to get an extra day of work in against an opponent.\"\nPlus, now that the Jets are preparing for the Redskins, Fitzpatrick can begin to look forward to his weekly post-game meal: Dinner out of the crockpot. Fitzpatrick said he enjoyed his Sunday afternoon with the family but laughed when asked if it included a slow-cooked meal.\n\"No, no crockpot,\" he said.\n--Defensive end Sheldon Richardson was added to the active roster Monday. Richardson was suspended the first four games of the season for failing multiple marijuana tests. He was technically eligible to be activated Oct. 5, the day after the Jets' fourth game, but the Jets had a waiver allowing them to carry him during the bye week without making a roster move. Richardson practiced Monday and is expected to play Sunday, when the Jets host the Washington Redskins.\n--Tight end Wes Saxton was released by the Jets on Monday. He spent one game with the Jets, who promoted him from the practice squad on Oct. 1 after tight end Jeff Cumberland suffered a concussion. Saxton did not record a catch in the Jets 27-14 win over the Dolphins on Oct. 5.\n  NFL considers fines for two Jets after Jake Locker injury New York Jets' Muhammad Wilkerson hobbles off with hamstring injury Jets' Wilkerson OK after N.J. car crash New York Jets 2015 Draft Preview", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T07:18:27.650+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
