So much, that some have thrown their support behind the talk of a European franchise in the league.\n“I wouldn’t mind it,” Celtics guard Marcus Smart said. “It’s amazing being over here. And the competition is at an all-time high here.”\nForward Jordan Mickey even thinks a European team could bring more variety to the NBA with the continent’s own style of play.\n“I would love to come over here and play against European teams,” he said. “It’s just a different style of basketball, so it’s always fun to play against some different competition.”\nThe C’s opened their preseason scheduled with a 124-91 rout of Olimpia Milano in Italy on Tuesday, but face a step up in competition against European champion Real Madrid today.\nPreseason exhibitions outside the United States have become a common occurrence in recent years as the NBA tries to take advantage of basketball’s status as a truly global game. Indeed, the Celtics will even play a regular-season game against the Sacramento Kings in Mexico City on Dec. 3.\nDespite the miles clocked in travelling to Europe, Smart believes the positivity of fostering team spirit outweighs needless energy spent before the season even tips off.\n“It doesn’t interrupt anything we have for preseason,” Smart said. “If anything it helps us, we benefit from it. We get to go and see a beautiful part of the world together as a team and build the chemistry we have.”\nDespite a dominant display against Milano to start preseason in style, Mickey was impressed with what he saw in Italy.\n“There was a lot more ball movement, a fast-paced game and little more physical than I expected,” he said. “We’ve been beating up on each other for a few weeks so it was great to get out there against somebody else and see all our hard work pay off.”\nNot everyone, however, was completely on board with making this a regular occurrence.\n“The downside is the jet lag,” rookie R.J. Hunter said. “The first night I was up till 7 a.m., ordering dinner from room service.”\nIt’s time to get Real\nNormally overshadowed by the soccer team that shares the same name, today’s Celtics opponent, Real Madrid, won a clean sweep of Euroleague, Spanish league and cup titles last season with former NBA players Rudy Fernandez, Sergio Rodriguez and Andrea Nocioni on its roster.\n“We’re very aware that Real Madrid is a quality team,” Celtics forward David Lee said.\n“We’re not overlooking them at all, so the goal is to play better than we did last game, build on what we did (Tuesday) night and come out and get the victory (today).”\nSkills on display for kids\nLee, Smart, Hunter, Mickey and James Young all took part in a shootaround and skills drill yesterday in partnership with NBA Cares and Special Olympics Spain with more than 100 delighted kids in Madrid.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:37:42.114+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
