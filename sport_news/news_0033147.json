Coaching alongside Lane Kiffin, Sarkisian ran USC's offense before getting hired by the University of Washington to take over a winless program in 2009.\nSarkisian rebuilt the Huskies into a regular bowl team, but couldn't lift them among thePac-12's elite. The Torrance, California, native left Washington to return to USC after Haden fired Kiffin five games into the 2013 season and then told interim coach Ed Orgeron that he wouldn't get the full-time job.\nOffensive coordinator Clay Helton has taken over as interim head coach. Helton is in his second stint as USC's interim coach. He led the Trojans to a Las Vegas Bowl victory in 2013, a calendar year in which the Trojans had four different head coaches.", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1992cc27aa7b6fd344a0e19a59b3c985d586d027/c=0-0-2540-2540/local/-/media/2015/10/12/Phoenix/Phoenix/635802465875905985-1012-sark.jpg", "http://www.usctrojans.com/blog/2015/10/sarkisian-terminated-as-usc-football-coach.html"], "published": "2015-10-13T00:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T03:28:44.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
