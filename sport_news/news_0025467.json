According to sources, the Sports Ministry has decided to stop the TOPS funding for those athletes who will fail to secure an Olympics quota for Rio after the end of their qualification tournaments. The athletes, in that case, will no longer be entitled to claim the TOPS money, which has been earmarked for their high-quality training, equipment, competition exposure and medical and scientific support. However, they would continue to receive the financial assistance from the National Sports Development Fund (NSDF). The Ministry has earmarked around Rs 40 crore for TOPS this year, in addition to Rs 100 crore from NSDF. At present, there are 84 elite sportspersons who are eligible for the TOPS funding. Out of them, the Ministry has already given funds of about Rs 1.35 crore to 10 athletes, while many other TOPS beneficiaries have been waiting for the release of the funds. The Ministry’s sudden move might surprise athletes as the TOPS funding was not only restricted to the Rio Games, but till the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. When the scheme was originally launched, it had been decided that the athletes would be entitled to receive funding for other major international competitions as well, which included the World Cups and World Championships. But now, the Ministry has decided to withdraw the TOPS funding for the athletes who fail to qualify for Rio, and will only decide about its continuance after the Games in August. “The athletes who are covered under TOPS need not worry about their future if they don’t qualify for Rio. They would continue to get the financial support through the NSDF for the major international events. TOPS was launched to fund the Rio medal hopefuls. Now, those athletes who will fail to qualify will no longer remain the medal hopes for the country,” a Ministry official said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T04:04:02.199+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
