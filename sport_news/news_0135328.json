(AP) â€” \nSeb Hines scored on a volley in the 80th minute and Orlando City avoided elimination from the playoff race with a 2-1 victory over the Montreal Impact on Saturday night. Orlando City (11-13-8, 41 points) entered the game in seventh place, needing at least a tie to remain in the Eastern Conference playoff race. It won its fourth straight and has two games remaining in the season. Montreal (12-12-6, 42 points) would have clinched a playoff berth with a win, but retained its hold of sixth place and the final playoff position with four games to go. Cyle Larin opened the scoring for Orlando in the 33rd minute, extending his rookie scoring record to 15 goals. Dominic Oduro tied it in the 43rd minute with a loose-ball finish. Orlando City goalkeeper Tally Hall was shown a yellow card for dissent. He argued that he had secured the ball before Oduro kicked it loose. Orlando City teammates, Tommy Redding and Rafael Ramos, suffered a head-to-head collision in the fourth minute. Both left the game on stretchers after a seven-minute delay.
