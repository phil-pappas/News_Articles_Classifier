About 15 feet away, Vince Carter handled a shovel with expertise and Matt Barnes completed nifty work with sod.\n\"I did this at my house this summer,\" Barnes said.\nWith sunshine on a cool Saturday morning in October as the backdrop, the Griz volunteered at Green Leaf Learning Farm to transform it into 1.5 acres of USDA-certified-organic farmland with outdoor classrooms, a mobile farm stand and a farm-to-table dining space.\nNBA players best known for their grit and grind on the court were all smiles while getting down and dirty in South Memphis.\n\"Memphis needs more projects like this around the city. I see it every day,\" said forward Jarnell Stokes, who grew up in Whitehaven. \"When I was growing up, downtown didn't look so good. Now, I stay downtown. I'd like to see the progress they made downtown carry over into areas like South Memphis.\"\nStokes spent most of his time painting.\n\"I've been getting the tall areas,\" he said.\nGreen Leaf Learning Farm is a program of Knowledge Quest, a nonprofit organization in South Memphis. The farm is used to educate students about urban agriculture and healthy eating.\nThe kids grow their own food for meals during KQ's summer camp and after-school programs. The farm also serves the KQ food pantry.\n\"You can always give money, but people really enjoy it when you give your time and effort,\" forward/center Brandan Wright said. \"People latch on to that a little bit more, even though money is great and it can do a lot of different things. But when you give your time and your effort, people are really appreciative.\"\nGriz players and coaches cut boards and nailed them. They carried wheelbarrows filled with gravel, laid sod and performed whatever labor was required.\nCourtney Lee and Jeff Green were called upon to move a heavy, wooden picnic table from one side of the farm to the other.\n\"Guys have been really hands-on. Nobody's trying to walk around and get out of work,\" Joerger said. \"We've got guys who played 35 minutes (Friday night against Oklahoma City) putting sod down and painting. It's just a great day for the community and all of our guys.\"\nProof of Joerger's sentiment could be seen in the looks on the people watching. The Griz worked hard for an hour but made time for autographs, pictures and genuine conversations.\nIt's safe to say that forward Zach Randolph was the biggest social butterfly. Randolph could hardly use his shovel because of the constant flow of greeters. His presence clearly made an impact.\n\"Sometimes it's about conversing with people, and having a conversation with somebody can mean more than giving something,\" Randolph said. \"Building a greater Memphis by coming back to the inner city is really positive. I can identify with all of these challenges. I grew up in this. I can relate. So it's a blessing to be a part of this.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T11:10:33.835+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
