FRANK BELLINO , FRANK BELLINO, STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » MURRIETA – Church pastors are usually the ones giving out advice and encouragement. But when your other job title is head football coach, Sunday morning exchanges with the congregation can take interesting turns.\n“We won a game that got out of hand, and it became embarrassing,” recalled Calvary Murrieta football coach Brad Schwab, who is also the youth pastor at Calvary Chapel in Romoland. “Every time we touched the ball on offense or defense, we scored – even with our junior varsity playing the entire second half.”\nThe pastor was asked the following Sunday to explain his actions as coach on Friday.\n“When I got to church, everyone kept saying, ‘Wow, if a pastor can run up a score like that, then I guess it is OK for all of us to start gambling, drinking and cussing,’” Schwab said. “I tried to explain what happened, but they were having too much fun calling me out on it, so I just took my lumps.”\nSchwab, 50, now in his sixth season as head coach of the Warriors, has taken his lumps on the field, and enjoyed success. His team captured the South Valley League title last season, and is No. 4 in the East Valley Division in the most recent CIF-Southeen Section poll.\nWin or lose, he demands that his players practice what they preach.\n“If I hear any player use profanity, they are done for that game,” Schwab said. “I tell them every year, ‘You can feed the homeless, preach to a packed house, go on mission trips all over the world. But when a kid on the other team hears a curse word out of your mouth, his first response is, I thought this was a Christian school.’”\nSchwab said being a father figure is an important prerequisite for each position.\n“Each job offers different challenges, but coaching tests my faith more,” Schwab said. “The kids I coach are not my own, but that doesn’t stop me from sometimes thinking they are. You want nothing but the best for each one of them.”\nSchwab, who has raised five boys with his wife, Melissa , believes fatherhood and coaching offer similar demands.\n“You can’t treat them all alike,” he said. “Some need encouragement, some need tough love, and some don’t seem to need anything at all.\n“But all of them want to know you care.”\nSchwab’s pastoral duties carry over to his role as coach. There are pre- and postgame team prayers, as well as a short Bible study before each practice and pregame meal.\n“At the end of all the chaos, there is always a good story to tell,” said Schwab’s youngest son, Adam , the starting quarterback and defensive back. “Because of all the wisdom it requires to juggle all of these roles, I know that I can always come to him with any problems I have.”\nSchwab said the football field offers unique challenges to his faith.\n“When you see a kid go down with a season-ending injury that works harder than everyone else, and is a leader spiritually, physically and academically, it breaks your heart,” he said. “You get down on your knees and ask God, ‘Why?’\n“The inevitable answer is that He is in control, not me. You know God has a plan for that young man, but you wish it was a different one.”\nSchwab said the long hours he puts in are well worth the rewards.\n“When a star player at our postseason banquet says the thing he loved the most about his high school football career is that he felt closest to God during the football season, it makes me want to be a part of this ministry as long as God allows,” he said.", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nviy6l-b88509369z.120150930213509000glic1kbc.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nviy6l-b88509369z.120150930213509000glic1k5d.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nviy6l-b88509369z.120150930213509000glic1kbc.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nviy6m-b88509369z.120150930213509000glic1k5b.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nviy6m-b88509369z.120150930213509000glic1kbe.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nviy6l-b88509369z.120150930213509000glic1k5d.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nviy6m-b88509369z.120150930213509000glic1k5b.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nviy6m-b88509369z.120150930213509000glic1kbe.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-09-30T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:13:44.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
