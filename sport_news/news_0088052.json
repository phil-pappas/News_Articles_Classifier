Raiders aren’t seeing it San Francisco Chronicle 8 hrs ago By Vic Tafur © Jack Dempsey, Associated Press Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning throws during an NFL football game between the Denver Broncos and the Minnesota Vikings Sunday, Oct. 4, 2015, in Denver. (AP Photo/Jack Dempsey) We might want to hold off on the changing-of-the-guard stories. You know, Peyton Manning on his way down, Derek Carr showing growth in his second season.\nAdChoices Sunday’s AFC West showdown in Oakland may show a tilt in the balance of the AFC West, but judging from history, it probably won’t.\nWhile Manning is off to a slow start — his passer rating of 80.8 is his lowest since his rookie year of 1998, and he has five interceptions in four games — he is showing signs of his old self as the Broncos use the 39-year-old more in the shotgun.\nAfter going 0-for-8 on throws that traveled more than 20 yards the first two games, Manning is 4-of-6 for 146 yards and a touchdown the past two weeks.\nRaiders defensive coordinator Ken Norton Jr. was asked if he has seen any slippage in watching film of Manning this season.\n“It’s hard to say,” Norton said. “He’s still pretty good, he still knows how to win ballgames. Manning still knows how to get the ball to the right person at the right time. Very smart on the field, very impressed by watching him on film.”\nThanks to his defense, Manning is 4-0 heading into a matchup with a 2-2 Raiders team that he has owned. He is 6-0 with Denver against Oakland, and the average margin of victory has been 23 points.\nLast year, Manning and Co. put up 88 points in the two wins … and this year the Raiders are 31st in the NFL in passing yards allowed, giving up 311 a game. (And that was with TJ Carrie, the safety/cornerback who is questionable for Sunday with a chest injury.)\n“He’s still doing the same things, watching on film,” Raiders safety Charles Woodson said. “He’s still getting the ball out of his hands fairly well, reading defenses as good as any quarterback in the game. He has some great weapons around him, and he’s getting them the ball. He really hasn’t changed too much at all.”\nThe biggest weapon is 6-foot-3, 229-pound wide receiver Demaryius Thomas, who has 361 yards on the season and had 223 in two games against the Raiders last season. One would have to think he’s pretty confident about the matchup against Oakland cornerbacks David Amerson, Neiko Thorpe and DJ Hayden.\n“He can go up and elevate and catch what’s supposed to be a 50-50 ball,” said Raiders coach Jack Del Rio, who was the Broncos’ defensive coordinator last season. “Looks more like 90-10 when he’s over there. Then he’s a monster on those tunnel screens that they run.”\nThe Raiders’ best bet to slow Manning and Thomas may be to keep their offense off the field.\nThe hope is that Carr can build off his early-season success — completing 62.6 percent of his passes for 922 yards with seven touchdowns and two interceptions — and erase last year’s memories against Denver, when he threw for a total of 350 yards with three touchdowns and three interceptions in the two games.\n“He played, I believe, all 16 games last year, and that just plays a huge role when you have that experience,” Manning said. “And just learning how fast guys are and getting on the same page as your receivers in game speed, game experience. It looks like he’s certainly using last year’s experience to his advantage.”\nThe Broncos’ top-rated defense has 18 sacks and thinks it knows what it takes to stop Carr and receivers Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree.\n“He's developing into a big-time quarterback,” Denver linebacker Von Miller said. “It's going to be our job to take away those quick throws, make them hold the ball a little bit, get a rush, stop the run and just play the same Broncos defense that we've been playing.”\nVic Tafur is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.
