The Pirate Parrot, the mascot of the Pittsburgh Pirates, took a wild ride when a team of StratoStar students strapped him onto the payload of a weather balloon. The balloon was launched at the edge of the baseball field during pre-game festivities, and it rose high up into the stratosphere.\nSo why did CSC work with StratoStar to help a parrot fly to 96,000 ft.? CSC wanted to engage female students in a hands-on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) education experience. While women make up 50% of the workforce in the United States, only 25% of STEM jobs are held by women. The CSC is on a mission to reverse the trend with their STEM education programs for female students.\n“It has been great working with Carnegie Science Center,” said StratoStar’s CEO Jason Kruger. “We both have a passion for inspiring the next generation of scientist and engineer who will change the world.”\nThe Pittsburgh Pirates - and their mascot - got involved when they caught wind of CSC’s plans to launch the weather balloon during Carnegie’s Girls Rock Science Weekend, which falls on the first weekend of October. Excited about the opportunity to get students energized about STEM, the Pirates offered to host the launch at their home game against the Cincinnati Reds.\n“I remember playing baseball in the backyard and pretending to hit home runs in a professional baseball stadium,” Krueger said. “It is funny that I did finally fly a ball out of a MLB stadium through a STEM career.”\nThis was CSC’s first launch with StratoStar, but it won’t be the last. The Carnegie Science Center intends to expand the program to offer teachers in Pennsylvania professional development in hands-on experiences and project-based learning. CSC may also begin to offer weather balloon summer camp.\nThe launch was a huge success. The Pirate Parrot sailed into the stratosphere, where the weather balloon burst because of the low atmospheric pressure. As the balloon popped, a parachute deployed, and the Pirate Parrot fell back to earth, 15 miles away from the Pirates’ stadium. The parrot and the payload both were retrieved and the students were able to analyze their flight data.\nAbout StratoStar\nStratoStar is an education company that travels across the country to start project-based learning programs in junior high, high school, college, and graduate schools seeking to put a greater emphasis on their STEM education initiatives. Using weather balloons, easy-to-use software, and a teaching plan that has been implemented in schools at all levels as well as high-profile government institutions, StratoStar takes students away from the textbook and into a real life mission. Students learn 21st-century skills as they plan, build, launch, and analyze the results of a high altitude science mission that will travel to the edge of space complete with video and computer generated flight analysis.\nAbout Carnegie Science Center\nCarnegie Science Center is dedicated to inspiring learning and curiosity by connecting science and technology with everyday life. By making science both relevant and fun, the Science Center’s goal is to increase science literacy in the region and motivate young people to seek careers in science and technology. One of the four Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, the Science Center is Pittsburgh’s premier science exploration destination, reaching more than 700,000 people annually through its hands-on exhibits, camps, classes, and off-site education programs.\n //www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13009856.htm\n ", "external_links": ["http://www.stratostar.net/educators.html", "http://www.carnegiesciencecenter.org/", "http://www.prweb.com/releases/2015/10/prweb13009856.htm"], "published": "2015-10-08T13:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T12:29:07.785+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
