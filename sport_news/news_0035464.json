His agent, Nick Lotsos, told The Post in a phone interview from Greece he would be choosey in accepting a European offer. \nThe thinking is, if Antetokounmpo plays in the D-League again for Westchester, he would be an outright free agent and any NBA club can sign him. Last season in Westchester, the Knicks held his NBA rights.\nNow the Knicks only hold his D-League rights, but that could be traded if the Lotsos finds another organization interested. Thanasis’ brother, the “Greek Freak” Giannis, plays for the Bucks.\n“To go to Europe, we’d want a great opportunity, not just a good opportunity,” Lotsos said. “We will wait a little [to see] what’s going on with some NBA teams, check out some interest, see what’s up there. Most of the European league [teams] are already in progress.”\nExplaining why he would consider Antetokounmpo to return to the D-league for the $25,000 salary, Lotsos said, “It’s first time has chance to be seen and everybody has right to pick him up. A D-League franchise will give him the stage to showcase his skills.”\nLotsos previously has said he wouldn’t have Antetokounmpo play in the D-League another season, but he has since gotten a partially guaranteed training camp deal that paid Antetokounmpo $75,000.\nThe agent said it was clear the Knicks want to keep flexibility by having an extra roster spot.\n“My understanding is they wanted the 15th spot open, because they want it open in case something interesting comes up,” Lotsos said. “I don’t believe [he got an opportunity]. It goes for all the guys [cut].”\nLotsos was referring to Travis Trice, Darion Atkins and Wesley Saunders.\nLotsos got no reading whether the Knicks consider Antetokounmpo a future prospect.\n“I don’t have a feeling if Thanasis has a future there,” Lotsos said. “It’s important wherever he plays [in the D-League], he has an important role. If that’s Westchester, fine. If [there is] not such a plan there, we’d have to find another place. They said he had a good camp, and I believe them.”\nShare this: Facebook Twitter Google Whatsapp Email Filed under new york knicks ,  thanasis antetokounmpo", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T16:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T01:24:38.405+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
