I never once said: ‘I don’t want to play’ or anything like that. He just asked me a general question and I was honest.\n© Provided by Goal.com \"I didn’t lie and say: ‘Oh yes, I feel 100 percent,' but at the same time I never said I didn’t want to play. Obviously, the manager changed his mind about me playing and probably based it on that conversation but I was just being honest.\"\nSterling admits coverage of his controversial exit from Liverpool was hard to accept and believes criticism for his off-field behavior was extreme.\n\"After that, I wouldn’t wish it on anyone; all the negativity that came through. It was difficult for me,\" he added.\n\"I don’t mind bad press when it is about football because hopefully you can do something to put it right. It just felt towards the end [at Liverpool] it was a bit personal. People developed this perception of me and it was shocking to find the way that some people viewed me.”\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.goal.com/en-us"], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T13:17:56.085+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
