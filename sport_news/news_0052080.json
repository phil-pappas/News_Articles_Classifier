Consistent, stable, productive and proud? Yes to all of that. But elite does not come to mind.\nThat could begin to change Saturday as veteran head coach Frank Solich and his undefeated Bobcats (3-0), one of only two undefeated teams in the league, travel to play at Minnesota (3-0) with a solid chance at getting a victory.\nThe fourth week of the season is when teams should be hitting their stride. After victories over Idaho, Marshall and Southeastern Louisiana, OU has shown to have a defense stout enough to contain a high-powered offense like Marshall's, allowing a MAC-low 17.3 points a game, and an offense strong enough to average 33.7 points a game.\nWith senior quarterback Derrius Vick , plus a solid stable of tailbacks, a victory will send them into conference play next week as a sure MAC East favorite and easily on target to become bowl eligible. That would be an elite accomplishment.\nOU-Minnesota is one of five MAC games this week against Big Ten competition, and one of several with upset possibilities.\nLocally, Kent State (1-2) hosts Marshall (2-1) with the Golden Flashes sporting a quality defense -- No. 1 in the MAC allowing 199 yards per game -- but searching desperately for production and firepower on offense, where they rank as one of the worst offensive teams in the nation. Kent has yet to score an offensive touchdown against an FBS team.\nAkron (1-2) is at Louisiana-Lafayette (1-1), a team that has recorded nine wins in each of the last four seasons and advanced to a bowl game. The Zips will start a new quarterback, Tommy Woodson, who has moved ahead of fellow sophomore Tra'Von Chapman.\nFollowing is Saturday's schedule\nBowling Green at Purdue; noon BTN -- BG has already defeated one Big Ten team (Maryland) this season. Can this be No. 2? Central Michigan at No. 2 Michigan State; noon, ESPN3 -- Believe it or not, CMU has fared well against the Spartans in the past. OU at Minnesota; 3:30 p.m. BTN -- Undefeated vs. undefeated. Western Michigan at No. 1 Ohio State; 3:30 p.m. ABC -- Can the Broncos make this a game? Ball State at No. 17 Northwestern; 8 p.m. BTN -- Could be another close one . . . or a blowout. N. Illinois at Boston College; 1 p.m. ESNP3 Marshall at Kent State; 3:30 p.m. ASN, ESPN3 Nevada at Buffalo; 3:30 p.m. ESPN3 UMass at No. 6 Notre Dame; 3:30 p.m. NBC Army at Eastern Michigan; 6 p.m. ESPN3 Akron at Louisiana-Lafayette; 7 p.m. ESPN3 Arkansas State at Toledo; 7 p.m. ESPN3", "external_links": ["http://www.ohiobobcats.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/frank_solich_217835.html", "http://www.ohiobobcats.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/derrius_vick_765007.html", "http://www.ohiobobcats.com/sports/m-footbl/ohio-m-footbl-body.html", "http://static.polldaddy.com/p/9096083.js", "http://www.mac-sports.com/index.aspx?path=football&"], "published": "2015-09-25T22:02:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T19:27:46.145+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
