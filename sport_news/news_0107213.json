A A A \nThe Valencia girls volleyball team is soaring above the rest of the Foothill League. \nThe Vikings stayed unbeaten in league play Tuesday night, sweeping West Ranch in straight games (25-16, 25-13, 25-14) at West Ranch High. \nEven after graduating six players from last year’s CIF-Southern Section playoff team, Valencia (15-7 overall, 6-0 in Foothill) has only dropped one game in its six league matches so far. \n“I am really hoping we go undefeated the whole season because my sophomore and junior year on varsity we lost at least one (match),” said Valencia opposite Emily Burns. “We’ve never been undefeated. So I’m really hoping we do it this year because that’s important for me, and it’ll lead (us) into CIF with the momentum.” \nBut the Vikings already have momentum. \nSince outside hitter Lauren Russ and middle blocker Bri Coleman have been inserted into the Valencia lineup, the Vikings have been even stronger than the first half of the conference season. \n“The last time we played Valencia we weren’t proud of our performance but today we are,” said West Ranch head coach Brandon Pank. “It’s tough to see, but we played way better volleyball against a way better Valencia team. Last time they didn’t have Lauren Russ, they didn’t have Bri Coleman, who are two clear starters and some of the best volleyball players in this valley.” \nRuss, who is a sophomore and was briefly out at the beginning of conference due to a rolled ankle, had a game-high 13 kills and 12 digs in Valencia’s win over West Ranch. \nColeman, who transferred from Saugus and had to sit out for 30 days due to a mandatory CIF rule, added four kills and two blocks on the night. \nBurns tallied 12 kills, while Kelsey Knudsen added nine kills. Rachel Perez led the Vikings in passing with 37 assists and notched two aces, \nBut Valencia hasn’t just been successful on offense, Tuesday night its defense was key. \nDemi Dawson led the Vikings with 15 digs, while Russ and Knudsen added 12 digs on the night. Burns had another five digs. \n“I thought we did a really nice job on defense,” said Valencia head coach Ray Sanchez. “We did really great things all around, except for serving. It was a well-played match once we served the ball in.” \nThe Vikings did have 14 service errors on the night. \nThe service errors helped the Wildcats, who served, passed and blocked the ball well. But the West Ranch attack couldn’t get enough strikes to get through the tough Valencia defense. \nLeading the Wildcats were Annika Bergstrom and Janessa Chase with three kills each. Chase had eight digs. \nJordan Hilst and Kaitlin Schultz both had three blocks on the night, and Katie Jacobs and Tasha Skabelund each tallied two blocks against the strong Valencia strikers. \nWest Ranch moves to 3-3 in league and 7-9-1 overall. The Wildcats next face Hart Thursday night at Hart High. \nHart 3, Canyon 0 \nThe Indians improved to 5-1 in league play and 9-4 overall after sweeping the Cowboys 3-0 by game scores of 25-11, 25-14, 25-13 on Tuesday night. Lexi Chabiniak led Hart on the attack with nine kills. The Indians’ Brooke Boron added eight kills, while Natasha Stewart notched five kills. Ashley Aponik tallied 26 assists on the night for Hart.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T08:03:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T11:13:52.311+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
