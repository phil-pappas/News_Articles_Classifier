Hargreaves ran a smart race, letting Irish junior champion Kevin Mulcaire of Ennis TC and Clonliffe's Mark Kenneally do the hard work before taking over in front with about a lap to go.\nBrandon Hargreaves John Coghlan of MSB ran a strong final lap to finish second.\nMcGlynn, who captained the Irish women's team to third at last year's European Cross-Country, led from the start, with Teresa Doherty of Letterkenny passed for second place with about a lap to go by Shona Heaslip of Riocht, who is coached by Niamh O'Sullivan.\nO'Sullivan, who has won the British and Irish Cross-County title more than once, was in action herself aiming to nail down a place on the Irish W50 team for this year's international, which takes place in Santry on November 14.\nAs it happens, both McGlynn and Doherty are eligible for the Irish W35 team - and if they decided to run, could help Ireland to a historic first victory at the international. Last time it was held in Santry, Ireland lost to England by one single point.\nOther masters showing good form included Carmel Parnell of Leevale, who goes for a record tenth title at the masters' international and was a comfortable winner of the W60 category in the 5km trial race.\nFirst master home was national champion Natasha Adams of Letterkenny.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T10:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T16:38:58.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
