The Matadors will take on the winner of Monday's other quarterfinal pitting Mesa (No. 4 seed) at Pima (No. 3 seed).This fall of 2015 marked one of the toughest, most grueling league championship runs for the Roughriders in recent memory, primarily because of the strength of the league's top-tier teams, and partly because of a wet fall that forced a few match postponements.NJCAA No. 3-ranked Yavapai won its third league game in as many days, all on the road, after blanking Phoenix Saturday.The Roughriders were rained out Tuesday, Oct. 20, at Glendale, forcing them to reschedule the match. YC proceeded to defeat Chandler-Gilbert, 1-0, on Thursday and turn around and beat Glendale, 2-1, on Friday.On Saturday, the Roughriders completed the hat trick, if you will, and no doubt gained confidence heading into the postseason.In a scoreless tie with Phoenix at halftime, Yavapai's leading scorer, Reece Weldon, put the visitors on the board early in the second half, in the 47th minute, on an assist from Miles McRae.Hugo Gutierrez followed with an insurance goal in the 60th minute on a helper from Ather Dawood to hand YC the 2-0 edge. Roughriders' standout goalie Greg Patenaude went the distance in the match, which represented YC's 10th shutout of the season.Yavapai needed every one of its final three victories to claim the ACCAC championship and earn a quarterfinal-round bye into regionals.The Roughriders and Western finished the regular season with identical 17-2-1 conference records. However, Yavapai (19-2-1 overall), which split its season series against Western, won the tiebreaker for the conference title.The tiebreaker is based on how Yavapai and Western fared against the league's third-place team, Pima. Yavapai defeated and tied Pima, while Western beat and lost to Pima.If the Roughriders win the region title, they would travel to the West District playoff Nov. 7. The West District champ earns an automatic berth into the NJCAA National Tournament Nov. 16-18 and Nov. 20 and 21 in Axton, Virginia.VOLLEYBALLYavapai 3Arizona Western 2At least one thing is certain for the Yavapai College volleyball team in 2015: it will play for the Region I, Division I championship.On Friday, Oct. 23, at Walraven Gym in Prescott, the Roughriders swept Arizona Conference foe Arizona Western, 25-21, 25-22, 25-15, to clinch hosting duties for the region title match and garner the program's first postseason berth since 2009. (The winner of the region championship will advance to the NJCAA Division I National Tournament in November.)But Yavapai wasn't quite done. In a marathon match on Saturday afternoon, Oct. 24, Yavapai came back from a two-game deficit to edge Western in their final meeting of the regular season, 17-25, 20-25, 25-22, 25-21, 15-8, in Prescott.In the process, Yavapai knocked Western out of the postseason.The Roughriders (19-6 overall, 12-2 conference) will end the 2015 regular campaign with league home matches versus Eastern Arizona (7 p.m., Oct. 28) and Central Arizona (7 p.m., Oct. 30), both at Walraven Gym.Yavapai won't know until late Wednesday, Nov. 4, which league opponent it will play host to in the regional final.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T09:37:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:37:17.491+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
