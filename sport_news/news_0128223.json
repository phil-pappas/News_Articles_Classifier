Still, there were further goals to be scored, and this time Gamal - brought on as a half time substitute instead of Morsi - put his name on the scoresheet with just seconds left.\nAgain, Gaber was the man who assisted in the goal, which was largely similar to Koka's second, but this time it was an unmarked Gamal who found the net from inside the box.\n(For more sports news and updates, follow Ahram Online Sports on Twitter at @AO_Sports and on Facebook at AhramOnlineSports .)", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-11T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:44:52.005+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
