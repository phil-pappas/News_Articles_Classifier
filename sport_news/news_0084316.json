Spiller lowering the boom on the Cowboys. His electrifying 80-yard touchdown catch-and-run delivered a dramatic 26-20 overtime victory to the Saints . \nIt was the Saints' biggest play of the season -- literally and figuratively. The Saints had not had a play longer than 30 yards in their previous 13 quarters. The offense once considered the most feared in the NFL suddenly had become the dink-and-dunk show. Where yards once came in chunks, they now came in bites and nibbles. \nThen, out of nowhere, a detonation. In football jargon, the explosive play. \nAnd at last, a victory. C.J. Spiller to Drew Brees: 'This is your (game) ball, brother' C.J. Spiller gives the game-winning ball to Drew Brees. \n\"As soon as I heard the play call coming out of (Saints coach) Sean Payton's mouth,\" Brees said, \"I thought, 'This is it. This is going the distance.'\" \nIt didn't take long for Spiller, a former track standout at Clemson, to cover the 80 yards. For the record, the play took exactly 10 seconds, and just like that, the shortest overtime in NFL history was completed. Two plays. Thirteen seconds. \nTechnically, the wheel-route rub play wasn't a bomb. But it might as well have been. It might not have registered on the Richter Scale like LSU's famous Earthquake Game in 1988, but it certainly shook up New Orleans Saints fans, who were on the brink of apoplexy after watching Zach Hocker bang his potential winning 30-yard field-goal attempt off the left upright in the waning seconds of regulation. Drew Brees is all smiles about C. J. Spiller Drew Brees to C.J. Spiller for the OT win over Dallas. \nHocker's improbable miss set the stage for the Brees-to-Spiller heroics and one of the most improbable wins in recent memory. After all, Brees failed to complete a pass for a gain of longer than 21 yards in his first 38 attempts and didn't have a pass completion of longer than 24 yards in his previous start against Tampa Bay. \nBut when the Saints needed a big play most, Brees delivered. He hit Brandon Coleman for 30 yards on his 39 th attempt to set up Hocker for the potential game-winner in the frantic final seconds of regulation. Then, after an ill-timed drop by Khiry Robinson on the first play of overtime, he found Spiller on a wheel route in the right flat and the speedster eluded linebacker Anthony Hitchens and safety Barry Church on his way to the end zone. \n\"As soon as I saw C.J. catch the ball, I knew it was game over,\" Saints wide receiver Brandin Cooks said. \nThe touchdown pass was the 400 th of Brees' illustrious career and will undoubtedly be one of his most memorable. \n\"As that ball bounced off the upright, I thought, 'All right, this is not how God intended for us to win it,'\" Brees said. \"I know he's got a plan for us to win it. I did think to myself, maybe God intended for No. 400 to win this game. ... And it was huge the way we won it, too.\" Sean Payton on the OT win over the Cowboys Sean Payton on the OT win over the Cowboys. \nThe win wasn't an artistic masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. In a penalty-laden matchup of dink-and-dunk offenses, the Saints simply had the better dink-and-dunker on their side. And for a chance, their young defense wasn't the worst unit on the field. In their injury-riddle counterparts from Dallas, the discovered a unit with more holes than their own. \nSo this win won't go down as one of the best of the Payton-Brees era, but who cares? When you're 0-3, style points are irrelevant. \nThe Saints just needed a win. Any win. Any way possible. \nThis was a gut check. The sense of urgency on the Saints' sideline was tangible from the press box. Keenan Lewis and Terron Armstead both suffered undisclosed injuries that required treatment from medical staff on the sideline. Both returned to action, even though both clearly were less than 100 percent. \nThe Saints knew they had to have this one. Atlanta and Carolina each won earlier in the day. Another loss would have been devastating to their psyches, much less to their win-loss record. \nAnd in the end, they got their much-needed first victory -- in resounding fashion. \n\"I am proud of our guys for the win,\" Saints coach Sean Payton said. \"It's good to get a win. It's that simple.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T15:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:13:45.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
