The school placed him on paid administrative leave on Oct. 2 when the allegations surfaced and said it is taking them seriously. \nLouisville men's basketball spokesman Kenny Klein said in a text message Tuesday that \"to preserve the integrity of the review process, the university will withhold comment on any details until the review is concluded.\" \nNo one answered at Powell's home Tuesday afternoon.

(AP Photo/Ed Reinke, File) \nOklahoma State coach Travis Ford, who played for Pitino at Kentucky, said he is 100 percent confident Pitino knew nothing of the sex parties, if the allegations are true. \nFord said Tuesday during Big 12 Conference media day \"for somebody who played for him and knows what he stands for and his expectations out of his players and how he does things, I know there is no chance in the world he knew anything about it.\" \nAt a season tipoff luncheon Oct. 13 with Cardinals fans and supporters, Pitino said he understood the motivation behind Powell's book but questioned the need for those activities in light of the talent his program has produced in recent years. \n\"From our end of the thing, I don't get the 'why?' It doesn't make sense,\" Pitino said then, reiterating his adherence to NCAA regulations. \nPitino said if the allegations are true, \"those responsible will pay the price\" and that his program \"will get through this the right way.\" \nPowell's assertions have led to four separate investigations, the two most recent coming two weeks ago. \nCampus police chief Wayne Hall announced that his department would work with Louisville Metro Police and the Commonwealth's Attorney's Office to review the allegations for possible criminal charges. \nTwo days later the University of Louisville Foundation announced the hiring of a law firm to review the allegations. Investigations by the athletic department and the NCAA were launched immediately after the school was notified of the book's allegations in late August. \nPowell told ESPN that she tried to notify the NCAA this spring about her allegations but was hung up on by someone at college athletics' governing body. \nThe NCAA didn't comment on the allegation, but spokeswoman Emily James did say in an email on Tuesday, \"As with any potential rule violation, we welcome a conversation with anyone who has information.\" \n___ \nAP Sports Writers Mike Marot in Indianapolis, and Dave Skretta in Kansas City, Missouri, contributed to this report.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T02:03:49.454+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
