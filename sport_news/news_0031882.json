And he left unexpectedly,\" Gilmore said. \"It was kind of a shock. I don't know what the reason was for, but we're happy we got Rex. He's a loyal coach.\"\nGilmore was one of a number of Bills players who last week discussed Marrone's departure before Buffalo (3-3) left for London to play Jacksonville (1-5) on Sunday. Marrone is now the Jaguars' assistant head coach and offensive line coach.\n\"I'd say there's going to be some hard feelings in this locker room toward him in the manner he left,\" center Eric Wood said. \"I think a lot of people thought we had a good thing going and had a lot to build on. And it said a lot about what he thought about our situation moving forward that he left.\"", "external_links": ["http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/17/8836065/3/square_gallery_thumb.jpg", "http://ww2.hdnux.com/photos/41/55/17/8836065/3/920x920.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T05:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:33:57.992+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
