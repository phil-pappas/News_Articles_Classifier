When we looked at my rehab time we thought it would be about a month, maybe enough to get fit for the World Cup. If there were any injuries there would be a chance for me to put my hand up. \n\"Obviously with the injuries we've had it gave me a chance and now to be here starting a big quarter-final it's a dream come true.\" \nIt's probably fair to say that as player who was part of the mighty New Zealand under-20 World Cup side in 2011 and who played Super Rugby as a teenager, the 24-year-old's rugby dreams may have involved a black, rather than red shirt. \nHowever, having moved to Wales two years ago and qualifying to play for them via his Welsh-born mother, he soon came into Gatland's view. \nHe made his debut as a replacement in the August warm-up against Ireland and his versatility -– he can play flyhalf or fullback -– and goalkicking ability made him a strong contender for the original squad. \nNow fully fit and firing, he held off the challenge of the experienced James Hook, who was called up alongside him to replace Scott Williams and Hallam Amos, for the fullback starting berth on Saturday. \n\"It’s a special moment for me, my family are all here, and for the team,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T18:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T18:54:23.368+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
