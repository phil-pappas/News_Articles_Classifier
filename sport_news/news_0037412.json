I got the shots, I put the cast on it and went out there to play, and it still felt like it did in practice when I couldn't use (it). \n\"I felt like I was playing with one hand, so when it came down to it, I felt like I was going to be letting the team down if I was out there, bracing myself only playing with a left hand, so it came down to that decision and that's why I ended up not playing.\" \nHaden said making the decision not to play was \"the worst feeling ever\" because he wanted to be there next to his teammates competing to even the Browns' record at .500. \n\"I wanted to go. I wanted to play,\" Haden said. \"Me not being out there, I understand I'm a guy that we need for this defense. I'm in zero, we rolling coverages away, it's really not a one-for-one swap, so I can see where the coaches could come from not knowing that they gotta make game-plan decisions at the time of the game, so I can completely understand where they were coming from, but where I was coming from was I want to be out there. I want to help my guys and at the end of the day, if I'm going to hurt them not being able to use both hands and only playing left handed, it's not going to be good. \n\"I just want to be out there for the squad. My thing was just me being out there and me wanting to play so bad, it was just coaches knew my finger was messed up and I was telling them, but they didn't understand to the extent that me wanting to play so much. I don't think I was clear, so it's just a miscommunication.\" \nHaden is no stranger to playing with pain, as he battled both a shoulder injury and the flu to be on the field in last year's regular-season finale against the Baltimore Ravens at M&T Bank Stadium. Despite the Browns being out of the playoff chase after starting the season at 7-4, Haden wanted to be on the field to help his team finish with a .500 record. \nAnd because Haden has played through pain before, it made the questions about his toughness and desire that much more painful for the sixth-year pro. \n\"It's a little upsetting to me,\" Haden said. \"I play so hard. I know in the locker room, my guys, they don't question that at all, just me wanting to be out there so much, it's kind of what the problem was. I wanted to be out there so bad that I couldn't see myself not playing, but at the end of the day, I would have been out there and I would have been a liability to the team more than helping them, and that's not what I want to do at all. \n\"For them to say Joe's not trying to play, that really hurts because I've been in Cleveland for a long time, feeling like you've got to prove yourself over and over, fight and play through injuries, it's just like, 'Man, if I'm hurt, I'm hurt. If I can't go, I can't go.' Hurt is different than injured. I play hurt all the time, but if I'm injured and I feel like I'm going to hurt the team, I'm not going to go out there. That's just how it is. I'm not going to go out there hurting us.\" \nHaden believes his finger was broken in the second half of the loss to the Raiders, when his hand got tangled up in the jersey of Oakland rookie wide receiver Amari Cooper. He immediately knew something was wrong, but continued to play. It was only afterward that an X-ray proved his finger was indeed broken. \nAlthough still having it wrapped up after Wednesday's practice, Haden said the broken finger \"is getting better,\" and now, the aim is to be on the field when the Browns open AFC North Division play against the Ravens in Baltimore Sunday. \n\"That's the goal,\" Haden said. \"That's the same thing that I'm working on and I keep trying to get it better. It's broken, so I'm just trying to figure out how (to get it) wrapped up, casted up. (I'm) just coming into treatment every day, going day by day, trying to get it better.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wkyc.com/1RunNlc TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T01:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:16:46.195+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
