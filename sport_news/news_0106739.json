But the most wonderful feature is the utter failure of our contemporary to prove what else India should do. It admits that \"India's contribution should be commensurate with her wealth and position in the Empire\". But in examining these our contemporary has conveniently ignored India's status and position in the Empire and as regards her wealth it says that economies should be effected. Shall we cut down railways grants or public works grants or educational or sanitary allotments? Or shall the Government employ the cheaper India agency in place of the costly European wherever that is likely to effect savings? Nothing is said of this. But we told that \"The average annual earnings of the population (in India) are estimated at Â£600, 000,000, of which one third probably represents the income of the well-do-do.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T04:13:15.553+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
