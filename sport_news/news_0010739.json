Stewart and Mike Hughes have been suspended indefinitely from team-related activities for a violation of team rules. The university said in a statement the suspensions are the result of an incident that occurred Oct. 4 in Chapel Hill. \n\"We have been aware of this situation since the night of the altercation and have been working closely with the University and Chapel Hill Police to gather relevant information,'' UNC coach Larry Fedora said in a statement. \"We hold our players to a high standard and M.J. And Mike will face the consequences for their involvement.'' \nStewart is a 5-foot-11, 200-pound sophomore from Arlington, Virginia, who was a starter in the Tar Heels first five games this season. He ranks fifth on the team in tackles (20) and is the leader in interceptions with three. \nThis marks the second suspension in Stewart's short time in Chapel Hill. He was also suspended briefly in April 2014 along with three other players for their role in an alleged hazing incident involving another teammate. \nJunior Brian Walker is expected to take over Stewart's starting job in Saturday's game against the Demon Deacons. \nHughes, a 5-11, 185-pounder from New Bern, is one of the prize signees from UNC's recruiting Class of 2015. He's appeared in five games and made four tackles as the backup to starter Des Lawrence, but his playing time has gradually increased as the season has progressed.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:24:17.495+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
