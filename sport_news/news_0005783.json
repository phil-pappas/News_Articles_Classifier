For two to three days, there was total absence by any responsible representative to make any move or a statement to assuage the feelings or the sentiments of the peaceful protesters,\" he said.\nGadh said the government cannot blame the protesters for the violence in the state.\n\"There was no apparent violence and it is being reported wrongly in the media. It is only police which used ruthless force which led to people burning vehicles in outrage. People were under restraint. This was not a protest by people with questionable motives,\" he said.\n\"Government of Punjab must reign in this kind of irresponsible action by the security forces and no loss of life should take place in any police action,\" he said. —PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T14:16:24.752+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
