Chris Burns became the first openly gay Division 1 basketball coach after revealing a secret that — at one time — he had tried to bury with lies out of fear his sexual orientation could affect his career.\nThe assistant basketball coach at Bryant University, in Smithfield, R.I., penned a first-person essay for Outsports.com and gave an interview to USA TODAY Sports , saying that the legalization of same-sex marriage was the moment he knew it was time to publicly come out.\nBurns had told Bryant head coach Tim O'Shea over a year ago that he was gay, then the team's three captains, but it wasn't until more recently that he sat down the entire squad.\n“There are parts of this business that lead me to believe what I’m about to tell you is not acceptable here. This is something I struggle with. It’s made me consider giving up coaching. It’s made me think I’m not supposed to be here,\" Bryant said he told his team. \"I'm a gay man.\"\n“There was an initial shock factor,” senior forward Curtis Oakley said. “But everyone was, like, ‘Yo, Burns, we rockin’ with you.’ It was all love.”\nBurns, 31, once played at Bryant himself, leading the Bulldogs to a Divsion II 2005 national championship game. When it came to his career, however, the point guard felt he had a choice to make.\n\"It becomes: What do I love more?” Burns said. “Being a basketball coach? Or being able to be myself?”\nIt turns out, he could be both. Burns said people have been incredibly supportive. One person, in particular, who reached out to him is Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski.\n\"It takes a lot of courage to do what he's doing and I surely applaud him for it,\" Krzyzewski told USA TODAY Sports . \"My message to him is, first off, congratulations, I'm very proud of you. Next, please know you'll be accepted by your brothers in the sport of men's basketball. You're included now in a very strong way. I think this will be something coaches in our sport will love.\"\nCoach K added that he doesn't think Burns' sexual orientation will \"hinder him from advancing\" in basketball.\n\"Since I started telling people in college basketball over the last few months, I've realized my fears were far worse than reality,\" Burns wrote. \"I've realized that people, for the most part, are human beings first. For a guy who's relatively cynical and can be negative, the reactions of people in my sport and in my life have shut me right up and reenergized my hope in the human spirit, in empathy.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.outsports.com/2015/10/7/9474273/bryant-university-basketball-coach-chris-burns-gay", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2015/10/08/duke-mike-krzyzewski-applauds-first-openly-gay-coach-chris-burns/73407024/", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2015/10/07/chris-burns-bryant-university-gay-division-i-assistant-coach/73361878/"], "published": "2015-10-08T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:14:28.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
