Vendors lined up at the Sioux Falls Regional Airport Friday to greet all the hunters who arrived by plane. One of those vendors came a long distance to stake his claim to South Dakota pheasant country. \nHunters are willing to spend thousands of dollars on their trip to South Dakota. But many find the allure of free stuff irresistible. The cap-making machine run by Custom Embroidery & Design in Sioux Falls serves as a mechanical call of the wild for hunters. \n\"They hear that noise, the motor and that's all it takes. They gather around and there's sometimes 10-12 guys standing around discussing how they can fix it or how they could make it go faster, the Tim Taylor effect,\" Terri Carl of Custom Embroidery & Design said. \nThe pheasant opener a kind of ringneck reunion for many vendors and hunters. \n\"We have one guy for the last few years, Huntsville, Alabama. He comes up every year, gives me a hug, picks out his hat and walks off. I don't know his name, but I know he's from Huntsville, Alabama and he worked for NASA, and that's it,\" Carl said. \nMany of the hunters simply take their free stuff and head off to the fields. But others remember the vendors they met here at the airport and return as paying customers. \n\"They have time in-between their ride and so they'll linger back and they'll look and then they're the ones that buy,\" Carl said. \nKansas-based Roosterwear is perched at the airport for the very first time. \n\"So we didn't know what to expect, but we really expect a lot of different good things so finding out a lot of good things,\" Roosterwear owner Kenneth Fields said. \nOwner Kenneth Fields thinks an out-of-state company like his can grab a piece of the market share in South Dakota. \n\"I hope to move some product, but it also helps me to get the word out about Roosterwear,\" Fields said. \nThat word of mouth can be a valuable marketing tool for a newcomer like Roosterwear. To hunters its all about the birds. But to vendors, it's all about the brand. \nFields say his Roosterwear sales are very weather-dependent. The cooler the conditions, the more sweatshirts he sells, the warmer it is, the more t-shirts he moves. He brought plenty of both, just in case. Â© 2015 KELOLAND TV.
