The consensus in their locker room is that the biggest change the players have been facing after the team’s move from Long Island is how to get to their jobs.\n“For me, it was a couple lefts and a right (to Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum), and now it’s a 45 minute train ride,” says captain John Tavares .\nMost of the Isles live out on the Island, where their practice facility remains, and they are now taking the Long Island Rail Road to Barclays Center. Morning skates on game days are in Brooklyn at 10:30 a.m., so the players will be hopping on a train, sometimes during the morning rush hour. It's a culture change from a suburban to a more urban feel. Center Frans Nielsen says the trip makes him feel like “a real New Yorker taking the train to work every day.”\n“It’s pretty easy, though,” says Tavares. “It’s nice, you can just throw some headphones on or hang with some of your teammates and relax on the way down. It’s been a pretty good adjustment so far through training camp.”\nNHL Video New York Islanders 2015-16 preview by Nick Forrester", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/@sarahbarshop"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:04:18.997+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
