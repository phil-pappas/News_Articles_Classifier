Where better to do it than at one of the Portland area's creative and horrifying haunted houses – from the \"full contact terror\" in Gresham to the old grain elevator out past Newberg.\nLast year we held our first reader poll to determine the best haunted house around the area, a contest won by the always-hyped Fright Town in Portland. This year we're putting them all back up to a vote, but since Fright Town so completely dominated the competition last year, I'm removing it from the poll for 2015.\nNo offense, Fright Town , you're just too popular to compete here.\nThe rest of the candidates are below. Choose wisely, and may the best haunted house win!\nThe Candidates\nMilburn's Haunted Manor – Located just outside Hubbard, the old Milburn Manor Hotel is supposedly the scene of a grizzly unsolved murder...\nCarlton Haunted Granary – The Madsen Grain Elevator out in Carlton is transformed into a haunted house. Little to no details are offered online, making it all the scarier. (Read a 2013 Oregonian review .)\nThe Fear PDX – The Fear has moved from Vancouver to a location near the PDX airport, where you can pick from five attractions: Blood Moon, Factory of the Undead, Festival of Freaks, The Condemned and The Harvest.\nFear Asylum – Run by the Milwaukie Elks Club, the haunted asylum focuses on exposing you to your worst fears, whatever they may be. Special \"lights out hours\" on Oct. 11, 18 and 25 give you only a glow stick to navigate the horrors.\n13 th Door – A winding maze of horrors, the Beaverton haunted house sets up a host of diverse and detailed sets.\nHouse of Shadows – The Gresham haunted house is billed as a \"full contact terror experience,\" meaning the actors can, and will, physically harass you. It offers three haunts this year: Sinister Circus, Purgatory and Hooch.\n--Jamie Hale | jhale@oregonian.com | @HaleJamesB", "external_links": ["http://www.frighttown.com/", "http://thehouseofshadows.net/index.html", "http://app.contenttools.co/polls/2018/embed.js?show_name=no&show_description=no&show_sharing_options=yes&show_cover_image=no", "http://13thdoor.com/", "https://www.facebook.com/CarltonsHauntedHalloween", "https://www.google.com/maps/d/embed?mid=zyLOJ_1BVO4E.kzOSjklch4I0", "http://www.fearasylumhauntedattraction.com/", "http://www.fearpdx.com/", "http://milburnmanor.com/wordpress_1375069030/", "http://www.twitter.com/halejamesb"], "published": "2015-10-14T16:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:28:46.899+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
