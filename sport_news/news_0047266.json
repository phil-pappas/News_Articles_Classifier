The 26-year-old from Rochester is three-bouts old in the circuit and has a 2-1 win-loss record.\nDespite the verbal provocations, Vijender has remained his usual composed self and has promised to answer every threat with his punches in the ring.\n\"I am totally focussed and waiting for the right moment to reply in the ring. I am not at all bothered by his comments. I will reply with my punches,\" Vijender said on the eve of the bout.\nVijender, who signed up with Queensberry Promotions in July, is not the first Indian to enter the professional arena with the likes of Gurcharan Singh and Pradeep Sihag having been a regular in the circuit earlier. However, never before has an Indian boxer's professional debut generated this kind of hype. This can largely be attributed to his equally unprecedented success as an amateur boxer, a highlight of which was becoming the world number one in middleweight at one stage.\nThe Haryana-lad would be walking in to a couple of thumping Punjabi songs -- 'Singh is King' and 'Singh is Bling' -- and would look to make sure that the music keep playing at the end of the four round that he will fight tomorrow.\n\"I am looking forward to a winning start. I am not under any pressure, I am taking this as a responsibility. My performance in professional boxing will open new hopes for young Indian boxers. I am eagerly waiting to enter the ring against Sonny. My strategy is to go in and hit very hard,\" he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:41:15.901+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
