But he is determined to expand his perimeter game and become a more complete player.\n\"We played seven games in 10 nights, and that improves you a lot,\" Antetokounmpo said of his experience in the EuroBasket 2015 tournament in September. \"I tried to work on my game.\"\nAntetokounmpo averaged 9.8 points and a team-leading 6.9 rebounds while helping Greece to a fifth-place finish. The Greeks' only loss in the tournament came to eventual champion Spain in the quarterfinals, a 73-71 defeat, despite 12 points and a game-high 17 rebounds from Antetokounmpo.\nThe 20-year-old joked with reporters on media day, saying he had not hit the 7-foot mark and was sorry to disappoint.\nHe said Thursday he had gained 4 or 5 pounds and was at 222 pounds entering training camp.\n\"I think I'm great right here,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I don't want to be heavier. In summer league (workouts) I was a little bit heavier and I didn't feel so good.\"\nBucks coach Jason Kidd did not want Antetokounmpo shooting 3-pointers in games for most of last season, but the young forward worked on it daily in practice.\nHe was encouraged that he sank 10 of 26 3-point attempts at the EuroBasket, even though the FIBA distance is several feet shorter than the NBA distance. He attempted only 44 threes (making seven) in 81 games with the Bucks last season.\n\"I've just got to shoot a lot of 3s in practice and it will come,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"I think they (the Bucks coaches) will allow me to shoot 3s.\n\"They just don't want me to think about it. They don't want me to hesitate. They told me, 'If it's an open shot, it's a good shot.' \"\nKidd said Antetokounmpo will have a chance to shoot more threes but also cautioned he should not get caught up in one aspect of his game.\n\"Giannis has the total package,\" Kidd said. \"He doesn't have to be a guy who just shoots perimeter jump shots. He can get to the basket, get to the free-throw line and make plays for his teammates.\n\"It's just a matter of him understanding what can take place because of all the skill sets he has.\"\nKidd said the time Antetokounmpo spent with his national team was productive.\n\"Minutes on the floor; the more he plays basketball the better he's going to get,\" Kidd said. \"He shot the ball extremely well on the perimeter, no matter if it was a three or a two.\n\"And he rebounded the ball. He'll let us know that he had 17 rebounds (vs. Spain).\"\nAntetokounmpo already has seen enough in the first few days of training camp to believe the Bucks will be an improved team.\nAs a rookie he was part of a league-worst Milwaukee team that won just 15 games, but he enjoyed the transformation to a .500 team under Kidd last season.\nWhat's next?\n\"We've got a lot of options now, with Jabari (Parker) back, Greivis (Vasquez), Greg (Monroe),\" Antetokounmpo said. \"We're a versatile team.\n\"My first year was tough. We didn't have much talent. But we still had some good players; we just had injuries.\n\"And from Year 2 to Year 3 we added more talent, so I'm happy with that.\"\nAntetokounmpo averaged 12.7 points and 6.7 rebounds last season and shot 49 percent from the field, and he averaged 12.4 points and 7.5 rebounds in six playoff games against the Chicago Bulls.\nHe said he has several areas to improve and wants to give defenders a few things to think about.\n\"I know in the beginning it will be tougher,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"Most of the guys are not going to come out there (on the perimeter) and guard me because it will be harder for them to guard my drive and my penetration.\n\"But day by day, I'll try to improve that. I'll try to improve my post game because I believe I can do a little bit of everything on the court. Step by step, I want to add little things everywhere: post game, three-point, my penetration, passing and finding my teammates.\"\nAntetokounmpo defended centers at times last season and could play the 5 spot in certain small-ball lineups. He also has handled the ball as a point guard, played at off guard and both forward positions. His normal starting role will be the small forward spot, with Parker opposite him at power forward.\n\"Wherever coach tells me, I just want to get some minutes on the court,\" Antetokounmpo said. \"It's hard to guard big guys like DeAndre (Jordan), Roy Hibbert, guys like that.\n\"Whatever coach tells me to do, I'll do it.\"\n(c)2015 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\nVisit the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel at www.jsonline.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1731712&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1731712", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1731712&h=Bucks%27+Giannis+Antetokounmpo+looking+to+expand+his+perimeter+game"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:56:29.834+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
