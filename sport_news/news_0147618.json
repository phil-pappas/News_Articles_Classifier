Butler, Olean Times Herald Olean Times Herald | 0 comments \nA month ago, the following question was posed in this very space: Can the St. Bonaventure men’s basketball team expect more love from pollsters this season? \nBased on a couple of different factors — the talent it returns from last season, where it’s finished the last few years, the early forecasts from a handful of national outlets and a potentially weaker bottom of the conference — it seemed as though it certainly could. \nIn fact, this appeared to be the year that the Bonnies would be picked somewhere near the middle of the pack rather than near the bottom, where they’ve become accustomed to residing in the preseason. \nGiven the return of an all-conference selection (Marcus Posley), a budding star (Dion Wright) and one of the league’s up-and-coming point guards (Jaylen Adams), they still could — and maybe should — be. \nBut the assumption here is that the loss of redshirt freshman Jordan Tyson to a wrist injury, quite possibly for the season, will definitely affect where they’ll be projected a month from now at Media Day inside Barclays Center. \nAnd maybe that, too, should be the case. \nNo, Tyson hadn’t done anything yet, certainly not enough to influence too greatly how this team will be perceived by the rest of the conference’s media. His absence, however, combined with the loss of all-league center Youssou Ndoye and the lack of both experience and depth create enough concern about the frontcourt to be weary of how the Bonnies as a whole might fare. \nThough coach Mark Schmidt’s team will have to prove it can win with a pair of freshmen forwards shoring up the frontcourt, or by playing small, it should still have enough talent — and the Atlantic 10 is still weak enough at the bottom — to find itself back in the mix of things this winter. \nBut a top-half finish in the league standings won’t be quite as manageable as it appeared to be a month ago, when a seemingly improved Tyson seemed poised to step in and be “the guy” that helped offset the loss of Ndoye in 2015-16. \nAll of those sentiments are reflected in the preseason poll I filled out as an official voting media member a few weeks back (these will be expanded upon as part of the Times Herald’s Bona preview content in early November). \nHere’s how that predicted order of finish shook out: \n1. Dayton — The Flyers return a handful of key players (Dyshawn Pierre, Kendall Pollard, Scoochie Smith) and, most importantly, coach Archie Miller from a team that won 27 games and advanced to the NCAA’s Round of 32 last year. \n2. Davidson — The likes of Jack Gibbs, Brian Sullivan, Jordan Barham and Peyton Aldridge should keep last year’s surprise A-10 team near the top of the league standings again this year. \n3. Rhode Island — The Rams might have the best collection of individual talent in the league, highlighted by a pair of potential first-team selections in E.C. Matthews and Hassan Martin. The question is: can they put it all together this season? \n4. VCU — Though Shaka Smart and key players such as Treveon Graham and Briante Weber are gone, there is still plenty of talent there for new coach Will Wade. \n5. George Washington — The Colonials underwent a bit of a roster makeover, but should be big, experienced and well-coached enough to be a Top 5 Atlantic 10 team this season. \n6. Richmond — A potential darkhorse to contend for the regular season crown, the Spiders return plenty from a team that went 12-6 in league play and won 21 games overall last season, including guard ShawnDre’ Jones and the forward trio of T.J. Cline, Deion Taylor and Terry Allen. \n7. La Salle — The Explorers could well be picked too high here, but they could make a run at a top-half spot behind one of the league’s leading scorers in Jordan Price along with backcourt mates Cleon Roberts and Amar Stukes. \n8. St. Bonaventure — With Posley, Wright and Adams back, the Bonnies should still be good enough to finish in that 7-9 range, even with major question marks in the frontcourt. \n9. Saint Joseph’s — The Hawks boast arguably the league’s best player in junior forward DeAndre Bembry, but will need others to step up if they’re going to improve off last year’s 13-18 campaign. \n10. Massachusetts — UMass loses a lot from last season, including bigs Cady Lalanne and Maxie Esho, and is expected to take a step back in 2015-16. It’s hoping the likes of Trey Davis, Donte Clark and Jabarie Hinds can keep it in the fold. \n11. Duquesne — Will this be the year the Dukes finally make some notable progress under Jim Ferry? They have an experienced backcourt in Derrick Colter, Micah Mason and Jeremiah Jones leading the way. \n12. Saint Louis — The young Billikens have just about everybody back from last year’s team and should be another step closer to competing again under Jim Crews. \n13. Fordham — The Rams lost a potential all-conference player in Eric Paschall and seem to be starting over again under new coach Jeff Neubauer. \n14. George Mason — The Patriots will begin the rebuilding process under former Bucknell head man Dave Paulsen. They have a couple of pieces to work with in all-conference center Shevon Thompson and guards Marquise Moore and Patrick Holloway. \n(J.P.
