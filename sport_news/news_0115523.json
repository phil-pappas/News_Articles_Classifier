He went to the bench, and a few moments later, play was stopped as he was helped going down the tunnel. Flyers players appeared concerned as Raffl exited. \nHextall says Raffl didn’t go to the hospital and is doing better. It’s not known if he’ll miss any games. \nCaptain Claude Giroux described it as a “scary” situation. He added Raffl “looks good now.” Topics:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T05:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T05:06:39.695+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
