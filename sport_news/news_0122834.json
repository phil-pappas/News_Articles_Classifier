It's been . . .underwhelming. The Bulldogs hold a significant advantage in time of possession (18:04 to 11:56) but simply haven't been able to consistently move the ball, much less put it in the end zone. A lot of the issue has been an anemic rushing attack struggling to find an identity without Nick Chubb. Sony Michel went to the locker room during the first half to get a hip bruise checked out, and the 'Dawgs cruised to a spectacular 45 rushing yards on 19 attempts. That's . . . .terrible. If that doesn't improve, I foresee bad things in our future. \nGreyson Lambert has made a couple of absolutely brain-dead decisions but on the stat sheet doesn't look all that bad. He's 13 of 19 for 132 yards, which isn't that bad if you didn't watch the interception he did throw and the one (okay, two) he probably deserved. What was really terrifying for a Bulldog offense that looks like it couldn't score in a women's prison with a pocket full of pardons was Mizzou freshman QB Drew Lock seemingly gaining confidence on the final series of the first half, going 4 of 6 for 74 yards through the air. If that continues, this game could get away from the 'Dawgs. \nIf there's a bright spot, it's that with the exception of that last drive the Bulldog defense has made the Missouri offense look as bad as advertised. The Tigers still have a total of 1 yard rushing. And that's your Bulldog point of pride. Let's kick things off. \nGo 'Dawgs!!!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T04:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T05:20:14.697+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
