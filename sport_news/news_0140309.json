I can't thank her enough.\"The Merrimack tradition is large in the family. Rita Bowman attended Merrimack, and Shaun's older brothers, Mike (2000 graduate) and John (2006 graduate), both played football for the Warriors. Mike's wife and Shaun's sister-in-law, Katelyn, also graduated from there.Shaun, a 2012 Cheshire High grad and Connecticut Governor's Cup All-Star, feels pretty lucky. Throughout his life, all of his siblings — three brothers (Mike, John and Joseph) and two sisters (Kate and Rosemary) — have been right by his side from his Cheshire Youth Football days through high school and to now.\"John has always been like my life coach,\" said Shaun, 21. \"We've always been like best friends. We're 9 years apart in age, but it feels like nine months. It's almost like we're twins, physically and emotionally.\"Shaun Bowman's oldest sibling, Mike, is like a surrogate father to him.\"Over the years, whatever I've needed, Mike has found a way to make it happen,\" said Shaun. \"Now, I am trying to return the favor to see my nephew, Michael Patrick, play.\"Joseph Bowman, now a practicing attorney in Cheshire, has kept tabs on Shaun with the new-age way of things.\"Joey sends me text messages throughout the week and will say he and his wife, Beth, are coming up with their kids and can't wait to see me,\" Shaun said. \"It's the simple, little things. He always says, no matter what, he's proud of me. That means so much to me.\"If Mike is like a surrogate dad, then Shaun's sisters are second mothers to him as well.\"Kate has always been my No. 1 fan and a mother figure to me,\" said Shaun. \"There was one high school game against Fairfield Prep when I was a sophomore and my parents couldn't make it. I don't think I even got in the game, but there was Kate sitting in the rain supporting me. That is something that I will never forget. She and her husband, Carl, are always there for me.\"Rose, a former Cheshire field hockey standout and Quinnipac University Hall of Famer, is a close second to Kate.\"Rosemary just got married, and she and my brother-in-law (Andrew) will be at my game on Saturday at LIU Post,\" said Shaun. \"It's her only day off, but she has said that she would rather see me play than do her own thing.\"Shaun's late grandfather, Ed, never missed an opportunity to see him, either.\"My father and grandfather vetted the work ethic in me; it wasn't something that was preached,\" said Shaun. \"My grandfather taught me so much, and hopefully I can live up to his stature.\" Reach Mark Jaffee at mjaffee@rep-am.com or follow him on Twitter @TheRealJaffman.
