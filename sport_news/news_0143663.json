If we can close the season playing this well, we’re going to be okay.” \nHow close were the Rangers to pulling off the upset? \nRedwood (1-6, 1-2) had a Hail Mary-attempt from the Hanford 38 with three seconds on the clock. The pass fell to the ground a couple of yards shy of the goal line to end the game. \nThis contest was supposed to be a showcase of Hanford’s overall prowess. \nThe Bullpups are ranked No. 7 in CalHiSports.com’s state-wide CIF Division III poll. Hanford entered Friday with a Central Section-leading 45.5 points-per-game scoring average. \nThe Bullpups hardly looked like a team capable of playing for a CIF state bowl championship on Friday. \nHanford had six turnovers — four lost fumbles and two interceptions. \nWhat almost cost Hanford its bid for a perfect season was coughing up the ball three times on lost fumbles in the fourth quarter. \nThe Bullpups’ last two lost fumbles — both forced by impressive play from the Redwood defense —allowed the Rangers to cut Hanford’s 28-14 late fourth-quarter lead to 28-26 with 3:22 remaining in regulation. \nRedwood sophomore Alonzo Ozuna returned one fumble 87 yards for a touchdown. A 65-yard fumble return by Ranger defensive end Patrick Vega set up a five-yard touchdown run by quarterback Frankie Ayon. \nThe 28 points was one off the Bullpups’ season-low (a 27-21 win over Porterville on Sept. 18). \n“Our defense the last two weeks has been absolutely phenomenal,” Ball said. “On offense, we just need to do a better job of executing at key moments. But the defense has been something else. I can’t even explain it. They’ve been after it.” \nDespite its bouts with ineptitude from time to time, Hanford had more than enough offensive firepower to generate four touchdowns, three of them on plays of 39 yards or more. \nHanford junior quarterback Ryan Johnson was 14-of-24 passing for 229 yards and two touchdowns. His scoring passes were an 82-yard bomb to Brandon Sanchez for the Bullpups’ first score and a 39-yard hook-up with Leonard Glass late in the third quarter for their last score. \nBullpup star running back Joseph McDaniel had a game-high 172 yards rushing on 29 carries. His best run of the night was a 52-yard scoring jaunt that tied the game at 14-14 with 8:55 left in the second quarter. \nHanford’s up-tempo, spread offense produced a significant disparity in number of plays and total yards. \nHanford reeled off 81 plays from scrimmage, and Redwood had 52. The Bullpups more than doubled the Rangers’ yardage — 496 to 223. \nStill, there was not a moment in the game where Hanford looked like the superior team without any question. \nRedwood seized a 14-0 lead midway in the first quarter. The Rangers orchestrated a nine-play, 98-yard scoring drive on their first possession — the key play was a 74-yard run by Michael Bean — capped by a two-yard touchdown pass from Frankie Ayon to Brayden Melvin. \nOn the Bullpups’ ensuing possession, Redwood’s Cooper Allen snared a tipped pass and returned the interception 22 yards for a touchdown. \nWhere the Rangers had their troubles was taking advantage of some earlier Hanford miscues. \nIf you were to take away Bean’s long run on Redwood’s first touchdown drive, the Rangers had 34 yards of offense in the first half on 27 plays. \nBean had a team-high 120 yards on 20 carries. Ayon was 9-of-21 passing for 54 yards to go with 51 yards rushing on nine carries. \nHanford", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T09:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T21:55:26.154+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
