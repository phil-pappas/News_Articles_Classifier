Money for these transactions was deposited in the bank accounts of imprisoned drug smuggler’s father. Arrested Assistant Superintendent Karamjit Singh Bhullar allegedly played the role of a facilitator in the transportation and distribution of drugs in the jail, police sources said. Drugs were supplied to the inmates after their relatives deposited money in a specific bank account in the name of jailed smuggler’s father. According to a police investigation, Pargat Singh, who has been undergoing 12-year imprisonment in the Faridkot jail for possessing 10 kg opium, has opened a bank account in the name of his father, Gurdev Singh. The bank account has over 120 entries showing deposition of money from almost all cities and towns of the state, including Mohali, Ludhiana, Bathinda, Jalandhar, Amritsar and Hoshiarpur, over the past 10 months. These “unknown” persons deposited Rs 5,51,725 in the said bank account. The entries vary from Rs 500 to Rs 15,000. Gurdev Singh has reportedly admitted that he does not know these depositors. The police investigation revealed that despite being imprisoned for 12 years, Pargat had been continuing with his drug business within and outside the jail. He sold drugs to fellow inmates at prices much higher than those prevailing in the open market. Faridkot SSP Sukhminder Singh Mann said, “With the interrogation of the arrested assistant jail superintendent, we are hopeful of getting new leads in the case.” A similar racket was unearthed in the Ferozepur central jail recently. Nineteen prisoners had sold drugs worth Rs 23 lakh to fellow inmates.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:32:35.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
