The Ephs return to Farley-Lamb Field this afternoon when Tufts comes a calling. \n\"It feels great. Out of the next four games, we have three at home which is going to be great. It's going to be great to come home to our fans,\" said Williams quarterback Austin Lommen, \"and hopefully get some victories in front of them. \n\"The victory against Bates in front of them was amazing. We're definitely excited to be home.\" \nKickoff for the game is 2 p.m. The only road game Williams has to close out the season is on Nov. 7 at Wesleyan. \n\"Being home is always great,\" said Williams coach Aaron Kelton. \"That's what we talk about is keeping home serve. It's tough going on the road to win football games. \n\"We feel like we gave a game away last week. Guys are excited to be home, but they're just chomping at the bit to play again.\" \nWilliams has been a win-one, lose-one team en route to its .500 record, and are coming off a 36-14 loss at Middlebury. It was a game where Williams had a pair of leads and a chance to go up on the Panthers by two scores. The Ephs couldn't get it accomplished and the host Panthers scored 27 unanswered points to win going away. Advertisement \n\"We're a team of competitors so the two wins feel great, but the two losses are driving us to be better each and every day,\" said Lommen, a senior quarterback. \nAnd for Lommen, that lost opportunity still knaws at him. On the drive in question, the Williams defense forced a fumble inside the Middlebury 30-yard line. Williams went three-and-out and freshman kicker Bobby Webster missed a 38-yard field goal. Three plays later, the Panthers scored on a 71-yard pass play. \n\"Football is a huge game of momentum, so that was a tough blow,\" said Lommen. \"We've been working on those situations in practice. The coaches have been doing a great job preparing us for those situations. \n\"If we're faced with that again, we can execute and take care of it.\" \nThe biggest issue facing the Ephs all season has been the lack of a true running threat. Sophomore tailback Connor Harris might be eighth in the conference in rushing, but he is averaging only 3.6 yards per carry. As a team, Williams has dropped to seventh out of 10 teams with a 2.9 yard-per carry average. That has also impacted the team's total offense, as the Ephs are eighth in the conference in scoring. \n\"It's still a struggle,\" said Kelton. \"We've been doing more with the running game and trying to simplify things for the offensive line to try and help us.\" \nThe Jumbos (3-1), who ended a five-game losing streak to Williams last year, had been hoping to come into the game 4-0. Tufts lost at home to Trinity. The 34-27 overtime loss probably sticks out to coach Jay Civetti's squad like last week's loss to Middlebury does for Williams.
