The unit managed to produce just 65 yards and four first downs in the second half, and redshirt senior quarterback Connor Frazier acknowledged the offense’s troubles after the game. \n“I think we just were kind of shooting ourselves in the foot,” said Frazier, who completed 5-of-6 passes for 34 yards and carried the ball three times for -5 yards in the second half. “We’d get into scoring position, and we’d get a penalty or we’d start the drive with a negative play. Obviously, those are things that we need to fix.” \nDuring his weekly conference call organized by the CAA on Monday afternoon, coach Rob Ambrose wasn’t as pessimistic. He pointed out that Towson had just three meaningful possessions in the last two quarters, and the final drive resulted in a 41-yard field goal by senior kicker Sam Hurwitz. \n“If you look at what we did in the first half, we had [227] yards of offense against a great Villanova team,” Ambrose said. “I’m not real pleased with what we did in the two drives. We had penalties and a bad snap that put us in long downs, really dumb stuff. Once we got our stuff together on the third drive, things started to click again. So I’m not overly concerned in this. What do you do when you’ve made your adjustments and you feel like you’re good to go and then you don’t step onto the field again except for the victory formation? Truth be told, if that’s the case and that’s how we win a ball game, I’ll take it.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T19:05:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T20:34:50.358+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
