Joe Rexrode, Detroit Free Press 8:59 a.m. EDT October 21, 2015 Michigan State running back Delton Williams carried eight times for 15 yards Saturday at Michigan. (Photo: Tony Ding / AP) \nEAST LANSING – The plan was for junior Delton Williams to take a redshirt this season, help Michigan State as much as possible as a vocal presence and get ready to do as much as possible on the field in his final two seasons of eligibility. \nThat ended Oct. 10 at Rutgers after starting running back Madre London went down in the third quarter with what appeared to be a painful leg injury. In part because of the dwindling depth chart and in part because Mark Dantonio said he thought his team needed an emotional spark at the time, he activated Williams. \n\"It was very surprising, but it was just a sacrifice I had to make for my team,\" Williams said Tuesday after practice. \"It's either you're gonna redshirt or you're not. Are you gonna tell coach, 'I don't want to play'? That's not a response you're gonna give your head coach. You came here to play football.\" \nWilliams was speaking publicly for the first time since he was suspended in March for flashing a registered gun in a road-rage incident on campus. He pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor weapons charge in April in East Lansing's 54-B District Court and can have his record cleared in December if he avoids any missteps. Spartans running back Delton Williams talks about taking the field against rival Michigan and how he felt. Video by Joe Rexrode, DFP. \nAn MSU student judicial board determined August as the end of Williams' suspension, but in the time off he fell behind younger backs London, LJ Scott and Gerald Holmes. Now Williams is back in a fight for playing time, at a position he said he intends to continue playing – there has been no talk of a position change. \n\"My mindset is all running back … I feel best in the running back room,\" said Williams, of Erie, Pa. \"They're my brothers. Like tight, tight, real tight.\" \nWilliams' older brother Jaree Warren was shot in the back and killed Dec. 6 in Erie after an incident at a bar, and that and other murders in his hometown prompted Williams to purchase a handgun. He was asked Tuesday what he has learned from his saga. \n\"Just cherish what you've got, because it could be gone tomorrow,\" he said. \"Rest in peace to my brother Jaree. I apologize to anybody that feels like I let them down. But I'm making it right now. I tear up sometimes, I get a little sensitive sometimes when I think about it, because I know where I could be. But life is about battles, you know? So you just keep fighting.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:59:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T17:03:20.429+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
