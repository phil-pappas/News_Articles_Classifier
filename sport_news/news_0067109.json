By Dash Coleman Want to chime in on how local officials should handle the removal of the Interstate 16 flyover in downtown Savannah? Thursday’s your chance.\nThe Metropolitan Planning Commission will hold a Reclaiming Old West Broad Street meeting from 5-7 p.m. Thursday at the Savannah Civic Center. Planners want to showcase proposals for tearing down the Interstate 16 ramp leading into downtown, and they want public input on the project.\nThe general idea of the project is to revitalize Martin Luther King Jr. Boulevard, thinking that the ramp divides the corridor, leaving small businesses without much of a customer base. Beyond removing the ramp, which funnels traffic onto a small one-way section of Montgomery Street, the project aims to restore the grid pattern of roads typical of the rest of downtown.\n“Essentially, we have two concepts, and each concept has two alternatives,” said Tom Thomson, executive director of the MPC.\nImplementation is far off, but what planners need to do now is get approval on a plan and begin the process of a deeper environmental-impact analysis.\nOne proposal involves re-working the ramps that sit over West Gwinnett Street, which, once the Montgomery Street ramp is destroyed, will be one of the main points of entry into downtown Savannah from I-16.\nOther plans include adding a ramp on West Oglethorpe Avenue that would allow traffic\nto flow south from downtown to connect with I-16 rather than just north to South Carolina on the Talmadge Bridge.\n“My guess is before there’s a development-ready block, we’re probably talking seven to 10 years,” Thomson said.\nPlans are to return Montgomery Street to a two-way street after the ramp’s removal.\n“Really, what this means is downtown development will move west,” Thomson said.\nPlanners are still trying to fine tune some funding sources.\nEstimated costs run from $67.3 million to $70.3 million depending on which option is selected.\nIncluded at Thursday’s open meeting will be presentations of travel-time comparisons and 3-D models. There will be time for discussion with the project team.\nIF YOU GO\nWhat: Reclaiming Old West Broad Street informational meeting and discussion.\nWhen: 5-7 p.m. Thursday; presentation at 5:30 p.m.\nWhere: Savannah Civic Center, 301 W.
