England begin a three-match Test series here on Tuesday. Pakistan defeated England 3-0 in 2012.\n\nJames Anderson \nMisbah had said England appear to be weak that 2012, because of the absence of experienced players like batsmen Kevin Pietersen and Jonathan Trott. \"Their spinners back then, Graeme Swann and Monty Panesar, were more experienced and destructive and I feel England are going to miss them,” Misbah wrote in a column for cricket.com.au on Sunday.\nBut Anderson says England are less experienced but not short on quality. \"I wouldn't say we're weaker. I'd say we're less experienced,\" Anderson said. \"The quality and talent that we've got in the side is easily a match for the side that came out here in 2012.\n\"We're fortunate we've got players that have played out here before and can offer experience to those guys that haven't. Hopefully that will stand us in good stead,\" he was quoted as saying by cricket.com.au on Tuesday. Pakistan will play the first Test without batsman Azhar Ali, who has been ruled out due to a foot infection.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:36:23.169+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
