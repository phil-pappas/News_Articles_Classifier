Your eyes aren't playing tricks on you even if you saw all the misses (18) over the weekend, many with the game on the line.\nThat was the case in Indianapolis, where the Jacksonville Jaguars' Jason Myers twice missed a game-winning field-goal attempt, once in regulation and once in overtime. (And that doesn't account for the one he missed at the end of regulation that was nullified by Colts coach Chuck Pagano calling timeout).\nIn Pittsburgh on Thursday night, Josh Scobee missed a pair of field goals in the fourth quarter for the Steelers, who lost to the Baltimore Ravens in overtime.\nThe Philadelphia Eagles lost a three-point game to the Washington Redskins after kicker Caleb Sturgis missed a field goal and an extra point.\nUSA TODAY\nKicking mistakes pile up for NFL teams in Week 4\nRookie Josh Lambo was 3-for-3 for the San Diego Chargers, including the game-winning 34-yarder. But he only got that attempt after a penalty on Cleveland's Tramon Williams erased his miss from 39 yards on the previous play.\nSo it is easy to assume NFL kickers are struggling more than normal. But the reality is that the overall field-goal percentage (83.5%) is currently down only slightly from 2014 (84%). Problem is, kickers have also missed 17 PATs through Sunday, dropping the percentage rate to 94.3% — a dip of 5 percentage points after the rule change this year that moved extra-point tries from 20 to 33 yards.\nIt’s all served to put kickers in the spotlight, perhaps unfairly, two longtime former NFL kickers told USA TODAY Sports.\n“It's not like they’re just shanking them all over the place,” said former Denver Broncos and Atlanta Falcons kicker Jason Elam. “It’s kind of a product of their own doing. They’ve gotten so good over the years, so the public and the coaching staffs, they expect that everything is a gimme. So when you miss some, it’s like, ‘What’s going on?' \"\nElam made 80.7% of his kicks over his 17-year career, made three Pro Bowls and co-owned the record for longest successful field goal (63 yards) until 2013. But it’s a different NFL now, he said, where kickers are expected to be making 85%, if not 90%, of their attempts. Seven full-time kickers finished 2014 making at least 90%.\nUSA TODAY\nShould NFL kickers be lining up longer extra points off hash marks like field goals?\nIllustrating a coach's lack of patience for anything less is the fact several kickers — Scobee, the Redskins' Kai Forbath, Houston Texans' Randy Bullock and Tampa Bay Buccaneers' Kyle Brindza — have already been shown the door.\n“Your weakness will eventually be exposed. And if you don't correct that quickly, there will be a change made, and the change is that you'll be replaced. The NFL has a way of filtering out those that just have a hard time being consistent for an entire season. That's just the way the NFL works,” John Carney, who kicked for eight teams over 23 seasons, told USA TODAY Sports. “Nowadays, they are pulling the trigger pretty quickly on replacing their placekicker, and that's quite shocking to me.\"\nCarney and Elam think Week 4 is a fluke and not a sign of the demise of kickers, though both pointed to the new rule putting more stress on them. It has made kickers spend more time practicing the longer PAT and less on in-game preparation. Several veterans, like the Seattle Seahawks' Steven Hauschka and San Francisco 49ers' Phil Dawson, are among those making sure the longer PAT is spotted at either hash mark, rather than at midfield, to make the try seem more like a field goal.\n“In essence, they turned the extra-point attempt into a field-goal attempt. Their mindset now is field goal, and that's a better mindset for them,” said Carney, who runs the Carney Training Facility near San Diego, where he coaches more than a dozen NFL kickers and punters in the offseason.\n“My interpretation from speaking with my friends in the NFL is they like it because it’s a challenge. The guys that are succeeding and handling the challenge and continuing to be 100% or high-percentage PAT kicker, their value has been increased. Then there are other kickers that are being exposed because, either mentally or physically, they don’t have the right approach. The PATs are not going through and now jobs are on the line.\"\nUSA TODAY\n50 things we learned in Week 4 of the NFL season\nThe other issue is youth. At least 10 kickers, including new Steelers kicker Chris Boswell, are 25 or younger, with less than two seasons of experience.\n“You’ve got to trust your swing. Now more than ever, these guys are outstanding. And even the one who is probably ranked No. 32, he’s still a great, great kicker. So keep your head up, trust what got you here,” Elam said.\n“And for the teams, you scout them in as many pressure situations as you can, do your homework and due diligence on them, and then you stick with them. Over time, if they are as good as you think they are, they’re going to prove it.”\n***\nFollow Lindsay H.
