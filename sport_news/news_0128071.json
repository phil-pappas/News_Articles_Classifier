One thing is certain, though: it should be a fun ride for coach Al Cavagnaro’s bunch.\nThe 16-year coach thought the Spartans had a chance to be good this season, but did he foresee 5-0 good?\n“No,” he said. “I looked at our schedule and saw us playing at Sweet Home, at Grand Island and at Lockport after Niagara Wheatfield. I thought we might be able to get out of that 3-1 on the top side of it.\n“The kids are playing with great confidence. We’ve been behind every game except the last one. We’re on a roll now.”\nA big-time roll might be more accurate.\nThe Spartans are 5-0 for the first time since 1991, a season in which they opened 5-0-1. They have already clinched a playoff berth with two weeks to spare. They are in contention to win their first division title since 1989, when they won the old Niagara-Orleans League championship.\nThey have exorcised some demons along the way, too, beating Sweet Home for the first time and following that with first-ever road wins at Grand Island and Lockport. Heck, the triumph over Lockport was the Spartans’ first over the rival Lions since 2008.\nThe seeds for this year’s success were planted last season. Starpoint started six sophomores, who helped the Spartans reach the playoffs for the third time in four seasons. The Spartans lost a tough one to eventual Section VI Class A runner-up South Park, 20-12, in the quarterfinals – a road game in which they gave the Sparks all they could handle – while starting their then-backup (now starting) quarterback Adam Lasal.\n“I think that was the point and time our kids realized they could play with anybody,” Cavagnaro said.\nThat mentality would be useless without work ethic and talent. Cavagnaro said his crew had at least 30 players show up for each weightlifting session during the team’s offseason program.\nThen there’s the talent. Starpoint has a wealth of riches in the backfield with two juniors and a sophomore spearheading a rushing attack that’s scored 20 touchdowns, averaging nearly 300 yards per game.\nJunior Tajay Ahmed, who is in his third season, has been the workhorse – rushing 54 times for 506 yards and six TDs. Sophomore fullback Anthony Robinson has a team-high 516 yards and seven touchdowns on 35 carries. Junior Terry Rutland has rushed 50 times for 288 yards and six touchdowns. He also has three touchdowns on special teams. Lasal is back at QB but missed last week’s game with an undisclosed injury. Freshman Adam Chase, who has guided the JV to an unbeaten mark this season, filled in during the 67-0 rout of Kenmore East in which the Spartans set a team record for points in a game.\nStill, it’s the three-headed rushing attack of Ahmed, Robinson and Rutland that fuels this offense. Having viable options is beautiful thing.\n“I’ve had some fabulous tailbacks who have set school records … but the better teams that we’ve played have been able to key in on him,” Cavagnaro said. “Now with all the options we’ve got, we’re forcing teams to play sideline to sideline and the length of the field against us. That’s the difference.”\nWhile seniors Sam Wray, Zach Farrell and Matt Cross anchor the line, three key underclassmen who receive regular time include sophomore Mike Parisse, Kyle Schreader and Jake Kiff.\nUnfortunately for Starpoint, it does not face Williamsville North in the regular season due to the fact there are nine teams in Class A North yet only six league games on the docket for each squad. Should both teams finish tied atop standings that means point differential will likely be the tiebreaker used to determine the division champion.\nShould Starpoint run the table only to place second in its division via tiebreaker, it is something that won’t irritate Cavagnaro and with good reason.\n“We did everything we could to control that,” he said. “We really can’t control what North does.”\nNot so sweet year\nDefending Class A champion Sweet Home is mathematically alive for the postseason but realistically needs a lot to fall into place – winning out and hoping for a favorable tiebreaker scenario – for it to sneak into the playoffs with hopes of reaching The Ralph for a 10th straight season.\nThe last time the Panthers (1-4, 1-3 in Class A North) failed to make the Section VI playoffs was 2000. When was the last really bad season for Sweet Home? That 0-8 run in 2000?\n“I was there, I don’t forget stuff like that,” said longtime coach John Faller, who has guided the Panthers to two state titles and three championship game appearances at the Carrier Dome. “It’s been a while. You get through it.”\nStill, this season has been a jolt to Sweet Home’s system. The Panthers have already lost as many games this season as it did the previous three combined. A combination of youth adjusting to the speed and physicality of the varsity game and other teams in Class A North being really good have contributed to Sweet Home’s off year.\n“These kids aren’t used to losing,” said Faller, who has guided the Panthers to playoffs 14 straight seasons. “It’s been quite a challenge for us to get ourselves back up week by week. The kids want to win and so does everybody else out there playing. When you lose it’s a setback but we have to keep going. It’s a whole season. You just can’t play three games and say that’s enough. You have to go through the whole season.”\nSchmidt to Indiana Wesleyan\nHolland soccer star Olivia Schmidt will take her talents to Indiana Wesleyan, an NAIA and Christian school in Marion, Ind.\n“When I went there it just felt like home,” said Schmidt for picking the Division II school. “I love the coach and the program. I think it’s on the rise. I just think we’re going to do really good things the four years I’m there.”\n“The school has spent a lot of money upgrading its facilities and campus,” said Schmidt’s coach and father, George. “The Christian atmosphere was something she was interested in as well.”\nShe picked Schmidt over Houghton – the alma mater of her parents, Division II Edinboro and Division I St. Bonaventure.\nOlivia said she’s just focusing on soccer her first year. After that, she’ll evaluate if she has time to play basketball there, too. The school has expressed interest in her talents for both sports. She has recorded 162 goals and 109 assists on the pitch. In basketball, she’s poured in 1,720 career points.\nemail: mrodriguez@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T23:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:34:31.888+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
