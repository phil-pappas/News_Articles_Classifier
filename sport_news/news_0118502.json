Australia progressed from Group D with four points, losing 4-1 to Germany, drawing goalless with Mexico and edging Argentina 2-1. According to the Nigeria Football Federation, Amuneke described the Aussies as a very good side who must be respected. “We have been looking forward to the team we are going to play and today (Sunday), we realized it would be Australia. At this stage, everybody that has qualified must be respected,” explained Amuneke to the Nigeria Football Federation.“They (Australia) are a very good side because we saw their match against Argentina; they are a very good side and we have to respect them.” Amuneke insisted that they will continue to work hard with the hope that all the players will be in the right frame of mind ahead of Wednesday’s clash. “We have to keep working hard and prepare our players physically and psychologically for the match (against Australia) especially after losing our last group match to Croatia. We have to let the players realize that the stage we are in now is crucial and it needs high level of concentration from them. “It is a welcome development (Eaglets versus Australia) and before Wednesday, we would evaluate our players and see their state of mind but hopefully, all of them would be ready to play on Wednesday,” Amuneke assured.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T18:32:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T19:18:17.528+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
