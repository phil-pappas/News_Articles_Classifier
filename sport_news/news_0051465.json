Mayor Jackson, your leadership has brought this city to the brink of no return!”\n“I think that the mayor has more important things to worry about than some kids burning her sign and saying ‘ dnaaa.’”\n“I live in Ardsley Park and I really feel safer at night with the new LED street lights.”\n“What are we paying the police for? They don’t do anything about the shootings; they don’t enforce the laws. What are we paying them to do other than drive around in our cars?”\n“Why watch ‘American Horror Story’ when we have the Savannah Morning News? Every morning, another horror story.”\n“Tybee politics is super complicated. You need to live on Tybee and get to know most of the political players on both sides, especially those behind the scenes, before opening your mouth and exposing your brain.”\n“Do something officials! Can’t we at least have ‘sting’ operations with undercover police walking around the city?”\nContribute to Vox Populi by calling 912-525-0VOX (0869) or emailing us at vox@savannahnow.com .
