DOUG BENC, CONTRIBUTING PHOTOGRAPHER Related article » REDLANDS – San Bernardino Cajon’s defense entered Citrus Valley’s Hodges Stadium with a swagger in its step, an aura of fearlessness, and an attitude that said it wasn’t going to be intimidated by Redlands East Valley’s prolific offense.\nThe Cowboys took that onto the field, and used it to pull off one of the biggest upsets in program history.\nCajon picked off four passes and battered the Wildcats from the start, and the result was a stunning 37-17 victory to vault the Cowboys into a tie for first place in the Citrus Belt League.\n“We weren’t going to play them scared like so many other teams do,” senior defensive tackle Mikael Bunse said. “It’s our 11 guys vs. their 11 guys, and we know ours are better.”\nCajon (7-1, 4-1) limited REV (6-2, 4-1) to a season-low 285 yards and surrendered only one offensive touchdown. Bunse and Johnny Lomelli both returned interceptions for touchdowns, and George Hicks and Elijah Lilly added interceptions in the third quarter to force All-Area REV quarterback Armando Herrera to the bench.\nThe Cowboys are tied with REV and Redlands for first place in the CBL with two games remaining.\n“We came into this game excited,” said Lomelli, a senior cornerback. “This was for our season, and we were excited to play.”\nCajon held REV to 49 yards and one first down in the first half and led 3-0 at halftime before blowing it open in the third quarter.\nThe Cowboys stuffed Wildcats running back Joey Harman on fourth down at the 18-yard line on the opening drive, and two plays later quarterback Jayden Daniels hit Phillip Ryan down the right sideline for a 79-yard touchdown.\nAfter a REV field goal made it a one-possession game once again, Daniels marched Cajon 80 yards for another touchdown to make it 16-3 Cowboys.\nOn REV’s first offensive play after the touchdown, the 280-pound Bunse jumped up and snatched Herrera's pass out of mid-air and rumbled 23 yards for a touchdown, sending Cajon’s sideline and stands into a frenzy while REV’s fell silent.\nHicks and Lilly ended REV’s next two possessions with interceptions, and Lomelli added a pick-six with 34 seconds left to finish it.\n“We just got beat. We got beat bad,” Wildcats coach Kurt Bruich said. “Cajon is a good team. Just gotta take your hats off to them.”\nContact the writer: kglaser@pe.com", "external_links": ["http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpq07-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp594.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpq08-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp59a.10.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpq07-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp598.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpq08-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp59a.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpq07-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp594.10.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpq05-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp58q.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpq06-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp592.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpq05-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp58s.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpq06-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp592.10.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpq06-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp590.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpq07-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp598.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpq05-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp58u.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpq05-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp58s.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpq05-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp58u.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpq04-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp58o.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nwpq05-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp58q.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpq04-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp58o.10.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nwpq06-b88543079z.120151023235517000gmmcp590.10.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T17:15:56.915+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
