Peterson landed a hard body shot, then grazed Oliver on the head.Oliver went down on his knees, waited for the 10 count and walked away with a paycheck and boos from the sparse crowd. \nSEE ALSO: LOVERRO: Lamont Peterson hopes to start winning again near where it all began \nIt was boxing larceny, but it would hardly be the only or worst crime of the day in Fairfax, a bad day for boxing in Northern Virginia. \n“I don’t know if it was enough to put him down, but it was enough to keep him from getting up,” Peterson said. \nThen Peterson tore out a page from the classic work about the brutality and corruption of boxing —“The Harder They Fall”— and testified. \n“Boxing, I don’t know why people call it a sport,” said Peterson , who called himself a boxing fan. “It’s not a sport. This is like organized crime. Where else in the history of sports where you see people around the ring and people beating the crap out of each other?” \nBudd Schulberg couldn’t have written it any better. \nThere was crime in the ring, but it was hardly organized. The afternoon took a tragic turn a few fights later with undefeated Puerto Rican prospect Prichard Colon taking a bad enough beating from his opponent, Terrel Williams — a beating that, for all intents and purposes, was against the rules of this organized crime — that resulted in him vomiting and passing out in his locker room after the fight. \nHe was taken from the arena on a stretcher to Inova Fairfax Hospital, where he reportedly underwent surgery Saturday afternoon for bleeding on the brain. He was listed in critical condition on Sunday. \nThe Williams-Colon fight was a nationally televised embarrassment. Williams repeatedly grabbed Colon behind the head and targeted it for one blow after another. Colon kept complaining in the ring to referee Joe Cooper, who did little about it. \nFrom where I sat ringside, I don’t know if his corner — he is trained by his father, Richard Colon — complained to Cooper between rounds. If they did, they didn’t make their case forcefully enough, because it was a pattern throughout the fight. In the seventh round, Cooper deducted a point from Williams for the punches to the back of the head. Earlier in the fight, Cooper had taken two points away from Colon for an intentional low blow. \nIn the ninth round, Williams knocked Colon down twice, the second time just before the end of the round. There was so much confusion in Colon’s corner that it began taking the gloves off the fighter — not because they were throwing in the towel to end the fight, but because they clearly believed it had been the 10th round, the end, and not the ninth. \nWhy? Maybe because there were no ring card girls. Seriously, you don’t know how much you miss such a frivolous sideshow until it’s gone. How hard can it be to find some exotic dancers in Fairfax? \nColon’s cornermen attempted to hurry up and put his gloves back on, but the fighter was clearly in trouble and too much time had passed for Cooper, who disqualified Colon and awarded the fight to Williams, undefeated with a 15-0 mark.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:07:22.735+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
