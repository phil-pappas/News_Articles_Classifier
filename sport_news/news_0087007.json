(AP) By Michael Tunison \nChiefs running back Jamaal Charles left in the second half of the team's game against the Bears and is listed as out. Jamaal Charles is out for the remainder of today's game with a knee injury after this play. #CHIvsKC http://t.co/SI2WVXcx8C - NFL (@NFL) October 11, 2015 \nCharles went to the ground awkwardly after taking a cut on a carry in the red zone. He had to be helped off the field by a teammate and a coach. \nAs the announcer notes, non-contact injuries have a tendency to be among the worst, suggesting an ACL tear. Though he does list the example of Arizona's Andre Ellington leaving a game after a similar situation earlier this season and escaping a season-ending injury. \nThe NFL's Ian Rapaport had a more grim report. The immediate fear is that #Chiefs RB Jamaal Charles tore his ACL, source says, based on initial tests. He'll have an MRI to learn more. - Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) October 11, 2015 \nCharles had torn his ACL in the 2011 season and missed all but two games. \nOn Sunday, Charcandrick West stepped in for the injured back, who had rushed for 364 yards on the season before he was removed from the game. \n*** \nMike Tunison is a freelance writer based in Alexandria, Va.
