Marion High School's football team took care of business in the state capital Saturday — the Wildcats met the Rich South Stars from suburban Chicago halfway in Springfield and rolled to a 57-14 victory to seal a sixth win and 11th straight postseason berth — then came home to learn that their first-round playoff opponent is a familiar one. Marion (6-3) will travel to Centralia (8-1) in a Class 5A opening round game with a chance to avenge the season's most bewildering loss — an eight-point setback on homecoming and Senior Night that even included an extra untimed down with a bonus chance to tie the game. The Wildcats not only avoided a long trip in the first round — perhaps karma rewarding them for all the miles they've logged during the season — but will host either Normal or Peoria in the second round should they beat the Orphans. But first, they had to ground a Rich South team that had just one win but had been playing well recently. Marion used three different quarterbacks and got basically everyone on the roster on the field in the rout that officially gave the Wildcats the longest active playoff streak in Southern Illinois. \"Eleven years is a big deal,\" said Marion coach Kerry Martin, who is in his 14th year with the school. \"You have to earn your way in. That's a big deal. It's not easy. You set a goal at the beginning of the season and you want to be a part of the postseason and give yourself a chance to play an extra week or two or three. \"Our kids stepped up and did a really good job all year long of facing a tough schedule, playing a lot of road games far away and still getting enough wins to get in the playoffs. I'm proud of them.\" Playing the Stars at Sacred Heart-Griffin's field for the second straight year, the Wildcats jumped out early after forcing a punt. Braden Ziegler scored on a short touchdown run after junior Hunter Milligan caught a 59-yard reception from starting quarterback Izak Baker. After another punt, Milligan caught another long pass from Baker, this time for 34 yards, to set up a short TD pass from Baker to fullback Tommy Wilson. And in the second quarter, Baker found fellow senior Seth Bayer over the middle for a 37-yard touchdown after Jaden Lacy made the first of his two interceptions. Milligan, who also had an interception later in the second quarter and has been a defensive force all season, certainly stood out with his offensive contributions in the opening stanza. \"We felt like he was going to be a weapon,\" Martin said. \"He focused on defense for a while but people don't realize what a good receiver he can be. He can go up and get it. He's a real weapon. We're glad he'll be back next year.\" Page 2 of 2 - Marion's lead was 22-0 before the the Stars got on the board with Michael Keys Jr.'s 92-yard kickoff return. Baker left the game with a foot injury at the 9:34 mark of the second quarter and his replacement, Jacob Schmid, threw a 15-yard touchdown to Ziegler on his first play. Schmid also scored on a 5-yard run after Lacy scored on a run of his own and Milligan made his interception. \"I don't know how serious it is,\" Martin said of Baker's injury. \"I certainly didn't feel like there was any need to put him back in the game at that point. Jake came in and did a great job so we'll just have to wait and see what happens.\" Before the half was over, Lacy intercepted another pass and returned it 75 yards for a touchdown to put Marion up 50-6 going into halftime. \"I think last year we had five or six interceptions and this year again the turnovers were a big deal,\" Martin said. \"You like to see kids take chances and play the ball.\" Rich South scored in the second half on a pass from Tyler Sudduth to Trenton Sudduth, but the Wildcats capped the scoring with the sophomore unit on the field. Malcom Berry gave the Wildcats possession with yet another interception, then caught a 63-yard touchdown pass from David Fletcher to make it 57-14 with 2:07 remaining on the clock that ran continuously in the entire second half. A blatant late hit on kicker Mitchell Wilkie on the extra point couldn't dampen the Wildcats' joy as they knew their season would continue another week. \"Our screen game was really good because they brought a lot of pressure,\" Martin said. \"Then they stopped bringing pressure, which allowed the passing game to hit some open receivers down the field. So the game plan was well executed by the kids and we got a lot of effort from a lot of different guys today.\" By Justin Walker   Justin Walker", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T08:19:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T16:50:07.731+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
