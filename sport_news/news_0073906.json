The establishment, at 208 S. Green Street in Sonora, will open its doors to the public at 3 p.m. Thursday, and will be open from 3 p.m. to close Friday and Saturday for its official grand opening. “After months of hard work, The Bourbon Barrel is pleased to open our doors to the community of Sonora,” said Doug Kennedy, general manager of The Bourbon Barrel. “Today marks the completion of the first of four planned phases for downtown in which we will deliver outdoor dining and entertainment, live music, and other soon-to-be-revealed plans. It’s our goal to offer patrons numerous reasons to revisit downtown to enjoy this great area.” The business offers 122 different types of bourbon as well as a selection of local wines, craft beers and spirits. Bourbons include renowned Pappy Van Winkle (10-year, 12-year, 15-year, 20-year and 23-year) as well as other small-batch Kentucky bourbons found nowhere else in the Western states. The bar also features a food menu with taste of the South and a hint of California mountain cuisine, stated a press release. The bar and lunch spot is owned by Kennedy and his friend, Malachi Burns, both of Sonora, who make up Trado Restaurant Corp. It’s their first joint venture. Burns is known for his family’s ownership of The Europa in downtown Sonora, where he was a bartender for many years, and Kennedy is known locally for his ownership of Reverb Communications and the now shuttered Sierra Mountain Times newspaper in Twain Harte. Business hours will be 3 p.m. to close seven days a week.
