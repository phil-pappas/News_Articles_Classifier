What a coincidence that would be given how Anfield just sacked Brendan Rodgers on October 4th. \nMany of the British tabloids have already written the “Mourinho sacked if Chelsea lose on Halloween” story, but is this trick-or-treat? Doesn’t it seem a bit ridiculous that his job status would/could/might be determined by just one match?

Should Mourinho be sacked, the speculation on his replacement centers around Carlo Ancelotti and Pep Guardiola. Of course, there would be a caretaker manager in place in the interim until the Mourinho replacement would be found.
