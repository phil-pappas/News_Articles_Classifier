In a Deseret News article shortly after his retirement at age 81, Kramer said he would come to Bonneville every day from sunup until sundown even in the winter when he would use a blade on the front of his Jeep to clear the snow.\n“It’s been my home all these years,’’ he said. “I’ve enjoyed it so much.’'\nAs a player, Kramer won several tournaments around the Intermountain region, including the Provo Open, the Brigham City Open and the City Parks Open. In 1998, he was inducted into the Utah Golf Hall of Fame.\nA celebration of Kramer’s life will be held Wednesday at noon at Wasatch Lawn Mortuary (3401 S. Highland Drive). Friends and family are invited to meet from 10 to 11 a.m. Kramer is survived by one son, eight grandchildren and 28 great-grandchildren.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:57:44.976+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
