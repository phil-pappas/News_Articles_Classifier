FBI experts say the attempts haven’t had much success, but Congress is concerned enough to hold hearings on the topic this morning in Washington.\n\"Strong intent. Thankfully, low capability,\" said John Riggi, a section chief at the FBI's cyber division told a conference of utility cybersecurity experts last week. \"But the concern is that they'll buy that capability.\"\nEarth Bloomed Early\nPlay Video Hackers And Your Data We hear stories every day, it seems, about penetrations of computer networks. These breaches grow costlier with each new hack. Who are these cyber criminals and how do they use our data? ThinkStock The FBI worries that terrorists can purchase black market malware or destructive software from the same organized crime groups that commit financial fraud by stealing credit cards or bank account information.\nAmerican energy infrastructure, including power plants, transmission and distribution lines, oil and gas pipelines, and transformers and substations remain vulnerable to cyber-attack, according to a report by the House Science Committee last month.\nAntibiotic Genes Found in Mummy\nOver the past five years, utilities have been rolling out components of the so-called “smart grid,” which allows more information to flow between customers and energy providers, but also includes more entry points for possible hackers.\nFor example, while the smart-grid has made it easier to read meters either remotely or by driving through a neighborhood, it also means that the Internet connection between consumer and utility is more open to attacks.\nConvenience and efficiency can lead to more security problems, according to Jason Christopher, senior lead technical leader of cybersecurity for the Electric Power Research Institute.\nCould Our Power Grid Ever Fail?\n\"There will be more trajectories to attack,” he said.\nA USA Today investigation earlier this year found that the United States power grid “faces physical or online attacks approximately ‘once every four days.’”\nPage 1 / 2 Previous / Next Tags Electricity Smart Grid hacking Hackers Isis Cybercrime Current Events ", "external_links": ["http://static.ddmcdn.com/en-us/news/js/ad9f4f9-1ca3333.js", "http://static.ddmcdn.com/gif/russian-hackers-steal-1-billion-passwords-250x150.jpg", "http://malsup.github.com/jquery.form.js", "http://ebm.cheetahmail.com/r/regf2", "http://static.ddmcdn.com/en-us/news/img/video-icon.png", "https://discovery.csharmony.epsilon.com/Account/Register?b=news"], "published": "2015-10-21T21:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:39:25.620+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
