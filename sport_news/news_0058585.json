And three signatures.\nAnd get this: the third could come from the Canadian Centre for Ethics in Sport, the same organization Orridge slammed the door on earlier this season.\nYou may recall how Orridge reacted to criticism from the CCES and the head of the Quebec lab it contracted by shutting down the program altogether, June 11.\nWell, it seems the commish may have come to his senses and realized the CCES was the best thing going for the toothless policy he inherited.\nBecause word is the CCES is back at the table, although nobody was confirming as much, Tuesday.\nNotable: they weren’t denying it, either.\n“I’m not able to comment on what you’re hearing,” CCES president/CEO Paul Melia said, via e-mail.\nIf the CCES is back as a partner, the league stands a good chance of getting this right. Finally.\nThe organization and the head of its lab, Dr. Christiane Ayotte, have long tried to get the CFL to get tougher on drug cheats.\nIts policy was the weakest in pro sports, with no sanction for first-time offenders and no independent management of its test results.\nWhen graduating Canadian university players began taking advantage of it — five of them failed drug tests at the pre-draft combine last spring, knowing they’d face no penalties as pros — the alarm bells went off.\nEverybody heard them — except for Orridge and players association boss Scott Flory, apparently.\nLeading player agent Darren Gill and University of Manitoba Bisons head coach Brian Dobie called for the league to act, while Ayotte said her lab could no longer in good conscience do the league’s testing.\nEven the head of the World Anti-Doping Agency called the league on the carpet.\nSo the CFL took its ball and went south, trying to find another agency and lab to administer the program, at the same time promising to improve it.\nWhen the only other two WADA-approved labs in North America turned the CFL down, it had little choice but to consider re-binding the ties it cut with the CCES.\nWe’ll see what they come up with.\n“I’ve got my fingers crossed,” Dobie said, Tuesday, calling the CFL the “final frontier” in the fight against performance-enhancing drugs in football. “That’s the last thing missing.”\nWhich brings us to the Grey Cup, which had been missing a critical element just seven weeks ago: paying customers.\nAfter being forced to reveal they’d downsized the capacity from 40,000 to 36,634, yet still had some 11,000 tickets to sell, the Winnipeg Blue Bombers have seen a surge in sales, relatively speaking.\nA check with Ticketmaster showed just over 2,000 tickets remained as of mid-afternoon, Tuesday, all but ensuring the game will be a sellout.\nChecking with the Bombers didn’t reveal any particular reason, just “increased demand and strong response from the business community of late,” read an e-mail from the communications department.\nIt’ll still be the smallest Grey Cup crowd in 17 years.\nBut at least the Bombers will be spared the embarrassment of having thousands of empty seats at a venue that was already downsized.\nNow who says you never read positive news in this space?\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nPAUL FRIESEN\nCFL close to a solution on drug testing\nBy Paul Friesen , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 08:43 PM EDT | Updated: Tuesday, October 13, 2015 11:26 PM EDT\nThe CFL with a strong, working drug policy and a sold-out Winnipeg Grey Cup?\nBoth, believe it or not, appear sure things.\nLet’s start with the drug policy.\nIt was back on July 2 when CFL commissioner Jeffrey Orridge made his first trip to Winnipeg, looked me in the eye and said he’d have the league’s mess of a program fixed within weeks, “at most.”\nMore than three months later, we’re still waiting.
