Houston took a 6-2 lead into the eighth, but a tough error charged to the 21-year-old rookie keyed the Royals' comeback to even the matchup at two games apiece. \nGame 5 will be back in Kansas City on Wednesday night. \nLate in the game, a tweet from the account of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott congratulated the Astros on advancing to the AL Championship Series.

The ball took two more hops and glanced off the top of Correa's mitt, rolling into center field as two runs scored to tie it at 6. \nAlex Gordon's RBI groundout off Luke Gregerson later in the inning put Kansas City ahead. \nHosmer launched a long, two-run homer in the ninth for insurance. \nRyan Madson (1-0) allowed two runs in the seventh and still got the win. Wade Davis pitched two scoreless innings for his second save.
