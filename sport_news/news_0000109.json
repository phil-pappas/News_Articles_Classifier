Show Caption Previous Next \nAnajae Stephney might have been late to the recruiting scene, but her standout performance in last season's Class AAA girls basketball state tournament generated enough buzz to make up for it. \nOn Tuesday, the all-state center from Bearden High School parlayed that momentum, which continued on the summer AAU circuit, into a future in Division I basketball. \nStephney, a 6-foot-2 senior, committed to East Tennessee State, choosing the Buccaneers over scholarship offers from Southern Illinois and Tennessee Tech. Stephney also considered Middle Tennessee State, which showed heavy interest. \n\"The state tournament was when I started getting noticed,\" Stephney said on Wednesday. \"... And I liked the vibe that I got from (ETSU). I kind of felt like home.\" \nStephney averaged 12 points and nine rebounds for Bearden last season, but found another gear in the Class AAA state tournament in Murfreesboro. \nShe averaged 19 points and 9.5 rebounds in two games, showcasing her potential as she earned all-state tournament and, later, Class AAA all-state honors. \nShe played with the well-regarded Murfreesboro Flight Silver this summer before zeroing in on her recruitment. \n\"I think she would admit it was a little bit of a whirlwind from March on,\" Bearden coach Justin Underwood said. \"She kind of burst onto the scene. With her season-ending knee injury as a sophomore, she was new to recruiters. She played her best the last three weeks of last season. That was kind of a springboard.\" \nWith her recruitment over, Stephney said she's focused on improving her jump shot and becoming more aggressive at the basket. \n\"I think they like that I'm versatile,\" Stephney said. \"They want me as a four. They like that I can play with my back to the basket, but they also want me out on the perimeter.\" Copyright 2015 Journal Media Group. All rights reserved.
