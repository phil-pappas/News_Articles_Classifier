After their first two games, it’s fair to ask, who was the professor?\nAfter a sloppy season-opening loss, the Kings unwittingly doubled down on their mistakes Friday night in a mostly dreadful 4-1 loss to Arizona in front of 18,230 at Staples Center.\nThe Kings trailed 4-0 less than seven minutes into the second period, and things got so rough that fans gave a mock cheer when goalie Jonathan Quick made a pedestrian save. Quick allowed a couple uncharacteristically soft goals, but also didn’t get much help from teammates.\n\"It's real early in the season. We know the group we have in here and we're not panicking,\" Tyler Toffoli said.\nAdded Drew Doughty:� \"We just need to clean some things up and start winning some hockey games.\"\nThrough two games, the Kings have looked disjointed on defense, perhaps not stunning given that during training camp, injuries and illness often prevented the Kings from practicing with their normal pairs.\nStill, defensive veterans such as Jake Muzzin and Christian Ehrhoff have struggled, and center Jordan Weal, in his first NHL game, had an offensive-zone turnover that led directly to a Coyotes goal.\nZbynek Michalek, Oliver Ekman-Larsson, Max Domi and Tobias Rieder scored for the Coyotes. The Kings showed some life after they faced a four-goal deficit and even scored a shorthanded goal.\nLate in the second period, Jeff Carter had a breakaway, and Coyotes goalie Mike Smith made a sprawling save, but Tyler Toffoli scored on the rebound. Toffoli led the NHL last season with five shorthanded goals.\nPerhaps sensing trouble early, Kings coach Darryl Sutter shuffled his lines less than five minutes into the game, which led to an interesting combination of Kyle Clifford with Carter and Toffoli.\nIt also meant a bigger than expected role for Weal, who made his debut after being a healthy scratch in the opener. Weal, 23, didn’t record a point or a shot on goal.\nIt’s been a slow, steady rise for Weal, a 2010 third-round Kings draft pick who had consecutive 20-goal seasons in the AHL, then had a major breakthrough in the playoffs for Manchester last spring.\nWeal had 10 goals and 12 assists in 22 playoff games, which raised hopes that he might be able to score at the NHL level. Weal can play center and wing but given his size (5-foot-10, 179 pounds), he likely needs to be able to thrive in a top-six forward role, because he’s not going to be a grinding, physical forward.\nThe Kings made a more surprising lineup move when they inserted Brayden McNabb in place of Jeff Schultz. A day earlier, after practice, Coach Darryl Sutter lamented McNabb’s poor training camp.\nLong term, though, the Kings need McNabb. He’s younger and more versatile, with more all-around talent, and if effective he could form a successful partnership with Christian Ehrhoff.\nThe new mix didn’t work, though. The poor season-opening loss came to a San Jose team that should contend for the playoffs, but the young Coyotes are expected to be in ``building’’ mode this season.\nThe Coyotes, playing their season opener, scored on their first shot on goal of the season, exactly two minutes into the game. They also received some good fortune, as Michalek’s shot from the right circle deflected off the stick of Kings forward Nick Shore and wobbled over Quick’s shoulder.\nArizona scored again with 48 seconds remaining in the first period, then scored goals 1:53 apart early in the second period.\nBUDAJ SIGNED\nThe Kings signed veteran goalie Peter Budaj to a one-year contract. If Budaj clears waivers Saturday morning, he will be assigned to the AHL and essentially will be the Kings’ No. 3 goalie.\nContact the writer: rhammond@ocregister.com\nRelated: Kings, Richards reach settlement on termination grievance", "external_links": ["http://www.ocregister.com/articles/richards-686853-kings-settlement.html"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T13:34:37.652+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
