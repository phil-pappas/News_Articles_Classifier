As a striker you always want to score more goals, you can never be satisfied,\" said Lewandowski.\nBayern's Germany forward Thomas Mueller is just as enthusiastic.\n\"It's a summit meeting of the country's best. The whole of Germany's football community will be looking in our direction with great excitement on Sunday,\" said Mueller.\nIt seems ridiculous to suggest, but the title race could effectively be as good as over should Bayern finish the weekend seven points clear if they beat Borussia and third-placed Schalke fail to beat Cologne at home.\nThe Bavarians have won the German league title by at least 10 points in each of the last three seasons and only dropped points after each of their title wins had been confirmed.\nEven Dortmund's CEO Hans-Joachim Watzke has said while Borussia can beat Bayern in individual matches, he doubts they can realistically challenge Pep Guardiola's star-studded squad over the season.\n\"Of course, we have a chance to beat Bayern in selective matches, but over the course of 34 games currently no one in Germany -- and probably no one in Europe -- could deny this unbelievable quality,\" said Watzke.\nWith ageing injured wingers Arjen Robben and Franck Ribery currently sidelined, Brazil's Douglas Costa and France Under-21 star Kingsley Coman have cemented their places on Bayern's flanks.\n\"We are in good form and on the right path,\" said Guardiola.\n\"We're playing much better, we can play wider and our strikers have more chances.\"\nBayern prepared for the Dortmund clash by sipping from frothy mugs at Munich's bumper beer festival Oktoberfest on Wednesday.\nIn contrast, Dortmund rested stars Mats Hummels, Shinji Kagawa, Sokratis and Ilkay Gundogan for their 1-1 Europa League draw against PAOK in Greece on Thursday.\nDortmund's top scorer Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang also sat out the trip to Greece and a sub-plot of Sunday's clash will pit goal-machine Lewandowski against the man who replaced him in Dortmund.\nBetween them the pair have scored 19 league goals this season, while Aubameyang has netted in each of Dortmund's seven Bundesliga games.\nBefore the clash in Munich, third-placed Schalke, who start the weekend a point behind Dortmund, need to beat Cologne at home on Sunday to stay in touch with the leaders.\nAfter their respective midweek Champions League defeats to Manchester City and United, Borussia Moenchengladbach and Wolfsburg clash at Borussia-Park on Saturday.\nGladbach's caretaker coach Andre Schubert is chasing his third straight league win as the hunt to find Lucien Favre's replacement goes on.\nFixtures (all times 1330 GMT unless stated)\nPlaying Friday\nDarmstadt v Mainz 05 (1830)\nSaturday\nBor.
