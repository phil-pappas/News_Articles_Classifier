It's something that's been valued in startups for a long time, and in high-growth markets, the bar for meaningful traction is quickly being raised. \nIn late-2014, I recruited my co-founder, Jackson Noel, and together we raised $1.2M to accelerate the growth of the world's first user onboarding platform, Appcues. Today, we power the onboarding for over 13 million people every month. \nBut to get to that point, I had spent the previous year solo, selling and building the core product myself. I was taking no salary and had saved up $20,000 of my own money to pay the bills. \nDuring that pre-funded year, I picked up several great lessons from our process of building a minimum viable product (as explained in the lean startup methodology ) and quickly getting startup traction. First, make a proto-MVP \nOur first MVP was an animated GIF. \nI recorded a GIF of a clickable prototype I had on my computer that I built with HTML in an afternoon. Although it didn't live up to the pure definition of an MVP (particularly the \"viable\" and \"product\" part), customers believed it was a working product. That was enough to stir their imagination, envision how they'd solve their problems with it and give informed feedback. \nThrough constant iteration, I got closer to what people really wanted and refined who the target customer was. \nHere's that gif: Pre-sell, before you make anything \nOne of the best decisions I made was to charge money from day one. \nGetting customers to trade something of value (time, money, introductions) meant my product was worth something to them. Even before the product existed, I was selling the dream for $45/mo. No screenshots; no demo; no product. It was just the promise of better user onboarding with a money-back guarantee. \nI got 16 people to give me their credit cards toward that dream. \n*Tactical note for bootstrappers out there: don't use this (promised) revenue as salary. A typical C-corp has high taxes on income, and there's a high risk of someone asking for a refund. It's better spent on overhead.* \nHaving that small pool of committed early adopters made building an MVP (minimum viable product) incredibly easy. Those 16 people were passionate about a solution and were a great source for product feedback. The 3-week MVP cycle \nAfter taking our first dollar, it took **3 weeks** to deliver a production-ready product to our first customer, Nanigans. It took 3 more weeks to launch a beta to those other 16 pre-paid customers. \nBecause I was by myself, I had to make bets on new technologies and take shortcuts in order to get to market quickly. Now that I had paying customers, I couldn't take off 3-6 months to find people to join me. I had to keep up the momentum. \nHere are where I saw major gains: \n- I focused on high-value, low-effort marketing, like the Appcues Onboarding Academy. - I maximized everything that was customer-facing: support, design, frontend development. - I minimized or outsourced anything that wasn't customer-facing: our database, hosting, APIs, billing, etc. - I built small tools that helped me be more productive. \nFor a deeper dive into those shortcuts, check out this podcast from TechinBoston . \nUltimately, customers didn't care what our technology stack looked like. All they cared about was whether we were solving their problems. Keep the MVP culture, long-term \nWe're now a team of eight, but we haven't forgotten those early lessons. Prioritizing customer-facing problems is still core to our culture, especially in product, and we've found ways to reenforce it. \nOur team-wide support is my favorite example of how we do that. By having the whole team participate, everyone is in touch with customer needs and can see the broad themes customers care about. \nStaying scrappy has been the toughest virtue to retain, but we've found a few ways to keep some of that too. A commitment to a completely transparent team culture has made that really easy. Early on, we chose to share financials, salaries, equity information, board notes---everything we can---among all employees, and we've seen some great side-effects: \n- It shifts the focus from compensation to team mission. - Everyone sees their role as a participating owner in the business. - That passive insight is attractive to entrepreneurial personalities. \nWe're now a team of eight (and hiring), and staying true to our roots only gets harder. It's easy to follow the crowd. It's easy to build useless things. It's easy to stop hustling. \nDoing things that are high-impact, low-effort. Relentlessly finding creative ways to do a lot with a little. That's the path to traction.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T22:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T11:31:09.893+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
