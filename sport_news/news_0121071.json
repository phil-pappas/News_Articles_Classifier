It took just 23 seconds for Miami to strike as precision passing by Louie Belpedio and Josh Melnick worked the puck to Jack Roslovic in a soft spot in the high slot, where he buried a low wrist shot for his first career point to make it a 1-0 game. \nPlay more or less stagnated over the next five minutes with shots sitting pretty even past the midway point of the opening frame. A stretch pass led to the Friars tying the score as Steven Ruggiero sent Bryan Lemos into the zone, where he fed Robbie Hennessey at the left circle, who beat Jay Williams to the far post to even the score at 1-1. \nA late Miami tripping penalty put PC on its first power play with just under five minutes to go in the period. Another stretch pass put Trevor Mingoia behind the Red and White defense for a partial breakaway, where he was hooked off the puck from behind to earn a penalty shot. Mingoia converted with 4:40 left in the period to put the Friars on top 2-1. While the RedHawks killed off the power play, Anthony Florentino found a soft spot at the top of the left circle and picked a corner to make it 3-1, which is where the score stood after a 20 minute period where Providence held an 11-7 edge in shots. \nMiami killed off 26 seconds of a carryover penalty and started going to work offensively. After working the puck around the boards, Alex Gacek fed Colin Sullivan in the middle coming right off the bench. After making a man miss, Sullivan beat Nick Ellis with a wrist shot for his first collegiate goal to cut the gap to 3-2 just 1:35 into the middle frame. Grant Hutton also drew an assist for his first-collegiate point. \nSustained possession in the offensive zone by the line of Devin Loe, Conor Lemirande and Kiefer Sherwood drew a Providence penalty at the 2:33 mark. While the latter half of the power play put some pressure on, the Friars managed to kill it off before going on a power play of their own right after their minor expired. The Red and White penalty killing unit was sharp and got back to even strength within a goal, but a rebound goal by Brandon Tanev a minute later upped the PC lead to 4-2. \nThe RedHawks got another power play with 8:32 remaining in the frame, but could not get a shot in on goal as the man advantage went by the wayside. Miami nearly got a goal when Roslovic tried to feed Anthony Louis atop the crease, but he was tied up and the puck went the other way where Mingoia finished a back door feed from Mark Jankowski on a 3-on-2 to make it 5-2 with 4:35 to go in the period. \nAnother Friar penalty gave the RedHawks a power play less than a minute later, but they were unable to get anything on goal and skated into the locker room trailing by three goals. \nThe third period had barely started when PC crashed the net and went up 6-2 on a Mark Jankowski goal just 18 seconds into the final regulation frame. Miami was also whistled for a penalty on that scoring play, but killed the ensuing Providence man advantage. \nProvidence added another goal with 11:35 to go when Brian Pinho tipped a Tom Parisi point shot to make it 7-2. Miami got one back from Josh Melnick, who redirected Taylor Richart's point shot for his first-career goal with Alex Gacek picking up the second assist. While Miami did go on a 5-on-3 late in the period, that goal by Melnick was the last tally of the evening for either side. \nThe Friars ended up outshooting the RedHawks 26-22. MU went 1-for-7 on the power play while killing off all four PC man advantages. Gacek dished out two assists for his fifth-career multi-point game. Josh Melnick also added two points with a goal and an assist. In goal, Williams stopped 18 shots in 48:16 of action while Ryan McKay played the final 11:36 and made one save. \nMiami finishes its weekend series against Providence on Saturday at 7:05 p.m. \nImage and information provided by Miami University Athletics Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T08:27:57.193+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
