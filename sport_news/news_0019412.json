Palestinian perpetrators have conducted stabbings, shootings and vehicular attacks against Israeli children, adult civilians and police forces, while Palestinian deaths have reportedly been at the hands of the IDF, with one incident last week characterized as a reprisal attack by an Israeli Jew against Israeli Arabs.\nIsrael's security cabinet met on Tuesday afternoon to consider a host of preemptive and punitive actions, hoping to increase effective security measures without making matters worse. Netanyahu has proposed restricting Palestinian access to specific neighborhoods that have, in the last two weeks, been at particularly high risk of attack.\nQuestioned on the proposal, Toner said: \"We'd hope that any such measures would be temporary.\"\nMeanwhile, Britain's minister for the Middle East, Tobias Ellwood, issued a statement saying that Britain remained \"extremely concerned by the violence that we have seen across Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories so far this month.\"\nTwin attacks in Jerusalem on Tuesday morning took the lives of three Israelis, and wounded over 20 others.\nThe statement condemned Tuesday's attacks that led to the death of three Israelis, as well as other attacks that \"have left multiple innocent civilians wounded.\"\nSince October 1, seven Israelis have been killed and dozens more have been injured in 26 separate attacks across Israel and the Palestinian territories. According to Palestinian reports, 27 Palestinians– including nine alleged attackers– have also died.\nHerb Keinon contributed to this report.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T00:14:15.770+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
