The Eagles fell to 3-3 and 0-3 in the ACC.\nBC employed a two-quarterback rotation with redshirt freshman Troy Flutie and true freshman Jeff Smith in a win against Northern Illinois and consecutive ACC losses to Duke and Wake. The system was implemented after starter Darius Wade suffered a season-ending left ankle fracture in a 14-0 loss to Florida State on Sept. 18.\nThe tandem combined for 290 yards of total offense against the Demon Deacons. Those gains were offset by four turnovers and six pre-snap penalties that included three consecutive offside calls on the Eagles’ opening drive.\nBC’s problems on offense included minimal gains on first down, setbacks in the red zone and atrocious clock management on the Wake Forest 1-yard line with 29 seconds remaining.\n“I’ve said from the beginning that’s not really what I wanted to do,” Addazio said. “But I felt it is what I need to do to figure out which guy and I wanted to get experience for both.\n“I also needed to see if one could separate and until that point (against Wake Forest) that’s what we thought was best. Now we are getting to the point where we are going to settle in a little bit and see where that brings us.”\nFlutie is a rollout passer who can execute short passing schemes but doesn’t add a dimension to the power run game. He has completed 21-of-42 passes for 232 yards with two touchdowns and an interception.\nSmith is a dual-threat quarterback who is better at running the football. He leads the team in rushing with 253 yards on 37 carries with three touchdowns, all of which were scored in a 76-0 win against Howard of the FCS on Sept. 12.\nClemson is ranked 13th in the country in total defense and is equally effective against the pass (29th) and the run (18th).\nNeither Flutie nor Smith possesses an explosive skill that could exploit a weakness in the Tigers defense. Clemson has prevailed against the diverse, high-powered offenses used by Louisville, Notre Dame and Georgia Tech.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T09:01:40.438+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
