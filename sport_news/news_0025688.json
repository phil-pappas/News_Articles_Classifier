But this means we now have an opportunity to argue our case in front of the entire Third Circuit, and I think we have a real legitimate chance. There are clearly serious questions about the court’s two opinions, with Christie I and Christie II in conflict.’’", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:23:22.598+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
