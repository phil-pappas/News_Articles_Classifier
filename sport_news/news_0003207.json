(Matt Dunham | The Associated Press) Comments \nLondon â€” Everything seemed to go wrong for EJ Manuel and the Buffalo Bills in the first half of their loss to the Jacksonville Jaguars on Sunday at Wembley Stadium in London. In a span of three minutes, Manuel turned the ball over three times, leading to 20 Jaguars points and putting the Bills in a 27-3 hole. The Bills eventually lost, 34-31 . \nAmong the issues for Manuel was the fact that the Bills were having problems with quarterback-to-coach communication system. \n\"Yeah, that's an understatement,\" Bills coach Rex Ryan said after the game. \"I don't get it. I don't understand it. But this one was absolutely miserable. I mean, it's unacceptable is what it is. \n\"I wouldn't say it was the entire game, but it was a majority of the game. It was unbelievable. Had everything, static, you couldn't hear anything. Just, you know, a frustrating time obviously in those circumstances. That's why you saw EJ having to come and run over to get the call with (offensive coordinator) Greg (Roman) trying to yell it into him quite a few times.\" \nManuel wasn't even sure exactly was wrong with the radio communication system. He couldn't hear anything at times. \n\"For whatever reason, if it was a dead spot out on the field, whatever reason, second quarter it was going out,\" Manuel said. \"I was hustling to the sideline to get the plays. They finally fixed it. I don't know the technical reasons why it wasn't working and why it was working at certain times. We finally got it fixed.\" \nAccording to Pro Football Talk , the reason the communication system wasn't working is because the Bills weren't using fully charged batteries. The league says charging the batteries is the responsibility of the team, so the Bills have nobody to blame but themselves.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T13:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T21:23:25.663+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
