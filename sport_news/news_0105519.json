Gordon is preparing for his final race at Kansas Speedway before retirement. By Rick Peterson rick.peterson@cjonline.com \nKANSAS CITY, Kan. — Jeff Gordon, who is getting closer and closer to retirement as a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series driver, will bid a fond farewell on Sunday to Kansas Speedway, a track that has been very good to him since it opened in 2001. \nGordon won the first two Cup races at Kansas in ’01 and ’02 and became the first driver to win three times at the track in ’14. He has 11 top-five and 13 top-10 finishes in 19 career Kansas starts. \n“Obviously winning those first two races (was) special, but every time I come back here, now that we get a chance to do it twice a year, I realize why I like this track so much,” said Gordon, who will retire as a driver at the end of the ’15 season. “Just (Friday), the first laps on the track, I’m like, ‘Yes, good to be back here.’ It’s just a great track.” \nKansas Speedway honored Gordon on Friday, presenting him with a replica of his first quarter midget, built by automotive students from the North Kansas City School District. Gordon was also presented a No. 24 Kansas City Chiefs jersey by former Chiefs Deron Cherry and Chris Penn and on Sunday the first 24,000 fans through the gates at Kansas Speedway will receive a commemorative 24 pin. \nBut Sunday’s 1:15 p.m. Hollywood Casino 400 isn’t just about nostalgia for Gordon, who will start the race sixth. Currently sitting seventh in Sprint Cup points, Gordon will be looking to solidify his spot in the Chase in the second of three races in the Challenger Round. After next week’s race at Talladega (Ala.), the field will be cut to eight for the Eliminator Round and Gordon currently holds only an eight-point lead over ninth-place Ryan Newman entering Sunday’s race. \nGordon, a four-time Sprint Cup champion, feels like Kansas is a perfect track to strengthen his position. \n“It drives in a way that I just enjoy it,” the 44-year-old Gordon said. “The transitions, the smoothness of the track, the grip level of the track — there is just a lot to like here. It was that way the first time I came here and when you enjoy a track as much as I do this track, as a driver it allows you to not have to think too much about what you’re doing out there, but just fine tune on what you need out of the car. \n“There are few tracks on the schedule that it seems like no matter what is going on with our team and our performance you can always count on going to those tracks and being successful or having good speed. Martinsville is certainly one that comes to mind, but outside of the short tracks, this is one of those tracks for me as well.” \nBrad Keselowski, eighth in points, also needs a big race Sunday and took the first step by earning the pole. Because of a NASCAR penalty for multiple technical warnings, however, Keselowski was not able to get the first pick for his pit stall. \nKeselowski said it’s impossible to tell how much of an effect not having the first pit stall will have on his race. \n“I don’t know,” he said. “That’s a good question for when the race is over, but I think right now it is what it is and we’ll make the most of it.” \nColumbia, Mo., native Carl Edwards, sixth in points, qualified second and will be in pit stall one as he chases his first Sprint Cup win at his home track. \nKyle Busch (10th in points) qualified third while defending Sprint Cup champion Kevin Harvick (second in points) and Denny Hamlin (fourth in points) rounded out the top five in qualifying. \nMartin Truex, third in points, earned the No. 7 qualifying spot. \nCurrent points leader Joey Logano, the only driver guaranteed of a berth in the Eliminator Round after last week’s win at Charlotte, will start 14th Sunday, but Logano won last October at Kansas. \nEmporia native Clint Bowyer will start 26th. \nRick Peterson can be reached at (785) 295-1129 or rick.peterson@cjonline.com .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T23:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T02:53:47.295+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
