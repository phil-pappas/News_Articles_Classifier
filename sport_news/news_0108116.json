The attack is something that could happen to anyone and should be condemned, not promoted.''\nThe CIA said there was no indication so far that any of the documents exposed are classified.\n\"The documents released are those that a private citizen with national security interests and expertise would be expected to possess,'' according to the CIA statement.\nThe disclosures come after a hacker, described as an American high school student, initially claimed in a New York Post report to have breached the private email accounts of Brennan and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. Following those claims, the hacker posted separate personal information associated with Brennan, Johnson and other current and former intelligence officials.\nNone of that material contained classified information, officials said, though the breaches prompted the Secret Service and the FBI to launch an investigation into the attacks.\nAmong the additional documents disclosed Wednesday by WikiLeaks included a copy of Senate bill outlining certain torture techniques and a draft position paper, titled \"The Conundrum of Iran.''\nThe paper was drafted as a briefing document prior to President Obama's election in 2008.\n\"Whoever takes up residence at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue in January 2009 will need to 'hit the ground running' on Iran, especially since Tehran will react immediately to the new administration's policy statements,'' the paper stated, adding that the new president should \"tone down the rhetoric.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T03:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:57:34.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
