Earlier, the Nature Park was selected as the venue for a lavish dinner for business tycoons coming here from across the country and abroad to attend the upcoming two-day Investors Meet being held at Indian School of Business (ISB) from October 28. Mohali Deputy Commissioner Tejinder Pal Singh Sidhu confirmed the development, adding that the state dinner would now be hosted at a five star hotel in Chandigarh. “You see the park is infested with mosquitoes and insects. Moreover, the weather is not suitable to host a dinner in the open, so the venue has been shifted,” said Sidhu. The officials supervising the arrangements said stink emanating from the nullah was also a reason for shifting the venue at the eleventh hour. Repair and beautification of the park were in full swing for the past few days. Last time, The Punjab Government hosted a state dinner for Chief Minister of Pakistan’s Punjab Muhammad Shahbaz Sharif in Nature Park in December 2013. Hosts expect 150 delegates for the summit According to Anirudh Tiwari, CEO of the Punjab Bureau of Investment, the state government has expected participation of more than 150 delegates of top industrial houses from across the country and abroad in the upcoming meet. “Apart from India’s top industries, including Reliance, Adani’s, Hero Group, the delegates from big industries from other countries, including Poland, China, Africa, the UK, the US, France and Israel, are also coming for the meet, which would attract business of hundreds of crores of rupees,” said Tiwari. The CEO added that at the last Investors meet held at Mohali, a total of 128 MoUs were signed. “Of a total of 128 MoUs, ground work has already started on 57, which means a success rate of 46 per cent,” claimed Tiwari, adding that the success rate was the highest in the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:11:25.976+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
