They stood in the center of the turf field — the administrator with a second chance at hiring a football coach and the football coach looking for a second chance — while players running past craned their necks to eavesdrop. \nLocksley wished they wouldn’t. \n“I have zero expectations about getting this job,” he said a few minutes later. “I just want to do the best job I can for the next seven weeks as the leader of the program. All that other stuff, it takes care of itself and for me, if we take care of business on the field, if I’m the guy, great. If not, I’m still a Maryland guy. I’ve always loved and had an affinity for this place and I’ll continue to be a big fan whether I’m here or not.” \n[ Locksley not planning ‘wholesale changes’ in his audition as Maryland head coach ] \nThe Terrapins found a reprieve from the fallout of Coach Randy Edsall’s firing at practice, where Locksley didn’t change much on his first day leading the Terrapins on the field. There was more music, defensive lineman Yannick Ngakoue said, and a couple training-camp-style hitting drills that fired up the team. He spent less time with the quarterbacks. Tight ends coach John Dunn is also leading more offensive meetings now that Locksley has more on his plate. \nBehind the scenes, however, Locksley seems to be taking the pulse of the locker room. \nHe promptly named junior Perry Hills the team’s starting quarterback going forward. He promised the Terrapins that all they should worry about is having the most fun possible over the next six weeks. He even held a meeting Tuesday to help with players’ emotions regarding Edsall’s dismissal and “coming in touch with those feelings, because it’s a lot like losing parent,” Locksley said. \n“Like I told them, I feel like crap because I know I played a part in this decision that was made on Sunday with not getting the job done on the offensive side of the ball,” he added. “A good coach lost his job, but what we’ve got to do now is it’s behind us. As much as we tend to dwell on it, we’ve got to move forward, for the program and for our plans.” \nThose that know Locksley best believe he can handle these volatile dynamics, that he learned from his disastrous 2-26 run as head coach at New Mexico. Craig Jeffries, who worked under Locksley at New Mexico, said that beyond schematics, the same instincts that make Locksley one of the Washington area’s top recruiters will serve him well here. \n“He’s able to eat a hot dog and steak and lobster with anybody. It feels like everybody knows him,” said Jeffries, who is the head coach at Oxon Hill High School in Prince George’s County. “He’s the guy that understands you.” \nOn cue, cornerback Will Likely said Locksley’s best trait is “everybody knows him,” not just the offensive players. But as much as Wednesday’s practice served as an diversion from a tumultuous few days in College Park, the fallout was everywhere. \nHills said Wednesday that Edsall’s firing, despite the media speculation ahead of Saturday’s 49-28 loss at No. 1 Ohio State , was still a “shock.” Ngakoue expressed sadness over the regime change because of the role Edsall played in his personal development. \nThey all tried to steer the focus towards anything else. “It really doesn’t matter who’s coaching us. It’s all about the players,” Hills said. “It’s all about us being a family and playing for each other, not the coach.” Mark Giannotto is a Montgomery County native who covers high school sports for The Washington Post.
