So, not that many people. \nApple touted some new features for its native Mail app in the release of iOS 9, but with superior offerings out there, like Google Inbox and--yes--Microsoft's new Outlook, it seems doubtful they've wooed many. Like many little-used products, it seems iOS 9's messaging app didn't get Steve-Jobs-level attention to detail. \nFor one, some users suspect the app of draining the phone's battery. iOS 9 has a handy new way to see which apps are sucking up your power, and that revealed the culprit for Boston ex-pat investor Semil Shah, who admitted he logs into the unfavored native Mail app occasionally when using TestFlight. Q: Anyone else noticing massive power drain for ios9 esp on native mail app? Also, is there more of a POS than that Mail app? No. \nâ€” Semil (@semil) September 30, 2015 \nBattery-draining issues aren't new for iOS 9. They appeared in the new operating system's beta release . Shah told me he thinks too many of the new iOS' native apps hog background location resources--Mail included. (He also noted that WiFi Assist and Facebook for iPhone's video auto-play aren't doing battery life any favors.) \n\"I should clarify that I think this current iOS9 update is one of the best updates by Apple -- my iPhone 6+ is now lightning fast,\" he wrote in an email. \"Overall, it's great.\" \nI've seen some totally unrelated problems, all tied to the Mail app. Email newsletters BostInno sends out via MailChimp get split up by the screen on the native messenger in an iPhone 5s running iOS 9. (Not too many people actually use the messenger, so I don't know at this writing if the same problem affects the larger screen on the iPhone 6.) \nAt right, you can see what In The Know, our morning newsletter, looks like in the native mail app on iOS 9. \nThen, there seem to be some problems syncing with some email providers. If you're (God help you) using Yahoo mail on the native mail app , you probably had a rocky start with iOS 9. The fix is pretty easy. @Yahoo_Cares posted it : Just delete and re-install the app. \nNo official response from Apple, yet, but as a former Blackberry loyalist who held on until 2012, I can tell you these issues are familiar: Bad formatting, failure to sync and debilitating power drains are the hallmarks of waning attention to a platform that's in decline.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T00:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T05:56:21.564+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
