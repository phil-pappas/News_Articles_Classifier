Last season, he threw for 19 touchdowns and 17 interceptions. Yikes.\nMaybe it's fool's gold early on but as of now Dalton deserves a spot in the elite tier alongside Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers.\nTier I 1. Tom Brady, Patriots (1)\nBrady owns the top spot for the fifth straight week and doesn't appear to be giving it up anytime soon. He took five first-half sacks against Dallas Sunday but still threw for 275 yards, two touchdowns and completed 74 percent of his passes.\n2. Andy Dalton, Bengals (5)\nHe's ascended up this list every week and now he sits in the runner-up seat. Dalton is having the best season of his career. After coming back from a 17-point deficit to beat Seattle, Dalton deserves serious MVP consideration. And he's the NFL's second-leading passer.\n3. Aaron Rodgers, Packers (2)\nThe defending MVP drops a spot because he simply had a human day. He threw his first interception at home since 2013. Rodgers actually double-dipped and threw two interceptions Sunday.\nTier II 4. Carson Palmer, Cardinals (6)\nHe only needed 14 passes to dispatch of the Lions in a blowout, but he threw three TDs continuing his stellar run. Palmer has 13 TDs and only three interceptions.\nAdvertisement 5. Phillip Rivers, Chargers (4)\nRivers might have the worst supporting cast around him of any QB on this top-10 list and a 2-3 record to go with it. Yet, he's the NFL's leading passer and has completed 71 percent of his passes.\n6. Eli Manning, Giants (9)\nLittle brother Manning is the ninth quarterback in NFL history to complete 75 percent of his passes and throw for 440-plus yards. And he capped it off with a brilliant two-minute drill without his best receivers for most of the drive.\nTier III 7. Matt Ryan, Falcons (3)\nMatty Ice was thawed out by Washington's defense Sunday only completing 57 percent of his passes and throwing two picks. Still, he his team is 5-0. Ryan has thrown for 250-plus yards every game this season.\n8. Drew Brees, Saints (7)\nHis shoulder might only be 50 percent and the Saints are terrible, but Brees is giving it his best go. He's thrown for 335-plus yards in each of his last two games since the injury.\n9. Cam Newton, Panthers (8)\nNewton got an early bye last week. He's played well enough to maintain his spot on this list. Plus, no one has been able to push him out.\n10. Derek Carr, Raiders (NR)\nGet sports news and updates right in your inbox Sign up to receive news alerts and a daily roundup of all things Colorado sports delivered to your inbox.\nYoung Carr's pick-six ended any Raiders hope of upsetting the Broncos Sunday. He still has some to learn, but the talent and early success is there.\nPeyton Manning Watch (20)\nBig brother Manning continued his turnover trip Sunday with two more interceptions. The Broncos have won two games without scoring an offensive touchdown. The rest of the NFL: 0.\nCaught my eye: Matthew Hasselback, Colts\nWhat a performance by the 40-year-old QB from Boulder in back-to-back games. Without him the Colts could be staring at 1-4, instead they are 3-2. And Hasselback did it with his health at, like, 12 percent.\nBringing up the rear: Matthew Stafford, Lions\nStafford was once thought of as the franchise's savior now the Lions aren't even sure if he should be their starting quarterback. He was benched for Dan Orlovsky. Yes, I didn't know he was still in the NFL either. Stafford also leads the NFL in interceptions with eight.\nFell out of the rankings: Nick Foles, Rams (10)\nCameron Wolfe: 303-954-1891, cwolfe@denverpost.com or @CameronWolfe", "external_links": ["http://denverpostplus.com/app/mailer-rules/www/", "https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Andada|Montserrat:400,700|Open+Sans:400,800,700,400italic"], "published": "2015-10-13T19:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:03:16.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
