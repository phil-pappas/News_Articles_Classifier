Jeron Teng of La Salle drives to the basket and encounters still resistance from UST’s Zachary Huang in a UAAP game won by the Tigers, 77-61. ROMAN PROSPERO \nKareem Abdul added five points during that UST counterattack that saw the Growling Tigers erase a 14-point, 16-30, deficit to inch to within two at the end of the second period. \n“Depensa pa rin namin ito. Naka-execute kami. Nag-follow na lang ang offense,” said UST coach Bong de la Cruz. \nLa Salle, with Jeron Teng shooting 13, and Joshua Torralba adding 12, dropped to a 3-3 slate in a tie for third with National University. \nJanus Suarez hit two of four triples in the last 6:08 of third, while Bonleon and Louie Vigil added two more as UST went on to grab the upperhand, 45-38. \n“]Yun ang hinintay ko sa team, kailangan tumama ang mga tira nila. This game, tumama ang tira nila sa three-points,” added de la Cruz. \nAnother trey from Vigil with 2:21 remaining kept the UST in front by 10, 52-42, while another from Marvin Lee with 1:05 left stretched it to 13, 57-44. \nEd Daquioag, who had 11 points, drained another three-point bomb with 15.6 ticks left in the third as UST entered the fourth with a 60-46, lead. \nFerrer hit another one of his three treys at the start of the fourth, and UST’s lead ballooned to 17, 63-46. \nHe and Vigil fired two more triples in the remaining 6:31, as UST took a 19-point edge, 70-51, in the last 6:17. \nEarlier, the Ateneo Blue Eagles crushed the University of the Philippines Fighting Maroons, 56-43, to improve to 4-2. \nVon Pessumal and Kiefer Ravena scored 11 points apiece for the Blue Eagles. \n“Unlike in our last game, we did not allow them to score 11 points in the first two quarters this time,” said Blue Eagles coach Bo Perasol. \nThe win was Ateneo’s 12th straight win over UP since 2009. \nThe Maroons, meanwhile, took their fourth straight defeat against only two wins to remain at the bottom of the standings.
