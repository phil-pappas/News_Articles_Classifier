You know the consequences ” \nAfter deciding that, actually, Liam isn’t a ‘lad’ and changing it to ‘boy’, Liam responded: “Don’t start me man ima bout to see you in like 4 minutes … Arm wrestleyo face”. \nTo which 23-year-old Lou concluded with a whole load of emojis and the rather sinister/ sexy: “I’ll be waiting…” \nIt’s a miracle we survived this conversation without spontaneously combusting, to be honest. \nA+ for the banters, boys, and please do keep it coming.
