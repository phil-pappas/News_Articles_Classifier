In the last two days, it has helped recapture territory from insurgents in Hama and Idlib provinces where Russian forces backing Assad have been bombing.\nAl-Manar said Haj, born in 1965, had in his 20s been a top commander in southern Lebanon in battles against Israel.\n\"He participated in most of the jihad operations, especially in the 1980s when he was commander of the Tuffah region\" it said, referring to him as \"the martyr commander Abu Mohammed\" and showing footage of him test-firing a Kalashnikov assault rifle and other weapons.\nMourners waving Hezbollah flags threw rice on the coffin before it departed in convoy and recited Shi'ite Muslim prayers for the dead invoking the Imam Hussein, grandson of the Prophet Mohammed. â€” Reuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T20:06:23.972+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
