Show Caption Previous Next \nEchoPark Automotive is inviting the community to meet the Denver Broncos Cheerleaders at any of their three locations to help kick off the company’s food drive to benefit Food Bank of the Rockies. \nOn Saturday, October 3, the cheerleaders will take photos with fans and sign autographs for visitors in support of the initiative to collect 1,000 pounds of donations. EchoPark is encouraging visitors to bring nonperishable food items (no glass containers), diapers and pet food. \n“All of us at EchoPark are really excited and gearing up for the event with the Denver Broncos Cheerleaders,” said Jeff Matthews, executive general manager of EchoPark Automotive. “Between the meet-and-greet and the photo and autograph opportunities, Broncos fans will have a fantastic opportunity to visit with the cheerleaders, and we’re expecting a big crowd for this event. If everyone who visits EchoPark to meet the cheerleaders also brings along a donation for Food Bank of the Rockies, this could prove to be one of the most incredible events we’ve ever put on.” \nThe Broncos Cheerleaders will appear at all three of EchoPark’s locations: Centennial (10401 E. Arapahoe Rd.) from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m., Highlands Ranch (1500 E. County Line Rd.) from 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., and Thornton (500 E. 104th Ave.) from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. The auto dealer encourages visitors to arrive early in anticipation of crowds. \nFor more information visit echopark.com or contact Carmen Leonard at CLeonard@caldwellandkerr.com or call 303-323-4825 X 2001 Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc.
