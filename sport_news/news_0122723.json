On the way to catch the next flight, this one from Texas to Nevada to tend to business concerning the face of modern-day golf. \nTo us, that is, the face of golf. \nTo Jay Danzi, 1994 Vestal High graduate remembered hereabouts for a stroke and range and gumption rivaled by, oh, perhaps one local basketball competitor of his era? \n“He’s become a family member. He’s an incredible young man,” was his description of Jordan Spieth, World No. 1, five-time 2015 winner and twice a major champion in a $12 million PGA Tour season. \n“What you see on TV is just a glimpse of the type of person that he is. He treats my two sons and my wife like we’re part of their family, and vice versa. It’s an honor to work with him to say the least.” \nDanzi, 40, is one of the men behind The Man. \nHe is President of Consulting at Lagardère Unlimited Americas in Fort Worth, a firm that oversees such matters as branding, career management, contract negotiations, logistics, public relations and digital platforms for some of the premier athletes around the globe. \nA significant part of his job description: Watch over most all particulars relating to Spieth, the hottest name in the game, a growing conglomerate who, at age 22, is backed by blue-chip sponsors including Under Armour, AT&T, Titleist, Rolex and Netjets. \n“We handle kind of all sides of the business so that he can go play golf and doesn’t have to worry about all the business logistics, that’s what I worry about,” Danzi said. \nTelevision viewers have seen Danzi, between the 18th green and scoring facility at Augusta National, or somewhere on the grounds at Chambers Bay in University Place, Wash., site of Spieth’s second consecutive major championship. Or, perhaps at the home of golf, St. Andrews, where his guy fell a stroke shy of a playoff in July. \nReaders of national publications have repeatedly seen Danzi’s name, preceded or followed by “Spieth’s agent.” \nSee, Danzi was on this phenom early, in fact secured Spieth as a client when he turned professional in 2012. At the time, Danzi did his work for Forefront Sports Group, an agency he founded. \nSpieth was considered a “can’t miss” out of the University of Texas, and accordingly was sought after by about every sports agency under the stars. Danzi referred to him as “The No. 1 draft pick— by far. And I was very fortunate enough to be selected to work with him beginning right when he turned pro in December of 2012. \n“I think he liked the focus on the brand that we promised, and my experience working with a lot of the top players in the game and the ability to provide a level of service that was unlike anything in the business. And he trusted me. I’d been working with his father helping a business get started off the ground, they got a chance to know me personally and my team. At the end of the day it’s about what you can do, but also the trust. \n“I’d known him for a long time, longer than any other agent. I was very fortunate for the opportunity.” \nFresh out of Dartmouth College, where he was a basketball letterman, two-year captain of the golf team and All-Ivy League in that sport, Danzi signed on as Brand Manager at Bright Sun Consulting, where he oversaw sports and brand marketing for ExxonMobil and Samsung. \nNext came an eight-year hitch with industry titan IMG, for which he served as vice president as well as Global Head of Recruiting for IMG Golf. Then came four years with Wasserman Media Group, where he founded, nurtured and expanded exponentially its global golf division. \nThe Forefront Sports Group experience lasted just shy of two years before Lagardère Unlimited acquired Danzi and his clients in 2013. \nCha-ching! \n“I was fortunate enough to have a lot of different agencies approach me,” Danzi said. “I was successful building out Wasserman Media Group’s golf practice from scratch. I decided that I would choose Lagardère, the opportunity to build out another practice and was intrigued about what they had to offer.” \nDanzi or a member of his team accompanies Speith through PGA Tour stops as well as whatever appearances and corporate obligations the schedule calls for. \n“He’s the most sought-after, marketable, No. 1 in the world on and off the course, in addition to being one of the most marketable and sought-after athletes,” Danzi said. “So he’s constantly having people reach out and asking him to do things. So, being out there is important.” \nAnd, yes, can mean running interference. \n“At times,” he said. “Sometimes in this business you have to say ‘No.’ People have jobs to do, and Jordan can’t do every single activity, it would be impossible. Sometimes I’ve got to be the bad guy who says ‘No,’ and also coordinate everything we said ‘Yes’ to.” \nDanzi added, “At 22 years old, he’s the CEO of a corporation. He makes the decisions. We all play a role. He talks about team all the time. Despite this being an individual sport, he does talk about team. We all play a role in hopefully having him have success on the course in addition to all he’s doing off the course. \n“Everybody plays a role in his success. Don’t get me wrong, he’s the one putting the 10-footer that breaks two feet and making it, or hitting the fairway in the heat of battle, I’m certainly not taking credit for that. It’s just a testament to him that he does view things from a team perspective, it’s a testament to his character.” \nIt seems Spieth, acknowledged as arguably the preeminent putter in the game, is highly proficient from 15 feet with another object in hand. \nOn occasion, basketball will be introduced during down time. Jordan, his brother Steven, their friends — and the 6-foot-5 agent who has maintained that sugary stroke from back in the day — engage in some friendly competition. Steven Spieth, by the way, is a 6-6 guard who started 58 of 59 games over the last two seasons for Brown University’s basketball team. \n“Let me say it this way: I still enjoy shooting,” Danzi shared. “I’ll take Jordan on in a three-point contest but he’s really good at foul shots. I’ll let him take the foul shots but I’ll go a couple feet beyond the three-point line. When we play H*O*R*S*E, that’s where I can get him.” \nAnd where Danzi got most competitors while wearing a Vestal High uniform. His 25-per-game scoring average was tops among 10 players chosen to the Press & Sun-Bulletin’s All-Metro squad in the winter of '94. \nThat season, his nine outings with 30 or more points included a 36-point showing as the Golden Bears topped Binghamton for the program’s first Section 4 championship since 1983-84. Oh, seven of nine three-point attempts dropped against the Patriots, a few from “Get Outta Here” distance or degree of difficulty. \nHis final high school game brought a 31-point showing at West Point against an unbeaten Newburgh squad to open state playoffs. The overmatched Bears were within 24-20 at halftime, despite no teammate adding to Danzi’s 18-point half until 18 seconds remained. \nHis sophomore year at Dartmouth, the Big Green strung six wins to start the season before absorbing a 30-point loss to North Carolina in the Dean Dome— where, Danzi recalls, he knocked down a couple from beyond the arc. \nFor a time, he had aspirations of a play-for-pay future in one of his sports of choice. However, “I’d like to blame it on injuries, but maybe it was lack of talent, that I wasn’t going to go professional in either sport. I realized early on that I wanted to do this,” he said of his current profession.\" \nOne the home front, Team Danzi members are wife Katie, and sons Thomas (8) and Sam (5). Katie is the daughter of Tom Grieve and brother of Ben Grieve, who pitched and manned the outfield, respectively, for a combined 19 seasons of major league ball. \nJay referenced that family unit by way of response to the question, “Who’s the next Jordan Spieth” — and how’s this for the stoutest endorsement of a young man’s character. \n“There’s not a next Jordan,” he began. “On and off the golf course, he’s made up of things that .. If Jordan Spieth wants to be President of the United States or do anything, he’ll be successful in whatever he does. His parents have done an amazing job of raising him and then Jordan has turned into an amazing young man. \n“He’s unbelievably intelligent, he’s amazingly caring and passionate, he’s genuine, honest. Things that, as a father of two boys, if my sons end up a quarter, an eighth, a 10th of the man Jordan is at 22, then we’ve been great parents.” \nStevens can be reached by email at kstevens@pressconnects.com and on Twitter @PSBKevin. 1 CONNECT 11 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://press.sn/1LyweLz TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T00:12:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T04:31:09.390+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
