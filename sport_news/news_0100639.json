Last year I got lucky. This year I didn’t. So it’s a pity.” \nFederer, who had a bye in the first round, had played Ramos-Vinolas only once before, in the first round of Wimbledon in 2012, dropping just three games in a 6-1 6-1 6-1 dismissal of the Spaniard. \nBut it was a very different story in the Shanghai second round on Tuesday as he struggled to impose himself in the first set and collapsed in the tie-breaker with a string of unforced errors. \nOrder was seemingly restored as the great Swiss broke early in the second set and again for 5-2, before calmly serving it out to level the match. \nBut disaster struck as Federer served at 2-3 down in the third, when he dished up a double break point and then clipped the net before Ramos-Vinolas punched away a forehand for his first break of the night. \nAnd Federer caused his own downfall in the final game as he netted a forehand to bring up match point, and then misfired a backhand return to leave a disbelieving Ramos-Vinolas saluting the crowd. \n“I played him at Wimbledon before, so I knew him. I’ve seen him play. He’s definitely improved since then. That was a while back and that was not his favourite surface,” Federer told reporters. \n“I was aware that he could give me a tough workout and even beat me. I’m always cautious. \n“I don’t underestimate or lack respect for anybody out there. These guys are all touring professionals, they know what they’re doing. \n“The margins are so small, that’s why I sometimes struggle to talk to you guys about, ‘Yeah, I’d like to play Novak (Djokovic) in the finals, Rafa (Nadal) in the semis, (Jo-Wilfried) Tsonga in the second round.’ \n“It’s not like that. Now you’re not asking me those questions. I wonder why, you know. Because I’m on a flight.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T16:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T19:59:07.319+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
