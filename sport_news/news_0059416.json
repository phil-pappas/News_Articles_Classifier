He wanted to remember what life was like back when he was a workhorse running back, back when a normal game day included 20-plus carries to go with 100 yards and a touchdown.\nDixon needs to remember what that's like because he could be in line for an increased workload in the Buffalo Bills ' backfield this week against the Titans with both LeSean McCoy (hamstring) and Karlos Williams (concussion) nursing injuries. Ever since he came into the league as a sixth-round pick in 2010, Dixon hasn't gotten to be a true workhorse.\n\"It's been a minute,\" Dixon said with a smile Wednesday.\nRight now, Dixon is No. 1 on the Bills' running back depth chart. He's gotten this chance before. Last year, the Bills lost C.J. Spiller and Fred Jackson in one game, forcing Dixon into an increased role. He ended up with his only 20-carry game in the NFL and turned it into just 44 yards. In 2015, on eight carries, Dixon has zero rushing yards.\n\"Yeah, it has been tough,\" Dixon admitted. \"Last year ... I started off a little better. I had a couple of big runs, you know my average, everything was looking better. But I have been struggling this year, hasn't been happening the same way, but I am staying positive. My teammates, they are still backing me and they are just telling me just keep on grinding. It is going to happen to me.\"\nIf it's going to happen, this would be the week. Dixon said he finally feels 100 percent coming off the calf injury that sidelined him for most of training camp and the preseason. The first few weeks of the season were a struggle after the missed time.\n\"You're not yourself,\" Dixon said. \"You can say it, but you're not. I wasn't the same person I could just tear out and play wild. I had to really tempo and think about my steps and think about what I was doing. So it messed with me a little bit. But now I feel fully confident with it. I feel it's going to be the best it's going to be. But I'm ready to go.\"\n\"We came back in here Monday and my body felt different. Now I can move on and start trusting my ability, trusting what I'm seeing and go make plays.\"\nDixon has long maintained that he is capable of carrying the load. A year ago when faced with the opportunity, he said he didn't get labeled correctly coming out of college and that he's \"been a workhorse\" his entire life.\nIn his brief opportunity to prove people wrong in 2014, Dixon had his moments but didn't have the breakout game he was looking for. That's why he's digging up some of his old Mississippi State highlights, to remind himself of that \"good feeling\" and remember what it was like to pile up yardage.\n\"I feel like I'm born for this,\" Dixon said.\nOh, and don't think an increased role on offense will keep Dixon from staring on special teams.\n\"I'm still prepared to do my usual duties if I have to go out there on punt returns or have to go out there on whatever,\" Dixon said. \"That's why I used the tag 'superback' earlier in the year, because I'm down for whatever, man. I just want to win. I want to get to the championship, and I want to win.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T18:30:42.721+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
