But coming off back-to-back losses, there are some concerns. \nOne of those issues has been the defense. \nSU gave up a season worst 45 points to USF last Saturday. In the two losses to LSU and South Florida the Orange defense has given up touchdowns of 62, 42 and 45 yards. \nCoach Scott Shafer knows they have to clean things up. \n\"Just got to keep teaching those young guys how to play team defense,\" said Shafer in his press conference on Thursday. \"Some of those big plays were short throws that turned into bigger runs and we didn't do a good job leveraging and playing with good angles. So we've tried to work on those things by fabricating drills in practice that tend to those issues, but got to get rid of them.\" \nOn Saturday Syracuse travels to Virginia for a 3:30 p.m. kick. \nThe Cavaliers are only 1-4 this year, but that record is a bit deceiving. Two of those losses came to Top 25 teams, Notre Dame and UCLA.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T20:31:52.604+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
