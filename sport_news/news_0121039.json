He really showed that he can play.”\nHe wasn’t the only Skyhawk to emerge against the Vikings. Cunningham also decided to break in backup quarterback Christian Baltodano, who responded by throwing three touchdown passes.\n“He had a lot to prove,” Cunningham said. “I was just happy because I wanted to get to where we can use two guys, and have both be prepared and ready to play.”\nSilverado’s usual stars got their usual production too. Devion Clayton caught two touchdown passes, while Keiko Misipeka rushed for four scores.\nCase ", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/casekeefer"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T02:47:33.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
