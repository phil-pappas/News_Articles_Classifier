Texas Tech Images from Saturday's game between the Jayhawks and Red Raiders in Lawrence \nDineen added that knowing Heeney was in attendance brought a little extra energy to KU’s defense. \n“You want to perform well and prove to him that you can play, too,” Dineen said. \n— See what people were saying about the game during KUsports.com's live blog .
