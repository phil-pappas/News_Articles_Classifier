It's retired people and people who play nine holes of golf in a cart and then have to take a nap.\" \nThe 35th Lakefront Marathon, the Badgerland Striders' signature event, begins at 7:30 a.m. Sunday at Grafton High School. \nA record 3,500 entrants representing 37 states and five foreign countries will work their way east and then south on the relatively flat and scenic 26.2-mile point-to-point course. The first runners are expected to cross the finish line in Veterans Park about 10 a.m. \nBefore Boehm became a marathoner, he equated running 26 miles with mountain climbing or bull riding. \n\"It was one of the crazy things people did,\" he said. \"Then I met a guy who ran marathons to be a better skier. He said, 'You ought to try it. It's not that bad. If you can run 10 miles you can run 26.' Which is bogus.\" \nBoehm tried it and liked it. Thirty-five years later, he's still going strong. \n\"But it's getting to the point where just getting through it is hard work,\" he said. \"Thirty-five years ago I'd run to beat a certain time. Now I'm just trying to beat my last time. Even the training is getting hard.\" \nJim Bahr of New Berlin also has finished every Lakefront Marathon. Duane Tate of Lake Mills has toed the starting line every year but was unable to finish the race in 2012 because of an injury. \n\"I thought I would only run until age 70, but I just keep going,\" said the 72-year-old Bahr. \"I didn't plan this (streak). It just happened.\" \nBahr has won his age division in the Lakefront Marathon 12 times. \nAsked why he keeps coming back, he said, \"It's the people, not just the runners. It's the people offering you refreshments, offering you encouragement. They're probably thinking, 'There goes another crazy person.'\" \nRace director Jon Mueller calls Boehm, Bahr and Tate \"our machine runners.\" \n\"They're inspiring to me and hopefully to other people,\" he said. \nThere are a couple minor changes to the course because of construction in Bayside. A course map and other race information is available at badgerlandstriders.org . \n\"I think we've gained a very good reputation of being a small-sized marathon with world-class amenities,\" Mueller said. \"We've got an incredible pool of talent with the Badgerland Striders. They're passionate and dedicated and they have 35 years of experience doing this. \n\"And then the course itself is executed very well, and it's a beautiful course. We have a lot of repeat runners from all around the country and the world.\" © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc. All rights reserved.
