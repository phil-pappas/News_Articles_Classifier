The Wolves ran through Van Buren all night for a 78-8 win. \nBY ANDY KRUTSINGER \nMt. Pleasant News \nWINFIELD — The eighth-ranked Winfield-Mt. Union football team is one win away from an undefeated season. The Wolves scored a season high in points on Friday night, defeating Van Buren, 78-8 to move to 8-0. \nThe Wolves ran the ball well all night. After a blocked punt by Jordan Hudson on Van Buren’s first drive, W-MU capitalized with a couple of run plays that ended with a five-yard touchdown run by Bryce Robison. Darren Hunter ran in the two-point conversion, and the Wolves were off with an 8-0 lead. \nRobison picked off Warrior quarterback Greg Wenke on the next Van Buren drive and scored on a 15-yard run a few plays later. Again, Hunter had the two-point run and it was 16-0. \nHunter scored two touchdowns of his own in the first quarter. The first was a five-yard run, and the second was a long touchdown catch from quarterback Kolt Rossiter on a screen pass that went up the sideline for 49 yards. When the dust had settled in the first quarter, the Wolves held a 32-0 lead. \nVan Buren attempted to get their passing game going throughout the first half, but the Wolves swarmed the ball all night. Already leading 40-0 after a Zach Davis touchdown catch, Sam Jennings scored on a 67-yard pick-six and Robison took a 67-yard punt return for a score on back-to-back Van Buren possessions. The Wolves took a 64-0 lead into halftime. \nAfter another Robison touchdown made it 72-0 in the third quarter, the Warriors were finally able to put together a touchdown drive. Wenke led the team downfield, and after a pass interference call inside the five-yard line, Danny Roberts punched the ball in with a three-yard touchdown run. Wenke found Will Mertens for the two-point conversion and the lead was cut to 72-8. \nClayton Benedict stepped in at QB late in the game for the Wolves and scored on a 25-yard touchdown run that finished off the scoring at 78-8 late in the fourth quarter. \nRobison finished with 165 yards and three touchdowns on 12 attempts for W-MU to lead the offense. Hunter had 12 attempts of his own and went for 65 yards and two touchdowns, and also had one catch for 49 yards and a score. \nRossiter finished the game 5-6 and threw for 145 yards and two touchdowns. His leading receiver was Zach Davis, who finished with two catches for 53 yards and a touchdown. \nMatthew Niebuhr led the team with 11 tackles including one sack. He also had one fumble recovery. Jennings finished with 10.5 tackles and two interceptions. Kash Rossiter and Max Huston each had 4.5 tackles. Robison and Garret Baker each had an interception. \nWenke’s final line for Van Buren was 12-29 for 125 yards and four picks. Roberts ran for 39 yards and a score on 13 attempts and also caught two passes for five yards. \nMertens was the leading receiver with five catches for 55 yards. Robert Barker had four receptions and 54 yards, and Tommy Laughlin had two catches for 17 yards. \nW-MU (8-0 overall, 6-0 in district play) will face off with Pekin (7-1, 6-0) for the Class A Division 6 championship on Friday in Winfield. Van Buren (0-8, 0-6) will face Cardinal (0-8, 0-6) for seventh place in the district.
