We’re not really happy with the performance but winning puts us in a good position,” Hart told the club website. \n“We were really disjointed, like in the past couple of Premier League games, we had a good half and a bad half. \n“I think we deserved to win. We profited when they were a little bit tired at the end. They made a few mistakes and we kept our quality,” he added. \nHart, 28, also praised Aguero, who was the top goal-scorer in the Premier League last season, saying that the Argentine can score almost at will. \n“We left it late but Kun’s a cool guy and no matter whether he’s in form or not, he will score,” the England international said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T06:39:43.416+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
