The Tigers now have three premier commitments at the linebacker position in Texas standouts Erick Fowler and Rahssan Thornton , to go with Divinity, and Karr defensive end Andre Anthony , who has the skillset to stand up as well, if needed.\nDivinity has been a top target for LSU and recruiting coordinator Frank Wilson since his sophomore season, and the diligence of its staffers paid huge dividends Sunday night, with his declaration.\nThere are still needs for others, though, primarily inside linebackers, and the LSU staff is vigorously working to round out the class. As for what Divinity brings to the table, let's take a closer look at the 6-foot-2, 220-pound prospect.\nMichael Divinity breakdown:\nIt is hard to find true, three-down linebackers, but Divinity certainly fits the bill. Whether he is covering running backs out of the backfield, manned up over slot receivers, coming off of the edge as a blitzer, or reading and reacting in the run game, Divinity makes plays all over the field.\nHis fluidity and acceleration are elite for a linebacker, and he utilizes those attributes to make plays that no other linebacker in the region can make. There is very little this young man can not do, and his game should translate very well at the next level.\nLSU's recruiting board impact:\nThis all but ends the Tigers' pursuit of outside linebackers, but they still have a need for middle linebackers, with many possible suitors in play. The talented Alabama duo of Lyndell Wilson and Ben Davis remain top targets, as is Texas standout Dontavious Jackson , but it does not look like LSU currently leads for those prospects, although they are in striking distance.\nThe most likely candidate right now may be IMG Academy's Rahshaun Smith , who is expected to take a visit to LSU this weekend. The Tigers have a huge need at the position, and Smith has given an array of positive feedback to LSU coaches in recent months. I am expecting the Tigers to emerge as the frontrunner for his services after his visit this weekend.\nWith his announcement on Sunday night, Divinity instantly became one of the most important prospects in LSU's class. If they can land one of the premier inside linebacker candidates they are pursuing, they will be delighted to have filled a glaring position of need, with a contingent of elite-level prospects. Divinity is the 19th public commitment in the 2016 class, a class that is ranked as one of the premier groups in the country.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T01:16:49.106+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
