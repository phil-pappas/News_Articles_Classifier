The Hawks improved to 3-1 on the season with a 34-14 victory, dropping the Riders to 1-3. St. Georges Tech dominated CR on the ground, rushing for over 400 yards with three different running backs finding the end-zone. They used 21 first-half points to jump ahead early, and were able to fight off Rider rallies in the second half to preserve their third-straight victory. The Hawks closed out the first quarter with a 7-0 lead thanks to a Gary Brightwell touchdown from 18-yards out to open the scoring Thursday night. St. Georges Tech increased their lead to double-digits before the end of the first half, scoring twice in the second quarter. Both touchdowns came courtesy of Warren Henderson who found the end-zone for the first time off a six-yard run before breaking off a 33-yard rush for a score. At the break, the Hawks held a commanding 21-0 lead. The Riders made it a two-score game to start the second half when Brian Lewis scored from two-yards out, though CR’s extra point try failed. The Hawks responded with a score of their own on a one-yard score from Logan Gilbert to make it 28-6 St. Georges Tech after three quarters. Caesar Rodney kicked off the scoring in the fourth when Jared Wagenhoffer found Bailey DeAtley on a 10-yard hook-up, followed by a Walters rush for the two point conversion which once again cut the Hawks’ lead to two scores at 28-14. Though, later in the quarter Gilbert joined backfield mate Henderson scoring his second touchdown on the night, wrapping it up for St. Georges Tech. The Hawks look to make it four wins in a row when they travel to McKean next Friday night. » STAY INFORMED", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T12:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T12:28:34.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
