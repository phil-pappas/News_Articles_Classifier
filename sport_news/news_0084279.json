Looking at the statistics about Kennesaw State and Gardner-Webb’s Big South Conference struggle Saturday, you’d quickly realize they didn’t make much sense. On one hand, the host Owls (5-1, 1-0 league) kept the football, piled up most of the yardage and came away with a 12-7 victory in their first league game ever. On the Runnin’ Bulldogs side, the defensive unit didn’t allow a touchdown and the ‘Dogs were at the Kennesaw 6 on the game’s final play but had their hopes dashed with an interception as time ran out. KSU’s option attack – right out of the Georgia Tech/Wofford vein – chewed up the clock and kept Gardner-Webb’s offense off the field. In fact, one 19-play drive that carried over into the fourth period ran more than 10 minutes off the clock. GWU’s time of possession in the first three quarters of the game didn’t amount to what the Owls ran off on that one series. Gardner-Webb, coming off its best offensive performance of the year in its upset win over Liberty, couldn’t move the ball in the first half. The ‘Dogs didn’t have a third-down conversion before halftime. KSU meanwhile made four Justin Thompson field goals, none longer than 33 yards, stand up for the victory. Thompson’s third field goal, from 26 yards out with 13:47 left in the game, pushed the Owls to a 9-0 lead. It came after GWU thought it had stopped the hosts on a fourth-down incompletion, but a roughing the passer call allowed KSU to make it a two-score game. GWU responded with its first serious offensive movement of the game as Rob Howard returned the kickoff toe the Owls’ 42. But quarterback Tyrell Maxwell was dropped for a loss on a fourth-and-one play at the KSU 21 to end the threat. After a punt, GWU went on a 58-yard touchdown march with Josh Bettista punching in from the one with 5:53 left to cut it to 9-7. The tired Runnin’ Bulldogs defense though gave up two crucial third-down conversions before stopping the Owls at the 14. Thompson’s fourth field goal pushed the margin to 12-7. GWU got it at the 40 after a short kickoff and marched against the clock. Maxwell had key rushes of 21 and 11 yards plus had a 22-yard connection to Jacob Henderson on fourth-and-10 from the Owls’ 28. That gave GWU four pass plays at the KSU 6 with 19 seconds to go but the ‘Dogs were turned away.
