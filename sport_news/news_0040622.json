Christian Petersen/Getty Images/AFP Sidney Crosby doesn't believe Phil Kessel has 'character issues' \nGLENDALE, Ariz. -- Mike Smith took a shot to the head in the first period. By the third period, he was doing the splits to turn away the Pittsburgh Penguins. \nSmith shook off a hard collision to stop 27 shots, Jordan Martinook scored his first career NHL goal and the Arizona Coyotes withstood a late flurry to beat the Penguins 2-1 on Saturday night. \n\"He's just in a groove, stopping everything,\" Coyotes coach Dave Tippett said of Smith. \nSmith was injured in the first period after being run into by teammate Brad Richardson, who was shoved from behind by Pittsburgh's Patric Hornqvist. Smith lay on the ice for a couple minutes, but stayed in and made some big saves down the stretch, including one while doing a split to stop Nick Bonino from close range. Smith has stopped 67 of 69 shots in two games. \nTobias Rieder also scored for the Coyotes, who have won their first two games for the first time since 2009-10. Arizona beat the Los Angeles Kings and Pittsburgh in consecutive games both seasons. \n\"It felt like a playoff game out there with all the energy,\" Smith said. \"We just sort of picked up where we left off.\" \nMarc-Andre Fleury nearly matched Smith, stopping 37 shots, and Phil Kessel scored his first goal with Pittsburgh. But just like they did in Thursday's season opener, the Penguins had trouble getting pucks to go into the net. Pittsburgh has two goals on 55 shots through two games, both losses.

Max Domi had a goal and an assist in his NHL debut and Smith was superb in goal, turning away 40 shots. \nThe Coyotes had a short turnaround before playing their home opener against Pittsburgh, one of the NHL's most talented offensive teams. \nBut for all their firepower, the Penguins fell flat in their opener, losing 3-0 at Dallas on Thursday. Kessel, Pittsburgh's latest sharpshooter, took six shots, but Sidney Crosby failed to get one off and the Penguins failed in 37 attempts against Antti Niemi. \nThe first period had plenty of shots by both teams, but no goals. \nThose came in rapid succession in the second period. \nRieder scored early after the Penguins knocked the puck into their own zone to negate an offside on Arizona. Anthony Duclair gathered the puck off the backboards and wrapped a pass around the goal to the slot, where Rieder one-timed a shot past Fleury. \nThe Penguins answered 17 seconds later, when Kessel scooped up a neutral-zone turnover by Shane Doan and beat Smith to the stick side. \nMartinook put the Coyotes back up midway through the period, punching the puck past Fleury after a wild scramble in front that included five players hitting the ice at one point. \n\"My goal was just a scrap at the net and I just shovelled into the goal,\" Martinook said. \"It's not pretty, but that's what we've got to do.\" \nThe Penguins cranked up the offensive pressure in the third period, peppering Smith with one shot after another. \nHe made one tough save after another, including several during a flurry midway through, the highlight his stretch to get Bonino's shot with his pad. \n\"We were able to generate some good chances later on, but it just took too long to generate those chances,\" Crosby said. \nNotes: Pittsburgh D Olli Maatta played in his 100th career NHL game. ...
