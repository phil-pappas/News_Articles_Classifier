CU hosts No. 1 USC on Friday night and No. 12 UCLA on Sunday. ( Mark Leffingwell / Staff Photographer ) \nIt hasn't occurred very often. Just twice, in fact. \nAnd both times, Nicole Edelman was in the gym. \nThe CU volleyball team's senior setter has fond memories of those two nights when the Buffaloes managed to knock off the nation's No. 1-ranked team. Two years ago she was a key component of an upset against Washington, putting up 46 assists. \nThe first time the Buffaloes pulled off that feat, Edelman was an impressionable 12-year-old fan, urging CU on from the stands. \n\"I actually was here in 2006 when CU beat Nebraska when they were No. 1. I was just a little girl,\" said Edelman, a Boulder native and a graduate of Fairview. \"I think it's amazing that we're still able to continue that and have these memories at Coors.\" \nCU will take its latest shot at the nation's No. 1-ranked volleyball team on Friday night, as the resurgent Buffs host USC at 8 p.m. \nThe Buffaloes have gone 2-14 overall against No. 1-ranked teams in the 30-year history of the program, posting 11 consecutive losses before that 2006 win against Nebraska. CU suffered two losses against No. 1 Stanford last season but had the Cardinal on the ropes at home, surging to a 2-1 lead before Stanford rallied. \n\"It's a lot of fun and a lot of people aren't able to do that. We've been lucky enough to do it almost every year that I've been here,\" Edelman said. \"It's a great opportunity and really fun volleyball. (The 2013 Washington game) is something I'll never forget. I actually still get chills thinking about it. It's a really special moment you can share with that team, and I want everyone on this team to experience that.\" Advertisement \nCU is coming off the sort of victory that can change the fortunes of a season, rallying from a two-set deficit to defeat then-No. 22 Oregon on the road. The Buffs polished off Oregon State with a sweep two days later, surviving a 25-23 decision in the second set and giving CU a commendable 2-2 mark overall in an opening run of Pac-12 Conference games played entirely on the road. \n\"It meant a lot to get us on the right track and show us our hard work is finally paying off,\" CU senior Alexis Austin said. \"I feel like on Sunday (at Oregon State) we really came together more as a team, especially that second set. That second set brought back memories of our old selves and we said we had to stop doing this. That third set we played defense all-out and did a good job. I definitely think that should carry over to this weekend.\" \nCU welcomes a USC squad that has put together a perfect 16-0 start and is one of two teams to begin league play 4-0. The Trojans have posted victories against No. 6 Washington, No. 7 Stanford, No. 12 UCLA, No. 15 BYU and No. 20 Kentucky. USC boasts one of the nation's top players in senior Samantha Bricio, who leads the nation in points per set (6.3) and aces per set (0.81). \n\"USC is playing really well and is clearly the No. 1-ranked team,\" CU coach Liz Kritza said. \"It's well-deserved. They score at a high clip. They play a lot of good defense. Their blocking is strong. They have arguably the best server in the country (Bricio). \n\"But at the end of the day, they're a volleyball team. We're not playing the reputation. We're not playing the ranking. On any given night, you play it your best and that's the beauty of the Pac-12. Anybody can beat anybody.\" \nThe weekend doesn't get any easier for the Buffs, who host No. 12 UCLA at noon on Sunday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T02:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:48:03.729+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
