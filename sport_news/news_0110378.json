But even he had to crack a smile. Stagg, after learning it was Norton’s birthday on Friday – he's in his 50s, though he won’t say his exact age – circled around Norton and belted the “Happy Birthday” song. After all, the Delta Kings had delivered him the dream gift, a 56-50 upset win, and a pivotal one in the San Joaquin Athletic Association, over McNair on the road. Yet, it didn’t come easy. And the night provided some astounding statistics. With that, here’s a “By the Numbers” look at the wild SJAA showdown that was: • 0: There wasn’t a single punt in the game between the Delta Kings and Eagles. McNair even went for a 4th and 2 from its own 9-yard line late in the first half, as quarterback Osai Brown ran for a first down. Turns out, the Eagles made the right call, and scored a touchdown to take a 28-20 lead heading into intermission. • 25: According to multiple sources, McNair senior wide receiver Derrion Grim has tied the California record with 25 regular-season touchdown receptions. And he has three games remaining to break the record, if not shatter it. Grim posted eight catches for 147 yards and three scores Friday. He's got a legitimate chance at the overall single-season TD reception, set by Folsom's Cole Thompson at 34 last season, according to CalHiSports.com . • 106: While one media outlet predicted Stagg and McNair would total 70 points on a neutral field, and I thought they’d push 90 for this game, the actual total surpassed those offensive dreams: at 106 combined points. McNair has totaled 50 points exactly in both of its losses this year – to Modesto-Downey (61-50) and Stagg (56-50). • 1,109: The Delta Kings and Eagles posted a combined 1,109 yards of offense. A surprise, to me at least, were the 610 rushing yards combined between the teams. McNair had a supreme balance, with 276 yards passing, and 276 rushing, according to MaxPreps.com . • 8: Stagg senior quarterback Lavante Bushnell was a man possessed, with eight touchdowns. Seven of them were passing, including four to 6-foot-4 senior Michael Thompson. The last, though, was an 8-yard rushing score, where Bushnell extended for the pylon and the game-winner. • 24: Remember the whole zero punts thing? Well, that happened despite a combined 24 possessions in the game. • 28: In a game defined by offense, Delta Kings senior linebacker Jonathan Phillips had a mind of his own. Phillips, Stagg’s returning tackles leader, racked up 28 total tackles. CLASS OF 2014 TRACKER Cornwell changes roles for Dartmouth Remember Jordan Cornwell, the kills machine from St. Mary’s volleyball and our defending co-All-Area Player of the Year with Lincoln’s Makyla Elias? Well, she’s playing for Ivy League’s Dartmouth College volleyball, but has traded powerful kills for solid defense. Cornwell, one of the Big Green's most-used players, is now a libero, and has 92 digs this season. POWER RANKINGS My prep power rankings return for large- and small-school football, and volleyball.
