The Bulldogs will need Perez�s offense against Mohave at 7 tonight in Bullhead City. (JC AMBERLYN/Miner) Shawn Byrne   The losing streak may be at seven games, but nobody with the Kingman High Bulldogs is ready to surrender the season.\"We're bummed there are only two games left,\" said KHS football coach Greg Tonjes. \"We're positive going into tonight just like we have been every week.\"Kingman (1-7, 0-5) plays at Mohave (3-5, 3-2) in a Division IV, Section III game at 7 p.m. today in Bullhead City. The Bulldogs are coming off of a 49-14 loss to Kingman Academy last week, and Mohave took down Lee Williams, 27-20.\"We're a little different this week,\" Tonjes said. \"We're going to go in and compete. We're young, and we've gotten younger.\"The coach expects more of his younger players to get some action on the field against the T-birds.Defensively, the Bulldogs must find a way to stop the run if they are going to earn their second win of the season. Academy ran for 410 yards last week, and Mohave is no slouch in the running game.The T-birds are led by Jason Urquiza, a 5-foot-8, 190-pound senior running back. Though no comprehensive stats are available for Mohave, last week against Lee Williams Urquiza scored three touchdowns on runs of 27 and five yards, and a 28-yard reception. He had another run for 50 yards that was stopped prior to the end zone.\"We just haven't been very good at stopping the run,\" Tonjes said. \"We've changed our defense this week. The reality we've learned as coaches is that we can't play for the guys. We've showed them hundreds of times how to do things, and they need to take it and go play.\"Kingman will lean mostly on senior running back Isiah Perez. He has rushed for 659 yards and five touchdowns this season for the Bulldogs.\"We're good and ready,\" Tonjes said. \"The weather messed us up a little, but we had a decent week of practice.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T16:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T06:26:36.950+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
