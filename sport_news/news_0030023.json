The semifinal district matchup seemed all wrapped as Nixa led Kickapoo 6-2 going into the last inning, but the Lady Chiefs’ and their never-say-die attitude were able to string together six consecutive hits to put up the five runs and keep their season alive. \n“We got a couple free passes and some momentum on our side and then we had some quality at bats along the way,” said Kickapoo coach Jason Howser.

Crucial hitting from the Lady Chiefs’ batting order propelled Kickapoo to the walk-off win. Kaitlyn Elmer loaded the bases with a hit up the middle, and Megan Tiede’s hit just over second base brought in the first run of the inning and got the Kickapoo momentum going. Kickapoo starting pitcher Kalli Carter brought in two runners to score and Heidi Facklam brought in the remaining two runs to win the game.“[Kalli] had been anxious all night. I didn’t think she had some real good at bats and she was kind of pressing and trying to do too much. She settled in a little bit and got a pitch to hit, and hit the ball hard to keep us going,” said Howser. “And then of course Heidi Facklam stepped up in a big situation and hit that ball hard to right center.”“It’s crazy. When I was hitting I wasn’t thinking at all. I swung the bat and it scored two runs,” said Facklam. “I think we had each other’s backs when things got bad and we always picked each other up, and hit after hit we kept rallying. The atmosphere from this game is definitely something I’ll remember.” Nixa coach Matt Walker said he believes his team played well but once Kickapoo started to rally, his team couldn’t put a stop to it.“I really can’t complain about the way we played,” said Nixa coach Matt Walker. “I thought we played well. We picked up six runs, but Kickapoo battled. They didn’t give up.” Up until the seventh inning clutch Kickapoo hitting, it was all Nixa as they amassed six runs from six hits and several Kickapoo errors. Nixa scored two runs in the first inning, two in the third and two more in the top of the seventh.“I thought we played tight most of the night and I thought we started pressing a little bit at the plate when we got down. I think a lot of it had to do with girls trying to do too much and not just their part,” said Howser. After Thursday’s dramatic win, Kickapoo will face four-time defending district champion Ozark in the District 11 championship game at 5 p.m. on Friday at Kickapoo.
