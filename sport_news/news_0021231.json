The Blue Jays even said they were playing the game under protest.

I went, 'Wait a minute, wait a minute, there's no intent on the hitter.' If there's no intent, if he's not out of the box, that throw is live.\" \nScott said the play itself is not reviewable, explaining that the umpires were reviewing the rule, not the play, when they went to the video. \nAccording to rule Major League Baseball rule 6.03(a)(3), the batter is not to be charged with interfering with the catcher if the batter is still in the batter's box and doesn't make a movement to block or disrupt the throw.

After a delay of 2 minutes, 32 seconds, the play stood and fans continued to throw objects on the field. \n\"I was walking off the field and a tall boy (beer) came right by me,\" Gibbons said. \"I didn't know if they were (upset) the at the situation or just me personally. Probably both.\" \nToronto Mayor John Tory tweeted, \"Don't hurt each other or our city over this. We can prove ourselves in more ways than one. #ComeTogether\" A grounds crew member collects beer cans thrown on to the field after the Texas Rangers scored a run during the seventh inning in Game 5 of baseball's American League Division Series, Wednesday, Oct. 14, 2015 in Toronto.

Dalton Pompey slid hard into catch Chris Gimemez, who was standing on home plate. Umpires upheld the ruling. \nBut after Sam Dyson replaced Cole Hamels, Josh Donaldson drove in a run on a forceout and Jose Bautista hit a long homer to put Toronto up 6-3. \nWhen on-deck batter Edwin Encarcion turned to the crowd and gestured for them to stop throwing objects on field, Dyson misunderstood Encarnacion's actions and the players had words, causing the benches to clear. \nTwenty police officers lined the outfield and many more were stationed down the lines during the delay. \nBenches cleared a second time after Troy Tulowitzki popped out foul to end the inning. \nThe Toronto Police Service also posted a tweet during the melee. \"The actions you take will not affect the outcome of the game, only effect the perception of #Toronto,\" it read. \"Keep classy Toronto.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T07:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T10:17:56.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
