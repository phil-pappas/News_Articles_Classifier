That was good enough for fourth place overall, seven shots behind champion Drew Miles, a senior from North Shore Country Day. \nAccolades aside, Marshall calmly and routinely credited the presence of his coaches, Mark Meyer and assistant Ken Neahring, as well as junior teammate Brett Glennon, who tied for 57th with a 169. \n\"It is nice to be a freshman and be able to go to state like this, but I can't take all the credit for it,\" Marshall said. \"The coaches really fixed a lot of my game, and being around the varsity players really fine-tuned me for the competition level.\" \nIn the team race, St. Francis placed second with a 638, trailing only champion Morton (615) in the 12-team field. The Spartans earned their top 2A finish in program history, continuing to climb after taking eighth in 2013 and fifth last season. \nSenior Jonathan Nocek, whose two-day 150 tied for seventh individually, is a veteran of all three state trips alongside classmate Connor Buckley (173). Sophomore Luke Armbrust, who followed Nocek with a 154, competed with the 2014 team. \n\"We've had a lot of experience coming into the week,\" Spartans coach Greg Baresel said. \"They know the golf course, they've played summer tournaments down here. I think that really pays off. The teams that have been down here before really do well, and I think that made a big difference.\" \nMarshall credited a calmness for helping him prevail. Entering the day tied for seventh overall, he seized the urgency after playing the front nine at 2-over par. Three consecutive birdies followed, and then a fourth on the fifth hole of the back side. \n\"It really hit me, you know: 'I'm only 2-over, but 2-over's not going to get it done,' \" Marshall said. \"I started making lot more putts. I was leaving myself less feet on the approach shots. I couldn't stop there, so I started making the putts.\" \nMarshall said he benefited from a \"fade-friendly\" course that helped him guide approach shots. A double bogey on No. 16 cooled his momentum, as he played the final three holes at 3-over. \nBurlington Central's Joe Sherman shot a 174, placing 84th. \nIn the Class 3A meet at The Den at Fox Creek in adjacent Bloomington, Geneva placed 12th in the program's first state trip as a team since 1989. The Vikings finished with a two-day 686; champion Hinsdale Central fired a 621. \nAndrew Abel (163), Tyler Isenhart (169), Jack McDonald (178) and Hudson Traylor (180) were the team's aggregate top scorers. Only senior J.T. Kruzich will graduate from the 2015 state team. \nEdwardsville's Justin Hemings was individual medalist with a 1-over par 145 for 36 holes. St. Charles East sophomore Danny Buetow tied for 39th with a 161. Marmion junior Nick Huggins shot 166, tying for 60th. \nIn 1A competition at Prairie Vista in Bloomington, Aurora Christian junior Devin Johnson, a Geneva resident, tied for 15th with a 162. That score was 13 strokes behind St. Edward senior Michael Mattas, the individual medalist.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T15:58:11.450+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
