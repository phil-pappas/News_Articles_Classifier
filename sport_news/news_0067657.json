Signal photo by Dan Watson \nIn writing it’s called a lead or a hook, or whatever you want to call a story’s beginning as long as it grabs the reader’s attention and yanks them deeper into the text. \nThe first clip on Nick Presley’s 2014 highlight tape is spellbinding. \nThe then-junior offensive guard drives a linebacker back for 15 yards before depositing him on his rear, allowing the Hart High ball carrier to scamper nearly untouched into the end zone. \nJust another day at the office for the “big, mean guy up front,” in the words of Hart junior quarterback Nick Moore. \nBeyond the ferocity and flat-out ability is a mild-mannered joker, a quick-thinking strategist and a guy meant — even destined — for the offensive line. \nAnd not just any line: specifically the one in Newhall. The one that needed one final piece in 2013 and a stabilizing force in 2015. \nNeedless to say, Presley’s delivered. \n“If he doesn’t know what he’s doing then nobody does,” Moore says of Presley, now Hart’s starting center. “But he always knows what he’s doing.” \nThat’s been especially crucial this season, a five-game span in which Hart has already used roughly nine different offensive linemen due, in part, to a knee issue that sidelined NCAA Division I talent Colby Pursell for the first four games (the left tackle returned against Ventura last week). \nBut at the center of it all — literally — has been Presley, who’s started every game. \nThe 6-foot-2-inch, 260-pound senior transitioned seamlessly from guard to center this season (he did play some center last year and as a freshman) and has already earned the praise and faith of his team in his ability to make protection calls — even in the just handful of seconds from the time the play is hollered out to the moment Moore initiates the Indians’ no-huddle offense. \nPresley’s handle on the position has allowed him to help put younger substitute linemen in positions for success. \n“He’s almost like a second coach on the field,” Moore says. \nAnd the Indians have hardly missed a beat. Through four wins and a heartbreaking, controversial loss to highly-touted St. Bonaventure, the Indians have run for a Foothill League-leading 183.2 yards per game, up more than 50 yards from last season. \nThat’s given Hart the balance it hoped for in replacing the dynamic quarterback-wide receiver duo of Brady White and Trent Irwin from a year ago. \nThe rushing ability of Moore and running back Nelson James has been crucial, but it’d be hard not to credit the Presley-led offensive line. \n“What (Presley has) done really well this year — better than most years — is he’s blocking at the next level,” says Hart head coach Mike Herrington. “You have the front four and then the linebackers, and he’s doing a much better job of blocking at the second level of the defense.” \nThis season isn’t the first time Presley’s been in the right spot at the right time for Hart. \nIn 2013, he transferred from Crespi High of Encino to a Hart team in need of a left guard. \nPresley stepped in and, without giving him too much glory, the rest — namely Hart’s 2013 CIF-Southern Section Northern Division title — is history. \n“They embraced me like a family, and it couldn’t have been better,” Presley says of joining the Indians. \nThat atmosphere provides a snapshot of what Presley loves most about playing offensive line. \n“Just that you have five brothers that have your back every single play — just the chemistry and the bond that I made. That’s what I really, really appreciate,” he says. \nBut maybe equal to that, the position seems to run in his blood. \nPresley’s dad, Steve, played guard in high school. \nHis uncle, Jeff, played center. His uncle, Greg, played tackle. \nAnd his cousin, Clay, suited up for the University of Memphis as ... a lineman. \n“He’s been a lineman his whole life,” Steve says of Nick. “Our family are linemen. We can play the game without a ball for the most part.” \nThe Presleys moved to the Santa Clarita Valley from Chesapeake, Va., when Nick was 4, and he took up football around the time he was 7. \nHe loved the game, and he loved to play. \nThat sometimes meant pulling his jersey over his head while snapping the ball, Steve says, or at other times assuming a bizarre stance on extra point tries or employing a goofy running style on laps. \n“He was always messing around, trying to joke,” Steve says. \nThat easy-going quality proved handy in keeping teammates loose around the St. Bonaventure game, Steve says. But it hardly precludes Presley from getting after it. \nFor example: he put on roughly 20 pounds between his sophomore and junior seasons. \n“He lifts like crazy,” Steve says. “I don’t want to misquote his numbers. He’s got crazy high numbers on the weightlifting.” \nAsked about Presley’s best playing traits, Herrington agreed, “His aggressiveness, his blocks, his technique. He has good strength.” \nOne coach, Steve says, told Presley he should consider giving up football for weightlifting competitions and a run at the Olympics. \nPresley has stayed with football — helping drive Hart toward a possible Foothill League title 1 yard at a time. \nOr maybe in chunks of 15.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T08:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T09:44:51.411+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
