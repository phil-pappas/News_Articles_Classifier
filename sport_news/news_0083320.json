By Associated Press (0) Comments \nPhiladelphia — In a sloppy game, the Philadelphia Eagles prevailed because they made fewer mistakes. \nDeMarco Murray ran for 109 yards and a touchdown, Nolan Carroll returned one of Eli Manning's two interceptions for a score and the Eagles beat the New York Giants, 27-7, Monday night. \nSam Bradford threw for 280 yards and a 32-yard TD pass to Riley Cooper, but Bradford had three interceptions to keep New York in the game. \nThe Eagles (3-3) have won two straight to move from last place in the NFC East into a tie for first with the Giants (3-3). The teams meet again in Week 17. \nNeither team was sharp. They combined for seven turnovers and 21 penalties. \nThe Giants gave the Eagles first downs on a roughing-the-passer penalty and a running-into-the-kicker penalty to keep both of their TD drives going. \nWearing all-black uniforms for the third time in franchise history, the Eagles got off to a slow start. \nManning completed his first 10 passes, including a 13-yard TD pass to Odell Beckham Jr. for a 7-0 lead. \nBut things went downhill for Manning from there. \nThe Eagles took a 14-7 lead in the second quarter when Carroll jumped in front of a pass intended for Dwayne Harris and ran it back for his first career TD. \nAfter Nikita Whitlock ran into punter Donnie Jones to give Philadelphia a first down at its 28, Murray took over. He had two runs of 11 yards each and finished off the drive with a 12-yard TD run to give Philadelphia a 24-7 lead in the third quarter. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
