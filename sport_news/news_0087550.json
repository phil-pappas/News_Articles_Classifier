Some of them lied to you and said they did,” said Maurice. “I don't think either team really likes each other. It's a function of us being neck-and-neck with them in the standings and scratching and clawing and playing five times.\n“That will be the story (Sunday).”\nMaurice is probably right.\nPlayers and coaches may have long memories, but cooler heads usually prevail in these instances and true rivalries only go to the next level after teams meet during the Stanley Cup playoffs with some regularity.\n“We've seen them a ton, they're always tight games,” said Jets centre Bryan Little. “It's grown over the past few years, playing them a lot more and having them in our division. It's definitely a game you circle on your calendar and look forward to.”\nThere are also four members of the Jets with ties to Minnesota.\n“It's another team that we have to battle with every time we play them,” said Jets defenceman Dustin Byfuglien. “It's one of those division games that is a hard game to play.”\nJets centre Mark Scheifele provided his own theory about why the rivalry with the Wild is growing.\n“They're close (in proximity) and in the respective buildings, there's a bit of both fan bases (in the crowd),” said Scheifele. “Obviously, we both play similar styles as well. The last few years, there have been some intense games and big games that both teams have won.\n“They're a good team, we're a good team. We get ramped up to play against them, for sure. It's going to be exciting and we're ready for it.”\nMichael Hutchinson made the start in goal against the Wild during the pre-season game in Minnesota and he was mercy-pulled after giving up six goals on 18 shots.\nHutchinson is 2-0 this season with a gaudy 1.00 goals against average and .968 save percentage after making starts against the New Jersey Devils and New York Rangers.\nAlthough Maurice wasn't ready to confirm that Hutchinson would be in net, based on the drills at the end of Saturday's workout, it's a good bet the Jets backup will be making his third start of the campaign.\nSince the Wild faced the Anaheim Ducks on Saturday, backup Darcy Kuemper is expected to give Devan Dubnyk the day off.\nAt the end of the day, revenge won't even register on the priority list for the Jets on Sunday afternoon.\nThey've dropped two games in a row and need to take advantage of a Wild team that is playing on consecutive days.\nWith three games left on this season-long homestand, the only thing that matters to the Jets is finding a way to get back on track before heading on the road for a difficult stretch that will see them play nine of the next 10 games away from the MTS Centre.\nken.wiebe@sunmedia.ca\nTwitter.com/WiebeSunSports\nJets, Wild set to renew heated rivalry\nBy Ken Wiebe , Winnipeg Sun First posted: Saturday, October 24, 2015 05:49 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 24, 2015 10:19 PM EDT\nReady to reach the boiling point or just a false alarm?\nIt won't take much longer to find out.\nThe last time the Winnipeg Jets and Minnesota Wild got together – though it was only the pre-season – both head coaches were firing thinly-veiled salvos at one another.\nJets head coach Paul Maurice was clearly upset that Mike Yeo had his first power-play unit out on the ice in an obvious blowout against a lineup that was filled with guys who eventually were sent down to the minors.\nAbout the author Ken Wiebe Ken Wiebe's Blog Follow Ken Wiebe on Twitter Other Stories Lightning strikes in overtime as Winnipeg Jets fall\nOvertime was wide open and the Tampa Bay Lightning made their best chance count.\n0\nWinnipeg Jets rookie Nikolaj Ehlers looks to build on his strong start\nSo far, Nikolaj Ehlers is living up to his advance billing.\n0\nSee more from Ken Wiebe »\n Hockey Lightning centre Steven Stamkos' future up in the air 0\nOilers Pakarinen gets his look 0\nOttawa Senators suffer late-game meltdown, fall 4-1 to Coyotes ", "external_links": ["http://blogs.canoe.ca/thebrawl/", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=228633661&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://twitter.com/@WiebeSunSports", "http://Twitter.com/WiebeSunSports", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182027221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=183052021&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB", "http://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/clk?id=182024221&iu=/3081/SMCO_ENUR_TSUN_EN_WEB"], "published": "2015-10-25T04:49:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:34:41.958+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
