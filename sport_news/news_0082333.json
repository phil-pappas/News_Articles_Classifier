That wasn't necessarily the case toward the end of his tenure as coach of the New Jersey Devils. \nDeBoer will be coaching his first game at the Prudential Center since he was let go by the Devils the day after Christmas last year, as the unbeaten Sharks face winless New Jersey on Friday. \nThe Devils were 12-17-7 and in seventh place in the Metropolitan Division when DeBoer was fired and later replaced by Adam Oates and Scott Stevens. New Jersey went 20-19-7 after DeBoer was gone, but won just once in its last 11 games and finished 13th in the Eastern Conference, 18 points out of a playoff spot. \n\"You're always looking, when you're in that spot and you step away, what you could have done better,\" said DeBoer, adding that the Devils' losing skid to end the year, \"just told me that, you know, that team just wasn't good enough. That's the bottom line.\" \nDeBoer reiterated he does not have any regrets working for former Devils president and general manager Lou Lamoriello, adding that he was proud of the way the players competed right up until he was fired. Lamoriello left the Devils in July to become the GM of the Toronto Maple Leafs. \nThe Devils had numerous injuries to an aging roster last season. In December alone, the players on injured reserve included Travis Zajac, Mike Cammalleri, Adam Larsson and Dainius Zubrus. Advertisement \nDeBoer didn't think he was made to be a scapegoat by the team, saying he understood everyone's frustration. After the Devils went to the Stanley Cup final in 2011-12, they failed to make it to the postseason the next two years and were tracking in that direction in his final season. \n\"(Lamoriello) makes no apologies for the fact that we weren't rebuilding, the expectation was that we were going to win,\" DeBoer said. \"We weren't good enough to win most nights. That's what happens when expectations aren't met.\" \nIt's a small sample size, but the Sharks have met or exceeded most expectations, although they may have been dealt a serious blow when center Logan Couture was injured in practice Thursday. The Sharks are likely going to release more information on Couture's injury Friday. \nThe Sharks have adjusted well to DeBoer's system. They have nine players with at least one goal, and have allowed just one goal in their first three games mainly due to a standout performance by goalie Martin Jones. \n\"I think (DeBoer's) a tremendous coach,\" said John MacLean, who played 934 games with New Jersey over 14 years, is an NHL Network analyst and does pre- and postgame work of Devils games for MSG Networks. \n\"Sometimes, you don't always have the horses that you need to play the way you want to. I think he's in a good position now in San Jose.\" \nJones has been an obvious standout, as his goals against average (0.33) and save percentage (.987) rank first in the NHL among goalies who have played at least two games. DeBoer said Thursday afternoon he did not know who would be his starting goalie against the Devils, as the Sharks play the New York Islanders on Saturday in their first back-to-back games of the season. \n\"It looks like he has a nice calmness to his game in the net. He moves well,\" MacLean said. \"He's not crazy in there. He's just very comfortable in the net. \n\"There's not a lot of turmoil going on right now. Everybody's happy and just wants to play.\" \nDeBoer said he didn't feel awkward or nervous as he entered his former arena Thursday, partly because there are several new faces on the Devils' roster and in their organization. \n\"I choose for my memories to be the real good ones here. Beating the Rangers in the Eastern Conference finals and going to the Stanley Cup,\" DeBoer said. \"I really felt, even until the last game I coached here, that the group didn't quit. They competed and gave me what they had right until the end. That's all you can ask for.\" For more on the Sharks, see the Working the Corners blog at blogs.mercurynews.com/sharks .
