He tends to get better as the game wears on.\" On Sean White: \"The way the game turned, he did everything we asked him to do. ... He managed the game, the way the unfolded, very well.\" Thinks Kerryon Johnson did well in Wildcat. \"I think that's something they'll do very good at.\" On QB decision: \"We're going to take it game-by-game right now.\" Sean has done \"a very nice job\" in two games, Jeremy has \"handled it very well.\" On deciding not to throw vs SJSU: \"We were having success running the football. ... They were doing things out of the ordinary for what they had shown.\" \"We're going to do what the game dictates. If we need to throw for 300 yards\" they're prepared to do that Robert Leff \"did a really good job\" as a tight end. Believes he graded out \"perfectly.\" Says offense running more plays was more to their \"style and preference\" against MSU than SJSU. \"If we win, that's all that mattes right now.\" Thought the receivers \"fought hard\" On Ricardo Louis being more reliable this season: Attributes it to being a senior, work ethic, extra work Peyton Barber \"has the size\" to withstand being a 25-carry per game back", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T07:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T02:29:49.984+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
