Most of us have been together for a while. Every team has some new faces in their lineup and it's something we can all look forward to. Hopefully, we can get off to a good start.” \nDespite being in his 11th NHL campaign, Byfuglien still remembers his first tilt as a member of the Chicago Blackhawks. \n“There weren't too many people in the stands,” said Byfuglien. “It was one of those things where you take it in, but you don't realize (the significance) until later on in your career. It's an honour to be in the league that long.” \nLOOKING BACK \nAs Nikolaj Ehlers and Nic Petan got set to make their NHL debuts on Thursday, it got Adam Lowry thinking about being in their shoes just last October. \nAfter earning one of the final spots on the roster, Lowry experienced a number of exciting firsts, which made me wonder if that debut against the Arizona Coyotes felt like only yesterday or more like a long time ago. \n“It's kind of a bit of both,” said Lowry. “I still have vivid memories from my first game in Phoenix. The emotions and the excitement that were running through my mind. That being said, it feels like a long time ago, as I'm getting ready to start my second full NHL season. I'm excited for that. I look back at that with fond memories, but hopefully, it's going to be a season to remember this year.” \nWEIGHT OF EXPECTATIONS \nLast fall, Jets head coach Paul Maurice went out of his way to focus on the process and not waste a lot of time talking about expectations related to pushing for a playoff spot. \nKnowing how tight things can be in the Central Division, Maurice wanted the focus on the day-to-day rather than the enormity of needing to get to somewhere around 99 points to lock down a spot. \nAlthough he didn't use the word playoffs, it's been implied that the Jets expect themselves to get back for another shot at the playoffs. \n“It's a real interesting division. It's kind of the same story as last year,” said Jets head coach Paul Maurice. “A few teams, like Dallas, brought in some pretty impressive pieces. The Stanley Cup champion (Chicago Blackhawks), St. Louis, all the teams that were really solid last year, think they've gotten better. Everyone expects Colorado to have a stronger, bounce back year. \n“The expectations don't have us toward the top of the list, if you look at most of them, but we have pretty high expectations for our team. And there's some newness as well. We've got a little bit of a different look. We have expectations that we can be a good team based on how we play. What we need to do is establish that style of play as quickly as possible.” \nWhile some predictions have the Jets falling back to the pack, others believe they're on an upward trend and just scratching the surface. \n“We've proven ourselves to some people that we are a team that's going to be hard to play against and it's something we've been building for a while,” said Jets defenceman Mark Stuart. “We've got a long way to go though. I don't think we've quite earned the respect that we can. In order to do that, you've got to string together good seasons and make it past the first round of the playoffs. But it's something to build on. \n“The fun part about it as well is that we're playing against good teams every night and we're always challenging ourselves. Last year, that was huge for us. Seeing Chicago, the eventual Stanley Cup winner, St. Louis and Nashville a lot just made us a better team. And it's not going to get any easier.” \nTHE GRIND AHEAD \nWhile the scheduling oddity sees the Jets play a pair of back-to-backs on the opening road trip with a pair of days off in between, Jets defenceman Mark Stuart saw it as something the players should embrace rather than viewing it as any type of disadvantage. \n“That's the way it goes. You just deal with it,” said Stuart. “You can look at it two ways, as a burden or you get right into it. Rip the Band-Aid off and get going. If you win games, you don't really care.” \nNOTABLE OMMISION \nWhen asked for a memorable opening-night moment, Stuart could only chuckle, recalling an incident at TD Garden when he was a member of the Bruins. \n“I've got a funny memory. When I played here, they forgot to announce my name,” said Stuart. “It's on YouTube and it was pretty good. I always get a laugh out of that. I just waited and then I came out at the end. That was pretty good.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T05:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T09:02:46.120+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
