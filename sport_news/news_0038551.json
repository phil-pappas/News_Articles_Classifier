Brandon Marshall had seven catches for 111 yards, and Eric Decker also caught a TD pass. \nThe Jets, coming off a bye-week break, trailed 13-10 at halftime, with the Redskins (2-4) scoring their points off three turnovers — all by Bashaud Breeland. \nBut New York opened the second half with 24 straight points to take control against a Washington team without several starters, including wide receiver DeSean Jackson, left tackle Trent Williams and cornerbacks DeAngelo Hall and Chris Culliver. \nKirk Cousins was 25 of 43 for 196 yards with a touchdown to Pierre Garcon and two interceptions for the Redskins. He has two interceptions each in four games this season — all losses. Cousins has no INTs in Washington's two wins. \nThe Redskins downgraded Jackson to out Saturday; he hasn't played since the season opener because of a left hamstring injury. Tight end Jordan Reed, center Kory Lichtensteiger and backup running back Matt Jones were also out. \nWith so many injuries, even Robert Griffin III was active — as the Redskins' third-string quarterback — for the first time this season. \nNick Folk tied it at 13 with a 39-yard field goal early in the second half. Two plays later, the Jets got the ball back when Darrelle Revis made an easy interception of Cousins' pass for Ryan Grant. It was Revis' sixth takeaway of the season. \nWith the ball at the Redskins 18, the Jets wasted no time as Fitzpatrick took off up the middle, got a big block from tight end Kellen Davis near the goal line and got into the end zone for a 20-13 lead. \nMarshall made it 26-13 with a terrific fingertips catch just off his shoe tops, getting inside of Breeland on a low throw. He then scooted down the sideline for a 35-yard TD — as Breeland sat on the field with his head in his hands in disbelief. \nNew York got the ball right back when Marcus Gilchrist picked off Cousins' deep pass for Jamison Crowder. Decker caught a 2-yard pass to put the Jets comfortably in front, 34-13 early in the fourth quarter. \nThe Redskins crept closer when Jeron Johnson blocked Ryan Quigley's punt and Rashad Ross recovered in the end zone with just under four minutes left. But Davis recovered the onside kick. \nThe Redskins, starting at the Jets 37 after Breeland recovered Decker's fumble on New York's opening drive, needed seven plays to get into the end zone, capped by Cousins' 2-yard toss to Garcon. The drive was kept alive by Ryan Grant's 6-yard catch on third-and-5 — ending the Jets' streak of consecutive third-down stops at 19. \nNew York came right back, tying it on Ivory's 1-yard run that capped an 11-play, 83-yard drive. \nWashington forced another turnover when Breeland ripped the ball out of Marshall's hands after a 12-yard catch, and Dustin Hopkins kicked a 54-yard field goal to tie it at 10. \nThe Jets turned it over again on their next possession as Fitzpatrick's pass tipped off Marshall's hands and Breeland made a diving interception. Six plays later, Hopkins kicked a 30-yarder for a 13-10 lead. \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T00:58:22.855+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
