Blatter, UEFA president and FIFA vice-president Michel Platini, and FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke (who has already been put on leave) for a duration of 90 days,\" a FIFA statement said. \n\"The duration of the bans may be extended for an additional period not exceeding 45 days.\" \nFormer FIFA vice-president Chung Mong-joon was also banned for six years and fined Swiss Francs 100,000(approximately $103,418). \nThe proceedings against the South Korean football official Mong-joon were opened in January, 2015, based on findings in the report on the investigation into the bidding process for the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cups. \n\"He has been found guilty of infringing article 13 (General rules of conduct), article 16 (Confidentiality), article 18 (Duty of disclosure, cooperation and reporting), article 41 (Obligation of the parties to collaborate) and article 42 (General obligation to collaborate) of the FIFA Code of Ethics,\" the statement added. \n\"During this time, the above individuals are banned from all football activities on a national and international level.
