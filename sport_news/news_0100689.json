By Dennis Knight Richmond Hill’s Brian Hughes had shown flashes of his potential during the season, but on Thursday night everything started clicking for the junior quarterback.\nHughes rushed for 195 yards and five touchdowns on 17 carries and was 7 of 16 passing for 135 yards as Richmond Hill rolled to a 39-14 win over visiting Statesboro. He earned Savannah Morning News player of the week honors for his performance.\n“Brian finally trusted our system,” said Wildcat coach Matt LeZotte, in his first year leading the program. “He doesn’t have to make plays on his own, but they will come when he takes care of himself in our spread, power offense.”\nThe 6-foot-3, 200-pound Hughes is tough for defenders to bring down.\n“He’s got the speed to break away, but when he gets going downhill, he’s a physically imposing runner,” LeZotte said.\nIt was a career-high rushing total for Hughes, who has 365 yards rushing and eight touchdowns for the Wildcats (3-3). He has also completed 35 of 78 passes for 574 yards with five touchdown passes and three interceptions.\nHis biggest play against Statesboro came when he broke loose for a 69-yard touchdown.\n“I’m just trying to take what a defense gives me, make my reads and do everything correctly,” said Hughes, who said he plans to play basketball and baseball this year. “I try to take it north and south when I run, and I feel like I can get a lot of yards after contact with my size.”\nHughes said he admires Carolina’ Cam Newton and tries to model his game after the star quarterback.\n“He’s got a big arm and can make plays with his feet,” Hughes said. “I try to do the same thing.”\nHughes said LeZotte has changed the offense from a triple-option type attack to a system that utilizes the spread formation.\n“I think it’s a lot more difficult for teams to defend against,” Hughes said. “Coach LeZotte has brought a lot of enthusiasm to our team, and we’re playing better.”\nOther top performances:\nTyleek Collins, Benedictine — The sophomore rushed for 201 yards and scored four touchdowns in the Cadets’ win over Jeff Davis.\nJacquez Williams, Liberty County — The senior rushed for 205 yards and two scores in a win over Burke County.\nBryce Dunn, Savannah Country Day — Ran for a 55-yard touchdown and hit Chris Pendleton with a scoring pass in the Hornets’ win at Portal.\nTre’von Pray, Bethesda — The junior rushed for 219 yards and a touchdown and returned an interception 75 yards for a score in the Blazers’ win over St. Andrew’s.\nBen Haeussler, Savannah Christian — The senior starred defensively at cornerback, had a pair of punts over 50 yards and caught a key pass for a first down in the Raiders’ win over Calvary Day.\nNick Iannone, Benedictine — The sophomore completed 6 of 7 passes for 136 yards and two touchdowns in the win over Jeff Davis.\nMelvin Smalls Jr., Jenkins — Rushed for 106 yards and two scores on nine carries in a win over Beach.\nTayshon Cooke, Bible Baptist — Scored a 95-yard touchdown on his only run of the game in a loss to Dorchester Academy.\nA.J.
