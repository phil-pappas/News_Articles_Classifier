The defense was without strong safety Antrel Rolle, out with an ankle injury, and inside linebacker Shea McClellin was lost to a left knee injury on the first play of the third quarter.\nThe game turned when the Chiefs lost four-time Pro Bowl running back Jamaal Charles to what coach Andy Reid said was likely a torn ACL in his right knee. The Chiefs had 235 yards of offense when Charles was injured early in the third quarter and they mustered only 52 more on five possessions the rest of the way.\nThe Bears defense battled to keep it close on a day when it allowed only 10 points. (Jay Cutler's fumble in the end zone that was recovered for a touchdown by Chiefs linebacker Ramik Wilson doesn't count against the defense.) The offense found its way slowly with an overhaul to the already revamped line and without starting wide receivers Alshon Jeffery and Eddie Royal.\n\"We weren't in it until pretty late,\" Cutler said. \"So we put the defense in a bad spot.\"\nThe Bears trailed by double-digits for 36 minutes, 52 seconds, before getting two touchdowns in the final 3:05. The game would have been lost had outside linebacker Pernell McPhee not blocked a 27-yard field-goal attempt by Cairo Santos before the defense came up with three third-down stops in the fourth quarter.\nMcPhee came through quickly when Donald Stephenson lost his balance on the field-goal try, getting his right hand up to deflect the kick.\n\"They disrespected me,\" McPhee said. \"They ran Counter O at me three times and I just felt pissed because they busted it two, three times and I felt, 'I've got to go make a play for my boys.'\"\nThe Chiefs, who lost for the fourth straight week, moved the ball quickly downfield before Charles buckled on a non-contact injury on first-and-goal from the 9-yard line.\nThe defense gave the offense the chances it needed with three critical stops, including two big plays:\n•Third-and-6 from the Chiefs' 30 with 11:41 remaining. Christian Jones, who took over defensive calls when McClellin was hurt, drilled tight end Travis Kelce in the open field to break up a pass and force the first of what became three three-and-outs. It was the Bears' biggest open-field play by an interior linebacker in five games.\n\"I saw him coming in front of me and unloaded,\" Jones said.\n•Third-and-8 from the Chiefs' 24 with 2:15 remaining. Cornerback Tracy Porter got his left hand inside to deflect a throw from Alex Smith on a quick slant. A completion would have come close to wrapping up the game as the Bears had only one timeout remaining.\n\"I just had that feeling that they were going to come out with a quick pass,\" Porter said. \"And believing in my guys that they were going to have me if something else was tried. (It was) being aggressive and having a feel for what was coming.\"\nNow the Bears are 2-3 and headed to Detroit to face a disastrous Lions team that is 0-5 and saw quarterback Matthew Stafford benched in a blowout home loss to the Cardinals on Sunday. Fox won't have to answer questions much longer about his defense's confidence.\n\"They've shown steady improvement since we started the season,\" Fox said.\nIs it ready to handle Aaron Rodgers at Lambeau Field? Maybe not. But rallying from a 14-point deficit in a difficult road environment is a boost. The Bears never felt like they were out of this game, as ugly as it was.\n\"We should be over that stuff,\" said nickel cornerback Sherrick McManis, one of only six players remaining who joined the Bears before the Marc Trestman era. \"We don't feel like we are down and out. We just keep fighting and see how things roll out.\"\nDown 14 on the road, what would have happened to last year's team?\n\"Who knows?\" McManis said. \"I'm focused on this year.\"\nFist bumps all around.\nbmbiggs@tribpub.com\nTwitter @BradBiggs\nPrivacy Policy Chicago Bears Kansas City Chiefs Pernell McPhee John Fox Shea McClellin Jay Cutler Lambeau Field", "external_links": ["http://www.tribpub.com/privacy-policy-and-your-privacy-rights/", "http://www.trbimg.com/img-561afe78/turbine/ct-biggs-bears-chiefs-spt-1012-20151011"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:24:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T05:18:43.873+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
