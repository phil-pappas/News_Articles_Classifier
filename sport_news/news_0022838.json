Schaap turned that idea into the book Green Bay Replay and asked Daniel to shoot the pictures.\nDaniel, an award-winning documentary photographer, began shooting training camp, the fans, the home games, alumni from the 1960s, press conferences, playoff games and finally the Super Bowl in New Orleans . Only a small selection of photos were chosen for Green Bay Replay and since next year is the 20 th anniversary of that season, Daniel thought there might be a market for a coffee-table photo book of his pictures. So he launched a Kickstarter campaign to raise funds to self-publish his book of that season. The theme is the triangular relationship between Lombardi's Packers, Holmgren's Packers and the fans that loved them.\n\"Photographing the Packers was a dream project for me,\" Kramer says. \"As the child of a Packer, I was born less than a mile from Dad's former office, aka Lambeau Field. I suffered through decades of the Pack losing. So when Ron Wolfe , Mike Holmgren , Brett Favre and Reggie White started turning things around, it was pretty damn exciting! And who could have predicted that the Packers would go on to win the Super Bowl? The first time the Pack had been back to the Super Bowl since my dad's team had won it in 1968. Talk about timing!\"\nKramer's working title for the book is the 20th Anniversary of the Packers Return to Glory and he's wrangled text commitments from his father as well as Jeremy Schaap . He would also like to include extended captions from people featured in the book, which he plans to have ready by September, 2016.\nOn Wednesday, Kramer reached his Kickstarter goal but the campaign runs until Tuesday morning.\n\"I'm excited for him,\" says his father. \"I think he's been waiting his whole life to do this book and it's going to be the best Kramer book in 30 years!\"\nIf you'd like to support this project, please visit:\nhttps://www.kickstarter.com/projects/titletown/the-20th-anniversary-of-the-packers-return-to-glor\nTo view the original version on PR Newswire, visit: http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/packers-great-jerry-kramers-son-publishing-packers-photo-book-300160259.html\nÂ©2015 ", "external_links": ["http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/packers-great-jerry-kramers-son-publishing-packers-photo-book-300160259.html", "http://rt.prnewswire.com/rt.gif?NewsItemId=DA28972&Transmission_Id=201510150917PR_NEWS_USPR_____DA28972&DateId=20151015", "http://www.xmlnews.org/ns/", "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/titletown/the-20th-anniversary-of-the-packers-return-to-glor"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T17:10:24.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
