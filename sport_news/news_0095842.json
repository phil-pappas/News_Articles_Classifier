I have to stay on the edges and be careful.\"\nSo the Cubs are in a tough spot, facing the Mets' top starter in Jacob deGrom and going with Hendricks, who couldn't make it out of the fifth inning against the Cardinals in Game 2 of the NLDS after the Cubs had staked him to a 6-1 lead.\nAfter giving up a bomb to the first batter he ever faced in the postseason, Hendricks got 14 of the next 15. But Hendricks -- a candidate to miss the postseason roster before two strong starts to end the season -- gave up 2-out homers to Kolten Wong and Randal Grichuk in the fifth, and that was the end of his day.\nHe will have a short leash again as the Cubs are in a do-or-die situation. Only the 2004 Boston Red Sox have ever come back from a 3-0 deficit in a seven-game series in major league history.\n\"I'd just rather attempt to go out and win (Tuesday's) game. That's it,\" said Cubs manager Joe Maddon. \"I don't want them to think about it in any other way, shape or form. It's about Tuesday.\n\"Again, I've been kind of repeating the same mantra the whole way through. We need to put together several one-game winning streaks. If we keep it one game at a time, we've a good shot of doing it. If you want to get into that result-oriented method of thinking, it's not going to play. So for me, for us, I'm really happy our guys have adopted that method.\" he said.\n\"We'll come out (Tuesday) and we'll be ready to play. Our guys are always ready to play. Their prep is great. The camaraderie among the group cannot be better. It's impossible. So we'll go out and play and the expectation is to win one game at a time,\" Maddon added.\nIt's not as if the Cubs weren't in those games over the weekend. They were a swing away from tying Game 1 and they had the right guys at the plate in Game 2 with a chance to get back in it.\nWhat they haven't done is play good enough defense, while the Mets have been nearly spotless, save the play in the ninth Sunday night when Familia failed to cover first and gave the Cubs some life.\nSo while it doesn't look pretty, this series can change quickly if the Cubs win a game Tuesday that they're not supposed to win, not with Hendricks facing deGrom.\nJust as the Cubs were supposed to win with Jon Lester facing an unpredictable Harvey in Game 1, the Mets fully expect to take Game 3 and an insurmountable lead in the NLCS.\n\"It's always about starting pitching,\" Maddon said. \"I used to do clinics in the '90s a lot and said this game could easily have been called 'Pitching' as opposed to 'Baseball.'\n\"That's what it's all about. It's not like we pitched poorly. They've just pitched extraordinarily well for the first two games and that's the result.\n\"I'd like to believe with a little warmer weather (at Wrigley Field this week), our guys are going to have a little better feel at the plate.\"\nTeams with a 2-0 lead in a league championship series are 22-3, with only the 1985 Royals, 1985 Cardinals and, of course, the 2004 Red Sox as the only teams to recover from such a big hole.\nAll three of those teams were on the road for the first two games and played the middle three at home -- if you're looking for one more reason to keep the faith.\nbrozner@dailyherald.com\nâ€¢ Hear Barry Rozner on WSCR 670-AM and follow him @BarryRozner on Twitter.\n Sports MLB Cubs Rozner, Barry Baseball Pro Sports Newsletter", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/share"], "published": "2015-10-20T07:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:39:20.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
