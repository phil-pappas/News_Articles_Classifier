The defending national champions are still the No. 1 team in both major polls as they strive to earn a third straight berth in the Big Ten title game and a second straight appearance in the College Football Playoff.\nAs they prepare to host Penn State on Saturday night, the Buckeyes took strong steps toward rectifying their inconsistent play on offense in the 49-28 win over Maryland, primarily by going with a modified, two-quarterback system. On defense, though, they let what had been a struggling bunch of Terps rush for more than 200 yards, led by quarterback Perry Hills' 170.\n>>  Dispatch  sports editor Ray Stein answers your questions about Buckeyes football during our weekly chat, 1 p.m. Thursday, dispatch.com/osuchat \nTIM MAY: Halfway through the season? Wow, time flies, especially when covering a team that, in the four years under coach Urban Meyer, seems to have new things popping each week in its usually successful quest to improve. I think we saw major improvement, scheme wise, with the decision to play quarterback J.T. Barrett in red-zone situations. I mean, 6 for 6 down in there -- all touchdowns -- with Barrett in there for five of those, speaks for itself. Yet starting quarterback Cardale Jones still managed to post career highs in passing yards (291) and completions (21). Granted, it was against a defense that was in the bottom fifth of the major-college ratings, but the Buckeyes still almost doubled up the points Michigan scored the week before in a 28-0 win over the Terps. And folks are certainly gushing about the Wolverines this week.\nBILL RABINOWITZ: I like the Barrett Zone concept. He's a much more nimble runner, and that threat can be invaluable as the area the defense has to cover becomes compressed. When Jones is effective as a runner, it's when he scrambles and builds a head of steam. Inside the 20-yard line, there's not much space to build that head of steam. Just as important is the psychological benefit of having Barrett play a significant role. He was the undisputed offensive leader last season until he got hurt. There just seemed something odd about him being a bit piece -- or at Indiana, an unused piece. Everything I know about Barrett the person tells me he was able to handle the situation, but it still had to be extremely difficult, and I just sensed that his teammates got a boost by seeing him play an important role.\n>> Get the most out of college football season, follow @BuckeyeXtra on Twitter \nMAY: He is one of the captains, for goodness sake. And he finished fifth in the Heisman Trophy race last year, despite getting hurt, while setting beaucoup school records. Talk about replacing production; that was always going to be a tall order for Jones, despite his postseason heroics. And bottom line, both deserve to play. Whether this happy medium can continue will be interesting to watch. A test will come this week against a very good Penn State defense. Barrett had a good-bad-good outing against the Nittany Lions last year, finally scoring both touchdowns in overtime as the Buckeyes pulled out the win after Joey Bosa's shove-sack of Christian Hackenberg on the final play. The big difference is this one is going to be in Ohio Stadium in prime time, with the Buckeyes wearing almost all-black uniform. I'm calling them the men in black. We'll see how that goes over.\nRABINOWITZ: If the Buckeyes don't play well -- or God forbid, lose -- those black uniforms and probably any alternate uniform will never be worn again. Until Saturday's 29-7 victory over Indiana, I didn't think Penn State posed much of a threat to Ohio State. The Nittany Lions struggled to beat Army two weeks ago. Hackenberg seemed to be regressing. Even a stout defense seemed inadequate to cover for a weak offense. I'm still not really sold on Penn State. Indiana quarterback Zander Diamont was knocked out of Saturday's game, and Nate Sudfeld was already out. But Ohio State still hasn't dominated anyone from start to finish this season. I thought the Buckeyes would against Maryland, and they couldn't shake the Terps until late in the third quarter. One thing we know about Penn State: Its players are tough and won't be intimidated by a big, prime-time stage.\nMAY: Let's get back on track here, as in discussing where the Buckeyes have excelled and where there is work to be done. On offense, again, I like the two- quarterback thing. Running back Ezekiel Elliott is off to a grand start, especially compared to last season, which he capped with a grand finish. The offensive line has started to handle much better the goofy stuff defenses keep trying to employ. Michael Thomas has emerged as the reliable pass catcher expected, and Jalin Marshall -- when he hangs on to the ball -- is one of the more electrifying players out there. Then there is Braxton Miller, who after four games of withering production following his spectacular debut at hybrid back against Virginia Tech, jumped back into the picture as pass catcher, runner and blocker.\n>> Click for details on how to win tickets and trips to OSU games from  Dispatch  Reader Rewards \nRABINOWITZ: It might be as a blocker that I've been most impressed by Miller. That's a big part of the job description for an Ohio State receiver, and he has taken to it. The Buckeyes certainly had a tougher time with Maryland than we expected, but a lot of good might have come out of the game. I've felt for a while that one of the Buckeyes' issues on offense is that they might have too many weapons, as funny as that sounds. Players hadn't settled into roles. Now the Buckeyes have one for Barrett. Miller got involved again. Marshall might end up being the consistent deep threat Ohio State has lacked. The Buckeyes have too many playmakers to sputter the way they have for long. Now if they can eliminate the defensive breakdowns. The good thing from that perspective is that they've been hurt by quarterbacks who can run. Hackenberg isn't much of a threat with his feet, and the Buckeyes' defensive line should be able to pressure him.\nMAY: The past three teams have run progressively more effectively on Ohio State. They just didn't have the balance offensively to make it work in an upset way. But it must be remembered that the Buckeyes employ a lot of man coverage, which means occasionally there are going to be gaps to exploits in a scrambling way for any quarterback capable of hoofing it. Folks saw that against Indiana and Maryland. Hackenberg, on the other hand, has minus-32 yards net rushing this season. The Penn State running threat will have to come from conventional means. Ohio State's breakout players on the defense the first six games have been cornerback Gareon Conley and defensive end Tyquan Lewis. Lewis especially has stepped up the past couple of Saturdays into a marauding presence. Like I said, the style the Buckeyes play on defense occasionally is going to get exploited, but the rise of Lewis and Sam Hubbard in the pass-rush game to augment Bosa gives them the chance to make up for a gaffe with a big play of their own.\nRABINOWITZ: One reason Lewis and Hubbard have flourished is all the extra attention that Bosa draws. My sense is that the two defensive players who offensive coordinators design their game plans to counteract are Bosa and linebacker Darron Lee. Both are such explosive players. If their stats aren't dazzling -- Bosa got his first full sack on Saturday -- that doesn't mean they aren't having an impact. That's not to take anything away from the players you mentioned. Conley has been more than solid, and Lewis has been what coaches and teammates predicted. Sophomore Raekwon McMillan also is growing more comfortable and confident at middle linebacker. The bottom line is that while the Buckeyes have been lacking the style points expected of them coming off their stunning postseason, you can see progress with many of their players. It hasn't all come together yet as a team. Maybe it never will. Or maybe the Buckeyes will peak at the right time again.\nbrabinowitz@dispatch.com \n@brdispatch \ntmay@dispatch.com \n@TIM_MAYsports", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T12:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:25:46.517+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
