(AP) - Jordan Ellis scored on a 3-yard run in the third overtime and Virginia rallied to beat Syracuse 44-38 Saturday night, ending the Cavaliers' two-game losing streak. \nEllis carried on three consecutive plays against an exhausted Orange defense, which was on the field for the last 6:52 of regulation as Virginia (2-4, 1-1 Atlantic Coast Conference) drove for the tying field goal. \nEllis' runs covered 3 yards, minus-1 yard and then 3 yards again for the clinching score. \nThe Orange (3-3, 1-1) lost their third straight, failing to score in the third overtime after Eric Dungey was sacked for a 6-yard loss on third-and-10 and Cole Murphy missed a 48-yard field goal attempt. \nThe second overtime went quickly. Virginia scored in three plays, with Taquan Mizzell running the last 13 yards for the touchdown. Syracuse, starting at the 12 because of a Virginia penalty, needed just one play as Dungey rolled right and found Steve Ishmael just inside the right pylon. Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
