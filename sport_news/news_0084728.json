But the Falcons had relentless offensive zone pressure to get the go-ahead goal. An empty-netter from John Schilling with 2.2 seconds left sealed the win for Bowling Green (3-1) while Canisius fell to 0-2.\n“Even though the loss to a very good hockey team at home hurts right now, I thought we played with an extremely high pace tonight,” Canisius coach Dave Smith said. “The process we played with was really good and I’m proud of the effort our team showed. We now look forward to turning our attention toward league play and seeing how much we have learned from our early non-conference games.”\nTie game: Shane Conacher notched his first goal of the season at 11:34 of the third period to tie the game.\nFirst lead: The Griffs took their first lead of the season when Ralph Cuddemi scored just 22 seconds into the second period. It was the senior’s 43rd career goal and with an assist on Conacher’s third-period goal he now has 84 career points in 117 games.\nAnd there goes the lead: Bowling Green got on the board about four minutes later to tie the game on Kevin Dufour’s third goal of the year. Then with 10:26 left in the second, Tyler Spezia sped through two Canisius defenders and beat Reilly Turner five-hole for a 2-1 lead.\nDefensive woes: After setting a program record by allowing just 2.24 goals a game last season, the Canisius defense is off to a slow start. The Griffs allowed six goals against Penn State. The most they allowed last year in a game was four.\nBetween the pipes: Reilly Turner made 30 saves for the Griffs. Tommy Burke made 20 saves in the win.\nAgainst ranked teams: Canisius is now 6-29-3 all-time against nationally ranked schools in its Division I era. Ranked 10th, Bowling Green is the highest ranked team the Griffs have hosted since they played No. 1 New Hampshire at then HSBC Arena on Oct. 24, 2003.\nSeries record: Bowling Green improved its series lead to 4-0-1. Canisius fell to 5-13-6 against teams currently in the WCHA.\nFirst freshman points: Freshman forward Dylan McLaughlin picked up an assist for Canisius in the Griffs’ season-opening 6-1 loss to Penn State. He became the fourth active Griff to record a point in his first game, joining Mathew Backhouse, Shane Conacher and Mike Sabatini.\nCouting the house: 1,624.\nNext up: Bowling Green travels east on the Thruway to play RIT at 7:05 p.m. Saturday at Rochester’s Blue Cross Arena in the Tigers’ annual Brick City Homecoming Game. Canisius is off until next weekend, when the Griffs open Atlantic Hockey play by hosting Holy Cross at 4:05 p.m. Friday and Saturday in HarborCenter.\nemail: amoritz@buffnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T06:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T13:46:23.042+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
