McDonogh's Jared Moses clears the ball in the first half. The visiting McDonogh Eagles played the Archbishop Spalding Cavaliers in boys high school soccer Wednesday afternoon. (By Paul W. Gillespie, Staff) Glenn Graham Contact Reporter The Baltimore Sun With an 8-0-1 league record, McDonogh has 25 points and a lead over Calvert Hall in the MIAA A Conference. \nThe No. 1 McDonogh boys soccer team found an answer against No. 2 Calvert Hall's sturdy defense on Friday, scoring early goals in each half to come away with a 2-0 win in a game that ended prematurely due to the inclement weather in Owings Mills. \nWith 23:38 left to play in the second half, lightning suspended play and after a 30-minute delay and heavy rain that followed, the game was called off with the Eagles declared the victor. \nMcDonogh (12-0-1) takes firm hold of first place in the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association A Conference with an 8-0-1 mark for 25 points. Second-place Calvert Hall (8-3-1) is now 7-2-1 in league play with 22 points. \nAfter playing 100 minutes of scoreless soccer at Calvert Hall on Sept. 11, the Eagles wasted little time finding the net on their natural grass home field on Friday. \nSenior Tunde Akinlosotu provided the lead in the game's fourth minute, taking a pass from Stephen Nichols and finishing from the right side for the 1-0 advantage. Starting fast was something the Eagles had planned on and were able to execute. Read the story \n\"We were talking a lot this week about wanting to get off to a good start. We wanted to come out and set the tempo and dictate play for that first 10 minutes and we were able to do that and a goal came from it. That's a wonderful reward from that standpoint,\" McDonogh coach Brandon Quaranta said. \nThe visiting Cardinals had their chances to tie during the remainder of the first half with balanced play, but couldn't get anything past McDonogh goalie Arman Medghalchi. The biggest of his three saves in the first 40 minutes came with 5:07 to play. Calvert Hall junior Reugo Nnadozie found space on the right side and set up his right foot for a heavy shot from 14 yards that Medghalchi tipped over the crossbar. \nThe Baltimore Sun takes Athletes of the Week nominations from Friday night until Sunday at 6 p.m. Please provide name, school, class, sport, position, team results and the athlete's accomplishments for the week, with statistics by game, and other supporting information. Coaches also should provide a number where they can be reached Sunday night. You can email your nominations to athleteoftheweek@baltimoresun.com . (Katherine Dunn, Glenn Graham) \nJust like the first half, the Eagles came out for the second half with energy and intensity, and made the most of an opportunity when senior Jackson Morrill took a feed from Akinlosotu on the left and buried a shot to the far post for the 2-0 lead two minutes after the break. With 23:38 left, the first sight of lightning appeared at 5:11 p.m. and was followed by heavy rain 15 minutes later. The game was called shortly afterward. League rules state a winner can be declared in a game halted by the weather if it reaches past halftime. \nQuaranta said the first 10 minutes of the second half on Friday was the best soccer he has seen from his team this season. It came at the end of its finest week. The Eagles went on the road to defeat No. 8 Archbishop Curley on Monday, edged No. 11 Mount St. Joseph at home on Wednesday and answered Calvert Hall's challenge in a highly anticipated matchup between the area's top two teams. \n\"I thought our preparation both last week and this week on Tuesday and Thursday was excellent and the boys really focused in on what they needed to do,\" Quaranta said. \"We understood the importance of this week and opening up a little bit of a gap. Whenever you're able to do that in the MIAA and have a little separation between you and the next team, you consider yourself fortunate.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:57:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:35:55.887+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
