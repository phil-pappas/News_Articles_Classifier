Rick Bamman - hbamman@shawmedia.com) Bears quarterback Jay Cutler scrambles out of the pocket during the first half Sunday against the Oakland Raiders at Soldier Field. By HUB ARKUSH – harkush@chicagofootball.com \nThe Bears’ 22-20 victory over the Oakland Raiders was a case study in what Bears fans can look forward to over the next year and a half or so. \nOnce it was clear Jay Cutler would start at quarterback, it wasn’t surprising. It wasn’t very pretty at times, and it could have gone either way in the end. \nThe Bears and Raiders are similar teams, both fitting in the bottom third or so of the NFL talent-wise – the Raiders with a little more young talent to build around; the Bears with a little better veterans. \nThis was what a game between two rebuilding football teams looks like. \nBased on his comments after the game, Bears coach John Fox kind of agrees with me. \n“As I’ve said many times, we’re building – I don’t know about this ‘re’ stuff. I don’t know what that means,” he said. “We’re, hopefully, going to get better as we move forward. Hopefully, we can build on this, and I think we will.” \nI suspect Fox knows building can mean adding to what you already have, but rebuilding means tearing it down and starting from scratch. \nWhich category the Bears really belong in will be decided by what they end up doing at quarterback, and Bears fans saw again in the Raiders game why that’s an open question. The Bears aren’t even in the game against the Raiders without Cutler, and Fox wasn’t shy about complimenting his effort afterward. \n“Jay is a tough son of a bug,” Fox said. “He fought an injury. Some lesser guys may not have been out there, but he was. I thought all in all he played outstanding and well enough for us to win. My hats off to his toughness, battling through that game.” \nCutler talked afterward about the difficulties of competing with a hamstring that we have to assume still is not 100 percent. \n“It’s hard to play an instinctual game and your instinct says, ‘Go,’ but your body says, ‘OK, you can’t do that,’ or ‘It’s not smart,’“ said Cutler, who finished 28 of 43 for 281 yards and two touchdowns with one interception. “I moved around that first drive a lot. I told (quarterbacks coach) Dowell (Loggains), ‘I don’t know how much longer we can keep this up.’ \n“We tried to manage it from there on out in the fourth quarter. That last drive, you have to do what you have to do.” \nAs well as Cutler played, however, it appeared he once again would shoot himself and his team in the foot when he threw an interception to the ageless Charles Woodson with 6:50 left in the game and the Bears leading, 19-17. \nAfter the Raiders marched to the Bears’ 23 and took a 20-19 lead on a 41-yard Sebastian Janikowski field goal with 2:05 to play, it seemed Cutler might be just good enough to lose with again. \nFox claimed a different perspective on the pick. \n“I think a lot of people highlight interceptions. Most quarterbacks who play the game have interceptions,” he said. “I think it’s the body of work around it. We had zero interceptions the week before, and it didn’t go so well. The mental and physical toughness it took for him to be out there and then to perform like he did was pretty amazing.” \nThere were other notable performances that led to Robbie Gould’s game-winning 49-yard field goal with two seconds left on the clock. \nMartellus Bennett, Matt Slauson, Charles Leno Jr., Patrick Omameh, Jarvis Jenkins, Eddie Goldman, Pernell McPhee, Sam Acho, Tracy Porter and Adrian Amos all were heroic to one degree or another, and all are new to the lineup this year except for Bennett and Slauson. \nTherein lies the building or rebuilding of this team, depending on your point of view. \nThree things are not debatable. \nThe Bears don’t win this one without Cutler, Sunday’s performance would not have been good enough to beat Green Bay, Arizona or Seattle, but it was the kind of performance they can “build” on and perhaps be a better team next week. \nThe opponent will be Kansas City, a notch below the Bears’ first three but a notch above them and the Raiders. \nIt should be very interesting to see if the Bears can take another step and how far Cutler can take them. \n• Hub Arkush is the editor of Chicago Football.
