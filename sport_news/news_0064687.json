(Photo: The Advocate, Michael Lehmkuhle/Tribune) \nWEST LAFAYETTE - Throughout the offseason, the Ridgewood football team lifted weights in a weight room where pictures of the other Inter Valley Conference championship teams hung. \nThe players' goal: to get on that wall. \nNow, after a convincing 49-6 win over Malvern, their goal has been accomplished, as the win gives them at least a share of the title. \nThey are members of the first Ridgewood team since 2011 to claim a share of the championship. But this team all season long has been hearing the doubts, not from people in their camp, but from those on the outside. They shut all of that out and have answered the bell, now extending their win streak to seven games. \n\"We were being doubted in the beginning of the year, and we just wanted to show everybody around us and the teams we face in the IVC that we are capable of winning a championship,\" Brice Hains said. \n\"I say football is like life: There are ups and downs, and you have to figure out a way. You don't quit, you battle through it, and these guys have exemplified that,\" coach John Slusser said. \"I said all along I don't think they are that talented, but I'm starting to change my mind as the weeks go on. We are starting to show that we have a lot of strengths.\" \nThe strength all season has been on the defensive side of the ball for the Generals, but the members of the offense answered any questions people had about them in the offseason as well. \nWith third-string quarterback Trent Harrison running the offense, the Generals totaled 478 yards of total offense, including 407 on the ground. \n\"We knew coming in we would be OK running the ball, but on our first few possessions, things weren't going the way we planned. But eventually, things started clicking and we just kept rolling,\" said running back Billy Bailey, who totaled 149 yards and a touchdown on the ground. \nTo begin the game, the Ridgewood defense recovered a Malvern fumble, but Harrison fumbled it back on the next play. Then, on the Generals' second offensive drive, they were forced to punt, but after that, the Generals scored on their next seven drives. That run was highlighted by a 27-yard pass from Harrison to Braeden Smith and a 67-yard yard run by Bailey to end the half. \n\"I thought our guys did a great job. I thought Trent did a really good job for never playing back there before,\" Slusser said. \"Our guys just played really well. I thought they all did a great job.\" \nWhile the offense took some time to get going, the defense came out ready to play, hitting hard early and often. Malvern did get an opportunity to score after the Harrison fumble, but the Generals' defense stood tall on their own 4-yard line, forcing the Hornets to turn the ball over on downs. \n\"We will hit you,\" Slusser said. \"I'm really proud of our defense and our defensive coaches. Coach Lahna and coach Carpenter have done a tremendous job with that back end. Those guys have gotten better every week. When you throw against us, you pay the price for it now.\" \nRidgewood will travel to Newcomerstown to end the season with the chance to win the IVC title outright and go into the postseason in a winning groove. \n\"It's the big rivalry for the year. They always give us their best, and we really want to be outright IVC champions. We don't want a tie,\" Hains said. \ncteaguerob@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:33:53.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
