She played consistent in Saturday's gloomy weather conditions and birdied No. 17 on the way to a 3-over par day. \n\"After yesterday, the start she had, how she kind of stuck with it ... she got a decent score and came today and played lights out today,\" said Mark Shafer, also Hagerstown's coach. \n\"When she got in trouble, she got out of it. She saved par and played probably five holes in the rain.\" \nAlexis Miestowski of Lake Central won the tournament with 145 while Evansville North's Hadley Walts and Bloomington South's Cherise Otter tied for second with 151. \nEvansville North won the team title with 651. Westfield was second with 677. \nShafer also earned all-state honors from the coaches association. \n\"I'm just really proud of my daughter,\" Mark Shafer said. \n\"I was so much in the moment just watching her play. I know I’m going to see her play more golf, but I guess the nice part is we get to start playing golf together more now.\" \nSharing the state experience with her family was special. \n\"I never thought I’d have that opportunity,” Shelly Shafer said. \nRound 2 \nHOLE- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 -- FRONT; 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 -- BACK -- TOTAL \nPar- 4 4 5 3 4 3 5 4 4 -- 36; 4 4 3 5 4 3 4 4 5 -- 36-- 72 \nStrokes- 5 4 5 3 4 3 5 5 5 -- 39; 4 4 3 5 5 3 4 3 5 -- 36 -- 75 \nRound 1 \nHOLE- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9-- FRONT; 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 -- BACK -- TOTAL \nPar- 4 4 5 3 4 3 5 4 4 -- 36; 4 4 3 5 4 3 4 4 5 -- 36-- 72 \nStrokes- 6 4 6 3 5 5 4 4 4 -- 41; 4 7 3 7 6 3 5 4 5 -- 44-- 85 108 CONNECT 1 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://pinews.co/1LaL8aA TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T03:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T15:05:22.228+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
