He had played in all five games in a reserve role this season, but had just tackles and one pass breakup.\n\"While we had hoped Tee would continue playing, he has chosen to conclude his career and focus on finishing his degree here at Ole Miss,\" Ole Miss coach Hugh Freeze said. \"We respect his decision and wish him the very best. He will always be a part of our family, and we hope he continues to use his platform to impact others.\"\nShepard, a native Californian, signed with Notre Dame out of high school, but was unable to enroll for academic reasons. He spent two years at Northeast Mississippi Community College before signing with Ole Miss.\nShepard is also hearing-impaired , and he and Freeze have talked openly about the challenges that had posed to Shepard's playing football at a high level. Freeze said Monday that Shepard \"really struggled in getting the checks\" in the raucous environment at the Rebels' game at Florida last weekend.\n\"The injuries and challenges I have overcome the last few years have taken away my love for playing the game of football,\" Shepard said. \"I want to thank Rebel Nation for the support they have shown me in my time here. I want to especially thank Coach Freeze for showing me what unconditional love is like. I will always love this team and cheer them on as they compete for a championship. I look forward to completing my degree from Ole Miss and beginning the next phase of my life.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.olemisssports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/100515aab.html"], "published": "2015-10-08T05:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T07:51:25.969+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
