Tucker tied it with 3 seconds to go in regulation after Pittsburgh's Josh Scobee missed a pair of kicks that would have given the Steelers some cushion. Tucker then won it in the extra period after the Steelers failed to convert a pair of fourth downs in Baltimore territory. Justin Forsett ran for 150 yards for the Ravens (1-3). Joe Flacco threw a touchdown pass and did just enough late to help the Ravens end the worst start in franchise history. Michael Vick threw for 124 yards and a score while starting in place of injured Ben Roethlisberger, but the Steelers (2-2) bumbled late and Baltimore took advantage. \nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
