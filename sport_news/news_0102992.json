Alaska won, 114-98. (Ernie Sarmiento)\nThe management of San Miguel Corp. (SMC), which under its umbrella owns Ginebra, Star and San Miguel Beer, decided to move Cone to the Kings in the hopes of ending the popular team’s title drought.\nThe game between Ginebra and Star is set at 5:15 p.m., right after the 3 p.m. encounter of Rain or Shine and Mahindra, where playing coach Manny Pacquiao is expected to join the Enforcers (formerly Kia).\nThe Elasto Painters – minus injured ace point guard Paul Lee – are aiming for their second straight victory after hammering a come-from-behind 96-87 decision to the Hotshots last Wednesday.\nCone took over a Ginebra team that has the ‘twin towers’ of 7-foot center Greg Slaughter and 6-10 forward Japeth Aguilar, which makes the 57-year-old mentor excited to implement his ‘triangle offense’ system.\n“The triangle we have right now is ‘the triangle’ (with Ginebra),” said Cone, now with his third PBA team as he also coached Alaska for almost 23 years where he won 16 titles and his first Grand Slam – the league’s version of a ‘triple’ crown’ of championships.\n“We have to take advantage of those guys, Greg and Japeth. We have to play to our strengths,” said Cone, adding that the system he has now is adjusted to the fact that the Kings have two of the “most dominant players” in the league.\nIn his second year in the league last season, Slaughter averaged 14.84 points and 10.28 rebounds, while the high-leaping Aguilar has 11.64 points, 7.64 rebounds and 1.48 shot blocks per game.\nHowever, the Kings are not just about the Slaughter-Aguilar tandem as Cone will likewise have in his arsenal a loaded backcourt led by former MVP Mark Caguioa and LA Tenorio, who played for Cone when the two were still with the Aces that won a title in 2010 Fiesta Cup.\nAlso, the team has another one-time MVP in Jayjay Helterbrad, Sol Mercado, Chris Ellis, and new recruits Joe Devance – obtained in a three-team trade from Star – and Nico Salva and rookie Scottie Thompson.\nThe team was supposed to debut last Wednesday against Meralco, but the league adjusted its schedule when the opening ceremony was postponed last Sunday and the 41st Season opener was held four days ago at the Mall of Asia (MOA) Arena in Pasay City.\nThe cancellation gave Cone several more days to fine-tune the ‘triangle’, and now he said they are ready to play even if it’s a little tough on him personally as he faces his former team.\n“It’s been a long break and it feels good to get back at it,” said Cone. “It’s always tough to face your ex-players and it is specially hard to face them in your first game, but we’re all excited to get going.”\n“Just everyone else, I’m curious to see how our guys respond. This is the first baby step of our journey together,” said Cone, whose task is to deliver a title for the team that last won in 2008 Fiesta Cup.\nAs for the Hotshots, the team will try to rebound from that setback to Rain or Shine, but rookie mentor Jason Webb, who took over from Cone, expects a tough match up with Ginebra’s size advantage.\n“They’re a tough match up for us, or for any team, with their size,” said Webb, 41, whose team will again be led by former two-time MVP James Yap, Marc Pingris and Mark Barroca.", "external_links": ["http://i.po.st/static/v3/post-widget.js#publisherKey=4qcr4d26tnrf260rqrda&retina=true"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T22:31:44.739+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
