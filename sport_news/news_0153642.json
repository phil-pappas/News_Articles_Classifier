Mids, Fighting Irish meet on Saturday afternoon \nNavy head coach Ken Niumatalolo readily admits he dreads watching tape of Notre Dame each year. \nDoing so provides a vivid reminder of the tremendous talent the Fighting Irish possess and what a difficult challenge the Midshipmen face. \nOn Saturday night, following Navy's sound defeat of service academy rival Air Force, Niumatalolo went home and watched the Notre Dame-Clemson contest on television. While the Fighting Irish were upset, the caliber of athletes he saw on the field was enough to spoil the eighth-year head coach's good mood. \n\"I watched the television copy on Saturday night and it was obvious that we're going to have our hands full as we always do,\" Niumatalolo said. \nBy Monday morning the Navy staff had viewed tape of all five of Notre Dame's games this season. It was a particularly disheartening exercise for the defensive coaches because the Irish are absolutely loaded with big-time talent on offense. (Bill Wagner) \nEverett Golson was the star of last year's meeting between the two institutions, throwing for 315 yards and three touchdowns while also running for three scores as Notre Dame won a 49-39 shootout at FedEx Field in Landover. \nNavy fans are no doubt thrilled that Golson is now the starting quarterback at Florida State. Golson transferred because he was replaced at the end of last season by Malik Zaire, who suffered a fractured ankle against Virginia and will miss the rest of the season. \nSo the Fighting Irish are down to DeShone Kizer, who was third stringer a year ago. The 6-foot-4, 230-pound sophomore has looked pretty good so far, completing 63 of 99 passes (63.6 percent) for 862 yards and seven touchdowns while rushing for another 114 yards and two scores. \nFor the first time in college football, both teams will wear identical baselayers when the 4-0 Midshipmen head to South Bend Saturday to take on the 4-1 Fighting Irish. \n\"Any player on scholarship at Notre Dame is really good. This quarterback is every bit as talented as the Notre Dame quarterbacks we've seen in the past,\" Navy interim defensive coordinator Dale Pehrson said. \"He's got a real strong arm and can make all the throws with accuracy. He's not afraid to tuck the ball and run and he's a big kid who is tough to tackle.\" \nNavy is quite familiar with C.J. Prosise, who caught a pass over the middle and outraced a bunch of chasing defenders for a 78-yard touchdown just 52 seconds into last year's contest. The Midshipmen will be seeing a lot more of Prosise, who has moved from wide receiver to tailback and is enjoying a terrific season, rushing for 650 yards and six touchdowns while catching nine passes for another 131 yards. \n\"Number 20 is really something. He can flat-out fly,\" Pehrson said of Prosise, who is averaging 7.3 yards per carry and 14.6 yards per reception. \"What makes him so dangerous is that he used to be a receiver so he is very adept at catching the ball out of the backfield and is real dangerous out in space.\" \nJunior Will Fuller has emerged as the primary deep threat and leads Notre Dame with 24 receptions for 491 yards and six touchdowns. The speedster out of Roman Catholic High in Philadelphia is averaging a startling 20.5 yards per catch. \n“Fuller runs by everybody. He’s super fast. You watch the tape and no corner can cover him,” Niumatalolo said of Fuller. \"We have to try our best to keep him in front of us. That’s easier said than done.” \nThe Fighting Irish have an entire fleet of quality receivers with Chris Brown (20 catches, 261 yards) and Amir Carlisle (13-145) also having strong seasons. Torii Hunter Jr. and Corey Robinson both are quite capable. \nRobinson, son of former Naval Academy basketball great David Robinson, is a big target at 6-foot-5 and 215 pounds. He recorded 40 receptions 539 yards and five touchdowns as a sophomore. \n\"We don't have enough defensive backs to cover all the receivers they have,\" Pehrson said only half-jokingly. \"What really sticks out on tape is just how fast they are across the board. They have a ton of team speed.\" \nMaking Pehrson's job of devising a defensive game-plan particularly difficult is the fact Notre Dame can employ 11 personnel (one tight end, one tailback, three wide receivers) and run or throw with equal ease. The Fighting Irish have a very effective power rushing attack and are unafraid to keep it on the ground on any down. \n\"It's a really tough balance to strike. If you put out personnel to stop the pass, they'll run right at you. If you put some big bodies in there to stop the run, they'll send everyone out and throw it,\" Pehrson said. \nNiumatalolo echoed those concerns and said it becomes a case of \"pick your poison.\" \n\"Notre Dame has given us trouble over the years because they can mash us with the running game. So you have to get the safeties involved, get extra hats to the ball and that leaves the back end vulnerable,\" Niumatalolo said. \"It's a tough combination to deal with. They have the ability to run it down our throats or throw it over our heads.\" \nNotre Dame has only punted once in the last two meetings with Navy. The Fighting Irish got a crucial fourth down stop late in the fourth quarter to escape with a 38-34 defeat of the Mids in South Bend two years ago. \nNavy is vastly improved on that side of the ball this season, ranking a respectable 35th nationally in total defense (333 total yards allowed per game) and a superb 13th in scoring defense (15.0 points). \n\"We're playing really well on defense so far this season, but we're going to have our hands full with this offense,\" Niumatalolo said. \"We've really struggled to stop them the last few years. We recognize that we're going against a very potent offense.\" \nHead coach: Brian Kelly, 6th year (49-21) \nNOTRE DAME AT A GLANCE \nLocation: South Bend, Indiana", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T00:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:26:24.594+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
