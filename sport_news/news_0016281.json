It sounds funny to say that in a game, but he wasn’t able to practice very much (during the week) and do it effectively,” said coach Bronco Mendenhall. “I just think it took him a little time to get back up to game speed without many repetitions.”\nMendenhall said Mangum was only 70-80 percent healthy Friday.\n“Our training staff did an amazing job helping me get ready for the game,” Mangum said. “They helped me out a lot. I wasn’t 100 percent and at the beginning of the game I was a little tight and a little tentative. Then as the game went on I didn’t think about it too much and I was able to do my part. Mentally, I got more dialed in.”\nSACK MASTERS: BYU set a season-high with five sacks in the first half and ended up with eight, tying the second-most in school history (Kansas State in the 1997 Cotton Bowl).\nThe Cougars now have 24 sacks this season, which is the most through seven games under Mendenhall.\nBYU also had 12 tackles-for-loss for the first time since a 2010 victory over Wyoming. The Cougars have at least seven tackles-for-loss in six out of seven games this season.\nBronson Kaufusi’s two sacks moved him into No. 3 in career sacks at BYU since 2000, when official NCAA defensive statistics were tracked. Travis Tuiloma recorded the first and second career sacks of his career.\nINJURY UPDATE: Freshman running back Riley Burt sustained a hamstring injury after a career-best 41-yard run in the first half. He did not return.\nOffensive lineman Ryker Mathews was also injured in the first half with an apparent ankle injury and did not return. Ului Lapuaho did not play due to an ankle injury sustained last week against East Carolina. Austin Hoyt and Brad Wilcox played in place of Mathews and Lapuaho.\nPENALTY WOES: BYU was whistled for 10 penalties for 74 yards Friday and several of those were costly, which either negated long plays on offense or gave Cincinnati new life.\n“If there was a black mark, we had some critical penalties along the way that made it harder for us,” Mendenhall said.\nHALL-OF-FAMERS HONORED: On Thursday, BYU inducted five members to the school’s Athletic Hall of Fame — linebacker Rob Morris, running back Luke Staley, volleyball player Nina Puikkonen Mortensen, cross-country/track star John Hedengrenand track coach Willard Hirschi.\nThe five were honored during a special presentation at halftime at LaVell Edwards Stadium Friday night.\nStaley, the 2001 Doak Walker Award winner, carried out the alumni flag prior to the game. He rushed for a school-record 1,596 yards and scored 24 touchdowns in 2001.\nEXTRA POINTS: BYU’s Garrett Juergens recorded a career-high 39-yard punt return in the fourth quarter, setting up the Cougars’ final touchdown  Cincinnati finished 7 of 17 on third-down conversions  Punter Jonny Linehan kicked four punts inside the 20-yard line and averaged 47.4 yards per punt on five attempts, including a long of 58 yards.\nEMAIL: jeffc@deseretnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T09:33:16.057+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
