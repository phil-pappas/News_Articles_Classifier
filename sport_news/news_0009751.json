But Waller, who had spent the last nine seasons with the A's, said Wednesday he'd gotten a call from manager Bob Melvin to let him know Waller wouldn't be coming back next season. \n\"I was told the team was going cutting edge when I asked why I was being let go,'' Waller said. \"I know they are making changes, but other than this, I don't know what else they want to do.'' \nMelvin and general manager David Forst weren't available to address the makeup of the rest of the 2016 coaching staff. Oakland Athletics' Billy Butler (16) runs past first base coach Tye Waller (46) on his way to second after hitting a walk-off hit against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 10th inning of a MLB game at O.co Coliseum in Oakland, Calif., on Tuesday, Aug. 18, 2015. Mark Canha (20) scored the winning run. (Ray Chavez/Bay Area News Group) ( RAY CHAVEZ ) \nWaller joined the A's in 2006 as the first base coach, moved to bench coach in 2008 and moved back to first base coach in 2010. In his time with the A's, he served under three managers, Ken Macha, Bob Geren and Melvin. \n\"I thought we had a good group of guys here over the years,'' Waller said. \"Last year was our big chance, but it never showed up this year. \nThe A's made it to the wild-card game in Kansas City in 2014 and had leads in the ninth and 12th innings, but couldn't hold on and were eliminated. \n\"When you work in this game long enough, you'll be let go a time or two,'' Waller said. \"You don't go out kicking and screaming. I'll move on. I know I'll be all right. Sometimes you just have to move on.'' Advertisement \nWaller played professionally for 11 seasons, including parts of four seasons in the majors. He also spent 18 years in the San Diego organization as minor league coach, minor league manager, big league coach and director of player development.
