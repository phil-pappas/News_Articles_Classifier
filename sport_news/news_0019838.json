Tacked on next to 14 wins, it seems like a downright acceptable record.\nBut not when you're Neshaminy field hockey.\nNot to head coach Caitlin Koczynski and assistant Lisa Pennington, and certainly not to the eight starting seniors intent on making their final season at Neshaminy one to remember.\n \"These girls have been playing together for so long, and it's really what makes us such a cohesive unit,\" Pennington said. \"They're all willing to work hard, and they just want to be successful.\"\nThis season, Neshaminy returned with fire, ripping off 15 wins with just one loss, a 2-1 defeat Wednesday at the hands of Central Bucks West.\nKoczynski said she's had an easy time keeping her team focused on the end goal of a district championship and more, because she has plenty of experienced players to lean on. That includes Lisa's daughter, Christen Pennington, a senior Villanova recruit who led the team with 12 goals through Tuesday.\n\"We know we just have to keep going one game at a time,\" captain Amanda Blum said of her team's mentality. \"Each game is what matters. We can't overlook anyone.\"\nTo keep the excellent season rolling, Blum and her teammates have followed their coaches' instructions to a tee.\nIn a hard-fought game Monday at C.R. North to open the team's busiest week of the season, Koczynski and the elder Pennington repeated three words ad nauseam: Control. Patience. Relax.\nA normally prolific Neshaminy offense wasn't generating enough. The first half came and went without a goal, and the second half continued on in the same vein.\nAs the attack struggled to find a foothold against C.R. North's stifling defense, the Neshaminy bench grew anxious.\nRegulation ended in a scoreless tie, bringing on the team's second venture into overtime this season.\nOnce again, the elder Pennington repeated the team's keys in the huddle.\nControl. Patience. Relax.\nIt's what her team does best.\n\"We just look to play smart, and play with control,\" she said. \"If we can play smarter and have patience, not out of control and hyper, we can stay focused on what's at hand.\"\nNeshaminy opened the overtime period with controlled, methodical passes, forcing the issue on offense and drawing three corners in the first three minutes.\nThe third proved to be exactly the offensive remedy Koczynski's squad needed.\nThe younger Pennington, who plays the ball in for Neshaminy on every single corner, sneaked in behind Council Rock's defensive back line unnoticed after passing the ball to teammate Marlena Koellener.\nKoellener took her shot at the goal, and the ball ricocheted off something in a maelstrom of desperate bodies and sticks.\nFor a second, the ball soared, and then just as quickly, Pennington pounced, knocking the ball out of midair from shoulder height.\nScreams ensued. The girls jumped up and down in an circling embrace.\n\"We lost some close games last year,\" the elder Pennington said after the game. \"We might not necessarily have won this one last year.\"\nBut, at least so far, 2015 is coming up all Neshaminy.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:30:44.907+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
