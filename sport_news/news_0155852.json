Given the past three meetings between these cross-county rivals and their play this season, it should be another tight finish. These teams have played three times in the previous two seasons, with the games decided by less than a touchdown each time. Western Alamance won 10-7 in the 2013 regular season, then Eastern Alamance won 28-23 in the second round of the state playoffs. Last year, Eastern Alamance won 43-42 on a last-minute touchdown and two-point conversion. This game, between the teams atop the Mid-State 3-A Conference, seems to be headed on the same course. “We just had to keep our minds on Monday first, and I feel like if we just come concentrated the results will happen,” Eastern Alamance quarterback John Lamot said. Eastern Alamance is one of four undefeated teams in Class 3-A, along with Shelby Crest, Havelock and West Craven. Count Western Alamance junior Darius Pinnix as those unimpressed with the zero attached to the Eagles’ record. “I’ve been watching Eastern, I’m not too impressed with them, they’re beatable,” Pinnix said. “We’re a great team … and we’re just going to show them what Western Alamance football really is.” ■ LAMOT CREDITS RECEIVERS: In completing 25 of 28 passes, Lamot was dialed in as a passer Monday night. But he directed the credit for that completion rate (89 percent) to his receivers, much like he credits his offensive line after each game for his rushing proficiency. “I know I threw some risky balls, but they made me look good. I’ve got to give them the credit. They do that all the time in practice,” Lamot said. “We might be a running team, but when the ball comes their way, they’re going to catch it. I’ve got all the confidence in the world in all of my receiving crew.” A.J. Aguilar had eight catches to lead the Eagles, including a 23-yard toe-drag catch along Northern Guilford’s sideline on the play before Lamot scored the game’s first touchdown. Johnny Wright hauled in a few diving catches, and each of the Eagles’ six receivers had at least two catches. ■ PATRIOTS EYE RESPECT WITHIN LEAGUE: Before the season, Southern Alamance coach Andrew Carrouth addressed a room with coaches and players of every other Alamance County team and described the Patriots’ uphill battle within the All Metro Conference. Page 2 of 2 - “Every team in this room is a fantastic football team, but it helps our guys to be able to go to the mall or the movies and see these other guys from the other teams,” Carrouth said. “It helps to develop a bit of a rivalry there with these guys. “We don’t have that same connection with the teams in Greensboro, so we’ve tried to fight hard with our guys about, obviously we’d love to beat every team in this room, but we’re never going to ever hang a banner for beating every team in this room.” Southern Alamance split its games against county teams — beating Williams High School and Graham and losing to Eastern Alamance and Western Alamance. Friday night’s league opener against Greensboro Grimsley marks the start of the Patriots trying to turn heads within its league. “We’ve got to start winning games in our conference to gain some respect, and I think that’s the biggest thing,” Carrouth said. “We can talk about doing this or doing that, new uniforms or how we come out, all that. Winning speaks. And that’s what we’ve got to get to.” ■ BUCCANEERS FIGHT SCHEDULING WOES: While nearly every team in North Carolina has felt the effects of rain across the past few weeks, there are few that have endured the madness of Bartlett Yancey’s schedule. The Buccaneers’ off week came in the second week, then a game against Roxboro Person was delayed because of a sickness that sidelined much of the Rockets’ roster. A few weeks ago, Bartlett Yancey’s game at Western Harnett was cancelled because of rain. The end damages are that Bartlett Yancey has gone through breaks of 20 and 12 days between games, and played one stretch of three games in eight days. “It’s one of those things, I’ve never had something like that in my coaching career, or my playing career. These kids, they’re resilient,” first-year coach David Weathersby said. “Nothing on the field can be as bad as what we’ve had to go through with the two-week breaks and everything else. “We’ve just got to keep on, and that’s kind of the new B-Y thing.” By Conor O'Neill", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T11:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:27:48.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
