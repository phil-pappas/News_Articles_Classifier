(AP Photo/Chuck Burton) × \nCLEMSON – Seven notes and anecdotes from the past couple days in Clemson to start your Back to the Future day: \n1) Full disclosure: my eyebrows raised to the roof too when head coach Dabo Swinney casually mentioned Florida State’s Dalvin Cook as “the best back in the country” in a fairly unrelated question about Miami’s run defense. \nSo would Leonard Fournette’s, whose numbers (1,202 yards, 14 TDs through six games; no fewer than 158 yards or a score in any of those six games) have been on par with some of the all-time great running backs in college football history. \n“They’re both phenomenal players, but if you can only pick one, I’m picking Dalvin Cook,” Swinney said. “I have seen both a good bit. Maybe it’s just more style of play, and more what I’m used to.” \nActually, Cook’s stats hasn’t been far off Fournette’s ridiculous pace; his 8.7 yards per carry actually bests Fournette, and he’s second in the nation with 159.2 yards a game and 10 touchdowns. \nSwinney added he also thought highly of Alabama’s Derrick Henry (901 yards, 12 touchdowns) and Georgia’s Nick Chubb before he suffered a season-ending knee injury. \n“Dalvin Cook’s explosiveness in the running game is unique,” Swinney said. “Fournette, his size, power, speed is unique. Different players, but both are great, no question.” \nOr maybe Swinney’s making up for his “five times out of 10” remark after the Florida State loss two years ago. After all, LSU isn’t on Clemson’s schedule. \nKen Burger, former Post and Courier columnist, author and cancer fighter, passes away \n2) This is what it’s all about . \nI can’t tell the story any better than WYFF-4 (NBC) did from Piedmont, S.C., so just go watch the video . In short, a young couple with a terminally ill infant could not attend a Clemson football game, so Clemson sent the marching band, the cheerleaders, the Tiger mascot, a signed football from Dabo Swinney and a busload of the Bolts’ best friends to bring Death Valley to them. \nThat’s a sign in this society of “getting it.” \n“That’s just a great moment,” Swinney said at his Tuesday press conference. “I think most schools recognize the opportunity they have to make people smile from time to time in different ways other than the product on the field. Clemson certainly gets that. They do a wonderful job of helping people in the community as often as possible.” \n3) BYE FELICIA. \nSorry if I didn’t watch SportsCenter a bunch last year – or, er, since I was in college with any regularity – but I missed the memo Miami quarterback Brad Kaaya is only now becoming more famous than his mother. \nAngela Means Kaaya, an actress, played Felicia in “Friday,” which was released in 1995, and was on the receiving end of Ice Cube’s “Bye Felicia” line that didn’t really become mainstream pop culture vernacular until recently. \n4) Tight end Jordan Leggett had 26 catches, and three touchdowns in his first 21 games at Clemson. He was known widely for his “Lazy Leggett” moniker when admitting his freshman year he was lazy in practice, and known privately by this beat writer for admitting he would have preferred to redshirt than play his freshman year. \nLook at Leggett now. 15 grabs, and five touchdowns, the latter mark leading all tight ends in Power 5 conferences and third-best overall in Division I football. \n“I feel like (the coaches) are looking for that size matchup,” said Leggett, who’s 6-5, 255. “When we get closer down to the red zone, with (injured wide receiver) Mike Williams not being able to play for us, I feel like they chose me to be that guy because of my height and ball skills. I’m kind of taking over the role Mike used to have.” \n5) Shaq Lawson doesn’t have one particular young defensive end when he’s asked about the team’s depth at that position behind himself and Kevin Dodd. \nHe does like Richard Yeargin’s progress, and acknowledges Dane Rogers and Austin Bryant are getting healthier. \n“Richard’s got the tools to be great,” Lawson said. “Just trying to get them young guys ready for when we come out of the game, so there’s no dropoff.” \n6) One more out of the quotefest from Swinney , who was asked about today’s era of social media attacks. Notably, Swinney has been, in his words, a “Twitter quitter.” \nMichigan’s punter has been the latest victim of nastiness on social media from fans who, well, can’t get a grip on reality . Clemson fans will remember the team being unhappy with Twitter messages being sent at now-senior center Ryan Norton last year after his bad snap at Florida State, which caused Norton to deactivate his account. \n“That genie’s out of the bottle. Ain’t nothing you can do about it,” Swinney said. “You better have some mental toughness. Don’t play. Don’t coach. Go do something that you can be out of the fray, because nothing you can do about it. What are you gonna do? I mean, people go online and say what they’re gonna do anytime they want to. \n“We’re all flawed people. We all fail. Sometimes some of us just fail in front of a big audience. When you’re in that realm, you take the good with the bad. That comes with the territory. That’s the world we live in now. That’s why you see a lot of young people making mistakes. Their whole life is played out, and it puts even more expectations and pressure on them.” \n7) The main story in today’s Post and Courier was all about the defense , and there’s this leftover quote from defensive coordinator Brent Venables about returning the unit to top-ten status when that wasn’t necessarily expected in 2015: \n“I thought we’d be solid. I’m always fearful of not doing our part. Of being an albatross to everything else,” Venables said. “I don’t want to just win. I want to win and complement the win by doing things structurally, strategy, effort, toughness, all those things that go into it. I want to do our part. Who doesn’t?” \n-AB", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T15:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T15:13:22.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
