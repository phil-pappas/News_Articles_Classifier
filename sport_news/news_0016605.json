And I attribute it to the leadership that we have on this football team, the leadership that we have on this football team and the way they handle the locker room.” \nFundamentals, cleaning up small mistakes and tinkering with schemes that simply weren’t working the way the coaching staff hoped consumed practice during the off week. But for this 2015 Tar Heel team that is off to a 4-1 start and 1-0 in the ACC, there seems to be a sense of peace in not needing to fix the things that are the hardest to fix. \n“All the other things – the tweaking offense, defense, special teams – those things can be corrected,” Fedora said. “It’s hard to correct those other things. I’m really proud in that matter, that’s identified this football team.” \nWhile UNC acknowledges that fixing chemistry and relationship problems after last season was the key in setting the tone for this year’s team, Fedora was quick to clarify that he will not compare the two teams in respect to how they handle both failure and success. \n“I try not to associate the two together,” Fedora said. “I’m trying to distance everything from the past, just take the mistakes and learn from them. Make sure that this team understands who they are. I really am trying to get away from all those things.” \nComing off of the biggest comeback in school history, North Carolina isn’t concerned that it will be overconfident ahead of Wake Forest. While last season’s team played its worst games (against Miami and NC State) after its biggest wins (against GT and Duke), Jeff Schoettmer reiterated that this team has a resolve that led to a win after a 21-0 deficit – a feat he says last season’s team would’ve have been able to accomplish. \nUNC is sound in its thinking according to Schoettmer and “guys truly believe they can win any game they play.” \n“Coach (Gene) Chizik told us (Sunday) that he expects us to win this game defensively, so that means holding them to less points than our offense needs to score,” Schoettmer said. \nNorth Carolina knows it’s going to face a Top-15 defense in the Demon Deacons and is preparing to face two Wake Forest quarterbacks, but the offense is confident it can continue the efficiency its developed as the season’s gone on and the defense knows its handled game planning and playing against more than one quarterback before. \n“We know it’s going to be a dang battle,” Fedora said. \nBut this assured Tar Heel team thinks it’s a battle it can win if it fights right. \n“I haven’t seen (this attitude) around here in five years,” quarterback Marquise Williams said. “To have the type of guys we have and the mindset we have on this team this year especially, that’s what I want. It feels good to walk around knowing that you just beat one of the powerhouse teams in the ACC, just to keep building off of that. We have all the confidence in the world that we can do something special and that’s the goal, do something special, make people believe in this program.” \nFedora expects to see as much grit from Wake Forest as it showed in stopping Boston College in its 3-0 win Saturday, but likes his teams chances because he knows it knows what it can do, and because the players like their team and their chances too. \n“They like where they’re at; I’m not just talking about wins and losses,” Fedora said. “They like the chemistry of this team, they like the makeup of this team, there’s a bond amongst all of them that they’re really enjoying. \n“I think it’s a byproduct of everything that’s happened in the past and as they mature, what they’ve learned from it.” \nUNC started implementing its game plan in practice Sunday and is focused on knowing that a win against Wake Forest – which would make the team 2-0 in the league for the first time since 1997 – is simply the next step toward its goal of winning the state of North Carolina and the ACC Coastal Division Championship. \n“(To go 2-0 in the ACC) would be huge,” Schoettmer said. “(It’s) just another step closer to our goal, that’s the big thing. It would be big for us.” Credits", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T21:40:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T21:48:44.474+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
