Early in the 24-lap dash to the finish, only three points separated the ninth through 13th drivers, with Earnhardt and McMurray in the most tenuous positions.\nWhen the third race of the Chase was complete, Earnhardt and McMurray actually tied for the all-important 12th place in points. Advancing to the next round involved a tie-breaker, which amounted to the best finish in any of the three races. As it turned out, Earnhardt's third place on Sunday edged McMurray's fourth place in that tie-breaker.\nMcMurray was sixth and Earnhardt eighth when drivers lined up for the final restart. The pivotal moment came when McMurray worked his way past Kenseth for third place. But it was Earnhardt who ultimately took advantage of the battle, going to the high side to work his way around both drivers.\n\"(Earnhardt) did a tremendous job of getting around me on the outside,\" McMurray said. \"When I got around Matt on the restart, I was waving frantically, hoping he (Kenseth) would let me in--and I got down in front of him.\n\"I never expected the 88 to be able to get by me on the outside. He just did a really good job, and once he got in front of me, it's just hard to pass.\"\nEarnhardt saw his chance and seized it.\n\"They (McMurray and Kenseth) slow-rolled that corner real conservative,\" Earnhardt said. \"Jamie said he felt he got through there pretty good. But I saw the opportunity and just jumped outside to just hang it out there. Hopefully, (my car) wouldn't push or slip. It hooked up and we were right around him.\n\"After I got in front of him, it was just (a matter) of putting together real clean corners and just matching his lap times.\"\nEarnhardt, who entered the day on the bubble and was running 12th at the race's midway point, knew he was fortunate to even have a chance late in the race. With fewer than 50 laps remaining, he knew he had a wheel coming loose. Just then, an incident involving Brett Moffitt brought out the seventh of eight cautions, enabling Earnhardt to pit.\n\"The left rear was falling off,\" Earnhardt said. \"I was a couple laps from coming in. It was shaking real bad in the corner and it started shaking on decal. I knew it was a matter of time before it was coming off. It wasn't going to make 50 laps .... and I wasn't going to bash my head against a concrete wall somewhere for a damned loose wheel.\"\nHaving advanced to the second round, Earnhardt thinks he can fare better than a year ago.\n\"We'll see how these next few tracks stack up,\" he said. \"We've just got to get a little bit of luck and not ruin it for ourselves.\"\nHe thinks the 88 team might even have something for Kevin Harvick, the defending Sprint Cup champion, who delivered a victory when he needed it on Sunday to also advance to the Contender Round.\n\"I don't think there's a favorite (among the remaining 12 drivers),\" Earnhardt said. \"I know the No. 4 car shows up and wins when he has to (but) I think we can get in there and do just as good as them boys.\"\nMcMurray said he was not \"disappointed,\" even after the tie-breaker took him out of his first Chase appearance for Chip Ganassi Racing with Felix Sabates.\n\"Our goal at the beginning of the year was to make it into the Chase,\" he said. \"The unfortunate part is we didn't run good enough the first two races (16th at Chicagoland, 14th at New Hampshire).\n\"We ran great today. After we got a lap down, Matt (crew chief McCall) did a real good job with adjustments and getting it back to where we had a top-five car. Our team did an awesome job.\n\"I really thought that being consistent would get us in (to the next round). I guess it was close, but we just needed one more point.\"\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.sportsxchange.com/tsxfiles/topstories", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T22:05:48.857+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
