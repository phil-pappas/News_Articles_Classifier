I started off not really knowing what my main sport would be until like late middle school and field hockey I had played ever since I was younger with my friends. It was more for fun, though. It really wasn't until high school that things got more serious in terms of field hockey once I realized how good our school was. \nWhat was the reason you got into the sport? \nI've always been someone who has played a lot of sports and field hockey was one of them. My dad always pushed me to try everything. When I started playing, I had a lot of fun so I just kind of stuck with it. \nYou mention things got more serious once you reached high school. How much of an impact has it had on you being coached by someone with the background of someone like Martie Dyer? \nShe is just so into field hockey, sometimes I think that's all she thinks about. But it's amazing. She just really motivates us to be the best that we can be and is great about thinking ahead into the future in terms of putting us in the best position to be successful. She has so much confidence in our team and our abilities. \nRumor has it that she is still quite the player herself? \nOh yeah, definitely. She scored like three goals when we had our (parent/coach) game. She was going crazy. She always talks about her college experience and you know she knows what she's talking about. Also, in practice, if we aren't cutting off the ball or something, she will be the first to get out there and demonstrate. \nI hear you have a really big family, with you being a triplet and then also having older twin sisters. What's that like having so many siblings so close together in age? \nIt's actually awesome. We are all really close and we try to help each other get better in whatever we are doing. There have been lots of times where Alanna and I, or my sisters (Kristen and Kaitlyn) when they were here, would all just go out and play together. My dad would get out there too. It's a lot of fun. \nAre there times when things get pretty intense? \nNot really, well unless my brother (Donny) comes out and starts going crazy and ends up hurting someone. That has happened a few times, but really it's all fun. I think my brother and I are the ones who are most into sports, but everyone else is supportive and into it in their own way too. \nTalk to me a little bit about your decision to play lacrosse in college at Loyola University. \nFor lacrosse, recruiting starts really early. In the beginning, I didn't really realize how high up I could go. I started looking at the lower schools â€¦ but teams started emailing me and Loyola was actually the last school that ended up talking to me. I visited some other schools, but after I met with the coaches and the team and went to the school, I just knew that I wanted to go there. It just seemed like the best place for me. \nKnowing that lacrosse is your main focus collegiately, is it hard balancing that at all now during field hockey season? \nRight now I have lacrosse games on Sundays for my club team and it's almost a nice break. Lacrosse for my club team, since most of us have committed, it's not quite as serious now and that allows us to just go out and have fun and play. I mean, field hockey is obviously fun too, but this is also a little more serious. \nWith the field hockey regular season coming to a close and the stakes about to rise, what kind of goals are you guys setting? \nWe have a lot of talent on our team and we just have to put it all together and fix the things we haven't been doing. Like this year we have two losses already, but my freshman year we also had three losses in the regular season. So it doesn't mean we can't do it. We just have to believe in ourselves and fix what we have to fix. We can definitely reach our end goal of winning states.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:53:24.510+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
