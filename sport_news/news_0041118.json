(AP) - Dartmouth College has removed the new director of its Native American program from her position amid questions about her ancestry and tribal affiliation.\nThe Hanover, New Hampshire, Ivy League college says the distraction surrounding Susan Taffe (taf) Reed's hiring last month was preventing her from effectively doing her job.\nReed remains an employee. A college spokeswoman says officials are exploring ways she can contribute to the campus.\nReed is president of a nonprofit organization called Eastern Delaware Nation. She has said she's of mixed Native American and European ancestry.\nHer critics say she has misrepresented her background and note she's not a member of a federally recognized tribe.\nHer removal from the position was first reported by the Valley News ( http://bit.ly/1LUuzQS ).\n ", "external_links": ["http://bit.ly/1LUuzQS"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T07:35:04.461+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
