Don’t be surprised if the game is a low-scoring affair.\nFalls City (7-0) has three shutouts and has allowed only 48 points this season. Louise (6-0) has allowed 51 points and has two shutouts.\nBoerne at Fredericksburg, 7:30 p.m. Friday: The Battlin’ Billies can remain in a tie for first place in District 14-4A-I with a win, while Boerne needs a victory to avoid a 0-2 start in league play after last week’s 42-28 loss against Taylor.\nBy the numbers\n3: Consecutive wins for Antonian over TAPPS 2-I rival Central Catholic - its longest winning streak in the series.\nThe Apaches have outscored Central Catholic by a combined 110-35 the past three meetings. The Buttons (4-2, 1-0) had won 21 of the previous 22 games before Antonian (3-3, 0-1) snapped its drought.\nThe squads meet at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Benson 66 Stadium.\n4.7: Points per game Blanco’s defense has allowed through six games this season. The Panthers (6-0) have registered two shutouts and haven’t allowed more than seven points in any game.\nThe point total is better than a year ago at this time when Blanco yielded 5.5 points en route to finishing 14-1 and advancing to the Class 3A Division II state semifinals. The Panthers play at Nixon-Smiley at 7:30 p.m. Friday.\n45.7: Points per game Brandeis has averaged during its three-game winning streak, including twice scoring more than 50 points. The Broncos (3-3) have averaged 526 yards en route to wins over New Braunfels, Taft and Holmes.\nBrandeis averaged 14 points and 259.3 yards in its first three games under new coach Jeff Fleener - losses to Johnson, Judson and Pflugerville Hendrickson.\nThe Broncos play Marshall in a District 27-6A Zone B contest at 7:30 p.m. Friday at Farris Stadium.\ntthomas@express-news.net\nTwitter: en_terrence", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:20:31.701+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
