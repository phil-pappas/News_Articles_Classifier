Patriarch Jim Phillips bought the property north of Albuquerque in 1962. (Courtesy of Jan Phillips)\nThe future of a longstanding Albuquerque-area fishing hole is in doubt now that owners have announced their plans to sell the property.\nShady Lakes director Jan Phillips said Wednesday her family — which has owned the land since 1962 — intends to put the pond-covered parcel on the market, raising questions about whether it would resume fishing operations next year or ever again. It is scheduled to close for the 2015 season on Nov. 1.\nThe family hasn’t formally listed the property for sale, but plans to offer the land by itself while giving the buyer the option to also purchase the related fishing and water lily businesses. “I would love to see Shady Lakes stay open to the public as it is now,” Phillips said. “I think that somebody could take it far beyond even what I was able to do with it.”\nThe Phillips family went into business when patriarch Jim Phillips bought a onetime bait farm just north of Albuquerque in 1962. The family has long joked that he did it in the throes of a midlife crisis. The former Journal ad salesman moved his wife, Joanne, and five children to the valley from the Northeast Heights, and the clan set about recasting the cottonwood-shrouded property as a fishing destination. They rid the ponds of carp and suckers and stocked them with game fish like rainbow trout and black bass. A water garden business grew up alongside it. All five Phillips kids — Jeanne, Jill, Jay, John and Jan — had a role in the operation from a young age.\n“They made it work,” Phillips said of her parents, “but the secret to their business success was cheap child labor.”\nPhillips said the water garden component flourished in the 1990s, peaking in the mid-aughts before falling during the recession. Fishing, though, has remained a popular attraction, even through economic downturns. An estimated 10,000 people still patronize Shady Lakes every year, she said.\nThe decision to sell is not strictly financial; Phillips said she and her three remaining siblings made the collective decision to move on. Jan — who owns the on-site businesses and shares ownership of the land with her siblings — said she’s planning to relocate to Colorado.\n“We lost dad in 1993 and mom passed away in 2011, so I’ve always known it was going to come to an end,” she said. “This is a good thing. It’s time to go.”\nThe family has not yet determined an asking price. The property, off N.M. 313, is next to Sandia Pueblo. It encompasses 12 acres, including eight acres of water.\nPhillips said if it doesn’t sell by next spring, she would consider opening to fishermen in 2016 but it would be a temporary arrangement.\nShady Lakes has two more weekends of activity before closing for the 2015 season. It’s open Friday-Sunday and again Oct. 30-Nov. 1.\nPhillips said the site has given her a lifetime’s worth of wonderful memories, from the mud fights she used to have with her siblings to the delightful squeals she’s heard from visiting children reeling in their first fish. People often approach her in public to share their own experiences; once, she said, she was visiting Claude Monet’s famous gardens in Giverny, France, when a stranger commented to her that Shady Lakes was prettier.\n“There’s no other place that I’ve seen that is like Shady Lakes,” she said.", "external_links": ["http://main.abqjournal.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/201188-450x600.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-22T00:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:46:42.255+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
