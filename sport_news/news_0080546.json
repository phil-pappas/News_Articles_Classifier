They then hastily used the wrong substance to reattach it.\nIn room 55, on the same floor as the mask's permanent display, a team of experts have been examining the mask to ascertain the most appropriate method and substances to use in its restoration.\nGerman restorer Christian Eckmann, a project leader, told Ahram Online the team is carrying out microscopic studies on the mask to inspect its condition and work out how best to go about removing the epoxy resin applied a year ago.\nEckmann said those studies will be completed next week and restoration will start immediately after.\n\"At the moment I cannot specify a completion date, but it could last 30 days,\" Eckmann told Ahram Online, adding that safely removing the epoxy resin will require patience.\nEckmann and antiquities minister Mamdouh Eldamaty will hold a press conference at the museum on Tuesday afternoon where they will announce details of the restoration project.\nTutankhamun", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=edQ5r4Utjsc?rel=1"], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:22:18.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
