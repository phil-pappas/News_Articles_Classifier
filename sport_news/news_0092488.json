Pakistan will need another seven wickets to force a 1-0 lead in the three-match series after Younis's brilliant 118 helped them set a daunting 491-run target for England. At close, England were 130/3 with Joe Root unbeaten on a fighting 59 and Jonny Bairstow on six as they still need 361 for an unlikely victory. It will be a tough task for the England batsmen as the pitch was offering turn with leg-spinner Yasir Shah and left- armer Zulfiqar Babar posing a real threat. Earlier Pakistan declared 35 minutes after lunch, with Younis scoring his 31st century, while Misbah-ul-Haq made 87 and Asad Shafiq contributed 79. England were tottering at 45/2 at tea but Ian Bell (46) and Root defied Paksitan’s bowlers during their 102-run stand for the third wicket and looked to take England safely to stumps. But Babar broke the partnership when a ball from him brushed Bell’s gloveand Younis took an easy catch in the slips. Brief scores : Pakistan: 378 and 354 for 6 dec (Younis 118, Misbah 87, Shafiq 79); England: 242 and 130 for 3 (Root 59no, Bairstow 6no). — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T06:12:01.454+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
