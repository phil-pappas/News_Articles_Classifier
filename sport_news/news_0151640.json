Teammates in the Chicago Cubs’ dugout get into it, and the same goes for everyone in the bullpen. \n“It’s awesome,” Castro said. “It’s the most fun thing that we’ve got all year. The fans have been crazy when that song (plays), get up. I feel really appreciated even if they don’t understand what (the song) says. But they still like it.” \nWrigley Field is rocking these days with the Cubs headed to the playoffs for the first time since 2008. And Castro’s at-bats have become a big event. \nIt’s quite a turn considering many fans wanted to see him get traded. But as soon as they hear the song “Ando En La Versace” by Omega blasting through the ballpark, they go crazy. \nIt’s catchy tune, with a fast-paced beat. And Castro is rocking and rolling along these days. \nSo are the Cubs, with 97 wins and headed to a wild-card game at Pittsburgh on Wednesday. \nBenched in early August after struggling most of the season, the three-time All-Star is on quite a tear. \nHe raised his average about 30 points over the past month and a half to .265. And while his future with the Cubs remains unclear because of the emergence of rookie Addison Russell and the presence of another young infielder in Javier Baez, the 25-year-old Castro came up big down the stretch. \n“Everybody’s got the same goal here and the goal is to win,” he said. “That’s the most important thing. Keep working hard, trust myself. I never put my head down. I just kept focused. When they give you the chance, try to take every opportunity.” \nCastro has been a lightning rod over the years with fans because of mental lapses in the field. But he has been at his best the past two months - and that goes beyond his performance during games. \nHe made the most of what could have been an awkward situation, when manager Joe Maddon had Russell move from second base to replace Castro as the everyday shortstop as part of a lineup shuffle. \nMaddon was concerned that a 25-year-old with nearly 1,000 hits would check out mentally, that the Cubs would lose him emotionally for the rest of the season. It could have been a dicey situation. \nCastro regrouped rather than sulked and came on in a big way at the plate while adjusting to playing second. \n“He doesn’t make excuses,” Maddon said. “This kid doesn’t make excuses. He’s accountable to everything. How can you not like him?” \nRussell called Castro “an upfront guy” who accepted the switch.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T09:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T12:22:09.649+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
