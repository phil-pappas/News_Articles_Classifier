Bridich, who wears a poker face when talking to the media, is not tipping his hand.\n\"Are we going to look for pitching on the free-agent market? Yeah,\" he said last week. \"Are we going to make a play on what you would consider 'front-line guys?' I don't know yet, to be honest with you.\"\nThe Rockies' biggest pitching acquisition this year was signing right-hander Kyle Kendrick to a one-year contract worth $5.5 million. The former Phillies back-of-the-rotation starter wasn't signed by Colorado until Feb. 4.\nWATCH: Is Colorado Rockies third baseman Nolan Arenado an MVP candidate?\nKendrick turned out to be a disaster, finishing 7-13 with a 6.32 ERA. He went 2-6 with a 7.62 ERA at Coors Field and gave up 21 of his 33 home runs there.\nBridich is hopeful that pitchers such as Jordan Lyles (coming back from toe surgery), Tyler Chatwood (returning from Tommy John surgery) and perhaps Eddie Butler (who under- performed and was demoted to Triple-A Albuquerque) will help upgrade the Rockies' rotation.\nAdvertisement As for wheeling and dealing to bring in better pitching, Bridich said he is open to that, noting that he did it twice during his first year as the team's GM. Last winter, Colorado traded infielder Josh Rutledge to the Angels for hard-throwing reliever Jairo Diaz, who came on strong at season's end to finish with a 3.37 ERA and a 1.16 WHIP in 19 innings.\nJust before the trade deadline this summer, Bridich shipped star shortstop Troy Tulowitzki and veteran reliever LaTroy Hawkins to Toronto for veteran shortstop Jose Reyes and right-handed pitching prospects Jeff Hoffman, Miguel Castro and Jesus Tinoco.\n\"I think (trading for pitching) is always going to be a realistic option for us,\" Bridich said.\nArenado player of month. Nolan Arenado, the Rockies' two-time Gold Glove third baseman who had a breakthrough season at the plate, was selected National League player of the month for September.\nIn 28 games in September, Arenado hit .339 (38-for-112) and led the major leagues with 11 home runs, 32 RBIs and 79 total bases. His 38 hits led the National League, while his .705 slugging percentage ranked second.\nIt is Arenado's first player of the month award.\nAccording to the Elias Sports Bureau, the 24-year-old Arenado joined former teammates Tulowitzki (15 homers, 40 RBIs in 2010) and Matt Holliday (10 homers, 34 RBIs in 2006) as the only Colorado players with a double-digit home run total and more than 30 RBIs during the month of September.\nWATCH: Woody Paige and Les Shapiro discuss the latest around Major League Baseball\nFriday night in San Francisco, Arenado led to the Rockies to a 9-3 victory over the Giants, hitting his 42nd home run of the season.\nArenado finished the season with 42 homers, tied with Washington's Bryce Harper for the NL lead, and led the majors with 130 RBIs.\nHe became the first Rockies player to lead the NL in home runs since 1997, when outfielder Larry Walker blasted 49.\nArenado also became the first Colorado player to lead the majors in RBIs since first baseman Andres Galarraga drove in 150 runs in 1996.\nArenado finished the season with 89 extra-base hits, the most by a third baseman in big-league history. He passed Atlanta's Chipper Jones, who had 87 in 1999.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T17:49:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:26:07.635+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
