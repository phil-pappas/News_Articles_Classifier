S tarting quarterback Alex Smith was the recipient of 13 of those and is on pace to be sacked the third most of any quarterback in a season in NFL history. \nDunlap has 2.5 sacks already this season and would have had another in last Sunday's win at the Baltimore Ravens if Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco hadn't gotten rid of the ball and been called for intentional grounding. \n\"I know I want the record for sacks,\" said Dunlap, who had eight last season and whose single-season career high is 9.5. \"I’m chasing 23. We’ve got a few opportunities this week against the Chiefs. I knew they were struggling, but I didn’t see the stats of how bad it was. At the end of the day we have to go out there and capitalize on the plays, otherwise they’ll stay at 13 (for Smith) after our game and balance out.\" \nKansas City allowed seven sacks in Monday night's loss in Green Bay, which Bengals defensive coordinator Paul Guenther said was more a product of how the game went with the Packers taking a big first-half lead. \n\"I think the game got so out of hand so quick kind of like our game (Baltimore) if it was 21-0 (like it almost was) at halftime I would have said, 'Hey, listen if they get five yards on a running play so be it, let's pin our ears back,' \" said Guenther. \"Green Bay was able to put the rushers in there and not really play the run and not really care much more about the run, because that wasn't going to beat them.\" \nKansas City coach Andy Reid took part of the blame for the 13 times Smith has been sacked. \n\"I start with the calls,\" said Reid. \"We’ve got to make sure we give him the right calls in the right situation to get that done and then we’ve got to take care of business everywhere else.\" \nThe Chiefs have a player in linebacker Justin Houston who made a run at Michael Strahan's single-season record of 22.5 sacks when he recorded 22 last season. Houston has three sacks in three games this season and over his last 30 games recorded 36 sacks. \nDunlap is an admirer of Houston's work. \n\"Any time someone gets 22 sacks, you’re going to go pull it up and see what he did, because obviously the goal is to be the sack guy and lead the league in sacks,\" said Dunlap. \"The guys who’ve led the league in sacks, I typically try to look at their tape in the offseason and see what they did and also study my plays as well, more importantly, to see what plays I left out there. That way you get better. He just rushed so strong. He’s a quick guy who can bull rush, get up under your pad level. You’ve got to understand the way he likes to do certain different looks.\"Guenther said he encourages Dunlap and all his linemen to watch their peers work. \n\"I pull up (film) of 30 of the top rush guys in the league and I try to say, 'Hey, your body type, your skill set is a lot like these three guys, take a look at what they're doing,' and we'll sit and watch just so they can understand what other guys are doing around the league,\" said Guenther. \nIt will help Dunlap moving forward if the Bengals continue to play from ahead in most games. They trailed for the first time all season in the fourth quarter of the Ravens game after C.J. Mosley returned Andy Dalton's fumble for a touchdown. \nDunlap admits he's chomping at the bit for Sunday's game with a focus on stopping running back Jamaal Charles on the ground first. \n\"We see a few opportunities out there,\" he said. \"As a D line, you always get excited when you see games like this, but at the end of the day you have to go out there and make the plays. If we don’t stop the run, we won’t get to rush the passer anyway.\" \nFollow us on Twitter @Local12 and LIKE us on Facebook for updates! \nTo get \"The Skinny\" on local sports be sure to follow Local12 Digital Sports Columnist/Editor Richard Skinner on Twitter @Local12Skinny and LIKE him on Facebook for updates or email him raskinner@sbgtv.com.
