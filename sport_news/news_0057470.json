Noting that Jacob deGrom looked “like he could use some time,” Collins, asked about the possibility of giving Harvey an extra start, said, “There’s a possibility, yeah.”\nReally? Must be World Series fever, when ego and manning up overtake common sense and pragmatism.\nIf Harvey really is called upon to pitch three times, either his agent, Scott Boras, should drop Harvey as a client or Harvey should cut ties with Boras for allowing it to happen.\nBoras had it right during the summer when he raised the issue of an innings limit for Harvey and his surgically repaired elbow.

Duty to team trumps duty to one’s self. Teams rent players’ bodies. They pay many millions for the use of strong arms, powerful legs, broad shoulders.
