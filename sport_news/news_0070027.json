However, “in light of his resignation and based on the wishes of the complainant,” that investigation has now ended, the COC said in a statement. Aubut, a lawyer and former co-owner of the National Hockey League’s Quebec Nordiques franchise until it relocated in 1995, was a strong advocate for Toronto to bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. The city ultimately decided against a bid. The COC announced that four-time Olympian Tricia Smith would replace Aubut as interim President.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T07:21:24.152+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
