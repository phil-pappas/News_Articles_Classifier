In 2014, Viviano was the quarterback at the start of the game. By the end of a 50-36 loss, Viviano was on the sideline with a season-ending concussion, the defensive secondary was in shambles due to multiple injuries and the Warriors were staggering with a 1-6 record and their sixth straight loss. This Friday in Hampton, Winnacunnet will host the Clippers. The Warriors are 3-3 and riding high after upsetting Pinkerton Academy, 17-7, last Friday in Derry. Portsmouth is a struggling 1-5 squad. It still has a passing attack that can pose challenges but the Clipper defense has allowed 38 points a game. “This year, I think we’re more prepared than we were last year for their throwing game,” Viviano said. “We have some really good defensive backs and some good pass rushers on the outside and the inside. We’re a whole different team this year, I think.” A significant difference stems from Viviano’s switch from quarterback to wide receiver, which also freed him up to become a full-time starter at cornerback on defense. Those changes evolved over the summer but the process started last year in Portsmouth when Viviano was injured and then-freshman Patrick MacDougall was forced into the game at quarterback. “Pat started his great journey as a freshman that game,” Viviano said. “Now he’s really matured. I’d say he’s one of the best quarterbacks I’ve seen, at least this year.” MacDougall has started every game and Viviano has developed into his favorite passing target, leading the team in receptions (11) and touchdown catches (three). Make no mistake; Winnacunnet is first and foremost a rushing offense. That’s why Viviano said the thing he needs to work on the most as a receiver is blocking on the perimeter. “I still need to work on the stock blocking,” Viviano said. “As far as the routes and the catching of the ball, I’m doing pretty good with that.” Viviano dismissed the notion that Winnacunnet will be prone to a letdown against Portsmouth. “Even if we had lost (to Pinkerton), we are all excited and we want to play football. We love it,” Viviano said. “Now that the playoff hope is still there it gives us a little more energy.” Portsmouth is coming off a 43-14 home loss against Exeter. In that game the Clippers fell behind 23-0 and trailed 30-7 at the half. Portsmouth coach Brian Pafford was hospitalized in the week prior to the Exeter game, leading to long-time assistant Tim Hopley filling in as the interim head coach against Exeter. Pafford’s status for Friday’s game is uncertain but he did attend practice on Wednesday. Viviano’s more important role this Friday will probably be on the defensive side of the ball, matched up on the outside with one of the Clipper receivers while also being ready to come up and make a tackle on perimeter runs. Offensively look for Winnacunnet to continue to do what it has done best – run the ball with balance between senior backs Mike Lewis (112 carries, 703 yards) and Brian Auffant (93-587). When the backs and line are grinding out yardage in big chunks, MacDougall has been effective with play-action passes. For the season MacDougall has completed 37 of 61 passes for 468 yards with five scores against four interceptions. Viviano said he still takes some snaps and does some quarterback drills to stay ready for emergency duties but he’s adapted to his new roles – which has included work as a punt and kick returner. Notes Winnacunnet’s defense is coming off its best effort of the season against Pinkerton, in part because it did a good job on third down. The Astros, who had won 17 straight games, were 4-of-12 in third-down conversions and just two of seven in the first half. … Junior defensive end Phillip Antonio had two quarterback sacks. Senior Gabe Paster was also able to get good pressure at times on Pinkerton QB Ryan Albecht who was hurried into several key overthrows when he had receivers open. … Senior Bailey Nasser, who has been used primarily as a tight end, got into the game on defense in the second half and made a couple of solid hits.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T20:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T20:17:40.826+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
