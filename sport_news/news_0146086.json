Akers kicked for the Eagles from 2000-10, was named to the Pro Bowl six times and is easily considered the best kicker in team history.\nIt’s not that Akers doesn’t think Sturgis is good. Rather, second chances seem to be the exception more than the rule for kickers. Four teams have changed kickers in the past two weeks alone, including the Eagles, who signed Sturgis after Cody Parkey suffered a season-ending groin injury.\nAnd Sturgis’ misses – both from 33 yards on the field goal and extra point – were the difference in the Eagles’ 23-20 loss to Washington.\nAkers himself experienced that agony. Washington signed him the week leading up to its game against Seattle on Sept. 20, 1998. Akers missed a 48-yard field goal and a 49-yarder that day. He didn’t get a second chance until the Eagles signed him two years later.\n“I was surprised that there isn’t that loyalty and we don’t give a guy a chance to settle in,” Akers said. “My first bad game and that was it. … So I’m glad that they’re giving him that time, from that aspect. Hopefully, he can settle in and take over.”\nAkers, who wrote a book titled “Winning in Spite Of,” due out at the end of the year, was speaking Tuesday morning at the Delaware Leadership Prayer Breakfast at the Chase Center on the Riverfront. His book details how he overcame obstacles on the field – getting released three times, having to kick in the former NFL Europe league – and off the field with personal and financial hardships.\nAkers knows full well the scrutiny that Sturgis is under. Akers said he was a perfectionist when he played, which didn’t help.\n“I would take misses really hard, to the point where you can’t even enjoy your makes as much because you’re only as good as your next kick,” he said. “A majority of the ones I missed, thank goodness, didn’t decide the outcome of the game. There were some that obviously did, and you remember those a lot more.\n“My biggest thing was I hated letting down the organization, the team, the fans, and ultimately you’re letting down your family because that’s your profession.”\nDELAWAREONLINE\nEagles’ offensive linemen have health, blocking issues\nIt’s not much different from what Sturgis said Tuesday.\n“[Monday], I was hurting,” Sturgis said. “I can’t lie about that. But you wake up and you’ve got to be ready to go. You can’t sulk.”\nSturgis was asked if he had doubts as to whether he’d be returning this week.\n“That’s not something you worry about,” he replied. “You worry about getting better for next week.”\nAkers said he thinks there’s even less patience with kickers than when he played. The new rule moving the extra-point attempts back from the equivalent of a 20-yard field goal to a 33-yarder only magnifies the pressure on kickers.\nSure, kickers are still making 94 percent of the extra points this season, down from 99.2 percent last season, when it was practically automatic. But Akers expects that percentage to drop once the weather turns colder.\n“We haven’t even had real weather yet,” Akers said. “Let’s start seeing what it’s like in Pittsburgh in December when someone needs to make an extra point. Then all of a sudden you don’t make the playoffs because you miss and someone else is kicking in a dome and they hit their extra point.\n“The league is getting what they wanted. So now, they’ve got to live with the ramifications.”\nDELAWAREONLINE\nDelaware Sports Hall-of-Famer Bill Skinner dies\nAkers said he still gets asked often if he ever thinks about kicking again. He last played for Detroit in 2013. The subject jokingly came up among several of those lined up Tuesday for his autograph, in light of the Eagles’ struggles at the position. A few even offered to drive him up to the Eagles’ practice facility.\nBut Akers, who’s 40, said he has no intentions of coming back.\n“When the phone stops ringing, you kind of face the reality,” he said. “I’m 40. I’m not who I used to be. I don’t have the ability to hit 70-yard field goals in practice anymore.”\nBesides, Akers is enjoying his family time in Nashville and writing his book about using principles from the Bible to overcome obstacles.\n“The aspect of writing wasn’t that I had to write a book,” he said. “But it was things I preach on, and part of my message … is biblical application with life illustrations, to recognize how you’re winning in spite of [everything] and meeting the challenges to go further.”\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com .
