They're expected to make that decision at their Nov. 9 meeting.\nOregon's small but growing gray wolf population reached a milestone this year, going three straight years with four or more breeding pairs in the state. Under the state's wolf management plan, that triggers a review of the animals' protected status.\nOregon was once home to a large wolf population, but the animals were eradicated from the state in the mid-20th century against a backdrop of state-sponsored bounty hunting. Since wolves re-established in Oregon after crossing the border from Idaho in 2008, the state's known wolf population has grown to 85, not including pups born this year.\nThe decision of whether or not to remove wolves from the endangered list has become one of the most politically-charged issues on the commission's docket.\nCommissioners are under immense pressure from groups on both sides of the debate, with ranchers pushing for permission to kill wolves and conservationists arguing existing protections are too lax.\nThe Oregon Cattlemen's Association, which represents the livestock industry, has lobbied for a delisting for years, with some arguing Oregon should have no wolves at all. Predators pose a threat to their livelihood, ranchers say, and they want the ability to shoot them in defense of their herds.\nIt's illegal to shoot a wolf in Oregon except under special circumstances.\nMeanwhile, wildlife advocates argue 85 wolves in a state the size of Oregon does not constitute a healthy population. If the state removes protections, they argue, existing problems with poaching could grow worse. Police have investigated five wolf poaching incidents since wolves returned to the state, but have made no arrests.\nThe fish and wildlife department has received thousands of public comments in matter, most in support of continued protections for Oregon's wolves.\nIf wolves leave the list, little will change about way wolves are treated in Oregon. The Oregon Wolf Plan would still govern who can kill wolves, and when.\nA 10-year review of the plan is scheduled to begin once commissioners rule on wolves' protected status in Oregon. That review could lead to significant changes in the way wildlife officials manage Oregon's wolves.\nJust getting into Oregon's great wolf debate?
