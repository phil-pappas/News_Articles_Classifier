This is because you work with about 36 people which consist of not only the players, but the medical staff and the technical staff. \n“You need to be in tune with man managent skills and make sure you try to keep everybody happy. And if a coach doesn’t have that, he will struggle. \n“It is the same problem Jose Mourinho is having in Chelsea. If you have a team where the players are very loyal to you, then you suddenly change, believe me it will hit you. And when it hits you, it will be very bad,” Amokachi said. \nHe remarked further: “For Oliseh and his boys, I am sure it hasn’t come to that, but there should be respect when it comes to players and coaches. \n“I have worked with different coaches; both local and foreign, and I have learnt a lot when it comes to managing players. \n“I will urge Oliseh to be one with his players because if not, it might end up causing not only Oliseh but Nigeria as a whole.” Related", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T17:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T18:54:01.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
