It’s a flaw that led to one of the two interceptions he threw in Ottawa during their most recent game when the Argos earned a well-deserved and big-time win.\n“What we like him to do, and you can’t do it all the time, is what we call tracking the receiver with your body,’’ began Argos head coach Scott Milanovich, a one-time quarterback. “If you fight your body and your hips, it makes you less accurate. The best of them (quarterbacks) do it and it’s something he (Harris) continues to work on.”\nEvery once in a while during practice, Harris is picked off when his fundamentals are poor.\nIn Ottawa, RedBlacks linebacker Damaso Munoz produced a pick six off Harris for just that reason.\n“He was off his spot,’’ said Milanovich. “He was kind of in the middle of running and throwing.”\nWhat Milanovich now requires from Harris is to be clean which, in football, means protecting the football and making good decisions.\n“He has to eliminate turnovers,’’ said the coach. “I like to see him with a clean scorecard.”\nThere’s a lot at stake Tuesday night in Ottawa when the Argos return for what is technically a home game for Toronto.\nA win by the Argos and the East will feature a three-way tie following Hamilton’s late-game collapse Friday night to visiting Calgary.\nThe RedBlacks and Ticats then play a home and home, while the Argos should be benefitting from a home-friendly end to the season, only there is no place to call home for this nomadic team.\nGiven the position he plays, when Harris is on the Argos are in a position to win games.\nThere was a three-game losing streak when Harris wasn’t good, but he wasn’t alone as the Argos never could summon their best in a defeat to Edmonton and back-to-back setbacks against the Ticats.\nThe Argos, meanwhile, will remain Harris’ team.\nRicky Ray, still recovering from off-season shoulder surgery, is looking much better in workouts, and the Argos are hoping he can be ready to enter a game if Harris gets injured.\nOttawa is riding the hot arm of Henry Burris, but getting pressure on Harris is paramount on Tuesday.\nThe Redblacks are coming off a short week, having played host to a listless Alouettes team Thursday night, while the Argos are once again rested and getting healthier.\nISAAC'S RETURN WILL BE A WELCOME SIGHT\nWith so much adversity tossed in his direction, overcoming tears in his hamstring and knee seemed minor compared to the family and personal travails Brandon Isaac has been forced to deal with the past few seasons.\nHis spirit remains strong and Isaac’s younger brother, left paralyzed following a car accident, is showing signs of progress.\nIsaac’s wife is carrying the couple’s first child, a girl, while the veteran linebacker is poised to return to the lineup for the first time since his injury against Ottawa on Aug. 23.\n“I’m feeling great, but I’ve been out a little while,’’ said Isaac, a veteran piece on defence the Argos have missed. “There are things I’ve got to get used to. My timing is still pretty good, but my man-to-man coverage has to get a lot better. I’m moving around, making things happen.\n“The defence is playing well. I thought we played well against Henry (Ottawa QB Burris), but he’s on fire, right now. Hopefully we can contain him again next Tuesday.”\nBurris has been lighting it up, but when the Argos visited Ottawa last Saturday night the RedBacks never led, Toronto’s defence keeping Burris in check as he finished by completing 27 of 38 attempts for 313 yards.\nWhen Ottawa came to Toronto earlier in the year, Burris was near flawless, but the Argos defence not yield a receiving major.\nStill, he did complete 32 of 36 passes for 426 yards.\nIsaac got hurt in that one, came to the sidelines and then re-entered the game. It was later revealed he had an MCL tear and a hamstring tear.\nOnce the swelling subsided, Isaac spent his time strengthening the knee and hamstring.\n“It still needs it (strengthening), but I feel I’m in a position where I can get out there and help the team out,’’ he said. “It was a Grade 1 tear, meaning no surgery was required.”\nIt’s no coincidence the Argos looked lost in losing three straight without Isaac until the team bounced back with a win in Ottawa.\nSponsored Links See All Sponsored Links\nArgos' Harris trying to keep in step\nBy Frank Zicarelli , Toronto Sun First posted: Saturday, October 03, 2015 06:33 PM EDT | Updated: Saturday, October 03, 2015 06:46 PM EDT\nThere are so many subtleties and nuances to the quarterback position that only the most astute observer would appreciate the finer points of the game’s most pivotal slot.\nFor many, a quarterback is measured in yards, touchdowns, wins and losses, but nothing is ever gained if the fundamentals aren’t solid.\nAnyone who has ever seen Trevor Harris go through his pre-game routine will see how he spends time working on his footwork, the foundation for every throw a quarterback attempts.\nAt times, Harris’ footwork is off, leading to errant throws.
