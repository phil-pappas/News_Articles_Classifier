North Reading girls not surprising anyone this fall High School Soccer Mac Cerullo Eagle-Tribune \nComing in as the No. 9 seed and featuring a lineup heavy with underclassmen, the North Reading girls soccer team wasn’t expected to do much in last fall’s Division 3 North tournament. Then the Hornets blew out Greater Lawrence, upset top-seed and Cape Ann League champion Newburyport and then shut out Swampscott en route to the program’s first North Final appearance in 15 years. \nIf this month’s been any indication, the Hornets won’t be sneaking up on anybody this year. \nWith eight starters back, North Reading has raced out to a 7-1-1 start and is right in the thick of the race for the Cape Ann League title. Since dropping a tough 1-0 loss to first-place Masconomet in the season opener, North Reading has gone unbeaten in eight games and is now riding a five-game winning streak following Friday’s 5-1 win over Georgetown. \nProbably the biggest factor in North Reading’s success has been junior goalie Katerina Hassapis. An All-CAL selection last year as a sophomore, Hassapis wasted no time establishing her place as one of the area’s top netminders. In the team’s second game, she made 11 saves to shut out a revenge-minded Newburyport, and then in the next game against Pentucket, she made 12 saves in the 2-0 win -- a game in which she also scored the game-winning goal. \nOverall Hassapis has allowed just four goals in nine games, and coach Sean Killeen said the Hornets can beat anyone if she’s on the field. \n“She’s just tremendous,” Killeen said. “When we’re playing a lot of the [big CAL] schools, she’s been able to keep us competitive. Every time we step on the field with her we have a chance to win.” \nThough Hassapis is the team’s rock, she’s certainly not the only player who has helped build the Hornets into a contender. Junior defensemen Giana Moscaritolo and Jessica Muise have each played every minute of every game at outside back, junior striker Marissa Zarella has picked up right where she left off a year ago (10 goals in 2014, 6 so far in 2015), and first-year varsity sophomores Kirsten Bradley and Karlie Vesey (4 goals, 3 assists) have made an immediate impact at midfield. \n“Karlie is strong on the ball, does a really good job releasing her shot when she has an opportunity,” Killeen said, adding that she had the goal of the day on Friday against Georgetown. “She almost knocked the goal over she hit the crossbar so hard, and it went straight down and in.” \nWith a roster heavy with juniors, North Reading figures to have a bright future, but as far as this season goes, the big test should be coming within the next two weeks. North Reading faces winless Rockport on Tuesday, after that the Hornets run the gauntlet of the CALs three best teams, with a date against unbeaten Hamilton-Wenham (9-0) followed by rematches against Masconomet (9-1) and Newburyport (5-2-1. \nHow North Reading handles that stretch should tell us a lot going into the postseason. \nUndefeated yet unsatisfied \nNormally if a team is undefeated a month into the season, it means things are going well and the team is in a strong position going into the second half. Well, that isn’t exactly the case for the Central Catholic boys team, who are technically undefeated, but at 2-0-4 they’re not exactly dominating their competition. \nAs far as defense goes, Central has been phenomenal. The Raiders have allowed just three goals in six games this season, recording three shutouts along the way, and goalie Justin Dansereau and defender Adam Morris have had a lot to do with that. \nThe problem for Central is that the Raiders just can’t seem to score. So far Central’s only successful offensive games have come against Lawrence and Methuen, who are both still winless, and other than that the Raiders have been stymied. \nIt’s particularly notable that Central’s three shutouts all ended in scoreless ties. You sneak a goal or two past the other keeper in any of those games, and suddenly Central’s position looks a lot more secure. Central will have to hope that those missed opportunities don’t come back to haunt them as the season goes along. \nKnights’ streak broken \nYou knew it couldn’t last forever. The North Andover boys team saw its shutout streak end at 550 minutes on Tuesday after surrendering a late goal in its 3-1 win over Chelmsford. North Andover went on to tie Dracut 2-2 on Thursday, but at 7-1-1 the Knights still stand as the area’s top boys team through the month of September. \nHillies rising \nA week ago the Haverhill girls team looked to be in dire straits, but now after going 3-0 this past week, the Hillies are now 4-3-2 and right back in the thick of the tournament conversation. The big win for Haverhill came on Tuesday, when the Hillies upset Methuen 1-0 to hand the Rangers just their second loss of the year. Danielle Stratoti scored the winner for Haverhill and Jessica Kramer made 8 saves to record the shutout. \nRangers walk it off \nThough Tuesday’s loss was a big setback, Methuen recovered nicely enough, beating Lawrence 10-0 on Thursday to get back in the win column. Nicole Langlois (9 goals, 5 assists) had a hat trick, and seven other players scored as well, including goalie Megan Langlois, who also helped record the shutout. \nBig games in New Hampshire \nA couple of big games in New Hampshire this week. On the boys side, Londonderry (5-2-2) is set to host Manchester Central (7-3) on Wednesday at 4 p.m., and on Friday Salem (5-3-2) will host first-place Bedford (8-1) for its biggest test of the year. \nFor the girls, the showdown between Londonderry (8-1) and Manchester Central (7-1), at Central Wednesday at 4 p.m., should establish the winner as the clear No. 2 in the standings behind unbeaten Pinkerton, who will look to improve to 11-0 on Monday against Spaulding (4-7).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-04T10:07:06.523+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
