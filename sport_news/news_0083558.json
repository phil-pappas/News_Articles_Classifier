Swiss authorities have approved extradition of Julio Rocha, a former FIFA official from Nicaragua who has been held in Switzerland since his May 27 arrest in the corruption scandal that has toppled several leaders of international soccer.\nRocha has 30 days to appeal the decision by the Federal Office of Justice before he will be sent to the federal court in Brooklyn to enter a plea on charges that he demanded and accepted a six-figure bribe for steering a lucrative television broadcast contract to a co-conspirator in 2011.\nThree of Rocha’s co-defendants are in the U.S. and have entered not-guilty pleas, while 10 others remain abroad while prosecutors from the Eastern District of New York work to extract them from countries that include Switzerland, Trinidad and Argentina.\nRocha is unique among defendants in that the U.S. isn’t the only country where he is wanted; law enforcement in Rocha’s native Nicaragua asked the Swiss to extradite him in August, and Rocha agreed to the request, but the Swiss have decided the U.S. should get him first.\nRELATED: SWISS TO EXTRADITE FIFA EXEC COSTAS TAKKAS\n“The FOJ has now decided that Rocha will be extradited first to the USA, while simultaneously approving his subsequent extradition to Nicaragua,” the FOJ said in a news release Thursday. “The key point in this decision is the fact that the US authorities have been conducting wide-ranging criminal proceedings against a number of individuals for some time now. These individuals are already in the USA, or are to be extradited to the USA. Most of the evidence and witnesses are also located in the USA. By contrast, the Nicaraguan authorities only commenced criminal proceedings in response to charges brought on 10 June 2015. These charges are made against a single individual and thus, unlike the US proceedings, do not permit an overall evaluation of the facts at hand.”\nView Gallery Sports scandals throughout history CHECK OUT OUR NEW APP: GET THE DAILY NEWS ON ANDROID OR iOS\nThe FIFA corruption case is built on an investigation by FBI and IRS agents that was underway for at least three and a half years before the 47-count indictment was issued. A major element of the case is the Traffic Group, a multinational sports marketing company based in Brazil that had an American division, Traffic USA, based in Miami.\nThe indictment alleges that Rocha steered a 2011 contract to Traffic USA that gave the company rights to World Cup qualifier matches ahead of the 2018 World Cup tournament. Traffic USA’s former president, Aaron Davidson, is one of the defendants who pleaded not guilty to charges in May and is cooperating with the feds. Another former Traffic USA executive, Enrique Sanz, is an unindicted co-conspirator in the case.\nThe Traffic Group’s founder, Jose Hawilla, secretly began cooperating with investigators in 2014 and pleaded guilty to four felony counts last December, agreeing to forfeit $151 million and testify at any proceedings if the feds ask him to. His attorney declined to comment on the matter Thursday.\nRelated Stories Olympics chief: FIFA can't be fixed with just new president al-Hussein submits candidacy for FIFA presidential election Judge unseals records of key witness in FIFA case FIFA hits Thai football president with 90-day ban Tags: julio rocha , fifa", "external_links": ["http://nydn.us/app"], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:45:47.344+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
