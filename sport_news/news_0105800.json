Robinson beat the Lynx on both sides of the ball, scoring on a 57-yard touchdown run and a 48-yard interception return for the Lions. \n“I’d say the pick-six was better,” said Robinson. “My teammate tipped the ball up to me, so there was more teamwork there. That was pretty fun.” \nJack Butteris got the Lions on the board early, with a 3-yard touchdown run. Butteris finished the half with 111 of the Lions’ 217 rushing yards in the first half. \nOn fourth-and-19, the Lynx blocked a Lisbon punt, but the Lions’ Austin Krob scooped up the ball and ran 26 yards for a first down. The Lions drove down to the North-Linn 4, but the Lynx picked off Robinson to end the first half. \n“That was a freak play,” Allison said. “Krob was slow getting the ball off. As it was, he had the smarts to pick the ball up and run with it.” \nThe Lions kept rolling in the second half, with a 5-yard touchdown run from Krob and a 40-yard punt return from Blake Langhurst. \n“The ball didn’t bounce our way,” North-Linn head coach Jared Collum said.
