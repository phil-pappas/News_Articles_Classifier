MHS Bulldogs wrestler senior Jordan Jones made it offical earlier this week, signing his national letter of intent to wrestle for the Grand View, Iowa Vikings. Grand View Head Wrestling Coach Nick Mitchell welcomed Jones to the program. “We are excited to work with such a great young man,” he said. “We are looking forward to getting to know him and his family better.” MHS Wrestling Coach Gayle Adams, who was on hand for the signing that took place on the Grand View campus, was happy and excited for Jones. “It's nice to see Jordan continuing his education and getting to wrestle at the collegiate level. Jordan is great young man and a leader, a lot of youth wrestlers look up to him. He has a big year ahead of him. It's his senior year and he needs to leave a mark on Mexico Wrestling. It's going to be a fun year watching Jordan and the Bulldogs on the mat.” Jones, who intends to major in elementary education with a minor in coaching, explained why he chose Grand View. “They have great academics, an awesome campus and a powerhouse of wrestling team with amazing coaches,” he said. “I'm really looking forward to attending Grand View next year. It's not too far from home but not too close at the same time.” By Jonathan Griffin   By Jonathan Griffin", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-04T19:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T07:46:37.577+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
