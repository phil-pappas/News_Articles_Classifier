I got a few tweets and emails from Michigan State fans wondering whether I was a bit too harsh in my assessment of the Spartans' defense Monday. MSU is 4-0 and ranked No. 2 in the country , having defeated four teams that went to bowls last season -- not a true cupcake in the mix, and that's not so common in Power 5 nonleague schedules.\nBut the Spartans aren't playing especially well, either. And the injuries are mounting. So which is it? Serious concerns with this team, or wacked-out expectations? I'll let y'all argue.\nPoint:\n* Anyone who watched the CMU game Saturday would be hard-pressed to say MSU belongs as the #2 team in the country. State has not played one \"very good\" game this year. I keep waiting to see sustained excellence, but it does not happen. One gets sort of an \"empty\" feeling at the end of each game.\nOur old attitude just isn't there. The coaches must be pulling their hair out, trying to get the players to play smarter and harder. Injuries add to the list of why this looks like a 9-3 team, not a playoff contender.\nWhy not plug in the best two freshman corners and give them a shot? Finally, it's hard for a running back to get into a good rhythm when he shares carries with two other guys and gets less than 20 carries a game. Pick \"the guy\" and stick with him!\nKitt in Palm Coast, Fla\nCounterpoint:\n*It appears a lot of articles have a slant toward predicting trouble for the Spartans if they don't fix the secondary. Sounds like chicken little to me. Some of these doom and gloom stories cite CMU's third down success rate as an example and that is blatantly misleading. The reason being is these stories reference CMU's conversion during the first half only, and it begs the question of why is the second half is being ignored, or why Riley Bullough's impact during the second half is not mentioned in these stories?\nAs you know, MSU stopped CMU on seven of nine third/fourth down attempts after the half and kept CMU's third-down conversions below 50% for the game. MSU's defenses the previous five seasons all gave up passing yardage against good teams, yet the turnover margins always favored MSU in a big way and offset the passing yardage. Isn't MSU's 2015 turnover margin similar to previous years? MSU is tied for 8th best at +1.5 per game this year with five interceptions and two fumbles recovered. The run defense is again stout, just one game skews their per-game average and overall rankings and by game 12 the D's numbers will probably be comparable to 2014 but not lower due to playing a tougher non-conference schedule this season.\nAs for the claims of Oregon's stomping by Utah detracts from MSU's victory against the Ducks is also a joke. It's apple and oranges. Last Saturday, Oregon was not the same team MSU played. Adams was unable to throw the ball and was pulled after two series last Saturday because of his broken finger. The Ducks' QB replacement, Jeff Lockie, threw two picks and couldn't move the ball. Oregon's defense being weak against the run can't be discounted, but if Oregons' D is on the field all night long they are going to get tired and gashed without an offense to help them rest.\nLastly, why is the Spartan secondary's slow development news? Didn't most fans figure this defense would take time to jell? It's not like MSU was outstanding against the pass last season, giving up a lot of 20-plus-yard pass plays. The stats and FBS defensive rankings do not reflect that the Spartans are not playing Youngstown State or Wyoming to pad the stats.\nSo, where's the voice of reason? The sky is not falling. There is time, two weeks, to heal and improve the defensive secondary and overall offensive performance.\nChris in Ireland\nTo be honest, I agree more with Chris' take than Kitt's take, even though Chris essentially is taking my column apart, point by point. But I can't say I totally agree with Chris. Regardless of whether it happened last year, it is news now, and the loss of Vayante Copeland might be too much to overcome. Maybe not. Maybe MSU can find the right mix and improve moving forward -- I think the performance of Darian Hicks against CMU was an encouraging sign. The performance of Montae Nicholson this season is a mystery and, obviously, a growing concern for the coaches.\nGood point about MSU's defense improving with Bullough in the middle (though Shane Jones was good in the first half, as well), and yeah, the third-down defense got it done in the second half. Stats have limited value but not zero value. The Spartans are not covering nor tackling as hoped, at this point.\nAs for Kitt, can't agree with the \"just plug in two freshman corners\" thing. You play your best players. Mark Dantonio always has. The unseen are undefeated, as always, but how realistic is it that freshmen are going to be better than veterans who have developed over time? That said, I won't be shocked if a freshman corner gets a look Saturday, not after safeties Grayson Miller and Khari Willis were activated the past two weeks.\nMichigan State football coach Mark Dantonio speaks with the media about freshman Khari Willis on Tuesday, Sept. 29, 2015. Video by Joe Rexrode / DFP\nOK, more big-picture takes:\n* I'm writing because I have grown quite annoyed with some of our fans. I've noticed on several social media sites fans saying things like \"next man up!\" And that \"fan\" was referring to Vayante Copeland's injury! When a young man suffers an injury like that and some lame, armchair QB utters something like that, it really sizzles my bacon. I think we all need to appreciate what these young men do on Saturday afternoons. They are putting their health on the line each and every time they suit up. And I must say these injuries have been such a bummer. Not because it could cost us a game, but because some of these guys will limp for the rest of their lives due to certain injuries. Not to mention all the talk of concussions etc. And I also can't believe how many of us have become so spoiled! I remember just wanting to get to bowl games every year. Now if we don't cover the spread people are jumping off of cliffs. It's pretty sad. Whether we go 6-6 or 15-0 I can wear my green and white proudly because you can bet the farm Coach D's team will not quit or stop playing hard! And on another note, I believe all this talk about U-M being favorites in every game according to some computer NASA has, is exactly what Coach D. wants! Because the best Spartans are that of the disrespected variety! Thanks Joe! GO GREEN!\nJeff O. in Reese\n* I can't argue with the points you made in Monday's column. But damn, you've got me wondering if we can even make a New Year's Day bowl after reading it!\nI also can't begin to fathom the level of hysteria among the Spartan fan base if MSU ever slips back to a 9-3 type season. Depending on the injury situation, and if there is any truth to the transitive property as it relates to football, (something I don't believe) we may well find out soon!\nI still hold out hope for improvement, and I believe history shows that to be the case more often than not.\nDon in DeWitt\n* It seems that MSU is really trying to manage expectations, the praise of high rankings, taking opponents' best shot as a big target. All new territory. Throw in some injuries and the coaches and players have a lot going on. Can coach Izzo provide advice to coach Dantonio, as he had his program in this type situation, new territory, some 15 to 18 years ago? What do you think coach Izzo would tell him?\nMichelle\nYou know what I'm sensing here? An overall sense of optimism in the MSU fan base -- there always will be exceptions -- based on the history under Dantonio. If you think back, the 2010, 2011 and 2013 (especially 2013) teams all had big questions entering Big Ten play and were much better by the end. So even as a fan base comes to expect much more and gets \"spoiled,\" to an extent, this one also seems less worried about that other shoe dropping. And to think that the end of the John L. Smith era was less than a decade ago.\nTo answer in specifics, no one should ever, ever put any stock in the ESPN \"FPI\" measurements, which are based, in part, on recruiting rankings. I also find no value in the transitive property of football -- the point in bringing up the Oregon loss to Utah is that it will hurt MSU's strength of schedule and chances of sneaking in to the playoff with an 11-1 record and close loss at Ohio State. Nothing more. Every game, every matchup is different. And Michelle, I do think Izzo has talked with Dantonio about these things. I don't know what the specific advice would be, but both know it's about long-term sustainability and that you won't have a real shot to win the whole thing every year.\nThis year, Dantonio does. And the questions and the tone change accordingly with that. This team is playing like a 9-3 or 10-2 team. That's good. If it wants to finish better than that, it has to be better.\nOn to other topics:\n* Coach Dantonio's \"we don't talk about injuries\" is getting a lot of attention this week but hopefully you can clear up something for me about its effectiveness (or lack of). I assume he's playing coy so that the opponent doesn't use that info in prepping for the game\nBut if a guy comes out for warmups and isn't taking part (like Copeland against Air Force) doesn't that negate that strategy? I assume college football play callers can adjust their plan if given an hour's notice.\nAs someone who is in stadiums well before most fans, can you share insight on whether this is how things work pre-game? I love what Mark Dantonio and what he's done for the program but I find his (and other coaches') stealthiness regarding injuries to be kind of silly\nBill in Caledonia\nI'm with you, Bill! I think we should get full-blown NFL injury reports and just move on. But it's never going to happen under Dantonio. And it's not all game plan-related. One thing to keep in mind on injuries is that there are some players out there who will go after a guy's left knee if they know he has had problems with his left knee. That's an ugly football reality. But that's not our problem -- we report as much as we can find out on any injury.\nWhen it comes to game plans, though, the game plans are all done and in by Thursday. Would one injury change a game plan anyway? No, but especially for big games, any information you can withhold from your opponent is worth withholding. That's how football coaches think. As for Dantonio, I just think he likes to tell us as little as possible about what's going on, in general. He gets annoyed with injury questions. And then randomly, he'll give up some info. So we keep trying! The dance continues …\n*Joe, is there any chance Montae Nicholson could move to wide receiver? I know he could be great at safety but he could be a superstar at recediver. It might be a better natural fit. The recruiting services basically said the same thing coming out of high school. They thought he could be a good safety in college but his true superstar potential was at receiver. I am beginning to believe they were correct. A Nicholson, Burbridge, Kings receiving corps could be lethal and he would give us the deep threat to take the top off of the defense. Please make this suggestion to Coach D.\nTodd R.\nMSU has tinkered with it, Todd, but I question whether a switch at this point in the season is going to result in Nicholson actually being a difference maker at receiver. Just like any position, there are nuances and there's a lot of work involved to be effective. Reading defenses, communicating with the quarterback, getting off press coverage, running sharp routes, etc. Does he have the speed and athleticism to pop a big play every now and then? Sure. Can he move over and be a consistent force right now? I doubt it. Moreover, MSU needs him to be a player in that secondary this season.\nI realize MSU can be fine with Demetrious Cox and RJ Williamson at safety moving forward. But Nicholson has that gear, that power, to be a top safety. I still think that's where his ceiling is highest. And if he can figure things out, Cox can stay at corner -- where he has been solid -- and then MSU just has to figure out the corner on the other side. I think that remains MSU's best chance for putting together a defensive backfield for a team that can win it all.\nAnd let's finish with Connor Cook:\n*I was surprised to hear that Connor Cook confronted Macgarrett Kings Jr. about effort on the opening play of the game. He laid out for that catch and Connor has not looked good, with many overthrows this season. Do you think the captain thing is still bothering him?\nAlso, I heard after that Khari Willis played Saturday, but didn't notice at the time. Was he on special teams?\nMark in Jackson\n*Do you think Connor Cook's draft stock might be inflated a bit simply based on the lack of quarterbacks running pro-style offenses in college at the moment? He has certainly cemented his status as one of the best quarterbacks in MSU history, but it has still come with a decent amount of inconsistency even through this point in his senior year.\nMax\nMark, the Big Ten Network reported Cook got on Kings after that play, and Kings said after the game there was a slight route miscommunication. Either way, is a leader supposed to get after people? Or is that a bad thing? I thought it was a good thing for a quarterback to say something to a teammate when he's upset.\nCook's play has yet to be consistently all-pro this season, that's true. But it certainly hasn't been bad. He hasn't put up big numbers in every game, but that's also not all on him. Max, I think Cook's NFL draft status has to do with his size, his arm and his overall performance. It's just like MSU -- there are warts, and if MSU is the only team you really watch closely, those warts are magnified. But everyone has them. Cook has all the tools to be a first-round pick and a starting quarterback in the NFL.\nAnd finally, on the captain thing. Wrote about it a ton at the time -- after predicting it could happen . Wrote about it again today in a story on Cook being on the verge of passing Kirk Cousins as the school's all-time winningest quarterback. I don't believe it's a big deal. Others do. It will be a topic when Cook goes through the draft process. It is not a topic for this team nor season.\nTwo draft analysts threw out some stuff about Cook on Twitter over the weekend, SI picked it up, and it became a headline. I called and texted Daniel Jeremiah to see what he meant by \"not hearing good things\" about Cook. He decided not to respond. And that's the weakest thing I've seen yet this season.\nContact Joe Rexrode: jrexrode@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @joerexrode .
