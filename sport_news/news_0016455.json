The top four partisans in the locker room — former Wolverines Luke Glendening and Dylan Larkin and former Spartans Justin Abdelkader and Drew Miller — have their wager set, and maybe their alarm clocks. \nThe players on the losing side are to wear the other team’s colors to work Monday, and also treat the winning duo to dinner. \nThe game’s 3:30 p.m. start time prompted Miller to joke he may skip warm-ups before Saturday night's game at Montreal, which starts at 7 p.m. Others said game-day naps might end early. \nTheir antics amuse their boss. \n“I love anything that allows our guys to chirp at each other and have fun,” Wings coach Jeff Blashill said Friday. \nOn a personal and professional level, the event interests Blashill because anything involving successful coaches does. While talking about his desire to become acquainted with U-M’s Harbaugh and MSU’s Dantonio, Blashill related a memory from his days coaching the Indiana Ice in 2008-10, when Lions coach Jim Caldwell was in Indianapolis. \n“I had a chance to watch the Colts when Jim Caldwell was there, got a chance to watch on the field their last day of training camp,” Blashill said. “It was one of the best learning experiences I have had as a coach. So I will certainly reach out at some point.” \nBlashill is more familiar with Dantonio because both have worked in state for several years, and because “my dad and my sister both graduated from there, my nephew goes there now,” Blashill said. “I have watched him build that program and just have a ton of respect for the building process. It appears to me — I don’t know if there is a right way, but he has done it the right way. I have also had a little bit of insight through the hockey coaches, some of his thought processes and things like that.” \nBlashill noted Harbaugh, “has won everywhere he has gone. Didn’t necessarily take the easy path. Didn’t jump right to the (NFL). He learned the profession of coaching, and when you win that much, it seems he must be doing a real good job.” \nContact Helene St. James: hstjames@freepress.com.
