With LSU still unbeaten and always-powerful Alabama gaining steam with a lone loss (to Mississippi) – the Aggies and Rebels knew the stakes of Saturday night before a sellout crowd of 60,674. \nA&M was coming off a demoralizing 41-23 home loss to Alabama, and it showed, while the Rebels quickly shook off any possible drag from a 37-24 loss last weekend at Memphis. Aggies sophomore quarterback Kyle Allen had an especially rough night, in completing about a third of his passes (11 of 31) through the decisive first three quarters. \nA&M trailed 16-3 at halftime, and seemed fortunate to do so considering their multiple escapes over the first two quarters. The Rebels led 13-0 late in the second quarter when quarterback Chad Kelly whipped a pass across the middle for what appeared to be a 43-yard touchdown pass and a 19-0 lead, but Mississippi was whistled for a chop block and the apparent score was wiped out. \nAggies defensive end Myles Garrett then batted a Kelly pass, and caught the ball on its way down for an interception. A&M finally cracked the scoreboard with 2:27 remaining to halftime, on a 44-yard field goal by Taylor Bertolet as a result of Garrett's heads-up play. \nIn victories over Arkansas and Mississippi State to start SEC play, A&M committed zero turnovers. But last weekend in the home loss to Alabama, A&M quarterbacks threw four interceptions, including three by Allen that were returned for touchdowns. \nTheir turnover miseries continued at Mississippi, with an Allen interception and two lost fumbles in the key first half. In addition, the Aggies had committed a combined six penalties in their previous two games, but had nine for 87 yards at halftime. \n\"It was a poor half of football,\" A&M coach Kevin Sumlin told ESPN at halftime. \"The good news is we're in the game. We can play a lot better, and we're going to have to.\" \nThe Aggies didn't, in punting on their first two possessions of the second half, and then watching helplessly as Kelly shove the game out of reach early in the third quarter on a 58-yard bullet of a touchdown pass to Laquon Treadwell across the middle. \nA&M continued to waste its most favorable schedule since entering the SEC prior to the 2012 season. The Aggies, the only SEC team from Texas, hadn't even crossed state lines for a game until this weekend. \nThey now return home for three consecutive games at Kyle Field, starting 11 a.m. this Saturday against SEC East foe South Carolina. \nbrent.zwerneman@chron.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T04:18:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T12:21:47.754+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
