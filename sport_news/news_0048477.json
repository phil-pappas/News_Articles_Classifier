It took referee Joel Aguilar two minutes to sort out the melee before he gave Peralta a yellow card and Guzan a brief scolding. \nThat only reflected the high stakes both teams were playing for. \nWith the slumping U.S. coming off its worst Gold Cup finish in 15 years and Coach Juergen Klinsmann fielding questions about his job security, the Americans approached Saturday as a must-win game. And the veteran roster Klinsmann chose for the game underscored that. \nBut it didn’t work. \n“A loss is always difficult to swallow, especially when there’s a lot at stake. It means that you have to work harder. There’s not much time in between,” said Klinsmann, whose team, which begins World Cup qualifying next month has won just one of its last five games. \n“Obviously, there will be a lot of conversations coming in the next couple of days.” \nMexico, meanwhile, played as if it had nothing to lose, going with an unusual lineup that featured just two natural midfielders and three play-making forwards. So while the U.S. played conservatively -- and poorly -- for long stretches, the Mexicans were fast, flashy and creative. \nAnd that paid off on all three Mexico goals. \n“What I like very much is what the team did. Their personality, what they tried to do on the field,” Ferretti said. “So I’m very happy for everything. The boys did a great job. It’s a result we earned.” \nOn the first goal, Peralta spun away from a pair of defenders and sprinted into the penalty area to take Raul Jimenez’s slick back-heel pass. Peralta then pushed the ball across the front of the six-yard box to Hernandez, who one-timed it past Guzan for his 42nd international goal -- and his first in five games against the U.S. \nPeralta got the second midway through the first overtime period, latching on to a loose ball redirected into the penalty area by Aguilar, then driving a low right-footed shot by Guzan. \nWood came off the U.S. bench two minutes later and wound up evening the scoring, running on to a low lead pass from DeAndre Yedlin -- another late sub -- and one-timing it into the net. \nBut Aguilar finally ended the back-and-forth two minutes before the teams would have gone to penalty kicks, taking a pass from Jimenez and driving a right-footed blast into the net from about 15 yards out. Aguilar celebrated by throwing himself into an advertising board along the sideline. \nKlinsmann, who had never lost to Mexico as a player or coach, said he began planning for penalty kicks several minutes earlier by telling backup goalie Nick Rimando, a stout keeper against penalty shots, to get ready to replace Guzan. But when defender Fabian Johnson came up lame with nine minutes to play, the U.S. had to use its final substitution to replace him instead. \nWhen it was over the 61-year-old Ferretti, who will be replaced as national team coach by Colombian Juan Carlos Osorio next week, was asked whether he’d reconsider and come back, perhaps after the World Cup. \n“No, I’m too old for that,” he said with a smile. “I can’t think about that. Osorio is coming and he’s going to have all of our support.” \nFollow Kevin Baxter on Twitter @kbaxter11", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T09:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T12:18:31.033+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
