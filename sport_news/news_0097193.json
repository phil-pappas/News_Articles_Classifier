Brent Kennedy Contact Reporter Vikings boys soccer shuts out Long Reach in regular season finale to secure sole possession of county title \nHaving watched some talented Vikings’ teams over the last nine years fall short, a usually even-keeled Mt. Hebron coach Mike Linsenmeyer wore a big smile on his face following his team’s 3-0 victory over Long Reach Thursday night that secured sole possession of this year’s county championship. \nOver the past month since losing an overtime game against River Hill, Mt. Hebron (10-1, 12-2) rolled off nine straight wins to capture the program’s first county title since 2006. \n“I’m really proud of them because after the debacle that was the River Hill game, the kids responded great … they really did. And it was an immediate response — we are really playing excellent soccer now,” Linsenmeyer said. “Howard County was very tough this year, there was a lot of parody, so we definitely had to earn this and get a lucky along the way too.” \nAfter the regular season finale against the Lightning — the eighth shutout during Mt. Hebron’s winning streak — the magnitude of the accomplishment wasn’t lost on the players either. \n“It feels amazing man,” said Mt. Hebron senior Atticus Cooke. “After three years on varsity, I can’t even explain how good I feel right now. Our team, we put so much work in, and I feel like we really deserved it this year.” \nMt.

Hebron came into the evening assured of at least a share of the county title, but the Vikings had no intention of sharing this year’s crown. To win outright, though, the team had to knock off a Long Reach squad playing on senior night. \nThe Lightning — led by senior captains David Ceasar, Joshua Fawole and Quentin Valiente— came out energized at the onset of the contest. \nAfter the first 20 minutes, however, Mt. Hebron began winning more of the possession in the middle of the field. And, ultimately, once the Vikings found their stride there was no slowing down the team’s offensive attack.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T08:06:46.611+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
