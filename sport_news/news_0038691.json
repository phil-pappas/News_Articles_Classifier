Center in their second exhibition game. \"I feel like I need the ball to create. Without the ball I'm a different type of player. We'll see how it's going to go.\"\nDragic was particularly limited in his touches in Sunday's 90-77 loss to the Charlotte Hornets at AmericanAirlines Arena. Part of that was a Heat approach that is stressing rapid ball movement; part of it was Dragic getting himself back up to speed.\n\"We're talking that we want to advance the ball so everybody touches the ball so we develop the chemistry,\" he said.\nHis hope is chemistry to be developed through the pick-and-roll game, his specialty. He was surprised the Heat did not get into those actions as often as he anticipated.\nAs for backcourt partner Dwyane Wade advancing the ball and the offense running through others, coach Erik Spoelstra warned not to read too much into the initial stages of the preseason.\n\"Certainly with that starting unit, Goran will have the ball in his hands quite a bit,\" he said.\nPart of that will Dragic getting himself kick-started.\n\"I didn't even feel right the first game. I was kind of slow, couldn't penetrate,\" he said. \"But it's going to come. I'm not worried about that.\"\nFor Dragic, training camp previously had been an extended part of his offseason. That changed this summer, and his body is feeling it.\n\"The difference in the past seven, eight years, I've always played for my national team,\" he said. \"So as soon as I came to training camp, I was already in game shape and I was already in that zone, five-on-five.\n\"But now it's the first time after eight years that I had a complete summer off, I didn't play in any games, nothing, so it takes some time to get back on that track.\"\nFor Dragic, this will become his new normal. Slovenia failed to advance to the 2016 Rio Olympics in last month's EuroBasket competition or even to next summer's last-chance Olympic qualifying tournament.\nNow he is like the rest of his teammates, a preseason work in progress, searching for his legs.\n\"It takes time, of course,\" he said in his typical upbeat manner. \"I understand that.\"\n(c)2015 Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.)\nVisit the Sun Sentinel (Fort Lauderdale, Fla.) at www.sun-sentinel.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1734183&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1734183&h=Dragic+looking+to+get+back+up+to+speed%2C+in+sync+with+Heat", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/basketball/s-1734183"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:16:49.178+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
