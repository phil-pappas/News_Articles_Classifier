Employees at the gaming sites have access to data that could give them an unfair advantage. \nUntil the recent revelations, both sites, which dominate the fast-growing business of daily fantasy sports, had allowed employees to play on rival sites. \nDraftKings and FanDuel have since permanently banned their employees from playing for money. They also vowed to not accept entries from employees of other sites. \nThe kerfuffle may have some fantasy sports fans worried about whether the games are rigged. But so far FanDuel's and Draftking's popularity has only grown in the wake of the scandal. \nFederal prosecutors are said to be investigating the business practices of fantasy sports services. The probe is being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston, which is the home of DraftKings. FanDuel is based in New York. \nRegulators in Nevada recently banned fantasy sports from the state all together, saying it constituted illegal sports betting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T22:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T23:51:33.231+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
