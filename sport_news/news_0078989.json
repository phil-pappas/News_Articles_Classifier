This sweep was the sixth sweep of the season for Virginia Tech. \nWins of this caliber have been important for the Hokies, who use them to gain momentum going forward. \n“It’s important for us to gain confidence and work on things,” junior outside hitter Lindsey Owens said. \nEarly on in the first set, the Hokies were playing sloppy volleyball, going down 5-9 early. After a timeout, Tech refocused and bounced back with a 5-0 scoring run, giving them a 10-9 lead. \n“We need to come out with a sense of urgency from the first point, that we have something to prove,” Virginia Tech head volleyball coach Chris Riley said. \nLate in the set with the Hokies leading 19-17, a kill by Owens hit Clemson middle-blocker Sofia Hruby in the head. Hruby exited the set and did not return for the rest of the match. \nThe injury proved to be a big blow for the Tigers, who gave up a 10-2 run near the end of the set. Despite a slow start and owning just a 0.115 attack percentage, the Hokies took the first set by a score of 25-19. \nClemson made seven attack errors and recorded only seven kills in the set. The seven attack errors, however, were fewer than those committed by Virginia Tech, which had nine. The difference was that Clemson only tallied seven kills, compared to the 15 kills that Tech recorded. \nKeelie Arneson recorded 12 digs in the set for the Tigers. For the Hokies, Owens tallied six kills, and Rhegan Mitchell recorded nine assists and eight digs. \nThe second set started out much like the first with Tech trailing 6-2 and calling a timeout to regroup. \nA 4-0 Tech run knotted the set at 9-9. Later in the set, Tech went on a 6-0 run to take an 18-15 lead. The Hokies won the second set 25-19, just like the first, and took a 2-0 lead in the match. \nClemson committed 10 errors and recorded only eight kills in the second set, leading to a -0.054 attack percentage. Mitchell added nine more assists and two more digs for Virginia Tech. \nThe third set featured a downright beat-down by Virginia Tech. Fueled by a 7-2 run in the middle of the set, the Hokies were able to finish off the Tigers 25-17, winning the match 3-0. \nMitchell added 14 more assists and five more digs, finishing with 32 assists and 15 digs and recording a double-double. \n“I think she’s doing an amazing job,” Owens said about Mitchell’s dominance. “I can’t praise her enough for how well she’s been doing.” \nKennedy Bryan finished with 10 kills and seven digs, Kenedy McGrath chipped in with 15 digs of her own and Owens tallied three more kills, finishing with an attack percentage of 0.355. \nWith the win, the Hokies improved to 13-6, 4-3 in the ACC, and the loss dropped Clemson to 5-14, 0-7 in the ACC. \n“It was important for us because it’s a team that is below us and we have to make sure that we win those matches,” Riley said. \nNext up for the Hokies will be Georgia Tech on Sunday, Oct. 18 at Cassell Coliseum at 3:30 p.m.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T19:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T15:43:31.247+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
