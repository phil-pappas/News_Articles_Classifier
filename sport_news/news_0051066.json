Dar, a member of the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires, had officiated in the first three matches and was also scheduled to umpire in the fourth and fifth ODIs in Chennai and Mumbai on October 22 and 25, respectively. The ICC made the decision following today’s incident in Mumbai where a group of Shiv Sena activists stormed the BCCI offices, and threatened to prevent the umpire from standing in the fifth ODI on Sunday. “Under the present circumstances, it will be unreasonable to expect from Aleem that he will be able to perform his duties to the best of his abilities. As such, he has been withdrawn and his replacement will be announced in due course,” an ICC spokesman said. Former Pakistan fast bowlers Wasim Akram and Shoaib Akhtar have pulled out from the commentary team of the official broadcaster for the fifth ODI scheduled to be played at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai on October 25. Meanwhile, PCB’s Head of Executive Committee Najam Sethi will fly back to Pakistan. However, PCB Chairman Shahryar Khan has decided to come to Delhi on a “personal capacity”. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T10:14:03.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
