By KRISTIN SHARP - ksharp@shawmedia.com \nOSWEGO â€“ Now, the waiting game begins for the Plainfield South football players and coaches. Related Links Lockport football spoils Joliet West's playoff hopes \nThe Cougars capped the regular season with a 28-7 loss at Oswego on Friday night and now hope a 5-4 record with 43 playoff points is enough to give Plainfield South one of 32 spots when the Class 8A playoff field is announced Saturday night. \n\"I think we've got a better than average chance to get in, but we're going to find out,\" Plainfield South head coach Ken Bublitz said. \"I just hope for these kids' sake because they played their tails off. Now we'll just have to see.\" \nPlainfield South accepted the opening kickoff, but fumbled on its first play from scrimmage to set the tone for the night. \nOswego had two unanswered touchdowns to go up 14-0 early in the second quarter. \nThe Cougars put together a 13-play drive and came up big on a fourth-and-12 situation when quarterback Jackson Howarth found Austin Deal for a 21-yard gain to the Oswego 12. Two plays later, Howarth threw a 14-yard touchdown pass to Jake Portz and Enrique Carbajal's extra point was good for a 14-7 score. \nOswego responded, however, and went up to a 21-7 lead with 1:45 to play in the third quarter. Midway through the fourth the Panthers added one final score. \nWith the help of a Minooka win over Plainfield North, Oswego wins its fifth consecutive Southwest Prairie Conference championship with a 6-1 record, while Plainfield South and Plainfield North tie for second at 5-2.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T08:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T16:29:55.731+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
