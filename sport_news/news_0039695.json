Stephen Schramm: Tar Heels hope tight team chemistry translates to success on court By Stephen Schramm - Staff writer \nCHAPEL HILL - If, in a few months, North Carolina ends up becoming the national championship contender many think it can be, some share of the credit might need to go to the wildly popular FIFA video game series. \nAccording to several Tar Heels, the simulated soccer battles that play out on the big screen in the Smith Center's team lounge get serious. There's plenty of trash talking between opponents as well as the teammates that crowd around to watch on the room's leather couches. There's even a tiered ranking system to make sure no one forgets who's atop the FIFA food chain. \n\"We have a lot of people on our team who are competitive so we do competitive things,\" sophomore guard Joel Berry said. \nBerry said he can hold his own against just about anyone. About the only teammate he said he can't consistently beat is his senior backcourt mate Marcus Paige. \n\"Some days it's your day, sometimes it's not,\" Berry said. \nBut it's not the Tar Heels' video game prowess that has them facing lofty expectations. It's, in part, a product of the culture those games have helped produce. \nThe reason the Tar Heels are viewed as one of the favorites in the ACC and beyond is because of their experience and depth. Nine of the 10 top players return to a team that reached the Sweet 16. \nHowever, if you ask the players themselves, the optimism isn't merely due to the number of pieces that came back, it's because of the bond those pieces share. \n\"I'd say this is the tightest team I've been a part of chemistry-wise,\" senior forward Brice Johnson said. \nSeveral Tar Heels said that, away from the court, the team is inseparable. The players grab meals together at all hours. If they're not practicing, working out or goofing off at the Smith Center, they're usually hanging out with their teammates at someone's apartment. \nPaige praised freshmen Luke Maye and Kenny Williams for their ability to mesh seamlessly into a group already laced with established friendships. \n\"There's not anyone who's standoffish or doing their own thing,\" Tar Heels junior Nate Britt said. \"Our team wants to be around each other all the time. . I haven't been on any other team with that type of chemistry.\" \nNew level \nThe unspoken part of all of this is that it hasn't always been this way. \nFor various reasons, the past three North Carolina teams - two of which didn't make to the NCAA tournament's second week - never seemed to equal the sum of their talented parts. \nThe 2012-13 team had an unwieldy mix of leftovers from the previous season's powerful squad with newcomers thrust into important roles. The next season was played in the shadow of the NCAA troubles that eventually ended the college career of star guard P.J. Hairston. \nSeveral players said that while the overall chemistry of last season's team was fine, it didn't have the same level of togetherness shown by this year's squad. One Tar Heel said that there were a few players who were \"just distant.\" \nSophomore Justin Jackson said he remembers difficult moments early last season when frustrations flared between teammates and players deviated from the game plan. But progress was made and it showed later in the season. \n\"At the end of the year, I think we really started to stick together and we pulled out a few games that, earlier in the season, we couldn't,\" he said. \nIt's those performances that have North Carolina believing it can live out its championship aspirations. And it's that belief that has the Tar Heels united in a way that can't be cracked by even the most heated FIFA throw down. \n\"We have a chance to have a great year this year, I think everyone wants it,\" Berry said. \"I think that's what makes us so close. We all know what we want. We're all going for one thing.\" \nStaff writer Stephen Schramm can be reached at schramms@fayobserver.com or at 910-486-3536.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T00:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:05:35.361+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
