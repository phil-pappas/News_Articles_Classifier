Three (three!) Elvis Andrus misplays opened the floodgates for the Blue Jays. \nJose Bautista , the heart and soul of this Blue Jays team, gave his club the lead with a monstrous three-run home run. The Rogers Centre crowd went bonkers. \nThat is the biggest home run in Toronto since Joe Carter's walk-off job in the 1993 World Series. No hyperbole there. \nAlso, make sure you check out Bautista's savage bat flip: — Getty Images Sport (@GettySport) October 14, 2015 Jose Bautista is the absolute best. pic.twitter.com/r5wulmsXBq — Ian Hunter (@BlueJayHunter) October 14, 2015 \nGosh.
