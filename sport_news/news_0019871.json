He had progressed nicely.” \nAcuil transferred to Baylor from Neosho County (Kan.) Community College where he averaged 20.1 points, 11.2 rebounds and 4.7 blocks as a sophomore. He’s a native of Sudan who moved to Australia as a child. \n“Jo is a great teammate and you can’t replace a 7-footer who blocks a lot of shots and alters a lot of shots,” Drew said. “His shot blocking and offensive skill set will be missed.” \nAcuil is the second recruit in Baylor’s 2015 class who has dealt with a heart issue. Freshman guard King McClure was told by a doctor in June that he couldn’t play college basketball due to a condition called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy that affects the heart muscle. \nBut after getting a second opinion, McClure was cleared to play after a doctor determined that the chance of a life threatening episode on the court was extremely low. \nBaylor opens the season against Stephen F. Austin on Nov. 13 at the Ferrell Center.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T00:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:05:37.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
