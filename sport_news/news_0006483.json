PEN International, the world's leading association of writers working to promote literature and defend freedom of expression around the world, in a statement yesterday called upon the Indian government to identify and arrest the killers of MM Kalburgi, Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare. Delegates from 150 countries participating in the 81st Congress of Pen International in Quebec City, Canada, also expressed solidarity with the writers and artists who have returned their prestigious awards in protest. Simultaneously, PEN International president, John Ralston Saul, has written a letter to the country's President, Prime Minister and the Sahitya Akedemi, urging the Indian government to take “immediate steps” to protect the rights of everyone, including writers and artists. “We stand in solidarity with the more than fifty novelists, scholars, poets, and public intellectuals who have returned their awards to the Akademi and admire their courage,” the letter said. A non-political organisation which holds special consultative status at the UN and associate status at UNESCO, PEN has been documenting and campaigning against human rights violations of writers since the 1960s when its Writers in Prison Committee (WiPC) was established. In 2014, PEN International’s WiPC team documented over 900 cases of attacks, killings, arrests and imprisonment of writers across the globe. “They have asked me, as president of PEN International, to share with you our strongly held view that the Indian government takes immediate steps to protect the rights of everyone, including writers and artists, in the finest traditions of Indian society and culture, and indeed, the letter and spirit of the Indian Constitution,\" he said. \"For this, the government must reassure the community of writers and artists that its ministers are tolerant of diverse views. Also, it must ensure that the investigations into the murders of MM Kalburgi, Narendra Dabholkar and Govind Pansare are conducted fairly and expediently and their killers are brought to justice,\" Saul said. Mourning the passing away of Kalburgi, Pansare and Dabholkar, killed by unknown assailants, the association called upon the Indian government to identify and arrest the perpetrators of these crimes. Kalburgi was the recipient of one of India's highest literary awards, the Sahitya Akademi Award, and yet, after his murder, the Akademi “remains silent” even as its members resign in protest, and several award recipients return their awards, the statement said. \"It takes courage in the current climate in India to express public dissent in a public manner,\" the statement said.
