Bortles' second TD pass of the game came a short time after Buffalo safety Corey Graham intercepted a pass and returned it 44 yards to put the Bills ahead. The Jaguars (2-5) won their first game in London after losing in each of the past two seasons at Wembley, the home of England's national soccer team. The Bills (3-4) were playing in the British capital for the first time. EJ Manuel started at quarterback for the Bills for the second straight game in the absence of the injured Tyrod Taylor. Manuel's early struggles allowed Jacksonville to take a big lead, but Manuel led the rally until the Jaguars took the lead for good in the final minutes. ___ AP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Share this page", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T17:59:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:27:45.393+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
