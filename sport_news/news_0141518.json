Manning calmly changed the play on the fly, delivering a quick 3rd-and-1 throw to Jennings in the flat. What Jennings did next was something the Bills lacked all afternoon. He made defenders miss.\nFirst, Jennings slipped out of Nigel Bradham's grasp. He then left Preston Brown in his trail before flattening Bacarri Rambo, who would leave the game with an injury. The final result was a 51-yard touchdown.\n» Highlights, videos\nThe Bills had no answer. Playing without LeSean McCoy and Sammy Watkins, their top two offensive players, Buffalo struggled to make big plays. As a result, the Giants controlled the clock and didn't have much fear in Tyrod Taylor and the Bills' offense. The Bills' offense finished the first half with just 78 yards and didn't have a single play go for over 30 yards in the game.\nThe lack of McCoy and Watkins didn't help, and neither did the 17 penalties the Bills took. With a chance to go to 3-1 heading into a Week 5 game against the Tennessee Titans, the Bills faltered and will be left looking for answers on offense while they wait for McCoy and Watkins to get healthy.\n1. Eli Manning follows New England blueprint The Bills' defense was exposed against the New England Patriots, who spread the formation and racked up 40 points and over 500 yards of offense. While Eli Manning and the Giants weren't nearly as effective as Brady and the Patriots, they followed a similar gameplan, avoiding sacks and turnovers and controlling the clock. Buffalo's defensive line didn't record a sack, and the Bills finished with only one sack on the day.The Bills' defense didn't let the team down by any means. The Giants just managed to enough to get out of Buffalo with a win.\n2. Carpenter struggles continue For a while it looked like Bills kicker Dan Carpenter had left his struggles in the preseason. On Sunday, however, Carpenter hooked a 30-yard field attempt left of the uprights. That set Buffalo back when points were hard enough to come by. Rex Ryan has already expressed some dissatisfaction with how Carpenter has kicked, so one has to wonder if the pressure is on the veteran again.\n3. Robert Woods not up to par With the Bills down two touchdowns and driving to make a late comeback attempt, Taylor connected with Robert Woods on a 17-yard catch and run. As Woods was fighting to turn 17 yards into a few more, he was stripped of the football, the Bills' comeback chances slipped away with the football. Sunday was supposed to be Woods' chance to step into a bigger role, but he ended up catching just three passes for 35 yards.\n4. Penalties are still an issue Another week, another game in which the Bills showed a lack of discipline. Against the Giants, the Bills had 17 penalties for 135 yards. Jerry Hughes added two 15-yard penalties to his season total, and Buffalo gave away too many easy yards that allowed the Giants to extend drives.\n5. Ronald Darby a bright spot For all of the negative surrounding the Bills on Sunday, rookie cornerback Ronald Darby turned into another solid performance. Even when he was matched up with Odell Beckham Jr., Darby was up for the challenge. He was sticking to receivers in coverage and making tough tackles in the open field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T14:11:20.730+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
