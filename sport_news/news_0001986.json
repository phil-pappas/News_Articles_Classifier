That is why I am glad that most of the players here are finding ways to work as a team because I get the feeling now that they are aware that they are representing 170 million people,\" Oliseh said.\nThe Super Eagle goalkeeper Enyeama said on his Instagram page on Thursday that he would retire from international football to focus on his club career.\n\"I have fought a good fight for more than 13 years. I have finished my course and I have kept the faith and sang the anthem with passion. Henceforth, there is laid for me a crown that only God can reward me with for my 13 years of national service. God bless Nigeria,\" Enyeama said.\n\"Henceforth, I am no longer the captain of the Nigerian senior football team, I am no longer the goalie of the team. I am out of the team. I am no longer available for international duties,\" he concluded.\n updates, ", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AO_Sports", "https://www.facebook.com/AhramOnlineSports?fref=ts"], "published": "2015-10-09T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:43:24.061+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
