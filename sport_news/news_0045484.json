(Photo: Daniel Mears / Detroit News) \nDetroit — Jim Caldwell doesn’t waver, in his answers, in his demeanor, in his beliefs. That’s generally a good thing, but it’s about to be severely tested. \nDetroit’s season already teeters at 0-3, with a Monday night game in Seattle looming. If this is to be salvaged, it starts with one guy, and it’s not the quarterback or the offensive coordinator or the right tackle. It’s the guy in charge, the one who must decide whom, or what, to trust. \nCaldwell can’t fix the woeful offense by himself, but he dictates how it can be done, and who does it. And if it comes down to choosing between Matthew Stafford’s free-winging style and Joe Lombardi’s rigid play-calling, Caldwell will have to do something risky, something that’ll make people tremble: He’ll have to trust Stafford more. \nHe has no choice because he has no other quarterback, and if Stafford doesn’t make it work, the Lions have no chance. Stafford hasn’t meshed with Lombardi’s offense, and in their second season together, it’s time to reevaluate. It’s an offense that excelled with the Saints, run by a technically precise passer in Drew Brees. It even got the job done last season, when the Lions went 11-5 and Stafford threw a career-low 12 interceptions. \nBut the Lions won with tremendous defense and this group is nowhere near that level, especially with DeAndre Levy out. There are suggestions Caldwell should take over play-calling from Lombardi, but that’s a tack of last resort. Caldwell did it in Baltimore, elevated from quarterbacks coach to offensive coordinator, replacing Cam Cameron late in 2012. The Ravens went on to win the Super Bowl largely because Joe Flacco was emboldened and unleashed. \nThat was a gambling team with a good running game, and Caldwell must view it with a hint of wistfulness. Because this Lions offense is the opposite of gambling. Tentative? Tepid? Predictable? \nIt needs to be bolder. Stafford’s strength is his arm, not his accuracy, not his pocket awareness, not his check-down ability. Should a No. 1 pick in his seventh season be better at all those things? Of course. No debate. Stafford sits comfortably in that aggravating position — good enough to play, not good enough to win big. \nApproach too predictable \nLombardi’s job is not to make his offense work. It’s to map a plan that allows his best players to succeed, and that means getting big plays out of Calvin Johnson and Golden Tate. It means letting Stafford throw deep, instead of blindly trusting the scheme. It means putting Stafford in no-huddle, up-tempo mode more often, where he can sling with less thinking. \nThe Lions can’t pretend they have the pieces to keep doing what they’re doing. Caldwell is a calm, experienced leader who doesn’t panic, but he can’t be passive, either. \n“Here’s the thing I think you need to understand — I evaluate everybody, everything, every play of every player,” Caldwell said. “So I’m responsible for our ineffectiveness at times. It’s my job to get that going. We’ll look at that and we’ll do it by whatever measures we think are necessary.” \nIt’s not about assigning blame, although the Stafford-Lombardi disconnect must be addressed, difficult to do with so many other issues on an offense ranked 27th. The line is broken, from Larry Warford’s injuries to LaAdrian Waddle’s injuries to Riley Reiff’s halting development. The Lions need to look at their blocking schemes and figure out what they can do effectively, not what they wish they could do effectively. \nThe handoffs to Joique Bell to gain 1.1 yards are a waste. Stop hoping Bell can run like he has before and start handing the ball to rookie Ameer Abdullah. This is the biggest indictment of Lombardi, although Stafford foolishly checks into running plays too. \nThe endless short and intermediate passes only make sense if they lead to the occasional big play over the top. The buttoned-down approach hasn’t even produced the low-turnover benefit — Stafford has five interceptions. He has completed two passes to Johnson longer than 20 yards, which can make an offense look numbingly predictable. \nBoth Denver defensive backs who intercepted passes last weekend said afterward they knew exactly what was coming. \n“We pretty much knew what they were gonna do, and they did it,” Bradley Roby said, a sentiment echoed by teammate David Bruton. \nTate said similar things this week about the offense’s predictability, and it’s officially an issue. For perspective, most teams do what they do well, over and over, and defenses often know what’s coming. The problem is, the Lions don’t do anything well enough to dictate what’s coming. \nSearching for trust \nBecause of the line’s woes, Stafford has been pressured 51 times, the most of any quarterback in the league. Cohesion and communication are lacking, and with blocking tight end Brandon Pettigrew injured, there’s little help. \nSince the first half of the San Diego game — ah, the dusty nostalgia of that 21-3 lead — Stafford has looked uncomfortable, under so much pressure he sometimes feels it before it arrives. His fumble was a key play in the fourth quarter of the 24-12 loss to the Broncos, and he admitted he has to do a better job getting rid of the ball. \nThis is yet another referendum on Stafford, sure. It’s a referendum on Lombardi, of course. \nUltimately, it’s a referendum on Caldwell, stoic in a gathering storm. He faces a daunting task, dissecting that offense and figuring out whom to trust, and for how much longer. \nbob.wojnowski@detroitnews.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T06:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T06:30:42.664+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
