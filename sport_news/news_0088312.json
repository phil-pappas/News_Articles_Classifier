Photo: Ezra Shaw, Getty Images A dream 2015-16 NBA season would look something like this 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nBorrowing a classic Mad Magazine slogan, a few Scenes We’d Like to See in the NBA season: \nStephen Curry lighting up the Houston Rockets for 48 points, with all the usual flair and frivolity, when the teams meet Friday night in Houston. Just a nice little reminder for James Harden . Plus a couple of steals from Ty Lawson , to drive another point home ... Seth Curry fighting through a logjam in the Sacramento backcourt — Rajon Rondo, Darren Collison , David Stockton , Ben McLemore — to get some serious playing time ... Broken nose and that’s it for Andrew Bogut . No more injuries of any kind ... Harrison Barnes and Festus Ezeli locked into contract extensions by the Nov. 2 deadline. It probably wouldn’t affect the locker room if they head into next summer as restricted free agents (the woefully underpaid Curry never complains), but settling those issues now would keep a very mellow vibe intact ... Xavier Henry , once considered a solid NBA prospect (from Kansas) and recovering from Achilles tendon surgery, getting a look with the Warriors after a solid D-League performance in Santa Cruz. The 6-foot-6 small forward had three 20-plus scoring nights for the Lakers two seasons ago, including 27 against Portland. \nCleveland actually playing the type of motion offense preferred by head coach David Blatt . A few hints emerged in the last 35 games LeBron James , Kevin Love and Kyrie Irving played together (the Cavs went 32-3) ... Paul Pierce with the ball in the Clippers’ first down-a-point possession in the final seconds (or will that always be Chris Paul ’s shot?) ... Any night with the Minnesota Timberwolves , reason enough to purchase League Pass (TV access to all games) with Andrew Wiggins , Ricky Rubio , Zach LaVine , Karl-Anthony Towns and Kevin Garnett ... Dallas owner Mark Cuban considering a “tank” job if the Mavericks stink it up (and they just might). They’ll be able to keep a lottery pick owed to Boston if they finish among the league’s seven worst teams ... And this scene above all: Steve Kerr , with a confident stride and ready smile, healthy enough to coach the Warriors without complication. \nControlled madness \nKerr was on hand for the Warriors’ Southern California practices attended by old-school Tom Thibodeau , the deposed Bulls head coach, and Thibodeau had to be amazed by the hang-loose, fun-loving atmosphere the Warriors have created. “I told him, ‘I’ll bet you don’t see much of this in Chicago,’” Kerr said. “We’ve got music, guys kickin’ the ball around, always walking that line between loose and disciplined. I told him there were times last year when I watched our practice and thought, ‘What the hell are we doing?’ Then we won the championship. I guess it worked.” ... A view from the outside on Curry: “We love to talk about how small he is,” wrote Zach Harper on cbs.com, “completely ignoring the fact that he’s not that small — on most nights, his height is an actual advantage against opposing point guards. We love to talk about how he’s not an elite athlete, except a lot of his measurements — sprint, agility, vertical leap — are right around what John Wall puts up.” ... Harsh reality for the Giants and their plans to get back to the World Series: The Mets will be absolutely loaded if they can sign potential free agents Yoenis Céspedes and Daniel (“Babe”) Murphy , and even if the finances don’t work, they have enough pitching to offer Zach Wheeler (the ex-Giants prospect returning from Tommy John surgery) in trade. The Cubs have the game’s best young talent and will go hard for one of the top free-agent pitchers. And the Dodgers, who also figure to load up on pitching, will be especially tough if they hire the right manager. Odds on that: not great. Sources suspect Don Mattingly ’s replacement will be a puppet to front-office whims, and Gabe Kapler — someone other teams wouldn’t even consider — is said to be the front-runner. Put it this way: An experienced type who earns instant respect in the clubhouse and is only mildly interested in analytics —think Bruce Bochy or Dusty Baker — doesn’t fit the blueprint. \nVery dumb ad slogan from the FanDuel fantasy people: “Pick your contest, pick your teams, then pick up your winnings.” That last part isn’t quite right. It should read, “Kick yourself for tossing hard-earned money right out the window.” ... And here’s grantland.com’s Charles Pierce on the fantasy campaigns: “Behind the high-pressure tactics and high-end sophistication is the unmistakable glow of the cheap carny midway, the faint call of bozo over the water tank and the smell of old and decaying cotton candy.” ... Fascinating: Jim Tomsula (news conference) and Mike Ditka (Monday night pregame) both have been accused of breaking wind with the cameras rolling. With denials all around, of course. This calls for a whole new era in windbreaking. Let’s see a coach lean back in his chair and let fly with a tremendous ripper. Fffrrp! And the whole room cracks up ... Fox Sports 1 unveiled the worst postgame studio show in sports history after Game 4 of the ALCS. There must have been 18 people on the set, including Alex Rodriguez (for some weird reason), the ludicrous Pete Rose and several members of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir — and they were all standing . Who thought up this look? Everybody, in every studio: Sit the hell down! ... I love the stand-up ground rules, by the way. If you’re a man, stand with your feet well apart, as if preparing for an earthquake. If you’re a woman, make sure your shoes are glued together. \nBruce Jenkins is a San Francisco Chronicle columnist.
