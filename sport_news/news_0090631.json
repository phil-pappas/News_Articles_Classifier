Instead of playing in the Blue division against schools with a similar enrollment or lower, during the summer Kohala opted to play in the big-school Red division. \n“Our athletic director (Laurie Koustik) thought it would prepare us for the playoffs and give us a challenge,” coach Malia Kaitoku said. “I actually agreed. We have so many freshmen, I wanted the girls to see what was out there at the different schools.” \nThey were both right, which is why Kohala, with only one victory to its credit, has two chances to reach the HHSAA tournament entering the BIIF semifinals Thursday at Hilo High. \n“They stuck with it,” Kaitoku said. \nAfter taking their lumps during an 0-16 regular-season, Kohala also proved it learned a few lessons Tuesday during a 17-25, 25-21, 25-13, 25-21 victory at the Dragons’ gym. Honokaa, by contrast, breezed through the Blue division at 13-1. \n“I told them 0-16 didn’t matter anymore and that we’re all starting over at 0-0 now,” Kaitoku said. “The girls are excited to have two chances to get to states.” \nThe first opportunity comes at 2:30 p.m. Thursday against two-time defending HHSAA Division II champion Konawaena (17-0), but at least Kohala knows what it’s up against. The Cowboys won a set against the Wildcats in their regular-season finale Oct. 16, giving them a confidence boost heading to the postseason. \n“(Konawaena) mixed up its lineup, but Naai Solomon-Lewis gave us a lot of momentum with her serve,” Kaitoku said. \nEven if the Wildcats cruise as expected, Kohala would get the loser of the semifinal between Pahoa (7-10) and Hawaii Prep (8-9) in Saturday’s third-place game. \nThe Cowgirls don’t have the benefit of any club players, but Kaitoku likes the pipeline of young players coming into her program. \nSolomon-Lewis is of one only three seniors on the team, and co-captain Shania Fuertes is among five freshmen. \n“Shania plays everywhere for us,” Kaitoku said. “From what I hear, we have a pretty good group coming in next season as well.” \nDivision I \nOn paper, the match of the day is the 7 p.m. semifinal between Hilo (11-5) and Kamehameha (12-4). The Vikings beat the Warriors in three sets earlier in the season, but five-time defending champion Kamehameha avenged that defeat and its only losses in its past 12 matches have come against Konawaena. \nAt 5:30 p.m., Waiakea (13-3) faces a Kealakehe (5-11) team it twice handled during the regular season. \nKonawaena and Waiakea already own berths to states.
