Tanner Mangum looks for an open receiver in the game against UConn. Mangum was named Madness Offensive Player of the Week following the 30-13 win. (Ari Davis) \nBYU freshman quarterback Tanner Mangum was named College Sports Madness Independent Offensive Player of the Week following a 30-13 win at home against University of Connecticut. \nMangum set the school record for freshman passing yards in a single game with his final 6-yard touchdown pass that brought his total to 365 yards. \nThe previous record was set by Matt Berry in 2002 against Wyoming with 360 yards. Mangum was 35 for 53 passing, including a streak of 12 consecutive passes, two touchdowns and two interceptions. His 35 completions and 53 attempts are both career highs for the young quarterback. \n“I was really impressed with Tanner,” head coach Bronco Mendenhall said following the game. “I thought he did a nice job overall with decision making and throwing the football. It seems like when he is out there on the field, he is doing something special.” \nThe Cougars and Huskies kept the game tight for the first three quarters and were tied 10-10 at the end of the third. However, the Cougars managed to score 20 points in the fourth quarter while the Huskies only managed 3. It was in this final quarter where Mangum threw his touchdown passes, both to senior wide receiver Mitch Mathews. BYU had 539 total yards and held UConn to 230.
