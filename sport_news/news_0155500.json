Hannibal boys soccer falls short to Boonville: The Hannibal High School boys soccer team was unable to complete its rally against visiting Boonville on Thursday, falling 3-2 in the North Central Missouri Conference matchup. “We looked tired,” Hannibal head coach Eric Hill said. “We just looked off. Part of that is Boonville, they're a pretty tough team. But I definitely don't think we played our best.” Boonville took a 2-0 first half lead on goals from Alec Adair and Philip Udinyiwe. Hannibal (10-6, 4-3), answered in the 48th minute in the second half on an unassisted goal from Caleb Ketsenburg. Adair pushed Boonville's advantage to 3-1 later in the second half, and Hannibal senior Jack Baumann finished the scoring with a goal on a penalty kick in the 78th minute. The Hannibal junior varsity played to a 0-0 tie and is now 2-3-2 on the year.
