KS provided design, permitting, and surveying for The Foundry, a state-of-the-art rowing facility on the Cuyahoga River.\nElyria, Ohio (PRWEB) October 08, 2015\nKS Associates Inc., a civil engineering and surveying firm located in Elyria, Ohio, is helping put infrastructure in place to support Cleveland’s growing interest in the sport of rowing. KS Associates was responsible for designing the dock area and river frontage for The Foundry, a new state-of-the-art rowing facility located along the Cuyahoga River in Cleveland.\nThe Foundry is the vision of Mike Trebilcock and his wife, Gina, who purchased a series of industrial buildings in hopes of transforming them into a recreational hub and education center for high school and college student athletes who want to become high performance rowers and sailors.\nIn 2014, Trebilcock, in conjunction with MCPc Family Charities, contracted with KS Associates to prepare construction plans for the Foundry’s dock area. KS Associates’ design included 520 lineal feet of rowing and launch docks, gangway ramps, steel platforms, and anchor piles. KS Associates also provided some permitting and surveying services for the project. Trebilcock and The Foundry are exceptionally proud of the due diligence with the project, including obtaining a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers, approval by the United States Coast Guard, and the Northeast Ohio shipping community.\nThe docks, constructed by RowAmerica, and boathouse opened for their first season in August 2015, just in time for the 2015-2016 school year. When fully constructed, The Foundry will be complete with a fitness center, indoor rowing tanks, and park.\nThe Foundry is located on the east side of Columbus Road across from Rivergate Park. With Rivergate Park and The Foundry on the banks of the Cuyahoga River, the project is helping make the riverfront more accessible to the growing rowing community.\nAbout KS Associates, Inc.:\nKS Associates, Inc. is a civil engineering and land surveying firm founded in 1987.
