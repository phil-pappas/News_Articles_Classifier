By GEORGE HENRYAssociated Press \nATLANTA (AP) - Southern University football player Devon Gales wants supporters to know he's in good spirits despite a paralyzing neck injury. \nThough his body movement is limited mostly to wrists, shoulders and biceps, Gales is telling family members and friends that he hopes to make a full recovery. \nFamily friend Kimberly August said Thursday that, \"People are calling to check on him, upset about his injury and he's consoling them.\" \nSpinal cord specialist Dr. Brock Bowman, Gales' attending physician at the Shepherd Center, expects he will be hospitalized at least eight weeks. \nBowman says it's too early to make a prognosis for recovery. Gales broke his sixth cervical vertebra in Saturday's game at Georgia. He underwent successful surgery Sunday. \n___", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T00:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T01:09:07.422+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
