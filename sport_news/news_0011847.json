But we just ran out of time.”\nYankees Coverage Houston Has No Problem Eliminating Yankees Yankees’ Sabathia Checks Into Rehab, Will Miss Postseason There will be no waking up for the Yankees, who saw their season end abruptly on Tuesday night with a meek 3-0 loss to the Astros in the American League wild-card game. The oldest offense in baseball looked the part, appearing gassed and worn down when it mattered most, with players such as 40-year-old designated hitter Alex Rodriguez chagrined and at a loss for answers.\n“I think the team just hit a wall, collectively, and that’s rare, because usually some guys get hot, some guys get cold,” Rodriguez said. “It seemed like all of us hit the wall at the same time.”\nIn a sense, that wall began to emerge in 2009, just after the Yankees won their most recent World Series title. Each October since, they have turned their focus to the next season, and usually not liked what they’ve seen. Much of the time, it’s been an old roster, getting older, with few reinforcements on the way.\n‘ I think the team just hit a wall, collectively, and that’s rare, because usually some guys get hot, some guys get cold. It seemed like all of us hit the wall at the same time. ’\n—Alex Rodriguez This year, Brian Cashman , the team’s longtime architect, is insisting that things are different. Finally, he pointed out, trades and a rejuvenated farm system have brought young talent to the Bronx. He cited a cadre of blooming young regulars including shortstop Didi Gregorius, as well as a core of young pitchers, as proof that the Yankees are on the upswing.\n“Listen, we have some real positive things coming,” Cashman said. “We’ve got a shortstop growing into an above-average player at the position right before our eyes at a very young age. That’s exciting. We have a number of young starting pitchers, and [Nathan] Eovaldi is going to be coming back and [Michael] Pineda and [Masahiro] Tanaka obviously, they’re what, 26 years of age? I think [Ivan] Nova is the oldest at 28, maybe, and he’ll be better because he’s a full year removed from Tommy John.”\nTwo years after the franchise went its traditional route by investing nearly $500 million in splashy off-season acquisitions (namely Tanaka, Jacoby Ellsbury, Brian McCann and Carlos Beltran), the Yankees are undoubtedly putting more of their future in the hands of the youngsters. Leading that movement are two players who blossomed in late-season call-ups this year: 21-year-old pitching prospect Luis Severino and 22-year-old first baseman Greg Bird. Severino will likely be the Yankees’ No. 2 starter next April, while Bird will find a spot on the roster somewhere, even if right now he is blocked by the aged but productive duo of Mark Teixeira and Alex Rodriguez.\nENLARGE Brett Gardner hit .198 in the final month of the 2015 season. Photo: adam hunger/Reuters Dustin Ackley, 27, and Rob Refsnyder, 24, formed a capable second-base platoon at the end of the season, and the team’s top positional prospect, 6-foot-7-inch slugger Aaron Judge, is waiting in the wings to take over when Beltran’s contract expires after next season. The old guard looks at this roster and sees only promise for next year.\n“I like our team and then you see what some guys have done: Sevy and Birdie and Refsnyder, you see some guys step up and do a great job for us,” Teixeira said. “I like what we’re gonna have next year.”\nThe problem, unfortunately, is with the Yankees on the other side of 30.\nRodriguez, Ellsbury, Gardner, McCann, third baseman Chase Headley and outfielder Chris Young all saw their production plummet in the season’s final month. Teixeira, 35, didn’t make it that far; he was lost after a foul ball caused a fracture in his leg in late August—a freak injury to be sure, but still the fourth straight season that injuries have limited him to fewer than 125 games.\nThe Yankees will have to rest that core far more next year if they hope to avoid a similar late-season slump, while supplementing it with a few choice finds in free agency—perhaps second baseman Ben Zobrist, whom Cashman considered a deal for this summer, or ace lefty pitcher David Price.\nRodriguez, who is still owed $42 million through the 2017 season, didn’t have an answer for how his team would get over that wall next in 2016, but as he looked around at his departing teammates Tuesday night, he proclaimed that there was more talent here than at any time since he’d joined the Yankees in 2004. To him and many of his teammates, that makes this season feel like less of a failure, and more of a stepping stone.\n“We came up a little short but I also think we’re going to be good for a long time,” he said.\nWrite to Daniel Barbarisi at Daniel.Barbarisi@wsj.com", "external_links": ["http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR098_NYYANK_P_20151007171313.jpg", "http://si.wsj.net/public/resources/images/BN-KR098_NYYANK_M_20151007171313.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-08T04:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:33:03.292+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
