If Murray had harped on a three-game start in which he managed just 1.6 yards per carry, it's unlikely he could have ever turned the corner as he increasingly has over the last two weeks.\nBut for Murray to suggest that all was well during a spate of games when the offensive line, the playing-calling and the running back were all contributing to the ineffectiveness of the running game would be disingenuous.\nMore coverage POLL: Is Sam Bradford a Super Bowl-caliber QB?

Yes No View results Three weeks ago, he implied that he needed to be \"lathered up\" (read: get more carries) to reach his full potential. After he had only eight rushes in the loss to the Redskins, he agreed that he needed more touches. And later that week, he said that there were parts of Chip Kelly's run scheme that were different than anything he did with the Cowboys.\nBear in mind, however, that he also said there were many similarities.\nKelly tinkered with his running plays for weeks, but it wasn't until the Saints game last week that the changes paid off. Murray ran for 83 yards on 20 totes but still didn't look as comfortable as teammate Ryan Mathews.\nThe first half of the Giants game was a repeat of the first month. Murray managed only 12 yards on five carries. But something clicked in the second half and for the first time since he signed with the Eagles, he looked like the tailback the team thought it was getting. And it wasn't just his numbers.\nMurray planted his foot and changed directions. He broke tackles. He got to the corner and turned up field. He stayed square to the line of scrimmage.\n\"I think you can probably say that about every running back,\" Kelly said when asked if Murray was more effective with his shoulders square. \"That's what football is. You don't want to play side to side. You want to play downhill.\"\nThe second half steamrollered on a Giants team that was increasingly unproductive on offense as the game went on. The Eagles expanded their lead and were able to pound the ground, running mostly out of two-tight end sets.\nThe Giants entered the game ranked first in the NFL in rushing defense. They held the Eagles to just 3.6 yards a carry in the first half. So Murray, Mathews (nine carries for 40 yards) and the offensive line deserve credit for cracking the G-men after the break. But a more complete defense - the first they will face since the Jets game - awaits when the Eagles travel to the Panthers on Sunday night.\nThe rushing offense was never as bad as it looked for most of the first four games. And it isn't likely as good as it has looked the last two weeks. But the improvement of the run blocking can't be denied.\n\"Our offensive line is executing. We haven't changed any schemes. We're doing the same things we've always done,\" Kelly said. \"But I think our offensive line is starting to come together and jell.\"\nKelly actually went back the drawing board against the Giants. After the Eagles ran from under center on 17 of 33 rushes against New Orleans, all 33 of the running backs' carries were from the shotgun. The Eagles actually had more success from the shotgun, but adding another element seemed to give the Saints another thing to think about.\nWhen Sam Bradford was under center on Monday night, he threw off play action. The results were mixed. He threw a 32-yard touchdown to Riley Cooper but also tossed an interception.\nKelly did carry over some of the changes he had made the week before. There was more man-to-man blocking rather than zone and the Eagles ran more out of \"12\" personnel (two tight ends, two receivers) Nursing a comfortable lead in the second half allowed Kelly to utilize more \"12\" personnel.\nBut the fact remains: The Eagles have been more successful on the ground with two tight ends and two receivers compared with one tight end and three receivers (\"11\" personnel). In the second half, for instance, Murray and Mathews rushed for 94 yards on 14 carries (6.7 average) with \"12\" personnel.\nMurray benefited from strong blocks by Brent Celek and Zach Ertz on his 12-yard touchdown run.\n\"Both tight ends did a really nice job,\" Kelly said. \"And then DeMarco got up to the free safety and that was the free safety he beat, kind of with a stiff arm. He knocked him to the ground. When you have a run play that pops and gets to the free safety that means the front seven did their job.\"\nThe Eagles had most of their success on the ground running with three receivers during Kelly's first two seasons, but they may not have that luxury this year. Plus, they don't have as many must-remain-on-the-field receivers as they did before. Ertz's blocking is also improved.\nMurray, aside from a third quarter fumble that could have proved costly, looked as comfortable running behind \"12\" personnel as he has all season.\n\"We're all executing better. We're all on the same page,\" Murray said. \"We're increasingly getting better and more comfortable with each other.\"\nProgress has been made. Now can Murray and the offensive line maintain it?\njmclane@phillynews.com\n@Jeff_McLane", "external_links": ["http://polls.clickability.com/polls", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=TrainingCamp&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2FNFL_Philadelphia_Eagles_NFL_Training_Camp"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:33:44.259+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
