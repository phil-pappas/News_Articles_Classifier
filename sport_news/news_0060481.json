If not, a deciding Game 5 will be played Wednesday in Toronto, where the Rangers won the first two games.\nTulowitzki's drive to left with two outs in the sixth inning put the Blue Jays up 5-0. That was two innings after he drew a bases-loaded walk. He missed most of the final three weeks of the regular season because of a cracked shoulder blade and bruised muscles in his upper back.\nTexas left-hander Martin Perez, somewhat a surprise pick as the Game 3 starter over veterans Derek Holland and Colby Lewis, gave up four runs and six hits while pitching into the sixth.\nHolland (4-3) starts Game 4 against knuckleballer R.A. Dickey (11-11).\nThe Blue Jays had their leadoff hitter at second base to start each the third through fifth innings, a span that included three double plays ignited by second baseman Rougned Odor.\nToronto started the sixth with consecutive singles to chase Perez, and Edwin Encarnacion then drew a 10-pitch walk from rookie reliever Chi Chi Gonzalez to load the bases before the Rangers' fourth double play in an as many innings.\nFirst baseman Mitch Moreland fielded Chris Colabello's hard-hit hopper, threw home for the first out and got back to the bag to take the return throw.\nTulowitzki, then 0-for-11 in the series, followed with his homer on a full-count pitch.\nIt was only the second postseason homer in 69 career postseason at-bats for Tulowitzki. The first 57 ABs came in 15 playoff games in 2007 and 2009 for the Colorado Rockies, who traded the shortstop to Toronto on July 27.\nTulowitzki was a career .179 postseason hitter until the homer. He later singled.\nWith Estrada on the mound, Dioner Navarro was the Blue Jays starting catcher instead of playoff veteran Russell Martin.\nNavarro got Toronto's first hit, a double leading off the third. He would score on a double play.\nJosh Donaldson led off the fourth with a double and scored when Tulowitzki was the third batter in a row walked by Perez.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T08:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T17:15:46.046+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
