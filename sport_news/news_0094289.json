Conley caught six passes in place of injured Jeremy Maclin. \nThe Steelers were without starting quarterback Ben Roethlisberger for the fourth consecutive game, and backup Michael Vick was unavailable due to a hamstring injury. No. 3 quarterback Landry Jones made his first NFL start, and it was not an afternoon to remember, as he threw a pair of interceptions and lost a fumble on a sack by Chiefs outside linebacker Tamba Hali. \nAt times Pittsburgh was able to move the ball, as running back Le'Veon Bell ran for 121 yards and wide receiver Antonio Brown caught six passes for 124 yards. But only once were the Steelers able to reach the end zone. \nThe Chiefs are now 2-5 and head to London to face Detroit next Sunday. Pittsburgh is 4-3 and it will host the Cincinnati Bengals. \nThe busiest players in the first half were the kickers, as the halftime score of 9-3 was established with field goals. Kansas City's Cairo Santos hit from 22, 27 and 30 yards, but missed a 54-yard attempt. Pittsburgh's Chris Boswell made a 24-yarder.The successful field goals all came because neither offense was productive inside the opponent's 20-yard line. The Steelers had a first-and-10 at the Chiefs 14-yard line and couldn't get near the end zone. Kansas City's offense had possessions on first down at Pittsburgh's 13-, 19- and 9-yard lines and settled for three pointers on all three opportunities. \nIt was late in the third quarter before a touchdown was added to the scoreboard, as West dove over the pile on a third-and-goal snap just inches off the goal line. Santos' PAT kick gave the Chiefs a 16-3 lead. \nBut Landry moved Pittsburgh in for a touchdown just before the end of the period, connecting with wide receiver Martavis Bryant on a 19-yard scoring pass. Bryant made an ankle-buckling double move on Chiefs cornerback Sean Smith, who fell down and allowed Bryant wide open access to the end zone. That cut the deficit to 16-10. Pittsburgh later added another field goal from Boswell, this one from 36 yards, and the Steelers pulled within three points. \nBut the Chiefs' offense put together one of its best drives of the last month, as Smith took the team 84 yards on eight plays before he connected with a Conley for a 6-yard touchdown pass. The PAT kick gave the Chiefs a 10-point lead with just over five minutes to play. \nNOTES: the Chiefs scrambled their beleaguered offensive line, making changes at three of the five spots. Eric Fisher moved from right to left tackle. Jeff Allen started at right tackle and Laurent Duvernay-Tardif opened at right guard. It was Allen's first action of the season with the offense ... Steelers CB Antwon Blake left the game in the second quarter to be analyzed for a possible concussion. He returned to the field at the start of the second half. ... The 1-yard touchdown by Chiefs RB Charcandrick West was the first for the Kansas City offense in the last 15 quarters of play. Distributed by LAKANA and The Sports Xchange.
