(AP) - SolarCity says the rooftop panels it will make at a plant being built in Buffalo have been rated the most efficient in the world.\nThe San Mateo, California-based solar installer says Friday the new module produces 30 to 40 percent more power than a same-size standard panel. The company also says it can make the panels at \"significantly\" lower cost than similar technologies.\nNew York is spending $750 million to build a 1 million-square-foot manufacturing plant for SolarCity as part of Gov. Andrew Cuomo's \"Buffalo Billion\" economic development program. SolarCity has committed to investing $5 billion over 10 years, hiring almost 1,500 workers at the plant for 5 years and employing at least 2,000 more people across the state.\nSolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive (ryv) expects production to begin in the first quarter of 2017.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
