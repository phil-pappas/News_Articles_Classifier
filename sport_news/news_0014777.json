CHARLES NORTH (5-2, 2-2 UEC RIVER) AT ST. CHARLES EAST (2-3, 3-2 UEC RIVER), 7:30 p.m. today \nThe buzz in the stands \nIt's been said a few times already, but we'll say it one more time this season: For St. Charles East to get in the playoffs, it will need to beat a fellow Tri-Cities school, and its final chance comes tonight. St. Charles North heads to Norris Stadium for what will be another highly anticipated game in the UEC River, albeit between two much different teams. \nWhile both schools fell out of the conference race with losses to Geneva and Batavia, there is still much importance with this contest. The Saints sit at three wins, needing the final two victories to be eligible for a playoff berth, while the North Stars seek an automatic bid into the postseason with a win. \n\"I think all year we've believed in our guys , and they're starting to believe in themselves at the right time,\" East coach Bryce Farquhar said. \"We just have to go out and finish. That's been our code for the week ... to go finish what we started.\" \nThe marquee matchup \nEast's progression with it's triple-option offense has grown week by week. The North Stars haven't seen an offense that features the option quite like the Saints do. East features a number of runners including Cam Canales and recent freshman call-up Justin Jett. While quarterback Zach Mitchell also possesses the ability to run with the football, limiting Canales and Jett will be crucial for North. \n\"Their progression is quite obvious on film with that offense, but it's on us defensively,\" North Stars coach Rob Pomazak said. \"It's going to be responsibility-based defense and you have to continue to stay disciplined play after play after play. We understand the scheme very well and are going to come out and execute and be very physical.\" \nThe X-factor \nIt seems as though North could care less how much time it possesses the ball this season, In fact, I think the team has tried to get that number as low as possible sometimes. With quarterback Zach Mettetal at the helm, Pomazak wants to use his up-tempo offense to get down the field quickly and put as many points on the board as it can. \nMettetal has weapons like Eric Lins in the backfield, while wide receivers Griffin Hammer, Jayson Reckards and Tyler Mettetal have been on the receiving end of several scores this year. \n\"It'll really come down to who can control the ball,\" Farquhar said. \"They like the fast tempo and don't care as much about running clock, where we are the opposite. We're comfortable with the kids we have on the field defensively, and if they are in the right spots, we think we'll be all right.\" \nEast is just the opposite on offense. Farquhar would love to feature 15- to 17-play drives that wear down the clock, as well as the North Stars' defense, and find the end zone. The Saints took Geneva to the wire a couple weeks ago, and believe the evolution of their option will cause North some problems. \nBest case-scenario for the North Stars \nIf North can take an early lead and eventually stretch it to two scores, this one could be over quickly. North has jumped ahead in just about every game it has played, and doing so may cause East to change what it wants to do offensively. \nBest-case scenario for the Saints \nImposing their will with the option. The Saints will have a lot to worry about defensively with Mettetal's footwork and ability to create when the pocket breaks down. But one way to make sure it doesn't happen often is to keep him on the sidelines. Despite trying to emulate the option this week in practice, the North Stars won't be able to see how well that preparation has gotten them until it sees the scheme live. If the Saints can control the tempo and keep the ball, things could get interesting. \nChris Casey's prediction \nSt. Charles North 31, St. Charles East 27 \nI was close to picking the upset, I really was. I just think too much would have to go right for East to pull it off, though it wouldn't surprise me if it happens. The Saints did impress me with their close call with Geneva, but I think North's ability to get on the board early may take East out of its comfort zone a little bit.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T06:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T11:23:06.761+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
