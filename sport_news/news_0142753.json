It will be attended by the Tripartite National Committee (TNC), as well as French and Dutch consultancy firms to discuss the points of difference between the countries over the dam, so as to start in the technical assessment of it.\nIn September, Dutch consultancy firm Deltares withdrew from the assessment of the dam. Deltares stated that it had withdrawn from the project as the conditions imposed by the TNC -- which includes representatives from Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia, as well as the French consultancy firm BRL -- did not provide sufficient guarantees for Deltares that an independent high-quality study could be carried out.\nSince then, the future of the Renaissance Dam negotiations has remained unclear.\nEgypt has repeatedly expressed concerns that its share of Nile water could be compromised by Ethiopia's dam project.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T22:22:32.743+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
