Mitch, who started the opening two games this season for the Gamecocks before a separated throwing shoulder and a severe hip bruise combined to sideline him, could return to the field in Saturday’s 4 p.m. home game against Vanderbilt. But when he looks to the bench, he won’t see Steve Spurrier calling the plays. “Obviously, you don’t want to see a coach like that leave,” Mitch said of Spurrier, who resigned Tuesday in the wake of his worst first half to a season at USC. “He was great for this program, and everyone on this team. We’re obviously going to miss him a lot.” Spurrier is a primary reason why Mitch, a four-star prospect who passed for more than 12,000 yards in high school, came to South Carolina. Mitch remembers receiving the letter from Spurrier expressing USC’s interest in him, remembers the Head Ball Coach visiting his home in Raleigh, N.C. Spurrier’s legacy and legend often took a special hold on quarterbacks, and Mitch was no exception. “I fell in love with him and coach (G.A.) Mangus,” he said, also referring to USC’s quarterbacks coach, now the Gamecocks’ offensive coordinator. “He was a huge part of my recruitment.” Any second thoughts would be natural — not only has Spurrier left, turning the Gamecocks (2-4, 0-4 SEC) over to former offensive line coach Shawn Elliott for the final six games of the season, but Mitch also returns to a crowded quarterback situation in which junior Perry Orth and true freshman Lorenzo Nunez have each started two games in his absence. Orth is slated to start against Vanderbilt (2-3, 0-2). But transferring? “I wouldn’t do that (to) all my teammates,” Mitch said. “I love all of them, coach Mangus, all of the offensive coaches. Obviously with (Spurrier) leaving, it stinks. But it’s not going to change my idea of the school.” For now, at least, the focus is on returning to the field. In the Sept. 12 game against Kentucky, Mitch was hit with a double barrel of injuries — he separated his throwing shoulder trying to recover an errant second-quarter option pitch, and also exacerbated a left hip bruise he had initially suffered being hit on a zone-read carry the week prior against North Carolina. During the Kentucky game, he said, he wasn’t aware that he had done any further damage to his hip, which had forced him to sit out part of the UNC contest the previous week. Leaving the locker room after halftime, he realized his hip was “getting really swollen,” he said. He immediately sought out team physician Dr. Jeff Guy. “I realized I had to get out of there,” Mitch added. He would be hospitalized two days, put on a course of intravenous antibiotics, and later have to return for a blood transfusion. “It was definitely a tough couple of weeks, with being in the hospital, the transfusion, and obviously not being out here with my teammates, which was the only thing I wanted to do,” Mitch said. “It was very tough, but you have to stay mentally prepared.” The hip injury, he said, cleared up by early October. He began throwing lightly last week, and returned to practice Monday. All four of USC’s quarterbacks were back in practice this week, after Spurrier was able to outfit just two — Orth and Michael Scarnecchia — for last Saturday’s loss at No. 6 LSU. Nunez missed that contest with a sprained shoulder suffered against Missouri, and although the freshman is practicing, his availability for Vanderbilt remains uncertain. But the Gamecocks remain healthier at the positon than they’ve been in weeks. “They’ve all done pretty well, really. Their grades and things they’ve done during the games have not been bad,” Mangus said. “We’ve got to play better and more consistent as an offense. That’s been our biggest issue this year as an offense, just consistency. And hopefully, we’re going to get some things narrowed down, and maybe get some reps over and over and over to build the consistency we need.” For the first time in a month, Mitch — whom it was initially feared might miss the entire season due to the shoulder separation — is part of that equation. His head coach may be gone, but he can still try to reclaim the starting job he left behind. “We have a lot of faith in the other quarterbacks,” Mitch said. “Perry and Lorenzo have all done a great job. You’ve just got to go out there and win it back.” Keywords", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T23:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T01:04:52.489+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
