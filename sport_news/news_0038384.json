Moore says Odom requested to be driven from a home in Las Vegas to the brothel. Moore, who is the brothel’s general manager, picked him up. “We had a nice visit for an hour and a half,” Moore said. “He was amazed with scenery.Moore says that when Odom arrived, he requested that calls be blocked from getting to him.“He didn’t indicate what he wanted to get away from but was adamant he wanted no phone calls, don’t acknowledge he was here, wanted rest and relaxation.”Authorities were called to the brothel around 3:15 p.m. Tuesday in response to an unresponsive male. The 6-foot-10 Odom was too tall for an available helicopter, so he was driven by ambulance to Sunrise Hospital.Moore’s employees came rushing in to her office moments after finding Odom. The 35-year-old estranged husband of reality star Khloe Kardashian was wearing a pair of basketball shorts. Moore says she turned him over on to his side and helped clear out his mouth, where a white substance and blood were oozing out.Moore says she didn’t think Odom was close to death and adds that there are prayers at the brothel that he will survive.“It’s very traumatizing,” she said. “He was kind to ladies and to everyone at the house. We’ve all been praying, but one never knows.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T08:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T00:12:59.116+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
