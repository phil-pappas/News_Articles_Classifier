(RICHARD SHIRO / AP) Clemson coach Dabo Swinney talks God, ACC country and Notre Dame independence. \nJesus has one of the best seats around Notre Dame Stadium. \nIn Death Valley, not so much. \nJust as well because he probably couldn't afford the $1,000-plus price tag attached to a good seat at Memorial Stadium — or the $400-plus average cost — for Saturday's top-12 matchup between Notre Dame and Clemson. \n\"I couldn't get Jesus tickets, and that's the truth,\" Tigers coach Dabo Swinney said. \nMaybe he doesn't have StubHub. \nFootball is religion's close relative in some places. So the fact admission prices have reached biblical proportions for a game of this proportion should be no surprise. \nSwinney's take on God, ACC country and Notre Dame's status as an independent — mostly the latter — is something of a head-scratcher. A devout Christian who has been criticized by the Freedom from Religion Foundation for incorporating what he called \"voluntary\" prayer into the state-funded school's football program, Swinney never has apologized for his faith, his honesty or his sense of humor. \nAnd he shouldn't have to. \nHe also won't apologize for his belief that the Irish should be in a conference (he'd be fine with the ACC) — or at least play 13 games like most conference champions. Otherwise, as far as he's concerned, they should not be eligible for the College Football Playoff. \nHe said as much this summer — he wasn't the only one — and reiterated it this week. \n\"I don't think it's fair. I don't think it's equitable,\" Swinney said. \"You asked me the question. I answered it. Next thing I know, I'm national news.\" \nWhy? \n\"Somebody mentioned Notre Dame,\" he continued. \"Somebody mentioned that about Iowa or Iowa Wesleyan, nobody would care. But Notre Dame, man, I'm all over the news like I've got some agenda. I ain't got no agenda. I don't care what they do.\" \nExcept he spent most of his 356-word answer basically saying he does while illogically comparing college scheduling to NFL scheduling. \nBesides, why should the Irish join a football conference? The quality of their schedule already outweighs that of most teams. Should they add a meaningless 13th game against an inferior opponent, the likes of which Clemson, and a lot of others, play every year? Wofford, anyone? Or next year, South Carolina State? Or the year after that, The Citadel? \nPlaying in-state schools is fine and good. But in Clemson's case, it does nothing for its quality of schedule. \nA source told the Tribune this summer, in light of Missouri coach Gary Pinkel's similar comments about Notre Dame and unfairness and conferences: \"Safe to say he doesn't enjoy our independence as much as, say, we do.\" \nSafe to say, Notre Dame coach Brian Kelly doesn't view the matter through the same prism as his counterpart. Notre Dame brings eyeballs wherever it goes. Notre Dame has its own TV show. Notre Dame does Notre Dame just fine without shared conference revenues and scheduling. Good for Notre Dame. \n\"No response,\" Kelly said. \"Other than our schedule has to do the talking for us.\" \nThere's not an FCS team to be found on the Irish's docket. Never has been. \nClemson's most appropriate response to its coach's proclaimed indifference is simple: Defeat the Irish on Saturday. \nStrength of schedule can be overrated. Strength of a message like that cannot. \nSwinney grew up in Alabama with his good friend Keith Young, \"the biggest Notre Dame fan you've ever met in your life.\" Swinney said he learned a lot about the Irish as a child, such as not to like them. \n\"Watching the three channels we had ... Notre Dame was on TV,\" he said. \"I learned to not like Notre Dame because Alabama was a great program under Coach (Bear) Bryant, and Notre Dame was a great program back in the '70s.\" \nThat was then. This is now. Pope Francis was in the U.S. Swinney has jokes. There's a game Saturday. \n\"I do think it's a little unfair that they brought the pope into town just in time for the Clemson game,\" he said. \"It's kind of a low blow.\" \nExcept the pope went home Sunday. He probably couldn't get tickets to the game either.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T03:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T04:01:13.206+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
