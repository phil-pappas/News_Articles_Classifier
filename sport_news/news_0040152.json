Not only are they coming off a bye week, but it is also homecoming.“Our guys are excited to get out there and play,” coach Tyler Wynn said. “We’re coming off an off week, so we had some extra time to prepare. I think the guys are just excited to get back out in front of a home crowd, especially for homecoming. Hopefully, the weather will hold off, and we’ll have a good, clean night of football for the first time in a few weeks.”To deal with the down time, Wynn and his staff tried to make practices similar to game action.“We spent most of our time competing against ourselves,” Wynn said. “We put our kids in some situations with some situational scrimmages. We just tried to get our guys back into the swing of things and still have some live action during that week. We just put our kids in a position to compete in practice to try to simulate as many game-type situations as we could during that week.”Wynn feels it is only a matter of time before River Ridge breaks through, and the players are doing the right things in practice to get that elusive first win.“They’re still working hard,” he said. “If you come out and watch us practice, you’ll see that our guys aren’t practicing like a winless football team. They’re still getting after it every day.“Our guys are getting better, but our competition is getting better, too. That’s the tough thing about it. Now that we’re in our region schedule, we’re seeing some better opponents. We just need to raise our level of play even higher.”Injuries have hit the River Ridge defense hard, and it has shown with the Knights giving up 42.8 points per game, and more than 40 in all but one game. They will have their hands full again with the Dalton offense, which averages 26.6 points per game.The Catamounts (5-2, 3-1) rely on the rushing duo of Drake McCowan (516 yards, eight touchdowns) and Darien Hill (262 yards, four touchdowns).Wynn said it will be a challenge, and it will be up to the players and coaches to contain the offense.“They’re big and they’re athletic,” he said. “Our players have to match that and, as coaches, we’re just going to do everything we can to put our kids in position to make plays and make tackles.”Offensively, River Ridge has looked good at times this season. Quarterback Marcus Spears throwing to Davis Polley has been a dangerous combination, but without a consistent running game, it has not been enough to win. A greater burden will fall on Tremain Carr and the other running backs this week to keep the offense balanced.“We’re looking at a couple of different things we can do,” Wynn said. “We want to be able to move the ball both on the ground and through the air. If we can get our running game going, that will help tremendously. We put in some different sets for our guys to get our running game going. We want to still have success through the air. We just don’t want to solely rely on that.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T08:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T09:21:10.583+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
