Hingle-USA TODAY Sports)\n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE The Pelicans slipped into the playoffs on the last night of the season and had to face the No. 1 seed Golden State Warriors. In order to get back and maybe not have to face the top seed, New Orleans needs to show continued improvement.\nWhat’s different this season? Alvin Gentry, the new head coach, was placed in a favorable situation in New Orleans with superstar Anthony Davis and a solid supporting cast. He’s taking over the reins of a franchise that’s playing as good of basketball as it ever has in its 12-year history.\nHow good can they be? If Ryan Anderson, Jrue Holiday, and Eric Gordon — three of the most vital members of the rotation — can stay healthy, the Pelicans have the capability to finish higher than last season. They won’t jump the Warriors, Houston Rockets, Los Angeles Clippers or San Antonio Spurs, but finishing as high as sixth isn’t out of the question.\nHow far they have to go: The two main factors keeping the Pelicans from making more noise in the West are a lack of depth and support in the frontcourt for Davis. Acquiring a player who could bring a burst of energy off the bench and/or a second big man other than Omer Asik, Alexis Ajinca, or Kendrick Perkins would make a significant difference.\nHealth, health, health: The majority of the Pelicans’ success will depend on the health of their injury-prone key players. Holiday played 40 games, Anderson and Gordon each played 61 and Davis missed 14. As a team in the West that lacks depth, you can’t expect to be playing in late April without all of your necessary pieces.\nFear the brow: Davis is quickly transforming into an elite NBA superstar. He finished fifth in MVP voting last season, putting up gaudy numbers: 24.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 2.9 blocks, and 2.2 assists. The man is only 22 years old, and the Pelicans rewarded him with a five-year, $145 million deal to keep him, so the future of the NBA is in New Orleans.\nTOP VIDEOS", "external_links": ["http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S6naOR&mini=true", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//usat.ly/1S6naOR&text=New%20Orleans%20Pelicans%20preview%3A%20How%20far%20can%20Anthony%20Davis%20carry%20them%3F&via=usatoday", "http://imgur.com/qbGS5Gh.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814503137738299-USP-NBA--Preseason-Miami-Heat-at-New-Orleans-Pelic.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/eb36de8f603a6712d2052486c96c83820458f244/c=165-0-4523-3277&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814503137738299-USP-NBA--Preseason-Miami-Heat-at-New-Orleans-Pelic.jpg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4044b1e7645488621f157de466cf1a990870caa2/r=500x333/local/-/media/2015/10/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/635814503137738299-USP-NBA--Preseason-Miami-Heat-at-New-Orleans-Pelic.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-26T19:02:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:29:11.732+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
