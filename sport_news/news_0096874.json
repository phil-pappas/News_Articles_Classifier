The New Melones area received the least amount of rain at 0.15 inch. \nThe shower ended about 2 p.m. Thursday afternoon and the sun returned. \n“Dry weather and warmer temperatures are expected Friday in advance of another system that will bring cooler weather and a chance of showers and thunderstorms late Saturday into early next week,” stated the National Weather Service. \nAs for the drought, “It’s too small of an amount to have an effect,” said Idamif Del Valle, spokeswoman of the National Weather Service. \n“We are still missing over a year’s worth, and it takes a lot to recover from that. But it does help with fires, just not the drought.” \n“Regardless, a fairly good shot for another round of precipitation across most of the area from late Saturday through at least the end of the weekend,” stated a National Weather Service report. \nThe rainfall turned to snow in the high country, forcing Caltrans to close Highway 108 Thursday night. Highways 120 and 4 remained open. \nThe National Weather Service forecasts that today will reach a high of 78 degrees and a low of 56 degrees with a northeast wind from 6 to 8 mph. \nSaturday will reach 75 degrees, and the night will bring a 20 percent chance of rain after 11 p.m. with partly cloudy skies and a low temperature of 51 degrees. \nSunday shows a 20 percent chance of showers and thunderstorms while being partly sunny with a high of 66 degrees. Sunday night will be mostly cloudy with a chance of showers and a low near 53. \nThe beginning of the work week will be mostly sunny with a high near 69 degrees and a chance of showers.
