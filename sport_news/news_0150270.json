Zimbabwe were bowled out for 128 in 37 overs after Pakistan had piled up 259 for six. A century partnership from Mohammad Rizwan and Imad Wasim set the touring side up for victory but it was the leg breaks of 29-year-old spinner Yasir that proved decisive. Imad and Rizwan shared a stand of 124 for the sixth wicket to help Pakistan recover after they had slumped to 35 for three. Rizwan scored a career-best 75 not out and Imad, run out for 61, struck a maiden international half-century. Zimbabwe then lost wickets at regular intervals in their reply. Brief scores: Pak: 259/6 (Rizwan 75*, Wasim 61) bt Zimbabwe: 128 (Yasir 6-26) by 131 runs.

Zurich\nIndia drop 12 places to 167th in FIFA rankings India have dropped 12 places to the 167th spot in the latest global football rankings released on Thursday. India were in the 155th spot rankings last month. The dip follows poor performances in the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers where India have lost all three group matches played so far. India are scheduled to face Turkmenistan and Oman, in two away matches on October 8 and 13, respectively. World Cup 2010 holders Spain rose five places to the sixth spot and got back into the Top 10 after three months out of the elite group. New Delhi\nAFI says Turkey training tour is on, nobody skipping The Athletics Federation of India said that the 90-day training stint of its athletes in Turkey will go ahead if the government clears it and nobody has officially communicated to the AFI to skip the tour. The AFI said that the tour to Turkey has been sanctioned by the Sports Ministry and is only waiting the final formalities, while refuting a media report which had claimed that some women athletes were reluctant to accompany Ukrainian coach Yuri Ogorodnik for the training stint because of his alleged involvement in 2011 doping scandal. It said that the 90-day intensive training in Turkey will attract far more international attention and scrutiny, and athletes will not be able to “escape the attention of the global anti-doping bodies, as compared to training in remote places in India”. — Agencies", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:11:07.895+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
