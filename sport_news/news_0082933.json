Crazy question: Would the Yankees be better off starting Luis Severino in Tuesday’s wild-card game?\nThe answer is (mostly) no, but don’t roll your eyes either. Consider it a conversation-starter about a team that’s staggering to the finish line, stripped of most its weapons for the postseason.\nThe Bombers finally clinched a wild-card berth with a 4-1 win over the Red Sox on Thursday, sparing them the embarrassment of getting swept at home by a team that was playing for 2016. The Yankees celebrated, but the vibe was mostly anti-climactic – nothing in their performance this week bodes well for what’s around the corner.\nTo be fair, though, we should get an important disclaimer out of the way: September momentum (or lack of) doesn’t count for much in October. Statistically speaking, the playoffs offer no guarantees either way – they swallow up both good and bad teams with their randomness and unpredictability.\nAs SI.com recently noted, of the 20 world champions in the wild-card era, 11 played better in September than they did the rest of the season. Nine played worse.\nSo the Yankees at least have that going for them: as sluggish as they looked down the stretch, there’s no calculus that says they can’t get hot starting Tuesday.\nBut only a fool would ignore the red flags that’ll accompany the Bombers into that nine-inning sudden death.\n\nMasahiro Tanaka is at the top of that list. Yankees officials did their best to rationalize his uneven outing Wednesday, insisting he was simply rusty after a 12-day layoff because of a leg injury. Probably so. The Japanese right-hander allowed four runs in five innings and showed only glimpses of his prior dominance.\nTanaka generated only three swings and misses in the 94 pitches he threw. Even more tellingly, the Red Sox whiffed on just one of his 17 splitters. Tanaka deserves credit for hanging in there this summer, refusing to succumb to partial tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in his elbow. But respect and regard for the right-hander aside, the Yankees will need better from him Tuesday.\nThat’s why Severino enters the conversation, if only hypothetically: he’s the healthiest of the Bombers’ starters, blessed with the most electric stuff and has shown the kind of composure necessary for the postseason.\nTanaka is still the man of the hour – that’s why the Bombers paid $155 million to get him, to handle pressure such as this – but Severino is at least moving up the depth chart. He could very well become the Game 1 starter in the division series, given how wobbly Michael Pineda has been.\nThere’s nothing wrong with leaning on a rookie – Yankees historians will remember Mel Stottlemyre helped take an aging Bomber team to the World Series in 1964 – but even Severino, for all the life in his arm, can’t help the offense.\nTherein lies the real problem manager Joe Girardi faces: how to squeeze more runs out of a lineup that lost its most dangerous run-producer (Mark Teixeira) and has seen another power threat (Alex Rodriguez) fall into a black hole.\nA-Rod is batting just .192 since Aug. 1 and looks spent. The bat speed that underscored his surprisingly productive first half is gone. Rodriguez looks overmatched by even mediocre pitchers now. He’s striking out almost one of every three at-bats of late.\nIt’s true, Carlos Beltran’s hot streak has largely replaced A-Rod’s slump and Greg Bird has been an exciting Plan B during Teixeira’s absence. But the Yankees miss Tex’ presence from the right side of the plate and will continue to be vulnerable against left-handers as long as A-Rod struggles.\nStill, the Bombers can at least say they’ve ended a two-year playoff drought and they’ve improved on their regular-season win total for the third year in a row.\nConsidering how low the expectations were in spring training, the Bombers would consider the wild-card a triumph. Sort of.\nBut this is the same team that led the East by seven games in late July and looked good enough to roll straight to the World Series. Rival executives admit they were caught off-guard by how productive A-Rod and Teixeira were, and that Tanaka’s arm never blew out. And that once you fell behind in the late innings and had to face Dellin Betances and Andrew Miller, you effectively signed your death sentence.\nThat the formula changed after Teixeira and A-Rod disappeared, as Brian McCann batted .177 in September and Brett Gardner .208. Just as the Yankees surprised the league in the first half, they were a .500 team (28-28) after Aug. 1 and had no response for the Blue Jays’ rapid ascent.\nToronto was the better team; no one would argue that, having beaten the Yankees five of six times last month. And if the Bombers do get past the wild-card game, they could very well face those same Jays in the division series.\nIt’s not a comforting thought, although the Yankees were in no mood to contemplate those darker possibilities Thursday. They drank a little champagne, lit up cigars and told themselves that anything is possible from this point on, the same message the Giants and Royals spread in 2014.\nTrue enough: the Bombers earned the right to party, at least for a night. Reality, though, is waiting.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T07:13:37.980+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
