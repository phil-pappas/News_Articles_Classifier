Conway Christian, as expected, powered past Quitman to stay in second place in 2A-5. ALMA 40, CONWAY 35 \nAt Alma, the Wampus Cats (3-4, 2-2) trailed the Airedales (5-2, 3-1), 28-10 at the half only to have a stirring comeback in the final quarter fall short. \nSophomore Garrison Jensen led the Airedales on a touchdown drive and scored from the 1 with 3:10 left to spark the 40-35 victory. Quarterback Breylin Smith led the Cats back only to find strong coverage and had to scramble on fourth and six and his pass to Marquise Pleasant fell incomplete in the fina two minutes. \nConway’s comeback began with an interception by Nick Fletcher on the first possession of the second half. The point-af \nter was missed after a penalty. After the Airedales drove to a touchdown, Pleasant gave the Cats further momentum returning the kickoff 100 yards for a touchdown. A fumble recovery by Will Kennedy on the CHS led to a scoring drive after Smith hit Pleasant deep. Mark Odom’s 22-yard run pulled Conway with 34-29. A fumble recovery by Fletcher led to Smith’s skittery, 22-yard scramble for a touchdown with 8:12 left. The two-point conversion failed but Conway had its first lead at 35-34. That set the stage for Alma’s winning drive using the read option to march through the CHS defense. LR CHRISTIAN 43, GREENBRIER 42 \nAt Don Jones Stadium, undefeated Little Rock Christian (7-0, 5-0) trailed by three touchdowns midway through the third quarter then staged an amazing rally for the 43-42 victory over the Panthers (4-3, 3-1) in a confrontation of unbeatens in 5A-West. Demarea Crockett was the workhorse for the Warriors in the comeback, rushing for 289 yards and two touchdowns on 49 carries. He ran for a touchdown for 2 yards with 15 seconds left. His run for the conversion proved to be the game-winner. The Panthers’ Harold Ross had a big game passing as Greenbrier stunned the Warriors by building a 42-21 lead in the third quarter. MAUMELLE 32, VILONIA 24 \nAt Phillip Weaver Stadium, Maumelle (3-4, 2-2) rallied from deficits of 17-13 and 24-19 in the second half to spoil homecoming for the Eagles (3-3 1-3). The Eagles lost their third straight. Nick Howard had 79 receiving yards and one touchdown for Vilonia. The Hornets passed for 121 yards and rushed for 148. BALD KNOB 35, MAYFLOWER 21 \nAt Patrick Stadium, Bald Knob trailed Mayflower 14-7 early, then rallied for the 35-21 victory to take a share of the lead in 2-3A. Bald Knob is 4-3, 4-0 while Mayflower, which had a three-game winnng streak snapped, fell to 3-4, 3-1. CONWAY CHRISTIAN 54, QUITMAN 18 \nAt Mission Field, Jakob Henry completed 16 of 21 passes for 373 yards and accounted for eight touchdowns in leading the Eagles (5-2, 4-1) to the 54-18 romp over Quitman (4-3, 2-2). Henry had scoring passes of 25 and 62 yards to Seth Smith and 13 yards to Clayton Dent, then ran 4 yards for another score as CCS built a 28-12 lead at halftime.
