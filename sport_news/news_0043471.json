Both teams delivered strong performances, with the girls finishing fourth and the boys finishing sixth in the Div. 2 varsity team results. The New Canaan girls scored 156 points with an average time of 21:20 in their fourth-place finish. John Jay/Cross River won with 35 points, with Briarcliff (71), Mamaroneck (104), New Canaan, and Nyack (169) rounding out the top five. The race featured 13 schools. Sophomore Cali Brannan led the Rams with an 18th-place finish in 20:22.73 on the 4K course, with junior Drew Davis taking 27th place in 20:56.68. Sophomore Leigh Charlton was 38th in 21:43.67, followed by sophomore Chloe McAuliffe (42nd, 21:49.03), junior Megan Waldron (43rd, 21:51.52), sophomore Paulina Cortina (58th, 23:24.92), and junior Rebecca Serven (59th, 23:28.66). Mamaroneck’s Lauren Chapey, a senior, won the race in 17:56.72, with John Jay freshman Pippa Nutali second in 18:30.55, and Briarcliff senior Caroline Pennacchio third in 18:32.96. The New Canaan boys team took sixth place among 15 team, scoring 184 points. The Rams’ average time of 17:49 was the seventh fastest in the race. Host Brewster was first with 77 points, followed by Fox Lane (120), Horace Greeley (145), Harborfields (148), and Irvington (155) in the top five. Ram junior Michael St. George cracked the top 10 in the competitive field, finishing ninth over the 5,000-meter course. He timed in at 16:56.51, just behind a pair of runners from Horace Greeley and Putnam Valley High Schools in New York. Running on his home course, Brewster senior Kevin Hazelwood was the race winner in 15:46.20, more than 11 seconds ahead of runner-up Chris Biondi of Pine Bush, who was second in 15:57.64. New Canaan sophomore Alex Urbahn came through with a great performance, finishing 21st overall in 17:16.18. Next for the Rams were juniors Fausto Cortina and Jake Grigsby, who finished a few seconds apart. Cortina was 47th in 18:11.68, and Grigsby was 49th in 18:14.04.

The performance on Saturday followed a tough FCIAC meet last Tuesday, as the New Canaan boys and girls were swept by Ludlowe, Warde and Staples in Waveny Park. The girls fell by scores of 24-31 to Ludlowe, 23-32 to Warde, and 19-38 to Staples, while the boys lost by scores of 27-32 to Ludlowe, 20-43 to Warde, and 15-50 to Staples. In the girls race, Staples senior Hannah DeBalsi, the two-time defending FCIAC champion, won the 4,000-meter race by more than a minute and a half, finishing in 14:32. The next two finishers were from Warde as Gabi Galletta was second in 16:04, and Sarah Radziewicz was third in 16:05. Leading the Rams was Davis, who took sixth place with a time of 16:33. Senior Amanda Dobbin was 11th in 16:55, with Charlton 16th in 17:22. Rounding out New Canaan’s scoring were Brannan, who was 18th in 17:28, and freshman Elizabeth Tedford, who was 20th in 17:31.
