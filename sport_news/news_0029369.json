A drum was wrongly packed with combustible materials at LANL, including organic kitty litter, and shipped to WIPP for eternal storage. However, a chemical reaction between waste materials and the litter caused the drum to be breached, contaminating the site and nearly two dozen workers above ground with low levels of radiation.\nThe U.S. Department of Energy has been working to clean the underground site and had said it might be reopened by March. But safety concerns and equipment issues this summer threatened to delay the reopening indefinitely and push the cost beyond its original half-billion-dollar estimate.\nEnergy Secretary Ernest Moniz now says WIPP “is on track to reopen by the end of next year,” according to a report in the Weapons Complex Monitor.\nBut the bad news is that as more waste is being generated at LANL, space to store it there is running out.\nAlthough a new $99 million facility at the lab to store transuranic waste – such as gloves, boots and other items from nuclear weapons work – should come on board in February, space is expected to run out sometime in Fiscal 2017, which runs from October 2016 through September 2017.\nOne of the issues at WIPP was a complacent mind-set that held “a radiation leak is virtually impossible.” And while safety should not be sacrificed as the DOE gets WIPP back in operation, the federal government and its contractors aren’t necessarily known for efficiency or alacrity.\nIn this case they should consider that time is of the essence.\nThis editorial first appeared in the Albuquerque Journal.
