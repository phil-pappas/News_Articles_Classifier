The Warriors improved their record to 6-1. \nAs has been the case most of the season, a large dose of Brady Brandsfield paved the way to victory. He was 19-33 through the air for 214 yards and two touchdowns. Devyn Pirkle was the recipient of seven tosses for 83 yards including both touchdowns. Tyler Schamel hauled in six passes for 65 yards. \nBrandsfield was a key cog in the rushing game as well, carrying the ball 14 times for 88 yards and two scores. Coby Klocko accounted for another Warrior touchdown while running for 117 yards on 16 carries. \nSonny Onken, who has been a stalwart all season for the Warriors defense, led the team in tackles with seven-and-a-half, including three for a loss. Orin Walters added five-and-a-half tackles and one for negative yards. A.J. Tabatabai had an interception and Zach Cook picked up an Oskaloosa fumble and returned it three yards for a score. \nNorwalk plays its final home game Friday night squaring off against A-D-M, Adel.
