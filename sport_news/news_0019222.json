In addition to birth months, the researchers had information on birth weight, the onset of puberty and adult height.\nChildren born during the summer were slightly heavier at birth than children born in the winter, the study authors found. Babies born in June, July, and August were taller as adults than winter babies, the research showed.\nGirls born in the summer were more likely to start puberty later, the study said. And, a later puberty has been linked to better adult health, the researchers noted.\nThe findings were published Oct. 12 in the journal Heliyon .\n\"When you were conceived and born occurs largely 'at random' -- it's not affected by social class, your parents' ages or their health -- so looking for patterns with birth month is a powerful study design to identify influences of the environment before birth,\" Perry said.\n\"This is the first time puberty timing has been robustly linked to seasonality. We were surprised, and pleased, to see how similar the patterns were on birth weight and puberty timing. Our results show that birth month has a measurable effect on development and health, but more work is needed to understand the mechanisms behind this effect,\" Perry said.\nHe added that the researchers think vitamin D exposure is important, and they hope their findings encourage other researchers to look at the long-term effects of early life vitamin D on puberty timing and health.\nMore information\nThe March of Dimes provides more on the long-term health effects of low birth weight .\nCopyright Â© 2015 HealthDay .
