(AP Photo/Michael Conroy) Sponsored Links \nMatt Hasselbeck and Adam Vinatieri celebrated their own throwback game on the field Sunday. \nAndrew Luck savored every minute of it — from the sideline. \nWith the injured Luck out, Hasselbeck, the Colts' 40-year-old quarterback, took Indianapolis on a 53-yard drive in overtime and set up Vinatieri for a 27-yard field goal and 16-13 win over Jacksonville — and a 15th consecutive win over AFC South foes. \nIndy (2-2) can break the NFL record set by the 1972-73 Miami Dolphins with a win Thursday night in Houston. \nVinatieri kicked three field goals, broke Mike Vanderjagt's franchise scoring record and became the first player in league history to top 1,000 points with two different teams. \nJaguars kicker Jason Myers could have won it in regulation with a 53-yarder, but he pushed it wide right. He had another chance to win it in overtime but that one went wide left from 48 yards. \nHasselbeck made his first start in nearly three years and managed the game deftly. He finished 30 of 47 with 282 yards, one touchdown and no interceptions. \nHe was at his sharpest on the final series, when he hooked up with Coby Fleener on 28-yard pass play, then fooled everyone with a bootleg that gained 4 yards. After Frank Gore ran for 1 yard, he broke the next one for 22. All Hasselbeck had to do then was position the ball in the middle of the field for Vinatieri's chip shot. \nThey didn't even need Luck, who was inactive because of an injured right shoulder, to save them. \nInstead, Luck spent most of the day coaching. Dressed in street clothes and a gray baseball hat, he clapped his hands, counseled teammates after plays and even handed water to Hasselbeck. And when Myers missed the 48-yarder, Luck pumped his fist. \nThat was all he could do. \nWithout him, Indy's old woes returned. \nAll they could get in the first half was a 54-yard field goal and 2-yard TD pass from Hasselbeck to Fleener. \nJacksonville matched that with a 20-yard field goal and an 8-yard TD pass from Blake Bortles to Allen Hurns. \nBortles then took the Jags 65 yards to set up Myers for a 32-yard field goal that made it 13-10 at halftime. \nIndy tied it at 13 when Vinatieri kicked a 32-yard field goal early in the fourth, and Hasselbeck had the Colts in position to retake the lead at the Jaguars 5. But Gore had the ball stripped on a second-and-goal run, and the Jags recovered in the end zone for a touchback. \nBortles finished 28 of 50 with 298 yards with one touchdown. T.J. Yeldon ran 22 times for 105 yards and Hurns finished with a career best 11 catches for 116 yards. \n___ \nAP NFL website: www.pro32.ap.org and www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WHIO-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T00:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T01:26:48.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
