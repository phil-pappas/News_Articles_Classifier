Unable to find a spot on the rail, Miller just pushed him forward. In the stretch, The Bank surged past Pinkman with strides left to win in 1:54 3/5. \n“Around the turn, (driver Yannick Gingras on Pinkman) was asking his horse and I was just sitting on mine.” Miller said. “He went a big trip.” \nIt was the fourth win in 16 starts for the son of Donato Hanover with earnings surpassing the $1-million mark. \nThe biggest upset of the night came in the $778,400 Two-Year-Old Colt Trot. Scorching early fractions and the failure of unbeaten favourite Control The Moment to fire his best shot in the stretch paved the way for a fast-closing Boston Red Rocks to produce an 18-1 upset in 1:51 3/5. \nDriven by Tim Tetrick for trainer Steve Elliott, the New Jersey-sired son of Rocknroll Hanover scored his third win in seven starts. Control The Moment had come into the race perfect in his first eight starts. \nThe $648,700 Three-Year-Old Filly pace produced the most stunning development of the evening when Mission Brief, sent off at 1-5 and having an easy time of it, went off stride in mid-stretch. That handed the win to Wild Honey in 1:54 3/5. \nDriven by John Campbell, Wild Honey was following Mission Brief then simply inherited the lead and the win after the favourite’s miscue. Trained by Jimmy Takter, Wild Honey is now seven of 14 this year for the ownership group that includes John and Jim Fielding of Toronto. \nOne of the more dominant wins of the evening went to All The Time, who captured the $778,440 Two-Year-Old Filly Trot. \nWith Yannick Gingras at the controls, the daughter of Muscle Hill took the lead as the field entered the backstretch. From there, the Takter pupil was clear the rest of the mile, winning by four lengths in 1:56 as the 6-5 favourite. It was the sixth win in 10 starts for All The Time, who is bred and owned by Marvin Katz of Toronto and Al Libfeld of Pickering. \nIn the $648,700 Three-Year-Old Filly Pace, Divine Caroline scored her fourth consecutive win and seventh in 20 starts this year, winning in 1:51. \nDriven by Dave Miller, the daughter of Rock N Roll Heaven was positioned in mid pack early. She found advancing cover briefly around the turn and in the stretch, had more than enough to get by Sassa Hanover and win by two lengths as the 3-5 favourite. \nJoe Holloway trains the New York-sired filly who approaches $800,000 in earnings. \nSouthwind Frank added to his impressive season with an easy win in the $778,440 Two-Year-Old Colt Trot. \nDriven by Gingras, the Ron Burke-trained son of Muscle Hill, worked his way to the lead going into the first turn. His job was made easier by the breaks of Lagerfeld and Tony Soprano as he was given a very easy middle half. Marion Marauder charged to finish second but was never closer than two lengths off Southwind Frank, who won in 1:54 2/5. \nAfter an early-season loss, Southwind Frank has won 11 races this season and has earned close to $900,000. \nIn the $778,440 Two-Year-Old Filly Pace, Pure Country remained perfect in her 10-race career, winning in 1:51 4/5. \nDriven by Brett Miller and sent off at the minimum odds of 1-9, the daughter of Somebeachsomewhere took the lead early in the backstretch and had to face a stiff challenge around the turn from Lyons River Pride. But she had more than enough to win by three lengths over Shezarealdeal. \nAnother of Takter’s training wins, the Pennsylvania-sired filly surpassed $750,000 in season earnings with the victory. \nIn the $324,350 Open Mare Trot, D One took the lead just before the half and had enough to hold off a mild late charge from Shake It Cerry to win in 1:54 2/5. \nMiller drove the five-year-old daughter of Donato Hanover, who is trained by Roger Walmann for Swedish-based owners. She was sent off as the 2-5 favourite off a dominant win at the 1:51 3/5 score at the Red Mile in her latest. The Crown triumph was her sixth win in eight starts in 2015.
