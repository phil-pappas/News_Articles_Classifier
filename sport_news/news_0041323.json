In partnership with the Seattle Mariners, Jackery provides portable battery chargers to in-stadium fans, helping them stay more connected and empowered during a game.\nThe program empowered the Mariners & Safeco Field sports stadiums to offer a new amenity for fans this season; the Jackery Mini, a small portable battery charger that keeps a fan’s cell phone charged through the length of a baseball game, enabling them to enjoy their in-stadium experience like never before.\n“It’s all about staying charged so fans can carry out the various activities they enjoy, like checking in-game stats online, watching in-game highlight videos and reviews in real time, as well as sharing their experience via social media, taking photos, and recording video clips for their friends,” says Jeh Lin, Vice President of Business Development and Corporate Success at Jackery. “You can literally send a text and get the Jackery charger delivered, right to your seat. Fans can also stop by the Jackery booth and get a charger for free.”\n“Lots of people who use Jackery lead active lifestyles and they’re taking their cell phones with them,” says Lin. “We noticed that many of our customers were sports fans, and specifically baseball fans. Since baseball is a sport that requires a longer game-time than many other sports, we wanted to partner with a baseball team, to start our program. We love working with the Mariners because they’re a team known for innovation, and Mariners fans are often more technically savvy and connected than most, and of course, they’re very passionate about going to a game, whenever possible.”\n“This is part of a growing trend among fans attending in-stadium baseball games,” says York Wu, CEO of Jackery. “Technology has become a larger part of the experience, both on and off the field. It connects people and gives them a way to be social. It’s like empowering ten thousand tiny broadcasters in the stands.”\n“Seattle is a connected city with lots of native technology users and innovators, and we believe Jackery is the type of customer-centric technology our fans expect from our in-ballpark experiences,” says Kevin Martinez, Seattle Mariners Vice President of Marketing. “The Mariners were early-adopters of social media and engage with fans throughout games on MarinersVision, our HD video screen. MLB offers a robust suite of features to fans through the At Bat and Ballpark apps as well as MLB.com including real-time stats, scores and video highlights of games in progress. Safeco Field offers free WiFi to fans. Fans need power to stay engaged with everything that is available during games. Fans expect to be connected. They want access to apps and social media. They’re streaming video highlights and checking scores.”\n“It’s all about supporting the fans,” says Wu. “This season, we’ve successfully combined two U.S. national pastimes; baseball and social media. After a long game, fans will now have enough battery power to get home, find food, call a friend, and listen to music. We’re helping people stay powered and connected, without worrying about running out of battery life.”\nAbout Jackery\nJackery mobile battery chargers go the distance.
