He’s only about 5-8, about 170 pounds.” \nMathew is also a 4.0 student at Mapletown and the combination of athleticism and academics garnered him the school’s fall sports male selection in the Centennial Chevrolet Scholar/Athlete Spotlight program. \nHe is a son of Jennie and Jeff Rush of Greensboro. Mathew is also the catcher for Mapletown’s baseball team. His younger brother, Dylan, is a sophomore tailback and the second baseman for the Maples baseball team. \n“I used to play at Albert Gallatin, my freshman and sophomore years,” Mathew Rush said. His father, whom Mathew lists as having the greatest influence on him as an athlete, coached at Albert Gallatin when Mathew played. “I started at middle linebacker both years. So this is my second year here at Mapletown and I like it a lot.” \nHaving experienced both a big school atmosphere at AG and the smallest of small schools at Mapletown, Rush said it’s easy to like the individual attention a smaller school can offer. \n“You get to know everybody in a small school,” Rush said. “You get to know what position they play, whether they play at all and most of the school comes out to watch the games, so it’s a big rush to play in front of your classmates and have them cheer you on.” \nHe has always been a good student and realizes the importance of maintaining good grades. \n“My favorite subject is math and I plan on studying to become a civil engineer,” Rush said. “I like math and I like building things, plus my uncle is a civil engineer.” \nAnd he hopes to play football in college, even if he can’t block for his younger brother. \n“I plan on playing football in college, but I have no idea yet where I will go,” Rush said. “I’ve been looking at a few schools, Robert Morris (Division I-AA) and Alderson-Broaddus (Division II). I’m hoping to play tight end on offense in college. I was a tight end last year, but our fullback graduated so I moved over there.” \nThus, the team player reference at the beginning. If he plays college football, Mathew likely would return to tight end, but he switched to fullback because he realized it would help the team. Yet, Rush is bright enough to know that engineering is his future, not playing football or any other sport. \n“Actually, I’m more concerned about my education than I am about sports, so I’ll pick a school based on its engineering program, not on whether I can play football there,” Rush said. \n“Both schools I’m looking at have good engineering programs.” \nNow that’s good planning.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T07:11:29.075+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
