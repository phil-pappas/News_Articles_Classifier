Tenafly’s players were ecstatic. \nNow they’re headed to the final of the Bergen County tournament. \nAndrew Hwang’s goal in double overtime lifted the No. 3 Tigers to a 4-3 win over 10th-seeded Northern Highlands on Saturday at Indian Hills. \nSeth Shachar had two goals for Tenafly, and Kevin Lopez added one. Lucas McGahren scored for Northern Highlands, Sam Moscowitz converted a penalty kick and Thomas McMahon scored with two minutes remaining in regulation to send the game into overtime. \nTenafly generated some chances in the first overtime, but Highlanders goalkeeper Jase Barrack came up with some outstanding saves to keep the score tied. \nBut the Tigers ended the game about three minutes into the second OT, when Shachar fed Hwang off a corner kick. \n“There was no one on me, and I just did it naturally, I just went for the ball,” Hwang said. “And we’re in the county finals.” \nIt’ll be Tigers’ first time in the final since 2005 and they’re looking for their first title since 1992, which came three years into Bill Jaeger’s first stint as coach. He stepped down in 2010, but returned before this season. \nJaeger said he told his team it could form its identity during the county tournament. So far, the Tigers have been resilient. Before Saturday’s overtime victory, they beat Ridgewood on penalty kicks in the first round and Garfield in overtime in the quarterfinals. \n“I think that was something that was very meaningful to us,” said Jaeger, who was Tenafly’s athletic director from 2011 through 2014. “Obviously we’re all interested in the state tournament. But I said, ‘This can be your identity.’ ” \nThe Highlanders, who beat No. 2 Bergen Tech in the quarterfinals, entered Saturday on an eight-game winning streak. \nSteve Every, in his first season as Northern Highlands’ coach after leading Indian Hills for 11 years, repeatedly told his players not to hang their heads. \n“We went ahead, they went ahead. We came back twice, played all the way to the end, showed a lot of character, poise and really played a great brand of soccer,” Every said. \nFor the Tigers, there’s more to accomplish. \n“Our team has been putting in a lot of work every practice,” Hwang said. “And we made it. We’re in the finals, so we’ve got to win it.” \nNo. 4 RAMAPO 5, No. 8 PASCACK VALLEY 0: Ramapo went on a scoring barrage to roll into the title game. Mark Walstead scored twice in the first half and Ramapo built its lead with goals from Justin Chi, Dylan Rocchio and Andrew Furman. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T06:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T18:21:53.594+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
