The Wings opted for Ouellet because he plays a smart, safe game, the kind needed opposite an offensive juggernaut such as Green.\n\"I have a pretty good idea of the way he plays,\" Ouellet said. \"I know he likes to skate with the puck, so my job is to get it to him in good conditions so he can have more time with it.\n\"Injuries are unfortunate, but it is something that happens, and it creates opportunity for a younger guy. It is our job to take the opportunity and make the best of it.\"\nOuellet is trying to make the Wings but is vulnerable because he can be sent down without waivers. Coach Jeff Blashill called Ouellet \"a very smart hockey player\" but didn't commit to the pairing for beyond one night.\nDETROIT FREE PRESS\nOuellet trying to get a foothold with Red Wings\nToday is only Green's second game of the exhibition season, as he had been dealing with a tender groin. Injuries aside, Green is relishing being with a new team after nearly a decade in Washington. It didn't hurt that, after today's morning skate, Wings legend Ted Lindsay came up and told Green how much he was looking forward to seeing Green play.\n\"I am over the moon with how things have gone,\" Green said.\nWith the season opener a week away, Green is eager to get fine-tuned.\n\"When you go to a new team, guys have certain things that you pick up on that they do really well, and you want to sort of emphasize that,\" Green said. \"My job is just to get the puck in the forwards' hands and let them do their work.\n\"It is just getting the system down and feeling good on the ice. Overall, everything has been so positive for myself.\"\nNew teammates are well aware of just how skilled Green is with the puck. But seeing him close up has offered a fresh pleasantry.\n\"I knew he had great vision and great hands before,\" forward Johan Franzen said, \"but he is a better skater than I knew he was. He can really fly out there, and he can take the puck up the ice and enter a zone, he has just got that natural skating ability. He is going to help us a lot.\"\nMore on DeKeyser: Blashill played up the depth of the organization as being able to offset the loss of DeKeyser even as Blashill acknowledged how important DeKeyser is to the lineup. \"Danny has become an elite top-two defenseman in the NHL,\" Blashill said. \"With that said, one thing we have here is organizational depth. The one thing I never worry about is who we don't have available to us. All I ever worry about is who is available to us.\"\nThe Wings have had several dinged defensemen, but Blashill said Kyle Quincey and Jakub Kindl could both play Saturday. Alexey Marchenko is doubtful. Quincey is a top candidate to play with Green, because Quincey is also a good safety-net guy. \"Quincey did a great as a top-four d-man last year,\" Blashill said. \"He is somebody we feel comfortable playing in those roles.\"\nDeKeyser was injured during the third period of Wednesday's victory at Pittsburgh , when he got caught up against the boards and had to wrestle his foot free. Recovery times generally run to the longer side of the equation, especially with an injury that disables a player from skating or biking. Realistically, DeKeyser probably won't be back before November.\n\"He is one of our top guys, so obviously, it is a big loss,\" Franzen said. \"He is really good at coming back and getting pucks out of corners and a really good skater and passer. Big loss for us.\"\nNotes: Darren Helm skated for the first time since suffering a concussion and separated shoulder two weeks ago. He could be ready by opening weekend. ... Evgeny Svechnikov agreed to terms on a three-year entry-level contract. ... Tom McCollum cleared waivers.\nContact Helene St. James: hstjames@freepress.com.
