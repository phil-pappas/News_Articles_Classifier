Luckily for us we were able to respond. The defense stood up and made a lot of plays when they needed to and the offense got rolling again just enough. If we want to have a chance to get better and continue to win games we are going to have to play better.” Holland, who had missed two of the Knights’ previous three games, rushed for 303 yards on 38 carries and scored all four of the Knights’ touchdowns. “He is back healthy now,” Hudler said. “We are trying to protect him. He took a lot of hits early on in the season.” South Beauregard ended a two-game losing streak despite turning the ball over twice on fumbles in the first half. After forcing the Knights to punt on the opening drive, Westlake marched 60 yards on seven plays to take a 7-0 lead on an eight-yard pass from Hunter Racca to Michael Boudreaux with 6:02 left in the first quarter. South Beauregard fumbled the ball away on the ensuing kickoff and the Rams got to the Knights’ two-yard line before Racca pass on a fake field goal attempt on fourth down sailed past the out stretched arms of Brayden Winn. South Beauregard got to mid field on their next drive but fumbled the ball again and Westlake pushed their lead to 14-0 with 10:29 left in the first half on a 25-yard pass from Racca to Joseph January but unfortunately the lead didn’t stick. “I feel bad for these kids,” Westlake head coach Phil Fontenot said. “They know that we always talk about it takes time to turn a program around but doggone it we were close tonight. “The kids fought. It doesn’t have anything to do with Xs and Os. It has everything to do with heart and I am very proud of them for having heart tonight.” South Beauregard trailed 14-6 at halftime, but just under three minutes into the second half, Holland scored on a four-yard run and ran in the two-point conversion to tie the game at 14-14. The drive started after Marshall Larocque intercepted Racca with 10:50 left in the third quarter. Westlake got the lead back one more time, 17-14, on a 31-yard field goal by Jonathan Peshoff with 2:40 left in the third. Page 2 of 2 - It took the Knights just over two and a half minutes to take back the lead, 21-17, for good on a 17-yard run by Holland with nine seconds left in the third quarter. Trailing 27-17, Westlake put together a 10-play, 70 yard drive capped by a 19-yard touchdown on a reverse by January to pull within three, 27-24, with 6:58 left in the game. Westlake forced the Knights to punt with 3:27 left lost four yards on their next drive and turned the ball over on downs with 1:35 left. Westlake (2-6, 1-2) will travel to Jennings (4-4, 2-1) on Friday while South Beauregard (6-2, 1-2) will host Iowa (4-4, 2-1) on Friday.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T21:30:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T22:34:52.410+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
