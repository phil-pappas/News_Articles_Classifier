Staff photo by Kathryn Ingall slideshow WOODSTOCK — No. 10 Etowah rode a 28-point first half and a four-touchdown performance by Tyray Devezin to a 38-28 win over Lassiter on homecoming night Friday. Devezin’s four scores were part of his 228 yards on 18 carries. He also caught two passes for 30 yards. The game’s key moment came as Lassiter (3-4, 1-4) trailed 21-7 early in the second quarter. The Trojans punted and, after Etowah (7-1, 5-1) muffed the punt, appeared to have recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchdown that would have made it a one-score game. But after a brief conference, the officiating crew ruled that the play was a touchback, and Etowah took over possession.On its second chance, Etowah drove down the field and scored on a 42-yard run by Devezin. What could have been a one-score advantage for the Eagles became a 28-7 lead. “The rule is pretty clear,” Etowah coach Dave Svehla said. “If you muff a scrimmage kick and it goes into the end zone, it’s a touchback. We never possessed the punt, so we got the ball at the 20. I’ve seen that happen before, but what I was proud of is that we took the ball 80 yards, and we were as physical as we’ve been all year.”Etowah’s physicality showed up on defense as well, as the Eagles sacked Lassiter quarterback Cooper Cross five times and shut down the Trojans’ passing attack for most of the first half. Cross connected with receiver Cole Taylor for a 33-yard touchdown pass on the first possession of the game for a 7-0 lead. Cross went 4-for-6 for 57 yards on the drive, but for the rest of the first half, Etowah held him to 6-of-14 passing for 26 yards. Taylor led Lassiter with 163 yards and three touchdowns on eight catches. Devezin’s touchdown runs went for 71, 2, 4, and 42 yards. On the first play of the third quarter, fellow tailback Trey Moore added a 71 yard touchdown run of his own, putting the Eagles ahead 35-7 for what seemed like an easy win. But later in the half, Cross again connected with Taylor for touchdowns of 85 yards and 16 yards, making the contest closer than it seemed destined to be. “Lassiter is a good football team, and if we can come out of here with a win, I’m happy about that,” Svehla said. “They’re not going to quit. They’re coached well, and they’re going to keep playing to the end. I expect them to do that, and I expect our team to do it as well.”Lassiter coach Jep Irwin said it was a matter of improvement after halftime.“We had fewer sacks, we caught the ball better, we executed (in the second half),” Irwin said. “That’s the issue for us — being able to execute. When we execute, we score.”With the loss, Lassiter was virtually eliminated from playoff contention, despite showing significant improvement from its 2014 performance. Etowah got a boost to its chances for a playoff berth and remained in the hunt for a first-round home game. The Eagles will head into their second bye week before hosting Wheeler on Oct. 30.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T10:38:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T14:14:24.936+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
