Fortunately he had plenty of space to operate in the Z Max Dragway parking lot. \n\"You felt the tight turning in the steering wheel and they have a lot of horsepower,\" Weinhart said. \"That's the thing about these cars.\" \nBut if you're a diehard racing fan who wants to be in the seat itself, Weinhart says you have to sign up. \n\"I have a great job, because you ask somebody how it was and they say 'awesome,'\" Weinhart said. \nThe experience is offered periodically here in Charlotte; Weinhart says the next one is in November.
