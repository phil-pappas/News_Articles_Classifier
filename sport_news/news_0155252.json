He now joins Carlos Delgado as being the only two players in club history to have logged three or more seasons with 40 home runs -- no other Jay has managed two. \nSince 2010, Bautista leads the major leagues with 227 homers, which is 29 more than second-place Miguel Cabrera of Detroit. Bautista also joins Alex Rodriguez , Albert Pujols , Ryan Howard and David Ortiz as the only active players who have had at least three 40-homer seasons. \nOf his 40 homers, 33 have been hit since June 1 which is tied for second in the majors. Bautista also has hit 23 homers since the all-star break, which is third-best in the bigs. He ended September with nine homers in 26 games, second to Chris Davis of Baltimore, who banged out 10. \nJosh Donaldson leads the Jays with 41 home runs and combined with Bautista they are just the third duo in club history to hit 40 homers in a season -- the others being Delgado and Shawn Green in 1999, and Delgado and Tony Batista in 2000. They are also the first duo to accomplish the feat since Jermaine Dye (44) and Jim Thome (42) did it with the White Sox in 2006. \nWHAT'S THIS BUMP? \nThe Jays went to their 'B' list of relievers in the game on Thursday, which meant that Chad Jenkins fans actually got to see him pitch. \nJenkins has been among the September call-ups, arriving when the Jays had the doubleheader in New York Sept. 12. He has stuck around ever since but hadn't been anywhere close to the mound until Thursday, when he was called into action for the sixth and seventh innings. \nThe last time Jenkins appeared in any game before Thursday was on Sept. 4 in a start for the Buffalo Bisons. \nIt's amazing he found the mound. \nNOTHING LIKE HOME \nThe Jays, of course, are in a fight with Kansas City for the best record in the AL which would give the Jays the home field advantage in every series. \nIt would also have them facing the winner of the wild-card game in the division series, and that has the advantage of not having to face the wild-card team's ace until Game 3 of the series. It's worth winning for all that, plus the boost the Jays have been getting from their fan base. \n\"Home field for us with the environment we have at that stadium, and I've talked to other GMs, everybody across the league is talking about what an unbelievable environment it is, to have a dome, playing conditions, all that, I think it's a big advantage for us,\" GM Alex Anthopoulos said. \"We'd love to get it, we're certainly going to fight for it, but you do balance it out with having to give guys rest.\" \nWE'RE NO. 1 \nA lot of chest-thumping came out of the bedlam within the Blue Jays clubhouse Wednesday night. However, some voices resonated more than others. Russell Martin has been with three other organizations that have been to the playoffs and he thinks this Jays team is the best he has been on. \n\"This is the best I've felt going into the post-season,\" Martin said. \"We're dangerous offensively, we're dangerous on the mound, we play awesome defence. If somebody's going to beat us, they're going to have to play tremendously well. And even then I don't know if it can happen. The confidence feels pretty good right now.\" \nTake that!", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T06:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:25:58.436+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
