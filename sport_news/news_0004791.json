(Photo: Johanna Coyne) CONNECT 9 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nThe on-field strategic formula to El Diamante's long string of success under coach Mark Rogers is rather straight-forward — game-controlling power running attack coupled with sound fundamental defense. \nAnd it was that exact brand of football that vaulted the El Diamante Miners to a 28-14 win over the Redwood Rangers on Friday night at Giant Chevrolet-Cadillac Mineral King Bowl. Prep Football Week 9 \nThe numbers produced weren't of the video-game variety, but they depicted El Diamante's dominance: \n• The Miners (4-4, 2-2) rushed the ball 55 times for 227 yards. El Diamante only had two possessions in the first half, but scored both times to build a 14-7 halftime lead. Those two drives took up 32 plays. \n• El Diamante enjoyed a 2-1 edge over Redwood in time of possession, owning the ball for 32 minutes. The Miners ran 65 plays to the Redwood's 34. \n• El Diamante limited Redwood to 147 yards of offense and forced two turnovers. The first turnover led to a touchdown in the middle of the third quarter that put the Miners up 21-7. Rangers were 0-of-3 on 3rd-down conversion tries in the second half, and 0-for-2 on fourth downs. \nThis was El Diamante football at its best, right? \n\"That pretty much hits it on the nose,\" Rogers said. \"We're starting to play our brand of football. We're hitting our stride. We're peaking at the right time of the year.\" \nThe engine behind El Diamante's power run game on Friday was senior running back Keylan Liles. Liles, who's been battling an injury for most of the season, demonstrated why he's considered one of the top players in the Tulare-Kings counties area. \nLiles carried the ball 40 times for 199 yards and two touchdowns. \n\"It feels good to come back and get the 'W'. This was a big rivalry game, and we wanted to get this one. Total team effort,\" Liles said. \nFor someone trying to come back from a leg injury, 40 carries seems to be an almost punitive-type load. But that's the way Liles and the Miners wanted. \n\"I wanted to get the record of 43 carries in a single game. I didn't get it, but that's OK. We got the win,\" Liles said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T09:14:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T12:09:30.216+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
