Uber has contended that its role was connecting private contractors with customers, but the regulatory stance adopted in California and Oregon could mean the drivers are eligible for new benefits and protections under Oregon law.\nAvakian said that although Uber drivers use their own vehicles and set their own hours, the company maintains complete control over the rates drivers can charge and the technological infrastructure.\nThe ruling didn't mention other companies in the so-called \"gig economy,\" where a network of workers provide generally unskilled labor on demand, usually facilitated through an online marketplace. But it could have ramifications for other start-ups with similar business models, like the ride-sharing firm Lyft and the grocery delivery service Instacart.\nThis post will be updated.\n-- Elliot Njus\nenjus@oregonian.com\n503-294-5034\n@ enjus", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/enjus"], "published": "2015-10-14T17:35:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T20:16:35.306+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
