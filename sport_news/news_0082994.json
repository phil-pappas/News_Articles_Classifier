Hours after External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj addressed the UN General Assembly yesterday, Pakistan exercised its Right of Reply, alleging India was using the “terrorism bogey” to stall dialogue. Swaraj, in her address, had said instead of the four-point peace initiative proposed by Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, it should address just “one issue” of giving up terrorism. She made it clear that terrorism emanating from Pakistan is hampering normalisation of bilateral ties as she underlined that “talks and terror cannot go together”. However, Pakistan blamed India for the unrest and terror on its soil, saying it has handed over to UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon dossiers in this regard. Counselor in Pakistan’s Permanent Mission to the UN Bilal Ahmad said the dossiers include details of alleged “Indian interference and support for terrorism in Balochistan and Karachi as well as its security and intelligence agencies’ link with the Tehrik-e-Taliban especially in FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas)”. “Using the terrorism bogey, India has not only stalled the bilateral dialogue but also vitiated the overall atmosphere between the two countries,” he alleged. “The core issue of Jammu and Kashmir cannot be cast aside by empty rhetoric. It has been and will always be on top of the agenda of any talks between India and Pakistan. “...It is therefore disingenuous of India to ignore the serious peace initiative proposed by the Prime Minister of Pakistan from this august forum,” he said. He informed the UN General Assembly that Pakistan has yesterday handed over to the UN Secretary-General dossiers containing, what it called, “evidence” of alleged Indian involvement. A day after Sharif raked up the Kashmir issue at the UN, Swaraj used the same forum to raise the issue of “illegal occupation of parts of the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir” by Pakistan and said terror attacks from there were engineered to legitimise it. “We do not need four points, we need just one - give up terrorism and let us sit down and talk,” Swaraj had said in her 25-minute speech before the 193-member body. India-Pak ties have hit a rough patch particularly after cancellation of what would have been the first-ever NSA-level talks in August following differences over the agenda proposed by Islamabad, and a planned meeting between Kashmiri separatists and Pakistan’s National Security Adviser Sartaj Aziz. — PTI", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T00:25:50.191+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
