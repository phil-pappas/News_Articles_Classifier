It was at the Mill that Hobgood and singer Kurt Elling forged their partnership, both eventually moving to New York, then splitting up abruptly at the end of 2013.\nSo Hobgood's weekend engagement leading his new trio represented a meaningful return for him.\n\"Man, it's nice to be home,\" he told the audience, to high-decibel response. \"This will always be my jazz home.\"\nSure sounded like it during his first set, Hobgood bringing considerable ardor to music from \"Honor Thy Fathers.\" If the album, with drummer Kendrick Scott and bassist John Patitucci, represents Hobgood's trio work at its most polished and controlled, the concert performance with drummer Jared Schonig and bassist Matt Clohesy leaned toward viscerally exciting, rhythmically propulsive music-making.\nPianist Laurence Hobgood steps into spotlight Howard Reich Anyone who has heard Laurence Hobgood already knows that he's one of the most accomplished jazz pianists working today.\nBut the melodic urgency, tonal sheen and improvisational creativity of his art have reached an apex with \"Honor Thy Fathers,\" a trio album that won't be released until early next...\nAnyone who has heard Laurence Hobgood already knows that he's one of the most accomplished jazz pianists working today.\nBut the melodic urgency, tonal sheen and improvisational creativity of his art have reached an apex with \"Honor Thy Fathers,\" a trio album that won't be released until early next...\n(Howard Reich) Or perhaps the electricity of the occasion and Hobgood's eagerness to perform in a valued setting explained the intensity of the proceedings. Whatever the reason, Hobgood and friends clearly came to make a point and did so emphatically.\nThough the evening began with a hush in the album's closing tune, Hobgood's \"Shirakumo No Michi (White Cloud Way),\" his delicately stated introductory passages soon gave way to full-throttle playing. Drummer Schonig and bassist Clohesy sounded as fiercely committed to this music as Hobgood, the three musicians showing a sonic cohesiveness that belied the freshness of the venture. Together they conjured power without noise, energy without haste, drama without overstatement.\nAs its title implies, \"Honor They Fathers\" represents Hobgood's salute to those who have influenced him, either through love (his father) or music (his teachers and jazz heroes). The aforementioned \"Shirakumo\" emerged as Hobgood's homage to master composer Wayne Shorter, while Hobgood's \"Triptych\" stood as a complex, oft-profound tribute to the late University of Illinois music professor Salvatore Martirano. The perpetual inventiveness of Hobgood's right-hand lines in this work and the profusion of its musical incidents made this one of the more substantial performances of the evening.\nHobgood's arrangement of the chestnut \"Poinciana\" was cut from the album, but you didn't have to hear his commentary to realize he was tipping his hat to a piano giant who similarly launched his international career in Chicago, Ahmad Jamal. Somehow Hobgood captured the rhythmically airborne quality of Jamal's classic recording (and uncounted subsequent performances) without attempting to mimic Jamal's other musical signatures. Instead, Hobgood produced exquisitely detailed right-hand filigree, backed by the muscular sound and rhythmic tension of Schonig's drums.\nYou have to admire a pianist who's willing to take on \"Que Sera, Sera (Whatever Will Be, Will Be)\" at this late date. The tune may not be a masterpiece, but singer Doris Day turned the melody into something radiant with her hit recording long ago. Hobgood's ultra-slow version (perhaps for a future \"Honor Thy Mothers\" album?) made a lullaby of the piece, his legato lines answered by a soulful solo from bassist Clohesy.\nThe most important takeaway from this occasion, though, was not so much the persuasiveness of Hobgood's pianism or the musicality of his arrangements, which are well-known, but the alacrity of this trio. Just as \"Honor Thy Fathers\" can be considered Hobgood's strongest recording to date, this band may provide his best musical forum yet, opening a major new chapter in his career.\nWe'll see next year.\nHoward Reich is a Tribune critic.\nThe Laurence Hobgood Trio plays at 8 p.m. Saturday at the Green Mill Jazz Club, 4802 N.
