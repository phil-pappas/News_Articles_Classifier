It is obvious that as the average age of the top players rises, they are less likely to be able to make it through an 11-month season. So should the WTA rethink this championship and end the year after China or even before? I have always maintained, albeit as an avid fan who would watch tennis for 12 months, that we are damaging the careers of the young ones and pressuring the older ones to retire with this long season. But then again, how wonderful it would be if one Venus star was to rise above all….What do you think?\n— Natalie, Kingston, Jamaica\n• Eventually tennis will learn that less is sometimes more. That scarcity of product is an asset. That sometimes you’re better passing up money in short term for a gain in the long term. As it stands, this Asian swing should require a “viewer discretion” rating. Player after player is retiring mid-match with one injury or another. (And the panoply of injuries is truly cause for concern.) Maria Sharapova has essentially shut it down for the year. And, oh, yes, so has Serena Williams. You wonder if these Asian events aren't experiencing some serious buyers’ remorse, having shelled out millions for depleted, exhausted fields and daily results featuring retirements.\nTennis Mailbag: Murray's ATP Finals-Davis Cup situation, racket-smashing, more by Jon Wertheim", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/jon_wertheim", "https://twitter.com/jon_wertheim"], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:01:27.640+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
