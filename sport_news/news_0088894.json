But Taylor has complained that prison officials in both Oregon and Colorado -- where he is incarcerated on an interstate exchange -- have violated his constitutional rights by doing nothing to prevent the situation.\nThe appeals court noted that Taylor was sentenced to the Oregon Department of Corrections, is still technically in the custody of Oregon and deserves to have Oregon look into his complaint because of the \"serious, immediate, and ongoing health hazard\" posed.\nJed Peterson -- the Portland attorney who represented Taylor on appeal -- applauded Wednesday's ruling for reinforcing inmates' rights to humane living conditions.\n\"Just because you're in custody, you still have rights not to be subjected to cruel and unusual punishment, and not to have feces and urine thrown at you,\" Peterson said.\nAlthough details of Taylor's crimes that landed him in prison weren't available, Taylor was sentenced to a life term with a 30-year minimum in 1993 for aggravated murder and robbery in Columbia County. He served 14 years in Oregon, before he became widely known for -- according to Snake River Correctional Facility officials -- stabbing Oregon City child killer and fellow inmate Ward Weaver with a homemade shank while giving Weaver a haircut in 2007.\nAt some point after that, Taylor was transferred to the Colorado prison system for reasons that the appeals court ruling doesn't explain.\nAfter Taylor said Colorado prison were brushing off his complaints about inmates targeting him with their excrement, he turned to the Oregon Department of Corrections director, Colette Peters , to move him out of his \"dangerous and harmful living situation.\"\nPeters' office contended that because Taylor was physically locked up in a different state, they couldn't or wouldn't hear his case and offer him relief from his living conditions. Marion County Circuit Judge Courtland Geyer sided with Oregon prison officials in dismissing Taylor's plea to Oregon.\nNow that the appeals court has ruled, a Marion County judge will have to hear Taylor's proof that his cell indeed is being bombarded with human waste. If the judge determines Taylor's reports are accurate, Oregon prison officials will have to take action to remedy the situation.\nWednesday's ruling was made by a three-judge panel: Rebecca Duncan, Erin Lagesen and Meagan Flynn.\nRead the opinion here .\n-- Aimee Green\nagreen@oregonian.com\n503-913-4197\no_aimee", "external_links": ["http://www.twitter.com/o_aimee"], "published": "2015-10-22T00:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T16:19:42.951+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
