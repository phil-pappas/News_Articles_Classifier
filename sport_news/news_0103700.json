In other words, they’re looking more like their mother.\nEr Shun, a female giant panda on loan from China, gave birth to her cubs early last Tuesday at the Toronto Zoo.\nCynthia Shipley, of the Toronto Zoo, said the twin cubs are still in a critical stage of growth and the Zoo remains cautious because of their immaturity.\nBut Shipley said Er Shun gives them confidence in the cubs’ survival. “She’s an amazing mother, she is doing everything right,” she said.\nWhile their eyes remain closed, the twin babies are wiggling and becoming more vocal and active with their mother. Both cubs are receiving proper nursing and suckling from Er Shun, who continues to show strong maternal instincts through cradling and other forms of bonding.\nPandas are notoriously difficult to mate, which lead the Toronto Zoo to artificially inseminate Er Shun on May 13. The successful birth is considered a major triumph because pandas are considered one of the most difficult animals to breed.\nThe Zoo said it will be four to five months before the twin cubs will be on display for the public.
