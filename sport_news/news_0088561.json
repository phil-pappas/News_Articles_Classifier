The two have a combined record of 22-6 and both are in the top three contenders of the welterweight division.\nWhen the two meet on Saturday in Houston at UFC 192, they'll be vying for a title shot against the winner of Robbie Lawler-Carlos Condit at UFC 195. Condit leapfrogged both Hendricks and Woodley after he KO'd Thiago Alves in May. Condit had lost to Woodley at UFC 171 and Hendricks at UFC 158.\nHendricks on Wednesday weighed in on both he and Woodley being passed up for a fight with current champion Robbie Lawler.\n\"I'm going to call for what I want, but I'm not going to trash talk,\" he said. \"I'm just going to say, 'Why does [Carlos] Condit get a title shot? We both beat him. Instead, we're not both getting a title shot. We both beat him and he beat a top 12 guy. He was 12th. I've been fighting top five guys for the last three years.\"\nWoodley isn't mulling over the fact that he doesn't have a title shot.\n\"He's the No. 1 fighter in the world,\" he said of Hendricks. \"I could fight a sub-top 10 fighter and put on a great performance and get the title shot. But I'm old school. I feel like you've got to earn it. He's my toughest matchup...\n\"I'm just treating this as a mini title shot. He's been a world champion, he's been in three title fights. Two of his losses were really close. Every single fight that he's lost has been close [and] a split decision. He can almost argue that he could be undefeated with a different set of judges. I'm taking this very seriously. I'm not thinking ahead. I'm not thinking about what's after. I'm thinking about Saturday.\"\nOnce the two do get into the octagon, Hendricks said he could see two different versions of Woodley.\n\"In a lot of his fights he's either a really aggressive fighter or he's a very defensive fighter,\" he said. \"So when we were going through our training camp, we sorta had to train for two different Tyron's because we don't know which one is going to show up. I have a feeling of which one is going to show up; the one that is going to be very aggressive.\"\nWoodley disagreed with Hendricks.\n\"I think it's great that he sees different versions, but the version that is coming out Saturday is one that he hasn't seen,\" he said. \"I don't think he can prepare for it.\"\nIt is presumed that the winner of this bout will get the next crack at Lawler. But Hendricks has seen himself be passed over before.\n\"If I get a knockout and don't I don't get the damn title shot then I'll be pissed. That's when I'll really be pissed,\" he said.\nFollow Joshua Friemel on Twitter at @Josh_Friemel .\nOn Twitter:\n @Josh_Friemel", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel", "https://twitter.com/Josh_Friemel"], "published": "2015-10-02T10:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T13:12:02.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
