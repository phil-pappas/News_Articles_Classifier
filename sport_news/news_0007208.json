The extra point tied the score at seven midway through the quarter. \nA pair of sacks would end the Cardinals next two offensive possessions but there was nothing that the Pompton Lakes defense could do to stop the Bears attack as Hawthorne jumped ahead 19-7 midway through the fourth quarter. \nA long return by Cole Harriet coupled with a personal foul on Hawthorne gave the Cardinals the ball at midfield after the third Hawthorne touchdown. \nAfter another Hawthorne penalty moved the ball to the Bears 35-yard line the Cardinals quickly went in the wrong decision. \nA holding penalty cost the Cardinals 16 yards as they went from a first and ten at the 12 yard line to a second and 23 at the Bears' 25 yard line. \nThe Cardinals would eventually be facing a fourth and 19 from the 21 but they were able to convert as Cotter hit Nick Posimato on a post pattern. \nThe junior receiver made a spectacular catch and with the extra point the Cardinals were within 19-14. \nThe Bears were able to move into Pompton Lakes side of the field on their ensuing drive but the Cardinals held firm and forced Hawthorne to turn the ball over on downs giving the Cardinals one last chance to go for the win. \nThe chance would go for naught as the Bears defense did not give up a first down and they were able to run out the clock. \n\"We had our shot, it just came up a little short,\" said Mahoney. \"It should not have gotten to that point but it has two games in a row. When we break through that little area then the attitude changes and we have to figure out a way to break through that.\" \nPompton Lakes (2-2) will now have to refocus as they prepare to host Palisades Park next Saturday at 1:00 p.m. \n\"We don't control any destiny at this point we just control what we do next week,\" said Mahoney. \nEmail: costelloj@northjersey.com © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T07:16:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T15:56:30.693+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
