If not, the Rams could be looking at a long day against the 25th-ranked Broncos. ( Eli Lucero / THE HERALD JOURNAL ) \nColorado State (2-3, 0-1 MW) vs. No. 25 Boise State (4-1, 1-0) \nSaturday, 5 p.m., Hughes Stadium \nBroadcast — TV: CBS Sports Network; Radio: 105.5 FM \nFrom the Rams — Colorado State heads into the game looking healthier than it has in a few weeks, as guards Fred Zerblis and Zack Golditch are on the mend, along with tight end Nolan Peralta and fullback Nu'uvali Fa'apito — the latter two the Rams are hoping can play. It would help a run game that stalled last week at Utah State. \nFrom the Broncos — Three straight weeks of wins of scoring 50 or more points has the Broncos back in the rankings, a place they lost after a loss to BYU, a game in which BSU blew a fourth-quarter lead. The loss of QB Ryan Finley hasn't hurt them, as true freshman Brett Rypien has come in and played well. \nWhat to expect — Boise State is playing well right now, and Colorado State hasn't shown a consistency yet this season. The Rams will have to play an extremely clean game to remain in contention. Prediction: BSU 45, CSU 17 \nFORT COLLINS — The task at hand is obvious. \nBoise State comes to Lubick Field at Hughes Stadium on Saturday (5 p.m.; CBS Sports Network) ranked 25th in the country and is the defending Mountain West champion. \nThe Broncos are 4-1, already own a win in conference play and are paced by — choose one or the other — an offense that has scored at least 52 points in each of its past three games or a defense with two shutouts in the past three weeks, allowing just 14 points in that stretch to Virginia. \nFormidable, yes. But Colorado State coach Mike Bobo said the toughest test of all is much closer to home. \nThe Rams themselves. \n\"I think it's us,\" Bobo said, his team 2-3 overall, 0-1 in MW play entering the game. \"We talked about it on Monday that we're our own worst enemy. We've got to handle ourselves, we've got to worry bout the little things and correct what we can correct. We know Boise's good. We know they're good on offense, we know they're good on defense, good on special teams. We've got to become consistently good at all three phases, and that's what this week's been about, trying to get to that point.\" \nColorado State has yet to get there in any of the five games they've played. The Rams have won the turnover battle just once this season — against UTSA — the one game in which they didn't turn over the ball. Boise State has feasted of teams making mistakes. \nThe mistakes go beyond that for Colorado State, however. It is among the most-penalized teams in the nation, both in terms of flags thrown and yardage lost due to the infractions. Then there are the assignment busts, be they on offense or defense. \nThose on defense are often more obvious and have led to quarterbacks in the past two games running wild against the CSU defense. Last week, Utah State had eight explosive runs (gains of 15 yards or more) in a 33-18 victory, running for 298 yards. \n\"It's all about us,\" linebacker Kevin Davis said. \"Like I said, the couple of games we have lost have been little things or a couple of plays. If we eliminate those big plays, the big passes over the top and we play our runs and fits right, we'll have a good game.\" \nThe Rams, in spurts, have shown what is possible. They have held the lead in every game so far, but the issue has been being consistent with the play in all three phases, allowing three games to slip away from them, two resulting in overtime losses. \nThe running game that was so effective against Minnesota and Colorado was nonexistent last week, putting pressure on quarterback Nick Stevens. The fourth quarter against Utah State was one long passing down for the Rams, and the Aggies teed up the pass rush. \nThe thinking in the locker room is the Broncos provide the perfect motivation to put it all together. \n\"I think it's a great opportunity for this team and this offense to really show what we can do,\" said Stevens, who through five starts is completing just 55.5 percent of his passes while throwing for 1,129 yards with 10 touchdowns and five interceptions. \"I think we've just got to be able to move the ball on them, stop them on defense and execute on special teams and we'll prove we're a Mountain West worthy team.\" \nA year ago, both teams won at least 10 games, two of four programs from the Mountain Division to do so. CSU went to Boise State the second week last year hoping to prove it was ready to challenge for the title, only to come away with a 37-24 loss. \nSaturday, the Rams have to be more internally focused on proving they can actually play a clean, disciplined game. As Bobo said, they really have no other choice. \n\"I don't want to say we've got to play a perfect game, but we've got to play a sound game to have a chance to be in the game in the fourth quarter,\" Bobo said. \"That's what we're trying to do, play sound, have a chance in the fourth quarter and take our chances. If we're not sound and not disciplined, it's going to be a long night at Hughes.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T01:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T01:41:49.243+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
