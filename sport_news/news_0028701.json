The reason for his second technical was a bit unusual.\nIn the video, it appears as though Paul said, \"I got two kids of my own; don't talk to me like I'm a little kid.\" And that was the end of the night for the Clippers point guard.\nChris Paul does not want you to talk to him like he's a kid pic.twitter.com/8FruIdvDJ1\n— Becca Laurie, PI (@imbeccable) October 21, 2015\nThis isn't the first time Paul has gotten upset about being treated like a kid on the court. A few years ago, Paul got mad at then-Los Angeles Lakers forward Pau Gasol for \"sonnin'\" him, which means putting your hand on someone's head like you would a child's.\nIn case it wasn't clear then, it certainly is now—Paul doesn't appreciate being treated like a kid.\n[ Twitter ]\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/imbeccable/status/656686121510899712", "http://bleacherreport.com/", "http://bleacherreport.com/pau-gasol", "https://t.co/8FruIdvDJ1", "http://bleacherreport.com/chris-paul", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=19yIuC1MrbM", "http://nba.nbcsports.com/2012/09/19/chris-paul-still-pissed-about-pau-gasols-pat-on-the-head/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T10:05:14.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
