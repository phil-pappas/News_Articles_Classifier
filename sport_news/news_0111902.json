Ryan McDonagh has the most time at 3:14 on five shifts while Keith Yandle has been out for 2:25 on four turns. Kevin Klein has gotten 1:57 on three shifts, Boyle 1:31 on two turns.\nThe Blueshirts have used eight forwards, with Stepan (2:56 on four shifts) and Rick Nash (2:41 on four) leading in ice time. Derick Brassard (2:30), Chris Kreider (2:11), Kevin Hayes (2:08) and Mats Zuccarello (2:03) have all gotten three shifts while J.T. Miller (1:12) has been out twice and Oscar Lindberg once, against Philadelphia, for 33 seconds.\n“We’ve worked at it and we’ve talked a lot about philosophies,” Vigneault said. “We’ve discussed it with our guys in the American League and the coaches in the American League who played it [last year].\n“I would say that generally we would go with two forwards and one defenseman, but there might be times where we might be able to set up an offensive zone faceoff play with three forwards.”\nStalberg, who suffered a presumed concussion on the unpenalized blow he took from Radko Gudas with 1:06 to go in Saturday’s second period, was sidelined on Sunday and replaced in the lineup by Emerson Etem.\nThere was neither a penalty called against nor supplemental discipline applied to the Flyers’ defenseman for the check that caught a reaching Stalberg in the chin.\n“Viktor is feeling better,” Vigneault said. “It’s day by day.”\nJarret Stoll, 5-0 at the dots, has won 21 of 26 draws over the last three games and an off-the-charts 40 of 61 (.656) on the year.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T03:40:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T12:57:06.712+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
