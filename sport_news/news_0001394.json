Earlier on Wednesday, Eagles coach Chip Kelly said Alonso was in Florida to see Dr. James Andrews about a second opinion on his ACL, and that Alonso wouldn’t return until Friday.\nAndrews performed the surgery on Alonso’s ACL last summer. But Alonso sprained, or partially tore, the ligament in the Eagles’ second game against Dallas. The Philadelphia Daily News reported that Andrews was going to perform arthroscopic surgery Wednesday.\nThe results showed that Alonso doesn’t need reconstructive surgery, and therefore won’t miss a second consecutive season. Alonso played for the Buffalo Bills his first two seasons before the Eagles traded running back LeSean McCoy to get him last March.\nKelly was asked Wednesday morning if Alonso was having surgery while seeing Andrews: “Not that I’m aware of. I just know that he’s down there … I don’t think it is surgery. I mean, he’s coming back on Friday, so we’ll see where he is then. And he said they are rehabbing him, is what I was told.”\nThe Eagles didn’t have either Alonso or Mychal Kendricks last week against the Jets. Kendricks sat out with a hamstring injury. But he was listed as a full participant in practice, which would indicate that he could play Sunday when the Eagles face Washington.\nDeMeco Ryans and rookie Jordan Hicks played inside linebacker against the Jets. Even if Kendricks returns, both will likely play quite a bit against Washington.\nKelly: O-line depth lacking\nAfter the Eagles lost their second offensive lineman to a season-ending injury, Kelly was asked why the Eagles didn’t go after an offensive lineman in free agency last spring or at least select one in the draft.\nRight guard Andrew Gardner went on injured reserve Tuesday after suffering a Lisfranc sprain in his foot against the Jets on Sunday. Backup center David Molk went on injured reserve after the season opener with a torn biceps muscle. Matt Tobin is expected to start in Gardner’s absence.\n“The price tag of what was available in free agency was more than what we were willing to pay,” Kelly said.\nAs for the draft, he said the Eagles didn’t have any offensive linemen who were graded as third rounders, where the Eagles could have taken one after taking wide receiver Nelson Agholor in the first round and cornerback Eric Rowe in the second.\n“If we took them, we wouldn’t have Jordan Hicks right now,” Kelly said. “I mean, we are not going to reach and take things just for the sake of taking things.”\nDELAWAREONLINE\nEagles know what Washington’s missing without DeSean\nThe injuries leave the Eagles with eight offensive linemen. Kelly said he’d like to have nine, but can’t because of the injuries to Kendricks and Alonso. Since neither of them is going on IR, the Eagles have to hold their roster spots.\n“You have to figure out where do I get that extra spot right now?” Kelly said. “For us, at this time, it was in the offensive line. You get another injury somewhere, you may have to compensate somewhere else.”\nWing tips\n>>The NFL is reportedly looking into contingency plans in case Hurricane Joaquin impacts the Washington, D.C. area on Sunday. The NFL wouldn’t say what changes could take place. The Eagles and Washington are scheduled to play at 1 p.m. Sunday.\n>>Running back DeMarco Murray was a limited participant in practice after missing Sunday’s game against the Jets. Also limited were LT Jason Peters (quadriceps), WR Josh Huff (hamstring), DE Taylor Hart (shoulder), DE Cedric Thornton (hand).\n>>WR Riley Cooper (knee) and S Chris Maragos (quadriceps) didn’t practice at all.\nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com .
