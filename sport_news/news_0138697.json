Sort of hard to not know Leonard Fournette is the bell cow after all.\nAs big a feather as it is in the Tigers' big guys' caps when Fournette hangs up big numbers, the notion of a record-setting day with more than one piece of the offensive machine humming seemed to be that much more satisfying.\nLSU racked up 624 total yards Saturday to dismantle South Carolina 45-24 and cap a weird week when the game shifted to Baton Rouge because of flooding in Columbia, S.C. Fournette certainly got his with 158 rushing yards -- most of that on a game-changing 87-yard touchdown burst on the second play of the third quarter to stretch the Tiger lead to 24-10.\nBut it was the sum of the parts that was most impressive.\nLSU guard Will Clapp says taking the fight to the defense fits the Tigers' style | Video After struggling to get Fournette free early, the LSU line wore South Carolina down\nFreshman Derrius Guice stepped out of Fournette's shadow and took over as the leading man in the second half on the way to a 161-yard rushing day. Darrel Williams scored a pair of touchdowns and plowed his way to 61 hard-nosed yards.\nThe grind-it-out carnage was 396 rushing yards on 54 attempts -- 408 on 53 when a sack is extracted. LSU has now topped 200 yards on the ground in every game this season.\nOnce Fournette got loose and gave LSU some breathing room, the offense began dominating. The Tigers' first four offensive possessions of the second half accounted for 312 yards on 24 plays and all yielded touchdowns.\nWith Guice's season-high total and 158 from Fournette, two Tiger running backs topped 150 yards in a game for only the second time in school history. The other was Sept. 7, 1996, against Houston when Kevin Faulk and Rondell Mealey rushed for 246 and 161 yards respectively.\n\"It's definitely a big accomplishment for us when all of our backs are able to get involved and have a big day,\" right guard Will Clapp said.\nWhat added to the satisfaction is that it took a while for the Tigers (5-0, 3-0 SEC) to get into a groove on offense.\nCarolina (2-4, 0-4) effectively bottled up Fournette as well as any team this season in the first half. He ran for only 49 yards on 15 carries in the initial 30 minutes with only one burst over 7 yards (11).\nLSU running back Derrius Guice broke off a 39-yard run as part of his 161-yard day against South Carolina on Saturday. Michael DeMocker, NOLA.com | Times-Picayune Instead of getting frustrated, the o-line remained consistent, adjusted to losing Jerald Hawkins for a stretch and gave Fournette time to find the crease he needed.\n\"When you keep pounding on the defense as the quarters go on, a 4- or -yard run turns into 12-yard run,\" right tackle Vadal Alexander said. \"The next thing you know, it pops and turns into an 80-yard run.\n\"You've got to just pound away, keep fighting for extra yards and keep finishing your guy because you never know when your block is going to spring a long run and make it a big play.\"\nThe first two plays of the second half were a perfect example.\nThe Gamecocks' defense had stood tall in the first half, but on the first play of LSU's opening possession, Fournette took a short pitch and pounded out a bruising 3-yard run to the right â€“ the football equivalent of getting a cold glass of water on you while you sleep soundly.\nLSU offensive coordinator Cam Cameron dialed up an off-tackle play to the left on 2 nd down, with Hawkins, left guard Maea Teuhema and freshman fullback Bry'Kiethon Mouton caving the Carolina defense in and blazing a wide-open path that Fournette dashed through for the length-of-the-field dagger.\nCommunication between the line and Leonard Fournette is vital, LSU tackle Vadal Alexander says | Video The Tigers rushed for 396 yards Saturday against South Carolina\n\"We give him a chance to make those real physical plays and when Leonard and our other backs run as hard as they do, it makes people want to question whether or not they want to fill the hole every time,\" Clapp said.\nWhich seemed to be the case once Guice took over.\nRunning with a different gear than Fournette against the weary Gamecocks, Guice turned into a human pinball at times. On one signature run for 25 yards, Guice appeared to be stacked up at the line of scrimmage but he shimmied loose, twirled way from another tackle and brought the small but vocal Tiger Stadium crowd to its feet.\n\"I think he's pretty talented,\" LSU coach Les Miles said of Guice when asked to describe his running style. \"Reckless' might be the best word. Angry might be a better word. There are a number of ways to describe his running style. Efficient.\"\nMight not be a bad word to apply to the entire LSU offense after that performance.\nDural's right-place, right-time play sparks LSU\nGAME STORY | Fournette gets support asL SU rolls\nRON HIGGINS COLUMN | Unpredictable week ends predictably\nGo figure | Offense makes it mark in the record book\nLSU 45, South Carolina 24 | How they scored\nBOXSCORE\n7 plays to remember\nFournette has a place in 'Walking with Tigers'\nVLOG | LSU offense comes alive in 45-24 win\nVIDEO | Leonard Fournette on Derrius Guice\nVIDEO | Vadal Alexander on communication\nVIDEO | Will Clapp on taking the fight to the opponent", "external_links": ["http://www.lsusports.net/pdf9/3946917.pdf?ATCLID=210412013&SPSID=27815&SPID=2164&DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=5200"], "published": "2015-10-11T18:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T02:10:23.385+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
