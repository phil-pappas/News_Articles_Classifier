Backing up quarterback Joe Flacco, Tyrod Taylor was mostly relegated to the sideline.\nYet in practice, he displayed his varied skill set. Spagnuolo, who left Baltimore for his second stint as the Giants' defensive coordinator, watched Taylor give the Ravens' first-team defense \"headaches every day.\"\n\"If he tucked it and put it in, he was getting in the end zone,\" Spagnuolo said. \"Used to drive those guys nuts.\"\nNow it's Spagnuolo who's devising a plan he hopes will shut down Taylor, who beat out EJ Manuel and Matt Cassel for the Bills' starting quarterback job. Taylor, a 2011 sixth-round pick out of Virginia Tech, signed with Buffalo in March.\nWhat makes Taylor difficult to defend is his mobility. A dual-threat quarterback, he's capable of big plays through the air or with his feet.\nHis 116.1 passer rating is fifth best in the NFL, and his 74.4 completion percentage is good for fourth. Taylor, 26, is the first Bills quarterback with at least seven touchdown passes and a completion percentage of at least 70 percent through Week 3 since Hall-of-Famer Jim Kelly in 1991.\nThe 6-foot-1 Taylor, who ran a 4.5 40-yard dash at the NFL combine, also has rushed for 96 yards on 17 carries this season.\nGiants cornerback Jayron Hosley was Taylor's teammate in college. Although Taylor is known for his rushing capability, Hosley said he has a strong arm that's just as much a weapon.\n\"He can throw the ball. That's one thing you can't sleep on this guy about. He definitely can deliver,\" Hosley said. \"He can make those throws that Aaron Rodgers or those top quarterbacks can make.\"\nRookie safety Landon Collins, who played at Alabama, compared Taylor to Johnny Manziel, whom Collins played against when Manziel was at Texas A&M.\n\"If he doesn't see anybody open, he's got every chance to take off and make the yardage that they would gain on a pass play,\" Collins said. \"You've always got to be alert about what's going on. If you got your man, you've to take a little glance to see what he's doing.\"\nThat's because Taylor is difficult to predict.\nWhen he takes off out of the pocket, he's not always looking to extend plays with his legs. He often scrambles to look downfield and throw, which causes problems for the secondary.\nThat places greater emphasis on a disciplined pass rush so Taylor is contained in the pocket.\n\"It's a lot different,\" defensive tackle Cullen Jenkins said. \"Now you're not able to just go try to hunt down a quarterback. You've got to be so disciplined in your rush so that you don't allow the big plays he can make with his legs.\"\nTaylor also might feel added pressure Sunday. He's expected to be without two weapons in wide receiver Sammy Watkins (calf) and running back LeSean McCoy (hamstring).\nNot having to worry about Watkins would be a boon for the Giants, who have given up 1,007 yards through the air, worst in the NFL.\nBut the Giants still have the challenge of trying to stop Taylor, whom Spagnuolo said is also a \"tough tackle.\"\n\"Again, I watched him for two years,\" Spagnuolo said. \"He was the best athlete on that team down there.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T04:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T10:33:03.900+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
