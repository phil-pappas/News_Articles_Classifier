The loss for Dawson County (4-3, 3-1) nullified a big win over Franklin County last week that left the Tigers alone in first place. \nFannin County opened the game with a field goal on its first possession and then got a pick-6 off Dawson County quarterback Coey Watson less than minutes later for a 10-0 lead. \nThe Rebels extended the lead to 17-0 in the second quarter on a 4-yard touchdown run by Jack Roper and pushed their lead to 24-0 with just 43 seconds left in the first half when Brad Davis connected with Adam Ingram on a 15-yard touchdown pass. \nThe Tigers climbed back in the game midway through the third quarter when Watson scored on a 5-yard run to go with a 2-point conversion to trim the lead to 24-8. \nBarely two minutes later Fannin County increased the lead 31-8 on a 9-yard touchdown run by Roper. The Tigers cut the lead to 31-15 on a 3-yard touchdown run by Logan Hurst with 11:38 left in the game but they could get no closer.
