He shifted from right guard to left tackle after Jason Peters suffered a quadriceps injury and lasted just six plays during the Eagles' 23-20 loss to Washington Redskins at FedEx Field. \n\"People say it's a hard road, but I don't know anything different,\" Tobin said. \"I don't know about getting a scholarship, getting drafted.\" \nYet the 6-foot-6, 290-pound Tobin knows plenty about persevering. \nFootball is one of the few professions where somebody with his dimensions can be categorized as being on the smallish side. \n\"I think he is a little bit undersized at the tackle position, and at guard he is a little too lean for some of the systems, but since he has been here with us, he has been a very solid player and we have enjoyed having him here,\" Eagles center Jason Kelce said. \nTobin had plenty of reps at tackle in the preseason and during the offseason, but getting thrown into the fire during a game is a different story. \n\"Since I played all preseason at left tackle I was ready, but it caught me off guard in the beginning,\" said Tobin, who last year started five games at left guard and two at right guard. \nTobin was praised for adapting on the fly against the Redskins. \n\"He competed when he was out there, and that's the one thing you'll get out of Matt, is he'll fight when he's in there,\" Eagles coach Chip Kelly said. \nAdded Kelce: \"He played well at left tackle. \"He had a couple of [tough] plays but we all have a couple of plays.\" \nThis week it's likely that Tobin will start at right guard. Peters insists he will play this week after returning as a full practice participant on Thursday and Friday. Right tackle Lane Johnson, who has been hobbled with a knee and ankle injury, also says he is ready to go. \nStill Tobin says he will be prepared this week to play either guard or tackle. This type of versatility has earned him a place, first in college, where he played both positions, and now the NFL. \n\"Tobin is kind of like a Swiss army knife, he is a guy who can pretty much play any position,\" Johnson said. \". . . He is a versatile guy, very smart and works his tail off and there is a lot of positively coming from him.\" \nNotes. Three Eagles are listed out for Sunday's game - linebacker Kiko Alonso (knee), defensive end Brandon Bair (groin) and linebacker Mychal Kendricks (hamstring). Peters is listed as questionable. Eagles listed as probable are Johnson, Allen Barbre (groin), defensive end Taylor Hart (shoulder), safety Chris Maragos (quadriceps), cornerback Byron Maxwell (quadriceps) and defensive end Cedric Thornton (hand).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T23:34:14.586+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
