Through three games, Braden Holtby has registered 74 saves and a .914 save percentage. \nWhen Washington won its season opener against New Jersey, 5-3, defenseman Brooks Orpik ran down a list of things the Capitals needed to correct going forward, finally adding, “Holtsy is probably our best guy there.” His teammates pointed to his right-pad save on an Adam Henrique breakaway chance as the turning point in that game. \n— CAPITALS HILL (@CapitalsHill) October 11, 2015 \nIn a disappointing performance on Tuesday night, a 5-0 loss to the San Jose Sharks, Holtby was still a bright spot in a game that didn’t have many. He made 27 saves and gave up three goals, the last two being empty-netters. \n— Capitals Goalies (@CapsGoalies) October 16, 2015 \nUnlike Tuesday night, Washington got off to a stronger start on Thursday against the Blackhawks. But the Capitals came out flat in the second period and momentum appeared to be swinging to Chicago in the second period. For all the chances the Blackhawks had, they couldn’t solve Holtby. They fired 17 shots on goal that period, and he saved every one. \nHoltby stopped three point-blank shots in less than 20 seconds in the second period, and the Verizon Center crowd chanted his name appreciatively. Eight minutes into the period, Andrew Desjardins sent a wrist shot behind Holtby, but it slid across the crease instead of into the goal. Holtby finished with 26 saves. \n“We still made mistakes,” defenseman Matt Niskanen said. “Probably too many Grade-A chances to give up. Holts kind of bailed us out on numerous occasions.” \nSaid Holtby: “Obviously, that’s usually a strength of ours — not giving up odd-man rushes, so that’s what we’ll have to figure out, how to minimize that. At the same time, it’s the Blackhawks. They’re a pretty creative team, a pretty fast team that can create those. Yeah, I think we played some of them well, some of them not-so-well and got away with it.” #Holtby putting on a clinic early in the 2nd, #Caps up 1-0 #CapsHawks pic.twitter.com/RdiycZhPOh \n— Capitals Goalies (@CapsGoalies) October 16, 2015 For the GIF crowd, the puck came within 2 inches of going in while Holtby did the splits.

He set career highs in wins (41), shutouts (nine), games played (73), goals against average (2.22) and save percentage (.923). He recorded a franchise-record 1,887 saves and tied franchise records in wins, shutouts and games played. \n“It’s the same thing every night,” Marcus Johansson said. “You can’t ask for a better goalie.” Isabelle Khurshudyan covers the Washington Capitals.
