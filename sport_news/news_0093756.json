The AP Transco has been identified as the developer for the first of its kind project in the country. The green corridor will evacuate power generated by solar and wind power projects which are under construction in Rayalaseema districts.\nThe funds will be utilized for the green power corridor in Anantapur, Kurnool, Kadapa and Chittoor districts, where many solar and wind power projects are coming up. This will be the first green corridor in the country with dedicated transmission and distribution network.\nThe 1000 mw NTPC solar power project in Anantapur will be connected to this green corridor. Also, 689 mw solar power generated by independent power projects being developed in Kadapa, Kurnool and Chittoor districts will also be linked to the corridor. While the NTPC will complete 250 mw first unit in March 2016, AP Genco's 500 mw solar projects will be connected to the green corridor later next year.\n\"Based on the highest plant load factor achieved by the state, AP has been selected to implement the green corridor project. Solar and wind projects with a capacity of 6000 mw, which are in different stages of construction, will be linked to the main transmission line through the proposed corridor,\" K Vijayanand, CMD, AP Transco, told TOI. AP, which was selected to implement 24x7 power supply project, has received the second major project in the form of the green corridor.\nThe German government has already participated in the funding of Krishnapatnam thermal power project and the green corridor will be the second big investment by Germany in Andhra Pradesh. The financial assistance comes without any interest except covering the foreign exchange fluctuations.\n\"This will work out at about one per cent and the state was given three years to complete the project,\" P Satyamurthy, director finance of AP Transco, told TOI after signing the agreement with the German government in the presence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and German Chancellor Angela Merkel in New Delhi .\nThe green energy corridor will also serve as a major transmission line to evacuate power generated in wind power projects in Anantapur in AP, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.\nStay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.", "external_links": ["https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toi.reader.activities"], "published": "2015-10-08T11:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T01:17:40.812+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
