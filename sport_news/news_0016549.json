Back Photo: 2 of 2 Next AP Virginia Tech's Isaiah Ford (1) runs the ball during the first half of an NCAA college football game against the East Carolina in Greenville, N.C., Saturday, Sept. 26, 2015. \nNate Peterman didn’t run away from the Tennessee football program as much as he ran to Pitt’s. And the change in scenery was exactly what the quarterback from Bartram Trail High needed. \nAfter struggling with the Volunteers, including a starting assignment against Alabama when he was benched after two series, Peterman has been the triggerman in a Panthers’ revival that has fans thinking about an ACC championship. \nPeterman, a graduate student with two years of eligibility remaining, prefers to push forward, not look back. He is appreciative of his opportunities at Pitt and isn’t bitter about the way things turned out at Tennessee. \nMore than anything else, he’s glad to be playing. \n“Football’s football,” he said after completing 17 of 24 passes for 222 yards and two TDs in a 26-19 win over Virginia last Saturday. “I’m just having fun out here. \n“I was comfortable when I got here. It’s really how everyone here welcomed me in. A fresh start was definitely big. Football is meant to be fun and played with passion and enthusiasm.” \nPeterman has played a role in the Panthers’ best start since 2009. Equally important, Pitt (4-1) is 2-0 in the ACC Coastal Division. \nOffensive coordinator Jim Chaney was at Tennessee with Peterman in 2012. When he took the same job at Pitt, Peterman made the telephone call that changed everything. \n“Just having that history, knowing I could come in here and know the offense from Day 1,” Peterman said. “It’s good to work with him again. We have a history and I know what to expect of him.” \nPeterman was 10 of 20 passing for 49 yards last year with the Vols. He is 60 of 90 for 760 yards and six touchdowns with the Panthers. \n\nTrinity’s Ford evolves into Hokies’ top receiver \nWhen a play broke down a year ago, Isaiah Ford generally would have created his own route. This year, he’s learned to stick with the offensive plan. \nThe change has resulted in a noticeable transformation into a top-level wide receiver at Virginia Tech. \nAlthough Ford only caught four passes in last Friday’s 28-13 win over North Carolina, three were for touchdowns. \n“Isaiah is bigger, stronger,” Hokies offensive coordinator Scot Loeffler said. “If he keeps this up, next year he will be something else.” \nFord, from Trinity Christian, said he worked in the offseason to improve his blocking and route-running. He leads the Hokies with 28 receptions for 421 yards and six touchdowns. \nFord had touchdown catches of 27, 5 and 2 yards against N.C. State. \nAccording to Loeffler, the last two scores were the result of the sophomore finding “the fat of the end zone,” like he was coached. \n“Last year I would have done my own thing,” Ford said. “Now I just do my job.” \nPart of the Hokies’ success comes from an offensive line that includes left guard Kyle Chung (Ponte Vedra).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T03:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T18:09:02.329+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
