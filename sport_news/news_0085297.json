(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images) (NEW YORK) -- Whether it was a computer glitch or an itchy mouse finger, Mets fans may be a bit concerned Wednesday night after the team website began displaying \"NL Champions\" gear before the team took the field in Game Four of the National League Championship Series. \n— Adam Rubin (@AdamRubinESPN) October 21, 2015 \nThe site began showing World Series gear and other items with the \"NL Champions\" moniker on Wednesday afternoon and was quickly taken down. But with the team requiring one more win over the Chicago Cubs before either of those titles are accurate, there's concern over having jumped the gun early. ESPN New York reports that MLB executive Bob Bowman said it was not the team's fault, as Major League Baseball Advanced Media controls that content on all teams' websites. The league, Bowman said, apologized to the Mets for the error. The Mets lead the Cubs three games to none in the best-of-seven NLCS. While only one of the previous 24 teams to hold a 3-0 lead in a best-of-seven has blown it, there is some reason Mets fans may have fear.Cubs President Theo Epstein was the general manager of the 2004 Boston Red Sox, the only team to come back from such a deficit. Graphics and merchandise are normally prepared in advance of the clinching moment, with items depicting the losers often being sent to impoverished nations. \n\nCopyright © 2015, ABC Radio.
