The U.S. failed to generate much of an attack and was caught twice by one of the region's emerging talents in Honduran forward Alberth Elis, who notched both goals in the win over the Americans.\n\"It's not going to be easy [Tuesday],\" said Real Salt Lake midfielder Luis Gil.\nGil echoed the thoughts of U.S. assistant coach John Hackworth, who will be coaching the U.S. U-23s in the third-place match against Canada following the ejection of coach Andi Herzog Saturday against Honduras. The former Philadelphia Union coach noted the difficulty of defeating the same team twice in a tournament.\n\"That's what we have to do,\" Hackworth said Monday afternoon. \"That's our resolve [Tuesday] is to come with our absolute best, put everything we have into it. If not, it's over for us.\"\nAgainst the Canadians, the U.S. will face another methodical, blue-collar approach. Canada is second in Olympic qualifying with 48 fouls committed, two behind Honduras and two ahead of the U.S.\nMexico and Honduras already have their tickets to Rio. The Americans must win to avoid not qualifying for the third time in four Summer Games.\n\"You have to forget about [Saturday] and you have to focus on the now,\" Hackworth said. \"This is an experienced group of players. We have good leaders on this team.\"\nckamrani@sltrib.com \nTwitter: @chriskamrani", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T13:38:17.993+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
