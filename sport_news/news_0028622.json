He was in hospitals often his first ten years and hardly had enough energy to walk. A liver transplant in 2007 saved his life and gave him the ability to compete in the Special Olympics, where he’s won multiple medals in kayaking: Two gold at the Georgia State Kayak Invitational; Gold in the two man Kayak 200m race and Gold in the 500m single at the 2015 Special Olympics World Games in Los Angeles earlier this year. \nSince Will was born, his parents have been advocates for him and for other children with developmental disabilities. Scott is a Parent Mentor and Special Olympics Coordinator for the Hall County School System. \nDevelopmental disabilities are defined as severe chronic intellectual and/or physical disabilities that limit three or more critical functional abilities. Examples include Down syndrome, cerebral palsy, spina bifida, autism disorders, fetal alcohol disorders and intellectual disabilities. These disabilities manifest early in life (before age 22) and last a lifetime. \nAADD offers a range of services focusing on Family Support, Public Policy and Advocacy and Community Engagement. \nFor more information, go to www.AADD.org or call at (404) 881-9777.
