The car, from Chip Ganassi Racing, is the backup car for Kanaan, the 2013 Indianapolis 500 winner.\nBy Nathan Dominitz For someone so prominently linked to education — he founded the preeminent auto racing school in America — Skip Barber downplays his own scholastic record.\n“I was not a very good student,” Barber, 77, recalled Friday. “I spent most of my time in college worrying about cars and girls.”\nIt took five years, but the young man from Philadelphia somehow graduated from Harvard in 1959 with a degree in English. Not that he intended to use it. He had no plans to become an author or professor. Racing was his game.\n“I goofed off through college. I think car racing saved me,” he said. “I got completely focused on it. That became all I wanted to do. Boy, I worked hard at it. I’d never worked hard at anything. You’re lucky when you’re a goof-off and something comes along that you really want to do.”\nBefore he became a professional race car driver, then the founder of the Skip Barber Racing School, then the owner of Lime Rock Park road course in Connecticut, and this weekend the grand marshal of the Savannah Speed Classic, Barber was street racing after 2 a.m. in the Cambridge section of Boston.\n“There’s a great race track right in the middle of Cambridge if you wait until late enough at night,” said Barber, who was concerned more with classifications of cars than classes.\nDriving “an old, beat up, 20-year-old MG,” Barber tried to beat his friends for the fastest lap — not side-by-side racing — on the bridge over the Charles River, around traffic circles and back.\n“I was great, but the car was slow,” he said with a laugh. “Even then, I had the excuses. That’s the beginning of learning to be a race car driver. It’s always the car’s fault.”\nIt’s funny what people do for love. Barber didn’t come from money. He said he was “a poor kid” who got through college on scholarships and grants. He also washed dishes and worked with youth in rough Boston neighborhoods.\n“At one point I had five jobs,” Barber said. “Ironic, isn’t it, to make such effort to go to school and not do the (school) work? I guess I was a screwed-up kid.”\nHe knew what he wanted and paid his dues to climb the ladder as a pro driver from the 1960s into the mid-70s. Barber added a second job to go with his busy weekends of racing. Claiming to have no inspiration or sense that the marketplace demanded it, Barber started his driving school in 1975.\n“I had no vision about it, which is pretty ironic since we ended up with such a huge company,” Barber said. “I was still racing in 1975 and I thought this would be a great thing to do during the week, to get started for when I finished racing, maybe. I never thought you could really make a living at it.”\nHe made a couple of discoveries that first year: He enjoyed running his own business, and he could teach people how to drive race cars. Auto racing, he said, is no different than other sports where coaches are so prolific.\n“This was a major, major thing at the time,” hall of fame race car driver Brian Redman, 78, said this week. “It was one of the first racing schools. I never went to a racing school when I started racing (in England). There weren’t any. Skip started Skip Barber Racing School, which is still going strong, so he’s had a huge influence on the American motor racing scene.”\nAt its peak, before he sold it 15 years ago, Barber’s school had hundreds of employees, a fleet of about 200 cars, five base locations and 15 different tracks it used, including Roebling Road in Bloomingdale.\n“The thing I’m proudest of is we became the entry point, the way you got into racing,” Barber said, noting that the school also trained people for other professions in the industry, such as mechanics and public relations. “All different aspects of employment in racing, we were the feeder system. That’s really neat.”\nAsked to list some of the notable drivers affiliated with the school such as NASCAR legends Jeff Gordon and Bill Elliott, and three-time Indianapolis 500 winner Johnny Rutherford, Barber said, “It’s easier to name ones who didn’t. If you look at the Indy 500 field, I don’t think we ever had less than a third of the field. All the Americans in there and most of the Brazilians would be school graduates.”\nThe driving school is a tenant of Lime Rock Park, which Barber bought in 1983 as part of a group and now is sole owner.\n“Lime Rock is generally considered the most beautiful track in North America,” Barber said of the 1.5-mile course on 380 lush acres. “Lime Rock, I think, is the only major road racing track that has no grandstands. It’s all about lawn chairs and blankets. It’s a park. It really is a park.”\nHe likened his track to what he saw on a sunny Friday at the Grand Prize of America road course in Savannah. It was his first time back since 1997, when in addition to the Indy Lights main event there was a Barber Dodge Pro Series race.\n“There’s a lot of grass and trees like this,” he said. “When road racing in this country really got started in the ’50s and ’60s, it felt like this, grass and trees and cars slightly randomly parked, not a big, asphalt paddock. Everything’s very friendly. To me, there’s a certain irony. This is vintage racing, and it has that vintage race track feel, that casualness.”\nNathan Dominitz is a sports reporter for the Savannah Morning News.
