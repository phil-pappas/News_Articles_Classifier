Show Caption Previous Next \nKANSAS CITY, Mo. - Yordano Ventura's first pitch to the Blue Jays' Ben Revere in Game 6 of the AL Championship Series came with clear skies and an unseasonably warm temperature of 70 degrees. The rain came down just after 10 p.m., when the game was tied 3-3. \nFan interference? Nope \nBen Zobrist and Mike Moustakas staked the Royals to an early lead over Toronto on a pair of solo home runs in Game 6 of the ALCS, though there was some debate over the second of them. \nWATCH: See Frank Boal interview MVP Alcides Escobar in the video player above \nMoustakas connected off Blue Jays ace David Price with one out in the second. The liner appeared to skim over the fence in right field. Then a fan named Caleb Humphreys, 19, of Blue Springs, reached out and caught the ball before it hit the padding, prompting Toronto outfielder Jose Bautista to call for fan interference. \nBlue Jays manager John Gibbons asked for a review, and the original ruling of a home run was upheld after 1 minute, 47 seconds. Fox broadcasters reported the officials couldn't definitively overturn the home run based on the video. \nCaleb Humphreys, 19, kept the ball, and the Royals kept the home run. \nAs a result, the Royals kept the run. Humphreys kept the ball and got an interview with Erin Andrews on the national broadcast. \nBlue Jays get to work \nVentura had retired 10 straight Blue Jays before Jose Bautista launched a solo shot over the bullpen in left field to get Toronto within 2-1 in the fourth inning. \nVentura was working from the stretch to keep in rhythm, and his approach appeared to be working. He threw 17 of his first 20 pitches for strikes, and had four strikeouts — all with a nasty curveball — over the first four innings. \nHe lasted into the sixth. \nKelvin Herrera stranded an inherited runner on second base to leave Kansas City with a 2-1 lead over the Toronto Blue Jays. \nRain delay \nJust minutes after Jose Bautista's two-run homer in the eighth inning knotted Game 6 of the AL Championship Series 3-all, a heavy rain began falling at Kauffman Stadium. \nThe game was delayed with Kansas City coming to bat in the bottom half. \nThe rain delay lasted about 30 minutes. \nFor the win \nWas the rain just the ticket for the Royals? Minutes after the delay was over, Lorenzo Cain came home to bring the score to 4-3. \nCopyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc. All rights reserved.
