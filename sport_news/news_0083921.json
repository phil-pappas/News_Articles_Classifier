This was a perfect metaphor for a season that saw spring hopes fade slowly into harsh disappointment. \nIt was 6-all with one out in the seventh when Evan Gattis sent a fly to right field. It should either be caught or, maybe, fall for a single. But Miller lost his footing as he charged toward the ball. \nThe result was a triple. (Miller overthrew the relay man, but Gattis would likely have reached third in any event.) \nAfter Jonathan Villar replaced Gattis as a pinch-runner, the Mariners shortened their infield – which meant Colby Rasmus’ soft bloop against Danny Farquhar (1-7) landed beyond a retreating Ketel Marte from short. \nThere was more, of course, including a brutal outing by reliever JC Ramirez after he inherited a 6-3 lead in the sixth inning. \nAlso, credit the Astros, fighting to reach postseason as part of a remarkable turnaround, for overcoming deficits of 2-0 and 6-3. They lead the Los Angeles Angels by one-half game for the final wild-card berth. \nTony Sipp (3-4) got the victory when Luke Gregerson pitched a scoreless ninth for his 31st save. \nFor the Mariners, this was the seventh loss in eight games in a season that concludes this weekend with three required games against Oakland’s even more disappointing Athletics. \nLet’s reset: \nThe M’s had just surrendered a 2-0 lead when Houston scored three runs in the fifth when they muscled up a four-run answer. \nOne-out singles by Jesus Sucre and Ketel Marte put runners at first and third before Kyle Seager jumped a high slider from Houston starter Scott Kazmir for a 409-foot homer to right-center field. \nThe Mariners led 5-3. \nNelson Cruz followed with a similar drive to right-center for his 44th homer of the season. \nThe Mariners turned to Ramirez with a 6-3 lead in the sixth. \nFirst, Ramirez failed to handle a bunt by Carlos Gomez, which turned into single. Next, Ramirez ignored Gomez, who stole second without throw. Then came a walk to Luis Valbuena. \nFinally, Ramirez jumped ahead 0-2 on Chris Carter before putting a slider on a tee. Carter drove it 418 feet to left for a game-tying homer. That was it for Ramirez.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T21:17:08.237+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
