It should never happen to us after being 2-0 up.\"\nSydney beat Newcastle 1-0 to extend its unbeaten record away from home to a league-record 16 games.\nSydney had eight shots to one on target and had 60 percent of possession but had to wait until the 89th minute when captain Alex Brosque broke the deadlock with a headed goal.\nSydney will meet city rival Western Sydney next weekend.\nThe Wanderers drew 1-1 with Adelaide on Friday, with Spaniard Andreu Mayora scoring at both ends. Andreu conceded an own goal in the 21st minute, deflecting Tarerk Elrich's shot wide of keeper Andrew Redmayne.

Brisbane added to its 3-1 first-round triumph over Western Sydney with a win that lifted it above the Victory and Sydney, which both have a win and a draw from two games.\nCONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
