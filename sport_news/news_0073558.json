He was not signed by the team, but said during his show Wednesday afternoon that he had “a great workout” and “a great experience,” which would only help his continued attempt to stage an NFL comeback. \nCooley — who arrived in New York Monday evening, and worked out with Wes Welker and Hakeem Nicks, among others — said he knew he was unlikely to be signed when he learned he was the only tight end in the session. That indicated, he said, that the Giants weren’t in an urgent search to fill a need, but rather were trying to do research in case a need develops. \n“I was fairly positive that without an injury on the New York Giants and with no other tight ends on the workout, it was an exploration-type of a workout,” he said. “But that’s great for me. That’s great for me, and I had a great workout. They may not like their guys or they may potentially have injuries later in the season, and I was basically told you would be on the list of first guys we would want to sign if anything happens.” \nCooley said his workout was brief, and he was not assigned a grade. The younger players had to run the 40; Welker, Nicks and Cooley did not. He ran about 15 routes, caught every ball, chatted briefly with head coach Tom Coughlin, offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo and tight ends coach Kevin Gilbride Jr., and had a brief session with GM Jerry Reese. \nReese “said you had a great day, we really appreciate it, we think if we brought you in on a Wednesday we could play you on a Sunday,” Cooley recalled. “I said thank you.” Sincere thanks to the #giants for the opportunity today. I am too determined to ever doubt I can play.I will not quit, but only work harder. \n— Chris Cooley (@thecooleyzone) September 30, 2015 \nCooley also went into the city for hours of physicals, X-rays and paperwork, in case the team later decides it wants to sign him. He noted that this was the first tryout of his adult life, and the first time he had been in a pro facility other than Redskins Park. (He called the Giants building “amazing,” “phenomenal” and “beautiful.”) He didn’t hit bags or run sprints or anything other than run routes, but he still said it was exactly what he wanted. \n“I needed that. I needed my name to be part of working out,” Cooley said. “I want you to understand this: it worked out really well. I didn’t sign with that team, but going into it, that’s what I expected to happen. And I had a great workout. It was great, it was a great experience, it was a great day. It was great for me.” \nAlso, amazingly, the quarterback Cooley caught balls from was Phillip Sims. Also, amazingly, Cooley said every Giants coach asked him why he wasn’t wearing his trademark short-shorts during the session. Dan Steinberg writes about all things D.C. sports at the D.C.
