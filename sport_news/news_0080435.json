There is no timeline on his return at this time.\nRussell underwent an x-ray and CT scan after the game, which revealed the injury. He is scheduled to see a specialist for the injury during the week.\nThe injury in question occurred with about six minutes left in the fourth quarter of Baylor's win. Russell scrambled within the red zone and attempted to bully his way to a first down, coming just short. After the injury, Briles opted to kick a field goal instead of go for it on 4th-and-1.\nRussell has thrown for 2,104 yards and 29 touchdowns this season in his first year as a starter. The Garland native has compiled 33 total touchdowns through only seven games this year.\nIn his absence, true freshman quarterback Jarrett Stidham will take over at QB1 on the depth chart and now-wide receiver Chris Johnson will switch over to QB2.\nStidham has thrown for 331 yards and six touchdowns with only four incomplete passes this year. He was a former four-star prospect out of Stephenville. Johnson moved to wide receiver after Stidham beat him out at quarterback in camp.\nOn Twitter:\n @ShehanJeyarajah", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ShehanJeyarajah"], "published": "2015-10-25T01:07:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T03:32:13.292+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
