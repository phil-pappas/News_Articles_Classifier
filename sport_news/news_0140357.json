It has been selling its lending and finance units, exiting a banking sector with stricter oversight.\nTrian acquired 98.5 million shares, or about 1 percent of the Fairfield, Connecticut, company. The fund's executives, Peltz and Ed Garden, have a longstanding relationship with GE CEO Jeff Immelt.\n\"GE is executing a bold transformation that will generate attractive stockholder returns in the years ahead as the company reshapes its portfolio,\" Trian said in a statement.\nThe investor has not asked GE for board representation.\nImmelt, meanwhile, says GE is looking forward to constructive dialogue with Trian as it moves ahead with its transformation.\nGeneral Electric shares rose $1.05, or 4.1 percent, to $26.52 in premarket trading Monday about two hours before the market open.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-05T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T03:40:42.104+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
