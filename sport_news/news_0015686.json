(AP) - Baker Mayfield threw for five touchdowns and No. 19 Oklahoma bounced back from its Red River upset to beat Kansas State 55-0 on Saturday, the first time the Wildcats have been shut out since 1996. \nKansas State had delivered serious scares to Top 25 opponents each of the last two weeks but the Wildcats (3-3, 0-3 Big 12) were helpless against the Sooners (5-1, 2-1). Oklahoma set the tone early, taking only 1:04 to score on its opening drive on a 22-yard pass from Mayfield to Sterling Shepard. \nThe Sooners took a 35-0 lead into halftime as Mayfield threw for all five of his TDs in the first half, including two to Shepard. He finished 20 of 27 for 282 yards. \nOklahoma kept rolling to open the second half. The Wildcats had benched Joe Hubener in favor of Kody Cook, who played most of the first half at wide receiver, and Cook promptly threw an interception that Zack Sanchez returned 38 yards for a touchdown that made the score 42-0. \nThe Sooners tacked on two more field goals in the third quarter, and five minutes into the fourth quarter Joe Mixon scored the first rushing touchdown of the day for Oklahoma, stretching the team’s lead to 55-0. \nMixon finished with 73 yards on 15 carries to lead a Sooners rushing attack that rolled up 232 yards. Mixon also caught three passes for 29 yards, including a 10-yard touchdown catch in the first quarter. \nGoing into Saturday’s game, Kansas State had scored in 234 straight games. The loss to Oklahoma marked the first time the Wildcats have been shut out at home since 1991. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T03:25:05.250+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
