That is the only time the event has been held outside England or Scotland. \nThe push to bring the Open back to Northern Ireland gained momentum after three players from the country — Graeme McDowell, Darren Clarke and Rory McIlroy — won majors since 2010. McIlroy is now a four-time major champion. \nThe R&A said last year that Royal Portrush was returning to the Open rotation, but didn’t give a year and said there would be logistical challenges to get the venue in shape. \nThe Dunluce course has been given the first available slot on the calendar. \n“Royal Portrush is one of my favorite golf courses in the world,” said McIlroy, the 2014 British Open champion. “I think it will be a fantastic Open venue.” \nThe R&A said it is expected to be the biggest sporting event ever held in Northern Ireland.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T19:10:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T23:43:41.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
