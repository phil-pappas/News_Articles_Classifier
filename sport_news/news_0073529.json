And said, 'He's Rick. He knows about everything.' \"\nOn Tuesday, Pitino denied any knowledge of the incidents.\n\"I don't know if any of this is true or not,\" he told ESPN's Dana O'Neil, a former Daily News staffer. \"There's only one person who knows the truth, and he needs to come out and tell the truth . . . \"\nAccording to the book, Powell, her three daughters and others danced for recruits and players. Daughter Lindsay, 24, told \"Outside the Lines\" she was paid to have sex with former Louisville player Russ Smith, who now plays for the Grizzlies. Daughter Rod Ni, 22, said the same about the Rockets' Montrezl Harrell.\nSmith did not respond to a message left by ESPN. Harris told the Houston Chronicle he didn't \"know anything about it.\"\nLouisville issued a statement on Tuesday saying that Pitino has no plans to step down.\nStay tuned. Eventually, he might not have a choice.", "external_links": ["http://philly.stats.com/cfb/polls.asp", "http://www.avantlink.com/click.php?tt=cl&mi=11081&pw=159355&ctc=collegegearArticle&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatics.com%2Fpages%2FCOLLEGE"], "published": "2015-10-21T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T00:32:59.004+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
