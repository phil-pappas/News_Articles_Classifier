The Red Raiders could potentially take five wins into Norman, Okla., looking to become bowl-eligible against their former quarterback and current starter for the Sooners, junior Baker Mayfield.\nA loss against the Jayhawks would be devastating at this point in the season for the Red Raiders. The closest Kansas has been to a victory this season was a 41-38 loss in its season-opener against FCS opponent, South Dakota State.\nTexas Tech coach Kliff Kingsbury had nothing but high praise for Kansas coach David Beaty from their time spent together at Texas A&M - Beaty was the receivers coach while Kingsbury was the offense coordinator and coached quarterbacks - but in weeks prior, Kingsbury called for his team to show its 'killer instinct' and now the opportunity awaits.\nWhen Texas Tech has the ball\nBe cognizant of Patrick Mahomes' improvisational skills. The sophomore's playmaking abilities were on display in last week's 66-31 rout of Iowa State and will continue to direct the Red Raiders' high-octane scoring attack as Mahomes continues to work his way back to full strength.\nPatrick Mahomes escapes third down pressure to deliver this absolute strike to Jakeem Grant. http://t.co/ZeLZA7X0KA\n— Big 12 Conference (@Big12Conference) October 10, 2015 Texas Tech leads all FBS programs in passing offense and ranks second in scoring offense, averaging 631 total yards and 52 points per game, respectively, while Mahomes ranks third among FBS quarterbacks in total passing yards (2,264 yards).\nAlso, look for junior receiver Devin Lauderdale to find his way into a highlight or two. During his Monday press conference, Kingsbury said Lauderdale would be back on the field this week against Kansas. Lauderdale currently leads the Red Raiders that have caught at least 10 passes in yards per catch, averaging 20 yards each time he catches the ball.\nThis is what happens when @TechAthletics ' Devin Lauderdale blows by you. #Big12FB on FSN http://t.co/ovS92jOh1c\n— Big 12 Conference (@Big12Conference) September 5, 2015 When Kansas has the ball\nDefensive coordinator David Gibbs would love for the Red Raiders to take it away and return the Red Raiders' offense back onto the field. Texas Tech recorded three takeaways - all interceptions - in their homecoming win against Iowa State, including two by senior defensive back J.J. Gaines.\nFreshman Ryan Willis backs Cozart as the most experienced signal-caller for the Jayhawks. Willis completed 28-of-54 pass attempts for 258 yards with a touchdown and an interception during his time as Kansas' quarterback this season. Expect Gibbs and company to make life as difficult as feasibly possible if Willis emerges as the starter against the Red Raiders.\nPrediction\nKansas remains winless for a reason. Defensively, the Jayhawks are allowing 5.6 yards per rush (257 yards per game) and 9.41 yards per pass. Kansas has allowed its opponents to gain nearly 1,000 more yards than its own offense and the Jayhawks will be without junior quarterback Montell Cozart, according to the Kansas City Star.\nDavid Beaty: Montell Cozart is out this week; DT Jacky Dezir has MCL tear, out for a \"few weeks.\" KU down to 3 DTs with experience.\n— Rustin Dodd (@rustindodd) October 13, 2015 Although Cozart wasn't exactly scoring at will while directing the Jayhawks, the 6-foot-2, 193-pounder was the only quarterback on the roster with starting experience. Texas Tech enters the contest scoring 52 points per game on average with a quarterback averaging 377 passing yards per game - third most at the FBS level.\nScore: Texas Tech 48, Kansas 13\nFollow Mike DuPont on Twitter: @MikeDuPont_\nOn Twitter:\n @MikeDuPont_", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/Big12Conference/status/640258729032613888", "https://twitter.com/TechAthletics", "https://twitter.com/MikeDuPont_", "https://twitter.com/Big12Conference/status/652954374302334976", "http://t.co/ZeLZA7X0KA", "https://twitter.com/rustindodd/status/653996774466543616", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/Big12FB?src=hash", "http://t.co/ovS92jOh1c"], "published": "2015-10-15T20:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T18:38:03.428+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
