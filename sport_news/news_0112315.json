Neither one of my parents had a high school education. My dad was a waiter, and my mom worked as a seamstress, after he passed away when I was 12 years old,” Alvarez says in the video.\n“As a social work major . . . I always felt that I wanted a profession where I was helping people. When I became a state’s attorney 29 years ago, and worked my way up through the system . . . I knew . . . that this was my calling, this was my passion.”\nThe first woman and Latina to hold the office faces her first contested Democratic primary in eight years.\nTwo formerly worked in the state’s attorney’s office: Kim Foxx, most recently Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle’s chief of staff; and Donna More, a former federal prosecutor and Illinois Gaming Board attorney. Cook County Commissioner John Fritchey, a former assistant attorney general and state representative, has also said he’s running.\nAlvarez highlights reforms of the office under her tenure, including creation of a new Conviction Integrity Unit to address wrongful convictions, resulting in 13 vacated convictions to date; specialized units to combat human trafficking and violence against women and sexual assault, which has made her a nationally recognized leader for what’s now called the “Chicago Approach”; and alternative sentencing programs to divert first-time and nonviolent offenders.\nAlvarez, who won a crowded 2008 Democratic primary and since then hasn’t faced any significant competition, this time faces a March Democratic primary in which the Cook County Democratic Party — usually a sure bet to endorse incumbents — has declined to back any candidate.\nThe executive vice chairman of the county party, Preckwinkle, is backing Foxx, a former assistant state’s attorney who stepped down as the president’s top aide on Aug. 7 and was instrumental in Preckwinkle’s effort to lower the jail population and reform the juvenile justice system.\nMore, an assistant in the state’s attorney’s office under Richard M. Daley, is a former federal prosecutor who became the first chief legal counsel for the Illinois Gaming Board after its 1990 formation. A campaign contributor to Gov. Bruce Rauner, More is strongly supported by Republicans.\nAlvarez is backed by House Speaker Michael Madigan of Chicago and Ald. Ed Burke (14th).\nShe hasfaced tough criticism in recent years from African-American community leaders who have charged racial bias in her office’s handling of some cases, and others who accuse her office of bias in handling of police misconduct cases.\nShe most recently came under fire for having to fire a prosecutor for lying in a case involving a Chicago police officer; for the failed prosecution of police officer Dante Servin in the killing of a young black woman, Rekia Boyd; and for her office’s botched investigation into the 2004 killing of David Koschman in a Rush Street altercation with Daley nephew Richard J. “R.J.” Vanecko that required a special prosecutor.\n“The role of a prosecutor is not about racking up convictions,” Alvarez says in her video.\n“I’m running for re-election for County State’s Attorney because we have more work to do and I believe that I am the most experienced and most qualified person to get the job done,” Alvarez says.", "external_links": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/6XzNjeDOvqg?feature=oembed"], "published": "2015-10-14T03:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T10:10:41.233+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
