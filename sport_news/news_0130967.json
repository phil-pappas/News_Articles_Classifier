By Associated Press (0) Comments \nHouston — Andre Johnson proved to his former team that he still has plenty left. \nJohnson caught two touchdown passes from Matt Hasselbeck to help the Indianapolis Colts beat the Houston Texans, 27-20, Thursday night. \nReleased by Houston in March after 12 seasons with the team, Johnson had six catches for 77 yards. \nThe Colts (3-2) extended their AFC South winning streak to an NFL-record 16 games. \nBrian Hoyer, who replaced Ryan Mallett for Houston (1-4) in the second quarter, threw a pass up for grabs that was intercepted by Mike Adams with less than 2 minutes left. \nHasselbeck was filling in for Andrew Luck, who missed his second game with a shoulder injury. Hasselbeck may not have been 100%, either, after missing practice Tuesday with an illness. \nDeAndre Hopkins had 11 receptions for 169 yards for Houston. © 2015 , Journal Sentinel Inc.
