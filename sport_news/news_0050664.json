After tough, back-to-back losses to Tri-Cities rivals Geneva and Batavia, the North Stars scored early and often to cruise to their first River Division win of the season. Running back Eric Lins has rushed for 12 touchdowns this season, while quarterback Zach Mettetal leads the area with 16 touchdown passes. \nWhile the River Division title is out of reach with two losses, the North Stars have shifted their focus to finishing the season strong and making a deep run into the postseason. \n\"Our first goal was conference and unfortunately that's unattainable,\" North coach Rob Pomazak said. \"We have to respond from here on out and continue to play the way we know we're capable. We know we are a very good football team here.\" \nExtra point: North senior wide receiver Jayson Reckards received a scholarship offer from NCAA Division-I Valparaiso this week. \nElgin (0-6, 0-3 UEC River) at Batavia (5-1, 3-0 UEC River), 7:30 p.m. today \nLast week's results: Elgin lost to Streamwood, 22-15; Batavia lost to Naperville Central, 34-14. \nThe skinny: As if Elgin wasn't already enough of an underdog, Batavia comes into this matchup after suffering its first loss of the season. Bulldogs coach Dennis Piron will use this game to correct some of the mistakes made against Naperville Central, but the Maroons will be outmatched in this one. \nThe idea of overlooking the game, with the River Division title looming next week in a showdown at Geneva, will not be an issue for the team's senior leaders. \n\"We can't wait to get back in the field,\" wide receiver Canaan Coffey said. \"(Last week) hurt pretty bad and we don't want to have that feeling anymore.\" \nExtra point: A win Friday would push Batavia's UEC River win streak to 29 games. \nSt. Charles East (2-4, 2-2 UEC River) at Larkin (0-6, 0-3 UEC River), 7:30 p.m. today \nLast week's results: St. Charles East lost to Geneva, 27-26; Larkin lost to St. Charles North, 55-7. \nThe skinny: What almost was for St. Charles East. The Saints were 2:12 away from pulling off the upset of the season to spoil Geneva's homecoming, but it ended in heartbreak, and more importantly, a real knock against the Saints' playoff hopes. \nFreshman call-up Justin Jett has given the Saints another option in the run game and has given senior Cam Canales more room to run from the wing position of the triple-option offense. \nExtra point: The Saints will be without strong-legged kicker Nick Candre for the next two weeks, so fourth downs could become more important moving forward. \nKaneland (3-3, 1-2 Northern Illinois Big 12 Conference East Division) at Morris (3-3, 1-2 NI Big 12 East), 7:15 p.m. today \nLast week's results: Kaneland lost to Sycamore, 35-7; Morris lost to DeKalb, 35-21. \nThe skinny: The longtime rivals duke it out again, but not from their usual perch in the standings. While both have been known as serious playoff contenders in past years, the Knights and Morris come in having won and lost in the same weeks. \nKaneland QB Jake Marczuk has struggled of late, and coach Tom Fedderly said he needs to see more out of his senior leader and the rest of the team. \n\"Everyone needs to play better,\" Fedderly said. \nExtra point: Both teams are searching for signature wins. The three opponents Kaneland beat have a combined record of 9-9, while Morris' wins have come against teams that are 6-12. \nMarmion (2-4, 0-2 Chicago Catholic League Green Division) at De La Salle (2-4, 1-1 CCL Green), 7:30 p.m. today \nLast week's results: Marmion lost to Fenwick, 42-21; De La Salle beat Lake Forest, 47-12. \nThe skinny: The good news for Marmion is starting quarterback Johnny Tate returned from an ankle injury against Fenwick. The bad news is that still only gives the Cadets 23 healthy players to send out on the field. \nTate's return does provide some leadership and experience to a Marmion offense that has struggled to score points. Last week's total of 21 points was the same amount of points that Marmion scored in its three previous games combined. \nExtra point: Marmion is in the same boat as a few area teams, needing to win its remaining three games to become playoff eligible. \nSt. Francis (4-2, 1-0 CCL Green) at Montini (6-0, 1-0 CCL Green), 7:30 p.m. today \nLast week's results: St. Francis lost to St. Laurence, 49-35; Montini shut out St. Joseph, 42-0. \nThe skinny: It doesn't get any easier for St. Francis after a loss in Week 6, heading to face unbeaten powerhouse Montini. \nThe Spartans have shown that they can put up points, but there's no question Montini will have the best defense St. Francis quarterback Peter Fassnacht has seen this season. Coach Mike Fitzgerald will hope that his team can have long drives to keep the ball and the Broncos offense on the sidelines. \nExtra point: Montini enters the game with three straight shutouts and has allowed 38 points in six games overall. \nBurlington Central (0-6, 0-3 Big Northern Conference East Division) at Richmond-Burton (5-1, 3-1 BNC East), 7 p.m. today \nLast wee's results: Burlington Central was shut out by Marengo, 40-0; Richmond-Burton beat Rockford Christian, 55-14. \nThe skinny: The search continues for win No. 1 for Burlington Central as a tough Richmond-Burton side awaits. R-B can find the end zone and has shown signs of dominance, while BC has had trouble all season finding consistency on both sides of the ball. \nExtra point: BC is averaging under 10 points per game this season, while R-B averages just under 30 points scored.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T06:42:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:50:38.884+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
