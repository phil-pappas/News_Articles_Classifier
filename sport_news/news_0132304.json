(Photo: David Guralnick / Detroit News) \n1 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 2 COMMENT EMAIL MORE Ann Arbor — Michigan's defensive players have a certain air these days.\nIt's confidence, with an understanding that what has vaulted them to the upper echelons of the national rankings is not to be taken for granted.\nBut this week, after two dominating victories over BYU (31-0) and Maryland (28-0), No. 18 Michigan faces another like-minded defensive team in Northwestern, unbeaten and ranked No. 13.\nIt looks more like a tale of the tape.\n■ Northwestern is No. 1 in scoring defense at 7.0 points, while Michigan is No. 2 at 7.6.\n■ Michigan is No. 1 in third-down percentage defense at .194, with Northwestern No. 2 at .200.\n■ Michigan is No. 2 in total defense at 184.0 yards, while Northwestern is No. 5 at 247.4 yards.\nBut ...\n\"The two defenses won't go against each other in the game,\" Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said with a smile Monday.\nStill, Michigan and Northwestern are playing defense well.\n\"I think our goal is to be the best defense in the country.\" Michigan defensive lineman Ryan Glasgow said. \"We don't really shy away from talking about that.\nDETROIT NEWS\nHarbaugh on Rudock: 'His job is to win'\n\"But the main key that is stressed every week is you have to remember what got you to such a defensive performance. You can't just think because you did it one time you're going to do it again automatically. It's about how you practice, it's about how you prepare and it's about how you watch film, and we've been doing a pretty good job of that the past couple of weeks.\"\nHarbaugh, though, has high praise for Northwestern and its early-season performance.\n\"As athletic and fast as we've seen,\" Harbaugh said. \"Play great team defense. This team reacts and flows to the ball as good as you're going to see in college football.\"\nThe Wolverines, who have held their last two opponents to 105 yards offense, forced 12 three-and-outs from Maryland last weekend.\nAnd since the first quarter against Oregon State in Week 2, Michigan has allowed one touchdown and outscored opponents 119-7.\n\"It's really painful to watch teams put 60, 70 points up on the board each week,\" senior linebacker and captain Joe Bolden said. \"That's not football, that's a basketball score. It's not how football is supposed to be. Football is supposed to be run downhill at one another and whoever executes and gets their job done the best on that play will win that play. The more plays you win, the more chance you have to win the game.\"\nMichigan linebacker Joe Bolden talks about the loss of Mario Ojemudia. Angelique S. Chengelis, Detroit News \nGlasgow stressed that practice has been vital to the success of the defense. And, he attributed their success on third down to the third-down period each week in which the No. 1 offense goes against the No. 1 defense.\n\"And get after it and get after each other,\" Glasgow said. \"I think that's helped a lot.\"\nThe defensive performances have not been lost on Michigan's offensive players.\nWhile Michigan's offense is not lighting up the national statistics, it has focused on establishing the run. The Wolverines are 35th in rushing offense at 201.4 yards.\nBut through five games, Michigan has found its direction through defense.\n\"The defense is killing it, right? They're doing great,\" offensive lineman Graham Glasgow said. \"When we see the defense going out there doing their jobs, we want to go out there and try to put some points on the board and make sure what they did doesn't go to waste.\n\"Even against Utah (in the opener), I could see that they were going to be a good defense. We had a pick-six that game, so they only gave up 17 points. ... From that point on, just going against them in practice, watching them perform, especially the past few weeks, has reinforced that feeling I had that they would be really good.\"\nachengelis@detroitnews.com \ntwitter.com/chengelis \n\nNorthwestern at Michigan \nKickoff: 3:30 p.m. Saturday, Michigan Stadium, Ann Arbor\nTV/radio: BTN/WWJ\nRecords: No. 13 Northwestern 5-0, 1-0 Big Ten; No. 18 Michigan 4-1, 1-0\nLine: Michigan by 8\nSeries: Michigan leads 56-15-2 (Michigan 10-9, Nov. 8, 2014)\nDid you know?
