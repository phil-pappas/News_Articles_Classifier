(David Banks/Getty Images/AFP) By : Reuters | on 3:00 PM October 12,   Athletics \nKenyan Dickson Chumba pulled away from compatriot Sammy Kitwara and comfortably won a slow Chicago Marathon in a sweep for the African nation on Sunday. \nChumba , wearing a bright yellow singlet, clocked 2 hours 9 minutes 25 seconds as twice runner-up Kitwara recorded his fourth consecutive top-four finish, placing 25 seconds behind. \nChumba broke up a tactical race with a surge after about 30 km and gradually increased his lead over Kitwara. \n\"The race was good, but the pace was slow to 30 km,\" said the 28-year-old, who won the Tokyo marathon in 2014 and finished third there this year. \nKenyan Sammy Ndungu took third in 2:10:06, followed by Ethiopian Girmay Birhanu Gebru and surprising American Luke Puskedra. \nKenya's world half- marathon record holder Florence Kiplagat claimed the women's race, breaking away at 40 km to win in 2:23:33. \n\"The course for me was very nice,\" a smiling Kiplagat told reporters. \"It was a flat course, sometimes it's windy, but that is part of competition.\" \nEthiopians Yebrgual Melese and Birhane Dibaba took the next two spots with Melese 10 seconds adrift of Kiplagat. \nEarly leader Kayoko Fukushi of Japan finished fourth, just one second behind Dibaba in 2:24:25. \nDeena Kastor, aged 42, took seventh in a US masters record 2:27:47. \nNo pace-setters \nThe race was run without pace-setters for the first time in 26 years and it noticeably affected times and strategy on the flat, typically fast course with Chumba 's winning time the slow est in eight years. \nAs many as 10 runners were in the lead pack through the first half of the race as Chumba , Kitwara and others let first-time marathon er Elkanah Kibet, a Kenyan-born American, set the pace. He finished seventh. \nOnly when Chumba made his move did the pace pick up with the Kenyan, Kitwara and Ethiopian Abera Kuma forming a group of three before Kuma, who was running his fifth marathon in 20 months, faded. \nMost top American men and women skipped the race to prepare for February's US Olympic marathon trials. \nAmerican Tatyana McFadden won the women's wheelchair race for a sixth time and Australian Kurt Fearnley took the men's event with McFadden and top US men's finisher Josh George, who was third, qualifying for the 2016 Rio Paralympics. \nReuters", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T04:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T04:14:48.688+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
