There will be player introductions, which is a necessity for the UW men’s team that brought in nine newcomers. \nPlayers will participate in basketball drills and they’re also expected to perform a dance routine. \n“We (the women’s team) worked with the cheerleaders and plan to have some fun with it,” junior star guard Kelsey Plum said last week. \nAnd the UW men? \n“I don’t think they practiced for this at all so we’ll see,” she said smiling. \nIt’s the only public appearance for the UW teams before their exhibition games. The Husky women host Concordia (Oregon) on Nov. 2 and the UW men play Seattle Pacific University on Nov. 5 at Hec Edmundson Pavilion. \n\n\nPercy Allen : 206-464-2278 or pallen@seattletimes.com ; on Twitter: @percyallen .
