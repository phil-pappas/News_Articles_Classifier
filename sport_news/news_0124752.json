The company said in a statement that it takes allegations of discrimination very seriously and has hired a former FBI agent to investigate.\nThe women said many of them were part of a book club that meets regularly and had gathered on the train to discuss a romance novel. Before the train left the station in Napa, a train employee asked them to quiet down because they were offending other passengers, they said.\nThe same employee admonished them a second time before telling them that police officers would be waiting for them when the train reached St. Helena, the suit says. They were escorted through several cars as other passengers stared and then off the train and into a dirt lot where police were waiting, according to the suit.\n\"That was the most humiliating experience that I have ever had in my entire life,\" Lisa Johnson, 47, said with tears in her eyes, appearing with some of the other women at a news conference announcing the lawsuit. \"This is 2015, and this just cannot happen again.\"\nThe wine train issued an apology after the women were ejected, promising additional training for employees on cultural diversity and sensitivity and free passes for a future trip.\nThe lawsuit also claims the women were defamed by a company statement saying they had been verbally and physically abusive.\nTheir removal led to discussion online under the hashtag, #laughingwhileblack. The women wore black buttons with the hashtag at Thursday's news conference.\nKatherine Neal, 85, the oldest woman in the group, said she was reminded of when she was about 12 and a store clerk asked her to eat her ice cream outside while white families ate inside.\n\"I took this case because it's an egregious case,\" said the women's attorney, Waukeen McCoy. \"This lawsuit highlights that blacks are still being treated differently in America.\"\nMcCoy said he engaged in settlement talks with the company, but it did not make an offer.\nThe Napa Valley Wine Train offers food and wine to passengers as they visit Napa County wineries in updated Pullman cars.\nA spokesman for the company, Sam Singer, has said individuals or groups are asked to get off the wine train once a month on average for various reasons.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
