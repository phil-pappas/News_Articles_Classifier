Holzer was acquired from Toronto at the NHL trade deadline last March but never appeared in a contest as the Ducks also got James Wisniewski and rode their regular six defenders in the playoffs.\nBeing down on the Ducks’ depth chart didn’t keep him from signing a one-year, $750,000 extension with the club in July. With a shot at claiming the seventh defenseman spot in training camp, Holzer got his first action with the club in an early preseason game at San Jose.\nJust more than five minutes into the first period, Sharks forward Frazer McLaren hit Holzer and put him out of the game with an unspecified head injury. As Holzer recovered off the ice, Josh Manson had a great camp and grabbed the spot.\n“It was pretty frustrating, I would say that,” Holzer said. “Not even playing one period, it (stunk). It was just bad. You start doubting yourself, asking ‘What’s going on? What’s happening?’ It was unfortunate.”\nHolzer got his second chance as the Ducks recalled him and Shea Theodore from the San Diego Gulls with the need to put defensemen Simon Despres and Clayton Stoner on injured reserve.\nIt appeared that Theodore, one of their top two prospects, might make his NHL debut but Boudreau went with the more experienced Holzer. Holzer played in 58 games with the Maple Leafs, including 34 last season before the trade.\nBefore getting his chance Sunday against Minnesota, Holzer played two games with the San Diego Gulls in the American Hockey League. The native of Munich, Germany estimated that he hadn’t played “for several months almost, if you include the summer.”\n“You got to stick with it,” Holzer said. “You got to be mentally strong, going through those valleys sometimes. It’s just one of those things where you got to stay engaged mentally. Obviously a head injury is always going to be worried about.\n“You just got to take it day by day in this league. It was unfortunate that (the injury) happened in the preseason and I couldn’t do anything after that.”\n\nSANTORELLI SCORES \nMike Santorelli played less than 9 1/2 minutes in his return to the lineup but the winger made it count.\nClinging to a 2-1 lead midway through the third, the Ducks gained possession of the puck and put together a scoring play. It didn’t come from their stars Ryan Getzlaf or Corey Perry , but from their fourth line.\nThe well-traveled Santorelli got his first goal with his latest team, putting a rebound between the pads of Wild goalie Devan Dubnyk after an initial point-blank stop on Shawn Horcoff off a pass from Patrick Maroon.\n“We were kind of just behind the net and Patty (Maroon) made a good throw out to Horton and he shot the puck, and I … was just lucky to hit it in,” Santorelli said.\nHorcoff and Santorelli returned to the lineup after being scratched in Friday’s home loss to Colorado.\nWAGNER CLEARS WAIVERS \nCenter Chris Wagner cleared waivers Sunday but remained with the Ducks. Wagner didn’t play after making his season debut Friday against Colorado, playing a shade more than 11 minutes.\nOne reason to put Wagner on waivers was that it is often easier to push players through early in the season. The Ducks aren’t sending him to the AHL but have the option to do so within the next 10 games or 30 days without him needing to require waivers again.\nContact the writer: estephens@ocregister.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T16:14:13.021+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
