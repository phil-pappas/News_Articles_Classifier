Less than a year removed from ACL surgery that ended his career at the University of Georgia, finished Sunday with 146 rushing yards on 19 carries.\nNext up for the Rams is a Sunday showdown with the Green Bay Packers at Lambeau Field.\nWith the game on the line and holding a 17-15 lead, the Rams responded with a six-play, 80-yard drive capped by a 12-yard scoring pass from Nick Foles to Tavon Austin to make it 24-15 with 8:16 to play. On the play, Foles withstood heavy pressure and double-pumped to allow Austin to get a step on his defender and make the catch.\nThe highlight play of the drive was a 52-yard run from Gurley, in his second NFL game.\nArizona came right back, moving 80 yards on eight plays, cutting the Rams' lead to 24-22 on a 23-yard pass from Carson Palmer to rookie David Johnson with 4:38 left in regulation. The key play of the drive was a fourth-down pass from Palmer to fellow veteran Larry Fitzgerald.\nThe home team managed to get the ball back with less than three minutes to play. The Cardinals moved into St. Louis territory and faced a second-and-two at the Rams' 43 at the two-minute warning. Robert Quinn batted down a Carson Palmer pass and the veteran quarterback threw high for incomplete passes on third and fourth down.\nThe Rams took over and ran out the clock, thanks to a pair of late Gurley runs.\nThe Cardinals, who entered the game having converted 11 of 12 red-zone chances, were stuffed again on a third-down play from the Rams 11 early in the final quarter. Chandler Catanzaro's fifth field goal of the day, with 11:57 to play, cut the Rams' lead to 17-15.\n(c)2015 St. Louis Post-Dispatch\nVisit the St. Louis Post-Dispatch at www.stltoday.com\nDistributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.\nShare Comment", "external_links": ["http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1732592&h=Rams+defense+keys+24%2D22+win+at+Arizona", "http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1732592&hashtags=ArcaMax", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1732592"], "published": "2015-10-04T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:09:20.468+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
