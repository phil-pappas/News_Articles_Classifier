It was just a matter of who was going to close the best.\"\nLanger won after losing playoffs in the event to David Frost in 2012 and Kenny Perry in 2013.\n\"Losing both playoffs was tough, but I feel like I can play this course well,\" Langer said. \"I can shoot some low scores around here. ... I've had a lot of good finishes on this golf course. I like fast greens, and they're usually faster here than most places.\"\nThree strokes behind defending champion Michael Allen and Scott McCarron entering the round, Langer had eight birdies and one bogey Sunday to finish at 12-under 204 on TPC San Antonio's AT&T Canyons Course.\nIn June in Massachusetts, Langer successfully defended his Senior Players Championship title for his fifth senior major victory.\nDunlap shot a 68.\n\"I knew I was going well,\" Dunlap said. \"It's really tough, proper golf where a lot of pars and the odd birdie here and there is going to hold you in good stead.\"\nAllen and McCarron, making his seventh start on the tour after turning 50 in July, each shot 70 to tie for third at 8 under.\nLanger earned 270 Charles Schwab Cup points to pull within 66 points of leader Colin Montgomerie with two events left. Montgomerie tied for 15th at 3 under after a 72. Jeff Maggert, 39 points behind Montgomerie, withdrew during the second round because of a lingering left calf injury.\nLanger earned $270,000 to top the $2 million mark for the fourth straight year and the sixth time on the tour. He has made $2,065,390.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Allen,", "http://ap.org/", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfrufs.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfiDcj.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAxGGq&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;At", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Watson", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfzdPd.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;BB2D59E&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Bubba", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfBpOP.img&quot;}}", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Langer", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;golf&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live&quot;,&q"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:56:33.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
