That would be peak of the Tigers offense, as they settled for a field goal on their first drive and were held scoreless from then on out.\nThere have been rushing issues in past games, but that wasn’t the case against this time as Russell Hansbrough rushed for 74 yards on nine carries.\nThe offensive line however did take a step back, as the outside tackles struggled all night keeping Lock off the ground. The Gators lead the SEC in sacks going in, and lived up to their reputation as Lock often times had very little time in a clean pocket.\nWhile the line was a factor in Lock’s play, he just did not have the precision that he has shown in previous outings. There were numerous times balls sailed deep and the true freshman looked confused as to why his receivers ran the route they did.\nOne of the turning points in the game came when the Tigers were down 14-3 but in Florida territory, when the speedy Ray Wingo flew open deep.\nLock recognized the open man but threw it so far behind him that either Wingo ran the wrong route or Lock had different plans. Whatever the reason, anytime there’s an open receiver streaking for a would be touchdown, top quarterbacks need to make that throw.\nThe Tigers eventually settled for a 53-yard field goal attempt, which Andrew Baggett missed.\nThis was a pattern for the majority of the game as Mizzou often times abandoned the run completely and relied on Lock’s arm. After the two first big plays on the first drive, Lock only threw for 100 yards for the remainder of the game, including two interceptions.\nLock has the tools to be a very successful quarterback not just in the SEC, but also in the entire nation. With that said, it’s one thing to be successful against subpar defenses like South Carolina, and another to look competitive against the likes of Florida.\nThe true freshman will need to get on the same page as his receivers to ensure the mistakes are kept to a minimum, and the offensive line must slow down the outside attack. It’s a tall task in the SEC but if the Tigers want to compete it’s a necessity.\nThe defense had their issues to start, but eventually found their stride. They were often times placed on short fields or on little rest between possessions, but still applied adequate pressure from the start. After two touchdowns on the first three drives, the Tiger defense didn’t allow another score as Florida’s final seven points came via a Lock interception.\nThe Tigers defense kept them in the game but the offense just could never capitalize. With a loss to No. 11 Florida, that all but seals their chances of repeating as SEC East champions.\nWithout that goal looming, this season turns into more of a rare rebuilding year for Gary Pinkel. Lock has lots to learn from his performance Saturday and will look to improve even more against another tough opponent next week, the Georgia Bulldogs. Kick-off is set for 6:00 p.m. central time from Athens, Georgia.\nCopyright 2015 KCTV (Meredith Corp.)
