Carlos Beltran will turn 39 April 24. Mark Teixeira will be 36 April 11. Brian McCann will turn 32 just before spring training starts. \nIndeed, the Yankees have four players—no, five—who could stand taking extended turns as designated hitter in 2016 . But only one, of course, will be able to. Greg Bird, the 22-year-old sensation, is going to be wedged out of first base because of Teixeira's return and would also benefit from some at-bats at DH. \nRodriguez is the full-time DH with his inability to play defense in any capacity, forcing a few players into the field against the wishes of better judgement with the exception of Teixiera. \nBeltran, who was a below-average defender all season in right field, will be forced to play right again because the Yankees need his switch-hitting bat in the lineup just about every day. The former Gold Glove center fielder will be in the last year of his contract and even manager Joe Girardi said earlier this season Beltran was not in the lineup for his defense . It figures only to decline in 2016. \nMcCann, who's caught 1,280 games in his 11 seasons as a big league catcher, faded in the second half of the year, hitting just .199 from August 1 on. Was that due to fatigue from catching? Hard to say, but his bat is also one they can't afford to be without especially at Yankee Stadium, and he'll have to take the lion's share of games behind the plate once again. \nSince 2005, only two major league catchers have seen more innings behind the plate than McCann. The human knees only have so much in them, and he's signed through 2018. Turns at DH would help preserve him, but it's not likely to happen outside a handful of games. PLUS : Yankees' projected 2016 lineups: Where A-Rod, Texieria fit N.J. Sports Now: The 2015 Yankees exceeded expectations Everyone booing the Yankees in the Bronx on Tuesday night failed to remember what this team was projected to be in spring training. \nWhile Teixeira showed in 2015 that he's still one of the best defenders in the league, the fact remains that he's going to be 36 years old and could use a day or two each week not playing defense. Like Beltran, his switch-hitting bat is invaluable, one the Yankees sorely missed in the last seven weeks of the season. Teixeira, though, is probably the lowest of concerns not getting time at DH. \nAnd after hitting 11 home runs in 43 games this year, it's clear that first baseman Greg Bird can't just not play next season. It wouldn't be shocking if he started to take some fly balls in the outfield during spring training just to get used to the idea. But wouldn't that be nice if his smooth left-handed swing could be in the lineup every time there's a right-handed pitcher at Yankee Stadium? \nWhile Bird has made a seamless transition from catcher to first base (catcher in high school), it's not a lock he'd pick up the outfield just as easily. (Though that transition figures to be easier; first base is an acquired skill.) \nA-Rod swatted 33 home runs in 2015. Matching that in 2016 won't be a guarantee, but it probably wouldn't be too much of a surprise if he hit 20 or more again. His .842 OPS was the highest it's been in five years. Plus, his right-handed bat is crucial in a lineup lacking them. \nToo many bats, not enough gloves. Might be a theme for the Yankees in 2016. \nRyan Hatch may be reached at rhatch@njadvancemedia.com . Follow him on Twitter @ryanhatch .
