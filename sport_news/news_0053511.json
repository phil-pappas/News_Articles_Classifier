He had 13 tackles, including two sacks and three tackles for loss, and forced a fumble in the fourth quarter that Jordan Evans returned 41 yards for a touchdown.\n\"I thought we had a good week of practice and I thought you could see it in everybody's eyes,\" Striker said. \"We really wanted to do good, and everybody wanted a piece of them (the Mountaineers).
