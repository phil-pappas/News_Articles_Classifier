DraftKings retained Greenberg Traurig after conducting its own internal review, according to the company.\nRelated Links FanDuel launches petition DraftKings investor Jonathan Kraft: ‘It should be regulated’ Ad push drew scrutiny Companies have major ambitions According to the DraftKings summary , Pappalardo found that “it was impossible” for DraftKings content manager Ethan Haskell to have used internal information at DraftKings to help him win money on FanDuel, a New York-based company that offers a very similar service.\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below The possibility that Haskell had utilized DraftKings data to win at FanDuel exploded into a major scandal for the industry earlier this fall, after Haskell accidentally published the data and then won $350,000 playing FanDuel the same weekend.\nBut according to the summary, Haskell did not receive the information until 1:40 p.m. on the day of the incident. At that point, he had already submitted his lineup to FanDuel 40 minutes earlier, and the lineup could not be adjusted any further.\nDraftKings had previously offered this explanation for the incident, saying an internal review found Haskell innocent. The outside investigation—which DraftKings says was based on interviews, documents, emails, data, and more—“has confirmed the company’s conclusion,” according to the summary.\nThe incident stirred questions that have lingered even after DraftKings cleared Haskell of wrongdoing about the fairness of the games, the companies’ internal controls, and industry best practices. DraftKings and FanDuel have since announced bans on employees competing in any paid daily fantasy games.\nThe incident also brought calls from officials for regulations and investigations. In Massachusetts, Attorney General Maura Healey has said she was concerned by the incident, and that her “focus is on ensuring that there are proper consumer protections in place.”\nThe industry has faced additional questions about its own legality under state and federal gambling laws. FanDuel has launched a petition to urge lawmakers to keep the games legal.\nDraftKings and FanDuel saw their number of paid entries fall slightly this past NFL weekend, according to industry tracker SuperLobby.com . Usership decreased by about 10 percent for DraftKings and about 3 percent for FanDuel from the last weekend. The last weekend had set records for both companies—despite being the first weekend after the scandal boiled over into mainstream news coverage.\nThe best bars for watching the Patriots:\n Jerry Remy’s: 1265 Boylston St., Boston.
