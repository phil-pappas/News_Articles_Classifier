The city was the biggest in the country. Even with all, that Cubs manager Joe Maddon said he saw no difference in his young team as it prepared for Saturday night's opening game of the National League championship series against the New York Mets at Citi Field. \"I really don't,\" Maddon said before the game. \"I love it. I watched the workout (Friday) and I thought we were pretty much status quo. We're moving on to another city, another series. I didn't sense anything differently. Yes, we're all going to be nervous. Absolutely, that's what it's supposed to be. \"I don't want us to change anything Just go out there and do what we've been doing. Go play. Go do what you've been doing. Don't try to be anybody different or do anything differently.\" In the end, it was the Mets who were more ready for prime time as they beat the Cubs 4-2. The Cubs sent left-hander Jon Lester to the mound against Mets right-hander Matt Harvey. Lester gave up a two-out home run to Daniel Murphy in the first inning. It was Murphy's fourth home run of the postseason. Harvey was flawless against the Cubs through the first four innings, as he struck out six in that time. Anthony Rizzo became the first Cubs baserunner leading off the fifth when Harvey hit him with a pitch. Starlin Castro brought Rizzo home with a line-drive double over the head of center fielder Juan Lagares, who appeared not to get a good read on the ball. Jorge Soler could not move Castro, as he grounded out to third, and that proved costly. Javier Baez singled to left field. Castro was sent home by third-base coach Gary Jones, and Yoenis Cespedes threw Castro out at home plate. The Mets retook the lead in the bottom of the fifth, getting 3 hits. Curtis Granderson drove home the run by dunking a single into center field on an 0-2 pitch from Lester. In the bottom of the sixth, Travis d'Arnaud crushed a 3-1 pitch from Lester over the center field wall for a solo home run. The ball hit the big apple that's hidden in the hitter's background. The Mets added a run in the bottom of the seventh, as they chased Lester, who worked 6⅔ innings, giving up 8 hits and 4 runs. Harvey made it through 7⅔ innings, leaving after another mammoth home run by Kyle Schwarber, his fourth of the post season and third in three games. Harvey gave up 4 hits. The national media, as well as large contingents from Chicago and New York are on hand for this intriguing series between two clubs on the rise. Maddon explained to all that part of the Cubs' cool approach stems from his insistence that no one game is more important than any other. \"I've been talking about it all season, actually,\" he said. \"That was one of the first things I talked about in spring training because you just think about it. You've got a bunch of young guys that a regular- season game can be intimidating to. So from the beginning of the year we've been trying to impress upon them to not treat any day differently, to apply the same amount of weight to every game, whether it's a spring-training game in March or a game in the middle of the season, or hopefully a playoff game at the end of the year. \"Preparation-wise, I like limited preparation right now, believe it or not. I want guys to go out and play baseball. If we have to maybe grab a few more nuggets on some guys who are not necessarily familiar with, but I'd much rather that we go out there and play our game as opposed to being worried about what the other team may do. I think that's a little bit overrated sometimes in our game.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T05:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T07:08:22.787+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
