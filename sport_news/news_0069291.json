Noah Spence and Co. dominated the offensive line, the running game was non-existent (55 yards), and Patrick Towles was making mental mistakes aplenty in the first half. Down 14 with 4:59 to go , the Cats finally found a spark. \n“When you get in those ruts, the only way to get out of them is do simple stuff,” Shannon Dawson said after the game. They had to keep it simple because there wasn’t a play that worked in the first half. “I don’t think we executed anything for three quarters, to be honest with you,” Dawson said. “There wasn’t a call on my sheet that was good. There just wasn’t.” \n“I don’t know if there’s anything I can point to directly, but I feel like everybody as a unit, collectively, we came out sluggish. It wasn’t just one man, two man, it was all of us, “Dorian Baker said. \nTowles, Baker and the rest of the offense still remained optimistic, and finally began executing. They got it out of Patrick’s hands quickly and began putting routine plays together. \n“There was never any point tonight where I thought we were gonna lose the game. I honestly believe that. There were probably 20,000 other people who did, (but) that wasn’t me. That’s not our team,” Towles said. \nTowles and Dawson knew who they needed to get it to – Dorian Baker. “I like the matchup with him with everything,” Dawson said. “We were trying to do that the whole game a lot of times and the ball just wasn’t finding him.” Dorian asked for the ball, and he received. \nOn the final score, it wasn’t originally supposed to be a fade to Baker . They had three receivers on the left side that were going to be primary targets, but Patrick told Dawson and Dorian on the sideline, “If he has 1-on-1, I’m going to him.” Dorian and Pat both made the right read, linking up on the perfectly executed play. \n“He(the defender) actually made a good play on the ball, but I just had to go up over top of him and take it away from him.” Dorian said there wasn’t a chance he was going to let the defender beat him, “There’s no chance. I gotta make that play. 4th and 3. If I don’t, we lose.” \nThis sequence illustrates just how close it was to going the other. Luckily, Dorian doesn’t lose often. \nPhotos by Jason Ballard (@JBallardphoto) Article written by Nick Roush \"Look upon the doughnut, and not upon the hole.\" @RoushKSR 23 responses to “Dawson Kept it Simple, Fed Dorian Baker Down the Stretch” October 4, 2015 at 1:20   \nDawson is a joke.

At home? Classy stuff. \nMaybe the EKU fans just “sounded” loud to him because most of the mighty BBN had already departed for their single-wides. \nDon’t worry, though. The mighty Cats will win 6 this year. Enjoy Shreveport. Houston Cougars October 4, 2015 at 2:52 pm | Permalink \nAw, you finally beat an FBS school this year, and now you want to come talking shit. Adorable. \nGood luck with your hooker scandal. 😘 If true, it’s gonna get REAL ugly for you all.

Time for you to fade into the laughing stock of college football, like you do every year and start bragging about how your on the rise! Lol Ha!

We’ll enjoy Shreveport just fine. 😉 whatwasthat October 4, 2015 at 4:20   \nReally hilarious how these whoreville trolls come back after they manage to win a football game. They are so sad and pathetic, I’m just hoping they are enjoying that 2013 banner now, as it is very likely coming down lol.

Seriously October 4, 2015 at 4:37 pm | Permalink \nCome on now, that offensive line wasn’t helping AT ALL. You really can’t put that much blame on Towles. The dude had a 69% completion rate, which is very lucky considering our O-line was literally invisible. Every play you saw 2 or 3 EKU people on Towles’ tail. We he was able to stay in the pocket and pass, he did pretty well. You focus so much on the QB, you don’t even actually see what the offense is doing. 69% is pretty strong if you ask me. You can’t ask the man to be perfect, but it’s 2x better than Florida. Ha! October 4, 2015 at 4:45   \nI realize we didn’t play our best game last night. I can only imagine what Auburn will do to us if we don’t get our act together. I think it’s time we take a serious look at scouting out new coaches….maybe Stoops and his hires don’t have what we were led to believe. The only good thing in all of this is that we still have a better record than our lil bro. Ha! October 4, 2015 at 5:00 pm | Permalink \nWhat kind of pu$$y steals your screen name?
