Despite chants of \"Johnny\" in the Browns' 27-20 loss to the Oakland Raiders, the 2012 Heisman Trophy winner did not see action just one week after claiming his first career NFL victory.\nPlenty of Aggies did see snaps last week. Here is a look at how they performed.\nAtlanta Falcons: Jake Matthews, OL:\nMatthews and the Falcons offensive line defeated Brandon Weeden and the Dallas Cowboys on Sunday by a score of 39-28. With both Tony Romo and Dez Bryant out, the Cowboys didn't have their usual firepower through the air and were outgained in yards 280 to 220.\nThe Falcons rushing attack also held a 158-127 advantage over the Cowboys. After a slow start in his rookie campaign of '14, the most recent member of the Matthews' clan to arrive in the NFL is having a great bounce back season.\nAnd to think some people were calling Jake Matthews a bust after one injured year. He is predictably very good. https://t.co/DIKdsxF4rT\n— Matt (@FalconsM5) September 28, 2015 Chicago Bears: Martellus Bennett, TE: The Bears' offense fell silent on Sunday as the squad fell to 0-3 with a 26-0 loss to the Seattle Seahawks.\nChicago trailed 6-0 going into the locker room at half time after the Seahawks converted two successful field goal attempts. Seattle returned the opening kick to start the third quarter 105 yards for a TD and never looked back.\nBennett, subject of trade rumors due to the winless start, may see his address change before the end of the year.\nDenver Broncos: Von Miller, LB: Von Miller picked up a QB hit in the Broncos 24-12 victory over the Detroit Lions on Sunday night. The Lions had two TD's on the evening but saw an extra point attempt blocked as well as a failed two-point conversion.\nDetroit Lions: Don Muhlbach, DS: Made appearance in 24-12 loss to Denver Broncos.\nHouston Texans: Randy Bullock (K) and Shane Lechler (P): The Texans got on the board with their first victory of the year thanks to a 19-9 win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\nLechler booted six punts for a total of 266 yards while Bullock went 2/3 on field goals (19, 39) and 1/2 on extra point tries.\nMiami Dolphins: Ryan Tannehill, QB: The Dolphins entered halftime trailing 27-0 to the division rival Buffalo Bills, and the second half was more of the same.\nTannehill and the Dolphins dropped to 1-2 with the loss to Buffalo in Miami's 2015 home debut. Tannehill completed just 26 of 49 pass attempts for 297 yards while throwing three interceptions.\nThe QB finished the game with an 11.7 QBR rating.\nNew York Giants: Damontre Moore, DL: In a 32-21 victory Thursday night over Washington, Moore came away with a tackle.\nPittsburgh Steelers: Cody Wallace, OL: Cody Wallace got the start at center in a 12-6 win over the St. Louis Rams. Michael Vick operated at QB for the Steelers after Ben Roethlisberger went down with an injury.\nSan Diego Chargers: Josh Lambo, K: The Chargers fell to 2-1 after a Week 3 loss to the Vikings. Lambo did not attempt a field goal in the 31-14 contest, but successfully converted both of his extra point attempts.\nSan Francisco 49ers: Tony Jerod-Eddie, DL: A second half touchdown is all the 49ers managed in a 47-7 blowout loss to the Arizona Cardinals. Jerod-Eddie claimed two tackles as San Francisco remains winless on the road and is now 1-2 on the season.\nSeattle Seahawks: Michael Bennett, DL: Michael Bennett gets the last laugh in Week 3 with a victory over his brother Martellus and the Chicago Bears, racking up four tackles in the shutout victory.\nTampa Bay Buccaneers: Mike Evans (WR) and Jorvorski Lane, RB:\nExcluding the final minute, Jameis Winston went 4-for-5 for 72 yards to Mike Evans on first downs, 1-for-10 for 6 yards on 2nd/3rd downs.\n— Greg Auman (@gregauman) September 28, 2015 Evans struggle slightly in the 19-9 loss to the Texans, producing multiple drops. Bucs' rookie QB Jameis Winston targeted the former A&M receiver early and often in the loss, but could not produce a victory.\nEvans finished the day with seven receptions for 101 yards and was targeted with a pass 17 times.\nLane also appeared in the game.\nOn Twitter:\n @BrandonWheeland", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/FalconsM5/status/648504034995892225", "https://twitter.com/gregauman/status/648556118902501377", "https://t.co/DIKdsxF4rT", "https://twitter.com/BrandonWheeland"], "published": "2015-09-29T16:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T05:44:59.082+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
