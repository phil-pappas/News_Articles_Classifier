The WIAA football postseason has officially begun and for the Fond du Lac football team’s head coach, that simple mantra is what it’s all about. \n“We’re just taking it one game at a time,” Gnewuch said. “We’re hoping to improve. Survive and advance.” \nFond du Lac (8-1), the Valley Football Association South champion, earned a No. 1 seed for the 2015 playoffs and hosts an opening-round game on Friday night against No. 8 seed Milwaukee Vincent/Destiny (4-5), which plays in the Milwaukee City-Blackbourn league. \nAfter falling to Marshfield 22-21 in their regular-season finale, there was some question as to whether the Cardinals would receive a top seed, but their grouping — which includes Vincent/Destiny, Milwaukee Riverside, Neenah, Marquette, Milwaukee Morse-Marshall/Juneau/Lang/Carmen NW, Milwaukee Washington/Science/Collegiate and Milwaukee King — was favorable for that still occurring. \n“When the groupings came out last night, I was hoping that we’d be the No. 1 seed based on the other teams in there,” Gnewuch said. “There was no contention. I spoke my piece. We play in a meat-grinder of a conference. We’ve been ranked third in the AP poll and fourth in the coaches poll. As a result, I thought we should be the No. 1 seed and that’s pretty much how it all shook out.” \nAlthough Gnewuch is certainly familiar with No. 4 seed Neenah, a fellow VFA South team, the rest of Fond du Lac’s group is a bit of an unknown. No. 3 seed Marquette has been a power within the WIAA for years, but doesn’t play area teams very often and the rest of the Milwaukee schools typically have only played each other. \nThat in mind, if the Cardinals earn a victory against Vincent/Destiny, a Level 2 game against Neenah — which Fond du Lac defeated 21-0 earlier this year — seems like a possibility. \n“If we take care of business on Friday and Neenah does the same, then we’ll see Neenah in the second round,” Gnewuch. “We’ll see how Marquette and King would shake out in the second round and we could get a potential matchup with Marquette in Level 3, or King for that matter.” \nMeanwhile in Division 5, Winnebago Lutheran (6-3), which finished third in the Flyway Conference, earned a No. 4 seed and hosts No. 5 seed Peshtigo (6-3) of the Marinette &Oconto Conference \nAlso in WLA’s group is Amherst, New Holstein, Bonduel, Kewaunee, Oostburg and Southern Door. Like Gnewuch, Vikings coach John Boggs doesn’t know a ton about the opposition aside from basic knowledge about Amherst, which is widely considered the top team in Division 5. \nBut even with that uncertainty, Winnebago Lutheran is certainly brimming with confidence going into Friday’s matchup with Peshtigo after routing Mayville and Lomira by a combined score of 98-0 to finish the regular season. \n“Our kids believe and know that they are a good football team,” Boggs said. “They feel like they can play with anybody. That makes it a lot of fun to coach. Our whole thing this past week was we wanted to make sure that Lomira didn’t have the chance to move on into the playoffs and we wanted to make sure that we have the chance to move forward. Last night was a continuation of a season-long goal for us.” \nIn Division 6, St. Mary’s Springs (7-2), the second-place finisher in the Flyway, earned a No. 3 seed and will host No. 6 seed Shiocton (4-5) of Central Wisconsin Eight Conference. The Ledgers defeated Shiocton 42-20 in the first week of the regular season, setting up an intriguing postseason rematch. \nAlso in Springs’ group is Marathon, Crandon, Niagara/Goodman/Pembine, Edgar, Crivitz and Iola-Scandinavia. With traditional state powers like the Ledgers, Shiocton and Edgar all being placed in the same group, St. Mary’s Springs coach Bob Hyland was a little frustrated with the WIAA’s decision-making process on that front. \n“At first when I saw the groupings, I couldn’t believe it,” Hyland said. “To me, they don’t consider who are the best teams and how to separate them out. So consequently I'm thinking a No. 3 or No. 4 seed and we’ve got the third seed.” \nSince that Week 1 victory over Shiocton, Hyland believes his squad has improved in a number of ways and is looking forward to the rematch on Friday, which the Ledgers will host at North Fond du Lac. \n“First and foremost, I think our defense has learned how to play the game,” Hyland said. “We replaced nine starters on defense and I think right now they are pretty confident in what they’re doing. ... I think both teams should be better (than in Week 1). Hopefully it’s a good matchup for us.” \nSam Oleson: (920) 907-7930, soleson@gannett.com or follow on Twitter @sam_olesonFDL 163 CONNECT 8 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://fondul.ac/1ROIhoW TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T02:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T05:23:23.657+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
