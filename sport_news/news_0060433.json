It was Jim Dumigan, who has been organizing trips to games for LSU fans for three decades through his business \"Jim Dumigan Sports Travel.\" \nDumigan: \"They've moved the game to Baton Rouge.\" \nKetner: \"What?\" \nDumigan: \"They've moved the game to Baton Rouge.\" \nKetner: \"Hold on.\" \nKetner then asked his wife if she wanted to continue on the trip and visit Charleston, one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country. \n\"No,\" she said. \"There's no sense going to Charleston unless there's an LSU game.\" LSU Tigers fans hold up a sign in support of South Carolina Gamecocks during pregame of a game at Tiger Stadium.

And the plane had not arrived yet. They were on a baggage cart waiting to be loaded.\" \nHe then called Delta, which routinely told him that he would get a ticket refund minus the $200 change fee for each ticket. Then he explained the situation. \n\"Delta was really great about it,\" Ketner said Saturday before the LSU-South Carolina game, which was moved to Tiger Stadium for a 2:30 p.m. kickoff Saturday because of historic flooding throughout South Carolina. \n\"After I explained the situation, the agent said, 'Wait a minute,' and spoke to a supervisor,\" he said. \"She said it was an incident that was completely out of our hands so we got full refunds on ticket exchanges.\" \nThe tickets were $600 apiece, and the Ketners have six months to book another pair of flights for free. Dumigan handled the hotel reservation cancellation for Ketner as he did for the rest of his travel package party. \nThen as a Stadium Club season ticket holder with eight tickets a season, Ketner was able to purchase new tickets for the moved game at $100 apiece. \n\"It all worked out,\" said the 68-year-old Ketner, who grew up in Baton Rouge and went to University High. \"We wanted to get back for the game. I've been going to LSU games since I was a kid in 1955 when the 50-yard line seats were five dollars. We're not missing an LSU game. There was no use being in Charleston unless there was going to be a game in Columbia (two hours southeast of Columbia).\" \nDumigan was able to call, text or email all of his clients before they got to South Carolina. \n\"If he would've called just a few minutes later, we would've been on our way to Charleston,\" he said. \"Just a matter of luck.\" \nKetner knew there was a chance the game could be moved the previous day as South Carolina athletic director Ray Tanner said on Tuesday that Tiger Stadium was a consideration. \n\"I really didn't think they'd move it,\" he said, \"but in the end I'm glad they did.\" Read or Share this story: http://on.wwltv.com/1Log6fk TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T23:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:57:41.320+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
