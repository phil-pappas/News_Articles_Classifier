(Photo: Thanks to Rod Apfelbeck)\n1 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE WYOMING – It wasn’t easy for Wyoming High School’s volleyball team to see head coach Julie Plitt and staff leave.\nAfter five consecutive Cincinnati Hills League titles and numerous tournament runs, Plitt and staff left for Loveland, where her freshman daughter plays.\nEnter Jim DeLong, who spent 11 years at Oak Hills and coached at Beechwood and Highlands high schools in Kentucky before that. When he interviewed, he was told the team had lost 14 seniors over the last two seasons.\nTranslation?\nThis may be the year the Cowboys actually lose a CHL game.\nThey did not.\nFollowing up Plitt’s finale of 24-2 and 14-0 in the league, DeLong’s diggers also went unblemished in the league. At presstime, their only losses came in August to Turpin and Lakota East.\n“They welcomed me with open arms and made the transition very easy,” DeLong said. “It’s a little bit different than what they’re used to, but they’ve been great from the very beginning.”\nNow with six straight CHL championships, Wyoming hasn’t lost a league game since 2009, nor a set in the last two seasons.\nSeniors for the Cowboys are libero Maddie Bahr, right-side hitter Riely Miracle and middle hitter Haley Stewart. Stewart, a 6-foot-2 multi-sport performer at Wyoming, has entertained the thought of playing college volleyball. She currently is the CHL leader in kills.\n“I am hoping so,” DeLong said of Stewart’s college aspirations. “A lot of it depends on where she goes. I sent out some information to Division II and Division III schools for her and it’s going to depend on the feedback she gets from them.”\nHaley’s younger sister, Lindsey, is a sophomore middle hitter and sophomore Lydia Kurtz and junior Reagan Raymer also effectively pound the ball for Wyoming.\nRaymer is second on the team in kills at 5-foot-9 and has moved from a defensive specialist to a threat at the net in DeLong’s system. She also faces other obstacles in her game outside of her opponents.\n“She’s totally deaf in her right ear and wears a hearing aid in her left,” DeLong said. “Sometimes when I get on her right side, she can’t hear me yell, which is probably good for her. She acclimates herself very well. She hears pretty well with her left and reads lips.”\nIn between the kills and grunts up front, Bahr and junior setter Mia Kraft keep the machine rolling. Kraft is the CHL assists leader.\n“She keeps us in drive,” DeLong said.\nThe next drive for the Cowboys is hopefully to Kettering Fairmount to a district date Halloween Night. From there, DeLong would like to extend his first Wyoming season.\n“Our goal is to be different and push through that,” DeLong said. “We’re trying to do things my way and hopefully get a little further down the road in the state tournament.”\n1 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE //cin.ci/1LP0W30", "external_links": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ec4399ee720a95713ae9ae598fdfb3af9c6962d7/c=34-0-567-400&r=x404&c=534x401/local/-/media/2015/10/22/Cincinnati/B9319361680Z.1_20151022125458_000_GN7CABIAG.1-0.jpg", "https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?url=http%3A//cin.ci/1LP0W30&text=Wyoming%20Cowboys%20volleyball%20finds%20perfection%20again&via=enquirer", "http://www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=http%3A//cin.ci/1LP0W30&mini=true", "http://cin.ci/1LP0W30"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:54:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T00:08:10.875+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
