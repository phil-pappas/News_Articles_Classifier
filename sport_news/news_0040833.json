The move was an instant success, with Upton named Academy Player of the Season. \n2 Connor Ronan, midfielder \nA big future is predicted for the 17-year-old, who moved from his local club Rochdale last year. \nShone on the first team’s pre-season tour to France and was an unused substitute for the Capital One Cup win over Barnet in August. \nAn attacking midfielder who is technically superb and has a great eye for a pass, Ronan has impressed boss Kenny Jackett and will look to stake a claim soon. \n3 Niall Ennis, striker \nAged just 16, but has already trained with the first team. \nReportedly being tracked by Manchester United and Chelsea among others but Wolves are hopeful he will sign professional terms when he turns 17 next year. \nAn England under-17 international, Ennis is a local lad who has been with Wolves since the age of seven. A big prospect who Jackett is watching closely. \n4 Harry Burgoyne, goalkeeper \nLudlow-born Burgoyne joined Wolves aged 12. Now 18, he was the hero of the under-19 team that won a European tournament in Germany on a penalty shoot-out in May. \nThen joined the first team on tour in France, and is now on loan at non-league side Lowestoft Town. Could be the latest in a lengthening list of academy goalkeepers to play for Wolves’ first team. \n5 Jordan Allan, striker \nNot exactly an unknown prospect, after hitting the headlines when he became Scottish football’s youngest ever league player, aged 14, after playing for Airdrie. \nWolves snapped him up a year later and Allan, now 16, is due to sign professional terms next summer. \nInjuries have slightly hampered the progress of the Scottish youth international, who is looking to make his mark with the under-18s. \nThe academy is a very different place to when Prosser first started. Back then, all of the staff could fit in one small office. \nNow there are two people alone who work specifically on the nine-to-12 age group. \nThen two more coaches for 13-to-16-year-olds, three coaches for the 17s to 21s. \nThen there's a full-time goalkeeping coach, an assistant academy manager, medical staff, recruitment staff, psychology staff and more – a workforce that has increased considerably in the past two to three years. \nThat’s before the players even get anywhere near the first team. \nYes, academies are big business, and Wolves – as one of 24 Category One clubs — can’t afford to be left behind in what is a fiercely-competitive industry. \nPlayers are sourced locally, first and foremost, but Wolves of course look regionally, nationally and internationally to find the brightest young talents. \nHow then, in a world where teenage sensations can become You Tube phenomena and the ‘next big thing’ before they’ve even starting shaving, do Wolves sell themselves to potential young stars? \nWelshman Prosser said: “First of all, it’s about the pathway to the first-team. \n“You’ve only got to look at our squad with so many academy graduates – and that’s a real benefit when competing with Premier League clubs, or other Championship clubs. \n“We’re a family club, we look after people and they’re treated in the right way. \n“Our very clear strategy is to recruit the best local players first and foremost, so Wolverhampton and the surrounding regions are where we want the nucleus of our boys to come from. \n“Ethan Ebanks-Landell and Danny Batth, for example, have been here since they were eight or nine years old, Jon Flatt the same, Niall Ennis, they’ve been right the way through the system with us \n“We’ve recruited one or two in recent years who the big clubs have been after and they’ve come here because of how they’ve been treated. \n“It’s also about keeping hold of the best players. Touch wood, we’ve not lost a player recently. \n“And Jez Moxey, Kenny Jackett, Kevin Thelwell, Scott Sellars, Jerry Gill, we’ll all play our part in making sure the players are looked after.” \nProsser is in daily contact with head coach Jackett, updating him on the progress of his academy players. \nIf a vacancy crops up in the first-team squad, Jackett needs to know who is ready to make that step up. \nAnd Prosser is keen to leave nothing to chance as he prepares those players to be ready, should Jackett need to call on them. \nHe said: “We’re clear on exactly what the plan is, from under-9s to the first team, there’s a document that details where players currently are. \n\"If there are gaps, then that’s where we may need to recruit externally. Or if they’re not quite ready, but could be in six months it may be a short-term loan. \n“The club will look within first before going out externally. We accept they need to go external now and again. \n\"Very few teams have a team of academy players, but getting to 40 or 50 per cent for us like in recent years means our opportunities have been excellent.” \nWith millions spent on Compton Park and so many staff hired to nurture these youngsters into future football stars, is there too much pressure on them at such a young age? \nProsser said: \"I hope not. Not from within. You do sometimes have to manage expectations of families or agents. \n“We want the players to feel a little bit of pressure, because I think it’s good, they have to have that desire to improve. But we do minimise it.” \nOf course, the majority don’t make it at Wolves. Only a select few will become first-team players. Others go to different clubs, some drop out of the sport altogether. \nProsser admits telling players they haven’t made the grade is the hardest part of his job. \nBut, as in everything else the academy does, he and the staff do all they can – for the player, and the person. \nHe said: \"\"We’ve got a responsibility for them. They’re boys, growing up physically and mentally, we have to look after them, whether it’s their school, social media, their ‘host family,' we’re responsible. \n“It’s not just about the grass. It used to be. But there are more needs for players now.
