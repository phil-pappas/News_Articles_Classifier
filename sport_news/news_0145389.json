Longtime CEO Martin Winterkorn quit last week, but said he was aware of no wrongdoing on his part.\nIn Germany, Stella Pechmann, a spokeswoman for the engine plant in the city of Salzgitter, confirmed a report Wednesday in the Wolfsburger Allgemeine Zeitung daily that a \"special shift\" is being cut as a precaution because of the current situation. The shift had previously been added to deal with high demand.\nSeparately, the Volkswagen Financial Services division is freezing new hiring until the end of the year, though spokesman Stefan Voges told news agency dpa that existing hiring agreements are unaffected.\nThe scandal has raised concerns that the reputation of German automakers and engineering as a whole could be tarnished, though Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said he doesn't see the affair damaging Germany as a business location.\nIn the United States, a spokeswoman for Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan said late on Wednesday that a subpoena for information had been issued to Volkswagen as part of an investigation into the emissions cheating, although details of the request were not disclosed. More than two dozen U.S. states have launched a probe of the carmaker separate from an investigation by the federal government in Washington.\n\"We will emerge from this crisis stronger, too. We learn from crises,\" he was Quote: d as saying in an interview with the RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland group of newspapers. However, \"in the end, VW will no longer be what it was - a lot will change there structurally.\"\nMatthias Mueller, previously the CEO of the Porsche sports car unit, was appointed Friday to succeed Winterkorn. On Wednesday, Porsche appointed Oliver Blume - responsible for production and logistics at the division since 2013 - as its new chief executive.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press.
