The Cardinals (4-1) have a two-game lead in the NFC West. The Lions (0-5) have the dubious distinction of being the NFL's only winless team and are off to their worst start since becoming the league's only 0-16 team in 2008. Palmer was poised and efficient, completing 11 of 14 passes for 161 yards, with a 14-yard pass to Darren Fells, an 18-yard connection to John Brown, and a 2-yard strike to Larry Fitzgerald for scores. Stafford simply struggled, getting picked off on passes well short of receivers and missing at least one wide-open option. He was replaced in the third quarter by Dan Orlovsky. \nÂ© 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.
