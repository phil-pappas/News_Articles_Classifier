The number of players involved and the disciplinary consequences they have received will require forfeiture of the varsity football game on October 16. The team will continue to practice and will resume its game schedule on October 23.\" \nLake Oswego suspended 10 players for the first four games of last season for a violation of team rules. \nThe forfeit will drop the Lakers to a 3-4 record this season. Lake Oswego started the season 3-0 and reached as high as No. 5 in the state's media poll top 10 rankings. \nThe Lakers will return to the field Oct. 23 when they host Newberg. \nClick here for complete KGW High School Sports coverage \nTop local headlines:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T08:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T08:29:56.025+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
