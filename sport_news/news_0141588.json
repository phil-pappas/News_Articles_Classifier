Evidently someone is getting out and living to tell about it. We do have a crime problem, but it does not help to exaggerate and to urge people to hide.”\n“Our city is becoming a disgrace. Crime is rampant and the tourists are talking about it. Charleston is winning by leaps and bounds. Our city government is not doing the job.”\n“Dr. Lockamy: Please take those whistles away from the administrators at Savannah High. Years of blowing whistles at kids and yelling at them to “go to class!” have proven ineffective and counter-productive. Can hardly blame students for being angry and uncooperative after this treatment.”\n“Congratulations! We survived the blood moon!”\n“I mailed a letter to Hinesville from Savannah almost two months ago and they haven’t received it! We need to move the distribution center back to Savannah and do away with this foolishness!”\n“I find Wednesday’s article about the Pope hypocritical.
