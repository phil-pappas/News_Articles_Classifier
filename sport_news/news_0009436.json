For India Jeje Lalpeklhua had equalised in the 28th minute. \nWith team's training severely hampered due to Indian Super League (ISL) preparations, the national team players did not have any motivation as they were practically out after losing the first three matches. \nThis defeat also puts national coach Stephen Constantine's future in doubt as the Indian team under him as gone from bad to worse in the last year or so. \nIndia had the first chance of the game as Francis Fernandes lined up a shot only to see it go inches wide of the post. Turkmenistan managed to take the lead against the run of play just two minutes later as Abylov hit on the counter-attack. \nHowever, India equalised in the 28th minute. The Turkmenistan keeper Mammet Orazmuhammedow parried a shot but Jeje who was lurking in the box kept a nice overhead lob to make it 1-1. The hosts went ahead again in the 60th minute as Amanov's smart finish made it 2-1. \nJeje once again tried to restore parity but his powerful header was directed straight at the keeper who collected it with ease. \nIndia had a golden opportunity to equalize late on in the 86th minute as profligate Robin Singh with only goalkeeper to beat failed to do so. \nThat proved to be the last chance for the Indian team, who now would like to atleast draw if not beat the lowly placed Guam and salvage some of their pride which has been badly dented. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T14:41:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T20:51:24.447+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
