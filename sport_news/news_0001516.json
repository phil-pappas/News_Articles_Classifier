Some 40,000 people have been killed in the fighting.\nThe conflict has surged again since a two-year ceasefire collapsed in July, leaving peace negotiations in tatters, weeks ahead of a general election on Nov. 1.\nThe violence persists despite a PKK call a week ago ordering its forces to halt all actions in Turkey unless attacked.\nThe government has dismissed the move as an election gambit to bolster the pro-Kurdish opposition ahead of the parliamentary election and has said military operations will continue until PKK fighters disarm and leave Turkey.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T08:15:05.566+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
