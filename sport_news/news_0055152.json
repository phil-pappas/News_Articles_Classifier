(Photo: Jerome Miron, USA TODAY Sports)\n2 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Travel back to 2006, before conference realignment, the College Football Playoff and Art Briles’ arrival at Baylor.\nIt’s the Bears’ turn on the dais at Big 12 Conference media days, and cornerback C.J. Wilson, an all-league pick, is asked for his team’s goals for the coming season. To win the conference, he says.\nSilence follows, and then, among a few media members from a state no longer represented in the Big 12, laughter.\nLess than a decade ago, the idea of Baylor winning the Big 12 — a conference that had made the Bears the cellar-dwelling whipping boy since its inception more than a decade before — was, in a word, laughable.\nYeah, times have changed. Back-to-back conference banners wave at tailgates, on the exterior of the program’s impressive indoor practice facility, inside the school’s brand-new stadium. A Heisman Trophy graces the football offices. The Bears have won 30 of their last 34 games, with all four losses coming away from home. Since 2011, Baylor has the best winning percentage of any Football Bowl Subdivision team in Texas.\nUSA TODAY\nBaylor's offense is more unstoppable than ever\nRemember when Baylor football was a punchline? The Bears’ rivals for conference and national championships remember, if wistfully.\nA process that began in 2008 — with the hiring of Briles, formerly of Houston and a legend on Texas’ high-school ranks — has reached its culmination this fall, when Baylor stands as not just the best team in the Big 12 but the best team in college football.\n“It’s something we’ve been doing a long time, and it’s evolving as we’re sitting here,” Briles told USA TODAY Sports in August. “My wife calls me ’10-minute man,’ since I can’t focus on anything longer than 10 minutes. I just think it’s the makeup of our DNA.\nFollow the road to the 2015 College Football Playoff at The Football Four , our home to rate and debate the nation's best. “It’s a program and a system that’s always moving and has a lot of energy … you know, a fearless quality to it that’s not going to worry about outcome as you’re going through the process. We’re not worrying about what the end result is going to be as we’re going through the process, because we trust the process to get us to the end result we want.”\nAnd the Baylor of 2015 looks unbeatable. More specifically, the Baylor that scored 49 points in the first half of a 63-35 win this past Saturday against Texas Tech — a team that nearly defeated TCU a week before — looks unstoppable.\nThis was Baylor at its replicable best, combining the offense that first put this program on the map with a defense that ignores the noise — yards, even points — for three lines in the box score: punts, turnovers and three-and-outs.\nBaylor’s defense has held each of its first four opponents — SMU, Lamar, Rice and Texas Tech — to at least 10 points below their per-game scoring average. Through four games, Baylor is the only team in the country to rank in the top 10 nationally in both passing and rushing offense; the Bears also lead the nation in yards per game, points per game and yards per play. In all, the team paces the FBS in average margin of victory.\nFOR THE WIN\nAt Baylor, getting football down to a science\nThe most recent weekly Playoff Simulation published by USA TODAY Sports projects Baylor as 97% likely to win a Playoff semifinal and 82% likely to win a Playoff title game, unprecedented numbers in the simulation's three-year existence.\nThe Bears have first-round NFL draft picks on both lines — two on defense, in end Shawn Oakman and tackle Andrew Billings. The offense has found in Seth Russell its most electric quarterback since Robert Griffin III, one who can deliver downfield in Briles’ vertical passing game and serve as a vital cog in the running game.\nThrough talent evaluation, player development and a cutting-edge strength and conditioning program, Baylor has married scheme and mentality — the assets that first lifted the program from irrelevance — with one of nation’s strongest collections of talent. Baylor once outscored opponents; this year’s team can outscore or outmuscle every opponent on its schedule.\nThat development, more than anything, speaks to the program’s growth: first, Baylor as the team scheduled on homecoming; then, Baylor as the team no one wanted to play; now, Baylor as the team no one can beat.\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST\nCOLLEGE FOOTBALL VIDEO PLAYLIST Five can't-miss college football games for Week 6 | 02:18 USA Today Sports' George Schroeder breaks down this week's best games.
