The Nationals have fired manager Matt Williams and his coaching staff after a season in which the team went from World Series favorite to failing to make the playoffs. The move comes one day after the Nats finished second in the National League East at 83-79, seven games behind the division-winning New York Mets. Williams spent just two years at the helm after replacing Davey Johnson. Williams was voted NL Manager of the Year in 2014 after guiding Washington to the NL's best record. The team's showing last year prompted the Nationals to exercise his 2016 contract option and led to high expectations. But the Nats never got more than 10 games over .500, and they eventually saw a 4 1/2-game lead become a 9 1/2-game deficit within 69 days. Williams was 179-145 at the helm.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T05:45:55.281+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
