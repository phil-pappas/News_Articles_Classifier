The Eagles, who released Jackson in March 2014, know that feeling, too. \nNeither team has completed a pass for 40 yards or more through three games — only two other teams have failed to do so. Washington led the NFL in that category last season with 20. Jackson alone had 16 such receptions. The Eagles were fifth with 13. \n“We haven’t been getting the big play, and he’s a big reason why,” Gruden said. “I’d say that’s the biggest change. Other guys have stepped up and done a good job, but they’re not DeSean. When you lose your guy who runs really fast and is a heck of a receiver — not only runs the deep balls, but underneath stuff and after the catch — it’s a blow.” \nAnd Jackson loved playing against his former team. Jackson had receptions for 55 and 51 yards when Washington beat the Eagles 27-24 in December, ending the Eagles’ playoff hopes. Jackson had an 81-yard touchdown reception in the first meeting, a 37-34 Eagles’ win. \nThe Eagles were able to compensate for Jackson’s big-play ability last season with Jeremy Maclin as the lead receiver. But Maclin left and signed a free-agent deal with Kansas City. They haven’t been as successful this season. \nEagles quarterback Sam Bradford has yet to complete a pass that traveled 20 yards or more in the air. Jordan Matthews is the Eagles’ leading receiver with 22 catches for 231 yards, working almost exclusively out of the slot. The other four wide receivers have combined for 13 catches for 122 yards. \n“Obviously, it would be great to have balance,” Bradford said. “When you can spread the ball around and get everyone involved, it makes it a lot tougher on a defense to game-plan you, as opposed to when you’re concentrating on getting one or two guys the ball. Then they can get doubled. If we can spread it around to everyone and keep it balanced, it’s to our benefit.” Report: Alonso’s knee injury not season ending \nThe Eagles are still preparing as if Jackson will play against them, just for the chance to burn his former team again. \n“He obviously has a chip on his shoulder, and a sour taste in his mouth about this place,” safety Malcolm Jenkins said. \nJenkins was then asked about Jackson’s impact on a defense: “I think it’s just the awareness of our deep defenders. We’re always going to pay attention to where he is on the field because he’s obviously the one who can blow the top off the coverage the fastest. As a middle of the field player, I’m always going to keep my eyes on where he is and lean toward that way.” \nIf Jackson is not playing, the Eagles can focus more on trying to stop Washington’s running game. That won’t be easy. Washington ranks fourth in the NFL with 143.7 yards rushing per game. Alfred Morris has 199 yards rushing while Matt Jones has 189. \nThe Eagles, meanwhile, have had success stopping the run, ranking second in fewest yards per rushing attempt at 3.1. \n“I’m not beating my chest [about it],” linebacker Connor Barwin said. “We still have two losses and one win. We have a lot to improve on, obviously. We want to continue to be even better against the run. The Redskins’ running game will probably be the strongest running game we’ve faced this year.” \nIt could be even stronger if Jackson plays because the defense will have to account for him, just like Washington’s defense would have to account for the Eagles’ passing game if they are completing the deep pass. \nBradford said it’s just a matter of time. \n“I don’t think we’ve called a lot of deep balls,” Bradford said. “Hopefully, that’s something that we can get to. I think it just depends on what we see as the best matchups, and what we see as favorable. If they present it to us this week, we’ll take advantage of it.” \nWashington, and especially Jackson, would love to do the same. \nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com .
