The unsupported designation comes because she did not rely on outside assistance and instead packed her food, mailing it to food drops along the way and carried her own supplies, water and shelter.\nAnderson arrived at the end of the trail in Fannin County, Georgia on Thursday.\nShe says she broke the trail's unsupported record of 8 days, 9 hours, 38 minutes set in 2013 by Matthew Kirk.", "external_links": ["http://goo.gl/vP9XDS"], "published": "2015-10-02T14:55:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T21:08:16.784+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
