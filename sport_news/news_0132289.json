Governor Dennis Daugaard, the Department of Revenue Motor Vehicle Division and the South Dakota Department of Tourism worked together on the updated look. \nThe state says new plates are necessary as existing plates are aging, being damaged and losing reflectivity. \n\"The 2016 reissue will add up to approximately 1.5 million non-commercial vehicle and motorcycle plates consisting of the standard plate, the emblem plate, personalized plates, amateur radio, low-speed vehicles and the commercial radio plate,\" Department of Revenue Secretary Andy Gerlach said in a release unveiling the design. \nThe first of the newly designed plates will start being issued January 1, 2016.
