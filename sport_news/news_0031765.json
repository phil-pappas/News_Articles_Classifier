(Image Source: Seth Wenig/AP Photo) \nNew York Giants quarterback Eli Manning was named the National Football Conference Offensive Player of the Week for Week 5. \nThe signal caller completed 41 of 54 passes (75.9 percent) for 441 yards and three touchdowns (1 interception). Among his scoring strikes, Manning connected on the game-winner with just 21 seconds left in the game as the G-Men came from behind against the San Francisco 49ers to win 30-27. \nTrailing 27-23, New York took over at their own 18-yard line with 1:41 on the clock and Manning led them on an eight-play, 82-yard drive in 1:24. He connected on a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end Larry Donnell . It was the 32 nd time in his career that Manning led the G-Men to a fourth-quarter comeback. \nWith 41 completions, Manning set a Giants franchise record for a single game. It was his seventh 400-yard game, which is also more than any other Giant. In addition, he passed Phil Simms for the most wins as a starting quarterback in franchise history. Manning has now won 102 games, including the postseason. \nThis is the third time in his 12-year career that Manning has been named the NFC’s Offensive Player of the Week. He was also honored in Week 2 in 2006 and Week 3 in 2011. Only Kerry Collins , who was named the Player of the Week four times, has been honored more among G-Men quarterbacks. \nThe former No. 1 overall pick out of Ole Miss wasn’t the only Giant who was recognized for their effort against the 49ers. \nDefensive end Damontre Moore had three tackles, with two sacks among them, and he forced a fumble. Moore was nominated for NFC Defensive Player of the Week and kicker Josh Brown was among the nominees for NFC Special Teams Player of the Week. Brown was perfect on Sunday night, converting all three point-after tries, as well as all three field goal attempts. \nDaniel Mogollon is a member of the Pro Football Writers of America and the Football Writers Association of America.
