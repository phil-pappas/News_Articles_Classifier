The league must find a balance. Getty Images\nAdChoices The NHL has to start changing things and quickly. The league is known as one of the better sports entities in terms of sensing the winds of change and acting quickly. That being said, they are still in a gray area in terms of wanting to keep the ways of the past while showcasing their stars. When it boils down to it though, their apprehension is hurting the game’s best stars.\nThis was shown to be very true in the early season matchup of the St. Louis Blues and the Winnipeg Jets . Both teams, the Blues in particular, were guilty of high-sticking penalties which have become an epidemic in the league. Much of this has to do with the feather-weight of the sticks compared to the old lumber that players used up until the mid-’90s. It also has to do with a lack of respect and practice. In the past, players used to skate with their stick blades on the ice. Now, their sticks are in the air, pointed directly at the ceiling or in both hands like an axe.\nWhile the NHL has done wonders in attempting to open up the game with more holding and hooking calls, the level of hits that are questionable to dirty has gone on the rise. Much of this is due to outside influence and the constant want of new viewers to the game. Hockey has done what it can to limit fighting without banning fighting. In doing so, they have taken the enforcers out of the game. Skill-wise, this has benefited the league because there are three or four lines of people who have to be able to play the game.\nHowever, on the injury front, there are many more players who are willing to go after the star players because they have no fear of retribution as the league has tried to put everything on the referee’s plate. Again, look to the St. Louis-Winnipeg game for evidence. Though the hit was technically clean, Vladimir Tarasenko was run at early in the game. He managed to avoid it, but could have been knocked cold if he hadn’t seen it.\nTroy Brouwer caught an elbow to the head, in what surely will be called targeting when reviewed by the league. Blues rookie Joel Edmundson was guilty of a bad hit as well, throwing a forearm to a Jets player’s chest at center ice when the puck was nowhere near. Lastly, Dustin Byfuglien had a bone jarring hit on Jay Bouwmeester at the end of the game when the puck had been past for a second or two. He had eyes only on the player.\nNeither the Blues nor the Jets are dirty teams. The entire style of the Jets is fine. But the lack of respect for the opponent in today’s game is frightening. Former Blues player, Kelly Chase even tweeted about it saying that stars like Sidney Crosby, Alexander Ovechkin and Tarasenko will be hit five times more in their careers than Wayne Gretzky, Steve Yzerman or Denis Savard.\nCrosby’s career looked to have been derailed by a string of concussions. The talented Blues are picking up lots of injuries early in the 2015-16 season. The Detroit Red Wings were decimated by injuries two seasons ago. Not all of these things were from dirty plays, but there were enough to look into the issue.\nThe bottom line is that hockey is a violent game. Injuries are inherent in the sport. But you can have good hits without the dirtiness that has crept in. Headhunting is absolutely ridiculous and has to be banned. Players need to be more responsible with their sticks. The league needs to institute some sort of rule that if a player is injured on a hit deemed by the NHL to be dirty, then the offending player should sit as long as the injured player is out. The NFL protects its star players and the NHL must too.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.rantsports.com/nhl/", "http://www.rantsports.com/nhl/teams/st-louis-blues/", "http://www.rantsports.com/nfl/", "http://www.rantsports.com/nhl/teams/winnipeg-jets/", "http://www.rantsports.com/nhl/teams/detroit-red-wings/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T22:16:06.570+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
