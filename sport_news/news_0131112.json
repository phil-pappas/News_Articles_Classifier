The bad news is that many of these birds might not be staying in the state quite as long due to the historic low levels of the Great Salt Lake.\n\"Unless we get a bunch of water, we are going to lose a lot of lofting areas,\" said Blair Stringham, migratory bird coordinator for the Utah Division of Wildlife Resources. \"Those are places where birds hang out in the day. The last couple of years, as soon as we get a decent freeze, the birds move earlier.\"\nThe main reason for this is that ducks use those Great Salt Lake areas to rest and escape hunting pressure, often moving into the freshwater marshes created by humans along the edge of the lake early or late in the day to eat.\nStringham said that most Utah waterfowl management areas were in good shape going into the hunt, though Locomotive Springs' water is lower than normal.\nThe federal Bear River Refuge west of Brigham City reported good water conditions prior to last Saturday's waterfowl opener with units 1A, 2B. 2C and 2D and the northern portions of Unit 3 full. Unit 3B was still filling and Unit 9 is receiving water. As the irrigation season winds to a close, the refuge may get even more water to help hold birds as they migrate.\nStringham said duck hunters can expect to see plenty of teal, mallards, gadwall and pintails. Canada geese are also doing well, with good spring production.\nStringham said that even though ducks may not stay in Utah as long this season, good numbers should be migrating through, especially during storms or early in the season.\n\"Storm fronts push birds out of the state,\" he said. \"But they also bring birds in, so trying to be in the marsh as a storm front approaches is a great idea. And, even if storm fronts aren't pushing birds in, birds still migrate in and stop in the marshes throughout the season.\"\nAs for the upland game seasons, DWR upland game coordinator Jason Robinson said chukar numbers are the highest they have been in 17 years. That hunt began Sept. 26. Robinson said this is only the third time in 20 years chukar numbers have been this high.\n\"Peaks like this are rare,\" he said. \"I encourage hunters to get into the field and take advantage of it.\"\nFactors such as a mild winter coupled with a rainy and warm May that provided newly hatched chicks with plenty of green vegetation and insects to eat helped populations, which are on an up cycle.\nMany of those factors should also help pheasant hunters when that season begins in November.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-07T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:08:11.509+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
