There was a bit of controversy at the end of regulation of Saturday’s 16-13 Bergen Catholic overtime victory over St. Joseph, centering around a clock stoppage and timeouts.\nThe Green Knights, ahead 10-7, were called for a face-mask penalty at the end of a Ryan McCarthy run. The clock was stopped as the officials marked off the penalty down to the St. Joseph 5-yard line, still shy of a first down.\nWith 21 seconds remaining, Bergen Catholic coach Nunzio Campanile began walking out on the football field thinking he was granted a timeout.\n“I actually intended to call a timeout, then I realized I didn’t have one,” Campanile said. “They stopped the clock for the first down/penalty. They stopped the clock so I started walking out there.”\nThe officials were trying to figure out if it was a first down, so the clock wasn’t running. St Joseph coach Augie Hoffmann said the clock never should’ve stopped, but admitted the Crusaders probably would’ve had a chance to run another play before attempting the field goal that tied the game and sent it into overtime.\n“It was hysteria over there,” Hoffmann said. “At the end of the day, they still would have had time to try the field goal. But you just don’t know what would’ve happened.”\nFreshman kicker Mike Kearney kicked the field goal as time expired to force overtime.\n-- Mark J.
