Other people were saying that Kelly's system will never work in the NFL and that the Eagles are destined for failure this year. \nWell, I'm not buying it and here's why: Sam Bradford seems to look more and more comfortable every week. Remember, this was a guy who hadn't played in a regular season game since October 2013 before he made his first start with the Eagles in September. So not only is he rusty, but he's rusty and trying to learn a new offense.\nDespite that, the Eagles have been in a position to win four of their five games this season and as Kelly said this week, the Eagles are two missed field goals away from being 4-1. \nNow, that might sound ridiculous, but it's not, it's what Kelly sees. Some people see a 2-3 Eagles team that's struggling, but Kelly sees a team that's only two or three plays away from being one of the best in the NFL -- and that's exactly what the Eagles looked like in their 39-17 win over New Orleans on Sunday. \nYes, Bradford's still making inexcusable mistakes -- like the two red zone picks he threw against the Saints -- but he's definitely getting better every week. Kelly knows it, Bradford knows it and the rest of the team seems to know it -- even running back DeMarco Murray , who got off to an embarrassingly slow start this season. \n\"There's a lot of playmakers on offense, a lot of new parts. I think everyone is getting a feel for each other,\" Murray said after Sunday's win. \nBradford was also encouraged by Philly's 39-point outburst. \n\"After what we were able to do in the preseason, everybody has been waiting for this,\" Bradford said. \"It's a great feeling. Now, we have to build off it.\"\nThe Eagles lit up New Orleans for 519 yards on Sunday, which marks the third-highest total of the Kelly-era and the fourth-highest total since 2009. Chip Kelly seems to thrive on chaos. (USATSI) Bradford looked more comfortable than he's looked all season and it showed. The Eagles quarterback threw for 333 yards and completed passes to nine different receivers. \nPhilly's ground game also got going on Sunday, as DeMarco Murray ran for 83 yards, which isn't usually an impressive number, but it is when you consider that he had only ran for 47 yards in the three games before that combined. \nThe Eagles offense seems ready to explode, which is bad news for the rest of the NFC East. Think about it, even though the Eagles have \"struggled\" through their first five games, they're still 2-3 and they're only game behind the first place Giants in the NFC East. \nBasically, no one should be writing off the Eagles just yet. Oh, and let's not forget that the last time a Kelly's Eagles started 1-3, they went on to finish 10-6 and make the playoffs. It won't be surprising at all to see that happen again in 2015. \nTeam Grade Analysis Giants 30, 49ers 27 B- Maybe Colin Kaepernick's not the problem in San Francisco. The 49ers quarterback played his best game of the season, but it wasn't enough because the 49ers defense had no answer for anything the Giants did. New York totaled 525 yards in the game, marking only the second time since 2000 that the 49ers have surrendered over 500 yards in total offense to an opponent. B+ Eli Manning just might be the best Manning brother in the NFL. The Giants quarterback was the star of the show on Sunday night, throwing for 441 yards and three TDs. Manning also completed 41 passes, which broke Phil Simms' franchise record of 40 that had stood since 1985. The other hero for the Giants was Larry Donnell, who made an almost impossible 12-yard touchdown catch with just 21 seconds left in the game. Eagles 39, Saints 17 F It might be time for the Saints to tear everything up and start over. Not only did Drew Brees get beat up, but the Saints defense got torched by an Eagles offense that had been struggling. If Sam Bradford hadn't gifted the Saints with two early red zone interceptions, this game could've been uglier. A The Eagles offense will get a lot of credit for this win -- and they should because they put up 519 yards -- but the defense carried its weight too. Philly forced four turnovers and sacked Drew Brees five times. Two of those turnovers were forced fumbles, which came on two separate plays where Fletcher Cox stripped Brees. Bears 18, Chiefs 17 B+ For the better part of three quarters, Bears fans probably did what they do most Sundays: Throw things at their TV and yell at Jay Cutler . Cutler struggled through the game's first three quarters, before engineering two brilliant fourth quarter scoring drives. C- This game couldn't have gone much worse for the Chiefs. Not only did they blow a 17-6 lead over the final eight minutes of the game, but it looks like they also lost Jamaal Charles for the season to a torn ACL. No one in the NFL means more to their offense than Charles does in KC. Sometimes, it seems like Kansas City's offense is almost entirely designed just to get Charles the ball. Bengals 27, Seahawks 24 OT B It's hard to punish the Seahawks too much for this loss: Seattle went on the road against an undefeated team and probably should've won. Pete Carroll will be able to take a lot of positives out of this game: The Seahawks got their first rushing TD of the season, their first interception and they sacked Andy Dalton four times. Going into the game, Dalton had only been sacked a total of two times on the season. A If we were only counting the fourth quarter here, then the Bengals would get an 'A+.' The Bengals were trailing 24-7 with just 13 minutes left and looked to be left for dead when all of the sudden, everything gelled. On defense, the Bengals ended the game by forcing six straight Seahawks punts. On offense, Andy Dalton engineered four scoring drives on the Bengals' final five possessions, which is even more impressive when you consider that he did against the Seahawks defense. Falcons 25, Redskins 19 OT B- Every time the Redskins lose, it seems like it's due to an ugly pick thrown by Kirk Cousins at the worst time possible. That's exactly what happened against Atlanta when Cousins threw a pick-six in OT. To be fair to Cousins though, it's not like he had much help on the ground. The Redskins only rushed for 55 yards in the game. It was only the third time since 2012 that Washington has run for 51 yards or less. B+ The Falcons offense isn't just Matt Ryan to Julio Jones anymore. Devonta Freeman bulldozed the Redskins for 153 yards and a touchdown in the win. The fact that Ryan doesn't have to carry the team is good news for the Falcons offense. Over the past two years (2013-14), the Falcons went 0-7 when Ryan threw multiple interceptions in a game. This year? They're 2-0. And that's thanks in large part to a frighteningly good running game. Buccaneers 38, Jaguars 31 C The good news for Jacksonville is that Blake Bortles had arguably his best game as a pro, throwing for 303 yards and four touchdowns. The bad news is that Bortles' best game couldn't beat the Bucs. The Jaguars offensive line was also bad news. The unit surrendered six sacks to the Bucs defense. B+ It looks like the Buccaneers have figured out a strategy to winning: Give the ball to Doug Martin and let him do his thing. Martin totaled 158 yards in the game and scored three touchdowns in the win. The victory probably felt extra good for Lovie Smith and that's mainly because it was his first win at home since being hired by the Bucs in 2014. Smith is now 1-10 at home. Browns 33, Ravens 30 OT A Forget Johnny Football because now there's Josh Football. Thanks in large part to Josh McCown 's 457 passing yards, the Browns put up over 500 yards of total offense for the first time since 2007 and only the second time since 1988. The Browns were helped big time by tight end Gary Barnidge , who made a ridiculous 18-yard TD catch in the fourth quarter, and finished with 139 receiving yards in the game. C Each loss in Baltimore this season somehow seems worse than the one before it. For the fourth time in four losses, the Ravens led in the fourth quarter, only to watch the lead slip away. This one was especially ugly because the Ravens had a chance to win in regulation, but they coudn't punch the ball in the end zone from Cleveland's four-yard line. Packers 24, Rams 10 D It's a good thing the Rams have Todd Gurley because they don't have much else going for them on offense. Gurley (30 carries, 159 yards), was one of the few bright spots in a game where Nick Foles completed as many touchdown passes to the Packers as he did to the Rams. B For the first time in 1,043 days, Aaron Rodgers threw an interception at Lambeau Field. Fortunately for the Packers though, it didn't seem to matter at all, thanks to a defense that beat up Nick Foles. The Packers sacked Foles three times and picked him off four time, a total that includes a Quentin Rollins 45-yard pick-6 in the first quarter. Bills 14, Titans 13 B- There's ugly wins, there's really ugly wins and then there's what Buffalo did on Sunday. The Bills punted on their first six possessions and the offense looked ugly until Tyrod Taylor decided to win the game with his feet. Taylor rushed for a total of 77 yards on Buffalo's only two scoring drives of the day. That total includes a 22-yard TD run in the third quarter that kept Buffalo in the game. The Bills defense put up a heroic effort considering they were on the field for over 35 minutes. C Every loss hurts, but the Titans are going to be punching themselves over this one. Despite the fact that Buffalo was missing its top-two running backs and its top wide receiver, the Titans somehow still managed to blow a double-digit lead in the second half. The Titans led 10-0 with less than two minutes left in the third quarter. Cardinals 42, Lions 17 A The Cardinals weren't just good on Sunday, they were scary good and that's mainly because they were clicking in all facets of the game. Passing? Carson Palmer went 11 of 14 for 161 yards and 3 TDs. Rushing? Chris Johnson and Andre Ellington combined to average 11.9 yards per carry on a total of 14 carries. That's enough for a first down on EVERY CARRY. Defense? The Cards forced six turnovers for only the fourth time since 2000. Again, this team is scary good. F When you're trailing 35-7 in the fourth quarter and you attempt a field goal instead of going for it on fourth down, it kind of feels like you're giving up, which is funny because the Lions did that and it kind of felt like they gave up against Arizona. Patriots 30, Cowboys 6 A Tom Brady 's scorched earth tour blazed through Dallas on Sunday and the Cowboys couldn't do anything to stop it. Brady was almost perfect, throwing for 275 yards and two touchdowns. That being said, Julian Edelman might've been the player of the game. The Cowboys had an answer for the diminutive receiver, who finished with 120 yards and a touchdown. D Tony Romo and Dez Bryant can still save the season, but if they don't get back soon, there might not be a season to save. The only bright spot in this game for Dallas was the play of Rolando McClain and Greg Hardy . The two players, who just returned from suspension this week, combined for 3 sacks and 13 total tackles. Broncos 16, Raiders 10 B The Broncos almost didn't need their offense at all on Sunday as kicker Brandon McManus and the defense combined to score all 16 points. A Chris Harris pick-6 was the big play, but Von Miller also came up big with a strip sack in the third quarter that led to a field goal. The Broncos sacked Derek Carr a total of four times. If you're wondering what Peyton Manning did, it wasn't pretty: He threw zero touchdowns and two interceptions. B- Sebastian Janikowski broke the Raiders record for most games played on Sunday, but it's probably not going to be something he wants to remember after the nightmare of a game he had. The Raiders kicker missed two field goals (40, 38-blocked) in a game the Raiders could've won. The kicker's misses hurt, but not as bad as the inexplicable pick-6 Derek Carr threw with just under 7 minutes left in the game.
