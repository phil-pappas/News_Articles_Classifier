That was the Cougars’ only play of more than 15 yards.\nPark Ridge had taken a 15-12 lead with 9:43 left in the game on a 2-yard keeper by Matthews. His TD capped a 17-play drive that began on the Owls’ 33-yard line.\nPark Ridge took a 7-6 lead at 2:09 of the second quarter when Matthews threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to junior receiver Joshua Lewis. Senior Kurt Nixdorf added the extra point.\nCresskill grabbed a 6-0 lead at 5:01 of the second quarter when Coffey scored on a 3-yard run to cap a 10-play drive that began on the Cougars 20 yard line.
