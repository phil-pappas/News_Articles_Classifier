But his sentence was overturned three times by the Oregon Supreme Court on technicalities, most recently in 2012.\nNow Rogers, 62, again faces a 12-person jury that will decide his fate.\nRogers' guilt isn't in question. Jurors will determine whether he should be executed, serve a true life sentence or be eligible for parole.\nHealy outlined Rogers' atrocities in his opening statement: repeatedly stabbing victims with a kitchen knife, hacksawing the feet off of two of the women and gutting one woman from her sternum to her pelvis.\nOver the next two weeks, prosecutors will detail Rogers' history of escalating violence against women and show that he's likely to commit violent acts in the future.\nRogers' attorneys deferred their opening statement until they present their case.\nThe trial was interrupted briefly when a fire alarm sounded and the courthouse evacuated. An elevator motor caused a burning smell, but everyone returned after about an hour.\nIn his opening statement, Healy led jurors through Rogers' twisted criminal history, making the case for the death penalty.\nIn 1972, when he was 18, Rogers stabbed a 15-year-old girl in the abdomen after he had sex with her. He was placed on five years of probation.\nIn 1976, Rogers hog-tied two female hitchhikers and sexually assaulted them. His probation was revoked and was sentenced to five years in prison.\nRogers was paroled. When he completed his time under supervision, his parole officer asked him if he'd do anything different.\nHealy Quote: d Rogers' chilling response: \"I would not leave a witness next time.\"\nHealy recounted Rogers' increasing brutality.\nBetween 1985 and 1987, Rogers started going on \"dates\" with prostitutes, Healy said.\nHe bought miniature bottles of Smirnoff vodka and mixed it with orange juice and had drinks with the women, Healy said. That habit would become an important piece of evidence in the case against Rogers.\nJurors will hear testimony from a dozen women who survived their encounters with Rogers. Some have died, so stand-ins will read their earlier testimony.\nHe would drive to secluded areas where he would fondle the women's breasts and feet but rarely have sex with them, Healy said.\nHe talked women into simulating bondage. After he gained their trust over time, he convinced some women to let him hog-tie them, Healy said.\nOnce bound, Rogers would torture the women, tracing their breasts, nipples and genitals with a knife.\nThen they would \"see the killer that is Dayton Leroy Rogers,\" Healy said.\n\"I'm either going to cut off your breasts or your ankles, you chose,\" Rogers said to one terrified woman, according to Healy.\nRogers told another woman to smile while he punched her in the face, Healy said.\nThe torture sessions would last as long as six hours, Healy said.\nPolice found six bodies in a forested are east of Molalla. One of the victims had her hands bound behind her with dog collars, Healy said.\nThe prosecutor also recounted the physical evidence that tied Rogers to the crimes: miniature vodka bottles found around the bodies, zippers, bra clasps, jewelry and other metal items found in a woodstove at Rogers' shop along with a pair of bloody boots.\nAfter an hour of cataloging the horrors Rogers visited on his victims, Healy calmly told the jury that Rogers is more than deserving of a death sentence and urged them to give it to him.\nSteve Mayes\nsmayes@oregonian.com\n503-294-5916; @ocmayes", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ocmayes"], "published": "2015-10-14T01:29:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T06:09:18.562+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
