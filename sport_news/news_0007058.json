But, the bacterial media needs to grow for thirty days to get to peak efficiency.\n\"We hope that residents will be understanding and recognize that this brief period with some potential odor issues is necessary in order to control the problem once and for all,\" she said.\nIn a news release from the city, Kenner Mayor Michael Yenni says, \"It's a quality of life issue and we have taken this very, very seriously. I am pleased we are so close to a resolution of this odor issue.\"\nCopyright 2015 WVUE.
