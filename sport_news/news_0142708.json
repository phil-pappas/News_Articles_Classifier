(They also clinch if the Houston Astros lose one of their next three games too.)\n\"Home field advantage is extremely important to us, but I think the one thing that tops home field advantage is health,\" Girardi said. \"Playing guys two games today, to me, is risky in a situation like today where it's cold and wet and rainy. It's not ideal, but I think it's the right thing to do.\"\nRELATED : Yankees' lineup likely to be a makeshift one this weekend in Baltimore Ivan Nova is starting the first game for the Yankees. (Houston plays Saturday at 8:10 p.m.) If New York wins the first game Saturday, Girardi said it may effect how long he allows Luis Severino, Game 2's starter, to pitch. The idea being that if home field is locked up, Severino may only throw a few innings to keep him available on Tuesday in the Wild Card for backup to scheduled starter Masahiro Tanaka.\nThe Yankees lost the season series to Houston, 3-4, meaning if they finish the year with the same record, the Astros win the tie-breaking situation and would host Tuesday's playoff game at Minute Maid Park in Houston.\nDespite the health concerns, Girardi still stressed the importance of playing at home in that game.\n\"I think it's extremely important because obviously you want to play in front of your own fans and our club is built for [Yankee Stadium],\" Girardi said. \"You get to sleep in your own bed. You don't have to travel as much. I think it means a lot, and that's why you'll see us go for it if we have an opportunity.\"\nJust not at the risk of having someone hurt.\nRyan Hatch may be reached at rhatch@njadvancemedia.com .
