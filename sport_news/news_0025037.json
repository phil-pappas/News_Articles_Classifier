The Tigers had only two previous appearances in the AP rankings, for a single week in 2004 and in the season-ending poll last year. They were No. 25 each time.\nSee the AP rankings here.\nThe Tigers also rose five spots to No. 17 in this week’s Amway Coaches Poll, finishing in a tie with Michigan. They had been ranked in the coaches poll for two consecutive weeks, but the magnitude of Saturday’s win assured that a place in the AP poll — and a wave of national attention — would follow.\n\"I just told the team, almost word for word, if you think there have been distractions before, wait until now,\" Memphis coach Justin Fuente said in his postgame press conference. \"Some of y’all in here my be upset with me, but I’m going to continue try to protect them as best I can, to protect the group. But I know those things are going to come, and we’ve got to do a great job of handling it. There’s always challenges, and those will be ours.\"\nThe landscape of college football polls has changed dramatically over the past 50 years, but the Tigers have rarely been ranked this high in any major poll. In 1963, they finished 9-0-1 under coach Billy \"Spook\" Murphy and were No. 14 in the United Press International poll, a previous iteration of the current coaches poll. The AP poll only recognized 10 teams from 1962 to 1967, so Memphis might have appeared in that poll had it recognized 25 teams, as it has done since 1989.\nMemphis (6-0) is bowl-eligible and one of only 14 unbeaten teams in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Saturday’s nationally televised win was the Tigers’ first victory over a ranked opponent since 1996, when they beat quarterback Peyton Manning and then-No. 6 Tennessee. Fans stormed the field at the conclusion of the game as a group of police officers stood at the base of the goal posts, to prevent them from being torn down.\nAmerican Athletic Conference commissioner Mike Aresco told the AP on Sunday that it was \"one of the biggest wins we’ve had\" in the three-year history of the conference.\nThree AAC teams appeared in both the AP and coaches polls this week. Houston is No. 21 in the AP poll and No. 22 in the coaches poll. Temple, which had not appeared in either of the two major polls this season, checked in at No. 22 in the AP poll and No. 24 in the coaches poll. Memphis will play the Cougars and Owls on the road in consecutive weeks next month.", "external_links": ["http://collegefootball.ap.org/poll", "http://media.jrn.com/images/200*146/1018_MASP_umfb21.jpg", "http://app.contenttools.co/polls/2038/embed.js?show_name=yes&show_description=yes&show_sharing_options=yes&show_cover_image=yes", "http://media.jrn.com/designimages/spacer.gif"], "published": "2015-10-19T02:17:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T17:02:01.168+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
