At 60.7 points per game, the offense ranked eighth in the 10-team SWAC in scoring and 314th in Division I. The Tigers played 32 games, and the leading scorer topped out at 15 points or less in 14 of those contests. \nSo it’s not hard to understand why pushing the pace on offense has been one of JSU coach Wayne Brent’s main talking points since the team started its training camp earlier this month. \n“(I want to see) guys get out on the break and go 1-on-1, 2-on-1 or 3-on-1 and converting in transition, so we could get some easy buckets,” Brent said. “We didn’t get any easy baskets last year, then we walked the ball down the court and had to face 5-on-5, and we really weren’t a great shooting team so that made it tougher.” \nBrent said the team essentially scrapped the fast break last season because they didn’t have the guards who could handle the ball, pass and score. \nNow the third-year Tigers coach is counting on the maturation of point guard Yettra Specks and new guards Paris Collins and Haudrick Hilaire to get the wheels turning for the team’s fast break and make life a little easier on offense. \n“There is a chance with this group (for more transition opportunities), because we actually have some guys that can push the basketball, they got some quickness. They can make decisions,” Brent said. “We couldn’t handle the ball and make decisions (last year), so we just took the fast break out … we’re giving them some more freedom (this year).” \nJSU recorded 6.3 steals per game last season, which was around the middle of the pack in Division I. The Tigers did have a defensive rebounding percentage of .718, which led the SWAC. \nIf the Tigers can create some more turnovers and rebound at the same rate this season, there should be plenty of fast-break chances, which could help boost the .387 field-goal percentage they posted last season along with their offensive output. \nNotes \nCBS Sports released its preseason rankings of every Division I team on Tuesday. JSU checked in it at No. 298 (out of 351 teams) … The Tigers will face Baylor and Oregon in two of their first three games this season. The Bears and Ducks were ranked 19th and 23rd by CBS Sports, respectively … Three SWAC teams — Alcorn State, Mississippi Valley State and Grambling — were ranked in the bottom five … Texas Southern was the top SWAC team at No. 208, while Southern came in at 220. \nContact Antonio Morales at amorales2@jackson.gannett.com.
