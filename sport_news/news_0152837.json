Don’t worry, you still have a few days to fix it.\nYour voter card has to match your ID, so spelling mistakes are a problem.\nDorothy Sitek with Elections Canada says if you notice an error, there are some things you can do.\n“With the extended election period, we have time now to make changes,” Sitek notes. “If you need any changes made, you will be issued a replacement card as long as you request those changes before October 13th.”\nYou can use a nickname on your voter card — like Tim, Jim or Jen, for example — versus your legal name, as long as they are not vastly different.\nSitek says if you have any questions, ask your returning officer.\n“If you’re not sure, this is a great time to contact your local Elections Canada office. Your local returning officer is the person who can help.”\nRelated Stories Historic TPP trade deal likely to be announced Sunday Heated exchanges during Friday's federal election debate federal election", "external_links": ["http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res&dir=cir/lis2&document=index&lang=e", "http://www.elections.ca/home.aspx"], "published": "2015-10-04T23:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-05T19:33:48.811+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
