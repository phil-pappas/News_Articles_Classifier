Let's put one in the net here, girls!\" was shouted out by a home fan during Wednesday evening's varsity girls soccer game at Tenney Field. \nBut it never happened. \nLoren Henderson made eight saves for the shutout as visiting Rutland outscored Brattleboro, 3-0, on Senior Night. \n\"We've just been playing a lot of tough Division 1 opponents. It's not that we're getting worse, but these teams are getting better. Rutland has three very good forwards. That was the difference,\" said BUHS coach Edwin de Bruijn. \nHe was referring to Brooke Woodard, Sky Woodard and Jordan DelBianco — a trio that combined for seven shots, two goals and an assist. \nThe Raiders outshot the hosts 13-8. DelBianco put away a pass from Brooke Woodard with 32:19 left in the first half to make it 1-0, freshman Sky Woodard converted on a penalty kick with 16:50 to go in the game, and Maggie Schillinger scored on a rebound with 5:14 showing on the clock. \n\"We're getting better. We're able to give a good team like this a game,\" stated de Bruijn. \nWith Rutland's back line of Grace Schillinger, Elizabeth Anderson, Bethany Garrow and Jenna Gardyne keeping the pressure off of their keeper, all of Brattleboro's shots were from long range. The best chances for the Colonels were a blast from 10 yards out by Bridget Duff that was caught and Morgan Derosia's accurate attempt from the right wing that was somehow denied by a leaping Henderson.

Megyn Ayotte made six stops in that span, while defenders Breanna Sheehan and Gabrielle Carpenter did a nice job of marking the ever dangerous Brooke Woodard and DelBianco respectively. Abby Chapman excited the fans by booting the ball way down field, and Aisha Schor cleared the ball out several times. \nBrattleboro's sell-out crowd went silent when Derosia went down awkwardly in the final minutes. She was later helped over to her bench with an apparent knee injury, before her teammates chanted \"Morgan\" prior to breaking the huddle and finishing the game. \nIt was Senior Night for the Colonels. Morgan Derosia, Aisha Schor, Kira McCloskey, Breanna Sheehan, Jaida Henry, Bridget Duff and Abby Chapman were all honored during halftime. \n\"It's sort of a closure to the season. It's something that the girls really look forward to. For some, this will be one of the last soccer games that they ever play,\" noted de Bruijn. \nThe 4-9 Colonels will finish their regular season by hosting MAU on Friday. They will likely play at No. 2 Colchester in the first round of the Division 1 Tournament next week.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T05:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:27:58.226+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
