San Francisco snapped a four game losing streak with a 5-point win over Baltimore.\nPT1M25S 620 349 ﻿ As it happened: San Francisco v Baltimore Jarryd Hayne made his third blunder in six games but had a relatively quiet outing in the San Francisco 49ers' 25-20 win over the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday (Monday AEDT) at Levi's Stadium.\nHayne's mishap came off his first punt return. After slicing through a number of defenders for a five-yard gain the ball was knocked out of his hands from behind but, luckily for Hayne, it was scooped up by one of his teammates in cornerback Dontae Johnson.\nFumble: Jarryd Hayne spills his first punt return for San Francisco in the win over Baltimore. Photo: AP\nThe 49ers went on to score the opening points of the game courtesy of kicker Phil Dawson.\nAdvertisement The former Parramatta star was expected to have a major impact on the game because of injuries to key 49ers players, most notably Carlos Hyde, but he got his hands on the ball far less than he would have hoped, making just three touches in total.\nHis three punt returns resulted in a fair catch, a fumble and one ball he left.\nHayne's inexperience was on show as well when he failed to block two Ravens defenders, which led to 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick being sacked.\nDespite the minimal impact Hayne had on the game, Kaepernick was back to his dazzling best, passing for 340 yards and two touchdowns as his side ended their four-game losing streak.\nIt was the 49ers' first win since their opening match and it will no doubt please coach Jim Tomsula. As for Baltimore, after high pre-season expectations, they have slumped to their fifth loss in six games.\nThe 49ers' next game is against Seattle on Friday at 11.25am (AEDT).\nThere was far less social media love for Hayne after his quiet showing, with Australian fans wanting more from their code-hopping superstar.\nBack in the win column like pic.twitter.com/qSnLYI1KWW\n— San Francisco 49ers (@49ers) October 18, 2015 Very disappointing game for Jarryd Hayne.
