He's also second in the SEC with 12 rushing touchdowns. (Photo: Scott Halleran, Getty Images) \nAlabama running back Derrick Henry ran for a career-high 236 yards and two touchdowns in last weekend's 41-23 win against Texas A&M. \n“Facing Derrick Henry will be a great challenge,” Jones said. “Obviously, we have to be a great tackling football team because he’s shown the ability to break arm tackles, but also he can make you miss at the second and third levels of a defense.” \nJones said the Vols tight end Neiko Creamer has been used in practice to try to replicate Henry. \nHenry has run for 125 yards or more in four games this season. Henry has scored a touchdown in all seven games Alabama has played this season. Henry is averaging 5.9 yards per carry. \n\"They have complimentary players with diverse skill sets, and that’s what makes them very, very challenging to prepare for,” Jones said. \nTennessee is 4-7 all-time in games played in Tuscaloosa. Before the two teams played in Birmingham. \nThe Vols last won on the road against Alabama on Oct. 25, 2003. \nTennessee plays Alabama at 3:30 p.m. Saturday on CBS. \nNote* Stats on Graphiq charts have not been updated since Alabama's 41-23 win against Texas A&M. 4 CONNECT 5 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.wbir.com/1LLJ3lz TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T20:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T21:07:17.773+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
