The 2013 Almaty World Championships (the first competition in 30 years to not use headgear) showed a marked decrease in the number of concussion's suffered compared to those in the 2011 Baku competition where the use of headgear was in place.\nThe decision was made to change training methods, in order to maintain the improvements, focusing on boxers keeping their heads raised. “Since being introduced in 1984, headguards have brought a psychological cushion that has lead to a passive style of boxing”said, Dr. Khadri of the AIBA Medical Commission. “We need to teach the correct way to box with a better stance with head's up, and that requires ongoing education of boxers and referees”.\nThe commission conducted a series of ‘HEAD'S UP’ workshops in Doha, Qatar, with referees and coaches there for the AIBA World Championships competition. Dr.Wu was emphatic when stating, “It is essential that AIBA fulfill's it’s duty to provide a strong framework within which boxers can develop and excel from grassroots to pro competition. ‘HEAD'S UP’ will now be adopted by the world’s boxing federation’s to help all of our athletes enjoy stable futures in their sport.” The ‘HEADS' UP’charter will be shared by all 196 national federations around the world and the head of the Asian Boxing Confederation, Mr. Serik Konakbayev, was the first to sign.\nNo USA AIBA official extended an invitation to participate in Doha, Qatar, was perhaps coincidence but more than likely it was a stern message sent by the AIBA hierarchy for the USA to either get on board or suffer the consequences. It appears that most of the world no longer sees the USA men as an amateur boxing powerhouse and if that perception is correct, every American boxing fan should be irate.\n USA Boxing finds itself between the proverbial ‘rock and a hard place’as PAL (Police Athletic League) and Golden Gloves decided the use of headgear in elite men's competition mandatory for their events. The PAL National and Golden Gloves National tournaments are no longer Olympic boxing qualifying events because of their refusal to comply, that being a major source of contention. Of note should be the men's U.S. Army team's decision to demand their boxer's wear headgear deprives some of the USA's best men boxer's the opportunity to compete. The time has come for the USA Boxing membership to be vocal and agree to either make a stand and fight or get in step with the rest of the world and offer their allegiance to AIBA and Dr. Ching-Kuo Wu.\nIn Wednesday Finals action of the 2015 AIBA World Championships held in Doha, Qatar, Vasilii Egorov (Russia) vs Joahnys Argilagos (Cuba) light flyweight, Murodjon Akhmadaliev (Uzbekistan) vs Michael Conlan (Ireland) bantamweight, Arlen Lopez (Cuba) vs Bektemir Melikuziev (Uzbekistan) middleweight, Erislandy Savon (Cuba) vs Evgeny Tishchenko (Russia) heavyweight.\nThursday contests conclude the Finals of the 2015 AIBA World Championships with Yosbany Veitia (Cuba) vs Elvin Mamishzada (Azerbaijan) flyweight, Lazado Alvarez (Cuba) vs Albert Selimov (Azerbaijan) lightweight, Joe Ward (Ireland) vs Julio La Cruz (Cuba) light heavyweight, and Ivan Dychko (Kazakhstan) vs Tony Yoka (France) super heavyweight. The dominance of the Cuban Boxing Team is quite impressive, 6 of their boxers making the finals with Russia, Ireland, Uzbekistan and Azerbaijan each sending 2 to finals action while France and Kazakhstan both having one boxer make the finals.\nThe AIBA Executive Committee convened yesterday and confirmed Hamburg, Germany, as the host city of the 2017 AIBA World Championships. Hamburg joins Milan, Baku, Almaty and Doha as previous host nations of the world encompassing tournament.\n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T11:36:32.355+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
