The Warriors shot a team-score 600, tied with Northwest Nazarene’s ‘B’ squad for fifth headed into today’s final round. Oregon Tech set a new Cascade Conference scoring record with a second round of 16-under-par 272, breaking the former mark of 278. The Owls were at 558 for the day. “We were third after round one, distant yes, but showing more of what our talent really looks like,” WWCC coach Mike Rostollan said. “Each member of the team made more bogeys and fewer birdies than they planned to, so tomorrow we hope to reverse that.” Malinen’s day led the Warriors, with Daniel Dolin shooting 150, Tucker Keyes 152, and Dillon George 154. “Lauri (Malinen) was steady all day, just sprinkling in a bogey here and there,” Rostollan said. “His one double had him strip from the waist up to get out of a water hazard — messy — then followed up with some birdies. “In the afternoon round, he made his only 5 on his 18th hole,” he said. “The card was a string of 3s and 4s up till then. “Daniel at 150 was a great effort in getting us into contention. Coming into play after missing last week added incentive for him to do well, and he did. Nothing fancy, just lots and lots of pars and the intermittent bogey.” Walla Walla University’s Brendan Collins shot a 9-over 153 to lead the Wolves. Teammate Cameron Cuenco shot a 160, Cole Henderson shot 168, Jarrett Johnson carded 173 and Cameron Fitzgerald a 174. For the Warriors, Garrett Newswick came in at 155 and Zac Adams at 166. “While we fell back a few strokes in the afternoon we are still only five back (of third place),” Rostollan said. “The guys feel bad about closing the last three holes with too many bogeys because they know that was the difference. Again, we want to reverse that trend and finish strong. Five strokes is surmountable.” Paced by a 7-under-par 65 by co-leader Montana Frame, OIT carded a team score of 272 in the second round, breaking the former mark of 278, set three different times by former member Concordia. Frame is tied with Northwest Nazarene’s Keynan Fanslow atop the leaderboard, as the top Crusader golfer followed a morning 67 with a 3-under 69 in the afternoon round – each carding a 36-hole total of 136. Fanslow helped NNU to a big opening day, sitting just seven strokes (282-283-565) behind the Owls. A 30-stroke gap separates the top two teams from the rest of the field, though the majority of the teams are bunched in a big logjam. Rocky Mountain sits in third (303-292—595), just ahead of Great Falls (302-297—599), WCC (301-299—600), Corban (306-299—605), and host C of I (313-296—609). Northwest Christian (311-302—613) is in a close eighth, followed by Warner Pacific (312-309—621) and WWWU (325-329—654).
