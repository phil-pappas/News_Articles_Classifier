For the second year in a row, the Pirates get offensively handcuffed and pitched out of the playoffs. \nCole vs Arrieta was the prime time matchup we heard about days on end, but is it that surprising that the Cubs 'rocket arm' dominated? \nWhile offensively the Pirates lost their rookie stand out Jung Ho Kang to a knee injury in mid-September, the Buccos were still 11-5 to finish the year, and finished with the second highest win total in the MLB. \nNo, this was about the second straight year of a pitcher coming into Pittsburgh red hot and throwing a career season. In 2015, that pitcher is Jake Arrieta. \nThe 29-year old right hander from Farmington, Missouri, is on a record setting tear. Since the All-Star break, Arrieta has pitched MLB record-low, 0.75 ERA. \nAgainst the Pirates, that success has been season long. Of the 16-Pirates to face Arrieta this year, only three have scored. Only two batted over .200. \nAs the 6'4\" Chicago ace watched his offense take a 3-0 lead in the bottom of the third, the Cubs could all but order their tickets to Saint Louis. The Chi-Town baby bears have finished the 2015 season 16-0 with a three-run lead and Arrieta on the mount. \nGerrit Cole's struggles against Dexter Fowler didn't help their cause either. \nComing into this NL Matchup, Dexter Fowler had more experience facing Gerrit Cole than any other Chicago Cub this season. 12-times they had faced off in the regular season (3 hits, and 3 strike outs). That familiarity payed major dividends Wednesday night, the center fielder accounted for three hits, three runs, and a homer in his first three at bats. \nIn the top of the 4th inning in 2014, the Giants Brandon Crawford launched an Edinson Volquez pitch to the deep seats. That shot, was one the Pirates could not recover from. \nAs Kyle Schwarber sent a two-run shot in the third, Buccos fans begrudgingly showed an exasperated look on their collected face that read, \"not again\". \nJust as the Buccos received a quick ticket out of the playoffs in 2014 to the tune of an 8-0 shut-out, the post-season Jolly Roger remained unraised in 2015 courtesy of a 4-0 shut out. \nThe Pirates have the stars, they have the talent. However, much like the Detroit Pistons in the 1990s, they have matched up against historic talent, that is in their prime, in the worst possible situation. \nThe only difference is in this situation, rather than running into Michael Jordan, Pirates run into Madison Bumgarner and Jake Arrieta. \n####", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T06:23:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T09:30:07.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
