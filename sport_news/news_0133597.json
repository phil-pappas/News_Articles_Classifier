This season, his squad is 3-2 overall and 1-0 in Conference USA play after a sound drubbing of North Texas last week. \nAs a result, people are beginning to take notice. ESPN reporters Mark Schlabach and Brett McMurphy update their respective bowl game projections each week. The Golden Eagles, after having not been in the picture since the start of the season, have emerged as bowl contenders for Schlabach and McMurphy. Schlabach predicts Southern Miss will face off against Arkansas State in the New Orleans Bowl, while McMurphy projects the Golden Eagles will meet Colorado State at the New Mexico Bowl. \nWhen Monken was asked during Monday’s news conference about the talk of his squad getting back to a bowl game after a three-year absence, he said he doesn’t put much stock into what those outside the program think. \n“We have three wins,” he said. “Those are the same people that projected we wouldn’t be worth a (expletive). I don’t get why it would matter if all of the sudden they think we’re going to a bowl. Then, next week, we’re not going to a bowl. Then, the next week … I couldn’t care less. We’re at three (wins). We’re looking for four. That’s it. Eliminate the noise.” \nSenior running back Justice Hayes, a Michigan transfer, buys into his head coach’s mentality. \n“We haven’t accomplished anything,” he said. “We want to go to a bowl game and win the conference. We can’t get to a bowl game at 3-2, and we sure can’t win a championship at 3-2. We have the same goals. We approach every game the same.” \nGetting healthy \nIt’s no secret Southern Miss is hurting on defense. \nSafety Devonta Foster missed his fourth straight game last week with an unspecified injury. Safety Deshadrick Truly missed his second straight. Linebacker Anthony Swain hasn’t played since Texas State. Defensive linemen Draper Riley and Rod Crayton both missed last week’s game against North Texas. \nMonken said Monday there’s a chance most of those players will return for Friday’s game at Marshall. \n“It looks pretty good,” he said. “It’ll be close. The short week doesn’t help, but I’m hopeful we’ll get our safeties back, get Swain back and Riley back. They’ll practice, so we’ll see if they’ll be able to go.” \nMullens picks up C-USA accolade \nA week after throwing for 447 yards and two touchdowns at Nebraska, Golden Eagle quarterback Nick Mullens put up 325 passing yards and four touchdowns through the air in a win over North Texas. \nHe also scored a rushing touchdown against the Mean Green. For his efforts, Mullens was named Conference USA Offensive Player of the Week on Monday. \nIt’s the second time Mullens has won this award for his career, having initially won it following the final game of the 2013 season in which the Golden Eagles defeated UAB 62-27. Southern Miss captured its second league Offensive Player of the Week award in the same season for the first time since Derrick Nix captured it twice during the 2002 campaign. \nMonken is proud of his player, but doesn’t put much stock into superlatives. \n“I hope it doesn’t affect him at all,” he said. “It’s someone else’s opinion of Nick Mullens. And at some point, people thought he couldn’t play. That’s just a distraction. He’s played well. But it’s also a credit to our coaches and our game plans and the players around him.” \nIn addition, Mullens was one of eight quarterbacks in the nation to earn a “Star of the Week” nomination by the Manning Award. 1 CONNECT 3 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.thec-l.com/1LexGmb TOP VIDEOS", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:08:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T08:25:03.795+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
