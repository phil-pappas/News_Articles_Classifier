Still the Chargers (6-0, 3-0 SMAC) were able to come out victorious by defeating SMAC foe Chase, 27-12. Crest was able to overcome penalties and pull away from the Trojans in the second half, but the two teams rallied together for a special moment on the final play of the game. Chase halfback Twink Thompson entered the game and scored a long touchdown of 63 yards that saw both teams celebrate in the end zone with the ballcarrier. Cameron Peeler took over the reins for the Crest offense as quarterback Willie Green II rested a sore shoulder. Halfback Tre Harbison carried plenty of the workload, but three first-half turnovers kept the Chargers from pulling away early. “We didn’t take care of the ball the way we would have liked to but that’s the way it goes,” Crest coach Will Clark said. He also noted that the weather conditions and conditions of the field played a factor in many facets of the game. The first half was a defensive tussle over field position between the two sides. Chase was able to take advantage of a Crest fumble down at the Charger 8-yard line toward the end of the first. On fourth down and goal the visitors’ AJ Potlow was able to force his way into the end zone and put Chase (2-5, 0-4 league) on top 6-0. The ensuing possession by Crest looked to be a defining one. The Chargers picked up two first downs on fourth and short before Peeler hooked up with Tyshun Odom from 16 yards out to put Crest up 7-6, which remained the score until after the half. The second half was a different ball game. Crest came out determined to put Chase away early in the third quarter. Harbison redeemed his first half woes with 89 third-quarter rushing yards and a pair of touchdowns. The Charger defensive unit also held the Trojans offense to a three and out on three of their first four-second half possessions. Despite the headache with penalties, Crest’s Clark was satisfied with how his offensive line battled, and how his whole squad gave a team effort. The defense allowed only 29 total yards before the final play. “We really have to clap for our kids for being unselfish tonight,” he said. Clark also mentioned that the moment with a special needs' player participating at the end of the game was a valuable life lesson for his team stating that “you can still help other people and make their day.” Harbison ran the ball 33 times for 210 yards. Peeler only completed three passes, but they went for a total of 96 yards and two scores.
