The reworked deal that runs through March 31, 2020 was announced on May 21 but the 32-page document signed by Fox, athletic director Greg McGarity and president Jere Morehead was obtained this week via an open records request by the Athens Banner-Herald. A different extension agreed to a year earlier wasn’t signed until near the end of last season. This agreement added two years to his previous contract and increased his total compensation $300,000 annually. It also includes up to $750,000 worth of longevity bonuses through the length of the contract. The new contract allows Fox to leave without owing Georgia any buyout, which is similar in structure to what’s been in football coach Mark Richt’s contract. The buyout if Georgia were to make a change also has been reduced. McGarity’s philosophy has been on second contracts that money shouldn’t determine if a coach should go or stay. If Georgia were to fire Fox with four years left on his contract, he would be paid $2.3 million. The payout would be $1.7 million with three years left, $1.1 million with two years remaining and $500,000 with one year left. Under Fox, Georgia put together back-to-back 20-win seasons for just the third time in program history and reached the NCAA tournament last season for the second time in Fox’s six years at Georgia. The Bulldogs tied for third last season in the SEC and tied for second the previous season. There are bonuses in the contract up to $850,000 per season including doubling postseason bonuses for reaching the NCAA tournament to $50,000 or a Sweet 16 appearance to $100,000. Making a Final Four would be worth an additional $150,000 and an NCAA championship would be another $250,000. As in the previous contract, Fox will get a $50,000 bonus each year for Georgia finishing in the top third of the SEC in both the Graduation Success Rate and Academic Progress Rate. \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T22:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:34:38.161+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
