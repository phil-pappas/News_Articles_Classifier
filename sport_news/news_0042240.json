He's managing \nBy Garry Smits Wed, Oct 7, 2015 @ 8:48 pm | updated Wed, Oct 7, 2015 @ 9:18 pm AP Florida State quarterback Everett Golson throws on the run during a Sept. 18 game against Boston College. \nTALLAHASSEE | Is quarterback Everett Golson, playing a position historically defined at Florida State by daring downfield passing, too conservative? \nWhy does he seem to so frequently grab the low branch on the passing tree? \nSeminole fans who have experienced 27 games in the Jimbo Fisher Era, in which the team topped 40 points, for an average of 5.4 times per season (almost exactly the average in Bobby Bowden’s “dynasty years” of 1987-2000, 5.6 per season), are curious as to when the offense will erupt. \nGolson averages 11.6 yards per completion so far this season, 2.6 yards less than Jameis Winston’s career mark, and had 13 completions of 8 yards or less last week in a 24-16 victory over Wake Forest — seven of 5 yards or less. \nPut into perspective, there have been 16 times in the previous 20 years when an FSU quarterback completed at least 100 passes in a season and had a higher average per completion. \nFSU has scored 131 points in the first four games, an average of 32.75. That’s the lowest in the first four games of a season since Fisher became the coach in 2010. \nWhere are the deep shots downfield? Is it because a young group of wide receivers aren’t getting open, or because a young offensive line isn’t giving Golson the time? \nOr is it because Golson received so much criticism last season at Notre Dame when he turned the ball over 26 times, 14 of them interceptions, that he is being even more cautious? Since the Seminoles are the only team in the nation without an offensive turnovers, isn’t efficiency better than taking risks? \nNo one knows Golson’s side of the story. Since Florida State’s preseason media day on Aug. 9, he has not talked to the media. It’s unclear whether that’s his choice or Fisher’s. The FSU sports information department’s official line is that “Golson hasn’t been made available by FSU.” \nFisher doesn’t think Golson needs to explain a thing. The 12th-ranked Seminoles are 4-0 entering Saturday’s game against Miami. In addition to going four games without a turnover, Golson is fourth in the ACC in passer rating (148.2), tied for second in touchdown passes (seven) and fifth in passing yards per game (196.5). \n“He manages the game, takes care of the football ... he wins and he leads his team,” Fisher said following an FSU practice, glancing to his right a few times at the sight of Golson working overtime with his receivers 20 yards away. “He’s making great progress in what we’re doing and we’re winning football games.” \nFair enough. What coach wouldn’t treasure an unbeaten quarterback with a goose egg under the interception category? \n“He’s doing a great job with his execution and his decision-making and managing the game,” Miami coach Al Golden said. \nHowever, being described as a “game manager” doesn’t always have positive implications. Golson’s statistics are pedestrian when measured against past FSU quarterbacks, especially his immediate predecessor. \nMore nagging is the fact that with the exception of a 59-16 rout over Texas State to open the season, Golson has yet to play a complete game. \nHe was 1-of-9 for 6 yards and was sacked twice in the first half against South Florida, when the score was tied 7-7. Golson then completed 7-of-10 passes for 96 yards and a touchdown in leading three scoring drives in the third quarter to put the game away. \nAgainst Boston College, Golson looked like Winston incarnate on the first possession, completing 5-of-5 passes for 50 yards and a 9-yard TD pass to Travis Rudolph. For the remainder of the game, he was 10-of-19 for 69 yards and the ’Noles didn’t score another offensive touchdown. \nWith a 24-10 lead over Wake Forest last week, albeit on a wet and windy day, Golson completed 1-of-4 passes for 3 yards and was sacked twice in the fourth quarter. The Seminoles had to punt on both possessions and the Deacons cut the lead to 24-16 and had a first down at the FSU 20 before Tyler Hunter intercepted a pass in the end zone. \nAfter the game, Fisher criticized his team for not having a killer instinct. \nThe Seminoles combined to score 38 points in their first two ACC games. The last time FSU put up less than that in its first two ACC games was in 2006, a 13-10 victory over Miami and a 27-20 loss to Clemson. \nThere’s little doubt that Golson will have to be more of a playmaker with tougher games on the horizon. Saturday, against the Hurricanes, for example, followed by Louisville the next week, at Georgia Tech on Oct. 24, at Clemson on Nov. 7 and at Florida on Nov. 28. \nJesus Wilson, second on the team in receiving with 15 catches for 215 yards, made an implied agreement that the offense has yet to show up for a full game. \n“If we play Florida State football, there should be no question we’ll be able to finish the game and start strong,” he said. \nIf. \nFisher said results, not aesthetics, are all that matter at this point. \n“It’s not about offense or defense, it’s about team,” Fisher said. “It’s what kind of team you have and how they play together. You go to the confidence in what you’re doing. He’s been pretty sharp with the ball. He’s done very well.” \nGolson may well agree. For now, his performances will have to do all the talking.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T03:48:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T16:48:32.754+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
