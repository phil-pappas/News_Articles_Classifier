But the bigger concern is the lack of physicality displayed on both sides of the ball. \nGoff was sacked five times, Cal struggled to run the ball, and a boom-or-bust defense that had lived off sacks and takeaways didn't produce either in the first half, ultimately allowing 573 yards of total offense. \n\"Things that we haven't done all year, we did tonight,\" Cal coach Sonny Dykes said. \"That's not indicative of this football team, and we didn't play well tonight.\" \nDespite showing many of the same issues from last season, Dykes was confident Cal would not repeat the second-half slide this time around. \n\"This is a different team,\" Dykes said. \"Every year is different. Heck, every week is different, so we just got to pick up the pieces, learn from the mistakes we made and improve.\" \nKenny Lawler, Darius Powe and Khalfani Muhammad caught TD passes for Cal, which arrived with its highest ranking in six years and a chance to clinch to clinch bowl eligibility for the first time since 2011. Instead, the Bears still have just one win in Pasadena since 1999. \nRosen passed for 399 yards in another splendid game for the standout rookie, and Thomas Duarte had career highs of 10 catches for 141 yards for the Bruins (5-2, 2-2). UCLA rebounded from consecutive losses to Arizona State and Stanford, along with a drop from the national rankings. \nRosen was smooth and confident in another big Pac-12 game, going 34 for 47 without a turnover. The frosh got plenty of help, too: Soso Jamabo rushed for a score after star UCLA tailback Paul Perkins left with an injury, and the Bruins' injury-plagued defense limited Goff and Cal's potent offense to 170 yards in the first half. \nDebuting their black-and-shiny-gold \"City\" uniforms, UCLA appeared revitalized. Ka'imi Fairbairn made four field goals, including a school-record 60-yarder at the halftime gun, and the UCLA defense caused trouble for Goff throughout. \n\"It was a frustrating game all across the board,\" Goff said. \"I think we just started too slow and it's something we need to fix. If we want to beat good teams like that, good teams in the Pac-12, we have to start a little bit faster.\" \nThe Bruins took their first lead in three weeks when Duarte caught a 7-yard TD pass in the first quarter. Fuller capped a 90-yard drive early in the second with a 19-yard scoring grab, and UCLA scored on its first seven possessions. \nCal finally reached the end zone on Lawler's acrobatic grab 51 seconds before halftime, but Rosen moved the Bruins into position for that 60-yard kick by Fairbairn, who was mobbed by teammates when he broke Chris Sailer's UCLA record of 56 yards, set in 1997. \nCal offensive lineman Jordan Rigsbee hit UCLA defensive lineman well after the whistle on the final play, setting off a minor skirmish when both teams ran onto the field for the postgame handshakes. \nUnder Dykes, Cal is 0-9 against the Cardinal, Oregon, UCLA and USC, losing seven of those games by 16 points or more. Goff was confident the Bears will be ready to break that streak of futility when the embattled Trojans head to Memorial Stadium next week. \n\"We got punched in the mouth two weeks in a row now, and are going to have to respond one way or the other,\" Goff said. \"I think we're going to respond the correct way, though. It's the type of group we have in there.\" \nAP College Football site: http://www.collegefootball.ap.org \nAll content copyright ©2015 The Tribune, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T15:04:39.274+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
