Apparently, the saffron party has agreed to be a junior partner in the upcoming alliance with the SNDP Yogam - an influential caste organisation representing Ezhavas, an OBC community comprising around 60 per cent of the more than 50 per cent Hindus in the state. It is learnt that SNDP general secretary Vellappally Nateshan will be the NDA's CM candidate for the state. His son Thushar Vellappally is expected to be accommodated in the Union Cabinet after the new party, christened Dharma Jana Sena (DJS), is formally launched, most likely after the local bodies' elections. The decisions were taken in the meetings between leaders of SNDP Yogam with BJP president Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Sources say Vellappally Nateshan will lead a rathyatra on November 27 and the rest of the details of the alliance will be decided at the state level. Notably, Kerala is one state where the BJP had drawn a nought in the last General Election. The Ezhava community, which constitutes around 60 per cent of Kerala's Hindu population, holds the key to saffron plans to turn the situation around in the state politics. The new pro-BJP bloc may not impact the situation \"as majorly\" in April 2016 but the BJP believes it will be a force to reckon with by the time the state votes in 2021. With minorities (Muslims and Christians) largely supporting the Congress-led United Democratic Front, the BJP is hoping to divide Hindu voters who constitute 53-54 per cent of the population of the southern state and mostly support the Left Democratic Front (LDF) - a coalition of left-leaning parties.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T08:08:17.820+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
