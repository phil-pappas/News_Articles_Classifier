Michigan's punter, O'Neill, fumbled a punt snap which Michigan State recovered, with Jalen Watts-Jackson taking the ball to the endzone to score a touchdown just as the clock ran out. \nO'Neill received a variety of death threats and hateful comments on social media a day after the game, leading Michigan's interim athletic director Jim Hackett to post a letter telling fans to stop the \"thoughtless comments\" after the loss. \n“The support from the Michigan community has been fantastic,” O’Neill said. \"It means a lot for people to take time out of their day to write me.” \nCopyright   Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 8:07PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T03:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T08:26:25.902+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
