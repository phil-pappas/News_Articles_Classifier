His wife Uschi therefore asks for understanding that there will be no official appointments or visits on his 70th birthday,” added the statement. \nThe timing of the announcement and, more pertinently, the request for continued privacy is more than likely due to Müller’s approaching 70th birthday.\"Der Bomber\" retired from football in 1981 after a brief stint in America with Fort Lauderdale Strikers and Bayern’s chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge paid tribute to Müller's service to the club. \n\"Gerd was a scorer as it is no longer likely to give him, and in all the success he's always modest and restrained remained what has particularly impressed me,\" added Rummenigge. \n\"He was a wonderful player and is a friend. In the Bayern family Gerd will always have its place. \n\"After he had finished his professional career, he brought his experience as a young coach and coached such as our world champion Philipp Lahm, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Müller. Also we are grateful to him.\" \n- \nFollow Joy Sports on Twitter: @Joy997FM.
