The Worldwide Leader raced to help the Cougars keep their streak alive by overnighting a replica of Ol’ Crimson to Arizona in time for the show. But WSU’s recent winning ways have caught ESPN’s attention, and the Cougars’ Halloween weekend game in Pullman against Pac-12 North leader Stanford on Oct. 31 has now been picked up for a 7:30 p.m. broadcast on ESPN. The Cougars sit at 4-2 overall and in third place in the Pac-12 North, behind Stanford and Cal. They take on Arizona this weekend in Tucson, and while the team might not be thinking about this other nugget, from the fan perspective, there’s more than just win No. 5 on the line. According to Keri Potts, ESPN’s Senior Director of Public Relations, Washington State is one of eight finalists on ESPN’s shortlist to host College GameDay on Oct. 31. College GameDay has never been to Pullman. Whether this interest was sparked by the Cougars’ surprising success in the Pac-12 thus far this season, or whether it was first kindled by the “Ol’ Crimson College GameDay streak in jeopardy!” saga in late September, we might never know. WSU coach Mike Leach, however, has some experience with hosting College GameDay from his time at Texas Tech. “It’s kind of a big deal if they come to your campus, I guess,” Leach said Monday, adding that College GameDay was in Lubbock, Texas when his Red Raiders beat No. 1 Texas. WSU has not beaten Stanford since Nov. 10, 2007, when the Cougars won 33-17 at home. The Cougars need to take care of business against Arizona and then see how next weekend shakes out around college football. College GameDay will finalize its location decision for the Oct. 31 show by this Saturday evening (Oct. 24) or Sunday morning at the latest, Potts said. Regardless of whether the College GameDay does get to Pullman for Halloween, this might be the most interest the program has gotten from the national standpoint since Leach was hired in 2012. The Oct. 31 contest vs. Stanford will be WSU’s first night game of the season, and its first ESPN game of the year.
