I think they're really good.\" \nMorris went on to say that the penalties from Saturday were \"inexcusable.\" \nThe Red Raiders ended the day with 7 penalties for 68 yards. \n\"It's just within yourself,\" Micah Awe says. \"It's simple things, that's all it is. Having accountability within yourself.\" \nAwe spoke about his frustrations of failing to stop the run this season, taking responsibility as a defensive leader. \"I feel like it comes directly back on me, honestly. I put a lot of pressure on myself and I feel like if we can't stop the run, it's probably my fault and I take responsibility.\" \nJunior offensive lineman Baylen Brown went down against Oklahoma and would return to the sideline on crutches. His parents told KCBD he would need an MRI and Kingsbury announced to the media today that he will not need surgery. \nBrown will attempt to get back on his feet this week against Oklahoma State. \nCopyright 2015 KCBD .
