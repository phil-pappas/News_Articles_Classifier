I don’t compete with Cristiano and I suppose he would not compete with me. \n'What I want is the very best for my teams, and that’s what I am working for.' \nThe pair are expected to go head-to-head for the Ballon d’Or once again, with Ronaldo looking to collect his third successive award. \nBarcelona were unstoppable last season, winning the treble under Luis Enrique but they’ve struggled to get back to their best this term and have been unfortunate with injuries. \nThe Catalan-based side host high-flying Eibar this weekend, with their visitors surpassing all expectations so far this season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T12:09:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T19:41:09.270+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
