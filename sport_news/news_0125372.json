Iowa State’s defense may depend on the Cyclone ground game to chew up clock and keep those offenses off the field. \nTexas Tech is first up Saturday in Lubbock, Texas. The Red Raiders (3-2, 0-2) are averaging 602.8 yards and 50 points per game. \n“We don’t want to end up in a shootout,” Iowa State coach Paul Rhoads said Monday. \nEnter Warren, whose rise has been meteoric. \nHe played on the scout team in 2014 and saw little action in the first two games this year, carrying only nine times for 28 yards. Now, after running for 126 yards in an overtime loss at Toledo and his big game against Kansas, he’s sixth in the league in rushing and averaging 6.9 yards per carry. \n“He’s starting to grow up,” Rhoads said. “The cuts he made (against Kansas) and the timing of which he made them and why he was able to make them is because of where his vision was. He didn’t do that before the Toledo game.” \nEven with that happening, Warren seems surprised by his success. \nHe had expected to begin the season buried deep on the depth chart. But two running backs who had eligibility remaining are no longer on the team, and the run game struggled the first two weeks with Tyler Brown as the feature back, so Warren got his chance. \n“I didn’t think this time was going to come for a long time,” he said. “But things happen. Players left. It was just my time to step up. I knew I had to step up.” \nNo ISU player has rushed for 100 yards in three consecutive games since Alexander Robinson did in 2010, and no freshman at Iowa State has ever topped 100 yard three times in a season.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T19:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T05:22:06.448+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
