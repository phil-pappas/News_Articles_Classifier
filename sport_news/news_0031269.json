Darrell Royal experienced it as a player at Oklahoma and as a coach at Texas. Mack Brown served as Barry Switzer's offensive coordinator more than a decade before becoming Texas' head coach.\n\"It's one of the reasons I'm here at Texas,\" Norvell said. \"I love this game. I wanted to stay in this game.\"\nIn his first season at Texas, Norvell was named offensive playcaller after the opening loss to Notre Dame as part of a staff shakeup.\n\"It's kind of weird seeing him in that burnt orange,\" Oklahoma receiver Sterling Shepard said.\nNorvell, who was serving as the Sooners' co-offensive coordinator and wide receivers coach, was let go by Stoops after an 8-5 finish last season. He didn't offer any explanation about the decision this week.\n\"You're asking the wrong guy,\" Norvell said. \"I was fortunate to be at Oklahoma for seven years. I think I'm the luckiest guy in the world to be at Texas.\"\nStoops downplayed the notion that Norvell might have some special insight into Oklahoma that might benefit Texas.\nOU cornerback Zack Sanchez isn't so sure. He spent his freshman year on the scout team going against Norvell's offense in practice.\n\"He knows my tendencies,\" Sanchez said. \"I kind of know where he's going to attack me and things he's going to try to do. It's going to be a lot of fun just going out and competing against him. I got nothing but love for coach Norvell.\"\nHere's the breakdown of some of the coaches and players who have been on both sides of the Red River divide:\nDARRELL ROYAL\nOklahoma player 1946-49; Texas coach 1957-76\nOne of the defining personalities in the series was Royal. He grew up in Hollis, Okla., and when his family joined the migration to California to escape the Dust Bowl, he hitchhiked back to Oklahoma.\nHe was a remarkably versatile player under Bud Wilkinson at Oklahoma playing quarterback and defensive back. How versatile? He had an 81-yard punt and a 95-yard punt return during his career, as well as 18 interceptions -- still an Oklahoma career record.\nWhen Royal died in 2012, Oklahoma athletic director Joe Castiglione called him \"an icon, a champion, an innovator and an educator.\"\nRoyal made an even bigger impression at Texas, where he became the head coach in 1957 at age 33. He won three national championships, perfected the Wishbone with assistant coach Emory Bellard and posted a 167-47-5 record.\nHis 12-7-1 record vs. Oklahoma set a record for wins in the series, and included an eight-game winning streak. He had a special affinity for the Texas-OU game.\nTexas interim athletic director Mike Perrin remembers Royal addressing him and the other sophomores in 1966 before their first trip to the Cotton Bowl.\n\"He said, 'Men, you will never play a game like this again in your life. It's divided right down the middle. It's almost always hot. It's like an atmosphere that doesn't exist anywhere else,' \" Perrin recalled.\nThe series also drove Royal to an early retirement.\nHe went 0-5-1 in his final six games against Oklahoma and developed a bitter rivalry with OU counterpart Barry Switzer, at one point referring to Switzer and assistant Larry Lacewell as \"sorry bastards\" amid spying accusations.\nRoyal vs. OU coaches\nOklahoma coach: Years; Record\nBud Willkinson: 1957-63; 6-1\nGomer Jones: 1964-65; 2-0\nJim Mackenzie: 1966; 0-1\nChuck Fairbanks: 1967-72; 4-2\nBarry Switzer: 1973-76; 0-3-1\nTotals: 19 years; 12-71\nMACK BROWN\nOklahoma offensive coordinator 1984; Texas coach 1998-2013\nMack Brown got his first taste of the rivalry as Barry Switzer's offensive coordinator in 1984, something that spoiled him because of the No. 1 vs. No. 2 matchup that day. The teams battled to a 15-15 tie.\n\"You used to drive the buses right down the middle of the fair grounds and fans would shake the buses coming in on both sides,\" Brown recalled before his final meeting with OU in 2013. \"Coach Switzer looked at me and said, 'Now you get it. Now you understand how important it is.' \"\nBrown came to Texas in 1998 and posted some big wins but also suffered even bigger losses at the hands of Bob Stoops. A five-game losing streak from 2000-04 included Oklahoma wins by 63-14 and 65-13. Later, Oklahoma blew out Texas by a combined score of 118-38 in 2011-12.\nBrown also had memorable wins. Vince Young led a 45-12 win en route to the BCS title. And in 2008, the Longhorns twice rallied from 11-point deficits to win 45-35.\nBOBBY JACK WRIGHT\nTexas assistant 1986-97; Oklahoma assistant 1999-2014\nIf you thought Jay Norvell will be strange sight switching sides, imagine Bobby Jack Wright wearing crimson in 1999 following 12 seasons in Austin.\nAt the time, Wright acknowledged that he even had to deal with culture shock.\n\"When I first started,\" Wright said, \"I'd call a recruit and say, 'This is Coach Wright from the University of Texas. ... n , I used to be from Texas.' \"\nWright quickly decided not to talk much about Texas' success in Dallas to the folks north of the Red River.\n\"Texas has three national championships, and they have six here,\" he said in 1999, \"and they can remember the last one here. They don't mind reminding you of that, either.\"\nHe eventually became as much of a fixture at Oklahoma as he had been in Austin, coaching defensive ends, defensive backs and special teams over 16 years.\nWhen he retired at 64 in January, he had been part of 21 bowl games, including 16 with Oklahoma.\n\"We wouldn't have been able to win a national championship and eight Big 12 Conference championships without his dedication, loyalty and commitment,\" Bob Stoops said.\nJAY BOULWARE\nTexas player 1991-92; Oklahoma assistant 2013-15\nJay Boulware had paid his dues for two seasons at Texas and expected to be competing for a starting offensive line spot in 1993.\nThen he received some of the worst news he could imagine.\nHe was diagnosed with cardiac arrhythmia. His playing career was over.\nBoulware kept a connection to football that year playing video games.\n\"It's a way for me to express myself,\" Boulware told the Austin American-Statesman in '93. \"That's the only way I'm able to compete. ... I've got to be able to do something.\"\nThe Irving native found another outlet, one that his heart could take: coaching.\nHe served as a graduate assistant at Texas in 1996 and then began a journey into coaching that included six different schools in 15 years. As special teams and tight ends coach at Auburn from 2009-12, he helped Auburn win a BCS title.\nBoulware came to Oklahoma in the spring of 2013, part of an influx of new faces that included assistants Bill Bedenbaugh and Jerry Montgomery.\nTexas players who have become coaches at Oklahoma:\nName; Years\nHarry Phillips; 1945\nSwede Lee; 1966\nJim Helms; 1973-75\nJay Boulware; 2013-15\nSource: The Oklahoman\nDARRELL WYATT\nOklahoma assistant 2002-2005; Texas assistant 2011-13\nDarrell Wyatt had the distinction of switching sides in Oklahoma's two biggest rivalry games.\nHe joined the Sooners, leaving Oklahoma State. And then he was eventually hired by Mack Brown at Texas as part of a reworking of the staff after the 2010 season.\nRegarded as a top-flight recruiter, Wyatt led the effort that helped Oklahoma land Adrian Peterson out of Texas.\nHe had the same sort of optimism when he came to Texas.\n\"You walk down the hallways, and the tradition oozes out of you,\" he told reporters when he was introduced.\nOn Twitter:\n @ChuckCarltonDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ChuckCarltonDMN"], "published": "2015-10-08T02:53:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T13:01:59.367+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
