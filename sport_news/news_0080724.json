Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 6:30 pm Campbell, UNC Pembroke benefit from adding football By Sammy Batten Staff writer \nOn any given fall Friday afternoon in 2007, Jason Williams could look out his office window at Campell University and see a similar scene. \n\"The students would be carrying laundry baskets to their cars to head home for the weekend,'' said Williams, who, at the time, had recently joined Campbell's athletic communications staff. \nThe view is drastically different these days at Campbell and UNC Pembroke, two so-called \"suitcase colleges'' that have revitalized campus life by adding football programs in the last decade. \nCampbell has regularly drawn 5,000-plus to the Buies Creek campus since restoring its program in 2008. \nUNCP, which resumed football in 2007, attracted a standing-room-only crowd of more than 7,000 in its 3,000-seat stadium for the 2015 season opener against Winston-Salem State. \n\"Other than commencement, we don't have that many opportunities to draw so many people to our campus,'' said Dan Kenney, UNCP's former athletic director and current chief of staff in the chancellor's office. \nBringing large crowds to campus has been just part of the positive impact football has had at both schools. \nEnrollment has increased, financial donors have been more willing to give, and both schools have enjoyed a higher profile since football was added, administrators said. \nKenney thought he was in trouble one afternoon in May 2004 when then-UNCP chancellor Allen Meadors waved him into a nearby locker room. Meadors was about to work out, but he first had something to tell his athletic director. \n\"He just looked at me and said, 'Let's do it,'\" Kenney recalled. \n\"I said, 'Let's do what?' \n\"He said, 'Let's add football.''' \nSeven months and a feasibility study later, the UNCP Board of Trustees approved a plan to re-establish the football program, which had been dormant for more than half a century. \nKenney said the decision was part of a bigger project involving the entire university. \n\"A lot of people just think it was purely an athletic department-driven thing,'' Kenney said. \"But it really was a university strategic objective. We were trying to change the overall culture of the university, not just athletically but as an institution.'' \nAltering the \"suitcase college'' perception of UNCP was a major part of that plan. \nDitto for Campbell, which formed a committee to study the possibility of adding football late in 2005. Similar to UNCP, Campbell is located in a small eastern North Carolina town where off-campus activities for students are limited. \nCampbell had fielded a football team when it was a two-year school but shut the program down in 1950. \nDr. Dennis Bazemore, a vice president for student life at Campbell, was part of the movement that facilitated football's reinstatement in Buies Creek. \n\"I think there were two big areas we were looking at for football to do for Campbell University,'' Bazemore said. \"First, it would radically change the weekend experience for our students here. Being in a rural area we're not in a place where students on Saturday can walk a few blocks to a great restaurant or movie theatre. So for five or six Saturdays each football season, there would be a campus activity to be involved with. \n\"Another aspect of bringing football is that it would potentially bring us 100 or more male students that may not have come to Campbell otherwise.'' \nFootball Saturdays at both schools have become popular events for students and alumni. \nBrianna Mokma, an 18-year-old sophomore from Holden Beach, who says she chose Campbell because it had football. \n\"I have an older sister who goes to St. Andrews in Laurinburg, and they don't have a (football) team,'' Mokma said. \"I was like, 'You know, the weekends don't mean anything to you.' \n\"But when you have a home game on Saturdays, everybody gets so excited. When you sit in the stands and see everyone walking in, that makes you feel proud to come to Campbell.'' \nMokma said she and her dormmates get swept up in the football spirit. \n\"We all eat breakfast together on game days,'' Mokma said. \"Then we'll come back to our room and pick out all our orange (Campbell school colors). \n\"It's an ordeal. You can't just go with a T-shirt, you have to go with something cute that is orange.'' \nAfter determining the proper attire, the friends head over to Barker-Lane Stadium, which sits across U.S. 421 from the main part of campus. \nIn the future, students and others will be able to access the stadium without dodging traffic via a tunnel being constructed below the highway. \n\"I hope one day I can paint stuff like 'Go Camels!' inside,'' Mokma said. \"It'll be like our little cheering tunnel as we go to the game.'' \nLamar Courmon didn't have his own car as a freshman at UNCP in 2006, so going home to Greensboro every weekend wasn't an option. \n\"Some weekends were harder than others, but most of the time there wasn't a lot to do,'' said Courmon, now 26, who works in marketing and promotions at UNCP. \nBut that all changed during Courmon's sophomore year with the rebirth of football. \n\"It livened up the whole campus,'' Courmon said. \"The students had something to really get behind.'' \nAnd, of course, there was tailgating. \n\"The first couple of seasons I just sort of went and sought out food,'' Courmon laughed. \"Hey, I was working on a college student's budget, so sometimes it was hard to make ends meet. Toward my final years, I did start to help out with the food myself.'' \nThe town has also gotten into the football spirit. During UNCP's homecoming weekend Oct. 3, Pembroke hosted a parade that featured nearly 90 floats, Kenney said. \n\"People in town came out in a misty rain,'' Kenney said. \"I think it creates some (town) pride.'' \nIt has added to town growth. Since the football program kicked off, a hotel has been built in Pembroke and another may be on the way. \n\"The university's football team has had a strong impact on the entire community,'' said town council member Larry McNeill. \"It's brought additional people to our restaurants and businesses. We had a hotel and Walmart come to town, and we're in the process now of bringing in another motel.'' \nUNC Pembroke was a success almost immediately on the field under coach Pete Shinnick. He produced a winning record in the program's second season and took the Braves to the NCAA Division II playoffs the following year. \nShinnick left after the 2013 season to start another college program at West Florida. After a rocky first season in 2014, Shane Richardson has continued UNCP's winning ways with a 4-1 start this year that has included victories over two nationally ranked NCAA Division II teams. \nThe next step in UNCP's football development will be finding a conference home. The Braves are currently an independent in football while their other athletic teams compete in the Peach Belt Conference. \nCampbell hasn't won as much as UNC Pembroke to date, but a 3-2 start this season under former NFL player Mike Minter has the Camels optimistic that consistent success isn't far off. \nAthletic director Bob Roller sees an exciting future for Campbell football, one that includes scholarships for players, stadium expansion and a geographically kinder conference in which to compete. The composition of the Pioneer Football League means road trips to San Diego, Indianapolis, Des Moines, New York and Florida. \nBut most of all, Roller envisions a crowded campus and full stadium on Saturdays during the fall. \n\"I love watching the fans come in,'' Roller said. \"My favorite part of the day is those 15 minutes before the game when everyone is strolling in, when the fireworks are about to go off and the tunnel starts rocking. \n\"We haven't won yet to the magnitude we'd like. But our fans are seeing the improvement by leaps and bounds under Mike Minter. I can't wait to see how they come when we're champions.''", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-11T01:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:52:24.565+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
