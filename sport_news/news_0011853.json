Details of the visit are pending.\nHe is scheduled to attend a luncheon fundraiser Friday in Seattle for Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., so he's presumably coming to Roseburg before or after that event.\n-- Stuart Tomlinson\nstomlinson@oregonian.com\n503-221-8313\n@ORweather", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/ORweather"], "published": "2015-10-08T01:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T06:21:20.336+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
