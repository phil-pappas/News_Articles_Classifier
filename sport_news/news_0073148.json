Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 12:33 am Tigers efforts fall short against Bobcats By JORDAN MOSS Tribune sports writer   Special teams mistakes and a Hallsville defense that bottled up the Tiger offense cost Mount Pleasant the game Friday night. The Bobcats (3-3, 1-2) defeated the Tigers (2-4, 2-1) 24-7 ending Mount Pleasant’s two game winning streak. Tiger running back Travion Holloman was held to 156 yards on 26 carries and one touchdown. Mount Pleasant quarterback Ladarrius Patterson added 75 rushing yards on nine attempts but went 1-of-4 through the air for just 7-yards. Hallsville’s Lance Hardman proved tough to stop for the Mount Pleasant defense. Hardman gained 173 yards on 26 attempts and rushed for a score. Bobcat quarterback Roger McCuller also had a solid night going 9-of-15 for 52 yards and rushing for 40 yards on 12 attempts including two rushing TDs. The Hallsville defensive line allowed little room for Holloman to get going. Coming off his 415-yard and four touchdown performance against Sulphur Springs last week the Bobcats were able to hold the Tigers star back largely in check. Two key fumbles on special teams gave Hallsville the ball back following defensive stops by the Mount Pleasant defense. The turnovers led to 10 Bobcat points. On the first possession of the game, Mount Pleasant’s running attack was bottled up leading to a quick three-and-out. Hallsville got the scoring started off driving down the field in 13 plays to set up an Alan Acuna 23-yard field goal to take a 3-0 lead with 5:21 to go in the first quarter. Tiger quarterback Ladarrius Patterson broke off a 55 yard run getting Mount Pleasant in position for a 37 yard field goal attempt that sailed wide right. The Mount Pleasant defense held its ground on the next Bobcat possession forcing a Hallsville punt. The Tigers muffed the catch on the return, however, setting up Hallsville to take over on the Tiger 42. Six plays later Bobcat quarterback Roger McCuller rushed into the end zone from 12 yards out to put Hallsville up 10-0 with 9:30 remaining in the half. On the ensuing kickoff the Bobcats kicked the ball out of bounds giving the Tigers the choice to take the ball on the 40 or have Hallsville re-kick form their 35. Mount Pleasant elected to have the Bobcats re-kick and fumbled the return giving the ball right back to Hallsville. McCullers found the end zone six plays later on a 12-yard rush that put Hallsville up 17-0 with 6:43 to play in the half. The Bobcats took that lead into the break. Hallsville opened up the third quarter with an 11 play 72-yard drive capped off by a 12-yard McCullers rushing TD to put the Bobcats up 24-0. Mount Pleasant finally got on the scoreboard with 1:04 left in the third when Holloman broke an 80-yard touchdown run. Mount Pleasant will next be in action at 7:30 p.m. next Friday night when they travel to Pine Tree.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T08:33:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T08:46:54.986+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
