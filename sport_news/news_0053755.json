Photo: Charles Wenzelberg It seems a stunning turnaround from an opponent whose troll game was once so strong, Le Batard pointed out, he named his son Shea after the site of so many crowd-hushing homers. New, pro-Mets Chipper claims the name came from a Red Sox bit player as much as from the old stadium in Flushing.\n“That was not to taunt,” Jones said. “Shea was a place that I truly loved. I loved going there, I loved playing there, I hit my first homer there. A long time ago, there was a guy played in the league named Shea Hillenbrand and I was like, ‘You know what? That’s a pretty cool name. You can have it for a boy or a girl.’ Over time, it’s really gotten blown out of proportion.”\n  atlanta braves ,  chipper jones ,  jacob degrom ,  mlb playoffs ,  new york mets", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:21:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T03:43:38.268+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
