Young basketball players must experience two, three, preferably four years of college.\nThat’s where they get the life lessons they’ll need in the wicked NBA. That’s where they learn to handle all that money. If tossed into the cold, deep pool of 82 games, they’ll drink and use drugs and spend their cash and treat women like objects of desire. No, much better to learn from a wise college coach and the culture of academe.\nBeyond all that, a college team prepares you for life beyond sports. When life really gets tough – no, not just when the engine light flashes on the Bentley console – you must be ready to push on through, persevere, be accountable, blame nobody else, see it through. You only learn that from coaches.\nWhat better example than Rick Pitino?\nRecent reports from Louisville underline why every dad wants his son to play for Pitino. Or at least ride along on his recruiting trip.\nKatina Powell wrote a book called “Breaking Cardinal Rules,” in which she says she and other escorts educated Louisville basketball recruits and players. Included in the syllabus were courses on The Art Of The Ecdysiast and Sex Education. However, there were special fees assessed for these classes, a practice otherwise known as prostitution.\nThis might explain why Louisville’s arena is called the Yum! Center, but it also adds confusion. We always thought the only Cat House in Kentucky was Rupp Arena.\nWhile some are horrified, the inside basketball world is snickering. Jalen Rose, on an ESPN podcast, said that such “bachelorette parties” are vital to the recruiting process. “As a 17-year-old, if I’m not getting (serviced), I’m not coming,” he said, pointing out that he visited UNLV, Syracuse and Michigan and “you know where I went (Michigan).”\nBut here’s an example of Pitino’s searing focus. Everyone else might have known about this, but he didn’t. Powell alleged that Andre McGee, on Pitino’s staff, was the financier and facilitator of this operation, but Pitino had no knowledge. At all.\nRoll that one around. Coaches know what classes their players missed. They know every detail of their weight-lifting sessions. Yet you could knock over Pitino with a feather boa by telling about the strip mall once known as Billy Minardi Hall.\nWhat is worse? Pitino knowing about this and not caring? Or Pitino not knowing?\nAdvertisement\nWas he that detached from his players’ lives when they weren’t actually playing? This would appear to be the very definition of “institutional control.”\nPitino is now demanding that McGee come clean, after McGee was fired from the Missouri-Kansas City staff. But his bravado is only limited to official statements.\nHe was supposed to appear at ACC Operation Basketball, a large, annual preseason media gathering, but begged off, saying the NCAA won’t let him answer Strippergate questions. In other words, his players have to bring intestinal fortitude into Cameron Indoor stadium, but their coach is scared of bloggers and videographers from Greensboro.\nImperial college coaches expect the world to hang on their every sentence. Then they can’t understand why their contradictions are exposed.\nSteve Spurrier called a special press conference to excoriate an Atlanta writer f or suggesting the 70-year-old South Carolina coach was too old and tired to do the job. Then the Gamecocks started 2-4 and Spurrier, perhaps seeing the outline of a truly catastrophic loss to Clemson in the distance, flat out quit on his team.\nNobly, he said that he was just getting out of the way so the Gamecocks’ recruiting wouldn’t be affected. Then he said later he wasn’t retiring, just resigning. Way to hang in, Coach.\nThen there’s Rutgers football coach Kyle Flood. In September, six of his Scarlet Knights were arrested in what was described as a home invasion rivalry. But, before that, Flood was found to have contacted a professor in hopes of getting a grade changed, and rendering one of those players eligible. Flood got a three-game suspension for that one.\nThe moral is not that all coaches are venal, money-besotted hypocrites, or that all coaches should know everything their players are doing at all times, or that athletes can’t have romantic interludes (legal ones). And there’s a multitude of reasons why you should stay on campus as long as possible.\nBut college athletics is a vastly overrated vehicle for life preparation. For one thing, it teaches that not all actions have consequences, as we will see when Pitino is still coaching Louisville in the NCAA tournament, locally known as the Big Lap Dance.\n mark.whicker@langnews.com or follow Mark on Twitter: @MWhicker03LANG Mark Whicker Back to top", "external_links": ["http://mn1-laweb.newscyclecloud.com/apps/pbcsi.dll/persbilde?Avis=LA&ID=522", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/sec/2015/07/22/steve-spurrier-south-carolina/30527665/", "http://twitter.com/MWhicker03LANG", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/2015/10/20/louisville-recruiting-escort-strippers-katina-powell/74259456/", "http://www.greensboro.com/news/north_carolina_ap/louisville-s-pitino-will-not-participate-in-acc-media-day/article_a09997bd-d5e3-54b4-9233-815faef20728.html", "http://widgets.outbrain.com/outbrain.js"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T09:43:24.387+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
