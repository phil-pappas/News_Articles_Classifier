Craig \"Iron Head\" Heyward played 11 seasons in the NFL as a running back for several teams. He died from cancer in 2006. \nCam Heyward says he was simply trying to pay tribute to his father and others affected by cancer. He writes that he had a \"respectful\" exchanged with the league and doesn't want to be a distraction to his team. \nHeyward will wear plain eye black going forward and has started an initiative with EyeBlack.com to help provide money for cancer research. \n___ \nAP NFL websites: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL Copyright The Associated Press Sign up for our WSOC-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter Sign Up", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:58:23.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
