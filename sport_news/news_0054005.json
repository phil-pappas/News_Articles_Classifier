The Lions are not total crap, as they showed when they got jobbed by a bad noncall. If not, they probably win in Seattle and everyone here would be chewing their fingernails. Hell, Cards fans, more than any other fan base, should know that even the crappiest NFL teams win roughly half their home games. I agree. If I were the Lions I would be really upset with how the game turned out Monday night. Here is a run down of their games so far. They were winning 21-10 on the road against San Diego Week 1 but lost by 5. Stayed even with Minnisota on the road but lost by only 10. Lost by 12 at home to Denver but then Denver has a good defense. Lost by 3 to Seattle on the road. They have been in every game so the Cards better be ready for a fight.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T03:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T17:40:28.683+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
