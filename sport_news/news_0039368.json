Behind 116 yards rushing by Jonte McMullen and a defense that stymied Dixon’s slow-paced offense, the Monarchs opened East Central 2-A Conference play with a 27-0 victory over the Bulldogs. The win came three days after Northside reported to the NCHSAA that it had used an ineligible player, which school expects will force it to forfeit the Monarchs’ first four wins. As it stands now, however, before the NCHSAA makes its ruling, Northside improved to 5-2 overall entering next week’s key ECC showdown at home against Croatan (6-1, 1-0). But not only was Northside without one wide receiver because of the eligibility issue, the Monarchs were without leading pass-catcher Demetrius Jones, who will miss the remainder of the regular season with a broken collar bone. “It’s hard,” Northside coach Bob Eason said. “The offensive timing I think is a big part in staying consistent. On defense you always just throw the ball out there and play, but on offense our timing was off, we had a bunch of penalties we don’t normally get and it was homecoming week.” Still, the Monarchs proved too strong for the Bulldogs (3-4, 0-1), who look to rebound next week following the end of their two-game winning streak when they visit East Duplin (5-2, 1-0). Dixon got the tempo it wanted for most of the game, but didn’t consistently move the ball. The Bulldogs were held to just three first downs – one in the second half – and had three costly turnovers. Dixon managed just 97 yards total offense. “They beat us up front and we were not able to sustain anything,” Dixon coach Chris Morris said. “We had the style we wanted. We didn’t want to be in a track meet with those guys, but it was just a matter of not being able to finish it off.” Northside intercepted two passes and forced another turnover with what was ruled a fumble that resulted in a touchdown. With the Monarchs leading 7-0 in the second quarter, Northside senior defensive lineman Bernard Cooks stripped quarterback Brandon Horsley of the ball and darted 30 yards for a touchdown. “I couldn’t have done it without Meshack Smith,” Cooks said. “When I had my hands in, I was fighting for the ball and Meshack hit the quarterback to help me get it.” McMullen then botched the hold on the ensuring extra point snap, but rolled to his right and scored for a two-point conversion to make it 15-0. Page 2 of 3 - Morris agreed Cooks’ return gave the Monarchs plenty of separation. “It was only a 7-0 game,” he said. “But I was real proud how we responded and didn’t quit.” Dixon’s first turnover was the first of two interceptions by Northside junior defensive back Rashawn Canady at the Bulldogs’ 39 after it deflected off a receiver. Canady’s second pick, though, was even more impressive. After forcing a Northside punt to open the third quarter, Dixon faced third-and-16 from its own 34. Horsley rolled to his right to elude a pass rush and looked for a target on the right side, only to have Canady come out of nowhere to intercept the ball at the Monarchs’ sideline at the Northside 36. “The tight end rolled out and I chased him from behind,” said Canady, who entered not having picked off a pass this season. “The quarterback kind of threw it short and I dove for it and caught it.” The Monarchs took advantage. Northside needed just five plays to march 64 yards, including a 39-yard run to the Dixon 12 by McMullen. The drive ended with quarterback Jake Erickson’s 1-yard touchdown plunge that extended the Monarchs’ lead to 21-0. “Dixon’s offense was a little slow because they like to run the clock out,” Canady said. “We didn’t expect them to throw much, but when they did (secondary coach Dustin Johns) told us to make big plays.” Northside was never really in danger of losing the lead, but for good measure the Monarchs made it 27-0 late when Erickson threw a 5-yard scoring pass to Thomas McCaskill on fourth-and-goal. After forcing a three-and-out to open the game, Northside drove down the field to take an early 7-0 lead. McMullen scored on a 10-yard run to cap a 60-yard, 12-play drive that lasted 5:56. It was the Monarchs’ only first-quarter possession. At other times throughout the game, Northside had to grind it out without having two of its top players in the lineup as well as not seeing the field for long stretches because of Dixon’s tempo. “Coach Morris did a great job,” Eason said. “I told our guys that’s what they were going to do and I’m glad we got some three-and-outs. I just wish we had the ball a little bit more.” Nonetheless, the Monarchs emerged victories in a game that begin their quest in trying to win a fifth consecutive ECC title and ended a week highlighted by bad news. “In the beginning of the week it did bring us down, but we stuck together,” Cooks said. “Because of the whole instant, a lot of people on social media talked trash, but we don’t want any part of that.” Page 3 of 3 - Dixon 0 0 0 0 — 0 Northside 7 8 6 6 — 27 First Quarter N – McMullen 10 run (Reyes kick), 5:43 Second Quarter N – Cooks 30 fumble return (McMullen run), 7:26 Third Quarter N – Erickson 1 run (kick blocked), 6:25 Fourth Quarter N – McCaskill 5 pass from Erickson (kick blocked), 1:04 D N", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T15:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T14:42:07.300+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
