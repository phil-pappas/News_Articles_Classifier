Five-goals ... D-11 berths Friday, October 9, 2015 \nEvery Friday during the fall sports season, the TIMES NEWS will publish its annual fall sports notebook reflecting back on the week that was, and highlighting both individual and team accomplishments, as well as interesting information that may have occurred in games, matches or meets. The weekly notebook will cover cross country, field hockey, golf, soccer, tennis and volleyball, and will consist of storylines from the previous seven days. Today’s notebook will reflect back on all the happenings from last Wednesday up through this past Tuesday. Times News sports writer Jason Boris will once again be handling the compilation of notes and is encouraging all local coaches to email him with noteworthy information that can be used in this column. Emails can be sent to jboris@tnonline.com . \nGOLF \nWE ARE THE CHAMPIONS — In last Wednesday’s Schuylkill League team championship, Marian finished in third place behind Schuylkill League champion Blue Mountain and Schuylkill League runner-up Pottsville; however, the Colts finished one stroke ahead of Lourdes Regional (356-357), which proved to be an all-important tiebreaker between the two teams. The one stroke victory over Lourdes allowed Marian to claim the Schuylkill League Division 2 championship. Heading into the League meet, Marian and Lourdes were tied atop the Division with identical 9-1 records, with both teams having split their regular season matches against one another. \nMAKING THE CUT — In Monday’s District 11 qualifier at Locust Valley Golf Course (par 72), Tamaqua sophomore Carson Schoener carded an 87 to advance to the District 11 Class AA Championship for the second straight year. He was the lone Times News area golfer to earn a spot in Monday’s championship round at the Schuylkill Country Club in Orwigsburg. In the AA qualifier, the top 12 players (plus ties) advance, and Schoener’s round of 87 was tied for tenth in the field, four strokes off the cut line of 91. Last year as a freshman, Schoener fired a round of 90 to make the cut and advance to the District Championship. \nSOCCER \nHIGH FIVE — Tamaqua’s Lynn Kistler scored five goals last Thursday against North Schuylkill, as she led her team to a 10-0 Schuylkill League victory over the Lady Spartans. The five goals were not only a career-high for Kistler, but the Tamaqua senior also tied a school record for most goals in a game. Kailee Rottet also scored five goals in a game back in 2012. \nASSISTING HER TEAM — In last Thursday’s 7-3 setback to Notre Dame of East Stroudsburg, Northern Lehigh’s Meghan Handwerk tallied her fourth assist of the season. While four assists seem fairly routine for this late in the season, the fact that Handwerk had all four assists from the goal keeper position is anything but. The four assists is tied for the team lead. \nHATS OFF TO THESE TRICKS — As opposed to the first four weeks of the season, this week was relatively light with “hat tricks,” as there were only seven recorded in the past seven days. The Jim Thorpe duo of Luke Morris (4 goals) and Cody Geiser (3 goals) accomplished the feat in the same game, as the Olympians rolled to a 9-1 victory over North Schuylkill last Thursday. Tamaqua’s Lynn Kistler tallied five goals against North Schuylkill last Thursday, Northwestern’s Abby Chisdak accounted for three goals last Wednesday against Northern Lehigh, Lehighton’s Frank Bokan notched three goals on Saturday against Northern Lehigh, Northwestern’s JD Haaf scored three times against Southern Lehigh on Tuesday, and Northern Lehigh’s Jill Olewine chipped in with three goals in Tuesday’s game against Wilson. \nVOLLEYBALL \nDIG PINK — In honor of National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, the Marian volleyball team will host a “Dig Pink” event at their home match against Nativity on Monday, Oct. 12. The event is being held in conjunction with the Fillies Annual CYO Appreciation Night. All proceeds generated by the “Dig Pink” fundraiser will be donated to the Side-Out Foundation, which awards grants to medical research organizations and entities dedicated to providing compassionate support to breast cancer patients and their families. The team is asking all fans attending the match to wear “pink.” The Fillies are also holding a “Dig Pink” T-shirt sale and will be selling chances for a $200 gift card basket, an iTunes card, and a pink volleyball. \n500 AND COUNTING — In Tuesday’s Schuylkill League match against Lourdes Regional, Marian senior outside hitter Maureen Kloap joined the Fillies “500 Club” with her 500th career kill against the Red Raiders. Entering the match with 492 kills, Kloap recorded eight kills in the three game sweep, with her eighth and final tally being kill number 500. Kloap accomplished the feat just 12 days after middle hitter Abby Stankiewitch picked up her 700th career kill against Blue Mountain. \nDISTRICT 11 \nPLAYOFF BOUND — At the conclusion of play on Tuesday, eight Times News area teams have punched their tickets into their upcoming District 11 Tournaments. With a 9-3 record, the Marian golf team advances to the District 11 Class AA Tournament. In volleyball, Panther Valley (11-2) and Marian (10-2) earned berths in the Class AA and Class A Tournaments respectively. The Lehighton boys soccer team (12-2) will be moving on to the Class AA Tournament, while the Pleasant Valley boys (8-4-2) and girls (9-6) soccer teams will be playing in the Class AAA Tournaments. In addition, both Northwestern soccer programs have qualified for the postseason. With an 11-2 record, the Northwestern girls will be competing in the Class AA Tournament, while the Northwestern boys (14-1) will advance to the Class AA Tournament. The Tigers suffered their first loss of the season last Thursday, when they dropped a 1-0 Colonial League decision to Salisbury.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T23:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T04:58:31.662+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
