(Travis Bell/SIDELINE CAROLINA) × COLUMBIA — With Lorenzo Nunez still nursing a sprained throwing shoulder, Perry Orth will start at quarterback for South Carolina in Saturday’s game against No. 7 LSU. Gamecocks head coach Steve Spurrier said Thursday that Nunez hasn’t thrown much this week in practice. The true freshman suffered the injury in last weekend’s 24-10 loss at Missouri, when he was tackled after rushing for a 29-yard gain on the Gamecocks’ final series. Orth will make his second career start at USC. He also started the 52-20 loss at then-No. 7 Georgia after Connor Mitch went down with a separated shoulder. The former walk-on split time in that contest with Nunez, who has started the two games since. “Perry Orth’s had a good week of practice,” Spurrier said. “Zo’s still a little gimpy, but we’ll see how he is Saturday.” Orth is less of a runner than Nunez, who has led USC in rushing in each of its past three games. “Hopefully we get some protection, get some balls out, and run the running backs,” Spurrier said. “But Zo could be back in there running some, too. We’ll bring our whole arsenal with us.” ESPN to televise ESPN will televise Saturday’s game between USC and LSU, after a shuffle which involved shifting the TV networks broadcasting five other games. Minnesota at Purdue was moved to ESPNU to make way for the Gamecocks and Tigers, and four other games involving Big Ten or American Athletic Conference teams were also affected. “To change the location of an SEC football game does not come without the cooperation and collaboration of our institutions, their support systems and our media partners,” said SEC commissioner Greg Sankey. “... Our partners at ESPN and CBS played a critical role in adapting to permit this game to be played at a time most beneficial to both institutions and fans given the circumstances.” The game, moved from Williams-Brice Stadium to Baton Rouge due to flooding in Columbia, was originally scheduled for noon on ESPN. That time slot is now occupied by Indiana at Penn State. Extra points — Could the SEC alter its cross-divisional rotation, which has USC traveling to LSU in 2020, and make that a home game to make up for the one the Gamecocks are losing Saturday? Athletics director Ray Tanner isn’t hopeful. “You don’t have an opportunity to flip,” Tanner said. “Schedules are set. They’re very difficult. We understand that.” — USC has emailed fans who had tickets to the LSU game at Williams-Brice Stadium, offering either a refund for the face value ($70 to $75) or a credit which can be applied to future purchases. Fans also have the option of declining a refund, and allowing the money to go USC. — With temperatures forecast at near 90 degrees Saturday in Baton Rouge, USC will wear all white uniforms, per its prerogative as the “home” team. LSU will wear purple jerseys, which the Tigers haven’t donned for an SEC game at Tiger Stadium since 1994, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune. The Tigers lost that game to Alabama 35-17.
