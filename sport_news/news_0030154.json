(AP Photo/Gregory Bull) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Mets infielder Matt Reynolds, who has never played in the majors, has replaced injured shortstop Ruben Tejada on New York’s roster for the remainder of the NL Division Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers. \nReynolds batted .267 with six homers and 65 RBIs this season for Triple-A Las Vegas. He could become the second player since the first World Series in 1903 to make his big league debut in the postseason, according to STATS. Mark Kiger did it for Oakland in 2006, appearing as a defensive replacement and pinch runner. \nThat was the extent of Kiger’s major league career. \nNew York announced the move Monday, hours before Game 3 against the Dodgers at Citi Field. The best-of-five series was tied 1-all. \nEven though Reynolds has no major league experience and was not on the 40-man roster, the Mets tabbed him as insurance because they had no other healthy options who are comfortable at shortstop. Wilmer Flores will take over for Tejada as the starter, but reserve infielder Juan Uribe is sidelined with a chest cartilage injury. \nTejada broke his right leg Saturday night when he was taken out at second base on a late slide by Chase Utley in Game 2. Tejada will miss the rest of the postseason but will not require surgery, the Mets said. \nThe 24-year-old Reynolds has not played in competitive games since Sept. 7, when the season ended for Las Vegas. A second-round draft pick out of Arkansas in 2012, he appeared in 92 games at shortstop and 11 at second base for the 51s this season after spending much of spring training with the Mets. \nReynolds made 12 errors in 466 chances this year for a .974 fielding percentage. At the plate, he had 32 doubles, five triples and scored 70 runs. He was a midseason All-Star in the Pacific Coast League. \nReynolds was the team MVP for Las Vegas in 2014 after hitting .333 with five homers, 40 RBIs and 14 stolen bases in 68 games. He began that season at Double-A Binghamton. \nReynolds’ contract was selected from Las Vegas and to make room for him on the 40-man roster, the Mets designated right-hander Tim Stauffer for assignment.
