Championship Series teeming with top young talent, it's a classic baseball confrontation: the New York Mets and their power pitching versus the Chicago Cubs and those potent sluggers. \n\"Strength against strength, in some respect,\" Chicago executive Theo Epstein said Friday. \nWith the wild-card Cubs four wins from their first World Series in 70 years, Game 1 in the best-of-seven set is Saturday night at Citi Field. Harvey is scheduled to start for N.L. East champion New York against postseason pro Jon Lester. \nBut while the series features two of the country's largest media markets -- the city that never sleeps against the city of broad shoulders -- this savory matchup was grown down on the farm the last few years, sprouting up off dusty minor league diamonds at Double-A Tennessee and Binghamton, Triple-A Iowa and Las Vegas. \nAs both franchises endured half a decade of consistent losing, Epstein and Mets general manager Sandy Alderson were stockpiling prospects. \nChicago rebuilt around rookie sluggers, while New York pinned its plan on lively arms. \nAnd here they are in October, perhaps a year or so ahead of schedule. \nThe scouts saw it coming.

That's the currency with which we deal,\" Alderson said. \"Ultimately if you don't develop your own players, you're going to come up short at some point, either on your own team or in the trade market.\" \nOne glance at the young studs on each club doesn't tell the entire story, though. \nChicago actually had a lower ERA than the Mets this year, while New York had more homers and a higher slugging percentage. So despite their obvious differences, this really isn't some head-to-head clash of baseball cultures and philosophies. \nStill, everyone involved is acutely aware of all the young talent that will be on display. \n\"We've kind of ascended. The Mets showed their muscle the latter part of the year like we did,\" Cubs manager Joe Maddon said. \"It's really kind of like a renaissance going on right now with the youth in baseball.\" \nThis season, the Cubs won all seven meetings by a combined score of 27-11. It was the first time the Mets were swept in a season series of seven games or more -- and the first time Chicago did it since 1885 against the Buffalo Bisons. \nBut the last time they played was July 2, weeks before the Mets revamped a scuffling lineup. Since then, New York added Yoenis Cespedes and rookie Michael Conforto, among others, while Travis d'Arnaud and David Wright returned from injuries. Tyler Clippard and Addison Reed were acquired to deepen the bullpen. \nChicago is trying to end a championship drought that dates to 1908. The Cubs haven't even captured a pennant since 1945. \n\"It's got to end sometime, right?\" said Lester, who left the A's to join the Cubs as a free agent last offseason when he signed a $155 million, six-year contract. \"It's fun to think about, but we've got some games to go before we get there.\" TV ratings up: The baseball playoffs' television viewership is up 22 percent from last year so far in the U.S. Major League Baseball said the average audience of nearly 3.5 million is the highest since 2010.
