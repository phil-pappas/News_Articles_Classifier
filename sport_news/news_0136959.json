We're not just going to go to France and enjoy it...we're going to go and try to make an impact. \n\"I genuinely believe, fitness and availability willing, we can go there with a real optimism.\" \nO'Neill will not want for praise or plaudits in the days and weeks to come, job offers too perhaps, but does not want his own name up in lights. \nInstead he expects his squad to be the heroes, and nobody more so than Southampton midfielder Davis. \n\"It's just an amazing feeling, what we have to look forward to, but this is about the players, to see their reaction is where I get the real buzz,\" he said. \n\"We saw all the good things in Northern Ireland out there. The bond between crowd and team is really, really strong. \n\"Steven's performance was out of this world. He is a magnificent captain. \n\"Anyone in the squad will validate that opinion. That gives you an indication of the type of player and person he is. \n\"We've come from an era where Northern Ireland players were criticised for not being available at certain times, but in this squad we have real togetherness and spirit. \n\"For those players who've been through campaign after campaign and been through loads of disappointments - and had a lot of criticism - this is their moment as much as it is mine.\" \nDavis, who was just a year old when his country went to the Mexico World Cup in 1986, was clearly emotional about his contribution on such a famous day. \nHe explained: \"When I scored it obviously meant a lot because my mum passed away in 2008. She was my biggest fan...those two goals were for her. \n\"It's strange, I just lost myself in the moment and she came into my head at the important time.\" \nDuring his pre-match press conference Davis had spoken of the need for a new Northern Irish hero to emerge when it mattered most, and he added: \"I didn't think it would be me, but the most important thing is we won. \n\"I was delighted to get on the scoresheet but credit to everyone of the players and the management. It was a real team effort and you saw what it meant to us all at the final whistle.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T08:32:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T19:52:32.058+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
