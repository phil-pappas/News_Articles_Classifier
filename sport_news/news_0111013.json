(By: Andy Shupe) \nThe Lady Bobcats (16-6) used a 9-2 run to claim a 17-13 lead in the second set, but Shiloh responded with a 9-0 spurt to regain command and then rolled in the third set. \nShiloh Christian coach Nate Bodenstein said it was a case of his team adjusting to Berryville returning some of their big hits. \n\"Berryville's so dangerous,\" Bodenstein said. \"They are very well coached and very athletic. We're so accustomed to first set getting a kill when they play it back it's like 'Whoa, we have to play some defense now.' I think we just had to find our groove. \n\"Our serving really helped us. We served very aggressively, but our setters started making really good decisions midway through the second set..\" \nSenior outside hitter Reagan Robinson enjoyed a huge night with 16 kills, along with nine digs and four service aces. Morgan Stoecklein chipped in 12 kills with just two errors for the Lady Saints (25-9-1). \n\"I want to brag on Morgan because she's our other key component, Bodenstein said. \"People forget about her because they see Reagan. She didn't have a good game against Berryville last time. She had 10 hitting errors. She was very aggressive, smart. Our seniors are ready to prove themselves.\" \nRobinson, an Arkansas commit, started the key run with big kill off the block in the second set, then followed with an eight-point service run that included an ace as Shiloh Christian's seniors finished off a perfect 46-0 run in the 4A-1. \nBerryville coach Kristin Whetnam said her team has struggled with consistency late in the season. \n\"We tend to do that here lately, we will go on a really good run, then we'll give up a lot of points,\" Whetnam said. \"We're trying to figure out how to get over that hump. Very inconsistent right now, but I only have two seniors on the floor right now and only one at times. I think that comes back to a lot of it. I graduated five out of my six starters.\" \nSenior middle hitter Ally Teague led Berryville with eight kills, while sophomore Aspen Smith finished with a team-high 14 digs. \nGravette rallied from two sets down to claim a 3-2 (19-25, 19-25 25-18, 25-21, 15-7) win over Huntsville to earn the No. 3 seed in next week's state tournament in Mena. \nSports on 10/23/2015", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T09:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:40:43.865+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
