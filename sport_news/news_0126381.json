We’re preparing for the top French team to turn up on Saturday. They’ll certainly throw everythIng at us,” Read said. \n“Two teams that are very passionate about this game, about World Cup rugby so it’s going to be a hell of a battle.” \nAfter reviewing how France have played so far, Read said it was evident they were not a one-dimensional side. \n“The French will be a blend. They have very strong forwards and are very strong around the breakdown area with their loose forwards. They’ll come hard at us there. \n“They’ve got some flair within their backline and some classy midfielders so I’m sure they’ll mix it up.” \nIn a game which offers a semi-final berth to the victor and a ticket home to the loser, Read said the All Blacks were drawing on their remarkable record since they won the last World Cup in 2011. \nThey have played 51 Tests, won 46, drawn two and lost only three. \n“There are learnings you can take from past experiences. Most Test matches for us over the last four years we have learnt a lot about how to get out of a few different situations,” he said. \n“Certainly a play-off game heightens that pressure, that expectation. It’s not about running away from it, it’s getting excited by the challenge.” \nKaino likened the mood in the All Blacks camp to the lead up to when they last played Australia in August. \nAfter being beaten by Australia 27-19 in the Rugby Championship, the fired up All Blacks came back with a dominant 41-13 victory over the Wallabies. \n“It’s similar in terms of form getting into the game,” said Kaino, who has been capped 64 times. \n“We’re slowly building and we made a step in the right direction in our last game.” — AFP", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-14T02:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T02:35:45.540+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
