(Photo: KYLE GRANTHAM/THE NEWS JOURNAL) \nPHILADELPHIA It’s October, and there are openings at major college football programs. \nSo, of course, rumors are circulating that Eagles coach Chip Kelly might be a candidate at schools like Southern California, South Carolina and Maryland. \nKelly has responded to similar rumors since joining the Eagles in 2013. On Thursday, he seemed angrier when asked about the speculation. Kelly denied that USC or any other school contacted him or his agent. He joked instead that North Texas State has contacted him. \n“The Armadillos, or whatever,” he said with a laugh. \nThen he turned serious: “Just keep asking questions like this in the press conference and it’ll be over quicker,” Kelly said. “I know you have an obligation[to ask], and I understand that. It’s going to happen -- we’re not successful, we’re not winning, I came from college and I’m going to go back to college.” \nThen Kelly referenced Giants coach Tom Coughlin when he said: “I hope someday, it’ll be like Coach Coughlin, win enough games where I can stay around long enough without speculation.” \nKelly was then asked if it’s a distraction for him. \n“It’s an unfortunate part of the game because the other part of it is there are people who have lost their jobs,” he said. “A friend of mine in [former USC coach] Steve Sarkisian is dealing with a big issue right now. I wish him the best out of the whole thing and that’s how I look at the whole thing.” \nSarkisian was placed on an indefinite leave of absence earlier this week, then fired. Steve Spurrier stepped down at South Carolina and Randy Edsall was fired at Maryland. Kelly, of course, spent four seasons coaching at the University of Oregon before taking the Eagles’ job. \nKelly was also asked if the rumors will undermine his authority with the players. \n“Our players couldn’t care less about it,” he said. “Ask them, I guess. I don’t think Jason Kelce is concerned that my name came up with a college. He’s concerned with going against [Giants’ defensive coordinator] Steve Spagnuolo’s defense, which is first and foremost on our team right now.” \nThe players agreed. \n“That’s news to me,” wide receiver Jordan Matthews said. “That’s kind of crazy. I just know that he’s going to be here when we play the Giants … Usually, if your coach’s name is in rumors for a coaching job means that he’s a good coach. I’m glad I’m playing for a good coach. So I’ll take it.” \nThird down woes \nThe last two games, the Eagles have allowed opponents to convert on third down 51.5 percent of the time (17 of 33). A lot of those conversions have come on third-and-long. The Eagles rank tied for 26th, allowing their opponents to convert 42.1 percent of the time. \n“It’s just like we were offensively when we weren’t successful,” Kelly said. “We need to execute. And playing really good third-down defense is critical to being a good defensive football team.” \nEagles linebacker DeMeco Ryans said it’s demoralizing to allow an opponent to convert in those third-and-long situations. \n“We should win that battle most of the time,” he said. “We’ve been coming up on the short end of the stick a lot, which is unfortunate. That causes us to go out there and play extra plays, which I think is really self-inflicted.” \nInjury update \nWR Nelson Agholor (ankle), LB Mychal Kendricks (hamstring), LB Kiko Alonso (knee) and DE Brandon Bair (groin) didn’t practice for a second straight game. For the Giants, ESPN is reporting the CB Prince Amukamara could miss 3-4 weeks with a pectoral muscle injury. \nContact Martin Frank at mfrank@delawareonline.com . Follow on Twitter @Mfranknfl.
