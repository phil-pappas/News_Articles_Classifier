Sister Lynn Marie Welbig, of the Presentation Sisters, spoke at the EmBe Women's Leadership Program. It turns out a woman who's taken a vow of poverty knows a lot about the business world. \nWelbig doesn't preach a Prosperity Gospel that promises riches to those who follow her advice. Instead, she stresses the importance of service to others over profits. \n\"We don't go out and get a cabin by the woods or in Florida; that's not how we do things. We keep our resources so we can use them for ministry, especially for the poor,\" Welbig said. \nWelbig says the entrepreneurial spirit often involves a leap of faith. And her Presentation Sisters have a history of putting their faith into action, well before South Dakota even became a state. \n\"We started in Dakota Territory with nothing, and within the first 11 years, the sisters started nine schools and parishes and four hospitals,\" Welbig said. \nWomen attending this conference say there is a spiritual element to entrepreneurship. After all, it requires a lot of soul-searching to start your own business. \n\"Internally, when we ask ourselves, 'Why do I want to be an entrepreneur?' A lot of times it's for freedom, for flexibility, financial growth is definitely in there, but more than anything, I think you have to have that spirit inside of you to drive you,\" life coach & business consultant Jackie Johnson said. \nWelbig says gatherings like this, where women network and share ideas, are much like a religious community where entrepreneurs can call upon a higher power to help get their businesses off the ground. \nJohnson says she and other entrepreneurs can relate to Welbig's vow of poverty since they invest so much of their own money into getting their businesses started.
