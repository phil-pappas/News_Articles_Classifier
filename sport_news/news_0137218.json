Sean Carson / Union Democrat, Copyright 2015. In a classroom filled with percussion instruments begging to be banged together, second graders focused on “silent, smart” listening Tuesday at Curtis Creek Elementary School. The students were among several kindergarten through fourth-grade classes to participate in a weekly music class funded by a $10,200 state grant awarded to the Tuolumne County Arts Alliance, called Artists in Schools. The grant brought back teacher Louis McPeeters, a 33-year arts teacher at the school and repeat instructor for Artists in Schools. She teaches the class in the Orff-Schulwerk technique — a method of music instruction that incorporates movement, language, rhythm, theater and percussion. Less than a month into instruction, McPeeters is still adjusting her curriculum to the different classes. “I’m going to have the kids up and moving more today, so they’re feeling the rhythms physically,” she said before the second-graders entered the room. Sing-alongs with hand gestures, dances and hiding behind large cardboard boxes occupied most of the 45-minute class. “When you learn things kinesthetically you internalize them, so students become more musically literate and understand rhythms better,” she said. In contrast, the third-grade class just before spent more time listening to classic flute music and learning a three-part percussion piece for xylophones. McPeeters also planned to have the second-graders listen for dynamics, for tone color and song parts while moving about the room. The students began with a sing-a-long while McPeeters strummed on her guitar. Songs used for the class are often echoed back, explained McPeeters. “They learn things really fast that way,” she said. The bulk of Tuesday was spent familiarizing the students with the sounds of different percussion. McPeeters gave each student an instrument and asked whether it fell into the wood, metal or drum percussion family. When called on, students whacked, shook, or jingled their new sound maker for everyone to see and hear. Finally, individual students hid behind colorful boxes and played the instrument, while the rest of the class had to guess what was making the sound. “This is the first music class I’ve had my whole life,” said student Jude York. “I don’t think I’ll be a musician, but I really like playing.” His classmate Keira Travis said McPeeters teaches the class because “she wants us to know how much joy music brings.” Anne Brosnan, the students’ teacher, said it’s amazing how quickly her class has picked things up. “I mean they’re 8 years old and playing music … it’s remarkable!” Brosnan said. The class, which Brosnan described as the “highlight of the week,” has helped students with memorization and attentiveness in other subjects.
