If found guilty he could face up to five years in jail.\nBut Klay BBJ, according to his lawyer Ghazi Mrabet, has denied using drugs.\nThe rapper, born Ahmed ben Ahmed, was detained in Tunis along with two other people as they were preparing to attend a concert in Hammamet further south, said Mrabet.\nIn 2013 he was sentenced to 21 months in prison along with fellow rapper Weld El 15 for insulting a public servant, in a case that sparked controversy in Tunisia and calls by rights groups for their release.\nTheir sentence was later reduced to six months but the pair appealed the ruling and were eventually acquitted.\nKlay BBJ is known for writing lyrics that criticise authorities, namely the security forces.\nHis lawyer said he could be referred to court on Monday, and that authorities could accuse him of having consumed narcotics under so-called law 52.\nThe legislation which was adopted in 1992, during the reign of the now ousted autocratic regime, has been used to try and jail rappers who have been critical of the security forces.\nA civil society group known as \"Prisoner 52\" has been seeking the scrapping of law 52 which they say is used as a tool to repress freedom of expression.\nFor more arts and culture news and updates, follow Ahram Online Arts and Culture on Twitter at @AhramOnlineArts and on Facebook at Ahram Online: Arts & Culture", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/AhramOnlineArts", "https://www.facebook.com/ahramonlinearts"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T04:20:29.838+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
