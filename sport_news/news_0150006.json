The Tigers returned a pair of kickoffs deep into San Jose State territory, giving their struggling offense an easier distance to work with. \nQuarterback Joe Gray finished 21 for 33 with 224 yards and a touchdown. He threw two interceptions, including a key play in the first quarter when Auburn linebacker Justin Garrett caught the ball after it was deflected by cornerback Blake Countess, and the Tigers punched in the first of four touchdowns by running back Peyton Barber soon after, putting San Jose State in a hole they weren't able to climb out of. \nTailback Tyler Ervin, fresh off his 300-yard game against Fresno State last week, rushed for 160 yards, but he fumbled once on a 4th down dive that was recovered by Auburn. He collected a 2-yard touchdown with just under 5 minutes left, which pulled the Spartans within 28-21.
