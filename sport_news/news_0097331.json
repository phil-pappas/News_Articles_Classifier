Although they faded in the final month, they still qualified for the playoffs for just the second time since 2007.\nA seven-game loss to the Washington Capitals in the first round provided a disappointing ending to the Isles’ final season at Nassau Coliseum, but there were reasons for optimism as they looked forward to moving into their new home at Barclays Center in Brooklyn.\nFor this season to be a success, however, John Tavares and Co. must take the next step.\nJust making the playoffs is no longer good enough for this team. The organization hasn’t celebrated a postseason series victory since 1993. Anything short of that this season will be a major disappointment.\nIn captain John Tavares, the Islanders have one of the best players in the league. For much of his first six NHL seasons, however, he had an inferior supporting cast around him.\nThat is no longer the case.\nAlthough Snow didn’t make any major upgrades to his roster in the off-season, young players such as Ryan Strome, Anders Lee, Brock Nelson and Calvin de Haan all have another year of experience to help out \"veterans\" such as Tavares, 25, Kyle Okposo 27, and goaltender Jaroslav Halak.\nThe battle for Eastern Conference playoff spots will be more difficult this season with Columbus expected to rebound from an injury-plagued 2014-15 campaign and a young Florida team on the rise. Winning in the playoffs, obviously, will be even harder.\nThe window for success can close pretty quickly in the NHL, though. The Islanders earned credit for their efforts in first-round losses to Pittsburgh in 2013 and Washington last season, but another like those this season would feel like a step back.\nConversely, playing a couple of postseason rounds next spring would help the Isles make Barclays Center feel more like home and, perhaps, encourage more fans — either in Brooklyn or on Long Island — to embrace the move.\nEmail: gulitti@northjersey.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T04:20:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:41:30.988+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
