If you need proof of that, just watch this video of the Milford Mighty Mites from Milford, Mass. They’re all lined up and ready to run a play when Silento ’s “Watch Me” starts playing and, well, you know what happens next.\nSome players—mostly offensive players—continue to play, but the rest of them do the Whip and the Nae Nae and complete ignore their assignments. The result? The easiest touchdown you’ll ever see.\nDespite the outcome here, these kids deserve ALL the participation trophies for this amazing performance.\nSend all complaints, compliments, and tips to sportstips@complex.com .\n[ via SB Nation ]", "external_links": ["http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2015/10/7/9469525/football-is-better-when-all-the-players-are-tiny-and-hitting-the-whip"], "published": "2015-10-08T17:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T19:07:05.096+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
