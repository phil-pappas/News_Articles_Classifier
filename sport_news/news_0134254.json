Apart from the rehabilitation of September 2014 flood victims, people of the Chenab basin, refugees, traders, students and the civil society are looking forward to the PM’s visit. Below is a list of what various sections of society expect and hope from Modi’s visit. Tourism needs a boost\nThe negative image of Jammu and Kashmir being projected outside the state is hurting the traders’ community the most. The influx of tourists to the state has gone down. Traders want the Prime Minister to clear the air about the state so that more tourists can come back to the state. “We expect the Prime Minister to send a positive message to the rest of the country and ask tourists to visit the state, which is also in the best interest of the trading community. Tourism is the backbone of the state and our business is also dependent on tourists,” said Sahil Malhotra, former senior vice-president of the Heritage Raghunath Bazar Traders’ Association. A lot of talk in going on among traders over the expected economic package and they feel the government must keep in mind the interests of the trading community while announcing any such package. “We do not want the government to only focus on areas directly impacting the trading community, but it must also improve inter-city connectivity, vital for any business to flourish,” said Malhotra. He hoped that keeping in view the fast growing economy and development, inter-city metro rail and intra-city monorail projects should be announced. Refugees await rehab\nJammu is home to West Pakistan refugees, Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) refugees, Kashmiri migrants and migrants from other parts of the Jammu region. They have been waiting for redress of their grievances. The West Pakistan Refugees have been demanding citizenship rights in the state while PoK refugees want a respectable economic package for their rehabilitation. Displaced Kashmiri Pandits want their issue be dealt with on their terms and other migrants want similar facilities like the Kashmir migrants. “Our main issue is of citizenship rights. During my meeting with PM Modi on May 7 this year, he seemed committed to addressing our issue. Our community, which has been searching its identity for the past 67 years, is pinning hopes on his visit,” said Labha Ram Gandhi, leader of the West Pakistan refugees. He said the community wanted a solution to their problem and if it was not done by November, they would hold a protest within the state and in Delhi. Leader of PoK refugees Rajiv Chunni believes that they have the first right on any economic package. “I am not demeaning the sufferings of the flood victims or others, but the PM must make it clear that the PoK refugees get the first share from any economic package as we are the most deserving,” said Chunni. Panun Kashmir leader Ajay Chrungoo, an organisation of the displaced Kashmir Pandits, said: “We want the Prime Minister to change his basic framework of rehabilitation of Kashmir Hindus. He should not see the issue through the prism of economic package, but we want him to address this as reversing religious cleansing.” Baglihar project hazards\nThree districts of Ramban, Doda and Kishtwar have the potential to generate 16,000 MW of electricity and a couple of hydel projects are already producing electricity in the area. The successive governments in the state and the Centre have not addressed the problems of the people of the three districts, arising due to creation of hydroelectric projects. “The Baglihar-II power project, which will be inaugurated by the PM, may have come as a good news for the rest of the state, but the Chenab region is not happy. The government is oblivious to the impending disaster in the area which is half of the total area of Jammu division. We expect that at least 25 per cent of the revenue, generated from Baglihar and other projects be paid as royalty to the Chenab region for development and taking measures to safeguard against hazards of the project,” said Syed Asim Hashmi, president of Bar association of Doda. The Chenab region is facing a threat due to the creation of a water reservoir for the hydropower project. Students want clarity on AIIMS The student community wants that the PM to address issues concerning it. “We want him to clear the air on establishment of AIIMS in Jammu. The PM must use his good offices to remove faulty recruitment policy in the state and also revive the PM scholarship scheme for J&K students,” said Neeraj Kundan, leader of the National Students Union of India.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T02:04:55.088+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
