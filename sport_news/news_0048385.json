Jones, USA TODAY Sports © ASSOCIATED PRESS ASSOCIATED PRESS Los Angeles police confirmed that a home invasion and robbery occurred at the home of Washington Redskins wide receiver DeSean Jackson in Tarzana, Calif.\nAdChoices Jackson was not home at the time of the incident, but there were five adults in the house when four armed males broke in early in the morning of Oct. 21, detective Tracey Angeles of the LAPD’s West Valley Division told USA TODAY Sports.\nTMZ first reported the incident Friday morning.\nOne of the occupants of the home was injured in the attack while fighting off the intruders, Angeles said.\nAngeles said suspects have not yet been identified.\n“We’re following up on every lead we have,” Angeles said.\nJackson, a Los Angeles native, is currently with his team in Virginia. Jackson has not played since the season opener on Sept. 13 because of a nagging hamstring injury. He has no catches this season.\n“He’ll get to the bottom of it, as will the police, and we’ll go from there,” Washington head coach Jay Gruden said Friday morning.\nTMZ reported on Friday that the incident could be gang related, but Angeles said it would be “premature” to classify it as such. She could not say if it appears the house, or any specific occupants, was targeted.\nIn an interview with ESPN The Magazine last year, Jackson admitted that he still associated with people in gangs that he knew from his youth, but that he was not in, nor ever had been, in a gang.\nFollow Lindsay H.
