Coleman is being held without bail, as is common until he appears before a judge for a bail hearing.\nThe Seahawks have suspended Coleman indefinitely pending further information, a team spokesperson said in a statement.\nAccording to a law-enforcement source, Coleman was driving a Dodge pickup around 6 p.m. when his vehicle struck a Honda Civic.\nAfter the crash, Coleman, who did not appear to be hurt, got out of his car and walked away. The other driver was hurt in the crash, possibly breaking a collarbone, a law-enforcement source said.\nBellevue police found Coleman nearby. He was arrested without incident.\nA field-sobriety test was performed on Coleman. There's no indication on the report if he was intoxicated, the source said.\nColeman's agents, Derrick Fox and Mark Bloom, later released a statement about the incident, which read in part: \"While the facts of the case are still being determined, it seems Derrick may have fallen asleep while driving home from a Seahawks facility. The health and well-being of all involved is our primary concern, and we are thankful to report that both parties are expected to make a full recovery. We will continue to work closely with the local officials while a full investigation is being conducted.\"\nColeman, 24, has played in 22 games since joining the Seahawks in 2013, with six starts, two this year. He missed the last 11 games of last season after he broke a foot during pregame warmups against the St. Louis Rams.\nHe has one yard on two carries this season and one reception for no yards, with his greatest value coming as a blocker. He is also regarded as one of Seattle's best special teams players.\nColeman has been essentially deaf since age 3, when he lost his hearing seemingly overnight, once telling The Seattle Times, \"It just kind of went away. We don't really know why.\" He uses hearing aids and has been featured as a role model for the hearing-impaired in national advertising.\nWidely recruited out of Troy High in Fullerton, Calif., he played four years at UCLA, where he gained 1,780 yards and also earned second team All-Pac-12 honors as a senior as a special teams performer in 2011.\nAfter being released by the Vikings in 2012 in training camp he was signed by the Seahawks on Dec. 5, 2012.He wrote a book, \"No Excuses: Growing Up Deaf and Achieving My Super Bowl Dreams,\" that was published in July.\nSeattle Times staff reporters Bob Condotta and Evan Bush contributed to this report.\n(c)2015 The Seattle Times\nVisit The Seattle Times at www.seattletimes.com\n ", "external_links": ["http://twitter.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1738448&hashtags=ArcaMax", "http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1738448&h=Seahawks%27+Coleman+suspended+after+arrest+for+investigation+of+hit+and+run", "https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://www.arcamax.com/sports/football/s-1738448"], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T08:02:59.399+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
