THOMPSON — Veteran drivers Scott Sundeen and Larry Barnett had been down this road before. “I know I can race with Larry any time, inside, outside, because we might touch sometimes, but we will never take each other out,” Sundeen said. “I told him (Sunday) morning, if I lost the championship to him – I don’t want to lose to anybody – it would be OK with me.” Coming into the final race of the season for the Limited Sportsman Division at the World Series of Speedway Racing at Thompson Speedway Motorsports Park Sunday, Sundeen led Barnett by all of four points for the season title The easiest way to decide it for Sundeen was to beat Barnett in the 20-lap feature. The Sutton, Mass. driver accomplished that with a fourth-place overall finish to capture his fourth track championship of his career. Barnett finished sixth overall in the first of five feature races. “It was awesome,” Sundeen said. “My goal was to beat one car and one car only and that’s what I did.” Sundeen was bothered by some lapped traffic early in the race and he was forced to put his car in “places that I really didn’t want to.” Sundeen went low and found an open lane midway through the race while Barnett got caught up in traffic and never recovered. Corey Hutchings had a different goal in mind. The Salem driver figured a large field would mean a rather ticklish race and such was the case with multiple caution flags. The safest place to be, in Hutchings’ mind, was out in front. Hutchings took the lead on the eighth lap and was able to hold off Josh Wood for the seventh win of his career on World Series weekend. “Ending the season on a high is great because it’s a long offseason. Thinking about it when you finish 15th, it’s like, ‘Oh, I sucked.’ Winning the last race of the season is the ultimate high,”Hutchings said. Sunoco Modifieds Woody Pitkat calls his team, “the little train that could.” It was just in January that Pitkat, who didn’t have a Sunoco Modified ride at the end of the 2014 season, joined up with car owner Stan Mertz. “It’s a low-buck team,” Pitkat said. “Norm Perry and Dennis Perry work their butts off on this car. Obviously, we were really consistent this year and nothing fell off the car. I really wanted to win (Sunday) and I thought we had it.” Page 2 of 2 - Instead, the script remained consistent for the No. 6 car. Pitkat took the lead on a 10th lap restart and held it until another restart on lap 27. Ryan Preece took advantage of an incident involving Michael Gervais and went low through turn one, rolling out ahead of Pitkat. “We couldn’t get in the right lane on restarts and Woody was able to get a good jump and I was able to push him which kind of set us up for the last two-lap deal,” Preece said in Victory Lane. It was the fifth runner-up finish for Pitkat who did not win a Sunoco Modified race this season. “It wasn’t meant to be,” Pitkat said. “It really stinks when you come to this last race and you get these people who you haven’t run with all year and they cause cautions.” It was the second championship of the weekend for Pitkat who also took the Modified Racing Series title on Saturday. ISMA Dave Shullick Jr. has been running in the shadow of his father, one of the legends in Super Modified racing. That will be the case no more. The son surpassed the father on the all-time win list this year and on Sunday accomplished something his father never did, won the points championship for the International Super Modified Association. “In a sport where your father is a legend, you always look for things that he never did to kind of make your own legacy and this is one thing he has never done – it’s pretty awesome,” Shullick said in Victory Lane. Shullick lapped three-quarters of the field to win his fifth race of the season. Vernon’s Rob Summers placed second. NEMA Lites Anthony Payne has only run on the NEMA Lite circuit for two years, but he has already established himself as the driver to beat. Payne, following in the footsteps of his father, Joey, thought he had a chance to do very well. “I came into this season with a full head of steam, wanted to win a championship, and wanted to win some races,” Payne said. Scott Bigelow captured the checkered flag in the 20-lap feature.
