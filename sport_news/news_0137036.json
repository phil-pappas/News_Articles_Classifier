He has been wearing a protective boot and apparently suffered a lower-leg injury in UW's 24-7 victory.\n\"I don't know,\" defensive coordinator Dave Aranda said Wednesday when asked if Goldberg would be ready to face Illinois on Saturday. \"I'm hoping for the best. But nothing is final.\"\nAranda shifted Goldberg inside and moved nose tackle Conor Sheehy to end against Purdue. Goldberg recorded three assisted tackles, Sheehy had two assisted tackles and end Chikwe Obasih recorded four assisted tackles, including a sack.\nThat front helped tie up blockers to allow linebackers T.J. Edwards (16 tackles) and Chris Orr (seven tackles) to run to the football.\nUW limited Purdue to 55 rushing yards on 29 carries.\n\"I think we did a good job dominating the line of scrimmage and pushing them the other way to make sure our linebackers are free,\" Obasih said. \"We knew that's what Purdue's game plan would be, given how we had played. We hadn't solidified the run yet.\n\"We took it as disrespect that they were coming in trying to run the ball most of the first half. We really took it to heart.\"\nFreshman Olive Sagapolu filled in for Goldberg with the No. 1 defense Wednesday. Sagapolu has a total of six assisted tackles in seven games.\nIllinois averages 137.5 rushing yards per game, the No. 13 mark in the league. The Illini, which had a bye last week, have two solid tailbacks.\nFreshman Ke'Shawn Vaughn averages 4.1 yards per carry and 65.3 yards per game. Senior Josh Ferguson averages 5.3 yards per carry and 76.2 yards per game but has been sidelined with a shoulder injury.\n\"We'll see how Illinois responds to how we performed this past week,\" Obasih said. \"They've had two weeks to prepare....We'll see what their game plan is.\"\nTindal ready to play: Although Goldberg appears unlikely to play, UW should have reserve cornerback Derrick Tindal .\nTindal suffered what initially appeared to be an ugly knee injury covering a kickoff on the first play of the fourth quarter against Purdue. The injury was only a bruise, however, and Tindal has worked all week.\n\"I think everything is positive now,\" Aranda said. \"He is doing some work with us now. He is still in one of those (no-contact) jerseys, but I anticipate that will be coming off soon.\n\"He went through everything today.\"\nFellow cornerback Sojourn Shelton watched closely while Tindal was on the field being examined by the training staff. He still hasn't watched the replay, however.\n\"I heard it was bad,\" Shelton said. \"I heard it was really bad. He said it was a bad replay, but I'm not good at looking at stuff like that because I get grossed out.\"\nEndicott out: Kickoff specialist Andrew Endicott last week appeared to aggravate a leg injury that caused him to miss the Big Ten opener against Iowa. He has not kicked this week and according to special teams coach Chris Haering he has been receiving treatment.\nJack Russell replaced Endicott on kickoffs against Purdue. He had one touchback on three kickoffs and averaged 61.3 yards per kick.\nKickoffs could be important against the Illini. UW allows only 15.6 yards per return, but Illinois senior V'Angelo Bentley averages 24.6 yards per return.\n ", "external_links": ["http://analytics.apnewsregistry.com/analytics/v2/image.svc/JSI/RWS/jsonline.com/CAI/335414331/E/prod/PC/Basic/AT/A"], "published": "2015-10-22T10:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T10:38:46.824+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
