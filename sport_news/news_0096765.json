That's always going to be the goal. Whether we get there or not, it depends on us and what we do and how we do it, but that's always our big-picture goal.\"\nPerhaps that's why Anthony appears so patient.\nHe's 31 years old, an age when few top players are interested in a gradual building process. But Anthony doesn't seem disappointed or dispirited, and he certainly hasn't been demanding â€” at least, not publicly.\n\"What I see in Melo is how he feels personally, good or bad, about anything, I think he will say it if he feels like he needs to say it, but when he doesn't feel like it needs to be said, or people publicly need to know what he's feeling or how he's thinking, he doesn't say it,\" Knicks coach Derek Fisher said. \"And I think that says a lot about who he is.\"\nKobe Bryant threw a fit in 2007 when the Lakers had fallen from title contention and even indicated he wanted out of Los Angeles. Dwyane Wade made it clear in 2009 after Miami couldn't get out of the first round that the Heat better get him some help in South Florida.\nBryant said a couple of years ago that Anthony may need to follow his example, be so pushy that management can't ignore him. But Anthony can't, or won't.\n\"That's just me,\" he said after practice at the U.S. Military Academy . \"It's hard for me to kind of lose my patience and get upset about something that pretty much you can't control. Only thing I can control is what goes on on the basketball court.\"\nMaybe, as Anthony begins the second year of a $124 million contract, he's OK if the Knicks will not be better than expected. No temper tantrum appears imminent.\nFor now, Anthony is content to be playing again. He made it through a career-low 40 games last season before knee surgery and said the time off helped put things in perspective.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T04:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-01T16:50:44.420+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
