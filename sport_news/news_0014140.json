He has not absorbed a loss since Aug. 20, and he was the winning pitcher against the Royals in Game 2. \nThe Royals will counter with their key midseason acquisition, right-hander Johnny Cueto, who is 2-6 since Aug. 15, not including his loss in Game 2. \n---Seattle Mariners second baseman Robinson Cano underwent sports hernia surgery on Tuesday in Philadelphia. \nRecovery is expected to take six weeks after the procedure to repair the right- and left-side core muscles performed by Dr. William Meyers of the Vincera Institute. Cano should be ready in plenty of time for spring training next February. The injury was diagnosed in late September on Cano's right side, but an MRI revealed a hernia on the other side. \nIn 156 games this past season for the Mariners, the 32-year-old Cano batted .287 with 21 home runs, 79 RBIs, 82 runs, 34 doubles and one triple. He hit .330 with 17 homers, 55 RBIs and 52 runs in the final half of the 2015 season. \n---The San Diego Padres are interviewing former major league infielder Alex Cora for their vacant manager's job, CBS Sports reported Tuesday. \nCora currently works as a baseball analyst for ESPN and has no professional coaching experience, but he played in the major leagues from 1998 to 2011 for six teams. \nThe 39-year-old Cora also has been mentioned in connection with manager openings in Washington and Miami. \nThe Padres' vacancy was created when the team dismissed interim manager Pat Murphy after finishing 74-88 in 2015. Murphy replaced ousted manager Bud Black in June. Distributed by LAKANA and The Sports Xchange.
