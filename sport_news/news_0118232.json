(Curtis Compton/Atlanta-Journal Constitution via AP) MARIETTA DAILY OUT, GWINNETT DAILY POST OUT, LOCAL TV OUT (WXIA, WGCL, FOX 5) By Garry Smits garry.smits@jacksonville.com \nThere is no easy answer for Lucas Glover’s decline, which bottomed out when he lost his PGA Tour card in August only six years after winning the 2009 U.S. Open and only four years after the last of his three PGA Tour titles. \nBut when the card ceremony is held behind the TPC Sawgrass clubhouse on Sunday, Glover, a St. Simons Island, Georgia, resident, will be there. The only issue is whether he also will accept the trophy for winning the Web.com Tour Championship. \nGlover, playing in the first group of the day off No. 1, birdied three of his first four holes at Dye’s Valley on Friday, shot a 67 and is in second place alone at 9-under-par 131. \nTwo groups after Glover finished, Emliano Grillo (64) holed his second shot at the 18th hole for an eagle-two (he used a 9-iron from 175 yards out) to finish at 10-under 130. That’s where they stayed as the afternoon wave yielded few low scores. \nD.H. Lee (67) and Chez Reavie (65) are at 8 under. Brett Stegmaier (66) is at 7 under, with Sam Saunders (69) and Hiroshi Iwata (67). \nGlover, relegated to the Finals after finishing outside the top 125 on the PGA Tour’s FedEx Cup points list, was assured of returning to the Tour after a tie for ninth last week in Columbus, Ohio, on the heels of a tie for 22nd and a tie for 25th in the first two Finals events. \nThat means Glover can stroll the Valley pressure-free. \n“I’m excited, confident,” he said. “I’m happy to have some confidence putting.” \nThat’s the main reason Glover fell from 18th in the world and 17th in FedEx Cup points in 2009 to 432nd in the world and 147th in points this summer. He has averaged 180th on the PGA Tour’s strokes gained putting index in the last three seasons and this year was 183rd in making putts of 10 feet or less. \nHe has never lost his combination of power and accuracy off the tee and into the greens. He was sixth in the Tour’s ball-striking statistic this season, 13th in 2014 and 28th in 2013. But he made only 43 percent of his cuts and had only two top-10 finishes. \nAfter endless tinkering, Glover found a solution. \n“I settled on something, instead of changing putters, mechanics, this, that,” he said. “I said here’s what it’s going to be, so do it.” \nThere were also difficulties off the course. He injured his right knee in January of 2012 in a paddleboarding mishap and had only 16 starts. He went through a divorce, split ways with his old swing coach and changed equipment. \nBut he’s been happily married since the fall of 2011 to wife Krista (he moved to St. Simons Island about that time), and she gave birth to their second child, Lucas Jr., on July 31. They have a girl, Lucille. Since his son was born, Glover has tied for 18th at the Wyndham Championship in a valiant effort to keep his card (he had three rounds in the 60s) and finished 25th or better in three Finals events. \n“I’ll check [the score] on Sunday night,” he said. “I’ll try to get everything out of every round I can and see where we fall.” \nGrillo, who is 48th on the European Tour money list and fifth on the Finals money list, has had some good experiences on the property. He tied for second in the 2010 Junior Players Championship with Jordan Spieth. \nStegmaier, 32, also is assured of his Tour card, a nice prize at the end of a long road since undergoing two wrist surgeries, leaving the game to become an assistant golf pro, then deciding to give the Tour one more try. \nHe was outside the top 75 on the Web.com Tour money list entering the final regular-season event in Portland. Stegmaier finished seventh to make the Finals, then posted a pair of top 10s in the first two Finals events to lock up his card. He’s eighth in Finals earnings entering the week. \n“Portland saved my season and probably my career,” he said.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T08:23:30.609+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
