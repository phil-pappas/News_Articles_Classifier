Rigsby Tractor-trailers would no longer be able to park in residential areas under an amended ordinance under consideration in the city of Springfield.\nCurrent city rules only prohibit big trucks from parking on city right-of-way, according to City Manager Brett Bennett.\nBennett said the city receives complaints every week from people who are annoyed by big trucks tearing up curbs and lawns and making a lot of noise in subdivisions.\nHe said complaints have come from residents in Deer Run, Cedar Creek and Spring Branch subdivisions, where big trucks sometimes park between houses.\nBennett said some private property owners also have asked the city to prevent the large trucks from parking on their land.\nTwo big trucks, one pulling a container and another hauling pine trees, were parked on the privately-owned part of the parking lot next to City Hall one day last week.\nThe ordinance that was given first reading at the city council’s Oct. 13 meeting would prevent tractor-trailers from parking within 150 feet of any residentially zoned property.\nBennett said that distance is likely to be made bigger as discussion continues about the ordinance.\nPublic hearings are scheduled on the proposed changes at 6:30 p.m. on Dec. 7, at the planning and zoning board, and at 6 p.m. on Dec. 8 at a city council meeting.\nCouncil members will vote on the ordinance after the public hearing on Dec. 8.\nBennett said the ordinance likely will include a provision that drivers of tractor-trailers who have permission to park on private property, which isn’t in a residential area, must display written permission in the truck. That would be so that police officers can enforce the ordinance.\nThe measure also calls for big truck parking to be prohibited on public rights-of-way, where they would obstruct visibility of vehicle traffic or pedestrian movement or where they would interfere with access by emergency vehicles or equipment.\nIt would include exceptions for construction activity, loading or unloading, vehicles for sale by a permitted business, paper recycling or nonprofit groups and vehicles used by permitted businesses.\nOther action\nIn other action on Oct. 13, the city council agreed unanimously to spend $87,800 to build sidewalks on Early Street, from Ash Street to the courthouse. Bennett said the city will pay Jerry D. Rushing Construction Co. of Statesboro to do the work.\nThe 6-foot-wide concrete sidewalk, which will be paid for with penny sales tax money, will be built on the north side of the street, Bennett said.\nBennett said the goal is to complete a loop of sidewalks around the city.\nThe work should take less than 90 days and could start anytime, or after the first of the year, depending on what else the contractor is doing.\nAlso on Oct. 13, the council agreed unanimously to renew its standing as a City of Ethics as defined by the Georgia Municipal Association.\nThe city council members pledged to: serve others, not ourselves; use resources with efficiency and economy; treat all people fairly; use the power of our position for the well-being of our constituents; and create an environment of honesty, openness and integrity.\nThe mayor and all council members will sign the pledge.", "external_links": ["http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/story_slideshow_thumb/CITYOFSPRINGFIELD_1.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/superphoto/CITYOFSPRINGFIELD_1.jpg", "http://sav-cdn.com/sites/all/themes/savannahnow/images/blank.gif"], "published": "2015-10-21T20:19:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:05:43.836+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
