A four-man group, led by Sweden’s Per Barth, won the Sheikh Maktoum Dubai Open last month, shared fifth a further shot adrift. \nAttributing his solid allround golf to warm weather, Blomstrand said, “I find it a lot easier to swing in these conditions. \nBarring early hiccups when I bogeyed a couple of holes, I think I played really well, tee to green, and holed some good putts, especially the one on the 16th that I sank from 16 feet.” \n“This event has provided me with a perfect opportunity to warm up for the second stage of the European Tour qualifier. With so many players shooting well, it just shows how good the standard of golf on the tour is,” said the 23 year old from Skanor, Sweden. \nKunzenbacher, the 22 year old German, eagled the par-five 13th, smashing his six-iron from 200 yards to within 40 centimetres of the pin. \nEl Hassani leads the MENA division by four shots from his compatriot Mehdi Saissi. \nScottish youngster Ben Alexander, who shared the overnight lead with Blomstrand, Stuart Archibald and Cyril Suk after opening with a 67, stumbled to a 76, but managed to stay in front in the amateur division at one under par where he is joined by India’s Rayhan Thomas, who followed his opening 70 with a 73. \nThe cut was made at four over 148 with 45 professionals and ten amateurs making it to the final round. \nOman's Azaan al Rumhy made a quiet exit as he carded 79 for a total of 16 over par 160.
