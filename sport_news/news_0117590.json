He insists he has just as much life in him as he did when he burst onto the scene as a 16-year-old for Everton. \n\"I physically feel good and obviously it's a big birthday in anyone's life, your 30th birthday, but in terms of me and football I still feel I am still young enough, and that I have a lot of years ahead of me,\" the forward said ahead of United's Champions League game against CSKA Moscow. \n\"I have had no major muscle injuries and I think, with all the support we get, it's still a fairly young age and hopefully I have got a lot of years to come.\" \nRooney returns to the city where he enjoyed the best night of his career on Wednesday. \nFor the United striker, Moscow is synonymous with glory. On a sodden night in the Russian capital seven years ago, Rooney and his team-mates defeated Chelsea on penalties to clinch United's third European Cup. \nThe venue may be different - CSKA Moscow play in the Khimki Arena, not the Luzhniki Stadium - but the feeling of going back to Moscow remains the same for Rooney. \n\"It was the highlight of my career,\" the United captain said. \" It is a massive competition to play in, to win the trophy it's obviously great memories.\" \nThe Champions League has brought Rooney pain in his career too. \nHe has been on the losing team on two occasions. Last year he had to watch it from the sidelines because of United's failure to qualify under David Moyes. \nRooney believes those days of failure are a thing of the past now. \nThe former Everton forward is convinced United are starting to become a force to be reckoned with once more under Louis van Gaal. \n\"We want to get back to winning trophies, of course. That is why you play football - to try and be successful, certainly at this club,\" Rooney said. \n\"In the last few years we haven't been good enough. \n\"There has been a big change in the club over the last few years and it's now starting to settle back down into a good rhythm with what the manager wants from us and we are improving. \n\"If we keep going the way we are, keep improving the way we are, then we will have a good chance of being successful.\" Related Sport News", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T09:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T20:16:24.736+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
