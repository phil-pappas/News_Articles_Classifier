Aqib Talib was on his way to the end zone for an interception return. He was already holding the ball out to celebrate near midfield, that's how far in front of everyone he was. Then, if you watch closely, you can see the moment where he realizes who is chasing him.\n\"He was surprised,\" wide receiver Travis Benjamin said on Wednesday after practice. \"From a receiver's standpoint, if you catch an interception on me, it's no freestyling on me. I'm gonna chase you to the end zone no matter what.\"\nBenjamin, who earlier this season said he was the fastest player in the NFL , guessed that he would have caught Talib if he'd have had 10 or 15 more yards. He didn't, of course, but Sunday he'll have more opportunity to show off his wheels on the artificial surface of the Edward Jones Dome in St. Louis.\n\"Oh, it's gonna be fast,\" Benjamin said. \"Every time we're inside a dome, as a skill position unit, for everything it's gonna be a fast pace.\"\nWhen Benjamin isn't chasing down opposing corners or returning punts, of course, he's working on having his best season as a wide receiver. He's already set career highs in receiving yards with 528 and receiving touchdowns with four. He's ranked eighth in the NFL in yards and is tied for 10th with seven catches of 20 or more yards.\n\"Each and every year I got better,\" Benjamin said about his progress as a receiver during his four-year career. \"Each and every year I felt like it was things on the field for me -- this year I want to get better in catching; this year I want to get better in route running -- so this year everything's just coming into part and one for me and it's been a great season so far.\"\nBenjamin's performance this season hasn't gone unnoticed, especially in the Browns' locker room.\n\"After each and every game, from my teammates standpoint to the coaches,\" Benjamin said, \"everybody know, 'Hey, good game last week. Good game last week.' You can see the way they say that, I know they're proud of me and I'm proud to be here to make those plays for these guys.\"\nAqib Talib vs. Josh McCown = Aqib Talib PICK 6.
