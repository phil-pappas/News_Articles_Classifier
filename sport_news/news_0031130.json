On a fourth-and-8 from its own 27-yard line, coach Kyle Flood got gutsy and called for a fake punt. Up-back Sam Bergen took the snap and rumbled around the edge for a 15-yard gain. It was the first career carry for the sixth-year senior blocking fullback. One play later, quarterback Chris Laviano threw a screen pass to wide receiver Leonte Carroo, who raced 58 yards for a momentum-shifting touchdown.\nWORST PLAY\nRutgers had just scored 25 unanswered points to tie the score at 52-52 with 6 minutes, 29 seconds remaining and only needed to convert the point-after try to take the lead. But Kyle Federico's point-after try was blocked. For the second time in the game. The rush came right up the middle so maybe it was the protection's fault. Or maybe the inconsistent Federico needed to kick the ball higher. In total, Rutgers left four points on the field, as it came up short on two two-point conversion attempts. Federico avenged the miss with the game-winning 26-yard field goal on the final play.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-18T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T12:07:51.349+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
