Waterville is 11-2-2 overall this fall and ranked third in Class B North. \nTownsend, who is three wins shy of 250 for his career at Georges Valley and Oceanside, said he tried to convince his players that the important things in Wednesday's game were to play well, enjoy the experience and walk off the field healthy — win, lose or draw. \nWell, the Mariner players decided winning was important and to keep their ship sailing fast and true across the water with another strong overall effort, and earned the league crown — as well as a shiny new plaque to put in the school's trophy case — for good measure. \nOceanside improved to 13-0-2 overall, with regular-season ties against Waterville (2-2) and Mount View of Thorndike (0-0). The Purple Panthers led 2-0 in that earlier regular-season contest before the Mariners rallied late in regulation to tie the contest. \nA rally was not needed Wednesday as Oceanside led 2-0 at halftime and 3-0 before Waterville scored in the second half, as Sophie Webb found the back of the net. \nOceanside held a 10-9 edge in shots and 3-0 advantage in corner kicks. Kalyn Grover made eight saves in the Mariner net and Ally Drew five stops in the Purple Panther goal. \nKelsey Brooks scored with a hard right-footed kick inside the box with 24:15 left in the first half to give Oceanside a 1-0 edge. That proved a confidence boost for the Mariners as Pine then scored on a low shot inside the post with 1:36 remaining to make it 2-0 at halftime. \nThe Mariners did not rest on their first-half laurels and Pine scored a beautiful header goal off Makenna Brooks' corner kick with 36:52 left in the second half. That gave the Mariners breathing room. \nWebb scored for Waterville with 25:16 left in the second half to make it 3-1 and the Purple Panthers did have other scoring chances. \nThe opponents are equally-matched and both made consistent offensive pushes in attempts to crease the net, with the Mariners making the most of their opportunities. \nCoach Townsend won eight to 10 Mountain Valley Conference crowns when he guided the Buccaneers and earned his first league title with Oceanside on Wednesday night. \nIn 15 games, Oceanside has outscored opponents 42-4 — an average of 2.8 goals per game — with 12 shutouts. \nThe Mariners have outscored opponents 20-0 at home this season and held foes scoreless six straight games early in the campaign, and ended the year having not conceded a goal for five straight matches. \nNext on the agenda for the Mariners is the start of what they hope are regional and state title runs. \nThe Mariners will face the winner of the prelim playoff between No. 8 Caribou (8-6) and No. 9 Nokomis of Newport (7-6-1) in a quarterfinal game, time and date to be determined. \nThe Mariners do not face the Vikings during the regular season, but beat the Warriors 2-0 on Oct. 12 in Thomaston.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T06:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T18:47:22.125+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
