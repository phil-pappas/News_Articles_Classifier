We’re waiting for more wind. Currently just 3-4 knots. We need about double that to get racing. More updates as we get them.” \nUpdate 3.36pm: The racing is still delayed. The local TV as well as the app broadcast, we assume was the same feed all broadcasters were getting around the world, has now concluded. It filled the time with showing a replay of the racing in Portsmouth, UK. \nUpdate 3.41pm: The organisers said, “The live TV broadcast has concluded but the racing window remains open until 4PM local [ADT]. In the scenario a race is started before the 4PM deadline, the live stream via AC+ will resume.” \nUpdate 3.51pm: Race deadline of 4pm is closing in, so the Race Committee is making a final attempt to get a race in today. A course will be set up in Hamilton Harbour, the boats have all left their moorings, however the wind is still under 6 knot limit for fair racing so they said it’s a “longshot.” \nUpdate 4.01pm: They have been saying the race deadline is 4pm, however the latest update from the AC said: “Trying for a 16:10 start, in the Harbour… waiting for confirmation from race committee that there is enough wind.” \nUpdate 4.06pm: The AC said “If breeze holds its less than 10 minutes to race start.” Also the broadcast on the app has restarted. \nUpdate 4.19pm: Organisers: “America’s Cup racing is abandoned for today, despite best efforts to race in the Harbour.” Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-17T17:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-17T23:45:23.578+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
