In reply, India were bowled out for 224. The loss was one of the most humiliating that the hosts have ever endured in home conditions. \nThe hosts were expecting a spin-friendly track on Sunday, but the curator had prepared a flat track which favoured the batsmen.

The yardstick will be followed in every case. We need to look into the details first and can't straight away take action against anyone,\" Thakur said while unveiling mobile phone manufacturer Vivo as the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League (IPL) for the next two seasons. \nThe Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary termed the Twenty20 series and ODI series loss as unfortunate, but asserted that the team will come back strongly before the 2016 World T20 which will be held in India. \n\"The team management before the game or after the game whether you win or lose, they go into the details. And during the selection meeting also we talk about the future team and current team and how we can better the performance. It is unfortunate that we lost in the ODI series and also the Twenty20 series,\" Thakur said. \n\"The ODI series was very interesting and the Mumbai game was like a final game. Unfortunately we couldn't do well but I am sure, we will recover well and do well ahead of the T20 World Cup,\" he added. \nSpeaking on the controversies over corruption and match-fixing plaguing the IPL, Thakur said, \"I agree that you can't create success stories overnight and you can't clean up the mess overnight. But I can assure you in the last seven months we have tried our best.\" \n\"We understand our role and I can assure the cricket loving fraternity we are here to deliver and make this game more popular. Sponsors are coming our way so that shows sponsors have faith in us and people have faith in the IPL.\" \n  Related Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-27T00:41:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T23:16:16.789+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
