Meidlinger completed a 22-yard pass to Fauatea before Williams scored on an 8-yard run around right end. Williams added the two-point run and Hunter led 8-0 late in the first quarter.\nDavis put together their best drive of the first half with a couple of nice runs from Smith and Fisher. The Darts drive stalled at the 19-yard line after which Hayden Grange missed a 36-yard field goal.\nThe Darts came out throwing in the first half and pushed deep into Hunter territory before Wolverines defensive back David Mapa picked off an errant Fisher pass.\nFacing a fourth and long deep in their own territory, Williams attempted to pick up the yardage with a fake punt that Davis stuffed setting the Darts up at their own 16 with 6:07 remaining in the third.\nTwo plays later, Smith punched it across on a nifty 14-yard run that brought the Darts within one at 8-7.\nAfter a three-and-out from the Hunter offense, Davis was back in business at the Hunter 42-yard line.\nOn the first play from scrimmage, Fisher dropped a 40-yard bomb into the waiting arms of Mitch Nelson who caught the pass in between two Hunter defenders and took the ball to the 2-yard line. Nick Roberts ' two-yard touchdown run gave the Darts their first lead of the night at 14-8.\n\"We drew up that play and Mitch told me to put it on a line so I put it on a line and he went up and got it,\" Fisher said.\nThe lead lasted all of about 10 seconds as Meidlinger hooked up with Mapa on an 80-yard pass play that gave Hunter the lead 15-14.\nFrom there it was all Davis as Smith scored his second rushing touchdown of the night to extend the lead. Fisher added a late 4-yard rushing score as Davis improved to 5-0 in region 2 with one game remaining, next week against Layton.\n\"Hunter is a great team that has good players and a great coach,\" Davis coach Tyler Gladwell said. \"Give them a lot of credit, our kids had to fight tonight to get this win.\"\nA Davis offense that had just three first downs and 50 yards rushing in the first half turned it around with a dominating performance in the second half. Davis finished with 16 first downs, 161 yards of rushing and 114 yards of timely passing yards.\n\"We didn't have a lot of rhythm in the first half because our possessions were limited,\" Gladwell said. \"We were able to run the ball a little bit in the second half and just having those extra possessions helped our pass offense get going.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T11:13:24.544+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
