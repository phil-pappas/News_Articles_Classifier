Linsey McClain, UVU Athletics Enlarge photoÂ» \nTaylor Kirk put the ball in the back of the net in the 56th minute to lead the   women's soccer team to a 1-0 road win at Missouri-Kansas City on Friday night at Durwood Stadium. \nThe win moves Utah Valley to 6-4-1 overall on the season while improving to 1-0-1 in WAC play. UMKC falls to 7-4-0 overall and 1-1-0 in league play. \n\"I'm so proud of the way the team played tonight against a very good UMKC team,\" Utah Valley head coach Brent Anderson said. \"Our defense has really stepped up over the last few matches, and tonight they were incredible. We were a little soft in the attack in the first half but the team was able to refocus and had a number of good chances in the final 45 minutes.\" \nKirk scored the game-winner in the 56th minute as she received a cross from Sheridan Fox on the right side and fired a shot past the keeper to the far post. The goal marks Kirk's second goal of the season and the seventh of her career. \n\"Sheridan's work on the outside and her cross was pinpoint accurate and Taylor's finish was beautiful,\" Anderson said. \nSenior keeper Jessica Duffin was impressive in the box for Utah Valley as she registered six saves to pick up her fourth shutout win of the year. The clean sheet marks Duffin's 13th career save, which is a UVU all-time shutouts record. \n\"Duffin had another big night in goal and made a few key saves to keep us in the match,\" Anderson said. \nUtah Valley continues WAC road play at Chicago State on Sunday at 12 p.m. MT.
