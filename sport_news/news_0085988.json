The Gunners were looking to use the momentum from Tuesday's 2-0 win over Bayern Munich in the UEFA Champions League to fuel further success in their domestic campaign, as a win here would see them go to the top of the table for the first time in 20 months. Arsenal 2 - Everton 1 \nIn the 36th minute, Mesut Ozil's cross finds Olivier Giroud, who nods it in to make it 1-0 for the hosts. And the Gunners would double the lead two minutes later, as Santi Cazorla takes a free kick from the left, and Laurent Koscielny heads it in. \nEverton get back in the contest just before half-time, when Ross Barkley's effort deflects in. 2-1 is the final score, and the victory sees Arsenal go to the top of the Premier League table for the first time since February 2014. Arsenal 2 - Everton 1 \nWest Ham heaped more misery on Chelsea winning 2-1 as Jose Mourinho was sent off, Swansea edged Aston Villa 2-1, Leicester topped Crystal Palace 1-0, Stoke lost to Watford 2-0, and Norwich fell to West Brom 1-0. \nRobben scores in return from injury sustained in September \nBayern Munich winger Arjen Robben would sparkle in his comeback, after spending nearly two months out injured. In the 35th minute, the Dutchman breaks into the area and slots home, to open the scoring for the German champions. \nArturo Vidal, Robert Lewandowski, and Thomas Muller also get on the scoresheet, as the Bavarians beat the Billy Goats 4-0. This win marks the team's 1,000th victory in the Bundesliga, and put them 10 points clear at the top of the table. \nElsewhere, Bayer Leverkusen bounced back from a 2-0 deficit to beat Stuttgart 4-3. Werder Bremen snapped a five-game losing streak with a 3-1 victory over Mainz. Frankfurt beat Hannover 2-1.
