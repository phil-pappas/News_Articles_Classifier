(AP) - Dillon Powers and Marcelo Sarvas scored late goals and the Colorado Rapids beat Sporting Kansas City 2-0 on Wednesday night for their first road victory in the series since 2002. \nPowers chipped goalkeeper Tim Melia at the end of a counter attack in the 78th minute and, after Colorado was reduced to 10 men, Sarvas powered in a shot on another breakaway in the 86th. \nColorado (9-14-10) snapped a six-game winless streak, which included four straight losses. Sporting KC (13-11-9) needs to beat Los Angeles on Sunday to secure a playoff spot. \nZac MacMath made his second start of the season for Colorado and got his first shutout. Sam Cronin picked up his second yellow card in the 84th on a high challenge of Jordi Quintilla. \nSporting KC’s best scoring chance came when Dominic Dwyer played a through ball inside the box in the 71st, but Graham Zusi’s shot hit off the crossbar. Two minutes later, MacMath made a kick save of Soni Mustivar’s deflected shot. \nCopyright © 2015 The Washington Times, LLC.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-22T05:46:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-22T07:32:22.029+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
