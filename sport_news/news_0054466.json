It was Arenado's 42nd home run of the season, moving him ahead of Washington's Bryce Harper for the National League lead.\n\"He's done it on the road, away from Coors Field, and I think that's important, too,\" Walt Weiss said of Arenado. \"He's a good hitter -- period. It doesn't matter where he's playing. He's shown that this year for sure.\"\nThe Rockies, closing out their season with a three-game series at San Francisco this weekend, beat the Giants 9-3.\nVeteran right-hander Kyle Kendrick, making his final start for Colorado, pitched one of his best games in what's been a disastrous season. Kendrick gave up one run on five hits in six innings, striking out six and walking one. Kendrick, signed to a one-year, $5.5 million contract, went 7-13 with a 6.32 ERA. Colorado's record in his 27 starts was 10-17.\n\"It was a frustrating year, let’s say that -- it wasn’t how I envisioned me, personally, and the team, too,\" Kendrick said. \"It was a mentally challenging year, my worst year numbers-wise.\"\nCorey Dickerson added a two-run homer in the Rockies' five-run third inning.\nAdvertisement Arenado, the Rockies' 24-year-old, all-star, Gold Glove third baseman, swears he's not trying to smack the ball over the wall.\n\"Nope, I just try to hit the ball hard,\" he said this week. \"If it's a homer, great. If not, doubles work too.\"\nAs if to back up his own words, Arenado rocketed a two-RBI double over the head of right fielder Jarrett Parker in the third inning. Arenado's 42nd double of the season cleared a place for him in the major-league record book. It gave him 88 extra-base hits (he also has four triples), moving him ahead of former Atlanta star Chipper Jones (87 in 1999) for the most extra-base hits in a season by a third baseman.\n\"I didn't know about it until CarGo (Carlos Gonzalez) came in and said 'congratulations'. I didn't know what he was talking about,\" Arenado said of his extra-base hits record. \"But to be there with Chipper, who is obviously one of the best of all time, is great. It's humbling.\"\nArenado also has 130 RBIs, the most in the majors this year.\n\"It's amazing,\" Weiss said of Arenado. \"He's 24 years old, too, and that's what's real exciting about this guy. He never stops. He never stops working, and he shows up every day trying to be great.\"\nHis big night paved the way for a Rockies rout of San Francisco; they led 9-1 through seven innings.\nArenado has been a Giants killer this season.\nHis 10 homers against them are the most by a San Francisco opponent since Atlanta's Dale Murphy mashed 11 in 1983. Murphy was the National League's MVP that year.\nAnd how is this for history making? Arenado has driven in 24 runs against San Francisco, becoming the first Giants opponent to hit 10 home runs and drive in at least 24 runs in a season since St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Famer Stan \"The Man\" Musial did it in 1954.\nArenado's home run barrage is no Coors Field concoction. Of his 42 homers this year, 22 have been hit on the road, and six of his 10 homers against the Giants were delivered at AT&T Park.\n\"I guess it's just the environment. I get a little bit more pumped up,\" Arenado said. \"I know they are the defending world champs, and when you come to San Fran the stands are always packed and it's something that I love. I love the atmosphere.\"\nRecords, like the superlatives for his fielding, keep coming Arenado's way. According to the Elias Sports Bureau, he is one of only three third basemen to ever hit 40 homers, 40 doubles and drive in at least 120 runs in the same season. The others are Miguel Cabrera with Detroit in 2012 and Toronto's Josh Donaldson this season.\nPatrick Saunders: psaunders@denverpost.com or @psaundersdp", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T19:28:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:08:23.802+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
