(AP) — Nicolas Batum had 18 points and 10 rebounds to help the Charlotte Hornets move to 7-0 in the preseason with a 99-94 victory over the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night. HORNETS: Jeremy Lin had 18 points, while Al Jefferson had nine points in the second half. Troy Daniels added 15. PISTONS: Andre Drummond led the Pistons with 21 points and 15 rebounds. Reggie Jackson also had a double-double with 10 points and 11 assists. FREE THROW WOES: Drummond hasn't fixed his free throw shooting problems. On a pair of foul shots he wasn't close. The first was wide right, barely catching the edge of the rim, while the second was an air ball wide left. INJURY UPDATE: Detroit SG Kentavious Caldwell-Pope injured his left foot on a dunk in the first half and did not return to the game. X-rays were negative. UP NEXT: The Hornets finish the preseason Thursday at Indiana, while the Pistons play their last exhibition game Friday when they host the Hawks.
