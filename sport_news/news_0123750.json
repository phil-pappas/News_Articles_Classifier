In the absence of captain Asamoah Gyan and deputy skipper Ayew, Agyemang Badu is expected to lead the team and will play alongside Afriyie Acquah in the holding midfield role. \nAvram Grant wil have to do some thinking. He might go for Albert Adomah or David Accam for the right midfield role in a 4-4-2 formation. Or he could go for Bernard Mensah as a playmaker behind a lone striker if he opts for a 4-2-3-1 formation and vary his usual style a bit less. \nUp front, it will be Jordan Ayew and Majeed Waris, who will be playing together in the absence of top scorer Asamoah Gyan. The duo will be looking to finding the back of the net again. \nFor more sports news visit allSports.com.gh", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-13T17:11:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T17:07:53.103+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
