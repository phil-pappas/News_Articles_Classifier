(AP) - Jeb Bush is getting a jump on the so-called SEC primary by visiting the University of Tennessee and other campuses in Southern states that vote for the GOP's presidential nominee on March 1.\nOn Saturday, the former Florida governor gave a brief pitch for his candidacy before the Volunteers hosted No. 19 Georgia.\n\"Are you ready for a victory?\" Bush asked the hundreds of orange-clad fans who gathered for his speech two hours before the opening kickoff. \"I was talking about 2016 and today.\"\nTennessee Gov. Bill Haslam, the son of former Tennessee football captain Jim Haslam and the brother of Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslam, introduced Bush. The presidential candidate spoke in front of a backdrop with a logo that looked similar to the Southeastern Conference logo, only it contained the letters \"JEB\" instead of \"SEC.\"\nAfter just a few minutes, Bush ended his remarks by saying, \"I look forward to taking as many selfies as I humanly can.\" He spent the next half-hour or so doing just that. Later, Bush and Haslam met former Tennessee coach Phillip Fulmer on the Neyland Stadium sidelines.\nBush visited Georgia's campus Sept. 19 for the Bulldogs' game with South Carolina. He is scheduled to attend LSU's game at Alabama on Nov. 7 and Mississippi's game at Mississippi State on Nov. 28.\nCopyright 2015 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.
