Wilson (Getty) \"GOP voters say Trump is most likely to win the Republican nomination,\" CNN said about Donald Trump topping another major poll.\nYou may want to hold off on registering your Lohan 2020 PAC, because in 2020 Lohan will be just one year shy of the presidential age requirement of 35.

Maybe President Yeezy will throw her on his cabinet –– right next Kim K.\nThis video includes images from Getty Images.\nTrending on Facebook\nHalf-eaten fish comes back to life, jumps on plate Kidnap victim uses Google to save himself Must read: Dad takes tardiness excuses to the next level Recall Alert: Mislabeled acetaminophen could lead to liver failure Woman's body hanging from fence mistaken for Halloween decoration More popular and trending stories", "external_links": ["http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k7bw3qyO0k", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ato7BtisXzE", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBK2rfZt32g", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3pFXYGem3c", "http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/10/politics/donald-trump-ben-carson-cnn-poll/", "http://www.nbcnews.com/video/time-lapse-video-shows-white-house-light-up-with-rainbow-472302147768", "http://www.crushable.com/2008/09/15/entertainment/lindsay-lohan-can-no-longer-hold-her-tongue-regarding-sarah-palins-homophobia/", "http://www.accesshollywood.com/videos/access-extended-lindsay-lohan-on-the-record-part-i-13370/", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAOmTMCtGkI", "http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GMuU-EwcIzs", "https://www.facebook.com/CMGNationalNews", "http://media.cmgdigital.com/shared/lt/lt_cache/thumbnail/600/img/photos/2015/10/18/18/ad/GettyImages-464329732.jpg", "https://twitter.com/lindsaylohan/status/243901870731571200"], "published": "2015-10-18T18:01:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T17:20:05.165+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
