The loose ball was recovered by Georgia outside linebacker Leonard Floyd, who ran 96 yards for a touchdown that gave the Bulldogs a 7-0 lead. \nGeorgia's lead grew to 17-3 when — following a Tennessee three-and-out — Bulldogs punt returner Reggie Davis returned a punt 70 yards for a touchdown. \nUp 24-3, Georgia had the momentum. Five of Tennessee's first seven drives had ended either without gaining a first down or after picking up just one. The Bulldogs were in complete control. \nThen Volunteers quarterback Josh Dobbs showed what he's capable of while displaying the dangerous dual-threat ability Alabama will have to deal with when the No. 8 Tide hosts Tennessee Saturday. \nDobbs threw two touchdowns during the final 1:04 of the second quarter to trim the Volunteers' deficit to 24-17. A Dobbs 1-yard touchdown run tied the score at 24 early in the third quarter. Another Dobbs scoring run — a 5-yarder with 5:48 left in the fourth quarter — proved to be the game-winning touchdown in Tennessee's comeback 38-31 victory. \n\"Definitely a big guy. Very fast. Can throw the ball. Athletic,\" Alabama defensive lineman Jonathan Allen said of Dobbs, a 6-foot-3, 210-pound junior. \"Very talented. He's definitely a special player that we have to study on and do our game-planning on and come up with a game plan for.\" \nAfter Tennessee fell behind 24-3, Dobbs completed 15 of his final 24 passes for 203 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions during the final two-plus quarters. \nHe also ran for 81 yards and two scores on 13 carries during the last two-plus quarters. \nHe finished 25 of 42 for 312 yards with the three touchdowns and an interception while also running for 118 yards and the two scores on 18 carries. \nOn an early designed run that went for a 27-yard gain, Dobbs ran through the middle of Georgia's defense, stiff-armed a Bulldogs defender to the ground after around 15 yards, ran through another tackle attempt and eventually fell forward to the 1-yard line while being tackled by a Georgia defensive back. \nOn the game-winning touchdown run, Dobbs cut back after spotting an opening, bounced back to the edge and ran through a Bulldogs defender on his way into the end zone. \nThe touchdown was set up by Dobbs completions of 34 and 24 yards. \n\"Joshua Dobbs at quarterback is a very diverse guy playing the position, running and passing,\" Tide coach Nick Saban said. \nDobbs started Tennessee's final four games as a freshman in 2013. \nHis first game action as a sophomore came against Alabama late last October. Nick Saban Press Conference Video, Oct. 19, 2015 Watch Nick Saban's Monday press conference during Tennessee week, Oct. 19, 2015. \nAfter not playing in the Volunteers' first seven games, Dobbs entered on Tennessee's third series vs. the Tide after Alabama jumped out to a 14-0 lead. \nEventually down 27-0 early in the second quarter, the Volunteers got back into the game behind Dobbs. \nDobbs threw two touchdowns — a 9-yarder during the second quarter to cut the Tide's lead 27-7 and another 9-yarder to trim Alabama's advantage to 27-17 midway through the third quarter before the Tide held on to win, 34-20. \nDobbs finished 19 of 32 for 192 yards with the two scoring passes and one interception. \nHe also ran for 75 yards on 19 carries. \nHe had a 30-yard run on a quarterback draw, breaking a tackle from inside linebacker Trey DePriest around the line of scrimmage and running free through the middle of the Tide's defense before being tripped to the ground. \n\"He came in and he gave us fits and trouble,\" Alabama linebacker Reggie Ragland said, \"so we'll do our job to keep him contained.\" \nDobbs is one of just three SEC players during the last 20 years to post 300 yards passing and 100 yards rushing in a single game. \nHe has done it twice — once against South Carolina last year and vs. Georgia this season. \nHeisman Trophy winners Tim Tebow and Johnny Manziel are the other two players. \nDobbs' numbers are modest this year. He has completed 58 percent of his passes, is throwing for an average of just 183.5 yards per game and has only eight touchdown passes in six games. \nHowever, he threw for the 312 yards against Georgia, ran for a combined 254 yards vs. Florida and Georgia, and has only thrown two interceptions. \nLed by Dobbs and Hurd, Tennessee is third in the SEC in scoring with an average of 37.2 points per game. \n\"He had a good game against us last year ... [and] he's gotten better,\" Saban said. \"You can tell he's got a great understanding of what the expectation is for him and what he needs to do on offense. I think he's, it looks like he's a good leader. I've seen the players responding positively to him. I don't think there's any question about the fact that the guy is really playing well. I think he's had a great year so far.\" Alabama Beat Reporter Show, Oct. 20, 2015 Alabama beat reporters Matt Zenitz and Michael Casagrande discuss the key points to the Alabama-Tennessee matchup this Saturday in the Tuesday beat reporter show.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-21T16:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-21T18:31:32.679+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
