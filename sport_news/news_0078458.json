But the Mustangs will still need to run wild to close out the season in order to stay in the playoff race. In their last two games, Walker Valley has scored 75 points, but head coach Glen Ryan says the credit for the points production actually goes to the defense, which got a tuneup recently during the team's bye week. \"I think a big part of it is they are just able to go out and play relaxed now because they're not feeling like they have to score every time they step on the field.\" Said quarterback Kolten Gibson-\"Oh it's so much fun when you are clicking on all cylinders with the defense playing well and the offense playing well. It's so much fun.\" Everything clicked for the Mustangs last week as they beat rival Cleveland 34-0 in a rain shortened game. Said running back Alex King-\"I think everybody was shocked how we came out there and shut them out at their home place at Benny Monroe.\" Said Ryan-\"Our guys are excited. For the last two weeks, we feel like we are playing ball like we felt like we could.\" The Mustangs now mimic college teams like Oklahoma by using the funny signs to signal plays. Said Ryan-\"That was our offensive coaches. They sat down to try and speed up our play calling a little bit. We went with the boards this year.\" Said Gibson-\"The cards definitely help us pick up tempo and move the offense faster.\" The Mustangs know they'll have to pick up their game as they close out the season against some tough competition. Said linebacker Skyler Swafford-\"Guess it's kind of a good thing we put our bad play out of the way in the beginning of the season because the last half of the schedule is going to be just a real rock-em, sock-em kind of pounding-it games.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T00:58:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-11T03:23:33.782+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
