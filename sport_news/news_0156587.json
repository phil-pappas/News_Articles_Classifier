Posted: Saturday, September 26, 2015 1:26 am What's in store?: A look at 11-5A’s non-conference performances Justin Thomas, jthomas@starlocalmedia.com Star Local Media | 0 comments \nThe District 11-5A football season kicked off Thursday and Friday, including openers for Creekview and Newman Smith. \nThe Mustangs and Trojans are each seeking a return to the postseason after placing first and third, respectively, en route to bi-district losses in 2014. \nOverall, the district showed plenty of separation in the playoff chase, with Creekview, Hillcrest, Smith comfortably qualifying, Woodrow Wilson edging Bryan Adams for the fourth position and Conrad, North Dallas and Thomas Jefferson well off the pace with one win apiece. \nBelow is a look at what the Carrollton-Farmers Branch ISD schools will be up against in district this season: \nHILLCREST \nLast year: 9-2, 6-1 and second in 11-5A \nHillcrest opened 11-5A in positive fashion Thursday getting past North Dallas, 41-14. The score was closer than indicated, however, with the Panthers outscoring the Bulldogs, 22-0, in the fourth quarter to blow open what was a one possession game entering the final period. \nIt was a much-needed start for Hillcrest, which was coming off a winless non-district slate with losses against W.T. White (44-21), Lincoln (47-16) and North Garland (50-14). \nDefense has been at the forefront of Hillcrest’s struggles, with the Panthers surrendering more than at least 6.6 yards per carry in each of their three non-district losses. The squad also generated just one turnover in those defeats. \nOffensively, the team has strived to find a balance between run and pass. \nWOODROW WILSON \nLast year: 6-5, 4-3 and fourth in 11-5A \nWhile Hillcrest had issues during its non-district slate, Wilson — the district’s fourth playoff qualifier — opened with a pair of wins before suffering a setback in its final tune-up. \nThe Wildcats held off Kimball in their opener, 35-25, and had little difficulty getting past Fort Worth Eastern Hills, 69-0, before falling to Fort Worth Paschal, 52-27. \nA kick return and interception returned for scores helped offset Wilson being outgained by Kimball, but the team’s offense bounced back in a big way against Eastern Hills with the defense producing two more touchdowns. \nPaschal, however, limited its turnovers and rolled to victory behind a rushing attack that averaged more than 6.5 yards per carry en route to a 260-yard night. \nBRYAN ADAMS \nLast year: 4-6, 3-4 and fifth in 11-5A \nThe Cougars had a back-and-forth non-district schedule with the team both winning and losing by blowout (topping Roosevelt, 45-12, and losing to Celina, 59-28) before coming up just shy against Seagoville, 32-24. \nAdams was dominant defensively in its win, limiting Roosevelt to 108 total yards and forcing a pair of turnovers. \nCelina flipped the script on the Cougars, however, racking up 500 yards of offense, including 243 yards rushing on just 29 attempts. \nThe team again had a tough time slowing the run against Seagoville, who gashed the Cougar defense for 316 yards on 54 rushes. \nOffensively, Adams has used a run-pass split, with XaiyViyon McCuin leading through the air and Jimmy Odie keying the ground attack. \nCONRAD \nLast year: 2-8, 1-6 in tied for sixth in 11-5A \nThe Chargers entered district with a 1-2 mark. Conrad opened with a 40-12 loss at the hands of Fort Worth Carter-Riverside, bounced back with a second-half comeback to defeat Molina, 34-20, before being blown out by R.L. Turner, 57-6. \nThe squad has struggled mightily on the offensive end in its losses, totaling just 45 total yards against Turner and mustering just 119 yards when facing Carter-Riverside. \nThe team did display an ability to move on the ground against Molina, however, where running back Jonus Williams busted loose for 339 yards and five touchdowns on just 23 carries (14.7 yards per attempt). \nNORTH DALLAS \nLast year: 2-8, 1-6 and tied for sixth in 11-5A \nThe Bulldogs were the lone team to enter district with an unblemished mark, but that was short-lived following Thursday’s 41-14 loss against Hillcrest. \nIn non-conference play, North Dallas blew out Sunset, 64-0, had a relatively stress-free night in a 27-6 win over Spruce and then held off Roosevelt, 13-12. \nDefenses should be primed to slow running back Geovoni Manning if they want to find success in slowing North Dallas. \nThrough four games, the Bulldogs are yet to throw a passing touchdown. Manning, however, has piled up 875 yards (9 per carry) and 12 touchdowns in North Dallas’ four contests. \nTHOMAS JEFFERSON \nLast year: 2-8, 1-6 and tied for sixth in 11-5A \nThe Patriots also entered district with a positive mark, preparing for 11-5A action with wins over Fort Worth North Side (26-6) and Fort Worth Diamond-Hill Jarvis (53-0) but coming up short on the road against Spruce (38-20). \nOffensively, Jefferson leans on dual-threat quarterback Kendrick Bright, who narrowly leads the team in rushing (42 carries, 382 yards, six touchdowns) in front of Kevon Davis (38-334-5) while also throwing for 214 yards and a score. \nThe team has had issues slowing the run on the other side, however, including surrendering 348 yards and four touchdowns on 32 carries in the loss to Spruce.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-09-26T09:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T09:09:17.772+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
