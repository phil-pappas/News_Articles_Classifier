This one has turned ugly early, and another bad start sent quarterback Matthew Stafford to the bench last week.\nAfter back-to-back wins, the Chicago Bears are no longer criticized as the worst team in the NFL. But the Bears (2-3) are 3- to 3½-point road underdogs to the winless Lions today.\n\"The Lions are 0-5 and going to 0-6,\" Las Vegas handicapper Mike Scalleat said. \"It's a team that self-destructs every week. The morale can't be too high with this team, and I don't look for them to respond. I don't see anything positive coming from Detroit. I think this is one of those seasons where the Lions could go 2-14.\n\"Stafford was put on the bench, so where is his confidence?\"\nStafford's passer rating (74.8) is low, mostly because of eight interceptions. He was picked off three times in a 42-17 loss to Arizona a week ago. On the same day, Jay Cutler passed for two touchdowns, rallying the Bears to an improbable 18-17 win at Kansas City.\n\"Cutler is prone to mistakes, but he seems to have found his rhythm,\" said Scalleat, who is 14-10-1 in the Westgate SuperContest, in which he finished fourth in 2007. \"The Bears are a confident team after winning two in a row.\"\nThere is somewhat of a bright side for the Lions, who are 5-1 against the spread in the past six meetings with the Bears.\nScalleat is on the Browns, Bills, Jets, Seahawks and Patriots as his five SuperContest plays this week. He did not use the Bears with the line at 3, but he recommends a bet at plus-3½.\nScalleat scouts the rest of today's Week 6 schedule:\n* Denver (-4) at Cleveland : The Browns' Josh McCown was the NFL's hottest quarterback the past two weeks, passing for 457 yards against Baltimore and 356 against San Diego, going a combined 68 of 92 with four touchdowns and no interceptions. The Broncos are playing the second of back-to-back road games, and this is an early kickoff. The Denver defense will be without injured end DeMarcus Ware, so that will hurt. Peyton Manning is not his usual self without the same ability to throw downfield. I took 4½ with Cleveland. It should be a close game. I think this is the week some undefeated teams get beat, and I'm going to go against three of them.\n* Cincinnati (-3) at Buffalo: EJ Manuel is starting over injured Tyrod Taylor at quarterback for the Bills, but I don't see a big difference. Running back LeSean McCoy is expected to come back from a sore hamstring. The Bengals are 5-0 straight up and 4-0-1 ATS, but I'm not a fan of quarterback Andy Dalton on the road. I took 3½ with the Bills. The line has dropped, so somebody is betting them. I like this spot.\n* Kansas City at Minnesota (-3½): The Chiefs don't have much offense without injured running back Jamaal Charles. Alex Smith rarely throws down the field. The Vikings will run with Adrian Peterson. I don't like either side, but it's going to be a low-scoring game. I'll go under the total (43½).\n* Houston at Jacksonville (-1½): The Jaguars scored 31 points last week at Tampa Bay, and Blake Bortles has played better with 10 touchdown passes and four interceptions. The Texans are going back to Brian Hoyer at quarterback, which I think is a mistake. Ryan Mallett is a stronger passer. Houston has not found any rhythm on offense. You can't keep switching quarterbacks in the NFL and be successful. Texans defensive end J.J. Watt has an illness and is questionable. I'm going to take a shot with Jacksonville.\n* Washington at New York Jets (-6½): Everybody I've heard talk about this game is on the Redskins. The Jets are off a bye, and they have the better defense. New York ranks No. 2 in total defense, allowing 280.3 yards per game, and it has the No. 1 scoring defense (13.8 points per game). Washington quarterback Kirk Cousins is usually good for one or two big mistakes. I don't see the Redskins having much success running the ball. I like the Jets, who have won and covered three of four games.\n* Arizona (-3½) at Pittsburgh: The Steelers are working on a short week after winning at San Diego on Monday night. Michael Vick showed he can make a few big plays, and Le'Veon Bell is rushing for 100.7 yards per game. The Cardinals have scored 42 points or more three times. The play is Arizona, but I hate to lay this number on the road. I'll go over the total (44½).\n* Miami at Tennessee (-1): The Dolphins are off a bye after the loss in London. They have played lousy football, and I expect more of the same even with the coaching change. The Titans blew leads in home losses to Buffalo and Indianapolis, and I think they are due to win. Marcus Mariota has played well for a rookie quarterback, passing for eight touchdowns with three interceptions. I'm going with Tennessee.\n* Carolina at Seattle (-7): Running back Marshawn Lynch is expected to play for the Seahawks, so that will help. The Panthers are 4-0 and off the bye, but they are going down. Carolina has a one-man offense with Cam Newton. You would never think Seattle's defense would blow a 17-point lead in the fourth quarter, but after that happened in Cincinnati, the Seahawks will be out to punish somebody. Russell Wilson is 4-0 against Carolina. The line is high for a reason. The Seahawks should win by 10 or more.\n* San Diego at Green Bay (-10½): Aaron Rodgers is not going to keep turning over the ball this week. The Packers quarterback will pick apart a weak San Diego pass defense. The Green Bay defense will get to Philip Rivers, who has an unreliable offensive line. The Packers are 9-1-1 ATS in their past 11 regular-season games at Lambeau Field. I hate to lay double digits, but it's Green Bay or nothing.\n* Baltimore (-2) at San Francisco: It was a heartbreaking loss for the 49ers in New York last week, but quarterback Colin Kaepernick might have found his rhythm. Carlos Hyde can run the ball. The San Francisco defense is not that bad. Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith is doubtful, and the offense needs him. The Baltimore defense allowed 505 yards to the Browns last week. The Ravens lost to Oakland on their first trip to the West Coast. I lean to the 49ers.\n* New England (-9) at Indianapolis: The Patriots push the pedal down the whole game, and you have to think Tom Brady and Bill Belichick want to win big. Colts quarterback Andrew Luck probably will play, but he has not played well, so it might not matter. Luck is 0-4 against New England with an average margin of defeat of 29 points. I bet the Patriots at minus-7½. Brady has all kinds of weapons, and they can score easily on the Colts.\n— Compiled by Matt Youmans/Review-Journal\nMicah Roberts' Sprint Cup...
