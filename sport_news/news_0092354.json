(Al Bello | Getty Images) Comments \nEAST RUTHERFORD ‐ Giants defensive end Damontre Moore was fined $20,000 for his late hit on quarterback Sam Bradford in the first quarter of Monday night's 27-7 loss to the Eagles. \nThis not Moore's first finable offense. He was also fined last year for a hit on Titans quarterback Zach Mettenberger. That cost Moore $10K. He was also fined for a late hit in 2013 against the Minnesota Vikings. \nThe minimum fine for a second offense late hit in 2015 is $17,363. The league elected to levy a heavier penalty on Moore for his costly body-slam several seconds after Bradford released the football. Moore was flagged for roughing the passer. \nThe Giants had Philadelphia in a third-and-10 situation when Moore committed the penalty. It appeared they were about to force a punt after a 3-yard gain, but given the second chance, the Eagles drove down the field for a touchdown that evened the score at 7-7. Damontre Moore should b suspended for this https://t.co/Q14D94K3Um @NFL DO YOUR JOB — Mike Hulihan (@Mikehull24) October 20, 2015 \nMoore admitted after the contest it was a low-IQ play. \n\"Honestly, I think it was just part of me just having poor football IQ, and not [being] aware of the rules of dumping [ Eagles quarterback Sam Bradford ],\" Moore said. \"Because I dumped him, honestly, I was just trying to make a play and be a high-energy guy. I'm going out there, and I'm trying to run from sideline to sideline and just hit somebody as hard as I can. There's no excuse.\" \nIt was Moore's third penalty this season, the most among Giants defensive linemen. It's this unpredictability that has coach Tom Coughlin uncertain Moore can make the right decisions on the field. \nWATCH : Daniel Fells has an emotional reunion with his 2 young children \nThe Giants have only used Moore sporadically this season. He was on the field for 19 defensive snaps Monday night against the Eagles. \n\"I can't really honestly say that,\" Coughlin said. \"He's obviously of a high energy. He does give outstanding effort, there's no question about it. But in regard to that, there's absolutely no excuse for anyone for the unnecessary roughness penalty that he committed last night. You use the word 'trust.' I don't know. That's a good word.\" \nMoore did do some positive things on Monday night. He had two sacks (one was negated by the Giants having too many men on the field), a special teams tackle and exhibited good hustle on several other plays.
