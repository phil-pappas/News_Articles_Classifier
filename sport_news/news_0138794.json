Pic/AFP \nA third victory in four years at the Circuit of the Americas, with four-time champion German Vettel outside the top two finishers, would be enough for him to add a third title to those of 2008 and 2014.\nThat would place him alongside Australian Jack Brabham, Briton Jackie Stewart, Austrian Niki Lauda and Brazilians Nelson Piquet and Senna with three titles apiece.\nFrenchman Alain Prost and German Vettel each have four title wins while Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio won five and German Michael Schumacher seven.\nThe 30-year-old Briton has won nine races this year for a total of 302 points, a lead of 66 ahead of Vettel, who has won three times to accumulate 236 points in his first season with Ferrari.\nHamilton's Mercedes teammate, German Nico Rosberg, who also has won three races, is third with 229 points, his challenge hit by retirements this year, notably in the Russian Grand Prix earlier this month when he led the race after starting from pole position.\nNothing for granted \nHamilton, however, is taking nothing for granted as he seeks to secure the title on his favoured American soil where this week, according to his Instagram account, he has been hanging out with Hollywood film star Will Smith, who he described as \"one of the most inspiring and wisest\" people he had met.\n\"I'm going to take my time and work as hard as ever,\" said Hamilton. \"My goal is to win a third title and until I achieve that there is no other goal. I feel incredibly fortunate to have this car.\n\"I love going to Austin â€” the track has been amazing for me since the first race. I am looking forward to it. It is a track where you can race and get close to people.\" Hamilton joined the team in their celebrations after retaining the constructors' championship at Sochi.\nF1 drivers' standings \n1 Lewis Hamilton (GBR) 302pts\n2 Sebastian Vettel (GER) 236\n3 Nico Rosberg (GER) 229\n4 Kimi Raikkonen (FIN) 123\n5 Valtteri Bottas (FIN) 111", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T02:49:51.408+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
