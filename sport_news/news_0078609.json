Perkinson, a sophomore from Roseburg, had perhaps the best day of her young career at Speedway Meadow in Golden Gate Park, placing fourth of 232 total entries in the women's 6,000-meter race in 21 minutes 47.6 seconds — just eight seconds off the leader. The Raiders took fourth of 20 teams in the men's 8K, led by 15th-place Ray Schireman (25:16.7), 18th-place Connor Cushman (25:21.0) and 22nd-place Jared Hixon (25:28.6). SOU's top eight finishers were separated by just 80 seconds. The three teams that placed ahead of the SOU men are all ranked in NCAA Division II: Chico State (No. 2), Cal Baptist (No. 6 West Region) and San Francisco State (No. 24). The Raider women took eighth of 22 in the team standings. Following Perkinson, Rebecca Lupescu placed 65th (23:26.8) and Aspen Abbott was 79th (24:10.4). Volleyball SOU 3, NORTHWEST 1: At Ashland, Southern Oregon rallied in the fourth set for a 25-15, 23-25, 25-15, 26-24 victory over Northwest University to remain in second place in the Cascade Conference. The Eagles were on the brink of taking 12th-ranked Southern Oregon to a tiebreaker set, but the Raiders scored five of the final six points. Four Raiders put up double-figure kill totals: Tyana Andrews (17), Corynn Kopra (15), Niki Small (12) and Laura Morse (12). Small was particularly impressive, doing her damage on just 18 attacks with one error in leading SOU to a team attacking average of .308. She also assisted four blocks, including two to help the Raiders erase Northwest's 23-21 fourth-set advantage and one with Lauren McGowne to seal the match. McGowne distributed a match-high 55 assists to go with eight digs and three assisted blocks. The Raiders went to 16-2 overall and 9-2 in the CCC. Northwest is 12-6 and 8-4. Women's Soccer SOU 5, EVERGREEN 0: At Olympia, Wash., Southern Oregon got four goals from its reserves, the most off the bench in program history, for the victory. Yvonne Valencia scored once in each half for the first goals of her career and added an assist, Maddy Spangler tallied a goal in the second half to go with her first two assists of the season, and Lauren Aldana and Sarah Garoutte both found the back of the net in the first. The Raiders (5-7-2 overall, 4-3 Cascade Conference) inched closer to clinching a CCC tournament berth with their fourth win in five games and their second five-goal effort in three outings. Their five goals were the most SOU has scored in a CCC shutout since the 2003 season. The Geoducks went to 1-7 overall and 1-3 in the circuit. Aldana, the only starter to score, put the Raiders up in the 28th minute with an angled shot that stayed just inside the far post. Spangler assisted Valencia three minutes later with a cross that led to a short shot, and Valencia hit Garoutte in the 36th minute for a 15-yard goal that made it 3-0 at halftime. SOU's second-half goals were recorded in the 77th and 80th minutes, as Spangler scored first and a few minutes later connected with Valencia for a tap-in. Men's Soccer EVERGREEN 2, SOU 0: At Olympia, Wash., Evergreen tipped a scoreless game in its favor with two goals in the final 15 minutes to defeat Southern Oregon. Juan Lopez netted a 20-yard shot in the 76th minute, and Tanner Williams rebounded Lopez's deflected shot for a tap-in goal in the 84th. The Geoducks, who recorded just three shots on goal in the opening 75 minutes, improved to 8-1 overall and 5-1 in the Cascade Conference with their fifth shutout of the season. SOU (9-5, 4-5) played another top team in the conference admirably but didn't have many meaningful possessions. Reserves Justin Griego and Paul Matyas produced the only shots on goal, both in the second half.
