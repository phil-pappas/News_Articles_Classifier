Here are some highlights.\nQuestion: Given how beat up TCU's defense is and how close Tech played them, what are the chances Texas upsets the Frogs?\nKevin Sherrington: I wouldn't say Texas' chances are particularly good. The Longhorns keep putting themselves into position to win games, but they haven't figured out a way to get over the hump. That's problematic with a team in a skid. Sometimes looks like they've lost all their confidence. TCU is really struggling on defense, but they still can hang some points on you. Boykin to Doctson is just about the best combination in college football.\nQuestion: Did you see the A&M-Arkansas game? The way the Hogs ran the ball against the Aggies, do you think A&M's defense can hold up?\nKevin Sherrington: Saw parts of that game while in Houston covering Rangers-Astros. Frankly was distracted by the crazy TCU-Tech game, too. Restaurant we were in watching those games erupted with that finish. Listen, the Razorbacks are going to run the ball well. They didn't do it particularly well against Toledo or Tech, but that's what they do when at their best. I thought the Aggies would win that game fairly easily, judging on how Arkansas played in the previous two games. The Aggies have some shoring up to do, but they can put up points and they've got a great pass rush. And the SEC West is wide open.\nQuestion: Who do you currently see as the Big 12 favorite - Baylor or TCU?\nKevin Sherrington: On our weekly poll of Texas' top teams, I moved Baylor ahead of TCU. The Frogs have played a tougher schedule to this point, but Gary Patterson's defense doesn't remotely resemble his usual stuff. That's understandable, given what he lost from last season and what he's lost this season to injuries and the like. If they played right now, I think Baylor would pile up an awful lot of points. Fortunately for the Frogs, they keep finding ways to win and leave that end-of-season matchup relevant.\nQuestion: I was at the Tech Game Saturday - They played really well and had it not been for that last second missed and then caught ball - they would have beaten the #3 team. Your thoughts about the rest of the season?\nKevin Sherrington: TCU is obviously struggling on defense, but you're right, Tech is playing much better. They're still giving up lots of points in David Gibbs' defense, but they don't look clueless, either. And Mahomes is a very nice QB. In our weekly best-of-Texas poll, I've got Tech behind Baylor, TCU and Texas A&M and ahead of Texas. I could see the Raiders challenging Oklahoma for third place. Bowl game for sure.\nCLICK HERE TO VIEW THE FULL CHAT\nOn Twitter:\n @KSherringtonDMN", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/KSherringtonDMN"], "published": "2015-10-02T02:05:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T05:44:39.684+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
