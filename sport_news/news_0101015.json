Gainesville fell to 0-6 with a 42-0 defeat. Posted: Saturday, October 10, 2015 12:55 am Leopards can’t corral Steers in district opener By EVAN GRICE Sports Editor gainesvilleregister.com \nFor the Gainesville Leopards, the start of district play provided a time to start fresh at 0-0 as GHS tries to continue its tradition of playoff appearances. \nUnfortunately, the journey hit a speed bump Friday night at Newton Field in Graham, as the Steers struck early and often to claim a 42-0 victory over the Leopards. \nThe Steers got on the board following a three and out by the Leopards when quarterback Landry Turner rolled down the sideline for a 14-yard score. \nAfter another failed offensive drive by Gainesville, Turner caused more problems for the Leopards defense, as he set up another touchdown with a 45-yard strike downfield, before Bohner Cottongame punched it in from two-yards out to make it 14-0 with just over six minutes to go in the first quarter. \nGraham made it 21-0 in the second quarter when Justin Escalon ran for a 32-yard touchdown, before Turner found Kody Perry from 28-yards out to make it 28-0 in favor of the Steers. \nEscalon got another touchdown before the half ended, when he scored from five yards out to make it 35-0. \nTurner also got another touchdown before halftime as he found Adam Groves for a 26-yard touchdown pass. \nThere was no scoring in the second half as both teams ran the ball, without throwing a single pass. \nGainesville finished with 120 yards of total offense with Micheal Bradley leading the rushing with 50 yards followed by Calion Baker with 32 yards on the ground. \nHunter Turbeville finished 4-of-14 passing for 41 yards in the game. \nBradley and Dillon Ross also totaled interceptions for the Leopards in the game. \nGainesville (0-6, 0-1) will look to snap a six game losing streak to open then season when they host the Wichita Falls Hirschi Huskies next Friday night at 7:30 p.m. from Leopard Stadium.
