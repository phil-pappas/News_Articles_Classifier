Obviously, he was either holding on to something or something was going on. But I didn’t think what I did was going to eject me out of the game.’’\nTulowitzki seemed surprised because he believes Hirschbeck to be a solid umpire.\nYour browser does not support iframes. “Obviously, you don’t want to get ejected right there,’’ said Tulowitzki who hit a three-run homer in the third inning. “It will be interesting to see what he has to say. He has been an umpire for a long time. He is a good one at that so I am surprised.’’\nRyan Goins spent Saturday taking the blame for the Blue Jays’ loss in Game 2 but said that he had erased that guilt long before helping his team win Game 3 with a two-run single and solo homer.\n“Today [it] was probably the last thing in my mind,’’ the Blue Jays’ second baseman said. “Didn’t think about it.’’\nJohn Gibbons said he didn’t feel a deep conversation with R.A. Dickey was necessary after the manager hooked his starting pitcher with a 7-1 lead in Game 4 of the ALDS against the Rangers one out away from qualifying for a victory.\n“I don’t know if it was necessary,’’ said Gibbons, who called for ace David Price to follow Dickey. “I don’t think I ruined his career to be honest with you.’’\nTuesday night will be Dickey’s first outing since being denied that chance at a postseason victory.\n“I don’t think he was overly sensitive about it. Maybe I am wrong,’’ Gibbons said. “We talked briefly. There has been so much going on I haven’t had a chance to sit down. He knows I am on his side. He may not have understood the move, a lot of people may not have. But the whole idea was Price is coming in, regardless, because he is up. So why take a chance of letting something develop. That’s all it came down to.\n“I don’t sense any problem. It’s about the team winning, it’s not about the individual, really. That’s the key to a championship.’’\nRoyals Game 4 starter Chris Young visited the Hockey Hall of Fame Monday where four members of his wife Elizabeth Patrick’s family are enshrined. Rangers patriarch Lester Patrick is Elizabeth’s great-grandfather while former Rangers and Penguins GM Craig Patrick is her uncle.\n“I took my wife and youngest son. It was a wonderful experience,’’ Young said. “It’s an amazing place, the tradition, the family history for her. She was able to take a picture next to the statue of her great-grandfather. She saw her grandfather’s name [Lynn Patrick] etched on the Stanley Cup.\nMuch has been made of the trade deadline deals made by the Blue Jays for Price, Tulowitzki and Ben Revere but according to Gibbons, somebody who was with the club from the first day of spring training has been just as meaningful.\n“Without him we may not be in this spot,’’ Gibbons said of third baseman Josh Donaldson, an AL MVP candidate. “That’s probably an accurate statement I would think.’’\nDonaldson hit a two-run homer and drove in another run with a single Monday night.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-20T04:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T11:12:41.808+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
