We're still trying to find places that people fit and things that they can do. We're still going to have to make a decision on someone. \n“All of these guys have played well, they're just reinforcing what they've done. We're looking for one more of those games.” \nWith 26 players left in camp, the Jets need to trim three bodies, unless someone goes on injured reserve – which remains a possibility when you consider that both Paul Postma (ankle) and Adam Pardy (shoulder) are coming off injuries that required further rehab during the off-season. \nGiven the way he's played during the pre-season, it would be a surprise to see defenceman Jay Harrison moved or be placed on waivers. \nUp front, barring an unexpected move, Nikolaj Ehlers and Andrew Copp look like locks at forward. \nEhlers might even find himself getting a longer look on a line with Mark Scheifele, while Copp is going to be the fourth-line centre. \nThat leaves Nic Petan, JC Lipon and Thomas Raffl vying for one spot. \nGiven how well he's played, Petan looks like the front-runner to win the job. \nWith Andrew Ladd and Adam Lowry expected to sit out the pre-season finale with what Maurice called minor ailments (“not even injuries, they were stiff when they came in”), Petan looks to be getting a shot at playing on a line with Bryan Little and Blake Wheeler. \nPetan has looked comfortable on both the fourth line and in more offensive situations, as his hockey IQ and talent has been on full display. \nWhen a player has as strong a camp as Petan has, it must be difficult to wonder what else he has to do to win a spot. \nHe's done everything that's been asked of him so far, but there's a chance even that might not be enough. \nHowever, Petan has done an excellent job of staying in the moment and not worrying about how things are going to shake out, with NHL rosters due on Tuesday at 4 p.m. CT. \n“Yeah, you get anxious for sure,” said Petan. “But in those moments, family and friends and guys around the room, they help. You've just got to stay calm.” \nAs well as he's played, Lipon is the most likely player to be sent down, but he's taken a big step forward and shown that he's not far away from being a guy Maurice won't be afraid to call on if he needs a fourth-line energy guy. \nRaffl has been one of the most interesting stories to follow during training camp and Saturday's game might be most important of all for him. \nFirst and foremost, Raffl would love to earn a contract from the Jets. \nBut if he can't do that, might there be another NHL team interested in his services or would he consider starting in the AHL, given how close he's come to making the team? \nIf neither one of those scenarios transpires, Raffl will head back to Austria. \nNo matter how the final decision plays out, it's important for the players on the bubble that this isn't the end of the road, it's actually the starting line. \nAnd things can change quickly. \nLook no further than the fall of 2011 for a cautionary tale, as Patrice Cormier looked like he had done enough to survive the final cut down to 23 players, only to see the Jets claim winger Brett McLean off waivers. \nThe corresponding move saw Cormier return to the minors and while he's received several recalls since that time, he's still not an NHL regular. \nThe real work is just beginning. \nken.wiebe@sunmedia.ca", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T02:13:51.487+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
