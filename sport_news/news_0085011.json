There was a groundbreaking ceremony for the new facility on Tuesday at the recreation center with Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter; Councilman Kenyatta Johnson; Phillies Chairman David Montgomery; Darrell Miller, Major League Baseball vice president of youth and facility development; and Michael DiBerardinis, deputy mayor for environment and community resources for City of Philadelphia Parks and Recreation. \nThe new indoor baseball/softball training center, a 7,500-square-foot facility, is being added to the existing recreation center. Among the many amenities to be included are four retractable batting cages, similar to the batting cages at the Carpenter Complex in Clearwater, Florida, which is the spring training site for the Phillies. In addition, parts of the recreation center will be renovated to create adequate space for fitness training, as well as educational and baseball vocational programs. \nThe new indoor facility is part of the Phillies MLB Urban Youth Academy, which is the only multisite MLB Academy in existence. In addition to the new indoor training center, the Phillies MLB Urban Youth Academy consists of an outdoor location at Franklin Delano Roosevelt Park in South Philly. The outdoor location, which opened this past June, features two boys’ and two girls’ softball fields. This multisite MLB Academy provides the more than 8,000 players who play in the Phillies Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities (RBI) program in Philadelphia access to free baseball and softball instruction year-round. \nThe Philadelphia Phillies MLB Urban Youth Academy will be managed in collaboration by Major League Baseball, the Phillies and Philadelphia Parks and Recreation. Former major league and professional players, scouts, college and high school coaches, along with others from the baseball and softball communities, will give instruction. The academy’s facility and program resources will be available to young people in the Philadelphia area through a membership program. \n“It’s all about opportunity,” said Steve Bandura, who coaches the Anderson Monarchs baseball team at the Marian Anderson Recreation Center. “I’m really looking forward to it, especially for the educational outlet. It’s a great program. Our goal is to get kids into college. If they can go beyond that and play at a higher level, that’s just icing on the cake.” \nJustin Billups, who plays baseball at the High School of the Future and on the Phillies RBI team, is looking forward to the completion of the new indoor facility. \n“I think it’s a great opportunity,” Billups said. “There’s no other facilities in the city that I know of like this. I heard they have classrooms where you can do work in and everything. I get to come here and work on my craft. I want to play at the next level.” \nThe Philadelphia Phillies MLB Urban Youth Academy aims to improve the quality of baseball and softball throughout the city while directly addressing other Philadelphia Parks and Recreation youth development objectives. It will develop a great youth program that utilizes baseball and softball to enhance the athletic and social potential for all participants. There will be programs for skill development, physical fitness, coach training and academic support. \nThe project is supported by MLB, the Phillies, the Baseball Tomorrow Fund (BTF), the City of Philadelphia, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and Phillies first baseman Ryan Howard. \ndhunt@phillytrib.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T07:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-18T09:20:55.543+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
