Police say he was found on top of the parking garage on the LSU campus, wearing camouflage, with long wires around him.\nOfficers said they received information from West Baton Rouge Parish 911 regarding a possible threat on the campus that was heard over a citizenâ€™s band (CB) radio.\nWitnesses say Bee was on the CB radio talking about guns and shooting on LSU's campus, according to the affidavit of probable cause. It was reported Bee had two high powered rifles with special ammunition.\nAccording to the police report, the witness told police, \"The way he was talking, he is going to set off ammunition at the Louis Drefyus,\" which is a facility which stores high volumes of ammonium nitrate at the Port of Baton Rouge.\nLSU students were alerted through the campus texting system to try to clear the area while police worked to determine it was safe.\n\"Police are securing the Union Square Parking Garage and Barnes & Noble bookstore,\" the message sent by LSU stated. \"Please stay clear of these facilities.\"\nThe alert system also sent out an email repeating the same information from the text.\nAuthorities locked down the area and found Bee on top of the parking garage. Bee was unarmed.\nBee told police he was communicating with truck drivers over the CB, and part of the conversation was discussing the recent school shooting in Oregon. He said he also discussed owning weapons and what he would do in the event of a shooter being on LSU's campus and how he would shoot them.\nHe denied making threatening statements.\nDocuments show Bee was contacted by LSU Police three weeks ago because he was accused of printing targets for firearm practice in the LSU Student Union.\nLSU officials said there was a glitch with Tuesday's night email which had \"armed robbery\" in the subject line.\nThe investigation is ongoing.\nCopyright 2015 WAFB .
