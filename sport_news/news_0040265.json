(Antonio Perez / Chicago Tribune) Will he stay or will he go? Only Bo knows. \nBo Ryan hoped to discuss emerging Wisconsin talents such as Ethan Happ and Jordan Hill. \n\"So if you have some questions about the players,\" Ryan said Thursday, \"I'd love to answer those.\" \nFat chance. \nRyan was flooded with queries at Big Ten media day about a topic Nebraska coach Tim Miles called \"the biggest cliffhanger since 'Who shot J.R.?' \" \nWill Ryan retire after this season? He certainly implied that in June when he released a statement saying, in part, \"I've decided to coach one more season.\" \nBut then came word that Ryan, 67, was reconsidering, and now few believe he's ready to bury his clipboard. \n\"I don't think he's done,\" said Howard Moore, the former Wisconsin assistant and UIC head coach who will serve as a Big Ten Network analyst this season. \"You can't play golf in Madison in January. And he'd drive (wife) Kelly crazy. She'd want him out of the house. Tell you what, he's going to stick around. We need him in this profession to keep being the guardian of the game.\" \nTo comprehend Ryan's greatness, consider that Wisconsin did not win a Big Ten title from 1948 to 2001. The Badgers have won four since 2002. They've also made the NCAA tournament in each of Ryan's 14 seasons. \n\"It's an honor,\" Northwestern coach Chris Collins said, \"to compete against his teams.\" \nThe Badgers boasted the nation's most efficient offense last season and reached the championship game, falling 68-63 to Duke. Ryan's 172-68 Big Ten record gives him the highest winning percentage (.717) in conference history. \nAsked if he could imagine the Big Ten without Ryan, Michigan coach John Beilein cracked: \"I'd like to. I wish he had retired five years ago.\" \nBeilein added: \"I have tremendous admiration for the guy. He has proved he can win with great players or three-star recruits. He wins the right way. His guys graduate. He packs the stands. But the life we lead, sometimes enough is enough. Maybe he wants to play a lot more golf or relax a little bit.\" \nThe curmudgeonly Ryan is an 80s shooter (warning: don't wager using his 17 handicap) who has played Pine Valley, Pebble Beach and Pinehurst. \nAsked if he wants to lower his handicap, Ryan replied: \"The only way I can do that is to play a lot more. June is camps, July is recruiting. I play a little bit in August.\" \nYes, but if you retire … \n\"I haven't made up my mind about anything other than coaching these guys,\" he said. \"We have practice at 4 (Thursday) afternoon, and all I've been thinking about since I got up is the practice plan — what drills we're going to do. All my mind is doing right now are the things I've been doing for 44 years. \n\"I'm in the gym now — and I'm right where I belong.\" \nWhen Ryan does step aside, he would like top assistant Greg Gard to succeed him. But athletic director Barry Alvarez, who wants Ryan to stay, said he would follow state law regarding job postings and conduct a national search. \nUntil that day comes, however many months or years away, Ryan wants to continue doing what he loves — teaching the game to young players. This season's Badgers are loaded with them. \n\"I was at practice last weekend,\" Moore said, \"and it looked like he was having fun.\" \nHe also had some fun Thursday on the topic of his retirement: \"It's like being at a picnic and saying, 'I'll have one more hamburger.' How many people have three more?\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-16T05:34:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-16T19:55:01.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
