Ken Morgan, Walla Walla Union-Bulletin Print this article Advertisement Senior night Thursday at the Walla Walla High School gym got off to a rousing start Thursday, as the Blue Devils stormed from behind to take a 26-24 first-set win over Kamiakin in Mid-Columbia Conference volleyball action.

But the Braves regrouped behind the net play of 6-foot, 2-inch Allison Stapleton, 5-11 Leanna Shymanski, and 5-10 Madison Judy to pull out victories in the next three sets and take a 3-1 MCC match win. “Our seniors (Karli Plucker, Whitney Enriquez, Emily Hedine and Therese McCarty) had a lot of leadership tonight,” Blue Devil coach Kim McDaniels said. “Every single one of them wanted it. They were fired up in set one and that’s what got us motivated to play at that level.” The Blue Devils never led in set one until crunch time. A Tara Krivoshein two-hand set kill got the Blue Devils even at 6-6. Behind two kills from Stapleton, a block from Judy, and a service ace from Kennedy Sarver, the Braves built a 20-14 lead. A McCarty kill earned a Blue Devil sideout at 20-15. Another McCarty kill and a Kamryn Coleman kill got Wa-Hi within 23-20. Coleman then ran off three straight from the service line, with her ace drawing Wa-Hi even at 23-23. Carlee Rowell’s kill gave the Braves a 24-23 lead, but Wa-Hi’s Noelani Helm’s tip evened it at 24-24. A Hedine kill, followed by a Helm service ace produced the Blue Devil 26-24 win. “That was a lot of fun,” Hedine said. “We came up from six points. It was so much fun to be cheering in the circle and everybody screaming. It was awesome.” “I’ve never seen the girls fight that hard,” McDaniels said. “They were playing at a level I’ve never seen. That was amazing. It’s nice to take a set off the No. 1 3A team in the conference.” An Emma Wenzel kill and block, plus an ace from Helm, pulled Wa-Hi within 13-9 in set two, but Shymanski and Stapleton controlled the net for the Braves and Kamiakin evened the match at 1-1 with a 25-16 win. The serving of Selina Atkinson, with an assist from a Helm kill, pulled Wa-Hi from a 21-18 deficit into a 22-21 lead in game three. The Braves rallied back to outscore Wa-Hi 4-1, with a Judy kill producing set point and the Braves led the match 2-1 with a 25-23 win.

A Judy kill broke a 6-6 tie in set four and the Braves never looked back as they posted a match-clinching 25-13 win. Freshman Helm led the Blue Devil hitters with nine kills. Hedine and Coleman each finished with six. “Noelani (Helm) had the game of her life,” McDaniels said. “She did a great job. Our hitters stepped up and found a way to put it (points) away.” Krivoshein, before suffering a back injury that shortened her night, directed the offense with 20 assists. At the net, Wenzel posted a team-leading six blocks. At the service line, Helm blasted three aces and Krivoshein added two. On defense, the Blue Devils were under fire but found a way to hold off some big hits from the Brave front line. Hedine led the way with 18 digs. Plucker and Helm came up with 12 digs each. Wa-Hi concluded regular-season MCC action with a 2-12 mark and plays at Pasco Tuesday in the first-round of the district tournament needing a win to advance. “It’s going to be sad separating from them (the other seniors),” Hedine said. “I just love the team. I think playing against Pasco, we can hang in there. We can do anything if we just believe in ourselves.” “That (senior leadership) is what is going to carry us through district,” McDaniels said. “The third time is the charm. It’s hard for them (Pasco) to win three times. It’s an awesome opportunity for us.”  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T20:25:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T01:36:48.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
