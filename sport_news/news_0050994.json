Clark added two scores of his own as the Hoyas kept hold in the ‘Battle for the Bell’ series. Special photo Anthony Stalcup slideshow KENNESAW — The “Battle for the Bell” turned into a one-sided affair as Harrison scored 28 unanswered points and won 41-14 over Kennesaw Mountain on Friday at Cobleigh Stadium.Kennesaw Mountain (2-3, 0-2 Region 4 ) was its own worst enemy, committing three turnovers — two fumbles and an interception — that resulted in 20 points for Harrison (5-2, 2-1). Another Mustangs fumble left the Hoyas with a short field that Harrison turned into seven more points.Harrison’s defense didn’t help matters either. It totaled four sacks and limited Kennesaw Mountain to 97 yards in the first half and 2 in the third quarter. A 13-7 first-quarter lead ballooned into a 41-7 fourth-quarter advantage with 2:39 remaining in the game.The win was Harrison’s sixth straight against its Due West rival. The Hoyas lead the series 12-2 overall.“This game was close last year,” Harrison coach Matt Dickmann said, referring to the Hoyas’ 28-25 win in 2014. “(Kennesaw Mountain coach Andy Scott) does a great job with those guys. I told him at the end of the game that they shot themselves in the foot and had some errors that we were able to capitalize on. We managed to take advantage of some of their mistakes.”The first mistake resulted in Chris Kalafut’s 46-yard fumble return for a touchdown and a 7-0 Harrison lead.Adonis Smith’s interception on the ensuing possession provided the Hoyas with a short field, leading to a 2-yard touchdown run for Darius Clark and a 13-0 advantage.Kennesaw Mountain sustained a nine-play, 65-yard drive on its next possession, capped by Brycen Colon’s 23-yard scoring run, but the Mustangs’ next six drives resulted in a fumble, punt, turnover on downs, two more punts and a fumble.“We struggled offensively,” Scott said. “Harrison did some things defensively that caused some issues for us. It wasn’t anything revolutionary. They just played well. They capitalized on our mistakes and executed well.”The first fumble, recovered by Chris Finazzo, turned into a 3-yard touchdown run for Clark and started the scoring binge for Harrison. The subsequent punt, which netted only 21 yards, left the Hoyas with first-and-10 on the Mustangs’ 31. One play later, Justin Fields weaved his way through the defense for a 28-yard score and a 27-7 Harrison lead with 5:35 remaining in the second period.Harrison controlled the clock in the third quarter, possessing the ball for 9:50. The majority of that occurred on its opening 13-play, 6-minute drive. The Hoyas found some success in their passing game during the possession, finishing it off with an 11-yard touchdown reception from Fields to Aidan Loucks.“We run the football so well at times,” Dickmann said, “so putting the ball in the air in the third quarter was part of our game plan and something we wanted to work on.“Our philosophy is to move the chains. We talk about that all the time.”A fumbled punt midway through the fourth period left Harrison just outside the red zone, and the Hoyas took advantage behind Carson Dent’s 6-yard touchdown for a 41-7 lead with 2:39 remaining in the game.Jarrett Guest’s 5-yard touchdown pass to Gregory Martinez with 36 seconds left resulted in the 41-14 final.Clark rushed 18 times for 113 yards and two touchdowns for Harrison, while Fields had eight carries for 62 yards and a score. He also threw for a touchdown and had an interception. Loucks had 35 receiving yards and a touchdown.Greyson Iszler had two sacks, while Kalafut and Mitchell Grimes each had one.Colon had 39 rushing yards and a touchdown for Kennesaw Mountain, which lost 56 yards due to the sacks and fumbles.“My hat goes off to Harrison,” Scott said. “They did an outstanding job.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T10:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T10:07:22.285+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
