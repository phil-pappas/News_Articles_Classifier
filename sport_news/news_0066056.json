Clifton would win. \nThe jewel in the coveted season treble is in place. The next two won't come that easy for the Clifton girls' soccer team. \nEarning a treble or three championships in a single season is rarely achieved but always chased. Inevitably Clifton would need a league, county and state title to breath that rarified air. \nCross the Big North Conference Liberty Division off that season-long bucket list after the Mustangs crushed Passaic County Technical Institute, 4-0, Monday in Wayne. It was PCTI that last month presented the Mustangs with an assortment of issues during a 1-0 loss at Athenia Steel Recreation Complex. \n\"I was happy the way we played,\" Clifton boss Konrad Kruczek said. \"We want to finish the league undefeated and unscored upon this season.\" \nClifton deposited a pair of goals in each half clinch the title and improve to 14-0-1 overall and 7-0 in the Liberty with one league match remaining. It also gives Girls in Maroon four days to recuperate for Saturday's county final against rival Wayne Hills. \nPCTI dipped to 8-8 and 3-3. \nBut the league title was iced before the interval and sealed in the final 40 minutes. Brittany Morales, Meaghan Mancini, Nya Cruz and Sharon Garcia all clicked for goals and Carly Egyed chalked up the clean sheet with three saves. In eight starts, Egyed has four spotless efforts. \n\"I'm feeling comfortable again in goal. I missed some time and then started playing in the field so I was nervous at first,\" Egyed said.''At first I thought I lost it but it's coming back. \n\"In penalty kicks I've been told to play big, meaning your arms and legs are everywhere and it's better chance to make a save. Even though the hit the first one, it took the edge off and I was ready to move after that.\" \nClifton will play another day in the Passaic County Coaches' Association Tournament after eliminating third-seeded Lakeland, 4-2, in penalty kick after the two sides went goalless for 100 minutes of play at Wayne Valley High stadium. \nWith both 'keepers tested throughout regulation and 20 minutes of overtime, it came down to mano a mano. \nWhen Morales and Mancini, two of Clifton's most reliable finishers tucked away their penalty kicks—as did Lakeland's Sammy Jost and Michelle Furman—it was deadlocked heading into the third round. \nFreshman striker Maria Orozco barely made it 3-2 for the Mustangs as Lakeland's Jenna Bracken got a glove on it, but Egyed made the first of her two saves. \nSenior defender Olivia DeMuro blasted home the fourth from the spot and Egyed put away the Lancers with another save. \n\"It was nerve racking I usually don't take PKs [penalty kicks],\" DeMuro said. \nFor their hard work the second-seeded Mustangs will host two-time reigning champions Wayne Hills Saturday in Clifton School Stadium, 2:30 p.m.. \nWith the Liberty Division crown safely in the trophy case, the Mustangs have two knockout tournaments to contend with. \nFirst, the Passaic County Tournament final is Saturday at Clifton Stadium, 2:30 p.m. The Mustangs and top-seeded Wayne Hills is the dream matchup. Earlier this month, Clifton won in double overtime, 2-1, Oct. 1. Mancini's decisive goal from the penalty spot delivered the winning kick. \nThe teams have met in the county final for four consecutive years, with the Patriots winning three, including the last two. With a win or a tie, the Patriots would become the county leader with 12 titles—they are currently tied with Wayne Valley for that honor. Clifton has seven crowns, the last one in 2012 when it stopped Wayne Hills, 1-0. © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T07:31:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T16:00:03.542+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
