(For OzarksSportsZone.com) -- The Camdenton Lakers girls’ golf team took second place in the Class 2, Sectional 3 Girls’ Golf Tournament on Monday at Horton Smith in Springfield. The Lady Lakers team of Amber Wilson, Katie Bird, Jennah Shell, Amber Theobald, and Katelyn Bartels combined to shoot a score of 325 to help Camdenton move on to the state tournament for the first time in school history. Warrensburg took home first place as a team with a score of 312. Camdenton head coach Jane Eidson was very proud of the way her team handled things today on the big stage. “I am so proud of these girls. They have worked hard all season, and they came through today,” Eidson said. “We had some scores today that were better than usual and it paid off.” Camdenton sophomore, Amber Wilson, led the entire group of golfers with a score of 71. Wilson relied on her putting skills to carry her team to a second place finish.“My putting was very good today,” Wilson said. “It saved my score because I was not hitting very many fairways at all, and some days you’ll have that.” Warrensburg's Hanna Johnson, who had never broken par in her high school career, had a career day with a 4-under 66 for top medalist honors. Carl Junction’s Kylie Carnes advanced to the State Tournament by shooting a score of 73, and right behind her was Kickapoo junior, Ari Acuff. This is the second year in a row that Acuff will advance to the state tournament, and she said she cannot wait to perform again on the big stage.“It was a huge deal for me to get back there and represent my school,” Acuff said. “This is my second year in a row, and I am looking forward to it because I want to do big things.” The Class 2 state tournament will take place next Monday and Tuesday, October 12-13th at the Rivercut golf course in Springfield. Individual qualifiers Kylie Carnes, Carl Junction, 73 Ari Acuff, Kickapoo, 74 McKenna Rice, Lee’s Summit West, 74 Anna Lorio, Joplin, 76", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T03:37:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T04:56:51.778+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
