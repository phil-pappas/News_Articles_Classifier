Posted: Sunday, October 18, 2015 6:27 pm Intramural sports program director helps FSU get its games on By Sammy Batten Staff writer \nJudging by the daily traffic through his office, Tim Heath may be one of the most popular people on the Fayetteville State University campus. \nFrom the time Heath opens his office in Lilly Gymnasium at 9 a.m. until it closes late in the evening, a steady stream of students, faculty and staff is coming and going. \n\"It is pretty busy,'' Heath said on a recent afternoon. \"This office has constant traffic.'' \nPeople come seeking out Heath or members of his two-person staff to participate in FSU's intramural sports programs. \nHeath was hired as the school's first full-time director of intramurals in 2001 and has held that post since. \nThe job requires Heath to budget, organize and schedule for activities ranging from flag football to Zumba classes that are open to the entire university community. \n\"I deal with people from academic affairs, student affairs, all classes of students from freshmen to graduate students and even alumni within the community,'' he said. \"I'd say my interaction is broad and wide and diverse.'' \nBroad, wide and diverse also is a good description of Heath's career. \nAfter helping Seventy-First High School win the state 3-A football championship in 1970, Heath accepted a scholarship to play at Fayetteville State. An All-NAIA running back for the Broncos, he was later elected to the FSU Athletic Hall of Fame. \nHeath embarked on a successful coaching career in the high school ranks after graduating from FSU. He earned his Master's degree from FSU in 1991, which prompted him to leave high school coaching in 1993 to pursue a career in education administration. \nThe path eventually led him back to FSU where, in addition to running the intramural program, he previously served as an assistant football coach and currently is also an adjunct lecturer in the Department of Middle Grades, Secondary and Specialized Subjects. \nHe is married to the women's basketball coach, Eva Patterson-Heath. \nThrough the years, Heath has seen the support for intramurals grow dramatically at FSU. \n\"When I started I was the only staff member,'' he said. \"I was taking the balls and bats or whatever equipment was needed, tossing it in my truck and carrying it to the fields. \n\"Now we have a budget that allows us to purchase things to help us transport equipment to venues and we have a full-time staff of three people.'' \nHeath and his staff are managing the flag football season, which involves 10 teams and more than 150 students. \n\"We have some sport or event going on constantly,'' he said. \nAnd that's why Tim Heath is one of the most popular people on the Fayetteville State campus. \nStaff writer Sammy Batten can be reached at battens@fayobserver.com or 486-3534.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-19T01:27:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-20T08:54:03.462+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
