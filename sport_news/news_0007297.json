Charles will have an MRI on Monday. \nHe missed most of the 2012 season after tearing the ACL in his left knee. \nTwo other big-name players who exited Sunday were a pair of pass rushers: DeMarcus Ware of the Broncos, and Elvis Dumervil of the Ravens. \nWare left on a cart with an injured back during the first half of Denver's game at Oakland. Dumervil hurt his groin in the first half against Cleveland, and was joined on Baltimore's sideline by defensive backs Lardarius Webb (thigh) and Will Davis (knee). \nIn other injury news: \n— The Patriots (Dont'a Hightower; rib) and Bears (Shea McClellin; knee) lost linebackers, too. \n— Jaguars CB Davon House was using a cane in the locker room after hurting his hip against the Bucs. Jacksonville also had two running backs leave: T.J. Yeldon (groin) and Bernard Pierce. For the Bucs, FS Chris Conte left after hurting his ankle. \n— Falcons C Mike Person left with an ankle sprain, and WR Leonard Hankerson returned despite a rib injury, two players who won't get much time to heal because Atlanta plays at New Orleans on Thursday night. \n— The Rams and Packers each lost key players on both sides of the ball in their game, with St. Louis seeing G Roger Saffold (shoulder) and DL Chris Long (knee) get injured, while Green Bay G T.J. Lang (knee), DT B.J. Raji (groin) and LB Nick Perry (shoulder) out. \n— Other skill players who left games: Saints WR Marques Colston (arm injury), Redskins RB Matt Jones (sprained toe) and Bills RB Cierre Wood (knee). \nOnline: \nAP NFL website: http://www.pro32.ap.org and AP NFL Twitter feed: http://www.twitter.com/AP_NFL \n ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T01:56:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T03:11:24.073+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
