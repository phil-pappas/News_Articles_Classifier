USC athletic director Pat Haden said he told Sarkisian to take a leave when it was ‚Äúclear to me that he was not healthy.‚Äù\npic.twitter.com/HrCdpkiAQk\n‚Äî ‚ö°Ô∏èDaelin Hayes‚ö°Ô∏è (@DaelinHayes_24) October 11, 2015\nHayes is ranked as the No. 9 player at his position and the No. 2 player in the state of Michigan by the 247Sports Composite.\nHe chose USC over Notre Dame when he made his initial selection in July and had shaved the USC logo into his head when he played at Nike‚Äôs The Opening in July. Among his other offers when he chose USC were Alabama, Georgia, LSU, Michigan, Oklahoma, Ohio State and others.\nFour-star Notre Dame commit D.J. Morgan was already working on Hayes as soon as he decommitted. Hayes has an official visit scheduled to Notre Dame.\nCome on and join the #F16ht üçÄ Notre Dame is where it's at!

When you‚Äôre confident with a system, it really helps and that‚Äôs my logic behind early enrollment. Getting in and working within the playbook and learning in the offseason. That way, by the time fall comes around, it will be instinct instead of trying to pick up a new playbook on the fly.‚Äù ¬© Provided by USA Today Sports Media Group LLC Daelin Hayes (Photo: Army All-American Bowl)\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfasDK.img&quot;}}", "https://t.co/C2GdPbpMHg", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/ND?src=hash", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfl4SL.img&quot;}}", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAflmzT.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAxGGq&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;The", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;USC", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/BB6qRzt.img&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;Sarkisian", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;}", "https://twitter.com/dj_morgan27/status/653365328836100096", "http://usatodayhss.com/2015/selection-tour-daelin-hayes-has-had-his-eye-on-army-game-for-some-time", "http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://c.120sportsstatic.com/gen/client/rss/timeline.xml&quot;},{&quot;ns&quot;:&quot;ignore_this_version&quot;,&quot;value&quot;:&quot;System.Collections.Generic.List`1", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/pac12/2015/10/11/usc-coach-steve-sarkisian-leave-of-absence-pat-haden/73787066/", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/b?&quot;,&quot;Category&quot;:&quot;football_ncaa&quot;},&quot;Mute&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;HomePageLink&quot;:&quot;//www.msn.com/en-us&quot;,&quot;GeofenceUseSps&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;GeofenceEnabled&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;AutoPlay&quot;:true,&quot;Mute&quot;:true,&quot;SwfCacheRefreshTime&quot;:86400,&quot;AdConfig&quot;:{&quot;FWFlashProfile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_US_AS3_LIVE&quot;,&quot;FWHtml5Profile&quot;:&quot;188286:MSN_HTML5_Live", "https://twitter.com/DaelinHayes_24/status/653356927150329857", "http://ui.bamstatic.com/120sports/util/embed/ots.embed.js&quot;,&quot;tags&quot;:", "http://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAfgzES.img&quot;}},{&quot;csId&quot;:&quot;AAeadnv&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Chip", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "https://twitter.com/hashtag/F16ht?src=hash", "http://t.co/HrCdpkiAQk"], "published": "2015-10-12T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T09:53:31.133+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
