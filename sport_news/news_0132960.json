We want someone collaborative, someone with a vision.” \nSchenirer lauded Wiley, calling him a man wholly dedicated to RT and to the concept of transit. “He’s done a fabulous job.” \nThe transition to new leadership comes at a challenging time for agency, but also one with huge potential for growth, transit observers say. RT provides bus and light rail service to most of Sacramento County. \nThe agency has begun to regain its footing after suffering deep service cuts during the recession. RT recently added a light rail extension to Cosumnes River College, and is expected to start work soon on $6 million in upgrades to aging light rail stations. \nBut RT also has been the target of criticism. A group of downtown business leaders, including representatives of the Sacramento Kings and Republic FC soccer team, publicly called on the agency this year to improve service, security and system cleanliness before the Golden 1 Center sports and entertainment arena opens in October of 2016. \nThe group’ members said they are counting on light rail to bring thousands of arena event-goers to the downtown, and said they feared those riders, many of them likely to be first timers on the system –could be turned off and not ride again if the service is not clean, safe and convenient. \nSeveral RT agency board members, notably Schenirer, Phil Serna and Steve Hansen, have been pushing Wiley’s staff to pursue upgrades quickly as well. Those board members helped form an ad hoc committee that is working with business leaders on ways to improve service in the next year. \nThe agency still struggles with tight financing, which makes such upgrades more difficult to achieve. Moody’s Investors Service downgraded its rating of RT bonds earlier this month, and the agency board this week agreed to a new arrangement for a revolving line of credit with the U.S. Bank National Association under less favorable terms. The transit agency is funded partially on rider fares, but mainly on local, state and federal funds. \nWiley has held the top post since 2007. This year, he hired an outside consultant to look for ways the agency can both increase revenues and cut expenses. That consultant, national transit expert Doug Carter, came up with suggestions that the agency has begun to implement. \nCarter also noted that “the staff appears tired, battered and somewhat over-extended” from struggling amid criticism to improve service despite reduced budgets. \nSchenirer said on Friday that Wiley and his staff have responded professionally to the intense push to modernize quickly. \n“Over the past year or two, we have really started to look at what the agency needs to look like for the next decade,” Schenirer said. “Rather than be defensive, Mike has embraced that change. That is commendable.” \nWiley said the recent pressure to evolve did not play a factor in his decision. \n“I welcome that challenge,” he said. “I think it is great that folks in the community are really taking a strong interest in the services that we provide, the quality of those services, and looking for us to grow.” \nWiley, credited with an encyclopedic mind on transit issues, joined the agency in the 1970s, and served in numerous roles before being promoted to general manager. A graduate of California State University, Sacramento, Wiley oversaw a series of light rail expansions, including the Green Line opening in 2012 and the Blue Line extension to Cosumnes River College last month. \n“I love RT, I love what I do, I love the people here,” he said. “There is a tremendous amount of positive things happening.” \nSerna, a county supervisor and RT board member, commended Wiley as well. \n“His career at RT has been a labor of love,” Serna said. “He takes the challenges and opportunities on his watch very personally; he’s been a great steward of the system.”", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T21:06:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T23:05:14.194+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
