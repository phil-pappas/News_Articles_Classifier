Hingle, Derick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports) \nKickoff : 3:25 p.m., AT&T Stadium \nTV : 3:25 p.m., CBS \nRadio : Noon, 105.3 The Fan \nRecords : Dallas 2-2, New England 3-0 \nSeries : Cowboys lead, 7-4 \nLast meeting : New England, 20-16 (2011, in Foxborough, MA) \nBetting line : Patriots -7.5 \nWeather : Indoors \nWhat's more difficult than playing the best team in football? Playing the best team in football after their bye week. Let's see how these two teams match-up: \nDallas offense vs. New England defense \nAnother game, another significant injury. This time it was Running Back Lance Dunbar who went down with a season-ending knee injury. He is third on the team in rushing with 67 yards and second on the team in receptions (21) and receiving yards (215). There is nobody on the roster than can replace what Dunbar brought to the team which is a running back who could split out wide and be a weapon in the passing game. \nWho steps up? We've been asking that question for several weeks now and look for former Texas A&M Aggie Christine Michael to get more snaps. Joseph Randle (6 receptions, 74 yards) should get more opportunities out of the back field in the passing game as well. \nAs for the rest of the Cowboys offense, Quarterback Brandon Weeden threw the ball down the field more against the Saints and finished the game with a 105.6 QB rating which is the fifth highest of his career. \nOutside of Dunbar's 45-yard run, the Cowboys running game rushed 27 times for 70 yards (2.6 ypc). Dallas ranks 16th in rushing offense (107.8) which is a far cry for last season when they were second (147.1 ypg). \nThe Patriots defense ranks near the bottom of the league in both passing and rushing defense. Linebacker Jamie Collins leads the team in tackles (22), sacks (3.5) and forced fumbles (2). While the defense does give up a lot of yards, they force opposing quarterbacks to throw interceptions as they have five through three games. \nThe strength of this defense resides in their defensive ends (Rob Ninkovich and Chandler Jones) and linebackers (Dont'a Hightower, Jerod Mayo and Collins). The Patriots are below average in the secondary except for strong safety Patrick Chung. \nWeeden is improving every week though the offense continues to lose players to injury. While the Patriots defense is not very good, the Cowboys offense isn't either with Tony Romo, Dez Bryant and now Dunbar out. \nEdge: NEW ENGLAND \nDallas defense vs. New England offense \nThe Cowboys defense gets reinforcements this week with Rolando McClain and Greg Hardy coming back from suspension. The unit lost Sean Lee to a concussion against the Saints last Sunday and while he didn't practice on Wednesday, the team is hopeful he will return against the Patriots and is currently listed as probable. \nThe Cowboys have envisioned having a linebacker unit of McClain, Lee and Anthony Hitchens for quite some time and now the dream will be realized in Week 5. \nThe Patriots offense is out for blood ever since Roger Goodell tried to punish Tom Brady with a four-game suspension. They rank No. 1 in total offense with 446.3 yards per game and are averaging 39.7 points per game which also leads the NFL. Brady has been nearly flawless as he has nine touchdowns and zero interceptions. Four of those touchdowns have gone to the best tight end in the NFL, Rob Gronkowski who is averaging more than 100 receiving yards per game. \nWhile the Patriots are still pass-happy, it looks like they have found a top-tier running back in Dion Lewis who is averaging 4.9 yards per carry and also has 15 receptions out of the backfield. \nThe Cowboys defense is much healthier than the offense, but they are going up against the best this week. It should be fun to see who steps up and makes a play. \nEdge: NEW ENGLAND \nKey match-up \nRob Gronkowski vs. Byron Jones: The Cowboys drafted Jones in the first round for his athleticism and ability to play multiple positions in the secondary. The last couple of weeks he has been lined up against the opposing team's tight end and this week will be no different. Jones will have a difficult task slowing down Gronkowski, but he is the best man for the job. \nEdge: NEW ENGLAND \nSpecial teams \nThe Dunbar injury hurts the running game, but also special teams as he was the No. 1 kick returner on the team. Look for Lucky Whitehead or even McFadden to take over duties. Kicker Dan Bailey is perfect on six field goal attempts this season. \nThe Patriots have only one kick return through three games, but former Cowboy Danny Amendola has averaged nearly 10 yards per punt return. Kicker Stephen Gostkowski has successfully made seven field goals. \nEdge: NEW ENGLAND \nIntangibles \nThe Patriots are out to set the NFL on fire this season and it looks like the Cowboys are just another bump on their way to another Super Bowl. It would've been great to see how a healthy Cowboys team would have looked against the NFL's best, but maybe we can see it in the Super Bowl. \nEdge: PUSH \nPrediction : Greg Hardy has two sacks, but the Patriots defeat the Cowboys, 35-21. \nEddie Middlebrook can be reached on Twitter @emiddlebrook .
