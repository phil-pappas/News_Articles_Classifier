The players had their favorites, too. “I’m proud of Coach (Gary) Brine, he prepared us more than we have ever been for any game,” said Killingly senior Vasileios Politis. Toss out the one glitch, a 48-yard run by Windham’s Cullan Contos, and it was a nearly flawless performance. That performance came in a game that Windham coach Brian Crudden likened to a Killingly-Windham game of the mid-1990’s, before the Killingly program went into hibernation after winning a state title in 1996. The key difference for the Redmen this season is easy to see. “We’re a physical team,” Brine said. “There is no doubt that every one of those kids likes to hit. It’s been awhile since we have been physical.” Physical, but in an intelligent way. “We talked about how it wasn’t going to be easy, how it’s never a pretty game here. We had to win the turnover battle and can’t have penalties. We did that (Friday). It’s a tough place to win. If you come in here and win, it proves something,” said Killingly coach Chad Neal. The Redmen finished even in the turnover battle — both teams threw two interceptions — but the Whippets were hit with six penalties for 61 yards. Killingly did not incur a penalty. The Redmen turned the Whippets into a one-dimensional team. They took away both the running of Seiji Arzuaga and the passing of Brody Labbe and only failed to contain the quickness of Contos (128 yards rushing) at times. Arzuaga rushed for 24 yards while Labbe completed just 2 of 10 passes for 6 yards. Labbe had some chances to complete passes, but the Killingly defense usually got in the way. The Redmen frustrated Windham receiver Tyrek Baker on three occasions. Senior captain Chace Wood and Politis did the honors in the second quarter, knocking the ball out of the senior’s hands on two occasions. Spencer Lockwood did the same early in the third quarter. “They weren’t giving the long play and we were probably forcing it a bit too much. Throw short for go and throw long for show, we tried too much long for show,” Crudden said. Politis went one step further as he intercepted a pair of passes. He picked Willie Brown’s option pass in the first half and a Labbe desperation throw in the final minute of the game. “(Politis) is a smart football player. He studies film, he listens, looks for the little things to improve upon in practice and during the week,” Neal said. Page 2 of 4 - Neal was also pleased with the defensive front four led by Josh Angel and Conner Lemley as well as the play of Lockwood at outside linebacker. “He’s really brought it,” Neal said. “For a guy who, for the first two weeks, didn’t see much (action) on the defensive side, he has really come along nicely.” Brine had his own favorites. “Josh Angel and Austin (Caffrey), but they are supposed to play like that. Guys like Collin Byrnes and Conner Lemley and Kelsy Rhines did a great job and the secondary didn’t let anyone behind them all night,” Brine said. Quarterback shuffle Wish Windham luck this week in guessing who is going to be behind center on Friday for Norwich Free Academy. Starting quarterback Jawaun Johnson, one of the most explosive players in the area, missed a second straight game on Friday against Xavier because of an illness. “We’re going to look at Jawaun this coming week as see how he is,” NFA coach Jemal Davis said. “He was projected to come back in three weeks, probably for the Ledyard game (on Oct. 30), but if we can get him earlier — it’s all predicated on what the doctor has to say and we’ll go from there.” If Johnson isn’t ready to return, the Whippets won’t necessarily see backup Shea McManaway. The sophomore was injured early in the third quarter Saturday, allowing third-stringer Tyler Briggs to take over. McManaway and Briggs each threw three interceptions, but Briggs had much more success moving the offense against Xavier. NFA’s offense changes drastically depending on whether Johnson is in, or one of his sophomore backups. The Wildcats are a pass-first offense behind McManaway and Briggs, and nearly a run-only offense behind Johnson (669 yards rushing). Despite seven turnovers from his inexperienced players on Saturday, Davis seemed encouraged that the Wildcats were able to stay in the game late with one of the defending Class LL state champions. “We had tremendous effort,” Davis said “It’s difficult to overcome the injuries that we’ve experienced these last three weeks, but I tell you, our kids have some resilience. If we get healthy, we’re going to have an opportunity to make a nice little run because we have some guys who are stepping up who are going to add to the guys that are out right now.” If Johnson does return Friday, don’t expect starting running back De’Jean General to be back as well. Davis said Saturday that the back is expected to be out four weeks. Page 3 of 4 - No moral victory In the immediate aftermath of Griswold’s 20-7 loss to Ledyard on Friday night, Wolverines coach Gregg Wilcox gathered his team and made sure none of his players had their heads down. He didn’t necessarily need to. This was no moral victory for the Wolverines. Instead, many of the players were angry and looked like they wanted another shot at the perennial state playoff contender. “They played hard, they never quit, they played together,” Wilcox said. “They came back and battled the entire game. What else can you ask for?” The Wolverines had the potential game-tying touchdown called back on a penalty late in the third quarter before the Colonels, last year’s Class M-Small runner-up, pulled away in the fourth. Griswold’s offense was at its best in the third quarter, with quarterback Cole Mileski using play-action to get out of the pocket and make plays. He completed four of his first five passes of the second half and all six of his completions went to different receivers. He also ran for 49 yards on 10 carries, many of them scrambling away from pressure. “We expected this to be a very tough, physical football game,” Ledyard coach Jim Buonocore said. “They have one of the top contingents of skill athletes in the league, from the quarterback out to the perimeter players. It doesn’t get much better than 1 (Jordan Baker) and 11 (Brandon Yeaton).” Griswold hasn’t been able to get much traction yet this season. The Wolverines opened the season with a win over Killingly, and are the only team to beat the Redmen this year. They led Windham at the half before falling, but then didn’t get many reps in a win over Woodstock. Griswold gave up the first 34 points of the game in a loss at Class LL NFA, then had a bye week before facing Ledyard. Wilcox hopes Friday’s tough loss can be an impetus to finish the season strong. “It’s going to be ugly the rest of the season because now they have that motivation,” Wilcox said. Emptying the bench Plainfield wasted little time building a lead against Central Falls (R.I.) with Isaiah Fort returning the opening kickoff 80-yards for a touchdown en route to a 40-17 victory. The Panthers’ biggest lead was 34-3 late in the second quarter, which allowed Plainfield coach Pat Smith to give some playing time to backups and younger players. Five Panthers backups had their first touches of the season and one, Kegan Marcoux, scored Plainfield’s only second-half touchdown on a 20-yard run in the third quarter. Page 4 of 4 - “Those kids work extremely hard. They work as hard as some of the starters, they’re just not physically or mentally there yet,” Smith said. “So they get out here and they get a chance to get out on the field and it's great for them.” Border feud For the third straight year, Plainfield hosted Rhode Island team Central Falls, and for the third straight year, the Panthers reached the 40-point plateau for a comfortable victory. While any football coach would not be pleased with a lopsided defeat, Central Falls coach Jeff Lapierre said that there is a lot of value to these interstate matchups. “It’s a great experience for our guys to come out here and just to see the way another state, another team plays football,” Lapierre said. “And certainly we don’t need, in my opinion, a bye week because we start to get slumpy.” Lapierre added that Plainfield plays a more assertive style than his team is used to seeing in Rhode Island. “When I first came up here two years ago for our first game, and it just seemed like not necessarily different styles, but they were just so much more aggressive than us,” Lapierre said. “I don't know if that’s just necessarily Connecticut-Rhode Island or just the makeup of my team, but it's football and these guys came straight at us and it was not a lot of razzle-dazzle, it's just straight at us and they just beat us on aggression, and skill obviously.” — Jason Levy, Owen Poole, Brett Poirier and Marc Allard contributed to this story.
