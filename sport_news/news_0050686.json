North Carolina, despite an academic scandal that hangs over its head like an anvil, continues to land quality prospects.\nAnd so, in time, will Louisville — no matter what sanctions the NCAA imposes in regard to the allegations by madam Katina Powell that former basketball operations director Andre McGee paid her and other escorts thousands of dollars and gave them game tickets in exchange for sex with players and recruits from 2010-14.\nThe escort scandal drew national headlines that continue a week later, and stories about this potentially being the demise of Rick Pitino’s powerhouse program.\nOpinions, in both directions, have run rampant. But the only opinions that truly matter for the future health of the program are those from the teenagers who will be recruited by Pitino and his staff, and their families.\nThe last top-100 kid who says — with a straight face — he picked a school because of its morals will be the first.\n“The reality of it is, I don’t think people care,” said one Division I head coach, speaking on condition of anonymity. “That’s the truth no one wants to hear. They care on the periphery, but they are picking schools for certain reasons: education, people, athletics. Unless it’s one of those things, it’s not really a concern.”\nIt’s so early in the process, with so much uncertainty — about what really went on, what kind of sanctions the NCAA will impose and what Pitino knew about the alleged visits by escorts to the basketball dorm — it’s hard to predict how much this will hamper Louisville’s recruiting in the short term.\nSyracuse, North Carolina and SMU have dealt with scandals of their own, and all have continued to recruit well. Rivals.com recruiting analyst Eric Bossi said North Carolina is the best model for what to expect from Louisville. While the Tar Heels have continued to land high-caliber prospects, they aren’t attracting the elite five-star recruits they used to, as the yet-to-be-decided NCAA sanctions hang over the university. The one tricky thing? Unlike Syracuse, North Carolina and SMU, Louisville’s scandal is directly tied to recruiting.\n“There’s no precedent for something like this,” the coach said.\nFurthermore, most of Louisville’s success under Pitino is the result of player development — not luring elite prospects — even though its 2015 class did include two five-star prospects, top-25 players Donovan Mitchell and Deng Adel.\nLouisville is unlikely to land its top targets, five-stars T.J. Leaf and De’Aaron Fox, sources said, though the Cardinals weren’t believed to be in good position with them before the scandal. Elite junior college prospect Bashir Ahmed has held off on his official visit to Louisville, and has no immediate plans to take one at all.\nThe college coach said the biggest question mark he has is how Pitino will explain the controversy to recruits and their families. Will he gloss over it, ignore it or break down what happened?\nRivals schools certainly will use this to negatively recruit against Pitino. As the coach said: “People will use [the fact] your water isn’t purified in recruiting against you. They’ll definitely use it, but it’s about, ‘Do you have enough to sell?’ ”\nOf course, the coach did say this: “I can see where certain families don’t want their kids visiting [Louisville right now].” Bossi agreed. Pitino’s heavy lifting will be to convince parents his program is clean. Kids generally don’t care.\nAfter all, players want to win. They want to reach the NBA. Pitino has proven quite proficient in both categories.\n“This isn’t an ideal situation for Rick Pitino, but this isn’t his first rodeo,” Bossi said. “The guy has been around a long time and he’s a Hall of Famer for a reason. I’m sure they’ll be able to figure things out and adapt.”\nNew Jersey point guard Bryce Aiken of St. Patrick verbally committed to Harvard on Thursday, picking the Ivy League power over Seton Hall and Miami.\nSt. John’s target Mitch Lightfoot, a three-star forward from Tucson, Ariz., takes his final official visit to Arizona this weekend. Kansas, Stanford and Utah round out his final five.\nSt. John’s assistant Matt Abdelmassih will be in Dallas this weekend for the Mullen/Mitchell Jamboree, to see top JUCO target Bashir Ahmed of The Bronx. Ahmed has taken official visits to Cincinnati and St. John’s in recent weeks.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T02:36:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T06:47:37.941+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
