They'll be followed by Carl Edwards, their Joe Gibbs Racing teammate, and Team Penske's Joey Logano.\nAll-time Dover winner Jimmie Johnson, who has 10 victories at the 1-mile concrete track, will start fifth. Ryan Newman, Kurt Busch, Brad Keselowski, Martin Truex Jr. and Jeff Gordon -- making his final Dover appearance -- round out the top 10.\nJamie McMurray and Dale Earnhardt Jr., barely hanging onto Chase berths heading into the Dover elimination race, will start 11th and 12th. Then it's Kyle Busch, Paul Menard, Kevin Harvick and Clint Bowyer -- all of who are on the outside of the playoff looking in.\nTony Stewart, who announced his intention to retire following the conclusion of next season, will start 25th.\nNo drivers failed to qualify, as only 43 teams were entered in the race.\n2015 NASCAR Sprint Cup race winners Go to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nascar/2015/09/29/tony-stewart-column-next-generation-nascar-stars/73054886/"], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T04:48:25.541+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
