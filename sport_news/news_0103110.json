By any name, it was an abysmal way for the Colts to squander a strong first half in this AFC Championship game rematch. And whatever chance it had of working was erased because the well-coached Patriots kept their heads.\nThe Colts trailed 27-21 late in the third quarter when they shifted out of punt formation on fourth-and-3 from their own 37-yard line, leaving receiver Griff Whalen over the ball and safety Colt Anderson under center while the rest of the team aligned wide right.\n“To be honest, I thought they were hard-counting it,” Patriots linebacker Jon Bostic said. “But they snapped it. They may have thought they had a good look.”\nThey didn’t. The Patriots had a player on each side of Whalen (running back Brandon Bolden and Bostic), plus Ryan to the open side of the field as well.\nThough they hadn’t seen the play, the Patriots use a number system in such situations to figure out their matchups, Ryan said. And they were on alert to the potential use of trickery, given their history and the magnitude of this matchup for a Colts team they’d blown out 45-7 back in January.\n“We were ready for it,” Ryan said. “I was like, look, if they snap it, let’s all just go jump him and tackle him, because I don’t know how they’re going to block three of us with one guy.”\nWhalen snapped the ball to Anderson, who didn’t seem to be expecting it and was grabbed immediately by Bolden behind the line of scrimmage. Ryan delivered a shot and Anderson was down for a 1-yard loss – not the way the Colts drew it up.\n“We started working on it last year and then we put it back in this week,” Colts punter Pat McAfee said. “It’s a play where you try to take advantage of numbers. You try to confuse the defense and hopefully get an edge numbers-wise. The look was not there that we normally have in practice where it’s a go.”\nIn other words, the Patriots had it covered. When that happened, Colts coach Chuck Pagano said, they should’ve just taken a delay of game penalty rather than carrying out what McAfee described as “one of the most failed fakes probably of all time” and “just a complete cluster.”\nOfficials also flagged the Colts for illegal formation, since none of the shifted players were on the line of scrimmage, but that was the least of their problems. The Patriots took over and quickly marched for a touchdown to push their lead to 34-21 early in the fourth quarter.\n“I’m glad they did it,” Patriots receiver/punt returner Julian Edelman said. “We got the ball back in great field position. We were (on) alert and our guys went to where we had to go. Shame on them for trying that again.”\nEarlier, the Colts tried an onside kick after safety Mike Adams returned an interception – the product of a Julian Edelman bobble – 14 yards for a touchdown to put Indianapolis ahead 14-10 in the second quarter. But officials ruled the Patriots recovered and upheld the call on review.\n“You’re not surprised with anything, how they play,” Edelman said. “They tried the onside kick and they did that. You know – Colts.”\nThe fake fiasco overshadowed what otherwise was a competitive effort from the Colts, who scored a touchdown on fourth-and-1 to cap their opening drive and led 21-20 at halftime.\nThe Patriots team they fingered in the Deflategate scandal has now won seven consecutive games between the teams, including all five since Luck and Pagano came to Indianapolis in 2012, two of them in the playoffs.\n“We know it’s a big game for them so they’d probably pull out all the stops,” Ryan said. “And that (fake punt) was a big situation and it was short yardage. So, we were definitely aware for the hard count and any type of gadget play that they had. So, that was something we were prepared for.”\nEven though they’d never seen it before – and almost surely will never see it again.\nFollow Tom Pelissero on Twitter @TomPelissero\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/sports/", "http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759", "http://twitter.com/TomPelissero"], "published": "2015-10-19T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-19T18:50:14.316+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
