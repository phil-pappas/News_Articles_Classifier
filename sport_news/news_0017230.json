Limited and even sidelined early this season with a broken finger, he had a breakout game against the Huskies, completing 14 of 25 passes for 272 yards and two touchdowns (no interceptions), showing the dynamic playmaking that the Ducks were looking for when he came to Eugene as a graduate transfer.\nThe offensive line responded, Adams said, by blocking for that extra second, and receivers didn't bail on their routes and turned back to help when needed.\n\"If I start running, they start running,\" he said. \"Whoever's open, go with that (and) try to get the ball to playmakers to make plays.\"\nAdams also tucked the ball and ran or was chased out of the pocket eight times for a net gain of 12 yards, but also had negative yardage, which, he said he's working to eliminate.\nOne way to do that is to trust the Oregon system, another thing he has time to work on now that he doesn't have a game on Saturday.\nTrusting the scheme, Adams said, means \"not skipping past my reads as fast as i do, sitting the pocket and trusting the (offensive linemen.\"\nWhile Adams was out and dealing with the broken finger on his right (throwing) hand, backups Jeff Lockie and Taylor Alie saw significant playing time. Now that he's cementing his starting spot, he said he won't stop competing.\n\"You know all of us have the ability to lead this team,\" Adams said. \"I'm going to keep working, keep learning from those two and learning from (offensive coordinator) coach (Scott) Frost .\"\n— Molly Blue\nmblue@oregonian.com\n@mollyablue", "external_links": ["https://twitter.com/mollyablue"], "published": "2015-10-22T20:15:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T20:21:58.503+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
