Reeve still holds the school record for most starts in a career (110), and is ranked fifth in all-time assists (420). \nThe Fever includes guard Maggie Lucas, who starred at Germantown Academy and Penn State. Lucas is averaging 5.7 points and 15 minutes per game. Her game-high this season is 23 against New York Liberty.\nThe best-of-five series begins Sunday at the Target Center in Minneapolis. \nThis will be the fourth Finals appearance for the Lynx and the third for the Fever. Minnesota won it all in 2011 and 2013 and lost to the Fever in 2012. Hard to believe I This tweet from reporter Mike Rosenberg left us speechless:\n\"September,\" he wrote \"was the first time in 15 years that the NFL went a calendar month *during the season* without a player arrest.\" \nFurthermore, he noted the month marked the first time in six years that a player hasn't been arrested in or out of season. \nRosenberg backed his claim by linking to data from USA Today and the San Diego Union-Tribune. Hard to believe II Jordan Spieth's caddie, Michael Greller, made more money on the course this year than Tiger Woods.\nAccording to the PGA earnings list, Woods pulled down $448,598. Not bad, but no where near what Greller made. \nCaddies make about seven to 10 percent of their golfer's winnings. Spieth earned $20,867,052 this year, so it's not hard to figure out that Greller did farely well. \nIn fact, Kyle Porter from CBSSports.com' Eye on Golf, conservatively estimates that Greller earned $1.12 million. \nWithout ever swinging a club.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T02:26:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T02:47:20.437+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
