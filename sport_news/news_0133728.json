(Photo: Josh Anderson/For the Gazette) Story Highlights Zane Trace beat Adena, 9-6, Friday night, to stay on top of the SVC football race. The Pioneers won despite four turnovers — three fumbles and an interception. An interception from corner back Erick Wrestler with 1:17 left to play sealed the victory. Quarterback Austin Harris led the Pioneers on offense with 124 yards rushing on 27 carries. CONNECT 2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE \nKINNIKINNICK — They just keep winning. \nIn a game that featured a total of eight turnovers — four on each side — Zane Trace once again found a way to come out on top of a scrum with an edgy 9-6 win over the Adena Warriors, Friday night at Zane Trace High School. \n\"After the game, we mentioned turnovers and penalties,\" Zane Trace coach Dwane Hall said. \"I can't tell you how many times we had a big play called back tonight. We'd get the right call in and execute it well and then hurt ourselves. We're better than that. From the penalties and not taking care of the football, there were a lot of mistakes. It puzzles me a little bit because we've been trying to pay attention to those details. But we got what we thought we were going to get from Adena. You have to give them a lot of credit. We were lucky to come away with a win tonight.\" \nLuck wasn't involved on the defensive side of the ball. The Pioneers (7-0, 4-0 Scioto Valley Conference) came into the contest boasting a defensive unit that had allowed just 49 points all season long — 28 of which came in Week 1. \nThat trend continued as the Warriors (4-3, 3-1) gained a total of 224 yards — 69 of which came on one play — and moved the chains just seven times. \n\"Week in and week out, we can lean on our defense a little bit,\" Hall said. \"We know that in the back of our minds. We've been doing that. When we've needed them the most, they've stepped up for us.\" \nAdena also put forth a stingy defensive effort, giving up just 263 yards to a usually high-powered offense and allowing just 13 first downs. \nFor Zane Trace, junior quarterback Austin Harris — who started in place of the injured Joel Dunkle — seemed to push the right buttons at the right times with both his legs and his arm. \n\"Austin has probably gotten the least reps out of any position that we've got,\" Hall said. \"We know that reps are the name of the game. He stepped up big tonight and used his athletic ability. You can't ask for any more than that.\" \nAfter a 13-play, 62-yard drive stalled with 7:40 left in the second quarter, Pioneers' kicker Darby Pillow gave his team an early 3-0 edge with a 31-yard field goal, a score that stood at the half. \nAfter the Warriors started the second half by going three-and-out, Zane Trace blocked a punt attempt to give the offense pristine field position at the Warriors' 21-yard line. Three plays later at the 8:35 mark, Harris scored from two yards out to extend the Pioneer' lead to 9-0 (blocked PAT). \nOn the Warriors' next play from scrimmage, quarterback Jake Dawson provided an answer. \nDawson hit senior Isaac Thomas in stride for a 69-yard touchdown pass with 8:17 remaining, trimming the lead back to three at 9-6 after an unsuccessful two-point conversion try. \nFrom that point on, things got sloppy. \nBoth teams turned the ball over three times — the Pioneers fumbled all three while the Warriors threw three picks. \nAdena had possession inside the Pioneers' 30-yard line twice late in the fourth quarter, but turned the ball over on downs both times. \nAfter Zane Trace failed to convert on fourth-and-short, the Warriors had one last chance with 1:44 remaining in regulation. With 1:17 left, senior Erick Wrestler picked off a pass to seal the victory. \n\"It was pretty insane,\" Wrestler said. \"I blew a coverage one time and wanted to make up for it. I saw the receiver come up and run a post route. So while eyeing the quarterback in my peripheral, I saw the ball get swatted at the line a little bit. I just grabbed it and started running. But it feels good to win. That's what matters.\" \nAside from Wrestler, seniors Trey Davis and Alex Wolff also picked off passes for the Pioneers. Davis was in on eight tackles as well, leading Zane Trace. \nHarris finished the night 5-of-12 passing for 49 yards with 27 carries for 124 yards and a score. Trey Rittenhouse rushed 13 times for 41 yards, alongside Truman Love's 10 touches for 41 yards. Wide receiver Pierce Mowery caught three passes for 32 yards while Tim Gibson hauled in two catches for 27 yards. \nFor the Warriors, Dawson went 4-of-10 passing for 99 yards with a touchdown and two interceptions. Isaac Thomas — who left midway through the third quarter with a knee injury — carried the ball seven times for 55 yards and had the one catch for 69 yards. Cale Free rushed 20 times for a total of 58 yards. \n\"Honestly, we got the win and that's what we're pointing to,\" Hall said. \"Our kids have set themselves up for this. The next game means just as much as this one. I've said that all season. We're going to respond coming out next week.\" \nIn Week 8, Zane Trace will travel to Piketon while Adena hosts Southeastern. \ndwebb@chillicothegazette.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-10T07:52:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T09:47:20.044+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
