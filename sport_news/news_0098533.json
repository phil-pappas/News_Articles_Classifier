Last year it lasted six games. We’ll see how long it lasts this year. Pleasant Valley won its third straight game as Austyn Borre ran for 129 yards and two touchdowns, while Trent Thomas added 85 yards and a score as the Bears ran away with a 50-20 victory over East Stroudsburg South on Friday night at the Purple Pit. It was a tough night for the Cavaliers (1-5), who lost four starters due to injury. ES South also committed 13 penalties, which thwarted the night of quarterback Jake Cirillo, who threw for 257 yards and three touchdowns. Dakota Kross caught five passes for 71 yards, while Changa Hodge caught two touchdowns. A year ago Pleasant Valley reached the playoffs with a six-game winning streak. The Bears looked poised to make another run as they have rattled off three in a row after an 0-3 start. Quarterback Mikey Brown threw for 54 yards. It was Borre who broke the game open on the first snap of the third quarter. The senior broke one tackle at the line of scrimmage and then turned on the speed, outrunning the Cavaliers secondary for a 34-14 lead. Dean Krcic hit three field goals in the second half – kicks from 29, 36 and 23 yards. Eastburg South didn’t do itself any favors trying to stay in the game. The Cavs had eight penalties in the first half alone, and never challenged for the lead after the half. A sloppy first half yielded 41 points. PV’s Mike Mitchell ran for a 59-yard score with no time left on the clock at the end of the first quarter, giving the Bears a 14-7 lead. The Bears took a 20-7 lead early in the second quarter as Borre went 45 yards for the touchdown after being quiet for the first quarter. Thomas added to the lead when he went 18 yards up the middle, backing his way into the end zone for a 27-7 lead. The Cavaliers were not in the mood to give up. Quarterback Jake Cirillo’s pump fake worked perfectly and the quarterback hit Hodge in stride for a 74-yard pass and catch. That touchdown with 2:26 left in the half cut into PV’s lead, 27-14. Borre took the first snap of the third quarter 72 yards, and the Cavs never got within two touchdowns after that point.
