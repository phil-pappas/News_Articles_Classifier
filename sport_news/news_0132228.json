Allie Hale got the scoring started with a goal from a free kick in the 22nd minute, but Union tied the game just 11 minutes later. After that, it was all Reinhardt.Kristin Clegg knocked in a pass from Megan McCall just seconds later to put the Lady Eagles back in front. Katie Goodrich gave Reinhardt some breathing room with her goal from 20 yards out, and the Lady Eagles pulled away late with Clegg and Hale each recording their second goals in the 68th and 70th minutes, respectively.Colby LaFever was in goal for the first half, and Taylor Asher played the second.

They carried that advantage to the half, but the second half was a different story.Reinhardt was unable to muster a single shot on goal in the second half, and a Union goal from just outside the 6-yard box in the 51st minute was enough to send the game into overtime.The Eagles had their chances in the extra period, getting shots from Williams and Matthew Gray, but Reinhardt could not take advantage. That opened the door for Union to score on a penalty kick a short time later to win the game. Although he was unable to save the penalty kick, Reinhardt goal keeper Torge Wiedenroth recorded eight saves.The Reinhardt women (10-2-1, 5-1 Appalachian Athletic Conference) will host Columbia College today in a matchup between the conference’s top two teams.
