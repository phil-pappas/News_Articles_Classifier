Huff started out with the first-team offense during training camp, and slowly saw his role decrease to an afterthought in an offense that was struggling.\nHis lack of a role in the offense was clearly frustrating to Huff, but after the win, head coach Chip Kelly sounded like a man who knew a big game was coming.\n\"We believe a good week of training, you sink to your level of training, and your level of training allows you to play well on Sunday,\" said Kelly. \"He had a good week of training and that allowed him to play well. I thought he did a really nice job for us.\"\nHaving Huff turn in a big game was a potentially major development for the Eagles' offense.\nOne of the many issues for the Eagles' offense through the first four games of the season, prior to their win on Sunday, was the lack of big plays from their wide receivers. The unit was dropping passes, not getting open and not making plays when given the chance.\nOn Sunday, the entire unit did a solid job, and having a more balanced attack -- including the emergence of Huff -- as opposed to having to continually force the ball to wide receiver Jordan Matthews was likely why.\n\"I would say so. We were able to get the ball going on the ground and in the air,\" Huff said on if this was the kind of game the offense needed. \"We had a balanced attack, we were able to get our running backs involved and we spread the ball around. It was fun.\"\nFun is something Huff hasn't been having, but that changed on Sunday, from being on the field to doing flips into the end zone.\nIf Huff can continue to make an impact, the Eagles' offense could slowly start to become the dangerous unit it was supposed to be.\n\"That's been my goal ever since the season started,\" Huff said. \"I've prepared every week like I was going to have my number called.\"", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T13:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T12:57:18.262+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
