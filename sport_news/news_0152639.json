The win also was the 10,000th in Yankees history.\nIt didn’t come easy, though. The Yankees scratched out two runs over six innings against lefty Rich Hill , the 35-year-old Milton native who has been the most improbable feel-good story of the Sox’ late-season revival, then tacked on two runs against the bullpen.\nMaking his fourth start since returning to the big leagues after a season spent initially as a reliever in Triple A and later as a starter for an independent league team in nearby Long Island, Hill allowed second-inning runs on Carlos Beltran ’s leadoff homer and a two-out single by Brendan Ryan that followed a pair of uncharacteristic walks to John Ryan Murphy and Didi Gregorius . Otherwise, the Yankees barely dented Hill, who scattered four hits and struck out six.\nAsked if he believes his four-start cameo was enough to prove he merits a shot in a major league rotation next season, Hill said, “One-hundred percent.” It’s hard to disagree. He struck out 10 batters in each of his first three starts against the Rays, Blue Jays and Orioles, his tour de force coming in a 116-pitch shutout of Baltimore last week at Fenway Park. Overall, he allowed five runs on 14 hits, struck out 36 batters and walked only five for a 1.55 ERA.\n“If you look at the overall body of work, there was a lot to build off of from there and looking forward to next year,” said Hill, who is eligible for free agency. “If anybody goes out there and looks at those four games, it’s four quality starts. That speaks for itself.”\nAlas, the Red Sox were unable to get much going against Yankees starter CC Sabathia , who delivered the kind of start that Ivan Nova , Michael Pineda and Masahiro Tanaka were unable to in the previous two games. They scored in the fifth inning on singles by Deven Marrero and Sandy Leon and a one-out RBI single by Mookie Betts , the only offense on a night when they didn’t record an extra-base hit and left eight men on base.\nThe Sox also had their season-long six-game winning streak snapped. They must sweep a three-game, season-ending series in Cleveland beginning tonight in order to finish the season with a .500 record.\nMeanwhile, the Yankees will play in the one-game wild card playoff Tuesday night, likely at Yankee Stadium, against either Houston or the Los Angeles Angels..\nPapi rests\nDavid Ortiz sat out the finale against the Yankees, and manager Torey Lovullo said it’s unclear whether the 39-year-old designated hitter will play in any of the season’s final three games in Cleveland because of “general soreness,” likely a product of having started 49 of the first 52 games after the All-Star break while he chased his 500th career home run.\n“The body is tired,” Lovullo said. “He’s had a really, really good season, and I don’t want to put him in a situation where he’s going to run up against an injury. ”\nIf Ortiz does play against the Indians, Lovullo suggested he might get only a few at-bats in each game before being replaced.\nOrtiz is batting .272 with 36 homers, 105 RBI and a .905 OPS, better actually than last season (.263, 35 homers, 104 RBI, .873 OPS).\nClay’s OK\nClay Buchholz won’t get his wish of pitching one inning in Cleveland this weekend. But the right-hander will enter the offseason with something that was equally important to him: Peace of mind.\nBuchholz hasn’t pitched since July 10, when he walked off the mound at Fenway Park in the fourth inning of a game against the Yankees complaining of elbow soreness. He was diagnosed with a flexor strain, and with the Sox falling out of contention after the All-Star break, he opted for a conservative course of treatment.\n“If we were in a different scenario, a different position, I would’ve started doing my stuff to get back to starting games a month ago,” Buchholz said. “But it really wasn’t worth it, the position we were in, the position I was in. We weighed our decision and came out with I’d rather be healthy going into the offseason and healthy the beginning of next year than something happening, us not making the playoffs and me having to rehab all offseason.”\nBuchholz threw another bullpen session here Wednesday and emerged without any issue. He’s unsure whether he will throw again in Cleveland, but because Buchholz has been given a clean bill of health, it’s almost certain the Red Sox will exercise their $13 million option on his contract for next season.\nAwards season\nSix hits shy of 200, shortstop Xander Bogaerts was named Red Sox’ MVP by the Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers Association of America. He will be honored at the 77th annual writers’ dinner on Jan. 21 in Boston.\nOther winners include Eduardo Rodriguez (Pitcher of the Year, Rookie of the Year), Betts (Hustle Award), Jackie Bradley Jr. (Comeback Player of the Year), Ryan Hanigan (Unsung Hero), Koji Uehara (Fireman of the Year), Ortiz (Special Achievement Award) and top prospect Yoan Moncada (Minor League Player of the Year).", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-02T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T13:55:32.455+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
