First it was a fourth-quarter touchdown drive in 2013; last year it was overcoming a 14-point halftime deficit. \nFriday night, the Comets were at it again. Down by 14 at the intermission and having only 32 yards of total offense, Hackensack wasn’t fazed. It took its first lead with 2:07 left and then survived a Maroon comeback. \nHackensack eked out a 28-27 win when an extra point try with 1.4 seconds left in the game sailed just wide of the left post, handing the Comets an important win. \n“I’ve certainly learned in three years just how tough Ridgewood is,” Hackensack coach Benjie Wimberly said. “Our guys were never down, though. At halftime, you would have thought we were up 14-0 instead of down 14. The seniors took this game over.” \nThe third quarter didn’t start well for Hackensack (4-2), as Brendan McCarthy intercepted for Ridgewood on the opening drive. The Maroons (5-2) couldn’t move it and when the Comets got it back they started the comeback. \nJustin Marin, held to 12 yards on 3 carries in the first half, started seeing some running room and Bryce Drakeford found tight end Jaysen Thompson over the middle for 29 yards to set up a 9-yard Thompson TD catch. \nA Ridgewood lost fumble, its third of the game, gave Hackensack momentum and another 28-yard Thompson reception set up Sandy Almonte’s 2-yard run to tie it up at 14. \nRidgewood regained the lead on a 50-yard touchdown run by Drew Granski (19 carries, 124 rushing yards) and the Maroons went into the fourth quarter up 21-14. \nHackensack came right back, with Marin (14 carries, 108 yards) picking up key yards. Jordan Hunter finished off the march with a tying 9-yard touchdown reception from Drakeford, tying it up with 9:18 to go. \n“We switched to more ‘H’ back formation and that seemed to open things up a bit more,” Wimberly said. “That also allowed Thompson some space. He’s our best receiver and he made the plays.” \nRidgewood looked ready to retake the lead, moving downfield until Winston Solomon stopped Granski on a counter for a two-yard loss on third down. A fourth down pass went incomplete and Hackensack took over. \nMarin ran five times for 46 yards against a tiring Ridgewood defense and Almonte broke a tackle at the line of scrimmage and swept the left side for the go-ahead 22-yard score. Toros Asudour kicked his fourth point after to make it 28-21. \nThe Maroons made the last gasp drive, with runs of 30 yards by Zack Feagles and 21 yards by Griffin Peene getting them in position. On fourth down, Peene scored from the one on a QB sneak, but the missed PAT left them stunned. \n“We stopped ourselves in the first half,” Ridgewood coach Chuck Johnson said of two lost fumbles. “We wore down a bit. This one’s tough.” © 2015 North Jersey Media Group Tags:", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-24T07:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-24T08:32:46.456+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
