It houses the music department and has an elegant concert chamber. Next to it is Kingsbury Hall, which has hosted such musicians as Harry Belafonte, Judy Collins and Carol Channing.\nAcross the street, in the parkway, there’s another kind of music going on this week. Strike up the marching band. ESPN's \"College GameDay\" is in town for Saturday’s Utah-California football game. But wait. Isn't GameDay two words?\nTake it up with the word police.\nFor two days, the network giant is commandeering the campus, bringing its own brand of grammar. Get ready for an overload of physicality, cover twos, nickel packages and other sports jargon. For the first time since 2010, ESPN’s monster pregame program is back in Utah. If you don’t know what \"GameDay\" is, you’ve been stuck in one of the Kingsbury Hall broom closets since it opened in 1930.\nSeven semi-trucks were parked in the circle on Friday. Twenty portable bathrooms lined the parkway. A stage was erected for the on-air personalities, flanked by a big screen, speakers and grandstands. As of noon, 25 tents also had been set up by students hoping to land some airtime. One tent included a sign saying, “Camp Corso,” in honor of venerable ESPN personality Lee Corso.\nMarc Lodmell, a student at Utah, began staking his tent about 9 p.m. Thursday.\n“You don’t get to do this that often,” he said.\nWould you want to?\n“We’ll find out tomorrow,” he said.\n\"GameDay\" is beyond an ordinary pregame program; it's a cultural phenomenon. Sometimes it’s bigger than the actual contest. Take for example the 2013 and 2014 stops in Fargo, N.D. The idea is to excite fans by previewing and reviewing national games from a campus setting. The fact No. 5 Utah and No. 23 California are meeting was enough to convince the ESPN cast and crew — numbering 100-125 — to visit Salt Lake.\nViewership for \"GameDay\" broadcasts are typically around 2 million.\nSalt Lake and the university had on their best faces Friday, thanks to a bright autumn afternoon. The crown of the administration building was wrapped in a banner proclaiming, “Welcome to Salt Lake City.”\nNo, it wasn’t for the Peter Cole poetry reading.\nThings will really pick up Saturday when the actual \"GameDay\" show airs, beginning at 7 a.m.\n“[Utah] is one of America’s best-kept secrets,” said network quarterback analyst George Whitfield.\nAnalyst David Pollack added that Saturday’s \"GameDay\" at Utah “is setting up as a place to be absolutely stupid,” meaning ridiculously successful.\n“It’s going to be awesome,” he said.\nIt certainly got off to a stupidly successful start Friday. Fans brought signs ranging from the predictable “This is the place” to “The original BCS Busters are all grown up” to a political statement. Alongside the initials FCS, which stand for Football Championship Subdivision, one sign spelled out the words “Fund Basic Science.”\nSamantha Ponder, Desmond Howard and Pollack handled Friday’s duties on set, reviewing Thursday’s USC -Washington game and dropping an occasional reference to Utah’s high ranking.", "external_links": ["http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team93.html", "http://deseretnews.sportsdirectinc.com/football/ncaaf-teams.aspx?page=/data/ncaaf/teams/team71.html"], "published": "2015-10-10T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-10T23:32:52.235+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
