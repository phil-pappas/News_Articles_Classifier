Not only did Patil skip Navratri at home, he also stayed away from massive Vijaya Dashami celebrations that he had been organising for the past seven years.\nAlthough \"booth jeeto, chunao jeeto (win booths, win the polls)\" is the BJP's general election management principle, Patil announced the special gift only for Nalanda during the course of assembly-wise meetings on October 19-20, party members said.\n\"The incentive of getting honoured and recognised by Modi and Shah's trusted lieutenant from Gujarat is expected to fire booth level in-charges to trounce Nitish on his home turf,\" said the BJP election manager cited earlier.\nPatil also supplied about 2,000 booth level in-charges with lists of voters in their respective areas, party members said.\nOn the morning of Dussehra, Patil held a brief discussion in Patna with Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, election co-in-charge for Bihar, only to rush to Nalanda for executing his plans in Nitish Kumar's pocket borough through the day.\nAssisting Patil is Union minister Giriraj Singh, a bitter critic of the chief minister since the days of their alliance in Bihar, and Mahesh Giri, Lok Sabha member from East Delhi. Patil, Singh and Giri held a meeting of the party's booth level workers from three assembly segments on October 19 and four segments on October 20. Two days later, on Dussehra, Patil followed up with a meeting to review the progress on \"booth jeeto, chunao jeeto\" strategy in Nalanda.\nSix of the seven assembly segments (Asthawan, Biharsharif, Islampur, Hilsa, Nalanda and Harnaut) are held by the JD(U) while Rajgir assembly segment was won by BJP in 2010 assembly elections when the two parties were in alliance.\n\"We will teach Nitish a lesson on his home turf Nalanda in this election,\" asserted a key BJP campaign manager, underlining the prestige battle that the district has become for the party given the bitter political rivalry between Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar, the two main protagonists of Bihar elections this time. The BJP has planned a Modi rally of \"no less than two lakh people\" in Biharsharif assembly segment on October 25, just three days before voting.
