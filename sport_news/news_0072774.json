Every one of those top six can break 40,\" said Eisenhour about the team's nine-hole potential. \"What we have this year is that we have across the board players that can all jump up there and take the top positions.\" \nCarondelet produced a season for the ages in East Bay Athletic League play. The Cougars went undefeated, never posting a score higher than 214 in nine-hole play. Eight times they produced team scores under 200. Carondelet's score of 182 against Monte Vista at Round Hill Country Club in Alamo on Oct. 13 was a school record and a league record, Eisenhour said. \nWhat makes this team special? \"I think their desire to achieve is greater, their capacity to perform under pressure and the mere fact that they are all tournament players,\" Eisenhour said. \"They do not take this as a joke. They are serious about it.\" At the EBAL Tournament on Monday, Carondelet continued its winning streak with a seven-shot victory over second-place Monte Vista at San Ramon Golf Club. \nAmador Valley's Miranda Wang was the medalist at the EBAL Tournament with an impressive 4-under 69, which included eight birdies. Carondelet's Yealimi Noh and Annika Borrelli and Monte Vista's Hailey White were tied for second with even-par scores. Angela Bagasbas at 74 was Carondelet's third golfer in the top five.

She hits 250,\" Eisenhour said. \nThe Cougars will be very motivated at the North Coast Section Division I Tournament of Champions at Boundary Oak Golf Course in Walnut Creek on Nov. 2. Last season, Carondelet missed the third and final team spot for the NCGA/CIF Northern California championships by one stroke. DOMINATING PERFORMANCE: Another girls golf team which shined Monday was Dougherty Valley at the Diablo Foothill Athletic League Tournament. The Wildcats won the team title with an outstanding score of 378 in the par-71 competition at Diablo Creek Golf Course in Concord. Dougherty Valley also had the medalist in Yoonhee Kim, who shot 70. Six shots back were four other players, including Dougherty Valley's Siobhan Sher and Sammy Lee. \nLast year, Dougherty Valley placed fifth at the CIF state championship. Kim won a playoff at the NorCal tournament after tying for first after 18 holes.
