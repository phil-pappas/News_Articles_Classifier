His talents carried him through three high schools, a commitment to one college and then a season at another before he was in the NBA at just 19 years old. \nWhen the spotlight was just fading on his basketball career, a new one focused on him as he married into the Kardashian clan, a sadly sympathetic figure in the publicity-hound family, even briefly having a show centered around his bride, Khloe Kardashian and himself. \nNo one knows for sure what led Odom, who had overcome so much, back down a troubled path, but there were no cameras there Tuesday when he was, according to reports, unconscious, vomiting up fluids, succumbing to a combination of drugs and alcohol. There were plenty of willing faces to talk about it, from the brothel’s attention-grabbing owner, Dennis Hof, to the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was giving updates after visiting the hospital room. But Odom had spoken out himself in recent years about depression and trying to survive in the glare of the public eye. \nAt the Knicks’ practice facility Wednesday the workout had a somber tone with so many players and coaches connected to Odom. Knicks’ coach Derek Fisher had been a teammate for years and many members of the coaching staff were part of that team. Sasha Vujacic played with Odom even longer than Fisher. Carmelo Anthony grew up watching Odom as a high school star and played with him on the 2004 U.S. Olympic squad — their families becoming friendly with Anthony’s wife, La La, having her own reality series. \n“That’s a tough situation to be in,” Anthony said. “It works for some people and it don’t work for others. “So I think you just have to come down to the individual and know how to manage that and put priorities in place.” \nThe spotlight is familiar to any of the professional athletes and Anthony, as much of a star as he is, has resisted being a part of the reality TV world. \nFisher found himself shifting from the sports pages to the gossip pages last week with his own off-court troubles. \n“For me I wasn’t in the situation like that, as far as my life being public,” Anthony said. “My life is public, it is what it is and I can’t take that back. But I know how to compartmentalize that. I know when it’s time to play ball. I know when it’s time to work it’s about business. \n“I know off the court I do what I have to do with my family, my business and things like that. So it’s different. You have to know how to manage that, those two different lifestyles.” \nOdom nearly became a Knicks player, signing a contract just before the final game of the 2013-14 season — less than a month after Phil Jackson took over as team president. It was the first personnel move of Jackson’s tenure, reaching out to a player who had been a major part of his championships in Los Angeles. But before he ever played a game with the team, less than two months later, Odom was released with Jackson issuing a statement that said, “Unfortunately, Lamar was unable to uphold the standards to return as an NBA player.” \nOdom last played in the NBA with the Los Angeles Clippers in the 2012-13 season, went through a very public divorce from Kardashian, and was trying, reportedly even in recent weeks, to resurrect his playing career. \n“Lamar’s health is always my No. 1 concern so any disappointment is totally personal,” Fisher said of having to release Odom. \n“Not whether he plays basketball again but just his overall health. That really didn’t matter to me. I know he wanted to get back on the court at some point but it’s always been about his health and that’s what I’m hoping will be the focus here.” \nWhat the cameras captured, whether it was the freakish ability that was reminiscent of another Lakers’ star, Magic Johnson, with a combination of size and skills rarely united, or his personal life, what everyone who knew him saw on camera and off was a man far more likable than his circumstances might have portended. \n“He’s in the fight of his life right now,” Vujacic said. “We’re all rooting for him. I think he will win this battle. He’s a guy with a heart of gold. He is in our prayers and I think he’ll pull through it. \n“We played a long time together. We won together. We understood what it means to be in a band of brothers, what it means to go through a lot of things together. It’s just life. It takes a different direction later on. It’s sad in a way. He’s someone with a heart of gold. And right now he’s fighting the battle of his life. We should all be cheering him on in our thoughts and prayers. I think he’ll win this battle.” \nWhatever happens next, the cameras have arrived again. Khloe and her mother, Kris Jenner, were at the hospital Wednesday, and the gossip sites and shows have arrived, chronicling the latest episode in the life of Lamar Odom. \nEmail: popper@northjersey.com  ", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-15T17:07:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-15T19:50:58.204+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
