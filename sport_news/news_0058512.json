He has won 12 of them. He has recruited extremely well. And he’s on the hot seat?\nSeriously, this is the opinion emanating across the nation from Southern California today: The USC football coach – halfway through his second season – is in danger of being replaced , and the man to replace him should be Eagles coach Chip Kelly .\nYes, Thursday’s 17-12 loss to unranked Washington was ugly — Lane Kiffin ugly. The 17th-ranked Trojans are better than their 3-2 record, definitely better than their 1-2 mark in the Pac-12. They played poorly against the Huskies, against whom they were 17.5-point favorites.\nBut to jettison a coach so early, a coach who was extremely successful in his last job, is beyond silly. It’s a hot take they wouldn’t even go with on First Take. This has nothing to do with Sarkisian’s drunken appearance at preseason pep rally , which he attributed to a combination of alcohol and medication.\nEagles coach Chip Kelly Photo: AP Kelly would be a natural fit, but he has an NFL job, and has shown no indications he wants to return to college.\nConsider this: Sarkisian turned Washington from a laughingstock — the Huskies went 0-12 the year before his arrival — into a quality Pac-12 program that finished over .500 four of his five seasons and reached four bowl games.\nSarkisian inherited a mess from Kiffin, but the transformation is well underway. USC’s 2016 recruiting class currently is ranked No. 5 in the country , according to Rivals.com. Their 2015 class was No. 1 and the 2014 haul was No. 10. The program is flush with talent.\n  chip kelly ,  lane kiffin ,  steve sarkisian ,  usc trojans", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-09T16:47:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-09T21:04:17.001+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
