In Grade 9, he was a setter before moving to left side his junior varsity year. Now in Grade 11, he’s staying on the outside for his first year of varsity and is challenging for a starting spot. \nDan McMillan has coached Hyra for the last few years, including in club and in JV last season. He admitted attacking wasn’t Hyra’s forte in Grade 9, but he moved him to left side last year. Hyra is now five-foot-nine and 150 pounds and is a solid passer and attacker that has warranted a lot of court time so far this season. \nHowever, Hyra admits it has been a bit of an adjustment to play in the varsity ranks. \n“I feel like it’s been pretty good,” he said. “I noticed a big change from JV. It’s a lot quicker and higher net and bigger blocks and quicker sets as well. It’s something I’ve had to adjust to but I feel like I’ve been improving every practice. \n“Just try to get your mind around it and not falling back to what you were used to at JV. I feel the more I get used to it at the varsity level, it just is starting come more naturally.” \nIt’s not just volleyball that Hyra is trying to excel at. He was on Massey’s hockey team, which won the Westman High School Hockey League last season, and is a long-distance runner on the Vikings’ track and field team. \nHe finished 21st at provincials in the junior varsity boys’ 800-metre race in two minutes 20.05 seconds and was 28th in the 1,500m at 5:09.16. However, he doesn’t take track and field as seriously. \nHockey is different matter. Hyra, who is a defenceman, is trying out for the hockey team again and isn’t sure whether he likes hockey or volleyball more, although volleyball is a big focus right now with that season already underway. \nHyra is slowly becoming more and more confident in his role on the court and takes a lot of pride in being able to compete with taller players and his defensive game. \n“I feel like it’s just moving your feet,” he said. “If you’re not moving your feet, it’s pretty tough to get to the ball, so you just have to look for seams in the block and if there are seams you have to fill the hole. Just absorb the ball and pop it up for our setter. \n“We have a good setter in Dylan Sutherland, and if you can get him the ball, then he’s going to make everyone on the court better.” \nThe Vikings came into the weekend fifth in the Manitoba High Schools Athletic Association’s AAAA rankings before they placed fourth at the their own tournament. They fell in three sets to the ninth-ranked Vincent Massey Trojans from Winnipeg in the semifinals. \nHyra, who was also part of the 16-and-under Brandon Volleyball Club, which placed third in Division 2 at nationals last season, hopes the Vikings can stay in the top 10 this year and advance to provincials, although he expects a stiff challenge from the Crocus Plainsmen for that right. \nHyra would like to play a key role in getting the team to provincials and McMillan believes he has that opportunity if he keeps developing. \n“His passing is so spectacular that it would be a waste, in my opinion, for him not to be passing all the time,” McMillan said. \n“He could be a libero but his attacking is so good. His jump is good and he reaches really high and has a high block touch. He’ll be a valuable asset for us over the next year and a half.” \n» cjaster@brandonsun.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T11:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T14:44:25.183+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
