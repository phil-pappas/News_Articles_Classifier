Or they could slip to third and travel. \nThe Bears’ defense took care of matters – especially in the first half – as CV handled the Ferris Saxons 27-8 in a Greater Spokane League 4A matchup at Albi Stadium. \nIt was no secret which CV player played the biggest role. Senior cornerback Ben Craig had three interceptions, jumping atop the league leaders with five. And his one catch on offense was a 50-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tanner Sloan. \nCV improved to 6-2 overall, 3-1 in league. Ferris fell to 2-6, 1-3. \nIt was a nice bounce back by the Bears after Gonzaga Prep put a 35-13 whipping on them last week. \n“Right when the game was over last week (Tanner) Gummersall (starting safety) said ‘what are we going to do now boys?’ That was the quote of the week,” CV coach Rick Giampietri said. “We got it done. I was worried about this team (Ferris) because they’ve been playing solid but just have given up the big plays.” \nGiampietri praised Craig’s all-around play. He has a league-leading five interceptions. \n“He played great,” Giampietri said. “And he had a fourth (interception) that he dropped.” \nCraig said the Bears can still clean some things up and improve. \n“It was a more focused practice week for sure,” Craig said. “But we’ve still got a lot of work to do.” \nThe Bears’ depth on the offensive and defensive lines was tested. They have a couple players nursing injuries. \nIn the first quarter, CV linebacker Travis Hawkins got an interception deep in Saxons territory, setting the Bears up at the 9. \nThe Saxons’ defense didn’t let the Bears in the end zone, and CV settled for a 29-yard field goal with 5:27 remaining in the first quarter. \nThat score held going into the second period. \nA poor punt set CV up at Ferris’ 26. Five plays later, Gage Connole scored on a 2-yard run on fourth-and-goal. Sloan faked the dive to defensive tackle/fullback Jordan Talefili and pitched to Connole, who took care of the rest. \nOn CV’s second possession of the period, the Bears took a 17-0 lead when Sloan shoveled a pass to Braedon Orrino for a 21-yard TD. \nSloan had a case of the overthrows in the first half. He completed just one of his first 10 attempts, but rallied to finish 5 of 15 for 68 yards by halftime. He finished 12 of 24 for 170 and two TDs. \nConnole led CV on the ground with 87 yards on 14 carries and one TD. \nJonny Via led Ferris with 86 yards rushing. \n“We’ve got to get a good solid win next week and get into the playoffs on a high note,” said Giampietri, whose Bears finish regular-season play against in-district rival University. “It’s always been a tough game no matter what happens.” LIVE STREAMING", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T08:39:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T11:05:24.675+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
