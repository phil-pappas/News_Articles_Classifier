The $500 million project includes $250 million in taxpayer money, which will grow to $400 million after interest is paid on financing. State funding for the project irked Brown County taxpayers, who found themselves the sole contributors to the Green Bay Packers' 2003 renovation of Lambeau Field. \n\"These are all different roads (of financing). The end product is development and growth for the state,\" Feigin said. \nThe Bucks, who last year won their first playoff games in five years, have not captivated fans statewide as have the Packers or the Milwaukee Brewers. Feigin, who was named team president in October 2014, visited a Kohl's department store soon after accepting the Bucks job and found no team merchandise during the season. \n\"That's the worst of the worst,\" he said. \"They have Bucks merchandise now.\" \nFeigin said it's easy to show improvement because the team started at the bottom, in business and on the court. The key will be sustaining and continuing improvement. Winning, he said, will make a lot of things better. \n\"Nobody's saying 'I hate you guys.' It's more apathy,\" he said. \nThe Bucks see the Packers' Titletown District as a template for their arena project. The teams have been talking to one another and sharing best practices. \n\"Win, lose or tie, you're going back to Lambeau Field,\" he said. \"That's the kind of experience we want.\" 10-acre plaza heart of Titletown District \nThe Bucks opted to play their non-Milwaukee preseason home game in Madison this year instead of Green Bay, the team's long-standing alternate venue. He said the Bucks can play up to two home preseason games outside Milwaukee, and a return to Green Bay is possible, though he did not elaborate on what would be needed to make that happen. He said the team was pleased with the reception in Madison. \nHe promised $15 tickets would be available to Bucks games in the new arena, which the team hopes to open by 2017. \n\"The first eight rows pay for 90 percent of arena revenue. To not have affordable tickets is insane,\" he said. \"And there have to be free tickets. It's what we think about when we scale the bowl when we build this.\" \nThe Bucks made progress with an improved season and playoff appearance last year, by signing free agent Greg Monroe over the summer and by getting into Kohl's stores. \n\"We see tremendous growth, but what's sustainable. You have to have a strong foundation and a road map. I think we are on the right road,\" he said. \nrryman@greenbaypressgazette.com and follow him on Twitter @RichRymanPG or on Facebook at Richard Ryman-Press-Gazette.
