Jon Lester sprayed champagne with his young son. Rocker Eddie Vedder partied on the mound.\nFor the Chicago Cubs and their ever-hopeful fans, this bash was a long time in the making.\nKyle Schwarber, Anthony Rizzo and Javier Baez homered and the fresh Cubs clinched a postseason series at Wrigley Field for the first time ever, beating the St. Louis Cardinals 6-4 Tuesday to win the NL Division Series in four games.\n\"This is all just baseball fantasy, right?\" a drenched chairman Tom Ricketts said.\nOnly once since they last brought home the World Series in 1908 had the Cubs won a playoff series and never before had they finished off the job at their century-plus-old ballpark.\nBut with a raucous, towel-waving crowd jamming the Friendly Confines, the North Siders gave generations of fans exactly what they wanted. And as they gathered in the pulsating neighborhood, the lit-up marquee at Wrigley Field said it all: Cubs Win.\n\"I can only imagine what the next thing is going to look like,\" said Lester, the lefty who twice won the World Series with Boston. \"And the next thing after that.\"\nDODGERS FORCE GAME 5 WITH 3-1 WIN OVER METS\nNEW YORK &mdash; Clayton Kershaw finally came through in October, just in time to save the Los Angeles Dodgers from another early exit.\nPitching on short rest with the season on the line, Kershaw shut down the New York Mets for seven innings and Justin Turner delivered a key hit against his former team that sent the Dodgers to a 3-1 victory Tuesday night and forced the NL Division Series to a deciding Game 5.\nThe series shifts back to Los Angeles on Thursday night, with fellow Dodgers ace Zack Greinke scheduled to start against Jacob deGrom. The winner hosts the wild-card Chicago Cubs in the NL Championship Series opener Saturday.\nWith Chase Utley on the bench again, the Dodgers handed hometown Mets rookie Steven Matz his first loss in the major leagues.\nKershaw's one-out single led to a three-run third. Adrian Gonzalez looped an RBI single and Turner added a two-run double, providing enough support for the lefty ace.\nThe reigning NL MVP and three-time Cy Young Award winner snapped a five-start losing streak in the playoffs - the longest in Dodgers history.\nAfter dropping the series opener 3-1 to deGrom, Kershaw was 1-6 with a 4.99 ERA in 12 career postseason games, including nine starts. He had lost elimination games each of the past two years, once on three days' rest.", "external_links": ["http://www.adobe.com/go/getflashplayer", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/performgroup.js", "http://images.performgroup.com/namedImage/12637/install_flash.gif", "http://static.eplayer.performgroup.com/flash/js/swfobject.js"], "published": "2015-10-14T07:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-14T07:54:51.655+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
