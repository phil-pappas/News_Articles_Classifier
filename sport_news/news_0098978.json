Galaxy leaves Sounders alive for bye, but waiting to clinch Originally published October 18, 2015 at 7:18 pm Sounders FC fans got help in one way from the Portland Timbers’ win over the L.A. Galaxy, but still haven’t clinched an MLS playoff spot. By Matt Pentz Seattle Times staff reporter \nHOUSTON — How Sounders fans approached the out-of-town scoreboard these past few weeks has done more to divide the optimists from the pessimists than half a glass of water. \nWith Seattle still in the hunt for an automatic bye into the Western Conference semifinals while still scrapping just to reach the MLS playoffs, does one root for seeding or mere qualification? \nSunday’s Timbers-Galaxy nightcap, being played after Seattle’s 1-1 draw at Houston, was the latest example. \nA Los Angeles Galaxy win or draw would have condemned the Sounders to the play-in round by making a top-two finish impossible. But while Portland’s stunning 5-2 victory at the StubHub Center keeps Seattle in the running for a bye, it also dropped the Sounders down another rung in the standings.

San Jose lurks one point back. \nMost of Sunday’s matches will encourage the Sounders. Real Salt Lake has been eliminated from the playoffs, and also-rans Philadelphia and Chicago could not have looked less motivated in giving up four goals apiece on the road. \nAs the Timbers-Galaxy scoreline showed, though, in MLS, anything is possible. \n“You never assume anything,” Seattle coach Sigi Schmid said. “If you score two goals in the first four minutes and experiment with a forward playing right back, then you’re going to open yourself up. … A lot of it depends if they want to experiment or play with their best team.” Marshall returns \nSounders defender Chad Marshall played all 90 minutes of Sunday’s draw in Houston, completing his remarkable recovery after leaving Starfire Sports Complex in an ambulance with a neck strain two weeks ago. \nThough Marshall conceded that his neck was a bit stiff, he said he didn’t hesitate in rising up for headers or going in strong with tackles. \n“Solid once again,” Evans said when asked of Marshall’s performance. “Winning every aerial duel. Battling, sliding, tackling and passing out of the back. It was your standard Chad Marshall performance.” RSL’s Valdez may return \nSounders Marco Pappa, Oniel Fisher and Nelson Valdez all missed Sunday’s game due to injury. Valdez’s absence forced Erik Friberg out to the wing, where he rarely looked comfortable. \nSchmid said he’s hopeful that Valdez will recover from his recent calf injury in time for next Sunday’s regular-season finale. \n“That wasn’t his natural position, for sure,” Schmid said of Friberg. “It’s not necessarily Valdez’s natural position, either, but he’s more comfortable than Friberg is, so I think that helps us.” Matt Pentz: 206-464-3184 or mpentz@seattletimes.com .
