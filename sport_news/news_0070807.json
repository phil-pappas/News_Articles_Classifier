He already has committed to play football at Louisville next fall.\n\nSeth has the distinction of being the last in a line of Dawkins family members who left their mark at the school.\n\nThe patriarch is Anthony “Bernie” Dawkins, who was a football standout in the early 1970s and went on to play at Louisville. The mother, DuBonna (Moseley) Dawkins was a track star at Eastmoor and Ohio State.\n\nTheir daughters, Antwana, Hauna and Alanna, all had accomplished track careers at Franklin Heights, specializing in sprints, hurdles and long jump. Antwana went on to compete at Youngstown State, Hauna at Cincinnati and Alanna at Marshall. \n\nAlthough Hauna is the most decorated of the four siblings with a state championship in the 300-meter hurdles and numerous all-Ohio honors, her “little brother” is doing his part to hold up the legacy.\n\nSeth is winding down his career with a sensational senior season. Through eight games, he has 54 receptions for 814 yards (15.1-yard average) and has scored 17 touchdowns. He also excels as a hybrid strong safety/outside linebacker, as well as a return specialist.\n\n“Except for the won-loss record, it’s going about as planned,” Dawkins said. “I really don’t keep up on stats.\n\n“We haven’t had a lot of success in my time here, and I had given some thought to going elsewhere, but when coach (Tennyson Varney) came in (in 2014), I got a great feeling about things. I’ve got strong ties to this place. Even though our record doesn’t show it, we’ve played better football here this year than we have in several years.”\n\nFranklin Heights is 0-8 only because it forfeited three wins due to an administrative error regarding an out-of-state transfer. The Falcons had beaten Mount Vernon (5-3) and Harvest Prep (6-2) and took Worthington Kilbourne (7-1) to overtime before falling 34-28.\n\nVarney said some college recruiters and area observers were late to notice Dawkins’ skills because he often played out of position early in his career and because Franklin Heights is hardly recognized as a football hotbed.\n\n“The first time I saw him, he was dunking a basketball in the gym, and I could tell right away what a specimen he was,” Varney said. “I came to learn what a phenomenal kid he was. … very humble, from a great household and background. His father is really stern. I pushed as hard as I possibly could to get Seth recruited and when Toledo came out to practice and offered him on the spot, it really got the ball rolling.”\n\nAble to run 40 yards in 4.5 seconds and with incredible leaping ability, Dawkins jumps off a highlight reel. He also plays basketball and was Division I regional long jump champion and seventh in the state in June.\n\nNine of Dawkins’ touchdowns have gone 35 yards or longer. He has scored on two runs and two kickoffs.\n\n“The thing about it is, it’s not like we’re throwing jump balls to him,” Varney said. “A lot of his big plays have come on screens and hitch plays that he has made great moves on and taken to the house. And he’s absolutely electric on kickoff returns. Hardly anyone kicks to him anymore.”\n\nDawkins insists that his father had little influence on his commitment to Louisville, adding that he plans to take his remaining four visits “just to be sure that it’s the perfect place.”\n\n“They came at me hard right from the beginning,” he said. “I like their offensive scheme, and the atmosphere there is really appealing to me. The place is really down to earth, and I already know people there.”\n\nsblackledge@dispatch.com \n\n@BlackiePreps", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-23T01:18:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-23T06:30:17.048+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
