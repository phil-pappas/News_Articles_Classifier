Gallop said the Phoenix application for a 10-year extension \"does not meet the requirements we see as fundamental to the future growth of the A-League.\" \nLocal media reports suggest Wellington's place may be offered to a third Sydney-based team. \nAll content copyright ©2015 Pendleton Times-Post, a division of Home News Enterprises unless otherwise noted.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-26T14:25:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T15:52:56.744+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
