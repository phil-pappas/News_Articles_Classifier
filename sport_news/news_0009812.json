The St. Bernard-Norwich Tech program that had won just two games in the last three seasons was adding Grasso Tech to expand to a tri-op, the program was being renamed the Thames River Crusaders, the home games were leaving St. Bernard and the Crusaders were going to switch conferences. “A lot of us were very hesitant about playing again,” Casillas said. That’s adversity. So when Quinebaug Valley unexpectedly tied Thames River’s Senior Day game late in the fourth quarter Saturday on a fumble return touchdown, Thames River coach Sean Ladyga knew his players could handle it. “We’ve faced enough adversity over the years that we’ve learned to let go,” Ladyga said. That’s exactly what the Crusaders did. Casillas, along with quarterback Jared Neal and running back Thurston Brown, had Thames River back in the end zone seven plays after the fumble return and Thames River added another score on its next drive to seal a 36-22 victory. The Crusaders, who moved to the Constitution State Conference this season, picked up their third victory, more than they had in the previous three years combined in the Eastern Connecticut Conference. Thames River (3-3) was in complete control with a little more than 5 minutes to play when a punt went horribly wrong. The snap sailed over the head of Jake Sulik and Sebastian Ruiz scooped it up at the Thames River 22-yard line and jogged the rest of the way to the end zone. Jeremee Perez (22 rushes, 137 yards), who scored a pair of first-half touchdowns, tied the game at 22 with a 2-point conversion. “I just had to take my team to the side and let them know that we have to win this game,” said Neal, who had already thrown three touchdown passes. The quarterback hit Casillas with an 18-yard pass and then ran the read-option with Brown for the final six plays of the drive before Brown (20 rushes, 110 yards) put Thames River ahead for good on a 7-yard run. “He was hot, so I just kept feeding him and feeding him,” Neal said. The Pride (3-3, 2-3) drove all the way down to the Thames River 34-yard line with less than 2 minutes remaining before Casillas jumped in front of a Chuck Innes pass down the left sideline for his second interception of the game. When Neal sealed the win on the next drive by diving into the end zone on a 4-yard run, Casillas yelled and pumped his fist in front of the end zone. Page 2 of 2 - “I have love for everybody on my team, so whenever they score, I honestly feel better than me scoring,” Casillas said. “I’m getting excited for them because I know that they put in work just like I did.” It took 2 minutes, 5 seconds for Thames River to respond to Quinebaug Valley’s fumble return and another 2:39 to put the game out of reach. “In situations like that, with the team and makeup we have this year, we are able to get on the field and start over because we have so much confidence in how we can move the football and in our athletes … we don’t stress about it,” Ladyga said. Thames River was in trouble at the start of the fourth quarter. With the game tied at 14, the Crusaders faced a fourth-and-5 on the first play of the fourth, but the Pride bailed them out by jumping offside to keep the drive going. After Neal (10-for-19, 169 yards) connected with Tommy Simone Jr. on a 16-yard TD pass, more penalties — personal foul, ineligible man downfield, block in the back — drained the life out of the next two Quinebaug Valley drives. “We lead the league in penalties right now,” Quinebaug Valley coach Joe Asermelly said. “It’s a poor reflection, I’m not doing a good enough job. Penalties are a reflection on the coach. My team’s not composed, they’re not playing with good technique and discipline, so I’ve got to do a better of getting us prepared for those situations.” By Brett Poirier The Bulletin The Bulletin By Brett Poirier The Bulletin Posted Oct. 24, 2015 at 8:04 PM", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-25T03:04:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-25T02:17:41.948+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
