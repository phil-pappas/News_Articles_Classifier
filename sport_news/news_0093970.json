We've had a decent week of practice, and we're getting some kids back from injury, and hopefully we'll have our heads screwed on straight and play well.\" \nIn their three losses, two of those were by less than a touchdown. \nSenior Dalton Frasure said since then, his team has focused in on finishing games strong. \n\"We want to win every game, but we're getting better each week, especially since the Pikeville week. We've improved every week and that's the main thing we wanted to do. This week's big, anything can happen if we win. If we can do it then anything is possible.\" Said Frasure. \nWhile Prestonsburg presents a balanced attack on offense, what makes Leslie County tough is their size. \n\"They're a physical football team. They've got a really good quarterback, a huge line, they've got a good set of running backs. They give you kind of a two-headed attack. They'll run the ball and throw the ball, so you can't load up against the run or the pass and Coach Melton does a great job. They're good in all three phases of the game. So, you've got to prepare really well to play, to be on the field with a team like Leslie County. \" Said Coach Derossett. \nThe Blackcats will get their chance to hand the last undefeated team in Class 2A their first loss of the season Friday on their home field.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-08T07:51:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-08T08:13:32.110+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
