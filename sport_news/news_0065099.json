Haden wasn't specific about the reasons for Sarkisian's absence, only saying that \"it was very clear to me that he is not healthy.\"\nSome players who knew Sarkisian at Washington spoke to the Times on the condition they not be named because of the personal nature of the issue.\nFrom the Times report:\nOne ex-player said that in 2009, Sarkisian's first season with the Huskies, the coach sometimes arrived at morning team meetings \"smelling like booze and [with] eyes all red, like he's been on a bender.\"\nAnother former player said he smelled alcohol on Sarkisian during team meetings on \"one or two\" occasions and, other times, noted that the coach's eyes appeared to be bloodshot and glazed while he seemed unusually confrontational.\nTwo other former players said Sarkisian and other coaches regularly consumed alcohol in offices — one said the coach typically kept an 18-pack of Coors Light stashed near his desk — and that he appeared uncharacteristically loud and unsteady on some team flights.\n►In 2011, Sarkisian picked up a bill at Suncadia Resort in Cle Elum, Wash., that included 83 beers and 12 shots of Grey Goose vodka. Twenty Washington coaches and their spouses are listed as attending.\n►During a one-night stay at the JW Marriott at L.A. Live in May 2011 for a speaking engagement, Sarkisian's hotel folio shows room service delivered a $90 bottle of Veuve Clicquot champagne and a chocolate amenity, then six beers.\n►At the Arizona Biltmore in Phoenix for a Pac-12 Conference head coach meetings, Sarkisian ran up $106 in minibar charges in one day in May 2012 and spent more than $1,600 over two days at the Renaissance Indian Wells Resort and Spa's pool bar in 2013.\n►Two receipts from Washington retreats in Indian Wells in 2012 and 2013 showed Sarkisian expensed $1,023 worth of alcohol at a restaurant. That included 91 shots of tequila, much of it Patron Silver. At least 16 people attended one of the gatherings; the attendance for the other wasn't clear.\nUSA TODAY\nUSC coach Steve Sarkisian asked to take leave of absence\nFollowing the incident in August that drew a reprimand from Haden, Sarkisian said he had inadvertently mixed alcohol with medication. Sarkisian said he would seek some type of treatment but said he did not believe he had an alcohol problem. He also said he would not drink for the rest of the football season.\nMORE: Nancy Armour's August column when she said USC should get Sarkisian help immediately\nSome of Sarkisian's former players at Washington did not seem surprised after that incident. From the Times report:\n\"Coach Sark is still having fun at USC!\" former Huskies tight end Michael Hartvigson wrote on Twitter at the time. He added the hashtag #ThingsHaventChanged.\nTwo of Sarkisian's highest-profile players at Washington, defensive lineman Danny Shelton and linebacker Shaq Thompson, both high NFL draft picks this year, joined in the social media quips.\nShelton tweeted a sarcastic #shocked hashtag in reference to the incident. Thompson responded with an emoji laughing and shedding tears.\n\"I would've made him run the stadium carrying a 6 pack since he wanna drink so much lol,\" Shelton tweeted.\nOffensive coordinator Clay Helton will take over as interim head coach. Helton is in his second stint as USC's interim coach. He led the Trojans to a Las Vegas Bowl victory in 2013, a calendar year in which the Trojans had four different head coaches.\n\"(It was) clear the team had a great deal of concern about the health of Coach Sarkisian,\" Haden said. \"So did the staff have that concern for him, and it was also very apparent to me in the room of the support that Clay has from our team and his staff.\"", "external_links": ["http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/pac12/2015/10/11/steve-sarkisian-usc-trojans-football-coach-leave-of-absence-pat-haden/73791620/", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6ca3ac0d6f6953176cb808fea8e5bee9c20e8075/c=0-167-4047-2453&r=x1683&c=3200x1680/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801890523574035-C03-HADEN-LEFT-01-71318926.JPG", "http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/pac12/2015/10/11/usc-coach-steve-sarkisian-leave-of-absence-pat-haden/73787066/", "http://www.latimes.com/sports/usc/la-sp-usc-sarkisian-washington-20151012-story.html", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/d8718ea3216d82203601eba3912512b84c022c59/c=0-520-2852-3372/local/-/media/2015/10/11/USATODAY/USATODAY/635801805757622667-USP-NCAA-Football-Washington-at-Southern-Californ.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-12T17:13:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-12T22:56:54.707+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
