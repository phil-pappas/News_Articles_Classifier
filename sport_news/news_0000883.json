He loved the sports, he liked the kids and he was always good to be around.” \nKudajeski, who was born in 1934, was also a teacher at the school and served as a PIAA official for baseball, football and basketball. \nKudajeski’s contributions to coaching and officiating earned him many accolades over the years, including an induction into the Chic Feldman Scranton Area Sports Hall of Fame. \nContact the writer: \nshennigan@timesshamrock.com We welcome user discussion on our site, under the following guidelines: To comment you must first create a profile and sign-in with a verified DISQUS account or social network ID.
