In August, he earned medalist honors at a quadrangular. \nThis season has had a couple hiccups for the Cedar Rapids Washington junior, but he will look to make them distant memories, returning to Finkbine Tuesday for a Class 4A district meet hosted by Iowa City West. Play is scheduled to start at 9:30 a.m. \nThe season opened with his score not even counting for the Warriors’ Mississippi Valley Conference Super Meet title. He rebounded with breaking 70 in two meets that followed. He said he hasn’t golfed as well as he would like, but the ups and downs are just part of golf’s fickle ways. \n“I think a lot can be attributed to the overall nature of golf,” said Lindwall, trying to return to the state meet for the first time since tying for 10th there as a freshman in 2013. “You have good days. You have bad days. You have good stretches. You have bad stretches. Hopefully, I can put that behind and play well at district, and help out our team to get to state.” \nLindwall still captured MVC divisional Golfer of the Year honors for the second straight year. He also holds the area’s best 18-hole average (72.71) and lowest 18-hole round (68). Lindwall had some putting issues the last month, but he said most of his problems were in his head. \n“My mental game was a little off,” Lindwall said. “I haven’t been playing well over the last month, but I’m still working at it. I’m really excited for district. I think I’m pretty close. Hopefully, I can get back to playing the way I was before school started.” \nLindwall has a strong support network to help him overcome his negativity at times on the course. He relies on his father, Clay Lindwall, who stresses the importance of a positive mental attitude. Larry Gladson, the golf professional at Elmcrest Country Club, provides advice and his Warrior teammates help as well, pulling him through rough stretches. \n“I have pretty high expectations of myself,” Lindwall said. “I had a pretty good summer and was playing well, so obviously you’re disappointed when you don’t play as well as you like.” \nWashington’s team hasn’t faced much disappointment overall. The Warriors swept their divisional meets and captured the CRANDIC title. They are looking to get back to state, qualifying in 2013. All but one varsity golfer averages less than 80, including Logan Bracey (76.0) and Connor Neighbors (78.71). Jabe Gonder comes in at 79.0, while Alex and Joe Slattery both average, 79.33. \n“It’s awesome,” Lindwall said. “Our depth is phenomenal. \n“We have six guys who can all contribute to be our best score. I think that is what makes our team special this year.” \nThe field includes Burlington, Cedar Falls, Cedar Rapids Jefferson, Cedar Rapids Kennedy, Cedar Rapids Prairie, Cedar Rapids Xavier, Iowa City High, Muscatine, Ottumwa and both Waterloo public schools. \nThe top three teams and top four individuals, including fourth-place ties, advance to the state meet Friday and Saturday at Elmcrest Country Club in Cedar Rapids. \nLinn-Mar qualified for the state meet Monday, winning the district at Palmer Hills Golf Course in Bettendorf. The Lions will make their second straight trip, firing a 297. Max Thrune led Linn-Mar, carding a 2-under 70. The Lions’ Jack Recker shot 73 and won a sudden-death playoff for runner-up honors. Western Dubuque’s Jack O’Hea also had a 73 and finished fourth to earn a state berth. \nl Comments: (319) 368-8679; kj.pilcher@thegazette.com Your Next Articles", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T00:43:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T19:07:23.134+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
