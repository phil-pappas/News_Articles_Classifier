Then the Red Devils had to rally around Graves’ absence in the second half. Graves tied the single-season state record for kick return touchdowns in a season with his fifth, then missed the second half with an ankle injury while the Red Devils pulled together for a 37-33 victory in Mid-State 2-A Conference action against visiting Jordan-Matthews on Friday night. “The feeling in the locker room was basically like, ‘We’ve got to step up, next man up,’” said senior quarterback Jamie Newman, who ran for two third-quarter touchdowns that proved to be the deciding scores. “Graves is probably one of the hardest kids to ever tackle or play against, we’ve just got to fill in that spot like he never left.” Newman’s 6-yard blast on the opening drive of the second half gave Graham (2-6 overall, 1-1 Mid-State 3-A Conference) a 31-27 lead, and his surging 10-yard burst provided a cushion with 14 seconds left in the third quarter. Jordan-Matthews (2-6, 1-1) got to within one score on Rahman Mateen’s 4-yard touchdown run with 7:30 left. Graham burned the clock on the next possession, with Newman and Graves’ backfield replacement, Taymond Reed, plowing through defenders. When Graham finally had to punt, the Red Devils pinned the Jets on their own 10-yard line with 1:10 left. Jordan-Matthews advanced the ball to their 41 before sputtering to end the game. “I think this is going to bring us together, make us closer as a unit and bring us tighter as one,” said Newman, who finished with three rushing touchdowns and threw a 15-yard touchdown to Jordan Falls. Graham’s early hole was 21-7 after Trajan Glover capped Jordan-Matthews’ third drive with his third touchdown run with 8:05 left in the second quarter. The ensuing kickoff was rolling toward the goal line when Graves picked it up, his heels on the 1-yard line. The senior created magic with a dancing, juking, 99-yard touchdown along the home sideline, injecting life into this homecoming crowd. A three-and-out for Jordan-Matthews was followed by Newman’s touchdown pass to Falls, tying the game at 21-21. Markell Day recovered a Jordan-Matthews fumble on the next offensive play, and William Martin’s 31-yard field goal gave Graham its first lead. It was short-lived, with the Jets scoring on Rahim Mateen’s 4-yard run with 27 seconds left before halftime. The situation worsened for Graham when Graves went down with a right ankle injury on the kickoff. He was carted off the field and didn’t play in the second half. The North Carolina Central commit entered the game having scored 19 of Graham’s 22 touchdowns this season. Page 2 of 2 - “The guys really rallied behind him,” Graham coach Anthony Timmons said. “Our guys have the mentality of ‘next man up.’ And it’s about protecting your brother. Daniel went down, we’re lifting him up in prayer and from what I understand he’ll be back with us next week.” Glover led Jordan-Matthews with 132 yards, 104 of which came in the first half. The Jets outgained Graham 262-91 in offensive yardage in the first half, but the Red Devils defense measured up better in the second half. “We switched out of our defense and switched into another one. Manned up and started hitting,” senior linebacker Taymond Reed said.
