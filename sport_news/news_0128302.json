It was the Swiss attorney general who first disclosed details of the \"disloyal payment\" by Blatter after questioning him as a suspect following a surprise swoop on his office inside FIFA's sleek headquarters. \nThe presidency is being held temporarily by Africa's soccer president, Issa Hayatou, a Cameroonian who requires regular dialysis treatment and was reprimanded himself in 2011 by the IOC over a FIFA kickbacks scandal. Hayatou was expected at the Zurich headquarters this week, but his power is heavily restricted as lawyers oversee FIFA's workings and the criminal investigations escalate. \nPlatini and Blatter strongly deny any wrongdoing. Platini is appealing to get the provisional suspension overturned so that he can run Europe's soccer federation and campaign to replace Blatter in an emergency election on Feb. 26. \nBut the provisional ban could derail Platini's hopes. The FIFA executive committee meets on Oct. 20, and could postpone the election date, but if the February poll goes ahead, each candidate will have to pass an \"integrity check\" by FIFA's election committee. \nWhatever the terms of Blatter's previously secret payment to Platini, FIFA investigators apparently considered it damning enough to banish both men from the game pending the full inquiry. \nFor now, Platini seems to retain UEFA's backing going into an emergency meeting of the executive committee and all 54 member nations on Thursday. \nBut executive committee member Allan Hansen broke ranks on Monday to tell Danish newspaper Ekstra Bladet that if there was no written contract for the disputed payment \"we can no longer support him.\" \nAs a silky French playmaker, Platini was revered as the star of 1980s European soccer, winning titles for club and country and collecting the top personal accolades. \nThen the former France captain took a seemingly fateful decision to immerse himself into the murky, often overtly corrupt, world of global soccer politics, helping Blatter to first get elected in 1998 and then working alongside him until 2002. \nContractually, Platini was to be paid 300,000 Swiss francs per year for this advisory job, traveling the globe as Blatter mentored him in the deal making required to establish a powerbase. The Frenchman received 1.05 million Swiss francs for 3 1/2 years of work, the person familiar with the FIFA ethics case said. \nThe criminal and FIFA ethics investigations center on an additional 500,000 Swiss francs per year that Platini said they agreed to defer until FIFA could afford it. This promise - and the payment Blatter approved in 2011, when Platini was supporting Blatter's re-election, were based on nothing more than verbal agreements, the person familiar with the case said. \nUnder Swiss law, Platini should have called in the debt within five years. It is unclear how Platini would have reclaimed the debt had Blatter no longer been living, or working for FIFA. \nPlatini said two weeks ago that he was not paid \"the totality of my salary because of FIFA's financial situation at that time.\" \nFIFA's accounts for 1999-2002 show a revenue surplus of 115 million Swiss francs. \nPlatini was first elected UEFA president in 2007 to rule over the game's richest clubs - from Barcelona to Manchester United - and its biggest club competition - the Champions League. \nUEFA rebuffed AP's requests to ask Platini to provide a contract showing FIFA owed him the 2 million Swiss francs. Some soccer nations also are questioning Platini's limited public explanation. \nPlatini feels \"he has given satisfactory explanations to the authorities that are dealing with this case,\" UEFA said last week. \nControversy has surrounded the votes in 2010 by Blatter, Platini and other committee members to name Russia as host of the 2018 World Cup and Qatar to host the 2022 event. \nAnother World Cup voter, Thai soccer association president Worawi Makudi, also was suspended from the game Monday for 90 days pending a full examination. No reason for Makudi's suspension was given by the ethics committee, due to secrecy restrictions upheld by Blatter's ruling committee last month, but he had been under investigation following a probe into the World Cup bidding process. \n___ \nFollow Rob Harris at www.twitter.com/RobHarris and www.facebook.com/RobHarrisReports Copyright 2015 The Associated Press.
