(AP Photo/Alex Gallardo) You might think that receiving the most All-Star votes, winning the three-point shootout, being the top jersey-seller, being voted NBA MVP and winning the league championship would be God’s way of telling you, “You’ve reached the top! Chill!”\nAdChoices That’s not how Stephen Curry read it.\n“Nah, I’ve always felt I could do more and get better,” Curry told me recently. “Look at the history of the league. Obviously, it’s great to win one MVP and one championship and all that, but the guys that are most memorable have done it many, many times, so we’ve got some work to do.”\nSo work he did. Curry said it’s hard to quantify the results of his offseason training. No 400-pound bench-press to brag about, but...\n“I got stronger. I got more efficient, I think more explosive. I’m not going to be like Russell Westbrook out there, but in my own way, I can find ways to create space and do it more efficiently. You’ll see a lot of that. I got a lot of reps in and worked on my lower-body strength, too, to get through another 82-game schedule and the playoffs, so I should be ready.”\nCurry added: “Kind of subjective eye test of how much ground can I cover in one step, or one step back, or one dribble, that kind of stuff. I definitely made improvements. Not like I could jump 18 inches (before) and now I can do 24. It’s more just, how quick you are with the ball, and how you’re able to get out and move and be able to create enough space. I can definitely tell the difference.”\nDon’t expect Curry to close the dunk gap on Westbrook, the crazy-athletic Thunder guard. Curry had four dunks last season. Westbrook threw down 48.\n“Nah, we didn’t really work on the vertical aspect,” Curry said. “It’s more horizontal stuff.”\nCurry could write a book: “Don’t Sweat the Vertical Stuff.”\nThere have been a million distractions for the Warriors and especially for their point guard, and here comes the season, but you get the feeling it’s not going to sneak up on Steph Curry.\nGo to MSN Home", "external_links": ["http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=286759"], "published": "2015-10-25T02:00:00.000+02:00", "crawled": "2015-10-26T18:49:06.164+02:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
