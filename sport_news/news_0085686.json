Chris Trotman Updated Oct 12, 2015 at 4:43p ET \nWhen NASCAR returns to Las Vegas Motor Speedway in March 2016, drivers will not have to worry about hitting an unprotected concrete wall like Austin Theriault in last weekend's Camping World Truck Series race. \nJeff Motley, vice president of public relations for the speedway, confirmed to FOXSports.com Monday afternoon the track would have SAFER barriers installed in that area by next March. Motley indicated that plan was already in place before Theriault's Oct. 3 incident. \nIn addition to the SAFER barriers, LVMS will also have a number of fan enhancements when the series returns at the beginning of the 2016 season. Work on those enhancements also began prior to last weekend's Camping World Truck Series race. \nThe improvements include a new VIP hospitality area overlooking Turn 4 called the Vegas Veranda. A new luxury RV area will also be located next to the Vegas Veranda on Turn 4. The 25 luxury RV spaces will be called the Vegas Village, feature a concierge service, WiFi and more. Austin Theriault thankful injuries from Las Vegas Truck incident not worse \n\"These new VIP areas will be a luxurious way for some fans to enjoy the race, but these new areas also give way to some exciting new opportunities for all of our race fans,\" track president Chris Powell said. \"We are working on some very unique experiences in our Fan Engagement Area and are looking forward to the arrival of the new Fanatics Trackside Superstore. We raised the bar in 2007 when we built the Neon Garage, and with these enhancements, we feel that we are raising it even higher.\" \nAccording to a report by the Las Vegas Review-Journal , 15,000 seats in the Turn 4 area are being removed to make way for the two new amenities. With the Turn 4 seats being removed, all of the permanent seats at the 1.5-mile speedway will have a view of pit road and the start-finish line.", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-12T23:30:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-13T00:01:19.940+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
