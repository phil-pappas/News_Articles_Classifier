The homecoming game was originally slated for Oct. 2, but deteriorating conditions prompted school officials to move the game up a day. \nAll 47 of the Vikings' points came in the first half, and a second-half running clock shortened the contest and got players, coaches and fans under cover sooner. \n\"We looked at the schedule and, to be honest, we knew we had to beat Indian River and Polytech to have any chance at a winning season,\" said coach Bill Collick. \"We were on the wrong end of the game against Oakdale, so going into game five at 3-1, we have yet to play a four-quarter game. I'm sure that will change starting Friday night at Central.\" \nWith the win, Cape improves to 3-1 on the season. The Vikings will next play at Sussex Central for the Golden Knights' homecoming game at noon, Saturday, Oct. 10, a game that was originally slated for Oct. 9. \nCape has unleashed a four-prong running attack over the last two games featuring fullbacks Mike Williams and Kolbi Wright, and halfbacks Rasheed Woods and Jeremiah Smack. Quarterback Dillon Adams has been efficient, and tight end Brent Reed, 6-foot-6 and 230 pounds, has made some big catches. \nSussex Central is hosting undefeated Sussex Tech Monday, Oct. 5, in a game rescheduled from Oct. 2. \nScoring summary \nC - Smack 5-yard run, kick failed \nC - Wright 12-yard run, Smack run \nC - Woods 43-yard run, Carey kick \nC - Wright 15-yard run, kick failed \nC - Woods 38-yard run, run failed \nC - Woods 39-yard run, Geppert kick \nC - Smack 30-yard fumble recovery, Geppert kick Cape's Rasheed Woods finds some open space and runs for a big gain as the rain falls.
