In the Aggies’ Homecoming game against Colorado State, the schools will not only be competing for points, but fans will also be competing in pounds of material diverted through recycling, composting and food donations versus the amount thrown away in the stadium and tailgate areas. Fans are encouraged to show their Aggie spirit by using the Pepsi recycling bins and re-using their commemorative cups.
