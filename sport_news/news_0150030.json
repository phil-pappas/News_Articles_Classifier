Harding struck back quickly, however. \nTitus Douglas ran in from 19 yards and the extra point kick from Savion Tyler put Harding ahead 7-6 after one quarter. \nA sluggish second quarter changed abruptly. \nHarding quarterback Ryan Sayre hit T.J. Jefferson with a bubble screen pass and the 135-pound wideout did the rest, going 61 yards for the tying score.Tyler's kick gave Harding a 14-13 halftime lead. \nHawkins said his team had chances last week but took better advantage of opportunities this week. \n\"After that fourth-and-eight reception, I thought, 'Come on, defense.' They stepped it up.\" \nThe second half featured several big plays. \nJacob Fryer rambled 36 yards for a Galion score giving his club a 19-14 lead with 6:43 to go in the third period. \nBut the Presidents answered. \nHarding moved the ball through the air and on the ground, with Keyan Herrell going in from the 2-yard-line. That knotted the score at 21. \n\"I thought after we got that fumble recovery, that we were going to take it down and score, but penalties killed us,\" Hawkins said. \nGalion was flagged seven times for 75 yards in penalties to Harding's four for 30 yards. \nThe game was ultimately decided off the foot of Galion's Conner Moreton, who nailed a 35-yard field goal with 7:15 to play in the game. \nHarding didn't quit, even after Ryan Talbott's fumble recovery of a mishandled ball. \nSayre drove his team with passes of 15 and 16 yards to Jefferson, but the Presidents' second lost fumble of the game ended it with 2:08 to play. \nOn the night he completed 10-of-12 passes for 142 yards. Douglas ran the ball 16 times for 102 yards; Jefferson had four catches for 97 yards. \nChase Cooke connected on 6 of 12 passes for 64 yards for the Tigers. \nWorkhouse Barnett carried the ball 32 times for 161 yards, with Fryer adding 96 yards on 10 carries. \nHawkins credited Harding with improvement despite the tough loss. \n\"Marion has come a long way and are headed in the right direction. They have some athletes,\" Hawkins said. \n\"I'm very proud of our defense because they haven't stepped it up to seal a game the last two times, so it was so nice to see that tonight.\" \naconchel@gannett.com", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-03T06:04:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-03T11:01:45.156+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
