It was a well-designed play but, in the end, relied on the quickness, cutting ability and power of Lewis to get in the end zone.\nLet's take a closer look at the Dion Lewis catch-and-run for a 10-yard score in the third quarter that pushed the Pats ahead, 20-3.\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 First note the 3-2-6 defensive alignment Belichick talked about after the game. The Cowboys run it here. pic.twitter.com/JEblIauDOf\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 Note Gronkowski's position for now and how he will later help force the numbers in the Pats' favor on the other side pic.twitter.com/Kp87TY86Hq\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 Edelman motions, drawing his man to the other side along with the eyes of the safeties, LBs, who have to respect it. pic.twitter.com/mfWU4nvdyF\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 A lot happens once the ball is snapped. What essentially transpires is a screen play with no linemen keying it off. pic.twitter.com/r8C5vh7Z8s\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 Notice first how every lineman goes one way. The only \"blocking\" for Lewis is a \"pick\" set by Amendola. Since Lewis is behind the LOS...\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 a player can block downfield if Lewis is still behind the LOS. Amendola does not.\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 He does draw in his man, however, essentially sending two players off in the wrong direction.\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 Notice also Gronkowski at the top of the screen. He is double-covered and the safety had to respect both Edelman and Gronk there, so...\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 he's leaning the wrong way, too. There's only 1 player out of 10 who isn't either on the wrong side of the field or caught looking that way\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 This only lasts about a second, though, as this is what awaits Lewis once he catches the ball with one hand due to a pic.twitter.com/Y0MM720lg1\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 Brady throw that forced him to turn around. Note how much room there is on the sidelines. That's where most backs go in this situation.\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 Brady throw that forced him to turn around.

This is where it gets ridiculous.\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 After that cut, this is where Lewis is. He uses his height to his advantage to duck out of the next tackle attempt. pic.twitter.com/Qauw1LkEAV\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 Now, Lewis has to fight through for three more yards, and most of his work is done. pic.twitter.com/0C9WlHkbaQ\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 He takes the hit at the 2-yard line and uses the force of it to pinball forward into the end zone. pic.twitter.com/QvxAN3UKYO\n— Adam Kurkjian (@AdamKurkjian) October 12, 2015 This is all power, basically.
