But coach Jim Foster said 6'-5\" Ashlyn DeWert offers them a power game. Foster noted 6'-3\" Ansley Chilton of Trenton, Georgia is a very improved player.Add to that All-League transfer Queen Alford from Jacksonville University and the return of Arryana Gilbert, who's back from her season ending injury last season.Coach Foster likes the chemistry and outlook for this season. \"We're going to be deeper. And I think this team right now, I don't know how many we're going to play. We'll try to play as many as we can because we can because as long as they share the ball and we move it and we're interchangeable in our parts, we should be able to get away with playing a significant amount of players.\" Mocs Women's Basketball Team Will Rotate Three Centers This Season Related Stories", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-06T01:22:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T09:25:35.473+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
