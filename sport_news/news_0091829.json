Never before has a tournament that includes Men 7s, Women 7s, Boys 7s and an international match been held.' \nThe festival will kick off at 9am with a Men 7s tournament between Championship League clubs that will include teams such as Griffons from Cape Coast, Cosmos Buffaloes, Idas, Dansoman Hurricanes, Legon Titans, Accra Sharks and Tema Anchors. \n'In discussions between myself and the president of the Togo Rugby Federation, Modeste Akassan, we came to the conclusion that it is essential for Rugby development in the region that regional Rugby Unions work much closer together to promote and develop Rugby. The friendly international on Saturday is a first small step towards achieving that objective and I hope it will be the beginning of much greater things to come,' Mr Mensah said. \nIn 2014 /15 Ghana Rugby successfully concluded its first professional Ghana Rugby Club Championship (GRCC) where ten teams competed on a home-and-away round-robin basis. \nCosmos Buffaloes won the championship trophy in an exciting final with Legon Titans. \nThe 2015/16 Ghana Rugby Club Championship is scheduled to be played between November 2015 and February 2016.
