According to his coach Duke Roufus, Brooks \"tweaked\" his shoulder during a scramble in training at the Roufusport Academy in Milwaukee, Wis.\nThe injury has sidelined Punk for several weeks. He's scheduled to meet with a physician in a little over a week to see if he will be cleared to return. Roufus admits he will not allow Brooks to get back into training until he's \"101 percent.\" Currently, he feels that he's at \"50 percent.\"\nRoufus also shed some light on when he thinks we could see Punk in the Octagon. \"The UFC will probably book him a fight three to four months in advance -- a guy of his magnitude,\" he said. \"We're probably looking at a fight in the next six to 10 months.\" For now, Roufus believes the shoulder issue may have set them back just one month, but they won't know for certain until he is fully capable of getting back into action.\n[via ESPN ]", "external_links": ["http://espn.go.com/mma/story/_/id/13818152/cm-punk-ufc-debut-postponed-shoulder-injury"], "published": "2015-10-06T07:09:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-06T12:29:28.880+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
