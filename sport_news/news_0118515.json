That's why Menlo-Atherton senior Bryce Rodgers, a lineman on the football team, was allowed to play the moment he enrolled two years ago after leaving Southern California following his freshman year. \n\"The football team was very inviting to me,\" Rodgers said. \"So by the time school started, I already knew a lot of the people. They showed me around with tours of school, so it didn't take me that long to get comfortable.\" \nBefore the 2012-13 scholastic year, when the amended transfer bylaw went into effect, only first-time transfers prior to their sophomore year weren't forced to miss an entire season without a change of address, unless a hardship applied. Advertisement \n\"Hardships are designated categories in the CIF rules that are documented by court papers or some kind of paperwork that causes a student to transfer,\" said Filios, who noted the CCS denied eight transfers for athletic reasons last year, with all of them ending up in front of an appeals panel appointed by the state office. (Six of the determinations were upheld, with two overturned after new evidence.) \nAlso important, students must be academically eligible and without dismissal for disciplinary reasons from their previous school. Examples of hardships range from a divorce to a school closure or board of education ruling, even moving in with your spouse after marriage. \n\"It's rare, very rare,\" Filios said of the latter. \"I don't think I've seen one in my eight years.\" Waiting their turns Two local examples of student-athletes affected by the sit-out period are M-A quarterback Miles Conrad and Nadia Paquin, who plays club water polo at Stanford and left one Atherton school for another with a transfer from M-A to Sacred Heart Prep. Both are sophomores with limited eligibility, which means they can play at the junior varsity level. But doing so wipes away the opportunity to join varsity for a year. \n\"Fortunately, a transfer is still allowed to practice, regardless of whether they lose the whole season or whether they have to shed the first six weeks, like it's in Nadia's case,\" SHP girls water polo coach Jon Burke. \"But sure, I know that any transfer that loses some eligibility is understandably going to be itching to shoot a basket, or throw a water polo ball, or hit a baseball, or whatever it is.\" \nPaquin will make her debut with the Gators, the eight-time reigning CCS Division II champions, during Wednesday's showdown with West Catholic Athletic League rival St. Francis in Mountain View. \n\"I expect her to be a major part of our success moving forward,\" Burke said. \nConrad, meanwhile, is in a similar situation to Hunter Bishop, a senior at Serra High in San Mateo who also transferred from St. Francis. \nA Menlo Park resident, waking up at 6 a.m. for an hour commute was too much for Conrad, and he chose to enroll at M-A in the middle of his freshman year, which allowed him to play varsity baseball with older brother Kodiak. \n\"My brother went to M-A as well, so I've been to the football games in past years, basketball games as well,\" said Miles, who knew over 100 kids at M-A because he attended middle school with them at Hillview. \"So I know the school pretty well and it was easy for me with all my friends being here. \n\"Curriculum-wise, it's the same,\" he added. \"Math classes are taught a little different there, but it was easy to adapt.\" \nConrad will make his varsity debut after the bye week, Oct. 9 at Sequoia in Redwood City. \n\"I'm excited, he's going to have his first varsity game next Friday,\" said Rodgers, who is verbally committed to play football at UC Davis. \"He's been working hard at practice, throwing dimes to everybody, so I'm really excited to see what he's going to do in a game. I know he's going to be nothing short of perfect.\" Switching sides Braden Bishop was a baseball standout at St. Francis and this summer was selected in the third round of the MLB draft by the Seattle Mariners. But after two years as a Lancer, his younger brother yearned for change. \n\"The commute was pretty tough, early mornings so I just got pretty tired of it,\" said Hunter, whose family resides in San Carlos, minutes away from Serra, a WCAL rival. \"So I reached out to Serra at the start of summer going into my junior year and I was talking to the admissions director about transferring and just to see what availability there was and what options I had.\" \nAfter a slow start, the transfer process sped up and upon admission Bishop contacted Serra football coach Patrick Walsh in order to participate in summer workouts. \n\"In terms of integration and getting involved with the system and meeting new friends as part of a new community, that's pretty much taken care of in the summertime,\" Walsh said. \nIt's not the first time the Padres have welcomed a transfer student-athlete, but it's rare. It's only happened twice in eight years for Serra baseball coach Craig Gianinno, who inherited Bishop in the spring. One of the best known cases is eventual NCAA running back Adonis Smith, who joined the football program as a junior in 2008 after playing at Bishop O'Dowd in Oakland. \n\"It's not rare that a football coach gets contacted directly by the family,\" Walsh said. \"I can't even tell you how many times I've been called over 15 years, at which point by CCS rules and WCAL rules, you immediately have to turn that over to the admissions department. The amount of transfers we've had at Serra in my 15 years versus people who have thought about transferring or called about transferring, I'd just call it 50 to 1. ... We've had three or four transfers in 15 years, we haven't had very many, at least that I can remember. And it works for some families, and sometimes the grass isn't always greener. ... \n\"Frankly, it's a lot easier for a kid to get ingrained in a school when they start freshman year,\" Walsh added. \"That's when you make some of your best relationships, you make your friends, so I like to see kids stick it out as long as there's not some crazy reasons as to why they should transfer.\" 'A ton of scrutiny' Alerting the admissions department immediately is also the practice at St. Francis, then it's a waiting process. \n\"We have a wait list of kids that maybe haven't gotten in as freshmen that still express interest,\" St. Francis athletic director Mike Pilawski said. \"So for us, it all depends on whether our school has space and are able to take kids.\" \nThat doesn't keep conspiracy theorists from spreading whispers about recruiting. \n\"I think people say that all the time just because we can draw people from all over as opposed to a public school that just gets the kids from their district,\" Pilawski said. \"I mean, we have pretty strict rules and I would say the private schools are under a ton of scrutiny when it comes to kids leaving or coming. So, yeah, there's no recruiting happening and there's really specific rules regarding it.\" \nWalsh said: \"To think that I would recruit freshmen and JVs out of St. Francis is laughable. ... I would never do that. It's just the wrong thing to do with people that I consider my friends.\" Smooth transition Bishop didn't contact Gianinno until school started. Because he also played baseball at St. Francis, as a junior he was forced to miss nearly 20 games during the sit-out period in the spring. \n\"I think he learned a lot about the game and about himself being able to see it from a different point of view because it was clearly outside of his control,\" Gianinno said. \nBishop, who made the transition from quarterback to wide receiver this season, enjoyed a breakthrough summer as an outfielder, including baseball showcases at the Area Code Games in Long Beach and the eighth annual Under Armour All-America Game at Wrigley Field, home to the Chicago Cubs. \n\"I definitely feel really comfortable right now where I'm at,\" Bishop said. \"Last year I was coming into the school, I was a little uneasy because I didn't know everyone there. And I'm going to meet some new faces, I gotta deal with some new teachers, so it was tough, but I got situated pretty quickly once school got started last year.\" \nAdhir Ravipati, in his first year as M-A's football coach, believes a foundation based on family and \"everybody treating each other out there like it's their brother\" can help smooth out the transition for tranfers. \n\"There is kind of a learning curve,\" he said. \"It's kind of like they're freshmen in high school all over again in terms of like they're trying to find their way in a new school. Where classes are, how is the program run, what are the expectations and foundation?\" \nSpeaking of expectations, the wait is nearly over. These transfers won't have to sit out next week. \nEmail Vytas Mazeika at vmazeika@dailynewsgroup.com ; follow him at Twitter.com/dailynewsvytas .", "external_links": [], "published": "2015-10-01T23:45:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T00:04:22.539+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
