STAN LIM, FILE PHOTO Related article » Riverside County sheriff's officials have decided to meet federal immigration agents halfway regarding jailed immigrants wanted for deportation.\nThe county’s largest police agency — and operator of all the county’s jails — has agreed to notify Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials of the impending release of jailed non-U.S. citizens.\nBut the Sheriff’s Department is rejecting ICE’s request to detain jailed immigrants for up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release date.\n“The (sheriff’s) Corrections Division is in the process of revising its policy and is actively working with ICE officials to begin the implementation,” Lt. David Teets said in an email released Thursday, Oct. 1.\nIn San Bernardinio County, authorities also are notifying ICE when immigrants sought by the agency are being released so deportation officers can arrive in time to pick them up\nUntil a few years ago, the Riverside sheriff's email notes, state prisons and county jails throughout California honored ICE “detainers” as if they were federal warrants, keeping immigrant inmates behind bars for up to 48 hours beyond their scheduled release dates.\nBut because of legal and social changes, the detainers now are considered requests, rather than mandatory. A U.S. District Court ruling even found that a sheriff’s department violated an inmate’s constitutional rights by simply honoring an ICE detainer.\nYet, refusal to cooperate with ICE also is controversial, particularly in the wake of several high-profile cases. In San Francisco, for example, a recently released jail inmate — with five prior deportations — was charged with fatally shooting a woman walking on a city pier.\n“We are seeing counties wanting to find a way to cooperate with ICE,” American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California attorney Jennie Pasquarella recently told The Associated Press.\nMany jurisdictions won’t detain immigrants for ICE, Pasquarella said, but will tell the agency when immigrants on the detainer list are being released.\nLast year, ICE announced plans to focus on more serious offenders and to ask law enforcement agencies to at least notify federal authorities when immigrants wanted for deportation are being released.\nAs the Riverside County sheriff's statement noted, ICE continues to have access to fingerprint data taken during jail bookings and uses the information to check inmates’ local criminal records and immigration status.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "external_links": ["http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/twitter-ico.jpg", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/fb-ico.jpg", "http://assets.pinterest.com/js/pinmarklet.js?r=", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/gallery/nvlk3r-ice.jpg", "http://images.onset.freedom.com/pressenterprise/thumb/nvlk3r-ice.jpg", "http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#username=YOUR-ACCOUNT-ID", "http://common.onset.freedom.com/images/gallery/mail-ico.jpg"], "published": "2015-10-01T03:00:00.000+03:00", "crawled": "2015-10-02T18:18:42.339+03:00", "highlightTitle": ""}
